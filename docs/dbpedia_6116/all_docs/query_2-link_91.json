        "text": "Everyone who knows me will freely admit I am the biggest movie buff they know. My answers to most questions come in the form of a movie quote, or at the very least, an analogy of how it relates to a film. In my youth, I was even accepted to graduate film school before choosing instead to “take a year off and work for a year”. Obviously, I never went back.\n\nCinema studies is not the direction my career took, obviously. I’ve spent the last two decades in the automotive industry, training car dealers from everything to sales, Internet, BDC, and digital marketing. As part of this, we built a software at DealerKnows that reviews the efforts of salespeople, BDC, and internet sales manager as to how well they use their CRM, and how thoroughly they manage their Internet leads. I, and the team at DealerKnows, have a trusted reputation based on our experience and knowledge to assess what is and isn’t working in a car dealership.\n\nAs part of this, we built an automotive software solution that monitors, grades, and reviews how thoroughly salespeople, BDC and Internet teams follow up with their sales opportunities. While sales training and lead management may be what I’m known for, it certainly is a far cry from my passion for film. So I decided to turn some of my review time and effort toward something that makes me very happy. Watching movies.\n\nWhile I’ve always watched movies (and loved going to the theater), I wasn’t very consistent with it. I LOVE movies and my wife LOVES sitcoms, so for the last 20 years or so, we compromised and we watched sitcoms. 🙂\n\nWhen New Years 2020 came around, I felt it was time that I rewarded myself with a resolution I enjoy rather than the typical one (diet, exercise, lose weight, eat better) that I hate and generally gave up on by mid-February. So I decided I would give myself an objective I might actually enjoy. I challenged myself to watch 365 movies in a year, one for each day. (Or given that it was a leap year, 366.) I ended up watching 500.\n\n(A pandemic that kept me at home and off the road helped, and hindsight 20/20, staying at home and watching movies (usually with my wife and kids) was honestly great for my mental health).\n\nHere are 6 things I learned from watching 500 movies.\n\n1) Introducing your kids to the films you loved in your youth are a great way to bond.\n\n2) There are many underwhelming films that didn’t deserve to be greenlit.\n\n2) Documentaries are IMPORTANT.\n\n3) Foreign films should not be overlooked.\n\n4) South Korea makes better horror films than anyone else.\n\n5) More family-friendly films need to be produced opposed to the gratuitously violent, foul-mouthed, sexually deviant movies that appear to be all the rage on the streaming networks. Movies are allowed to be smart and kid-friendly.\n\n6) I wouldn’t change a second about the time I spent with my wife and boys watching movies this year.\n\nBut for a handful of exceptions, I wrote a brief review on Twitter and Letterboxd of each film.\n\nHere are my super-short reviews of the 500 movies I watched in 2020.\n\n1st Movie Watched in 2020:\n\nMcFarland, USA\n\nKevin Costner was put on this Earth to do one thing and that’s to make amazing sports movies. This true story about working class high-school farmhands in a small Texas town has a beautiful story about family, friends, and community at its heart.\n\n★★★★\n\n2nd Movie Watched in 2020:\n\nRichard Jewell\n\nAnother true account finally telling the story from the other side that gives an innocent man a voice. Delicate filmmaking, which is a necessity given it is a fairly unlikable protagonist, but Sam Rockwell is superb as usual.\n\n★★★\n\n3rd Movie Watched in 2020:\n\nUnknown\n\nA relatively predictable amnesia plot device sends Liam Neeson (Liam Neesons) trying to solve a mystery we’ve all figured out already. Another on-the-run, forgettable (pun intended) action flick.\n\n★★\n\n4th Movie Watched in 2020:\n\nDie Hard\n\nFor the nth time. Introduced my 14 year old to this. Had to. It’s a rite of passage and John McLane is the perfect Everyman hero, played masterfully by Bruce Willis (Bruce Willy). It had a profound impact on me when I saw it around his age as well. One of my favorite films of all time. Watch it every year, and never turn it off if I come across it. Perfect acting, incredible dialogue, impeccable action, hilarious comedic moments, top-shelf special effects, impressive stunt work and surprising emotion. This masterpiece has got it all.\n\n★★★★★\n\nFollow me on Twitter\n\n5th Movie Watched in 2020:\n\nMonty Python and the Holy Grail\n\n‘Tis but a scratch. A staple of sketch comedy. Monty Python has always been pretty hit or miss for me. The individual skits are better than the sum of its parts, which is an uneven film in the end. A few iconic lines, but needed my boys to see it.\n\n★★★\n\n6th Movie Watched in 2020:\n\nMarriage Story\n\nBittersweet, but beautiful. Loved the long takes that let the actors shine. Divorces are pretty, and this movie doesn’t paint it to be, but unlike other movies on the topic, doesn’t position it as the end of the world either. Adam Driver has chops for days.\n\n★★★★\n\n7th Movie Watched in 2020:\n\nDrunk Parents\n\nIf it weren’t for a couple shots of Salma, and a few hilarious line readings by Alec, I’d have been rather disappointed I watched this film of selfish people trying to trick . But admittedly, I did laugh out loud quite a few times. Might be the best I’ve seen Gaffigan in a film, but that’s not saying much.\n\n★★\n\n8th Movie Watched in 2020:\n\nThe Intruder\n\nI want to like Dennis Quaid as an actor, but his skill level is slipping. He may not have been interesting to watch since The Rookie. An amiable couple deals with their house’s less than stable former owner/occupant. Now you can guess how the rest goes. Formulaic wannabe thriller that you can skip.\n\n★½\n\n9th Movie Watched in 2020:\n\nDim Sum Funeral\n\nA cast with promise ruined by a lousy script, boringly predictable outcome, and TERRIBLE audio work. I mean… unbelievably remedial audio throughout. Really takes away from any the dialogue. Like high school project level filmmaking. Skip.\n\n★\n\n10th Movie Watched in 2020:\n\nThe Two Popes\n\nJonathan Pryce’s acting was spot-on. Interesting script, amazing set design/location, and wonderful relationship between the two leads. Enjoyed watching the dynamics of their relationship flourish from distaste to argumentative to hesitancy to respect to friendship. Fernando Meirelles is one of my favorite directors so I knew it’d be great.Vatican City remains on my bucket list of places to go, and this telling of a transition between popes didn’t change that.\n\n★★★\n\nThe Two Popes Review on Twitter\n\nFollow me on Letterboxd\n\n11th Movie Watched in 2020:\n\nProblem Child\n\nIntroduced my kids to this mediocre movie from my youth. The child is wildly unlikable, even with a bad upbringing I feel he gets no wiggle room for his behavior. Nonetheless, John Ritter gave such a great performer, he is missed.\n\n★★\n\nProblem Child Review on Twitter\n\n12th Movie Watched in 2020:\n\nShazam!\n\nCame back to this cute superhero movie for a second viewing. Holds up as a worthy (and saccharine) edition to the DC universe. Approachable for kids. Zachary Levi was the right casting choice.\n\n13th Movie Watched in 2020:\n\nBad Times at the El Royale\n\nOriginally saw this in the theater and loved it. Still holds up on second viewing and solidified my initial opinion that it’s one of my favorite films of the last few years. Cynthia Erivo is captivating in this, and the entire cast is fun to watch. That long take opening sequence was such a smart choice, and I am enamored with the stylized filming of this movie. Drew Goddard made me a major fan with this one.\n\n★★★★½\n\nBad Times at the El Royale Twitter Review\n\n14th Movie Watched in 2020:\n\n1917\n\nFirst off, I’m amazed at the scale of it. The sheer size of the set and all extras and choreography melts my head. The entire film seems to have been filmed in 3-4 takes at the most. It is a filmmaking marvel. Much like Sam Mendes said, it’s refreshing watching a movie without movie stars playing the leads. There is a really nice flow between intensity, action, and tender moments. The acting was great but I can’t get over the cinematography. You can’t take your eyes off the screen, and the very very end hit me right in the feels more than I expected it to.\n\n★★★★½\n\n1917 Movie Review on Twitter (part 1)\n\n1917 Movie Review on Twitter (part 2)\n\n1917 Movie Review on Twitter (part 3)\n\n15th Movie Watched in 2020:\n\nSigns\n\nOne of M. Night Shyamalan’s best films, if not the best. Mel Gibson is an immensely talented actor, as is Joaquin Phoenix. The fact he was able to tell the tale of a global invasion all through the intimate experience of one family, all while adding in his (a)typical brand of mysticism makes this a must-see love for all.\n\nIn this instance, it was being introduced to my boys when their mom wasn’t home 🙂\n\n★★★★½\n\nGet to know Joe Webb\n\n16th Movie Watched in 2020:\n\nHolmes and Watson\n\nAdding this one to my list even though I turned it off somewhere around an hour into the running time. This movie is wildly unfunny. So bad it’s like they tried to make it horrible to prove a point. I am a Big fan of John C. Reilly – but these types of films make me question who approves scripts at studios. One of the worst films I’ve watched in a while.\n\n½\n\nHolmes and Watson Movie Review on Twitter\n\n17th Movie Watched in 2020:\n\nHappy Death Day 2U\n\nThe original was relatively entertaining, so was hoping this sequel was equally as fun. It got close. I do like the main characters as they run around the slasher-themed Groundhog Day’s premise. Cast makes it watchable, but writing was weaker in this one.\n\n★★½\n\n18th Movie Watched in 2020:\n\nBrightburn\n\nHad high hopes for this given its superhero kid premise coupled with a horror theme. Besides a few shock-value kills with significant blood-loss, there is little here to care about.\n\n★★\n\n19th Movie Watched in 2020:\n\nSchool of Rock\n\nIntroducing my boys to this. I remember it being a bit better when I saw it 17 years ago. Maybe I’m too much of a grown-up, but Jack Black’s character annoyed me more with his irresponsible nature than I recall. Decent movie about the championing of kids chasing their dreams, but not as good as I had remembered.\n\n★★½\n\nSchool of Rock Movie Review on Twitter\n\n20th Movie Watched in 2020:\n\nParasite\n\nWhile I still feel there were a couple best pictures nominees I enjoyed more, I was more impressed with this Korean film about socio-economic plight in South Korea and a family’s conniving ways to reverse their situation. This movie is sticking in my mind longer already than all the others. Engrossing, darkly comic, and haunting. (Update: Nearly a year later, and I’ll double-down. This film was more inventive than most anything that’s come out since. Not many movies have had such an impact.)\n\n★★★★½\n\nParasite Movie Review on Twitter\n\nSubscribe to me on Youtube\n\n21st Movie Watched in 2020:\n\nAce Ventura: When Nature Calls\n\nThe first one was a classic, so let my boys see the sequel, regardless how terrible it is. Same bits and brands of physical humor. Not enough to make you laugh out loud more than once or twice.\n\n★½\n\n22nd Movie Watched in 2020:\n\nTeen Titans Go! To the Movies\n\nKids cartoon grown up into a feature that tries a little too hard to be sardonic. Has a few good laughs for adults. Decent enough for young ones.\n\n★★\n\n23rd Movie Watched in 2020:\n\nDeath Becomes Her\n\nAlways liked this movie more than maybe it deserves. Cast worked great together (not that you can go wrong with Meryl). At the time, the effects were top notch, and it’s just the right amount of macabre comedy.\n\n★★★½\n\n24th Movie Watched in 2020:\n\nThe Irishman\n\nScorsese can’t go wrong, and this cast was great. Story seemed a bit meandering, obviously, but still engrossing throughout the running time. In my opinion, Pesci was the glue that held this movie together. Some masterful camera work and the de-aging didn’t bother me at all. Just could have used some more editing.\n\n★★★★\n\nThe Irishman Movie Review on Twitter\n\n25th Movie Watched in 2020:\n\nThe Laundromat\n\nNever knew someone could make a movie interesting enough to display the inherent need of campaign finance reform, but here we are. Meryl steals the film as only she can, even though the different sequences don’t fit together as tightly as the director likely intended.\n\n★★★\n\nThe Laundromat Movie Review on Twitter\n\nSubscribe to our monthly DealerKnewsletter\n\n26th Movie Watched in 2020:\n\nEmpire of the Sun\n\nStill a tremendous film. Proving to my son how Christian Bale has always been a phenomenal actor and Steven Spielberg is a filmmaking icon. Didn’t have the emotional depth of some of his later work, but a fine piece of cinema nonetheless.\n\n★★★★\n\nEmpire of the Sun Movie Review on Twitter\n\n27th Movie Watched in 2020:\n\nGemini Man\n\nSomewhat surprised this is an Ang Lee film as I find him a real auteur. This movie, however, is exactly what you expect it to be, with no surprises. De-aging on Will Smith works well in some scenes and poor in others. A few decent action sequences, but not enough to want to see a sequel.\n\n★★\n\nGemini Man Movie Review on Twitter\n\n28th Movie Watched in 2020:\n\nZombieland: Double Tap\n\nWorthy sequel. Similar stylized action comedy bits. The characters may have been a bit formulaic with little growth, but still an enjoyable family to watch. Murray in the credits was gold.\n\n★★★\n\nZombieland: Double Tap Movie Review on Twitter\n\n29th Movie Watched in 2020:\n\nThe Addams Family\n\nMy boys had already seen the live action movies which are great, (as well as the live stage musical), so we took a shot on the new 2019 animated movie. Not half bad. A few good bits. Decent voice work but nothing spectacular.\n\n★★½\n\nThe Addams Family Movie Review on Twitter\n\n30th Movie Watched in 2020:\n\nHellboy (2019)\n\nI’d watch David K Harbour read the phone book (if those still existed) but the make-up does take away from how good he can be as an actor. Nonetheless, worthy remake, decent comic book story, and all involved did the character justice. Faithful enough.\n\n★★★\n\nHellboy Movie Review on Twitter\n\nContact DealerKnows to convert more leads\n\n31st Movie Watched in 2020:\n\nUncle Buck\n\nI remember seeing this a couple times in the theater when I was just 13 or so. Loved it then and loved it now. Reminds me how much of a loss John Candy’s death was, not just to comedy, but to film. Few actors had that much heart.\n\n★★★★\n\nUncle Buck Movie Review on Twitter\n\n32nd Movie Watched in 2020:\n\nWhat About Bob?\n\nBill was in full-on Murray mode for this, and I tend to think it’s one of his best roles of his career. Dreyfus plays off him well and the neuroses are strong in this one.\n\n★★★½\n\nWhat About Bob? Movie Review on Twitter\n\n33rd Movie Watched in 2020:\n\nThe Gentlemen\n\nGuy Ritchie’s best film since Snatch. Excellent machismo acting all around. While I want to say Colin Farrell steals it, every single player shines bright. Twists, turns, and quality tough-guy dialogue. A must see.\n\n★★★★\n\nThe Gentlemen Movie Review on Twitter\n\n34th Movie Watched in 2020:\n\nFord v Ferrari\n\nSolid story, and stellar race sequences. Great bio about the history of two incredible vehicle brands going at it where the rubber meets the road. In my opinion, the Academy got it wrong not including Christian Bale in as Best Supporting Actor vs Pacino’s role in The Irishman.\n\n★★★½\n\nFord v Ferrari Movie Review on Twitter\n\n35th Movie Watched in 2020:\n\nSearch Party\n\nA throw-away knock-off strongly attempting to duplicate the Hangover franchise. TJ Miller has a knack for playing the most annoying assbag in every movie. Even if that’s not the role, his character becomes somehow is. Hard pass.\n\n★½\n\nSearch Party Movie Review on Twitter\n\nLike our movie reviews? Now review your sales team.\n\n36th Movie Watched in 2020:\n\nHarriet\n\nFor such an incredible life, they made this movie more intimate than I would have expected. A few of the shots and edits were a bit “after-school special” but thankfully Cynthia Erivo saved it and brought with it the gravitas it deserved.\n\n★★★\n\nHarriet Movie Review on Twitter\n\n37th Movie Watched in 2020:\n\nGroundhog Day\n\nMuch like everyone else, I must have seen this a couple dozen times, but my boys hadn’t so this was what we watched for movie night. While I used to find it funny, now as a middle aged man who sees people that have regrets they missed their chance to be with the right person, I don’t find it near as funny as endearing, hopeful, and sweet.\n\n★★★★\n\nGroundhog Day Movie Review on Twitter\n\n38th Movie Watched in 2020:\n\nThe Curse of La Llorona\n\nMy wife loves horror movies. I don’t mind them, but they’re never my first choice. They typically don’t scare me, or make me jump, but they do make me angry. Especially when the victims (parents and kids in this case) act so irrationally idiotic they almost deserve being terrified. While I like Linda Cardellini as an actress, and wanted the family to live, there was far too much that made me frustrated. This is one of those movies. Better than the average but not as good as I’d hoped.\n\n★★½\n\nThe Curse of La Llorona Movie Review on Twitter\n\n39th Movie Watched in 2020:\n\nSurf’s Up\n\nSeriously, the only thing Shia Lebeouf has ever been in where he wasn’t considerably annoying. (So far… my opinion changes at a later movie.) Graphics are acceptable at best and Jeff Bridges’ voice work is phoned in. Not a necessity to watch.\n\n★★\n\nSurfs Up Movie Review on Twitter\n\n40th Movie Watched in 2020:\n\nPlaying with Fire\n\nSometimes, even if the movie isn’t good, I enjoy it because it means well. It’s heart is in the right place throughout. I liked all the main actors in the film, and while they aren’t winning awards, they’re in the movie for the right reasons. Mo one delivers great performances (nor is the directing top shelf), but they seemed friendly and meant well. Good clean family fun, with no major issues to root against (beyond plausibility).\n\n★★★\n\nPlaying with Fire Movie Review on Twitter\n\nFollow me on Twitter\n\n41st Movie Watched in 2020:\n\nReal Steel\n\nThis is a formulaic, yet underrated sports movie. It’s Over the Top but with robot boxing instead of arm wrestling. Estranged father wrongly considered a deadbeat dad whose secretly loving and talented wins the heart of his overly confident preteen son through competitive sport. Better graphics and CGI than given credit for. Sure, it’s very predictable with hints of every underdog boxing movie (namely the original Rocky), but still entertaining and warm-hearted.\n\n★★★\n\nReal Steel Movie Review on Twitter\n\n42nd Movie Watched in 2020:\n\nMars Needs Moms\n\nI thought this was just a weirdly animated kids movie until I saw the end credits to learn this is another Zemeckis motion capture movie. The child protagonist is quite annoying which makes much of this film tedious to watch.\n\n★½\n\nMars Needs Moms Movie Review on Twitter\n\n43rd Movie Watched in 2020:\n\nDoctor Sleep\n\nThis sequel to The Shining had zero scares in it, but is a considerably better, more cohesive story than the original. I’m always a fan of Ewan McGregor and liked how they revisited the old film while expanding on the power of “shining”. A considerably more interesting universe after this movie.\n\n★★★\n\nDoctor Sleep Movie Review on Twitter\n\n44th Movie Watched in 2020:\n\nSonic the Hedgehog\n\nOf all films based on video games, I’m not shy to say this has been my favorite. (Sorry, Mortal Kombat and Detective Pikachu). James Marsden was the affable partner to the antic Sonic, without making either unlikable. Jim Carrey as Dr. Robotnik brought the comedy to a movie that held a fast enough pace to keep the whole family engaged. Good clean fun family movie. (This also happens to be the last movie I have seen in a movie theater)\n\n★★★\n\nSonic the Hedgehog Movie Review on Twitter\n\n45th Movie Watched in 2020:\n\nAlita: Battle Angel\n\nA sci-fi spectacle overstuffed w: plans for its mythos to be intriguing but it rings self-indulgent and hollow. Film ends with no final confrontation, but instead a cliffhanger hoping for a sequel. You can’t spend all film talking about one villain and never face off against the villain, simply because you’re so arrogant you expect it to be a success and deserve a sequel. Entertaining but drawn out.\n\n★★\n\nAlita Battle Angel Movie Review on Twitter\n\n46th Movie Watched in 2020:\n\nMiracle\n\nI still consider this the best ice hockey movie ever made. (You’re overrated, Slap Shot). And it’s not the quality filmmaking that makes it work, but Kurt Russell. His turn as Herb Brooks is the best acting of his career, and that intensity he brings carries the film to an emotional denouement when we already know the ending.\n\n★★★★\n\nMiracle Movie Review on Twitter\n\n47th Movie Watched in 2020:\n\nJohn Wick\n\nI’ve seen this multiple times, but still love the universe it created. The mythology with the gold coins, hotel sanctuary, professional courtesies among criminals. Stunt work and story come together in one of the top action movies of the last decade. With each new Wick movie, Keanu proves he is a great match for the role. Classic, man against the odds shoot ‘em up.\n\n★★★★½\n\nJohn Wick Movie Review on Twitter\n\n48th Movie Watched in 2020:\n\nThe Mighty Ducks\n\nEmilio!!! Estevez delivers some uninspired blandness to match the clumsiness of the script in this hockey version of the Bad News Bears. No redeeming qualities other than some subtle acting by Joshua Jackson. With that said, there is never a good reason to hate an underdog sports movie.\n\n★★\n\nThe Mighty Ducks Movie Review on Twitter\n\n49th Movie Watched in 2020:\n\nGremlins\n\nNothing like a “cute critter turned into evil mischievous little murderers on Christmas time” movie to get my kids to do their homework.\n\nRemember liking it more as a kid, as I didn’t notice how irresponsible Billy and his family was then.\n\n★★½\n\nGremlins Movie Review on Twitter\n\n50th Movie Watched in 2020:\n\nThe Truman Show\n\nEvery time I see this movie, it moves higher up my list of favorites. I’m more and more in awe of the collective sum of the film when I watch it. While the unique concept and Peter Weir’s direction drive this film, as well as a nimble turn by Jim Carrey and supporting cast, it is the phenomenal musical score that is the movie’s secret weapon. The rare ability for a film to be big budget, artsy, smart, and Hollywood-friendly. A treat of a five-star film.\n\n★★★★★\n\nThe Truman Show Movie Review on Twitter\n\nWhat is your TaskTeacher grade? Find out now.\n\n51st Movie Watched in 2020:\n\nThe Mask\n\nOnly Jim Carrey could play this role. Super cheesy with a very weak set-up and no backstory, but at the time, the effects were decent. Nonetheless, a cute movie for older kids. Comedy holds up, but wasn’t a necessary rewatch.\n\n★★★\n\nThe Mask Movie Review on Twitter\n\n52nd Movie Watched in 2020:\n\nKindergarten Cop\n\nAh yes, the 1990 classic where Arnold Schwarzenegger plays an undercover cop as a kindergarten teacher. Pretty standard kids fare with a stilted pace yet some very memorable lines. The main cast plays to their strengths but the kids steal the show.\n\n★★★\n\nKindergarten Cop Movie Review on Twitter\n\n53rd Movie Watched in 2020:\n\nHotel Artemis\n\nKnew nothing about this going in and made it better. Unique story with an off-the-wall cast of quality stars made this gritty, one-location crime movie fly by. Predictable but interesting characters keep this surprisingly watchable. Dave Bautista showed he has some acting chops with his muscles. Sterling K Brown is someone easy to root for regardless of role. And Jodie Foster reminds you how great she is in almost any role.\n\n★★½\n\nHotel Artemis Movie Review on Twitter\n\n54th Movie Watched in 2020:\n\nD2: The Mighty Ducks\n\nThe sequel to the underdog kids hockey movie is back and they’re taking on international teams. My unpopular opinion – this is a better movie than it’s predecessor. Just better personalities among the cast of characters. Not only Emilio not as annoying or introspective as he was in the first movie, but they focused as much on the kids as the adults, thankfully.\n\n★★★\n\nD2 Mighty Ducks Movie Review on Twitter\n\n55th Movie Watched in 2020:\n\nIsn’t It Romantic\n\nMy wife teases me constantly saying I shouldn’t like romantic comedies as a man. I don’t care. I like them. And this was better than I expected. It is in the same vein as 13 Going On 30 so if you liked that movie concept, you’ll enjoy this. Adam Devine is goofy fun like usual. And I will say this is the least irksome I’ve found Rebel Wilson. Cute movie.\n\n★★★\n\n56th Movie Watched in 2020:\n\nKnives Out\n\nI really enjoyed this movie when I first saw it in the theater, but it took watching it again to realize I love it. Director did a great job with his close-up shots and angles when filming. Going off steady cam for just one scene to create the feeling of mayhem and instability was so smart. The entire cast was great and writing is wonderful, but it is Daniel Craig’s turn as super sleuth Benoit Blanc that seals it. He and his character need a franchise. I’d watch him solve interesting cases with other large casts forever.\n\n★★★★½\n\nKnives Out Movie Review on Twitter\n\n57th Movie Watched in 2020:\n\nD3: The Mighty Ducks\n\nThe 3rd and final film in the Mighty Ducks canon shows why Emilio Estevez, Jonathan Jackson and cast needn’t not continue on with the franchise. Formulaic and turned previously likable characters unlikable. Very little time spent on ice or hockey, with no believable character arc spent on reflection or redemption. Is this too much to ask of a kid’s movie? Probably.\n\n★½\n\nD3 The Mighty Ducks Movie Review on Twitter\n\n58th Movie Watched in 2020:\n\n21 Bridges\n\nUptempo crime saga plays out over the course of one night and keeps a steady pace to the end. A lot of shoot ‘em up style action mixing in with decent acting thanks to another quality turn by Chadwick Boseman. Predictable but entertaining flick that doesn’t take the path you expect it to with the initial concept and set-up.\n\n★★★\n\n21 Bridges Movie Review on Twitter\n\n59th Movie Watched in 2020:\n\nSpies in Disguise\n\nA better animated family flick than I expected. Really solid work voice by Will Smith, Ben Mendelssohn, and Tom Holland. Tried to tug heart strings in the traditional cartoon ways, and while not ringing hollow, didn’t pack a punch. Still delivers a few really good laughs.\n\n★★★\n\nSpies in Disguise Movie Review on Twitter\n\n60th Movie Watched in 2020:\n\nBombshell\n\nThis true story of the sexual harassment that occurred at Fox News over the years is a cautionary tale of power urging good people to turn a blind eye and keep quiet for the sake of tribalism is frustratingly relevant.\n\nThe cast is a virtual who’s who of powerful actresses taking on important roles that spotlight the inequalities of gender in the workplace. Margot Robbie, and Nicole Kidman were excellent, but Theron stole it as Megan Kelly. How Charlize didn’t get a nom for her portrayal, I’ll never know. Required viewing for men and women.\n\n★★★★\n\nBombshell Movie Review on Twitter\n\nSubscribe to me on Youtube\n\n61st Movie Watched in 2020:\n\nThe Day After Tomorrow\n\nDecent disaster flick doing its best to be socially relevant slightly before climate change was a trending topic. Cast is interchangeable in their roles. Even given the stakes, the gravity of the outcome never hits home.\n\n★★\n\nThe Day After Tomorrow Movie Review on Twitter\n\n62nd Movie Watched in 2020:\n\nHigh Noon\n\nAlmost 70 years old, this black and white western still keeps pace throughout, primarily because of a great score throughout that amplifies the impending confrontation. Gary Cooper deftly plays the brave, weary Marshall (in a very realistic, stoic manner) defending a town that doesn’t deserve him from 4 hoods arriving on a train. Some good cinematography and direction makes the straight-forward film breeze by.\n\n★★★\n\n63rd Movie Watched in 2020:\n\nShrek\n\nThis is a top 10 animated movie for me. Sacrilege, you say? Graphics may not be mind-blowing, but the screenplay’s subversive (hilarious) take on the knight-in-shining-armor and damsel-in-distress wins laughs throughout. Sight gags are brilliantly placed as well. You catch something new each time you watch it. Perfect line readings by a brilliant ensemble (headlined by Eddie and Mike) make this a classic.\n\n★★★★½\n\n64th Movie Watched in 2020:\n\nSky High\n\nI’m sure this movie likely got bad reviews, but it’s still a watchable superhero movie. Sure it’s conventional and undistinguishable, and it’s characters could have been played by anyone, but it doesn’t need to be dismissed. Completely watchable kids movie.\n\n★★\n\nSky High Movie Review on Twitter\n\n65th Movie Watched in 2020:\n\nSpenser Confidential\n\nThis movie’s heart is in the right place, but it doesn’t have enough heart. Peter Berg and Mark Wahlberg are a good team and even if this doesn’t hit the usual high marks the duo achieves, i’ll watch anything and everything they make together. They get the best out of one another. In this instance, though, they wasted a spirited supporting cast, including Iliza Shlesinger – who deserves a spin-off of this character – in a garden variety dirty cop flick. Thankfully, Berg’s editing was less erratic that his last few efforts, so it made the movie more consumable which fit the pace well. Still worth the watch.\n\nSpenser Confidential Movie Review on Twitter\n\n66th Movie Watched in 2020:\n\nStargate\n\nI remember LOVING this when it came out. Boy, am I seeing it through a different lens now. One note characters and poorly assembled story with little motivation. Nothing worth biting into here. I thought this had more meaning when I first saw it. Like it was a mythological tale about our creation. I realize now I was reading too much into it. It’s not that deep. The movie is nothing more than a campy, reaching sci-fi vehicle.\n\n★★\n\nStargate Movie Review on Twitter\n\n67th Movie Watched in 2020:\n\nFighting With My Family\n\nWrestling isn’t my thing, and that’s the central concept of this true story, but the familial relations at least kept me tuning in. Admirable job from the actors, and a respectable turn from Vince Vaughn. He was funny without being ingratiating, and Florence Pugh in the lead role was fresh. Okay in a pinch but nothing to write home about.\n\n★★\n\nFighting With My Family Movie Review on Twitter\n\n68th Movie Watched in 2020:\n\nSan Andreas\n\nYou don’t watch this to see smoldering actors and their overdramatic close-ups. You watch for destruction, and while so much is over the top, the visual effects are great. The Rock defies all laws of physics to save his family during a catastrophic earthquake. More cracks in the script than the crust. My 8 year old described it best- “this movie is only close calls”.\n\n★★\n\nSan Andreas Movie Review on Twitter\n\n69th Movie Watched in 2020:\n\nOsmosis Jones\n\nThis only gets 2 stars because of how relevant it is in these confounding COVID-19 times. This half live action/half animated 2001 movie tells the tale of a deadly virus that infects a sloppy Bill Murray (think unhealthy USA). However, the body of Bill is run by an obtuse leader (mayor phlegm) who cares only about an upcoming election and spinning the narrative that the virus is nothing more than a simple cold or flu. Without leadership, it is up to the citizens of Bill (other antibodies and cells) to try to stop the infection. Analogies abound in this unwell film, but so apropos given our current circumstances.\n\n★★\n\nOsmosis Jones Movie Review on Twitter\n\n70th Movie Watched in 2020:\n\nMa\n\nIn this frustrating thriller, Octavia Spencer attempts to summon a bit of Kathy Bates’ Annie Wilkes from the superior film Misery, but with none of the nuance. The woman known as Ma never strikes fear in the viewer, and barely in the teenyboppers she stalks. The tile character was written unhinged from the start, and worst of all, gave us no victims to care for.\n\n★★\n\nMa Movie Review on Twitter\n\n71st Movie Watched in 2020:\n\n2012\n\nKeeping with our disaster movie theme during the COVID-19 crisis, this is Roland Emmerich’s denouement to the genre. Takes down much of the Earth with little regret (and average quality effects). While I remember the buzz about date of 12-21-2012 and the end of the Mayan calendar, this film never brought with it the mythos that prediction deserved. The devastation of our planet is so significant, it separates the viewer from the gravity of the situation. In the end, this movie never brought with it a fear factor, just the wow. And even the “wow” isn’t very exciting.\n\n★★\n\n2012 Movie Review on Twitter\n\n72nd Movie Watched in 2020:\n\nDamien: Omen II\n\nWhile the original film had a creepiness to it, this schlocky sequel didn’t. Hadn’t seen this in over 30 years… it wasn’t scary then and still isn’t. Horror movies normally have more intriguing antagonists than protagonists (and the devil being the bad guy should be no exception, but here both suck.\n\n★\n\nDamien Omen II Movie Review on Twitter\n\n73rd Movie Watched in 2020:\n\nThe Old Man & the Gun\n\nIn this saccharine-sweet true story of a non-violent, (now elderly) career bank robber played confidently by Robert Redford, the story meanders, but the charm is steady. Redford is gentlemanly and paced in this throwback to the days of good bad guys.\n\n★★★½\n\nThe Old Man & the Gun Movie Review on Twitter\n\n74th Movie Watched in 2020:\n\nThe Impossible\n\nThe harrowing tale of one family’s experience during the 2004 southeast Asian tsunami that hit Thailand gets top-shelf cinematic treatment. Naomi Watts earned every bit of her Oscar nom and Tom Holland was a revelation as a child actor. Effects were realistic and heartstrings are tugged just the right ways.\n\n★★★★\n\nThe Impossible Movie Review on Twitter\n\n75th Movie Watched in 2020:\n\nDodgeBall: A True Underdog Story\n\nThis juvenile comedy about a dodgeball tournament and battling neighborhood gyms have a few chuckles, but nothing to make it a must-see. Vince Vaughn relies too heavily on his typical overconfident snark, but it’s Ben Stiller who brings the humor both physically and verbally.\n\n★★½\n\nDodgeBall Movie Review on Twitter\n\n76th Movie Watched in 2020:\n\nThe Count of Monte Cristo\n\nI’ve always felt the Count of Monte Cristo is one of the truly great stories every written. No movie can capture Dumas’ novel of love, betrayal, jealousy, revenge and redemption, but this adaptation is faithful and admirable. Some poor editing choices with the transitions, and left much on the cutting room floor obviously to ensure it isn’t a bloated film, but they got good work from the cast. Knowing the true motivations of the characters from the book let me read into their performances that likely allow me to accept the film more. I’ll always find this yarn an entertaining adventure with a purely simple story at its center that should captivate audiences and stand the test of time.\n\n★★★½\n\nThe Count of Monte Cristo Movie Review on Twitter\n\n77th Movie Watched in 2020:\n\nBig Trouble in Little China\n\nJohn Carpenter’s genre-busting well-made 80’s B-movie (intentionally campy with Kurt Russell as the anti-hero) is schlocky fun for all the right reasons: Sarcastic comedy, Kung-fu, sorcery, and adventure. Dumb, clean fun.\n\n★★★\n\nBig Trouble in Little China Movie Review on Twitter\n\n78th Movie Watched in 2020:\n\nMission: Impossible\n\nGreat start to this super spy franchise. Admittedly, on repeated viewings, it’s a touch slower than the later films in the canon. Regardless, Cruise as Hunt has all the chaotic energy to play this role for the next 50 years. Great set-up, albeit a touch convoluted for my teenager, but the pace was just enough to keep his interest.\n\n★★★½\n\nMission Impossible Movie Review on Twitter\n\n79th Movie Watched in 2020:\n\nAnna\n\nCall me a sucker for a good choreographed gun ballet and hand-to-hand combat fight scene. Luc Besson kept me entertained with the time-jumping criss-crosses and agent-double-agent-triple-agent symphony of intrigue. Suspend belief that a way-too-easy-on-the-eyes 6ft 95lb supermodel is a certified bad-ass and watch this actioner with an open mind. I had low expectations going in, the scenery kept me watching, and the rest kept me engaged.\n\n★★★½\n\nAnna Movie Review on Twitter\n\n80th Movie Watched in 2020:\n\nThe Waterboy\n\nThe comedy is as infantile as the dim-witted Waterboy-turner-college-football-star. Hits and gags come rapid fire in the bayou, and this juvenile Adam Sandler classic still somehow appeases the masses with its low brow humor.\n\n★★★\n\nThe Waterboy Movie Review on Twitter\n\nFollow me on Letterboxd\n\n81st Movie Watched in 2020:\n\nMission: Impossible II\n\nThe franchise begins ramping up the death defying stunts but the film is stunted by a less-than-worthy villain. Tom Cruise is the more than confident Ethan Hunt. Thandie Newton plays nothing more than eye candy staring off into the distance. This is the low point in the series.\n\n★★\n\nMission Impossible II Movie Review on Twitter\n\n82nd Movie Watched in 2020:\n\nMission: Impossible III\n\nI’ve always believed this to be the best in the M:I canon. JJ Abrams’ frenetic editing and a great script upped the stakes by bringing personal relationships to the center stage over saving the world. More interesting side characters and even more realistic action sequences. Phillip Seymour Hoffman was the best villain in the series IMO, and he was genuinely fearsome in the role. Cruise always brings the action but this is the first of the M:I films where he truly brought the acting.\n\n★★★★\n\nMission Impossible III Movie Review on Twitter\n\n83rd Movie Watched in 2020:\n\nMission: Impossible – Ghost Protocol\n\nBrad Bird directs Cruise and company to new death-defying heights as IMF becomes disavowed. Foreign locales are simply set pieces for our secret agent heroes to risk life and limb trying to thwart a boring bad guy from starting nuclear war. All action, little heart, but a good reveal at the end keeps it close to home.\n\n★★★½\n\nMission Impossible Ghost Protocol Movie Review on Twitter\n\n84th Movie Watched in 2020:\n\nMission: Impossible – Rogue Nation\n\nThe M:I canon hits its stride in this 5th film, finally assembling the perfect IMF team Ethan Hunt needs to take on the ultimate baddies, the Syndicate. Smart story does a time jump that puts Cruise as enemy #1 of the government but still moving forward at all costs. This film finally shows Hunt isn’t infallible or perfect, adding to the gambit.\n\n★★★½\n\nMission Impossible Rogue Nation Movie Review on Twitter\n\n85th Movie Watched in 2020:\n\nMission: Impossible – Fallout\n\nIf they wanted to put a bow of this great super agent franchise, they couldn’t have done better than Fallout. Above and beyond the call-backs, over-the-top action sequences, and interwoven story lines/characters from past films, it did what made #3 so perfect… it made things personal for our heroes. A worthy ending (if they chose it to be) where trickery, relationships, hand-to-hand combat, car chases, and gun play all come together against a nasty group of bad guys.\n\n★★★★\n\nMission Impossible Fallout Movie Review on Twitter\n\n86th Movie Watched in 2020:\n\nK-9\n\nThis spiritless buddy cop film between a reckless (worthless) narcotics detective and a police dog had the promise of a feel-good film yet delivers on none of it. Something to be said that the German Shepard has more charisma than Jim Belushi.\n\n★\n\nK-9 Movie Review on Twitter\n\n87th Movie Watched in 2020:\n\nThe Rundown\n\nPeter Berg directs Dwayne “the Rock” Johnson in what was his first leading man role. (No, the Scorpion King wasn’t leading man worthy). Some good action sequences and solid editing coupled with a few funny scenes due to Sean William Scott keeps this film propped up. Good opening scene too sets the stage for the Rock’s physical dominance. Cheesy flick, but still watchable.\n\n★★½\n\nThe Rundown Movie Review on Twitter\n\n88th Movie Watched in 2020:\n\nBlood Father\n\nEven w/ a stretch of a storyline, Mel Gibson continues to be electric as an actor. I’ll watch him in anything. His weathered face ideal for these lived in roles of someone regretting actions of the past, as art imitates life. He’s an actor still worth rooting for and I’d watch him read the phone book. Decent side players, but rather unrealistic script hampers Mel’s consistently great acting.\n\n★★\n\nBlood Father Movie Review on Twitter\n\n89th Movie Watched in 2020:\n\nMr. Magoo\n\nOne of those live-action films from source material that simply didn’t need to be made. Dreadfully unfunny w/ a shoddy script, elementary directing, and cartoonish acting. Even Leslie Nielsen’s natural charm can’t raise this above one star.\n\n★\n\nMr. Magoo Movie Review on Twitter\n\n90th Movie Watched in 2020:\n\nYesterday\n\nLet me start off by saying I’m a Richard Curtis superfan and believe anything he touches is 24k gold. Danny Boyle is an incredible director also, so this was sure to be amazing and it is. Even on this, my third time viewing, the film keeps getting better. Beautiful concept and execution, with charming performances by Himesh Patel and Lilly James. This love letter to The Beatles (and love itself) is glorious.\n\n★★★★\n\nYesterday Movie Review on Twitter\n\n91st Movie Watched in 2020:\n\nOnward\n\nWhile the first half hour underwhelms by leaning too heavily on typical Disney tropes, this animated family adventure fairy tale picks up steam and ends with a lot of heart. Could have explored the magical realm they created for us more, and given the voice actors a few more touching moments early on, but the film still finds a way to tug the heartstrings.\n\n★★★½\n\nOnward Movie Review on Twitter\n\n92nd Movie Watched in 2020:\n\nThe Sound of Music\n\nThis Rodgers and Hammerstein musical holds up because of the incredible Julie Andrews and some of the best songs in any adaptation from stage to screen.

Storyline answers questions left open but doesn’t prevent this animated film from lacking.\n\n★★\n\nFrozen II Movie Review on Twitter\n\n94th Movie Watched in 2020:\n\nClimax\n\nMy face was contorted with horror, tension, and worry for the entire second half of this drug-induced, dance-fueled, uniquely-disturbing French film. It is overwhelmingly unsettling throughout, yet frighteningly hypnotic. Crazy good direction.\n\n★★★½\n\nClimax Movie Review on Twitter\n\n95th Movie Watched in 2020:\n\nFast and The Furious Presents: Hobbs and Shaw\n\nOkay, okay, okay… sometimes I just need a little high-octane drivel with ‘roid-fueled arrogance and weight-room rage splashed across the screen. It is like a high-budget, low-concept Tango and Cash. The star power of the four main actors is enough to keep your attention, and the witty banter and quick insults keeps it fun and light. However, the whole action flick is homey and ridiculous. Watch it and then you’ll forget you watched it two days later. A money grabber that stimulates the senses while numbing the brain. A middle-of-the-road, over-the-top action film with two body-building 50-somethings team up instead of duking it out.\n\n★½\n\n96th Movie Watched in 2020:\n\nTimmy Failure: Mistakes Were Made\n\nI’m not saying the title character is the most unlikeable person to ever be on film, but Voldemort has more redeeming qualities than this 5th grader. No remorse, selfish, annoying, little regard for authority. The four main adults in this do a respectable job, but it’s easy to look likable when the main character is the spawn of the Problem Child kid and Culkin in The Good Son.\n\nAvoid this kids movie at all cost.\n\n★\n\nTimmy Failure: Mistakes Were Made Movie Review on Twitter\n\n97th Movie Watched in 2020:\n\nThe Adventures of Tintin\n\nSpielberg outdid himself with this stunningly beautiful computer-animated tale. Colorful and lifelike, entertaining throughout; the entire film is a visual feat. Shocked I’d never watched this before as the story & action impress. Even with predictability built in, you want to see what’s next.\n\n★★★½\n\nThe Adventures of Tintin Movie Review on Twitter\n\n98th Movie Watched in 2020:\n\n¡Three Amigos!\n\nEl Guapo is the cherry on top of this light-hearted, 80’s comedy. Starring 3 of my favorite comedy icons, they went for family-friendly silliness rather than a full-on farce and it worked. Playfulness among the cast who weren’t taking themselves too seriously. A classic from my youth whose humor holds up. Admittedly, I’m likely giving it a full extra star just because how much i remember loving it as a kid, but I don’t care. If they filmed a sequel with Martin, Short, and Chase, I’d still be first in line to see it.\n\n★★★½\n\nThree Amigos Movie Review on Twitter\n\n99th Movie Watched in 2020:\n\nInto the Grizzly Maze\n\nWhat a waste of a good main and supporting cast with this uninspired script and second rate special effects. I don’t blame any of the actors, and lay this squarely on the director, who was obviously out of his depth. Watchable at best.\n\n★½\n\nInto the Grizzle Maze Movie Review on Twitter\n\n100th Movie Watched in 2020:\n\nThe Best of Enemies\n\nA feel-good true story about desegregation of schools in the south made possible by the unlikely pairing of a civil rights activist and a Klan member w/ a conscience. Sam Rockwell (easily one of the great, yet underrated actors of my generation) is amazing, as is an engrossing turn by Taraji P Henson as his equal on the other side is the aisle. Both actors elevate the film beyond the standard after-school-special treatment that most films about race seem to receive.

Sure, my love of this first film is an unpopular opinion in many circles, but it’s kid friendly and approachable by all ages. Almost no films are capable of matching the source material novels they sprung from, but this knows well enough to set the stage without overdoing it. Picturesque set design and impeccable casting for the future weaves a magical beginning. Wonderful storytelling put on celluloid.\n\n★★★★\n\nHarry Potter and the Philosopher’s Stone Movie Review on Twitter\n\n103rd Movie Watched in 2020:\n\nSelfie From Hell\n\nSelfie from Hell? More like movie from hell. This horror flick plays out more like a student production with ill-equipped actors and a disjointed script that offers no continuity in plot, no logical reasoning for the characters, and an outcome that offers no logical reasoning in why some things happen and some don’t. I wasted my time on this one.\n\n½\n\nSelfie from Hell Movie review on Twitter\n\n104th Movie Watched in 2020:\n\nHarry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets\n\nThe 2nd film in JK Rowling’s canon saw Harry Potter solidifying his base and beginning to understand his life’s charge. Definitely not as intriguing as the 1st, but they begin to raise the stakes with child danger. Adult characters thankfully start to become more integral in the battle between He Who Must Not Be Named and The Boy Who Lived. You can start to see the framework and patterns in the story – and I think that did Chris Columbus a bit of a disservice. Nonetheless, a good effort.\n\n★★★\n\nHarry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets Movie Review on Twitter\n\n105th Movie Watched in 2020:\n\nHarry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban\n\nThe attention to detail in the filmmaking speeds this 3rd Harry Potter film along. Alfonso Cuaron takes the helm and wisely takes a departure from the formula of the first two in order to build more interpersonal intrigue. Character development grows without the need for a boss battle against a big baddie In the end.

Realistic (yet slightly frustrating) performances by all kids stoke the creepy atmosphere. In the end, though, this movie breaks no new ground in the horror genre, delivering few scares at best. Good acting, decent directing, but some mildly creepy visuals actually pull you out of seems that should be more frightening.\n\n★★\n\nVeronica Movie Review on Twitter\n\n108th Movie Watched in 2020:\n\nHarry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix\n\nThe teenage wizards are taking their fight to the dark lord and death eaters in this 5th installment.

Each scene they’re in reminds you how great they are together. It puts their older selves at a disadvantage. While the casting of their grown-up versions is admirable, it took a while to begin caring at all about the adults. They’re good actors but don’t have that camaraderie or electricity the kids do.\n\nWhile Bill Hader is great in the comic relief role, it isn’t the jokes, but the clownish (pun intended) horror sequences and effects that take the viewer out of the creepy atmosphere and into a campy, silly send-up of a no-longer scary movie. Moreover, it lasts far too long with too many unnecessary sequences of perceived terror that are all for freak, but no fright.\n\n★★\n\nIt: Chapter Two Movie Review on Twitter\n\n110th Movie Watched in 2020:\n\nA LEGO Brickumentary\n\nConsidering how creative the toy brand has been in its existence, the documentary is pretty basic and uninventive.

Nonetheless, a smart and engaging concept of a multiple floor prison where food is distributed from top floor down, and it’s up to the inmates on each level to be mindful enough of those below. Decent acting throughout and a feeling of hopelessness pervades. Violent, desperate, and provocative.\n\n★★★\n\nThe Platform Movie Review on Twitter\n\n112th Movie Watched in 2020:\n\nLes Misérables\n\nNothing is as electric as a live stage performance. Especially one of a musical that I believe towers above all others. Still, Tom Hooper delivers direction that is admirable and the core cast’s acting is better than expected, even if their voices cant obviously match that of their stage counterparts. Long, in parts, where the stage keeps you enthralled, and small screen can’t.

Excruciatingly boring true story about 80’s Nicaraguan rebels being assisted by USA and the illogical journalist that gets mixed up in it.

Nonetheless, I find this to be an excellent denouement to JK Rowling’s boy wizard franchise. The journey of the beloved characters come to fitting conclusions, some happy, some sad. Certain characters’ motivations come full circle (beautifully written, and more importantly, acted). Wizardry on camera and off is at an all-time high.\n\nA magical ending. Grade A.\n\n★★★★\n\nHarry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 2 Movie Review on Twitter\n\nFollow me on Twitter\n\n121st Movie Watched in 2020:\n\nThey Came Together\n\nThis goofy, R-rated, slapstick send-up of romantic comedies directed by The State’s David Wain is absurdly funnier than I expected. Hilarious turns by the cast of characters and great cameos plus a script rife with humorous overkill. I laughed a lot, but admittedly my wife hated it.\n\n★★½\n\nThey Came Together Movie Review on Twitter\n\n122nd Movie Watched in 2020:\n\nAnaconda\n\nI hadn’t seen this since it was in the theaters, and time has not been kind to this giant killer snake campfest. The creature effects involving the snake and its attacks are frighteningly low-rent. So fake it’s sad-funny, not scary. J-Lo, I’ve Cube, and Eric Stoltz phone it in, while Voight vamps it up in this trashy excuse for entertainment.\n\n★\n\nAnaconda Movie Review on Twitter\n\n123rd Movie Watched in 2020:\n\nExtremely Wicked, Shockingly Evil and Vile\n\nFocusing more on the media coverage of the courtroom case (and his girlfriends) than on the gruesome murders he committed or his motivation, this film about Ted Bundy is still engrossing. Zac Efron is ideally cast as the killer. A mark was missed in the making of the film when the two women He has a relationship with yield al the screen time and his victims yield almost none.\n\n★★½\n\nExtremely Wicked, Shockingly Evil and Vile Movie Review on Twitter\n\n124th Movie Watched in 2020:\n\nFred 2: Night of the Living Fred\n\nLet it be known, this was not my pick. This is what happens when you let a YouTube star make a feature film. The most annoying sound in the world isn’t in Dumb and Dumber, it’s Fred’s high-pitched voice. Elementary attempt at humor = big thumbs down.\n\nFred 2: Night of the Living Fred Movie Review on Twitter\n\n125th Movie Watched in 2020:\n\nThe Wind\n\nThis creepy frontier horror film is big on atmosphere and skinny on dialogue. Considered a feminist gothic film, it is a bit artsy with a slow burn story and one really good scare. A tough, independent wife deals with an evil spirit, life on the prairie, and paranoia. Story is told from her viewpoint and out of chronological order which keeps you watching.\n\n★★\n\nThe Wind Movie Review on Twitter\n\n126th Movie Watched in 2020:\n\nThe Willoughbys\n\nA kid-friendly, silly animated movie w/ some darker themes and decent voice work. Selfish, neglectful parents treat their children with a Flowers-in-the-Attic vibe, but the siblings stick together as they try to become orphans. A few cute scenes but a little discombobulated.\n\n★★\n\nThe Willoughbys Movie Review on Twitter\n\n127th Movie Watched in 2020:\n\nExtraction\n\nWhiz-bang action sequences with quality gunplay and hand-to-hand combat, headlined by Chris Hemsworth. While he’s not the most emotive actor, few can keep up with his bravado and machismo. Long takes with limited cuts and choreographed violence, filmed quite a bit with shaky cam, keeps the blood pumping and forces an intense pace.\n\nReminiscent to Black Hawk Down in design where the characters are trapped behind enemy lines with the odds against them. Definitely a worthy Netflix watch.\n\n★★★½\n\nExtraction Movie Review on Twitter\n\n128th Movie Watched in 2020:\n\nTiger Tail\n\nSet in Tawain and America, this beautiful, soft-spoken foreign language film tells a story of love vs. obligation and captures the immigrant experience.

Miserable concept, script, effects, and acting. Jon Lovitz being Jon Lovitz was almost amusingly nostalgic. Attempts to be silly fail, and ends up just… dumb. For the most part, everything about this silly movie stinks.\n\n½\n\nMom and Dad Save the World Movie Review on Twitter\n\n130th Movie Watched in 2020:\n\nJacob’s Ladder (2019)\n\nI recall somewhat respecting the original Jacob’s Ladder, but not liking it. With this remake, I somewhat like it but don’t respect it. Similar premise as the 1990 film, but they give it away early and try to replace the mystery with a twist. More characters are added, and special effects improve, but still somehow make the film weaker. No longer psychologically haunting.\n\n★½\n\nJacob’s Ladder Movie Review on Twitter\n\nContact DealerKnows to convert more leads\n\n131st Movie Watched in 2020:\n\nDon’t F**k With Cats: Hunting an Internet Killer\n\nYes, it may be a 3 episode limited Netflix series but I’m reviewing it as a film as it’s only 3 hours. (Considering I still watch series, i’ll now include Limited Series in as movies). Those who read reviews know I don’t give out 5 stars easily – only a handful have ever received it. Don’t F**k With Cats deserves it. This was the best and most compelling true crime documentary I’ve ever seen. Details of the crimes and the internet sleuths’ hunt laid out chronologically added to the intrigue. Editing was incredible. Doubt I’ll ever forget it.\n\n★★★★★\n\nDon’t F**k With Cats Movie Review on Twitter\n\n132nd Movie Watched in 2020:\n\nDraft Day\n\nAn unpopular opinion: Draft Day is a top 5 all-time favorite sports film of mine (and this is probably my 10th viewing). Kevin Costner was put on this Earth to make sports movies and westerns, that’s it. Even though the subject matter shouldn’t be exciting, it somehow is. The split-screen transitions add much to the tempo of the action, and the storytelling is electric. Only reason this isn’t a perfect 5 stars across the board is a few of the interpersonal dynamics between people in the front office and family rings just a touch hollow. But this film is Super Bowl worthy in the pantheon of sports movies.\n\n★★★★½\n\nDraft Day Movie Review on Twitter\n\n133rd Movie Watched in 2020:\n\nLemony Snicket’s A Series of Unfortunate Events\n\nA great example of a family friendly fable blending together story and performances that works for parents & kids alike.

More introspective psychological drama than action thriller; it breaks standard tropes by not over explaining anything or accentuating violence.\n\n★★★\n\nYou Were Never Really Here Movie Review on Twitter\n\n135th Movie Watched in 2020:\n\nKrull\n\nUnderstand, the nostalgia I have for this 80’s fantasy flick is palpable. I loved this movie in my youth and I can confirm, now that it is in HD, it remains epic, despite dated special effects and creature work. Early Liam Neeson and Robbie Coltrane FTW! This movie, above most others, deserves a big budget yet artsy, carefully-directed remake.\n\n★★★\n\nKrull Movie Review on Twitter\n\n136th Movie Watched in 2020:\n\nThe Silence\n\nDespite the always amazing Stanley Tucci headlining, this just above b-movie knock-off of A Quiet Place frustrates instead of scares. In a world where creatures require you to be silent, why does an entire family that knows sign language insist on talking aloud?! Including the deaf daughter!\n\n★½\n\nThe Silence Movie Review on Twitter\n\n137th Movie Watched in 2020:\n\nAustin Powers: International Man of Mystery\n\nThis daffy spoof of British secret agents was hilarious when it first debuted, but it’s lost a little luster since. Some of the jokes may be out of style or dated, but enough of its sight gags hold up. Regardless, Mike Myers as Dr. Evil is universally funny. Dr. Evil and his son Scott are long overdue for a spin-off.\n\n★★★\n\nAustin Powers Movie Review on Twitter\n\n138th Movie Watched in 2020:\n\nTucker and Dave vs. Evil\n\nA genuinely funny romp wrapped around a horror movie premise. Flipping the slasher film stereotype of backwoods hillbillies vs college kids in the woods, in this case, the affable hillbillies are the good guys. A wacky spoof filled with belly-laugh moments.\n\n★★★½\n\nTucker and Dale vs. Evil Movie Review on Twitter\n\n139th Movie Watched in 2020:\n\nMajor Payne\n\nThe prototypical underdog story gets the setting of a group of misfits in a ROTC program competing for a prize.

As close to a perfect film as the last decade has made. Steve Carell brings both humor, vulnerability and heart to a role not seen since the days of John Candy. Every time I watch it, I’m brought to tears. No other movie can make me cry from laughter, from sadness, from joy, and from beauty, at separate times, all over the course of an hour and a half.

Plus… Heather Graham.\n\n★★★½\n\nAustin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me Movie Review on Twitter\n\n143rd Movie Watched in 2020:\n\nThe ‘Burbs\n\nAn underrated 80’s thriller comedy with solid turns by a quality cast, especially Tom Hanks and Bruce Durn. Director Joe Dante didn’t match his usual high marks, and the ending seemed rushed. The writing is the only thing that held this movie about suburban paranoia back.\n\n★★½\n\nThe ‘Burbs Movie Review on Twitter\n\n144th Movie Watched in 2020:\n\nGerald’s Game\n\nAnother unsettling Stephen King yarn. In the creepy vein of Misery, the majority of the movie takes place in one setting and a person stuck in a situation no one wants to be in. Gugino and Greenwood (two fine actors) do well, but it’s considerably slower than I prefer.\n\n★★½\n\nGerald’s Game Movie Review on Twitter\n\n145th Movie Watched in 2020:\n\nBad Education\n\nCorruption and greed upend a school district in this film based on a true story. At the heart of this movie exists two great performances. Allison Janney is terrific, tough, and broken, while Hugh Jackman gives a refreshing turn, playing both criminal and vulnerable. While the movie does a respectable job laying out the details and personal lives of the perpetrators, little attention is shared about the victims of this scandal. Due to this, the stakes aren’t explained enough to hit home. Worth the watch, but doesn’t pack an emotional punch.\n\n★★★\n\nBad Education Movie Review on Twitter\n\n146th Movie Watched in 2020:\n\nI Am Legend\n\nOne of the better post-apocalyptic movies, caused by a virus (how apropos). Will Smith plays the virologist soldier aiming to find the cure in a lonely world. Some good jump scares and emotional moments in this thriller. While creature effects aren’t perfect, camera work and a desolate Times Square is Erie.\n\n★★★★\n\nI Am Legend Movie Review on Twitter\n\n147th Movie Watched in 2020:\n\nMan on a Ledge\n\nPredictable thriller – an ex-cop convict risking his life to prove his innocence with an overly elaborate plan. Main actors Worthington and Banks don’t have the emotional depth needed for the gravity of the story but Ed Burns and Genesis Rodriguez hold their own.\n\n★★\n\nMan on a Ledge Movie Review on Twitter\n\n148th Movie Watched in 2020:\n\nRambo: Last Blood\n\nSylvester Stallone’s John Rambo is an iconic action hero. That aside, this standard revenge script doesn’t seem to be Rambo material. Could have been a standalone movie for any action person with a backstory and a penchant for blades and bows. It’s just a bloodbath of booby traps. However, our leading man is SO violent in his killings and death trap creations, he is like Jigsaw but with less panache. John Rambo appears to be nothing more than sadist with mental disorders. But if you like a lot of killing… this is your movie. Everything else about it is subpar, given the magnitude of the character’s canon.\n\n★★\n\nRambo: Last Blood Movie Review on Twitter\n\n149th Movie Watched in 2020:\n\nHow to Lose a Guy in 10 Days\n\nI’m not ashamed to say I enjoy romantic comedies, but trust me when I say rewatching this wasn’t by choice. A garden variety rom-com with a far-fetched set-up doesn’t fail from the concept, but from the utter lack of charisma in its leads.\n\n★★\n\nHow to Lose a Guy in 10 Days Movie Review on Twitter\n\n150th Movie Watched in 2020:\n\nReclaim\n\nI went in with low expectations and yet it surprisingly wasn’t unbearable, as much as John Cusack’s one-note acting tried to make it so. A remedial thriller with good intentions and a fresh take on child trafficking. Still, some major plot holes abound.\n\n★★\n\nReclaim Movie Review on Twitter\n\n151st Movie Watched in 2020:\n\nCats\n\n(Not the musical). Originally titled Cats and Peachtopia, this Chinese cartoon film (dubbed in English) doesn’t fail miserably because of the quality of its animation, but due to its unoriginal premise (an obvious rip-off of Finding Nemo). Executed so poorly I never smiled once during the entire movie.\n\n★\n\nCats Movie Review on Twitter\n\n152nd Movie Watched in 2020:\n\nMy Dog Skip\n\nA heartwarming coming of age story about a boy and his dog in a small town in the 1940’s.

Short Round makes it interesting, an evil baddie makes it dangerous, but Kate Capshaw as the damsel in distress makes it annoying. Thankfully, Act III brings it back to respectability with a few quality action sequences, one involving a rope bridge – that I always felt was a highlight of the series.\n\n★★★\n\nIndiana Jones and the Temple of Doom Movie Review on Twitter\n\n155th Movie Watched in 2020:\n\nIndiana Jones and the Last Crusade\n\nMy personal favorite among the films in this franchise. The action is steady from the start (w/ a flashback that adds character depth) to the end. Momentum never stops. Moreover, this is the best storyline and artifact of the series. Plus, Connery brings a fun element to the team, raising the stakes for the Jones family.\n\n★★★★★\n\nIndiana Jones and the Last Crusade Movie Review on Twitter\n\n156th Movie Watched in 2020:\n\nI See You\n\nConsiderably better psychological thriller than I was expecting.

Not scary at all, but a fulfilling watch thanks to a solid concept and story.\n\n★★★★\n\nI See You Movie Review on Twitter\n\n157th Movie Watched in 2020:\n\nHoly Rollers\n\nThis cautionary tale of a Hasidic man lured into being a drug mule is interesting, but not enthralling. Based on a true story, it definitely provides peek behind the curtain of Orthodox Jewish culture. It’s filmed in a muted color filter, taking away the vibrancy of what transpires on screen, in an effort to parallel how religion and drugs can dull the senses.\n\n★★\n\nHoly Rollers Movie Review on Twitter\n\n158th Movie Watched in 2020:\n\nIndiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull\n\nIt’s not that the 4th installment of everyone’s favorite archeologist is bad, per se, as the artifact they seek is intriguing, and it’s nice seeing a family reunite, even if adding in a few new roles is frustrating.

The most annoying character to ever be on television (and that includes Regis Philbin).

Worst.)\n\n½ (I’d give zero stars if possible)\n\nFred: The Movie Review on Twitter\n\n162nd Movie Watched in 2020:\n\nDangerous Lies\n\nA predictable thriller, yet I appreciate the attempt to make a mystery that tackles adult themes without requiring it to be R-rated. Nonetheless, this is one of those movies where you’ll get frustrated watching because you disagree with or don’t understand any characters’ motivation or decision-making. It’s a yell-at-the-screen-because-the characters-are-stupid, type of movie. Not the actors’ fault, but the writer’s.\n\n★★\n\nDangerous Lies Movie Review on Twitter\n\n163rd Movie Watched in 2020:\n\nOnce Upon a Time… in Hollywood\n\nI find this film to be the epitome of cool. Easily one of Quentin’s best directing efforts. Tarantino captured old Hollywood elan (and even Italian cinema) so well, he could have respectfully taken best director. Why does Once Upon a Time in Hollywood ranked as one of Tarantino’s best efforts? Quentin is always great at making iconic scenes in movies, but the sum of those scenes don’t always come together into cohesive movies. (If you look closely, most of the great scenes in his movie involve interrogations of one character from another. While they still have flourishes I’d those scenes in this, there are brandishes of restraint where dialogue becomes dialogue, rather than a competition. The finished product was a stylish culmination of script and cool. He absolutely nailed it. Adding on… Shot composition was incredible and he didn’t rush the story in the editing booth.\n\nFrom an acting perspective, Brad Pitt flashed an Alpha male machismo perfect for the role, but didn’t disappear into it. You just felt like you were watching the most confident guy in Hollywood. I feel if anyone deserved an acting nomination, it was DiCaprio. He BECAME Rick Dalton. He portrayed a struggling actor looking for a splash of esteem brilliantly (and that’s knowing Leo never has had to suffer with those same concerns since he has been on fire for 20 years).Both actors were tremendous. Nonetheless, I love this film. It’s not perfect, but the ending was close to it.

Even back in the mid-90’s I recalled thinking some of the jokes were from the mid-80’s.

Sigourney Weaver will always be my 1st female action star\n\n★★★★\n\nAlien Movie Review on Twitter\n\n168th Movie Watched in 2020:\n\nGood Time\n\nA respectable (and realistic) turn by Robert Pattinson in this story about a situation spiraling out of control. Another cautionary tale about how one crime can have a compounding effect, constantly digging a deeper hole for the criminal. Actions get frustrating, and the helplessness of the main character’s mentally-handicapped brother isn’t portrayed as sufficiently as I’d like, but a gritty film nonetheless.\n\n★★½\n\nGood Time Movie Review on Twitter\n\n169th Movie Watched in 2020:\n\nDon’t Think Twice\n\nGreat example of what it’s like to be in an improv troupe. I doubt I’d have liked it as much without my history in improv and sketch comedy, but much of the trial and tribulations of the players hits home. (After watching this, I’m thankful it never got to this high stakes of “make it or break it” as a performer. They represent the standard seasoned troupe – the unwavering support and hints of competitiveness. The love for one another and the jealousy. Like every improv show I’ve ever performed or watched, this movie is filled with highs and lows, but it has a worthy cast that doesn’t make it about the humor but about the journey of the characters.\n\n★★★½\n\nDon’t Think Twice Movie Review on Twitter\n\n170th Movie Watched in 2020:\n\nAliens (Director’s Cut)\n\nMy favorite sci-fi film of all time. I know it doesn’t have the existential dread or deep thoughts that 2001 or Interstellar has, but this has always been a blood-pumping good time. Director’s Cut added a lot of context and exposition I felt should have been in the original release. James Cameron crafted two of the great sequels of my life, and this bested the original Alien in my book. Sigourney Weaver (and that iconic head tilt!) will forever be the greatest action heroine (heck, hero) because of this film. James Horner on music/sound delivered iconic work and the creature and visual effects were top-notch.

I have gone down enough of the “choose your own adventure” style paths to determine there is very little quality humor here. The sitcom is filled with brilliant one-liners but this is barren of them. A few good jokes land during the course of the entire films. That’s it. And even those can’t overcome the wildly uneven script and interactive format. This didn’t need to be made, other than the give Kimmy an ending that she would be proud of (provided your choose correctly.)\n\n★\n\nUnbreakable Kimmy Schmidt Movie Review on Twitter\n\n172nd Movie Watched in 2020:\n\nCity of Ember\n\nAn accessible, kid-friendly fantasy film with a good enough premise to keep adults and children interested throughout. Filled with Machiavellian leaders, an underground society of survivors who’ve forgotten about the world, teenage protagonists. Just missing more backstory & depth – which is funny given it takes place beneath the surface.

(And NOT in a good way). There is a lot wrong here. The stunted dialogue, generic roles, rigid acting, stupid violence, and lousy tempo all make watching this a burden.

Sure, some of the dubbed audio isn’t perfect, nor is the fight choreography or acting, but dang it, the nostalgia came roaring back when I saw Marc Singer and Tanya Roberts embrace. I also miss the days when real animals are used in films.

Art-house film fans may love the sterile nature of the dialogue and relationships within, but I feel it’s lacking because of that. The movie is well made, but I am still mad at it for a multitude of reasons. Mainly because it answers the why but not the how. The primary mystery in the movie receives zero consideration.

Better than the SNL skits of which it is based, but not exceptionally entertaining 25 years later.\n\n★½\n\nConeheads Movie Review on Twitter\n\nFollow me on Letterboxd\n\n181st Movie Watched in 2020:\n\nA Monster’s Call\n\nA fantastical allegory about grief and loss among a boy, his sick mom, and a mystical tree. Incredible acting across the board, especially by the young boy. J.A. Bayona delivered a heart-wrenching yet beautiful tale with tremendous special effects.\n\n★★★½\n\nA Monster’s Calls Movie Review on Twitter\n\n182nd Movie Watched in 2020:\n\nThe Lovebirds\n\nThere’s a fine line between bantering and bickering, but this movie thankfully lands on the former. While this is another unrealistic set-up of dumb choices getting a cute couple in hot water, Issa Rae and Kumail Nanjiana’s chemistry (and delivery) make the film enjoyable (though not noteworthy).\n\n★★½\n\nThe Lovebirds Movie Review on Twitter\n\n183rd Movie Watched in 2020:\n\nCircle\n\nFor a sci-fi movie high on premise and weak on execution, it surprisingly kept me enthralled. It’s like a highest stakes evil game of Survivor, where Darwinism trumps decency. Where snap judgments and mental game-play lead to survival or death. Some great moral questions were asked, but not properly addressed.\n\n★★½\n\nCircle Movie Review on Twitter\n\n184th Movie Watched in 2020:\n\nBig Fat Liar\n\nA cute enough kids movie where the big bad adult gets what’s coming to him through pranks put in place by teenagers. Paul Giamatti is always game for this type of role and, while I’m not the target audience, it had my son laughing.\n\n★★\n\nBig Fat Liar Movie Review on Twitter\n\n185th Movie Watched in 2020:\n\nThe Decline\n\n(also known as Jusqu’au déclin)\n\nThis French Canadian film about a fatality at a survivalist camp has a few small surprises, but plays out the way you want. Not near enough character development to care for the characters, but enough emotion to stay watching. It’s somehow a slow movie that plays fast.\n\n★★★\n\nThe Decline Movie Review on Twitter\n\n186th Movie Watched in 2020:\n\nCome to Daddy\n\nI knew absolutely nothing about this movie going in, but it’s a weird dark comedy thriller that offers quality surprises and an all-in effort by Elijah Wood. Some unexpected gonzo violent scenes make it both fun and sad all at once.\n\n★★★½\n\nCome to Daddy Movie Review on Twitter\n\n187th Movie Watched in 2020:\n\nFrom Beijing With Love\n\nI’m a huge fan of Stephen Chow’s “Shaolin Soccer” and “Kung Fu Hustle”, and I Love Chinese cinema so I had high hopes. This is nothing like those. No real effects, and much of the humor in this spoof on spy movies is agonizingly basic. Jokes fell flat, only a couple chuckles, and almost painful to get through. Bad.\n\n★\n\nFrom Beijing With Love Movie Review on Twitter\n\n188th Movie Watched in 2020:\n\nThe Darkest Minds\n\nI’ll say, while I’m sure the critics aren’t fans of this supernatural YA flick, I enjoyed the premise. Obviously springing from a book as source material, I can completely see this being a franchise, and the lead actress has chops. Pretty standard young adult fare, but I would keep watching sequels.\n\n★★★\n\nThe Darkest Minds Movie Review on Twitter\n\n189th Movie Watched in 2020:\n\nSecret Obsession\n\nThis easily could have been a Lifetime Movie given how clichéd this thriller is. Lousy script has “clues” as subtle as jackhammers. I called the “twist” in the first 3 minutes of the movie. Dennis Haysbert deserves better. About as unsurprising and conventional as a movie can get.\n\n★½\n\nSecret Obsession Movie Review on Twitter\n\n190th Movie Watched in 2020:\n\nDumbo\n\nSome way some how Tim Burton (a director gifted at making movies of oddities, giving them vision and heart) found a way to create a live action remake of the animated Disney classic with zero magic. Sad, considering the likable cast did a valiant effort to their roles, but all of the whimsical nature of the original flew away. He made seeing a flying elephant… tedious.\n\n★★\n\nDumbo Movie Review on Twitter\n\nWhat is your TaskTeacher grade? Find out now.\n\n191st Movie Watched in 2020:\n\nThe Matrix Reloaded\n\nI always felt this sequel to the genre-redefining action behemoth was good, but failed because it wasn’t great enough to WOW the audience. Yet, pound for pound, they upped the ante with better choreographed action sequences. Stakes were raised by bringing even more danger underground and pushing the messiah concept. Yet the over abundance of explanatory dialogue made this drab in parts.\n\n★★★½\n\nThe Matrix Reloaded Movie Review on Twitter\n\n192nd Movie Watched in 2020:\n\nRattlesnake\n\nNot my normal review: I get frustrated with characters that make stupid decisions or lack poor motivation. If the Devil tells you your child dies unless you kill someone before sunset, you act on it quickly. You don’t hem and haw while wasting countless chances. Idiotic.\n\n★½\n\nRattlesnake Movie Review on Twitter\n\n193rd Movie Watched in 2020:\n\nThe Hustle\n\nThis female-centric remake of the classic Dirty Rotten Scoundrels didn’t do an adequate enough job deviating from the source material to make it special. Anne Hathaway is typically a delight, but she seems hamstrung by an uninspired script. Lackluster comedy with none of the charm of laughs from the original. Aim higher.\n\n★★\n\nThe Hustle Movie Review on Twitter\n\n194th Movie Watched in 2020:\n\nThe Matrix Revolutions\n\nThe Wachowski Brothers put ALL the effects they could to finish up the trilogy, (too much at times), and leaned heavy on the Christlike comparison with our hero. A good (yet erratic) film but probably overthought the finale.\n\n★★★\n\nThe Matrix Revolutions Movie Review on Twitter\n\n195th Movie Watched in 2020:\n\nThe Occupant\n\nThis psychological thriller from Spain made my wife mad but surprisingly pleased me. It demonstrates how a middle aged man descends into emotional instability because he is no longer professionally viable. I appreciate how it unfolded.\n\n★★★\n\nThe Occupant Movie Review on Twitter\n\n196th Movie Watched in 2020:\n\nKill Bill: Vol. 1\n\nWhile not the most complete film, this is Quentin Tarantino’s best work. Yes, that’s what I said, despite the effusive praise I laid upon Once Upon a Time… in Hollywood. So many directing styles are explored in this thrill-ride, the movie cannot be overlooked. Incredible filmmaking, a legendary fight scene, a tour de force performance by Uma Thurman, and brilliant use of music and sound. Stylized and bold storytelling that cannot be overlooked.\n\n★★★★★\n\nKill Bill: Vol. 1 Movie Review on Twitter\n\n197th Movie Watched in 2020:\n\nMaleficent\n\nThis fantastical Disney sequel bests its predecessor, and I’m surprised by how good it is. One of those great instances where going in expecting little pays off when it exceeds your expectations. The story (and Michelle Pfeiffer as the villain) are gratifying and scene-chewing in February best respective ways. Effects are top-notch. And as odd as it sounds, Angelina Jolie is born to play Maleficent. It absolutely is her best role.\n\n★★★★\n\nMaleficent Movie Review on Twitter\n\n198th Movie Watched in 2020:\n\nLife of Crime\n\nIs it possible to have a good-natured dark comedy crime movie? Adapted from Elmore Leonard’s “The Switch”, it has witty characters and charm, for what is a quality B-movie with Jennifer Anniston and Tim Robbins. Endearing crime flick.\n\n★★★\n\nLife of Crime Movie Review on Twitter\n\n199th Movie Watched in 2020:\n\nDonnybrook\n\nA distressful tale with no backstory, and no reason to care for the deplorable characters. Yet somehow still makes you feel sick to your stomach seeing a tragic example of how poverty, drugs, violence, and nihilism affects middle America.\n\nA few stunning images and one sadistic, sad, sexual murder scene that took me by surprise still doesn’t override the abusive soundtrack and despondent path of its players.\n\n★½\n\nDonnybrook Movie Review on Twitter\n\n200th Movie Watched in 2020:\n\nIntuition (La Corazonada)\n\nThis Argentinian film is a meandering and slightly convoluted detective mystery filled with clichés (rogue cops, countless murders, red herrings, and multiple players), none of which gets you interested in solving.\n\n★½\n\nIntuition Movie Review on Twitter\n\nGet to know Joe Webb\n\n201st Movie Watched in 2020:\n\nThe Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring\n\nAn incredible start to a perilous journey – one of the great adaptations of book to screen in the fantasy genre. Peter Jackson had such a strong vision for the trilogy, he pulled it off with aplomb. Wondrous effects. A grand vision. A perfect cast.\n\n★★★★½\n\nThe Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring Movie Review on Twitter\n\n202nd Movie Watched in 2020:\n\nHush\n\nA run-of-the-mill home invasion slasher that still works to make the viewer happy. A lot of foreshadowing occurs that fans of horror flicks will pick up on immediately, but the mute deaf female protagonist and her creepy antagonist are noteworthy.\n\n★★½\n\nHush Movie Review on Twitter\n\n203rd Movie Watched in 2020:\n\nPerdida\n\nJust above average detective fare, this Argentinian film is about a cold case too personal foe the detective to let go. Second film I’ve watched based on the character Pipa, and I could watch Luisana Lopilato play cop all day. She has chops.\n\n★★★\n\nPerdida Movie Review on Twitter\n\n204th Movie Watched in 2020:\n\nThe Invisible Man\n\nEven with this thriller’s concept of “Sleeping with the Enemy” meets “Invisible Man”, the tricks up the sleeve are enough to keep blood pumping. A solid and worthy mash-up and addition to the thriller/horror genre. Nothing that makes you jump, but a good story. What makes it work is Elisabeth Moss’ tremendous acting. Believably disturbed and haunted.\n\n★★★½\n\nThe Invisible Man Movie Review on Twitter\n\n205th Movie Watched in 2020:\n\nGood Will Hunting\n\nAfter each and every watch, this continues to be a top 20 favorite movie of mine. Writing is superb. Gus Van Sant was considerate and careful in the directing. The true champion of this film was the incredible acting from each actor (every single one), especially Robin Williams. He disappeared into his role and gave a movie about someone’s brain all the heart it needed to be a phenomenal film.\n\n★★★★★\n\nGood Will Hunting Movie Review on Twitter\n\n206th Movie Watched in 2020:\n\nThe Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers\n\nThe second film in the LOTR Tolkien trilogy is the best, in my opinion. Groundbreaking in its effects, scale, and scope; held together by quintessential elements of friendship, duty, honor, betrayal and love.\n\n★★★★½\n\nThe Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers Movie Review on Twitter\n\n207th Movie Watched in 2020:\n\nThe Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King\n\nThe epic culmination of the LOTR franchise is tremendous in spectacle and effects. All credit is owed to the cast and, most specifically, the monumental vision of director Peter Jackson. A saga for the ages.\n\n★★★★½\n\nThe Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King\n\n208th Movie Watched in 2020:\n\nMercy\n\nAny credit this movie receives goes to its writing. What started out as a basic, predictable thriller in the first half ends up anything but, thanks to the time-reconstruction from different characters’ viewpoints and some interesting twists. The acting and direction is nothing noteworthy, but some surprises along the way will make you appreciate the journey.\n\n★★½\n\nMercy Movie Review on Twitter\n\n209th Movie Watched in 2020:\n\nCrocodile Dundee\n\nAlways enjoyed the simplicity of this genial romantic comedy of two people finding love in the most unexpected of places.\n\nThe movie works because of 2 elements:\n\n1) The (real life) chemistry between the 2 stars\n\n2) Paul Hogan’s charm and magnetism\n\n★★★½\n\nCrocodile Dundee Movie Review on Twitter\n\n210th Movie Watched in 2020:\n\nUncut Gems\n\nCan a movie give you an anxiety attack? I can’t recall a more nerve-wracking, hectic movie. Adam Sandler doesn’t disappoint (regardless how angry he makes you) and deserved the buzz he garnered for his performance. A few of my friends hated the movie and I can only surmise its because of the sheer frustration the pace and plot exudes, but I appreciated the movie for that very thing. I was a nervous wreck.\n\n★★★★\n\nUncut Gems Movie Review on Twitter\n\nStop missing sales opportunities. Contact DealerKnows.\n\n211th Movie Watched in 2020:\n\nBrawl in Cell Block 99\n\nVince Vaughn plays an almost unnaturally strong bruiser who can slide from conscientious to cold-blooded in seconds, able to hurt people at will, as he traverses the prison system to protect his family. Gratuitously violent, Vaughn’s stone-faced wrecking ball fights for the other reasons, but makes a lot of the film play a little too easy. If you like graphic acts of random violence, this may peak your interest. If not, it may upset you.\n\n★★½\n\nBrawl in Cell Block 99 Movie Review on Twitter\n\n212th Movie Watched in 2020:\n\nOur House\n\nA middling supernatural ghost story, one that follows typical fright film clichés with images appearing in the background when characters aren’t looking and family that doesn’t tell each other what they’re seeing soon enough. Run of the mill (some would say lackluster plot) w/ relationships between siblings and significant others that aren’t believable in the slightest.\n\n★½\n\nOur House Movie Review on Twitter\n\n213th Movie Watched in 2020:\n\nCrocodile Dundee II\n\nThe moxie Paul Hogan so deftly exudes in the original is on full display in the sequel as the franchise flips from fish out of tale love story to far-fetched adventure. May not have the emotional gravitas if the original, but the chemistry between stars is strong as ever, and the story even more fun!\n\n★★★½\n\nCrocodile Dundee II Movie Review on Twitter\n\n214th Movie Watched in 2020:\n\nJohn Wick: Chapter 2\n\nAt this point I’ve seen each John Wick movie about a dozen times each. They don’t get old. Even with all the gun-fu and some nice touches in the script expanding the mythology, Keanu doesn’t seem to be as passionate in this one. I just like my assassins to enjoy themselves a bit more. While the body count increases 10 fold, it gets a bit repetitive.\n\n★★★½\n\nJohn Wick: Chapter 2 Movie Review on Twitter\n\n215th Movie Watched in 2020:\n\nThe Mummy\n\nI’m a sucker for historian adventure films steeped in mythology or legend. The Mummy is the epitome of an entertaining, summertime popcorn flick. Look past the wooden acting by Brendan Fraser, it has likable heroes, big sets, CGI action, a big baddie, and is fun for the whole family.\n\n★★★½\n\nThe Mummy Movie Review on Twitter\n\n216th Movie Watched in 2020:\n\nWillow\n\nWhile it may not live up to the grandeur of other fantasy films, I always felt this was underrated and got a bad wrap. It’s enchanting enough with memorable characters and action sequences. Moreover, it’s great casting helps celebrate the heroism of little people, who have long been underrepresented in cinema.\n\n★★★\n\nWillow Movie Review on Twitter\n\n217th Movie Watched in 2020:\n\nThe Last Days of American Crime\n\nStandard “criminal with a conscience operating by a code” fare, but surrounded by an inventive premise and a kooky accomplice. Good enough to keep your attention but gives you no real heist thrills. It has got a real ‘True Romance’ vibe, but with none of the snappy dialogue.\n\n★★½\n\nThe Last Days of American Crime Movie Review on Twitter\n\n218th Movie Watched in 2020:\n\nDrillbit Taylor\n\nWhile cycling through potential family fare to watch, we stumbled upon this laughless, lifeless number starring Owen Wilson (or, “he who should no longer be employed”) as a hobo helping kids stand up for themselves.
