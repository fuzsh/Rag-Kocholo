        "text": "Perhaps the pioneer of body horror, the king of the grisly image, Herschell Gordon Lewis took horror movies to the next level in the 1960s. At a time when horror movies were mostly bloodless, Lewis made them grotesquely graphic.\n\nNow you can watch some of his classic films on Tubi for free.\n\nLewis died in 2016 but left behind several films that range from sexploitation to splatter. He, like John Waters and Lloyd Kaufman, was a master of the B movie, working with unconventional screenplays and generating lower-than-low-budgeted movies, some now held in high regard as cult classics.\n\nLewis was especially apt at brutalizing women in some of his films. Although the gore is gratuitous, it wasn’t believable, but the ideas were insane. For instance Two Thousand Maniacs! showcased brutal vengeful hillbillies still angry at the fall of the old south, trapping and torturing tourists who venture into their small town. Lewis says this is one of his personal favorites. It’s basically a horror version of Brigadoon.\n\nTo understand the influence Lewis has on modern filmmaking you have take a look at his works. Luckily Tubi has several of them. We have listed them below, but the first three are perhaps the most popular within his extreme gore period.\n\nTwo Thousand Maniacs! (1964)\n\nNorthern tourists to a small Southern town are confronted by maniacal Confederates still angry about the outcome of the American Civil War. Interesting contraptions not dissimilar to the ideas in Saw are used to dispatch victims in brutal ways. This one is considered to be the apex of hicksploitation films. The Hills Have Eyes, Wrong Turn, and even The Texas Chainsaw Massacre owe a little credit to this cult classic. Bonus: a remake starring Robert Englund was directed by Tim Sullivan and released in 2005.\n\nThe Wizard of Gore (1970)\n\nA magician named Montag does horrific close-up magic for his audiences. His acts use sharp objects to seemingly dismember female volunteers who walk away from the gags unscathed only to find their true demise in a similar way after they get home. This one is known for its human disembowelment by chainsaw, a tool that would do similar damage four years later in Tobe Hooper’s iconic film The Texas Chainsaw Massacre.\n\nBlood Feast (1963)\n\nInspired, but dismayed by the lack of gore in Alfred Hitchcock’s Psycho, Lewis made Blood Feast. So brutal is the film that it made it on the list of the United Kingdom’s banned titles, affectionately known as a “video nasty.” The antagonist, the machete-wielding Fuad Ramses (Mal Arnold), feels like the prototype for Jason Voorhees in the Friday the 13th franchise. On a budget of $24,000, Lewis managed to pocket over $4 million after the success of this film.\n\nHerschell Gordon Lewis’ BloodMania (2015)\n\nThis is Lewis’ final film, a collaboration with directors Kevin Littlelight and James Saito. Probably not the magnum opus we were hoping for from the iconic filmmaker, it’s still fun to see how he handles modern horror cinema. Spoiler: the celluloid may be better, but his technique remains the same.\n\nHere is a list of other Herschell Gordon Lewis movies now streaming on Tubi:\n\nScum of the Earth (1963)\n\nMoonshine Mountain (1964)\n\nSomething Weird (1967)\n\nJust for the Hell of It (1968)\n\nHow to Make a Doll (1968)\n\nShe Devils on Wheels (1968)\n\n'Alien:Romulus' Theater Merch Unboxing\n\nAKA: Adult Happy Meals\n\nCan you believe it’s been 21 years since Freddy threw down with Jason? The jury is still out on who won.\n\nThis was the last film in which Robert Englund appeared in makeup as Freddy. It’s unclear when or if Freddy will return to a mainstream film, as there is some debate in the surviving Craven household regarding the character’s copyright. Wes Craven directed the first A Nightmare on Elm Street in 1984.\n\nPitting famous movie monsters against each other in crossover battles isn’t a new concept. Universal embraced this idea and began doing it back in the 1940s with their own IPs. As is the case with Freddy vs. Jason, the films usually had open endings or no clear winner, since everyone has their favorite and doesn’t want them to lose.\n\nInteresting fact about Freddy vs. Jason: James Wan was supposed to direct, but he chose to make Saw instead.\n\nBelow, we have listed some great horror movie (sci-fi) battle films, starting with the birthday boys themselves. These films range from the biggest budgets to the lowest, but all are a great time.\n\nIf you want to check any of them out, go over to JustWatch and search for the title to find your preferred medium.\n\nFreddy vs. Jason (2003)\n\nFreddy Krueger and Jason Voorhees return to terrorize the teenagers of Elm Street. Only this time, they’re out to get each other, too.\n\nAlien vs. Predator (2004)\n\nDuring an archaeological expedition on Bouvetøya Island in Antarctica, a team of archaeologists and other scientists find themselves caught up in a battle between the two legends. Soon, the team realize that only one species can win.\n\nGodzilla vs. Kong (2021)\n\nLegends collide as Godzilla and Kong, the two most powerful forces of nature, clash on the big screen in a spectacular battle for the ages. As a squadron embarks on a perilous mission into fantastic uncharted terrain, unearthing clues to the Titans’ very origins and mankind’s survival, a conspiracy threatens to wipe the creatures, both good and bad, from the face of the earth forever.\n\nDracula vs Frankenstein (1971)\n\nDracula conspires with a mad doctor to resurrect the Frankenstein Monster.\n\nDollman vs. Demonic Toys (1993)\n\nJudith Grey teams with Brick Bardo (Dollman) and his girlfriend Ginger to face the evil Demonic Toys for one final battle.\n\nDinocroc vs Supergator (2010 – TV movie)\n\nCreated in the laboratories of a biotech corporation, two ravenous mega-reptiles level everything in their way. Now, three defenders must try to save the day. Who shall live and who shall die in the battle between Dinocroc and Supergator?\n\nVersus Films: End of an Era or a Fresh Start?\n\nVersus films, where iconic characters face off in epic battles, have always been a fan favorite, but they are becoming increasingly difficult to produce. Legal complexities and character rights often stand in the way, even though audiences love watching these epic showdowns.\n\nHowever, with classic characters entering the public domain, a new era of versus films is emerging. One of the most anticipated versus films is Mickey vs. Winnie in the upcoming horror film MVW, scheduled for release in 2025.\n\nThis film marks the beginning of a new evolution in versus movies, where beloved childhood icons are transformed into nightmarish adversaries in a terrifying battle that will captivate and horrify audiences. The synopsis teases a chilling confrontation in a cursed forest, where innocence and evil collide in a bloody showdown.\n\nHere is a further description of the Mickey Vs Winnie horror film MVW:\n\n“A century ago, two convicts disappeared into Hell Forest, a place feared for its dark legends and whispers of a sinister curse. The mysterious force lurking within the forest feeds on those who dare to enter.\n\nIn the present day, a group of ex-wilderness reform school survivalists, reunited and bound by a shared history of trauma and rebellion, travels back to their abandoned disciplinary teen camp, nestled at the forest’s edge. The desolate school stands as a decaying symbol of their lost innocence, its walls echoing with secrets and forgotten horrors.\n\nAs they step into the eerie corridors of the school and the shadowy depths of Hell Forest, they unknowingly stir the curse that has lain dormant for generations. The school’s long-buried malevolence intertwines with the forest’s ancient evil, feeding off the ex-troubled teens’—now in their 30s—hidden fears and desires, manifesting as two monstrous figures: Dark Mickey and Dark Winnie, once cherished childhood icons now twisted into grotesque nightmares.\n\nThese twisted incarnations, born from the curse and the group’s own inner demons, become locked in a vicious battle. The hellish energy that transformed innocence into horror now seeks to consume the survivalists, forcing them to confront not only the nightmarish creatures but also the dark secrets from their teen years at Camp Misery Bay Reform School.”\n\n'Alien:Romulus' Theater Merch Unboxing\n\nAKA: Adult Happy Meals\n\nNot all movie studios put a large part of their budgets into promotions. Movies such as Longlegs, Smile, and Alien: Romulus have allowed their hype departments to do crazy things like put paid actors in public or create Insta-worthy situations, or create social media posts that are so interesting they go viral.\n\nOther productions merely put out a trailer and a few images via press releases and hope the title can speak for itself. Below are some films yet to come in 2024 that you may not know about, and some you do, but they may have fallen off the radar either because they are hyped too soon or simply don’t have the budget for an expansive publicity campaign.\n\nEither way, we are here to whisper in your ear about them because we believe most horror films deserve a chance and the filmmaker’s hard work should be recognized.\n\nAzrael (September 5)\n\nIn a world no one speaks a devout female hunts down a young woman who has escaped her imprisonment. Recaptured by its ruthless leaders, Azrael is due to be sacrificed to pacify an ancient evil deep within the surrounding wilderness\n\nAfrAId (August 30)\n\nThe Curtis’ family is selected to test a new home device: a digital assistant called AIA. AIA learns the family’s behaviors and begins to anticipate their needs. And she can make sure nothing – and no one – gets in her family’s way.\n\nBagman (September 20)\n\nWhen a sinister threat from his childhood returns to haunt him, a father desperately struggles against his deepest inner fear. Only this time, the fight isn’t for himself; it’s for his family.\n\nNever Let Go (September 27)\n\nA family that has been haunted by an evil spirit for years.

It’s since been spun-off and rebooted.\n\nTeam leaders Jason Hawes and Grant Wilson were plumbers who moonlighted as paranormal investigators and subsequently won our hearts as trustworthy and thorough sleuths even going so far as to debunk their own evidence.\n\nAll shows after this one tried to emulate the concept; some were better than others.\n\nKindred Spirits\n\nIf these two paranormal investigators have anything it’s chemistry. Amy Bruni and Adam Berry help people rid their homes of ghost infestations with the help of psychic medium Chip Coffey.\n\nTheir investigations are always entertaining and in their seven seasons on air they have managed to gather some intriguing evidence.\n\nMost Terrifying Places in America\n\nThis documentary series shines some light on America’s most haunted landmarks with testimonies from proprietors and staff.\n\nNot as in-depth as its reality show cousins but if anything it will add to your bucket list of locations to visit if you’re an enthusiast.\n\nParanormal Lockdown\n\nThis is probably the most terrifying show of its type. Nick Groff and Katrina Weidman visit haunted locations where they spend 72 secluded hours together looking for ghostly evidence. It’s revealed that Groff is especially sensitive to evil spirits that wreak havoc on his mental health.\n\nIt’s got everything others of its kind have except high production values and that only adds to its claustrophobic atmosphere.\n\nHaunted Down Under\n\nThis Australian reality show may be low on production values but it’s big on scares. This all-female-led team of cool paranormal investigators search the land down under for video evidence of the afterlife. It’s derivative, but the personalities of its hosts, Nadine, Caitlin, Hailey, and Celine, and their captured findings are truly entertaining.\n\nCelebrity Ghost Stories\n\nIt appears that the Hollywood elite also experience paranormal activity and they aren’t shy about it.\n\nThe premise is simple have stars such as Joan Rivers, Ice-T, or Sammy Hagar sit in a chair and talk about their experiences intertwined with re-enacted footage of their encounters.\n\nIt’s a simple but effective premise.\n\nTrending Fear\n\nEver since journalist Adam Ellis told his personal ghost story to millions of people on Twitter it inspired others to do the same on other social media platforms like TikTok.\n\nEllis visits the people who make these online claims to assist them with their noncorporeal problems while understanding his own in the process. It’s schlocky but it makes for great and interesting ghost stories on a dark and stormy night.\n\n'Alien:Romulus' Theater Merch Unboxing\n\nAKA: Adult Happy Meals"
