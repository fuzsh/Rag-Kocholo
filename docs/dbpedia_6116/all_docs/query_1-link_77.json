        "text": "MC and crew aren't evil. Not perfect, not by a long stretch, but they try.\n\nMC is a great balance. He is good at noticing his flaws, but he struggles to figure out what to do about his flaws. This applies to both social interactions, and trying to fight with his \"blessing\".\n\nSo far the authors biggest flaw is a poor description of choreography, scale, and distances. I can piece together how the imaginative fight went down after the fact, but it doesnt flow well enough for me to follow allong during the scene.\n\nFight choreography is a difficult skill that takes practice. Other stories i enjoy, including Salvos, steadily improved over time.\n\nThe best choreography ive ever read is Shadow Of The Conqueror, by Shad Brooks aka Shadiversity, a sword/dragon/castle youtuber. His fights had a lot of setup. By the time a fight even started, the personality, most abilities, scenery, and fighting style had been seamlessly established by normal interactions. This let the actual fights be extremely complex with minimal exposition, as the reader already had a firm vision of the surroundings and physics involved.\n\nNow, i dont recommening getting THAT ambitious. Start slow and small. Have the characters interact with scenery to bring it into the foreground. Have Brutus demonstrate the scale of distances by running until he looks small, demonstrate the scale of brutus when he shoulder checks a horse, demonstrate the size of a fighting ring by having Alex practice his dance inside it, etc.\n\nLastly, the main appeal here is the dialogue, internal monologue, problem solving, and magic building. Dont neglect those, fights are cool but only 10% of a story. The trick is to sneakily weave the buildup and choreography Into mundane interactions to set up the fights later. You already did that a bit for the mana vampire (which is why that fight was way better than the traveller finale).\n\nThe story is a welcome refresh of the template in which four heroes - some random youngesters who have received powers from a God - have been forced the holy mission of defeating a powerful antagonist (whose immortality makes it necessary to select new heroes every new cycle).\n\nThe author is creative. Beliable characters and rich world building weave together a story with its own originaly (highlights to hero powers and supporting characters). Plus, in honor of the title (Fool), the author interleaves funny interplays in the narrative.\n\nAnother plus side of the story is how the author uses humor to change the scenario of the narrative in a subtle time skip.\n\nCreated at 20/06/22\n\nRevised at 18/11/22\n\nContent removed from original review, after reading further chapters:\n\nBut the pitfall of a time skip is that the plot may weaken. This is a opinion of mine: Mark of The Fool is a story that challenges the writer to keep a backstory of what happens behind the narrative, behind what the reader is aware of. After all, the MC is quickly involved in big events, which draw characters from a very broad level of power.\n\nFrom my own observations, I would say that it is part of any narrative to select what of a fictional world (and its characters) should be shown to the reader. This story is mainly about the journey the MC goes after be provided with the holy powers of the 'Mark of The Fool': grow in power (and in friendships) and defeat the antagonist. So the narrative follows the point of view of the MC for the most part, and skips the progress of what happens with other characters.\n\nThis is, in my opnion, the reason behind the two major weaknesses I felt while reading this story.\n\nLet me illustrate my point with Chapter 304.\n\nContext: The MC is part of an expedition to Thameland aimming to research the potential of using dungeon cores as ingrediens to magical items. The expedition is organized by the very chanceler of a world-renowned city-university. The MC, at this momento of the story, is in the second year of the same university and, hereby, capable of casting up to 2-tier spells. (Maybe 3-tier.) The tiers go up to 9, and any graduated students can cast 6-tier spells. The expedition is made by students, professors, and officers responsable for the university security. At the last, the MC can control a golem which can cast a 5-tier spell.\n\nSince the expedition has just started (and is in the phase of reconning the terrair and stablishing a base), and there is a secrecy to its goals and importance, it makes sense that group deployed could be not THAT strong.\n\nStill Chapter 304 came as a surprise to me.\n\nIn previous chapters, the expedition had successfully vanquished two dugeons (with the help of the heroes). Then, in chapter 304, two (small) villains dialogue about the expedition conquest and highlights the MC and his friends as \"very dangerous\". I think the author lost here the opportunity. The author could have show here that the MC and his friends, despite their own contribution, were not the main protagonists of that battle (since they are still in their grow phase), and had the aid of other supporting characters (which were hidden from the plot because the narrative follows the MC's perspective).\n\nBy some I mean: Theresa and Selina.\n\nWhen I picture how Theresa would have spent one year in Generasi, I imagine she would have had more progress in her dream (of travelling around the world) than the narrative hints to. This could be because the narrative follows the perspective of the MC, and Theresa may have had more progress on that, but the MC is unware. Yet, I still think that the real reason is because the author didn't give this too much thought. And this makes me fear that Theresa may become just another face around the MC, as unfortunately happens in other stories.\n\nNow Selina. Selina is a challenge that offers an opportunity for the author to develop more of the culture of the fictional world. Despite her young age, Seline has witnessed many events that would be traumatic for someone of her age. That is, without considering how is the mindset of children in a magical world faced with the threat of monsters every cycle. When Selina is quite free in a hate speech of 'defeating bad monsters' (not sure now if she uses the word killing), I would expect for the MC or their fosterparents to be worried about Selina's mental healthy. Which is why I am uncertain if the author is failing to convey the desired perspective of Selina as a child (what is not easy to do), or if the author is going back and forth with what is the personality that Selina has.\n\nSo, to reiterate, my suggestion is that author should slow down a bit on the goal to progress the main storyline, and delve a bit in how the world and characters are progressing in the background, outside of the narrative shown to the reader.\n\nSo I listened to the first book on audible and found it enjoyable. The problem is the story shifts to a more slice of life style after the first book ends, which had me skipping multiple chapters up to the 400's. My biggest problem is most of the side character's feel like they are completely one dimensional. There was more character growth in the first 100 chapters than in the last 300. In fact some of the most interesting side characters have little to no scenes. I found very few grammar errors which is always a plus. The style feels to close to badly written anime that is aimed for kids under 12. There are moments that are great but in-between those moments are chapters of filler episodes. The lack of focus and how little the MC actually has to do to do anything to progress is astounding. As you get into later chapters skills the MC has master just start appearing, like speaking multiple languages out of the blue. Little things like that are just lazy writing.\n\nOverall the story is ok. The character growth is non-existent after the first book. The switch from a more adventure orientated to slice of life is a bit of a let down. There are very few grammatical errors which is great. I would say give it a try just don't come out of the first book and expect things to keep that pace and quality.\n\nThere are a lot of reasons involving forced lack of intelligence in characters which originally made me give this 3 stars, but as of chapter 77 this novel is quickly going from a progression fantasy to an everyone but the main character progresses fantasy. The main character suddenly finds the solution to his debuff and then it's slowly but surely established that it's actually useless while it's simultaneously shown that his ability is no better than someone being a little talented in everything, meanwhile his debuff becomes even worse than it was at the start of the story despite his supposed solution and it keeps setting up for a \"but wait there's more\" with it implying that he's only receiving the smallest bit of the debuff, and everyone else is being buffed while he's nerfed and strengthened just enough to make you feel like he isn't quite standing still.\n\nMeanwhile it's also been revealed that all his problems which were previously like endgame bosses are now just small fish in a smaller puddle, and while all of this is going on he is still so debuffed and nerfed that he couldn't win in a fight with a stray cat.\n\nI have no problems with slow pacing, but so far the story itself has a light speed pace to it while the main character seems to be frozen in time in terms of pacing, it's like the author is holding himself back from powering up the main character so he can keep the story going with a weak mc, but then the author loses his patience and constantly pumps liquid power into the veins of anything that moves and isn't named alex. Of course all this forces him to constantly give the main character plot armor and buffs which are of course then negated because the author is mortified by the thought of his abilities giving him any synergy despite him just ignoring it when they actually should give him said synergy, so long story short, for the first 77 chapters I've read there isn't any real meaningful progress that I've seen. The most progress he's made is in his supposed ability to learn things faster but that hardly does anything when it's something related to the story moving forward, even if it isn't at all related to the debuff.\n\nThe only saving grace of this story is how alive the characters feel and his advancing mana manipulation skills which somehow play no part in forming the spells but purely in controlling them.\n\nAnyways as I've said since I first rated this 3 stars and every time I've changed this review since, well deserved 3 stars.\n\nIf you don't mind a weak mc or random bouts of broken Logic with constant references to everything, then I recommend reading this, if you don't enjoy any of those things then I still recomend trying it, but just coast through it without thinking too much.\n\nOh and the references aren't like fanfic level stuff, they just leave an unpleasant taste in your mouth and break the immersion to a certain extent.\n\nTo sum everything up, it seems like this story is dangerously close to falling into the permanent doormat mc territory as the author seems obsessed with keeping him too weak to do anything."
