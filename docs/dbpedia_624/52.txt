Zhejiangosaurus (meaning "Zhejiang lizard") is a genus of nodosaurid dinosaur from the Upper Cretaceous (Cenomanian stage) of Zhejiang, eastern China. It was first named by a group of Chinese authors LÃ¼ Junchang, Jin Xingsheng, Sheng Yiming and Li Yihong in 2007 and the type species is Zhejiangosaurus lishuiensis ("from Lishui", where the fossil was found).[1] It has no diagnostic features, and thus is a nomen dubium.[2]
