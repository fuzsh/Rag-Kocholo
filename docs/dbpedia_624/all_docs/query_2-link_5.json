Carcharodontosaurus was a massive carcharodontosaurid that lived in northern Africa during the Cenomanian stage of the Cretaceous period about 90 million years ago.\n\nRead more\n\nReview: Carcharodontosaurus (Deluxe Prehistoric Collection by CollectA)\n\n4 (25 votes)\n\nIt was some time back in 1995-96 when I first heard of Carcharodontosaurus. Although it had been known to science since 1931, it wasn’t until 1995 when an expedition led by Paul Sereno unearthed additional cranial material for the theropod that Carcharodontosaurus had its moment in the lime light.\n\nRead more\n\nReview: Carcharodontosaurus (Gamba) (Prehistoric Animal Models by PNSO)\n\n4.5 (42 votes)\n\nEight short years ago I wrote a glowing review for the CollectA Deluxe Carcharodontosaurus. At the time the praise was deserved, aside from a Safari toy from the 1990’s there weren’t any other options for the “jagged toothed lizard”. CollectA’s model filled a vacant niche, and it was in turn followed by a new model of the genus from Safari in 2016.\n\nRead more\n\nReview: Carcharodontosaurus (GR Toys by Haolonggood)\n\n4.8 (45 votes)\n\nYou’ll be hard-pressed to find a “shark-toothed” theropod model as decked-out and detailed as this one, although a couple of design flaws might have one hesitating at the retail price.\n\nCarcharodontosaurs have ranked among my favorite dinosaurs since early childhood – the notion of meat-eaters even bigger than the mighty Tyrannosaurus was simply too irresistible to my 5-year-old self, and that initial shock and awe has remained embedded in my psyche to this day.\n\nRead more\n\nReview: Carcharodontosaurus (Jurassic World Dino Escape 2nd ver. by Mattel)\n\n3 (22 votes)\n\nWhat makes this particular release stand out is its coloration, which contrasts starkly with the plainer pattern of the figure’s first release.\n\nThe 1990s were a stirring time for big theropod news: the crocodile-snouted spinosaur Suchomimus from Niger was described in 1998, new fragments of the now-(in)famous Spinosaurus itself were discovered in 1996 and 1998, and the gigantic Giganotosaurus was officially named in 1995.\n\nRead more\n\nReview: Carcharodontosaurus (Jurassic World Dino-Escape, Mega Destroyers by Mattel)\n\n3.3 (23 votes)\n\nIt has been a good year for Carchorodontosaurus, as I mentioned in my review of the figure by PNSO. The PNSO figure, along with the one by GR toys, gave sophisticated collectors a fantastic, updated pair of “shark toothed lizards” to display and admire whilst sipping brandy by the fireside.\n\nRead more\n\nAmazon ad:\n\nReview: Carcharodontosaurus (original version) (Wild Safari by Safari Ltd.)\n\n2.4 (20 votes)\n\nWhen a dinosaurs has a name that means “shark toothed lizard”, you would probably expect the toy depicting that dinosaur to be scary and intense. Carcharodontosaurus was an apex predator and carnivore that frightened most of the local fauna in its day. Its enormous jaws were filled with long, serrated teeth that were designed to rip and tear apart the flesh of its prey.\n\nRead more\n\nReview: Carcharodontosaurus (Recur)\n\n4.1 (26 votes)\n\nThe frightful Carcharodontosaurus derives its name from its razor-sharp teeth, which resemble a great white shark’s. Although it shared its range in Late Cretaceous Africa with Spinosaurus, the two animals probably avoided conflict by pursuing different prey.\n\nRecur’s rendition of Carcharodontosaurus stands 12.5 cm tall and measures about 21 cm long.\n\nRead more\n\nReview: Carcharodontosaurus 2016(Wild Safari by Safari Ltd.)\n\n3.8 (19 votes)\n\nKids perspective by William, edited by Laticauda\n\nIn North Africa 96 million years ago during the Cretaceous period there lived a large theropod named Carcharodontosaurus. It was one of the largest carnivores; its skull alone was around 5 ft (1.6 meters) long. This “shark toothed lizard” had long, sharp, serrated teeth that would slash through the flesh of its prey.\n\nRead more"
