        "text": "Zhejiangosaurus Dinosaur\n\nZhejiangosaurus (phonetically spelled as Zay-jee-ang-o-sore-us) is a Lishuiensis type species named by Junchang Lu, Xingsheng Jin, Yiming Sheng & Yihong Li in 2007. The classification of the species is as follows:\n\nChordata â Reptilia â Dinosauria â Ornithischia â Thyreophora â Ankylosauria â Nodosauridae\n\nThe size of the Zhejiangosaurus is unknown and they followed an herbivorous diet. They existed during the Cenomanian period of the Cretaceous era. The fossil representation includes a partial skeleton including vertebrae, right ilium, partial left ilium, right pubis, end of the ischium and both hind legs.\n\nZhejongosaurus was first named by a group of Chinese and Japanese authors Junchang LÃ¼, Xingsheng Jin, Yiming Sheng and Yihong Li in 2007. The type species is Zhejiangosaurus lishuiensis named from Lishui, a Chinese administrative unit on which the fossil was found. Zhejiangosaurus is an extinct genus of nodosaurid dinosaur from the Cenomanian stage of the Upper Cretaceous of Zhejiang, eastern China.\n\nThe remains of the holotype of Zhejiangosaurus come from Liancheng, in the Chinese administrative unit of Lishui on the province of Zhejiang and they were collected from the Cenomanian-age Chaochuan Formation. The holotype of this species is ZNHM M8718 which consists of a partial skeleton which has preserved a sacrum with eight vertebrae, a complete right ilium and partial left ilium, a complete right pubis, the proximal end of the right ischium, two complete hindlimbs, fourteen caudal vertebrae, and some unidentified bones."
