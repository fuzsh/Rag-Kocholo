        "text": "Dinosaurs once ruled Earth, and we're continually learning more about them. You might know of the T. Rex and the Triceratops, but have you heard of the duck-billed Edmontosaurus or the peacock-like Nomingia?\n\nFrom raptors to tyrannosaurs and sauropods to ornithopods, this list includes more than 700 dinosaurs that lived during the Triassic, Jurassic, and Cretaceous periods. It also includes interesting facts about each dinosaur. You'll find it to be hours of fun. There's certainly a new dinosaur waiting for you to discover. And with new discoveries still happening, there's always the excitement of uncovering a previously unknown dinosaur.\n\nA to D Dinosaurs\n\nWithin these first dinosaurs, you will find well-known names like the Brachiosaurus, Brontosaurus, and the Apatosaurus (formerly the Brontosaurus).
