These “Z” dinosaurs may not be as well-known as some others, but they’re super cool and have some amazing features. So, let’s gear up for a fantastic journey to learn about these incredible dinosaurs that start with Z!\n\nFirst up is the Zephyrosaurus. This dinosaur had a name that sounds like a breeze, and it was a small, fast-moving creature. The Zephyrosaurus walked on two legs and was probably pretty quick on its feet.
