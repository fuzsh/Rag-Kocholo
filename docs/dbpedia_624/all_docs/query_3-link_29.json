Ankylosaurs require ground leaf and ground fruit while Crichtonsaurus extra require ground nut.\n\nSuppose Edmontonia, Saichania, and Minotaurasaurus are added; their preference might be ground leaf and ground fruit. There might be a possibility that they require ground nut.\n\nIt is difficult to say.\n\nThe iconic Brachiosaurus' is tall nut, but I am not sure if the same applies to Sauroposeidon.\n\nIn Jurassic World: Evolution 2, the nodosaurs' preference are ground leaf while Sauropelta also requires ground fruit.

I'm not sure if that answers your question. I went on Wikipedia to see what other species could work and found Chuanqilong and Jinyunpelta.\n\nI'm just saying that both are only known from limited remains; although it does appear Saichania is known from more remains from different parts of the body then Minotaurasaurus.

It sounds like a good addition to the game.\n\nIt sounds cool, but Scelidosaurus covers most of what it can offer and makes a lot more sense if you ask me.\n\nUpdate: Even if the new species of nodosaurs and ankylosaurs being added, I have come to terms that the nodosaurs and ankylosaurs should dislike each other.\n\nOn the bright side, it helps making the exhibits authentic due to none of the nodosaurs and ankylosaurs share the same place of fossil discovery.\n\nIf Edmontonia is added, Dino Nerds will be pleased taking it as an attention detail when it is put together with Edmontosaurus and Pachyrhinosaurus due to it being discovered in the Horseshoe Canyon Formation.\n\nIf Saichania is added, authenticity can be achieved by putting it together with Deinocheirus, Gallimimus, and Homalocephale due to being discovered in Nemegt Formation. Normally, it can be put together with Therizinosaurus. But I have to respect Frontier's wishes of depicting Therizinosaurus as a hateful dinosaur that never tolerates other species.\n\nIf Minotaurasaurus is added, it can only be put together with Oviraptor.\n\nNormally, it can be put together with Therizinosaurus. But I have to respect Frontier's wishes of depicting Therizinosaurus as a hateful dinosaur that never tolerates other species.\n\nTherizinosaurus isn't \"hateful\" it's territorial, and that's how it was depicted in the movie.\n\nTherizinosaurus isn't \"hateful\" it's territorial, and that's how it was depicted in the movie.\n\nThe way I see territorial is that the dinosaur is hostile to humans if they set foot on its territory.\n\nWhat makes Therizinosaurus hateful is that it dislikes everything."
