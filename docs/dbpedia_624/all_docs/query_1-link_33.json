        "meta_description": "Ornithischians form a large clade of globally distributed Mesozoic dinosaurs, and represent one of their three major radiations. Throughout their evolutionary history, exceeding 134 million years, ornithischians evolved considerable morphological disparity, expressed especially through the cranial and osteodermal features of their most distinguishable representatives. The nearly two-century-long research history on ornithischians has resulted in the recognition of numerous diverse lineages, many of which have been named. Following the formative publications establishing the theoretical foundation of phylogenetic nomenclature throughout the 1980s and 1990s, many of the proposed names of ornithischian clades were provided with phylogenetic definitions. Some of these definitions have proven useful and have not been changed, beyond the way they were formulated, since their introduction. Some names, however, have multiple definitions, making their application ambiguous. Recent implementation of the International Code of Phylogenetic Nomenclature (ICPN, or PhyloCode) offers the opportunity to explore the utility of previously proposed definitions of established taxon names. Since the Articles of the ICPN are not to be applied retroactively, all phylogenetic definitions published prior to its implementation remain informal (and ineffective) in the light of the Code. Here, we revise the nomenclature of ornithischian dinosaur clades; we revisit 76 preexisting ornithischian clade names, review their recent and historical use, and formally establish their phylogenetic definitions. Additionally, we introduce five new clade names: two for robustly supported clades of later-diverging hadrosaurids and ceratopsians, one uniting heterodontosaurids and genasaurs, and two for clades of nodosaurids. Our study marks a key step towards a formal phylogenetic nomenclature of ornithischian dinosaurs.",

        "text": "Phylogenetic Nomenclature of Ornithischian Clades\n\nFor the sake of clarity, all clade names are provided in alphabetical order. The definitions are summarized in Table 1. The extent of all clade names is further depicted on Fig. 1 that shows the relationships of taxa included in the present study as specifiers (both, internal as well as external) and additionally on Figs. 2–4 that represent selected ornithischian-wide phylogenies published within recent years: Madzia, Boyd & Mazuch (2018: Fig. 4B), Dieudonné et al. (2020: Figs. 1 and 2), and Yang et al. (2020: Fig. 12).\n\nAnkylopollexia Sereno, 1986 (converted clade name)\n\nRegistration number: 585\n\nDefinition. The smallest clade containing Camptosaurus dispar (Marsh, 1879) and Iguanodon bernissartensis Boulenger in Beneden, 1881. This is a minimum-clade definition. Abbreviated definition: min ∇ (Camptosaurus dispar (Marsh, 1879) & Iguanodon bernissartensis Boulenger in Beneden, 1881).\n\nReference phylogeny. Figure 12 of Madzia, Jagt & Mulder (2020) is treated here as the primary reference phylogeny. Additional reference phylogenies include Figure 3 of Madzia, Boyd & Mazuch (2018), Figure 20 of Verdú et al. (2018), Figure 9 of Verdú et al. (2020), Figure 11 of McDonald et al. (2021), and Figure 11 of Santos-Cubedo et al. (2021).\n\nComposition. The clade Ankylopollexia comprises Camptosaurus dispar and members of the clade Styracosterna.\n\nSynonyms. No other taxon names are currently in use for the same or approximate clade.\n\nComments. The name Ankylopollexia has been (informally) defined before by Sereno (1998: 62) who applied the minimum-clade definition and used Camptosaurus and Parasaurolophus as the internal specifiers. Since the name has traditionally been used in the exact sense, we apply it to the same clade, but prefer to use Iguanodon bernissartensis as the second internal specifier rather than P. walkeri because the name Ankylopollexia was formed after the stiff cone-shaped thumb that characterizes Iguanodon-grade ornithopods. The inclusion of a different internal specifier does not change the extent of Ankylopollexia under any of the published phylogeny inferences. Also, even though the name derives from an apomorphy, it was never used for an apomorphy-based clade.\n\nAnkylosauria Osborn, 1923 (converted clade name)\n\nRegistration number: 588\n\nDefinition. The largest clade containing Ankylosaurus magniventris Brown, 1908 but not Stegosaurus stenops Marsh, 1887. This is a maximum-clade definition. Abbreviated definition: max ∇ (Ankylosaurus magniventris Brown, 1908 ~ Stegosaurus stenops Marsh, 1887).\n\nReference phylogeny. Figure 11 of Arbour & Currie (2016) is treated here as the primary reference phylogeny. Additional reference phylogenies include Figure 3 of Thompson et al. (2012), Figure 1 of Arbour, Zanno & Gates (2016), Figure 3 of Brown et al. (2017), and Figure 26 of Wiersma & Irmis (2018).\n\nComposition. Under the primary reference phylogeny, Ankylosauria comprises Minmi sp. (= Kunbarrasaurus ieversi), Mymoorapelta maysi, and members of the clades Ankylosauridae and Nodosauridae.\n\nSynonyms. The name Ankylosauromorpha Carpenter, 2001 has been recently used under an alternative systematic scheme for the same branch as Ankylosauria, as defined herein (Norman, 2021; see ‘Discussion’). No other taxon names are currently in use for the same or approximate clade.\n\nComments. The name Ankylosauria has been (informally) defined before (Carpenter, 1997; Sereno, 1998; Sereno, 2005). These definitions were maximum-clade and used Ankylosaurus (Carpenter, 1997; Sereno, 1998) or Ankylosaurus magniventris (Sereno, 2005) as the internal specifier and Stegosaurus (Carpenter, 1997; Sereno, 1998) or Stegosaurus stenops (Sereno, 2005) as the external specifier. Since Ankylosauria has been ‘traditionally’ used in this sense (though, see also ‘Discussion’), we formalize this definition. Note that Norman (2021) recently provided two phylogenetic definitions for Ankylosauria, a maximum-clade and a minimum-clade. In the maximum-clade definition Norman (2021) used Euoplocephalus and Edmontonia as the internal specifiers and Scelidosaurus as the external specifier, while in the minimum-clade definition the use of the name was anchored on Euoplocephalus and Edmontonia. See ‘Discussion’ for additional comments. Note that the external specifier Stegosaurus stenops is not included in the primary reference phylogeny. From the taxa analyzed by Arbour & Currie (2016), S. stenops is most closely related to Huayangosaurus taibaii (see, e.g., Maidment et al., 2020).\n\nAnkylosauridae Brown, 1908 (converted clade name)\n\nRegistration number: 589\n\nDefinition. The largest clade containing Ankylosaurus magniventris Brown, 1908 but not Nodosaurus textilis Marsh, 1889. This is a maximum-clade definition. Abbreviated definition: max ∇ (Ankylosaurus magniventris Brown, 1908 ~ Nodosaurus textilis Marsh, 1889).\n\nReference phylogeny. Figure 11 of Arbour & Currie (2016) is treated here as the primary reference phylogeny. Additional reference phylogenies include Figure 3 of Thompson et al. (2012), Figure 1 of Arbour, Zanno & Gates (2016), Figure 3 of Brown et al. (2017), Figure 26 of Wiersma & Irmis (2018), and Figure 9 of Zheng et al. (2018).\n\nComposition. Under the primary reference phylogeny, Ankylosauridae comprises Ahshislepelta minor, Aletopelta coombsi, Cedarpelta bilbeyhallorum, Chuanqilong chaoyangensis, Gastonia burgei, Liaoningosaurus paradoxus, and members of the clades Shamosaurinae and Ankylosaurinae.\n\nSynonyms. No other taxon names are currently in use for the same or approximate clade.\n\nComments. The name Ankylosauridae has been (informally) defined before by Sereno (1998, 2005) who applied a maximum-clade definition and used Ankylosaurus magniventris as the internal specifier and Panoplosaurus mirus as the external specifier. Considering that Ankylosauridae has been traditionally used as a sister taxon to Nodosauridae (see, e.g., Thompson et al., 2012 for details), we use a definition that incorporates Nodosaurus textilis as the external specifier. Note that N. textilis is not included in the primary reference phylogeny. Both, A. magniventris and N. textilis were analyzed by, and their relationship is indicated in, Rivera-Sylva et al. (2018a).\n\nAnkylosaurinae Nopcsa, 1918 (converted clade name)\n\nRegistration number: 590\n\nDefinition. The largest clade containing Ankylosaurus magniventris Brown, 1908 but not Shamosaurus scutatus Tumanova, 1983. This is a maximum-clade definition. Abbreviated definition: max ∇ (Ankylosaurus magniventris Brown, 1908 ~ Shamosaurus scutatus Tumanova, 1983).\n\nReference phylogeny. Figure 11 of Arbour & Currie (2016) is treated here as the primary reference phylogeny. Additional reference phylogenies include Figure 3 of Thompson et al. (2012), Figure 1 of Arbour, Zanno & Gates (2016), Figure 8 of Arbour & Evans (2017), Figure 26 of Wiersma & Irmis (2018), and Figure 9 of Zheng et al. (2018).\n\nComposition. Under the primary reference phylogeny, Ankylosaurinae comprises Crichtonpelta benxiensis, Pinacosaurus spp., Saichania chulsanensis, Tarchia kielanae, Tsagantegia longicranialis, Zaraapelta nomadis, ‘Zhejiangosaurus luoyangensis’, and members of the clade Ankylosaurini.\n\nSynonyms. No other taxon names are currently in use for the same or approximate clade.\n\nComments. The name Ankylosaurinae was (informally) defined before (Sereno, 1998; Sereno, 2005; Vickaryous, Maryanska & Weishampel, 2004). All these definitions were maximum-clade and used Ankylosaurus (Sereno, 1998) or Ankylosaurus magniventris (Sereno, 2005; Vickaryous, Maryanska & Weishampel, 2004) as the internal specifiers and Minmi paravertebra and Shamosaurus scutatus (Sereno, 1998), Gargoyleosaurus parkpinorum, Minmi paravertebra, and Shamosaurus scutatus (Sereno, 2005) or only Shamosaurus scutatus (Vickaryous, Maryanska & Weishampel, 2004) as the external specifiers. Owing to the dubious taxonomic status of ‘M. paravertebra’ (Arbour & Currie, 2016) and non-ankylosaurid affinities of G. parkpinorum (e.g., Arbour & Currie, 2016; Rivera-Sylva et al., 2018a; Wiersma & Irmis, 2018; Zheng et al., 2018), we formalize the definition of Vickaryous, Maryanska & Weishampel (2004) in that we use a single external specifier (Shamosaurus scutatus).\n\nAnkylosaurini Arbour & Currie, 2016 (converted clade name)\n\nRegistration number: 592\n\nDefinition. The largest clade containing Ankylosaurus magniventris Brown, 1908 but not Pinacosaurus grangeri Gilmore, 1933 and Saichania chulsanensis Maryańska, 1977. This is a maximum-clade definition. Abbreviated definition: max ∇ (Ankylosaurus magniventris Brown, 1908 ~ Pinacosaurus grangeri Gilmore, 1933 & Saichania chulsanensis Maryańska, 1977).\n\nReference phylogeny. Figure 11 of Arbour & Currie (2016) is treated here as the primary reference phylogeny. Additional reference phylogenies include Figure 1 of Arbour, Zanno & Gates (2016), Figure 8 of Arbour & Evans (2017), Figure 26 of Wiersma & Irmis (2018), and Figure 9 of Zheng et al. (2018).\n\nComposition. Under the primary reference phylogeny, Ankylosaurini comprises Ankylosaurus magniventris, Anodontosaurus lambei, Dyoplosaurus acutosquameus, Euoplocephalus tutus, Nodocephalosaurus kirtlandensis, Scolosaurus cutleri, Talarurus plicatospineus, and Ziapelta sanjuanensis.\n\nSynonyms. No other taxon names are currently in use for the same or approximate clade.\n\nComments. The name Ankylosaurini was first (informally) defined by Arbour & Currie (2016) who applied the maximum-clade definition and used Ankylosaurus magniventris as the internal specifier and Pinacosaurus grangeri and Saichania chulsanensis as the external specifiers. The name was used for a clade that largely includes later-diverging North American ankylosaurines, many of which were previously synonymized with Euoplocephalus tutus (Arbour & Currie, 2013), although under some topologies the name may be more restricted in its use (Thompson et al., 2012).\n\nAralosaurini Prieto-Márquez et al., 2013 (converted clade name)\n\nRegistration number: 593\n\nDefinition. The largest clade containing Aralosaurus tuberiferus Rozhdestvensky, 1968 and Canardia garonnensis Prieto-Márquez et al., 2013 but not Lambeosaurus lambei Parks, 1923, Parasaurolophus walkeri Parks, 1922, and Tsintaosaurus spinorhinus Young, 1958. This is a maximum-clade definition. Abbreviated definition: max ∇ (Aralosaurus tuberiferus Rozhdestvensky, 1968 & Canardia garonnensis Prieto-Márquez et al., 2013 ~ Lambeosaurus lambei Parks, 1923 & Parasaurolophus walkeri Parks, 1922 & Tsintaosaurus spinorhinus Young, 1958).\n\nReference phylogeny. Figure 25 of Prieto-Márquez et al. (2013) is treated here as the primary reference phylogeny. Additional reference phylogeny includes Figure 11 of McDonald et al. (2021).\n\nComposition. Under the primary reference phylogeny, Aralosaurini comprises Aralosaurus tuberiferus and Canardia garonnensis.\n\nSynonyms. No other taxon names are currently in use for the same or approximate clade.\n\nComments. The name was first (informally) defined by Prieto-Márquez et al. (2013) who applied the minimum-clade definition and used Aralosaurus tuberiferus and Canardia garonnensis as the internal specifiers. Following such definition, however, Aralosaurini would cover the entire lambeosaurine branch under some topologies that include both of the internal specifiers (Kobayashi et al., 2019; Prieto-Márquez et al., 2019; Zhang et al., 2019; Gates, Evans & Sertich, 2021; Kobayashi et al., 2021; Longrich et al., 2021), or would even comprise the same contents as Euhadrosauria (Ramírez-Velasco et al., 2021). Recently, however, McDonald et al. (2021) inferred Aralosaurini as delimited by Prieto-Márquez et al. (2013). Therefore, we define the name but make it inapplicable under a subset of recent phylogenies.\n\nBrachylophosaurini Gates et al., 2011 (converted clade name)\n\nRegistration number: 594\n\nDefinition. The largest clade containing Brachylophosaurus canadensis Sternberg, 1953 but not Edmontosaurus regalis Lambe, 1917, Hadrosaurus foulkii Leidy, 1858, Kritosaurus navajovius Brown, 1910, and Saurolophus osborni Brown, 1912. This is a maximum-clade definition. Abbreviated definition: max ∇ (Brachylophosaurus canadensis Sternberg, 1953 ~ Edmontosaurus regalis Lambe, 1917 & Hadrosaurus foulkii Leidy, 1858 & Kritosaurus navajovius Brown, 1910 & Saurolophus osborni Brown, 1912).\n\nReference phylogeny. Figure 18 of Prieto-Márquez, Wagner & Lehman (2020) is treated here as the primary reference phylogeny. Additional reference phylogenies include Figure 5 of Kobayashi et al. (2019), Figure 11 of Prieto-Márquez et al. (2019), Figure 9 of Zhang et al. (2019), Figure 5 of Zhang et al. (2020), Figure 7 of Kobayashi et al. (2021), and Figure 10 of Longrich et al. (2021).\n\nComposition. Under the primary reference phylogeny, Brachylophosaurini comprises Acristavus gagslarsoni, Brachylophosaurus canadensis, Maiasaura peeblesorum, and Probrachylophosaurus bergei (erroneously named ‘Probrachylophosaurus canadensis’ in the primary reference phylogeny).\n\nSynonyms. The name Maiasaurini Sereno, 2005 is an approximate synonym of Brachylophosaurini. To our knowledge, the name was used only in two recent papers (McFeeters et al., 2021; McFeeters, Evans & Maddin, 2021) that attributed the name to Horner (1992). However, this attribution was due to the adherence of the authors to the Principle of Coordination, as Horner (1992) used the name Maiasaurinae. Nevertheless, all recent phylogenetic studies consistently use Brachylophosaurini (e.g., Freedman Fowler & Horner, 2015; Cruzado-Caballero & Powell, 2017; Xing, Mallon & Currie, 2017; Kobayashi et al., 2019; Zhang et al., 2019; Prieto-Márquez, Wagner & Lehman, 2020; Zhang et al., 2020; Kobayashi et al., 2021; McDonald et al., 2021). No other taxon names are currently in use for the same or approximate clade.\n\nComments. The name Brachylophosaurini has been (informally) defined before (Gates et al., 2011; Freedman Fowler & Horner, 2015). These definitions were maximum-clade and used Brachylophosaurus, Maiasaura, and Acristavus (Gates et al., 2011) or Brachylophosaurus, Probrachylophosaurus, Maiasaura, and Acristavus (Freedman Fowler & Horner, 2015) as the internal specifiers and Gryposaurus and Saurolophus as the external specifiers. The composition of Brachylophosaurini and the relationships of the clade to other hadrosaurids have been stable across studies since the introduction of the name. Therefore, using more than one internal specifier is unnecessary. We use a definition that ensures Brachylophosaurini does not cover taxa ‘traditionally’ comprised within Edmontosaurini, Kritosaurini, and Saurolophini.\n\nCamptosauridae Marsh, 1885 (converted clade name)\n\nRegistration number: 595\n\nDefinition. The largest clade containing Camptosaurus dispar (Marsh, 1879) but not Iguanodon bernissartensis Boulenger in Beneden, 1881. This is a maximum-clade definition. Abbreviated definition: max ∇ (Camptosaurus dispar (Marsh, 1879) ~ Iguanodon bernissartensis Boulenger in Beneden, 1881).\n\nReference phylogeny. Figure 13 of Madzia, Jagt & Mulder (2020) is treated here as the primary reference phylogeny. Additional reference phylogenies include Figure 20 of Verdú et al. (2018), Figure 11 of Santos-Cubedo et al. (2021), and Figure 9 of Verdú et al. (2020).\n\nComposition. Under the primary reference phylogeny, Camptosauridae comprises Camptosaurus dispar and Cumnoria prestwichii. Under alternative hypotheses, however, Camptosauridae includes only a single unequivocal member, Camptosaurus dispar (e.g., Madzia, Jagt & Mulder, 2020: Fig. 12).\n\nSynonyms. No other taxon names are currently in use for the same or approximate clade.\n\nComments. The name Camptosauridae was first (informally) defined by Sereno (1998: 62) who used the maximum-clade definition and selected Camptosaurus as the internal specifier and Parasaurolophus as the external specifier. We prefer to use Iguanodon bernissartensis as the external specifier to maintain the ‘node-branch triplet’ (‘node-stem triplet’ of Sereno (1998: 52–54)) comprising Ankylopollexia, Camptosauridae, and Styracosterna (all formally defined in the present paper). The inclusion of a different external specifier does not change the extent of Camptosauridae under any of the published phylogeny inferences.\n\nCentrosaurinae Lambe, 1915 (converted clade name)\n\nRegistration number: 596\n\nDefinition. The largest clade containing Centrosaurus apertus Lambe, 1905 but not Chasmosaurus belli (Lambe, 1902) and Triceratops horridus Marsh, 1889. This is a maximum-clade definition. Abbreviated definition: max ∇ (Centrosaurus apertus Lambe, 1905 ~ Chasmosaurus belli (Lambe, 1902) & Triceratops horridus Marsh, 1889).\n\nReference phylogeny. Figure 9 of Chiba et al. (2018) is treated here as the primary reference phylogeny. Additional reference phylogenies include Figure 10 of Ryan et al. (2017), Figure 13 of Dalman et al. (2018), Figure 10 of Wilson, Ryan & Evans (2020), Figure 4 of Yu et al. (2020), and Figure 23 of Dalman et al. (2021).\n\nComposition. Under the primary reference phylogeny, Centrosaurinae comprises Albertaceratops nesmoi, Diabloceratops eatoni, Machairoceratops cronusi, Medusaceratops lokii, Sinoceratops zhuchengensis, Wendiceratops pinhornensis, Xenoceratops foremostensis, and members of the clades Eucentrosaura and Nasutoceratopsini.\n\nSynonyms. No other taxon names are currently in use for the same or approximate clade. Although Ceratops montanus may fall within the largest clade containing Centrosaurus apertus but not Chasmosaurus belli and Triceratops horridus as well, the name Ceratopsinae Abel, 1919 has not been associated with the same contents as Centrosaurinae in the past. Therefore, Ceratopsinae is not considered to be an approximate synonym of Centrosaurinae. In any case, C. montanus does not seem to be diagnostic beyond Ceratopsidae at present (Dodson, Forster & Sampson, 2004; Mallon et al., 2016). Therefore, its position within the clade is uncertain. Lucas et al. (2016: 202) have argued that Pachyrhinosaurinae von Huene, 1950 has priority over Centrosaurinae under the Article 61 of the ICZN (International Commission on Zoological Nomenclature, 1999). However, the name Pachyrhinosaurinae has not been used in the literature recently and even Lucas et al. (2016) used Centrosaurinae for the clade in question.\n\nComments. The name Centrosaurinae has been (informally) defined before (Sereno, 1998; Dodson, Forster & Sampson, 2004; Sereno, 2005). These definitions were maximum-clade and used Pachyrhinosaurus (Sereno, 1998), Centrosaurus (Dodson, Forster & Sampson, 2004), or Centrosaurus apertus (Sereno, 2005) as the internal specifier and Triceratops (Sereno, 1998; Dodson, Forster & Sampson, 2004) or Triceratops horridus (Sereno, 2005) as the external specifier. We apply the name Centrosaurinae for the same known contents; adopting the mandatory Centrosaurus apertus as the internal specifier and Chasmosaurus belli and Triceratops horridus as the external specifiers.\n\nCentrosaurini Ryan et al., 2017 (converted clade name)\n\nRegistration number: 687\n\nDefinition. The largest clade containing Centrosaurus apertus Lambe, 1905 but not Pachyrhinosaurus canadensis Sternberg, 1950. This is a maximum-clade definition. Abbreviated definition: max ∇ (Centrosaurus apertus Lambe, 1905 ~ Pachyrhinosaurus canadensis Sternberg, 1950).\n\nReference phylogeny. Figure 9 of Chiba et al. (2018) is treated here as the primary reference phylogeny. Additional reference phylogenies include Figure 7 of Fiorillo & Tykoski (2012), Figure 10 of Ryan et al. (2017), Figure 13 of Dalman et al. (2018), and Figure 23 of Dalman et al. (2021).\n\nComposition. Under the primary reference phylogeny, Centrosaurini comprises Centrosaurus apertus, Coronosaurus brinkmani, Rubeosaurus ovatus (?= Styracosaurus albertensis; see Holmes et al., 2020), Spinops sternbergorum, and Styracosaurus albertensis. Under an alternative hypothesis, Centrosaurini includes only a single unequivocal member, Centrosaurus apertus (Wilson, Ryan & Evans, 2020: Fig. 10). However, a Bayesian analysis of the same matrix and published in the same study reconstructed Centrosaurini to comprise Centrosaurus apertus, Coronosaurus brinkmani, and Spinops sternbergorum (Wilson, Ryan & Evans, 2020: Fig. 9).\n\nSynonyms. No other taxon names are currently in use for the same or approximate clade.\n\nComments. The name was first (informally) defined by Ryan et al. (2017) who applied the maximum-clade definition and used Centrosaurus apertus as the internal specifier and Pachyrhinosaurus canadensis as the external specifier. We formalize this definition.\n\nCerapoda Sereno, 1986 (converted clade name)\n\nRegistration number: 597\n\nDefinition. The smallest clade containing Iguanodon bernissartensis Boulenger in Beneden, 1881, Pachycephalosaurus wyomingensis (Gilmore, 1931), and Triceratops horridus Marsh, 1889. This is a minimum-clade definition. Abbreviated definition: min ∇ (Iguanodon bernissartensis Boulenger in Beneden, 1881 & Pachycephalosaurus wyomingensis (Gilmore, 1931) & Triceratops horridus Marsh, 1889).\n\nReference phylogeny. Figure 4 of Madzia, Boyd & Mazuch (2018) is treated here as the primary reference phylogeny. Additional reference phylogenies include Figure 16 of Han et al. (2018), Figure 25 of Herne et al.

Under the primary reference phylogeny, Cerapoda comprises members of the clades Ornithopoda and Marginocephalia.\n\nSynonyms. No other taxon names are currently in use for the same or approximate clade.\n\nComments. The name Cerapoda has been (informally) defined before (Weishampel, 2004; Butler, Upchurch & Norman, 2008). Both types of definitions, minimum-clade as well as maximum-clade, have been proposed for the name. Weishampel (2004) preferred a maximum-clade definition and used Triceratops as the internal specifier and Ankylosaurus as the external specifier, while Butler, Upchurch & Norman (2008) applied a minimum-clade definition, using Triceratops horridus and Parasaurolophus walkeri as the internal specifiers. Subsequent authors followed the latter definition (Boyd, 2015; Madzia, Boyd & Mazuch, 2018; Herne et al., 2019; Yang et al., 2020). We apply a minimum-clade definition as well and use Iguanodon bernissartensis, Pachycephalosaurus wyomingensis, and Triceratops horridus as the internal specifiers. Note that the internal specifiers Pachycephalosaurus wyomingensis and Triceratops horridus are not included in the primary reference phylogeny. The former belongs to Pachycephalosauria (see, e.g., Dieudonné et al., 2020), while the latter is part of Ceratopsia (e.g., Morschhauser et al., 2019), both within Marginocephalia that is indicated on Figure 4 of Madzia, Boyd & Mazuch (2018).\n\nCeratopsia Marsh, 1890 (converted clade name)\n\nRegistration number: 598\n\nDefinition. The largest clade containing Ceratops montanus Marsh, 1888 and Triceratops horridus Marsh, 1889 but not Pachycephalosaurus wyomingensis (Gilmore, 1931). This is a maximum-clade definition. Abbreviated definition: max ∇ (Ceratops montanus Marsh, 1888 & Triceratops horridus Marsh, 1889 ~ Pachycephalosaurus wyomingensis (Gilmore, 1931)).\n\nReference phylogeny. Figure 10 of Morschhauser et al. (2019) is treated here as the primary reference phylogeny. Additional reference phylogenies include Figure 16 of Han et al. (2018), Figure S1 of Knapp et al. (2018), Figure 1 of Dieudonné et al. (2020), Figure 3 of Yu et al. (2020), and Figure 4 of Yu et al. (2020).\n\nComposition. Under the primary reference phylogeny, Ceratopsia comprises Psittacosaurus spp. and members of the clades Chaoyangsauridae and Neoceratopsia.\n\nSynonyms. No other taxon names are currently in use for the same or approximate clade.\n\nComments. The name Ceratopsia has been (informally) defined before (Dodson, 1997; Sereno, 1998; Sereno, 2005). These definitions were maximum-clade and used Ceratopsidae (Dodson, 1997), Triceratops (Sereno, 1998), or Triceratops horridus (Sereno, 2005) as the internal specifiers and Pachycephalosauridae (Dodson, 1997), Pachycephalosaurus (Sereno, 1998), or Pachycephalosaurus wyomingensis, Heterodontosaurus tucki, Hypsilophodon foxii, and Ankylosaurus magniventris (Sereno, 2005) as the external specifiers. Even though the position of Hypsilophodon foxii and Heterodontosaurus tucki is indeed somewhat unstable across studies (see, e.g., Han et al., 2018; Madzia, Boyd & Mazuch, 2018; Herne et al., 2019; Dieudonné et al., 2020; Yang et al., 2020), inclusion of these taxa among the external specifiers is not necessary. We use a definition similar to that of Sereno (1998) but include the mandatory Ceratops montanus as a second internal specifier. Note that the internal specifier Ceratops montanus and the external specifier Pachycephalosaurus wyomingensis are not included in the primary reference phylogeny. The former belongs to Ceratopsidae (e.g., Mallon et al., 2016), while the latter is part of Pachycephalosauria (see, e.g., Dieudonné et al., 2020).\n\nCeratopsidae Marsh, 1888 (converted clade name)\n\nRegistration number: 599\n\nDefinition. The smallest clade containing Centrosaurus apertus Lambe, 1905, Ceratops montanus Marsh, 1888, Chasmosaurus belli (Lambe, 1902), and Triceratops horridus Marsh, 1889. This is a minimum-clade definition. Abbreviated definition: min ∇ (Centrosaurus apertus Lambe, 1905 & Ceratops montanus Marsh, 1888 & Chasmosaurus belli (Lambe, 1902) & Triceratops horridus Marsh, 1889).\n\nReference phylogeny. Figure 4 of Yu et al. (2020) is treated here as the primary reference phylogeny. Additional reference phylogenies include Figure 14 of Mallon et al. (2016), Figure S1 of Knapp et al. (2018), Figure 9a of Fowler & Freedman Fowler (2020), Figure 10 of Wilson, Ryan & Evans (2020), and Figure 3 of Yu et al. (2020).\n\nComposition. Under the primary reference phylogeny, Ceratopsidae comprises members of the clades Centrosaurinae and Chasmosaurinae.\n\nSynonyms. No other taxon names are currently in use for the same or approximate clade.\n\nComments. The name Ceratopsidae has been (informally) defined before (Sereno, 1998, Dodson, Forster & Sampson, 2004; Sereno, 2005). These definitions were minimum-clade and used Triceratops and Pachyrhinosaurus (Sereno, 1998), Triceratops and Centrosaurus (Dodson, Forster & Sampson, 2004), and Triceratops horridus and Pachyrhinosaurus canadensis (Sereno, 2005) as the internal specifiers. Considering that Ceratopsidae ‘traditionally’ contains two subclades, Centrosaurinae and Chasmosaurinae, we include the nomenclatural types of these clades, Centrosaurus apertus and Chasmosaurus belli, respectively, as the internal specifiers, and additionally add Triceratops horridus, a common specifier in the nomenclature of ceratopsian clades and the only taxon that has always been used as an internal specifier in the definition of Ceratopsidae. Finally, we also include a fourth internal specifier, the mandatory Ceratops montanus. Even though the taxon is considered a nomen dubium (e.g., Dodson, Forster & Sampson, 2004; Mallon et al., 2016), its placement within the smallest clade comprising centrosaurines and chasmosaurines does not appear to be questionable (see, e.g., Mallon et al., 2016).\n\nCeratopsoidea Hay, 1902 (converted clade name)\n\nRegistration number: 601\n\nDefinition.

Under the primary reference phylogeny, Ceratopsoidea comprises Turanoceratops tardabilis, Zuniceratops christopheri, and members of the clade Ceratopsidae.\n\nSynonyms. No other taxon names are currently in use for the same or approximate clade.\n\nComments. The name Ceratopsoidea has been (informally) defined before by Sereno (1998, 2005) who applied a maximum-clade definition and used Triceratops horridus as the internal specifier and Protoceratops andrewsi as the external specifier. We include an additional internal specifier, the mandatory Ceratops montanus.\n\nChaoyangsauridae Zhao, Cheng & Xu, 1999 (converted clade name)\n\nRegistration number: 602\n\nDefinition. The largest clade containing Chaoyangsaurus youngi Zhao, Cheng & Xu, 1999 but not Psittacosaurus mongoliensis Osborn, 1923 and Triceratops horridus Marsh, 1889. This is a maximum-clade definition. Abbreviated definition: max ∇ (Chaoyangsaurus youngi Zhao, Cheng & Xu, 1999 ~ Psittacosaurus mongoliensis Osborn, 1923 & Triceratops horridus Marsh, 1889).\n\nReference phylogeny.

Under the primary reference phylogeny, Chaoyangsauridae comprises Chaoyangsaurus youngi, Hualianceratops wucaiwanensis, Xuanhuaceratops niei, and Yinlong downsi.\n\nSynonyms. No other taxon names are currently in use for the same or approximate clade.\n\nComments. The name Chaoyangsauridae has been (informally) defined before by Han et al. (2015) who applied a maximum-clade definition and used Chaoyangsaurus youngi as the internal specifier and Triceratops horridus and Psittacosaurus mongoliensis as the external specifiers. We formalize this definition.\n\nChasmosaurinae Lambe, 1915 (converted clade name)\n\nRegistration number: 603\n\nDefinition. The largest clade containing Chasmosaurus belli (Lambe, 1902) and Triceratops horridus Marsh, 1889 but not Centrosaurus apertus Lambe, 1905. This is a maximum-clade definition. Abbreviated definition: max ∇ (Chasmosaurus belli (Lambe, 1902) & Triceratops horridus Marsh, 1889 ~ Centrosaurus apertus Lambe, 1905).\n\nReference phylogeny. Figure 9a of Fowler & Freedman Fowler (2020) is treated here as the primary reference phylogeny. Additional reference phylogenies include Figure 3 of Brown & Henderson (2015), Figure 14 of Mallon et al. (2016), Figure S1 of Knapp et al. (2018), Figure 3 of Campbell et al. (2019), and Figure 4 of Yu et al. (2020).\n\nComposition. Under the primary reference phylogeny, Chasmosaurinae comprises Agujaceratops mariscalensis, Anchiceratops ornatus, Arrhinoceratops brachyops, Bravoceratops polyphemus, Chasmosaurus spp., Coahuilaceratops magnacuerna, Kosmoceratops richardsoni, Navajoceratops sullivani, Pentaceratops sternbergii, Terminocavus sealyi, Utahceratops gettyi, Vagaceratops irvinensis, and members of the clade Triceratopsini.\n\nSynonyms. The taxon Ceratops montanus may also fall within the largest clade containing Chasmosaurus belli and Triceratops horridus but not Centrosaurus apertus (see, e.g., Mallon et al., 2016). In such case, Ceratopsinae Abel, 1919 would be an approximate synonym. Though the name has been advocated to be the proper name for the clade (it has been (informally) defined by Sereno, 1998 and Sereno, 2005), it was actually introduced 4 years later than Chasmosaurinae. Note that the Principle of Coordination, which would make Ceratopsinae attributable to Marsh (1888), rather than to Abel (1919), does not apply under the ICPN (see Note 9.15A.3). Therefore, Ceratopsinae would not have priority over Chasmosaurinae under the ICPN. Anyway, C. montanus does not seem to be diagnostic beyond Ceratopsidae at present (Mallon et al., 2016), and its position within the clade is thus uncertain.\n\nComments. The name Chasmosaurinae has been (informally) defined before by Dodson, Forster & Sampson (2004) who applied a maximum-clade definition and used Triceratops as the internal specifier and Centrosaurus as the external specifier. We apply the name Chasmosaurinae for the same known contents; adopting Triceratops horridus and the mandatory Chasmosaurus belli as the internal specifiers and Centrosaurus apertus as the external specifier.\n\nClypeodonta Norman, 2014 (converted clade name)\n\nRegistration number: 604\n\nDefinition. The smallest clade within Ornithopoda containing Edmontosaurus regalis Lambe, 1917 and Hypsilophodon foxii Huxley, 1869. This is a minimum-clade definition. Abbreviated definition: min ∇ ∈ Ornithopoda (Edmontosaurus regalis Lambe, 1917 & Hypsilophodon foxii Huxley, 1869).\n\nReference phylogeny. Figure 50 of Norman (2015) is treated here as the primary reference phylogeny. Additional reference phylogenies include Figure 25 of Herne et al. (2019) and Figure 2 of Dieudonné et al. (2020).\n\nComposition. Under the primary reference phylogeny, Clypeodonta comprises a clade formed by Hypsilophodon foxii, Rhabdodontidae, and Tenontosaurus spp., and a clade uniting Dryosauridae and Ankylopollexia (termed Iguanodontia in Norman, 2015). However, see ‘Comments’ below for discussion of potential alternative composition of Clypeodonta.\n\nSynonyms. No other taxon names are currently in use for the same or approximate clade. Iguanodontia, as reconstructed, for example, by Madzia, Jagt & Mulder (2020) covers a similar taxic composition; though the topology of Madzia, Jagt & Mulder (2020) differs from that of the primary reference phylogeny of Clypeodonta significantly.\n\nComments. The name Clypeodonta was claimed as being new in two different studies (Norman, 2014: 29; Norman, 2015: 102), although Norman (2015: 170) also cites Norman (2014) as the establishing reference. The use of the name Clypeodonta differed across studies. Originally, Norman (2014, 2015) intended to use it for a subclade of Ornithopoda that (approximately) comprises Hypsilophodon foxii and its relatives, and ornithopods later-diverging than H. foxii, and (informally) defined the name as pertaining to either, the branch of “Parasaurolophus walkeri and all taxa more closely related to P. walkeri than to Thescelosaurus neglectus” (Norman, 2014: 29) or the node of “Hypsilophodon foxii, Edmontosaurus regalis, their most recent common ancestor, and all of its descendants” (Norman, 2015: 170). In both these studies, Clypeodonta is said (Norman, 2014: 29) or figured (Norman, 2015: Fig. 50) to cover the same known contents although neither of the studies included taxa in their analyses that would fall outside the clade (except for Lesothosaurus diagnosticus). Madzia, Boyd & Mazuch (2018) followed the definition of Norman (2015). In their phylogenetic analysis, however, the name covers a much broader contents as one of the internal specifiers of Clypeodonta, Hypsilophodon foxii, is reconstructed outside Cerapoda in that study (Madzia, Boyd & Mazuch, 2018: Fig. 4). Still, Madzia, Boyd & Mazuch (2018: Appendix 1) stated that as Clypeodonta was a relatively new name with no ‘traditional’ meaning, they saw no reason for its redefinition. They also noted, though, that “given the unstable position of H. foxii among neornithischians, the name might have only limited utility” (Madzia, Boyd & Mazuch, 2018: Appendix 1).\n\nHere we define the name Clypeodonta using the minimum-clade definition of Norman (2015). However, by including the part “within Ornithopoda” in the definition, we restrict the use of Clypeodonta only when H. foxii represents an ornithopod (see Article 11.14 of the ICPN), following the original intent of Norman (2014, 2015).\n\nCoronosauria Sereno, 1986 (converted clade name)\n\nRegistration number: 605\n\nDefinition.

Abbreviated definition: min ∇ (Protoceratops andrewsi Granger & Gregory, 1923 & Triceratops horridus Marsh, 1889).\n\nReference phylogeny. Figure 10 of Morschhauser et al. (2019) is treated here as the primary reference phylogeny. Additional reference phylogenies include Figure S1 of Knapp et al. (2018), Figure 8A of Arbour & Evans (2019), Figure 3 of Yu et al. (2020), and Figure 4 of Yu et al. (2020).\n\nComposition. Under the primary reference phylogeny, Coronosauria comprises members of the clades Protoceratopsidae and Ceratopsoidea.\n\nSynonyms. No other taxon names are currently in use for the same or approximate clade.\n\nComments. The name Coronosauria has been (informally) defined before by Sereno (1998, 2005) who applied the minimum-clade definition and used Triceratops horridus and Protoceratops andrewsi as the internal specifiers. We formalize this definition.\n\nCorythosauria (new clade name)\n\nRegistration number: 746\n\nDefinition. The smallest clade containing Corythosaurus casuarius Brown, 1914a, Lambeosaurus lambei Parks, 1923, and Parasaurolophus walkeri Parks, 1922. This is a minimum-clade definition. Abbreviated definition: min ∇ (Corythosaurus casuarius Brown, 1914a & Lambeosaurus lambei Parks, 1923 & Parasaurolophus walkeri Parks, 1922).\n\nEtymology. Derived from the stem of Corythosaurus Brown, 1914a, the name of an included taxon, which combines the Greek words korythos (helmet) and sauros (lizard, reptile).\n\nReference phylogeny. Figure 18 of Prieto-Márquez, Wagner & Lehman (2020) is treated here as the primary reference phylogeny. Additional reference phylogenies include Figure 5 of Kobayashi et al. (2019), Figure 11 of Prieto-Márquez et al. (2019), Figure 9 of Zhang et al. (2019), Figure 5 of Zhang et al. (2020), Figure 7 of Kobayashi et al. (2021), and Figure 10 of Longrich et al. (2021).\n\nComposition. Under the primary reference phylogeny, Corythosauria comprises members of the clades Lambeosaurini and Parasaurolophini.\n\nSynonyms. No other taxon names are currently in use for the same or approximate clade.\n\nComments. The name Corythosauria is established for the well-supported node uniting Lambeosaurini and Parasaurolophini, two lambeosaurine clades characterized by their distinctive, ‘crested’ crania.\n\nDryomorpha Sereno, 1986 (converted clade name)\n\nRegistration number: 606\n\nDefinition. The smallest clade containing Dryosaurus altus (Marsh, 1878) and Iguanodon bernissartensis Boulenger in Beneden, 1881. This is a minimum-clade definition. Abbreviated definition: min ∇ (Dryosaurus altus (Marsh, 1878) & Iguanodon bernissartensis Boulenger in Beneden, 1881).\n\nReference phylogeny. Figure 12 of Madzia, Jagt & Mulder (2020) is treated here as the primary reference phylogeny. Additional reference phylogenies include Figure 20 of Verdú et al. (2018), Figure 2 of Dieudonné et al. (2020), Figure 9 of Verdú et al. (2020), and Figure 11 of Santos-Cubedo et al. (2021).\n\nComposition. Under the primary reference phylogeny, Dryomorpha comprises members of the clades Dryosauridae and Ankylopollexia.\n\nSynonyms. No other taxon names are currently in use for the same or approximate clade.\n\nComments. The name Dryomorpha was first (informally) defined by Sereno (2005) who attributed the name to “(t)he most inclusive clade containing Dryosaurus altus (Marsh, 1878) and Parasaurolophus walkeri Parks, 1922”. However, due to the use of ‘most’, rather than ‘least’, such definition makes the name inapplicable within Ornithischia. Boyd (2015) later corrected the wording and proposed a minimum-clade definition using the same taxa as the internal specifiers. Here we use the same type of definition but replace P. walkeri with I. bernissartensis. This taxon has always been considered a part of Dryomorpha.\n\nDryosauridae Milner & Norman, 1984 (converted clade name)\n\nRegistration number: 607\n\nDefinition. The largest clade containing Dryosaurus altus (Marsh, 1878) but not Iguanodon bernissartensis Boulenger in Beneden, 1881. This is a maximum-clade definition. Abbreviated definition: max ∇ (Dryosaurus altus (Marsh, 1878) ~ Iguanodon bernissartensis Boulenger in Beneden, 1881).\n\nReference phylogeny. Figure 12 of Madzia, Jagt & Mulder (2020) is treated here as the primary reference phylogeny. Additional reference phylogenies include Figure 20 of Verdú et al. (2018), Figure 9 of Verdú et al. (2020), Figure 57 of Barta & Norell (2021), and Figure 11 of Santos-Cubedo et al. (2021).\n\nComposition. Under the primary reference phylogeny, Dryosauridae comprises Callovosaurus leedsi, ‘Camptosaurus’ valdensis, Dryosaurus altus, Dysalotosaurus lettowvorbecki, Elrhazosaurus nigeriensis, Eousdryosaurus nanohallucis, and Valdosaurus canaliculatus.\n\nSynonyms. No other taxon names are currently in use for the same or approximate clade.\n\nComments. Dryosauridae was first (informally) defined by Sereno (1998: 61) who used the maximum-clade definition and Dryosaurus altus as the internal specifier and Parasaurolophus walkeri as the external specifier. Here we use the same type of definition but replace P. walkeri with I. bernissartensis. This taxon has always been considered outside Dryosauridae.\n\nEdmontosaurini Glut, 1997 (converted clade name)\n\nRegistration number: 608\n\nDefinition. The largest clade containing Edmontosaurus regalis Lambe, 1917 but not Brachylophosaurus canadensis Sternberg, 1953, Hadrosaurus foulkii Leidy, 1858, Kritosaurus navajovius Brown, 1910, and Saurolophus osborni Brown, 1912. This is a maximum-clade definition. Abbreviated definition: max ∇ (Edmontosaurus regalis Lambe, 1917 ~ Brachylophosaurus canadensis Sternberg, 1953 & Hadrosaurus foulkii Leidy, 1858 & Kritosaurus navajovius Brown, 1910 & Saurolophus osborni Brown, 1912).\n\nReference phylogeny. Figure 18 of Prieto-Márquez, Wagner & Lehman (2020) is treated here as the primary reference phylogeny. Additional reference phylogenies include Figure 5 of Kobayashi et al. (2019), Figure 11 of Prieto-Márquez et al. (2019), Figure 9 of Zhang et al. (2019), Figure 5 of Zhang et al. (2020), Figure 7 of Kobayashi et al. (2021), and Figure 10 of Longrich et al. (2021).\n\nComposition. Under the primary reference phylogeny, Edmontosaurini comprises Edmontosaurus spp., Kerberosaurus manakini, Kundurosaurus nagornyi, and Shantungosaurus giganteus.\n\nSynonyms. No other taxon names are currently in use for the same or approximate clade.\n\nComments. The name Edmontosaurini has been (informally) defined before (Sereno, 2005; Xing et al., 2014). Sereno (2005) applied the maximum-clade definition and used Edmontosaurus regalis as the internal specifier and Maiasaura peeblesorum and Saurolophus osborni as the external specifiers. In turn, Xing et al. (2014) applied a minimum-clade definition, with Edmontosaurus and Kerberosaurus as the internal specifiers. We formalize a maximum-clade definition similar to that of Sereno (2005) but replace M. peeblesorum with Brachylophosaurus canadensis, as the representative of Brachylophosaurini, and further add Kritosaurus navajovius and Hadrosaurus foulkii.\n\nElasmaria Calvo, Porfiri & Novas, 2007 (converted clade name)\n\nRegistration number: 609\n\nDefinition. The smallest clade containing Macrogryphosaurus gondwanicus Calvo, Porfiri & Novas, 2007 and Talenkauen santacrucensis Novas, Cambiaso & Ambrosio, 2004, provided that it does not include Hypsilophodon foxii Huxley, 1869, Iguanodon bernissartensis Boulenger in Beneden, 1881, or Thescelosaurus neglectus Gilmore, 1913. This is a minimum-clade definition. Abbreviated definition: min ∇ (Macrogryphosaurus gondwanicus Calvo, Porfiri & Novas, 2007 & Talenkauen santacrucensis Novas, Cambiaso & Ambrosio, 2004 | ~ Hypsilophodon foxii Huxley, 1869 ∨ Iguanodon bernissartensis Boulenger in Beneden, 1881 ∨ Thescelosaurus neglectus Gilmore, 1913).\n\nReference phylogeny. Figure 31 of Rozadilla, Agnolín & Novas, 2019 is treated here as the primary reference phylogeny. Additional reference phylogenies include Figure 4 of Madzia, Boyd & Mazuch (2018), Figure 26 of Herne et al. (2019), Figure 2 of Dieudonné et al. (2020), and Figure 57 of Barta & Norell (2021).\n\nComposition. Under the primary reference phylogeny, Elasmaria comprises Anabisetia saldiviai, Atlascopcosaurus loadsi, Fulgurotherium austral, Gasparinisaura cincosaltensis, Kangnasaurus coetzeei, Macrogryphosaurus gondwanicus, Morrosaurus antarcticus, Notohypsilophodon comodorensis, Quantassaurus intrepidus, and Trinisaura santamartaensis.\n\nSynonyms. No other taxon names are currently in use for the same or approximate clade.\n\nComments. The name Elasmaria has been (informally) defined before (Calvo, Porfiri & Novas, 2007; Herne et al., 2019). The definition proposed by Calvo, Porfiri & Novas (2007) was minimum-clade, while the definition of Herne et al. (2019) was maximum-clade. However, both studies used Talenkauen santacrucensis and Macrogryphosaurus gondwanicus as the internal specifiers. Herne et al. (2019) proposed to add Iguanodon bernissartensis and Hypsilophodon foxii as the external specifiers to maintain the use of the name Elasmaria to the ‘traditional’ contents under a hypothesis in which one of the internal specifiers was reconstructed, for example, closer to iguanodontians. We keep the use of a minimum-clade definition (as first proposed for the name). However, even though all phylogenetic analyses consistently reconstruct close relationships between T. santacrucensis and M. gondwanicus, we follow Herne et al. (2019) in that the unsettled placement of elasmarians on the neornithischian phylogenetic tree warrants addition of external specifiers. We include Iguanodon bernissartensis and Hypsilophodon foxii as the external specifiers (following Herne et al., 2019) and further add a third external specifier, Thescelosaurus neglectus, to reflect that elasmarians were already inferred as a clade within Thescelosaurinae, as the sister taxon to Thescelosaurus spp. (Boyd, 2015).\n\nEucentrosaura Chiba et al., 2018 (converted clade name)\n\nRegistration number: 688\n\nDefinition. The smallest clade containing Centrosaurus apertus Lambe, 1905 and Pachyrhinosaurus canadensis Sternberg, 1950. This is a minimum-clade definition. Abbreviated definition: min ∇ (Centrosaurus apertus Lambe, 1905 & Pachyrhinosaurus canadensis Sternberg, 1950).\n\nReference phylogeny. Figure 9 of Chiba et al. (2018) is treated here as the primary reference phylogeny. Additional reference phylogenies include Figure 7 of Fiorillo & Tykoski (2012), Figure 10 of Ryan et al. (2017), Figure 13 of Dalman et al. (2018), and Figure 23 of Dalman et al. (2021).\n\nComposition. Under the primary reference phylogeny, Eucentrosaura comprises members of the clades Centrosaurini and Pachyrhinosaurini.\n\nSynonyms. No other taxon names are currently in use for the same or approximate clade.\n\nComments. The name was first (informally) defined by Chiba et al. (2018) who applied the minimum-clade definition and used Centrosaurus apertus and Pachyrhinosaurus canadensis as the internal specifiers. We formalize this definition.\n\nEuceratopsia (new clade name)\n\nRegistration number: 610\n\nDefinition. The smallest clade containing Leptoceratops gracilis Brown, 1914b, Protoceratops andrewsi Granger & Gregory, 1923, and Triceratops horridus Marsh, 1889. This is a minimum-clade definition. Abbreviated definition: min ∇ (Leptoceratops gracilis Brown, 1914b & Protoceratops andrewsi Granger & Gregory, 1923 & Triceratops horridus Marsh, 1889).\n\nEtymology. Derived from the Greek eu- (true) and formed to show its association to members of Ceratopsia. Note that Euceratopsia does not derive from the name Ceratops Marsh, 1888, and, as such, the taxon does not have to be the internal specifier in the used definition.\n\nReference phylogeny.

Under the primary reference phylogeny, Euceratopsia comprises members of the clades Leptoceratopsidae and Coronosauria.\n\nSynonyms. The name Coronosauria Sereno, 1986 covers the same contents under the topology of You & Dodson (2004). However, see ‘Comments’. No other taxon names are currently in use for the same or approximate clade.\n\nComments. The name Euceratopsia is established for the well-supported node uniting the three latest-diverging clades of ceratopsians – Leptoceratopsidae, Protoceratopsidae, and Ceratopsoidea. The monophyly of the grouping is supported by all recently published phylogenies that infer Euceratopsia to branch into two clades – leptoceratopsids and coronosaurs (protoceratopsids + ceratopsoids). Both these clades comprise representatives that are very close or survived to the Cretaceous/Paleogene mass extinction event (Fowler, 2017: Table S1). It is worth noting that You & Dodson (2004) reconstructed leptoceratopsids to be the sister taxon to Ceratopsoidea, and Protoceratopsidae to be the sister taxon to Leptoceratopsidae + Ceratopsoidea. Under such topology, Euceratopsia becomes a heterodefinitional synonym of Coronosauria, with the latter having priority.\n\nEuhadrosauria Weishampel, Norman & Grigorescu, 1993 (converted clade name)\n\nRegistration number: 611\n\nDefinition. The smallest clade containing Lambeosaurus lambei Parks, 1923 and Saurolophus osborni Brown, 1912, provided that it does not include Hadrosaurus foulkii Leidy, 1858. This is a minimum-clade definition. Abbreviated definition: min ∇ (Lambeosaurus lambei Parks, 1923 & Saurolophus osborni Brown, 1912 | ~ Hadrosaurus foulkii Leidy, 1858).\n\nReference phylogeny.

Under the primary reference phylogeny, Euhadrosauria comprises members of the clades Saurolophinae and Lambeosaurinae.\n\nSynonyms. The name Hadrosauridae Cope, 1869 is an approximate synonym of Euhadrosauria. If Hadrosaurus foulkii nests within the smallest clade containing Saurolophus osborni and Lambeosaurus lambei, and within the ‘Saurolophus branch’ of the clade (see the entry for the name Saurolophinae), the name Hadrosauridae is used for the node instead, and Euhadrosauria becomes inapplicable. Additionally, the name Saurolophidae has been used for the same contents as well (see ‘Comments’).\n\nComments. The history and application of Euhadrosauria is complicated and has been thoroughly described and discussed by Madzia, Jagt & Mulder (2020: 14–16). We therefore refer to that study for details.\n\nEuiguanodontia Coria & Salgado, 1996 (converted clade name)\n\nRegistration number: 612\n\nDefinition. The smallest clade containing Camptosaurus dispar (Marsh, 1879), Dryosaurus altus (Marsh, 1878), and Gasparinisaura cincosaltensis Coria & Salgado, 1996, provided that it does not include Tenontosaurus tilletti Ostrom, 1970. This is a minimum-clade definition.

Figure 13 of Coria & Salgado (1996) is treated here as the primary reference phylogeny.\n\nComposition. Under the primary reference phylogeny, Euiguanodontia comprises Gasparinisaura and members of the clades Dryosauridae and Ankylopollexia.\n\nSynonyms. No other taxon names are currently in use for the same or approximate clade.\n\nComments. The name Euiguanodontia is applicable only on the condition that G. cincosaltensis, D. altus, and C. dispar form a clade exclusive of T. tilletti, as originally used by Coria & Salgado (1996). We follow the definition advocated by Madzia, Boyd & Mazuch (2018: Appendix 1) and refer to that study for additional comments. Note also that Euiguanodontia must be a subclade of Iguanodontia under the proposed definition because T. tilletti is an internal specifier in the definition of the name. Finally, note that the internal specifiers Dryosaurus altus and Camptosaurus dispar are not included in the primary reference phylogeny. The former belongs to Dryosauridae (e.g., Madzia, Boyd & Mazuch, 2018), while the latter is part of Ankylopollexia (see, e.g., Madzia, Jagt & Mulder, 2020). Both these clades are indicated on Figure 13 of Coria & Salgado (1996).\n\nEuornithopoda Sereno, 1986 (converted clade name)\n\nRegistration number: 613\n\nDefinition. The largest clade within Ornithopoda containing Iguanodon bernissartensis Boulenger in Beneden, 1881 but not Heterodontosaurus tucki Crompton & Charig, 1962. This is a maximum-clade definition. Abbreviated definition: max ∇ ∈ Ornithopoda (Iguanodon bernissartensis Boulenger in Beneden, 1881 ~ Heterodontosaurus tucki Crompton & Charig, 1962).\n\nReference phylogeny. Figure 1 of Sereno (1999) is treated here as the primary reference phylogeny.\n\nComposition. Under the primary reference phylogeny, Euornithopoda comprises Tenontosaurus spp. and members of the clades Ankylopollexia, Dryosauridae, and Hypsilophodontidae.\n\nSynonyms. No other taxon names are currently in use for the same or approximate clade.\n\nComments. The name Euornithopoda has been (informally) defined before (Sereno, 1998; Sereno, 2005). These definitions were maximum-clade and used Parasaurolophus as the internal specifier and Heterodontosaurus tucki, Pachycephalosaurus wyomingensis, Triceratops horridus, and Ankylosaurus magniventris (Sereno, 2005) as the external specifiers. Here we define the name Euornithopoda using a similar maximum-clade definition as that of Sereno (1998) but replace Parasaurolophus with Iguanodon bernissartensis. Also, by including the part “within Ornithopoda” in the definition, we restrict the use of Euornithopoda to the branch only when Heterodontosaurus tucki represents an ornithopod (see Article 11.14 of the ICPN), thus maintaining the ‘traditional’ use (Sereno, 1998; Sereno, 2005).\n\nEurypoda Sereno, 1986 (converted clade name)\n\nRegistration number: 614\n\nDefinition. The smallest clade containing Ankylosaurus magniventris Brown, 1908 and Stegosaurus stenops Marsh, 1887. This is a minimum-clade definition. Abbreviated definition: min ∇ (Ankylosaurus magniventris Brown, 1908 & Stegosaurus stenops Marsh, 1887).\n\nReference phylogeny. Figure 3 of Thompson et al. (2012) is treated here as the primary reference phylogeny. Additional reference phylogenies include Figure 16 of Han et al. (2018) and Figure 1 of Dieudonné et al. (2020).\n\nComposition. Under the primary reference phylogeny, Eurypoda comprises members of the clades Ankylosauria and Stegosauria.\n\nSynonyms. No other taxon names are currently in use for the same or approximate clade.\n\nComments. The name Eurypoda has been (informally) defined before by Sereno (1998) who used Ankylosaurus and Stegosaurus as the internal specifiers. Since Eurypoda has never been proposed an alternative use, we formalize this definition. Note that the internal specifier Stegosaurus stenops is not included in the primary reference phylogeny. The taxon is most closely related to the clade comprising the operational taxonomic units (OTUs) Stegosaurus armatus (nomen dubium according to Galton, 2010; S. armatus has long been the type species of Stegosaurus but was replaced by S. stenops as the type through an ICZN ruling (International Commission on Zoological Nomenclature, 2013)) and Huayangosaurus taibaii (see, e.g., Maidment et al., 2020).\n\nGenasauria Sereno, 1986 (converted clade name)\n\nRegistration number: 615\n\nDefinition. The smallest clade containing Ankylosaurus magniventris Brown, 1908, Iguanodon bernissartensis Boulenger in Beneden, 1881, Stegosaurus stenops Marsh, 1887, and Triceratops horridus Marsh, 1889. This is a minimum-clade definition. Abbreviated definition: min ∇ (Ankylosaurus magniventris Brown, 1908 & Iguanodon bernissartensis Boulenger in Beneden, 1881 & Stegosaurus stenops Marsh, 1887 & Triceratops horridus Marsh, 1889).\n\nReference phylogeny. Figure 16 of Han et al. (2018) is treated here as the primary reference phylogeny. Additional reference phylogenies include Figure 4 of Madzia, Boyd & Mazuch (2018), Figure 25 of Herne et al. (2019), Figure 1 of Dieudonné et al. (2020), Figure 12 of Yang et al. (2020), and Figure 57 of Barta & Norell (2021).\n\nComposition. Under the primary reference phylogeny, Genasauria comprises members of the clades Neornithischia and Thyreophora.\n\nSynonyms. No other taxon names are currently in use for the same or approximate clade.\n\nComments. The name Genasauria has been (informally) defined before (Currie & Padian, 1997; Sereno, 1998; Sereno, 2005; Butler, Upchurch & Norman, 2008). These definitions were minimum-clade and used Thyreophora and Cerapoda (Currie & Padian, 1997), Ankylosaurus and Triceratops (Sereno, 1998), Ankylosaurus magniventris, Triceratops horridus, and Parasaurolophus walkeri (Sereno, 2005), and Ankylosaurus magniventris, Stegosaurus stenops, Triceratops horridus, Parasaurolophus walkeri, and Pachycephalosaurus wyomingensis (Butler, Upchurch & Norman, 2008) as the internal specifiers. In order to maintain the ‘traditional’ concept of Genasauria as a clade comprising Neornithischia and Thyreophora, the internal specifiers in the definition of Genasauria are used from among the taxa representing the four major subclades – Ornithopoda (Iguanodon bernissartensis), Marginocephalia (Triceratops horridus), Ankylosauria (Ankylosaurus magniventris), and Stegosauria (Stegosaurus stenops). Addition of P. wyomingensis as another internal specifier (to include representatives of both marginocephalian clades – Ceratopsia and Pachycephalosauria) is considered unnecessary because pachycephalosaurs have always been inferred to be part of Genasauria as defined herein. Note that the internal specifiers Ankylosaurus magniventris and Triceratops horridus are not included in the primary reference phylogeny. The former belongs to Ankylosauria within Thyreophora (see, e.g., Thompson et al., 2012), while the latter is part of Ceratopsia (e.g., Morschhauser et al., 2019).\n\nHadrosauridae Cope, 1869 (converted clade name)\n\nRegistration number: 616\n\nDefinition. The smallest clade containing Hadrosaurus foulkii Leidy, 1858, Lambeosaurus lambei Parks, 1923, and Saurolophus osborni Brown, 1912. This is a minimum-clade definition. Abbreviated definition: min ∇ (Hadrosaurus foulkii Leidy, 1858 & Lambeosaurus lambei Parks, 1923 & Saurolophus osborni Brown, 1912).\n\nReference phylogeny. Figure 18 of Prieto-Márquez, Wagner & Lehman (2020) is treated here as the primary reference phylogeny. Additional reference phylogenies include Figure 5 of Kobayashi et al. (2019), Figure 11 of Prieto-Márquez et al. (2019), Figure 9 of Zhang et al. (2019), Figure 5 of Zhang et al. (2020), Figure 7 of Kobayashi et al. (2021), and Figure 10 of Longrich et al. (2021).\n\nComposition. Under the primary reference phylogeny, Hadrosauridae comprises Hadrosaurus foulkii, Eotrachodon orientalis, Latirhinus uitstlani, Aquilarhinus palimentus, and members of the clade Euhadrosauria.\n\nSynonyms. Several taxon names have been historically or recently used as approximate synonyms of Hadrosauridae. Of these, only the names Saurolophidae and Euhadrosauria have recently been attributed to a clade of the same or a similar composition (e.g., Prieto-Márquez, 2010; Verdú et al., 2018; Zhang et al., 2019; Madzia, Jagt & Mulder, 2020; Prieto-Márquez, Wagner & Lehman, 2020; Verdú et al., 2020; Zhang et al., 2020; Kobayashi et al., 2021; Ramírez-Velasco et al., 2021). See ‘Comments’ below.\n\nComments. The use of Hadrosauridae and other names applied to the same or similar clades (Saurolophidae and Euhadrosauria) have been thoroughly described and discussed by Madzia, Jagt & Mulder (2020: 14–16) who recommended to use Hadrosauridae for the smallest clade containing H. foulkii, S. osborni, and L. lambei; Euhadrosauria for the smallest clade containing S. osborni and L. lambei; and to abandon Saurolophidae. Note that under some phylogenies, in which H. foulkii is reconstructed within the smallest clade containing S. osborni and L. lambei, the names Hadrosauridae and Euhadrosauria, as (informally) defined by Madzia, Jagt & Mulder (2020), become heterodefinitional synonyms. Although such option may still be viewed acceptable, we decided to apply a minimum-clade definition for Euhadrosauria that makes the name inapplicable under such hypothesis.\n\nHadrosauriformes Sereno, 1997 (converted clade name)\n\nRegistration number: 617\n\nDefinition. The smallest clade containing Hadrosaurus foulkii Leidy, 1858 and Iguanodon bernissartensis Boulenger in Beneden, 1881. This is a minimum-clade definition. Abbreviated definition: min ∇ (Hadrosaurus foulkii Leidy, 1858 & Iguanodon bernissartensis Boulenger in Beneden, 1881).\n\nReference phylogeny. Figure 12 of Madzia, Jagt & Mulder (2020) is treated here as the primary reference phylogeny. Additional reference phylogenies include Figure 20 of Verdú et al. (2018), Figure 3 of Párraga & Prieto-Márquez (2019), Figure 8 of Słowiak et al. (2020), Figure 9 of Verdú et al. (2020) and Figure 11 of McDonald et al. (2021).\n\nComposition. Under the primary reference phylogeny, Hadrosauriformes comprises members of the clades Iguanodontidae and Hadrosauroidea.\n\nSynonyms. If Hypselospinus fittoni nests within the smallest clade containing Hadrosaurus foulkii and Iguanodon bernissartensis, the name Hadrosauriformes is a potential heterodefinitional synonym of Neoiguanodontia (see the name entry). In such case, the name Hadrosauriformes should have priority. The name Iguanodontoidea Hay, 1902 has been also used as an approximate synonym (Sereno, 1986; Norman, 2002). Note that Norman (2002) used Iguanodontoidea for a clade “(s)erially more derived than Camptosaurus” (Norman, 2002: 138) and defined it as “Iguanodon and all iguanodontians more closely related to Edmontosaurus than to Camptosaurus”. Such definition would make Iguanodontoidea applicable for the same clade as Styracosterna (see the name entry). However, Figure 35 of Norman (2002) shows that the name does not cover Lurdusaurus, which should be included within the clade under such maximum-clade definition. Since Norman (2002) considers Iguanodontoidea to be a synonym of Hadrosauriformes of Sereno (1997, 1998, 1999), it is apparent that Norman (2002) concept of Iguanodontoidea would be more similar to that of Hadrosauriformes rather than Styracosterna.\n\nComments. The name Hadrosauriformes has been (informally) defined before (Sereno, 1998; Norman, 2015; Madzia, Jagt & Mulder, 2020). However, only Madzia, Jagt & Mulder (2020: Table 1) included the mandatory H. foulkii as the internal specifier. We formalize the definition of Madzia, Jagt & Mulder (2020).\n\nHadrosaurinae Lambe, 1918 (converted clade name)\n\nRegistration number: 618\n\nDefinition. The largest clade containing Hadrosaurus foulkii Leidy, 1858 but not Lambeosaurus lambei Parks, 1923. This is a maximum-clade definition.

(2019) is treated here as the primary reference phylogeny. Additional reference phylogenies include Figure 13 of Cruzado-Caballero & Powell (2017), Figure 20 of Xing, Mallon & Currie (2017), Figure 5 of Zhang et al. (2020), and Figure 10 of Longrich et al. (2021).\n\nComposition. Under the primary reference phylogeny, Hadrosaurinae comprises Hadrosaurus foulkii and members of the clades Brachylophosaurini, Edmontosaurini, Kritosaurini, and Saurolophini.\n\nSynonyms. The name Saurolophinae Brown, 1914a has been recently used for the same clade (under the hypothesis in which H. foulkii is nested outside the smallest clade containing Saurolophus osborni and Lambeosaurus lambei). See the entry for the name Saurolophinae.\n\nComments. The name Hadrosaurinae has been (informally) defined before by (Sereno, 1998; Sereno, 2005). Sereno (1998) applied the maximum-clade definition and used Saurolophus as the internal specifier and Parasaurolophus as the external specifier. In turn, Sereno (2005), apparently erroneously, defined Hadrosaurinae as pertaining to “(t)he most inclusive taxon containing Saurolophus osborni Brown, 1912 and Parasaurolophus walkeri Parks, 1922 and including Hadrosaurus foulkii Leidy, 1858”. Our formal maximum-clade definition was formed to make Hadrosaurinae applicable regardless of whether the taxon lies ouside or within the smallest clade containing Saurolophus osborni and Lambeosaurus lambei.\n\nHadrosauroidea von Huene, 1952 (converted clade name)\n\nRegistration number: 619\n\nDefinition.

No other taxon names are currently in use for the same or approximate clade.\n\nComments. The name Hadrosauroidea was first (informally) defined by Sereno (1998: 62) who used the maximum-clade definition and Parasaurolophus walkeri as the internal specifier and Iguanodon bernissartensis as the external specifier. We formalize the definition of Madzia, Jagt & Mulder (2020: Table 1) who replaced P. walkeri with H. foulkii.\n\nHadrosauromorpha Norman, 2014 (converted clade name)\n\nRegistration number: 620\n\nDefinition.

No other taxon names are currently in use for the same or approximate clade.\n\nComments. Hadrosauromorpha was first (informally) defined by Norman (2014: 32) who used the maximum-clade definition and Parasaurolophus walkeri as the internal specifier and Probactrosaurus gobiensis as the external specifier.

Under the primary reference phylogeny, Heterodontosauridae comprises Abrictosaurus consors, Echinodon becklesii, Eocursor parvus, Fruitadens haagarorum, Heterodontosaurus tucki, Lycorhinus angustidens, Manidens condorensis, Pegomastax africana, and Tianyulong confuciusi.\n\nSynonyms. No other taxon names are currently in use for the same or approximate clade.\n\nComments. We follow Sereno (2012) in recognizing Kuhn (1966), rather than Romer (1966), as the author establishing Heterodontosauridae. The name Heterodontosauridae has been (informally) defined before (Sereno, 1998; Sereno, 2005). These definitions were maximum-clade and used Heterodontosaurus as the internal specifier and Parasaurolophus (Sereno, 1998) or Parasaurolophus walkeri, Pachycephalosaurus wyomingensis, Triceratops horridus, and Ankylosaurus magniventris (Sereno, 2005) as the external specifiers. We apply the name Heterodontosauridae for the same known contents; adopting the mandatory Heterodontosaurus tucki as the internal specifier and representatives of all major ornithischian lineages, Ceratopsia (Triceratops horridus), Ornithopoda (Iguanodon bernissartensis), Pachycephalosauria (Pachycephalosaurus wyomingensis), and Thyreophora (Stegosaurus stenops), as the external specifiers. Note that the external specifiers Pachycephalosaurus wyomingensis, Stegosaurus stenops, and Triceratops horridus are not included in the primary reference phylogeny. P. wyomingensis and T. horridus belong to Marginocephalia that is indicated on Figure 4 of Madzia, Boyd & Mazuch (2018), while S. stenops is nested within Thyreophora (e.g., Maidment et al., 2020).\n\nHuayangosauridae Dong, Tang & Zhou, 1982 (converted clade name)\n\nRegistration number: 623\n\nDefinition.

No other taxon names are currently in use for the same or approximate clade.\n\nComments. The name Huayangosauridae was first (informally) defined by Galton & Upchurch (2004: 358) who used the maximum-clade definition and selected Huayangosaurus as the internal specifier and Stegosaurus as the external specifier. We formalize this definition.\n\nHypsilophodontia Cooper, 1985 (converted clade name)\n\nRegistration number: 624\n\nDefinition. The smallest clade within Ornithopoda containing Hypsilophodon foxii Huxley, 1869 and Tenontosaurus tilletti Ostrom, 1970, provided that it does not include Iguanodon bernissartensis Boulenger in Beneden, 1881. This is a minimum-clade definition. Abbreviated definition: min ∇ ∈ Ornithopoda (Hypsilophodon foxii Huxley, 1869 & Tenontosaurus tilletti Ostrom, 1970 | ~ Iguanodon bernissartensis Boulenger in Beneden, 1881).\n\nReference phylogeny. Figure 50 of Norman (2015) is treated here as the primary reference phylogeny.\n\nComposition. Under the primary reference phylogeny, Hypsilophodontia comprises Hypsilophodon foxii, Tenontosaurus spp., and members of the clade Rhabdodontidae. However, see ‘Comments’ below for discussion of potential alternative composition of Clypeodonta.\n\nSynonyms. No other taxon names are currently in use for the same or approximate clade.\n\nComments. The name Hypsilophodontia was (informally) defined as pertaining to “Hypsilophodon foxii, Tenontosaurus tilletti, their most recent common ancestor, and all of its descendants” (Norman, 2015: 171). However, such definition does not reflect alternative topologies that do not support Hypsilophodontia as reconstructed by Norman (2015), making it applicable for markedly different contents (see, e.g., Madzia, Boyd & Mazuch, 2018: Fig. 4).\n\nHere we define the name Hypsilophodontia using a similar minimum-clade definition as that of Norman (2015) but by including the part “within Ornithopoda” in the definition, and adding an external specifier, we restrict the use of Hypsilophodontia to the node only when H. foxii represents an ornithopod (see Article 11.14 of the ICPN) and when Hypsilophodon foxii and Tenontosaurus tilletti are more closely related to each other than either is to I. bernissartensis, following the original intent of Norman (2015). Note that the internal specifier Tenontosaurus tilletti is not indicated in the primary reference phylogeny. The taxon is the type species of Tenontosaurus Ostrom, 1970 and is comprised there within the ‘tenontosaurs’.\n\nHypsilophodontidae Dollo, 1882 (converted clade name)\n\nRegistration number: 625\n\nDefinition. The largest clade containing Hypsilophodon foxii Huxley, 1869 but not Iguanodon bernissartensis Boulenger in Beneden, 1881 and Rhabdodon priscus Matheron, 1869. This is a maximum-clade definition. Abbreviated definition: max ∇ (Hypsilophodon foxii Huxley, 1869 ~ Iguanodon bernissartensis Boulenger in Beneden, 1881 & Rhabdodon priscus Matheron, 1869).\n\nReference phylogeny. Figure 2 of Dieudonné et al. (2020) is treated here as the primary reference phylogeny.\n\nComposition. Under the primary reference phylogeny, Hypsilophodontidae comprises Hypsilophodon foxii, Gasparinisaura cincosaltensis, and Parksosaurus warreni.\n\nSynonyms. The name Parksosaurinae has been recently for the same contents (Yang et al., 2020), and attributed (apparently following the Principle of Coordination) to Buchholz (2002). No other taxon names are currently in use for the same or approximate clade.\n\nComments. Hypsilophodontidae was first (informally) defined by Sereno (1998: 61) who used the maximum-clade definition and Hypsilophodon foxii as the internal specifier and Parasaurolophus walkeri as the external specifier. Here we use the same type of definition but replace P. walkeri with I. bernissartensis. This taxon has always been considered outside Hypsilophodontidae. Additionally, we include Rhabdodon priscus as a second external specifier to prevent the inclusion of Rhabdodontidae within Hypsilophodontidae under the topology of Norman (2015: Fig. 50).\n\nIguanodontia Baur, 1891 (converted clade name)\n\nRegistration number: 626\n\nDefinition. The smallest clade containing Dryosaurus altus (Marsh, 1878), Iguanodon bernissartensis Boulenger in Beneden, 1881, Rhabdodon priscus Matheron, 1869, and Tenontosaurus tilletti Ostrom, 1970, provided that it does not include Hypsilophodon foxii Huxley, 1869. This is a minimum-clade definition. Abbreviated definition: min ∇ (Dryosaurus altus (Marsh, 1878) & Iguanodon bernissartensis Boulenger in Beneden, 1881 & Rhabdodon priscus Matheron, 1869 & Tenontosaurus tilletti Ostrom, 1970 | ~ Hypsilophodon foxii Huxley, 1869).\n\nReference phylogeny. Figure 12 of Madzia, Jagt & Mulder (2020) is treated here as the primary reference phylogeny. Additional reference phylogenies include Figure 16 of Han et al. (2018), Figure 20 of Verdú et al. (2018), Figure 25 of Herne et al. (2019), and Figure 9 of Verdú et al. (2020).\n\nComposition. Under the primary reference phylogeny, Iguanodontia comprises members of the clade Rhabdodontomorpha, Tenontosaurus spp., and Dryomorpha.\n\nSynonyms. No other taxon names are currently in use for the same or approximate clade. Clypeodonta, as reconstructed by Norman (2015) covers a similar taxic composition; though the topology of Norman (2015) differs from that of the primary phylogeny of Iguanodontia significantly.\n\nComments. The application of Iguanodontia has been described and discussed by Madzia, Boyd & Mazuch (2018: Appendix 1) and Madzia, Jagt & Mulder (2020: Table 1). We therefore refer to these studies for details. Our definition differs from that advocated by Madzia, Boyd & Mazuch (2018) and Madzia, Jagt & Mulder (2020) in that the name is newly applicable only if it is used for a clade that does not include Hypsilophodon foxii (e.g., it becomes inapplicable under the topology of Norman, 2015: Fig. 50).\n\nIguanodontidae Bonaparte, 1850 (converted clade name)\n\nRegistration number: 627\n\nDefinition. The largest clade containing Iguanodon bernissartensis Boulenger in Beneden, 1881 but not Hadrosaurus foulkii Leidy, 1858. This is a maximum-clade definition. Abbreviated definition: max ∇ (Iguanodon bernissartensis Boulenger in Beneden, 1881 ~ Hadrosaurus foulkii Leidy, 1858).\n\nReference phylogeny. Figure 13 of Madzia, Jagt & Mulder (2020) is treated here as the primary reference phylogeny. Additional reference phylogenies include Figure 3 of Madzia, Boyd & Mazuch (2018), Figure 20 of Verdú et al. (2018), Figure 32 of Tsogtbaatar et al. (2019), Figure 7 of Kobayashi et al. (2021), and Figure 11 of Santos-Cubedo et al. (2021).\n\nComposition. Under the primary reference phylogeny, Iguanodontidae comprises Barilium dawsoni, Iguanodon bernissartensis, Iguanodon galvensis, and Lurdusaurus arenatus.\n\nSynonyms. The name Iguanodontoidea Hay, 1902 is an approximate synonym of Iguanodontidae (see, e.g., Figure 20 of Verdú et al., 2018). Both these names have been used for various sets of taxa thought or reconstructed to be more closely related to Iguanodon bernissartensis than to hadrosaurids. Considering that significant differences exist between phylogeny reconstructions of Iguanodon-grade ornithopods (e.g., Madzia, Boyd & Mazuch, 2018; Verdú et al., 2018; Madzia, Jagt & Mulder, 2020; McDonald et al., 2021), it is difficult to link either of the names to a certain, stable composition. Here, we prefer to apply the name Iguanodontidae because it is more frequent in the literature and because it was coined 52 years before Iguanodontoidea. It is worth noting that the name Iguanodontoidea has been also used as an approximate synonym of Hadrosauriformes (see the name entry).\n\nComments. The name Iguanodontidae was first (informally) defined before (Sereno, 1998; Sereno, 2005; Santos-Cubedo et al., 2021). These definitions were maximum-clade and used Iguanodon bernissartensis as the internal specifier and Parasaurolophus walkeri (Sereno, 1998; Sereno, 2005) or Corythosaurus casuarius (Santos-Cubedo et al., 2021) as the external specifier. We apply a similar definition but replace P. walkeri/Corythosaurus casuarius with H. foulkii. Note that even though the study of Santos-Cubedo et al. (2021) appeared after the publication of Phylonyms (de Queiroz, Cantino & Gauthier, 2020), the work does not meet the general requirements for establishing Iguanodontidae as a phylogenetically defined clade name (see Articles 7 of the ICPN), nor it provides anything that would indicate such intention. Specifically, the name Iguanodontidae is not explicitly designated as a converted clade name, no bibliographic citations demonstrating prior application of the name to a taxon approximating the clade for which it is being established have been provided (including the authorship of the preexisting name), and no evidence is provided that the required information has been submitted to the registration database for phylogenetically defined names, the RegNum (registration number is missing). The study specifies the phylogenetic information, such as the placement of the clade on the ornithopod tree and the distribution of apomorphies supporting the existence of the clade, and presents the hypothesized composition of the clade. This information alone, however, would not be sufficient for the name Iguanodontidae to be established as a converted clade name, as required by the ICPN.\n\nJeholosauridae Han et al., 2012 (converted clade name)\n\nRegistration number: 628\n\nDefinition. The largest clade outside Hypsilophodontidae or Thescelosauridae containing Jeholosaurus shangyuanensis Xu, Wang & You, 2000 but not Hypsilophodon foxii Huxley, 1869, Iguanodon bernissartensis Boulenger in Beneden, 1881, Pachycephalosaurus wyomingensis (Gilmore, 1931), Thescelosaurus neglectus Gilmore, 1913, and Triceratops horridus Marsh, 1889. This is a maximum-clade definition. Abbreviated definition: max ∇ ∉ Hypsilophodontidae ∨ Thescelosauridae (Jeholosaurus shangyuanensis Xu, Wang & You 2000 ~ Hypsilophodon foxii Huxley, 1869 & Iguanodon bernissartensis Boulenger in Beneden, 1881 & Pachycephalosaurus wyomingensis (Gilmore, 1931) & Thescelosaurus neglectus Gilmore, 1913 & Triceratops horridus Marsh, 1889).\n\nReference phylogeny. Figure 25 of Herne et al. (2019) is treated here as the primary reference phylogeny. Additional reference phylogenies include Figure 16 of Han et al. (2018), Figure 4 of Madzia, Boyd & Mazuch (2018), and Figure 57 of Barta & Norell (2021).\n\nComposition. Under the primary reference phylogeny, Jeholosauridae comprises Changchunsaurus parvus, Haya griva, and Jeholosaurus shangyuanensis. Under alternative hypotheses, however, Jeholosauridae includes Jeholosaurus shangyuanensis and Yueosaurus tiantaiensis (e.g., Madzia, Boyd & Mazuch, 2018: Fig. 4; Barta & Norell, 2021: Fig. 57).\n\nSynonyms. The name Jeholosaurinae has been used recently for the same contents (Yang et al., 2020), and attributed (apparently following the Principle of Coordination) to Han et al. (2012). No other taxon names are currently in use for the same or approximate clade.\n\nComments. We use a maximum-clade definition similar to that of Han et al. (2012), which is the only definition (informally) used for Jeholosauridae. Our definition differs in that we replaced the original representative of Ceratopsia (Protoceratops andrewsi) with a taxon that is widely used in phylogenetic definitions of ornithischian clade names (Triceratops horridus). Additionally, our definition prevents the use of Jeholosauridae under the potential hypotheses in which Jeholosaurus is inferred as part of Hypsilophodontidae or Thescelosauridae. Note that the internal specifiers Pachycephalosaurus wyomingensis and Triceratops horridus are not included in the primary reference phylogeny. The former belongs to Pachycephalosauria (see, e.g., Dieudonné et al., 2020), while the latter is part of Ceratopsia (e.g., Morschhauser et al., 2019), both within Marginocephalia that is indicated on Figure 25 of Herne et al. (2019).\n\nKritosaurini Glut, 1997 (converted clade name)\n\nRegistration number: 629\n\nDefinition. The largest clade containing Kritosaurus navajovius Brown, 1910 but not Brachylophosaurus canadensis Sternberg, 1953, Edmontosaurus regalis Lambe, 1917, Hadrosaurus foulkii Leidy, 1858, and Saurolophus osborni Brown, 1912. This is a maximum-clade definition. Abbreviated definition: max ∇ (Kritosaurus navajovius Brown, 1910 ~ Brachylophosaurus canadensis Sternberg, 1953 & Edmontosaurus regalis Lambe, 1917 & Hadrosaurus foulkii Leidy, 1858 & Saurolophus osborni Brown, 1912).\n\nReference phylogeny. Figure 18 of Prieto-Márquez, Wagner & Lehman (2020) is treated here as the primary reference phylogeny. Additional reference phylogenies include Figure 5 of Kobayashi et al. (2019), Figure 11 of Prieto-Márquez et al. (2019), Figure 9 of Zhang et al. (2019), Figure 5 of Zhang et al. (2020), Figure 7 of Kobayashi et al. (2021), and Figure 10 of Longrich et al. (2021).\n\nComposition. Under the primary reference phylogeny Kritosaurini comprises Gryposaurus spp., Kritosaurus spp., Rhinorex condrupus, Secernosaurus koerneri, and the specimen ‘Big Bend UTEP 37.7’.\n\nSynonyms. No other taxon names are currently in use for the same or approximate clade.\n\nComments. The study of Lapparent & Lavocat (1955) has been cited to be the reference establishing the name Kritosaurini (e.g., Prieto-Márquez, 2014). However, Lapparent & Lavocat (1955) used ‘Kritosaurinés’ rather than ‘Kritosaurini’. The name Kritosaurini was then used by Brett-Surman (1989) and by Glut (1997). Since Brett-Surman (1989) is an unpublished doctoral dissertation, we consider Glut (1997) to be the earliest publication to spell the name Kritosaurini. The name was first (informally) defined by Prieto-Márquez (2014) who applied the minimum-clade definition and used Kritosaurus navajovius, Gryposaurus notabilis, and Naashoibitosaurus ostromi as the internal specifiers. We preserve the original intent of Prieto-Márquez (2014) but prefer to apply the maximum-clade definition. Kritosaurus navajovius is used as the internal specifier and Hadrosaurus foulkii, and representatives of Brachylophosaurini (Brachylophosaurus canadensis), Edmontosaurini (Edmontosaurus regalis), and Saurolophini (Saurolophus osborni), as the external specifiers.\n\nLambeosaurinae Parks, 1923 (converted clade name)\n\nRegistration number: 630\n\nDefinition. The largest clade containing Lambeosaurus lambei Parks, 1923 but not Hadrosaurus foulkii Leidy, 1858 and Saurolophus osborni Brown, 1912. This is a maximum-clade definition. Abbreviated definition: max ∇ (Lambeosaurus lambei Parks, 1923 ~ Hadrosaurus foulkii Leidy, 1858 & Saurolophus osborni Brown, 1912).\n\nReference phylogeny. Figure 18 of Prieto-Márquez, Wagner & Lehman (2020) is treated here as the primary reference phylogeny. Additional reference phylogenies include Figure 5 of Kobayashi et al. (2019), Figure 11 of Prieto-Márquez et al. (2019), Figure 9 of Zhang et al. (2019), Figure 5 of Zhang et al. (2020), Figure 7 of Kobayashi et al. (2021), and Figure 10 of Longrich et al. (2021).\n\nComposition. Under the primary reference phylogeny, Lambeosaurinae comprises Aralosaurus tuberiferus, Canardia garonnensis, Jaxartosaurus aralensis, and members of the clades Corythosauria and Tsintaosaurini.\n\nSynonyms. No other taxon names are currently in use for the same or approximate clade.\n\nComments. The name Lambeosaurinae has been (informally) defined before (Sereno, 1998; Sereno, 2005; Prieto-Márquez, 2010). These definitions were maximum-clade and used Parasaurolophus (Sereno, 1998) or Lambeosaurus lambei (Prieto-Márquez, 2010) as the internal specifiers and Saurolophus (Sereno, 1998) or Hadrosaurus foulkii, Saurolophus osborni, and Edmontosaurus regalis (Prieto-Márquez, 2010) as the external specifiers. Sereno (2005), apparently erroneously, defined Lambeosaurinae as pertaining to “(t)he most inclusive taxon containing Saurolophus osborni Brown, 1912 but not Parasaurolophus walkeri Parks, 1922 and including Lambeosaurus lambei Parks, 1923”. Our formal maximum-clade definition is similar to that of Prieto-Márquez (2010) though we have removed E. regalis from the external specifiers because the taxon is consistently inferred outside Lambeosaurinae (Kobayashi et al., 2019; Prieto-Márquez et al., 2019; Prieto-Márquez, Wagner & Lehman, 2020; Zhang et al., 2019; Zhang et al., 2020; Gates, Evans & Sertich, 2021; Kobayashi et al., 2021; Longrich et al., 2021; Ramírez-Velasco et al., 2021).\n\nLambeosaurini Sullivan et al., 2011 (converted clade name)\n\nRegistration number: 631\n\nDefinition. The largest clade containing Lambeosaurus lambei Parks, 1923 but not Aralosaurus tuberiferus Rozhdestvensky, 1968, Parasaurolophus walkeri Parks, 1922, and Tsintaosaurus spinorhinus Young, 1958. This is a maximum-clade definition. Abbreviated definition: max ∇ (Lambeosaurus lambei Parks, 1923 ~ Aralosaurus tuberiferus Rozhdestvensky, 1968 & Parasaurolophus walkeri Parks, 1922 & Tsintaosaurus spinorhinus Young, 1958).\n\nReference phylogeny. Figure 18 of Prieto-Márquez, Wagner & Lehman (2020) is treated here as the primary reference phylogeny. Additional reference phylogenies include Figure 5 of Kobayashi et al. (2019), Figure 11 of Prieto-Márquez et al. (2019), Figure 9 of Zhang et al. (2019), Figure 5 of Zhang et al. (2020), Figure 7 of Kobayashi et al. (2021), and Figure 10 of Longrich et al. (2021).\n\nComposition. Under the primary reference phylogeny, Lambeosaurini comprises Amurosaurus riabinini, Arenysaurus ardevoli, Blasisaurus canudoi, Corythosaurus spp., Hypacrosaurus stebingeri, Hypacrosaurus altispinus, Lambeosaurus spp., Magnapaulia laticaudus, Olorotitan arharensis (misspelled as ‘ararhensis’ in the primary reference phylogeny), Sahaliyania elunchunorum, and Velafrons coahuilensis.\n\nSynonyms. The name Corythosaurini Glut, 1997 is an approximate synonym of Lambeosaurini (e.g., Evans & Reisz, 2007; Gates et al., 2007; Pereda-Suberbiola et al., 2009). However, its use has been discouraged (Prieto-Márquez et al., 2013) and all recent phylogenetic studies preferred to use Lambeosaurini instead (e.g., Xing, Mallon & Currie, 2017; Kobayashi et al., 2019; Prieto-Márquez et al., 2019; Zhang et al., 2020; Kobayashi et al., 2021; Longrich et al., 2021; Ramírez-Velasco et al., 2021). No other taxon names are currently in use for the same or approximate clade.\n\nComments. Even though Sullivan et al. (2011) did not explicitly formulate the definition of their newly proposed name Lambeosaurini, they noted that their “definition of the Lambeosaurini would be equivalent to node 38 of Prieto-Márquez (2010: fig. 9)” (Sullivan et al., 2011: 417). The name Lambeosaurini was first (informally) defined by Prieto-Márquez et al. (2013) who applied the maximum-clade definition and used Lambeosaurus lambei as the internal specifier and Parasaurolophus walkeri, Tsintaosaurus spinorhinus, and Aralosaurus tuberiferus as the external specifier. Such defined, the use of Lambeosaurini adheres to the original intent of Sullivan et al. (2011). We formalize this definition.\n\nLeptoceratopsidae Nopcsa, 1923 (converted clade name)\n\nRegistration number: 632\n\nDefinition. The largest clade containing Leptoceratops gracilis Brown, 1914b but not Protoceratops andrewsi Granger & Gregory, 1923 and Triceratops horridus Marsh, 1889. This is a maximum-clade definition. Abbreviated definition: max ∇ (Leptoceratops gracilis Brown, 1914b ~ Protoceratops andrewsi Granger & Gregory, 1923 & Triceratops horridus Marsh, 1889).\n\nReference phylogeny. Figure 10 of Morschhauser et al. (2019) is treated here as the primary reference phylogeny. Additional reference phylogenies include Figure S1 of Knapp et al. (2018), Figure 8A of Arbour & Evans (2019), Figure 3 of Yu et al. (2020), and Figure 4 of Yu et al. (2020).\n\nComposition. Under the primary reference phylogeny, Leptoceratopsidae comprises Cerasinops hodgskissi, Gryphoceratops morrisoni, Helioceratops brachygnathus, Ischioceratops zhuchengensis, Koreaceratops hwaseongensis, Leptoceratops gracilis, Montanoceratops cerorhynchus, Prenoceratops pieganensis, Udanoceratops tchizhovi, Unescoceratops koppelhusae, and Zhuchengceratops inexpectus.\n\nSynonyms. No other taxon names are currently in use for the same or approximate clade.\n\nComments. The name Leptoceratopsidae has been (informally) defined before by Makovicky (2001) who used Leptoceratops gracilis as the internal specifier and Triceratops horridus as the external specifier. Since Leptoceratopsidae has never been proposed an alternative use, we formalize a similar definition that differs only in adding Protoceratops andrewsi as a second external specifier.\n\nMarginocephalia Sereno, 1986 (converted clade name)\n\nRegistration number: 633\n\nDefinition. The smallest clade containing Ceratops montanus Marsh, 1888, Pachycephalosaurus wyomingensis (Gilmore, 1931), and Triceratops horridus Marsh, 1889. This is a minimum-clade definition. Abbreviated definition: min ∇ (Ceratops montanus Marsh, 1888 & Pachycephalosaurus wyomingensis (Gilmore, 1931) & Triceratops horridus Marsh, 1889).\n\nReference phylogeny. Figure 16 of Han et al. (2018) is treated here as the primary reference phylogeny. Additional reference phylogenies include Figure 4 of Madzia, Boyd & Mazuch (2018), Figure 25 of Herne et al. (2019), Figure 1 of Dieudonné et al. (2020), Figure 12 of Yang et al. (2020), and Figure 57 of Barta & Norell (2021).\n\nComposition. Under the primary reference phylogeny, Marginocephalia comprises members of the clades Ceratopsia and Pachycephalosauria.\n\nSynonyms. No other taxon names are currently in use for the same or approximate clade.\n\nComments. The name Marginocephalia has been (informally) defined before (Currie & Padian, 1997; Sereno, 1998; Sereno, 2005; Madzia, Boyd & Mazuch, 2018; Herne et al., 2019). These definitions, except for that of Herne et al. (2019), were minimum-clade and used Ceratopsia and Pachycephalosauria (Currie & Padian, 1997) or Triceratops horridus and Pachycephalosaurus wyomingensis (Sereno, 1998; Sereno, 2005; Madzia, Boyd & Mazuch, 2018) as the internal specifiers. Madzia, Boyd & Mazuch (2018) further included Ceratops montanus as a third internal specifier, stating that “(t)he first definition of Marginocephalia was node-based and used ‘Ceratopsia’ and ‘Pachycephalosauria’ as the internal specifiers […]. To follow the definition, and adhere to the ICPN (Art. 11), we have to use name-bearing species or their type specimens as specifiers which makes the name to be anchored on the types of Ceratops montanus and Pachycephalosaurus wyomingensis. Even if C. montanus may be a nomen dubium, its type specimen is unequivocally nested deeply within Ceratopsia and thus its use does not change the extent of the name” (Madzia, Boyd & Mazuch, 2018: Appendix 1). In turn, Herne et al. (2019) preferred a maximum-clade definition with T. horridus and P. wyomingensis as the internal specifiers and Parasaurolophus walkeri as the external specifier, arguing that “(previous) definitions (were) not complementary with present definitions of Cerapoda and Ornithopoda within a node-stem triplet arrangement of clades” and that “re-definition of Marginocephalia as a stem now mirrors its sister stem clade, Ornithopoda, within a node-based Cerapoda. As a result, this stabilization of definition allows for the definitive assignment of all cerapodan OTUs either as ornithopods or marginocephalians” (Herne et al., 2019: Supplemental Text S1: 4). However, Marginocephalia has never formed such ‘triplet’. When its use in a ‘node-branch triplet’ is considered, it is more closely tied with Ceratopsia and Pachycephalosauria rather than with Cerapoda and Ornithopoda. Here, the internal specifiers in the definition of Marginocephalia are used from among the taxa representing the two major subclades – Ceratopsia (Ceratops montanus and Triceratops horridus) and Pachycephalosauria (Pachycephalosaurus wyomingensis). Note that none of the internal specifiers is included in the primary reference phylogeny. Ceratops montanus and Pachycephalosaurus wyomingensis are name-bearers of Ceratopsia and Pachycephalosauria, respectively, and are deeply nested within these clades (e.g., Mallon et al., 2016; Dieudonné et al., 2020). Triceratops horridus is a late-diverging member of Chasmosaurinae within Ceratopsia (e.g., Morschhauser et al., 2019; Fowler & Freedman Fowler, 2020).\n\nNasutoceratopsini Ryan et al., 2017 (converted clade name)\n\nRegistration number: 689\n\nDefinition.

Under the primary reference phylogeny, Nasutoceratopsini comprises Avaceratops lammersi, Nasutoceratops titusi, and the specimens CMN 8804, MOR 692, and the ‘Malta New Taxon’ (GPDM 63). Under an alternative hypothesis, however, Nasutoceratopsini includes only a single unequivocal member, Nasutoceratops titusi (Dalman et al., 2021: Fig. 23).\n\nSynonyms. No other taxon names are currently in use for the same or approximate clade.\n\nComments. The name was first (informally) defined by Ryan et al. (2017) who applied the maximum-clade definition and used Nasutoceratops titusi as the internal specifier and Centrosaurus apertus as the external specifier. We formalize this definition.\n\nNeoceratopsia Sereno, 1986 (converted clade name)\n\nRegistration number: 634\n\nDefinition.

No other taxon names are currently in use for the same or approximate clade.\n\nComments. The name Neoceratopsia has been (informally) defined before by Sereno (1998, 2005) who applied a maximum-clade definition and used Triceratops horridus as the internal specifier and Psittacosaurus mongoliensis as the external specifier. We further include a second external specifier, Chaoyangsaurus youngi, to ensure that Chaoyangsauridae, a clade usually reconstructed as some of the earliest-diverging ceratopsians (e.g., Han et al., 2018; Knapp et al., 2018; Yu et al., 2020), are maintained outside Neoceratopsia.\n\nNeoiguanodontia Norman, 2014 (converted clade name)\n\nRegistration number: 635\n\nDefinition.

Under the primary reference phylogeny, Neoiguanodontia comprises Hypselospinus fittoni and members of the clade Hadrosauriformes.\n\nSynonyms. Neoiguanodontia is a potential heterodefinitional synonym of Hadrosauriformes. If Hypselospinus fittoni nests within the smallest clade containing Hadrosaurus foulkii and Iguanodon bernissartensis (e.g., Verdú et al., 2018; Santos-Cubedo et al., 2021: Fig. 11), the name Hadrosauriformes should have priority.\n\nComments.
