        "text": "Weight, dimensions, size of ankylosaurus\n\nCharacteristic of the Ankylosauria was an armor made of bone plates ( osteoderms ), which covered the neck, the back and the top of the tail. These were embedded in the skin and are usually not preserved in fossils , so their exact shape and arrangement are often not exactly known.\n\nThe bone plates were arranged in numerous, sagittal (front to back) rows. There were small plates between the larger plates, which ensured complete armor. Large, keeled panels were usually attached to the top of the neck. In the shoulder area, the plates were often woven into a crescent-shaped structure, with spines especially in the Nodosauridae. In the area of ​​the fuselage, the armor was variable depending on the species, in addition to flat plates, plates with keels or bumps were also available. In some ankylosaurs, the osteoderms had grown into a shield-like structure above the sacrum.\n\nMany representatives of the Ankylosauridae, but not the Nodosauridae, had a bony club at the tip of the tail. This consisted of osteoderms that were overgrown with the vertebrae and was supported and stiffened by ossified tendons.\n\nToday we present the world’s largest list of ankylosaurs ranked by weight. Soon we will present a list of the longest Ankylosaurus.\n\nThe heaviest Ankylosaurus Top 10\n\nNoDinosaurWeight [kg]Weight [lb]1Ankylosaurus magniventris6 000 kg13 228 lb2Cedarpelta bilbeyhallorum4 000 kg8 818 lb3Platypelta coombsi2 600 kg5 732 lb4Gobisaurus domoculus2 500 kg5 512 lb5Scolosaurus cutleri2 500 kg5 512 lb6Zuul crurivastator2 500 kg5 512 lb7Zaraapelta nomadis2 300 kg5 071 lb8Scolosaurus thronus2 200 kg4 850 lb9Talarurus plicatospineus2 200 kg4 850 lb10Anodontosaurus inceptus2 100 kg4 630 lb11Oohkotokia horneri2 100 kg4 630 lb12Euoplocephalus tutus2 000 kg4 409 lb13Zhejiangosaurus lishuiensis2 000 kg4 409 lb14Ziapelta sanjuanensis2 000 kg4 409 lb15“Dyoplosaurus” giganteus1 900 kg4 189 lb16Anodontosaurus lambei1 800 kg3 968 lb17Aletopelta coombsi1 400 kg3 086 lb18Zhongyuansaurus luoyangensis1 400 kg3 086 lb19Pinacosaurus grangeri1 300 kg2 866 lb20Nodocephalosaurus kirtlandensis1 100 kg2 425 lb21Shamosaurus scutatus1 100 kg2 425 lb22Ahshislepelta minor1 000 kg2 205 lb23Chuanqilong chaoyangensis1 000 kg2 205 lb\n\nRecommended"
