It's strange to hear Kate sing so plainly about break-ups - the mundane details like going to pick up your things. It's what makes You're the One so heartbreaking - it cuts to the core of it all and shows us some of Kate's vulnerability, which is what makes The Red Shoes such a unique album to me.

We've tied ourselves in knots

Done cartwheels across the floor

Just FORGET IT

Absolutely agree, the line about "I'll pick up all my things" is mundane but so effective. It always really stuck with me.

Get Out of My House inspired me to write an entire album of lyrics for URAPOPSTAR based on The Shining

It really is EVERYTHING.

The Kick Inside is GORGEOUS. I always forget the moments of sheer beauty in her early work. Again, mouth droppingly mature for such a young debut.

Jig of Life is just an epic. The way it just keeps GOING AND GOING. The urgency.

Aerial really is such a euphoric closer and the perfect ending to a perfect playlist! Thank you @Iguana, gutted I didn't get to do this at the time with you all but I'm glad I got to experience it albeit a week late!

Yay glad you liked it! I think you really need to give that bubble friend the boot. The fact that you didn't stare him in the eyes when he got there early and scream GET OUT OF MY HOUSE into his face before braying like a mule is, regrettably, very disappointing to me.

I can’t believe I’ve lived with the Hounds of Love album all this time without realising there are two dogs on the cover. I only noticed because Nerina Pallot posted about just noticing. Having thought about it maybe I did know and just forgot I knew. I can’t decide.

If anyone still reads magazines this month’s Classic Pop takes an album by album look at Kate’s discography.

Tori Amos on Kate Bush in 1998:

“I’ll never forget the first time I heard about Kate,” Amos recalls. “I was playing in a club, I was 18 or 19 and somebody came up to me, pointed their finger and said, Kate Bush. I went, Who’s that?"

Kate Bush when asked by Mojo if she liked Tori's music in 2006:"*long pause* Can we talk about Rolf Harris instead?"

This was finally just reposted:

I mean come on, it's a song about seeing things from the perspective of a different gender with the lyric "Let's exchange the experience". OK, the terminology doesn't hold up well today, but that alone is KIND OF CLEVER

It made me angry until I realise that Kate would read it and laugh her arse off.

Today!

Some gormless little twerp in his twenties is offering his critique on the lyrics of Kate, Bowie, and Leonard Cohen.

The critic has clearly not had to run up a hill towards the end of a tough run to have missed the literal and basic meaning of the line and it’s context within this song. They just want a reaction.

Just what the world needed.

I guess with new Kylie, Garbage, Jessie Ware and Marina today, the universe had to somehow correct itself.

A good lyricist but not a great one?

Okay hun, that's why there are literal BOOKS out there of her oeuvre but you GO OFF.

There's a city, draped in net

Fisherman net

And in the half light, in the half light

It looks like every tower

Is covered in webs

Moving and glistening and rocking

It's babies in rhythm

As the spider of time is climbing

Over the ruins

Good, but not great.

The passage starting "This kind of vagueness" can literally be applied to this ~~~review~~~ (replace 'lyricist' with 'critic')
