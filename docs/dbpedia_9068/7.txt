#RaraInSeason9Plz

This is a (poorly made) parody of "You'll Be In My Heart" by Phil Collins.

The parody is basically Applejack obnoxiously explaining the episode "The Mane Attraction" in SONG FORM!

The idea was based off of a scene from Nostalgia Critic's Balto Review. You can watch it here.

Enjoy!

(WARNING! WEIRD!)
