        "text": "Post by JERRY MODE IS BACK on\n\nRANK IN 2014: #78 (-22)\n\nFIRST SONG: Here I Go Again (1987)\n\nFAVORITE SONG: Still Of The Night (1987)\n\nFAVORITE MEMORY: Seeing David Coverdale and Lita Ford together in a 2011 episode of \"That Metal Show\".\n\nWHAT MAY HAVE AFFECTED CHANGE IN RANK: The Book Club helping me familiarize myself with more songs/artists, plus the last song they released that I REALLY liked was \"Love Will Set You Free\" in 2011.\n\nADDITIONAL COMMENTS: Whitesnake are a band who I feel like get dismissed because a lot of people only know “Here I Go Again”, and don’t get me wrong that is a good song but also very overplayed. Their true banger is “Still Of The Night”! But yeah they are a very talented band, from David Coverdale’s Robert Plant-esque vocals and stage presence, to the guitar work of Rudy Sarzo (Quiet Riot) and Vivian Campbell (Dio/Def Leppard/ungrateful mofo). That self-titled 1987 album is badass from start to finish.\n\nRANK IN 2014: #99 (-)\n\nFIRST SONG: Mo Money Mo Problems (1997)\n\nFAVORITE SONG: Mo Money Mo Problems (1997)\n\nFAVORITE MEMORY: Getting his greatest hits album on vinyl last year at one of the stores in Saskatoon that FreakyFlyBry took Pipa and I to.\n\nADDITIONAL COMMENTS: Unless you count the Beastie Boys (who to me are a gray area and are overall more alternative to me), Biggie is the only rapper to make the list (although his rival 2Pac came very close). Come on, who can deny songs like “Juicy” and “Hypnotize” and “Mo Money Mo Problems”? I think that East Coast/West Coast rivalry was very childish and a bunch of crap, and all it did was cause us to lose two very talented artists prematurely. I truly believe if both of them never passed away, hip hop would be MUCH better today. And stupid f*cktwats like Drake would be laughed at and not taken seriously.\n\nWHAT MAY HAVE AFFECTED CHANGE IN RANK: Biggie is one of the VERY few artists on this list to have the same ranking he did on the 2014 list. I’d say what kept him consistent for me is just being such an iconic part of the 90’s and hip hop, and also getting his greatest hits on vinyl.\n\nRANK IN 2014: #86 (-12)\n\nFIRST SONG: I Have Nothing (1993)\n\nFAVORITE SONG: I'm Every Woman (1993)\n\nFAVORITE MEMORY: My friends and I singing “I Wanna Dance With Somebody” at my bachelorette party last year.\n\nWHAT MAY HAVE AFFECTED CHANGE IN RANK: I feel like I have come to appreciate Whitney more in the last 10 years, so the only thing I can think of is The Book Club. You may not see the impact doing that show has had on me just yet, but trust me, you will very, very soon.\n\nADDITIONAL COMMENTS: I know this is an unusually low rank for one of the most iconic voices of our era, but truthfully, I was always a casual Whitney fan and was never into her the way I was into Madonna, Mariah, Celine, etc. But there is no denying that she is nicknamed “The Voice” for a reason. The way she took Dolly Parton’s “I Will Always Love You” and made it her own. I’m a huge Linda Ronstadt fan, and she covered that song about 20 years before Whitney did, and while I do like her version, even I prefer Whitney’s! She has so many classic songs though, of course I love “I Wanna Dance With Somebody” and “How Will I Know”, but “I’m Every Woman”, “I Have Nothing”, and “Heartbreak Hotel” are just as legendary and iconic to me. I was very shocked and sad when she passed away in 2012. I was hoping she would overcome her personal struggles – and it seemed like she did for awhile during the “I Look To You” era – but sadly that was short-lived.\n\nRANK IN 2014: #67 (-30)\n\nFIRST SONG: You Are The Sunshine Of My Life (1973)\n\nFAVORITE SONG: I Wish (1976)\n\nFAVORITE MEMORY: Seeing him sing “True To Your Heart” with 98 Degrees when I was a kid.\n\nWHAT MAY HAVE AFFECTED CHANGE IN RANK: The list from 2014 was very biased towards the 70’s as that was the peak of my “70’s whore” era. Although I still love the 70’s, I am no longer in that phase, so a lot of the 70’s acts having lower rankings will be a common theme throughout this countdown.\n\nADDITIONAL COMMENTS: Another legend, he was such an influence on so many other great artists. According to Julian, Mariah Carey said in her book that Stevie is her favorite artist. Even before I got into a lot of older music, I had a lot of respect for him and always thought he had a fantastic voice. Definitely an artist who deserves all the praise he has ever received.\n\nRANK IN 2014: #94 (-2)\n\nFIRST SONG: We Didn't Start The Fire (1989)\n\nFAVORITE SONG: We Didn't Start The Fire (1989)\n\nFAVORITE MEMORY: Some of you may know this already, but for those who don’t – when Unkie and I were kids we made up our own music acts and had our stuffed animals and my Barbie dolls sing them. Unkie had an act called the Dancing Party Animals who covered a lot of the songs we would hear on WALK 97.5 In Long Island. The Dancing Party Animals consisted of Bugs Bunny, the Pillsbury Doughboy (those 2 had a Lennon/McCartney type of relationship going on), a random owl who played the saxophone, and I forgot who else. One of the songs they covered? “It’s Still Rock & Roll To Me”.\n\nWHAT MAY HAVE AFFECTED CHANGE IN RANK: It’s crazy to me that he has ranked so low on these lists given what a big part he was in my childhood. I’m gonna say competition is the reason why he keeps ranking so low.\n\nADDITIONAL COMMENTS: Billy Joel is a Long Island icon. Because of that, and also both our parents being huge Billy Joel fans (they saw him in concert in 1987 when my Mom was pregnant with Unkie), we were exposed to his music a lot growing up. To this day most of his hits remind me of my childhood. Also, check out the Peanuts version of “Scenes From An Italian Restaurant” on YouTube when you have the chance – it’s amazing.\n\nRANK IN 2014: #59 (-36)\n\nFIRST SONG: Ordinary World (1993)\n\nFAVORITE SONG: Invisible (2021)\n\nFAVORITE MEMORY: The time on my countdown show when I ranted about “What Happens Tomorrow” missing the top 10 on the UK charts, which led to a weekly UK chart rant.\n\nWHAT MAY HAVE AFFECTED CHANGE IN RANK: Definitely competition.\n\nADDITIONAL COMMENTS: Without a doubt one of the biggest bands of the 80’s. So many smash hits. And aside from whatever the f*ck their last single was, they are still making great music today. I am still completely dumbfounded that my favorite song of theirs came out THREE YEARS AGO! Technically, not even Jerry has done that (“Atone” may be my favorite solo song of his, but “Would?” by Alice In Chains is still my favorite from him overall).\n\nRANK IN 2014: -\n\nFIRST SONG: Semi-Charmed Life (1997)\n\nFAVORITE SONG: Semi-Charmed Life (1997)\n\nFAVORITE MEMORY: Seeing the video for “Semi-Charmed Life” on VH1 and MTV when I was a kid.\n\nWHAT MAY HAVE AFFECTED CHANGE IN RANK: Hey look! A new entry! I’ve definitely grown to appreciate them more over the years, and to this day “Losing A Whole Year” is still one of my favorite songs I’ve discovered on the Book Club.\n\nADDITIONAL COMMENTS: For a band who had such a short streak of hits, they sure didn’t f*ck around during those three years of smash hits. I loved “Semi-Charmed Life” ever since I was a kid… even if it’s not exactly a song I should’ve been listening to back then. I always loved “Jumper” too, and “Never Let You Go”. And even recently I discovered great songs from them I’ve never heard before on the Book Club like “Losing A Whole Year” from the 1998 Yearbook and “10 Days Late” from the May 2019 “Anything Goes” episode. I definitely think this is the first example of the Book Club having an impact on this list.\n\nRANK IN 2014: #76 (-17)\n\nFIRST SONG: Hey Jude (1968)\n\nFAVORITE SONG: Helter Skelter (1968)\n\nFAVORITE MEMORY: When I was 8, my family and I went to Disney for the first time. We did everything – all the parks, the Disney Boardwalk, the Disney Cruise, etc. One night we were in Epcot and near the area where they had the UK, they had a Beatles tribute band performing. My Mom told them after their set that they were really good and the guy dressed as Paul McCartney thanked her and I got a photo with them (I have no idea who the lady in that photo is, that’s not my Mom lol). I thought they actually WERE the Beatles and I couldn’t believe my Mom got to talk to Paul McCartney! LMAOOOOO\n\nWHAT MAY HAVE AFFECTED CHANGE IN RANK: Same thing as Stevie Wonder – the 2014 list was very biased towards 60’s and 70’s acts. With that said, you’d think they would’ve had a higher ranking as I appreciate them more now than I did in 2014, but that is where competition comes in.\n\nADDITIONAL COMMENTS: Don’t come for me people! Yes, I know ranking the Beatles #93 on a favorite artists list is controversial, but even though I acknowledge the HUGE impact they have had on music and I like and respect them very much… they aren’t Grace to me. Or Lita. Or Alanis. Or Chris. Etc. Actually it’s funny I mention Chris because the Beatles were HIS favorite band. But yeah, there is no denying the impact they have had. It’s very likely if it weren’t for the Beatles, the other 99 artists on this list would’ve never been around. It’s also very likely that if it weren’t for the Beatles, this board wouldn’t exist. Or maybe it would and we would just be collecting J.Lo albums, who knows. The point is, the Beatles are legends and you cannot deny all of their classic hits. Also, John Lennon is still Peace Boy.\n\nRANK IN 2014: #60 (-32)\n\nFIRST SONG: Bad Girls (1979)\n\nFAVORITE SONG: Bad Girls (1979)\n\nFAVORITE MEMORY: The Dancing Party Animals covered several Donna Summer hits – “Dim All The Lights”, “She Works Hard For The Money”, and most notably, “Bad Girls”. WALK 97.5 played her all the time especially on Saturday nights when they would play disco.\n\nWHAT MAY HAVE AFFECTED CHANGE IN RANK: Again – the 2014 list had a bias in 70’s music.\n\nADDITIONAL COMMENTS: Another great singer who left us too soon. I always liked her a lot. So many classic songs, mostly from the 70’s and 80’s yes but she was still getting hits on the dance charts years later. “Stamp Your Feet” was a top 5 hit for me in 2008.\n\nRANK IN 2014: #55 (-36)\n\nFIRST SONG: Poison (1989)\n\nFAVORITE SONG: Stolen Prayer (1994)\n\nFAVORITE MEMORY: My parents sending me this with the subject “Music icon sells houses now”.\n\nWHAT MAY HAVE AFFECTED CHANGE IN RANK: I don’t know. I’m sure breaking up with my ex (a huge Alice Cooper fan) a year after I did the 2014 list probably didn’t help matters.\n\nADDITIONAL COMMENTS: So many classic songs. “Poison”, “No More Mr. Nice Guy”, “I’m Eighteen”, etc. My favorite from him is a 90’s deep cut called “Stolen Prayer”, and if you know who is featured on that song you will know EXACTLY why that is my favorite. He was doing shock rock at a time where not a lot of other people were doing that, maybe David Bowie but that was pretty much it. He was definitely an influence on the 70’s glam rock scene, 80’s hair metal scene, and without a doubt Lady Gaga (who is still to come).\n\nUP NEXT:\n\n81. A band named after the city Grace Slick is from.\n\n82. A 90’s pop/punk band who once caused Pipa to waste $21.\n\n83. A Canadian singer/songwriter who founded one of the biggest music festivals of the 90’s.\n\n84. Before Jefferson Starship, Temple Of The Dog, and Audioslave came into the picture, this was my favorite supergroup.\n\n85. Cat Stevens unfortunately just missed the list, but this band shares a name with one of his 70’s albums.\n\n86. It’s a miracle that I still like this artist, given that someone who used to post on here who was a big fan of hers bullied me pretty badly when I first joined these boards.\n\n87. A member of the Runaways?! No, it can’t be…\n\n88. Hey look! An artist who JUST released new singles!\n\n89. One word: “Sniper”.\n\n90. A 70’s trio indirectly responsible for one of my most hated songs of all-time.\n\nPost by JERRY MODE IS BACK on\n\nRANK IN 2014: #30 (-60)\n\nFIRST SONG: Sister Golden Hair (1975)\n\nFAVORITE SONG: You Can Do Magic (1982)\n\nFAVORITE MEMORY: Listening to their greatest hits album on vinyl all the time in 2014 and 2015.\n\nWHAT MAY HAVE AFFECTED CHANGE IN RANK: The 70’s whore era is no more.\n\nADDITIONAL COMMENTS: You ever hear a song you don’t think you’ve heard before and then when it gets to the chorus you’re like, “Oh I’ve heard this, this is a banger!” Well that’s pretty much what a lot of America’s hits were like to me when I (re)discovered them in 2013/2014. Especially “Sister Golden Hair” and “You Can Do Magic”. I liked those songs a lot when I was a kid but I had no idea who sang them. Very underrated band for sure.\n\nRANK IN 2014: -\n\nFIRST SONG: Cat's In The Cradle (1974)\n\nFAVORITE SONG: Sniper (1972)\n\nFAVORITE MEMORY: The episode of the Book Club that I did on his music in 2016.\n\nWHAT MAY HAVE AFFECTED CHANGE IN RANK: One word: “Sniper”.\n\nADDITIONAL COMMENTS: Another Long Island legend, although I was not as exposed to him as a kid as I was Billy Joel, Mariah Carey, and Pat Benatar (the last two, of course, are still to come). I know I’ve heard “Cat’s In The Cradle” before as a kid, but other than that I didn’t really know any of his music until I started getting into 70’s music a decade ago. I heard “Taxi” on reruns of American Top 40 and liked it a lot, and I also heard “WOLD” from AT40 reruns as well and I liked that. But it wasn’t until the second episode of the Book Club I ever did way back in April 2016 when I REALLY started appreciating him. I still remember putting on my playlist of songs for that episode and all of a sudden my WIG BEING SNATCHED when I heard “Sniper”. Harry Chapin’s music is played pretty often on SiriusXM’s The Bridge channel, but I still believe to this very day that “Sniper” would NOT sound out of place on a station like Ozzy’s Boneyard. Christ almighty that song kicks ass.\n\nRANK IN 2014: #92 (+4)\n\nFIRST SONG: No No No (1997)\n\nFAVORITE SONG: Independent Women Pt. I (2000)\n\nFAVORITE MEMORY: Seeing Destiny’s Child’s music videos on VH1 and MTV as a kid.\n\nWHAT MAY HAVE AFFECTED CHANGE IN RANK: Y2K nostalgia for sure. It's kind of a miracle Beyonce' is higher given that awful Lemonade album was two years after the original list lol\n\nADDITIONAL COMMENTS: I’ll be honest, Beyonce’ is mainly on this list for Destiny’s Child. Her solo career has been very inconsistent, especially in the last decade (although I do like her two new songs). Destiny’s Child were always great though. I still remember seeing the video for “Say My Name” one morning as I was getting ready for school and thinking to myself that it sounded like a #1 hit. And not long after that, it DID go to #1. So even when I was in second grade I had an ear for hits.\n\nRANK IN 2014: #82 (-5)\n\nFIRST SONG: I Love Rock N' Roll (1982)\n\nFAVORITE SONG: Bad Reputation (1981)\n\nFAVORITE MEMORY: My Mom and I bonding over her music. I checked out the Bad Reputation album after she told me a story about how my Dad got that album for her when they were dating, and she got him Judas Priest’s British Steel.\n\nWHAT MAY HAVE AFFECTED CHANGE IN RANK: Competition.\n\nADDITIONAL COMMENTS: I feel like the narrative on Joan Jett has changed a lot over the last decade or so. When I was a kid I was led to believe she was a one hit wonder. I was completely dumbfounded to find out she had a bunch of hits! “I Love Rock & Roll” is still a banger even if it is very overplayed. But I am glad she is now being appreciated for the legendary and iconic artist that she is.\n\nRANK IN 2014: #96 (+10)\n\nFIRST SONG: Can't Get You Out Of My Head (2001)\n\nFAVORITE SONG: Can't Get You Out Of My Head (2001)\n\nFAVORITE MEMORY: Finding out that she had more hits than just “Can’t Get You Out Of My Head” on these very boards and discovering a bunch of great songs of hers like “Put Yourself In My Place”, “Spinning Around” (those gold hot pants are iconic), “Some Kind Of Bliss”, and “On A Night Like This”).\n\nWHAT MAY HAVE AFFECTED CHANGE IN RANK: More appreciation for her music, and to be honest more appreciation for her as a person. I loved the video she did with Vogue Magazine of her looking back on past red carpet looks. She had me teary eyed when she was talking about Glastonbury!\n\nADDITIONAL COMMENTS: Kylie is such a legend. She just knows how to make fun dance/pop music and every music video and live performance I’ve seen of hers she looks so happy and like she is having a great time. She is just someone I always enjoyed rooting for – I was even happy when “Padam Padam” went to #1 on the Globalchart and top 40 on the pop charts despite not really being into that song. I’d love to see her in concert one day.\n\nRANK IN 2014: #27 (-58)\n\nFIRST SONG: Cold As Ice (1977)\n\nFAVORITE SONG: Jukebox Hero (1981)\n\nFAVORITE MEMORY: I hate saying it because he was a toxic friend who I am glad I cut off three years ago, but I’d feel dirty if I answered anything other than this – Adam ending all his VFM/M4B Radio broadcasts by playing Lou Gramm’s solo hit “Midnight Blue” at midnight on the dot.\n\nWHAT MAY HAVE AFFECTED CHANGE IN RANK: Competition. I still f*ck with 80’s AOR, but not as much as I did a decade ago.\n\nADDITIONAL COMMENTS: What an amazing streak of hits they had in the 70’s and 80’s. Even as a kid I thought “Cold As Ice” was a banger. Lou Gramm was such a great singer!\n\nRANK IN 2014: #52 (-32)\n\nFIRST SONG: Don't Tread On Me (1992)\n\nFAVORITE SONG: High Enough (1990)\n\nFAVORITE MEMORY: Challenging myself and taking a digital detox for a week in 2008 – and rewarding myself afterwards by buying their album with my allowance money!\n\nWHAT MAY HAVE AFFECTED CHANGE IN RANK: Competition mainly, but although I try my best to separate the artist from the art, Ted Nugent doesn’t exactly seem like he’d be fun at parties.\n\nADDITIONAL COMMENTS: Damn Yankees are amazing and that is a hill I am MORE than willing to die on. “Come Sail Away”? “Cat Scratch Fever”? “Sister Christian”? f*ck those flops, “High Enough” and “Don’t Tread On Me” are where it’s at! Okay just kidding I like those songs too lol but anyway, both of their albums slap and it’s a shame they weren’t around much longer after that.\n\nRANK IN 2014: #65 (-18)\n\nFIRST SONG: Adia (1997)\n\nFAVORITE SONG: Sweet Surrender (1997)\n\nFAVORITE MEMORY: My Mom getting me the “Adia” single on cassette when I was a kid.\n\nWHAT MAY HAVE AFFECTED CHANGE IN RANK: Definitely competition. I still love Sarah just as much as I did a decade ago.\n\nADDITIONAL COMMENTS: Sarah gets such a bad rep these days because of those depressing dog commercials, but honestly, I still love her and I still love “Angel”. Her music just brings back so much childhood nostalgia for me. The Surfacing era was so iconic.\n\nRANK IN 2014: #87 (+5)\n\nFIRST SONG: Pretty Fly (For A White Guy) (1999)\n\nFAVORITE SONG: Pretty Fly (For A White Guy) (1999)\n\nFAVORITE MEMORY: The video for “Pretty Fly (For A White Guy)” is hilarious.\n\nWHAT MAY HAVE AFFECTED CHANGE IN RANK: Definitely their Book Club episode from 2016.\n\nADDITIONAL COMMENTS: Just an awesome band who makes kick ass tunes. “Pretty Fly (For A White Guy)” is the obvious fave, but I also really like “The Kids Aren’t Alright”, “Gone Away”, “Why Don’t You Get A Job”, “Come Out And Play”, “Original Prankster”, “Smash It Up”, etc.\n\nRANK IN 2014: #24 (-57)\n\nFIRST SONG: You're The Inspiration (1984)\n\nFAVORITE SONG: 25 Or 6 To 4 (1970)\n\nFAVORITE MEMORY: My parents’ wedding song was “You’re The Inspiration”.\n\nWHAT MAY HAVE AFFECTED CHANGE IN RANK: The 70’s whore era is no more.\n\nADDITIONAL COMMENTS: Yikes, that’s a pretty bad drop. There’s no Chicago backlash though I swear! Another band I was exposed to a lot as a kid thanks to WALK 97.5. All of their hits remind me of my childhood. And they were very unique too, I mean, what other band from that time period was doing songs like “Does Anybody Really Know What Time It Is?” And of course, I CANNOT talk about Chicago without bringing up this:\n\n71. One of the biggest rock bands of the 2000’s and 2010’s who were recently rumored to have broken up. Fortunately, it doesn’t look like those rumors are true.\n\n72. Book Club alumni who Unkie recently saw in concert.\n\n73. A 90’s icon who recently went to #1 on FreakyFlyBry’s chart.\n\n74. Another 90’s icon who was popular around the same time as the artist at #73, she was known for her rags-to-riches story from being homeless living in her car to writing smash hits.\n\n75. “Three more lullabies, I mean songs, before I make my final verdict!”\n\n76. Dave Mustaine from Megadeth was one of the original members of this band. Although he was kicked out before they recorded their first album, he doesn’t let you forget that he was in this band for two seconds in the 80’s.\n\n77. One of the better musical acts to come from Florida.\n\n78. Actually, isn’t this band from Florida too?\n\n79. These dudes aren’t from Florida – they’re from Los Angeles!\n\n80. A band responsible for one of my favorite music videos that DOESN’T have Chris or Jerry in it."
