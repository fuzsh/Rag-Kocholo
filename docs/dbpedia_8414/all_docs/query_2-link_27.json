        "text": "Science Fiction can be a daunting genre to get into due to the expansive subgenres and advanced, often hard to understand, technology in them. With the help of this list you might be able to find your next favorite genre to get into. Where to start is always the hardest part when looking for new book genres to enjoy. I know it took me a while to move from young adult books and fantasy into the world of science fiction. The best place to start is asking the question: what is science fiction?\n\n“Science fiction stories are extraordinary voyages into any of the infinite supply of conceivable futures.”\n\n-Isaac Asimov\n\nThe science fiction genre deals with the imagined futuristic concepts. Differing from fantasy, science fiction ideas and inventions are plausible and follow the laws of physics, where fantasy is impossible to exist. These concepts can relate to future technology or space travel. Future technology can consist of super advanced artificial intelligence, robots, cybernetics, and much much more. Space and space travel includes stories about aliens, space exploration, galaxy wide conflicts, parallel universes, and all that fun stuff.\n\nHard and Soft Science Fiction\n\nBefore we get into the subgenres, there is two distinct types of science fiction books, hard science fiction and soft science fiction. Hard science fiction deals with the more technical side. They focus on the STEM side of science. Hard science fiction books tend to be harder to get into because they like to explain all the science and technology in the book. Even if the technology does not exist, there has to be a plausible explanation on how and why it exists. These books tend to be the more stereotypical science fiction everyone thinks of. Hard science fiction books include, The Martian, by Andy Weir and The Andromeda Strain, by Micheal Crichton.\n\nOn the other side, soft science fiction focuses on the other sciences, like psychology, sociology, and anthropology. Soft science fiction likes to look at the impact advanced technology has on humans. These books are more character, and emotion driven than hard science fiction. While these books will still have the technology as hard science fiction, they will not be as detailed or need to explain every detail about them. Soft science fiction books include, Exhalation, by Ted Chiang, and 1984 by George Orwell.\n\nFinally, we are onto the subgenres. The list of subgenres can appear daunting but I tried to make it as simple as possible. I alphabetized the list to make finding a certain subgenre easier. For each subgenre, I included a book example in case you decide you want to read a book from it. Hopefully, you enjoy the list and find your new favorite book or science fiction subgenre.\n\nThe Subgenres\n\nAfrofuturism– Afrofuturism explores science fiction through the lens of African and black culture. Popular topics covered in afrofuturism are alienism, reclamation, and water. Books like Dawn by Octavia Butler and Lagoon by Nnedi Okorafor are good examples.\n\nAlien/Alien Invasion– The Alien genre focuses on malevolent aliens intent on taking over earth or enslaving humans for their own needs. These books often show humans working together to repel the aliens. H.G Wells’ War of the Worlds is one of the most well known Alien Invasion books.\n\nApocalyptic/PostApocalyptic-This genre focuses on the end of the earth (or other worlds) or what happens after the end of the earth. The cause of destruction can range from climate change to total nuclear annihilation. The stories can be about trying to prevent the disaster or life after the disaster. Examples are Stephen King’s The Stand or Margaret Atwood’s Oryx and Crake.\n\nAtomPunk- AtomPunk asks the question what if nuclear energy ran everything. From cars to homes to space ships. The aesthetic focuses on bright colors and families in the 50’s and 60’s at the time of the cold war. The nuclear family presents itself often. The beginning of Bethesda’s Fallout 4 and Alan Moore’s Tom Strong comics are great examples.\n\nBiopunk– The biopunk genre focuses on bioengineering and biotechnology. Biopunk is similar to cyberpunk, however it focuses on bio modifications instead of cyber modifications. Gene splicing and gene clinics to modify humans and animals are featured in these books. Characters are either biomodified against their will or trying to stop evil corporations performing illegal biomodifications. Example books for Biopunk are H.G Wells’ The Island of Doctor Moreau and Paul Di Filippo’s Ribofunk.\n\nChristian Science Fiction– Christian Science fiction is a broad subcategory. Christian Science fiction includes strong christian themes or written with christianity in mind. The characters do not have to identify as Christians for a book to be considered christian science fiction. C.S. Lewis a well known christian author wrote one of the most well known book series in this subgenere titled The Space Trilogy.\n\nComedy– Comedy science fiction often makes fun of the normal tropes and themes of science fiction books. Authors use comedy science fiction to satirize or criticize the science fiction genre or the modern world. If you ever get the chance to read Douglas Adams’ A Hitchhiker’s Guide to the Galaxy, I would highly recommend you do so. It is one of my favorite books in this subgenre.\n\nCyberpunk– I would be highly surprised if someone told me they didn’t know what cyberpunk is because it has gained a lot of traction in modern media. Cyberpunk features dystopian cities controlled by mega corporations. In cyberpunk people modify their body with high tech cybernetics. Often novels involve “jacking into” the internet and hacking people, corporations, or machines. Artificial intelligence and androids are also often featured in this genre. Philip K. Dick’s Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep and William Gibson’s Neuromancer influenced this subgenre. Warner Brothers made the former into a major motion picture called Blade Runner. Maybe you have heard of it.\n\nDieselpunk– Dieselpunk is similar to atmo punk but instead of the main technology based on nuclear energy, it’s based on diesel energy. Unlike steampunk, dieselpunk is more pessimistic. The time period this subgenre takes place includes both world wars. Dieselpunk often features huge flying machines or giant tanks on the battlefield. Books that feature dieselpunk are Philip K. Dick’s The Man in the High Castle and Harry Turledove’s book series The War That Came Early.\n\nDying Earth- The dying earth subgenre is set way in the future, either at the end of the earth or the end of the entire universe. Unlike the apocalypse genre there is no catastrophe that causes the world to end. It is just the end. The sun can burn out or entropy occurs in the universe. This genre is more melancholy than the apocalypse genre. There is less fighting and more accepting the end. Two short stories I recommend reading for this genre are, Ted Chiang’s Exhalation and Isaac Asimov’s The Last Question. These stories will give you a feel for the dying earth subgenre.\n\nEcofiction– Ecofiction mainly has to do with the environment, climate change, and human’s impact on the environment. This subgenre became more popular in the 70’s during the environmental movement. In these books nature is the primary focus or the impact humans have on nature. Some examples include, J.G Ballard’s The Drowned World and The Windup Girl by Paolo Bacigalupi.\n\nEdisonade– Edisonade is a specific subgenre about inventors inventing new technology. Edisonade is an eponym, obviously named after Thomas Edison, one of America’s greatest inventors.This subgenre became popular in the early 1900’s where people were more interested in new technologies and engineering. The Jack Wright novels by Luis Senarens written in 1891 and beyond are an example of Edisonade.\n\nInterstellar War– Interstellar war and intergalactic war is a popular subgenre in science fiction. This subgenre involves galaxy wide or universe wide warfare. Interstellar is more common than intergalactic due to the science involved in intergalactic travel. Interstellar war can be involved in other science fiction genres as a plot device such as the space opera or alien invasion subgenres. Enders Game by Orson Scott Card and Christopher Paolini’s To Sleep in a Sea of Stars, use this subgenre and plot device in their novels.\n\nIsekai– Isekai is a popular Japanese genre where the protagonists get transported to a new world where they must learn to survive in this new environment. The word isekai itself means different world. The transportation allows the reader and the protagonists to learn about their new environment at the same time. This subgenre is mainly used in Japanese manga and anime. However, the TV show Futurama can be considered a unique version of isekai.\n\nLitRPG– LitRPGs combine books with role playing games like dungeons and dragons or video games. The protagonist in these books is often interacting with a video game world or some sort of other game and attempting to further his progress in said games. Ernest Cline’s Ready Player One is a good example of this subgenre.\n\nMathematical Fiction– People speculate when mathematical fiction became a genre. Earliest records indicate mathematical fiction has been around since ancient times but recently been defined as a subgenre for science fiction. These stories can be any medium such as poems, short stories, comics, or novels. In this subgenre mathematics or mathematicians are the focus point. A popular book from this subgenre is Edwin A. Abbott’s Flatland or the sequel by Ian Stewart, Flatterland.\n\nMilitary Science Fiction– Military science fiction books are about futuristic weapons and their use in wars. These wars can take place on earth or in space against other races. Military science fiction is similar to the interstellar war subgenre but this subgenre focuses more on the weapons and strategies used in these wars. These books include detailed descriptions of the conflict, the people, the military and the weapons used in the war. Military values of courage and strength are important in this subgenre. A Hymn Before Battle by John Ringo and Dauntless by Jack Campbell are books in this subgenre.\n\nNew Wave Science Fiction– New Wave science fiction became popular in the 60’s and 70’s. These science fiction books focus more on social and psychological sciences instead of the physical sciences. This form of science fiction stopped focusing on outer space and instead focuses on the inner self, such as dreams and the subconscious. New wave shifted from hard science fiction and pulp fiction magazines to the more modern soft science fiction book form. A good example of new wave science fiction is Philip K. Dick’s novel The Three Stigmata of Palmer Eldritch.\n\nPostcyberpunk- Postcyberpunk is a more optimistic version of cyberpunk. In this genre people still augment their bodies with technology and cybernetics. There is still advanced technology, artificial intelligence, and the cyberspace. The main difference in this more modern subgenre is, often it’s not dystopian. The technology is not considered bad for the characters. Cyberpunk as a genre became popular before the modern internet came about, but postcyberpunk is written with a modern knowledge on cyberspace and technology considered future tech at the time cyberpunk became mainstream. Altered Carbon by Richard K. Morgan is a book that falls in the postcyberpunk category.\n\nScience Fantasy– Science Fantasy is a hybrid subgenre that combines elements of both science fiction and fantasy genres. Oftentimes the setting takes place in a science fiction setting with future technology or in a space setting. Somewhere in the story contains supernatural or magical elements that make it not fit the general science fiction genre. These generally, are explained with science in mind but do not follow any laws of science. One of the most popular books in science fantasy is Madeline L’Engle’s, A Wrinkle in Time.\n\nSocial Science fiction– Social science fiction is a soft science fiction focusing on anthropology and society. This is separate from speculating about technology and instead focuses on speculating about life and society as a whole. These books contain a great deal of social or political commentary set in future societies. One of my favorite books in this genre is George Orwell’s, 1984. Isaac Asimov’s, The Foundation Series is another good example.\n\nSolarpunk– Solarpunk focuses on sustainable green energy for the entire planet. The punk comes from counterculture against our current unsustainable culture and plastic waste. This subgenre is more utopian than most of the other subgenres on this list. These books look at what life might be like in the future if humans solve the major climate change crises and rely only on completely sustainable technology. A book in the solarpunk genre is, Ursula K. Le Guin’s book, Always Coming Home.\n\nSpace Opera– Space operas get their name from soap operas. Both soap operas and space operas focus on melodramatic characters and the relationships they form. They often are about risk taking adventures to save the universe or galaxy during times of war. The most well known space operas are Star Wars and Star Trek. For the space opera subgenre, one of the most famous books is, Dune by Frank Herbert.\n\nSpace Western– Space Westerns take a lot of tropes from the classic western books and western movies. In space westerns, space is the final frontier similar to the west. It’s a lawless place with good guys and bad guys. Space gunslingers hunt bounties or farmers face hardships on new, possibly terraformed planets. The japanese anime Cowboy Bebop and Star Wars’ The Mandalorian are prime examples in media. As for books, Daisy Kutter: The Last Train by Kazu Kibushi is a good example.\n\nSteampunk– Steampunk emphasis mechanical devices and steam powered machines instead of our more modern world we live in with gas powered machines and digital devices. Oftentimes steampunk ends up being a hybrid genre with fantasy or alternate history. In steampunk, mechanical robots and steam flying machines often appear. The time period steampunk books range from the 1840’s to the early 1900’s, the Victorian age. Mortal Engines by Philip Reeve is one of the most well known books in the steampunk subgenre.\n\nTech Noir– Tech noir is another hybrid subgenre. It combines cyberpunkesque vibes with film noir and science fiction in general. The landscapes in these books are dreary and dark. A lot of the time these books take place at night. Popular tech noir includes a detective or police officer in a futuristic city trying to solve a crime or crimes, such as Philip K Dick’s, Do Andriods Dream of Electric Sheep or The Automatic Detective, by A. Lee Martinez.\n\nIn conclusion\n\nI know that was a lot to read but you made it through. Hopefully you found a subgenre that you want to read more books in. While I tried to make the most complete list out there, I probably missed a few. Let me know in the comments if you think I missed one, or if you just want to tell us your favorite subgenre. Personally, I love the cyberpunk and space western subgenres.\n\nAs always, happy reading!"
