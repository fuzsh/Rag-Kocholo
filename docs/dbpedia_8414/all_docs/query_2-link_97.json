        "text": "As a reader and a writer, you probably already have a few favorite fiction genres. But, unless you already have a clear vision in mind, actually writing a novel and figuring out which genre it should fall into can be difficult.Â\n\nWith dozens of fiction genres and subgenres to choose from, how do you pick the right one for your story?Â\n\nThis guide will walk you through the many different types of novels. Weâll include a list of book genres and descriptions, genre characteristics, popular genre fiction examples, and tips on selecting the fiction genre that best fits your writing style and interests. But first, letâs cover the basics.\n\nWhat Are Book Genres & Why Should You Care?\n\nBook genres are categories or types of literature that share common traits, styles, themes, and conventions. Every book falls into one or more broad categories, like fiction or nonfiction, and more specific genres like thrillers, science fiction, or memoirs.\n\nAs a writer, choosing a genre for your novel will help guide your creative decisions during the writing process. Each genre has established rules and elements that readers expect. Writing within or across genres requires an understanding of these key genre characteristics.\n\nWhat Is a Fiction Book?\n\nFiction books refer to novels that come from the imagination. Fiction writing uses story elements like made-up characters, events, and settings rather than real people and historically accurate places. Even if itâs realistic fiction, fiction books still have leeway to bend facts, whereas nonfiction books stick to truths and lived experiences.\n\nThis gives fiction authors creative freedom to spin an engaging narrative. The story and characters are fictional, but good fiction often explores authentic universal truths and themes.\n\nIn fiction books, genres let readers to quickly identify the kind of story they can expect. Is it a fast-paced crime thriller or an emotional romance novel? Almost everyone has a preference and knowing the type of novel at a glance helps readers choose the right book for them.\n\nWhat Are Subgenres in Fiction?\n\nWithin the major fiction genres like mystery, romance, sci-fi, etc., there are more specific subgenres.Â\n\nSubgenres share the core traits of their parent genre but feature distinct styles, settings, character types, themes, and more. This allows for even more diversity and specialized appeal within the major genres.\n\nFor example, some common subgenres within romance include:\n\nHistorical romance: Set in the pastÂ\n\nParanormal romance: Incorporates fantasy elementsÂ\n\nErotic romance: Includes explicit sexual content\n\nRomantic suspense: Combines romance and mystery\n\nSubgenres help writers narrow their focus while allowing readers to quickly find books in their specific niche.\n\n7 Genres of Fiction & Their Genre Characteristics\n\nWhile genres are evolving all the time, most fiction books can be categorized into one of the following seven major genres:\n\n1. Literary Fiction\n\nLiterary fiction focuses on quality writing, complex characters, and artistic merit. Literary fiction often incorporates elements found in other genres, such as well-researched historical details and settings common to historical fiction or relationships and love stories typical of romance fiction.

Examples are The Book Thief by Markus Zusak and Looking for Alaska by John Green.\n\nWhatâs the difference? Literary Fiction vs. Mainstream FictionÂ\n\nLiterary fiction focuses on the artistry and complex themes in the writing rather than adhering to the conventions of genres like mystery, romance, or sci-fi.Â\n\nMainstream fiction, including the list of book genres and descriptions below, follows more formulaic genre elements to provide an entertaining escapist experience for the reader.\n\n2. Historical FictionÂ\n\nHistorical fiction features fictional stories set in the past. Subgenres include family saga, nautical, wartime, and others.

Fantasy\n\nFantasy novels involve imaginary worlds and elements of magic, myth, and the supernatural. Subgenres include high fantasy, urban fantasy, dark fantasy, and more. One of the core characteristics of fantasy novels is detailed worldbuilding. Fantasy stories often follow quest narratives and heroâs journeys as well as high stakes battles between good and evil.Â Â\n\nFantasy genre examples:Â\n\nHarry Potter series by J.K. Rowling (1997-2007)\n\nThe Mistborn Saga by Brandon Sanderson (2006-2008)\n\nA Song of Ice and Fire series by George R.R. Martin (1996 - Present)\n\nThis fiction genre is popular among all ages of readers, and books often come in series.\n\n4. Science Fiction\n\nScience fiction explores the impact of science, technology, and futuristic ideas on characters, societies, and imagined worlds. Subgenres include hard sci-fi, soft sci-fi, dystopian, and more. Common characteristics of science fiction are futuristic technologies like space travel or robots, exploration of scientific discoveries, and aliens or off-Earth settings.\n\nScience fiction genre examples:\n\nCertainly! Here are five science fiction novels:\n\nThe Broken Earth series by N.K.Jemisin (2015-20170\n\nDune by Frank Herbert (1965)\n\nFoundation by Isaac Asimov (1951)\n\nThis is another genre thatâs highly popular among young adults and children.\n\n5.

Analyze Recent Favorites\n\nMake a list of five to ten fiction books you've loved over the past couple years. Include the title, author, and a short summary. Look for common elements and patterns across these books like character types, story structures, themes, and tone.Â\n\nWhat pieces feel similar to your novel idea? Which ones feel out of place for what you want to write? Use this information as a starting point to select the genre you inherently enjoy and connect with.\n\nIf you have a work in progress, you can use our book genre identifier to analyze your genre and comps.\n\n2. Play to Your Strengths & Interests\n\nLook at fiction genres that allow you to highlight your expertise or enthusiasm for certain topics and techniques.\n\nAsk yourself questions, such as:Â\n\nWhat topics, time periods, or settings do you have in-depth knowledge of that you can leverage? A historical fiction may allow you to showcase that expertise.\n\nWhat real-world skills can you bring like science, medicine, law, or technology? Sci-fi and mystery could allow you to highlight these.\n\nWhat excites you about reading and writing stories? Is it worldbuilding, romantic relationships, or solving puzzles? Select genres that play to these passions.\n\n3. Start With Your Central Concept\n\nWhich fiction genres naturally align with your initial story idea, main character, or core theme? Certain ideas lend themselves better to specific genres and the genre characteristics can help you figure it out.\n\nFor example, a space academy suggests sci-fi, a bakery investigator implies cozy mystery, and a vampire love story maps to paranormal romance. Be open to genres that naturally fit your idea rather than forcing a mismatch.\n\n4. Blend Fiction Genres & Subgenres\n\nDon't limit yourself to the established genres in the list above. You can combine and blend genres in new ways for fresh takes like sci-fi romance like Outlander by Diana Gabaldon, Victorian fantasy like Caraval by Stephanie Garber, or Western horror-fantasy like The Dark Tower by Stephen King.\n\nBlending establishes genre expectations while adding unique twists can make for an exciting new tale.\n\n5. Try Writing Samples\n\nExperiment with writing short samples in different genres to see what you enjoy and excel at crafting. For example, write 500 words of your current novel idea or work in progress in horror, then fantasy, then romance.Â\n\nWhich genre feels most natural for your story? Which one fits your voice and style? Experimenting can reveal hidden preferences and talents ideal for different types of novels.\n\n6. Study the Market\n\nIf selling your work is your highest priority, then look at reader demand for genres and what has the most mass appeal and opportunity.\n\nResearch current market trends, bestseller lists, and book sales data to figure out the highest-performing genres. Join book clubs and online communities to get a sense of what readers are excited about.\n\nChoosing Between Literary vs. Mainstream FictionÂ Â Â\n\nWe covered the difference in literary and mainstream fiction above, but actually choosing between them depends on your goals.Â\n\nLiterary fiction allows for more experimentation and receives more critical acclaim, but it isn't always commercially successful. However, mainstream fiction genres tend to have mass market appeal, while still featuring skilled writing and in-depth characters.\n\nThe best approach is to let your story determine whether it aligns more with a genre style or has a more literary lean. Rather than force a fit, use the conventions and reader expectations of each style to guide your writing process.\n\nBest-Selling Fiction Genres\n\nIf selling your fiction book is a top priority, consider these consistently popular, commercially viable genres, according to Words Rated:\n\nRomance: Romance novels are the highest-earning and fastest-growing fiction genre, generating more than $1.44 billion in revenue.\n\nFantasy or Science Fiction: Some of the best-selling books of all time are Young Adult fantasy novels, like the Harry Potter series. And together with science fiction, these genres bring in $590 million in revenue in the United States each year.\n\nMystery/Thriller: This genre accounts for 12.5% of all adult print book sales each year. Theyâre also the second most popular genre for audiobook sales.\n\nChoosing a fiction genre is an exciting first step in your writing journey. Whether you want to experiment with new styles or consider popular genres that align with your book concept, knowing the world of fiction genres and subgenres will help you figure out where your book fits. Master the conventions of your chosen genre, but don't be afraid to put your own creative spin on storytelling traditions. Most importantly, write the kind of book you want to read, and your passion will come through."
