        "text": "Today, science fiction is one of the most popular genres of speculative fiction, with a wide variety of subgenres to choose from. Whether you’re interested in the science and technology of the future, or the social sciences of today, there’s a science fiction subgenre for you. We have compiled a list of all the major subgenres of science fiction and some of their most notable works.\n\nHow the subgenres of science fiction were formed\n\nScience fiction has been around for centuries, with early examples dating back to the 16th century. However, it was not until the 19th century that science fiction began to develop as a distinct genre. One of the earliest science fiction novels is Frankenstein, by Mary Shelley. Published in 1818, Frankenstein tells the story of a scientist who creates a monster from the body parts of dead people. The novel explores themes of science gone wrong, and the potential consequences of playing with nature.\n\nScience fiction continued to develop in the 19th century with works such as The Time Machine, by H.G. Wells, and The War of the Worlds, also by Wells. These novels further explored the potential consequences of science and technology, and helped to solidify science fiction as a distinct genre.\n\nThe 20th century saw science fiction become increasingly popular, with classics such as Isaac Asimov’s Foundation series, and Arthur C. Clarke’s 2001: A Space Odyssey. Science fiction also began to branch out into subgenres, such as hard science fiction, soft science fiction, and science fantasy.\n\nClassic science fiction\n\nScience fiction is a genre of speculative fiction, which typically deals with imaginative and futuristic concepts such as advanced science and technology, space exploration, time travel, parallel universes, and extraterrestrial life. Science fiction often explores the potential consequences of scientific, social, and technological innovations.\n\nMost classic science fiction works are set in the future, and many of them deal with themes of science gone wrong. Frankenstein is a classic example of this, as it explores the potential consequences of playing with nature. Other examples include The War of the Worlds, which deals with the potential consequences of an alien invasion, and The Time Machine, which deals with the potential consequences of time travel.\n\nScience fantasy\n\nScience fantasy is a hybrid genre, combining elements of both science fiction and fantasy. It typically features science fiction elements such as advanced science and technology, space exploration, time travel, parallel universes, etc., while also incorporating elements of fantasy such as magic and other supernatural phenomena.\n\nScience fantasy most notable works are Star Wars and Star Trek.\n\nHard science fiction\n\nHard science fiction is a subgenre of science fiction that emphasizes accurate science and technology, often exploring the potential consequences of scientific and technological innovations. Hard science fiction is typically more realistic and scientifically rigorous than other science fiction subgenres, making it one of the most popular genres among science-minded readers.\n\nThe first mention of the term was made in print in 1957 by P. Schuyler Miller while reviewing the book by John W.
