        "text": "Toho submitted the film to the US copyright office on December 8th, 1986 with the registration number of PA0000317017. The movie was submitted under its international title, ESPY, and its Romaji title of Esupai.\n\nWriter Sakyo Komatsu created the story behind ESPY as an ongoing story for Weekly Manga Sunday (é±åæ¼«ç»ãµã³ãã¼ - Shukan Manga Sande), which began serialization in 1964.\n\nToho purchased the rights to the story in the 1960's when it was first produced, but the script lamented at the company until the success of Submersion of Japan (1973) brought the concept to the forefront. This is referenced in Age of the Gods (self-published).\n\nDirector Jun Fukuda credits the success of the film to timing, that it was the next movie created from Sakyo Komatsu's work after the immense success of Submersion of Japan (1973). Producer Fumio Tanaka has a less idealistic perspective, citing its success more to double billings than even its attachment to writer Komatsu. These conflicting views are found in Age of the Gods (self-published).\n\nBefore casting had started, writer Sakyo Komatsu had envisioned the Maria Harada character as being played by Karou Yumi. To his delight, she was awarded the part. These details are mentioned in the 2012 book Toho Special Effects Movies: Complete Works (ISBN: 9784864910132).\n\nThe villain's hideout was originally aboard a satellite. Director Jun Fukuda notes that this was changed to the mansion in the mountains for budgetary reasons. This detail is mentioned in Age of the Gods (self-published).\n\nReflecting on the final cut, director Jun Fukuda has expressed disappointment over the teleportation scene. In particular the lack of surprise or impact from those observing it, lamenting that it comes across as \"it's teleportation, it's nothing new\" as if this were a common occurrence. This statement is listed in Age of the Gods (self-published).\n\nActress Linda Blair from The Exorcist, who was touring Japan at the time, was sought after to appear in the movie as one of the villains. Blair was enthusiastic and wanted the role, but her manager declined to have her participate. This fact is found in Age of the Gods (self-published)."
