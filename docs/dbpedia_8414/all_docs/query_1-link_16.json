        "text": "Sakyo Komatsu\n\nFrom the perspective of Japanese SF history, Sakyo Komatsu is a writer who will never be forgotten. All Japanese fans agree that his writing has influenced not only the SF world, but also all of Japanese society. Komatsu has come to be a prominent leader in the Japanese science fiction community.\n\nDavid Brin\n\nMore than ten of Brin's works have been translated into Japanese. His \"Uplift series\" is popular everywhere, but especially in Japan. Furthermore, every Japanese science fiction fan recognizes that since Brin loves Japan, he would also enjoy a Worldcon in Japan with fans from all over the world.\n\nTakumi Shibano\n\nTakumi Shibano has been translating English science fiction into Japanese for over half a century; he has built a bridge between fans in Japan and America. Because of his great efforts over many years, we can hold Worldcon in Japan. Shibano is a guest of honor who most closely matches our theme: the exchange of fans between Japan and America."
