        "text": "Now for the second in my subgenres series. This time, it’s science fiction. Look out, enormous post ahead! Science fiction is such a broad category and dozens of subgenres are needed. Before you continue, a note on terminology: when I say “people” you can usually substitute “sentients.” When I say human I mean earthling.\n\n[My post on fantasy subgenres.]\n\n[My post on adventure subgenres.]\n\nAlternate Reality\n\nScience fiction that takes place in an altered or changed reality, but usually recognizable.\n\n~Alternate Dimension\n\nScience fiction about other dimensions or “planes of existence” unperceived by humans.

Dimension is not to be confused with universe.\n\n~Alternate/Parallel Earth/Universe\n\nScience fiction detailing a journey to a complete other world existing with ours where something is altered, minor or major.\n\n~Alternate Timeline\n\nThis subgenre asks, “What if a historic fact was altered?” and follows that alternate route. Common themes are, “What if the south had wont he Civil War?” and “What if the Nazis had won WWII?”\n\n~Multiverse\n\nThis subgenres presumes there are many other universes, and makes use of several of them in one story.\n\nApocalypse\n\nScience fiction about the extinction or near extinction of humankind either by forces of nature or by our own means.\n\nChristian Science Fiction\n\nScience fiction that carries Christian messages or the Christian faith, blatantly or allegorically.\n\nColonization\n\nA story of humans creating a colony on an ‘other world’ and their trial and triumphs.\n\nComic Science Fiction\n\nScience fiction that is either humorous or a parody.

Sometimes used to warn people of a possibility.\n\nESP Science Fiction\n\nExtra sensory perception is the ability to use the mind to perform impossible feats. The difference between psychic ability and magic is that psychic ability is supposedly scientifically explained.

No known rules of physics can be broken.\n\nMilitary Science Fiction\n\nStories centered around a futuristic military.\n\nNear-Future\n\nScience fiction taking place within fifty years and exploring technology and social situations that are expected to develop in that time. A realistic portrayal of the future.\n\nOther World Science Fiction\n\nThis subgenre takes place in an entirely fictitious world, but maintains the science fiction setting.\n\nPolitical Science Fiction\n\nStories about the futuristic political state of the universe; or stories written with a political statement in mind.\n\nPost-Apocalypse\n\nScience fiction telling the tale of the survivors of an apocalypse.

This subgenre commonly ignores scientific plausibility.\n\nTechnological Science Fiction\n\nScience fiction honing in on a specific theoretical technological advance. Just containing the technology is not enough for it to be technological science fiction; the story most focus and center around that technology and its effects.\n\n~AI\n\nAI stand for artificial intelligence. This subgenre deal with the possibility of robotic intelligence as great as or rivaling that of humans. Sometimes it is written from the AI’s POV.\n\n~Clones\n\nStories about reproducing exact genetic replicas of life forms and the consequences.\n\n~FTL\n\nFTL stands for Faster Than Light. This subgenres is about breaking the speed of light, thought impossible by Einsteinian physics.\n\n~Nanotechnology\n\nStories about engineering on the microscopic and atomic level. Much technology is theoretically possible with nanotech.\n\n~Time Travel\n\nThis subgenre starts with the premise time travel is somehow possible. A person or group of people travel either into the past or future. Any number of rules may be used regarding time travel.\n\nUtopia\n\nStories of a theoretical perfect society where all wrongs are absent or easily dealt with.\n\n~Dystopia Utopia\n\nA world that is thought to be perfect, but upon a closer look is revealed to have flaws.\n\nKudos for you if you read all that! It is a huge list and it would be impossible to name all my sources. Much is from my head (no wonder I can never remember anything – my memory is filled with science fiction subgenres!).\n\nWhat science fiction subgenres do you write? What subgenres do you like to read? And is there anything I’m missing?"
