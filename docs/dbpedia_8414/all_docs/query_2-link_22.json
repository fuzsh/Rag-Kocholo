        "text": "From my early beginnings as a young introvert, the public library has always been a bit of a refuge. Years later, not much has changed, albeit with an additional affinity for endless hours spent scouring second-hand bookstores to add to my ever-growing “to-read” pile.\n\nFrom one bookworm to another, this column will be underscoring and outlining various literary genres, authors, and recent reads and can serve as an introduction for those unfamiliar with these works, as a refresher for long-time aficionados, and maybe as an inspiration for readers to share their own suggested topics. Do you have a topic that you would like covered in this column? Feel free to contact me for an interview and a feature in an upcoming column.\n\nWho\n\nFollowing up on last week’s general overview of science fiction, this week’s column delves deeper into the genre. In particular, science fiction can be subdivided into two main categories, namely hard science fiction and soft science fiction.\n\nSoft science fiction is defined as texts that focus on what are known as “soft sciences.” These include political science, sociology, and psychology. These works often “deal with topics that do not comport with science as we understand it.”\n\nIn contrast, hard science fiction focuses on the “hard sciences,” such as astronomy, biology, and physics. In particular, this sub-genre “emphasizes scientific accuracy and precise technical detail as part of its world-building.”\n\nIt must also be noted that the science fiction genre can be further divided into additional sub-genres, such as space opera, space western, and dystopian science fiction. These will be discussed in-depth in a future column.\n\nWhat\n\nSome examples of soft science fiction include Dune by Frank Herbert and The Hitchhiker’s Guide to the Galaxy by Douglas Adams.\n\nIn addition, a well-known example of hard science fiction is Foundation by Isaac Asimov.\n\nWhere\n\nThese novels take place throughout the galaxy.\n\nWhen\n\nThese works take place during the future.\n\nWhy\n\nAs discussed in last week’s column, science fiction novels may be of interest to AU students for a variety of reasons, including a fascination with parallel universes and technology. However, one type of science fiction will not necessarily appeal to all readers of the genre. For example, soft science fiction may appeal to political science and psychology students who may be trying to make sense of their modern world, just as many of classic science fiction readers (and writers) were during the uncertain political climate of the 1950s and 1960s. In contrast, hard science fiction may appeal to AU students in STEM faculties, especially those taking math and psychics courses. Indeed, these books’ attention to scientific detail may prove very appealing to these types of readers.\n\nHow\n\nAU’s wide range of diverse courses make it easy to study this topic in depth. Courses related to science fiction sub-genres are available in a variety of disciplines, including one’s that may fit into your Degree Works. (Always check with an AU counsellor to see if these particular courses fulfill your personal graduation requirements!)\n\nAU students interested in learning more about this topic may enroll in PHYS 200: Introductory Physics I, a junior-level, three-credit course, which “provides an introduction to classical mechanics and includes a hands-on laboratory component.” (No prerequisites are required for this course.) Happy reading!"
