        "text": "What Is Science Fiction?\n\nBefore picking apart this genre into smaller pieces, let’s get a sense of the broad definition. According to the New York Public Library’s “A Beginner’s Guide to Science Fiction,” science fiction is defined as the following:\n\nScience fiction is a sub-genre of speculative fiction, which is an umbrella term for all works of fiction that defy the common laws of our reality such as fantasy, superhero stories, etc. Works of science fiction use scientific fact and theory as the basis for their plots, worldbuilding, etc., and this is what separates them from other genres.\n\nNew York Public Library’s “A Beginner’s Guide to Science Fiction” by Amanda Pagan\n\nIn a previous Book Riot article, I delved into the megazoid umbrella that makes up speculative fiction. Under that umbrella is science fiction, and then under that, well, is still a whole lot. We’ll start with some classic sub-genres, and then I’ll include a few newer ones.\n\nIt’s important to note that there are examples included that will fall into multiple sub-genres. There is a lot of crossover in science fiction, just as there is in fantasy, or really any genre. There may be a title you find to be a classic example of a sub-genre that I have listed in another. I am aware of this. Also, I tried to include examples that aren’t necessarily the very first titles to come to mind. So for all of you “how did [insert title] not make the list?!” people, yes I know, I did that on purpose.\n\nSpace Opera\n\nThis one is challenging to define succinctly because it’s often thrown around. From my experience, a space opera is the science fiction equivalent of an epic fantasy. Think sweeping story arcs, following many characters. Not only is it mostly set in space, but it spans multiple locations (planets, space stations, galaxies). A good space opera has an epic plot and many subplots, often expanding into a series of books. Obvious classics of space opera include Dune by Frank Herbet and The Foundation Trilogy by Isaac Asimov, but there are plenty of excellent contemporary space operas that astound and entertain as well. On a Red Station, Drifting by Aliette de Bodard and Ninefox Gambit by Yoon Ha Lee are a couple good examples.\n\nSteampunk\n\nSteampunk is as much a fashion and cultural phenomenon as it is a sub-genre of science fiction. Technically speaking, steampunk is science fiction set in an alternate 19th century, where steam power has allowed for a technology boom. Think goggles as everyday gear (or fashion statement), steam-powered airships, etc. Now, there are stories billed as “steampunk” but are not set in the 19th century, and this can be a subject of hot debate concerning whether it counts as steampunk or not. Go forth and discuss or discourse, my social media friends. You can find a list of steampunk books in fellow Book Rioter Mary Kay McBrayer’s 2019 article “8 Unique Steampunk Reads.”\n\nApocalyptic/Dystopian Science Fiction\n\nWhew, is this another big sub-genre. Like other sub-genres listed here, this one can be broken down into even more sub-genres and has a lot of crossover with other sub-genres. From The Hunger Games by Suzanne Collins to Parable of the Sower by Octavia Butler, this sub-genre explores what happens during and/or after the world ends. Some stories take place during the implosion and right after, while other stories are set far into the future, seeing what happens to humanity long after the apocalypse.\n\nExample: Station Eleven by Emily St. John Mandel\n\nThis example also crosses over into literary speculative fiction, but it is a prime example of this sub-genre. It follows multiple characters as they experience a flu-like plague that wipes out most of humanity, and then navigate the United States’ Midwest in the aftermath. For those who are interested in Shakespeare, this also follows a troupe of actors as they put on Shakespeare plays on rebuilding communities. And if you want to continue the journey, it’s now a TV show!\n\nSci-Fi Horror\n\nAre you looking for some science fiction with a lot more dread? A lot more fear? Look no further than sci-fi horror. Space as a setting is naturally quite frightening; everything about it is deadly to human life. Think of the logline for the classic sci-fi/horror movie Alien: “In space, no one can hear you scream.” And when it comes to technology, there is always the question of ethics. How far is too far? With horror sci-fi, this question gets a terrifying answer. The Luminous Dead by Caitlin Starling is a great example of horror-rich sci-fi. And if you’re looking for a list, check out TOR Nightfire’s list “She Frightened Me With Science: 6 Sci-Fi Horror Novels.”\n\nSlipstream\n\nOne of my favorite speculative sub-genres, slipstream can have science fiction or fantasy elements. I wrote a deep dive on slipstream for Book Riot in 2021, which like silkpunk, doesn’t have a definition set in stone. In a nutshell, it’s fiction that can make you feel very strange. This strangeness can derive from multiple genres, from fantasy to science fiction. It’s been described as a post-modern crossover genre and is often used with contemporary and literary fiction that has genre elements. One such science fiction-ish example is Helen Oyeyemi’s recent novel Peaces, which follows a couple and their pet mongoose as they navigate a seemingly-endless train.\n\nA Very Large But Very Tasty Layer Cake\n\nScience fiction has so many sub-genres, this post could really become a book-length primer. Alien invasions, time travel, and science fiction romance are all sub-genres of science fiction as well. Many of these sub-genres can meld and mesh with the sub-genres listed above. There’s so much to explore, but alas, deadlines!\n\nHopefully this post acts as a point of discovery. Perhaps there’s a new sub-genre you’d never heard of before and now want to explore all its facets. If so, I’ve done my job, and I wish you luck on your journey, bookish space rangers.\n\nAdditional Book Riot Reading\n\nWhat Is Science Fiction?"
