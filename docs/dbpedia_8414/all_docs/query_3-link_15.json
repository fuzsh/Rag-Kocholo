        "text": "Want to know how to write a sci-fi novel?\n\nStart asking big questions.\n\nWhat if our phones were embedded in our hands and corporations could advertise to us in our dreams?\n\nWhat if Earth gradually transformed into a spinning orb of dry dust and humans evolved to survive it?\n\nSuppose there was a planet that was exactly like this one except that everybodyâs hands were on backwards?\n\nReally, all fiction poses a question. And as far as Iâm concerned, one of the best parts of being a writer is applying my imagination to find the answer. But thereâs something different about science fiction.\n\nI think itâs that blend of extraordinary and ordinaryârecognizable characters living under remarkable circumstances. And the way an airtight science fiction novel gives you the chilling sense that the authorâs made-up world is entirely possibleâ¦\n\nâ¦that their wide-sweeping, world-shifting âWhat If?â presents a reality that doesnât feel so different from our own.\n\nThereâs no denying it. Great science fiction is a work of wonder. Iâll be honest: if you want to know how to write a sci-fi novel, youâve got your work cut out for you. But you can handle it. A little perseverance and a lot of curiosity get you far in this genre.\n\nIâm about to walk you through the key points of writing science fiction. Iâll cover all the main elements of a story and clarify how you can adapt your approach to those elements to fit the genre.\n\nFirst, letâs start with the question that stands at the heart of this entire article:\n\nWhat Makes Sci-Fi Different?\n\nScience fiction lands under the umbrella of speculative fiction. This means sci-fiâlike fantasy and horrorâinvolves elements that do not and have never existed in reality as we know it.\n\nYou can probably guess what sets sci-fi apart from other speculative genres. (Psst. Itâs the science-y bit.)\n\nNow, as a science fiction writer, youâll build a story concept around a Big What If. âWhat if we had the ability to reanimate dead humans?â âWhat if we cloned dinosaurs?â Big questions like these are the key to how to write a sci-fi novel.\n\nSci-fi asks massive questionsâquestions that examine things like power structures and the risks of scientific advancements. Most other genres stick to more intimate inquiries. âWhat if your ex crashed your honeymoon?â Or, âWhat if people kept getting murdered on a stranded train?â\n\nAnd then, of course, there is the science of science-fiction. Thatâs another defining characteristicâone that deserves its own section.\n\nHow Science-y Does Science Fiction Have to Be?\n\nFor many aspiring science fiction writers, the question of how to write a sci-fi novel comes down to, âHow much science do I really need to know?â\n\nIf you love the genre but arenât looking to get a degree in aeronautics, take heart. Youâll probably have to do some research to write a science fiction novel that makes sense. But you might be able to get away with less than you think. It all depends on your specific story.\n\nThe first question to ask yourself is whether you're writing hard science fiction or soft science fiction.\n\nHard Science Fiction\n\nHard science fiction places a lot of focus on scientific laws. This type of sci-fi novel tends to highlight the physical sciences, like chemistry, physics, and astronomy. If you're writing a hard science fiction novel, you may need to explain things like:\n\nHow characters use science to solve problems\n\nThe scientific laws or technological innovations that made the world of your novel possible\n\nWhat characters must to do survive in their world and why\n\nHow characters operate the technology of their world\n\nâExamples: The Martian by Andy Weir, Red Mars by Kim Stanley Robinson, The Andromeda Strain by Michael Crichton.\n\nSoft Science Fiction\n\nWhen someone refers to a sci-fi novel as âsoft science fiction,â they could mean a couple things.\n\nThey might mean the book focuses on the âsoft sciencesâ like psychology, political science, and anthropology.\n\nOr they might simply mean the book places more focus on conveying human emotions than clarifying scientific details. This definition is where the line gets murky. There are a good number of sci-fi novels that champion accurate, detailed science and go deep on the feels.\n\nThe main thing to know is that when readers know theyâre getting soft science fiction, they wonât expect you to explain all the nitty gritty scientific details that drive your story. You will need to know enough to make your world feel authentic. But you can probably get away with fewer hours in the library.\n\nExamples: Frankenstein by Mary Shelly, This is How You Lose the Time War by Amal El-Mohtar and Max Gladstone, The Female Man by Joanna Russ.\n\nWhether you choose to write hard or soft science fiction, the science must be integral to your novel. It should influence the conflict, throw obstacles in your protagonistâs path, and color the world of your story.\n\nHaving said thatâ¦\n\nThe Science-to-Fiction Ratio\n\nWhile science is the defining characteristic of your sci-fi masterpiece, it's important to remember that, ultimately, you are writing a novel. Your readers are here to find out what your characters do and what happens to them in the world of your What If.\n\nIn this sense, the answer to how to write a sci-fi novel is the same as the answer to how to write any novel. You must tell a compelling story about well-rounded characters who face extraordinary conflicts.\n\nSimply put, the science should serve your story. Any scientific elements that don't relate to the plot or build out the world in a meaningful way will feel like distractions, tangents, and wasted space.\n\nNow that we've hashed out the expectations of the sci-fi genre, let's dig into the actual how of how to write a sci-fi novel.\n\nFind the Big What If\n\nThat said, your Big What If has a major role to play in your book. This thought experiment sets the scene, informs the conflict, and sets parameters for character growth.\n\nSo how do you find the guiding question of your sci-fi novel?\n\nOne great strategy is to read a ton of science fiction. This is essential anyway, because you can't write good science fiction if you don't read good science fiction.\n\nFor every science fiction book you read, challenge yourself to state the Big What If in a single sentence. This exercise alone might spark some ideas for your own big questions.\n\nIf that doesnât work, practice approaching everything around you with deeper curiosity. Feeling hungry right now? What would it be like to live in a world where you could order delivery just by thinking about it? Or if there was wearable tech that would tell you what youâre craving?\n\nTake inspiration from technology. Look at what's going on in politics, whether it's world politics or PTA politics. Reimagine historical events. Explore social justice issues or dream up your own utopia and poke holes in it.\n\nThen, when you sit down to write your sci-fi novel, let that question touch everything from your conflicts to your setting to your character arcs.\n\nCreate Compelling Sci-Fi Characters\n\nJust as with any other novel, your sci-fi novel is about a character who wants something, endures a conflict while trying to pursue that thing, and undergoes a transformation (unless they don't).\n\nYou can find a shocking amount of character development resources in DabbleU. For now, I'll just give you a quick overview.\n\nGreat characters have:\n\nA wound in their past (sometimes called âthe Ghostâ)\n\nA flawed philosophy based on that wound (âthe Lieâ)\n\nClear motivation\n\nA specific goal\n\nA need (They often don't know what this need is and won't know until the end of act two.)\n\nFears, strengths, weaknesses, and flaws\n\nA character arcâa journey of transformation (or an ongoing refusal to transform, in the case of a flat arc)\n\nThese elements are especially crucial in science fiction. Your sci-fi novel presents your reader with a world that is wildly different from the one they know. Well-developed characters provide a portal allowing your reader to access and experience this world authentically.\n\nThey may not know what itâs like to live in the world where the Hunger Games is a thing. But they understand the drive to protect oneâs family at all costs.\n\nYour unique challenge as a sci-fi author is to make sure the Big What If of your story ties into your character development.\n\nWhat wounds might your character have suffered because they live in the reality of your novel? Do they have their own philosophy regarding your thought experiment? How is their goal related to your Big What If?\n\nNot every single aspect of your character's life and identity needs to be defined by your thought experiment. But your reader needs to see that thereâs a reason you created this specific character to fight this specific battle in this specific world.\n\nNow, about that battleâ¦\n\nGive Your Conflict the Sci-Fi Treatment\n\nIn the simplest possible terms, conflict happens when obstacles threaten to prevent your character from achieving their goal.\n\nThese should be massive obstacles standing between them and their high-stakes goal. You want the conflict to push your character to their limits. Force them to reveal their weaknesses, confront their flaws, and question long-held beliefs.\n\nThere are six types of external conflict. I encourage you to explore each one in-depth in this article. You can use any of those six in a science fiction novel. However, there are three categories of conflict that are particularly ripe for the sci-fi treatment. These are:\n\nCharacter vs. technology\n\nCharacter vs. society\n\nCharacter vs. fate or destiny\n\nNow, in addition to wrestling with an external antagonist, your character needs to fight an internal battle.\n\nAre they in the midst of an identity crisis? Are they facing a moral dilemma? Do the unique circumstances of their world force them to see relationships in a new light or question the beliefs they were taught?\n\nThis is your characterâs internal conflict and it gives your reader a reason to invest emotionally in that characterâs journey.\n\nThe secret to writing great conflict is to weave internal and external conflicts together. What's going on outside your character should make things even worse on the inside and vice versa. If that sounds confusing and complicated, this article should help.\n\nPlot the Journey\n\nOnce you've created your characters and designed your conflict, you can smash these elements together in the form of a plot.\n\nAnd how do you write a sci-fi novel plot?\n\nWell, every plot, regardless of genre, should consist of five main elements:\n\nExposition\n\nRising action\n\nClimax\n\nFalling action\n\nResolution\n\nThe way you actually structure these five elements in your novel can vary. You might choose to follow the hero's journey, three-act structure, the Fichtean curve... it's your call. (To further explore your options, I recommend starting here.)\n\nHowever you choose to structure your novel, remember to keep your Big What If in mind as you build your story. Make sure your grand speculation has a role to play from beginning to end.\n\nQuick Tip\n\nLet your plot reveal your thought experiment. First-time sci-fi writers are sometimes tempted to introduce their world to the reader through prologue, dumping loads of exposition about the technology or uprising that led to this unfamiliar reality.\n\nItâs way more effective to let your readers discover your world and premise through the eyes of an active characterâsomeone they can connect with.\n\nâThe Giver doesnât open with an explanation about how some people got the harebrained idea to create a utopia where no one had memories of sadness.\n\nInstead, the reader meets this kid whoâs freaked out by the sight of an unfamiliar plane flying over his neighborhood. Thereâs the urgent order that all citizens must go inside. Then thereâs the second announcement reassuring them that it was only a lost pilot who would be âreleased.â\n\nââThere was an ironic tone to that final message, as if the Speaker found it amusing; and Jonas had smiled a little, though he knew what a grim statement it had been.â\n\nIn just two pages, we understand that this is a community under tight protectionâa world that our protagonist perceives as safe compared to the world beyond. And yet, thereâs a sinister vibe here with all this âreleasedâ business. So we keep reading to find out what thatâs about.\n\nSet the Scene\n\nHow do you write a sci-fi novel setting?\n\nIt really depends. Science fiction worlds can vary widely. Your novel might take place on a different planet in a galaxy far, far away. Or it could take place on your block five years from now.\n\nThe first setting requires more extensive sci-fi worldbuilding than the second, but either way, you've got some work to do. Here are some quick tips for nailing your setting.\n\nBuild the World Around Your Big What If\n\nAfter all, the world of your science fiction novel is your thought experiment come to life.\n\nLetâs say your big question is âWhat if we all had smartphones embedded in our hands and corporations could advertise to us in our dreams?â Your next step is to start answering the question.\n\nIt would probably change our relationship with privacy, right? Is there any concept of solitude in this world? How does this constant connectedness affect professional standards? Is hustle culture running rampant in your sci-fi world?\n\nWhat about free thought? Is it possible in a world where advertisers can infiltrate your mind? What would the world look like if corporations could brainwash people into wanting what they wanted them to want?\n\nWould corporations basically run the world? How would they design cities to further their cause?\n\nYou get the idea.\n\nMake it Make Sense\n\nScience fiction that feels possible is a spine-tingling, brain-exploding thing.\n\nIt doesn't matter how close we are to achieving the kind of scientific innovations spotlighted in your book. If the science makes sense, feels like a natural extension of the science we know, and everything in your sci-fi world follows a clear logic, it will feel possible to your readers.\n\nOn the flip side:\n\nDon't Abuse the Privilege of Working in an Imaginative Genre\n\nBy this, I mean donât introduce an invention two-thirds of the way through the book just to get a character out of pickle. Your readers wonât like it.\n\nThis is known as deus ex machina and it ruins great stories.\n\nFill in the Blanks\n\nIf your story is set in the speculative future, imagine the journey from our present reality to the future world you created. You donât have to rehash the whole saga in your book, but consider whether that backstory might have left clues behind.\n\nDoes your protagonistâs city bear the scars of an android uprising? Are there any lingering mementos of a lost time? What are the hollowed-out phone booths and mildewy Yellow Pages of your sci-fi world?\n\nInspire Awe\n\nLast but not least, give the people what they came for. Even if your sci-fi novel is set in a dystopian hellscape, it still has the power to strike wonder into the eager souls of your readers.\n\nUse the five senses in your scene descriptions to make your extraordinary world vivid. Polish your tone until it sparks the sense of dread or reckless optimism you want your readers to feel.\n\nIf you can do that, youâll get them scrambling for Book Two.\n\nHow to Write a Sci-Fi Novel Without Losing Your Mind\n\nIf your mind is reeling by now, I get it. Writing a science fiction novel requires you to master all the elements that go into any other novel and then add half a billion more considerations.\n\nBut if you love living in the world of science fiction, this challenge is bound to be fun. The toughest partâother than dealing with writer's blockâis figuring out how to organize the brilliant chaos your imagination spews forth.\n\nEvery writer has their own way, but hereâs my two cents.\n\nCheck out the Dabble writing tool.
