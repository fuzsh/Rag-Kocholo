        "text": "One of the big issues with speculative fiction novels I see when I write book reviews is the disparity in the quality, seemingly more than many other form of literature science fiction and it's brother fantasy seem to be an area with a massive range in the ability of the authors. This appears to be compounded by the literary explosion that is \"self publishing\".\n\nDon't get me wrong there are some incredibly talented authors who self publish but this new freedom has also opened the flood gates for every man and his monkey to \"have a go\" and seperating the good from the bad can be very time consuming.\n\nI do firmly believe that despite this the very best genre authors are more talented by far than the very best literary authors."
