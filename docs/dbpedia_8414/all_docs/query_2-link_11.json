        "text": "Science fiction books, often abbreviated as sci-fi, are a genre of literature that explores imaginative and speculative concepts. It’s risen drastically since the advent of Internet, as writers can leverage creative powers with immaculate researches. Sci-fi books can delve into a wide range of themes, including artificial intelligence (AI), dystopian societies, genetic engineering, virtual reality, interstellar travel, and the ethical and moral implications of scientific progress.\n\nThere are many other subgenres and crossover categories within the vast realm of science fiction. Each subgenre offers unique themes, settings, and storytelling approaches, catering to a wide range of readers’ interests. Presenting a list of sci-fi genres types with examples from now and then…\n\n1)\n\nHard Science Fiction: This subgenre focuses on scientific accuracy and explores speculative concepts based on real or plausible scientific principles. Examples of this genre include The Martian by Andy Weir and Red Mars by Kim Robinson.\n\n2)\n\nSoft Science Fiction: Soft sci-fi places less emphasis on scientific accuracy and instead focuses more on social, philosophical, or psychological aspects of the story. Examples include The Last Policeman by Ben Winters and Dune by Frank Herbert.\n\n3)\n\nSpace Opera: Space operas are grand, epic adventures set in space, often involving interstellar travel, futuristic societies, and large-scale conflicts. Ancillary Justic by Ann Leckie & Old Man’s War by John Scalzi are the books of this subgenre.\n\n4)\n\nCyberpunk: Cyberpunk books typically depict a dystopian future where advanced technology, computers, and cybernetic enhancements are prevalent, often exploring themes of corporate control, artificial intelligence, and virtual reality. Latest published book in the category is The Superflare by Andrew Berger.\n\n5)\n\nDystopian and Post-Apocalyptic: These subgenres present societies or worlds in a state of collapse, often due to environmental disasters, oppressive governments, or other catastrophic events. Most of the books from this genre are converted into motion films or series on OTT platforms. Examples are — The Passage by Justin Cronin & Station Eleven by Emily St. John Mandel.\n\n6)\n\nAlternate History: Alternate history sci-fi explores speculative scenarios where historical events unfolded differently, resulting in alternative timelines or worlds. Best examples include: The Years of Rice and Salt by Kim Stanley & Farthing by Jo Walton.\n\n7)\n\nTime Travel: Time travel books revolve around characters traveling backward or forward in time, often dealing with the implications and consequences of altering the past or future. Best reads in the genre are An Ocean of Minutes by Thea Lim & The Midnight Library by Matt Haig.\n\n8)\n\nSteampunk: Steampunk blends Victorian-era aesthetics and technology with elements of science fiction, creating a unique retro-futuristic setting. In simple words, a genre of science fiction that has a historical setting and typically features steam-powered machinery rather than advanced technology. It came into prominence in the 1980s and early 1990s. Some examples of this type include novels, The Difference Engine by William Gibson and Bruce Sterling & Soulless by Gail Carriger.\n\n9)\n\nMilitary Science Fiction: This subgenre focuses on military conflicts in futuristic settings, featuring advanced weaponry, interstellar wars, and military strategies. The best example in the genre is the novel, Agent Sharp written by an Indian author Bakchod Writer, another sterling book in the segment is Implacable Alpha by W. Michael Gear.\n\n10)"
