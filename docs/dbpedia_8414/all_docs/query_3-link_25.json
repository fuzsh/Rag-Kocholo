        "text": "Fantasy and science fiction are two of the most exciting genres in publishing at the moment. Here, two Penguin editors break down the 'SFF' genre and give their top tips for writers looking to publish their novels.\n\nWhat makes a book science fiction or fantasy?\n\n“Fantasy books have a fantastical element incorporated in some way – whether it’s an alternate world, or the real world but with a fantastical creature or a touch of magic,” explains Carmen McCullough, Publisher at Penguin Random House Children’s.\n\n“Science fiction sits in a slightly different space as it doesn’t necessarily have to feature magic or fantastical spaces – it creatively depicts the impact of imagined or real science on our world or alternate worlds. This could be anything from a romance set in space to a thriller set against the backdrop of a climate change apocalypse. And of course, the two categories often overlap.”\n\nThese categories are vast, with a huge range of sub-genres falling under them. “I’m working on a really varied range of titles, from a gorgeous gothic fairytale romance inspired by Polish folklore, Where the Dark Stands Still, by A. B. Poranek to an accessible and epic new romantasy series, Heir of Storms, and a high concept love story that defies the boundaries of time and space – Our Infinite Fates, by Laura Steven.”\n\n“The world is so big, which serves as a real plus to you as a writer,” adds Jorgie Bain, Assistant Editor at Penguin Michael Joseph. “When it comes to sub-genres, fantasy has so many that the possibilities feel endless. We have the newly named 'romantasy' that has always been around but found its spotlight recently, and 'epic fantasy' where books can feel more classically written, grander in the adventure scale, or the world building is very intricate. We have magical realism which literary fantasy and urban fantasy fall under – something that's drawing from the real world but putting a magical spin on it. And then, of course, we have science fiction and horror that have a whole array of sub-genres falling under them.”\n\nWhat about writing for younger readers?\n\n“Middle-grade titles tend to be for readers aged 8-12. The protagonists are of a similar age or slightly older as there is an aspirational quality to reading fiction, particularly as a child where you might be keen to read about a character a little older than yourself,” explains Carmen. “Young adult (YA) protagonists tend to be late teens and whilst there might be some adults in the story, they don’t usually take centre stage.”\n\n“It’s an interesting time in the YA market as the lines are increasingly blurring between YA and adult titles. Many titles now occupy what we call the 'crossover area' of the market, where the story could potentially sit in either category depending on the vision of the editor and the direction of the editorial work.”\n\nWhat are editors looking for in a debut novelist?\n\n“We look for the selling point by asking: what marks is it hitting? Where will it be positioned? What other books are they similar to while also doing something different?” shares Jorgie. “And then beyond that, a well thought out plot and character development is important, alongside great world-building, if that's applicable. It's important to remember that when reading a lot of pitches per day, having that key distinguisher is vital. And of course, the writing is something that everyone looks at, no matter the genre.”\n\nBooks that Carmen and Jorgie have worked on...\n\nWhat advice would you give to unpublished writers working on books in this space?\n\n“Read widely within the genre to familiarise yourself with what people are enjoying and what stories engage you the most. As readers, it’s important that we feel the excitement of the author come through in the writing,” advises Carmen. If you're creating an alternate fantasy world, pay attention to world-building as well: “Readers want to feel as if they’ve been transported into the story, so making the world feel believable is key. Without that foundation, it’s hard for them to feel invested in the characters and the plot.”\n\n“As mentioned, the world of SFFH (science fiction, fantasy, horror) is vast, so knowing where you want your book to sit can be helpful in the writing process,” says Jorgie. “Establish your audience, be bold in the route you want to go down and be completely open to the editorial process. You’re creating a whole world with your words, so be creative and have fun!”\n\nNetworking can be a good way to develop your writing too. “The authors I work with benefit massively from networking with other authors that are both published and not yet published. Go to author events and join networks!”"
