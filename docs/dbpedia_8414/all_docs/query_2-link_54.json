        "text": "Which world, or sub-genre, does your novel belong to?\n\nBookstores have general genre sections in which to categorize their books making it easier for consumers to locate a specific subject. However, within each genre there are always dozens of sub-genres to help narrow down a reader’s search.\n\nScience fiction is no different, encompassing a large number of categories. Novels in this genre often deal either with a natural science or technological science, but the variances can go even deeper.\n\nHere is a brief breakdown of some of the most popular sub-genres within sci-fi.\n\nThe sub-genre of Alternate History asks the question, “How would our world be changed if a specific historical event had ended differently?” These books use actual historical settings to explore a fantasy world that does not exist but could have existed. A similar sub-genre is the Parallel Universe. These works consist of one or more worlds that coexist with our own, often reflecting an almost identical reality but with only minor differences that may or may not affect a major change.\n\nArtificial Intelligence and Robot sub-genres are closely related in that they are both computer science based. These sub-genres reflect the idea of intelligent and self-sustaining machines. On the flip side, Virtual Reality stories dive into a world where computer-simulated environments play a role within which the characters are able to interact.\n\nIn recent years the idea of an Apocalyptic, Post-apocalyptic or Dystopian society have become quite popular among audiences. These novels deal with end of the world events and how mankind is able to survive in the aftermath of an almost global extinction. They are often a man vs. nature conflict and sometimes include a corrupt government that challenges human survival.\n\nThe Steampunk sub-genre of science fiction is by far one of the most popular. This sub-genre is set in the 19th century when steam powered engines were still in use and it often crosses over with the Alternate History category. Mixed with the traditional lifestyle of this era are more modern technologies such as computers, robots and futuristic machinery or weaponry.\n\nAlien Invasion of earth or First Contact between humans and another unknown life form are other popular sci-fi sub-genres. In recent decades the subject of Mutants—humans that change or develop in some way to produce superpowers or defy nature—is another well-liked category. With the rise in popularity of superheroes both in books and on the screen, this sub-genre continues to grow.\n\nClosely related to the previous categories are Space Exploration and Space Opera. The idea of Space Exploration usually stems from modern day reality answering the “What if?” question of a major space discovery and the effects on our planet or the near future. These books usually attempt to stay within the confines of our current knowledge of science and space travel. The category of Space Opera is often set on a distant planet in a universe unlike our own, with a mixture of human and alien characters, and various unknown languages and cultures. This sub-genre allows the story to go against the laws of physics and often makes the impossible, possible, through a source of magic or power.\n\nThe Time Travel sub-genre includes stories where one or more of the characters travel to any point within history or into the future. This subject remains a popular category within scifi.\n\nYour work may cross over into multiple sub-genres within the world of science fiction. Make an effort to choose just one or two categories to narrow down your theme so it will be easier to market when the time comes. It’s important to know your book’s sub-genre so you can discover your target audience and in turn, your readers will be able to find your book!"
