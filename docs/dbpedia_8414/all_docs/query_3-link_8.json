        "text": "\"Science fiction is a time-sensitive subject in literature. Usually futuristic, science fiction speculates about alternative ways of life made possible by technological change, and hence has sometimes been called \"speculative fiction.\" Like fantasy, and often associated with it, science fiction envisions alternative worlds with believably consistent rules and structures, set apart somehow from the ordinary or familiar world of our time and place. Distinct from fantasy, however, science fiction reflects on technology to consider how it might transform the conditions of our existence and change what it means to be human. \"Sci Fi\" is the genre that considers what strange new beings we might become-what mechanical forms we might invent for our bodies, what networks and systems might nourish or tap our life energies, and what machine shells might contain our souls.\"\n\n--Dr. Beshero-Bondar\n\nWhen you begin to research your topic in the area of sci-fi, be aware that there are many sub genres that may pique your interest. Here are some points to consider when developing your paper:\n\nDevelop a topic that asks a question or poses a problem that interests you.\n\nSelect appropriate search terms for your subject. For sci-fi you may want to search by author/title/sub genre or keywords. Suggested terms may include:\n\nandroids\n\ncyborgs\n\ncyberpunk\n\npostcyberpunk\n\nspeculative fiction\n\nalternate history\n\nmilitary sf\n\nsuperhuman\n\napocalyptic\n\nspace opera\n\nspace western\n\ntime travel\n\nSearch PittCat and subject oriented databases.\n\nRevise your topic. Determine how you will answer your question.\n\nEvaluate your resources carefully!\n\nWhen in doubt, contact your librarian."
