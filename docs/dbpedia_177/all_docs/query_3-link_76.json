        "text": "In 1951, Pete Hernandez, a young Mexican-American cotton picker, was accused of murdering Joe Espinoza and charged with life imprisonment by an all Anglo-Saxon jury in Edna, Texas. Mexican American civil rights lawyers Gus Garcia and Carlos Cadena from San Antonio and James de Anda from Houston, Texas took the Hernandez’ case to the United States Supreme Court. On May 2, 1954, under Chief Justice Earl Warren, who was governor of California during the Mendez v. Westminster case in 1947, the Court unanimously ruled that the 14th Amendment protects those beyond the members of the “two class theory” and that Mexican Americans were a “special class” in Jackson County, Texas.\n\nDespite more than 100 years of citizenship rights under the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo (1848) and post WWII integration into the local economy, Mexicans Americans in Texas endured segregation in systemic jury discrimination, which reached a climax in 1951 with the Hernandez case. Despite being 14% of Edna's population, no Mexican American had executed their citizenship rights as jury commissioners, petit jurors, or grand jurors in over 50 Texas counties with a predominant Mexican American population since 1926. The lawyers claimed that the all Anglo-Saxon jury, which indicted Hernandez, denied him his equal protection under the 14th Amendment.\n\nThe Texas Court of Appeals held that the 14th Amendment applied to a “two class theory”—classifying Mexican Americans as a special class within the white race while legal journal arguments pointed to inclusion of interclass discrimination under this clause. With financial assistance from LULAC, the Pan American Union, the American G.I. Forum, and locals from Edna, Garcia, Cadena, and de Anda convinced the Supreme Court to grant Hernandez another trial with a jury of his peers. They indicted and imprisoned him for murder. There remains limited documentation on this case because records have been vanished or hidden.\n\nTimeline\n\nResources"
