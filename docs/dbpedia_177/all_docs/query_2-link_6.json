        "text": "Young Texans: Demographic Overview PART 1 OF A TWO-PART SERIES\n\nby Olga Garza, David Green, Spencer Grubbs and Shannon Halbrook\n\nTexas is growing fast, and unlike many other states, its young population is growing as well. According to U.S. Census Bureau data, one of every 10 persons under the age of 18 in the U.S. lives in Texas.\n\nThis is the first of a two-part series on young Texans. In this issue, we’ll take a look at what’s driving our state’s population growth and the demographic characteristics of young Texans. Next month, we’ll explore the educational landscape and job prospects for this growing segment of our population.\n\nWhat Drives Population Growth\n\nThe Census Bureau estimated Texas’ total population at 29 million in 2019, and the Texas Demographic Center (TDC) projects it will rise to about 47.3 million by 2050. In addition to the “natural” increase driven by births, this surge is being driven by people attracted to Texas by our strong economy.\n\nThus, population growth in Texas is based on two elements: natural increase and net migration from other states and nations.\n\nNatural increase occurs when the state’s birth rate is higher than its death rate. Natural increase is the primary source of Texas population growth, although it has declined somewhat in recent years — from nearly 213,600 additional residents in 2011 to about 175,900 in 2019 — according to Census Bureau estimates. Texas’ natural increase in 2019, however, ranked second only to California’s, the nation’s most populous state.\n\nNet migration is the sum of domestic migration and international migration minus out-migration (i.e., those leaving the state). Since 2011, total net migration to Texas has varied, reaching a recent peak in 2015, receding sharply thereafter and then surging again in 2019 (Exhibit 1). Net domestic migration followed a similar pattern, falling sharply after 2015 and then coming back strongly, increasing by nearly 50 percent in 2019. International migration, meanwhile, has fallen by nearly 45 percent since 2015.\n\nEven so, between 2010 and 2019, Texas saw the second-highest cumulative net migration among states, with more than 1.9 million new residents (Exhibit 2). In 2018 (most recent data available), Texas’ largest source of net domestic migration was California, with more than 48,000, followed by Florida, Missouri and Maryland.\n\nWithin the state, TDC projects the largest population increases around Texas’ thriving urban areas, as expected, but also in areas of West Texas and the Panhandle (Exhibit 3). Some areas of the Permian Basin region, in fact, are expected to see more than 300 percent population growth by 2050, driven largely by the area’s oil industry.\n\nExhibit 1: Elements of Population Growth in Texas, 2011-2019\n\nExhibit 1 Year Natural Increase Net International Migration Net Domestic Migration Total Migration 2011 213,583 69,059 120,672 189,731 2012 2208,912 84,959 141,740 226,699 2013 2205,821 79,798 107,657 187,455 2014 2203,609 107,045 160,260 267,305 2015 2214,427 117,660 172,048 289,708 2016 2212,171 110,866 120,910 231,776 2017 2197,199 98,188 84,790 182,978 2018 2177,745 71,278 83,795 155,073 2019 2175,878 65,044 125,660 190,704\n\nSource: U.S. Census Bureau\n\nExhibit 2: Cumulative Net Migration, April 1, 2010, to July 1, 2019: Top and Bottom Five States\n\nStates with Highest Net Migration Florida 2,396,653 Texas 1,964,386 North Carolina 639,170 Washington 595,848 Arizona 571,043\n\nStates with Lowest Net Migration Connecticut -63,899 Michigan -73,053 New Jersey -192,493 Illinois -622,928 New York -681,210\n\nSource: U.S. Census Bureau\n\nOlder, but Younger\n\nTexas’ population is growing across all population groups. Between 2010 and 2018, Texas added about 3.5 million residents, more than any other state. That’s a 13.9 percent increase, more than twice the nation’s 5.8 percent growth. Texas was one of the fastest-growing states in this period — a remarkable feat considering the state’s already large population.\n\nTexas is aging as the huge baby-boom generation enters its retirement years, as is the nation and the entire developed world. In the 2010-2018 period, the number of Texans aged 65 and older rose by 1 million, a 38.5 percent increase; in the U.S., growth for this age group was 30.2 percent.\n\nWhere Texas stands out, however, is its under-18 population growth.\n\nSince 2010, Texas saw the highest rate of under-18 population growth among the six most populous states and the second-highest in the nation, behind North Dakota. In four of the six most populous states, the under-18 population actually fell in this period — as it did in the U.S. as a whole (Exhibit 4).\n\nExhibit 4: Change in the Under-18 Population of the U.S. and the Six Largest States, 2010-2018\n\nState 2010 under-18 population 2018 under-18 population Total Change Percent Change Texas 6,877,757 7,398,099 520,342 7.6% Florida 3,997,523 4,229,081 231,558 5.8 California 9,280,524 8,989,955 -290,569 -3.1 Pennsylvania 2,786,430 2,648,911 -137,519 -4.9 New York 4,319,807 4,068,102 -251,705 -5.8 Illinois 3,123,255 2,857,266 -265,989 -8.5 United States 74,120,770 73,399,342 -721,428 -1.0\n\nSource: U.S. Census Bureau\n\nIn numerical terms, Texas’ increase of 520,342 children between 2010 and 2018 topped that of all other states and far exceeded second-place Florida’s increase of 231,588. The nation’s total under-18 population fell by more than 700,000.\n\nLooking Toward 2050\n\nTDC projections through 2050 show these under-18 population growth trends continuing steadily. In the state as a whole, TDC predicts a 43 percent rise in the under-18 population by 2050, or 3.2 million more children. That’s more than seven times the 5.8 percent growth rate expected for the nation’s child population (Exhibit 5). By 2050, 22.7 percent of Texas’ population will be under 18.\n\nUnsurprisingly, TDC expects urban counties to top the list in numerical growth, with Harris County alone adding more than half a million children by 2050. Most of the 10 Texas counties with the highest projected under-18 growth will more than double their child populations (Exhibit 6).\n\nExhibit 7 lists the 10 counties TDC expects to have the fastest rate of under-18 growth. Andrews County, near Midland and Odessa, could see its under-18 population more than quadruple. In Kendall County, north of San Antonio, and Hays County, part of the Austin-Round Rock metropolitan area, the number of children could triple.\n\nExhibit 6: Top Texas Counties for Projected Under-18 Population Growth, 2020-2050\n\nCounty Rank 2020 2050 Total Change Percent Change Harris 1 1,330,726 1,882,981 552,255 41.5% Collin 2 258,321 555,220 296,899 114.9 Fort Bend 3 210,803 507,177 296,374 140.6 Denton 4 210,980 494,396 283,416 134.3 Williamson 5 147,318/td> 379,221/td> 231,903/td> 157.4 Bexar 6 533,642 762,073 228,431 42.8 Dallas 7 728,017 935,446 207,429 28.5 Montgomery 8 152,679 346,465 193,786 126.9 Tarrant 9 541,243 701,618 160,375 29.6 Hays /th> 10 52,771 156,781 104,010 197.1\n\nSources: U.S. Census Bureau and Texas Demographic Center\n\nExhibit 7: Texas Counties with the Fastest Projected Under-18 Population Growth, 2020-2050\n\nRank County 2020 2050 Total Increase Percent Change Andrews County 1 6,851 30,147 23,296 340.0% Kendall County 2 10,300 31,684 21,384 207.6 Hays County 3 52,771 156,781 104,010 197.1 Hemphill County 4 1,478 4,070 2,592 175.4 Midland County 5 52,452 142,856 90,404 172.4 Comal County 6 32,639 87,854 55,215 169.2 Williamson County 7 147,318 379,221 231,903 157.4 Crane County 8 1,775 4,459 2,684 151.2 Fort Bend County 9 210,803 507,177 296,374 140.6 Denton County 10 210,980 494,396 283,416 134.3\n\nSource: Texas Demographic Center\n\nRace and Ethnicity\n\nIn the last decade, Texas and Florida both saw huge increases in their Hispanic child populations, and the Asian population rose substantially in Texas and California as well. But Texas is the only one of the six largest states to show an increase among all racial and ethnic groups within its under-18 population (Exhibit 8).\n\nExhibit 8: Change in Under-18 Population by Race/Ethnicity, Six Largest States, 2008-2018\n\nState Asian Black Hispanic White California 101,924 -53,295 -29,934 -213,515 Texas 108,831 89,071 351,906 43,154 Florida 27,878 48,141 247,163 -43,411 New York 42,226 -66,891 58,362 -240,416 Pennsylvania 23,015 -8,421 72,820 -206,846 Illinois 20,611 -76,857 -6,669 -184,977\n\nSource: U.S. Census Bureau\n\nTexas is an ethnically diverse state, and current growth trends will make it more so. Through 2050, Texas will see its largest under-18 population increases among Hispanics (about 2 million children) and Asians (almost 1 million). The number of “Non-Hispanic Other” children — which, according to TDC, refers mainly to those who identify as two or more races — is expected to triple. Meanwhile, the population of white children in Texas is projected to show almost no growth through 2050 (Exhibit 9).\n\nIn the next 30 years, TDC expects Texas’ under-18 population to remain nearly 50 percent Hispanic, a considerably higher proportion than in the U.S. as a whole. Substantial increases in Asian and “Non-Hispanic Other” children will offset a proportional decline of almost 10 percent among white children by 2050.\n\nThe U.S. Census Bureau projects the nationwide share of Hispanic children to rise from 24.9 percent to 32.0 percent in 2060, while that of white children will fall from 51.1 percent to 36.5 percent.\n\nExhibit 9: Projected Texas Under-18 Population by Race/Ethnicity, 2020-2050\n\nYear White Black Hispanic Asian Non-Hispanic Other 2020 2,317,592 890,159 3,712,081 344,811 250,496 2021 2,322,156 902,468 3,754,305 357,525 258,486 2022 2,326,803 914,704 3,797,022 370,438 266,554 2023 2,332,313 927,124 3,839,288 384,468 274,571 2024 2,338,055 939,258 3,883,787 399,547 282,712 2025 2,342,894 951,012 3,927,101 415,753 290,953 2026 2,347,858 963,160 3,972,214 432,092 298,967 2027 2,354,642 976,761 4,024,036 451,032 307,369 2028 2,362,341 991,907 4,078,540 471,073 316,045 2029 2,368,275 1,007,417 4,143,353 490,732 326,447 2030 2,373,007 1,022,213 4,207,761 511,625 337,046 2031 2,376,694 1,036,425 4,271,697 533,741 347,877 2032 2,379,342 1,050,025 4,334,706 557,049 358,913 2033 2,381,039 1,063,208 4,396,970 581,746 370,097 2034 2,382,013 1,075,994 4,458,138 607,728 381,466 2035 2,382,256 1,088,529 4,518,182 634,998 392,985 2036 2,382,009 1,100,876 4,577,065 663,477 404,760 2037 2,381,421 1,113,126 4,634,564 693,283 416,728 2038 2,380,474 1,125,258 4,690,744 724,232 428,930 2039 2,379,471 1,137,416 4,745,553 756,298 441,392 2040 2,378,554 1,149,606 4,799,014 789,461 454,029 2041 2,377,763 1,161,957 4,851,211 823,670 466,936 2042 2,377,274 1,174,450 4,902,165 858,880 480,110 2043 2,377,236 1,187,218 4,952,205 895,048 493,480 2044 2,377,641 1,200,237 5,001,420 932,200 507,180 2045 2,378,622 1,213,489 5,049,974 970,288 521,109 2046 2,380,196 1,227,102 5,098,392 1,009,326 535,369 2047 2,382,421 1,241,094 5,147,102 1,049,348 549,904 2048 2,385,287 1,255,525 5,196,248 1,090,412 564,853 2049 2,388,703 1,270,398 5,246,376 1,132,617 580,186 2050 2,392,698 1,285,703 5,297,102 1,176,022 595,933\n\nSource: Texas Demographic Center\n\nToday’s Youth, Tomorrow’s Workforce\n\nToday’s rapid growth in Texas’ number of young people will boost our working-aged population in the future. The number of Texans aged 25 to 54 — generally considered the prime working years — is increasing at a far greater pace than in the U.S. as a whole. From 2010 to 2033, this population is expected to rise by 35 percent in Texas, compared to 9.6 percent in the U.S. Texas’ share of the entire U.S. population for this age group is expected to rise from 8.3 percent to 10.2 percent in 2033. In other words, Texas’ share of all Americans of working age will increase significantly (Exhibit 10).\n\nExhibit 10: Percent Change in Prime Working-Aged Population (25-54), Texas vs U.S., 2010-2033\n\nYear USA Texas 2010 0.0 0.0% 2011 0.0% .1% 2012 -0.1% 2.2% 2013 -0.1% 3.3% 2014 0.0% 4.8% 2015 0.3% 6.6% 2016 0.6% 8.2% 2017 0.9% 9.5% 2018 1.1% 10.8% 2019 1.4% 12.0% 2020 1.7% 13.3% 2021 2.1% 14.8% 2022 2.6% 16.3% 2023 3.2% 17.9% 2024 3.7% 19.4% 2025 4.1% 20.9% 2026 4.6% 22.4% 2027 5.1% 24.0% 2028 5.8% 25.9% 2029 6.6% 27.8% 2030 7.3% 29.6% 2031 8.2% 31.5% 2032 8.9% 33.4% 2033 9.6% 35.3%\n\nSource: JobsEQ and U.S. Census Bureau\n\nThe wave of baby-boom retirements is likely to slow economic growth in the U.S. and throughout much of the world. By definition, retirees produce less in economic terms, and they tend to spend less as well.\n\nThat said, given the rapid expansion in Texas’ young population and the state’s continuing role as an immigration magnet, our workforce is likely to help offset this transition — assuming it has the education and skills it needs to succeed in a challenging environment.\n\nIn next month’s issue of Fiscal Notes, look for the second and final part of this series on young Texans.\n\nFor detailed information on the demographic makeup of the Texas population, visit the Texas Demographic Center."
