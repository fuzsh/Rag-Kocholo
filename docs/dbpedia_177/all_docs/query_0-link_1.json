        "text": "County in Texas, United States\n\nNot to be confused with Deaf Smith County, Texas.\n\nCounty in Texas\n\nSmith County is a county in the U.S. state of Texas. As of the 2020 census, its population was 233,479.[1] Its county seat is Tyler.[2] Smith County is named for James Smith, a general during the Texas Revolution.\n\nSmith County is part of the Tyler metropolitan statistical area and the Tyler–Jacksonville combined statistical area.\n\nHistory\n\n[edit]\n\nFor thousands of years, indigenous peoples occupied this area of present-day Texas. The first known inhabitants of the area now known as Smith County were the Caddo Indians, who were recorded here until 1819. That year, a band of Cherokee, led by their chief, \"The Bowl\" (also known as Chief Bowles), migrated from Georgia and settled in what are now Smith and Rusk counties.[3] The Treaty of Bowles Village on February 23, 1836, between the Republic of Texas and the Cherokee and 12 affiliated tribes, gave all of Smith and Cherokee counties, as well as parts of western Rusk County, southern Gregg (formed from Rusk County in 1873) and southeastern Van Zandt counties to the tribes.[4]\n\nNative Americans remained on these lands until the Cherokee War in the summer of 1839, as part of European-American conflicts with Native Americans in Texas. The Cherokee were driven out of Smith County. In this period, Cherokee and other Native American nations were forced from the Southeast United States to west of the Mississippi River to Indian Territory during Indian Removal.\n\nAfter 1845, some Cherokee returned when Benjamin Franklin Thompson, a white man married to a Cherokee, purchased 10,000 acres of land in Rusk County and allowed them to settle. The Mount Tabor Indian Community developed here,[5] some six miles south of present-day Kilgore. The community later grew and incorporated areas near Overton, Arp, and Troup, Texas.\n\nIn July 1846, Smith County separated from the Nacogdoches District and was named for James Smith, a general of the Texas Revolution. At this time, Tyler was designated as the county seat.[6]\n\nCamp Fanin, a World War II US army replacement training facility, was located in the area known as Owentown, northeast of Tyler along US Hwy 271. Many of its original buildings still exist.\n\nDuring the American Civil War, Camp Ford was the largest Confederate prisoner-of-war camp west of the Mississippi River. Here, Sheriff Jim Reed of Collin County and Judge McReynolds, former chief justice of the district, were seized and lynched by \"Regulators\".\n\nThe original site of the camp stockade is now a public historic park owned by Smith County, as such it is exempted from making any County property tax contribution, and is managed by the Smith County Historical Society. The park contains a kiosk, a paved trail, interpretive signage, a cabin reconstruction, and a picnic area. To date, it has never been the site of a paid venue, nor public event. It is located on Highway 271, 0.8 miles north of Loop 323.\n\n20th century to present\n\n[edit]\n\nThe Smith County Historical Society, a 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization, was founded in 1959 by individuals and business firms dedicated to discovering, collecting, and preserving data, records, and other items relating to the history of Smith County. More information can be found at the Smith County Historical Society Website.[7]\n\nGeography\n\n[edit]\n\nAccording to the U.S. Census Bureau, the county has a total area of 950 square miles (2,500 km2), of which 921 square miles (2,390 km2) are land and 28 square miles (73 km2) (3.0%) are covered by water.[8]\n\nThe county infrastructure includes some 1,180 miles (1,900 km) of two-lane county road.\n\nMajor highways\n\n[edit]\n\nAdjacent counties\n\n[edit]\n\nWood County (north)\n\nUpshur County (northeast)\n\nGregg County (east)\n\nRusk County (southeast)\n\nCherokee County (south)\n\nHenderson County (southwest)\n\nVan Zandt County (northwest)\n\nCommunities\n\n[edit]\n\nCities\n\n[edit]\n\nTowns\n\n[edit]\n\nBullard (small part in Cherokee County)\n\nWinona\n\nCensus-designated place\n\n[edit]\n\nEmerald Bay\n\nUnincorporated communities\n\n[edit]\n\nGhost towns\n\n[edit]\n\nBurning Bush\n\nDouglas\n\nUtica\n\nDemographics\n\n[edit]\n\nHistorical population CensusPop.Note%± 18504,292—186013,392212.0%187016,53223.4%188021,86332.2%189028,32429.6%190037,37031.9%191041,74611.7%192046,76912.0%193053,12313.6%194069,09030.1%195074,7018.1%196086,35015.6%197097,09612.4%1980128,36632.2%1990151,30917.9%2000174,70615.5%2010209,71420.0%2020233,47911.3%2022 (est.)241,757[9]3.5%\n\nDemographic Profile of Smith County, Texas\n\n(NH = Non-Hispanic) Race / Ethnicity Pop 2010[12] Pop 2020[13] % 2010 % 2020 White alone (NH) 130,246 134,452 62.11% 57.59% Black or African American alone (NH) 37,195 38,003 17.74% 16.28% Native American or Alaska Native alone (NH) 734 746 0.35% 0.32% Asian alone (NH) 2,550 4,129 1.22% 1.77% Pacific Islander alone (NH) 63 77 0.03% 0.03% Some Other Race alone (NH) 225 695 0.11% 0.30% Mixed Race/Multi-Racial (NH) 2,613 8,096 1.25% 3.47% Hispanic or Latino (any race) 36,088 47,281 17.21% 20.25% Total 209,714 233,479 100.00% 100.00%\n\nNote: the US Census treats Hispanic/Latino as an ethnic category.

Hispanics/Latinos can be of any race.\n\nIn the 2010 U.S. census, Smith County had a population of 209,714, up from its 1850 population of 4,292.[12] By the 2020 census, its population increased to 233,479.[13] Among its population in 2010, the racial and ethnic makeup was 62.11% non-Hispanic white, 17.74% Black or African American, 0.35% American Indian or Alaska Native, 1.22% Asian alone, 0.03% Native Hawaiian or other Pacific Islander, 0.11% some other race, 3.47% multiracial, and 17.21% Hispanic or Latino of any race.

Johnson won re-election. At that time, most Blacks and Latinos in the county were still disenfranchised due to the state's discriminatory use of certain barriers.[20] The last Democrat to carry Smith County was incumbent President Harry S. Truman in 1948.[21] No Democrat has gained 30% of the county's vote in the past six elections. The last Democrat to gain more than 40% was Jimmy Carter from Georgia in 1976.\n\nUnited States presidential election results for Smith County, Texas[22] Year Republican Democratic Third party No. % No. % No. % 2020 69,080 68.85% 29,615 29.52% 1,639 1.63% 2016 58,930 69.52% 22,300 26.31% 3,538 4.17% 2012 57,331 72.02% 21,456 26.95% 814 1.02% 2008 55,187 69.36% 23,726 29.82% 648 0.81% 2004 53,392 72.48% 19,970 27.11% 302 0.41% 2000 43,320 71.46% 16,470 27.17% 834 1.38% 1996 32,171 59.97% 18,265 34.05% 3,207 5.98% 1992 27,753 47.03% 17,514 29.68% 13,739 23.28% 1988 34,658 64.67% 18,719 34.93% 215 0.40% 1984 40,740 72.60% 15,227 27.13% 152 0.27% 1980 28,236 64.61% 14,838 33.95% 626 1.43% 1976 22,238 56.62% 16,856 42.92% 181 0.46% 1972 23,671 74.37% 8,041 25.26% 115 0.36% 1968 12,079 39.51% 8,897 29.10% 9,595 31.39% 1964 12,960 50.88% 12,474 48.97% 38 0.15% 1960 12,042 57.84% 8,494 40.80% 285 1.37% 1956 12,255 65.21% 6,468 34.42% 69 0.37% 1952 10,947 56.40% 8,450 43.53% 13 0.07% 1948 3,181 28.13% 6,473 57.24% 1,655 14.63% 1944 936 9.81% 6,671 69.94% 1,931 20.25% 1940 1,557 14.19% 9,410 85.74% 8 0.07% 1936 660 8.47% 7,116 91.37% 12 0.15% 1932 750 9.15% 7,424 90.53% 27 0.33% 1928 3,493 59.85% 2,343 40.15% 0 0.00% 1924 1,079 18.85% 4,473 78.16% 171 2.99% 1920 707 15.13% 2,965 63.45% 1,001 21.42% 1916 773 22.21% 2,422 69.58% 286 8.22% 1912 485 14.93% 1,936 59.61% 827 25.46%\n\nSmith County is represented in the Texas House of Representatives by Matt Schaefer (R) of Tyler and the Texas Senate by Senator Bryan Hughes (R).
