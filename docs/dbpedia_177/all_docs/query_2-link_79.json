When we map the Demographic Index scores as a percentile and look at the upper quartile of all census block groups, this pattern of more susceptible communities in southern counties and in urban centers becomes even more evident (Figures 23-24). The raw index does not consider the size of the census block group, so it may be useful to look at the number of susceptible individuals within each Census block group as an added data point. ...\n\nContext 10\n\n... Roberts' research states that \"Freedom colonies (FCs) were often found in bottomland in low-lying areas. The legacy of these geographical vulnerabilities is highlighted by the FEMA -Hurricane Harvey Impact layer of the Texas Freedom Colony Atlas (Figure 30), which shows that 229 FCs are in fifty-three FEMA-designated counties, constituting 41% of total FCs.\" ...\n\nContext 11\n\n... to the 2022 Texas State Water Plan, 187 out of 254 counties in Texas are expected to see an increase in demand for water between 2020 and 2050 ( Figure 32). A sizable portion of that growth is driven by population growth. ...\n\nContext 12\n\n... a result of this increased demand, the SWP predicts that 208 out of 254 counties will experience unmet water needs (i.e., shortages) by 2050 unless new water supplies are developed (State Water Plan 2022, Figure 33). Regional Water Planning Groups are tasked with recommending water management strategies to address these shortages. ...\n\nContext 13\n\n... Water Planning Groups are tasked with recommending water management strategies to address these shortages. In many counties, these strategies include the development of new groundwater wells (Figure 34). The SWP's reliance on groundwater development as a strategic supply could raise equity concerns because well levels have experienced declines in many parts of the state (Meadows Report 2021). ...\n\nContext 14\n\n... | P a g e Figure 34.

Of high concern are those counties that have experienced well declines along the I-35 and I-45 corridors. ...\n\nContext 16\n\n... quality in this report refers to both drinking water quality and the quality of water in local rivers and streams since both can impact public health. For public drinking water supplies, it is possible to look at reports of drinking water violations to assess general issues with water quality ( Figure 37). Based on these violations, the size of the drinking water system has a significant impact on water quality, with smaller systems appearing to have the highest number of violations. ...\n\nContext 17\n\n... | P a g e Figure 37.
