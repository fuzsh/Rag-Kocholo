        "text": "download data\n\nThis data has been made publicly available \"as is\" for noncommercial public use.\n\nBy downloading the data, you agree to credit \"The National Association of Counties - County Explorer\" if you use the data in publications/reports, presentations, articles, or social media. For questions about the data, please contact us at research@naco.org\n\nDefinitions\n\nNotes\n\nInterpreting Census of Governments - Employment Statistics\n\nThe Census of Governments identifies the scope and nature of the nation's state and local government sector; provides authoritative benchmark figures of public finance and public employment.\n\nCounties with zero (0) employees within any of the categories implies that a county may either have no employees to serve that function or the county did not report employment levels for a given category to the U.S. Census Bureau.\n\nMaternity care desert: A county without a hospital or birth center offering obstetric care and without any obstetric providers. Please note that obstetric (OB) providers include obstetricians/gynecologists and certified nurse midwives/certified midwives (CNMs/CMs).\n\nLow access to care: Counties where residents may have low access to appropriate preventive, prenatal and postpartum care. These are counties where there was one or no hospital offering obstetric service and fewer than 60 obstetric providers per 10,000 births, and the proportion of women without health insurance was 10 percent or greater.\n\nModerate Access to Care: Counties where residents have access to one or no hospital offering obstetric service and fewer than 60 obstetric providers per 10,000 births, and the proportion of women without health insurance was less than 10 percent.\n\nAccess to Maternity Care: Counties where residents had full access to either two or more hospitals offering obstetric services or more than 60 obstetric providers per 10,000 births.\n\nMost Restrictive (Dillon's Rule): All counties in these states are under a strict Dillon's Rule doctrine and only have the authority and powers explicitly granted by the state.\n\nMixed/Restrictive (Mostly Dillon's Rule): Most counties in these states are under a strict Dillon's Rule doctrine, though there are a few, limited exceptions, often for counties of a certain population size. Some of these states impose strict limitations even on their few Home Rule counties.\n\nSomewhat Restrictive (Flexible Dillon's Rule): Counties in these states are under a flexible Dillon's Rule; although they are technically restricted to the authority and powers explicitly granted by the state, these powers are broadly construed to give additional authority for counties to manage their own affairs. Some of these counties have more flexibility than Home Rule counties in other states.\n\nSomewhat Flexible (Restrictive Home Rule): Counties in these states are given Home Rule authority, though the state limits this authority, granting them flexibility in only certain areas. Some of these counties are more restricted than counties in Dillon's Rule states.\n\nMixed/Flexible (Optional Home Rule): Counties in these states are under Dillon's Rule by default, but have the option to develop charters and become Home Rule counties, which grants them additional flexibility to determine their own affairs.\n\nMost Flexible (Home Rule): All counties in these states are granted broad powers to govern their own affairs under a flexible Home Rule doctrine, which permits counties any authority not explicitly restricted by the state.\n\nIn partnership with the Elizabeth Dole Foundation (EDF), NACo is supporting the Hidden Heroes Cities and Counties Program, which is a growing network of cities, counties, and states working to find local solutions to better serve military and veteran caregivers. Hidden Heroes is a multi-year, multi-faceted campaign that brings vital attention to the untold stories of veteran and military caregivers and seeks solutions for the tremendous challenges and long-term needs they face. Hidden Helpers Kids, Youth and Families initiative, which EDF recently launched, elevates the voices of military caregiver children and families to better understand the unique challenges they face and explores approaches for enhancing support services available to them.\n\nThe map displays the most up-to-date information available from the Census of State and Local Government Finances. This census is conducted every five years, in years ending in \"2\" and \"7,\" and covers all local governments. In between those years, a sample of state and local governments is used to collect data. The next census dataset, which will have 2022 data, is scheduled for release in 2024. For more information on the program, visit the U.S. Census page .\n\nU.S. Census Bureau's Population Estimates Program (PEP)\n\nThe population and housing unit estimates are released on a flow basis throughout each year. Each new series of data (called vintages) incorporates the latest administrative record data, geographic boundaries, and methodology. Therefore, the entire time series of estimates beginning with the most recent decennial census is revised annually and estimates from different vintages of data may not be consistent across geography and characteristics detail. When multiple vintages of data are available, the most recent vintage is the preferred data.\n\nThe vintage year (e.g., V2020) refers to the final year of the time series. The reference date for all estimates is July 1, unless otherwise specified.\n\nTo support state and local communication and outreach efforts, the U.S. Department of Health & Human Services, Office of the Assistant Secretary for Planning and Evaluation (ASPE) developed state, county, and sub-state level predictions of hesitancy rates using the most recently available federal survey data.\n\nFor more on how the estimates were calculated, please see this methodology document created by ASPE.\n\nData displayed within the map uses standard metrics across all United States counties. However, data might differ from data on state and local websites. This can be due to differences in how data were reported or how the metrics are calculated.\n\nExceptions:\n\nCalifornia does not report the county of residence for persons receiving a vaccine when the residentâ€™s county has a population of fewer than 20,000 people.\n\nHawaii does not provide CDC with county-of-residence information.\n\nTexas provides data that are aggregated at the state level and cannot be stratified by county.\n\nFor more information about the data shown here, please visit CDC: Reporting County-Level COVID-19 Vaccination Data\n\nThe Election Assistance Commission (EAC) has conducted the Election Administration and Voting Survey (EAVS) following each federal general election. The EAVS asks all 50 U.S. states, the District of Columbia, and U.S. territories to provide data about the ways in which Americans vote and how elections are administered.\n\n1 Most states report data on the level of the county (or county equivalent, such as parishes for Louisiana). Illinois, Missouri, and Virginia report data for \"independent\" cities in addition to counties. The territories, the District of Columbia, and Alaska each report as a single jurisdiction.\n\n2 We also excluded municipal jurisdictions within counties that reported data separate from the county. This was case with some cities in Illinois and Missouri that reported separately from the county.\n\n3 Connecticut, Maine, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, Rhode Island, Vermont, and Wisconsin report data on the level of individual townships. Thus, we excluded data for AK, ME, MA, NH, VT and WI. CT and RI are excluded as they do not have active county governments.\n\n4 By-mail voting includes all individuals who received a ballot from the election office prior to Election Day by mail (or via download from a web portal or by fax). It does not matter how the by-mail ballot was returned (via mail, dropped off at a polling place, or other designated method).\n\nThe National Incident Based Reporting System (NIBRS) is an incident-based reporting system for crimes known to the police. For each crime incident coming to the attention of law enforcement, a variety of data are collected about the incident. These data include the nature and types of specific offenses in the incident, characteristics of the victim(s) and offender(s), types and value of property stolen and recovered, and characteristics of persons arrested in connection with a crime incident.\n\nParticipation in the National Incident Based Reporting System (NIBRS) is voluntary. Not all law enforcement agencies in a state use the NIBRS system to report data to the FBI.\n\nThis analysis includes offenses associated with crime incidents that were reported by law enforcement agencies that participate in the National Incident Based Reporting System (NIBRS).\n\nCity law enforcement agencies report offenses that occur within their city boundaries in a county.\n\nCounty and state law enforcement agencies report offenses that take place in the county outside the limits of the city.\n\nAmerican Community Survey (ACS) Indicators in County Explorer\n\nThe estimates within this dataset are direct estimates from the 5-year American Community Survey. The ACS is an ongoing national survey of more than 3.5 million housing unit addresses annually. Data from monthly surveys are accumulated over 60 months and the estimates reflect the entire 5-year period not just a specific year. The estimates produced by ACS are not exact because they are based on a sample, not on all the housing units in the United States.\n\nThe coefficient of variation (CV) associated with an estimate can help identify the level of reliability of the estimate. The CV measures the variability associated with a survey estimate. It is calculated as the ratio of the standard error of an estimate to the estimate itself and is expressed as a percentage. Low CV values indicate more reliable estimates\n\nThe U.S. Census Bureau ACS Compass recommends using the ranges below for assessing the reliability of an estimate. However, the value of the cutoff points may vary depending on the availability of better quality data and the context of the analysis.\n\nHigh Reliability: Estimates with CVs less than or equals to 15 percent.\n\nMedium Reliability: Estimates with CVs between 15 percent and 30 percent.\n\nLow Reliability: Estimates with CVs over 30 percent.\n\nThe U.S. Census Bureau's Small Area Income and Poverty Estimates (SAIPE) Indicators In County Explorer\n\nThe estimates within this dataset are model estimates, not direct counts from enumerations or administrative records, nor direct estimates from sample surveys. U.S. Census Bureau models county income and poverty estimates by combining survey data with population estimates and administrative records. Beginning with the SAIPE program's estimates for 2005, data from the American Community Survey (ACS) are used in the estimation procedure.\n\nThe SAIPE estimates have a level of uncertainty associated with them resulting from the use of sample data and model estimation.\n\nThe coefficient of variation (CV) associated with an estimate can help identify the level of reliability of the estimate. The CV measures the variability associated with a survey estimate. It is calculated as the ratio of the standard error of an estimate to the estimate itself and is expressed as a percentage.

This survey is a nationally representative survey of county or city jail jurisdictions and regional jails in the country. N/A indicates the data are missing or not applicable. There are 407 counties that do not operate a county jail.\n\nData are from the Multiple Cause of Death Files, 1999-2017, as compiled from data provided by the 57 vital statistics jurisdictions through the Vital Statistics Cooperative Program.
