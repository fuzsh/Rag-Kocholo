        "text": "This is an updated list of the fastest-growing places in the United States.\n\nIn this report, we analyze what's happening in states like Florida, Texas, Arizona, and others, where growth figures are skyrocketing in cities and their surrounding metros.\n\nWe focus on those identified by the recent US Census and related sources as the top 20 fastest-growing US metro areas. Our purpose is to both rank cities by growth as well as identify the causes of this rapid growth and expansion.\n\nThe 20 Fastest-Growing US Metro Areas (2010-2024)\n\nA metropolitan statistical area (“metro”) is a county or the equivalent with at least one urbanized area with a population of 50,000 or more, plus adjacent territory with a high level of social and economic integration with the core. It's typically referred to as a metropolitan or \"metro\" area.\n\nIn the following US metro area descriptions and discussion, you will note that, in some cases, the metro is defined by a single large city and, in others by up to four (or more) distinct but geographically proximate cities. Furthermore, these cities are unique but also share regional identities.\n\nWhile reading through this section, consider the attributes of each area that have merged to define the area as a “fast-growing metro area”, as opposed to other metro areas throughout the country.\n\nOur data comes from the most recent US Census (2020), worldometers, worldclimate.com, bestplaces.net, and related sources unless otherwise noted.\n\nFor comparison here is national data for the US:\n\n2024 population estimate: 341,750,000\n\n2020 population: 331,449,281\n\n2010 population: 308,745,538\n\nPercentage growth: 7.35%\n\nSquare miles: 3,537,065.5\n\nPeople per square mile: 92.3\n\nAverage temp: 52.7 °F\n\nAverage yearly rainfall: 30.21 inches\n\nMedian age: 38.2 years\n\nMedian house value: $229,800\n\nMedian household income: $64,994\n\nPoverty: 12.8%\n\nAverage person per household: 2.6\n\nHousing units: 138,432,751\n\nHousing unit occupation: 88%\n\nOccupied housing unit ownership: 64%\n\nHere are the top 20 fastest-growing cities in the US:\n\nRank City or Clustered Cities Population (city) (2020) Current population estimate (city)** Population (metro) (2020) Current population estimate (metro)** Growth Rate (metro)* 1 Austin, Texas\n\n(Austin-Round Rock-Georgetown, TX Metro)\n\n961,885 974,447 (2022) 2,173,804 2,274,000 (2024) 25.84% 2 Raleigh, North Carolina\n\n(Raleigh-Durham-Cary, NC Metro)\n\n467,665 482,295 (2023) 2,106,463 2,368,947 (2023) 19.84% 3 Orlando, Florida\n\n(Orlando-Kissimmee-Sanford, FL Metro)\n\n307,573 316,081 (2022) 2,560,260 2,764,182 (2022) 19.69% 4 Charleston, South Carolina\n\n(Charleston-North Charleston, SC Metro)\n\n143,151 155,369 (2023) 790,955 830,529 (2022) 18.5% 5 Houston, Texas\n\n(Houston-The Woodlands-Sugar Land, TX Metro)\n\n2,304,580 2,314,157 (2023) 6,979,613 7,340,118 (2022) 17.36% 6 Sarasota-Bradenton, Florida\n\n(North Port-Sarasota-Bradenton, FL Metro)\n\n434,006 / 50,698 464,223 / 54,842 (2022) 821,613 891,411 (2022) 16.81% 7 San Antonio, Texas\n\n(San Antonio-New Braunfels, TX Metro)\n\n1,434,625 1,472,909 (2022) 2,510,211 2,665,342 (2022) 16.59% 8 Dallas-Fort Worth, Texas\n\n(Dallas-Fort Worth-Arlington, TX Metro)\n\n1,304,379 / 918,915 1,304,379 / 956,709 (2022) 7,451,858 8,100,037 (2023) 16.58% 9 Phoenix, Arizona\n\n(Phoenix-Mesa-Chandler, AZ Metro)\n\n1,608,139 1,644,000 (2022) 4,860,338 4,845,832 (2022) 15.61% 10 Nashville, Tennessee (Davidson County)\n\n(Nashville-Davidson-Murfreesboro-Franklin, TN Metro)\n\n715,884 715,884 (2022) 1,904,186 2,072,283 (2022) 15.35% 11 Charlotte, North Carolina\n\n(Charlotte-Concord-Gastonia, NC-SC Metro)\n\n874,579 897,720 (2022) 2,595,027 2,756,069 (2022) 15.33% 12 Denver, Colorado (Denver County)\n\n(Denver-Aurora-Lakewood, CO Metro)\n\n715,522 716,577 (2023) 2,928,437 2,985,871 (2022) 14.64% 13 Las Vegas, Nevada\n\n(Las Vegas-Henderson-Paradise, NV Metro)\n\n641,903 665,811 (2024) 2,228,866 2,322,985 (2022) 14.15% 14 Seattle-Tacoma, Washington\n\n(Seattle-Tacoma-Bellevue, WA Metro)\n\n737,015 / 219,346 749,256 / 221,776 (2022) 3,928,498 4,034,248 (2022) 13.89% 15 Jacksonville, Florida\n\n(Jacksonville, FL Metro)\n\n949,611 971,319 (2022) 1,533,796 1,605,848 (2022) 13.71% 16 Tampa-St. Petersburg-Clearwater, Florida\n\n(Tampa-St. Petersburg-Clearwater, FL Metro Area)\n\n384,959 / 258,308 / 117,292 398,173 / 261,256 / 117,027 (2022) 3,152,928 3,290,730 (2022) 13.07% 17 Atlanta, Georgia\n\n(Atlanta-Sandy Springs-Alpharetta, GA Metro)\n\n498,715 499,127 (2022) 5,947,008 6,222,908 (2022) 12.15% 18 Salt Lake City, Utah\n\n(Salt Lake City, UT Metro)\n\n199,723 204,657 (2022) 1,215,955 1,257,936 (2022) 11.4% 19 Oklahoma City, Oklahoma\n\n(Oklahoma City, OK Metro)\n\n681,054 694,800 (2022) 1,397,040 1,459,380 (2022) 11.07% 20 McAllen, Texas\n\n(McAllen-Edinburg-Mission, TX Metro)\n\n142,210 144,579 (2022) 861,137 888,367 (2022) 10.52%\n\n*The ranking order is from Census.gov\n\n**Latest estimate.\n\n1.

With over 51,000 students enrolled at the University of Texas at Austin (along with several smaller colleges) regularly brings new people and ideas to the region. These include everything from the frequency and broad array of musical performances to works by prominent researchers to cutting-edge computer technology.\n\nAustin metro area comprises cities and towns like Round Rock, Leander, Georgetown, Cedar Park, Pflugerville, Kyle, Hutto, Brushy Creek, Buda, Lakeway, Lockhart, Manor, Talor, Wells Branch, and several smaller municipalities. And throughout the area, you'll find well-known employers, with many in the tech industries (including startups). This is not to mention the national, state, county, and city governments that work in the city and region.\n\nThe city is also becoming a tech hub. LinkedIn data found that from May 2020 to April 2021, Austin gained 217 tech workers for every 10,000 existing ones. Moreover, according to Vyopta's Alfredo Ramirez, \"while Austin is not Silicon Valley, technology companies from that area like Apple, Google, Facebook, Tesla, and Oracle have established large workforces and office campuses in the Austin metropolitan area.\n\nAustin and its surrounding communities have numerous benefits outside the workplace to offer their residents, such as:\n\nYear-round warm weather (though it is scorching hot for about three months).\n\nOutstanding variety and quality of food.\n\nExtensive parkland, lakes, and rivers — with lots of outdoor recreation opportunities.\n\nLive music nearly anytime and anywhere.\n\nA sense of community.\n\n2. Raleigh, North Carolina\n\nCurrent population (city): 482,295 (2023)\n\nCurrent population (metro): 2,368,947 (2023)\n\n2020 population (city): 467,665\n\n2020 population (metro): ​​2,106,463\n\n2010 population (metro): 1,852,813\n\nPercentage growth: 13.69%\n\nSquare miles: 2,118.4\n\nPeople per square mile: 643.4\n\nAverage temp: 61.0 °F\n\nAverage yearly rainfall: 46.1 inches\n\nMedian age: 36.9 years\n\nMedian house value: $268,900\n\nMedian household income: $78,706\n\nPoverty: 9.2%\n\nAverage person per household: 2.6\n\nHousing units: 548,432\n\nHousing unit occupation: 93%\n\nOccupied housing unit ownership: 66%\n\nThe Raleigh-Durham area is home to nearly 1.5 million people and numerous higher education institutions, including:\n\nDuke University\n\nThe University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill\n\nNorth Carolina Central University\n\nMeredith College\n\nShaw University\n\nWilliam Peace University\n\nDurham Technical Community College\n\nHigh-end research facilities like Research Triangle Park.\n\nBut education is just one industry employing the area's residents. In addition, of course, there are supply, hospitality, healthcare, and other businesses affiliated with these campuses. Additional employers are Cisco Systems, Fidelity Investments, IBM, Microsoft, Dell Technologies, Apple, Accenture, Novo Nordisk, Deloitte, and other companies from various sizes and industries.\n\nHowever, people don't come to the Research Triangle just for these well-regarded employers or because it is a known tech hub. They come for great dining and entertainment, museums, parkland (like Umstead and Eno River State Parks), outdoor recreation, and more.\n\nBesides Raleigh and Durham, the Greater Triangle region comprises numerous smaller cities and towns like Cary, Chapel Hill, Apex, Wake Forest, Holly Springs, Garner, Morrisville, Clayton, Carrboro, and several other municipalities.\n\n3. Orlando, Florida\n\nCurrent population (city): 316,081 (2022)\n\nCurrent population (metro): 2,764,182 (2022)\n\n2020 population (city): 307,573\n\n2020 population (metro): 2,560,260\n\n2010 population (metro): 2,139,161\n\nPercentage growth: 19.69%\n\nSquare miles: 3,490.5\n\nPeople per square mile: 733.5\n\nAverage temp: 72.0 °F\n\nAverage yearly rainfall: 52 inches\n\nMedian age: 37.4 years\n\nMedian house value: $242,100\n\nMedian household income: $61,229\n\nPoverty: 12.8%\n\nAverage person per household: 2.8\n\nHousing units: 1,054,209\n\nHousing unit occupation: 85%\n\nOccupied housing unit ownership: 62%\n\nThe City of Orlando may have just over 305,000 residents, but its metro spreads across several other locations. The area comprises cities and towns like Kissimmee (69,615), St. Cloud (69,305), Sanford (61,051), and several other municipalities with populations above 10,000.\n\nOf course, Orlando is perhaps best known for Walt Disney World with its four internal theme parks: Magic Kingdom, Animal Kingdom, Hollywood Studios, and Epcot, plus the two water parks: Blizzard Beach and Typhoon Lagoon. And there are at least 13 more theme parks that aren't even affiliated with Disney.\n\nStill, Central Florida is also an excellent place to live and work. Sure, many area jobs are either theme park-related or serve them independently. But industries like healthcare, education, finance, real estate, airlines, and others are thriving. And let's not forget Florida's flourishing retirement industry, either.\n\n4. Charleston-North Charleston, South Carolina\n\nCurrent population (city): 155,369 (2023)\n\nCurrent population (metro): 830,529 (2022)\n\n2020 population (city): 143,151\n\n2020 population (metro): 790,955\n\n2010 population (metro): 667,450\n\nPercentage growth: 18.5%\n\nSquare miles: 2,590.2\n\nPeople per square mile: 305.4\n\nAverage temp: 62.4ºF\n\nAverage yearly rainfall: 48 inches\n\nMedian age: 37.4 years\n\nMedian house value: $249,800\n\nMedian household income: $65,894\n\nPoverty: 12.4%\n\nAverage person per household: 2.6\n\nHousing units: 339,240\n\nHousing unit occupation: 88%\n\nOccupied housing unit ownership: 67%\n\nCharleston is a smaller city with a smaller metro. Still, unlike some other cities, Charleston is among the oldest US settlements, dating to 1670. The fact that it's an established city is enhanced by being surrounded on three sides by water and island clusters.\n\nThe peninsula has little room for expansion and preserves its historical setting to perfection. The peninsula's adjacent bank, the islands, and North Charleston provide most supermarkets, big-box stores, and other amenities typically associated with suburbs. The Charleston metro consists of cities and towns like North Charleston, Mount Pleasant, Summerville, Goose Creek, Hanahan, Moncks Corner, and James Island.\n\nGreater Charleston is economically polarized, with the highest income brackets being either those under $15K or those between $75 to 150K — less in the middle-income ranges. Still, the city has seen the job market increase by 0.7% over the last year, and job growth over the next ten years is predicted at 35.9% (the US average is 33.5%). So Charleston residents are either well off or struggling.\n\nLow-income residents gravitate toward inland North Charleston, whereas those with money tend to locate near the ocean. Since 17% of Charleston area residents are over 65, many retire there due to the warm weather, generous tax exemptions, and a stellar location. Charleston has built an economy to accommodate seniors.\n\n5. Houston, Texas\n\nCurrent population (city): 2,314,157 (2023)\n\nCurrent population (metro): 7,340,118 (2022)\n\n2020 population (city): 2,304,580\n\n2020 population (metro): 6,979,613\n\n2010 population (metro): 5,947,236\n\nPercentage growth: 17.36%\n\nSquare miles: 8,268.7\n\nPeople per square mile: 844.1\n\nAverage temp: 69.6 °F\n\nAverage yearly rainfall: 48.9 inch\n\nMedian age: 34.5 years\n\nMedian house value: $208,100\n\nMedian household income: $69,328\n\nPoverty: 13.5%\n\nAverage person per household: 2.9\n\nHousing units: 2,646,682\n\nHousing unit occupation: 91%\n\nOccupied housing unit ownership: 61%\n\nHouston is a massive metro comprising not just cities and towns but nine counties: Austin, Brazoria, Chambers, Fort Bend, Galveston, Harris, Liberty, Montgomery, and Waller. Larger cities surrounding Houston include The Woodlands, Sugar Land, Pearland, League City, Pasadena, Galveston, Conrow, and Baytown. Five of these cities have a population of over 100,000, and all exceed 50,000. Of course, there are many smaller places in Greater Houston too.\n\nA job market that's quickly recovering from the pandemic, plus a low cost of living and pleasant weather much of the year, makes Houston an excellent choice for those embarking on careers or raising families. Of course, Houston's extreme summer heat, high humidity, occasional hurricanes, and long commuting times can be drawbacks, but there's still a lot to see and do here.\n\nAs with many other US cities, the top employer in Houston is Walmart. Others near the top include hospitals and healthcare facilities, supermarket chains, etc. In addition, United Airlines has its headquarters in Houston, and, of course, oil businesses and refineries are prominent.\n\nHouston also boasts over 40 colleges and universities, including the University of Houston, Rice University, and the University of St. Thomas. In addition, suburban Galveston is home to the University of Texas medical branch.\n\n6. Sarasota-Bradenton, Florida\n\nCurrent population (city): 464,223 / 54,842 (2022)\n\nCurrent population (metro): 891,411 (2022)\n\n2020 population (city): 434,006 / 50,698\n\n2020 population (metro): 821,613\n\n2010 population (metro): 703,354\n\nPercentage growth: 16.81%\n\nSquare miles: 1,298.8\n\nPeople per square mile: 632.6\n\nAverage temp: 72.05 °F\n\nAverage yearly rainfall: 56 inches\n\nMedian age: 52.9 years\n\nMedian house value: $261,100\n\nMedian household income: $62,438\n\nPoverty: 9.8%\n\nAverage person per household: 2.4\n\nHousing units: 439,870\n\nHousing unit occupation: 77%\n\nOccupied housing unit ownership: 75%\n\nThis dispersed metro lies south of Tampa Bay and is surrounded by long, narrow barrier islands extending from north to south. The cities of Sarasota and Bradenton both have populations of roughly 60,000, but the metro comprises many other communities along the coast, sometimes inland (much of the interior is swampland). The metro includes four counties: Sarasota, Manatee, Charlotte, and DeSoto.\n\nThe Sarasota-Bradenton metro includes cities and towns like North Port, the largest after the two anchor cities, at close to 75,000 residents, and Venice at just over 25,000. Palmetto, Longboat Key, Holmes Beach, Anna Maria, and Bradenton Beach. And a significant portion of the metro comprises 39 census-designated places — ranging from Port Charlotte at around 60,000 to tiny Gardner, with only a few hundred.\n\nLike much of Florida, the Sarasota-Bradenton metro has a thriving tourism industry, and parkland and ocean beaches abound in these counties. The area also boasts several colleges and universities, healthcare, manufacturing, and service industries of various kinds, including recreation. As a result, greater Sarasota saw the job market grow by 2.6% in 2021, and job growth over the next 10 years is forecast at 44.6% (well above the US average of 33.5%).\n\n7. San Antonio, Texas\n\nCurrent population (city): 1,472,909 (2022)\n\nCurrent population (metro): 2,665,342 (2022)\n\n2020 population (city): 1,434,625\n\n2020 population (metro): 2,510,211\n\n2010 population (metro): 2,153,009\n\nPercentage growth: 16.59%\n\nSquare miles: 7,313.2\n\nPeople per square mile: 343.2\n\nAverage temp: 69.8 °F\n\nAverage yearly rainfall: 34.9 inches\n\nMedian age: 34.9 years\n\nMedian house value: $183,000\n\nMedian household income: $61,437\n\nPoverty: 14.2%\n\nAverage person per household: 3\n\nHousing units: 903,779\n\nHousing unit occupation: 91%\n\nOccupied housing unit ownership: 63%\n\nSan Antonio has been a military city from as early as 1718 when the first Spanish soldiers founded the San Antonio de Bexar Presidio. Over a century later, the Alamo, a prominent monument today, played a crucial role in Texas's battle for independence from Mexico in 1836.\n\nToday, San Antonio is home to one of the largest military base concentrations in the country, including the Department of Defense's largest medical center at Joint Base San Antonio Fort Sam Houston.\n\nSo it's no surprise that the US military employs a sizable portion of San Antonio's population in various capacities and for different branches. Civilians living in the metro pursue such occupations as tourism, healthcare, manufacturing, and services—many working for the various military bases and other facilities.\n\nThe San Antonio metro comprises cities and towns like New Braunfels, Canyon Lake, Cibolo, Converse, Seguin, Scherz, Hondo, and Timberwood Park. Counties in the San Antonio metro area: Atascosa, Bandera, Bexar, Comal, Guadalupe, Kendall, Medina, and Wilson.\n\nOverall, metro San Antonio is an affordable place to live, with housing and other costs much lower than other prominent Texas cities and their metros. It’s also sunny and year-round (though hot in summer), and many people congregate along the scenic Riverwalk for dining and nightlife.\n\n8. Dallas-Fort Worth, Texas\n\nCurrent population (city): 1,304,379 / 956,709 (2022)\n\nCurrent population (metro): 8,100,037 (2023)\n\n2020 population (city): 1,304,379 / 918,915\n\n2020 population (metro): 7,451,858\n\n2010 population (metro): 6,392,065\n\nPercentage growth: 16.58%\n\nSquare miles: 8,675.1\n\nPeople per square mile: 859\n\nAverage temp: 66.8 °F\n\nAverage yearly rainfall: 40.7 inches\n\nMedian age: 35 years\n\nMedian house value: $236,200\n\nMedian household income: $72,882\n\nPoverty: 11.1%\n\nAverage person per household: 2.8\n\nHousing units: 2,821,032\n\nHousing unit occupation: 93%\n\nOccupied housing unit ownership: 60%\n\nDallas-Fort Worth, also known as \"DFW\" or \"the Metroplex,\" has grown several secondary cities, cities, towns, and other municipalities over the years. As the ninth-largest city in the US, with approximately 1.4 million residents, Dallas is a hub for business, fine dining, spectator sports, and high-end shopping. Plus, it has a thriving arts scene.\n\nThe other half of the pair, Fort Worth, has a less cosmopolitan and more traditional Texan lifestyle. This city of nearly a million is home to the country’s oldest stock show and rodeo, the Southwestern Exposition and Livestock Show, and puts on the only twice-daily cattle drive anywhere.\n\nThe Metroplex comprises 11 counties. And the secondary cities of Arlington, Plano, Garland, Irving, and Frisco each number at least 200,000. The next smaller tier of Metroplex cities includes McKinney, Grand Prairie, Denton, Mesquite, Carrollton, Richardson, Lewisville, and Allen — all over 100,000. Hundreds more places fall somewhere below 100,000.\n\nDFW is home to American Airlines, Alcon, BNSF Railway, Lockheed Martin Aeronautics, Bank of America, JP Morgan Chase & Co., Southwest Airlines, and Raytheon. These names alone are enough to draw a considerable variety of newcomers seeking employment.\n\n9. Phoenix, Arizona\n\nCurrent population (city): 1,644,000 (2022)\n\nCurrent population (metro): 4,845,832 (2022)\n\n2020 population (city): 1,608,139\n\n2020 population (metro): 4,860,338\n\n2010 population (metro): 4,204,204\n\nPercentage growth: 15.61%\n\nSquare miles: 14,567.8\n\nPeople per square mile: 333.6\n\nAverage temp: 71.5 °F\n\nAverage yearly rainfall: 9 inches\n\nMedian age: 36.9 years\n\nMedian house value: $269,300\n\nMedian household income: $67,068\n\nPoverty: 12.7%\n\nAverage person per household: 2.7\n\nHousing units: 1,943,813\n\nHousing unit occupation: 90%\n\nOccupied housing unit ownership: 64%\n\nThe Phoenix-Mesa-Chandler, AZ metro (also called \"Valley of the Sun\" or \"Salt River Valley\") is the largest metropolitan statistical area by population in the US Southwest. While Phoenix is the anchor city, the metro includes a large swath of Central Arizona. The 2020 Census puts at an overall population of 4,860,338 — making it the tenth most populous in the US and bumping Boston out of the top 10 altogether.\n\nWith the City of Phoenix quickly passing 1.7 million people and 21 other cities and towns ranging from 10.000 to over 250,000 residents, you can see where Greater Phoenix's population comes from. Suburbs, exurbs, and secondary cities like Mesa (over 500,000), Chandler, and Gilbert (both approaching 300,000), plus Glendale, Scottsdale, Tempe, and Peoria (all between 150,000 and 300,000) play significant roles in tipping the scales.\n\nGreater Phoenix's warm winters make the region ideal for \"snowbird\" retirees, so the expansive healthcare systems are further fueled by the presence of retirement communities and related services and facilities. Besides healthcare, the Phoenix metro has its share of retail, hospitality and tourism, administrative support, education, finance, and other industries. The area has limited agriculture, however.\n\n10. Nashville, Tennessee\n\nCurrent population (city): 715,884 (2022)\n\nCurrent population (metro): 2,072,283 (2022)\n\n2020 population (city): 715,884\n\n2020 population (metro): 1,904,186\n\n2010 population (metro): 1,650,831\n\nPercentage growth: 15.35%\n\nSquare miles: 5,689.4\n\nPeople per square mile: 334.7\n\nAverage temp: 58 °F\n\nAverage yearly rainfall: 49 inches\n\nMedian age: 36.5 years\n\nMedian house value: $262,900\n\nMedian household income: $68,406\n\nPoverty: 11%\n\nAverage person per household: 2.6\n\nHousing units: 788,546\n\nHousing unit occupation: 92%\n\nOccupied housing unit ownership: 66%\n\nPushing 900,000 residents, Nashville is a medium-sized city. However, it has an extensive metro that roughly doubles that figure. Murfreesboro (pop. 152,769) and Franklin (pop. 83,454) come in next in population for the Nashville metro, and Hendersonville, Smyrna, and Spring Hill all exceed 50,000. A few dozen smaller locales round out the metro's population of nearly 2 million.\n\nWho doesn't know that Nashville is the destination for country music? So, of course, tourism is one of the city's hallmarks. But do you know that other industries in the Nashville metro include several comprehensive healthcare providers? It's also home to Vanderbilt and Austin Peay universities. And, besides these attributes, businesses headquartered in and around Nashville are:\n\nAsurion (technology insurer)\n\nBridgestone Americas Inc.\n\nCracker Barrel Old Country Store Inc.\n\nThe ICEE Company (makers of frozen carbonated drinks)\n\niHeartMedia.\n\nMitsubishi Motors\n\nNissan North America\n\nTractor Supply\n\nAccording to a recent US News & World Report survey, Nashville's metro “has a blossoming job market and an exploding entertainment scene fueling an appetite (and thirst) for all things locally sourced and artisanal in craft — everything from handmade marshmallows to small-batch gin.\" People come to Greater Nashville for its fun and novelty, and some stay for the region’s jobs.\n\n11. Charlotte, North Carolina\n\nCurrent population (city): 897,720 (2022)\n\nCurrent population (metro): 2,756,069 (2022)\n\n2020 population (city): 874,579\n\n2020 population (metro): 2,595,027\n\n2010 population (metro): 2,250,121\n\nPercentage growth: 15.33%\n\nSquare miles: 5,597.4\n\nPeople per square mile: 463.6\n\nAverage temp: 59.8 °F\n\nAverage yearly rainfall: 43 inches\n\nMedian age: 37.6 years\n\nMedian house value: $216,700\n\nMedian household income: $65,725\n\nPoverty: 11.1%\n\nAverage person per household: 2.6\n\nHousing units: 1,062,398\n\nHousing unit occupation: 92%\n\nOccupied housing unit ownership: 66%\n\nCharlotte, a city approaching a million residents, sits in the Piedmont region of North Carolina, with a metro area, aka “Metrolina” of roughly 2.5 million that extends into neighboring South Carolina. Charlotte houses the corporate headquarters of Bank of America, Truist Financial, and the east coast headquarters of Wells Fargo. Since the Civil War, these and other financial institutions have made it the second-largest city for banking in the US (after NYC).\n\nGreater Charlotte is also known for healthcare, logistics and distribution, and advanced manufacturing. Moreover, Charlotte Douglas International Airport is a hub for American Airlines. The City of Charlotte is home to nine colleges, and there are 30 others within a 50-mile radius. These include UNC at Charlotte, Queens University of Charlotte, Johnson C. Smith University, Central Piedmont Community College, and others. Greater Charlotte is also known for its professional sports, and residents can enjoy outdoor recreation throughout the year.\n\nThe Charlotte metro comprises cities and towns like Concord (the largest outside Charlotte at 105,240) to the northeast, Gastonia (80,411) to the west, Rock Hill (74,372) to the southeast, Huntersville (61,376) north of the city, and Mooresville (50,193) farther north. These cities' populations all exceed 50,000. Additionally, the area has several dozen less-populated municipalities.\n\n12. Denver, Colorado\n\nCurrent population (city): 716,577 (2023)\n\nCurrent population (metro): 2,985,871 (2022)\n\n2020 population (city): 715,522\n\n2020 population (metro): 2,928,437\n\n2010 population (metro): 2,554,523\n\nPercentage growth: 14.64%\n\nSquare miles: 8,344.7\n\nPeople per square mile: 350.9\n\nAverage temp: 50.7 °F\n\nAverage yearly rainfall: 17 inches\n\nMedian age: 36.7 years\n\nMedian house value: $411,800\n\nMedian household income: $83,289\n\nPoverty: 8.3%\n\nAverage person per household: 2.6\n\nHousing units: 1,156,748\n\nHousing unit occupation: 95%\n\nOccupied housing unit ownership: 65%\n\nMetro Denver is clearly defined, encompassing parts of 10 counties, virtually all adjacent to Interstates 25 (north-south) and/or 70 (east-west). To the east are the sparsely-populated Eastern Plains and to the west are the Rocky Mountains.\n\nSix secondary cities in the Denver metro, each with populations over 100,000, include:\n\nArvada (124,402)\n\nAurora (386,261)\n\nCentennial (108,418)\n\nLakewood (155,984)\n\nThornton (141,867)\n\nWestminster (116,317)\n\nThe larger cities of Boulder, Longmont, and Loveland are west of Denver, within an hour’s commuting distance.\n\nThere are 21 more cities and towns between 10,000 and 100,000 in Greater Denver, including Littleton, Golden, Castle Rock, Castle Pines, Brighton, Englewood, Northglenn, and several smaller places. In addition, many towns and villages have populations under 10,000.\n\nThe \"corridor\" forming the Denver metro is well-populated and heavily developed. It covers a variety of industries, including everything from food and beverages (check out the microbreweries) to aviation and aerospace to software to healthcare and wellness. As a result, Denver is a popular place for tech entrepreneurs to set up shop.\n\nOverall, the Denver metro is an inspiring place. Besides the above, it’s known for individual sports like skiing and professional competitive sports. Unfortunately, though, Greater Denver is lower than should be expected in public green spaces.\n\n13. Las Vegas-Henderson-Paradise, Nevada\n\nCurrent population (city): 665,811 (2024)\n\nCurrent population (metro): 2,322,985 (2022)\n\n2020 population (city): 641,903\n\n2020 population (metro): 2,228,866\n\n2010 population (metro): 1,952,587\n\nPercentage growth: 14.15%\n\nSquare miles: 7,891.7\n\nPeople per square mile: 282.4\n\nAverage temp: 68.5 °F\n\nAverage yearly rainfall: 6.2 inches\n\nMedian age: 37.5 years\n\nMedian house value: $285,100\n\nMedian household income: $61,048\n\nPoverty: 13.4%\n\nAverage person per household: 2.7\n\nHousing units: 912,465\n\nHousing unit occupation: 89%\n\nOccupied housing unit ownership: 55%\n\nThe Las Vegas Valley comprises a metropolitan area covering a fraction of Clark County (the size of New Jersey). “The Valley” includes the cities of Las Vegas, North Las Vegas, and Henderson, and the unincorporated towns of Summerlin South, Paradise, Spring Valley, Sunrise Manor, Enterprise, Winchester, and Whitney. Nellis Air Force Base sits on the northeastern edge of the metro.\n\nSignificant urbanization has led to a Las Vegas metro population of close to two million. Still, sadly, this rapid growth has brought about the conversion of desert land into industrial and commercial areas — including extensive housing plots. For example, the 106.6mi² suburb of Henderson has reached a population of 341,531 with a 3.23% growth rate.\n\nThe tourism industry is the primary driver pushing the metro Las Vegas economy into the future. With some 150,000 hotel rooms, the industry continues to expand by demolishing older (often cheaply made) buildings and new land acquisitions. Moreover, where casinos and big-name shows once were the area's main attractions, more recently, shopping, conventions, fine dining, and outdoor beauty have joined the competition for tourist dollars.\n\nIncreasing numbers of retirees are moving to Las Vegas seeking opportunities from housing to health care to gambling. Today, the 2004 cost of the living spike has diminished since the general absence of business, and income taxes keep Nevada attractive for companies relocating or expanding their operations.\n\n14. Seattle-Tacoma, Washington\n\nCurrent population (city): 749,256 / 221,776 (2022)\n\nCurrent population (metro): 4,034,248 (2022)\n\n2020 population (city): 737,015 / 219,346\n\n2020 population (metro): 3,928,498\n\n2010 population (metro): 3,449,241\n\nPercentage growth: 13.89%\n\nSquare miles: 5,869.7\n\nPeople per square mile: 669.3\n\nAverage temp: 52.7 °F\n\nAverage yearly rainfall: 38 inches\n\nMedian age: 37 years\n\nMedian house value: $471,900\n\nMedian household income: $90,790\n\nPoverty: 8.4%\n\nAverage person per household: 2.5\n\nHousing units: 1,617,780\n\nHousing unit occupation: 95%\n\nOccupied housing unit ownership: 60%\n\nThe King County (“Sea-Tac”) metro is one of just a few regions in this list located outside the South or Southwest US But it holds bragging rights for several amenities as tempting as those in the Sunbelt states:\n\nA gorgeous natural environment: Like other urban areas considered here, the Sea-Tac metro has bays, inlets, and islands peppering the area. It’s also adjacent to Olympia National Park and Canada’s Vancouver Island.\n\nLike other metros discussed here (Austin, Raleigh-Durham, Houston, Phoenix, Dallas-Fort Worth, and Tampa), it's considered highly tech-savvy on the whole.\n\nSome of the best-known brands in the US are headquartered here, including Alaska Airlines, Amazon, Microsoft, Costco, Nordstrom, REI, and Starbucks. The more of a techie entrepreneur you are, the better the fit you’ll be for Greater Seattle-Tacoma.\n\nThe climate is temperate year-round, hardly ever above the mid-seventies, but the area does get a lot of rain.\n\nBesides the anchor cities of Seattle and Tacoma, municipalities in King County include the larger Bellevue (151,854), Kent (136,588), and Everett (103,019). There are a few dozen smaller communities as well.\n\n15. Jacksonville, Florida\n\nCurrent population (city): 971,319 (2022)\n\nCurrent population (metro): 1,605,848 (2022)\n\n2020 population (city): 949,611\n\n2020 population (metro): 1,533,796\n\n2010 population (metro): 1,348,907\n\nPercentage growth: 13.71%\n\nSquare miles: 3,201.8\n\nPeople per square mile: 479\n\nAverage temp: 67.9 °F\n\nAverage yearly rainfall: 50 inches\n\nMedian age: 38.6 years\n\nMedian house value: $220,000\n\nMedian household income: $63,064\n\nPoverty: 12.3%\n\nAverage person per household: 2.6\n\nHousing units: 578,620\n\nHousing units occupation: 88%\n\nOccupied housing unit ownership: 65%\n\nThe City of Jacksonville, Florida, and its five-county metro are booming. At 246,000 in 1950, this region, which crosses from Northeast Florida into Southeast Georgia, now has over 1.5 million residents. The anchor city itself numbered 949,611 residents as of 2020.\n\nSitting on the Atlantic coast, Greater Jacksonville enjoys the natural environment that is made up of sand beaches, bays and inlets, and the wide, meandering St. John’s River. Like most of the state, recreational opportunities are abundant in the expansive Jacksonville metro. But, as the data shows, it’s also a business hub worth consideration for firms wanting to relocate.\n\nIndustries in and around Jacksonville include everything from food to transportation and construction to manufacturing and more. The area is also home to higher education institutions like the University of North Florida and Florida State College at Jackson. As such, we expect to see Jacksonville continue its growth pattern over the coming years.\n\nUp-and-Comers: Five More Fast-Growing Metros to Watch\n\nAlong with the cities just discussed, we’ve set our sights on the following five metros, all of which hold strong potential for continued growth over the coming decade.\n\n16.

The growth rate is a percentage showing the difference between population differences from year to year, decade to decade, and so on.\n\nIf a large and growing suburb or exurb expands or even competes with its anchor city, it might be considered a \"secondary city\" within the given metro. And if that city happens to sit directly between two or more established anchor cities, it might play a role in merging their metros. The proximity of growing cities, like those in North Carolina’s Research Triangle led to a ready-made metro.\n\nA rapidly growing secondary city crossing two metros could have a related effect. For example, San Marcos, Texas, sits midway between two anchor cities, Austin and San Antonio (only 80-90 miles apart), surrounded by smaller communities. San Marcos has a population of 66,952 and a healthy annual 1.65% growth rate.\n\nSuburbs, Exurbs, and Regions\n\nSeveral studies have been done on the city-metro phenomenon. For example, in Blue Metros, Red States: The Shifting Urban-Rural Divide in America's Swing States (Brookings Institution Press, 2020), Damore, Lang, and Danielsen conclude that:\n\nAfter centuries as a Southern state, Virginia has been politically remade by decades of migration to and growth in the Washington, DC., suburbs. The new residents added considerable wealth, skills, and energy to Old Dominion, but in the process transformed Northern Virginia into an extension of the urbanized Northeast (103).\n\nIn fact, this is happening regionally across the entire country. While the various states and regions naturally have their inherited tastes and values, as cities form ever-larger metros, a sort of generic urbanized mindset could be affecting their metros. Generational shifts also appear to be a factor.\n\nA 2020 article, \"Tracking Urbanization and Exurbs: Migration Across the Rural-Urban Continuum, 1990–2016\", examines and analyzes speculation as to why the urban South and overall Sunbelt have grown so dramatically over the last century. The study diminishes some of the prevailing notions about migration to these regions.\n\nTake-aways on Growing Cities and Metros\n\nSome questions are foregrounded by the data and discussion shared in this piece. For instance, “Why the South and Southwest US and not other parts of the country?”. We can speculate that the following have contributed:\n\nAs centuries-long immigrant destinations, northeastern, midwestern, and some west-coast cities were among the earliest to develop, mature, and stabilize. However, the East Coast's southern cities experienced delayed expansion by needing to rebuild following the Civil War.\n\nThe climate throughout much of the South and Southwest might be amenable to businesses and those working for them. Air conditioning can handle hot summers, but harsh winters can delay or halt productivity.\n\nSunbelt states also draw retirees—whether permanent residents or simply overwintering before summer’s scorching heat returns.\n\nPolitics and policies, especially in “red” Sunbelt states, lean toward lower taxes and generous business incentives.\n\nMost Sunbelt states, especially in the Southwest, have room to grow. For example, while the Boston metro consumes at least half of tiny Massachusetts (and part of New Hampshire), the 14,599mi² Phoenix metro, larger than all of Massachusetts (only 10,565 mi²), has plenty of undeveloped land.\n\nOf course, these points are hardly exhaustive explanations for the South-Southwest’s migration and expansion boom. But who knows precisely what will happen with the growth of cities and metros in the coming decade and beyond? We can only guess. But here, we have provided some concrete information as to which cities are seeing the fastest rates of growth."
