        "text": "Population density is the number of people living within a certain area. In the United States, this is often represented by the number of people living per square mile. However, most countries use the metric system and quantify population density according to people living per square kilometer. Population density looks at, on average, how many people live in a certain geographic area. Population density is often used to refer exclusively to human society, but is also used to tell how populous a certain species is in an area. More sparsely populated areas, such as farmland, have fewer people living in a single square kilometer than more densely populated areas, such as cities. Cities, with their apartment complexes and many residential areas, have a high concentration of people living in a smaller area, making them more densely populated. Rural farmlands, where households are separated by large, open fields, have a lower concentration of people living in the area, making them more sparsely populated. Globally, the most densely populated countries are small, island nations with high populations living on a relatively small landmass.\n\nHuman beings tend to settle around specific points, whether they be a major city or a coastline. The further from those points, the more sparsely populated the area will be. Humans are not equally spaced throughout the world but instead form population clusters. While many millions of people can live in a single city, very few will live in inhospitable climates or war-torn regions. Human populations will cluster in some areas, and not in others.\n\nAccording to the World Bank, as of 2020, the top three least densely populated countries on Earth are Greenland, Mongolia, and Namibia. These countries have the fewest people living per square kilometer of land than any other place on Earth.\n\nIn Greenland, the population density per square mile is a meager 0.14. Greenland, a country more than three times the size of the US state of Texas, only has a population of about 56,000 people. For reference, the least populous state in the US, Wyoming, has a population of 580,000, about ten times the population of Greenland.\n\nMongolia has the second-lowest population density of any country on Earth. Mongolia only has 2.1 people living per square kilometer, on average. With a population of about 3.4 million, and a land mass of 1,553,560 square kilometers, Mongolia has roughly the same population as Berlin, Germany.\n\nNamibia is the third runner-up in the least densely populated countries on Earth. The population stands at around 2.6 million, with a landmass of 823,290 square kilometers. As one of the driest countries in sub-Saharan Africa, Namibia's landmass is only 5% arable land. This, with other factors, means that the population density of just 3.09 people per square kilometer is understandable.\n\nBy this point, the pattern is becoming clear: places with a great deal of land and a small population have very low population densities. Therefore, the inverse must be true, that smaller countries with very high populations have the highest population densities. These are the three most densely populated countries on Earth:\n\nThe place on Earth with the highest population density as of 2020 is the Macao Special Administrative Region. An autonomous region of China, Macao is just 30 square kilometers, but has a population of 670,000, making its population density a whopping 19,737 people living per square kilometer. Rather than the countries with the highest overall population, the highest population density occurs where people are most highly concentrated.\n\nThe second-most densely populated country is Monaco. In just 1.98 square kilometers, Monaco boasts a population of almost 40,000. This means its population density is 19,391. Sandwiched between the borders of France and Italy, Monaco is classified as a \"microstate.\"\n\nSingapore is the third most densely populated country, fitting 5.95 million people into just 700 square kilometers. This means Singapore has a population density of 7,919. Singapore's population density is roughly the same as the city of Tokyo, which is three times the size.\n\nPopulation Density\n\nOne of my husband's closest friends has been living in China for the past decade. Whenever he travels home to our rather rural area, he always remarks how shocked he is to remember how few people live here. This is a stark difference to his home in China, where the city streets are teeming with people. This contrast is an excellent example of the differences in population density found throughout the globe. Today's lesson will cover this topic as we discuss the concept of population density.\n\nTo begin, population density is a measurement of the number of people in an area, relative to the size of the area. When speaking of population density, it's important to note that it's not an exact number. Instead, it's much more of an estimate or average. This is simply due to constant fluctuations caused by births and deaths.\n\nWhen speaking of population density, the terms 'sparse' and 'dense' are often used. If an area is sparsely populated this simply means that it contains few people relative to its size. Conversely, if an area is densely populated this means it contains a large amount of people relative to its size.\n\nFactors Affecting Density\n\nAccording to geographers, areas that are sparsely populated are usually very difficult places to live. For instance, they may have difficult climates, such as the Mojave Desert or the tundra of the North Pole. They also may have very high elevations, as in the mountainous regions of the Urals or the highlands of Tibet. On the contrary, areas with more temperate climates and lower elevations tend to be more densely populated. A good example of this is the densely populated areas of the Northeastern US.\n\nPopulation density is also affected by more human factors. For instance, if an area is politically unstable or war-torn, it will usually have a very low population density. This is seen in areas like Syria and Afghanistan. Another human factor that affects population density is the availability of employment. For instance, industrial cities like Beijing, China, or Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, offer job opportunities. For this reason, these areas are more densely populated.\n\nNow that we've covered the definitions of population density, let's move onto specific areas of the world. As we do this, please remember that population density doesn't just mean the number of people in an area. It is a measurement of the number of people in an area relative to the size of the area. For example, the state of New Jersey is the most densely populated state in the U.S. Yes, its actual population is lower than that of New York, but its people are crowded into a much smaller space."
