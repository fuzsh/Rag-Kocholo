        "text": "The American Diabetes Association’s 2017 standards for tailoring treatment to reduce disparities of medical care for diabetes included recognizing that food insecurity is a factor that complicates diabetes management.\n\nA suggested approach for providers of diabetic patients is to help patients and parents of patients with diabetes to more regularly obtain nutritious food. The National Diabetes Education program reported that food insecure adults are less likely to eat vegetables and less likely to replace a high fat diet. Another finding stated that food insecurity has been associated with 24% and a 142% higher average consumption of fast foods and soda. Food insecurity is also linked to a higher likelihood of being obese and related to a higher BMI among patients.\n\nThe connection between diabetes and heart disease starts with high blood sugar levels. In adults with diabetes, the most common causes of death are cardiovascular diseases, such as heart disease (for both men and women) and stroke.\n\nSome other risk factors related to food insecurity and diabetes include: income, employment, lifestyle factors and stress."
