        "text": "County in Texas, U.S.\n\nFor the county in northeast Texas, see Harrison County, Texas.\n\nCounty in Texas\n\nHarris County is a county located in the U.S. state of Texas; as of the 2020 census, the population was 4,731,145,[1] making it the most populous county in Texas and the third-most populous county in the United States. Its county seat is Houston, the most populous city in Texas and fourth-most populous city in the United States. The county was founded in 1836 and organized in 1837.[2][3] It is named for John Richardson Harris, who founded the town of Harrisburg on Buffalo Bayou in 1826.[2] According to the July 2023 census estimate, Harris County's population has shifted to 4,835,125 comprising over 16% of Texas's population. Harris County is included in the nine-county Houston–The Woodlands–Sugar Land metropolitan statistical area, which is the fifth-most populous metropolitan area in the United States.\n\nHistory\n\n[edit]\n\nHuman remains date habitation to about 4000 BC. Other evidence of humans in the area dates from about 1400 BC, 1 AD, and later in the first millennium. The region became uninhabited from 1 AD to European contact. Little European activity predates 1821. Álvar Núñez Cabeza de Vaca may have visited the area in 1529. French traders recorded passing through in the 18th century. Spaniards attempted to establish a fort in the area around the same time, but did not persist for long.[2]\n\nThe first recorded European settlers in Harris County arrived in 1822. Their schooner sailed into Galveston Bay and ran aground on the Red Fish Bar. Some of those passengers traveled further up the bay system, but it is not known whether they settled up Buffalo Bayou or the San Jacinto River. One of these passengers, a Mr. Ryder, settled at what is now known as Morgan's Point, Texas. Also in 1822, John Iiams settled his family at Cedar Point after sailing from Berwick's Bay, Louisiana. Dr. Johnson Hunter arrived just after Iiams. He also wrecked his boat near Galveston. He settled at Morgan's Point and was a grantee of land there. Nathaniel Lynch settled in the area and operated a ferry.[4]\n\nIn 1824, the land empresario, Stephen F. Austin convened at the house of William Scott for the purpose of conveying titles for Mexican headrights. He was joined by the land commissioner, Baron von Bastrop, and Austin's secretary, Samuel May Williams. About thirty families gained legal titles to land in what would later be known as Harris County. A few immigrants settled on Buffalo Bayou in these early years, including Moses Callahan, Ezekial Thomas, and the Vince brothers.[4]\n\nNicolas Clopper arrived in the Galveston Bay area from Ohio in the 1820s. He attempted to develop Buffalo Bayou as a trading conduit for the Brazos River valley. He acquired land at Morgan's Point in 1826.[5] John Richardson Harris (1790–1829), for whom the county was later named, arrived in 1824. Harris had moved his family to Sainte Genevieve, Missouri Territory, where they had been residing until the early 1820s.[6]\n\nHarris was granted a league of land (about 4,428 acres) at Buffalo Bayou. He platted the town of Harrisburg in 1826, while he established a trading post and a grist mill there. He ran boats transporting goods between New Orleans and Harrisburg until his death in the fall of 1829.[7]\n\nThe First Congress of the Republic of Texas established Harrisburg County on December 22, 1836. The original county boundaries included Galveston Island, but were redrawn to its current configuration in May 1838.[2]\n\nThe area has had a number of severe weather events, such as the following hurricanes and tropical storms:\n\nGeography\n\n[edit]\n\nAccording to the United States Census Bureau, the county has a total area of 1,777 square miles (4,600 km2), of which 1,703 square miles (4,410 km2) is land and 74 square miles (190 km2) (4.2%) is covered by water.[8] Both its total area and land area are larger than the U.S. state of Rhode Island.\n\nAdjacent counties\n\n[edit]\n\nMontgomery (north)\n\nLiberty (northeast)\n\nChambers (east)\n\nGalveston (southeast)\n\nBrazoria (south)\n\nFort Bend (southwest)\n\nWaller (northwest)\n\nCommunities\n\n[edit]\n\nCities\n\n[edit]\n\nMultiple counties\n\n[edit]\n\nBaytown (partly in Chambers County)\n\nFriendswood (mostly in Galveston County)\n\nHouston (county seat and largest municipality) (small parts in Fort Bend and Montgomery counties)\n\nKaty (partly in Fort Bend, Harris, and Waller counties)\n\nLeague City (mostly in Galveston County)\n\nMissouri City (mostly in Fort Bend County)\n\nPearland (mostly in Brazoria County and a small part in Fort Bend County)\n\nSeabrook (some water surface in Chambers County)\n\nStafford (mostly in Fort Bend County)\n\nWaller (partly in Waller County)\n\nHarris County only\n\n[edit]\n\nUnincorporated areas\n\n[edit]\n\nCensus-designated places\n\n[edit]\n\nUnincorporated communities\n\n[edit]\n\nDemographics\n\n[edit]\n\nHistorical population CensusPop.Note%± 18504,668—18609,07094.3%187017,37591.6%188027,98561.1%189037,24933.1%190063,78671.2%1910115,69381.4%1920186,66761.3%1930359,32892.5%1940528,96147.2%1950806,70152.5%19601,243,15854.1%19701,741,91240.1%19802,409,54738.3%19902,818,19917.0%20003,400,57820.7%20104,092,45920.3%20204,731,14515.6%2023 (est.)4,835,125[9]2.2%\n\n2020 census\n\n[edit]\n\nHarris County, Texas – Racial and ethnic composition\n\nNote: the US Census treats Hispanic/Latino as an ethnic category.

Among those who spoke other languages, 46% of Spanish speakers, 37% of Vietnamese speakers, 50% of Chinese speakers, 85% of French speakers, and 72% of Urdu speakers said that they spoke English at least \"very well\".[25] By 2020, 55.6% of the county aged 5 and older spoke English only, and 44.4% spoke another language instead of English; Spanish remained the second-most spoken language (35%).[26]\n\nReligion\n\n[edit]\n\nIn 2010 statistics, the largest religious group in Harris County was the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Galveston–Houston, with 1,947,223 Catholics worshiping at 109 parishes, followed by 579,759 Southern Baptists with 811 congregations, 348,461 non-denominational Christian adherents with 577 congregations, 182,624 United Methodists with 124 congregations, an estimated 117,148 Muslims with 47 congregations, 44,472 LDS Mormons with 77 congregations, 39,041 Episcopalians with 43 congregations, 34,957 PC-USA Presbyterians with 49 congregations, 33,525 Churches of Christ Christians with 124 congregations, and 30,521 LCMS Lutherans with 46 congregations. Altogether, 58.4% of the population was claimed as members by religious congregations, although members of historically African-American denominations were underrepresented due to incomplete information.[27] In 2014, the county had 1,607 religious organizations, the third most out of all U.S. counties.[28]\n\nGovernment and politics\n\n[edit]\n\nCounty governments serve as agents of the state, with responsibilities defined in the Texas Constitution. Counties are governed by the commissioners' court. Each Texas county has four precinct commissioners and a county judge. Although this body is called a court, it conducts the general business of the county and oversees financial matters.[29] The commissioners court may hire personnel to run major departments, such as health and human services.\n\nBesides the county judge and commissioners, the other elective offices found in most counties include the county attorney, county and district clerks, county treasurer, sheriff, tax assessor-collector, justices of the peace, and constables. As a part of the checks and balances system, counties have an auditor appointed by the district courts.[29]\n\nHarris County was one of the earliest areas of Texas to turn Republican. It voted Republican in all but one presidential election from 1952 to 2004, the lone break coming when native Texan Lyndon Johnson carried it in his 44-state landslide in 1964. In 2008, Barack Obama was the first Democrat to win the county since Texas native Lyndon Johnson in 1964. The city of Houston itself holds one of the highest concentrations of Democratic voters in the state, while suburban areas such as Cypress, Spring, and Katy in the county's western and northern areas, tend to be strongly Republican. In 2016, Hillary Clinton won the county by the largest margin for a Democrat since 1964.[30] The Democratic Party performed very strongly in the county during the 2018 elections, as it did nationwide.[31] In 2020, Joe Biden improved Clinton's performance by two points while Donald Trump only increased his vote share by one point. Regardless of the shift towards Democrats and being the most populated county in Texas, for the past 4 elections that it voted for a Democrat, it has always voted to the right of Dallas, Travis, Bexar, and El Paso, each of which have a smaller population.[32]\n\nIn 2013, Allen Turner of the Houston Chronicle said that residents of Harris County were \"consistently conservative in elections\" and that they were, according to a Rice University Kinder Institute for Urban Research opinion poll, \"surprisingly liberal on topics such as immigration, gun control and equal matrimonial rights for same-sex couples\".[33] Harris is regarded as a moderate or swing county in Texas, and has been a bellwether in presidential elections, voting for winners of every presidential election from 2000 through 2012 (both Barack Obama and Texas resident George W. Bush won the county twice).[33]\n\nAs a result of the Obama sweep in 2008, many Democratic candidates in contests for lower-level offices also benefited, and many Republican incumbents were replaced by Democrats in the Harris County courthouse. Some of the defeated Republican district court judges were later re-appointed to vacant District Court benches by Governor Rick Perry. In 2018, Democrats swept the court capturing all 59 seats on the civil, criminal, family, juvenile and probate courts.[34]\n\nThe Kinder Institute's Houston Survey in 2018 found that from 2014 through 2018 the number of Houston residents who supported adoption of children by same-sex couples climbed above 50% and remained there, while in 2017 over 56% of residents reported gay or lesbian persons among their circle of close personal friends. A 2013 opinion poll had found that 46% of Harris County residents supported same-sex marriage, up from 37% in 2001. Just above 82% favored offering illegal immigrants a path to citizenship provided they speak English and have no criminal record, holding from 83% in 2013, which was up from 19% in 2009. In 2013, 87% supported background checks for all firearms, the latest year that question was included in the Kinder Houston Survey. This measure has moved up steadily from 60% in 1985 to 69% in 2000.[35][33]\n\nUnited States presidential election results for Harris County, Texas[36] Year Republican Democratic Third party No. % No. % No. % 2020 700,630 42.69% 918,193 55.94% 22,434 1.37% 2016 545,955 41.61% 707,914 53.95% 58,243 4.44% 2012 586,073 49.31% 587,044 49.39% 15,468 1.30% 2008 571,883 48.82% 590,982 50.45% 8,607 0.73% 2004 584,723 54.75% 475,865 44.56% 7,380 0.69% 2000 529,159 54.28% 418,267 42.91% 27,396 2.81% 1996 421,462 49.24% 386,726 45.18% 47,705 5.57% 1992 406,778 43.14% 360,171 38.20% 175,998 18.66% 1988 464,217 57.02% 342,919 42.12% 7,024 0.86% 1984 536,029 61.46% 334,135 38.31% 2,003 0.23% 1980 416,655 57.87% 274,061 38.06% 29,298 4.07% 1976 357,536 52.17% 321,897 46.97% 5,831 0.85% 1972 365,672 62.56% 215,916 36.94% 2,943 0.50% 1968 202,079 42.90% 182,546 38.75% 86,412 18.35% 1964 154,401 40.32% 227,819 59.49% 765 0.20% 1960 168,170 51.68% 148,275 45.57% 8,954 2.75% 1956 155,555 61.11% 93,961 36.91% 5,033 1.98% 1952 146,665 57.63% 107,604 42.28% 228 0.09% 1948 43,117 35.16% 58,488 47.70% 21,012 17.14% 1944 11,843 11.37% 71,077 68.27% 21,199 20.36% 1940 20,797 22.02% 73,520 77.84% 136 0.14% 1936 8,083 11.97% 59,205 87.67% 245 0.36% 1932 8,604 15.37% 46,886 83.77% 480 0.86% 1928 27,188 55.70% 21,536 44.12% 86 0.18% 1924 8,953 27.57% 20,648 63.57% 2,878 8.86% 1920 7,735 26.82% 14,808 51.35% 6,294 21.83% 1916 3,009 22.05% 10,131 74.24% 507 3.72% 1912 726 8.01% 6,409 70.69% 1,931 21.30%\n\nCounty facilities\n\n[edit]\n\nThe 1910 county courthouse was renovated in the 1950s to update its systems. In the 21st century, the facility received another major renovation. Completed in 2011, the $50 million, eight-year project was designed to restore notable historic aspects of the courthouse while providing for contemporary communication and building needs.[37]\n\nThe Texas First Court of Appeals and the Texas Fourteenth Court of Appeals, since September 3, 2010, are located in the 1910 Harris County courthouse.[38][39] Previously they were located on the campus of the South Texas College of Law.[40]\n\nThe Harris County Jail Complex of the Harris County Sheriff's Office (HCSO) is the largest in Texas, and one of the largest in the nation. In July 2012, the facility held 9,113 prisoners. To handle overcrowding in the facility, the county had to ship inmates to other counties and some are housed out of the state.[41]\n\nThe county has a potter's field, the Harris County Cemetery on Oates Road in Houston, which previously had housing for elderly people. It has 18 acres (7.3 ha) of land. It was established in 1921 on property taken from police officers who had acted corruptly. The county paid $80,000 for 100 acres (40 ha) of land, then put in the Harris County Home For the Aged, a poor farm for elderly people of all races which had a capacity of 100; the poor farm opened in 1922. Around that time, the county cemetery was also established there. The Harris County Commissioners closed the poor farm in August 1958.[42] In 2014, no more burials were allowed to occur at the Oates Road facility due to overcapacity.[43]\n\nBy 2013 the county was building a second potter's field due to overcapacity at the first.[42] Harris County Eastgate Cemetery had started operations in 2014.[43] It is near the Crosby census-designated place and has a Crosby postal address.[44]\n\nThe county had a poor farm in what is now West University Place that closed in 1923. The county cemetery was formerly there; the bodies were transferred to the new property.[42]\n\nCounty government\n\n[edit]\n\nHarris County elected officials\n\n[edit]\n\nPosition Name Party County Judge Lina Hidalgo Democratic District Attorney Kim Ogg Democratic County Attorney Christian D.

Klein)\n\nThe county has an elections administrator and elections office, which is scheduled to be non-partisan. The State of Texas Legislature passed a law, SB 1750, that asks for the position to be abolished effective September 2023, as the law states that any county with at least 3,500,000 persons should have elections done by the clerk and tax assessor-collector; of all Texas counties, only Harris would be affected. In August 2023, Karin Crump, the presiding judge of Travis County, stated that this went against the Texas Constitution, citing how the law only affected one county.[47]\n\nCounty services\n\n[edit]\n\nThe Harris County Flood Control District manages the effects of flooding in the county.\n\nThe Harris County Sheriff's Office operates jail facilities and is the primary provider of law enforcement services to the unincorporated areas of the county. The sheriff is the conservator of the peace in the county. The Harris County jail facilities are in northern downtown on the north side of the Buffalo Bayou. The 1200 Jail,[48] the 1307 Jail, (originally a TDCJ facility, leased by the county),[49] and the 701 Jail (formed from existing warehouse storage space) are on the same site.[50]\n\nThe Community Services Department provides community services. The department maintains the 20 acres (8.1 ha) Oates Road Cemetery (also known as the Harris County Cemetery) for indigents in eastern Houston, near the former Southern Bible College. In March 2010, the county adopted a cremation first policy, meaning that the default preference for most indigents is to have them cremated instead of buried. As of 2010, the county authorized the Community Services Department to purchase about 50 acres (20 ha) of land in the Huffman area so the county will have additional spaces for indigent burials.[51]\n\nThe Harris County Housing Authority (HCHA) is a governmental nonprofit corporation which addresses the need for quality affordable housing.[52] The HCHA has been recognized by the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development as the highest performing housing authority in the region and was named one of America's 10 best Public Housing Authorities.[53] Guy R. Rankin, IV is chief executive officer of Harris County Housing Authority (HCHA).\n\nState government\n\n[edit]\n\nThe Texas Department of Criminal Justice operates some correctional facilities in Harris County, including:\n\nKegans Unit, located in Downtown Houston, is a state jail for men. It is in the north of downtown along the north side of the Buffalo Bayou, next to the county facilities.[54]\n\nPam Lychner Unit, named after Pam Lychner and located in unincorporated northeast Harris County, east of the city of Humble, is a state jail for men.[55][56]\n\nAs of 2001, Kegans and Lychner serves male state jail offenders from Harris County, with Kegans getting lower-risk offenders and Lychner getting higher-risk and special-needs offenders. If both of the male state jails in Harris County are full, excess offenders go to the Gist Unit in Jefferson County. Female state jail offenders from Harris County go to the Plane Unit in Liberty County.[57]\n\nThe South Texas Intermediate Sanction Facility Unit, a parole confinement facility for males operated by Global Expertise in Outsourcing, is in downtown Houston, west of Minute Maid Park.[58]\n\nLaw enforcement\n\n[edit]\n\nAs of 2018 there are over 60 law enforcement agencies operating in the county.[59] They include: the Harris County Sheriff's Office, the Harris County Constable Office, the Houston Police Department, METRO Police Department, other municipal police departments, and school district police departments.[60]\n\nThe combined yearly sum spent by these agencies circa 2018 was $1.6 billion. That year the Rice University Kinder Institute for Urban Research released a report advocating for consolidating several of these agencies as a way of saving taxpayer money.[59]\n\nAdministration by judiciary\n\n[edit]\n\nThe chief administrative officer of a Texas County, as set up in the Texas Constitution, is the County Judge, who sits as the chair of the county's Commissioners' Court (the equivalent of a Board of Supervisors in some other states). In 2019, Judge Lina Hidalgo was sworn in as the County Judge. The county is split into 4 geographical divisions called precincts. Each precinct elects a Commissioner to represent them on the commissioners court and oversee county government functions in the precinct.\n\nOther elected positions in Harris County include a County Attorney, a County Clerk, a District Attorney, a District Clerk, a Sheriff, 8 Constables, a Tax Assessor-Collector, a County Treasurer, and every judge in the county except municipal judges, who are appointed by the mayors and confirmed by city councils of their respective cities.\n\nMany of the organs of the Harris County government reside in the Harris County Campus in Downtown Houston.\n\nEconomy\n\n[edit]\n\nSee also: Economy of Houston\n\nIn 2000, the largest employers in Harris County were Administaff, Compaq, Continental Airlines, Memorial Hermann Healthcare System, and Southwestern Bell.[61]\n\nThe University of Houston System's annual impact on the Houston-area's economy as of 2011 equates to that of a major corporation: $1.1 billion in new funds attracted annually to the Houston area, $3.13 billion in total economic benefit, and 24,000 local jobs generated.[62][63] This is in addition to the over 12,500 new graduates the UH System produces every year who enter the workforce in Houston and throughout Texas. These degree-holders tend to stay in Houston; after five years, 80.5% of graduates are still living and working in the region.[63]\n\nIn 2009, 20% of the office space in northwest Harris County was vacant. As of that year, more office space was being built; in 2010, northwest Harris will have twice the amount of office space that it had in 2009. The vacancy rate in the area near Farm to Market Road 1960 and Texas State Highway 249 in north Harris County was 53% in 2009.[64]\n\nVarious companies are headquartered in incorporated and unincorporated areas throughout Harris County.\n\nAcademy Sports and Outdoors, a sporting goods retailer, has its corporate offices and product distribution center in unincorporated western Harris County.[65] Hewlett-Packard formerly operated its United States region office in a complex northwest unincorporated Harris County; the complex formerly belonged to Compaq prior to Compaq's merger with HP.[66][67] The HP offices, which are now occupied by Hewlett Packard Enterprise, are now in a limited purpose annexation in Houston.[68] Smith International has its headquarters in the Greenspoint district and in an unincorporated area in Harris County.[69][70] BJ Services Company has its headquarters in the Spring Branch district and in unincorporated Harris County.[71][72] Cybersoft Technologies has its headquarters in an unincorporated area.[73] In 2012, Noble Energy announced that it was consolidating its headquarters and two other Greater Houston offices into a 10-story building on the former Compaq headquarters property in unincorporated Harris County.[74] In 2022, ExxonMobil announced it was moving its headquarters to Harris County from Irving, Texas.[75] Goya Foods previously had its Texas offices in an unincorporated area in the county.[76]\n\nGeneral Electric operates an aeroderivative division facility on Jacintoport in unincorporated Harris County.[77][78] Randall's Food Markets, a subsidiary of Safeway Inc., has its distribution center in unincorporated Harris County.[79]\n\nIn 2008, KBR announced that it will open a new office facility in an unincorporated area in western Harris County.[80] In December KBR said that it would not continue with the plans due to a weakened economy.[81] In January 2009 KBR announced that it will not open the new office facility.[82]\n\nEducation\n\n[edit]\n\nPrimary and secondary schools\n\n[edit]\n\nThe Harris County Department of Education, a county division overseeing education by local school districts, with a 2011 budget around $100 million, is headquartered in the Ronald W. Reagan Building in the Northside district in Houston. It has an Adult Education Center in the Northside and an office in the North Post Oak Building in Spring Branch.[72][83][84]\n\nSeveral school districts serve Harris County communities. Among the 26 districts are:[85]\n\nAldine ISD\n\nAlief ISD\n\nChannelview ISD\n\nClear Creek ISD\n\nCrosby ISD\n\nCypress-Fairbanks ISD\n\nDayton ISD\n\nDeer Park ISD\n\nGalena Park ISD\n\nGoose Creek CISD\n\nHouston ISD\n\nHuffman ISD\n\nHumble ISD\n\nKaty ISD\n\nKlein ISD\n\nLa Porte ISD\n\nNew Caney ISD\n\nPasadena ISD\n\nPearland ISD\n\nSheldon ISD\n\nSpring ISD\n\nSpring Branch ISD\n\nStafford MSD\n\nTomball ISD\n\nWaller ISD\n\nOn July 1, 2013, the North Forest Independent School District closed and its territory became a part of Houston ISD.[86]\n\nIn addition, state-operated charter schools are in the county. Charter schools in unincorporated areas include:\n\nJamie's House Charter School (6–12)\n\nRichard Milburn Academy Houston (high school) – Of Milburn Schools[87]\n\nYES Prep North Central of YES Prep Public Schools\n\nThe department of education of the county operates the Highpoint Schools.[88]\n\nColleges and universities\n\n[edit]\n\nFour separate and distinct state universities are located in Harris County. The University of Houston is a nationally recognized Tier One research university, and is the flagship institution of the University of Houston System.[89][90][91] The third-largest university in Texas,[92] the University of Houston counted 43,774 (fall 2016)[93] students on its 667-acre campus in southeast Houston. The University of Houston–Clear Lake and the University of Houston–Downtown are stand-alone universities; they are not branch campuses of the University of Houston. Located in the historic community of Third Ward is Texas Southern University, one of the largest historically black colleges and universities in the United States.\n\nSeveral private institutions of higher learning—ranging from liberal arts colleges to a nationally recognized research university—are located within Harris County. Rice University is one of the leading teaching and research universities of the United States and ranked the nation's 17th best overall university by U.S. News & World Report.[94]\n\nFour community college districts exist with campuses in and around Harris County:[95]\n\nThe Houston Community College System serves Houston ISD (including the former North Forest ISD), Katy ISD, Spring Branch ISD, Alief ISD, and Stafford MSD.
