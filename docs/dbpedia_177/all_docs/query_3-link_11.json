        "text": "Since the first release in 2010, the County Health Rankings have helped the nation understand that where you live matters for your health. Fair access to jobs, quality education, safe, affordable housing, proximity to greenspace, and transportation shape day-to-day life and long-term opportunities for good health. This year, with the 10th anniversary of the Rankings, we highlight signs of improvement and recognize the challenges that remain to create a fair and just opportunity for everyone to be as healthy as possible.\n\nWe take a careful look at counties among the least healthy and urge consideration of the context. Past and present forms of discrimination matter. There are multiple examples of laws and policies – some that started with the birth of the nation and whose effects are still felt today – that underlie current opportunities for health. For example, this can be seen in the failure to uphold laws and treaties, including the rights of Native people; in discriminatory practices in labor, housing, bank lending, and criminal justice; and in the disinvestment in local and regional economies.\n\nWe look at signs of hope among communities doing the hard work for a better tomorrow, recognizing that our actions today affect future generations. Too many children continue to live in poverty. This is a challenge for counties among the least healthy, and even counties among the healthiest in each state.\n\nOften, it is necessary to look backward to understand how to move forward. By pairing data with an acknowledgment of history, we can work together to address the impacts of racism and discrimination. We can move toward healing and optimal health for all. We seek a future where everyone can thrive, no matter who you are, where you live, or how much money you have.\n\nBy ranking the health of nearly every county in the nation, County Health Rankings & Roadmaps (CHR&R) illustrates what we currently know when it comes to what is keeping people healthy or making them sick and shows what we can do to create healthier places to live, learn, work, and play. CHR&R brings actionable data, evidence, guidance, and stories to diverse leaders and residents to make it easier for people to be healthier in their communities. The Robert Wood Johnson Foundation collaborates with the University of Wisconsin Population Health Institute to bring this program to communities across the nation.\n\nRankings\n\nImage\n\nThe Rankings are based on a model of population health (see right) that illustrates the many factors that influence health and are measured in the Rankings. We report these ranks at countyhealthrankings.org, along with all the underlying measures and additional data for this year and prior years.\n\nWe compile the Rankings using county-level measures from a variety of national data sources, which can be found here. These measures are standardized and combined using scientific weights. We then rank counties within each state, providing two overall ranks that address two key questions:\n\nHealth Outcomes: How healthy are community members in a county now?\n\nHealth Factors: What are the opportunities for community members to be healthy in the future?\n\nThe ranks call attention to the wide gaps among counties within states in what matters for health. These gaps represent disparities in health outcomes and inequities in opportunities to live long and well.\n\nWhat Works for Health\n\nWhen it comes to developing and implementing solutions to problems that affect communities, evidence matters. What Works for Health is an easy-to-use, online tool that summarizes evidence for policies, programs, and systems changes that can make a difference locally.\n\nAction Center & Community Guidance\n\nWe offer many pathways for self-directed and peer learning, web-based content, and virtual interactive forums that are designed to accelerate learning and action to build healthier communities and advance equitable opportunities. Our online Action Center, featuring Action Learning Guides and a Partner Center, offers steps for communities to move forward by working together to engage diverse partner organizations and community members, assess needs and resources, and act on what’s important to create positive change that has a lasting impact.\n\nProgress in Health Factors: Key Improvements\n\nOver the course of a decade, the Rankings have helped to deepen our understanding of the conditions that shape our opportunities to live long and well. In the Rankings, we examine four factors that influence the health of counties: health behaviors, clinical care, social and economic factors, and the physical environment. In turn, each of these factors is based on several measures – the full list of factors and measures is provided here. Social and economic factors impact health more than any other group of factors.\n\nWhile there is work to be done to create communities where everyone can be their healthiest, the 2020 Rankings show us there are signs of progress in key factors. We highlight the direction health factors in U.S. counties have shifted from the 2010 to 2020 Rankings using the most recently available data for key measures of health behaviors, clinical care, social and economic factors, and the physical environment.\n\nFrom the 2010 to 2020 Rankings, there were signs of progress in social and economic factors, including more educational attainment and lower unemployment rates.\n\nThough data for the most recent years are not available, there were also signs of progress in uninsured rates for U.S. counties overall.\n\nCounties have also seen improvements in health behaviors, such as lower rates of adult smoking and teen births.\n\nWorsening in Health Factors: Key Challenges that Remain\n\nRates of children living in poverty have shown little indication of meaningful progress in the past decade and income inequality is rising.\n\nRates of homeownership have changed little over a decade. There were also signs that more adults have long commutes, spending more time to get to work.\n\nRates of adult obesity and sexually transmitted infections showed signs of worsening.\n\nToo often, these places are only recognized because they are where people experience the worst health outcomes. Yet, many of these places have achieved progress despite challenges, for example, by building from their strengths and engaging residents in decision making to improve their communities so that everyone can thrive. Following the Great Recession, more than half of counties among the least healthy in the 2010 Rankings improved in rates of unemployment and uninsured.\n\nMany communities have found a way forward through obstacles to opportunities. Past and present discriminatory policies and practices – such as racial segregation through redlining, legal actions to terminate tribal culture and land rights, and disinvestment in rural economies – have contributed to many communities consistently landing among the least healthy in measures of health and opportunity.\n\nHowever, there is work that remains. Where counties among the least healthy in the 2010 Rankings made progress, so did the rest of the nation. Other counties nationwide started ahead and outpaced counties among the least healthy, particularly for rates of children living in poverty.\n\nImage\n\nRichmond, Virginia – where nearly 60% of the 227,000 residents are people of color – is a city that recognizes that to change its future and improve health for all, it must understand its past. For many that call this former capital of the Confederacy home, decades of discriminatory policies and practices have left a heavy, lasting footprint, but now Richmond is striving to create a city of inclusion and opportunity. Historically ranked among the least healthy counties in Virginia, Richmond employs a comprehensive approach to addressing social and economic barriers, such as poverty, through the city’s Office of Community Wealth Building (OCWB). OCWB’s strategy includes systems transformation and a focus on direct services. Its workforce initiatives, which assisted over 870 people in 2019 connect residents to jobs through training, mentorship, wrap around services, and apprenticeships in efforts to address the racial gap in income – median household income is nearly $33K for Black households, $35K for Hispanic households, and $58K for White households. The city’s Building Lives to Self-Sufficiency program offers targeted support to heads of households to help them identify barriers to their success and connect them to the resources needed to overcome them.\n\nImage\n\nSitka, Alaska – a community with a population under 10,000 – realized that achieving better health for all meant honoring the social, cultural, and political fabric of this place. A vital shift in the city among local leaders, city and state agencies, and organizations working with the indigenous Tlingit people and the Sitka Tribe of Alaska (STA) is helping Sitka emerge from a painful history. Russian colonization and decades of U.S. government policies separated Native families, suppressed their culture and language, and brought about disparities in education, employment, and health. Strengthening families for the health of children has been at the core of the partnership between the Alaska Office of Children’s Services and STA in their work to better enforce the federal Indian Child Welfare Act of 1978. It affirms tribes’ jurisdiction over custody cases involving Native children and aims to keep children from being severed from their culture and identity. The state and tribal social services and courts personnel have trained and planned together, including helping non-Native state staff better understand the history and impact of trauma on tribal citizens. The collaboration has created a more culturally sensitive process for keeping Native families intact and has fundamentally shifted outcomes. Sitka now has Alaska’s lowest per capita rate of Native children removed from their homes in child welfare cases.\n\nImage\n\nGarrett County, Maryland – a rural Appalachian community of nearly 30,000 bordering Pennsylvania and West Virginia – is tackling poverty head-on with investments in education, housing, and jobs. A vast county where many residents work seasonal and lower-wage jobs, the county faces a rate of 18% of children living in poverty, compared with 12% across the state. Local leaders understand that to help families thrive, their approaches must address both the needs of children and their parents. The county’s 2-Generation approach is helping families build their own roadmap to economic stability with “pathway plans” that include goals in education, employment, and financial management. This approach helps families achieve their goals by providing supports like child and elder care and job training. The county’s scholarship program is boosting educational attainment by allowing residents with a high school degree or GED to attend Garrett College tuition-free, changing the trajectory of more than 2,000 students’ lives since its 2006 inception. Along with public and private partners, Garrett’s Community Action Committee is expanding housing options by developing more than 700 affordable, low-income, mixed-income, and workforce housing units.\n\nHousehold income and jobs that pay a living wage shape our opportunities and choices about housing, education, child care, food, medical care, and more. Opportunities for better health erode for households with lower income or in poverty who often face less access to good jobs with livable wages, affordable housing, and grocery stores with healthy foods. Due to various manifestations of structural racism, including redlining and discriminatory hiring practices, families of color are disproportionately represented among households of lower income and in neighborhoods segregated from economic opportunities, quality goods, and services. Systematic disinvestment in rural economies, including reduction of manufacturing sector jobs, has also affected social and economic conditions across regions of our country. Children are particularly vulnerable to the adverse effects of a lack of family income that allows enough money to cover basic needs and save for setbacks. Nearly 13 million – 1 in 6 – children in the U.S. live in poverty, a marker of both current and future health.\n\nImage\n\nSan Antonio, Texas – Home to 1.5 million people, San Antonio, Texas is the seventh largest U.S. city by population, 60% of whom are Hispanic. San Antonio offers reminders of its past, like the Mission San Juan Capistrano from 1731, and glimpses of its future, seen in the new shops and residences in the upscale Pearl District. Community partners are taking a hard look at entrenched problems to provide all with greater opportunity. The city’s Office of Equity is leading with equity in all policies to reduce health disparities and the city’s budget prioritizes the needs of residents in historically excluded neighborhoods as demonstrated by the parks and trail development in several low-income communities. UP Partnership aligns the efforts of 16 local school districts countywide to improve educational outcomes in everything from early grade reading to high school completion. Some of the greatest gains have been in reducing the uninsured rate for children and youth. Most recent data show that Bexar County has a rate of uninsured children of 8.2%, compared to the state’s uninsured rate of 11.2% and Texas is the only state with a double digit uninsured rate for children in the country. San Antonio’s Food Bank, which distributed 63 million pounds of food in 2016, goes beyond food distribution by seeking to address the root causes of food insecurity through free job training.\n\nImage\n\nBroward County, Florida – In the demographically diverse community of Broward County, Florida, with a population of 1.9 million – where nearly 60% of the population are people of color – local government is leading the charge in addressing unfair and reinforcing structures that have led to disparities. The county-led Dismantling Racism Initiative is creating space for difficult conversations through interracial dialogue and bias trainings for nearly 3,500 people within government agencies, schools, public health, and social service providers. The school system – sixth largest in the nation – is bridging the racial achievement gap with equity liaisons in every school, and efforts to increase participation from students of color in activities like computer coding and debate are helping students succeed. Broward’s intentional education focus is yielding results – graduation rates for Black students have climbed from 66% in 2013 to 81.6% in 2019, while in the same year graduation rates for Hispanic students was 86.9% and White students 91.6%. Broward is among the most expensive places to live in the country – more than half of nearly 681,500 households have work, but due to the high cost of living, struggle to afford basic needs like housing, food, child care, and transportation. To address these challenges, government, business, and nonprofit leaders work together through the Coordinating Council of Broward to pursue policy changes in partnership with residents. Together, they rallied voter support of new taxes to fund the construction of more affordable housing and transportation improvements.\n\nTechnical Notes and Glossary of Terms\n\nWhat is health equity? What are health disparities? And how do they relate?\n\nHealth equity means that everyone has a fair and just opportunity to be as healthy as possible. This requires removing obstacles to health such as poverty and discrimination, and their consequences, including powerlessness and lack of access to good jobs with fair pay, quality education and housing, safe environments, and health care.\n\nHealth disparities are differences in health or in the key determinants of health, such as education, safe housing, and discrimination, which adversely affect marginalized or excluded groups.\n\nHealth equity and health disparities are closely related to each other. Health equity is the ethical and human rights principle or value that motivates us to eliminate health disparities. Reducing and ultimately eliminating disparities in health and its determinants of health is how we measure progress toward health equity.\n\nStructural or institutional racism is race-based unfair treatment built into policies, laws, and practices. It often is rooted in intentional discrimination that occurred historically, but it can exert its effects even when no individual currently intends to discriminate.\n\nBraveman P, Arkin E, Orleans T, Proctor D, and Plough A. What is Health Equity? And What Difference Does a Definition Make? Robert Wood Johnson Foundation. May 2017.\n\nNote: In this report, we use the terms disparities, differences, and gaps interchangeably."
