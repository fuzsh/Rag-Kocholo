Census tracts are small geographic areas, designed to average 4,000 population, but vary widely. The approximate 65,000 census tracts covering the U.S. wall-to-wall provide a good geographic granularity to meet many needs. Unchanging throughout the decade, census tract boundaries are subject to update for each decennial census though many will remain unchanged for Census 2010.\n\nCensus tracts were first designed to be relatively homogeneous with respect to population characteristics, economic status, and living conditions. Over time, with demographic shifts, census tracts are often no longer so homogenous. However, tracts do closely approximate neighborhoods/neighborhood parts for many areas. The geographic size of census tracts varies widely depending on the density of settlement. Census tract boundaries are delineated with the intention of being maintained over many decades so that statistical comparisons can be made from decennial census to decennial census. Census tracts may be split due to population growth or combined as a result of substantial population decline.\n\nCensus tracts were initially identified by a four-digit basic number and with a two-digit numeric suffix; for example, 6059.02. This version of the tract code is shown in column 3 in the ranking table. The decimal point separating the four-digit basic tract number from the two-digit suffix has been historically shown in printed reports and maps. Many census tracts do not have a suffix; in such cases, the suffix field is either left blank or is zero-filled. Census tract suffixes may range from .01 to .98. These optionally ways of assigning census tract geocodes or handles has led to some vagueness potentially creating problems in handling now common spreadsheet or CSV files.\n\nThe national scope uniquely identifying tract geocode is the 11 character code shown in column 4 in the ranking table. The tract geocode is of the form SSCCCTTTTTT where SS is the FIPS state code, CCC is the county FIPS code and TTTTTT is the Census assigned tract code. In the tract geocode, there are never blanks or dots and lead zeroes are used for each the state, county and tract code components. This is the recommended tract unique identifier.\n\nAdditional Information\n\nProximity develops geodemographic-economic data and analytical tools and helps organizations knit together and use diverse data in a decision-making and analytical framework. We develop custom demographic/economic estimates and projections, develop geographic and geocoded address files, and assist with impact and geospatial analyses. Wide-ranging organizations use our tools (software, data, methodologies) to analyze their own data integrated with other data. Contact Proximity (888-364-7656) with questions about data covered in this section or to discuss custom estimates, projections or analyses for your areas of interest."
