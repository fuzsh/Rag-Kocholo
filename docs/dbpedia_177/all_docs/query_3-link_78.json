        "text": "Fountain Darter (Etheostoma fonticola)\n\nDescription:\n\nThe fountain darter is a reddish brown darter with an average length of 2.5 centimeters (1 inch). It displays a series of dark, horizontal, stitch-like lines along its sides and three dark spots at the base of the tail. Dark bars appear below, behind, and in front of the eyes. Breeding males develop black, red, and clear stripes along the dorsal fin.\n\nBehavior:\n\nThe fountain darter feeds primarily in daylight on aquatic insect larvae and small crustaceans. It is a selective feeder and prefers moving prey, remaining stationary until prey passes within striking distance. The fountain darter spawns year round, with peaks in early spring and August. After attaching eggs to mosses and algae, the female abandons the site, providing no care to eggs or fry.\n\nHabitat:\n\nThe fountain darter prefers clear, quiet backwaters with a profuse bottom growth of aquatic plants and matted algae. It is found in the San Marcos and Comal rivers.\n\nHistoric Range:\n\nThe historic range of the fountain darter included the sources, headwaters, and sections of the San Marcos and Comal rivers.\n\nCurrent Distribution:\n\nThe fountain darter is found in Spring Lake at the headwaters of the San Marcos River, in the main channel of the river to the confluence of the Blanco River, and in the Comal River. The Comal River population of fountain darters was completely eliminated when its habitat was reduced to isolated pools by a major drought in the 1950's, but the river was restocked with 457 darters taken from the San Marcos River (USFWS, 1984).\n\nSchenck and Whiteside (1976) estimated the population in the San Marcos River between Spring Lake Dam and the San Marcos Wastewater Treatment Plant outfall to be 102,966 individuals. Until recently, no population estimates had been made for the Comal River. Linam, Mayes, and Saunders (1993) conducted a study to determine habitat utilization, the amount of habitat available, and an estimate of population size. Fountain darters were found in greatest densities in filamentous algae, and the mean population estimate for the Comal River upstream of Torrey Mill Dam was 168,078 with 95% confidence limits of 114,178 and 254,110.\n\nConservation and Recovery:\n\nActions that threaten the fountain darter include the destruction of aquatic vegetation in Spring Lake and the San Marcos River, recreational use of the San Marcos River, and long-term water depletion from the Edwards Aquifer. Swimmers and divers disturb the algae mats used by the darter for spawning. As with the San Marcos gambusia, recovery is considered a remote possibility without the cooperation of all state and local agencies that manage use of the Aquifer. Linam, Mayes, and Saunders (1993) concluded that despite the successful reintroduction effort after the 1950's drought, other factors might preclude it being replicated if the Springs should cease to flow again. Back then, enduring pools of water sustained some segments of the aquatic community, providing a base for reestablishment. However, the assumption that enduring pools will once again provide a remnant habitat for aquatic plants may no longer be valid. Since the introduction of giant rams-horn snails (Marisa cornuarietis) around 1983, plants in many areas of Landa Lake have been denuded of leaves or even grazed to the bottom (Horne, et al., 1992). These snails thrive in low flow conditions, and during a drought grazing could eliminate the fountain darter habitat. In a repeat of the 1950's drought, the Springs are also likely to be dry for a much longer period of time, and there may be changes in water quality that could limit another successful reintroduction.\n\nTexas Wild Rice (Zizania texana)\n\nA canoer glides past submerged streamers of Texas Wild Rice in the San Marcos River. At left, tubers co-exist with Wild Rice in Sewell Park, just below Aquarena Springs. At right, drooping stalks above the surface produce grain-like seeds.\n\nDescription:\n\nTexas wildrice is an aquatic grass with thin, flat, elongated leaves that are typically immersed and long-streaming in river currents. Leaves often grow as long as 1.5 meters (57 inches). Flower stalks, when present, extend above the surface of the water, sometimes to a height of 1 meter (40 inches), and produce drooping heads of profuse grain-like seeds. The plant flowers and sets seed at irregular intervals from April to November. Seeding plants have become increasingly rare in the wild. It was listed as federally endangered on April 26, 1978 and state endangered on April 29, 1983. It was the first Texas plant to be placed on the endangered species list.\n\nThe leaves are linear, elongate, green, to 45 in. long, 1/4 to 1 in. wide. Flowers are arranged in a narrow panicle, 6-13 in. long, 1/2 to 4 in. wide, spreading male branches below, tighter female branches above; pikelet with one flower without glumes; male spikelets 1/4-1/2 in. long. 1/16-1/8 in. wide; female spikelets 5/16-1/2 in. long 1/16-1/8 in. wide, tipped by rough bristles 3/8-1 3/8 in. long; flowering spring and autumn.\n\nHabitat:\n\nTexas wildrice forms large clones or masses of clones that firmly root in gravel shallows near the middle of the river. This plant is adapted to fast-flowing water of high quality and constant year-round temperatures as provided by adequate spring flows. Silting, disturbance of the bottom, or stagnant water will kill off plants.\n\nHistoric Range:\n\nThis wildrice was once abundant in the San Marcos River, in contiguous irrigation ditches with constant flows, and in Spring Lake at the River's headwaters. In the 1930's it was so abundant that a local irrigation company considered it a difficult task to keep plants from clogging its ditches.\n\nCurrent Distribution:\n\nTexas wildrice is currently distributed along the upper four miles of the River in and near the city of San Marcos. In August of 2011, the Texas Parks and Wildlife Department proposed designating this stretch of the River a State Scientific Area, which is allowable under state law for the purposes of education, research, and preservation of plant and animal life.\n\nConservation and Recovery:\n\nThe major reason for decline of the San Marcos River habitat has been increased pumping and diversion of Edwards Aquifer groundwater. Decreased spring outflow lowers the water level of the River and exposes the shallows where Texas wildrice typically would grow. River dredging and damming, riverside construction, and bottomland cultivation have destroyed plants, altered stream flows and temperature, or increased siltation. In the past, intensive harvesting of the seed crop inhibited successful reproduction.\n\nBecause most of the remaining population is in the urban area of San Marcos, botanists have suggested that transplanting wildrice to some other location is the species only hope of survival. However, the Fish and Wildlife Service stresses that every effort must be made to preserve the species in its native habitat.\n\nEfforts to grow Texas wildrice in cultivation and to transplant it have met with limited success. In the 1970's, botanists attempted to establish a new population in Salado Creek with cultivated plants, but recreational activities continually disturbed transplanted clones. From 1976 to 1982, nursery grown plants were transplanted to various sites in central Texas. No new populations resulted.\n\nThe Fish and Wildlife Service Recovery Plan recommends that a public education program be established, aimed at minimizing recreational disturbance of wildrice in the San Marcos River. Ultimately, long term protection will require a management program to balance the water needs of the human population with the requirements of a healthy San Marcos River ecosystem.\n\nPeck's Cave Amphipod (Stygobromus pecki)\n\nPhotograph by Joe N. Fries\n\nDescription:\n\nPeck's cave amphipod is a subterranean, aquatic crustacean in the family Crangonyctidae. Like all members of the exclusively subterranean genus Stygobromus, this species is eyeless and unpigmented. The Fish and Wildlife Service has used \"cave amphipod\" as a generic common name for members of this genus, and this name was simply transliterated as \"Peck's cave amphipod\" without reference to a particular cave.\n\nHabitat:\n\nOver 300 specimens of Peck's cave amphipod have been collected since its description. Most specimens were netted from crevices in rock and gravel near the three largest orifices of Comal Springs on the west side of Landa Park in Comal County (Arsuffi, 1993) and (Barr, 1993). Barr collected one specimen from a fourth Comal Spring run on private property adjacent to Landa Park and one specimen from Hueco Springs, about four miles north of Comal Springs (Barr, 1993). Despite extensive collecting efforts, no specimens have been found in other areas of the Edwards Aquifer, indicating that its primary habitat is a zone of permanent darkness in the underground Aquifer feeding the springs. Above ground, individuals are easy prey for predators, but they usually take shelter in the rock and gravel crevices and may succeed in reentering the Spring orifice. In 1993 Barr got most specimens in drift nets at Spring orifices and found them less often as she moved downstream, supporting the notion they may be easy prey and do not likely survive for long outside the Aquifer.\n\nHistoric Range:\n\nNothing is known about whether this species may have historically ranged in other springs that are now dry almost all the time, such as San Pedro Springs and San Antonio Springs. The first recorded specimen was collected by Peck at Comal Springs in June 1964. Reddell collected a second specimen at the same place in May 1965. In 1967, Holsinger named the species Stygonectes pecki, in Peck's honor, selecting the 1965 specimen as the type specimen. Later he included all the nominal Stygonectes species in the synonymy of the large genus Stygobromus.\n\nCurrent Distribution:\n\nPeck's cave amphipod is known from Comal Springs and Hueco Springs, both in Comal County. The exact depth and subterranean extent of the ranges of this species is not precisely known because of a lack of methodologies available for studying karst aquifer systems and the organisms that inhabit such systems. Presumably an interconnected area, the subterranean portion of this habitat, provides for feeding, growth, survival, and reproduction of the Peck's cave amphipod. However, no specimens have appeared in collections from 22 artesian and pumped wells flowing from the Edwards Aquifer (Barr, 1993), suggesting this species may be confined to small areas surrounding the Spring openings and is not distributed throughout the Aquifer. Barr also surveyed nine springs in Bexar, Comal, and Hays counties considered most likely to provide habitat for endemic invertebrates and found Stygobromus pecki only at Comal and Hueco springs.\n\nConservation and Recovery of the Aquatic Invertebrate Species:\n\nConservation and management of the Peck's cave amphipod, Comal Springs riffle beetle, and Comal Springs dryopid beetle are likely to involve protection and conservation of the Edwards Aquifer and springflow at Comal, Hueco, San Marcos, and Fern Bank Springs. These species' very limited habitat is likely to be lost through drying or decreased volume of springflow during minor or severe drought. It is likely the effect of natural droughts in south central Texas will increase in severity because of the large increase in human groundwater withdrawals. Many possible effects of reduced springflow exist. These include changes in the chemical composition of the water in the Aquifer and at the Springs, a decrease in current velocity and corresponding increase in siltation, and an increase in temperature and temperature fluctuations in the aquatic habitat (McKinney & Watkins, 1993).\n\nAnother threat to the habitat of these species is the potential for groundwater contamination. Pollutants of concern include those associated with human sewage, leaking underground storage tanks, animal/feedlot waste, agricultural chemicals (especially insecticides, herbicides, and fertilizers) and urban runoff (including pesticides, fertilizers, and detergents).\n\nPipeline, highway, and railway transportation of hydrocarbons and other potentially harmful materials in the Edwards Aquifer recharge zone and its watershed, with the attendant possibility of accidents, present a particular risk to water quality in Comal and San Marcos Springs. Comal and San Marcos Springs are both located in urbanized areas. Hueco Springs is located alongside River Road, which is heavily traveled for recreation on the Guadalupe River, and may be susceptible to road runoff and spills related to traffic. Fern Bank Springs is in a relatively remote, rural location and its principal vulnerability is probably to contaminants associated with leaking septic tanks, animal/feedlot wastes, and agricultural chemicals.\n\nAlthough these species are fully aquatic and two of the three require flowing water for respiration, the absolute low water limits for survival are not known. They survived the drought of the middle 1950's, which resulted in cessation of flow at Comal Springs from June 13 through November 3, 1956. Hueco Springs is documented to have gone dry in the past (Brune, 1981), (Barr, 1993).\n\nThese invertebrates were not extirpated by the only recorded temporary cessation of springflow. However, given that they are fully aquatic and that no water was present in the Springs for a period of several months, they were probably negatively impacted. These species are not likely adapted to surviving long periods of drying (up to several years in duration) that may occur in the absence of a water management plan for the Edwards Aquifer that accommodates the needs of these invertebrates.\n\nStagnation of water may be a limiting condition, particularly for the Comal Springs dryopid beetle and Peck's cave amphipod. Stagnation of water and/or drying within the Spring runs and the photic (lighted) zone of the Spring orifices would probably be limiting for the Comal Springs riffle beetle because natural water flow is considered important to the respiration and therefore survival of this invertebrate species. Elmid and dryopid beetles have a mass of tiny, hydrophobic (unwettable) hairs on their underside where they maintain a thin bubble of air through which gas exchange occurs (Chapman, 1982). This method of respiration loses its effectiveness as the level of dissolved oxygen in the water decreases. A number of aquatic insects that use dissolved oxygen rely on flowing water to obtain oxygen.\n\nAt present, competition is not known to be a significant threat to these species. However, two exotic snail species, Thiara granifera and Thiara tuberculata, are common in the Spring runs and, as grazers, may compete for food. Another exotic species, the giant ramshorn snail (Marisa cornuarietis), is present in two of the Spring runs and may colonize the other runs at low flow levels. Marisa can have a tremendous impact on vegetation, that in turn may affect the habitat for surface-dwelling grazers like the riffle beetle.\n\nIn July of 2007, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service designated about 50 acres around four Edwards springs as critical habitat for aquatic invertebrate species. Although they were listed in 1997, the U.S. Fish & Wildlife Service did not designate any critical habitat, leading to a 2003 lawsuit by the Center for Biological Diversity. Under the Bush administration, Fish & Wildlife Service officials contended that designating critical habitat has little effect on protecting species. The Center for Biological Diversity disagreed, and the Wildlife Service made the designation as part of a settlement. Such a designation requires federal agencies to analyze activities they undertake, fund, or permit to determine if there may be any harm to the species' habitat. If so, they must consult with the Fish & Wildlife Service to determine how to eliminate or reduce the impacts to an acceptable level.\n\nThe initial designation of 50 acres as critical habitat was deemed insufficient by scientists because it included only surface water and not the underground orifices critical to the species’ survival. So the Center for Biological Diversity and its allies filed suit again, resulting in a new proposal that was announced in October 2012.\n\nThe new proposal expands the critical habitat and includes new subsurface areas for the dryopid beetle and the Peck’s Cave amphipod. In all, 169 acres of critical habitat are being proposed. The habitat areas overlap and consist of 39 acres of surface habitat and 139 acres of subsurface habitat for the Comal Springs dryopid beetle; 38 surface acres and 138 subsurface acres for the Peck’s cave amphipod; and 54 acres of protected surface habitat for the Comal Springs riffle beetle.\n\nThe cave-dwelling invertebrates\n\nIn 1992, several local groups, (the Alamo Group of the Sierra Club, the Balcones Canyonlands Conservation Coalition, the Helotes Creek Association, the Texas Cave Management Association, and Texas Speleological Association) petitioned the US Fish and Wildlife Service to add the nine species of karst invertebrates to the List of Threatened and Endangered Wildlife. The nine species of invertebrates are known only from caves in the northern and northwest parts of Bexar county. In December 2000 the Fish and Wildlife Service designated the nine species as endangered under the Endangered Species Act.\n\nInvertebrates are animals without internal skeletons or backbones such as butterflies, beetles, grasshoppers and spiders. The nine Bexar county species listed as endangered include three beetles, five spiders, and one harvestman, a relative of the common household daddy-longlegs. Although small, ranging from less than 2 millimeters to 9 millimeters long, and generally overlooked because they spend their entire lives underground, these invertebrates are biologically and ecologically unique. They resemble creatures out of Tim Burton's animation, with eyes that are either very small or entirely absent, and bodies that are long and thin, with no coloration, appearing white but actually being transparent.\n\nFour of the species are currently only known from one cave and three others are only known from two to eight caves. It is likely these species also exist in other caves on private property which the Fish & Wildlife Service were not allowed to inspect. Although these species are known only from caves, they may also use karst passages that are too small for people or that have no known entrance at the surface. The number of caves known to contain these species is likely to increase in the future as more caves are discovered and inspected. The listing of these species was not based on a known decline in the number of individuals or the known locations, but rather on evidence that all these species are subject to threats to their continued existence throughout all or most of their range.\n\nThese species are currently being threatened by the rapid pace of development around San Antonio and northern Bexar county. Development can degrade the cave environment through increased vandalism, contamination from sewer or septic tank leaks, storm water run-off, pesticides, or chemical spills. Development can also destroy the cave outright through digging or filling. These species are also threatened by the invasion of non-native fire ants which can prey upon them as well as compete with them for their limited sources of food.\n\nA number of the caves where these species are found are located on the Texas Parks and Wildlife Department's Government Canyon State Natural Area and the U.S. Army's Camp Bullis, both of which have developed and implemented protective management plans.\n\nThe invertebrates are highly adapted to their underground home, an environment which has a very stable temperature; very high, constant humidity; and little food. The lack of food and stability of their environment leads to an ecosystem with very few species. This makes cave environments valuable areas for ecological research. It also means that a sudden change in the environment or loss of a species could quickly wipe out the entire ecosystem.\n\nEcologically, cave invertebrates can be described as more similar to large mammals like elephants than to their invertebrate cousins which live on the surface. Like elephants, they have few offspring and live relatively long lives (for invertebrates), a characteristic ecologists call \"K-selected\". This also means their populations are more sensitive to losing even fairly small numbers of individuals, and that it takes a long time for their population sizes to recover from any catastrophe.\n\nThe surface environment of karst areas is also an integral part of the habitat needed by the animals inhabiting the underground areas. Because plants cannot grow in the blackness of caves, the cave ecosystem is entirely dependent on input from the outside. Food in a cave can come either through animals that cave biologists call \"trogloxenes\", which roost in the cave but forage for food on the outside, like bats, mice, or cave crickets, or through organic material like leaves being washed into the cave entrance or filtered in through the ground above the cave. Mammal feces provide a medium for the growth of fungi and, subsequently, localized population blooms of several species of tiny, hopping insects. These insects reproduce rapidly on rich food sources and may become prey for some predatory cave invertebrates. The nine listed invertebrates are probably predaceous and eat the eggs, larvae, or adults of other cave invertebrates.\n\nCave invertebrates typically also have very low metabolisms, an adaptation to the sparse amounts of food found in their environment. Some biologists have hypothesized that the stereotypical characteristics of cave-dwelling species, such as the lack of pigment (white color) and reduced or absent eyes (blind), have evolved as a measure to conserve energy and channel their limited resources to more useful features like antennae and chemical and touch receptors, which are typically highly developed in cave species. In fact, because they are adapted to an environment with little food, pollution by the addition of large amounts of nutrients to the cave can actually be harmful to the species, because it allows invertebrates that are not cave adapted, such as cockroaches and a variety of flies to survive in the cave and even out-compete the cave species. The healthy cave ecosystem lies in a delicate balance between too little food and too much.\n\nConservation and Recovery of the karst invertebrate species:\n\nIn general, conservation measures for species listed as endangered or threatened under the Endangered Species Act include recognition, recovery actions, requirements for Federal protection, and prohibitions against certain practices. Recognition through listing encourages and results in conservation actions by Federal, State, and local agencies, private organizations, and individuals. The Act provides for possible land acquisition and cooperation with the States and requires that recovery actions be carried out for all listed species.\n\nIn 2002, shortly after the specis were first listed in 2000, the US Fish and Wildlife Service proposed designating 9,516 acres as critical habitat for the species, but under the Bush administration only 1,063 acres were designated.\n\nOn May 23 2008 the US Fish and Wildlife Service released a Draft Recovery Plan that suggests reducing threats to the species by securing an adequate quantity and quality of caves, including their drainage basins and the natural surface plant and animal communities. Conservation of endangered species also involves protection of the ecosystems that support them. For these nine invertebrates, conservation requires maintaining moist, humid conditions in the caves they inhabit and stable temperatures in the air-filled voids; maintaining an adequate nutrient supply; preventing contamination of the water entering the ecosystem; preventing or controlling invasion of nonnative species such as fire ants; and maintaining of a healthy ecosystem surrounding the karst features. Another important component of species recovery is education. Without an educated and concerned public, these species will probably become extinct.\n\nThe plan estimates that eventual delisting of the nine species could cost $140 million over 25 years. All the Bexar county karst invertebrates have been assigned a \"Recovery Priority Number\" of 2c, which means these species face a high degree of threat and a high potential for recovery and there may be conflict between species recovery and economic development.\n\nIn 2009 the Service was forced to re-evaluate its process for critical habitat designation in response to a lawsuit filed by local and national environmental groups concerned about construction projects that would threaten the species. In February of 2011, the Fish and Wildlife Service asked for public comment on designation of an additional 6,906 acres as critical habitat. If adopted, the designation could have impacts on many development projects proposed for north and northwest Bexar county. Although critical habitat designations only apply to projects that use federal funding or require a federal permit, the designation would draw focus to TCEQ rules about not filling in or damaging caves and city of San Antonio requirements that developers follow federal laws regarding not harming endangered species.\n\nThis section was prepared using Fish and Wildlife Service news releases, the 2008 Draft Recovery Plan, and San Antonio Express-News articles."
