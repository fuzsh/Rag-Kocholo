        "text": "In this article, we will be covering the 15 fastest-growing counties in the US. If you wish to skip our detailed analysis, you can move directly to the 5 Fastest Growing Counties in the US.\n\nPopulation Dynamics at the County Level\n\n2022 witnessed a rebound in population patterns for the US counties. In terms of overall population, 19.5% of the US counties had a resident population of 100,000 or above in 2022 while only 1.5% had a population of 1 million or above. At the same time, less than 25,000 resided in 48.7% of the counties.\n\nAs reported by the US Census Bureau, counties with large colleges and universities experienced their populations return to pre-pandemic levels as students began to come back. A prime example of this was Whitman County which hosts the Washington State University and saw its population climb by 10.1% although it had declined 9.6% between 2020 and 2021. Simultaneously, domestic outmigration became slow in some of the urban counties in the country. Overall, the nation’s South or West hosted all 10 of the most rapidly growing counties in 2022. Dallas County in Texas achieved the fastest population gain since 2017 by gaining 13,000 people from 2021 to 2022.\n\nRecent Population Gains in Counties\n\n2023 further demonstrated a rebound since more counties saw population growths than losses. Between 2022 and 2023, 1,876 of the US counties experienced population gains. This number rose from 1,649 counties between 2021 to 2022. Geographical trends depict that the Midwest and Northeast witnessed more population gains in their counties in 2023 while the population seemed to drop in counties in the West. You can view the fastest growing states in the US to have a better idea of regional population growths. Since 2020, population gains have been reported to surpass the losses in the Midwestern counties. Population growth was relatively faster in the South as 67% of the region’s counties saw their populations increase in 2023 as compared to 59% in 2022. Population losses in the Northeast also became moderate, with the population rising from 83 counties in 2022 to 105 in 2023.\n\nIn terms of size, the population increased on average in counties with populations above 100,000 and those between 10,000 and 100,000. On the other extreme, counties with populations below 10,000 saw an average annual population decrease of 0.27%. You can also take a look at some of the fastest declining cities in the US.\n\nFactors Driving Population Changes in Counties\n\nInternational migration, domestic migration, and natural change influence the population changes in counties. Let's take a look at how these factors influenced county populations in 2023.\n\nPositive net international migration was seen to take place in 80% of the US counties in 2023. Connecticut, Delaware, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, New Jersey, and Rhode Island were among the states where all counties had positive net international migration.\n\nOn the county level, positive net domestic migration also increased in 2023. Counties in the South recorded the highest net domestic in-migration. Except for the West, counties with positive net domestic migration increased among the counties in all US regions. Share of these counties was the highest in the Northeast.\n\nNatural decrease went down from prevailing in 74.3% counties in 2022 to 69% counties in 2023. Alabama, Arkansas, Illinois, Kentucky, Michigan, Ohio, Pennsylvania, and Tennessee are some of the states where most of the counties had to undergo natural decrease. The natural decrease was the highest in Pinellas, Sarasota, Brevard, Volusia, and Marion. On the other hand, natural increase was the strongest in Harris County in Texas, Los Angeles County in California, and Dallas County in Texas.\n\nFastest declining counties with populations above 20,000 in 2023 include California's Lassen County which had a population decline of 3.9% and Missouri's Randolph County where population went down by 2.1%. New York's Bronx County also saw its population dropping by 1.8%. In the case of numeric declines, California's Los Angeles County ranked at the top and lost 56,420 people, as a result of negative domestic migration. Population also decreased by 28,306 in Kings, 26,362 in Queens, and 25,332 in Bronx county. Other large numeric drops in populations occurred in Cook County in Illinois, Philadelphia County in Pennsylvania, and Orange County in California.\n\nBusiness in Fastest Growing Areas\n\nIn 2023, some of the fastest growing counties in the United States were found to be in the South.
