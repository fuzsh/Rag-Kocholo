        "text": "This analysis predates the COVID-19 crisis and the economic impacts that followed. It is offered as an overview of the Upper East regional economy and a resource for comparative purposes.\n\nThe 23-county Upper East region encompasses about 16,000 square miles in the northeast corner of Texas, stretching from the Arkansas and Louisiana borders on the east to Cedar Creek Reservoir in the west.\n\nThe Upper East region includes three metropolitan statistical areas (MSAs): the Longview MSA, comprising Gregg, Rusk and Upshur counties; the Texarkana MSA, which comprises Bowie County, and the Tyler MSA, comprising Smith County. Counties in the region not associated with an MSA include Anderson, Camp, Cass, Cherokee, Delta, Franklin, Harrison, Henderson, Hopkins, Lamar, Marion, Morris, Panola, Rains, Red River, Titus, Van Zandt and Wood counties. The economic core of the Upper East region is the city of Tyler (Smith County).\n\nThis report examines regional economic trends including population, household income, jobs and wages and education, as well as economic conditions unique to the Upper East region.\n\nPopulation\n\nThe Upper East region’s estimated total population in 2019 was about 1.2 million, or 4 percent of the state’s total population. This is an increase of 4.1 percent (more than 45,000 people) since the 2010 Census. An estimated 20 percent of the region’s population is concentrated in the Tyler MSA, which also represents slightly less than 1 percent of the state’s population.\n\nFrom 2010 to 2019, the region’s population grew at a slower pace than the state. While the population of each county in the region changed during this period (Exhibit 1), Rains County outpaced all others, growing by 14.7 percent, on par with the state growth rate.\n\nPopulation Composition\n\nAccording to the U.S. Census Bureau’s 2018 American Community Survey, the median age of counties in the Upper East region is significantly higher than the state’s. In 2018, almost every county in the region (21 of 23) had a median age significantly higher than the state’s median age of 34.2 years. Marion County’s median age was more than 49, making it the region’s “oldest” county. The Tyler MSA’s median age of 36.3 years also was higher than the statewide median.\n\nThe Upper East region’s population in 2018 was 14.5 percent Hispanic, more than 24 percentage points lower than Hispanics’ 38.6 percent share of the state population (Exhibit 2). Non-Hispanic blacks represented 15.2 percent of the region’s population — 3.6 percentage points higher than the state average of 11.6 percent.\n\nHousehold Income\n\nIn 2018, the Upper East region’s median household income was $48,967. Texas’ household income is generally distributed among five income levels (Exhibit 3). Of more than 9 million Texas households, 21 percent had incomes of less than $25,000 in 2018, while 17 percent had incomes greater than $125,000. In every region in the state, nearly 18 percent of households had average incomes between $50,000 and $75,000. Household income within the Upper East region was significantly lower than the state’s; however 29 percent of the region’s households reported average incomes exceeding $75,000, versus 38 percent of the state’s.\n\nRegional Industries\n\nIn 2019, the Upper East region accounted for 3.4 percent of the state’s total employment. Exhibit 4 lists the industries with the greatest regional employment concentrations compared to the national average, as measured by location quotient (LQ). LQ represents an industry’s proportionate concentration in the region; an LQ greater than 1.0 means that industry employment is more concentrated in the region than nationally. A high LQ can identify industries that have a competitive advantage in the region, such as the ability to produce products more efficiently and of a higher quality.\n\nBased on location quotients, the Upper East region is a leader in support activities for mining, pipeline transportation and oil and gas extraction, making its economy heavily reliant on the energy sector.\n\nU.S. Military Installation Impact\n\nTexas has 14 U.S. military installations within its borders. In 2019, these bases directly employed more than 226,000 and supported nearly 634,000 jobs in all. They also contributed an estimated $75.3 billion annually to the state’s gross domestic product (GDP). Red River Army Depot, the only military installation in the Upper East region, supported an estimated 10,500 jobs in 2019 and contributed about $1.1 billion to the state’s GDP (Exhibit 5).\n\nJobs and Wages\n\nFrom 2009 to 2019, the Upper East region’s employment increased by almost 6 percent. The Tyler MSA’s job count rose by more than 13 percent over the same period (Exhibit 6). About 25 percent of the region’s total jobs are in the Tyler MSA.\n\n`\n\nSignificant Regional Occupations\n\nThe Upper East region’s most significant occupations are shown in Exhibits 7and 8, first by location quotient and second by numeric growth during the last five years.\n\nEducation\n\nA strong educational foundation provides a cornerstone for growth and competitiveness in the global economy, offering opportunities for workplace advancement and business expansion.\n\nWages by Educational Attainment\n\nPost-secondary education delivers a good return on investments of time and tuition. In the Upper East Texas region, workers with some college or associate degrees and with stable jobs — defined as those employed with the same firm throughout a calendar quarter — earned an average of $4,092 more annually in 2018 than those with a high school degree, while those with at least a bachelor’s degree earned an average of $18,557 more (Exhibit 9).\n\nThe Upper East region’s high school graduation rate has outperformed the state’s since the 2009-10 school year. During the 2017-18 school year, 93.9 percent of the region’s class of public high school senior students graduated, higher than the state’s graduation rate of 90 percent (Exhibit 10).\n\nMany high school graduates enroll in postsecondary programs, which offer greater job prospects and the possibility of higher wages. Residents of the Upper East region enjoy a variety of options for higher educational achievement (Exhibit 11).\n\nThe Upper East region’s seven community college districts provided technical and academic coursework for about 37,000 students in the 2017-18 school year (Exhibit 12).\n\nIn that year, the region’s community colleges awarded about 2,700 certificates and associate degrees in general studies and liberal arts; the next most-common awards were for health professions and mechanic and repair technologies (Exhibit 13).\n\nRegional Economy\n\nThe relative health of the Upper East region’s economy can be measured by its sales tax revenue and by comparisons with other areas on education, population, per capita income and unemployment rate. Together, these data are good indicators of the region’s economic dynamics and competitiveness.\n\nSales Tax Revenue\n\nSales taxes are inherently volatile in the short term but when reviewed over time can provide a useful indication of the state’s economic condition.\n\nSales receipts subject to state sales tax directly attributable to the Upper East region generally trended upward in the past decade, with declines during the Great recession and the severe fall in oil prices in 2016 (Exhibit 14). In 2019, taxable sales directly attributable to businesses in the Upper East region exceeded $12.8 billion, contributing about 2.3 percent to the state’s overall taxable sales. The Tyler MSA directly accounted for about $3.4 billion of this total.\n\nIn 1997, the U.S., Canada and Mexico jointly released the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS), which classifies all business enterprises for the purpose of collecting, analyzing and publishing economic statistics. A review of two-digit NAICS codes allows for a broad analysis of industry sectors.\n\nIn 2019, the Upper East region’s retail trade and food services and accommodation sectors contribute most to taxable sales, with the two sectors together accounting for almost 66 percent of the region’s total. Two other industries of note are the wholesale trade and the manufacturing sectors, which produced about 13 percent of the region’s taxable sales.\n\nUpper East Region vs. the U.S.\n\nExhibit 15 shows how the Upper East region compares with other states and the nation on several demographic and economic measures. As a state, the region would be the 42nd largest in the nation in terms of land area (just ahead of Maryland) and the 43rd largest by population.\n\nUpper East Texas Regional Summary\n\nThe Upper East region and its 23 counties have many unique economic conditions and challenges. The region features a diverse economy that is both rural and urban. Its economic hub is Smith County, the sole county in the Tyler MSA. It is the region’s most populous county as well as its second fastest growing.\n\nThe region has seen limited population growth since 2010. Its median age is significantly older than the state’s and its average household income is less than the statewide average. The U.S. military’s presence has had a positive economic impact on the region. Its high school graduation rate has reliably outperformed the state’s rate year after year, and the local economy has seen a steady increase in taxable sales since the 2009 recession.\n\nQuestions?"
