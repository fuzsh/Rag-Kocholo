We fondly remember our past as a small town along US 75 and embrace our present as a vibrant but cozy city in one of the fastest growing regions in the nation.\n\nHowever, what truly makes Allen unique is our warm and welcoming community. Whether you’ve just moved in or have lived here all your life, we couldn’t be happier that you’re here.\n\nGovernment structure\n\nCity of Allen operates under a council-manager form of government as approved by voters in 1979 through adoption of the Allen City Charter. The Allen City Council, which consists of the mayor and six councilmembers, is elected citywide by Allen voters and not by district.\n\nThe mayor and councilmembers serve three-year, staggered terms of office. These members appoint representatives to numerous citizen-led boards and commissions to advise the council on major issues. Councilmembers also appoint a City Manager to serve as the City’s chief administrative officer.\n\nHistory resources"
