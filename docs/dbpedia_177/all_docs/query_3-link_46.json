        "meta_description": "The Texas kangaroo rat is a nocturnal rodent with long hind feet, long tail and external cheek pouches (Dalquest and Horner 1984, p. 118). Hind feet have four toes and its laterally white-striped, thick tail has a conspicuous white tuft of hair on the tip and is about 160 percent of the length of the body (Merriam 1894, p. 110) (Figure 2.1). OrdÂ’s kangaroo rat, (Dipodomys ordii), the only other kangaroo rat in the TKR range, is smaller, lacks the long white hairs at the tip of the tail, has five toes on the hind feet, and lives in sandy soil uncharacteristic of TKR habitat (Dalquest and Collier 1964, p. 148; Martin 2002, p. 2). Like other Dipodomys spp., both male and female TKR possess skin glands dorsally between the shoulders, which communicate sexual receptivity (Stangl et al. 2006, p. 466). The body is relatively large averaging 120 millimeters (mm) (4.7 inches (in)) in length. The upper body is a pale yellow-brown color with blackish guard hairs and the underside of the animal is white. The nearly hairless ears are small and the eyes relatively large. The sexes are superficially indistinguishable (Strassman 2004, p. 2); however, males may be generally larger than females, especially on the eastern and western margins of their range (Best 1987, p. 57). External measurements average: total length, 317 mm (12.5 in); tail, 196 mm (7.7 in); hind foot, 46 mm (1.8 in) (Schmidly 2004, p. 366). TKR use their long hind feet for saltatorial (jumping) locomotion and escaping predators (Genoways and Brown 1993, p. 297).",

        "text": "The Texas kangaroo rat is a nocturnal rodent with long hind feet, long tail and external cheek pouches. First discovered in 1894 in Clay County, Texas, Texas kangaroo rats are granivores that use their long hind feet for saltatorial, or jumping, locomotion and escaping potential predators. Historically, the species has been detected in 11 Texas counties includingArcher, Baylor, Childress, Clay, Cottle, Foard, Hardeman, Montague, Motley, Wichita and Wilbarger; and two counties in Oklahoma, Comanche and Cotton.\n\nHabitat that supports the species' life history generally includes an accumulation of loose, friable soil, usually associated with a minor topographic uplift such as prairie mounds, or physical support. Such support includes woody vegetation like roots of shrubs and cacti, and other natural features - rocks, upturned rootballs - or manmade structures. A common characteristic of Texas kangaroo rat habitat is the presence of bare ground and short grasses, often expressed as a lack of dense vegetation. The Texas kangaroo rat digs a subterranean burrow system within loam, and or, clay-loam soils with multiple chambers branching from the main tunnel, which are used for shelter, reproduction and food storage. Resource needs for individual Texas kangaroo rats generally include:\n\nFriable, loam, and or, clay-loam soil for burrowing\n\nPredominately grasses and forbs for a food source\n\nShortgrass prairie with bare ground and limited woody cover\n\nTopographic relief not prone to flooding events\n\nThe primary factor influencing the viability of the Texas kangaroo rat is believed to be habitat loss and degradation, largely related to historical land use change. The species' preferred habitat, short grasses interspersed with areas of bare ground and minimal woody cover, is associated with disturbance. The ecological processes within the geographic range of the Texas kangaroo rat were historically influenced by the presence of American bison, black-tailed prairie dog and periodic wildfire, creating a mosaic of disturbed patches on the landscape that provided suitable habitat for the species. The expansion of Euro-Americans into the West beginning in the 1800s led directly to the decline of bison and black-tailed prairie dogs. Domestic cattle can replace some lost historical ecosystem functions in a limited capacity, but the loss of the natural assemblage provide by bison, prairie dogs and fire appears to have negatively impacted the availability of habitat for the Texas kangaroo rat.\n\nThe conversion of native rangeland to row crops is a direct loss of habitat because TKR typically do not construct burrows in agricultural crops. The ground disturbance caused by plowing and disking associated with farming, which disturbs the soil substrate, results in a loss of habitat in areas that could have previously supported the species.\n\nThe early 20th century saw a steady increase in human population within the Texas kangaroo rat's range, fueled by westward expansion and an oil boom. As a result, associated man-made infrastructure such as buildings and roads were developed in greater numbers. While paved roads may fragment habitat and create a barrier to Texas kangaroo rat dispersal, unpaved road edge provides non-traditional habitat where the species is often found. The extent to which road edge habitat provides all resource needs for the species is unknown, but the vast majority of observations from the most recent rangewide surveys were made along unpaved roadside habitat due to limited access to private lands.\n\nWoody plant encroachment threatens the persistence of grassland and savanna ecosystems and their endemic biodiversity, and represents a loss of suitable habitat for Texas kangaroo rats, as the species avoids areas of dense vegetation and closed canopy cover. Evidence suggests that within northwest Texas, the effect of and fire suppression would result in a shrubland-dominated landscape, thus decreasing the amount of available Texas kangaroo rat habitat."
