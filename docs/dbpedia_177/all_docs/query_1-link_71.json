        "text": "From 2020 to 2021, Texas had the largest population growth of any state. Much of that increase came from people moving to Texas from other states. Around 596,000 Americans from other states moved to Texas during 2020. With 421,000 Texans also leaving the state, Texas gained a net 177,000 residents through domestic migration.\n\nWhich states had the most residents move to Texas?\n\nIn 2020, around 105,000 Californians moved to Texas, more than double the next-highest state. Florida had the second-highest number of residents move to Texas (37,000) and Louisiana was third (31,000).\n\nWhy do people move to Texas?\n\nWhile there is no data on the reasons people have moved to Texas in recent years, previous research from can give some indication of potential migration drivers.\n\nFrom 2000 to 2019, the most common self-reported reason for interstate migration was job-related, including getting a new job, looking for work, or wanting an easier commute. Family reasons were the second-most common reason and included getting married or moving away from home.\n\nThese are reflected in the demographics of recent movers to Texas. They are mostly ages 25â€“44 and are more likely to have children than current Texas residents. They are also overrepresented in computer and engineering-related jobs as well as the management, business, and financial fields.\n\nWhere did this data come from?\n\nThis data came from the IRS based on filed tax returns. The data has information on tax filers who moved at a county, state, and international levels. However, it misses low-income residents who choose not to file taxes. While other sources such as the US Census Bureau have data on overall migration, it does not have the same level of detail on people moving from one specific state or country to another.\n\nLearn more about US population demographics, differences in population growth among states, why people are moving from California, and get the facts every week by signing up for our newsletter."
