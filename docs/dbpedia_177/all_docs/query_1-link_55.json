From September 2022 to the present, The Commission has been unable to verify the accuracy of the data due to its technological capabilities, thus the data has been temporarily removed from the website. Within the next few months, The Commission intends to review the data further and will post more updated information when its review is complete. If you have any questions or would like a copy of the unverified data, please contact info@tcjs.state.tx.us\n\nThe documents linked above are in PDF format, the free Adobe Acrobat Reader can be downloaded here and used to view these documents."
