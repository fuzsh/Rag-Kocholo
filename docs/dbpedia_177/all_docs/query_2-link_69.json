        "text": ".. how many people are living alone in your community, neighborhood? How does this population impact the community? What are their special needs? How does this population vary by area and population group? There were 37.9 million one-person households, 29% of all U.S. households in 2022. In 1960, single-person households represented only 13% of all households. These estimates are based on the 2022 Current Population Survey (CPS). Moving forward, the number of one-person households, people living alone, will increase at the rate of one million or more per year. People in households exclude people living in group quarters. This post examines patterns of people living alone with focus on people living alone age 65 year and over and distribution by small area geography.\n\nWhile the CPS data provide a current snapshot of the number of people living alone, we have to use data from the American Community Survey to obtain data for smaller area geography like counties and census tracts.\n\nPopulation Living Alone by Census Tract –Visual Data Analytics\n\nThe four graphics below show patterns of the population living alone by census tract. These views have been developed using the Visual Data Analytics (VDA GIS) tools with integrated demographics.

Older people have always been more likely than others to live by themselves makes up a bigger share of the population than at any time in the nation’s history. The trend has also been driven by deep changes in attitudes surrounding gender and marriage. People 50-plus today are more likely than earlier generations to be divorced, separated or never married. Similar ACS data as used to develop the graphics shown above are available by race/origin. These data are based on the ACS 2020 data; the same scope of data will be available from ACS 2021 to be released in December 2022.\n\nAbout VDA GIS\n\nVDA Web GIS is a decision-making information resource designed to help stakeholders create and apply insight.

This section examines patterns of MM by 2020 census tract in the Houston, TX area using the VDA Web GIS (VDA). You can use VDA to examine patterns of MM by tract for areas of interest. All you need is a Web browser and Internet.\n\nMM Tracts in the Houston Area\n\nThe following graphic shows patterns of the MM by tract in the Houston metro developed with VDA. The map shows tracts having more than 50% MM population with a red/salmon color. Tracts having 50% or less MM population are shown in blue/green/yellow. Harris County, TX has 1,115 2020 census tracts; 854 of these tracts have a MM population. See the partial list of those tracts by tract code and %MM in the table below the map. A query was used to determine the number of tracts meeting a criteria and sorted in descending order by %MM.\n\nSee this VDA Guide section for a step-by-step description\n\nof how you can develop this or a similar view/analysis.\n\nPercent Majority-Minority is a demographic attribute/measure for a geographic area.

What part of a ZIP code area of interest intersects with what city? Conversely, what ZIP code areas intersect with a city of interest? This section provides data and tools that can be used to answer these types of questions and gain insights into geospatial relationships. See more detailed information in the related full Web section.\n\nThe 2010 ZIP Code Tabulation Area (ZCTA) to City/Place relationship data provide a means to equivalence ZCTAs with Census 2010 cities/places. ZCTAs are geographic areas defined as sets of Census 2010 census blocks closely resembling USPS ZIP codes (lines, not areas). ZCTA boundaries are fixed for the intercensal period 2010 through 2020. Census 2010 vintage city/place areas are likewise defined as sets of Census 2010 census blocks. The ZCTA-City/place relationship data are developed through the use of the intersecting census block geography and associated Census 2010 Summary File 1 demographic data.\n\nZCTA-Place Relationships\n\nThe following graphic shows relationships between two selected ZCTAs (red boundaries) and related cities/places (blue fill pattern) in the Pima/Cochise County, AZ area. Relationships between these geographies are reviewed in examples shown below.\n\n– View developed using CV XE GIS and related GIS project.\n\nUsing the ZCTA-Place Relationship Data\n\nTwo examples illustrating how to use the ZCTA-place relationship data are provided below. The examples are interconnected to the GIS project used to develop the map views, interactive table and data file described in this section. Example 1 describes how to use the data for a ZIP code area entirely located within one city/place. Example 2 describes how to use the data for a ZIP code area located in more than one city/place and area not located in any city/place.\n\nZCTA to Place Relationships: Example 1\n\nIn this example, ZCTA 85711, highlighted in red in the graphic shown below, falls wholly within place 77000, outlined in bold black below. As a result, there is only one corresponding record for ZCTA 85711 in the relationship file. The 2010 Census population for this relationship record is 41,251 (POPPT) which is equal to the 2010 Census population for ZCTA 85711 (ZPOP). See more details about this example.\n\nZCTA to Place Relationships: Example 2\n\nIn this example, ZCTA 85630, highlighted below in red in the graphic shown below, contains two places: all of place 62280 and part of place 05770, both are outlined in black below. As a result, there are two corresponding relationship records in the relationship file. For the first relationship record, the total 2010 Census population for ZCTA is 2,819 (ZPOP). See more details about this example.\n\nUsing the Interactive Table\n\nUse the full interactive table to examine U.S. national scope ZCTA-city/place relationships. The following graphic illustrates how ZIP code can be displayed/examined for one city — Tucson, AZ. Each row summarizes characteristics of a ZIP code in Tucson. The last row in the graphic shows characteristics of ZIP code 85711 — the same ZIP code reviewed in Example 1 above.\n\nClick graphic for larger view.\n\nJoin me in a Data Analytics Lab session to discuss more details about accessing and using wide-ranging demographic-economic data and data analytics.

What are the trends; what is causing the change? What are the characteristics of income inequality and how is it changing? How might this change impact your living environment and business?\n\nThis section provides access to tools and data to examine U.S. by county measures of household income and income inequality between two 5-year periods (2006-10 and 2011-2015). These data can provide insights into how household income and income inequality are changing for one county, a group of counties and the U.S. overall. Use the interactive table to view median household income and measures income inequality for all counties. See more detail about these topics here. Measures of income inequality can be estimates/examined using the Gini Index.\n\nThe Gini Index & Measuring Income Inequality\n\nThe Gini Index is a dimensionless statistic that can be used as a measure of income inequality. The Gini index varies from 0 to 1, with a 0 indicating perfect equality, where there is a proportional distribution of income. A Gini index of 1 indicates perfect inequality, where one household has all the income and all others have no income.\n\nAt the national level, the 2015 Gini index for U.S. was 0.482 (based on 2015 ACS 1-year estimates) was significantly higher than in the 2014 ACS Index of 0.480 (based on 2014 ACS 1-year estimates). This increase suggests that income inequality increased across the country.\n\nExamining Household Income & Income Inequality Patterns & Change\n\nThe following two graphics show patterns of the GIni Index by county. The first view is based on the American Community Survey (ACS) 2010 5-year estimates and the second is based on the ACS 2015 5-year estimates. The ACS 2010 estimates are based on survey respondents during the period 2006 through 2010. The ACS 2015 estimates are based on survey respondents during the period 2011 through 2015. One view compared with the other show how patterns of income inequality has changed at the county/regional level between these two 5-year periods.\n\nFollowing these Income Inequality views are two corresponding views of median household income; using data from ACS 2010 and ACS 2015. Use CV XE GIS software with the GIS project to create and examine alternative views.\n\nPatterns of Income Inequality by County; ACS 2010\n\nThe following graphic shows the patterns of the Gini Index by county based on the American Community Survey 2010 5-year estimates (ACS1115).

What are the trends; what is causing the change? What are the characteristics of the population moving in and out? How might this impact your living environment and business?\n\nThe total net international migration among all counties 7/1/2010 – 7/1/2016 was 5,641,260, an annual average of 940,432. The sum of net domestic migration among counties is zero by definition, but domestic migration among counties varies radically by size and direction. This section is focused on U.S. by county migration from 2010 to 2016. Migration is one component of change used to develop population estimates. See more about county population estimates and components of change in this related Web section.\n\nLargest 10 Counties Based on 2016 Population\n\nThis table shows how domestic migration varies widely among the most populated counties.

There are three components of change: births, deaths, and migration. The change in the population from births and deaths is often combined and referred to as natural increase or natural change. Populations grow or shrink depending on if they gain people faster than they lose them. Examining a county’s unique combination of natural change and migration provides insights into why its population is changing and how quickly the change is occurring.\n\nUsing the Interactive Table\n\n– examining migration by county\n\nUse the interactive table to examine characters of counties by states, metro or peer group. The following graphic illustrates use of the interactive table to view net migration for the Houston metro by county. The net migration button was used to select only the net migration columns, FindCBSA button used to show only counties in this metro and the final step was to sort the resulting table on 2016 population.
