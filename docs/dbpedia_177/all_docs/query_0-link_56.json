        "text": "Results Matter\n\n...especially when it comes to spending huge amounts of time and money setting up a new business location. That's why it is important to locate the operation in a city or region that knows how to grow its economy and has the track record to prove it.\n\nFor this year's Leading Locations study, Area Development analyzed economic and work force data for 380 metropolitan statistical areas (MSAs) — both for 2011–2012 (recent performance) and 2007–2012 (duration of the Great Recession). The goal was to identify which cities across America are emerging from the recession as economic front-runners — and why.\n\nSometimes the reason for success is as simple as being in the right place at the right time (for example, being located in the middle of the oil shale boom). For most cities, though, sustained success depends on responding effectively to the many factors that impact economic performance, as well as proactively creating healthy business climates and investing in the future. This type of multilevel support helps local companies be more competitive with offshore locations, keeping profits and jobs at home.\n\nIncluded in our report is an interactive table that will allow you to view the rankings of all 380 MSAs. The report includes an overall ranking which is based on 21 economic indicators and, we also create category rankings which are based on sub-groups of indicators from the 21 indicators used for the overall results (refer to the methodology to learn more.) You can use the filters to easily segment MSAs by region, population size and state or, you can use the search field to locate a specific MSA. In the expanded version of the chart you can see how each city ranks in every one of the 21 inidcators we use in the study.\n\nLeading Locations for 2013 Results\n\nClose 6/10/2013\n\nPublishers Note: 2013 Leading Locations Rankings Correction\n\nIn the initially released 2013 Leading Locations report, a data entry error resulted in the misalignment of rankings for some MSA's – these MSA's had wrongly attributed rankings stated in each of the four indicators used within the \"Young, Prime Work Force\" and \"Prime Work Force Inward Migration\" sub-categories (see methodology for details.)\n\nAs a result of the corrections, the \"Prime Workforce\" category rankings and the overall rankings for all MSAs were minimally effected and have also been updated and restated.\n\nEmail jshea@areadevelopment.com for more information or any questions related to the above.\n\nCity\n\nState\n\n2010\n\nPopulation\n\nOverall\n\nRank\n\n1.\n\nSan Jose-Sunnyvale-Santa Clara\n\nCA\n\n1,836,911\n\n2\n\nKnown as the heart of the Silicon Valley, the San Jose MSA has a rich tradition of high-tech entrepreneurship, innovation, and discovery. About $8 billion in venture capital funding is invested in the region every year, driving R&D and commercialization efforts, especially in the fields of nanotechnology, communications, and information and computer technology (ICT). Major players include Cisco Systems, Samsung, eBay, Google, and Yahoo.\n\nTop universities in the area — San Jose State University, University of California-Berkeley, and Stanford University — attract some of the best student talent in the country, turning out an impressive number of highly skilled scientists and engineers. As a result of this stellar work force, strong economic growth, and the creation of high-paying jobs, San Jose also placed first in the 2012 Milken Institute Best-Performing Cities Index.\n\nRecent announcements include Samsung Semiconductor's expansion of its research and development campus and FICO's plans to relocate from Minneapolis to San Jose to be closer to Silicon Valley's engineering talent pool. \"By operating from the Silicon Valley, we can more readily build upon our company's deep talent pool, collaborate with other big thinkers in the world's premier technology hub, and help our customers compete more effectively in the era of big data,\" says FICO's president and CEO William Lansing.\n\n2.\n\nAustin-Round Rock-San Marcos\n\nTX\n\n1,716,289\n\n5\n\nKey industries in the Austin MSA are advanced manufacturing, electronics, multimedia technology, clean energy and power technology, life science and biotechnology, and data centers. According to the Brookings Institution, Austin ranked first overall among the 100 largest U.S. metros based on amount recovered from pre-recession peak to the present, based on jobs, unemployment, gross product, and housing prices. Further, Austin placed second on the 2012 Milken Institute Best-Performing Cities Index.\n\nMuch of this economic growth is driven by improved performance in chip-making and systems design. Dell, IBM, Apple, and Samsung are among the largest technology employers. Backed by a $21 million investment through the Texas Enterprise Fund and an $8.6 million grant from the city of Austin, Apple will undertake a $304 million expansion of its facilities, eventually creating 3,600 well-paying jobs. Samsung's $4 billion expansion of its semiconductor manufacturing operations will increase its total investment in Austin to $13 billion since 1996. GM plans to build a 500-employee innovation center and eBay, another major Austin employer, will hire about 1,000 software engineers over the next 10 years.\n\nWith this kind of growth in high-technology fields, it is no surprise that Austin has also recently been named by the Business Journals as one of the top three cities for young adults to establish careers in post-recessionary America.\n\n3.\n\nHouston-Sugar Land-Baytown\n\nTX\n\n5,946,800\n\n10\n\n4.\n\nBoston-Cambridge-Quincy (NECTA DIVISION)\n\nMA\n\n2,863,943\n\n13\n\nWith over $4 billion in new development projects totaling more than 10 million square feet under construction, Boston is booming. The Innovation District along the South Boston waterfront has attracted over 200 new companies and 4,000 new jobs across a variety of industries, including technology, life sciences, design, and advertising. Vertex Pharmaceuticals is currently building its $800 million, 1.1-million-square-foot global headquarters in the heart of the district.\n\nThe Boston MSA enjoys an international reputation for healthcare and medicine. According to Jones Lang LaSalle, nearly 75,000 people in the Boston MSA are employed in the pharmaceutical, biotechnology, and medical device industries — second only to San Diego. Boston's 22 hospitals and 34 colleges and universities are important anchors in the city's economy. The city is also the leading recipient for National Institute of Health funding in the U.S. — in fact, five of the top eight NIH-funded hospitals are within the Boston MSA.\n\nAn outstanding educational system and high quality of life are just two reasons why Boston has such a diverse and youthful population — about one third of the city's population is between the ages of 20 and 35. Many of these energetic, young professionals work in the high-tech growth sectors of advanced manufacturing, clean energy, defense, IT, and life sciences/biomedicine.\n\n5.\n\nOklahoma City\n\nOK\n\n1,252,987\n\n16\n\n6.\n\nDallas-Plano-Irving (METROPOLITAN DIVISION)\n\nTX\n\n4,235,751\n\n18\n\n7.\n\nDenver-Aurora-Broomfield\n\nCO\n\n2,543,482\n\n19\n\n8.\n\nSan Francisco-San Mateo-Redwood City (METROPOLITAN DIVISION)\n\nCA\n\n1,776,095\n\n21\n\n9.\n\nSeattle-Bellevue-Everett (METROPOLITAN DIVISION)\n\nWA\n\n2,644,584\n\n24\n\n10.\n\nTulsa\n\nOK\n\n937,478\n\n25\n\n11.\n\nWashington-Arlington-Alexandria (METROPOLITAN DIVISION)\n\nDC-VA MD-WV\n\n4,377,008\n\n27\n\n\"DC\" has one of the most diverse economies in the country. The federal government employs about one third of all workers in the city and provides contract work to hundreds of companies, especially in high-tech fields like aeronautics, defense, telecommunications, electronics, IT, and other services. Other important employment sectors are industry trade associations, financial groups, and scientific research through federal organizations, as well as top research universities and medical centers. Tourism, the second-largest industry in the city, is on the rebound — nearly19 million visitors pumped about $5 billion into the local economy last year.\n\nWith all this activity, it is no surprise that economic development and commercial construction within the city are booming. According to the Washington, D.C., Economic Partnership's 12th annual DC Development Report, about 21.5 million square feet of commercial space is under construction, valued at about $9.5 billion. Residential construction is also hot, with over 10,000 units being built — the most since 2001.\n\n12.\n\nCharleston-North Charleston-Summerville\n\nSC\n\n664,607\n\n28\n\n13.\n\nFort Worth-Arlington (METROPOLITAN DIVISION)\n\nTX\n\n2,136,022\n\n29\n\n14.\n\nSalt Lake City\n\nUT\n\n1,124,197\n\n39\n\n15.\n\nBethesda-Rockville-Frederick\n\nMD\n\n1,205,162\n\n45\n\nMajor industries in the Bethesda MSA include telecommunications, energy, technology, defense, aerospace, and healthcare. Both the National Naval Medical Center and the National Institutes of Health are located in Bethesda. Also headquartered here is Lockheed Martin, a global aerospace and security firm that conducts cutting-edge research and development and works closely with the federal government on major projects.\n\nBethesda is top-ranked for its educated, highly skilled work force. For example, the city has one of the highest per capita concentrations of doctorate degrees in the country. It ranked second in education according to Forbes 2012 \"Best Places for Business and Careers\" report. In March 2013, the city's unemployment rate was 5.1 percent.\n\nLocated in Montgomery County, Maryland, Bethesda is one of the most important economic drivers in the Greater Washington area. In May 2013 Montgomery County reported its work force had increased by nearly 25,000 jobs since 2010, a 3.9 percent growth rate. About 20 percent of these new jobs were in professional, scientific, and technical services, making these sectors the county's top job gainers. Companies that added the most jobs in Bethesda include Capital One (300 jobs) and the Henry M. Jackson Foundation (200 jobs).\n\n16.\n\nSan Antonio-New Braunfels\n\nTX\n\n2,142,508\n\n48\n\n17.\n\nNashville-Davidson--Murfreesboro--Franklin\n\nTN\n\n1,589,934\n\n50\n\n18.\n\nCincinnati-Middletown\n\nOH-KY-IN\n\n2,130,151\n\n51\n\n19.\n\nOmaha-Council Bluffs\n\nNE-IA\n\n865,350\n\n58\n\n20.\n\nBoise City-Nampa\n\nID\n\n616,561\n\n60\n\n21.\n\nMinneapolis-St. Paul-Bloomington\n\nMN-WI\n\n3,279,833\n\n62\n\n22.\n\nKnoxville\n\nTN\n\n698,030\n\n73\n\n23.\n\nPortland-Vancouver-Hillsboro\n\nOR-WA\n\n2,226,009\n\n78\n\n24.\n\nAkron\n\nOH\n\n703,200\n\n79\n\n25.\n\nBaton Rouge\n\nLA\n\n802,484\n\n85\n\n26.\n\nLouisville-Jefferson County\n\nKY-IN\n\n1,283,566\n\n88\n\n27.\n\nColumbia\n\nSC\n\n767,598\n\n91\n\n28.\n\nNew York-White Plains-Wayne (METROPOLITAN DIVISION)\n\nNY-NJ\n\n11,576,251\n\n92\n\n29.\n\nPhoenix-Mesa-Glendale\n\nAZ\n\n4,192,887\n\n98\n\n30.\n\nSan Diego-Carlsbad-San Marcos\n\nCA\n\n3,095,313\n\n102\n\n31.\n\nPittsburgh\n\nPA\n\n2,356,285\n\n110\n\n32.\n\nCharlotte-Gastonia-Rock Hill\n\nNC-SC\n\n1,758,038\n\n111\n\n33.\n\nHonolulu\n\nHI\n\n953,207\n\n113\n\n34.\n\nSt. Louis\n\nMO-IL\n\n2,812,896\n\n115\n\n35.\n\nSanta Ana-Anaheim-Irvine (METROPOLITAN DIVISION)\n\nCA\n\n3,010,232\n\n117\n\n36.\n\nGreenville-Mauldin-Easley\n\nSC\n\n636,986\n\n121\n\n37.\n\nOakland-Fremont-Hayward (METROPOLITAN DIVISION)\n\nCA\n\n2,559,296\n\n122\n\n38.\n\nToledo\n\nOH\n\n651,429\n\n123\n\n39.\n\nWichita\n\nKS\n\n623,061\n\n137\n\n40.\n\nNew Orleans-Metairie-Kenner\n\nLA\n\n1,167,764\n\n142\n\n41.\n\nCleveland-Elyria-Mentor\n\nOH\n\n2,077,240\n\n143\n\n42.\n\nRaleigh-Cary\n\nNC\n\n1,130,490\n\n148\n\n43.\n\nOxnard-Thousand Oaks-Ventura\n\nCA\n\n823,318\n\n151\n\n44.\n\nOrlando-Kissimmee-Sanford\n\nFL\n\n2,134,411\n\n155\n\n45.\n\nEl Paso\n\nTX\n\n800,647\n\n158\n\n46.\n\nWilmington (METROPOLITAN DIVISION)\n\nDE-MD-NJ\n\n705,670\n\n160\n\n47.\n\nTacoma (METROPOLITAN DIVISION)\n\nWA\n\n795,225\n\n164\n\n48.\n\nMilwaukee-Waukesha-West Allis\n\nWI\n\n1,555,908\n\n166\n\n49.\n\nKansas City\n\nMO-KS\n\n2,035,334\n\n167\n\n50.\n\nTucson\n\nAZ\n\n980,263\n\n169\n\nCity\n\nState\n\n2010\n\nPopulation\n\nOverall\n\nRank\n\n1.\n\nLafayette\n\nLA\n\n273,738\n\n1\n\nThe Lafayette MSA was ranked 24th out of 200 metro areas in the Milken Institute's Best Performing Cities Index for 2012 — a jump of 69 spots over last year's placement. The city also ranked first in current job growth and second in five-year wage growth on Milken's list. And, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the Lafayette MSA experienced the largest increase in employment in the nation from December 2011 to December 2012 with an 8.6 percent gain.\n\n\"The growth in Lafayette's economy over the past several years can be greatly attributed to steady growth in the energy and healthcare industries, which account for 40 percent of the area's GDP,\" says Lafayette Economic Development Authority president and CEO Gregg Gothreaux. \"These industries remain relatively recession-proof and will continue to contribute to Lafayette's steady economic growth, while providing an impetus for our growing finance and entertainment industries.\"\n\nThe vibrant energy sector is a big reason Louisiana Plating and Coatings decided to open a $9 million, 80,000-square-foot facility in Scott, just outside Lafayette, to provide comprehensive coating and plating services for its clients, including many oilfield servicing companies. The plant will employ 120 workers with an annual local payroll estimated at $3 million.\n\n2.\n\nFargo\n\nND-MN\n\n208,777\n\n7\n\nThe economy is on the move in Fargo, with employment in manufacturing growing by 4 percent, in back office by 5 percent, and in IT by an impressive 8.6 percent from 2011 to 2012. The unemployment rate for the Fargo-Moorhead MSA is about 4.7 percent, almost half the national unemployment rate of 8.5 percent during the recession.\n\nMajor employers in town are Microsoft, Hitachi, John Deere, and Tech Mahindra, which set up operations last year. John Deere continues its expansion efforts with a new, $20 million, 90,000-square-foot facility that opened in 2012. Horsch Anderson, a South Dakota company that manufactures agricultural equipment, will build an 110,000-square-foot manufacturing facility in Fargo, investing about $12.5 million and creating 80 jobs. With a combined enrollment of about 30,000 students, the three higher-education institutions in the area — North Dakota State University, Minnesota State University-Moorehead, and Concordia College — work with the private sector to create specific training programs for students who are interested in working in these industries.\n\nThe recent addition of an American Airlines flight between Fargo and Dallas/Fort Worth has created better access to both national and international destinations, which improves Fargo's competitiveness as a place to do business. Direct flight options from Fargo include Chicago, Dallas, Denver, Las Vegas, Los Angeles, Minneapolis-St. Paul, Orlando-Sanford, Phoenix-Mesa, and Salt Lake City.\n\n3.\n\nFramingham (NECTA DIVISION)\n\nMA\n\n263,875\n\n9\n\nFounded in 1700 about 20 miles from Boston, Framingham is a thriving, diverse community that is frequently recognized for its high quality of life and well educated work force. Money magazine ranked it 36th among the top 100 small cities in its \"2012 Best Places to Live\" study.\n\nFramingham is the world headquarters for big companies like TJX, Staples, Cumberland Farms/Gulf, and Bose Corporation. Advanced manufacturing and biotechnology are both growing fields. Framingham State University (FSU) and Mass Bay Community College are active partners with the business community and strive to have their programs meet local work force needs. FSU is also expanding its science and technology programs to meet the growing demand for biotechnology workers.\n\nAccording to the MetroWest Economic Research Center at Framingham State University, combining the city's highly skilled, technology-savvy work force with plentiful high-wage jobs and low unemployment has resulted in \"households with incomes substantially above state and national averages.\"\n\n4.\n\nCorpus Christi\n\nTX\n\n428,185\n\n1\n\n5.\n\nFort Collins-Loveland\n\nCO\n\n299,630\n\n20\n\n6.\n\nWaco\n\nTX\n\n234,906\n\n22\n\n7.\n\nHolland-Grand Haven\n\nMI\n\n263,801\n\n23\n\nOver the last two years the Lakeshore Region of Michigan has generated $41 million in industrial investment, creating 96 jobs and retaining 2,662 jobs. This region, which is anchored by Holland and Grand Haven, continues to outpace both the Midwest and the nation in sales growth. Over 77 percent of the region reported sales gains, compared to 59 percent for the Midwest and 57 percent for the U.S.\n\nAccording to \"Michigan's Urban and Metropolitan Strategy\" by the Brookings Institution, over 86 percent of regional companies have introduced new products in the past five years, compared to 81 percent for the Midwest and 78 percent for the nation as a whole. The Greater Holland area places second in Michigan for the number of patent applications per capita, nearly twice the national average.\n\nHolland development projects include Energetyx ($15 million, 500 jobs), Haworth ($10 million, 450 jobs), Johnson Controls-Saft ($220 million, 450 jobs), and Lean Logistics ($3.3 million, 580 jobs). Energetyx uses composite material technology to manufacture windmill blades for wind energy installations. LG Chem, a South Korea-based advanced battery manufacturer, plans to produce its first lithium-ion cells for the automotive industry from its $300 million factory in Holland this year.\n\n8.\n\nSanta Rosa-Petaluma\n\nCA\n\n483,878\n\n30\n\nLocated in the heart of wine country, Santa Rosa is the county seat of Sonoma County. About 35 miles to the south is Petaluma. Key industries in Santa Rosa include tourism, healthcare (Kaiser Permanente, St. Joseph Health System), and high technology (Agilent Technologies, Medtronic). About half of Petaluma's 30,000 residents are employed in the services sector, especially finance, insurance, and real estate.\n\nPetaluma also has several important manufacturing sectors. The food-processing industry employs about 2,600 workers who produce organic or natural food products, wine, and beer. Major employers are Amy's Kitchen, Clover-Stornetta, Petaluma Poultry, Cowgirl Creamery, Straus Dairy, Barbara's Bakery, and Alvarado Street Bakers. There is also a growing information and computer technology cluster, including telecommunications device manufacturers and software developers. Major employers include Cyan Optics and Calix Inc.\n\nFrom March 2012 to March 2013 these and other employers in Sonoma County added 7,000 new jobs — the highest year-over-year increase since 2000–2001. The biggest gains were realized in trade, transportation, utilities, hospitality, healthcare, and construction.\n\n9.\n\nTyler\n\nTX\n\n209,714\n\n31\n\n10.\n\nBurlington-South Burlington (NECTA)\n\nVT\n\n198,627\n\n32\n\nBurlington-South Burlington is located on the eastern shore of Lake Champlain. Major industries include financial services, education, healthcare, advanced manufacturing, and tourism. Corporate headquarters include Ben & Jerry's, Bruegger's, Burton Snowboards, Dealer.com, and Seventh Generation. Two of the city's largest employers are Fletcher Allen Health Care and the University of Vermont.\n\nHigh-tech R&D is a key part of the local economy. Dynapower Corporation, an international leader in transformer technology, operates a 150,000-square-foot, state-of-the-art facility. GE Healthcare develops medical software at its operations in South Burlington. The armament and technical products division of General Dynamics in Burlington designs, tests, and evaluates armament systems and vehicle survivability products. The U.S. Department of Homeland Security also has an office in town.\n\nBurlington's reputation for high quality of life has attracted the first Trader Joe's to the state of Vermont. The city is busy with plans to invigorate its downtown with a \"smart growth\" infill redevelopment plan and will use tax increment financing to provide some of the public infrastructure needed for the new city center.\n\n11.\n\nDurham-Chapel Hill\n\nNC\n\n504,357\n\n35\n\n12.\n\nBellingham\n\nWA\n\n201,140\n\n37\n\nLocated about 90 miles north of Seattle, Bellingham was ranked in 2012 as the 56th \"Best Small City in America for Business and Careers\" by Forbes magazine. The city continues to invest in itself, including a $106 million plan to redevelop its waterfront. Major industries include healthcare, agribusiness, and manufacturing.\n\nTop manufacturing firms include Heath Tecna, a global supplier of interior products for the passenger aircraft industry. In March, Qantas Airways installed the company's FAA-certified overhead pivot bin system on some of its Boeing 737s — creating overhead bin space that is easier and safer to access. Also headquartered in Bellingham is Brooks Manufacturing, a leading provider of crossarms and other transmission framing components for the utility industry. Another global company in town is Krause Manufacturing, which designs, fabricates, and installs recycling facilities around the world.\n\nSeveral excellent postsecondary educational institutions — Whatcom Community College, Bellingham Technical College, Northwest Indian College, Trinity Western College, and Western Washington University — work with local industries to provide the highly skilled workers that they need.\n\n13.\n\nBoulder\n\nCO\n\n294,567\n\n38\n\nBoulder has a lot going for it — not only does it nestle up to the Rocky Mountains, it scores well for quality of life, robust education, and economic diversity. Key industries include information and communications technology, aerospace, biotechnology, data storage, energy, photonics, and advanced manufacturing. Major companies are Cisco, GE, Google, Lockheed Martin, Merck, IBM, Northrop Grumman, and Ball Aerospace — which just completed a 90,000-square-foot, $75 million expansion that doubles its capacity to design, test, and ship satellites and other equipment.\n\nHigh-tech companies are attracted to Boulder because of the well-educated work force (University of Colorado-Boulder and Naropa University) and the abundance of high-level research institutes. These include the Cooperative Institute for Research in Environmental Sciences, National Center for Atmospheric Research, National Institute of Standards and Technology, and the Earth System Research Laboratory.\n\nThe combination of world-class research, innovative private-sector companies, public-private partnerships, and successful commercialization of new discoveries has fostered a culture of innovation that attracts venture capital investment. According to a recent report by PricewaterhouseCoopers/Venture Economics, over the last five years nearly $1 billion has been invested in the Boulder area by VC firms.\n\n14.\n\nSpringfield\n\nIL\n\n210,170\n\n40\n\n15.\n\nSanta Barbara-Santa Maria-Goleta\n\nCA\n\n423,895\n\n41\n\n16.\n\nProvo-Orem\n\nUT\n\n526,810\n\n42\n\n17.\n\nAnn Arbor\n\nMI\n\n344,791\n\n44\n\n18.\n\nSioux Falls\n\nSD\n\n228,261\n\n46\n\n19.\n\nLincoln\n\nNE\n\n302,157\n\n47\n\n20.\n\nAmarillo\n\nTX\n\n249,881\n\n49\n\n21.\n\nAppleton\n\nWI\n\n225,666\n\n53\n\n22.\n\nColumbus\n\nGA-AL\n\n294,865\n\n54\n\nLocated in the Chattahoochee Valley about 100 miles south of Atlanta, Columbus is the third-largest city in Georgia. With Fort Benning located just to the southeast, Columbus is a busy military town. When the populations of Alabama cities Auburn and Opelika are added to form the Columbus MSA, the work force swells to nearly 300,000. Many of these highly skilled workers are former soldiers who are in high demand because of their excellent training, discipline, and strong work ethic.\n\nKey industries in Columbus are insurance, food processing, warehousing and logistics, and manufacturing. Companies with major operations in Columbus include Aflac, Blue Cross/Blue Shield, NCR, W.C. Bradley Company, and Synovus.\n\nLocal corporations have made more than $2 billion in investments over the last five years — especially in the automotive sector. Kia Motors, which generates an annual economic impact of about $4 billion for the community, recently completed a $100 million expansion that will boost manufacturing capacity by about 20 percent. Pratt and Whitney's Columbus Engine Center is a major part of its global large commercial engine maintenance, repair, and operations (MRO) network. Exide Technologies, which manufactures advanced batteries for the automobile industry, is also expanding and will create 100 new jobs by the end of 2013.\n\n23.\n\nFayetteville-Springdale-Rogers\n\nAR-MO\n\n463,204\n\n56\n\n24.\n\nLafayette\n\nIN\n\n201,789\n\n56\n\n25.\n\nHouma-Bayou Cane-Thibodaux\n\nLA\n\n208,178\n\n57\n\nThis 200,000-person MSA is in the heart of Bayou Country, along the Gulf of Mexico in southern Louisiana. It covers two parishes — Lafourche and its parish seat of Thibodaux, and Terrebonne with its main cities of Houma and Bayou Cane.\n\nBoth natural waterways and industrial channels provide easy shipping access from the Gulf of Mexico to these cities. This inland port system is well-developed enough to service both heavy manufacturing and the oil and gas industries; key intermodal centers are nearby, as well as easy access to all six of North America's Class I railroads.\n\nTop industries for Houma-Bayou Cane-Thibodaux include oil and gas, metal manufacturing, food manufacturing, plastics, medical, seafood, agriculture, biofuels, and professional services. Over the years, this MSA has ranked consistently as one of the strongest economic regions in the U.S., thanks to its natural resources, low business costs, and highly skilled work force. The unemployment rate is about 4 percent — about the same as it was during the Great Recession.\n\n26.\n\nAnchorage\n\nAK\n\n380,821\n\n64\n\n27.\n\nLongview\n\nTX\n\n214,369\n\n67\n\n28.\n\nWaterloo-Cedar Falls\n\nIA\n\n167,819\n\n68\n\n29.\n\nOgden-Clearfield\n\nUT\n\n547,184\n\n70\n\n30.\n\nKilleen-Temple-Fort Hood\n\nTX\n\n405,300\n\n72\n\n31.\n\nSan Luis Obispo-Paso Robles\n\nCA\n\n269,637\n\n74\n\n32.\n\nMadison\n\nWI\n\n568,593\n\n75\n\n33\n\nLubbock\n\nTX\n\n284,890\n\n76\n\n34.\n\nColumbia\n\nMO\n\n172,786\n\n79\n\n35.\n\nRochester\n\nMN\n\n186,011\n\n81\n\n36.\n\nCanton-Massillon\n\nOH\n\n404,422\n\n83\n\n37.\n\nBeaumont-Port Arthur\n\nTX\n\n388,745\n\n84\n\n38.\n\nChattanooga\n\nTN-GA\n\n528,143\n\n86\n\n39.\n\nClarksville\n\nTN-KY\n\n273,949\n\n87\n\n40.\n\nDes Moines-West Des Moines\n\nIA\n\n569,633\n\n90\n\n41.\n\nLake Charles\n\nLA\n\n199,607\n\n90\n\n42.\n\nCollege Station-Bryan\n\nTX\n\n228,660\n\n93\n\n43.\n\nNaples-Marco Island\n\nFL\n\n321,520\n\n94\n\n44.\n\nBarnstable Town (NECTA)\n\nMA\n\n239,675\n\n96\n\n45.\n\nOshkosh-Neenah\n\nWI\n\n166,994\n\n97\n\n46.\n\nMonroe\n\nLA\n\n176,441\n\n99\n\n47.\n\nAbilene\n\nTX\n\n165,252\n\n100\n\n48.\n\nGainesville\n\nGA\n\n179,684\n\n103\n\n49.\n\nJacksonville\n\nNC\n\n177,772\n\n105\n\n50.\n\nRedding\n\nCA\n\n177,223\n\n106\n\nCity\n\nState\n\n2010\n\nPopulation\n\nOverall\n\nRank\n\n1.\n\nColumbus\n\nIN\n\n76,794\n\n3\n\nColumbus is known for its manufacturing expertise and engineering strengths. Fortune 200 diesel-engine–maker Cummins Inc. is headquartered here, employing more than 7,000 workers. The city is also a national leader in foreign direct investment — 21 Japanese companies, including NTN, Enkei, and Toyota Industrial Equipment, employ nearly 5,000 workers. Toyota Material Handling USA recently announced it would relocate its headquarters from California to Columbus. Other global companies with an R&D presence in town include Faurecia (emission control systems) and child safety seat manufacturer Dorel Juvenile Group.\n\nLocal employers draw from a 35-mile commuting population of 1.7 million and an 884,000-person labor force. With 35 percent of local employment tied directly to manufacturing, the one-county MSA is among the top 3 percent of all counties for manufacturing strength and has more mechanical engineers per worker than any other U.S. city.\n\nColumbus ranked fourth in the nation for its GDP growth in 2010 and fifth highest in 2011 among all U.S. metros, according to the U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis. Columbus has averaged one expansion announcement per month since 2010, resulting in more than 1,800 direct jobs and $170 million in capital investments. Among the newest additions is the Phoenix Group, which has selected Columbus for a $150 million, 468,000-square-foot distribution facility.\n\n2.\n\nOdessa\n\nTX\n\n137,130\n\n4\n\nLocated in the energy-rich Permian Basin, Odessa's economy is fueled by oil and gas — especially from unconventional shale plays. Oil and gas companies include Halliburton, Weatherford CPS, and Holloman Construction. Recent announcements include Chevron's plans to build a $100 million campus and Pioneer Natural Resources' plans for a $50 million office building.\n\nThe University of Texas of the Permian Basin, the Texas Tech University Health Sciences Center, and Odessa College all play important roles in expanding the energy and healthcare sectors in Odessa, including research into wind, solar, clean coal, and nuclear energy technologies.\n\nIn 2012 Odessa placed 95th on Forbes list of the best small places for business and careers. Although the Odessa economy grew at the torrid pace of 14.4 percent in 2012, the growth rate is expected to be closer to 6 percent this year. The improved economy has stimulated a number of construction projects in the city, including three new elementary schools, $68 million in capital improvements, and new science and nursing buildings at the University of Texas of the Permian Basin; a new engineering building is also being discussed.\n\n3.\n\nFairbanks\n\nAK\n\n97,581\n\n6\n\n4.\n\nCasper\n\nWY\n\n75,450\n\n8\n\n5.\n\nBismarck\n\nND\n\n108,779\n\n11\n\nAccording to a recent \"Enterprising States\" report by the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, North Dakota placed first for economic performance based on exports, business climate, talent pipeline, infrastructure, innovation, and high-tech job growth. A big contributor to these positive numbers was the capital city of Bismarck.\n\nForbes magazine placed Bismarck third on its list of the top-100 \"Best Small Places for Business and Careers\" in 2012. The city scored especially well for education and job growth. Academic institutions like Bismarck State College work with businesses to develop a local work force that meets their employment needs.\n\nThe state government is Bismarck's largest employer, with more than 4,300 workers, followed by healthcare and education. Other industries include coal, natural gas, food and food products, and heavy equipment. In May 2013 Bobcat Company broke ground on its new $20 million Acceleration Center, which will be a high-tech facility for designing and testing new products. About 140 new jobs will be created, including research and development teams, prototype and design engineers, and manufacturing technicians.\n\n6.\n\nMidland\n\nTX\n\n136,872\n\n12\n\nAccording to the United States Census Bureau, the fastest-growing metropolitan area in the country is Midland, with a 4.6 percent increase in population between July 2011 and July 2012. Located 300 miles west of Dallas, Midland is in the Permian Basin, where deep horizontal drilling has created another oil and gas rush.\n\nWith a booming energy economy, plans are under way for the \"Energy Tower\" — a 53-story skyscraper that will be the sixth-tallest building in Texas and include offices, residential space, shopping, dining, and a five-star hotel. Midland will also be the headquarters for XCOR Aerospace's new commercial spaceflight and R&D center. XCOR manufactures reusable rocket engines for major aerospace prime contractors and is the designer, manufacturer, and operator of the Lynx, a fully reusable, high-performance suborbital space vehicle that is designed to safely carry two persons or scientific experiments to the edge of space and back.\n\n\"XCOR's Research and Development Center headquarters will add economic diversity to Midland, along with $12 million in new payroll and capital investment over the next five years and an estimated average annual wage of over $60,000 per job,\" says Laura Roman, chairman of the Midland Development Corporation.\n\n7.\n\nDubuque\n\nIA\n\n93,653\n\n14\n\nLocated along the Mississippi River at the intersection of Iowa, Wisconsin, and Illinois, Dubuque has a long history of manufacturing. Products include heavy equipment, windows and doors, furniture, plumbing, and metal products. Leading companies are Deere and Company, Eagle Window and Door, A.Y. McDonald Manufacturing Company, and Flexsteel Industries. Other growing employment sectors are education, book publication, healthcare, and financial services. IBM, which provides technology services, employs about 1,300 Dubuque-area residents.\n\nManufacturing continues to surge. Last year, Behnke Enterprises announced plans for a $1.5 million expansion that will increase its capacity for manufacturing agricultural and industrial trailers. Camoplast Solideal, a company that manufactures complete track systems for the agricultural industry, will undertake a $3.4 million facility expansion project in nearby Peosta. The Greater Dubuque Development Corporation led the way in coordinating local/statewide support for the expansion, including tax increment financing (TIF) and assistance from the Iowa Economic Development Authority.\n\nThis history of public-private partnership has led to a strong education system and a highly skilled work force. It is also a reason why Dubuque was named one of America's Promise Alliance's \"100 Best Communities for Young People\" in 2012 — the fifth time it has won this award.\n\n8.\n\nElizabethtown\n\nKY\n\n119,736\n\n18\n\nRanked as the 57th-best place in the country for business and careers in 2012 by Forbes, Elizabethtown's economy is anchored by manufacturing and the nearby military base at Fort Knox. The Elizabethtown MSA, which includes all of Hardin and LaRue counties, has a total population of about 155,000. The GDP in the Elizabethtown MSA grew by 6.1 percent in 2011, placing it 11th out of 366 metros in the U.S. It three-year GDP growth rate from 2008–2011 was an impressive 30 percent — best in the state.\n\nManufacturing industries include plastics and automotive. Akebono Brake, one of the world's top manufacturers of brake noise, vibration, and harshness (NVH) control systems for the automotive industry, located its North American headquarters in Elizabethtown. Another major employer, Metalsa Structural Products, makes frames for Ford F-150 and plans to undertake a $72 million expansion of its Elizabethtown operations.\n\nIn 2011 Elizabethtown landed India-based Flex Films, a plastics company that makes polyester film for packaging. Its new plant, which started production in January 2013, is the company's first operation in the U.S. Its output of biaxially-oriented polyester (BoPET) film will be the largest of any plastics company in the country.\n\n9.\n\nCheyenne\n\nWY\n\n91,738\n\n26\n\nCheyenne, Wyoming's capital city, anchors the north end of the Front Range Urban Corridor. Key economic forces for the city are the nearby F.E. Warren Air Force and the Burlington Northern Santa Fe and Union Pacific railroads. The larger Cheyenne MSA has a population of about 130,000 people. A well-developed education system, including skills-specific training programs at Laramie County Community College, the University of Wyoming, and Colorado State University, provides a well-trained workforce for local businesses. Leading employers are Sierra Trading Post (600 employees) and Lowe's Companies (500).\n\nKey industries in Cheyenne are defense, energy, transportation, warehousing and distribution, and manufacturing. Two business parks — Cheyenne Business Parkway and North Range Business Park — provide state-of-the-art facilities for both start-up and established businesses. Manufacturing continues to grow — for example, in January 2013, California-based Searing Industries announced it would locate a new 200,000-square-foot-manufacturing facility in Cheyenne to produce welded steel tubing.\n\nA pro-business environment, low taxes, and solid work force are some of the reasons Cheyenne ranked 60th in the 2012 \"Top-100 Best Small Cities for Business and Careers\" survey by Forbes.\n\n10.\n\nState College\n\nPA\n\n153,990\n\n33\n\n11.\n\nTexarkana\n\nAK\n\n279,771\n\n34\n\n12.\n\nSan Angelo\n\nTX\n\n111,823\n\n36\n\n13.\n\nAmes\n\nIA\n\n89,542\n\n43\n\n14.\n\nLa Crosse\n\nWI-MN\n\n133,665\n\n52\n\n15.\n\nVictoria\n\nTX\n\n115,384\n\n59\n\n16.\n\nSandusky\n\nOH\n\n77,079\n\n61\n\nLocated between Cleveland and Toledo on Lake Erie, Sandusky is the county seat of Erie County with an MSA population of about 115,000. The city also has one of the best-protected harbors on the Great Lakes and one of the largest coal ports — two big reasons it has a long, successful history of shipping and heavy manufacturing.\n\nKey economic sectors include foundries, automotive parts, metal fabricating, construction products, plastics and vinyl products, colorants, paints, and food processing equipment. Top companies in the area include JBT Corporation (conveyors), U.S. Tsubaki (chains), and Sandusky International (papermaking machinery).\n\nPeople are surprised to learn about Sandusky's role in space exploration. The city is home to Glenn Research Center's Plum Brook Station, which supported rocket-engine development for NASA's Mercury, Gemini, and Apollo space missions. Today Plum Brook operates the world's largest deep-space simulation chamber, which tested the landing system for the Mars Rover. The chamber is currently being used by SpaceX, a private space flight company, and NASA plans to test its Orion spacecraft here in 2016-2017.\n\n17.\n\nMorgantown\n\nWV\n\n366,513\n\n63\n\nAccording to the Milken Institute, Morgantown was the second-best performing small city in 2012. For the same year, Forbes ranked Morgantown seventh on its top-10 list of the \"Best Cities for Business and Careers.\"\n\nThe Morgantown MSA provides a small-town atmosphere and lifestyle, with big city advantages. Morgantown is the home of West Virginia University (WVU), one of the leading research universities in the country.\n\nMorgantown is growing its healthcare and high-tech sectors by anchoring the \"I-79 High Tech Corridor.\" Recent developments along the corridor include Morgantown's National Energy Technology Laboratory, Center for Entrepreneurial Studies and Development, National Biometric Security Center, National Research Center for Coal and Energy, and the Software Engineering Research Center.\n\nAccording to a March 2012 report by the WVU Bureau of Business and Economic Research, the Morgantown MSA is the \"most balanced and dynamic metropolitan economy in the state\" with a job-growth rate that is expected to average 1.8 percent per year during the next five years.\n\n18.\n\nIowa City\n\nIA\n\n152,586\n\n64\n\n19.\n\nIthaca\n\nNY\n\n101,564\n\n66\n\n20.\n\nHinesville-Fort Stewart\n\nGA\n\n77,917\n\n69\n\n21.\n\nLewiston\n\nID-WA\n\n60,888\n\n71\n\n22.\n\nMount Vernon-Anacortes\n\nWA\n\n116,901\n\n77\n\n23.\n\nPocatello\n\nID\n\n90,656\n\n82\n\n24.\n\nCorvallis\n\nOR\n\n85,579\n\n95\n\n25.\n\nSt. Joseph\n\nMO-KS\n\n127,329\n\n101\n\n26.\n\nLogan\n\nUT-ID\n\n125,442\n\n104\n\n27.\n\nJefferson City\n\nMO\n\n149,807\n\n114\n\n28.\n\nBillings\n\nMT\n\n158,050\n\n124\n\n29.\n\nOcean City\n\nNJ\n\n97,265\n\n125\n\n30.\n\nWilliamsport\n\nPA\n\n116,111\n\n126\n\n31.\n\nJackson\n\nTN\n\n115,425\n\n127\n\n32.\n\nJonesboro\n\nAR\n\n121,026\n\n131\n\n33.\n\nLawton\n\nOK\n\n124,098\n\n133\n\n34.\n\nRapid City\n\nSD\n\n126,382\n\n135\n\n35.\n\nAuburn-Opelika\n\nAL\n\n140,247\n\n139\n\n36.\n\nHarrisonburg\n\nVA\n\n125,228\n\n140\n\n37.\n\nFlorence-Muscle Shoals\n\nAL\n\n147,137\n\n141\n\n38.\n\nOwensboro\n\nKY\n\n114,752\n\n124\n\n39.\n\nLima\n\nOH\n\n106,331\n\n149\n\n40.\n\nHattiesburg\n\nMS\n\n142,842\n\n150\n\n41.\n\nGrand Forks\n\nND-MN\n\n98,461\n\n153\n\n42.\n\nIdaho Falls\n\nID\n\n130,374\n\n161\n\n43.\n\nMissoula\n\nMT\n\n109,299\n\n163\n\n44.\n\nCoeur d'Alene\n\nID\n\n138,494\n\n171\n\n45.\n\nFond du Lac\n\nWI\n\n101,633\n\n172\n\n46.\n\nBend\n\nOR\n\n157,733\n\n176\n\n47.\n\nFlagstaff\n\nAZ\n\n134,421\n\n179\n\n48.\n\nWichita Falls\n\nTX\n\n151,306\n\n183\n\n49.\n\nSanta Fe\n\nNM\n\n144,170\n\n187\n\n50.\n\nNapa\n\nCA\n\n136,484\n\n192\n\nRELATED TOPICS AND ARTICLES"
