        "text": "See also: Mayoral election in Anchorage, Alaska (2024)\n\nSuzanne LaFrance won the nonpartisan general runoff election for mayor of Anchorage, Alaska, on May 14, 2024. LaFrance defeated incumbent David Bronson, 53.5% to 46.5%.\n\nBronson and LaFrance advanced to the runoff from the nonpartisan general election on April 2. LaFrance received 36.3% of the vote and Bronson received 35.0%. The two advanced to a runoff because neither received more than 45% of the vote.\n\nLaFrance was a former member of the Anchorage Assembly and chaired the Assembly during the first two years of Bronson's term.[2] LaFrance said she was running to \"bring people together and get our future back on track.\" LaFrance said her business experience and time on the assembly gave her the necessary knowledge and skillset to turn Anchorage around.[3] LaFrance said she would be a more effective mayor than Bronson: \"My pitch is that we can get the basics right, and we can build a better future for everyone in our community.\"[4]\n\nFirst elected in 2021, Bronson ran on his first-term record. Bronson said he opposed the Anchorage Assembly's efforts to increase tax and spending rates and worked to reopen the city following the COVID-19 pandemic.[5] Bronson said he had the \"relentless commitment, vision, and a whole lot of heart\" needed for the office.[6] Bronson said he would act as a more effective check on the Assembly than LaFrance: \"My administration is standing between single party governance in the city...and the balance that we need within our government.\"[7]\n\nAlthough the election was nonpartisan, Bronson was a registered Republican and LaFrance was a registered nonpartisan. The Alaska Republican Party endorsed Bronson and the Alaska Democratic Party endorsed LaFrance.[8][9]\n\nAs of April 2024, 63 mayors in the 100 largest cities by population were affiliated with the Democratic Party, 25 were affiliated with the Republican Party, one was affiliated with the Libertarian Party, four were independents, five identified as nonpartisan or unaffiliated, and two had unknown partisan affiliations.\n\nAnchorage has term limits for the position of mayor. Those limits are: Two consecutive three-year terms, may run again after a three year break.\n\nSee also: Mayoral election in Baltimore, Maryland, 2024 (May 14 Democratic primary)\n\nIncumbent Brandon Scott (D) won the Democratic primary for mayor of Baltimore, Maryland, on May 14, 2024. Scott received 51.1% of the vote. Sheila Dixon (D) finished in second place with 41.1%. Wayne Baker (D), Wendy Bozel (D), Texas Brown (D), Kevin P. Harris (D), Wendell Hill-Freeman (D), Yolanda Pulley (D), Joseph Scott (D), Keith Scott (D), Thiru Vignarajah (D), Bob Wallace (D) and Yasaun Young (D) also ran in the primary. Scott, Dixon, and Wallace led in fundraising and local media attention.\n\nLocal political observers said crime was a central issue for both the Scott and Dixon campaigns.\n\nAccording to the Baltimore Sun, Dixon was likely to focus her campaign on a similar section of the electorate as in 2020, which it described as \"Black voters, many of whom named crime as their top concern.\"[10] Dixon said her policies as mayor \"led to 30-year record lows in crime and homicides.\"[11] Scott's challenge was \"more complicated that [sic] lowering the homicide rate. The battle is also over the public perception of crime among city residents, some of whom find little solace in the city’s diminished homicide count,\" according to the Baltimore Sun.[10]\n\nScott was first elected in 2020 and was running on his record: \"We have been able to decrease crime by doing it the right way.\"[10] Scott said he offered \"a choice to make about whether we will continue on the sustainable path forward, or if we will go back to the broken ways and failed leadership of the past.\"[12]\n\nDixon was a former mayor and city council member who resigned in 2010 as part of a plea deal following a corruption investigation.[13] Dixon said she was running because Scott was mismanaging the city: \"I look at city government today, and I don't recognize it anymore. I see firsthand that it's letting people down daily.\"[14] In 2020, Scott defeated Dixon 29.6%–27.5% in the Democratic primary.\n\nWallace was, at the time of the election, a businessman and author of books on wealth creation and entrepreneurship.[15] Wallace said he was running because \"today's Baltimore presents challenges for our Black sons and daughters.\"[16] Wallace said he would create the position of city manager/chief ethics officer, pursue partnerships with businesses to attract $1 billion of investment, and overhaul the city's schools.[17] In 2020, Wallace ran for mayor as an independent. Scott defeated him 70.5%–20.2%.\n\nThe last Republican mayor of Baltimore was Theodore McKeldin (R) in 1967.[18]\n\nSee also: Mayoral election in Las Vegas, Nevada (2024)\n\nThirteen candidates ran in the nonpartisan primary for Las Vegas mayor on June 11, 2024. Shelley Berkley and Victoria Seaman were the top two vote-getters, and they advanced to a general election scheduled for November 5, 2024, because no candidate received a majority of the vote.\n\nThroughout the race, Berkley, Seaman, and Cedric Crear led in polling, media coverage, and fundraising.[19][20][21]\n\nIncumbent Carolyn Goodman, who was first elected in 2011, was term-limited. Goodman's husband, Oscar, served as Las Vegas mayor from 1999 to 2011.[22] Goodman was one of eight mayors in the 100 largest cities by population registered as nonpartisan or independent.\n\nThe mayor sits on the Las Vegas City Council and is the only member elected at large. The mayor presides over council meetings and official city ceremonies. KTNV Channel 13 Senior Reporter Steve Sebelius said, \"The importance [is in] this bully pulpit role of the mayor.\"[23]\n\nBerkeley represented Nevada's 1st Congressional District as a Democrat from 1999 to 2013. Before that, she practiced law and served in the Nevada Assembly from 1982 to 1984.[24] Berkeley said, \"[Las Vegas] is the fastest growing community in the United States, and it certainly was when I was in Congress representing Las Vegas. So many of the issues that I concentrated on when I was in Congress are still important issues today.\"[25] Berkeley said her campaign was focused on affordable housing, homelessness, and small businesses.[25]\n\nAt the time of the election, Crear had represented Ward 5 on the Las Vegas City Council since 2018. Before that, he served as a Las Vegas Planning Commissioner and was a member of the Nevada System of Higher Education Board of Regents.[26] Crear said, \"The number one issue in our city is public safety. We have to continue to keep our community safe. I work with three area commands now — Bolden Area Command, Downtown Area Command, Northwest Area Command — and we have to ensure our residents have a sound quality of life, that our neighborhoods are safe, and people feel comfortable going out of their homes and participating in our community.\"[27] Crear said he was also running on homelessness and workforce development.[28]\n\nAt the time of the election, Seaman had represented Ward 2 on the Las Vegas City Council since 2019. From 2014 to 2016, Seaman served as a Republican in the Nevada Assembly, representing District 34. Seaman said, \"I have a keen ability to recognize and face head-on complicated issues that impact our residents. It is for this reason and my commitment for this city that I live in — and the support of my family — that I’m announcing my campaign for mayor of Las Vegas.”[29] Seaman's top issues included public safety, infrastructure, and supporting local businesses.[30]\n\nKola Akingbade, Tera Anderson, Lynn Baird, Dan Chapman, Irina Hansen, Kara Jenkins, Eric Medlin, Donna Miller, Michael Pacino, Deb Peck, and William Walls also ran in the election. Baird and Jenkins completed Ballotpedia's Candidate Connection survey. Click here to read their responses.\n\nThe city of Las Vegas does not include the Strip, which is in an unincorporated part of Clark County.[31] Clark County and Las Vegas share a police department and other municipal services.[31]\n\nThirty-four of the 100 largest cities are holding mayoral elections in 2024.[32] Heading into the year, 18 of those cities had a Democratic mayor, meaning 29% of the 63 Democratic-led cities are holding mayoral elections. Eleven cities holding elections had a Republican mayor at the start of the year, meaning 42% of the 26 Republican-led cities are holding elections. The remaining eight top-100 cities holding elections in 2024 started the year with independent or nonpartisan mayors.\n\nLas Vegas has term limits for the position of mayor. Those limits are: four-year term, 12 year lifetime limit.\n\nSee also: Cook County State's Attorney election, 2024 (March 19 Democratic primary)\n\nEileen O'Neill Burke (D) defeated Clayton Harris III (D) in the Democratic primary for Cook County State's Attorney on March 19, 2024. O'Neill Burke received 50.1% of the vote to Harris' 49.9%.\n\nIncumbent Kim Foxx (D) did not seek re-election. Foxx was first elected in 2016. Both Harris and O'Neill Burke said they would build on Foxx's policies while improving the relationship between prosecutors and police.\n\nHarris was a former prosecutor and state government staff manager who, at the time of the election, taught state and local government policy, including policing, at the University of Chicago.[34] Harris ran on his experience, saying he would be \"the bridge, the evolution of what has been going on and we’re going to move forward to ensure that our communities feel safe.\"[35] Harris said he would add a division to the special prosecutors unit that would focus on firearms, carjackings, and retail theft.\n\nO'Neill Burke was a former prosecutor, defense attorney, and judge. O'Neill Burke said she had more courtroom experience and more experience in mentorship owing to her time running training programs for new judges.[36][37] O'Neill Burke said she was running because of crime rates: \"make no mistake about it, the economic viability of Chicago is on the ballot this year.\" O'Neill Burke said she would end Foxx's policy of prohibiting prosecution of retail theft less than $1,000.\n\nO'Neill Burke advanced to the general election against Bob Fioretti (R) and Andrew Charles Kopinski (L). Democrats had, at the time of the election, won every election for Cook County State's Attorney since 1996.[38] Foxx won the 2016 election 72%-28% and the 2020 election 54%-39%.\n\nSee also: Harris County District Attorney election, 2024 (March 5 Democratic primary)\n\nSean Teare (D) defeated incumbent Kim Ogg (D) in the Democratic primary for Harris County District Attorney on March 5, 2024.\n\nOgg was first elected in 2016 on a platform of prosecuting violent offenders, offering diversion programs as an alternative to jail time, and making less use of cash bail.[39] Ogg was running on her record: \"In my seven years as District Attorney, significant reforms have reshaped Harris County's justice system. Despite challenges like Harvey and the pandemic, our office supported 86 law enforcement agencies, ensuring uninterrupted operations.\"[40]\n\nTeare ran because he believed Ogg hadn't fulfilled her campaign promises. Teare said prosecutors' morale was low because Ogg had focused on building her political influence over implementing her policy platform: \"The promises that we were all led to believe in 2016 were not being followed through.\"[41] Harris County Judge Lina Hidalgo (D) and former Houston Mayor Sylvester Turner both endorsed Teare.[42][43]\n\nThe Harris County Democratic Party voted to admonish Ogg on December 13, 2023.[44] The resolution accused Ogg of supporting Republican firearms and sentencing laws, intimidating elected officials with whom she disagreed, and not reducing the use of cash bail as she had promised.[45] Ogg said the county party had admonished her because she was investigating three of County Judge Lina Hidalgo's (D) former staffers.[46]\n\nTeare advanced to the general election against Dan Simons (R). According to Rice University professor Bob Stein, county Republicans saw an opportunity to win back the district attorney's office: \"The cleavage, the fissure, the infighting in the Democratic Party to oust Kim Ogg, I think, has attracted some candidates to run countywide.\"[47] Ogg won the 2016 and 2020 elections 54%-46%. Ogg was the first Democrat to win election as Harris County District Attorney since 1980.[48]\n\nSee also: State attorney election in Hillsborough County, Florida (August 20, 2024 Democratic primary)\n\nElizabeth Martinez Strauss (D) and Andrew Warren (D) are running in the Democratic primary for Hillsborough County State Attorney in Florida on August 20, 2024.\n\nThe primary is taking place after Gov. Ron DeSantis (R) removed Warren from office in August 2022. The governor suspended Warren after Warren signed a pledge not to prosecute crimes related to abortion or gender transitions. In January 2023, a U.S. district court judge ruled that Warren's action was protected under the First Amendment but that the court did not have the power to reinstate Warren. A three-judge panel found in January 2024 that the court did have the power to reinstate Warren and remanded the case to the trial court to determine whether the governor's suspension of Warren had violated his rights.[49] As of June 28, 2024, the trial court had not ruled on whether to reinstate Warren.\n\nStrauss is a defense attorney and former prosecutor. Strauss says she is running because Warren is too risky of a candidate given his past suspension: \"Never make a bet you can't afford to lose. Our county cannot afford to gamble on this election.\"[50] Strauss says she has the broadest experience: \"Those prosecutors don’t have the perspective of having the defense side and most defense lawyers don’t have the perspective of being on the prosecution side, but I do, and I think I should be Tampa’s next State Attorney.\"[51]\n\nWarren is an attorney and former federal prosecutor. Warren was elected state attorney in 2016 and re-elected in 2020. Warren is running on his record: \"In 2020, you re-elected me to serve as your State Attorney because you believed in my vision and it worked. Crime went down 30%...we made Hillsborough the safest large county in Florida. But on August 4, 2022, Ron DeSantis threw out your vote.\"[52] Warren says he is running \"to protect our values, for a woman’s right to choose, for a fair and just system, and above all for freedom and democracy.\"[53]\n\nThe winner of the primary will face incumbent Suzy Lopez (R). In an interview with the Florida Phoenix, political analyst Barry Edwards said the county had shifted politically since Warren's 2020 win, referencing changes in party registration as well as the results of the 2022 elections: \"We’ve seen the performance of the county in 2022 — all the countywide and statewide Democrat candidates got wiped out...the county has changed to a red-performing county.\"[54]\n\nThe Florida Thirteenth Circuit State Attorney is the chief prosecutor for Florida's Thirteenth Judicial Circuit, which includes Hillsborough County and its incorporated cities—including Tampa. As of the 2024 election, the incumbent oversees \"132 Assistant State Attorneys and 160 victim advocates, investigators, administrators, paralegals, receptionists, and other support staff\" with responsibility for prosecution and crime prevention programs.[55]\n\nA state attorney is an official elected to serve as the lead prosecutor for a specific jurisdiction. The office's responsibilities include managing the jurisdiction's prosecutors, setting department-wide guidelines for prosecutors to follow, and direct management of individual high-profile prosecutions. Prosecutors are responsible for deciding whether or not to bring criminal charges when wrongdoing is alleged, as well as for proving the charges in court, if necessary, and for recommending a sentence in the event a defendant is found guilty. This office is equivalent to the positions of district attorney, state's/commonwealth's attorney, county/city attorney, solicitor, circuit attorney, or prosecuting attorney found in other jurisdictions.\n\nSee also: Los Angeles County District Attorney election, 2024\n\nIncumbent George Gascón and Nathan Hochman are running in the general election for Los Angeles County District Attorney on November 5, 2024. Gascón and Hochman were the top two finishers in the nonpartisan primary, receiving 24.4% and 16.4% of the vote, respectively. The two advanced to a general election because neither won more than 50% of the vote.\n\nAccording to LAist, the election is \"expected to be closely watched across the country as a barometer of how the public is feeling about criminal justice reforms amid an increase in property crime. Property crime is up 17.4% in the city of L.A. so far this year compared to two years ago...Violent crime is down 1.3% year to date from two years ago.\"[56]\n\nAlthough the election is nonpartisan, Gascón is a registered Democrat and Hochman is an independent.[57][58]\n\nGascón was elected in 2020 on a platform of not seeking the death penalty, limiting the imposition of cash bail for misdemeanors and nonviolent felonies, and \"stopping the practice of imposing excessive sentences\".[59][60] Gascón says his policies have made county residents safer and he will keep them in place if re-elected: \"The reality is that having thoughtful policies that hold people accountable, as we have, sending people to prison when they need to be locked up, but recognizing that prison cannot be the only one answer is what public safety is all about.\"[61] Gascón previously served eight years as San Francisco District Attorney. He earlier served as chief of police in San Francisco and in Mesa, Arizona.[62]\n\nHochman is a defense attorney and former federal prosecutor.[63] Hochman says Gascón has put his policies ahead of public safety and that Hochman will prioritize public safety and victims' rights over reducing the length of sentences.[64][65] Hochman says Gascón is responsible for \"nine of the most pro-criminal blanket policies in DA history.\"[66] Hochman says his public and private legal experience will help him change the direction of the district attorney's office.[63] Hochman says he will avoid both Gascón's policies and policies centered on expanding incarceration in favor of what he describes as \"the hard middle, which means you look at each individual case, the defendant, the crime committed, and the impact on the victim to determine who the true threats to our safety are, who needs to be behind bars.\"[66]\n\nLocal political observers say Hochman, who ran for attorney general as a Republican in 2022, faces a disadvantage in Los Angeles County, where Democrats have been favored in recent elections.[67] The county voted for Joe Biden (D) over Donald Trump (R) 71%–27% in 2020 and for Rob Bonta (D) over Hochman 67%–33% in the 2022 attorney general election.[68][69] The last Republican elected Los Angeles County District Attorney was Steve Cooley (R) in 2008. Hochman said after the primary that \"three-quarters of Angelenos rejected George Gascón and said enough is enough of playing politics with our communities’ safety...In the general election, I look forward to unifying all those who want to restore safety in their communities, in their streets, parks, subways and neighborhoods.\"[70]"
