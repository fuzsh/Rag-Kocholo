        "text": "Americans commonly refer to US regions like the South or the Midwest in conversation, but we disagree on their borders as often as we mention them. Is DC in the South? Is Kansas City in the Midwest? Is the Mid-Atlantic even a region at all? Ask any ten Americans these questions and you’ll get eleven different answers — at least if my own family is anything to go by. So why do we use these groupings at all? And if we are to use them, is there a better way to define them?\n\nRegionalization — the practice of conceptually dividing a large area up into smaller ones — is omnipresent in media and discourse. By breaking down impossibly complex wholes into smaller, more homogenous actors, regionalization lets us distill differences and trends into narratives we can more easily understand. With regards to the United States, a country of great diversity and deep divisions, this approach is both constant and necessary. The Census Bureau divides the country into four regions and nine smaller divisions, commentators hold forth about “The Rust Belt” or “Red and Blue America,” and journalist Colin Woodard caused a stir with his 2011 bestseller, American Nations, asserting that the country could best be understood as eleven competing nations with distinct historic roots. Do any of these attempts at regionalization, however, have a basis in statistics? Are they merely convention or culture, or can the United States really be split into different areas with significant, objective differences? In order to find out, I decided to do a cluster analysis.\n\nAs I explained in a previous article, clustering is a type of unsupervised learning where an algorithm is used to assign observations to categories which were not previously defined. Simply put, it is using math to sort things into new groups. If there are significant regional variations in the features passed to the clustering algorithm, we can expect cluster boundaries to reflect those differences. If regional variations are insignificant, the distribution of clusters will be more scattered, reflecting divisions like urban vs rural areas more than regional ones. To get a broad dataset covering the entire country, I used county-level datasets on poverty, population, unemployment, income, and education prepared by the USDA’s Economic Research Service. Working with county-level data has some drawbacks — counties vary wildly in population (from fewer than a hundred to over ten million) and in area, with western counties often encompassing large, somewhat arbitrary tracts of land — but counties and county equivalents cover the entire country and are one of few subdivisions of the United States for which data is consistently collected and maintained for all areas equally. Crucially, counties are also FIPS-coded, a standard encoding of unique identifiers for geographic areas. FIPS codes have been used across the federal government to identify states and counties, allowing county-level data to be joined across departments and over time. The county-level data on different subjects provided by the ERS had originated in different departments of the federal government, but thanks to FIPS codes it could be merged into a single dataset after some cleaning. Ultimately, the clustering was based off seven demographic and economic statistics and an eighth statistic, percent in poverty, was cleaned but withheld from the clustering for use later. I won’t go into much technical detail here, but for those interested, I’ve provided some information in a footnote* and the full codebook and data are available on my Github.\n\nSo what were the results? Take a look:\n\nIn spite of passing in no geographic features at all, the eight clusters display remarkable geographic coherence, especially in the eastern part of the country where counties are smaller. Though clusters are intermingled somewhat, it’s clearly visible at first glance that the red cluster 2 dominates the Great Plains, the green cluster 4 cuts diagonally across the Midwest punctuated with spots of orange cluster 1, and northern Appalachia is a swath of yellow cluster 5 terminating at a dense blob of purple cluster 4. Each cluster is defined by its own distinct combination of tendencies, and with a deeper analysis, even more apparently complex areas like the Deep South begin to form clear regional patterns. I’ve prepared a Tableau graphic** and a description for each cluster. Remember that the description applies generally to the cluster and may not perfectly fit with every individual county in it. Without further ado, let’s introduce each of the eight clusters in turn.\n\nCluster 0: Declining Rural\n\nCounties in this cluster have below average education and income, slightly below average employment, and some of the lowest natural increase (the balance of births and deaths) of any cluster. The one positive metric they have is net migration — more people are coming to these counties than are leaving. These largely rural counties make up much of the Deep South, the northern Lower Peninsula of Michigan, northern California and southern Oregon, and the Ozark Plateau. With the influx of newcomers unable to keep up with their negative natural increase, their populations are gradually declining. Virtually none of these counties occur in the Great Plains or the Northeast.\n\nCluster 1: Wealthy Urban\n\nNot all of these counties are urban and many major city centers do not appear among them, but they are the most urban and by far the most densely populated cluster, with a median population over 150,000. These counties are above average in all metrics, but especially stand out for their high level of education and astronomical median household income, in both of which they lead every other cluster. They are most prominent in the Northeast Megalopolis, but also form significant groups in the Bay Area, the Salt Lake City metropolitan area, central Colorado, and metropolitan Minneapolis-Saint Paul. Major cities nationwide are often accompanied by at least one county from this cluster, and they frequently occur in conjunction with cluster 4. Cluster 4 is notably less frequent in the South.\n\nCluster 2: The Heartland\n\nThis cluster dominates the Great Plains and, for some reason, Vermont. Counties in it are heavily rural, surprisingly well educated, and enjoy the highest level of employment of any cluster, but income is barely above average. With natural increase effectively at the average and net migration significantly negative, these counties are seeing their already-small populations shrink as people leave — perhaps to make use of their education somewhere where incomes are higher. Perhaps the most geographically coherent cluster, cluster 2 effectively describes a region practically as-is.\n\nCluster 3: Back Home\n\nCluster 3 is a bit of a statistical oddball. Dominant in west Texas and part of the Gulf Coast and scattered elsewhere, it exhibits absurdly high natural increase — more than half again the next cluster down — but strongly negative net migration. People are leaving these counties at a high rate, but they’re still growing because people are being born even faster. In addition, counties in cluster 3 display very low education, below average income, and slightly above average employment. Many counties in cluster 3 are rural, but it also encompasses some of the most urban counties in the country, including Los Angeles County, Dallas County, Harris County (home of Houston, TX), and Queens, Brooklyn, and the Bronx. This is a prime example of a grouping which is statistically strong, but unlikely to occur to a human analyst without the use of an algorithm.\n\nCluster 4: Sub-Urban\n\nLike cluster 1, the name of this cluster is a broad generalization: some of the counties in it are clearly urban (for instance, Cook County, IL) and others are quite rural, but very generally speaking they have middling populations and sit slightly above average in every metric. The cluster is most concentrated in a swath of the Midwest, but its name references its broader role: counties in cluster 4 aren’t necessarily suburban, but they frequently surround counties in clusters 1 and 7. Look at the three examples below in Greater Atlanta, the Northeast Megalopolis, and the Texas Triangle to see what I mean — the green counties of cluster 4 wreath the orange and pink counties of clusters 1 and 7.\n\nCluster 5: Rust Counties\n\nCluster 5 consists largely of a few different geographically coherent groups of counties with one thing in common: they generally aren’t doing as well as they used to be. Relatively rural, cluster 5 is slightly educated but below average on every other metric, especially natural increase, where it ranks lowest of all the clusters. This cluster contains many former manufacturing areas and others that have lost their principal industries and failed to recover. As a result, cluster 5 is underemployed and losing population. Things are bad, but at least they aren’t as bad as they are in cluster 6.\n\nCluster 6: Historically Deprived\n\nCounties in cluster 6 are rural, concentrated in a few distinct areas, and in extremely rough shape. Below average in every metric and exceptionally below average in most, cluster 6 holds the record for the lowest net migration, education, employment, and income. It’s also afflicted with profound poverty. Unfortunately, the reasons for this are clear: most counties in cluster 6 fall within one of four distinct groups. The first of these, the roughly crescent-shaped grouping down the Mississippi Valley and carving through the Deep South, is the Black Belt — a band of fertile soil which was the epicenter of American slavery. Between chattel slavery, Jim Crow, and systemic racism, these areas have never fully recovered. Below is a comparison of part of cluster 6 with an 1861 map compiled from the 1860 census where counties are shaded according to the percent of the population which is enslaved.\n\nThe other three groups which make up cluster 6 have similar stories. Many of the scattered counties west of the Mississippi correspond directly with Federal Indian Reservations, which have their own history of experiencing discrimination and poverty. Large parts of the Central Valley of California also fall into this cluster. A heavily agricultural region, this area is fairly isolated from the rest of the state and has historically hosted a large Hispanic population, including many transient agricultural workers. The one significant portion of cluster 6 which doesn’t correspond to a minority population is the Appalachian area of eastern Kentucky and part of West Virginia. Former coal country, this beautiful but difficult to develop area never had much industry besides resource extraction, and with the resources gone, it’s alongside the other historically deprived areas in a deep cycle of intergenerational poverty.\n\nCluster 7: Boom Towns\n\nLast but certainly not least is cluster 7 — a fairly populous, urban cluster which sits above average in every metric but is defined above all by its explosive growth. Many of these counties are in the south and west, reflecting the migration of Americans into the Sun Belt and the growth of younger industries and metro areas. Some of the counties in this cluster are unexpectedly small and remote, but a closer look shows that they definitely fit the bill: Williams County, ND may not seem like a “boom town” at first glance, but with the area in the midst of an oil boom, the population has doubled in a decade. Like cluster 1, cluster 7 doesn’t usually define an area on its own but is part of a clear regional ecosystem. In the old-growth areas of the Midwest and Northeast, cluster 7 is virtually nonexistent.\n\nSo what does all of this get us?\n\nA couple things, it turns out. First, we can use the cluster labels to better understand individual counties. Knowing which cluster a county is in gives us a grasp of the basic state of the county at a glance and can enhance predictive modeling (if you aren’t interested in statistical nitty-gritty, feel free to skip the rest of this paragraph). If you’ll recall, earlier I set aside percent in poverty and didn’t pass it into the clustering algorithm. As a result, I can now use the unseen poverty data to check the usefulness of the clusters. A basic linear regression model predicting percent in poverty from just the features passed into the clustering and their interaction terms explains 79% of the variance in the data — when the cluster labels are added to the predictive model, it explains 82% of the variance. The mean squared error similarly improves, dropping from 7.55 to 6.51. Because features interact slightly differently in the different clusters, knowing which cluster a county is in lets us predict the level of poverty with more accuracy. This should hold true for any feature correlated with the features used to create the clustering, and considering the surprising geographic coherence of the clusters, that’s probably quite a few. This clustering could potentially be used to understand regional trends in features like voting habits, aging populations, and the distribution of minority groups.\n\nThe geographic coherence of the clusters gives us their second major benefit: regionalization. The cluster labels not only allow us to better understand individual counties, but also render visible the regional groupings which are usually too complex to easily grasp. While some clusters define regions on their own, others interact in regional systems. There are programmatic ways to define these regional groups, but that’s a topic for another article. For now, here’s a map sketching out the rough regions the clusters form:\n\nIn the northeast, the run of cluster 5 down the Appalachians studded with cities in clusters 4 and 2 is joined by the small clumps of clusters 0, 2, and 6 to form a continuous region of relatively low population. This entire area has experienced various levels of economic decline caused by the failure of older industries. Detached from this Northern Rust zone, the state of Illinois outside of the Chicagoland area shows many of the same characteristics and has therefore been termed the Rust Annex. To the east of the Northern Rust, a complex of counties in cluster 1 wreathed by cluster 4 defines the boundaries of the Northeast Megalopolis. To the west, separating the Northern Rust from the Rust Annex, is the Core Midwest, a zone of relatively prosperous and populated counties in cluster 4 dotted with urban patches of cluster 1 and a bit of rural cluster 0. Separated from the Core Midwest by the Rust Annex is the similar Midwest Annex of northern Missouri and part of Iowa. Bordering all of these areas is the South, a sprawling complex of primarily clusters 0, 4, and 7 from the Ozarks to Florida with the Black Belt forming a swath of cluster 6 through the center. This region, perhaps the most complex of those delineated here, is defined by its stark juxtaposition of recent urban growth and multigenerational rural poverty. Across the Mississippi Valley from the South, a Southern Rust region repeats the formula of cluster 5 dotted with clusters 4 and 2 seen in the Northern Rust, but with incursions of clusters 3 and 7 that mark this region as distinctly different from the depopulating north. The rapidly urbanizing area around Dallas, Houston, Austin, and San Antonio makes up the Texas Triangle, where groups of clusters 3 and 7 are wreathed in cluster 4 in a similar manner to the urban Northeast Megalopolis. A continuous streak of cluster 3 arcs around the Texas Triangle and Southern Rust, making up the arid and heavily hispanic region of West Texas. Covering a vast expanse in the center of the country is the Great Plains, where cluster 2 reigns supreme. Finally, across the Rockies out to the Pacific coast is the West. Not a region in the same sense as the others, the West is more properly the area where counties become so large that county-level regionalization becomes virtually impossible. Individual groups of counties are clearly visible — for instance, the Bay Area in California and the Navajo Nation in Arizona and New Mexico — but with only five counties separating Los Angeles from Salt Lake City, the areas simply aren’t granular enough to form proper regions. One thing is clear throughout the West, though: in among the fruit salad of various clusters, the significant blobs of cluster 1 and high proportion of cluster 7 indicates some wealthy urban areas and a great deal of growth.\n\nConclusions and Next Steps\n\nClustering was able to shed light on individual counties and define some significant groupings which could be used to form regions, but a couple problems surfaced. The large county size in the West I’ve already referred to — this could potentially be addressed by using a more granular unit like census tracts, though doing so would require finding consistent data at that level and effectively starting over from scratch. The second issue is more subtle: because this is census data, it refers only to where people live — not where they work. This is the reason why some of the regions feature complex patterns of clusters like the concentric rings around Dallas and why urban centers can have unexpected classifications. Pittsburgh, Rochester, and Syracuse are urban areas surrounded by a sea of cluster 5 in the Northern Rust, but they themselves are in cluster 2 — more commonly seen on the great plains. In order to better understand these systems of counties and pursue a more programmatic approach to regionalization than “eyeballing it,” I intend to bring in FIPS-coded census data on commuting flows. On its own, that data could be used for network analysis of US counties. In conjunction with the clustering, my hope is that it can further enhance understanding of regions and how counties interact."
