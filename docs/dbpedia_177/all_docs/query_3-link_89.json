        "text": "Social determinants of health (SDOH) have a major impact on people’s health, well-being, and quality of life. Examples of SDOH include:\n\nSafe housing, transportation, and neighborhoods\n\nRacism, discrimination, and violence\n\nEducation, job opportunities, and income\n\nAccess to nutritious foods and physical activity opportunities\n\nPolluted air and water\n\nLanguage and literacy skills\n\nSDOH also contribute to wide health disparities and inequities. For example, people who don't have access to grocery stores with healthy foods are less likely to have good nutrition. That raises their risk of health conditions like heart disease, diabetes, and obesity — and even lowers life expectancy relative to people who do have access to healthy foods.\n\nJust promoting healthy choices won't eliminate these and other health disparities. Instead, public health organizations and their partners in sectors like education, transportation, and housing need to take action to improve the conditions in people's environments.\n\nThat's why Healthy People 2030 has an increased and overarching focus on SDOH.\n\nHow Does Healthy People 2030 Address SDOH?\n\nOne of Healthy People 2030’s 5 overarching goals is specifically related to SDOH: “Create social, physical, and economic environments that promote attaining the full potential for health and well-being for all.”\n\nIn line with this goal, Healthy People 2030 features many objectives related to SDOH. These objectives highlight the importance of \"upstream\" factors — usually unrelated to health care delivery — in improving health and reducing health disparities.\n\nMore than a dozen workgroups made up of subject matter experts with different backgrounds and areas of expertise developed these objectives. One of these groups, the Social Determinants of Health Workgroup, focuses solely on SDOH."
