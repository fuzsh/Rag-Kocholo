        "text": "According to Healthy People 2020, most Americans do not eat a healthful diet and are not physically active. Americaâ€™s Health Rankings reports that as of 2019, the obesity rate among adults is 34.8% compared to the national average rate of 30.9%. Texas currently ranks 10th in obesity among all US states.\n\nAdolescents have been shown to have a lower intake of fruits and vegetables than adults. For this reason, childhood obesity has been a growing concern in the past years. Childhood obesityis a condition in which a child is significantly overweight for his or her age and height.\n\nTreating obesity includes making changes to diet and incorporating regular exercise into ones daily routine. By making these changes, you reduce the risk of developing serious health conditions, such as high blood pressure, high cholesterol, diabetes, heart disease, stroke and cancer.\n\nOrganizations like the CDC and the Texas Department of State Health Services provided resources and materials that can be used to help diabetic patients manage their diabetes and to provide information about preventing diabetes."
