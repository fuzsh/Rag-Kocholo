Texas is home to some of the fastest-growing counties in the U.S. According to data from the U.S. Census Bureau, six of the top 10 fastest-growing counties in the U.S. were in the Lone Star State.

The number of U.S. residents moving into counties in Texas is a major contributing factor to its population growth. International migration, birth rates and death rates also affect a state's population growth.

Population growth data was measured between July 1, 2022 and July 1, 2023, according to the Census.

“Domestic migration patterns are changing, and the impact on counties is especially evident,” Lauren Bowers, chief of the Census Bureau’s Population Estimates Branch, said in a statement. “Areas which experienced high levels of domestic out-migration during the pandemic, such as in the Midwest and Northeast, are now seeing more counties with population growth. Meanwhile, county population growth is slowing down out West, such as in Arizona and Idaho.”

Eight of the top 10 counties that led the nation by numeric change in 2023 were in Texas. They included:

Harris County, which includes Houston. It added 53,788 residents and was the largest-gaining county in the nation.

Collin County, Texas, northeast of Dallas (36,364).

Montgomery County, Texas, north of Houston (31,800).

Sixty-seven percent, or 950 of the counties in the region, experienced population gains in 2023, up from 59%, or 836, in 2022.
