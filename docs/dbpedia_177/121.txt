At the same time, less than 25,000 resided in 48.7% of the counties.

As reported by the US Census Bureau, counties with large colleges and universities experienced their populations return to pre-pandemic levels as students began to come back. A prime example of this was Whitman County which hosts the Washington State University and saw its population climb by 10.1% although it had declined 9.6% between 2020 and 2021. Simultaneously, domestic outmigration became slow in some of the urban counties in the country. Overall, the nation’s South or West hosted all 10 of the most rapidly growing counties in 2022. Dallas County in Texas achieved the fastest population gain since 2017 by gaining 13,000 people from 2021 to 2022.

This number rose from 1,649 counties between 2021 to 2022.
