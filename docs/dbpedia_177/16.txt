Texas has 25 metropolitan areas (MSAs) defined by the United States Census Bureau. The two largest are ranked among the top 10 United States metropolitan areas.

As of November 2003, there is now an additional classification, that of a "Metropolitan Division." Texas has two metropolitan divisions within the Dallas–Fort Worth–Arlington MSA. The term metropolitan division is used to refer to a county or group of counties within a metropolitan area that has a population core of at least 2.5 million. While a metropolitan division is a subdivision of a larger metropolitan area, it often functions as a distinct social, economic, and cultural area within the larger region.

The following table lists population figures for those metropolitan areas, in rank of population. Population figures are as of the April 1, 2010 U.S. Census estimates.[1]
