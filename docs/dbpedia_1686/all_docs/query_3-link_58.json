Does it make you miss the yesteryears?\n\nJust watched a YT video of this season the other night, all the goals and was only a half hour video. What a season, probably the sweetest of all our PL titles bar the first.\n\nedit: just noticed it was the video in OP.\n\nOne of my favourite seasons.\n\nTo win it with Barthez in net, the Beckham stuff and the state of central defence is quite an achievement in hindsight. I remember thinking we should've beaten Real Madrid in the CL, but in hindsight 6-5 was a serious feat coming up against the absolute star names then.\n\nAlso, the unsung hero was probably John O'Shea. I was young so really had no idea at the time, but you look back at it now and he played a lot of football in a variety of positions at such a young age.\n\nBut, despite all that...Rio, RVN and Scholes were just\n\nO'Shea megging Figo\n\nThey were bigging him up like he was going to be a superstar.\n\nFelt Ole was the unsung hero, so many goals and assists for a striker playing out of position.\n\nI don't actually remember Barthez having a bad season at all. Quite the contratry - I thought he had a very good season. Problem is, it all fell apart for him in the last few matches of the season as he cost us a goal match after match, and was rightly replaced by Carroll for the last couple of games. And that was pretty much the end for him with us.\n\nWe had some terrible injuries in the first half of the season, somewhat went on a run with a makeshift side - beating Newcastle, Liverpool, Arsenal La Coruna. Then the big guns returned (Rio, Keane, Becks) and we prompty lost consecutive matches around Christmas at Birmingham and Middlesbrough, but our form really picked up after that. The football we played in the couple couple of months of the season was of the best I've seen United play.\n\nIn the beginning of the season. Plus that's nearly a goal a game!\n\nRio took some time to find his feet, sure, but we were pretty solid in the second half of the season. We usually concede far more these days... though that's no surprise, of course.\n\nThe football we played in the couple couple of months of the season was of the best I've seen United play.\n\nYeah, it was outstanding, only 06/07 comes close. That 6-2 at Newcastle remains one of my favourite games and the 5-3 at Old Trafford was also brilliant. I remember playing Leverkusen in the Champions League and being desperate to destroy them in revenge for the semi-final the previous season. Then there was Van Nistelrooy's insane goal at Basel, struggling against a flu-stricken Juventus at Old Trafford but crushing them away with a Giggs masterclass...\n\nThe \"title decider\" at Arsenal was one of the best games between two heavyweights I've seen, and I always think of that game when Arsenal fans do their whole \"woe us, we are always fecked over at Old Trafford\" -- they scored two offside goals, one of them spectacularly obvious. And Van Nistelrooy scored possibly the best goal of his United career. The other contender is also from this season, against Fulham. The memories, man."
