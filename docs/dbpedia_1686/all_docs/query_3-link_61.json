Then eventually he turn into more of a poacher style/type of striker.\n\nNothing against RVP, but what irks me the most is perhaps in his 2012/13 peak form, he can miss the easy chances, wayward shootings.

I felt at the time that Ronaldo, even though still world class, was little overhyped after the world cup despite what he did to us at Old Trafford. Henry was the clear number one striker at the time and for me, even the best player. I feel he got robbed in both 2003 and 2004. Zidane should never have won the world player of the year in 2003 ( Nedved for Ballon D'or is debatable but it would still be Henry for me). I felt they gave it preemptively to Ronaldinho in 2004. His 2003-2004 season was great, but it was 2004-05 that he brought Barca back to prominence. Meanwhile Henry's Arsenal went unbeaten with him having another ridiculous campaign. Ronaldinho should have won the 2006 WPOY an Ballon D'or instead of Cannavaro. I honestly feel that if he had played for one of the traditionally bigger teams, he would have won both of those outright. He was the most popular player in the world at the time ( before Ronaldinho usurped him).\n\nApr 9, 2020\n\n#189\n\nlsd\n\nThe Oracle\n\nJoined\n\nJun 5, 2016\n\nMessages\n\n11,027\n\nWhat time was Ruud the best striker in the world?

RVN was like having a constant penalty in the box. You knew you just had to get the ball to him in order to score, and so many times I saw defenders constantly marking him, giving him not as much as an inch, and still he just needed ONE good ball fed into him and he'd score, jeez, sometimes it didn't even have to be a good ball, he'd just smash. RVP on the other hand, was able to score from distance, much more capable of being part of the construction of the game and you could trust him to find a good pass to create danger. He could move all around the attack, he would go into the wings and serve deadly crosses, or he could cut in and shoot.\n\nDifferent types of top class. I couldn't pick ONE of either, it'd have to be based on taste/what I'd like my team to do when attacking.\n\nApr 9, 2020\n\n#191\n\nchomsky89\n\nNew Member\n\nJoined\n\nJun 5, 2016\n\nMessages\n\n177\n\nLocation\n\nBudapest\n\nHe wasn't better than Ruud in 02/03.
