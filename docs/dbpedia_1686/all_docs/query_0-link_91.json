        "text": "Karl Matchett@ @karlmatchettFeatured Columnist\n\nRanking Every Season of Steven Gerrard's Liverpool Career\n\n0 of 16\n\nShaun Botterill/Getty Images\n\nSteven Gerrard is playing out the final months of his long Liverpool career in 2014-15 before he heads to MLS to play for LA Galaxy.\n\nWith this being the 17th campaign Gerrard has participated in for the Reds, his hometown club and the team he has captained since 2003-04, he has pretty much seen it all: incredible highs and dreams of success, as well as crushing lows and wondering where improvement can ever come from.\n\nHere we take a look at each season in isolation of Gerrard's time at the club, ranking them to determine which was his own best year wearing the Liverbird on his chest.\n\nOmissions and Criteria\n\n1 of 16\n\nBen Radford/Getty Images\n\nBoth Gerrard's debut season and the present campaign are excluded from our list.\n\nHis early days saw Gerrard break through in 1998-99, but he played just 13 games in total, many of which came as substitute appearances. Gerrard didn't score in those early matches, and Liverpool finished seventh in the table.\n\nThe current campaign cannot, of course, be judged fully as it is still in progress. A title challenge is nearly impossible, but it will at least be a success if Gerrard can guide the Reds back into the top four before he departs, with cup silverware also a possibility—Liverpool are in the League Cup semi-final, the FA Cup fourth round and face the Europa League from February too.\n\nIn terms of criteria to judge the order of the seasons, the large emphasis has been placed on Gerrard's own performances and what he brought to the team, rather than what the team actually achieved as a whole. Of course this counts somewhat to what makes a year great or good, but as this is to rank Gerrard's time at the club, the greater importance will be given to his own form and achievements.\n\n15. 2002-03, Struggles for Form\n\n2 of 16\n\nMichael Steele/Getty Images\n\nGerrard's career had been almost a continuous upward trajectory until 2002-03, but as a talented young player still making his way, it was inevitable that he would suffer a downturn in fortunes at some point—and that came in this campaign.\n\nHe struggled to have a positive impact or find consistency, especially in the first half of the season, finding himself the focal point of unhappy fans at one point and not able to jell with the new signings, who themselves struggled badly.\n\nLiverpool ended fifth in the league in 2003.\n\nNotable point: being subbed off for Salif Diao at half-time in the Champions League vs. Basel\n\nGames: 54\n\nGoals: 7\n\n14. 2010-11, Injuries and Hodgson\n\n3 of 16\n\nClive Brunskill/Getty Images\n\nLiverpool had a new manager for 2010-11: Roy Hodgson, formerly of Fulham, Inter Milan and...Malmo. It wasn't a great first half of the season for the captain, moved back into the centre of midfield but in a slow, defensive-minded and wasteful set-up.\n\nHe found it hard to inspire the team to greater things with the rigid tactics in place, and even after Hodgson was sacked, it was no better for Gerrard as he missed most of the remainder of the season through injury.\n\nThe Reds finished sixth in the league.\n\nNotable point: A season of lows included captaining the Reds in a home defeat to Blackpool and being sent off at Old Trafford.\n\nGames: 24\n\nGoals: 8\n\n13. 1999-00, First Full Season\n\n4 of 16\n\nAlex Livesey/Getty Images\n\nGerrard started his first full season in the side, starting to make his name as a powerful and versatile performer who could pass over any distance and really bring some aggression to the side.\n\nInjuries soon became a bit of an issue for the youngster who was still growing into the all-action figure he would become, but he was still a regular starter whenever available and showed an increasing ability to get forward and contribute in attack.\n\nLiverpool finished fourth in the league and made an early exit from both domestic cups.\n\nNotable point: scoring his first senior goal on December 5, at home to Sheffield Wednesday.\n\nGames: 31\n\nGoals: 1\n\n12. 2011-12, We're on the March with Kenny's Army...\n\n5 of 16\n\nMike Hewitt/Getty Images\n\nGerrard's injury problems from the previous season continued into 2011-12, Kenny Dalglish's full season in charge at Anfield. Gerrard initially returned in late September but only made two starts until the turn of the year.\n\nThereafter he was used by Dalglish alternately in a central midfield role and just off the forward initially, before settling into a true centre-midfield berth. He impacted on play, and at times the team looked superb going forward, but defensively the team was not strong enough and performances were too inconsistent in the league.\n\nLiverpool finished eighth, lost the FA Cup final and won the League Cup final.\n\nNotable point: scoring a hat-trick at Anfield vs. Everton; missing a final shootout penalty in—but then lifting—the League Cup\n\nGames: 28\n\nGoals: 9\n\n11. 2009-10, Disappointment and Doubts\n\n6 of 16\n\nClive Brunskill/Getty Images\n\nLiverpool and Gerrard would have gone into this season dreaming of lifting the league title; instead it turned out to be a year of disappointments and false dawns.\n\nGerrard still grabbed himself a handful of goals, but an early Champions League exit and poor start to the league season clearly dampened his enthusiasm at times, and he struggled to assert himself as much as he would have liked—especially when Fernando Torres was absent.\n\nGerrard started a lot of games in the 10 role but was moved back into central midfield this year as the team failed to get the ball forward to him, following Xabi Alonso's departure.\n\nThe Reds ended the season in seventh, and even a run to the Europa League semifinal didn't bring too much joy.\n\nNotable point: playing his 500th Reds game in December; also a ridiculous curled goal from the wing vs. Hull City\n\nGames: 49\n\nGoals: 12\n\n10. 2001-02, 10 Games from Greatness\n\n7 of 16\n\nAlex Livesey/Getty Images\n\nGerrard suffered the odd injury absence in 2001-02, missing 10 league games over the course of the season in total, but was a regular performer in Europe, and by this point he was showing he had the capacity to figure among the top players in world football.\n\nHis game was a little more controlled and holding in the centre of the park at this time, resulting in far fewer goals, but Gerrard was also becoming a very rounded player.\n\nUnder Gerard Houllier, the Reds at one point looked at glory both domestically and in Europe but ended second in the league and were knocked out in the last eight of the Champions League.\n\nNotable point: a memorable, hammer-shot first-derby goal vs. Everton\n\nGames: 45\n\nGoals: 4\n\n9. 2012-13, Another New Start\n\n8 of 16\n\nClive Brunskill/Getty Images\n\nSteven Gerrard had a fifth Liverpool manager to meet and get to grips with in 2012-13, as Brendan Rodgers took over as Reds boss. Coming in with ideas of a 4-3-3, initial plans to play Gerrard wide in the front three were quickly ditched as Gerrard was deployed in a playmaking central-midfield berth.\n\nThe captain missed only two league games, his best return since 2007, but performances were mixed for both player and club.\n\nLiverpool ended seventh and exited all cup competitions by February.\n\nNotable point: winning an FWA Tribute Award and big wins over the likes of Norwich City, Swansea City and Newcastle United\n\nGames: 46\n\nGoals: 10\n\n8. 2003-04, New Liverpool Captain\n\n9 of 16\n\nStu Forster/Getty Images\n\nGerrard picked up significantly in both consistency and impact in 2003-04 compared to the previous season, showing that he could really push Liverpool on—at times this season it seemed as though everything went through him.\n\nIt was no huge surprise when, midway through the season, Houllier appointed Gerrard as the new permanent captain of the club, taking over from Sami Hyypia.\n\nAs Liverpool struggled for high points as a team, Gerrard's emergence as one of Europe's best was confirmed on almost a weekly basis, with his dominant displays in the centre of the park and his terrific array of ammunition for the front players a common theme.\n\nThe Reds finished fourth in the table.\n\nNotable point: assisting Michael Owen on the last day of the season with an outrageous, pinpoint, curling cross from 40 yards out vs. Newcastle\n\nGames: 47\n\nGoals: 6\n\n7. 2006-07, European Heartache\n\n10 of 16\n\nLaurence Griffiths/Getty Images\n\nLiverpool were a force in Europe, making their second final in three seasons in 2006-07, with Gerrard the hub of everything positive.\n\nHe was a key part of the team's attack, looking to thread passes and provide killer set pieces at every opportunity, though more changes in positions meant he didn't score as many this time around.\n\nLiverpool finished third in the league, miles off the top, and were beaten finalists in Athens in the Champions League final.\n\nNotable point: setting up Liverpool's equaliser on aggregate in the Champions League semifinal second leg and then scoring his own penalty\n\nGames: 51\n\nGoals: 11\n\n6. 2000-01, Cup Treble Campaign\n\n11 of 16\n\nJamie McDonald/Getty Images\n\nThe peak of Houllier's reign of the club saw Gerrard alternating between a central-midfield role and a wide-right role, as the likes of Gerrard, Davey Thompson and Danny Murphy all used to battle between themselves for positions.\n\nAn influence both offensively and defensively, Gerrard was a committed figure who could rampage all over the pitch, and he begun showing his outrageous ability to score long-range strikes, too. He hit 10 for the season in all competitions in a tremendous season for the club.\n\nLiverpool finished third but won every cup competition: League Cup, FA Cup and UEFA Cup.\n\nNotable point: scoring in the UEFA Cup final win over Alaves\n\nGames: 50\n\nGoals: 10\n\n5. 2013-14, New Position, New Ambitions\n\n12 of 16\n\nLaurence Griffiths/Getty Images\n\nThe season it all so nearly came together for Gerrard to complete his trophy haul.\n\nLiverpool came from nowhere the season before to emerge as title challengers, playing with a fantastically cavalier attitude which saw them score for fun, smash teams asunder and dare the rest of the league to go toe-to-toe with them.\n\nGerrard reverted to a deep-lying midfielder, picking up possession in deep areas and starting attacks from behind the midfield line—though also having to do plenty of protective defensive work. With this he alternately got caught out by mobile players and showed his undying commitment and belief with a series of strong challenges and work-fuelled performances.\n\nThe captain also found himself on the scoresheet a number of times from set pieces, but it simply wasn't to be in the end.\n\nLiverpool came second in the league, two points off top spot.\n\nNotable point: his last-ditch penalty at Fulham, two penalties in a rout of Manchester United at Old Trafford and a header in the destruction of Everton at Anfield; also hitting a top-corner free-kick winner vs. Sunderland...but also losing possession for the opening goal vs. Chelsea late in the season\n\nGames: 39\n\nGoals: 14\n\n4. 2007-08, Central to Everything\n\n13 of 16\n\nRyan Pierse/Getty Images\n\n2007-08 saw Gerrard almost universally used in a No. 10 role, where his physicality married almost perfectly with his attacking instincts to be a free-running scorer from deep. Key to much of his link play was, of course, his new relationship with Fernando Torres, Liverpool's new striker signing.\n\nThe two had a great understanding almost immediately, but even aside from that, Gerrard was hugely impressive with his bursts from 30 yards out into the box, his composure in front of goal and ability in the big games.\n\nLiverpool came fourth in the table and reached the semifinals of the Champions League.\n\nNotable point: The season of Gerrard's late strikes and winners. He scored in the 85th minute or later against Aston Villa (season opener), Besiktas, Fulham, Derby County, Sunderland, Inter Milan and Arsenal.\n\nGames: 52\n\nGoals: 21\n\n3. 2004-05, Champions League Glory\n\n14 of 16\n\n2. 2005-06, Right-Wing Wonder and the \"Gerrard\" Final\n\n15 of 16\n\nStu Forster/Getty Images\n\nWith the team starting to look a force, Gerrard was moved into a wider role by Benitez as he looked to solidify the centre of the park with more natural sitting midfielders.\n\nGerrard's creativity was nothing new, but he really came to the fore as a scoring threat too, breaking the 20-goal barrier for the first time in his career as he cut in to operate in the space just behind the striker on a regular basis.\n\nLiverpool finished third in the table and won the FA Cup, while also finishing second in the World Club Cup.\n\nNotable point: leathering in a 90th-minute equaliser in the FA Cup final\n\nGames: 53\n\nGoals: 23\n\n1. 2008-09, Torres and Gerrard Almost Take Liverpool to Title\n\n16 of 16\n\nClive Brunskill/Getty Images\n\nWith the Steven Gerrard-Fernando Torres linkup at its most profitable and magical, the Nos. 8 and 9 almost fired Liverpool to the Premier League title.\n\nGerrard missed a handful of games, though, and Torres barely made the halfway level in the league, which probably cost them in the end. Gerrard's surging runs, brilliant finishes from inside the box and telepathic through-passes for Torres to latch onto were by far the most exciting aspects of Rafa Benitez's team, right now at its peak.\n\nThe Reds finished second in the league and went out in the Champions League quarterfinals in extra time to Chelsea.\n\nNotable point: scoring twice vs. Real Madrid and once vs. Manchester United in four days, both big wins as the silverware charge geared up; also a phenomenal individual (and team) performance at Newcastle United\n\nGames: 44\n\nGoals: 24\n\nAll statistics for Gerrard's appearances and goals courtesy of LFChistory.net.\n\nFollow @karlmatchett\n\nX"
