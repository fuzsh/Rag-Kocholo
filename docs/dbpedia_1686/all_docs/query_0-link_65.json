Scroll down to see which strikes are included in the first part of our list, from 25 to 11.\n\n#5: Andy Cole v Marseille (h), 1999/00\n\n#4: Ryan Giggs (2nd) v Juventus (a), 2002/03\n\n#3: Ruud van Nistelrooy (2nd) v Basel (a), 2002/03\n\n#2: Andy Cole v Barcelona (a), 1998/99\n\n#1: Paul Scholes (2nd) v Panathinaikos (h), 2000/01\n\nFOLLOW THE GROUP-STAGE DRAW\n\nAfter three years away, the draw for the 2023/24 Champions League will take place at Grimaldi Forum in Monaco, from 17:00 BST on Thursday, revealing which three sides we will face.\n\nOne of Europeâ€™s elite is coming, with Barcelona, Bayern Munich, Benfica, Feyenoord, Napoli, Paris Saint-Germain and Sevilla our possible Pot One opponents.\n\nUnited will be in Pot Two, and Pots Three and Four were confirmed on Wednesday evening when the third-round play-offs were concluded.
