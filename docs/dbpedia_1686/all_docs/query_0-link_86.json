        "text": "Murat Yakin (Turkish: Yakın; born 15 September 1974) is a Swiss football coach and former player. He is the manager of the Switzerland national football team.\n\nIn 2021, following stints as manager at Swiss clubs including Basel, Grasshoppers and Sion, he was appointed as coach of the Swiss national team, guiding them to qualification for 2022 FIFA World Cup and UEFA Euro 2024.\n\nPlaying career\n\nYakin spent the longest spell of his career playing for his hometown club Basel, where he was the defensive linchpin, captain and libero of a team which enjoyed domestic and relative European success. He won the Swiss Super League on five occasions (1995, 1996, 2002, 2004, 2005), and the Swiss Cup three times (1994, 2002, 2003). He recalls the 2002–03 Champions League second leg qualifying match on 28 August 2002 against Celtic in St. Jakob-Park as the \"match of his life\". Basel won the game 2–0, with Yakin scoring the second goal in the 22nd minute as Basel qualified 3–3 on the away goals rule for the 2002–03 UEFA Champions League group stage.\n\nIn 2003, he played in the FIFA \"Match against Poverty\" in Basel, on Ronaldo's team which won 4–3 against Zinedine Zidane's.\n\nYakin was capped 49 times for the Switzerland national team, representing his country at UEFA Euro 2004.\n\nInternational goals\n\nNo. Date Venue Opponent Score Result Competition 1. 12 October 2002 Tirana, Albania Albania 1–0 1–1 UEFA Euro 2004 qualifying\n\nCoaching career\n\nEarly career\n\nYakin was appointed coach of Thun in 2009, after a time as a youth coach at Grasshoppers and head coach of Frauenfeld. Yakin led Thun to promotion in his first year as manager there, winning the Swiss Challenge League in 2010. In his second season with the club, Thun managed to finish fifth in the Swiss Super League and earned a spot in the second qualifying round of the following season's UEFA Europa League.\n\nIn May 2011, he joined Luzern for a reported 200,000 Swiss francs. He took over from Christian Brand, who was made caretaker after the sacking of Rolf Fringer.\n\nBasel\n\nOn 15 October 2012, Yakin was appointed as the new manager of Basel. Under his management, Basel won twice, home and away, against Chelsea in the 2013–14 Champions League group stage. He praised the supporters in the stadium, saying that they pushed the team to win through the 90 minutes. He was also delighted to have received praise from then Chelsea manager José Mourinho. On 17 May 2014, Basel announced Yakin was no longer with the club after he guided them to two domestic titles in as many years.\n\nSpartak Moscow\n\nOn 16 June 2014, Yakin was appointed as manager of Russian Premier League side Spartak Moscow. According to Russian media, the deal was a long-term contract with Yakin earning an annual salary of 1.6 million euros ($2.18 million).\n\nOn 30 May 2015, after only one season with the club, his contract with the club was terminated after a mutual agreement.\n\nReturn to Schaffhausen\n\nOn 17 June 2019, it was confirmed, that Yakin had returned to Schaffhausen, as their new manager having left Sion previously that year.\n\nSwitzerland national team\n\nOn 9 August 2021, Yakin was appointed as the manager of the Switzerland national team. In the 2022 World Cup qualification, Northern Ireland held reigning European champions Italy to a goalless draw, thereby ensuring that Switzerland qualified for the tournament and Italy had to play in the playoffs. In gratitude, he sent 9.3 kg of Swiss chocolate to the Irish Football Association. In the 2022 FIFA World Cup, he led Switzerland to finish second in their group, in order to qualify to the round of 16, where they lost 6–1 to Portugal.\n\nPersonal life\n\nYakin is the elder brother of Hakan Yakin, who was also a professional footballer with successful stints at Grasshoppers, Basel, and Young Boys and represented Switzerland at international level also. Yakin is of Turkish descent.\n\nManagerial statistics\n\nManagerial record by team and tenure Team From To Record G W D L GF GA GD Win % Thun 1 July 2009 1 July 2011 &&&&&&&&&&&&&074.&&&&&074 &&&&&&&&&&&&&035.&&&&&035 &&&&&&&&&&&&&023.&&&&&023 &&&&&&&&&&&&&016.&&&&&016 &&&&&&&&&&&&0138.&&&&&0138 &&&&&&&&&&&&&085.&&&&&085 +53 &&&&&&&&&&&&&047.30000047.30 Luzern 1 July 2011 19 August 2012 &&&&&&&&&&&&&046.&&&&&046 &&&&&&&&&&&&&019.&&&&&019 &&&&&&&&&&&&&016.&&&&&016 &&&&&&&&&&&&&011.&&&&&011 &&&&&&&&&&&&&064.&&&&&064 &&&&&&&&&&&&&046.&&&&&046 +18 &&&&&&&&&&&&&041.30000041.30 Basel 15 October 2012 19 May 2014 &&&&&&&&&&&&&099.&&&&&099 &&&&&&&&&&&&&056.&&&&&056 &&&&&&&&&&&&&028.&&&&&028 &&&&&&&&&&&&&015.&&&&&015 &&&&&&&&&&&&0172.&&&&&0172 &&&&&&&&&&&&&091.&&&&&091 +81 &&&&&&&&&&&&&056.57000056.57 Spartak Moscow 16 June 2014 30 May 2015 &&&&&&&&&&&&&032.&&&&&032 &&&&&&&&&&&&&013.&&&&&013 &&&&&&&&&&&&&&08.&&&&&08 &&&&&&&&&&&&&011.&&&&&011 &&&&&&&&&&&&&043.&&&&&043 &&&&&&&&&&&&&044.&&&&&044 −1 &&&&&&&&&&&&&040.63000040.63 Schaffhausen 21 December 2016 28 August 2017 &&&&&&&&&&&&&025.&&&&&025 &&&&&&&&&&&&&019.&&&&&019 &&&&&&&&&&&&&&02.&&&&&02 &&&&&&&&&&&&&&04.&&&&&04 &&&&&&&&&&&&&066.&&&&&066 &&&&&&&&&&&&&024.&&&&&024 +42 &&&&&&&&&&&&&076.&&&&&076.00 Grasshoppers 28 August 2017 10 April 2018 &&&&&&&&&&&&&026.&&&&&026 &&&&&&&&&&&&&&09.&&&&&09 &&&&&&&&&&&&&&07.&&&&&07 &&&&&&&&&&&&&010.&&&&&010 &&&&&&&&&&&&&034.&&&&&034 &&&&&&&&&&&&&029.&&&&&029 +5 &&&&&&&&&&&&&034.62000034.62 Sion 17 September 2018 7 May 2019 &&&&&&&&&&&&&028.&&&&&028 &&&&&&&&&&&&&&09.&&&&&09 &&&&&&&&&&&&&&07.&&&&&07 &&&&&&&&&&&&&012.&&&&&012 &&&&&&&&&&&&&038.&&&&&038 &&&&&&&&&&&&&045.&&&&&045 −7 &&&&&&&&&&&&&032.14000032.14 Schaffhausen 17 June 2019 9 August 2021 &&&&&&&&&&&&&077.&&&&&077 &&&&&&&&&&&&&022.&&&&&022 &&&&&&&&&&&&&026.&&&&&026 &&&&&&&&&&&&&029.&&&&&029 &&&&&&&&&&&&&097.&&&&&097 &&&&&&&&&&&&0117.&&&&&0117 −20 &&&&&&&&&&&&&028.57000028.57 Switzerland 9 August 2021 Present &&&&&&&&&&&&&034.&&&&&034 &&&&&&&&&&&&&015.&&&&&015 &&&&&&&&&&&&&011.&&&&&011 &&&&&&&&&&&&&&08.&&&&&08 &&&&&&&&&&&&&054.&&&&&054 &&&&&&&&&&&&&037.&&&&&037 +17 &&&&&&&&&&&&&044.12000044.12 Total &&&&&&&&&&&&0441.&&&&&0441 &&&&&&&&&&&&0197.&&&&&0197 &&&&&&&&&&&&0128.&&&&&0128 &&&&&&&&&&&&0116.&&&&&0116 &&&&&&&&&&&&0706.&&&&&0706 &&&&&&&&&&&&0518.&&&&&0518 +188 &&&&&&&&&&&&&044.67000044.67\n\nHonours\n\nAs a player\n\nBasel\n\nSwiss Super League: 2001–02, 2003–04, 2004–05\n\nSwiss Cup: 2001–02, 2002–03\n\nIndividual\n\nSwiss Young Player of the Year: 1994\n\nAxpo Swiss Super Leaguer Player of the Year: 2002\n\nAs a manager\n\nThun\n\nSwiss Challenge League: 2009–10\n\nBasel\n\nSwiss Super League: 2012–13, 2013–14\n\nIndividual\n\nSwiss Super League Manager of the Year: 2013–14, 2017–18\n\nSee also"
