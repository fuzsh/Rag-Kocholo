The only other games among us traders from 1998 in HD are the three matches featuring Japan.\n\nThen there's clips like this one of Beckham's sending off:\n\nFrom the 1994 World Cup, there's this clip of Baresi and Baggio missing their penalties.\n\nThere are games even from 1990 which exist in an early form of HD, but as far as I'm aware all these games are held in the NHK's archives (if they still exist at all).\n\nHi fellow collectors!\n\nI'm an FC Barcelona collector, but I have been off for quite a while. Please find attached my list of matches (outdated, I've got plenty of new matches, yet the old list still remains valid).\n\nhttps://docs.google.com/spreadsheet...ouid=109956962905890093948&rtpof=true&sd=true\n\nHere's my email if you would like to contact me: master16L@yahoo.com\n\nAlso, I'm looking for BBC/ITV coverage of EURO 04, 08 and WC 06, 10 (only HD matches). If you have any of these, I'd be down to trade\n\nGreetings!\n\nMichael\n\nthanks for the reply.\n\ni do know about the 3 japan games ( i already got 2 of them this month) but looks like there's more from 1998 WC in wide screen hd. definitely the final exists full. if it didn't exist, i would have the full game in 720p. the question is who has the uncompressed 1080p version?\n\ni am also aware of those 1994 WC final in hd and the 1990 WC games in some kind of early hd. it happened to watch those clips in youtube too.\n\nbut for that england argentina game from 1998 i had no clue. thanks for posting it.\n\ni also heard that the first hd games were in the 1988 olympics from the japanese tv. this is unreal. 1988??? unbelieavable.\n\nPS.I hope NHK has kept the files of those 1990 and 1994 and 1998 hd games. if not they desrved to be skinned alive\n\nobviously my original is the same like all collectors, the 720p 30fps\n\nthis is just an upscale 720 to 1080 and frame interpolation 30p to 60p, all done with software by AI (artificial intelligence),it was a very long process for my computer, more than 40 hours\n\nmy computer : HP Omen 30L GT13 Intel Core I9 10900K 64GB RTX 3080\n\nI've been looking for that final in 1080 for many years, I asked all my Japanese friends collectors.Unfortunately nobody has"
