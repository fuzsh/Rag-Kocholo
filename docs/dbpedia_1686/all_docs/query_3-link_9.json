Formed in 1893, the club has been Swiss national champions 20 times, Swiss Cup winners 13 times, and Swiss League Cup winners once.\n\nBasel have competed in UEFA competitions every season since 1999–2000. They have qualified for the Group stages of the Champions League more times than any other Swiss club – a total of seven times – and are the only Swiss club to have ever qualified to the Group stages directly.

At first the club played their home games in the Landhof stadium. During the mid-1960s Basel then played their games in St. Jakob Stadium which was demolished in 1998. During the construction of the new stadium, between 1998 and 2001, the Stadion Schützenmatte was the club's temporary home ground. Since 2001 Basel play home games at St. Jakob-Park, which is currently the largest club stadium in Switzerland.\n\nThe history of FC Basel\n\nDue to its size the history of FC Basel has been divided into five sections. For details on individual periods of the club's history, see the following articles:\n\nHistory of FC Basel (1893–1918)\n\nThe first section deals with the foundation, the early years, the forming of the Swiss Football Association (ASF-SFV), the first league championships and the years up to and during the first World War.\n\nHistory of FC Basel (1918–1939)\n\nThe second section is about the period between the two World Wars and the introduction of the Swiss Cup. FCB did not have much of an early footballing success; it took them 40 years to win their first trophy, winning the cup in 1933, as they defeated arch-rivals and reigning cup-holders Grasshopper Club Zürich in the final.\n\nHistory of FC Basel (1939–1965)\n\nThe third section starts with relegation, no promotion, missed promotion, promotion after all, another relegation, another promotion and the second cup title. It then spans the period of Jules Düblin as chairman, the first championship title and the third cup win.\n\nHistory of FC Basel (1965–2000)\n\nUnder the motto rise and fall, the fourth section deals with the era Benthaus, seven domestic league titles, the subsequent decline, relegation, six seasons of second-tier football and the long-awaited promotion.\n\nHistory of FC Basel (2000–present)\n\nThe fifth section deals with the financial backing that had been put into the club at that time, the move to the new stadium St. Jakob-Park, how success returned and how things have progressed to the present day.\n\nSupporters and rivalries\n\nFans\n\nFC Basel is known for having a big and loyal local following. When polls are conducted about the most passionate club football fans, FC Basel's fans usually make the top 200 if not top 100 in the world, resulting in what is by far the highest average attendance in Switzerland with around 30,000 fans attending every home game and with the new extension being built that number is expected to rise to around 40,000. The fans have also made themselves a name in numerous international matches in recent years. World tennis legend Roger Federer is one of the club's most famous fans.\n\nIn November 2010 their supporters caused the game against FC Luzern to be stopped after they threw hundreds of tennis balls onto the pitch. This was in protest at the kick off times being moved to accommodate a tennis tournament on the TV schedule.\n\nRivalry\n\nThe city of Basel and the city of Zürich have a long-standing rivalry. Therefore, FCB's most traditional and fiercest rivals are Grasshopper Club Zürich and FC Zürich. In the past few seasons, the rivalry between FC Zürich and Basel has been fueled by Zürich's narrow league championship wins over Basel. Supporters from both sides have caused trouble in the past years, with the worst incident happening in May 2006. Basel had won the league in 2003–04 and 2004–05 and were set to make it three in a row if they won or drew against Zürich at home on the last day of the 2005–06 season. Zürich took the lead after a late goal from Iulian Filipescu and consequently won the match and the league. After the final whistle, players and fans from both teams started fighting on the pitch and in the stands. This incident has fueled hatred and bitterness between fans from FC Zürich and FC Basel. There is controversy about which rivalry is bigger, the one with Grasshopper or FC Zürich, but it usually depends on the success of these teams.\n\nStadium\n\nFC Basel play their home games at the 37,500 capacity St. Jakob-Park.\n\nUEFA have awarded the stadium a 4-star rating, the highest rating that could be given to a stadium of that capacity. St. Jakob-Park was opened in 2001, originally holding a maximum attendance of 33,433. The stadium was expanded with a new stand (sector G) and upgraded to 42,500 due to Switzerland co-hosting UEFA Euro 2008. After Euro 2008, a number of seats were removed, thus giving more space between them, and the capacity was reduced 37,500 seats. The stadium is nicknamed \"Joggeli\" by the fans and has two restaurants, Restaurant UNO and Hattrick's Sports Bar, as well as a shopping centre which opened on 1 November 2001. It also has parking space for 680 cars and has its own train station. St. Jakob-Park hosted six matches during Euro 2008, including the opening game between Switzerland and Czech Republic, and a semi-final between Germany and Turkey. The most interesting feature of the stadium is the translucent outer layer, which can be illuminated in different colours for impressive effects; this effect was copied three years later for Bayern Munich's new stadium, the Allianz Arena.\n\nBefore St. Jakob-Park was built, FC Basel played home games in the Landhof (in the Quarter Kleinbasel) and, following the 1954 FIFA World Cup, in the newly built St. Jakob Stadium which was on the same site as the current stadium. During the construction period of St. Jakob-Park, Basel's home matches were played at the Stadion Schützenmatte.\n\nIn 2016, the UEFA Europa League final was played at St. Jakob-Park.\n\nAffiliated clubs\n\nFC Concordia Basel – FC Basel are the parent-club of local side Concordia, who currently play in the 1. Liga Classic. Many of Basel's youth players, such as Patrik Baumann, Beg Ferati, and Simone Grippo, have had loan spells there. Basel have also signed a number players from Concordia, like Louis Crayton and Murat Yakin. Miroslav König, Riccardo Meili, André Muff, and Dominik Ritter are just a few ex-Basel players who have gone on to play for Concordia.\n\nChennai City FC – FC Basel owns 26% of the club.\n\nColours and logo\n\nFC Basel's traditional kit is a red and blue shirt. Due to the fact that some of the founders were members of the \"Basler Ruder-Club\", whose colors were red and blue, they adopted those colours for their new club. FC Basel's outfit is completed by blue shorts with gold trim and blue socks with red trim. From this comes the nickname \"RotBlau\" which is Swiss German and German for \"RedBlue\". Their away kit is all white with two stripes down the middle, the left being red and the right being blue. FC Basel's kits were formerly manufactured by Nike, however in the summer of 2012 a new contract was formed with Adidas to produce the kits until 2017. The main sponsor is Novartis, a multinational pharmaceutical company which is based in the city of Basel. On the inside tag of the jerseys is inscribed \"Rot isch unseri Liebi, Blau die ewigi Treui, Basel unseri Stadt.\" This roughly translates to \"Red is our love, blue the eternal loyalty, Basel our city.\"\n\nAccording to a legend, the famous \"Blaugrana\" colours of Barcelona have been said to have originated from the Rotblau colours of FC Basel. This legend evolved because Joan Gamper, founder of both FC Zürich and FC Barcelona had played two friendly games for FC Basel against Mulhouse and Strasbourg on short visits, as he did for other Swiss clubs, too. FC Barcelona today based on accounts of the Gamper family assumes, the colours had been taken from the rugby team of the Merchant Taylors' School near Liverpool.\n\nFor the 2008–09 season, Basel changed their shirt to resemble the traditional Barcelona shirt (red and blue vertical stripes). Barcelona changed theirs to one half of the shirt red, the other blue, which happens to resemble the traditional Basel shirt.\n\nBasel's current logo is a shield, the left half red and the right half blue. The shield is outlined with gold and in the centre in gold letters it reads \"FCB\", for \"Football Club Basel\" or \"Fussballclub Basel\". The logo is worn in the centre of the shirt opposed to on the traditional left-hand side. Like the club colours of Basel, the logo has a striking resemblance to that of Barcelona's. There are theories that suggest that the founder of Barcelona, being at one time the captain of Basel, reincorporated the logo of Basel to that of Barcelona. The resemblances seem clear: both logos seem to incorporate the shield design, as do most other clubs. Most notably, however, is the FCB acronyms on both logos and the red-blue colours, outlined in gold. Additionally, the football that lies on the left side of the Basel logo seems to be the exact shape, type and colour as that of the Barcelona logo in the bottom centre. Because of this, many say that Basel was the inspiration in the process of founding Barcelona.\n\nRecords\n\nHighest stage reached in Champions League: Round of 16 (2002–03, 2011–12, 2014–15, 2017–18)\n\nHighest stage reached in UEFA Europa League: Semi-finals (2012–13)\n\nHighest stage reached in UEFA Europa Conference League: Semi-finals (2022–23)\n\nBiggest European home win: Basel 7–0 Folgore (24 August 2000, UEFA Cup qualifying round second leg)\n\nBiggest European away win: Fram 0–5 Basel (18 September 1973, European Champion Clubs' Cup first round first leg)\n\nBiggest European home defeat: Basel 0–5 Barcelona (22 October 2008, UEFA Champions League)\n\nBiggest European away defeat: Bayern Munich 7–0 Basel (13 March 2012, UEFA Champions League knockout stage)\n\nMost league appearances: Massimo Ceccaroni (398)\n\nMost league goals: Josef Hügi (244)\n\nRecord number of consecutive home games unbeaten: 59 (February 2003 to May 2006)\n\nRecord number of consecutive unbeaten games: 26 (2011–12)\n\nHighest home game attendance (St. Jakob Stadium): 60,000\n\nHighest home game attendance (St. Jakob-Park): 42,500\n\nMost capped foreign player: Teófilo Cubillas, 81 caps, Peru\n\nMost capped Swiss player: Alexander Frei, 82 caps\n\nIndividual records, league\n\nUpdated to league matches played on 22 May 2022.\n\nTop league goalscorers # Nat.

All decisions that affect the club FC Basel 1893 are made within the AG.\n\nOn 11 May 2021 the FC Basel Holding AG chairman Bernhard Burgener and board member David Degen announced a transfer of ownership rights, after months of massive fan protests. The new situation meant Degen owned 92% of the shares and about 8% is held by four small investors.

Safra Sarasin, Novasearch AG, MCH Group AG and Weitnauer Holding AG.\n\nOn 27 December 2021 an extraordinary AGM of the Holding AG was held and it was announced that the Board had reorganised itself. Ursula Rey-Krayer and Dan Holzmann were unanimously elected to the board of directors. At the same time, Sophie Herzog, Christian Gross, Johannes Barth and Reto Baumgartner resigned from the Board and were to focus upon their duties as members of the Board of Directors of FC Basel 1893 AG.\n\nSince that date the new Board of the FC Basel Holding AG consists of the following members: David Degen (president), Dani Büchi (delegate of the board), Marco Gadola, Dan Holzmann, Ursula Rey-Krayer and Andreas Rey (vice-president). With the meeting FC Basel Holding AG had an adjusted composition - the FCB shareholders were represented upon the Board of Directors of FC Basel Holding AG by those with the overall largest proportion.\n\nThe Board of Directors of the FC Basel 1893 AG as it was announced in June 2021: Reto Baumgartner, (president), Johannes Barth.

It competes in the Nationalliga A.\n\nSuperleague Formula\n\nMain article: FC Basel 1893 (Superleague Formula team)\n\nFC Basel had a team in the Superleague Formula race car series where football teams lent their name to cars. GU-Racing International has operated the car for all seasons and Max Wissel has driven the car in all the races. FC Basel and Wissel won one race, in the 2009 season at Donington Park. The team have scored three other podiums in the series.\n\nYouth system\n\nBasel is known throughout Switzerland for having a good youth system. FC Basel bases its promotion of young talent on the following criteria: The primary aim of the FCB youth department is to integrate as many players as possible into the first team squad, all representatives of the youth department adhere to the values of the FCB charter, a uniform, holistic game and training idea from the FE-14 to the U21 ensures optimal training, the FCB follows a dual system of educational training and football.\n\nThe youth department has developed many Swiss internationals such as Erni Maissen, Adrian Knup, Alexander Frei, Marco Streller, Philipp, and David Degen. Since Basel moved into the St. Jakob-Park in 2001, they have strengthened their youth academy and many young talents like the Felipe Caicedo, Ivan Rakitić, Zdravko Kuzmanović, Xherdan Shaqiri, Yann Sommer, Eren Derdiyok, and Mohammed Salah have risen through the ranks there. In 2010 the former club president Gigi Oeri created the Stiftung Nachwuchs Campus Basel (in English foundation Youth Campus Basel) with the aim of continuously developing the club's youth division on a long-term basis.\n\nSince 2001, more than 50 successful players have risen through the Basel youth system and joined their first team, including:\n\nFelipe Caicedo\n\nDavid Degen\n\nPhilipp Degen\n\nEren Derdiyok\n\nAlexander Frei\n\nFabian Frei\n\nJosé Gonçalves\n\nGökhan Inler\n\nTimm Klose\n\nBreel Embolo\n\nZdravko Kuzmanović\n\nIvan Rakitić\n\nXherdan Shaqiri\n\nYann Sommer\n\nValentin Stocker\n\nMarco Streller\n\nGranit Xhaka\n\nTaulant Xhaka\n\nHakan Yakin\n\nThe youth academy is as present set up in the following areas: Formation (U-21, U-19, U-17, U1-6 and U-15), Footeco (FE-14) and Project Team Basel (FE-12 and FE-13).\n\nUnder-21 team\n\nThe eldest members are in the U-21 team. This team plays in the Swiss Promotion League, the third highest level in the Swiss football league system, behind the Super League and the Challenge League. A number of players have professional contracts and often train or play with the first team.\n\nUnder-19 team\n\nUntil 2023 there was no official Basel U-19 team, because a U-19 championship did not exist in Swiss football until then. Before then the team was quickly put together in the 2011–12 season from the youngest members of the first team, the younger Under-21 and the Under-18 teams who were eligible to play in the 2011–12 NextGen Series. Note: Results and dates can be found here 2011–12 NextGen series.\n\nBecause Basel qualified for the 2013–14 UEFA Champions League, the Under-19 team was again called to life and played in the 2013–14 UEFA Youth League. This time the members of this squad were solely members from the U-21 and U-18 teams, but the team only trained together once a week. Note: Results and dates can be found here 2013–14 UEFA Youth League.\n\nA year later Basel qualified for the 2014–15 UEFA Champions League. Therefore, they were eligible to play in the 2014–15 UEFA Youth League and they took the matter a lot more seriously than the year before. Reserve team manager Thomas Häberli was also appointed as U-19 coach. Häberli's U-19 squad was still a mix between the younger U-21 and the older U-18 teams, but the team had training together virtually daily. This resulted with improved results, the team winning four games from their six, but failing to qualify for the knockout phase on tiebreak. Note: Results and dates can be found here 2014–15 UEFA Youth League.\n\nBasel's first team qualified for the Champions League again in 2016–17, so the U-19 team was revived for the 2016–17 UEFA Youth League. Raphaël Wicky was U-19 coach. In the group stage they reached second position and advanced to the play-offs, but lost this against Rosenborg. Note: Results and dates can be found here 2016–17 UEFA Youth League.\n\nBy winning the U-18 Swiss championship at the end of the 2016–17 season the team qualified for the 2017–18 UEFA Youth League. Arjan Peço was the U-19 team coach at the time. The team were drawn into Group A which they won and advanced to the round of 16, but here they were eliminated by Atlético Madrid. Note: Results and dates can be found here 2017–18 UEFA Youth League.\n\nAt the end of the 2017–18 season the U-18 team coached by Alex Frei won the Swiss championship and qualified for the 2018–19 UEFA Youth League. But they were eliminated in the first round by Hamilton Academical, having drawn both matches 2–2, they were defeated in the penalty shoot-out.
