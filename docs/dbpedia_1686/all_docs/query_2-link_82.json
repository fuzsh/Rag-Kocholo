        "text": "Unless the ladies were put up as a prize in the raffle what's the problem? Was the ladies team founded 125 years ago? If not, it's not their anniversary. Yet another fuss about nothing by people with way too much time on their hands.\n\nAnyone who claims women's football is equal to men's football should be ignored as they obviously know nothing about the game.\n\nTotally agree. Can't be arsed with this equality nonsense in Sport, particularly from the BBC.\n\nWomen's football is largely pish and shouldn't get anything like the publicity it currently gets. If that makes me some sort of sexist dinosaur, then so be it. I'm still right though.\n\nAnyone who claims women's football is equal to men's football should be ignored as they obviously know nothing about the game.\n\nUltimately it'll be up to women to support the women's game.\n\nIf women want to make the women's game equally attractive to sponsors and commercial TV, then women need to turn up in 40,000 crowds at every women's game and then watch those matches in the hundreds of thousands on telly. If they do that, the TV coverage they will get will be equal.\n\nUntil then, I'm not being sexist in saying that women's football shouldn't get equal treatment. TV didn't make men's football popular. It was men turning up that made it popular. Once it was popular, TV started covering it, not the other way round\n\nSalford would annihilate the England ladies team.\n\nSalford under 18s would annihilate the England ladies team\n\nI think it is great women want to play football and they should be encouraged and given the opportunity to do so\n\nI have no interest in watching or reading it though and no amount of force feeding by an agenda driven media will change that\n\nDiverting funds from the men's game to subsidise it is wrong\n\nIf it is a social policy issue it should be government funded\n\nBut no sport was ever successful purely because of government support\n\nThere needs to be grass root participation and organic growth\n\nThis doesn't exist for women's football\n\nUltimately it'll be up to women to support the women's game.\n\nIf women want to make the women's game equally attractive to sponsors and commercial TV, then women need to turn up in 40,000 crowds at every women's game and then watch those matches in the hundreds of thousands on telly.
