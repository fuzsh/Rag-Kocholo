In this chapter I review his own preferred variety, which he most recently labelled ‘science-inspired naturalism’, linking it back to some of his earlier works and mapping it to an overview of the varieties of naturalism and the ‘transcendental naturalism’ that I have recently advocated in dialogue with William James, Heinrich Rickert and Bruno Latour. Drees distinguishes between ‘science-inspired naturalism’, ‘philosophical naturalism’ and ‘religious naturalism’. He argues for science-inspired naturalism and sees philosophical naturalism and religious naturalism as optional choices which are not necessarily implicated by science-inspired naturalism. I assess his claims on naturalism and science, naturalism and philosophy and naturalism and religion. I conclude that his work is compatible with my variety: transcendental naturalism. This means that science must be taken seriously, philosophy must as much as possible refrain from metaphysics and religion must take metaphysics on faith without resorting to supernaturalism.\n\nType: Book chapter Title: Willem Drees and the Varieties of Naturalism DOI: 10.1007/978-3-031-52292-5_6 Publisher version: https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-031-52292-5_6 Language: English Additional information: This version is the author accepted manuscript.
