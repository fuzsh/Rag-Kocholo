It is the highest distinction in this knighthood.\n\nThis royal honor is rarely awarded. Those who previously received it include former Prime Ministers Ruud Lubbers and Willem Drees, NOS reports. Royalty like Princess Beatrix and the British Queen Elizabeth have also received this award, as well as some foreign leaders like former German Chancellor Angela Merkel and former British Prime MInister Winston Churchill."
