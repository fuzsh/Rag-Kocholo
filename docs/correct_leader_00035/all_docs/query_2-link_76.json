        "text": "V.Roman or red?\n\nJust before the German invasion the catholics had finally relented and accepted a coalition with the social-democrats. After the war, they continued this policy, even though (or maybe exactly because) the social-democrats merged their party with two smaller ones. From 1946 to 1958 the so-called Roman-Red coalition of catholics and social-democrats ruled the country.\n\nAs we’ll see, this exact coalition was a vital necessity to the catholics. However, circumstances changed in the late 1950s, and the catholics, who by now thoroughly dominated protestant ARP and CHU, shifted to the right in a coalition with the VVD; a coalition that basically remained intact until 1989.\n\nIt seemed nothing could stop a total catholic take-over of state power — if the left wing could be kept safely roman instead of becoming red.\n\nBreakthrough\n\nJust after the liberation it seemed that the Dutch party system would undergo a radical transformation, the so-called Breakthrough, which was supposed to lead to a progressive majority in parliament. In order to understand this episode we first have to take a look at political activity during the occupation.\n\nNederlandsche Unie\n\nAs a reaction to the threatening nazification of the country, the Nederlandsche Unie (Dutch Union) was formed in 1940. It aimed at coming to an accomodation with the changed circumstances in Europe without falling into outright nazism.\n\nThe Union was an instant success. People from all denominations hurried to apply for membership, and the Union flag became a common sight throughout the country. The main reason for this success was that the Union was not the NSB. In the spirit of unity the Union was led by a catholic (future prime minister De Quay), a right-wing liberal, and a partyless man.\n\nInitially the occupiers withheld judgement; it was clear that the NSB was very impopular, and the Union might become a tool for mobilising the Dutch for Germany. When the Union leaders refused to remove all Jewish members and did not enthousiastically support the German invasion of Russia, the nazis had had enough and disbanded the Union in 1941.\n\nSt.-Michielsgestel\n\nStill, the Union had shown that the various denominations could work together towards a common goal, and this lesson was not forgotten, especially not among the younger party members.\n\nThe Germans took several high-ranking politicians hostage and interned them in camp St.-Michielsgestel, where they were treated decently. During their enforced stay they took to talking to each other and create plans for a new post-war political system that would do away with denominational segregation.\n\nEspecially among progressive politicians there was much talk of a breakthrough after the war. Progressives of all denominations would finally come together into one party, which would conquer the majority and change Dutch politics forever — or so it was imagined.\n\nAmbitious plans were drawn up, and SDAP party leader and future prime minister Drees, especially, started to work towards a new party that would include progressives from all four denominations — or so he hoped.\n\nLiberation\n\nWhen liberation came nearer, people started to become more enthusiastic about doing away with the old denominational segregation, and creating a new political order. This sentiment was especially strong among members of the resistance, from communists to anti-revolutionaries.\n\nThey were supported in their wishes by Queen Wilhelmina in London. She, whom Churchill called “the only man in Dutch government in exile,” had also become disgusted by partisanship and bickering, and wanted to restart the country with a clean slate.\n\nHowever, the geography of liberation intervened. In September 1944 the south was liberated, but the Allied armies stopped at the Rhine, and the north had to wait nine more months, As a result, the catholics were able to reinstate their iron grip and work on keeping the left wing, which might be interested in the planned Breakthrough, in hand.\n\nChanges\n\nThus the catholics stayed wholly outside the Breakthrough. However, among liberals and protestants there was some support for the idea, and the SDAP, the VDB, and small, left-wing christian CDU decided to merge into the PvdA.\n\nTogether, the three parties had held 31 seats in the last pre-war parliament. In the 1946 elections the PvdA won 29, a loss of two. However, communist CPN went from three to ten seats, buoyed as they were by their role in the resistance.\n\nIn the protestant camp there was some talk of a merger between ARP and CHU. Especially the anti-revolutionary resistance was in favour, but most CHU leaders, as well as some old-guard ARP leaders when they returned from German captivity, did not like the idea. The christian-historians were afraid of being overshadowed by the anti-revolutionaries, and the pro-union resistance leaders were too left-wing in the eyes of the returned party leaders. Thus ARP and CHU remained separate parties for thirty more years.\n\nThe Breakthrough made some inroads into the protestant camp. About four seats’ worth of left-wing protestant voters did go over to the socialist camp, never to return. Still, the originators of the Breakthrough line of thought had hoped for more. They had especially hoped for the same to happen to the catholic left.\n\nThe catholics, however, retained their unity. They kept the left wing on board succesfully. Still, there was a price to be paid. That price was cooperation with the left instead of the right.\n\nThe party landscape\n\nThus the number of major parties had gone down from six to five. Let’s briefly review them all before continuing with political history.\n\nKVP\n\nAfter the war, the RKSP changed its name to KVP (Katholieke Volkspartij; Catholic Popular Party). It was supposed to symbolise that henceforth the catholics would take better care of their left wing.\n\nIn 1946, with the first post-war government to be formed, the KVP allied with the social-democrats in the PvdA to form the Roman-Red coalitions. In 1958 they exchanged the PvdA for the VVD. In the end, these moves can be traced back to keeping the catholic left wing on board: vital just after the war, but less immediately pressing at the end of the fifties.\n\nIn the sixties many catholics decided that their faith wasn’t the all-encompassing sum of their lives, and that they weren’t required to vote KVP. The left wing started to defect to the PvdA, the right wing to the VVD. Before the sad and sorry end the once-proud KVP lost about half its voters, and with them its absolute power.\n\nThe party leadership responded to this disaster with a stroke of genius: the KVP should merge with its long-time protestant allies. This led to the creation of the CDA, which succesfully re-conquered the KVP’s centre position in Dutch politics.\n\nDutch political history is largely the history of the catholics’ hegemony, downfall, and reincarnation. This series of articles will discuss it in detail.\n\nPvdA\n\nThe merger of SDAP, VDB, and CDU into the PvdA (Partij van de Arbeid; Labour party) took place just before the 1946 elections. It was hoped that this new party would attract left-leaning catholics and anti-revolutionaries in addition to loyal SDAP and VDB voters, but that didn’t materialise.\n\nSimultaneously the CPN, still the thorn in the PvdA’s left flank, grew hugely from three to ten seats. Although the socialist denomination occupied a record number of seats, the PvdA was unable to force a true breakthrough, and entered the Roman-Red coalition with the KVP.\n\nFor the first time, the social-democrats participated in government for an extended period of time, and were transformed from an opposition party into a governmental party. The party leadership enthusiastically embraced the change, and accepted the fact that the party became responsible for a not-very-leftist austerity programme. This programme was clearly necessary just after the war, but remained in place for much of the fifties, even when the economy had recovered and started to boom.\n\nThe fourth and final Drees government (1956-1958) featured increasing tension between the social-democrats and their allies; notably the catholics. In the end Drees resigned over a relatively minor issue, and Roman-Red came to an end.\n\nAfterwards the PvdA slowly slid down because it had lost part of its appeal to the lower classes, and there were fewer lower class voters, anyway, with the growth of the middle class. Besides, the PvdA had not shown itself to be a true left-wing party when it ruled (which was admittedly hard in a coalition with catholics and protestants), and it lost part of its appeal.\n\nThe PvdA had to reinvent itself, and succeeded in doing so in the late sixties. We’ll discuss this period at length, too.\n\nARP\n\nAs to the two protestant parties, they remained what they had been, down to the party name, but had lost their central position in Dutch politics. The ARP, especially, was hard pressed to deal with the heritage of the 1930s, when it had been hard-right, and in addition it opposed Indonesian independence as the single of the five major parties. This caused an unusual spell in the opposition. It took until 1952 before it was re-admitted into the halls of power.\n\nDirectly after the war the ARP lost a lot of voters to the PvdA, and from 1952 to 1963 it again lost about a third of its voters. I have not been able to find an explanation for this atypical ARP pattern.\n\nHowever, the tide turned with the 1967 elections, when the party stabilised. This was partly caused by prime minister Zijlstra’s personal popularity, but the ARP remained more-or-less stable in the next ten years, when KVP and CHU folded. Apparently its mix of christian values and centrist-to-left politics continued to appeal to a lot of voters.\n\nCHU\n\nAs to the CHU, it was maybe the least-changed of all five parties. It continued to represent the classes it had historically represented, and became even more of a pragmatic, though protestant-right-wing, party.\n\nDespite an invitation to merge with the ARP, the CHU entered the 1946 elections alone, and it retained its pre-war score. Obviously, there was still demand for a christian-historian party distinct from an anti-revolutionary one.\n\nThe CHU remains by far the most obscure of the five major parties, and it’s hard to avoid the impression that this was exactly what the christian-historians wanted. They remained right wing as ever, but cooperated constructively with the other four parties.\n\nLike the KVP, it slid down during the late sixties, because its peculiar brand of politics had definitively become outdated and its following started to defect to the VVD, which the CHU had always resembled economically.\n\nVVD\n\nThe VVD (Volkspartij voor Vrijheid en Democratie; Popular Party for Freedom and Democracy) has occupied the moderate secular right wing of Dutch politics since 1948 as the successor of the pre-war VB.\n\nInitially the old VB had transformed itself into the PvdV (Partij van de Vrijheid; Freedom Party; this is the same name Wilders is currently using, and that is no coincidence). In 1948 former VDB leader Oud left the PvdA and took a large group of adherents with him. This Group Oud merged with the PvdV into the VVD, and promptly won two seats from the PvdA in the next elections.\n\nThe VVD was a party for the secular upper middle class, and held about the same amount of seats as the CHU that represented the protestant upper middle class. However, the VVD also appealed to the lower middle class, and as the fifties progressed, increasing prosperity made more and more lower class people make the jump to the middle class — and to the VVD in political matters.\n\nThe 1959 elections, when this trend first manifested itself, were the breakpoint for the VVD. It went from 13 to 19 seats, and that was a major victory back then. As a result the christian parties decided to ally with the liberals instead of the social-democrats, and thus started the period of centre-right governments that lasted for thirty years with only two breaks.\n\nThe VVD entered the sixties with an extended electoral base. Although its number of seats dropped slightly from the 19 of 1959, it was clear that the liberals had conquered a right-wing block of voters from the christians.\n\nThe centre-right coalition was ousted from power in the 1972 elections, even though the VVD made another historical jump to 22 seats. That was quite a lot for the early seventies, but nowadays this score is regarded as a minimum. When a VVD party leader gains only 22 seats he can expect quite a bit of criticism.\n\nWe’ll get back to the VVD later; we’ll take a look both at the new voters it acquired in the seventies, and to its role in the three-party system that forms the backbone of Dutch politics.\n\nRoman-red (1945-1958)\n\nIn the 1946 elections Dutch politics seemed to pick up much where it had left affairs in 1940. This was a deception especially to the newly-created PvdA, which had hoped for a true breakthrough. It aimed for the christian, especially the catholic workers, which had until now voted safely along church lines. This movement did not materialise.\n\nIn fact, the very party that was most vulnerable to such a breakthrough, the KVP, succesfully grasped the hegemony in Dutch politics. In a brilliant series of moves, the catholics both neutralised the socialist danger and grasped the leadership of the christian block from the ARP’s hands.\n\nIn order to appreciate the brilliant work of KVP leader Romme, we first have to concentrate on the dilemma the party found itself in.\n\nThe KVP’s dilemma\n\nAlone among the Dutch political parties, the KVP straddled the entire spectrum from moderate left to moderate right. Protestants had centrist ARP and right-wing CHU to choose from, the seculars left-wing PvdA and right-wing VVD. For the catholics, however, there was only the KVP.\n\nIf the KVP wasn’t social enough, working class catholics might defect en masse to the PvdA. If, on the other hand, the KVP became too left-wing, it might lose its (more affluent and influential) right wing.\n\nFinally, although the KVP was the largest party in the country and could take the initiative in coalition negotiations, it was so only by a small margin, and the second-largest party was the PvdA. If things went wrong on the left, it would lose voters exactly to its most serious national competitor.\n\nThe KVP couldn’t move left, it couldn’t move right, and any false move would mean slow death by electoral bleeding. Still, it was the largest party and it was forced to make a move.\n\nThe only real move was to co-opt the PvdA into government.\n\nMove to the left\n\nThis resulted in twelve years of roman-red coalitions. By making the PvdA responsible for government policy, the KVP neutralised the danger it was in. Sure, left wing catholics might be unhappy with government policy, but their obvious political alternative was also responsible for that policy.\n\nFurthermore, by agreeing to a coalition with only the PvdA, the KVP sent its old protestant allies a message. Welcome the new era, or get left out of government. No more hard-right policies or complaints about embassies (which, incidentally, had been restored in 1944).\n\nAs to the PvdA, it was eager to finally gain admittance to the halls of power, and party leaders understood that a very moderate course was called for, and never mind what the party rank and file thought.\n\nIndonesian independence\n\nThe major political issue of the late forties was the independence of Indonesia. During the confused situation just after World War II had ended Indonesian nationalists had taken power, and a vicious and bitter colonial war raged from 1945 to 1949.\n\nAlthough the PvdA hurriedly revised its moderate anti-colonial policies and sprang to the defense of our prized possesions in the East, the hopelessness of the Dutch position was eventually recognised.\n\nStill, no party wanted to take responsibility for signing away the East on its own. Because the constitution had to be amended in order to grant Indonesia its independence new elections were called in 1948. The KVP remained stable, the PvdA lost two seats. That was reassuring to the KVP.\n\nThe new government consisted of KVP, PvdA, CHU, and VVD. This government was broad enough to safely handle all tricky problems that might ensue from decolonisation. The ARP was left out because it would never agree to Indonesia’s independence. Besides, the KVP reinforced the message that it, and it alone, could bring any of the other parties into government.\n\nIn 1948 Queen Wilhelmina abdicated and was succeeded by her daughter Juliana.\n\nRebuilding the country\n\nIn order to rebuild the country, it was deemed essential to keep social unrest to a minimum. Wage increases, demands, and strikes could not be tolerated. The KVP found it comforting that a PvdA prime minister enforced all these rules.\n\nStill, in the 1952 elections the KVP lost two seats and the PvdA won three, bringing both to 30 seats. The KVP still had more votes, but this was a nasty surprise. The PvdA had to be even more tightly implicated in government.\n\nThe VVD was exchanged for the ARP. This was partly an economic move; the VVD was not enchanted by increasing state interference with the economy, and the ARP might be easier to work with in that regard.\n\nBreakthrough?\n\nWhen the 1956 elections loomed near, it became less and less clear whether KVP would remain the largest party in the country. To stem the tide, the bishops in 1954 threatened any catholic who was a member of a socialist organisation with excommunication; a move that was felt would return the straying left-wing sheep to the flock.\n\nInstead, the move backfired. Obviously the socialists protested this unwarranted intrusion of the church into politics. Less expected was that the moderate opinion among protestants and liberals also turned against the catholics. The KVP leadership had to backtrack a bit, and lost some face in the process.\n\nThe 1956 campaign was especially heated in the south, where prime minister Drees was threatened by catholic youngsters at one meeting. When the results came in, the PvdA had become the largest party. It had gained 50 seats in parliament (which had been enlarged to 150 seats), while the KVP held 49.\n\nThe PvdA had won. Breakthrough had come.\n\n... or had it? Now that the PvdA was the largest party, it had to form a government. But the only viable coalition partner was ... the KVP, which of course insisted on the participation of its by now thoroughly tamed wing lieutenants ARP and CHU.\n\nMove to the right\n\nThus nothing changed. A few catholic workers had made the crossing to the PvdA, and it didn’t matter one bit. The same coalition ruled on, with only the VVD in opposition.\n\nAs the economy improved, the government did not loosen the purse strings. Wages were kept low, the better to increase industrial output. Although that made some sense in a macro-economic context, the wishes of the workers were mostly disregarded. Until now, KVP and PvdA had been in this together.\n\nHowever, tension between KVP and PvdA grew, and the KVP started to attack the economic policy of the PvdA. the socialists became more and more annoyed with their coalition partner, until finally prime minister Drees resigned after one attack too many on a (relatively unimportant) part of the PvdA’s economic plans.\n\nEvidently, the alliance had ended. It was the KVP that emerged strongest from this fight, with its main competitor on the defense and its voters eager for a bit less state control of economy. Maybe it was time to move to the right.\n\nTwelve years of roman-red ended in 1958, and new elections were called. Until these elections, a caretaker government of the three christian parties showed that ruling the country does not require the PvdA.\n\nCentre-right (1958-1967)\n\nIn the 1959 elections the VVD won 6 seats, which was a major victory in those days. The coalition parties lost a few seats, except the KVP, which remained stable at 49. Because the PvdA had lost two, the KVP was once more the largest party in the country. It celebrated this fact by forming a centre-right government of the three christian parties and the VVD.\n\nBecause the economy boomed, the new government could afford to loosen its own purse strings as well as those of companies, and the trade unions finally got a substantial increase in wages. This also served to boost the purchasing power of the Dutch themselves and internal demand; something that had been sorely lacking during the roman-red period.\n\nA centre-left government being very stingy to workers and a centre-right one giving away higher wages was an odd sight, and it didn’t do the PvdA much good.\n\nThe 1963 elections\n\nIn the 1963 elections, the KVP won its best score ever of 50 seats, while the PvdA lost five. The centre-right coalition as a whole kept its majority, and a continuation of the coalition seemed logical.\n\nStill, its very position as the natural leader of the centre-right was a danger to the KVP. As usual, it worried about the left wing; even though the PvdA was sliding down, catholic workers might still defect to it and give it a new boost.\n\nThus, the PvdA initially had to be considered as a coalition partner, and ideally it had to resign from the negotiations by itself. Thus started a long and complicated game between the five parties, in which the KVP tried and failed to get the PvdA to break off negotiations. In the end, the KVP leader sent a short note to the PvdA leader, thanking him for his constructive work but announcing that a centre-right government would be formed anyway.\n\nThis was not an auspicious start. It would become worse before the end of this parliament.\n\nThe broadcast question\n\nThe Dutch broadcasting system was still roughly the same as in the early 1930s, with a catholic, a protestant, a socialist, and a “general” broadcasting corporation. The first three were tightly bound to the KVP, ARP, and PvdA, respectively, while the fourth had no political ties.\n\nThe big question in the mid-sixties was whether commercial (i.e. non-segregated) broadcasters should be allowed to enter the system. VVD and CHU, who didn’t have their own broadcasters to worry about and supported free entrepeneurship anyway, were in favour.\n\nKVP and ARP were against: the position of the catholic and protestant broadcasters would become too tenuous in a semi-commercial system. Eventually government fell over this question, with VVD and CHU leaving the coalition and the broadcast question more pressing than ever.\n\nThe obvious solution to the problem was a coalition of KVP and ARP with the PvdA, which could be relied upon to protect the interests of the socialist broadcasters. Thus the KVP exchanged centre-right for centre-left, and commercial television was postponed for twenty years.\n\nSchmelzer’s night\n\nWith the broadcast question solved, the KVP wouldn’t cry many tears over a break with the PvdA. It wanted to enter the 1967 elections free from all expectations, and wanted to keep both the centre-left and the centre-right options open.\n\nBesides, the differences between the KVP’s left and right wings became more pronounced. Prime minister Cals, a left-winger himself, readily agreed with the PvdA’s financial plans, which the right wing of the KVP opposed.\n\nThus party leader Schmelzer was in a tight position. He wanted to break with the PvdA, which would give him support of the right wing, but would upset the left wing. He tried to keep both sides happy by asking pointed questions of prime minister Cals, but refrained from the ultimate action: proposing a vote of no confidence, after which government would have to step down.\n\nPrime minister Cals as well as the PvdA explicitly asked for parliamentary support for the coalition’s plans. Thus the ante was upped; and the KVP was forced to declare itself instead of sticking to its usual centrist woolly non sequiturs.\n\nStill hoping to keep both left and right wing happy, Schmelzer produced a somewhat sharper motion that invited government to reconsider the financial situation, but hastened to add that this should in no way be viewed as a motion of no-confidence, and was not aimed against government’s composition (i.e. whether the KVP was In or Out).\n\nOpposition parties VVD and CHU immediately announced their support for the motion; they wouldn’t mind the fall of government and new elections.\n\nThe PvdA was thinking along similar lines. It insinuated that the motion’s meaning was clear: the KVP distrusted government. It hoped to put Schmelzer in a position where he had to choose between retracting his motion, losing face and possibly the right wing of his party, or take it to its logical conclusion and abandon his party members in government. Either way, the KVP lost and the PvdA won.\n\nSchmelzer’s motion passed. VVD, CHU, the small right-wing parties and the vast majority of the KVP voted for the motion and against government, while PvdA, ARP, the small left-wing parties and four KVP MPs supported government and voted against Schmelzer. Cals was forced to resign.\n\nDistrust between KVP and PvdA became rampant after this night, and it took the parties twenty-five years before they could discuss a possible coalition normally.\n\n1967\n\nA caretaker government of KVP and ARP was formed to lead the country until the next elections. Still, a lot was changing in Dutch politics, and all this came to a head in the 1967 elections.\n\nBecause the political system, and especially the KVP, had been so cynical in its handling of coalitions, a general sense of distrust was growing. The 1967 elections were the end of an era and the start of a new one.\n\nThe KVP lost eight seats, and it was hardly a consolation that the PvdA also lost six. Big winners were D66, a new party that succesfully occupied the old VDB niche, and protest party BP. Times were about to change.\n\nPower to the parties\n\nThe entire political system we just saw in action can only exist by the grace of party power.\n\nAll political moves and counter-moves we’ve discussed, as well as most of the ones that still lie in the future, are executed by the party leaders and their close cohorts, who know themselves supported by their MPs in parliament, and their voters throughout the country through the medium of the political party.\n\nThe parties are the glue that connects voters with similarly-minded professional politicians, and these politicians with a small group of leaders.\n\nThe problem is that the glue is opaque.\n\nVoters have no idea how they came to be represented by mr. X or mrs. Y; and even some party leaders (notably future prime minister Balkenende; CDA) were completely unknown to the general public at the time of their election.\n\nThe party leaders’ main job is to talk to each other and connect one group of voters and MPs to another. The problem is that while talking to each other they lose contact with their base (or are perceived to do so, which amounts to the same in politics).\n\nVoter-MP contact\n\nThere’s little contact between individual Dutch voters and MPs; a result of the party-list system in which the political parties decide which persons will represent the people in parliament. Thus, no Dutch voter has his own MP to contact if he wants something done.\n\nMembers of parliament have their party to thank for their seat; and a party that has been generous enough to put them highly enough on the party list to get elected is to be repaid with loyalty. Once the party decides to go one way, few individual MPs will disagree.\n\nAn individual MP has little legitimacy; most of them won a few hundred; or at best a few thousand votes personally and were elected on the coat-tails of their well-known national party leaders.\n\nDistrict system\n\nThe most obvious way of changing this state of affairs is returning to the district system that was abolished in 1918. There, actual persons would have to compete for votes from other actual persons they’d meet frequently during election time. The MP would be the true representative of a group of voters.\n\nEven CDA and PvdA, who as largest parties stand most to gain, have always resisted a district system staunchly; probably more for the breakdown of party power it would bring than in solidarity with the smaller parties. After forty years of discussion it’s clear we’re not going back to the district system.\n\nMonism\n\nA consequence of the lack of legitimacy of individual MPs is that government and parliament are tightly bound together, even though theory says they should form the two opposite poles of the political system.\n\nMinisters frequently apply pressure to the MPs of their party in order to get their votes for measures and policies that are not quite in agreement with the party’s stated goals and platform. Because MPs have little personal legitimacy and are totally dependent on their party for their future career, they’ll give in easily.\n\nAs a result, most power lies with government, or rather, with the decisions of the leaders of the coalition parties.\n\nCoalition\n\nWhile Dutch voters can vote for a party, they cannot vote for the coalition(s) they want that party to participate in. Only before 1918 was there a clear distinction between the christian and the secular blocks; afterwards there were many coalition possibilities.\n\nSome right-wing PvdA voters will want a CDA coalition, while left-wingers would prefer cooperation with the left. However, both groups can only vote PvdA and hope for the best. Then the party leaders will come together and decide who’s going to rule the country.\n\nElected prime minister\n\nWithin the framework of proportional representation, some popular influence on the coalition could be provided by an elected prime minister. Being chosen by popular vote, this individual would have enough democratic legitimacy to form the government best suited to execute his platform, and search for a majority in parliament only later.\n\nThis idea, obviously taken from the US constitution, would allow voters to elect the executive and separate the legislative and executive branches better.\n\nContinue"
