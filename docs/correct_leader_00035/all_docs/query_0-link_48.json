        "text": "Klompé became the first female member of the European Coal and Steel Community’s Common Assembly, the forerunner of today’s European Parliament, which held its first session in 1952.\n\nShe left the Assembly in 1956 to join the Dutch centre-left coalition government, headed by Prime Minister Willem Drees. She was appointed as Minister of Social Work, becoming the Netherlands’ first female minister.\n\nIn 1955, Klompé was appointed to a working party set up by the Common Assembly that focused on:\n\nimproving the operation and extending the powers of the European Coal and Steel Community\n\ncreating a single market that extended beyond the coal and steel sector.\n\nOne of her biggest achievements as Minister was the country’s first law on universal social protection.\n\nMarga Klompé during a debate in the Dutch House of Representatives"
