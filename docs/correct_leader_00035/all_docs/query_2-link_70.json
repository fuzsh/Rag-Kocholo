        "text": "It's not green cheese, but it might as well be.\n\nThe Dutch national museum said yesterday that one of its prized possessions, a rock supposedly brought back from the moon by U.S. astronauts, is just a piece of petrified wood.\n\nRijksmuseum spokeswoman Xandra van Gelder, who oversaw the investigation that proved the piece was a fake, said that the museum will keep it anyway as a curiosity.\n\n\"It's a good story, with some questions that are still unanswered,\" she said. \"We can laugh about it.\"\n\nThe museum acquired the rock after the death of former Prime Minister Willem Drees in 1988. Drees received it as a private gift on Oct. 9, 1969 from then-U.S. ambassador J. William Middendorf during a visit by the three Apollo 11 astronauts, part of their \"Giant Leap\" goodwill tour after the first moon landing.\n\nMiddendorf, who lives in Rhode Island, told Dutch broadcaster NOS news that he had gotten it from the U.S. State Department, but couldn't recall the exact details.\n\n\"I do remember that (Drees) was very interested in the little piece of stone,\" the NOS quoted Middendorf as saying. \"But that it's not real, I don't know anything about that.\"\n\nThe rock is not usually on display; the museum is primarily known for its paintings and other works of fine art by such masters as Rembrandt.\n\nA jagged fist-size stone with reddish tints, it was mounted and placed above a plaque that said, \"With the compliments of the Ambassador of the United States of America ... to commemorate the visit to The Netherlands of the Apollo-11 astronauts.\" The plaque does not specify that the rock came from the moon's surface.\n\nIt was given at the opening of an exhibition on space exploration.\n\nIt was on show in 2006, and a space expert informed the museum it was unlikely that NASA would have given away any moon rocks three months after Apollo returned to Earth.\n\nGeologist Frank Beunk said that the rock, which the museum at one point insured for more than half a million dollars, was worth no more than $70.\n\nBe the first to know\n\nGet local news delivered to your inbox!\n\n* I understand and agree that registration on or use of this site constitutes agreement to its user agreement and privacy policy."
