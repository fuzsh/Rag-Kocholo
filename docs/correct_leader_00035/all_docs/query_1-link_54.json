        "text": "In 1949, at the official commissioning of the Colex cipher machine between five embassies and the Dutch Foreign Office in The Hague, Oberman was decorated Officier in de Orde van Oranje-Nassau (Officer of the Order of Orange-Nassau) by Dutch Prime Minister Willem Drees.\n\nApart from cipher machines, Oberman also developed an allotment machine for the Dutch State Lottery (Staatsloterij), which was a spin-off from the Erolet key tape generator that he had developed for the Colex and Ecolex cipher machines. In 1947, whilst working at PTT, Oberman became a teaching assignment at the Delft University of Technology, where in 1949 he became an extaordinary professor. In 1958, he left the Dr. Neher Lab of the PTT to become full time Professor at Delft University, where he lectured switching technology – at the time the building blocks of telephone switches and cipher machines – until his retirement in 1980.\n\nDuring his lifetime, Oberman filed more than 90 patents, most of which were registered in multiple countries, including Germany, the UK and the USA. Many of his inventions involved (telephone) switching systems, for which the patents were filed on behalf of the Dutch State or the PTT. Philips Usfa filed 9 patents in which Oberman and Snijders are listed as the inventors.\n\n➤ Full biography The question finally landed on Oberman's desk in 1946/47, as he was responsible for telegraphy matters within the PTT. This led to the development of the Colex machine — Codetelex — which, after two trial versions, met the requirement of all parties involved. Colex was a One-Time Tape cipher machine – a practical implementation of the unbreakable One-Time Pad (OTP) for use in telegraphy communications – and consisted of two parts: a mixer and a key generator. When the latter meets the requirements of true randomness, the system can be proven mathematically to be (forever) unbreakable. The first implementation was completely relay-based, due to the post-war lack of electronic components, and was capable of encrypting just 3 characters per second.\n\nThe disadvantage of One-Time Tape is the problem of key distribution. Based on the Vernam Cipher, the key has to be at least as long as the message, and can only be used once, to prevent successful cryptanalytic attacks. Furthermore, it cannot be used by multiple parties and must be destroyed after use. A stringent procedure is required for generating and distributing the key tapes, but it was (and still is) the only way to technically ensure that State Secrets are kept secret.\n\nThe mixing part of the Colex (i.e. the mixer) was constructed with approx. 100 electromechanical relays that mix each letter of the plaintext with a character from the key tape, using an operation that was carried out with a mix and unmix feature. Several years later this became known as the exlusive-OR operation (XOR), also known as modulo-2 addition. If both parties have the same key tape and use it from the same starting position onwards (i.e. synchronised), the recipient has to perform the same XOR operation in order to reveal the plaintext again.\n\nOne of the critical parts of the system is the key generator, which Oberman had named Roulette. Facing the lack of electronic parts immediately after the war, he composed a creative solution to obtain and control randomness of the key production in the Colex system. It comprises a 400 kHz oscillator of which the output is divided by 2 in five stages. Each stage produces one of the five bits of the ITA2 telegraph alphabet (Baudot), whilst a relay is used to sample the output at ~225 ms intervals. The uncertainty of the movement of the electromechanical relay is used as the source of randomness (noise). To check whether the noise was evenly distributed, a set of five electromechanical counters were connected to the machine, allowing the user to check whether each of the five output bits appeared on the key tape an (approximate) equal number of times.\n\nThe Colex was built by a small team under Oberman, and was put into service in on 5 April 1949 by Dutch Prime Minister Willem Drees. It was used for communication between the Foreign Office and the embassies in London (UK), Paris (France), Washington (USA) and Jakarta (Indonesia).\n\n➤ More about Colex"
