        "text": "In this detached building in Amstelveen there is still 1,600m2 available, divided over two floors. The area is characterized by the fact that both Canon and the Chamber of Commerce are housed here. Thanks to the bus stops in front of the door, the location is easily accessible by public transport. There are also several parking spaces on site.\n\nRental prices\n\nThere are different floors to rent in this building. There is 500m2 available on the 1st floor and 1,100m2 on the 3rd. Part rental is negotiable.\n\nOffice space: € 125.00 per m², excl. service costs, excl. VAT\n\nParking space : € 800.00 excl. VAT, per place, per year.\n\nThe above prices are payable quarterly in advance.\n\nFacilities\n\nIf you are a tenant within this office concept, you will receive a monthly percentage of the rent paid in credits. By means of a special application it is possible to reserve a meeting room and/or order food and drinks with the accrued credits. These credits can be spent at all locations of this landlord, ideal if you have a meeting at a different location.\n\nLocation and accessibility\n\nThe object is easily accessible by both public transport and private transport. For example, the A9 is within 5 minutes of the building, as is the city center of Amstelveen. With public transport you can easily reach Amsterdam via various bus and tram connections. This way you can go from door to door to the Zuidas within 30 minutes."
