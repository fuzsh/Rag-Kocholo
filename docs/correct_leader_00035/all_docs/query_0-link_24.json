Supomo at lunch today recounted experiences Hague on preliminary discussion revision RTC. He said PriMin Drees1 unwilling admit possibility his govt agreeing to abrogation RTC prior elections June 1952 unless acceptable substitute agreement reached in advance elections. Even then Drees wld prefer postpone negots until after elections. Supomo said Catholic leader Romns2 agreeable to immediate negots. Decision reached that Neth and Indo Govts shld each appoint small comite to draft working papers on replace agreement. Said Comites will meet in Paris in Nov at time UNGA and pursue their joint deliberations there and/or Hague.\n\nSupomo expects head Indo comite with few econ and legal advisors. Thinks Blom3 and Goetzen4 will be principal Neth Comitemen. Supomo said he hoped negots cld be expedited. Drees had countered that absolutely impossible have any plenary conf in 1951. Supomo regretted Dec might pass again without Irian question being resolved. Neth officials inquired whether Indos wld still make trouble for Neth on Irian if Neth gave acceptable agreement on RTC. Supomo said Indo claim on Irian wld still remain and while Indo Govt wld not itself resort to coercive tactics there was always possibility Indo people might demonstrate their unhappiness. Supomo emphasized necessity solving both Irian and RTC questions. He said US cld be most helpful if it wld oppose any delaying tactics on part Neth Govt in negots on RTC. Supomo also hoped some constructive support on part US for Indo claim to Irian wld follow Subardjo’s visit to US.\n\nWhen Supomo asked Neth negotiators what criteria they envisaged in replace agreement Neth replied they felt there shld still be special relationship between Neth and Indo and former wld not be satisfied simply by most-favored-nation treatment. Supomo did not tell me just what he replied but made clear to me Indo wld not countenance continuation any union organs and wld have to keep in mind relations with other friendly powers when deciding what treatment to accord Neth."
