        "text": "Making every day count.\n\nBruce Willis’ wife, Emma Heming Willis, posted a photo celebrating their anniversary amid his heartbreaking health battle.\n\n“16 years with this special man. My love and adoration for him only grows,” Emma, 45, captioned the Instagram photos on Wednesday.\n\nIn the images, she kisses his cheek and embraces him while he wears a straw hat and shorts, looking happy and relaxed.\n\nHeming later shared an Instagram Story with her followers, speaking directly to the camera.\n\n“How do I really feel about today? Well, how do I look?” she asked. “I just got off the phone with a really dear girlfriend of mine who I was able to have a good cry with. It is really important to be able to have someone that you can trust with your feelings. Instead of just bottling them up and putting your best foot forward and sort of just soldiering through stuff, which I have a tendency to do.”\n\n“Holidays are hard. Anniversaries are hard,” she continued. “But for me this year it has really been about community, building a community and connection. And I just want to say that’s been my lifeline and I just want to thank you for that.”\n\nWillis, 68, reportedly met Heming at their mutual trainer’s gym in 2007, and they tied the knot in 2009.\n\nIn March 2022, the “Die Hard” star’s family revealed that the prolific actor was retiring after being diagnosed with aphasia.\n\nIn February 2023, his loved ones further revealed that his condition had worsened and that he had been diagnosed with frontotemporal dementia.\n\n“While this is painful, it is a relief to finally have a clear diagnosis,” the family said on the Association for Frontotemporal Degeneration website.\n\n“FTD is a cruel disease that many of us have never heard of and can strike anyone. For people under 60, FTD is the most common form of dementia, and because getting the diagnosis can take years, FTD is likely much more prevalent than we know.”\n\nThe statement was signed by Willis’ ex-wife, Demi Moore, 61 — who was married to him from 1987 to 2000 — Heming and all five of his daughters.\n\nAdditionally, they noted that if the “Sixth Sense” star “could” respond to his situation, he would want to help spread awareness and bring “global attention and connectedness” to others suffering from the “debilitating disease.”\n\nMoore and their daughters — Rumer, 35, Scout, 32, and Tallulah, 29 — as well as Emma and their daughters — Mabel, 11, and Evelyn, 9 — are reportedly trying to soak up as much time as they can with him.\n\n“Bruce has good days and bad days, but in the last two months, there are many more bad days than good,” one insider told Us Weekly earlier this month.\n\n“This experience has brought the whole family even closer together. No one knows how much time Bruce has left,” the source claimed.\n\n“Moonlighting” creator Glenn Gordon Caron, who is still good friends with the series star, previously revealed that Willis is not “totally verbal.”\n\n“I have tried very hard to stay in his life,” he told The Post in October.\n\n“He’s an extraordinary person. The thing that makes [his disease] so mind-blowing is [that] if you’ve ever spent time with Bruce Willis, there is no one who had any more joie de vivre than he,” Caron continued. “He loved life and … just adored waking up every morning and trying to live life to its fullest.\n\n“My sense is the first one to three minutes he knows who I am. He used to be a voracious reader — he didn’t want anyone to know that — and he’s not reading now. All those language skills are no longer available to him, and yet he’s still Bruce.”"
