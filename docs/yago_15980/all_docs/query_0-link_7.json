I call this the 'remarkable reframe.' What I know is there is so much to celebrate. Our union and connection is probably stronger than ever.\"\n\n\"We have two bright, fun and healthy daughters,\" Emma—who shares Mabel Willis, 10, and Evelyn Willis, 8, with Bruce—continued. \"We have a family unit that is built on mutual respect and admiration. And simply, I just love and adore the man I married. I'm so proud of what we have and continue to create.\""
