In the video, which she described as a care partner public service announcement, Emma Heming admitted that taking care of a loved one can take a toll on a person.\n\n\"I don’t want it to be misconstrued that, like, I’m good, because I’m not. I’m not good,\" she said. \"But, I have to put my best foot forward for the sake of myself and my family.\"\n\nSEE MORE: Bruce Willis' family says actor has frontotemporal dementia\n\nEmma Heming went on to encourage others to prioritize their own health, just as much as they do for their loved ones.\n\n\"When we are not looking after ourselves, we cannot look after anyone that we love,\" she said.\n\nThe Willis family announced in February that Bruce's health was declining and he was diagnosed with frontotemporal dementia.
