        "text": "Bruce Willis’ wife, Emma Heming, celebrated the actor’s 69th birthday Tuesday with a touching tribute.\n\n“Just like you, we simply adore him,” the former model, 45, told her Instagram followers. “What you might not know, but maybe you could imagine, that being wrapped in his arms is the safest place in this whole wide world.”\n\nHeming went on to call Willis “a true gentle-man” with “so much love to give and share.”\n\n“That’s what I get to see, his true core,” she concluded her post.\n\n“I can tell you, it’s so pure and ever so good. Happy Birthday my love. You are the gift that keeps giving.”\n\nIn the accompanying throwback photo, the “Die Hard” star smiled while holding one of the couple’s two daughters.\n\nIn addition to Mabel, 11, and Evelyn, 9, Willis is the father of Rumer, 35, Scout, 32, and Tallulah, 30, with his ex-wife, Demi Moore.\n\nThe “Ghost” star, 61, and her daughters have all showed their support for Bruce since helping reveal his frontotemporal dementia diagnosis in February 2023.\n\nThe following month, the movie star’s family members felt “grief and sadness” while celebrating his 68th birthday.\n\nHeming, who wed Bruce in 2009, admitted via Instagram at the time that she “started the morning by crying.”\n\nThe “Moonlighting” alum was initially diagnosed with aphasia and announced a step back from his decades-long acting career in March 2022."
