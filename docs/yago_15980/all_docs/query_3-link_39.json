        "text": "Emma Heming rushed to her husband Bruce Willis’ defense after it was reported that there’s “no more joy” in him amid his battle with dementia.\n\nIn a heated video posted on Instagram Sunday, the actress shared how she came across a “clickbaited” article about the “Die Hard” actor, 68, and her family.\n\n“The headline basically says there is no more joy in my husband. Now, I can just tell you, that is far from the truth,” Heming, 45, said. “I need society and whoever’s writing these stupid headlines to stop scaring people.\n\n“Stop scaring people to think that once they get a diagnosis of some kind of neurocognitive disease that –that’s it. ‘It’s over. Let’s pack it up — Nothing else to see here. We’re done.’ No, it’s the complete opposite of that.”\n\nHeming explained that there is “a lot of” both “grief and sadness” as her family continues to navigate Willis’ frontotemporal dementia diagnosis, but also a lot of love, connection and joy.\n\n“That’s where we are,” she continued. “So stop with these stupid headlines. These stupid clickbaity things that freak people out. Stop doing that. There’s nothing to see here, okay?”\n\nThe mom of two also took to the caption of the clip to explain her experience, writing, “Two things can be true and exist at the same time. Grief and deep love. Sadness and deep connection. Trauma and resilience.\n\n“I had to get out of my own way to get here but once I arrived, life really started to come together with meaning and I had a true sense of purpose. There is so much beauty and soulfulness in this story.”\n\nFor more Page Six you love…\n\nListen to our weekly “We Hear” podcast\n\nShop our exclusive merch\n\nIn March 2022, Willis’s family announced he would be stepping away from acting following his diagnosis with aphasia, which is a brain disorder that affects language comprehension and speech, per Mayo Clinic.\n\nHowever, a year later, it was revealed the “Pulp Fiction” star’s condition evolved into dementia.\n\nHeming has come together with her and Willis’ two daughters Mabel, 11, and Evelyn, 9, along with the actor’s ex-wife, Demi Moore, and their shared daughters, Rumer, 35, Scout, 32, and Tallulah, 30, to support him.\n\n“Once Bruce was diagnosed, everyone came together to keep his memory of the family intact,” an insider told Us Weekly in December.\n\n“They’re all there all the time,” the source added. “This experience has brought the whole family even closer together.”\n\nMoore, 61, even briefly opened up about the journey, claiming it was “important” to be “present” with dementia patients and “meet” them where they are as she regularly spends time with Willis.\n\n“When you let go of who they’ve been or who you think, or even who you would like them to be, you can then really stay in the present and take in the joy and the love that is present and there for all that they are –– not all that they’re not.”"
