        "text": "Emma Heming sat down for her first official TV interview since husband Bruce Willis’ dementia diagnosis was made public, admitting that it’s “hard to know” whether the actor is aware of his condition and deteriorating health.\n\nThe former model appeared on the “Today” show Monday – alongside Susan Dickinson, CEO of the Association for Frontotemporal Degeneration – to help kick off World Frontotemporal Dementia Awareness Week.\n\n“Dementia is hard,” Heming, 45, confessed to “Today” co-anchor Hoda Kotb.\n\n“It’s hard on the person diagnosed, it’s also hard on the family. And that is no different for Bruce, or myself, or our girls. When they say this is a family disease, it really is.”\n\nIn March 2022, Willis’ family publicly revealed that he’d been diagnosed with aphasia, a condition that affects a person’s language processing and communication abilities.\n\nWillis also stepped away from acting at the time.\n\nThen, in February 2023, Willis’ family revealed that his condition had “progressed” and that he’d been diagnosed with frontotemporal dementia.\n\nHeming, who proudly calls herself Willis’ “care partner,” said learning of the “Die Hard” actor’s diagnosis “was the blessing and the curse.”\n\nShe explained, “To finally understand what was happening, so that I could be into the acceptance of what is. It doesn’t make it any less painful, but just being … in the know of what is happening to Bruce makes it a little easier.”\n\nHeming, who shares daughters Mabel, 11, and Evelyn, 9, with the actor, said Willis’ diagnosis is “teaching them so much – how to love, how to care, and it’s a really beautiful thing amongst the sadness.”\n\nFor more Page Six you love…\n\nListen to our weekly “We Hear” podcast\n\nShop our exclusive merch\n\nStill, none of this has been easy on the family. In August 2023, Heming took to Instagram to tell her followers that she always tries to “look for something beautiful” in her “stressful” days.\n\nShe said, “I know it looks like I’m out living my best life, [but] I have to make a conscious effort every single day to live the best life that I can. I do that for myself, I do that for our two children and [I do that for] Bruce, who would not want me to live any other way. So I don’t want it to be misconstrued that I’m good, ’cause I’m not. I’m not good.”\n\nHeming added that she tries to put her “best foot forward” each day. However, she admitted that it’s a daily task that “does not come to [her] easily,” but it’s one she feels is “really important” for “the sake of [herself] and [her] family.”\n\nHeming and Willis, 68, tied the knot in March 2009 before renewing their vows in 2019.\n\nThe actor was married to his first wife, 60-year-old actress Demi Moore, from November 1987 to October 2000. They are parents to daughters Rumer, 34, Scout, 32, and Tallulah, 29."
