        "text": "Bruce Willis' wife Emma Heming Willis has denied reports that the actor's ex-wife Demi Moore is living with the couple.\n\nIt was reported that Moore had moved in with the couple after the actor was diagnosed with dementia, but Emma Heming Willis has shut this down on social media.\n\n\"Let's nip this one in the bud,\" she wrote on an Instagram Story, sharing the article headline.\n\n\"This is so dumb. Please stop.\"\n\nDemi Moore and Bruce Willis' post-divorce relationship\n\nThe story about Moore raised eyebrows, even though they have remained friendly since their divorce in 2000, following 13 years of marriage.\n\nThey had three children together, while the actor now has two more daughters with Emma Heming Willis.\n\nWhen Emma Heming Willis and Bruce Willis renewed their vows for their 10th wedding anniversary, they wanted Moore there.\n\nTheir family often spend time together and have been supporting each other in the wake of the diagnosis.\n\nEmma Heming Willis is fed up with the press\n\nThis isn't the first time this week that Emma Heming Willis has hit out at the media.\n\nEarlier this week, she urged paparazzi to stop following him around so much and to stop shouting at him as he goes about his business.\n\n\"It's clear that there's still a lot of education that needs to be put forth,\" she wrote.\n\n\"So this one is going out to the photographers and the video people that are trying to get those exclusives of my husband out and about.\n\n\"Just keep your space. I know this is your job, but maybe just keep your space.\n\n\"For the video people, please don't be yelling at my husband asking him how he's doing or whatever - the woohoo-ing and the yippee ki yays ... just don't do it. OK?\n\n\"Give him his space. Allow for our family or whoever's with him that day to be able to get him from point A to point B safely.\""
