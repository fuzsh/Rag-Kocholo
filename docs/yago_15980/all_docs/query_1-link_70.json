        "text": "Birthday Adoration\n\nIn celebration of the patriarch’s 68th birthday in March 2023, Demi Moore shared a sweet video on Instagram. The former couple, Emma Heming, and daughters Rumer, Scout, Tallulah, Mabel, and Evelyn stood around a kitchen island singing a jolly rendition of “Happy Birthday” to Bruce Willis.\n\n“Happy birthday, BW!” Moore wrote in the caption. “So glad we could celebrate you today. Love you and love our family. Thank you to everyone for the love and warm wishes — we all feel them.”\n\nThe Charlie’s Angel actress shared a similar tribute to the Die Hard star the previous year. Alongside a photo of the two laughing, Moore wrote, “Happy birthday, Bruce! Thankful for our blended family.”\n\nA United Front\n\nWhen Bruce Willis’ aphasia diagnosis was announced in 2021, it was penned by Emma Heming, Demi Moore, Rumer Willis, Scout Willis, Tallulah Willis, Mabel Willis, and Evelyn Willis. The Instagram message read, “To Bruce’s amazing supporters, as a family we wanted to share that our beloved Bruce has been experiencing some health issues and has recently been diagnosed with aphasia, which is impacting his cognitive abilities. As a result of this and with much consideration Bruce is stepping away from the career that has meant so much to him.”\n\nThe group’s digital letter continued, “This is a really challenging time for our family and we are so appreciative of your continued love, compassion and support. We are moving through this as a strong family unit, and wanted to bring his fans in because we know how much he means to you, as you do to him. As Bruce always says, ‘Live it up’ and together we plan to do just that.” It was signed, “Love, Emma, Demi, Rumer, Scout, Tallulah, Mabel, & Evelyn,” and each woman shared the post on their respective Instagram accounts.\n\n‘Mothers United, Sisters Bonded’\n\nDemi Moore took to Instagram to pen a touching tribute to Emma Heming for International Women’s Day in 2021. The G.I. Jane star began, “@emmahemingwillis: I #SeeHer as family who I am honored to call a friend. Our children are sisters and yet there is no name for what our family connection is to one another. We are mothers united, sisters bonded on this crazy adventure of life.”\n\nMoore continued, “Emma is a beautiful mother dedicated to her family, an absolutely gorgeous woman and now she can add business entrepreneur to her resume. She carved a path quietly on her own to create @cocobabaofficial, launching the first body skincare products for woman to mother themselves! We all need that!” She lovingly concluded, “Her drive, determination and passion is uplifting and the woman that she is absolutely inspiring.”\n\nOpen Arms (and Open Hearts)\n\nWhen Willis and Heming renewed their vows for their 10th anniversary, they both wanted Moore to be present. At the time, Heming told Us Weekly, “She welcomed me into her family like I welcomed her into ours. I have so much respect for how Bruce and Demi worked through their divorce to be able to put their children first. I learned so much from that and grew so much from watching that. It was important for her to be there.”\n\nAfter the renewal, Heming shared a few family portraits from the ceremony on her Instagram Story. In addition to the five Willis daughters and various other family members, Moore was seated for the anniversary photos."
