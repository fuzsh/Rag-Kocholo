        "text": "Bruce Willis’ wife Emma Heming Willis has opened up about her state of mind this Christmas period, which has coincided with the couple’s 16th anniversary.\n\nIt’s understood the health of her husband, who is battling frontotemporal dementia (FTD), has deteriorated significantly in recent weeks.\n\n“How do I really feel about today? Well, how do I look? Think this about sums it up,” she said to her 900,000 Instagram followers.\n\nKnow the news with the 7NEWS app: Download today\n\n“I just got off the phone with a really dear girlfriend of mine who I was able to have a good cry with.\n\n“It is really important to be able to have someone that you can trust with your feelings instead of just bottling them up and putting your best foot forward and just kind of soldiering through stuff, which I have a tendency to do.”\n\nHeming Willis said that while times had been tough, holidays and anniversaries were particularly “hard”.\n\n“But for me, this year, it has really been about community, building a community and connection. And I just want to say that has been my lifeline and I just want to thank you for that.”\n\nOn Wednesday, Heming Willis paid tribute to her husband in an Instagram post to mark their 16th anniversary.\n\n“16 years with this special man,” she wrote alongside two photos of her and Willis kissing each other’s cheeks.\n\n“My love and adoration for him only grows.”\n\nThe 45-year-old also showed her love on her Instagram Story, resharing her post with the caption, “16 years together?! Lord where did the time go,” and in a subsequent slide, “Smitten.”\n\nWillis and Heming Willis — who share daughters Mabel, 11, and Evelyn, 9, in addition to Willis’ three daughters Rumer, 35, Scout, 32, and Tallulah, 29 with ex-wife Demi Moore — tied the knot in 2009.\n\nIn recent years, their blended family has been candid about the actor’s struggles with frontotemporal dementia, a more specific diagnosis he received in February after previously being diagnosed with aphasia in 2022.\n\nThe 68-year-old is having “more bad days than good,” a source close to the family recently told Us Weekly.\n\n“Bruce has good days and bad days, but in the last two months, there are many more bad days than good,” the source said.\n\n“This experience has brought the whole family even closer together.\n\n“No one knows how much time Bruce has left, so they’re soaking up every moment they get with him.”\n\n‘I struggle with guilt’\n\nSince his diagnosis, Heming Willis has kept followers updated about her husband’s condition, talking openly about being his carer.\n\nIn one recent heartbreaking confession, she admitted she sometimes felt “guilt” about having access to support that others may not have.\n\n“I struggle with guilt, knowing I have resources that others don’t,” she wrote in a candid personal essay for Maria Shriver’s The Sunday Paper in November.\n\n“When I’m able to get out for a hike to clear my head, it’s not lost on me that not all care partners can do that.\n\n“When what I share about our family’s journey gets press attention, I know that there are thousands of untold, unheard stories, each of them deserving of compassion and concern.\n\n“At the same time, I see that what I share matters to others who may be struggling, and in a small way makes them feel seen and understood.\n\n“I want people to know that when I hear from another family affected by FTD, I hear our family’s same story of grief, loss, and immense sadness echoed in theirs.\n\n“It’s important to be an advocate on behalf of those families who don’t have the time, energy, or resources to advocate for themselves.”\n\nShe admitted during an interview with the US Today show that it was “hard to know” if her husband was aware of his diagnosis.\n\n- With NBC"
