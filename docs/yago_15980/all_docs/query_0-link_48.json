You are the gift that keeps giving,” she added.\n\nWillis’ ex Moore, who was married to the actor from 1987 to 2000, shared a photo of the two of them clasping hands, writing, “Happy birthday, BW!

Lou (Willis’ granddaughter) loves you so big.”\n\nScout, 32, called her dad “a tender, moody, beautiful, very Piscean man, whose depth of love for his family can only be felt, not articulated.”\n\n“Wild how so little has changed even though so much has changed. My dad is one of my best friends, perhaps now on a deeper level than ever honestly.
