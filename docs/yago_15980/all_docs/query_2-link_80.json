        "text": "Bruce Willis is a movie star whose biggest hits include Die Hard and The Sixth Sense\n\nHe shares 3 daughters with his ex-wife Demi Moore and two with his current wife Emma Heming\n\nThe actor’s cognitive abilities have been in decline, as he was diagnosed with aphasia in 2022 and frontotemporal dementia in 2023\n\nBruce Willis’ family revealed in February 2023 that the star’s condition had taken a turn for the worse. “Since we announced Bruce’s diagnosis of aphasia in spring 2022, Bruce’s condition has progressed and we now have a more specific diagnosis: frontotemporal dementia (known as FTD),” the actor’s family said in a statement on the Association for Frontotemporal Degeneration website. “Unfortunately, challenges with communication are just one symptom of the disease Bruce faces. While this is painful, it is a relief to finally have a clear diagnosis.”\n\nThe statement, signed by Bruce’s ex-wife Demi Moore, their three daughters Rumer, 34, Scout, 31, and Tallulah, 29 and his current wife Emma Heming, went on to say that there is currently “no treatment for the disease,” but that the family believes Bruce will continue to have a fulfilling life, especially with the support from fans. “We have been so moved by the love you have all shared for our dear husband, father, and friend during this difficult time,” the statement concluded. “Your continued compassion, understanding, and respect will enable us to help Bruce live as full a life as possible.”\n\nBruce and Demi have had a very amicable relationship since they divorced in 2000 after thirteen years of marriage. The former couple and their three daughters have become quite close and spend many a holiday together. Since the split, Demi has gone on to marry and divorce Ashton Kutcher, while Bruce married Emma in 2009. Find out more about Emma, below.\n\nWhere is Emma from?\n\nEmma arrived on June 18, 1978. “I was born on the small but beautiful island of Malta to a Guyanese mother and an English father,” she wrote on her website emmahemingwillis.com. “At a young age, my parents divorced, and my mom and I moved to London for a few years to be closer to her family, and then relocated to Southern California where we settled until I finished school.”\n\nShe revealed her mom had entered her in a modeling competition in London called “The British Elle Supermodel” in the early 90s. “For the next 15 years I had the privilege of walking the runways in New York, Paris, and Milan for Karl Lagerfeld, Chanel, Valentino, Ralph Lauren, Giorgio Armani, Emanuel Ungaro, Dior, and Victoria’s Secret,” she wrote.\n\nEmma also worked on campaigns for Dior, Clairol and Redken and had “good fortune” to be photographed by “some of the best and most gifted photographers in the business” such as Patrick Demarchelier, Annie Lebowitz, Steven Klein, and Tyen.\n\nHow did she meet Bruce?\n\nThe couple had a meet-cute that was just as adorable as themselves. “In 2007, I met my husband-to-be, Bruce, at our mutual trainer’s gym. Two years later we got married at our home in Turks and Caicos,” she revealed on her blog. In 2012, the couple welcomed their first daughter Mabel Ray. Two years later, Mabel’s baby sister Evelyn Penn was born. Emma is clearly head over heels for her baby girls, as she loves to share updates on Mabel and Evelyn to her Instagram.\n\nEmma thanked fans for their support after Bruce’s diagnosis\n\nOne day after the family revealed Bruce’s initial diagnosis of aphasia, Emma took to her own Instagram to share a message of appreciation for the support from fans. “Your love, support, compassion, prayers really help,” she wrote. “I’m grateful. Thank you from the bottom of my heart.” She has yet to give an individual statement since the announcement of Bruce’s frontotemporal dementia diagnosis.\n\nShe has a special bond with Demi and the actress’ 3 daughters\n\nEmma has a rock-solid relationship with Bruce’s ex-wife, Demi. On International Women’s Day in 2021, Demi shared a moving message about the women in her life who inspire her, one being Emma. “I #SeeHer as family who I am honored to call a friend,” Demi wrote on her Instagram. “Our children are sisters and yet there is no name for what our family connection is to one another. We are mothers united, sisters bonded on this crazy adventure of life.”\n\nWhile Emma is a proud mother to her Mabel and Evelyn, she also has an incredible bond with Bruce and Demi’s three daughters Rumer, Scout, and Tallulah. The ladies all hang out together, especially during the holidays. For the 2022 holiday season, the three parents and 5 daughters got festive by posing in front of a Christmas tree. “We are FAMILY!! Getting into the holiday spirit!,” Demi captioned the adorable snap.\n\nEmma and Bruce love being in the kitchen together\n\n“We love cooking breakfast together,” she told The New Potato. “I make my special breakfast burritos and Bruce does a different spin on a pancake called Corn Cakes. Imagine a corn muffin as a pancake—it’s delicious. He’s pretty famous for them around here. He loves Italian food. He’s always up for lasagna.”"
