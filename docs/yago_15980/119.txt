Emma Heming Willis has paid tribute to her husband Bruce Willis as the pair celebrate 16 years together.

The couple wed in March 2009, and have subsequently welcomed two daughters in 2012 and 2014 respectively.

While they have a few months to wait until their 15th wedding anniversary, the couple have commemorated their time together, with Emma writing a heartfelt post on Instagram.

‚Äú16 years with this special man. My love and adoration for him only grows ü§ç‚Äù she wrote, with the caption accompanying a pair of photos as the couple embraced.

The post comes after Bruce retired from acting last year after being diagnosed with aphasia as a result of frontotemporal dementia.
