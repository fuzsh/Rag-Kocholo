I discussed the alphabetic numeral system as employed in Attica; in the present article I examine the use of letters in Attica and else¬ where to identify different items, often similar in character and appearance, with a view of facilitating reference and simplifying inventories. For such a purpose letters have certain advantages over other symbols which might be devised; they arc brief and familiar and they occur in a recognized order. They thus approach nearly to the use of ordinal numbers (con¬ trasting sharply with acrophonic numerals, which are invariably used to represent cardinal numbers), though it cannot be said that they constitute a numeral system, any more than we could claim that we in English use an alphabetic numeral system bi^rause, e.g., a, b, r, d are used on p. 4 below to distinguish four items which might equally well have been numbered I, 2, 3 and 4. The letters here under consideration were not, and could not be, made the instruments of arithmetical calculation, and the highest number expressed in this way in any inscription known to me is 106 {Inscr. Dilos 1432 Aan 21; see below, p. 8). Various scholars have dealt briefly with the subject,' but the accumulation of a mass of new evidence calls for a fresh treatment, especially of the part played by such letters in inventories. No technical name has, I believe, been given to letters so used, and in this article I call them * letter-labels *, a title wliich emphasizes the function they fulfil in the majority of cases where they occur. I. General The earliest example seems to be the use of the first nine letters of the local alphabet (A to 0 , including F) to mark the nine clauses of a statute passed by the Eastern Locrians to define the conditions on which certain of their number were to go as colonists to Naupactus in Western Locris about 460 b.c.* It has further been claimed that three fifth-century boundary-stones from Athens inscribed h6pos K {IG P 876) are examples of this usage; but, apart from the isolated nature of the evidence, this view raises the problem of three stones all bearing the same number, whereas no member of the series bearing any other number has survived. I cannot but wonder whether K is an abbreviation and these stones stand in some relation to the two which are inscribed h6po^ xp^ves (/G I* 874/5).® Of the eighty-nine bronze jurors’ tickets collected in IG II* 1835-1923, dating from the fourth century b.c., sixty-three bear one of the ten letters A to K, indicating the panel on which the holder served.* With these we may compare the eighty-six earthenware tallies, dating from the third century, found in or near the Theatre at Mantinea {IG V (2) 323, nos. 22-107), each of which bears, or at least bore, on the obverse the name and patronymic of the holder and on the reverse one of the twenty-five letten A to H (including digamma), indicating, it would seem, the section of the theatre-euwa in which the owner was entitled to sit.* A different usage is found in a stele from the Epidaurian Asclepieum {IG IV* 109), dating * See I.

TOD from the early third century b.c. and bearing on obverse and reverse and on the two sides long and detailed building-accounts. At the foot of the right side is a large A and the phrase Ti AoiTTdt Iv Tcoi fiAAcoi I KpoT<ic<ptoi <) 5 i> feinyiypcrnTOci ‘ continued in column B' (iii i6i f.), while the text on the left side ends with a reference to [toIs d]XXo*[s] & iv xcoi Kpordfcoi I iv S>i to yp<<i>uu* A y^ypomrai (iv 129 f.), but there is no trace of the expected B.* Very common is the use of letter-labels in the form of ‘ masons* marks * inscribed upon blocks of stone to indicate the position which each is to occupy in the construction in which it takes its place. Here I give only three examples, to which attention has recently been drawn. On the upper surface of the stones forming the front row of the Piraeus theatre are inscribed the letters A to O and AA to Tf, each of which occurs twice, once on each of two contiguous blocks.’ The examination of the * House of the Hermes ’ at Delos has revealed a similar series of marques d'assmblage, running from AA to HH (excluding FF).* Again, the position of each of the nine inscribed bases composing the monument in honour of the Muses, erected by the Thespians in the Vale of the Muses on Mount Helicon, was indicated by the letters A to I, of which seven survdve.® Another well-known use of these letter-labels (approximating to numerals, yet using the letters, except A to E, with values different from those of the alphabetic numeral system recognized throughout the Greek world) is to distinguish the several books comprised in certain literary works, notably the Iliad. This also may be illustrated from inscriptions, such as the tabulae Riacae found in Rome {IG XIV 1284.-6).*® But my main purpose in this article is to examine the use of letter-labels in the temple- inventories of Athens and Delos, and to these I now turn. II. Athens The adoption and widespread application of the system of letter-labels to facilitate the tatlc of officials responsible for drawing up or checking inventories seems to be due to Athenian initiative and influence.

SEG X 211-4), and one of an in¬ ventory of the property of Artenus Brauronia {SEiG X 219). Inventorizing was very much the vogue in Attica, and we are not surprised to hnd that the Attic settlers who, at the outbreak of the Peloponnesian War, occupied the island of Aegina, promptly made and published inventories of some at least of the local shrines {IG IV 39, 1588). Similarly in the fourth century the cleruchs planted on the island of Imbros appoint irpdKTOpt; to publish a list of the contents of a temple with their weights, and order their successors to add to it all later acquisitions {IG XII (8) 51), and the Attic cleruchs sent to Samos drew up in 346/5 an inventory of the temple of Hera, including the Kdouos Tf\\s 660O (Michel 832). A further sign of the Athenian love of inventories is foimd in a decree of 353/2 b.c. {IG II* 120), giving detailed instructions for the examination and registration of all the sacred objects in the Chalkothckc (i^erAjev koctA ? 0 vos fKaorcc xori hTiypd9£v t|[6v] ApiOjiAv, 11 . 14 f.), followed on the same stele (11. 32 ff.) by the inventory itself.^* In view of this insistence on the maintenance of full and precise records, it is astonishing to find how ineffective were the steps taken for the custody and preservation of the sacred objects. In the inventory just mentioned a surprising number of them were damaged or imperfect— koTtch kmoKtufis SsAusvoi, TrivccKes KOrrtccydTts, ioxApea I'niro? XoAkos oApAv ovK [?X“v], and so on. This deplorable condition of many votive offerings is amply illustrated by the fourth-century lists from Eleusis, from which I quote the items (under the heading TroTfipiov Avaf cbTA^’ xotOXti ippeoyua* kA6oi II[I]I* toCttcov dj 6X05 artycov, 6 6* frepos Tru6|jiva oOk ^ t[p]^tos oOre dpTripa oCrre ttASc 5 uo, 6 64 lirapTOs t6v TTuOpiva CnT 4 p(p)cmTai {IG II* 1542.17 ff.), by many of the Delian inventories and by that of the Samian Hcraion (see above). Thus mutilated and useless objects continued to be hoarded and catalogued year affer year, and it was only rarely that the authorities ventured on a bold and comprehensive measure of repairing damaged votives and recasting in other forms those incapable of repair.'* Such a policy was carried out about the middle of the third century B.c. at the Oropian Amphiaraion {IG VII 303), and we possess part of the report for 215/4 Tcov crtpsdIvTcov CnrA Toy Si^uou irrl KOcOaipecnv Kcrt -rfiv imoxarfiv tOv Sv twi ’AoKXTymricoi at Athens {IG II* I539)> and records of similar action taken in the temple of the i\\pcos lorrpAs in the third and second centuries {IG II* 839, 840; cf. 841, 842). Most of the fifth-century inventories ** are comparatively short and simple, but the fourth century brought an embarrassing increase in their number, length and complexity, and the annual renewal of the whole record gave place in some cases to the publication of an annual list of accessions.'* It was in these circumstances that the use of letter-labels to facilitate the registration of votive offerings arose. Very early in the fourth century we find some objects identified by a reference to their decoration; thus in several fragments of the inventory of the Opisthodomos, published by the Treasurers of Athena and the Other Gods, we find such phrases as kovov ypwov ArrAfuXov Iva tA 4X€9AvTiva jQict (3051610), kccvov ypuaov CrTrAx®^®v Iva 6 *Att6XXcov (or 6 Zsus), duptem^ptov ypvoov AirAyoXKOv Iva tA KapirvXa TriraXa (or tA 6 p 0 A iriraXa).'* But I know no example of the use of a letter for this purpose earlier than 371 /o b.c., when we find two Oumarfipia hrixpuca urrAyctXKa, differentiated by the Treasurers of Athena as Iva t 6 AX90 TTOpoCTEOTmavTai and Iva t 6 pfjTa TrapaaEOT^uavrai; these phrases recur in 368/7 See alw IC II* 216, 217 (345 b.c.).

The bars are simply described as rrpoiTOS, Sevrepos, Tpixos, rh-apTOS, rriuTTros, but each has, in addition to its ordinal, a lettcr-label, e.g. TrpwTOS tva t 6; A; ■rTpcoT[os] <p 0 oTs: XhHHI-I- : beoTspos: XHHIII: and so on. The letter-labels run consecutively from A to X, but X is followed by a new scries ( 11 . 72 ff.) beginning dpxfls ^Ttpov: Tipwros | tva t6 : AA: TTpeiTOs 9doT5 ktX.

A different system is illustrated in an inscription {IG IP 1496) of the Treasurers of Athena and the Commissioners appointed to carry out Lycurgus’ measures £ttI rds vlxaj xal xi TToinrEla xal t6v k6ctuov t6v Kavq9opiK6v.” This covers the years 334/3 to 331/0 and preserves, inter alia, a record of forty crowns divided into four ^vpo(, each of which contained ten crowns and bore the labels Bl, Bll, Bill, BUM respectively ( 11 . 176-186)*“; next come JrEpoi ol t 6 ydupa Ex[ovt£ 5]1 AAA, divided into three groups marked respectively PI, PII, PMI ( 11 . 187 ff.), and there was also, we may assume, a record (now lost) of thirty *• crowns, divided into three ^upol labelled Al, AM, AIM.

Two further Athenian inscriptions call for notice. («) A fragment included by Kirchner among the fragmmta incerta and assigned to the third century b.c. {IG II* 1695) contains examples of a new and very brief formula—otvoxolii: A §TEpai : II: B yuxTfip : A :, vyuicWip: B HAacn^p (with no added letter), 6lvos: A:, Sivos: B terX., followed in every case by a note of the weight. ( 4 ) In Hesperia III 51-3, no. 39 B. D. Meritt published three fragments, un¬ earthed in the Agora, of an inventory which P. Roussel identified ” as relating to the Delian sanctuaries and dated c. 166 b.c., pointing out the striking similarities between portions of the Agora text and Inscr. DHos 1432, which belongs to the archonship of Phaedrias (153/2 B.G.). Subsequently a fourth fragment came to light and all four were published in Hesperiay XIII 254-7, no. 11 by Meritt, who accepted Roussel’s date,*® though he called attention to some noteworthy parallels in Inscr. Dilos 380, 385 and 442, which belong respectively to i 9 ®?> | 9 ® and 179 B.c. Any date earlier than 166 must be rejected, for the Athenians would not exhibit in their city the records of an independent Delos, and even if we accept a date in or soon after 166, we may well be surprised, since no other fragment has yet come to light of Athenian copies of the documents represented by Inscr. Dilos 1400-1479. It is possible that at the outset the Athenians decided to set up copies at Athens, but soon abandoned the plan in view of the unnecessary expense entailed. In this document letter-labels are used, as is shown by fii t6 ydMp[a (1. 32), 49* oO t[6 (1. 37). 49* fjs (U. 44, 45). 6O0 vO (1. 46). fl5 t* ( 1 . 48), and T«Jt 5 ] 0 o 96T ( 1 . 50). We may note that in the extant Delian records of this penod letter-labels arc not written out as letter-names (below, p. 8). Before passing from Attica to Delos, we may note the use of letter-labels in the inventory of the Heraion published in 346/5 b.c. by the Athenian settlers on the island of Samos; objects arc there recorded as missing 4 k toO and 4 v twi eI (Michel 832.45 f.). III. Delos I have already remarked (p. 4) that I have found no examples of the use of letter-labels among the fourth-century tabulae Amphutyonam Deliacorum found at Athens ( 7 C 11 * 1633-53), and the same is true of the parallel scries found at Delos, so far as I have examined them.*^ I now turn to the accounts and inventories published annually by the Delian leporroioi “ publication Meritt commented that ‘ the \\mtinK indi^tes a date^the first B.c/ {Hestma 111 53).

TOD during the period of the island’s independence (314—166 b.c.) and relating to all the sanctuaries under their chaige. The documents arc numerous and detailed, numbering, as edited in the corpus of Delian inscriptions,*® 384, of which a considerable group run to inordinate length, especially 161 (519 lines), 199, 203, 287, 290, 298, 372, 442 (617 lines) and 461. It is surprising that the Delians should have maintained this publication on stone throughout the period, for the trouble and expense ** involved were considerable and the problem of the exhibition of a large and steadily growing number of inscribed stelae must have become serious, if not acute. But the incentive to continue the custom, rather than to rest content with a paper document duly audited and deposited in the public archives, may have come from the kieropoioi themselves, who welcomed the publicity so secured for their names, their activities and their zeal. On the subject of letter-labels, however, these records have little to tell us, and that little concerns solely a seri^ of twenty-one golden crowns,** one representing myrtle leaves and the rest laurel, which make their appearance in 296 b.c. in the words crT£9dvou5 xp\\jcciO% fipn^M^vou? irpos Tcoi Toixcoi cTkooi §va, with no added particulars of form or weight {IG XI 154^ 62). In 279 B.c. the phrase Twy KpCMopIvcov crTe9d\\^D[v] is followed by a record (i 6 i .5 107 ff.) ** of the weight of each (6 irpoS-ros 6AKfiv Spotypis HCT, etc.), accompanied in eight cases by a note of the discrepancy between the previously recorded and the actual weight— e.g. 6 fvccTo$ Kcri 8b<ctTOs sTye pfev i7nypa9^v' PAAAhl-ll- orotStis [6’J sIXksv PAAAhhlll- 6 tixoards irrey^pornro piv 6Xirfiv H* otoOeIs 5 ’sUkuctcv HHII (U. iigf.). In 187 we have a very fragmentary list, in 1995 28 ff. a complete list with weights, differing slightly in most cases from those entered in i6iR. In 269 B.c. we have a perfectly preserved record (203^ 58 ff.) of the oTBpctvoi ypuooT TTpds to 5 i Toiycoi eikooi eTy, with revised weights and a note in each case of the form,*’ 6 irpcoTos pupcfivT^s, 6 SguTEpos Sa^vTiy, and so on, though this involves a twentyfold repetition of 5d9VT^y. Not until about 267 b.c. do we learn of the presence of letter-labels, indicated by such phrases as oO t 6 following the word 6d9VTi5 and preceding 6 Xki^ (205.^4^ 20 ff.); the extant letter- names are pfira, ?)to, pco, tteI, after which come oO t 6 Z and oO t 6 Y. The list in 219^ 58 ff. (before 260 B.c.?) gives only the weights of the ot69<5cvous ypuaoOs TTpby rcoi rolycoi AAI. In 283.6 ff. the first crown alone has its letter-label recorded (oO to dX9a), and the same is true for 250 B.c. (2875 77 ff.) **; the rest are identified only by ordinal numbers. By 240 B.c. con¬ sideration of cost and labour have reduced the entry to the phrase kv tcoi va[( 5 i etew aT£9dvous XpwoOs TTpos Tooi Tolycoi AAI] (298.^ 116), which in 235 or 234 B.c. is further shortened to [iv tc 5 i vewi eToco aTi90tvoi] eTkooi eIj (313a 92), and in 229 b.c. to -irjpby tcoi Tolycoi (rri9avoi ypu[<roI] AAI (320B 3). This is the last surviving mention of these crowns; what happened to them thereafter we cannot say. Thus while 205^!^ 20 ff., 283.6 and 287^ 77 prove that the crowns had their several letter-labels during this period, there seems to be a certain reluctance on the part of the kieropoioi to use them, and no attempt was made to extend the device to other groups of sacred objects; where used, the letters are indicated by words—6^90, PfiTCt, etc.—except in the case of 2 and possibly also of Y (205^4^ 28 f.). Three further points may be noted before we turn to the later lists. ** IG X! 135-289, Inser. Dths 290-498 {td. F. Durrbach). Since the texts in thc»e two works run consecutively, I cite them by number only. ** ^e cost is recorded in i6i^ 117 ff. (979 b.c.) and 199C 68 ff.

Thus in 136.6 (before 301 b.c.) the word &pof)(uai is omitted in the phrase Tpicocdoicn ^usWiKOVTa pia rrivT’ 6^Xol, and in 1545 (296 b.c.) numbers arc written in words, but Spoexped is regularly omitted, while in 1. 44 6p^ol also is omitted in the phrase 6XKfi bcorriv TrrTap<hc[ov]Ta 6KTd3 Tirrapsj. Again, in 199^ 28 ff. there is a series of ordinals running normally from loO irpcbTou to toO 6co6ek6ctou. but the * teens * arc represented by toO TplTou, ToO TerdpTW, etc., the words koI Saedrou being intentionally omitted, as is also done in 219^ 60 f. . . u • ■ (i) Examples of grammatical inconsistency arc very frequent, especially in the inventories, where the objects recorded arc sometimes in the nominative, the natural ease to express such lists, sometimes in the accusative, since many of them arc introduced by such phrases as TdSe TTOEpsAdpouEv. The nominative and the accusative are often used indiscriminately for items of the same nature occurring in the same list; thus in 199^ 2 ff. we find &AXtiv (sc. 9idXTiv) thrice, followed by &XXti at least four times, in 442^ 10 f. fiAXov ordpvov is followed by dAXos OTdpvos, and in 442B 7 ff. xP^oOs occurs five times in succession followed by trri^ctvov XpuooOv twice. . (c) A curious feature of these records is the neglect of the talent as a umt of money and its use only for denoting weight. This refusal to recognize any monetary unit larger than the drachma leads to the appearance of very high numbers Bpoxpal PMMMXXX etc. (i 6 ^Bdg 10), PMMMMPXXX etc. (442^ 122), the irregularly expressed MMMMMMXXX etc. (444^ 56)—culminating in the pupiASe? AA^FT [ 5 ]paxuci[i] (= 350,000 dr.) of 46^ 22 and the AAAA pnMH (* 460, lOO) of 203B loi, though this last number docs not refer to drachmas. Often, especially in 442^, numbers arc preceded by the drachma-sign h, while in the phrase Twv Iwrrdv h this sign follows the number (442.4 173). In 166 B.c. Delos came once more under the control of the Athenians, who were faced with the task of making provision for the future discharge of the duties hitherto assigned to the hieropoioi.

The Athenian officials arc content to follow in general, though ^ no means slavishly, the lines laid down by the DeUan hieropoioi.

But our present concern is wiA the letter-labels which appear frequently in the inventories of Ais period, especially i4oqda, 1429, 1432, 1441^ ii, 1443^ i, 1449, 1450 and 1451^, and about them some remarks must be made.*^ (a) With only one exception, letter-labels are never written in words, i.e. A is always used, nwer ^ 9 ^- The sole exception occurs in 1450.^ 124, where instead of tA KK we have to Iflj KtStTTTTO *®; here II stands for 6uo, whereas in Ac preceding item tA II stands for rd 6iio Icoto. (i) The letter-label is invariably preceded by Ac dehnite article rd (where Ae letter is single) or t< 5 c (where it is repeated).*’ (f) ^ore Ae definite article comes Ac phrase £9* oO (^5, 6v) or £9’ fji (0I5, ol?), relating to Ac objects bearing Ae letter-labels. There seems to be no difference in meaning between the genitive and the dative, and Ac two are often used side by side in Ac same list, Aough the genitive greatly preponderates. A curious fact, which I record but cannot explain, is that, where Ac antecedent is singular, Ae genitives £9’ oO and ^9* arc almost invariably preferred to I9 and I9 while wiA plimal antecedents 19’ ols is far commoner Aan Ac feminine ^9 (Sv, but Ac masculine or neuter ^9' d)v is used almost to Ac exclusion of 49' oTg. Occasion- ally, but rarely, Ae locative oO takes Ac place of Irrf wiA the genitive or dative; in 1443-d i 142 we have o]v to A, in 1449 Aab ii 124 oO t6 A, and in 1450^ 97, 115, 152 oO t[6 A, oO to A and od t6 A.*’ (d) The double letter-label, AA etc., is never written as toc 50 o A etc., but once we find Ta Tp(a A etc. used in place of tA AAA etc., and tA - i^ i ta pe A etc. in place of tA AAAA etc. (i449daA ii 76 fT, 83 if.). {e) When a fifth series of letter-labels is required, one of two alternatives is adopted. In i4^d 133 ff. we have to . AAAAA down to tA KKKKK, but elsewhere (1428 i 10 ff., 1432^^ ii 16 1^145id 27 ff.)

From the former group of texts it has been assumed that two water-systems were installed, one in the time of Vespasian and the other in the time of Domiiian *; I hope to show that these texts refer to one water-system only, that built in the time of Domitian. From the latter passage it has sometimes been thought * that M. Ulpius Carminius Claudianus * paid for the laying-on of the waters of the river Timelcs to the city in the age of the Antonines. This assumption rested on the false reading iX[€io]6[i]dKTo[v]s introduced by Boeckh. The word SA£io6icncT0s is taken to mean a * con¬ duit W draining marshes * (L 5 *, j.o.). Sherard’s copy preserves the true reading SX<a)ia 6pcfKToTs •iroXX<itKis TcSsiKbra.® AH that can be proved by the inscription is that Carminius Claudianus made several distributions of oil kv Kocipco ttij toO Te<i)y 4 Aou TroroyoO Elaoycoyfis (1. 41); there is no proof that he paid for the construction of the aqueduct. The epigraphic evidence for the earlier water-system rests on the reconstruction of the text of which BCH XIV (1890), 611-13, 1 (cf- (1906), 223-4, no. 126), 8 and 9 are fragments; no. 10 seems to be part of another copy of this, or a similar, inscription. Of these fragments the only one found by the expedition led by Professor Calder in 1934® was no. 7; the improved readings in this inscription are from a photograph. The text is com¬ pleted below by means of two unpublished fragments {which I am allowed to quote by kind permission of Professor Josef Keil of the Osterreichische Akademie der Wissenschaften) from Kubitschek’s field-books of his journey with Reichel in 1893 (cf.

In honour of this important event, the city struck coins with the l^end TIMCAHC, which belong, as M. Waadington writ« to me, to the age of the Antonines. The name could not be put on coins of the city until the aqueduct was made, for the riwr docs not belong to the territory of Aphrodisias, but to that of Hcrakleia Salbace.’ For an example of a coin with the Iwend TIMCAHC. sec BMC (Mu, Carta ag, no. 22.

The apparent inconsistency in the treatment of iota mutum, e.g. in 11 . i and 2 (an incon¬ sistency common enough in inscriptions of the Roman period), appears on the stone, where it is absent in 6ea, a dot in the middle of the line taking its place, and present in t«i oIkcoi. The vacat on the stone between 11 . 7 and 8 and also below the last line of fragment (a) in Kubitschek*s note-book confirms the attribution of the fragments to the same inscription. It would appear from 11 . 4-7 that the installation of this water-system was a major operation, involving the construction of reservoirs and the carrying of water to all parts of the city; this was preceded by the buying up of the property (subsequently handed over to the city) through which the water-pipes were to run. The reservoirs and pipes which G. Weber ’ examined at Aphrodisias and related to the period of Carminius Claudianus may, as Vagts suggested,® more probably be those of Domitian’s reign referred to in our inscription. At any rate, the reconstruction of this text has shown that the installation of a separate water- system in the time of Vespasian can no longer be substantiated by the epigraphic evidence. J. M. R.

The choice for the ninth letter is between an iota displaced slightly to the right and a nu, of which the diagonal may have run along the break. Such a nu would be the only one in the inscription with a vertical right kastay and would present con¬ siderable difficulties of restoration. For the aspirate of S>v being omitted in an inscription otherwise observing it, cf. /G I* 110.8. The'horizontal bar of delta, doubted by previous editors, is certain, though faint. Line 8.

Hiller reads ri[i], but I see no trace of epsilon. The alpha of Moipcryixei has no crossbar. Lines 13-25* The cutter certainly felt himself at liberty to cut an additional iota in the last space, and since he presumably filled the first space in ii, 13, and 21, and probably did not in 1. 23, there is nearly always some uncertainty about the line-length. Line 20. Omega, though previously unreported, is quite clear, and there seem to be traces of epsilon before it. The iota 1 read on the left-hand edge of fragment c seems too deep to be merely a scratch. • line 21. Prott saw a punctuation-mark afier the first alpha. It would be surprising, and I cannot confirm it. The surface has partly gone before ]it 65, but the oxide traces (see Meritt, Epigraphica Attica 24) outline the curve of the rho. The final iota is by no means certain, and there would be room for it in the first space of the next line. Line 22. The first nu on fragment c is unreported, but traces of it arc clear. NOTES ON ATTIC INSCRIPTIONS 19 Line 24-5. There is no room for wx in the last space of 1 . 24, but at would go comfortably in the first space of 1. 25. Line 25. The last iota on fragment b is not certain, but there is no room for any other letter in the space. Part of the hasUi of tau appears to survive on fragment c, but it may well be just a scratch. Commentary and Restorations I have little to add to the remarks of Wilhelm and Raubitschek on the date. In default of any parallel to the curious lambda which leans backward and starts with a curl, we must be guided by the phi with its non-protruding stroke, the straggly aw, and the inconsistent use of omega to a date between 470 and 450, and the rounded betas and rhos suggest a later rather than an earlier date in the period. The four-bar sigmas arc an lonicism. As Wilhelm says, the sup¬ posed law about datives in -aiy should not be allowed to outweigh the evidence of the letter- forms. I do not think that there is anything else to support the view of the Corpus editors that the inscription is archaistic of the late fifth century. The division of the document into a decree, Apollo’s oracle, and the irdTpia of the Praxiergidai is due to Prott and is clearly right. LI. 3-4 arc easily restored as the granting of the request that Apollo’s oracle, clearly recent, and their irdrpia be inscribed on marble. I have restored {<|KTS9icrufi;a, which fils the line well and seems more suited to Trpdrgpov than TrdcTpio or vdpipa. I do not think tA Trpd-repov Tixirpta or tA irpATspa TrArpta to be Greek, and I suggest an implied assertion by the demos that even the oldest privileges depend on the will of the people. In 1 . 6 vArodtv is also a possibility, though now only supported by IG I* 167. 10, since later work has discarded the old restorations in I* 4. 9 and 6. 117. From 1 . 7 onwards Ziehen rejects Prott’s interpretation that the setting-up of the steU is still in question, and offers the restoration t6 d:pyOpio[v hAcnt Ap^iivvuaOai t6 h^ | 60s] Tis OeoS kcctA tA 7rATpi[a koI t^v uovreiav to Oeo | ho]i KoXoxp^rai 5 i 66 irrov. This is based on the present imperative 5i56vtou and on the solemn character of larrA tA TrArpta. 5i56vtov is certainly difficult, but Ziehen’s restoration seems to me to introduce • an irrelevance which there arc no sure grounds for supposing. It is difficult in language. Even if the hAore construction were at all normal, we would expect Au9ievvwai (as an anonymous note in the Epigraphical Museum copy of IG I* points out); and it is not normal, for H Au9ilvvvffiv is the natural construction after ApyApiov. Furthermore, Ziehen makes no satisfactory restoration of II. 6-7. He suggests foOrol 66 v]tov or [fiAeotv T0I5 heoujTdv, and I have not yet found any method of m^ing these fit the available space. Since the standard formula [hoi 6 i TroXered AttouioOooAvJtov fits exactly, I have little hesitation in restoring it. The stele is then still not paid for, and the provisions for payment must He in 11 . 7-9. I suggest that they provide that the payment should be made from the goddess’ own money. The publication is a sacred matter, and for sacred expenses the goddess should pay, according to ancestral custom. But I cannot explain the change of tense in SiSAvrov, unless the first two letters are due to dittography. For II. lo-ii I return to Ziehen’s restoration, because I believe the first letter of vAuipa to be on the stone, and because Wilhelm’s restoration * leaves out npccxoispytSois, which is necessary to the sense, and is a letter short in each line. Of II. 15-20 I attempt no restoration. Ziehen’s suggested restoration of 17-19 cannot be made to fit the space. * Printed in IG I*, and argued in his JVm Beitrigt III 24 . 20 DAVID M. LEWIS In 1 . 20 ]e<o must be restored as veco, a form of the accusative otherwise unknown in the fifth century. As Ziehen saw, there is only room for ©apyeXi[6v]o in the accusative, but he failed to restore it because he could make no sense of oeue. * De quo signo seme esse possit, nondum perspicio.' To me it seems inevitable that the letters must be taken as the beginning of (rr|ijr)vdu£vov, exactly parallel to the use of oueoripaivouai in IG P 91. 17, and I restore accord¬ ingly the sense that the archon, who would seem to be the eponymos^ though we would have expected the basileus, is to seal the temple for the month of Thargelion and hand the keys over to the Praxiergidai. With this restoration, and I see no other, we have gained a little fresh evidence for the topography of the Acropolis after 480. Though the TTorpia probably antedate the Persian Wars, they must have relevance to the circumstances circa 460. It seems, then, that at that date the olive-wood statue, of which the Praxiergidai had charge, stood in a building which could be described as a vecoj and could be locked up. To a follower of Dorpfeld this will present no difficulties. The statue, for him, stood in the rebuilt poros temple until the construction of the Erechtheum. This stele will have been erected either to the west or to the south of the temple, which gives us a free choice of restoration in 1. 6, in close connection with the scene of the annual task of the Praxiergidai. But the grounds for believing that the statue stood in Holland’s * east tcmcnos * on the present site of the Erechtheum * arc very' strong. Its presence there explains the orientation of the Erechtheum and provides a natural sense for 6 veebs h; ^ t6 dtpyaTov dyoXua.* Of the two main forms of this theory, the new restoration seems to tell against Dinsmoor’s view that the statue was simply covered by a baldachino.* I do not think that a baldachino would be described as a vecibs, nor do I know how one would lock it. I am inclined to think that Paton’s hypothesis • of a rather more solid structure on the site is to be accepted, but I must leave the decision to others.’ On this view the ApyoTo? veebs of 1 . 6 can be identified with the veebs ofl- 20.* On any other view, except Dorpfcld’s, the stele is being located with reference to a temple destroyed and out of use. Whatever it is, the temple is to be closed for the whole month of Thargelion.® This accords well with the lepouT)via in which the Kallynteria and the Plyntcria took place, which has already been deduced by Mommsen.*® From the fact that the Praxiergidai take over the temple for the whole month we may infer for them a connection with the Kallynteria which is nowhere explicitly stated. The two festivals arc. closely connected. One of the things that the Praxiergidai did on the Plyntcria was to remove some kAoijos.** May we not infer from this that some more positive decoration took place on the Kallynteria than Mommsen ** and Deubner,** who only admit of a cleaning of the shrine and perhaps a refilling of the lamp, will allow? The temple is to be closed [&XP* '*'*5 which would naturally be interpreted as Tpirn 99ivovTOs. We cam thus add one more point against Photius* dating of the Plynteria to SEVT^pa 96IVOVT05, which Mommsen ** has already convincingly rejected in favour of Plutarch’s 96 (vovtos.** The Praxiergidai are therefore given two days to prepare the » AJA XXVIII AJA XXXVI 1944), 11-23. 406-23. « IC I* 372.

I* 18 by Hondius, which went unquestioned for twenty-five years, has now been challenged by Meiggs and Andrewes, who date it between 457 and 445. I am emboldened by this to suggest a new context for this exasperatingly small fragment, which together with the evidence from the tribute-lists is all we have to supplement the scanty literary evidence on the way in which the state which had been Athens* strongest rival was reduced to subjection and then to temporary extinction. To the physical details in the editio minor I add tltat part of the rough-picked, uninscribed back is preserved, and that the inscription was cut with three chisels measuring 8, 6-5 and 5 mm. in a horizontal chequer of 0*0127 m., broadening slightly at the bottom, and a vertical of 0*0122 m.

Hiller aOToT[5, Hondius ocCrroIy. 22 DAVID M. LEWIS Commtniaiy and Restorations The fifue5 and forties arc a time of rapid development in Attic letter-forms, and it seems clear to me, at any rate, that this inscription comes near the end of the development. With the Erechtheid monument { 2 G I* 929), the most securely dated inscription of die early fifties, it has nothing in common. Its kinship lies rather with the Miletus decree of450-49 (IG I* 22), as Ncasc points out, and with the Cos copy of the coinage decree of about the same date {ATL II 63), and even, with the exception of its three-bar sigmasy with the Chalcis decree of 446-5 {IG I* 39). If one compares it with the Tribute Lists, our most safely dated inscriptions, this becomes clear. Compared io ATL List 5, presumably cut in the summer of 449, it has rounded, more modem forms of beta and rhoy and it uses the phi with protruding crossbar which docs not appear on the lists until 451. The vertical mi suggests the forties. A date of 457 would give this inscription the first Ionic eta in a public inscription in Attic by twelve years.' A date of 457, then, seems cpigraphically difficult to accept. There is, however, another occasion on which the relations between Athens and Aegina required regulation. It is generally recognised that the complaints of the Aeginetans in Thuc. I 67. 2 that they are not ocCrrdvoiioi Kccri Tdj owov6ds imply that there was a clause specifically about Aegina in the Thirty Years’ Peace. It may be conjectured that it ran something like AlyiWjTas 61 oOrovdiiouj elvai, 94povTas t6v 96pov 6v &v irsldcooiv ’Adqvalous.® There would be the more point in this clause, if we accept the strong arguments put forward in ATL III 38-9 for complete non¬ payment of tribute by Aegina in 447 and 446. The terms of the peace put an end to Acgihctan hopes tjiat their subjection of 457 was only temporary. They also imposed on Athens the need to make a peacetime arrangement for her relations with Aegina. I suggest that our fragment is all that remains of the arrangements, and is to be dated to the summer of 445. It may be thought that this is as unsound epigraphically as the early date. The document docs not look as late as 445. I suspect that the objection rests unduly on the three-bar sigmas and on false standards of comparison. We cannot draw rigid lines in ages of transition. There arc always conservatives and progressives, artists and workmen. Inscriptions looking forward and inscriptions looking back may be contemporary. Raubitschek has well analysed the two schools in the earlier period of transition, 510-490.* The same processes are at work in our period, and while sculptors* workshops produced lettering of the new era like that on 7 ( 71 * 394, now convincingly dated by him in 456,* the normal run of the trade lagged behind; not much, indeed, but still behind, and produced less fashionable work for, to be practical, a good deal less money. There is certainly a faint odour of a cheap job about our inscription. An Ionic eta might happen to anyone,* though if we accept an Ionic gamma in line 9, it would be less excusable.’ But the first five letters down of the ninth column arc extremely badly set, the chequer is closely drawn, as if to cram a great deal into a small stone, and the stone was not only small but faulty. Even squeeze and photograph make it clear that the reason for the uninscribed space in line 4 is not to be found in the * normal epigraphlc manner of spacing before an important word ’,* but in a flaw in the stone which begins in these two spaces and runs diagonally to hinder our reading of several letters and cause the second uninscribed space in line 8 and the closing up away from its own space of the last letter of aT-noi in line 9. If one views the craftsmanship in this light, 445 is by no means an improbable date. • The earliest precisely datable is IG I* 39. 77 of 445. • No note a. • ATL III 303. * Dtdicalions 44^451. * Id., D 173. • See note i and cf. /C I* 34. a; 57. at, 41, 5a; 108. 35; 953. 30. ’ IG I* 57. 51 seems the only really respectable example. • Nease, »p. eit. NOTES ON ATTIC INSCRIPTIONS 23 The explanation of the workmanship is not difficult to find. Except in very special circumstances, the allies of Athens paid for the erection of decrees about themselves. Those responsible had a strong interest in getting the job done as cheaply as possible, and we can now assemble several cases. Schweigert pointed this out in the case of the decree for Erctria,® and the chaotic workmanship of the Kolophon decree is the outstanding example. Aegina seems to have been more lavish than Kolophon, but, not surprisingly in view of her disappointment, disinclined to get the job done as well as possible. That Aegina paid for the erection of the stone seems probable in any case. It may even be recorded in our fragment. Hondius rightly followed Mcisterhans* warning against articles with plural ethmes,*^ and read toTs Alyi[v£T6y in I. 2. He was then, however, tempted to restore before toTj, but this, like his suggestion of in 1. 5, is surely not right. After the capitulation of 457 and the peace of 445, the only allies that Aegina had were the members of the Athenian Empire. No others could be recognised in an Athenian inscrip¬ tion. A more satisfactory restoration, which happens to fit the traces in 1 .1, would be: [dvorypd^cTcn t6v ypauuerria TI5 p] [oASs hrriA]g[iJ A[t6iv€i koI KOrTo:6fvai Ip iroAgi •rt] [Asm t]oTs Aly![v€T6v ktA.] This, however, ought to be a concluding formula, and yet the inscription goes on. There would be no room in 1 . 2 for an amendment formula and yet more provisions appear. But the Sunium decree {SEG X 11. 12 ff.) is perhaps an adequate parallel for careless drafting in this period. The structure of the inscription presents more difficulties. One would like to preserve the distinction between a treaty, which is private to neither state and has no validity until the oaths arc sworn, and decrees of a state which order the doing of things which are in its power, either that the treaty shall be accepted or that various executive measures be taken to imple¬ ment it, including the taking of the oaths. In all known Attic inscriptions down to 431 which deal with imperial or foreign relations, the relations which are to obtain for the future arc known to us only from the oaths. That another state should not attack Athens was not a thing that the Athenian people could pass a decree about, though it could pass one accepting an alliance including this as a term, and even quoting the terms introduced by xdaSg or Kcmk TdSs. There are apparent exceptions where the treaty docs not seem to be properly incorporated into the decree.^* One of these, the Aigivc alliance of 417-6 {SEG X 104), is too fragmentary at the critical point to be discussed. (It even appears, illusorily, I suspect, to lack a proposer.) But the Halieis decree ** seems to have the people of Athens decreeing that Halieis should provide harbourage: A<i[XCS «- Itts* hdpKojs 2vai d56Ao- S 'AOcvcrfoifs Kcri hoAicOoiv oroOubv 6^ 'n’ajp^[6]v hccAi- as *A0€vai[ois xals vowalv ktA.] * ATL II, D 16, Huptria VI (1^7), 3 * 9 . I do not think it is neccssaiy to suppose, with S., that the worlunsn was an Eretrian. Native workmen are baidly to be assumed in the cases of Phaselis and Aph^.

Hondius thought it a treaty, and lines 7-10 certainly seem to be part of one. But, with one doubtful exception,'* a stone merely containing a treaty is unexampled before the Peace of Nikias (though of course we do not know how the Peace of Kallias and the Thirty Years’ Peace were inscribed); the fact that the stone contains the words toi x^^^^J^eva suggests that at least part of it was not itself the treaty, and 1 . 6 seems to refer to the Aeginetans in a detached manner, which might be part of an Attic decree but not part of a treaty with Aegina. I suggest tentatively that the solution is that 11 . 7-10 are part of the treaty and arc being quoted in an Attic decree. I restore, exempli gratia^ as follows: [Kcrrdt t6 6- or Cnrdpxo-] vra x<yvvK€lue[vct xal Korrd xij vOv x^w6h<a5 ha-] I eIoiv oCrroIs 'rT[p6s ’AOevoios Kcrrd TdSg- MeS* hrl] ^Xd^Et TEi *A 0 €v[a(ov ktX.] A parage from the treaty is being quoted to justify some executive action, probably con¬ nected with the word I find all previous treatments of this word unacceptable. Its basic meaning is abstract, something like * watch *, ‘ defence or frequently, * blockade and in spite of the use of it in the concrete by Herodotus and Thucydides,'’ this is the only meaning it has in inscriptions. A garrison in official language is a 9poupd, composed of 9pwpoi, and its commander is a 9po0papxo^. He appears in Eiythrac,'* his troops appear in Miletus,'* and when the allies join the second Athenian confederacy, they do it on condition that they do not receive a 9poupd.*® The 9po0papxos, however, must Korraar g aat liv B^ooav 9uXaidv ttovtoxo *Epu&pdcn,*' that is to say, he maintains watch, just as the generals are to do over Euboea,** and surely 1 . 85 of the Miletus decree must be restored and interpreted in the same way: hnuEXfaeo 5 ^ h]€ poXi [tI$] 9uXccKgs.**' ** Our inscription, too, will run something like KocraoTeoat t^v po>i]|v t4u 9 uXoQd[v ? hfe av dpIoTE 2 i, but whether this watch is to preserve unfortified Aegina from enemies and marauders or Athens from Aeginetan plots we have no means of telling.

I find the suggestion in A TL, III 320 that Aeginetan complaints were caused by a newly-arrived garrison more probable than Ncasc’s suggestion that they were inspired by a garrison which had been in position for twenty-five years. The peace provided for the autonomy of Acgina. Autonomy is an elastic term, as Gomme points out,** but in this case it may not have been far from the truth. Whereas in all other agreements with members of the Empire the emphasis is on loyalty to Athens and the League, here the formulae which seem to have been employed in 11 . 7-10 are those appro¬ priate to treaties with independent states like Halieis “ and the unknown state of I* 53.*’ The only other evidence for the character of the settlement is the tribute-assessment of Aegina. Welter ** finds a payment of thirty talents deliberately punitive, a capital levy designed to destroy the resources built up by a hundred years of trade, which could not possibly be met out of income. I find this unconvincing. Clearly Aegina lost trade steadily to Athens throughout the fifth century, and the archaeological evidence would seem to confirm that the state was not as prosperous in the forties as in the nineties, but I find no evidence to show that revenue from trade ever stopped dead.** Even twenty years or so after the expulsion an Aeginetan exile in Naucratis has still big enough connections to endear himself at Rhodes.*® It is possible that by 432 the tribute was becoming a burden, but that is no evidence for the intentions of 445. 1 add some notes on possible restorations.

LEWIS 26 uninscribed, Gomme^ has suggested that we have lost half another list and Dow* has wished to fill the gap either with a decree or another short list. I do not wish to suggest a radical altera¬ tion in the determinations of ATL^ but I have long suspected that they should be modified in detail, and an examination of the stone has strengthened this suspicion. It may be recalled that it was only in 1926 that the existence of the uninscribed space was discovered. Early editions allowed what has now become List 9 upwards indefinitely, as it did as late as IG I* 199. One of the earliest changes introduced by West and Mentt ^ was to read, instead of the traditional EA, i.t. sy, the third and fourth letters of an unidentified Thracian name, EN, the beginning of ^vdtTE? in the prescript of the list. It was not until 1939 that, in the first volume of ATL^* part of the alpha of detected and the prescript took its present form: [hrl Tcs] d[pXtS Tts] hli-iypappdTcuE-] It seems to me that this identification of the prescript has been mistaken, and that we cannot in fact determine with certainty the exact sizes of List 9 s^t^d the available space above it. Before we turn to a detailed study of the letters in question, let us look more generally at List 9 as it is presented to us in ATL. It contains not more than 154 names. It is hard to make an exact comparison with List 8, which contains so many part payments and may have contained more, and seems to have had between 162 and 186 names. The fairer parallel is with Lists lo-i I, the others in the same assessment period. I count in List 10 not more than 159 names, in List 11 not more than 164 names. In List 12, the first of the next period, there were probably exactly 165 names. It seems then that List 9 is ^ trifle short, though by not more than about ten names. But even thb is not easy to explain on the general theory of A TL, by which the Decree of Klcinias (D 7) falls between Lists 7 and 8 and is followed by the drastic tightening of tribute-collection in List 8 , which should then be followed immediately by List 9* If with Accame * we slight the influence of the Decree of Klcinias and place the missing year before List 9, the wonder is not that List 9 is a little short, but that it is so long, and in fact I regard the peaceful condition of List 9 as a strong argument against Accame’s theory. Let us close the limits of our examination to the Thracian district. List 8 reflects great activity here, particularly in the Strymon region,® and at least thirty-nine cities paid once or more in this year. In List 10 there were at least thirty-seven Thracian cities, in List 11 at least thirty-six, and it is therefore unlikely that there was any serious absenteeism in these years. List 9 bears this out. The Thracian cities arc concentrated in what might, anachronistically, be called a panel, and it is well-preserved. ATL restores forty-one names with virtual certainty. There can be very little missing, but there is something. Various cities appear which were not present in previous years or at least arc not preserved as having paid—^Akanthos, Argilos—, possibly the Othorioi, Olynthos, probably Potidaia, Skiathos, but to counterbalance these, there are five absentees not so far assigned to List 9. The Erodioi do not present any difficulty, since they never appear again, nor do the Chedrolioi, whose absence for some years can be inferred from the fact that, when they reappear in the thirties, they arc under the fircocroi and TuSXns ocCrrcd Ta 5 « 5 cuEvai rubrics. One might even discount Berga, which docs not appear again until List 20, although this is a dangerous procedure in view of the fragmentary condition of our Thracian evidence for Lists 14-19. But the really pressing difficulties are the absence of ‘ CRLIV (1940), 65-67. » CPk XXX^I (1949), 37 *- 384 ; XXXVIII (1943), aa-a?. • HmvSt XXXVJl 75-7C * P. 15. • /twFiVXVI N.S.

This is really quite inexplicable. It is not on all fours with its disappearance in List 12 from a full panel, for there its neighbours Dikaia and Thasos go too, and here Dikaia is present and Thasos plausibly restored. I find it hardly credible that it and its 15 talents should be absent in a year when Athenian interest in and control of Thrace is at its height. But where are it and Stolos to go? They might displace Carian names downwards in Column III, but this would clash with the complicated but convincing argu¬ ments by which this column has been reconstructed. They might go to the foot of Column I, but this would rather disturb the paneMike grouping. They certainly cannot go at the bottom of Column II, for the bottom of the list is fixed. They may go somewhere else altogether, but in order to keep all the Thracian names together it would be attractive to suppose that they might go to"
