Our communications services include local voice, high-speed Internet, private line (including special access), network access, Ethernet, information technology, video, wireless and other ancillary services. In certain local and regional markets, we also provide local access and fiber transport services to competitive local exchange carriers.\n\nWe generate the majority of our total consolidated operating revenues from services provided in the 14-state region of Arizona, Colorado, Idaho, Iowa, Minnesota, Montana, Nebraska, New Mexico, North Dakota, Oregon, South Dakota, Utah, Washington and Wyoming. We refer to this region as our local service area.\n\nOur consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2015, which was derived from our audited consolidated financial statements, and our unaudited interim consolidated financial statements provided herein have been prepared in accordance with the instructions for Form 10-Q. Certain information and footnote disclosures normally included in financial statements prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America have been condensed or omitted pursuant to rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission (\"SEC\"); however, in our opinion, the disclosures made are adequate to make the information presented not misleading. We believe that these consolidated financial statements include all normal recurring adjustments necessary to fairly present the results for the interim periods. The consolidated results of operations for the first three months of the year are not necessarily indicative of the consolidated results of operations that might be expected for the entire year. These consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015.\n\nThe accompanying consolidated financial statements include our accounts and the accounts of our subsidiaries. Intercompany amounts and transactions with our consolidated subsidiaries have been eliminated. Transactions with our non-consolidated affiliates (referred to herein as affiliates) have not been eliminated.\n\nConnect America Fund\n\nIn 2015, CenturyLink accepted funding from the Federal Communications Commission's (\"FCC\") Connect America Fund (\"CAF\") of approximately $500 million per year for six years to fund the deployment of voice and high-speed Internet capable infrastructure for approximately 1.2 million rural households and businesses in 33 states under the CAF Phase 2 high-cost support program. The funding from the CAF Phase 2 support program in these 33 states will substantially supplant funding from the interstate Universal Service Fund (\"USF\") high-cost program that we previously utilized to support voice services in high-cost rural markets. Of these amounts, approximately $150 million is attributable to our service area, to provide service to approximately 0.3 million rural households and businesses in 13 states. In late 2015, we began receiving these support payments from the FCC under the new CAF Phase 2 support program, which included monthly support payments at a higher rate than under the interstate USF support program. During the first quarter of 2016, we recorded $24 million more revenue than in the first quarter of 2015 for the 13 states. We received a substantial one-time cumulative catch-up payment from the FCC in the third quarter of 2015, and, as a result, we do not expect funding from the CAF Phase 2 support program to materially change our operating revenues for the full year 2016 when compared to the full year 2015.\n\n8\n\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\n\nShare-based Compensation\n\nOn March 30, 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (\"FASB\") issued Accounting Standards Update (\"ASU\") 2016-09, “Improvement to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting” (“ASU 2016-09”). ASU 2016-09 modifies the accounting and associated income tax accounting for share-based compensation in order to reduce the cost and complexity associated with current generally accepted accounting principles. ASU 2016-09 is effective for us as of January 1, 2017, but early adoption may be elected. ASU 2016-09 includes different transition requirements for the different changes implemented, including some provisions which allow retrospective application. We have not determined when we will implement this standard or if we will retrospectively apply the requirements when allowed.\n\nThe primary provisions of ASU 2016-09 that we expect will affect our financial statements are: 1) a reclassification of the tax effect associated with the difference between the expense recognized for share-based payment and the associated tax deduction from additional paid-in capital to income tax expense; 2) a reclassification of the tax effect associated with the difference between compensation expense and associated deduction from financing cash flow to operating cash flow; and 3) an optional accounting policy election to account for forfeitures of share-based payment grants as they occur as opposed to our current policy of estimating the forfeitures on the grant date. These provisions would not have had a material impact on our previously issued financial statements; however, this is not necessarily representative of future impacts. Adoption of ASU 2016-09 may increase the volatility of income tax expense and cash flow from operating activities.\n\nLeases\n\nOn February 25, 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02, “Leases” (“ASU 2016-02”). The core principle of ASU 2016-02 will require lessees to present right-of-use assets and lease liabilities on their balance sheets for operating leases, which are currently not reflected on their balance sheets.\n\nASU 2016-02 is effective for annual and interim periods beginning January 1, 2019. Early adoption of ASU 2016-02 is permitted. Upon adoption of ASU 2016-02, we are required to recognize and measure leases at the beginning of the earliest period presented in our consolidated financial statements using a modified retrospective approach. The modified retrospective approach includes a number of optional practical expedients that we may elect to apply. We have not yet decided when we will adopt ASU 2016-02 or which practical expedient options we will elect. We are currently evaluating and assessing the impact ASU 2016-02 will have on us and our consolidated financial statements. As of the date of this report, we cannot provide any estimate of the impact of adopting ASU 2016-02.\n\nRevenue Recognition\n\nOn May 28, 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-09, “Revenue from Contracts with Customers” (“ASU 2014-09”). ASU 2014-09 replaces virtually all existing generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”) on revenue recognition and replaces them with a principles-based approach for determining revenue recognition using a new five step model. The core principle of ASU 2014-09 is that an entity should recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. ASU 2014-09 also includes new accounting principles related to the deferral and amortization of contract acquisition and fulfillment costs. We currently do not defer any contract acquisition costs and we defer contract fulfillment costs only up to the extent of any revenue deferred.\n\nOn July 9, 2015, the FASB approved the deferral of the effective date of ASU 2014-09 by one year until January 1, 2018. Early adoption is permitted as of January 1, 2017. ASU 2014-09 may be adopted by applying the provisions of this standard on a retrospective basis to the periods included in the financial statements or on a modified retrospective basis which would result in the recognition of a cumulative effect of adopting ASU 2014-09 in the first quarter of 2017, if adopting early, otherwise in the first quarter of 2018. We have not yet decided which implementation method we will adopt. We are studying ASU 2014-09 and are assessing the impact this standard will have on us and our consolidated financial statements. We cannot at this time, however, provide any estimate of the impact of adopting ASU 2014-09.\n\n9\n\n(2) Long-Term Debt and Revolving Promissory Note\n\nLong-term debt, including unamortized discounts and premiums, unamortized debt issuance costs and note payable - affiliate, were as follows:\n\nInterest Rates\n\nMaturities\n\nAs of March 31, 2016\n\nAs of December 31, 2015\n\n(Dollars in millions)\n\nSenior notes\n\n6.125% - 8.375%\n\n2016 - 2056\n\n$\n\n7,464\n\n7,229\n\nTerm loan\n\n2.190%\n\n2025\n\n100\n\n100\n\nCapital lease and other obligations\n\nVarious\n\nVarious\n\n17\n\n17\n\nUnamortized premiums, net\n\n11\n\n16\n\nUnamortized debt issuance costs\n\n(131\n\n)\n\n(123\n\n)\n\nTotal long-term debt\n\n7,461\n\n7,239\n\nLess current maturities\n\n(243\n\n)\n\n(242\n\n)\n\nLong-term debt, excluding current maturities\n\n$\n\n7,218\n\n6,997\n\nNote payable - affiliate\n\n6.758%\n\n2022\n\n$\n\n855\n\n855\n\nNew Issuance\n\nIn January 2016, QC issued $235 million aggregate principal amount of 7% Notes due 2056, in exchange for net proceeds, after deducting underwriting discounts and other expenses, of approximately $227 million. All of the 7% Notes are unsecured obligations and may be redeemed by QC, in whole or in part, on or after February 1, 2021, at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount redeemed plus accrued and unpaid interest to the redemption date.\n\nRevolving Promissory Note\n\nWe are currently indebted to an affiliate of our ultimate parent company, CenturyLink, under a revolving promissory note that provides us with a funding commitment of up to $1.0 billion aggregate principal amount through June 30, 2022, of which $855 million was outstanding as of March 31, 2016. As of March 31, 2016, the weighted average interest rate was 6.758%. As of March 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015, this revolving promissory note is reflected on our consolidated balance sheets as a current liability under note payable - affiliate. As of March 31, 2016, $19 million of accrued interest is reflected in other current liabilities on our consolidated balance sheet. In accordance with the note agreement, all accrued interest and unpaid interest is capitalized to the unpaid principal balance on June 1 and December 1 of each year.\n\nCovenants\n\nThe indentures governing our notes contain certain covenants including, but not limited to: (i) a prohibition on certain liens on our assets; and (ii) a limitation on mergers or sales of all, or substantially all, of our assets, which limitation requires that a successor assume the obligation with regard to these notes. These indentures do not contain any cross-default provisions.\n\nOur senior notes were issued under indentures dated April 15, 1990 and October 15, 1999. These indentures do not contain any financial covenants, but do include restrictions that limit our ability to (i) incur, issue or create liens upon our property and (ii) consolidate with or merge into, transfer or lease all or substantially all of our assets to any other party.\n\nAs of March 31, 2016, we believe we were in compliance with the provisions and covenants of our debt agreements.\n\nSubsequent Events\n\nOn May 2, 2016, QC paid at maturity the $235 million principal amount and accrued and unpaid interest due under its 8.375% Notes.\n\n(3) Fair Value Disclosure\n\nOur financial instruments consist of cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, advances to affiliates, accounts payable, note payable - affiliate and long-term debt, excluding capital lease and other obligations. Due to their short-term nature, the carrying amounts of our cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, advances to affiliates, accounts payable, and note payable - affiliate approximate their fair values.\n\n10\n\nFair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between independent and knowledgeable parties who are willing and able to transact for an asset or liability at the measurement date. We use valuation techniques that maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when determining fair value and then we rank the estimated values based on the reliability of the inputs used following the fair value hierarchy set forth by the FASB. We determined the fair values of our long-term debt, including the current portion, based on quoted market prices where available or, if not available, based on discounted future cash flows using current market interest rates.\n\nThe three input levels in the hierarchy of fair value measurements are defined by the FASB generally as follows:\n\nInput Level\n\nDescription of Input\n\nLevel 1\n\nObservable inputs such as quoted market prices in active markets.\n\nLevel 2\n\nInputs other than quoted prices in active markets that are either directly or indirectly observable.\n\nLevel 3\n\nUnobservable inputs in which little or no market data exists.\n\nThe following table presents the carrying amounts and estimated fair values of our long-term debt, excluding capital lease and other obligations, as well as the input level used to determine the fair values indicated below:\n\nAs of March 31, 2016\n\nAs of December 31, 2015\n\nInput\n\nLevel\n\nCarrying\n\nAmount\n\nFair\n\nValue\n\nCarrying\n\nAmount\n\nFair\n\nValue\n\n(Dollars in millions)\n\nLiabilities—Long-term debt, excluding capital lease and other obligations\n\n2\n\n$\n\n7,444\n\n7,704\n\n7,222\n\n7,456\n\n(4) Products and Services Revenues\n\nWe are an integrated communications company engaged primarily in providing an array of communications services, including local voice, high-speed Internet, private line (including special access), network access, Ethernet, information technology, wireless, video and other ancillary services. We strive to maintain our customer relationships by, among other things, bundling our service offerings to provide our customers with a complete offering of integrated communications services. We categorize our products, services and revenues among the following three categories:\n\n•\n\nStrategic services, which include primarily high-speed Internet, private line (including special access), Ethernet, Verizon Wireless and other ancillary services;\n\n•\n\nLegacy services, which include primarily local voice, Integrated Services Digital Network (\"ISDN\") (which use regular telephone lines to support voice, video and data applications), switched access and traditional wide area network (\"WAN\") services (which allow a local communications network to link to networks in remote locations); and\n\n•\n\nAffiliates and other services, which consist primarily of CAF support payments, USF support payments, USF surcharges and services we provide to our affiliates. We receive federal support payments from both CAF Phase 1 and CAF Phase 2 programs, and support payments from both federal and state USF programs. These support payments are government subsidies designed to reimburse us for various costs related to certain telecommunications services, including the costs of deploying, maintaining and operating voice and high-speed Internet infrastructure in high-cost rural areas where we are not able to recover our costs from our customers. USF surcharges are the amounts we collect based on specific items we list on our customers' invoices to fund the FCC's universal service programs. We provide to our affiliates, telecommunication services that we also provide to external customers. In addition, we provide to our affiliates, computer system development and support services, network support and technical services.\n\nFrom time to time, we may change the categorization of our products and services.\n\n11\n\nOur operating revenues for our products and services consisted of the following categories:\n\nThree Months Ended March 31,\n\n2016\n\n2015\n\n(Dollars in millions)\n\nStrategic services\n\n$\n\n859\n\n857\n\nLegacy services\n\n655\n\n712\n\nAffiliates and other services\n\n739\n\n648\n\nTotal operating revenues\n\n$\n\n2,253\n\n2,217\n\nWe do not have any single external customer that provides more than 10% of our total consolidated operating revenues. Substantially all of our consolidated revenues come from customers located in the United States.\n\nWe recognize revenues in our consolidated statements of operations for certain USF surcharges and transaction taxes that we bill to our customers. Our consolidated statements of operations also reflect the related expense for the amounts we remit to the government agencies. The total amount of such surcharges and transaction taxes that we included in revenues aggregated approximately $38 million and $37 million for the three months endedMarch 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. These USF surcharges, where we record revenue, are included in \"other\" operating revenues and these transaction tax surcharges are included in \"legacy services\" revenues. We also act as a collection agent for certain other USF and transaction taxes that we are required by government agencies to bill our customers, for which we do not record any revenue or expense because we only act as a pass-through agent.\n\nOur operations are integrated into and reported as part of the consolidated segment data of CenturyLink. CenturyLink's chief operating decision maker (\"CODM\") is our CODM, but reviews our financial information on an aggregate basis only in connection with our quarterly and annual reports that we file with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Consequently, we do not provide our discrete financial information to the CODM on a regular basis. As such, we believe we have one reportable segment.\n\n(5) Commitments and Contingencies\n\nPendingMatters\n\nWe are among hundreds of defendants nationwide in dozens of lawsuits filed by Sprint Communications Company and affiliates of Verizon Communications Inc. The plaintiffs in these suits have challenged the right of local exchange carriers to bill interexchange carriers for switched access charges for certain calls between mobile and wireline devices that are routed through an interexchange carrier. In the lawsuits, the plaintiffs are seeking refunds of access charges previously paid and relief from future access charges. In addition, these and some other interexchange carriers have ceased paying switched access charges on these calls. These lawsuits involving us and many other carriers have been consolidated for pretrial purposes in the United States District Court for the District of Northern Texas. In November 2015, the Court dismissed the plaintiffs' federal law claims and granted them leave to file state law claims, if any. Some of the defendants, including us, have petitioned the Federal Communications Commission to address these issues on an industry-wide basis.\n\nThe outcome of these disputes and suits, as well as any related regulatory proceedings that could ensue, are currently not predictable. If we are required to stop assessing these charges or to pay refunds of any such charges, our financial results could be negatively affected.\n\nOther Proceedings and Disputes\n\nFrom time to time, we are involved in other proceedings incidental to our business, including patent infringement allegations, administrative hearings of state public utility commissions relating primarily to our rates or services, actions relating to employee claims, various tax issues, environmental law issues, grievance hearings before labor regulatory agencies and miscellaneous third party tort actions.\n\nWe are currently defending several patent infringement lawsuits asserted against us by non-practicing entities, many of whom are seeking substantial recoveries. These cases have progressed to various stages and one or more may go to trial in the coming 24 months if they are not otherwise resolved. Where applicable, we are seeking full or partial indemnification from our vendors and suppliers. As with all litigation, we are vigorously defending these actions and, as a matter of course, are prepared to litigate these matters to judgment, as well as to evaluate and consider all reasonable settlement opportunities.\n\n12\n\nWe are subject to various federal, state and local environmental protection and health and safety laws. From time to time, we are subject to judicial and administrative proceedings brought by various governmental authorities under these laws. Several such proceedings are currently pending, but none is reasonably expected to exceed $100,000 in fines and penalties.\n\nThe outcome of these other proceedings is not predictable. However, based on current circumstances, we do not believe that the ultimate resolution of these other proceedings, after considering available defenses and any insurance coverage or indemnification rights, will have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows.\n\nCenturyLink and its affiliates are involved in several legal proceedings to which we are not a party that, if resolved against them, could have a material adverse effect on their business and financial condition. As an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of CenturyLink, our business and financial condition could be similarly affected. You can find descriptions of these legal proceedings in CenturyLink's quarterly and annual reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Because we are not a party to any of the matters, we have not accrued any liabilities for the matters.\n\n(6) Dividends\n\nDuring the three months endedMarch 31, 2016, we declared and paid dividends of $300 million to our direct parent company, Qwest Services Corporation. Dividends paid are reflected on our consolidated statements of cash flows as financing activities.\n\n(7) Other Financial Information\n\nOther Current Assets\n\nThe following table presents details of other current assets in our consolidated balance sheets:\n\nAs of March 31, 2016\n\nAs of December 31, 2015\n\n(Dollars in millions)\n\nPrepaid expenses\n\n$\n\n62\n\n46\n\nOther\n\n84\n\n77\n\nTotal other current assets\n\n$\n\n146\n\n123\n\nSelected Current Liabilities\n\nCurrent liabilities reflected in our consolidated balance sheets include accounts payable:\n\nAs of March 31, 2016\n\nAs of December 31, 2015\n\n(Dollars in millions)\n\nAccounts payable\n\n$\n\n445\n\n369\n\nIncluded in accounts payable at March 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015, were $26 million and $29 million, respectively, associated with capital expenditures.\n\n13\n\nITEM 2. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\n\nUnless the context requires otherwise, references in this report to \"QC\" refer to Qwest Corporation, and references to \"Qwest,\" \"we,\" \"us\" and \"our\" refer to Qwest Corporation and its consolidated subsidiaries.\n\nAll references to \"Notes\" in this Item 2 of Part I refer to the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 1 of Part I of this report.\n\nCertain statements in this report constitute forward-looking statements. See the last paragraph of this Item 2 of Part I and \"Risk Factors\" in Item 1A of Part II of this report for a discussion of certain factors that could cause our actual results to differ from our anticipated results or otherwise impact our business, financial condition, results of operations, liquidity or prospects.\n\nOverview\n\nManagement's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (\"MD&A\") included herein should be read in conjunction with MD&A and the other information included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015, and with the consolidated financial statements and related notes in Item 1 of Part I of this report. The results of operations for the first three months of the year are not necessarily indicative of the results of operations that might be expected for the entire year.\n\nWe are an integrated communications company engaged primarily in providing an array of communications services to our residential and business customers. Our communications services include local voice, high-speed Internet, private line (including special access), network access, Ethernet, information technology, video, wireless and other ancillary services. In certain local and regional markets, we also provide local access and fiber transport services to competitive local exchange carriers. We strive to maintain our customer relationships by, among other things, bundling our service offerings to provide our customers with a complete offering of integrated communications services.\n\nWe generate the majority of our total consolidated operating revenues from services provided in the 14-state region of Arizona, Colorado, Idaho, Iowa, Minnesota, Montana, Nebraska, New Mexico, North Dakota, Oregon, South Dakota, Utah, Washington and Wyoming. We refer to this region as our local service area.\n\nOur ultimate parent company, CenturyLink, Inc. (\"CenturyLink\"), has cash management arrangements between certain of its subsidiaries that include lines of credit, affiliate obligations, capital contributions and dividends. As part of these cash management arrangements, affiliates provide lines of credit to certain other affiliates. Amounts outstanding under these lines of credit and intercompany obligations vary from time to time. Under these arrangements, the majority of our cash balance is advanced on a daily basis to CenturyLink. From time to time we may declare and pay dividends to Qwest Services Corporation (\"QSC\"), our direct parent, using cash owed to us under these advances, which has the net effect of reducing the amount of these advances. We report the balance of these transfers on our consolidated balance sheet as advances to affiliates.\n\nFor the reasons noted in Note 4—Products and Services Revenues to our consolidated financial statements in Item 1 of Part I of this report, we believe we have one reportable segment. We categorize our products, services and revenues among the following three categories:\n\n•\n\nStrategic services, which include primarily high-speed Internet, private line (including special access), Ethernet, Verizon Wireless and other ancillary services;\n\n•\n\nLegacy services, which include primarily local voice, Integrated Services Digital Network (\"ISDN\") (which use regular telephone lines to support voice, video and data applications), switched access and traditional wide area network (\"WAN\") services (which allow a local communications network to link to networks in remote locations); and\n\n•\n\nAffiliates and other services, which consist primarily of Connect America Fund (\"CAF\") support payments, Universal Service Fund (\"USF\") support payments, USF surcharges and services we provide to our affiliates. We receive federal support payments from both CAF Phase 1 and CAF Phase 2 programs, and support payments from both federal and state USF programs. These support payments are government subsidies designed to reimburse us for various costs related to certain telecommunications services, including the costs of deploying, maintaining and operating voice and high-speed Internet infrastructure in high-cost rural areas where we are not able to recover our costs from our customers. USF surcharges are the amounts we collect based on specific items we list on our customers' invoices to fund the Federal Communications Commission's (\"FCC\") universal service programs. We provide to our affiliates, telecommunication services that we also provide to external customers. In addition, we provide to our affiliates, computer system development and support services, network support and technical services.\n\nFrom time to time, we may change the categorization of our products and services.\n\n14\n\nAt March 31, 2016, we operated approximately 6.9 million access lines and served approximately 3.6 million high-speed Internet subscribers. Our methodology for counting access lines and high-speed Internet subscribers, which is described further in the operational metrics table below under \"Results of Operations\", may not be comparable to those of other companies.\n\nThe following analysis is organized to provide the information we believe will be useful for understanding material trends affecting our business.\n\nBusiness Trends\n\nOur financial results were impacted by several significant trends, which are described below. We expect that these trends will continue to affect our results of operations, cash flows or financial position.\n\n•\n\nStrategic services. We continue to see shifts in the makeup of our total revenues as customers move to lower margin strategic services, such as high-speed Internet and video services, from higher margin legacy services. Revenues from our strategic services represented 38% and 39% of our total revenues for the three months endedMarch 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. During 2015, we experienced price compression due to competition, which negatively impacted the growth of our strategic revenues. We continue to focus on increasing subscribers of our high-speed Internet services, particularly among consumer and small business customers. We believe that continually increasing the scope and connection speeds of our high-speed Internet services is important to remaining competitive in our industry. As a result, we continue to invest in our broadband network, which allows for the delivery of higher speed broadband services to a greater number of customers. We compete in a maturing broadband market in which most customers already have broadband services and growth rates in new subscribers have slowed. Moreover, as described further in \"Risk Factors\" in Item 1A of Part II of this report, demand for our high-speed Internet services could be adversely affected by competitors continuing to provide services at higher broadband speeds than ours or expanding their advanced wireless data service offerings. Demand for our private line services (including special access) continues to decline due to customers' optimization of their networks, industry consolidation and technological migration to higher-speed services. Additionally, we face competition in Ethernet based services in the wholesale market from cable companies and fiber based CLEC providers;\n\n•\n\nLegacy services. Revenues from our legacy services represented 29% and 32% of our total revenues for the three months endedMarch 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. We expect these percentages to continue to decline. Our legacy services revenues have been, and we expect they will continue to be adversely affected by access line losses and price compression. Intense competition and product substitution continue to drive our access line losses. For example, many consumers are replacing traditional voice telecommunications service with substitute services, including (i) cable and wireless voice services and (ii) electronic mail, texting and social networking services. We expect that these factors will continue to negatively impact our business. As a result of the expected loss of revenue associated with access lines, we continue to offer our customers service bundling and other product promotions to help mitigate this trend, as described below;\n\n•\n\nService bundling and product promotions. We offer our customers the ability to bundle multiple products and services. These customers can bundle local services with other services such as high-speed Internet, video and wireless. While we believe our bundled service offerings can help retain customers, they also tend to lower our profit margins; and\n\n•\n\nOperating efficiencies. We continue to evaluate our operating structure and focus. This involves balancing our workforce in response to our workload requirements, productivity improvements and changes in industry, competitive, technological and regulatory conditions.\n\nWhile these trends are important to understanding and evaluating our financial results, the other transactions, events, uncertainties and trends discussed in \"Risk Factors\" in Item 1A of Part II of this report may also materially impact our business operations and financial results.\n\n15\n\nResults of Operations\n\nThe following table summarizes the results of our consolidated operations:\n\nThree Months Ended March 31,\n\n2016\n\n2015\n\n(Dollars in millions)\n\nOperating revenues\n\n$\n\n2,253\n\n2,217\n\nOperating expenses\n\n1,628\n\n1,672\n\nOperating income\n\n625\n\n545\n\nOther expense, net\n\n(133\n\n)\n\n(131\n\n)\n\nIncome tax expense\n\n188\n\n167\n\nNet income\n\n$\n\n304\n\n247\n\nThe following table summarizes our access lines, high-speed Internet subscribers and number of employees:\n\nAs of March 31,\n\nIncrease/\n\n(Decrease)\n\n% Change\n\n2016\n\n2015\n\n(in thousands)\n\nOperational metrics:\n\nTotal access lines (1)\n\n6,924\n\n7,271\n\n(347\n\n)\n\n(5\n\n)%\n\nTotal high-speed Internet subscribers (1)\n\n3,556\n\n3,558\n\n(2\n\n)\n\n—\n\n%\n\nTotal employees\n\n22.8\n\n22.8\n\n—\n\n—\n\n%\n\n_______________________________________________________________________________\n\n(1) Access lines are lines reaching from the customers' premises to a connection with the public network and high-speed Internet subscribers are customers that purchase high-speed Internet connection service through their existing telephone lines, stand-alone telephone lines, or fiber-optic cables. Our methodology for counting our access lines and high-speed Internet subscribers includes only those lines that we use to provide services to external customers and excludes lines used solely by us and our affiliates. It also excludes unbundled loops and includes stand-alone high-speed Internet subscribers. We count lines when we install the service.\n\nOperating Revenues\n\nThe following table summarizes our consolidated operating revenues recorded under our three revenue categories:\n\nThree Months Ended March 31,\n\nIncrease/\n\n(Decrease)\n\n% Change\n\n2016\n\n2015\n\n(Dollars in millions)\n\nStrategic services\n\n$\n\n859\n\n857\n\n2\n\n—\n\n%\n\nLegacy services\n\n655\n\n712\n\n(57\n\n)\n\n(8\n\n)%\n\nAffiliates and other services\n\n739\n\n648\n\n91\n\n14\n\n%\n\nTotal operating revenues\n\n$\n\n2,253\n\n2,217\n\n36\n\n2\n\n%\n\nStrategic Services\n\nStrategic services revenues increased by $2 million, or less than 1%, for the three months endedMarch 31, 2016 as compared to the three months endedMarch 31, 2015. The increase in our strategic services revenue was primarily due to price increases for high-speed Internet services, volume increases in Ethernet services and price increases for other services, which were substantially offset by volume decreases in our private line services revenues.\n\nLegacy Services\n\nLegacy services revenues decreased by $57 million, or 8%, for the three months endedMarch 31, 2016 as compared to the three months endedMarch 31, 2015. The decline in our legacy services revenues was the result of lower local voice services revenues due to access line loss and reduced access services usage related to customer migration, competitive pressures and product substitution.\n\n16\n\nAffiliates and Other Services\n\nAffiliates and other services revenues increased by $91 million, or 14%, for the three months endedMarch 31, 2016 as compared to the three months endedMarch 31, 2015. The increase in our affiliates and other services revenues was primarily due to the additional revenue recorded under the FCC's CAF Phase 2 high-cost support program and increases in volume and in the rates we charge for our support services we provided to affiliates. For additional information about the impact of the CAF Phase 2 program, see Note 1—Basis of Presentation to our consolidated financial statements in Item 1 of Part I of this report.\n\nOperating Expenses\n\nThe following table summarizes our consolidated operating expenses:\n\nThree Months Ended March 31,\n\nIncrease/\n\n(Decrease)\n\n% Change\n\n2016\n\n2015\n\n(Dollars in millions)\n\nCost of services and products (exclusive of depreciation and amortization)\n\n$\n\n708\n\n692\n\n16\n\n2\n\n%\n\nSelling, general and administrative\n\n250\n\n270\n\n(20\n\n)\n\n(7\n\n)%\n\nOperating expenses - affiliates\n\n251\n\n248\n\n3\n\n1\n\n%\n\nDepreciation and amortization\n\n419\n\n462\n\n(43\n\n)\n\n(9\n\n)%\n\nTotal operating expenses\n\n$\n\n1,628\n\n1,672\n\n(44\n\n)\n\n(3\n\n)%\n\nCost of Services and Products (exclusive of depreciation and amortization)\n\nCost of services and products (exclusive of depreciation and amortization) are expenses incurred in providing products and services to our customers. These expenses include: employee-related expenses directly attributable to operating and maintaining our network (such as salaries, wages, benefits and professional fees); facilities expenses (which include third-party telecommunications expenses we incur for using other carriers' networks to provide services to our customers); rents and utilities expenses; equipment sales expenses (such as modem expenses); payments of universal service funds (which are federal and state funds that are established to promote the availability of telecommunications services to all consumers at reasonable and affordable rates, among other things, and to which we are often required to contribute); litigation expenses associated with our operations; and other expenses directly related to our operations.\n\nCost of services and products (exclusive of depreciation and amortization) increased by $16 million, or 2%, for the three months endedMarch 31, 2016 as compared to the three months endedMarch 31, 2015. The increase in our cost of services and products (exclusive of depreciation and amortization) was primarily due to increases in facility cost and allocated corporate costs from affiliates, which were partially offset by reductions in salaries and wages and professional fees.\n\nSelling, General and Administrative\n\nSelling, general and administrative expenses are expenses incurred in selling products and services to our customers, corporate overhead and other operating expenses. These expenses include: employee-related expenses (such as salaries, wages, internal commissions, benefits and professional fees) directly attributable to selling products or services and employee-related expenses for administrative functions; marketing and advertising; property and other operating taxes and fees; external commissions; litigation expenses associated with general matters; bad debt expense; and other selling, general and administrative expenses.\n\nSelling, general and administrative expenses decreased by $20 million, or 7%, for the three months endedMarch 31, 2016 as compared to the three months endedMarch 31, 2015. The decrease in our selling, general and administrative expenses was primarily due to reductions in salaries and wages, employee benefits expense and professional fees.\n\nOperating Expenses - Affiliates\n\nSince CenturyLink's acquisition of us, we have incurred affiliates expenses related to our use of telecommunication services, marketing and employee related support services provided by CenturyLink and its subsidiaries.\n\nOperating expenses - affiliates increased by $3 million, or 1%, for the three months endedMarch 31, 2016 as compared to the three months endedMarch 31, 2015. The increase in operating expense - affiliates was primarily due to an increase in the rates we are charged for support services and higher levels of services provided to us by affiliates.\n\n17\n\nDepreciation and Amortization\n\nThe following table provides detail of our depreciation and amortization expense:\n\nThree Months Ended March 31,\n\nIncrease/\n\n(Decrease)\n\n% Change\n\n2016\n\n2015\n\n(Dollars in millions)\n\nDepreciation\n\n$\n\n222\n\n240\n\n(18\n\n)\n\n(8\n\n)%\n\nAmortization\n\n197\n\n222\n\n(25\n\n)\n\n(11\n\n)%\n\nTotal depreciation and amortization\n\n$\n\n419\n\n462\n\n(43\n\n)\n\n(9\n\n)%\n\nDepreciation expense is impacted by several factors, including changes in our depreciable cost basis, changes in our estimates of the remaining economic life of certain network assets and the addition of new plant. Depreciation expense decreased by $18 million, or 8%, for the three months ended March 31, 2016 as compared to the three months ended March 31, 2015. The depreciation expense related to our plant for the three months endedMarch 31, 2016 was lower than the depreciation expense for the three months endedMarch 31, 2015 due to full depreciation and retirement of certain plant placed in service prior to 2016. This decrease was partially offset by an increase in depreciation expense attributable to new plant placed in service since March 31, 2015.\n\nAmortization expense decreased by $25 million, or 11%, for the three months ended March 31, 2016 as compared to the three months ended March 31, 2015. The decrease in amortization expense was primarily due to software becoming fully amortized faster than new software was acquired or developed.\n\nOther Consolidated Results\n\nThe following table summarizes our total other expense, net and income tax expense:\n\nThree Months Ended March 31,\n\nIncrease/\n\n(Decrease)\n\n% Change\n\n2016\n\n2015\n\n(Dollars in millions)\n\nInterest expense\n\n$\n\n(121\n\n)\n\n(118\n\n)\n\n3\n\n3\n\n%\n\nInterest expense - affiliate\n\n(14\n\n)\n\n(13\n\n)\n\n1\n\n8\n\n%\n\nOther income, net\n\n2\n\n—\n\n2\n\n100\n\n%\n\nTotal other expense, net\n\n$\n\n(133\n\n)\n\n(131\n\n)\n\n2\n\n2\n\n%\n\nIncome tax expense\n\n$\n\n188\n\n167\n\n21\n\n13\n\n%\n\nInterest Expense\n\nInterest expense increased by $3 million, or 3%, for the three months endedMarch 31, 2016 as compared to the three months endedMarch 31, 2015. This increase in interest expense was primarily due to slightly higher average debt outstanding. See Note 2—Long-Term Debt and Revolving Promissory Note to our consolidated financial statements in Item 1 of Part I of this report and Liquidity and Capital Resources below for additional information about our debt.\n\nInterest Expense - Affiliates, Net\n\nAffiliate interest expense remained substantially unchanged for the three months ended March 31, 2016 as compared to the three months ended March 31, 2015.\n\nIncome Tax Expense\n\nIncome tax expense for the three months endedMarch 31, 2016 was $188 million, or an effective tax rate of 38.2%, compared to $167 million, or an effective tax rate of 40.3%, for the three months endedMarch 31, 2015. The 2016 rate includes the effect of changes in state apportionment factors. The 2015 rate includes the effect of regulatory fines associated with a 911 system outage and state tax rate changes.\n\n18\n\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\n\nOverview\n\nWe are an indirectly wholly-owned subsidiary of CenturyLink. As such, factors relating to, or affecting, CenturyLink's liquidity and capital resources could have material impacts on us, including impacts on our credit ratings, our access to capital markets and changes in the financial market's perception of us.\n\nCenturyLink has cash management arrangements between certain of its subsidiaries that include lines of credit, affiliate advances and obligations, capital contributions and dividends. As part of these cash management arrangements, affiliates provide lines of credit to certain other affiliates. Amounts outstanding under these lines of credit and intercompany obligations vary from time to time. Under these arrangements, the majority of our cash balance is advanced on a daily basis to CenturyLink. From time to time we may declare and pay dividends to our stockholder, QSC, in excess of our earnings to the extent permitted by applicable law, using cash owed to us under these advances, which has the net effect of reducing the amount of these advances. Our debt covenants do not currently limit the amount of dividends we can pay to QSC. Given our cash management arrangement with our ultimate parent, CenturyLink, and the resulting amounts due to us from CenturyLink, a significant component of our liquidity is dependent upon CenturyLink's ability to repay its obligation to us.\n\nAt March 31, 2016, we had a working capital deficit of $505 million, reflecting current liabilities of $2.517 billion and current assets of $2.012 billion, compared to a working capital deficit of approximately $820 million as of December 31, 2015. We have historically operated with a working capital deficit due to our practice of declaring and paying regular cash dividends to QSC. As long as we continue declaring and paying cash dividends to QSC, it is likely that we will continue to operate with a working capital deficit in the future. We anticipate that our future liquidity needs will be met through (i) our cash provided by our operating activities, (ii) amounts due to us from CenturyLink and (iii) capital contributions, advances or loans from CenturyLink or its affiliates if and to the extent they have available funds or access to available funds that they are willing and able to contribute, advance or loan.\n\nCapital Expenditures\n\nWe incur capital expenditures on an ongoing basis in order to enhance and modernize our networks, compete effectively in our markets and expand our service offerings. CenturyLink evaluates capital expenditure projects based on a variety of factors, including expected strategic impacts (such as forecasted impact on revenue growth, productivity, expenses, service levels and customer retention) and the expected return on investment. The amount of CenturyLink’s consolidated capital investment is influenced by, among other things, demand for CenturyLink’s services and products, cash flow generated by operating activities, cash required for other purposes and regulatory considerations (such as our CAF Phase 2 infrastructure buildout requirements discussed below). Based on the type and volume of services we provide, approximately 38% to 43% of CenturyLink’s annual consolidated capital expenditures have been attributed over the last couple of years to us for use in our operations. For more information on CenturyLink’s total capital expenditures, please see its annual and quarterly reports filed with the SEC.\n\nOur capital expenditures continue to be focused on our strategic services. For more information on our capital spending, see Item 1of Part I of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015.\n\nDebt and Other Financing Arrangements\n\nSubject to market conditions, and to the extent feasible, we expect to continue to issue debt securities from time to time in the future to refinance a substantial portion of our maturing debt. The availability, interest rate and other terms of any new borrowings will depend on the ratings assigned to us by credit rating agencies, among other factors. We have no debt maturities due during the remainder of 2016.\n\nAs of the date of this report, the credit ratings for our senior unsecured debt were as follows:\n\nAgency\n\nCredit Ratings\n\nStandard & Poor's\n\nBBB-\n\nMoody's Investors Service, Inc. (1)\n\nBa1\n\nFitch Ratings\n\nBBB-\n\n____________________________________________________________________________\n\n(1)\n\nOn March 15, 2016, Moody's Investors Service, Inc. downgraded CenturyLink's rating from Ba2 to Ba3 and downgraded Qwest Corporation's rating from Baa3 to Ba1.\n\n19\n\nOur credit ratings are reviewed and adjusted from time to time by the rating agencies, and downgrades could impact CenturyLink's and our access to debt capital or further raise CenturyLink's and our borrowing costs. Additional downgrades of CenturyLink's senior unsecured debt ratings could, under certain circumstances, incrementally increase the cost of CenturyLink's borrowing under its revolving credit facility, which could indirectly impact us. See \"Risk Factors—Risks Affecting our Liquidity and Capital Resources\" in Item 1A of Part II of this report.\n\nOn May 2, 2016, QC paid at maturity the $235 million principal amount and accrued and unpaid interest due under its 8.375% Notes.\n\nTerm Loan\n\nIn 2015, we entered into a term loan in the amount of $100 million with CoBank, ACB. The outstanding unpaid principal amount of this term loan plus any accrued and unpaid interest is due on February 20, 2025. Interest is paid monthly based upon either the London Interbank Offered Rate (“LIBOR”) or the base rate (as defined in the credit agreement) plus an applicable margin between 1.50% to 2.50% per annum for LIBOR loans and 0.50% to 1.50% per annum for base rate loans depending on our then current senior unsecured long-term debt rating. As of March 31, 2016, the outstanding principal balance on this term loan was $100 million.\n\nRevolving Promissory Note\n\nWe are currently indebted to an affiliate of CenturyLink under a revolving promissory note that provides us with a funding commitment of up to $1.0 billion aggregate principal amount through June 30, 2022, of which $855 million was outstanding as of March 31, 2016. The revolving promissory note is due on demand and ranks equally to our outstanding Senior Notes. Interest is accrued on the outstanding balance using a weighted average per annum interest rate of CenturyLink's outstanding borrowings for the interest period. As of March 31, 2016, the weighted average interest rate was 6.758%. As of March 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015, this revolving promissory note is reflected on our consolidated balance sheets as a current liability under note payable - affiliate. As of March 31, 2016, $19 million of accrued interest is reflected in other current liabilities on our consolidated balance sheet.\n\nDividends\n\nWe periodically pay dividends to our direct parent company. See Note 6—Dividends and the discussion above under the heading \"Overview\".\n\nPension and Post-retirement Benefit Obligations\n\nCenturyLink is subject to material obligations under its existing defined benefit pension plans and post-retirement benefit plans. At December 31, 2015, the accounting unfunded status of CenturyLink's qualified and non-qualified defined benefit pension plans and post-retirement benefit plans was $2.277 billion and $3.374 billion, respectively. For additional information about CenturyLink's pension and post-retirement benefit arrangements, see \"Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates—Pensions and Post-Retirement Benefits\" in Item 7 of CenturyLink's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015, and see Note 7—Employee Benefits to the consolidated financial statements in Item 8 of Part II of the same report.\n\nA substantial portion of our active and retired employees participate in CenturyLink's qualified Combined Pension Plan and post-retirement benefit plans. On December 31, 2014, the Qwest Communications International Inc. (\"QCII\") pension plan and a pension plan of an affiliate were merged into the CenturyLink Retirement Plan, which was renamed the CenturyLink Combined Pension Plan. Our contributions are not segregated or restricted to pay amounts due to our employees and may be used to provide benefits to other employees of our affiliates. Prior to the pension plan merger, the above-noted employees participated in the QCII pension plan.\n\nThe affiliate obligations, net in current and noncurrent liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets represents the cumulative allocation of expense, net of payments, associated with QCII's pension plans and post-retirement benefits plans prior to the plan mergers. In 2015, we agreed to a plan to settle the outstanding pension and post-retirement affiliate obligations, net balance with QCII over a 30 year term. Payments will be made on a monthly basis. For the three months ended March 31, 2016, we made a settlement payment of $24 million to QCII on our affiliate obligations, net balance. Changes in the affiliate obligations, net are reflected in operating activities on our consolidated statements of cash flows. For the year ending December 31, 2016, we expect to make a settlement payment of $97 million to QCII on our affiliate obligations, net balance.\n\nFor 2016, CenturyLink's estimated annual long-term rate of return is 7.0% for both the pension plan trust assets and post-retirement plans trust assets, based on the assets currently held. However, actual returns could be substantially different.\n\n20\n\nFor additional information, see “Risk Factors—Risks Affecting Our Liquidity and Capital Resources—Adverse changes in the value of assets or obligations associated with CenturyLink’s qualified pension plan could negatively impact CenturyLink’s liquidity, which may in turn affect our business and liquidity” in Item 1A of Part II of this report.\n\nConnect America Fund\n\nIn 2015, CenturyLink accepted CAF funding from the FCC of approximately $500 million per year for six years to fund the deployment of voice and high-speed Internet infrastructure for approximately 1.2 million rural households and businesses in 33 states under the CAF Phase 2 support program. Of these amounts, approximately $150 million is attributable to our service area, to provide service to approximately 0.3 million rural households and businesses in 13 states. The funding from the CAF Phase 2 support program is expected to substantially supplant the funding we previously received from the interstate USF program that we previously utilized to support voice services in high-cost rural markets in these 13 states. In late 2015, we began receiving these payments from the FCC under the new CAF Phase 2 support program, which included monthly support payments at a higher rate than under the interstate USF support program. We received a substantial one-time cumulative catch-up payment from the FCC in the third quarter of 2015, and, as a result, we do not expect our funding from the CAF Phase 2 support program to materially change our operating revenues for the full year 2016 when compared to the full year 2015.\n\nCenturyLink and we declined annual funding of approximately $8 million in one state, and we expect the funding from the CAF Phase 2 support program for this one state will be auctioned by the FCC, perhaps in the latter part of 2016. In this one state, the interstate USF support we have historically received is expected to continue until the CAF Phase 2 auctions are completed.\n\nAs a result of accepting CAF Phase 2 support payments for 13 states, we will be obligated to make substantial capital expenditures to build infrastructure. See \"Capital Expenditures\" above.\n\nFor additional information on the FCC's CAF order and the USF program, see \"Business—Regulation\" in Item 1 of Part I of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015 and see \"Risk Factors—Risks Affecting our Liquidity and Capital Resources\" in Item 1A of Part II of this report.\n\nIn 2013, under the second round of the first phase of the CAF program, CenturyLink received $40 million in funding, $15 million attributed to our service areas, for deployment of high-speed Internet services in rural areas. For various reasons, we failed to meet certain broadband deployment requirements by specified deadlines, but we are currently engaged in discussions with the FCC on possible courses of action, which includes our request for relief and an extension of the deadlines. If the FCC does not grant us relief, we anticipate that we will be requested to refund a substantial portion of the $15 million in funding we received. As of March 31, 2016, we have included approximately $10 million of CAF 1 Round 2 funding in other current liabilities and the remaining approximately $5 million of funding in other noncurrent liabilities on our consolidated balance sheet.\n\nFuture Contractual Obligations\n\nFor information regarding our estimated future contractual obligations, see the MD&A discussion included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015.\n\nHistorical Information\n\nThe following table summarizes our consolidated cash flow activities:\n\nThree Months Ended March 31,\n\nIncrease / (Decrease)\n\n2016\n\n2015\n\n(Dollars in millions)\n\nCash Flows Provided By (Used In)\n\nNet cash provided by operating activities\n\n$\n\n747\n\n727\n\n20\n\nNet cash used in investing activities\n\n(669\n\n)\n\n(520\n\n)\n\n149\n\nNet cash used in financing activities\n\n(77\n\n)\n\n(207\n\n)\n\n(130\n\n)\n\nNet cash provided by operating activities increased by $20 million for the three months endedMarch 31, 2016 as compared to the three months endedMarch 31, 2015 primarily due to an increase in net income (which was directly impacted by the cash received from the CAF Phase 2 support program, which was $24 million greater than the cash we received in the first quarter of 2015) adjusted for non-cash items and a positive variance in the change in accounts payable offset by a negative variance in the change in other current assets and liabilities, net. For additional information about our operating results, see \"Results of Operations\" above.\n\n21\n\nNet cash used in investing activities increased by $149 million for the three months endedMarch 31, 2016 as compared to the three months endedMarch 31, 2015 primarily due to a negative variance in the change in the amount of funds advanced to our affiliates and a slight increase in payments for property, plant and equipment.\n\nNet cash used in financing activities decreased by $130 million for the three months endedMarch 31, 2016 as compared to the three months endedMarch 31, 2015 primarily due to an increase in the amount of proceeds from debt issuance. For additional information regarding our financing activities, see Note 2—Long-Term Debt and Revolving Promissory Note to our consolidated financial statements in Item 1 of this report.\n\nIn January 2016, QC issued $235 million aggregate principal amount of 7% Notes due 2056, in exchange for net proceeds, after deducting underwriting discounts and other expenses, of approximately $227 million. All of the 7% Notes are unsecured obligations and may be redeemed by QC, in whole or in part, on or after February 1, 2021, at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount redeemed plus accrued and unpaid interest to the redemption date.\n\nOther Matters\n\nIn February 2015, the FCC adopted new regulations that regulate Internet services as a public utility under Title II of the Communications Act. In light of pending litigation, we believe it is premature for us to determine the ultimate impact of the new regulations on our operations; however, we currently expect that they will negatively impact our operations. For additional information, see “Risk Factors—Risks Relating to Legal and Regulatory Matters” in Item 1A of Part II of this report.\n\nCenturyLink and its affiliates are involved in several legal proceedings to which we are not a party that, if resolved against them, could have a material adverse effect on their business and financial condition. As a wholly-owned subsidiary of CenturyLink, our business and financial condition could be similarly affected. You can find descriptions of these legal proceedings in CenturyLink's quarterly and annual reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (\"SEC\"). Because we are not a party to any of the matters, we have not accrued any liabilities for these matters as of March 31, 2016.\n\nMarket Risk\n\nWe are exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates on our variable rate long-term debt obligations and revolving promissory note. We seek to maintain a favorable mix of fixed and variable rate debt in an effort to limit interest costs and cash flow volatility resulting from changes in rates.\n\nManagement periodically reviews our exposure to interest rate fluctuations and periodically implements strategies to manage the exposure. From time to time, we have used derivative instruments to (i) lock-in or swap our exposure to changing or variable interest rates for fixed interest rates or (ii) to swap obligations to pay fixed interest rates for variable interest rates. As of March 31, 2016, we had no such instruments outstanding. We have established policies and procedures for risk assessment and the approval, reporting and monitoring of derivative instrument activities. We do not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes.\n\nCertain shortcomings are inherent in the method of analysis presented in the computation of exposures to market risks. Actual values may differ materially from those disclosed by us from time to time if market conditions vary from the assumptions used in the analyses performed. These analyses only incorporate the risk exposures that existed at March 31, 2016.\n\nWe do not believe that there were any material changes to market risks arising from changes in interest rates for the three months ended March 31, 2016, when compared to the disclosures provided in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015.\n\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\n\nWe have no special purpose or limited purpose entities that provide off-balance sheet financing, liquidity, or market or credit risk support and we do not engage in leasing, hedging or other similar activities that expose us to any significant liabilities that are not (i) reflected on the face of the consolidated financial statements, (ii) disclosed in Note 15—Commitments and Contingencies to our consolidated financial statements in Item 8 of Part II of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015 or (iii) discussed under the heading \"Market Risk\" above.\n\n22\n\nOther Information\n\nCenturyLink's and our website is www.centurylink.com. We routinely post important investor information in the \"Investor Relations\" section of our website at ir.centurylink.com. The information contained on, or that may be accessed through, our website is not part of this quarterly report. You may obtain free electronic copies of our annual reports on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, current reports on Form 8-K and all amendments to those reports in the \"Investor Relations\" section of our website (ir.centurylink.com) under the heading \"SEC Filings.\" These reports are available on our website as soon as reasonably practicable after we electronically file them with the SEC.\n\nIn addition to historical information, this MD&A includes certain forward-looking statements that are based upon our judgment and assumptions as of the date of this report concerning future developments and events, many of which are beyond our control. These forward-looking statements, and the assumptions upon which they are based, are not guarantees of future results, are inherently speculative and are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties. Actual events and results may differ materially from those anticipated, estimated, projected or implied by us in those statements if one or more of these risks or uncertainties materialize, or if underlying assumptions prove incorrect. Factors that could affect actual results include but are not limited to: the effects of competition from a wide variety of competitive providers, including lower demand for our legacy offerings; the effects of new, emerging or competing technologies, including those that could make our products less desirable or obsolete; the effects of ongoing changes in the regulation of the communications industry, including the outcome of regulatory or judicial proceedings relating to intercarrier compensation, interconnection obligations, access charges, universal service, broadband deployment, data protection and net neutrality; our ability to effectively adjust to changes in the communications industry, and changes in the composition of our markets and product mix; possible changes in the demand for, or pricing of, our products and services, including our ability to effectively respond to increased demand for high-speed broadband service; our ability to successfully maintain the quality and profitability of our existing product and service offerings and to introduce new offerings on a timely and cost-effective basis; the adverse impact on our business and network from possible equipment failures, service outages, security breaches or similar events impacting our network; our ability to generate cash flows sufficient to fund our financial commitments and objectives, including our capital expenditures, operating costs, dividends, pension contributions and debt payments; changes in our operating plans, corporate strategies, dividend payment plans or other capital allocation plans, whether based upon changes in our cash flows, cash requirements, financial performance, financial position, or otherwise; our ability to effectively retain and hire key personnel and to successfully negotiate collective bargaining agreements on reasonable terms without work stoppages; increases in the costs of CenturyLink's pension, health, post-employment or other benefits, including those caused by changes in markets, interest rates, mortality rates, demographics or regulations, which may in turn affect our business and liquidity; adverse changes in our access to credit markets on favorable terms, whether caused by changes in our financial position, lower debt credit ratings, unstable markets or otherwise; our ability to maintain favorable relations with our key business partners, suppliers, vendors, landlords and financial institutions; our ability to effectively manage our network buildout project and other expansion opportunities; our ability to collect our receivables from financially troubled customers; any adverse developments in legal or regulatory proceedings involving us or our affiliates (including CenturyLink); changes in tax, communications, pension, healthcare or other laws or regulations, in governmental support programs, or in general government funding levels; the effects of changes in accounting policies or practices, including potential future impairment charges; the effects of adverse weather or other natural or man-made disasters; the effects of more general factors such as changes in interest rates, in operating costs, in general market, labor, economic or geo-political conditions, or in public policy; and other risks referenced in Item 1A or elsewhere in this Quarterly Report or other of our filings with the SEC. You should be aware that new factors may emerge from time to time and it is not possible for us to identify all such factors nor can we predict the impact of each such factor on the business or the extent to which any one or more factors may cause actual results to differ from those reflected in any forward-looking statements. Given these uncertainties, we caution investors not to unduly rely upon our forward-looking statements. We undertake no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements for any reason, whether as a result of new information, future events or developments, changed circumstances, or otherwise. Furthermore, any information about our intentions contained in any of our forward-looking statements reflects our intentions as of the date of this report, and is based upon, among other things, existing regulatory, technological, industry, competitive, economic and market conditions, and our assumptions as of such date. We may change our intentions, strategies or plans at any time and without notice, based upon any changes in such factors, in our assumptions or otherwise.\n\n23\n\nITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK\n\nWe have omitted this information pursuant to General Instruction H(2).\n\nITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES\n\nDisclosure Controls and Procedures\n\nThe Company maintains disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the “Exchange Act”)) designed to provide reasonable assurance that the information required to be disclosed by the Company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC’s rules and forms. These include controls and procedures designed to ensure that this information is accumulated and communicated to the Company’s management, including its Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Management, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer, Glen F. Post, III, and our Chief Financial Officer, R. Stewart Ewing, Jr., evaluated the effectiveness of the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures as of March 31, 2016. Based on this evaluation, the Company’s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of March 31, 2016, in providing reasonable assurance that the information required to be disclosed by us in this report was accumulated and communicated in the manner provided above.\n\nThe effectiveness of our or any system of disclosure controls and procedures is subject to certain limitations, including the exercise of judgment in designing, implementing and evaluating the controls and procedures, the assumptions used in identifying the likelihood of future events and the inability to eliminate misconduct completely. As a result, there can be no assurance that our disclosure controls and procedures will detect all errors or fraud. By their nature, our or any system of disclosure controls and procedures can provide only reasonable assurance regarding management's control objectives.\n\nChanges in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\n\nThere were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the first quarter of 2016 that materially affected, or that we believe are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.\n\n24\n\nPART II—OTHER INFORMATION\n\nITEM 1. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS\n\nThe information contained in Note 5—Commitments and Contingencies included in Item 1 of Part I of this report is incorporated herein by reference.\n\nITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS\n\nThe following discussion of “risk factors” identifies the most significant risks or uncertainties that could (i) materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, liquidity or prospects or (ii) cause our actual results to differ materially from our anticipated results or other expectations. You should carefully consider these factors, in addition to the other information set forth in this report and our subsequent filings with the SEC, when evaluating our business and whether to purchase, sell or hold our securities. Please note that the following discussion is not intended to comprehensively list all risks or uncertainties faced by us. Our operations or actual results could also be similarly impacted by additional risks and uncertainties that are not currently known to us, that we currently deem to be immaterial, that arise in the future or that are not specific to us, such as general economic conditions.\n\nRisks Affecting Our Business\n\nWe may not be able to compete successfully against current or future competitors.\n\nEach of our offerings to our residential and business customers face increasingly intense competition from a variety of sources under evolving market conditions. We expect these trends will continue. In addition to competition from larger national telecommunications providers, we are facing increasing competition from several other sources, including cable and satellite companies, wireless providers, technology companies, broadband providers, device providers, resellers, sales agents and facilities-based providers using their own networks as well as those leasing parts of our network. In particular, (i) intense competition from wireless and other communications providers has led to a long-term systemic decline in the number of our customers for wireline voice services, (ii) strong competition from cable companies and others has limited the growth of our broadband operations and (iii) aggressive competition from a wide range of technology companies and other market entrants has limited the prospects for our cloud computing operations. For more detailed information, see \"Competition\" under Item 1 of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015.\n\nSome of our current and potential competitors (i) offer products or services that are substitutes for our wireline voice services, including wireless voice and non-voice communication services, (ii) offer a more comprehensive range of communications products and services, (iii) offer products or services with features that we cannot readily match in some or all of our markets, including faster average broadband transmission speeds and greater content, (iv) have market presence, engineering and technical capabilities, and financial and other resources greater than ours, (v) have larger or more diverse networks with greater transmission capacity or other advantages, (vi) conduct operations or raise capital at a lower cost than us, (vii) are subject to less regulation, which we believe enables such competitors to operate more flexibly than us with respect to certain offerings, (viii) offer services nationally or internationally to a larger geographic area or larger base of customers, (ix) have substantially stronger brand names, which may provide them with greater pricing power than ours, or (x) have larger operations than ours, which may enable them to offer higher compensation packages in connection with recruiting and retaining top technological, managerial and operational talent. Consequently, these competitors may be better equipped to provide more attractive offerings, to charge lower prices for their products and services, to develop and expand their communications and network infrastructure more quickly, to adapt more swiftly to new or emerging technologies and changes in customer requirements, to devote greater resources to the marketing and sale of their products and services, to provide more comprehensive customer service, to provide greater resources to research and development initiatives and to take advantage of acquisition or other opportunities more readily. In the past, several of our competitors and their operations have grown through acquisitions and aggressive product development. The continued growth of our competitors could further enhance their competitive positions.\n\nCompetition could adversely impact us in several ways, including (i) the loss of customers and market share, (ii) the possibility of customers reducing their usage of our services or shifting to less profitable services, (iii) reduced traffic on our networks, (iv) our need to expend substantial time or money on new capital improvement projects, (v) our need to lower prices or increase marketing expenses to remain competitive and (vi) our inability to diversify by successfully offering new products or services.\n\nWe are continually taking steps to respond to these competitive pressures, but these efforts may not be successful. Our operating results and financial condition would be adversely affected if these initiatives are unsuccessful or insufficient and if we otherwise are unable to sufficiently stem our continuing access line losses and our legacy revenue declines. If this occurred, our ability to pay our debt and other obligations and to re-invest in the business would also be adversely affected.\n\n25\n\nRapid technological changes could significantly impact our competitive and financial position.\n\nThe communications industry has been and continues to be impacted by significant technological changes, which in general are enhancing non-voice communications and enabling a broader array of companies to offer services competitive with ours. Many of those technological changes are (i) displacing or reducing demand for our wireline voice services, (ii) enabling the development of competitive products or services, or (iii) enabling our current customers to reduce or bypass use of our networks. Rapid changes in technology are increasing the competitiveness of the information technology services industry. In addition, demand for our broadband services has been constrained by certain technologies permitting cable companies and other competitors to deliver faster average broadband transmission speeds than ours. Demand for our broadband services could be further reduced by advanced wireless data transmission technologies being deployed by wireless providers, including \"long-term evolution\" or \"LTE\" technologies, especially if these wireless providers continue to increase their broadband transmission speed and decrease their service rates. To enhance the competitiveness of our broadband services, we may be required to expend additional capital to augment the capabilities of our copper-based services or to install more fiber optic cable.\n\nWe may not be able to accurately predict or respond to changes in technology or industry standards, or to the introduction of newly-offered services. Any of these developments could make some or all of our offerings less desirable or even obsolete. These developments could also require us to (i) expend capital or other resources in excess of currently contemplated levels, (ii) forego the development or provision of products or services that others can provide more efficiently, or (iii) make other changes to our operating plans, corporate strategies or capital allocation plans, any of which could be contrary to the expectations of our security holders or could adversely impact our operations. If we are not able to develop new products and services to keep pace with technological advances, or if those products and services are not widely accepted by customers, our ability to compete could be adversely affected and our market share could decline. Any inability to effectively respond to technological changes could also adversely affect our operating results and financial condition, as well as our ability to service debt and fund other commitments or initiatives.\n\nEven if we succeed in adapting to changes in technology or industry standards by developing new products or services, there is no assurance that the new products or services would have a positive impact on our profit margins or financial performance.\n\nIn addition to introducing new technologies and offerings, we may need, from time to time, to phase out outdated and unprofitable technologies and services. If we are unable to do so, on a cost-effective basis, we could experience reduced profits.\n\nFor additional information on the risks of increased expenditures, see \"Risk Factors—Risks Affecting our Liquidity and Capital Resources—Our business requires us to incur substantial capital and operating expenses, which reduces our available free cash flow.\"\n\nOur legacy and private line services continue to experience declining revenues, and our efforts to offset these declines may not be successful.\n\nPrimarily as a result of the competitive and technological changes discussed above, we have experienced a prolonged systemic decline in our access lines and network access revenues, which continue to decrease revenues generated from our legacy services. We have also experienced a decline in our private line revenues due to our customers' optimization of their networks, industry consolidation, price compression and technological migration to higher-speed services. The loss of private line services has placed downward pressure on our strategic revenues.\n\nWe have taken a variety of steps to counter these declines, including:\n\n•\n\nan increased focus on selling a broader range of higher-growth strategic services, which are described in detail elsewhere in this report;\n\n•\n\nan increased focus on serving a broader range of business, governmental and wholesale customers; and\n\n•\n\ngreater use of service bundles.\n\nHowever, for the reasons described elsewhere in this report, most of these strategic services generate lower profit margins than our legacy and private line services, and some can be expected to experience slowing growth as increasing numbers of our existing or potential customers subscribe to these newer products. Moreover, we cannot assure you that the revenues generated from our new offerings will offset revenue losses associated with our legacy and private line services. In addition, our reliance on third parties to provide certain of these strategic services could constrain our flexibility, as described further below.\n\n26\n\nOur ability to successfully introduce new product or service offerings on a timely and cost-effective basis could be constrained by a range of factors, including network limitations, limited capital, an inability to attract key personnel with the necessary skills, intellectual property constraints, testing delays, or an inability to act as quickly as smaller, more nimble start-up competitors. Similarly, our ability to grow through acquisitions could be limited by several factors, including our leverage and inability to identify attractively-priced target companies. For these reasons, we cannot assure you that our new product or service offerings will be as successful as anticipated, or that we will be able to continue to grow through acquisitions.\n\nWe may not be able to successfully adjust to changes in our industry, our markets and our product mix.\n\nOngoing changes in the communications industry have fundamentally changed consumers’ communications expectations and requirements. In response to these changes, we have substantially altered our product and service offerings through acquisitions and internal product development. Many of these changes have placed a higher premium on sales, marketing and product development functions, and necessitated ongoing changes in our processes and operating protocols, as well as periodic reorganizations of our sales and leadership teams. In addition, we now offer a more complex range of products and services, operate larger and more complex networks and serve a much larger and more diverse set of customers. Consequently, we now face greater challenges in effectively managing and administering our operations and allocating capital and other resources to our various offerings. For all these reasons, we cannot assure you that our efforts to adjust to these changes will be timely or successful.\n\nWe could be harmed by security breaches, damages or other significant disruptions or failures of our networks, information technology infrastructure or related systems, or of those we operate for certain of our customers.\n\nWe are materially reliant upon our networks, information technology infrastructure and related technology systems (including our billing systems) to provide products and services to our customers and to manage our operations and affairs. We face the risk, as does any company, of a security breach or significant disruption of our information technology infrastructure and related systems. As a communications company that transmits large amounts of sensitive and proprietary information over communications networks, we face an added risk that a security breach or other significant disruption of our public networks or information technology infrastructure and related systems that we develop, install, operate and maintain for certain of our business customers (which includes our wholesale and governmental customers) could lead to material interruptions or curtailments of service. Moreover, in connection with processing and storing confidential customer data, we face a heightened risk that a security breach or disruption could result in unauthorized access to our customers' proprietary information on our public networks or internal systems or the systems that we operate and maintain for certain of our customers.\n\nWe make significant efforts to maintain the security and integrity of information and systems under our control, and maintain contingency plans in the event of security breaches or other system disruptions. Nonetheless, we cannot assure you that our security efforts and measures will prevent unauthorized access to our systems, loss or destruction of data (including confidential customer information), account takeovers, unavailability of service, computer viruses, malware, distributed denial-of-service attacks, or other forms of cyber-attacks or similar events. These threats may derive from human error, hardware or software vulnerabilities, fraud, malice or sabotage on the part of employees, third parties or other nations, or could result from aging equipment or other accidental technological failure. These threats may also arise from failure or breaches of systems owned, operated or controlled by other unaffiliated operators to the extent we rely on such other operations to deliver services to our customers.\n\nSimilar to other large telecommunications companies, we are a constant target of cyber-attacks of varying degrees. Although some of these attacks have resulted in security breaches, to date none of these breaches have resulted in a material adverse effect on our operating results or financial condition. You should be aware, however, that defenses against cyber-attacks currently available to U.S. companies are unlikely to prevent intrusions by a highly-determined, highly-sophisticated hacker. Consequently, you should assume that we will be unable to implement security barriers or other preventative measures that repel all future cyber-attacks. Any such future security breaches or disruptions could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations or financial condition, especially in light of the growing frequency, scope and well-documented sophistication of cyber-attacks and intrusions.\n\nAlthough CenturyLink maintains insurance coverage that may, subject to policy terms and conditions (including self-insured deductibles, coverage restrictions and monetary coverage caps), cover certain aspects of our cyber risks, such insurance coverage may be unavailable or insufficient to cover our losses.\n\nAdditional risks to our network, infrastructure and related systems include:\n\n•\n\npower losses or physical damage, whether caused by fire, adverse weather conditions, terrorism, sabotage, vandalism or otherwise;\n\n27\n\n•\n\ncapacity or system configuration limitations, including those resulting from changes in our customer's usage patterns, the introduction of new technologies or products, or incompatibilities between our newer and older systems;\n\n•\n\ntheft or failure of our equipment;\n\n•\n\nsoftware or hardware obsolescence, defects or malfunctions;\n\n•\n\ndeficiencies in our processes or controls;\n\n•\n\nprogramming, processing and other human error; and\n\n•\n\nservice failures of our third-party vendors and other disruptions that are beyond our control.\n\nDue to these factors, we experience from time to time in the ordinary course of our business short disruptions in our service, and could experience more significant disruptions in the future.\n\nDisruptions, security breaches and other significant failures of the above-described networks and systems could:\n\n•\n\ndisrupt the proper functioning of these networks and systems, which could in turn disrupt (i) our operations or (ii) the operations of certain of our customers who rely upon us to provide services critical to their operations;\n\n•\n\nrequire significant management attention or financial resources to remedy the damages that result or to change our systems, including expenses to repair systems, add new personnel or develop additional protective systems;\n\n•\n\nresult in the unauthorized access to, and destruction, loss, theft, misappropriation or release of proprietary, confidential, sensitive, classified or otherwise valuable information of ours, our customers or our customers' end users, including trade secrets, which others could use for competitive, disruptive, destructive or otherwise harmful purposes and outcomes;\n\n•\n\nrequire us to notify customers, regulatory agencies or the public of data breaches;\n\n•\n\nrequire us to provide credits for future service under certain service level commitments we have provided contractually to our customers or to offer expensive incentives to retain customers;\n\n•\n\nsubject us to claims for damages, fines, penalties, termination or other remedies under our customer contracts or service standards set by state regulatory commissions, which in certain cases could exceed our insurance coverage; or\n\n•\n\nresult in a loss of business, damage our reputation among our customers and the public generally, subject us to additional regulatory scrutiny or expose us to prolonged litigation.\n\nWe could experience difficulties in expanding and updating our technical infrastructure.\n\nOur ability to expand and update our systems and information technology infrastructure in response to our growth and changing business needs is important to our ability to maintain and develop attractive product and service offerings. As discussed further under “Business—Network Architecture” in Item 1 of Part I of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015, we are currently undertaking several complex, costly and time-consuming projects to simplify and modernize our network, which combines our legacy network and CenturyLink's networks. Unanticipated delays in the completion of these projects may lead to increased project costs or operational inefficiencies. In addition, there may be issues related to our expanded or updated infrastructure that are not identified by our testing processes, and which may only become evident after we have started to fully utilize the redesigned systems. Our failure to modernize and upgrade our technology infrastructure could have adverse consequences, including the delayed implementation of new service offerings, decreased competitiveness of existing service offerings, network instabilities, increased operating or acquisition integration costs, service or billing interruptions, and the diversion of development resources.\n\nAny or all of the foregoing developments could have a negative impact on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\n\n28\n\nIf we fail to hire and retain qualified executives, managers and employees, our operating results could be harmed.\n\nOur future success depends on our ability to identify, hire, train and retain executives, managers and employees with technological, engineering, product development, operational, provisioning, marketing, sales, administrative and managerial skills. There is a shortage of qualified personnel in several of these fields nationally and in our headquarters city of Monroe, Louisiana, in particular. We compete with several other companies for this limited pool of potential employees. As our industry increasingly becomes more competitive, it could become especially difficult to attract and retain top personnel with skills in high demand. In addition, subject to limited exceptions, none of our executives or domestic employees have long-term employment agreements. For all these reasons, there is no assurance that our efforts to recruit and retain qualified personnel will be succes"
