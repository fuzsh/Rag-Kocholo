Windows Live Search is Microsoft's Web search engine. It gives users the tools to search through Web sites, images, videos, news, and a number of other categories. Microsoft has built-in some interesting search technologies with Live Search. One of them is the Scratchpad, which lets users save an assortment of pictures they like from the image search results. It uses a drag-and-drop interface that's really simple to pick up.

Search enthusiasts won't be let down by Microsoft's offering. Its advanced options are pretty powerful, giving users a choice of search localization by country and sliders to adjust which results come to the top based either on popularity or on how recently the sites were updated.
