        "text": "Site search lets you add search to your site so your visitors can find the information theyâre looking for. If needed, you can exclude the content of specific elements, pages, and even entire Collections, all with a tick of a checkbox. Site search is available on all sites with CMS Site plans or above.\n\nImportant: Site search does not crawl or index search terms within custom code snippets, or return results related to search terms within custom code snippets. Additionally, site search does not index content that is only accessible with a User Account. Â If you need custom code content to be indexed, please use a third-party search tool.\n\nNote: Site search displays results from the currently selected locale. If a site visitor searches for content on your site from a locale where that content doesnât exist, site search returns a âNo matching resultsâ message.â\n\nSite search element\n\nYou can add the site search element from the Add panel. The search element includes:\n\nSearch (wrapper) â the parent element that contains the search form and submit button\n\nSearch input â where site visitors type their search\n\nSubmit button â a button to submit the search, which you can hide if youâd like an âEnterâ key press to submit the search\n\nOnce you add site search to your site, you can style it the same way you style any other element. You can also customize the placeholder text and set the search bar to autofocus, which automatically places visitorsâ cursors in the search field on page load.\n\nSearch results page\n\nOnce you add site search to your site, youâll see the Search results page appear in Pages panel > Utility pages.\n\nThe Search results page contains an initial structure including a container element and a search element, along with a list of results, which you can style like a Collection list.\n\nNeed to know: Sites without a Site plan or a Basic Site plan will show sample search results on your published site â which you can show to clients to give them a sense of how their search experience will look. To see real search results, youâll need to add a CMS Site plan or higher to your site.\n\nSearch results structure\n\nSearch results have a preliminary structure including:\n\nSearch title (link) â the title for that page, pulled from whatever youâve set as the Search result title in the Search section of that pageâs Page settings. This title acts as a link to that page by default. For Collection pages, this content can be pulled from any field. You can also pull in content from the SEO description and the Open Graph image.\n\nPage URL (text block) â the page slug\n\nSnippet (paragraph) â the context from the page where the searched term appears. You can choose to connect this paragraph to a custom description, which you can set in that pageâs Page settings. You can also set the snippet length (number of characters) and turn on highlighting (which bolds appearances of the search term within the snippet) by going to the Search Result wrapper element settings.\n\nEmpty state\n\nYour Search Results page has a âno resultsâ state for when users search for something that isnât available on your site. To customize the design of the âno resultsâ state, toggle No results âonâ in your Search Results wrapper element settings.\n\nSetting result count\n\nYou can choose how many results youâd like to display on your search results by going to Search Results wrapper element settings > Results length. You can choose up to 60 search results to display.\n\nNote: Support for pagination across multiple search results pages is not yet available.\n\nPreviewing search results\n\nAs you style your search results, you can adjust the displayed results by changing the search term in Search Result wrapper element settings > Preview results. Then you can view how your search results appear for different queries. Note that until you add a CMS or Business Site plan and publish your site, youâll receive sample results â not real results from your site. To preview and style real search results, publish your site to create a search index.\n\nAdditional site search settings\n\nYou can use the search description field in that pageâs Page settings to add additional information to your search results. For example, say you want to show visitors what type of content a specific search result is by displaying a blog post category alongside the result. Add your category name to the search description field, then connect a text field in your search results to the search description field.\n\nYou can also set a search image in a pageâs Page settings. Once youâve set a search image, you can add this image to your search results by connecting an image element to the search image field.\n\nIndexing\n\nAn index includes the content and pages in your site search engine. This controls what content people can search through when they submit a search on your site. If you donât want a specific page to be discoverable through search, you can remove it from your index.\n\nSites are limited to one site search engine. You can have a search bar on as many pages as youâd like, but theyâll all search across the same content.\n\nHow to create an index\n\nOnce you've added a CMS Site plan or higher, your search index is created after you publish your site for the first time.\n\nHow to update your index\n\nThere are two ways to update your index so the content in search results matches the latest updates to your site content:\n\nManual reindexing\n\nAutomatic reindexing\n\nManual reindexing\n\nManual reindexing lets you deliberately refresh the content in your search engine. This is best for when youâve pushed important updates to your content, or made extensive changes to the content of your search engine. On the CMS Site plan, manual reindexing is available once every 24 hours. On the Business Site plan, manual reindexing is available every 12 hours.\n\nTo manually reindex your site, first publish your site. Then, go to Settings panel > Search and click Index now. Indexing can take up to 24 hours on large sites. To check on the status of your index, go to Settings panel > Search.\n\nIf you make a major content change and need your site reindexed immediately, please contact Support, who can reindex for you as a one-time courtesy.\n\nAutomatic reindexing\n\nOn an ongoing basis, weâll update your search index to keep the content in your search engine up to date with the latest changes to your site. On the CMS Site plan, automatic reindexing takes place 72 hours after full-site publish. On the Business Site plan automatic reindexing takes place 12 hours after full-site publish. Single item publishing CMS items does not trigger automatic reindexing â a full-site publish is required.\n\nRefining your search index\n\nBy default, everything on your site (excluding components, Collection lists, utility pages, and password-protected content) is indexed when you add site search, so visitors can discover this content when they search your site. In most cases, youâll want to refine your index to exercise more control over what visitors can discover through search.\n\nNote: Excluding content from site search does not affect how Google and other search engines index your site. Learn more about disabling indexing of site pages.\n\nExcluding static pages\n\nTo exclude a static page from search, go to Page settings > Site search settings and check âExclude this page from site search results.â Once checked, a reindex will remove this page from your index.\n\nExcluding Collection pages\n\nTo exclude a Collection pages from search, go to Page settings > Site search settings, check âExclude this page from site search results,â and Save your changes. Then, a reindex will remove this page from your index.\n\nExcluding a Collection page excludes all template pages from search results, but any appearances of this Collectionâs content in Collection lists on other pages will still be discoverable, as theyâll be indexed from that pageâs content. In this case, you may want to apply element-level exclusion for those Collection lists.\n\nNote: It's not possible to exclude individual Collection items from search.\n\nExcluding elements\n\nItâs a good idea to exclude recurring elements (such as navbars, footers, and forms) from search because they appear across your site and can âmuddy upâ your search results. (For example, if a person searches for âBlog postsâ but the word âBlog postsâ is in your navigation, every page on your site would be considered relevant for that search.)\n\nFor this reason, components and Collection lists are excluded from search results by default. You can override this setting on the main component if needed.\n\nTo exclude specific elements, go to the Elementâs settings > Search index settings and check âExclude content from site search results.â\n\nAny exclusion rules set on a parent element also apply to children elements.\n\nFrequently asked questions\n\nWhat happens with search if I export my code?\n\nSite search does not work on exported sites.\n\nHow can I see what users are searching for?"
