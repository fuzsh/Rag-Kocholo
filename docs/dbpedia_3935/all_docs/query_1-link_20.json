        "text": "Search Engines are now part of our daily life and one of the most important tools for billions of internet users worldwide.\n\nSearch Engine\n\nA web search engine or Internet search engine is a tool in the form of software to collect particular data through a web search. In other words, a search engine helps the user search the World Wide Web to receive his/her required data in a systematic way.\n\nThe role of internet search engines has become more and more important due to the specialization of things in our daily life and the almost daily need to use the Internet as an important source of information.\n\nSearch Engines are now part of our daily life and one of the most important tools for billions of internet users worldwide. From searching for the best pizza shop in the town to the development of blockchain technology, people are now becoming more and more dependent on search engines to get the answer for their everyday queries.\n\nThe first search engine known throughout history is Archie! It appeared in 1989 and was invented by Alan Emtage, a student studying computer sciences at McGill University. It is considered as the original search engine and the turning point in the creation of today’s giant alternatives Yahoo and Google.\n\nTop 5 Search Engines\n\nAccording to statistics from Netmarketshare, Statista and StatCounter, the top 5 search engines worldwide in terms of market share are Google, Bing, Yahoo, Baidu, and Yandex.\n\nGoogle was not the first search engine to be created in history, but with a 78.23% worldwide market share in 2019, it has a dominant lead over its rival search engines.\n\nGoogle is a dominant force in search and one of the most popular search engines worldwide; it is the king and will be for the foreseeable future, over other search engines due to its powerful algorithms, easy-to-use interface, leading marketing and advertising platform, and personalized user experience\n\nAccording to StatCounter, Google possesses an 88.37 percent share of the United States’ search market in 2019.\n\nThe rest of the US market share (11.63) is divided between Bing, with 6.07%, Yahoo, with 3.94% and DuckDuckGo, with 1.28%.\n\nWe live in a big world, where it is developing second by second, giving rise to various needs and leading to changing tastes. To overcome the gaps and be in tune with the developing nature of our world, smart minds have come up with innovative ideas, in the form of new search engines to fill the gap in different regions and purposes.\n\nHere are 4 search alternatives to Google:\n\nBing\n\nHaving a 6.07% market share in the United States, Bing is the second largest search engine in the world, after Google, having origins in Microsoft’s previous search engines: MSN Search, Windows Live Search and later Live Search.\n\nOwned and operated by Microsoft to challenge Google in 2009, Bing is the default search engine on Windows PCs, however, its operators could have not convinced users yet that the Bing search engine can be a reliable alternative to Google.\n\nBing has done a lot of advertising campaigns to compete with Google, including adding new features to its own advertising, “Bing Ads”, (changing AdWords entry to related keywords), improving reporting to maintain systems’ standards and get help from some of the managers who have information about AdWords.\n\nYahoo!\n\nYahoo! Search is a web search engine owned by Yahoo, in California. It is one of the most popular email providers and its web search engine is the third largest search engine in the world, having between 1.64% and 2.04% market share.\n\nYahoo! Directory was created in April 1994 by David Filo and Jerry Yang of Stanford University. Now, Yahoo! is considered an internet portal, rather than a search engine, and according to Alexa ranks as the 11 most visited website on the Internet.\n\nFrom October 2011 to October 2015, Yahoo! search signed a deal with Bing for a 4our-year period, in which Yahoo’s internet search is powered exclusively by Bing.\n\nAs of October 2015 until October 2018, Yahoo! added Google to its service-providing partners, along with Bing. But ended the deal, 1 year later, being once again powered exclusively by Bing.\n\nAs of 2014, Yahoo! search engine is the default search engine for Firefox browsers in the US.\n\nBaidu\n\nHaving a global market share between 0.92% and 9.37% and 70% of the Chinese search market, Baidu was founded in 2000 by Robin Li and Eric Xu, and is the most popular search engine in China.\n\nNow ranked 4th in global internet engagement, Baidu is only available in the Chinese language.\n\nYandex\n\nFounded in 1997 by Arkady Voluzh, Arkady Borkovsky, and Ilya Segalovich, Russian’s most popular search engine Yandex has a global market share between 0.47% and 0.83%.\n\nAccording to Alexa, Yandex is among the 30 most popular websites on the Internet with a ranking position of 4 in Russian.\n\nIt is a technology company that builds intelligent products and services powered by machine learning.\n\nYandex holds about 65% market share in Russia, and digs deeper into localized search results to provide more than 1,400 cities, and is the single most visited page on the Russian language."
