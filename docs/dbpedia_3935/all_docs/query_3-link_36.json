When you select the link below, you will be taken to a live database search page where you can verify a certification/license. When you are finished searching, please use the back button of your browser to return to this website.\n\nAccess the live online Certification/Licensee Search\n\nNote: Select the link, \"License Search\", on the top right side. You do not need to register, or enter an ID or password.\n\nThings to remember:\n\nAn individual must have a \"Current, Active\" status to be eligible to work on an ambulance.\n\nIf an EMS provider does business under a different name you can search under \"Doing Business As\" (DBAs). Simply enter the letters DBA and the first letter of the provider name in the search field.\n\nYou will not be able to check your application status. The database provides your certification status only ( i.e. \"Certified\" if you pass the exam AND all requirements have been met).\n\nRosters are no longer available. Please use the live online search above."
