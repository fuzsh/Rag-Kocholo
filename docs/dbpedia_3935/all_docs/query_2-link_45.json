HANSA MEHTA LIBRARY THE MAHARAJA SAYAJIRAO UNIVERSITY OF BARODA VADODARA-390 001 E-MAIL : LIBRARIAN-HML@MSUBARODA.AC.IN DATE : 4TH AUGUST, 2021 1\n\n2. DICTIONARY DEFINITIONS search COMPUTING (transitive verb) to examine a computer file, disk, database, or network for particular information engine something that supplies the driving force or energy to a movement, system, or trend search engine a computer program that searches for particular keywords and returns a list of documents in which they were found, especially a commercial service that scans documents on the Internet 2\n\n3. WHAT IS SEARCH ENGINE  A search engine is a software system that is designed to carry out web searches.  They search the World Wide Web in a systematic way for particular information specified in a textual web search query.  The search results are generally presented in a line of results, often referred to as search engine results pages (SERPs)  The information may be a mix of links to web pages, images, videos, infographics, articles, research papers, and other types of files. 3\n\n4. WHAT IS SEARCH ENGINE  Intelligent applications known as spiders, robots, or bots that crawl over the World Wide Web following links from website to website.  The data compiled from the web by robots is utilized to generate a retrievable index of a Website.  Displays results according to the order of the significant keyword.  The display of results differs from search engine to search engine.  It uses the keywords to search for documents that relate to these key words and then puts the result in order of relevance to the topic that was searched for.  Search engines are important because with over 8 billion web pages available, it would be impossible to search for the information that is specifically needed.  This is why search engines are used to filter the information that is on the internet and transform it into results that each individual can easily access and use within the matter of seconds 4\n\n5. WHAT ARE THEY?  Four Components  A database of references to webpages  An indexing robot that crawls the WWW  An interface  Enables users to submit queries  Displays results  Information retrieval system  Each is unique, but are mostly the same 5\n\n6. FUNCTIONING  Designed to help people find information stored on other sites.  Select pieces from the Internet based on important keywords.  Keep an index of the words they find and where they find them.  They allow users to look for words or combinations of words found in that index.  Search engine operates, in the following order :  Crawling : Follow links to find information  Indexing : Record what words appear where  Ranking : What information is a good match to a user query? What information is inherently good?  Displaying : Find a good format for the information  Serving : Handle queries, find pages, display results 6\n\n7. FUNCTIONING..  1. Spiders: To find information on the hundreds of millions of Web pages that exist, a search engine employs special software robots, called spiders, to build lists of the words found on Web sites.\"Spiders\" take a Web page's content and create key search words that enable online users to find pages they're looking for.  2. Crawling: When a spider is building its lists, the process is called Web. In order to build and maintain a useful list of words, a search engine's spiders have to look at a lot of pages.  1. Indexing: For fast accessing of data.  2. Meta tag: The contents of each page are then analyzed to determine how it should be indexed (for example, words are extracted from the titles, headings, or special fields).  Keyword Density: The ratio of the number of occurrences of a word or phrase on a page to the total number of words on the page. 7\n\n8. ORIGIN  The first internet search engines predate the debut of the Web in December 1990: Knowbot Information Service multi-network user search was first implemented in 1989.  The first well documented search engine that searched content files, namely FTP files, was Archie, which debuted on 10 September 1990 8\n\n9. INFORMATION RETRIEVAL  Search Engine is in the field of IR  Searching authors, titles and subjects in library card catalogs or computers  Document classification and categorization, user interfaces, data visualization, filtering Should easily retrieve interested information  IR can be inaccurate as long as the error is insignificant  Data is usually natural language text, which is not always well structured and could be semantically ambiguous  Goal: To retrieve all the documents which are relevant to a query while retrieving as few non- relevant documents as possible 9\n\n10. IMPORTANCE  Visibility and Rankings When searching for a service or product online, users are more likely to choose one of the top five suggestions that the search engine shows them.  Web Traffic SEO increases your organic search engine traffic, in turn increasing the number of visitors your page sees each day.  Trustworthy The better your SEO score is, the higher you’ll appear on search engines like Google and Bing. While ranking higher on Google is appealing to all brands because on increased visibility, a secondhand benefit is the trust you gain with potential customers.  User Experience A well-optimized website clearly communicates what product or service is being offered, how to obtain it and answers any questions surrounding it. By catering the site build to the user’s experience, search engines like Google and Bing are able to easily pull the information they need to then relay to users.  Growth SEO is key to the growth of your brand. The higher you rank on a search engine for a variety of high-volume keywords, the more organic (aka non-paid) web traffic your site will receive  A website that is well-optimized is more likely to gain more customers and make more sales. 10\n\n11. USEFULNESSS  Search engines essentially act as filters for the wealth of information available on the internet.  Allow users to quickly and easily find information  Provide users with search results that lead to relevant information on high-quality websites.  Search engines use complex algorithms to assess websites and web pages and assign them a ranking for relevant search phrases.  Shopping, Research, Entertainment  In addition to searching text, search engines will also let you search for graphics, sounds and other kinds of files.  Search engines also provide search access to databases of third parties which allow you to search through corporate reports, telephone listings, yellow pages, zip codes and numerous other information databases.  Search engines can also perform some calculations.  You can also use search engines for conversions, like converting Celsius to Fahrenhit.  If you use convert and then the units you want to convert, Google returns the answers. Examples include \"covert 15 liters to gallons\" or \"convert 3pm cst to est.\" 11\n\n12. TYPES OF SEARCH ENGINES  CRAWLER BASED  DIRECTORIES  HYBRID SEARCH ENGINES  META SEARCH ENGINES 12\n\n13. CRAWLER BASED  These types of search engines use a \"spider\" or a \"crawler\" to search the Internet.  The crawler digs through individual web pages, pulls out keywords and then adds the pages to the search engine's database.  Crawler-based search engines are good when you have a specific search topic.  Google and Yahoo are examples of crawler search engines. 13\n\n14. DIRECTORIES  Directories depend on human editors to create their listings or the database. Yahoo Directory, Open Directory and Look Smart are few examples.  Human-powered directories are good when you are interested in a general topic of search 14\n\n15. HYBRID SEARCH ENGINES  Hybrid search engines are search engines that use both crawler based searches and directory searches to obtain their results .  Example:- Yahoo.com- Google.com 15\n\n16. META SEARCH ENGINES  These transmit user-supplied keywords simultaneously to several individual search engines to actually carry out the search.  Search results returned from all the search engines can be integrated, duplicates can be eliminated and additional features such as clustering by subjects within the search results can be implemented by meta-search engines.  meta engines search multiple engines  getting combined results from a variety of engines  do not have their own databases  but have their own business models affecting results  a number of techniques used  interesting ones: clustering, statistical analyses 16\n\n17. SAMPLE OF META ENGINES Dogpile results from a number of leading search engines; gives source, so overlap can be compared Surfwax gives statistics and text sources & linking to sources Teoma results with suggestions for narrowing; links resources derived; originated at Rutgers Turbo10 provides results in clusters; engines searched can be edited  Large directory  Complete Planet  directory of over 70,000 databases & specialty engines  Results with graphical displays  Vivisimo  clusters results; innovative  Webbrain  results in tree structure – fun to use Kartoo results in display by topics of query 17\n\n18. DATABASE  Where user's query is matched  Contains only essential parts of pages  Only includes pages that were indexed  Search engines are always out of date 18\n\n19. WEB CRAWLER  A robot that follows links  Records data it finds  Words in the webpage  Metadata  ALT attributes in IMG tags Robot Exclusion Protocol 19\n\n20. SEARCH ENGINE INTERFACES  Gathers input from users  Presents results from the IR system  Often in ranked order  Input  User requirements  Search expression, search limits  Presentation style  Presentation format , search type  Output  Results  Descriptions  Clusters 20\n\n21. SEARCH TERM MATCHING  Trying to find a match in the database  Two main methods  Keyword searching  Matching single terms, computing cosine  Concept-based searching  Examining clusters of words  Attempt to determine meaning of query and find records related to that meaning 21\n\n22. HOW IT WORKS?  crawlers, spiders: go out to find content  in various ways go through the web looking for new & changed sites  periodic, not for each query  no search engine works in real time  some search engines do it for themselves, others not  buy content from companies such as Inktomi  for a number of reasons crawlers do not cover all of the web – just a fraction  what is not covered is “invisible web”  organizing content: labeling, arranging  indexing for searching – automatic  keywords and other fields  arranging by URL popularity - PageRank as Google  classifying as directory  mostly human handpicked & classified  as a result of different organization we have basically two kinds of search engines:  search – input is a query that is then searched & displayed  directory – classified content – a class is displayed  and fused: directories have now also search capabilities & vice versa 22\n\n23. ELABORATION (CONT.)  databases, caches: storing content  humongous files usually distributed over many computers  query processor: searching, retrieval, display  takes your query as input  engines have differing rules how handled  displays ranked output  some engines also cluster output and provide visualization  at the other end is your browser  all search engines have these basic parts in common  BUT the actual processes – methods how they do it – are based on various algorithms & they differ  most are proprietary with details kept mostly secret but based on well known principles from information retrieval or classification  to some extent Google is an exception – they published their method 23\n\n24. BASIC IR FEATURES  Boolean operators  AND, OR, NOT, grouping  Extended operators  NEAR, ADJACENT, (\")  Stop word deletion  Stemming  Searching in fields (e.g. host) 24\n\n25. WHAT ABOUT THE INVISIBLE WEB?  Also known as the Deep Web  Documents that are on the WWW but not indexed by Search Engines  Some are available only by submitting forms  Some are not generally accessible (in subnets)  Some are not in (X)HTML format  More search engines parse non-(X)HTML now than before  Because of awareness of the problem companies are making more content available using  Stable URLs  Robot-friendly sitemaps  But much content is still not indexed 25\n\n26. PLENTY OF IMPORTANT YET INVISIBLE DOCS  How to find them?  Many of them are in databases  No one search engine covers everything  Use database tools  Especially for research articles  Use multiple search engines or a meta- crawler  dogpile is the most famous 26\n\n27. RANKED OUTPUT  Most SEs produce ranked lists by applying simple rules:  Early words are more important  Title is very important  Frequency of occurrence matters for some  Infrequent words matter more  Modification date  Google is different:  PageRankTM method based on popularity  Links as money 27\n\n28. COVERAGE DIFFERENCES  No engine covers more than a fraction of WWW  estimates: none more than 16%  hard (even impossible) to discern & compare coverage, but they differ substantially in what they cover  in addition:  many national search engines  own coverage, orientation, governance  many specialized or domain search engines  own coverage geared to subject of interest  many comprehensive sources independent of search engines  some have compilations of evaluated web sources 28\n\n29. SEARCHING DIFFERENCES  Substantial differences among search engines on searching, retrieval display  need to know how they work & differ in respect to  defaults in searching a query  searching of phrases, case sensitivity, categories  searching of different fields, formats, types of resources  advance search capabilities and features  possibilities for refinement, using relevance feedback  display options  personalization options 29\n\n30. HOW TO SUCCEED WITH SES  As a surfer:  If you don't know what you are looking for  Use multiple SEs, or a meta-crawler  Search within results  Use Boolean expressions or search within results  Consider specialized engines  As a creator:  HTML level  Always use ALT attributes with <IMG>, etc.  Avoid frames  Make it easier to index  Don't expect SEs to find your pages  Make links between your pages  Use metadata  Informal: <meta name=\"description\" …>  Formal: Dublin core and others  Increase your pages popularity  Don’t use systematic reciprocal linking: rings, exchanges, lists  Page Rank™ is inversely proportional to out degree 30\n\n31. BASICS  Generally the more keywords you use in your search the more specific and accurate your results will be.  For example, a search for the Asiatic Lion, India, Geer, Junagadh, will produce better results if you search for the words “Asiatic Lion, India, Junagadh\" than if you search for just “Asiatic Lion\"  Some search engines will also perform this same function when you place a + sign in front the keywords such as +Student +Contests. 31\n\n32. HOW TO USE SE  “+” before a word in a search will locate for documents which definitely contain the word.  “-” before a word will exclude that word from search.  Placing words between quotation marks will “ ” search for phrase between the quotes.  Using “or” between search phrase will search or each term separately.  Examples :  +BLACK+BLUE: The search results will contain documents which contain the word black and the word blue.  BLACK-BLUE: Those documents will be returned which contain the word black but not the word blue.  “BLACK BLUE”: Those documents will be returned which include the phrase black blue. (placed together).  BLACK OR BLUE: Those documents will be returned which contain the term black or the term blue. 32\n\n33. HOW TO USE SE  Building a more complex query requires the use of Boolean operators that allow you to refine and extend the terms of the search. The Boolean operators most often seen are:  AND - All the terms joined by \"AND\" must appear in the pages or documents. Some search engines substitute the operator \"+\" for the word AND.  OR - At least one of the terms joined by \"OR\" must appear in the pages or documents.  NOT - The term or terms following \"NOT\" must not appear in the pages or documents. Some search engines substitute the operator \"-\" for the word NOT.  FOLLOWED BY - One of the terms must be directly followed by the other.  NEAR - One of the terms must be within a specified number of words of the other.  Specify the words clearly (+, -)  Use Advanced Search when necessary  Provide as many particular terms as possible  If looking for a company, institution, or organization, try: www.name [.com | .edu | .org | .gov | country code]  Some searching engine specialize in some areas  For broad queries, try to use Web directories as starting points  Anyone can publish data on the Web, so information that they get from search engines might not be accurate. 33\n\n34. TIPS FOR BETTER SEARCH(GOOGLE)  Get Specific With Quotes  Use the Minus Sign to Remove Words  Use the Asterisk as a Wildcard: The asterisk acts like a wildcard in a search. This is useful if do not know part of a phrase or you forget exactly how a word or name is spelled.  Search Within a Site: To search within a site just put site: in front of the domain followed by your keywords. For example, \"site:writerswrite.com harry potter\" will return to the Harry Potter coverage on our site.  Calculations: Google also has a built-in calculator. You can enter a math equation like 15+25 or 18*2343 or 553/17 and Google will return the answer within a calculator that appears in your results. It will also convert units and even graph equations.  Definitions: Google also returns definitions. Use define: followed by the word you want defined. For example, \"define:perquisition\" will provide the definition for perquisition. You can also include wildcards. For example: define:onomato* will return the definition for onomatopoeia.  Related Sites: Google will also provide you with sites that are related to other sites. If you use \"related:google.com\" it returns Yahoo, Bing, DuckDuckGo and other search tools.  Search Recently Updated Webpages: If you want to narrow your search results to recent information you can use the news search tab or you can click the tools tab. You will see that the default search in tools is \"any time.\" This can be narrowed to past hour, past 24 hours, past week, past month, past year or a custom range.  Google Alerts: Use Google Alerts to stay up-to-date on your research topics. You can configure keyword searches that you want to get updates on when there is new content available. You can get updates by email or as RSS feeds.  Random Facts with Google: Google will return a trivia question and answer if you use this keyword. 34\n\n35. GOOGLE  Initially known as BackRub, Google began as a research project of Larry Page, who enrolled in Stanford’s computer science graduate program in 1995. There, he met fellow CS student Sergey Brin.
