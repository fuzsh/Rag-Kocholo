        "text": "Hm - frankly speaking.. yes. Many users already mentioned that the new panel search got worse:\n\nthe differenciation of the types is not that clear anymore, respectively the hitlist is a mix up of all types\n\nhitting ENTER doesn't direct you to the advanced search (this was sold as a feature - for us it's a bug :-) )\n\n\"advanced search\" is far too little and not intuitive that THIS text link forwards you to the \"old\" search\n\nSo - from our perspective the usability got worse. Furthermore the users expects that the search will finde parts of the words like *word* - I agree with Ddavin Studer.\n\nI would get that if the Search box wasn't \"live\"\n\nBut in a Live search box, just assume that I want \"*<searchstring>*\" all the time\n\nIt shouldn't throw out things I search with.\n\nIf It gets hits with sslvpn-lax10 it should show them, if it in addition to that also showed hits for sslvpn and lax10 that might be OK.\n\nI think it is a bit of six of one half a dozen of the other. For instance if you assume wildcards all the time then anytime you want exact terms you would have to quote every term like such.\n\n\"foo\" \"bar\" \"baz\"\n\nConfluence uses a product called Lucene for the search aspect and that is how Lucene works. The search engine isn't actually developed by Atlassian.\n\nHave you tried quoting your search? That is an exact term search meaning it will only pull back pages where the terms in the quotes are exactly matched in the page. If you leave the quotes off Confluence is trowing out the \"-\" and seeing two search terms sslvpn and lax10 and it is doing an implied OR between the term. The below search (with the quotes) should only pull back pages with sslvpn-lax10 in them. I tested this on my system by creating three pages. One had sslvpn-lax10, one had sslvpn, and one had lax10. When I searched for sslvpn-lax10 without the quotes I saw all three pages in the results. When I search using quotes I only saw the one page.\n\n\"sslvpn-lax10\""
