This policy is intended to provide guidance for the creation of a library collection that provides access to library materials in appropriate formats that are of sufficient quality, depth, number, scope, and currency to:\n\nmeet all students’ needs in fulfilling course assignments;\n\nenrich the academic programs;\n\nmeet teaching and research needs;\n\nsupport curricular needs;\n\nfacilitate the acquisition of lifelong learning skills;\n\naccommodate other informational needs of the community as appropriate.\n\nMATERIAL SPECIFIC POLICY\n\nPhysical Content Versus Electronic Access\n\nIn regard to materials available both as physical content and via electronic access, this issue shall be considered.\n\nAccess Versus Ownership\n\nIn regard to electronic materials for content that is available for acquisition on a permanent basis, i.e., owned, this issue shall be considered.\n\nReplacements\n\nDecisions about replacements are made on a case-by-case basis.\n\nAcquisition of Print Monographs\n\nPaperback books\n\nWhen there is a significant difference in price between hardcover and paperback books, and the book would not be in frequent demand or the book will be outdated in a short period of time, paperbacks are bought to save funds.\n\nMultiple copies and duplicates\n\nIn order to provide the broadest range of materials to support the academic curriculum, the University Library will not normally buy multiple copies. Duplicates are purchased only under unusual circumstances as determined by circulation, reference needs and allocations.\n\nTextbooks\n\nTextbooks and their accompanying materials tend to be outdated rapidly. The Library does not use operational funds to purchase textbooks that are currently used in classes. The exception to this is classic textbooks in the technical, scientific, and business areas, which have become standard reference and review sources. Another exception is the purchase of textbooks for the teacher education program.\n\nOut of Print Materials\n\nThe Library will not purchase out of print materials unless the requested items are an important addition to the collection.\n\nAcquisition of Serials\n\nThe acquisition of serials requires a higher degree of selectivity and consideration than that of monographs because of ongoing commitment in terms of costs (including ongoing access to materials if in electronic format), binding, and storage.\n\nSerial Publications Defined\n\nA serial is a publication issued in successive parts bearing numeric or chronological designations and intended to be continued indefinitely. Periodicals, newspapers, and annuals are serial publications.\n\nPeriodical: These are journals, magazines, and newspapers issued and received on a regular basis and are put into the Periodical Collection.\n\nAnnuals/Continuations: Serials which are received, classified, and cataloged and are integrated into the Library collection other than the Periodical Collection. Types of continuations include monographic series, supplements, yearbooks, proceedings of conferences, and bibliographic indexes.\n\nASSESSMENTS AND POLICIES BY DISCIPLINE\n\nCollection Intensity\n\nThe Troy University Libraries use the following collection intensity levels.\n\n1. Minimal Level: A subject area in which few selections are made beyond very basic materials.\n\n2. Basic Information Level: A collection of up‑to‑date general materials that serves to introduce and define a subject.\n\n3. Instructional Support Level: A collection that is closely tied to the needs of the curriculum.\n\n3A Undergraduate Support Level: A collection that is adequate to support undergraduate instruction.\n\n3B Upper Level/Graduate Support Level: A collection that is adequate to support undergraduate instruction and most upper level / graduate instruction or independent studies.\n\n4. Research Level: A collection that includes major published source materials required for research needs.\n\n5. Comprehensive Level: A collection in which the Library includes all significant works of recorded knowledge for a necessarily defined and limited field.\n\nCOLLECTION DEVELOPMENT POLICY: ATHLETIC TRAINING, HEALTH PROMOTION, KINESIOLOGY, AND NURSING\n\nIntroduction\n\nThis collection is supervised and maintained by one of the subject specialists. Many individual subjects are included in the broad area of study, including athletic training, exercise science, kinesiology, nursing, and nutrition.\n\nCampus Connection\n\nThe College of Health Sciences houses all areas of the above-mentioned areas.\n\nFormats\n\nThe Troy University Library supports this program through physical books in the library and through a robust collection of electronic resources. Along with these resources, the library provides audio-visual materials.\n\nLevel of Collection Intensity\n\nAthletic training, 3B\n\nExercise science (collection intensity level not applicable—all courses for this program come from other academic areas)\n\nKinesiology, 3B\n\nNursing, 4\n\nNutrition (collection intensity level not applicable—all courses for this program come from other academic areas)\n\nTreatment of the Subject\n\nThe subject specialist selects material for purchase with priority given to those materials that directly support curricula. This priority arrives from a combination of variables: faculty recommendations, published reviews, cost, and format. The language of the collection is English and most publications are from the United States. Only single copies of monographs are purchased. There is an emphasis on current rather than retrospective selection.\n\nCOLLECTION DEVELOPMENT POLICY: COMMUNICATION AND HUMANITIES\n\nIntroduction\n\nThe communication and humanities collection is supervised by one of the subject specialists. Included in these areas are art and design, communication, dance, English, foreign languages, journalism, literature, music, public relations, and theatre.\n\nCampus Connection\n\nThe College of Communication and Fine Arts houses all areas of Communication and Humanities.\n\nFormats\n\nThe Troy University Library supports this program through physical books in the library and through a robust collection of electronic resources.

All requests are reviewed and assessed based on evaluative sources, reviews, relevance to the collection, etc. The language of the collection is primarily in English, but also includes items in other languages to reflect those taught here on campus. Most of the items held are published in the United States. Only single copies of monographs are obtained.\n\nCOLLECTION DEVELOPMENT POLICY: BUSINESS\n\nIntroduction\n\nThe business liaison strives to develop an active partnership with the Sorrell College of Business in advancing the leadership role of our students, faculty, staff, and the general reader by putting knowledge to work for the benefit of current and future decision-makers in corporations, government, the professions, and society; as well as shaping the future of our computer and information science-based society.\n\nMany individual subjects are included in the broad area of business, including accounting, business, economics, finance, information systems, law, management, and marketing.\n\nCampus Connection\n\nThe Sorrell College of Business houses all areas of business, including accounting, economics, finance, law, management, and marketing.\n\nFormats\n\nThe diversity of programs under the generic term “business” incorporates numerous formats for information access and display. These include, but are not limited to: physical books, DVDs, audio CDs, and a robust collection of electronic resources. Most of the acquisitions are in English. Emphasis is on current topics covering business, accounting, management, economics, finance and law, marketing, and computer and information science practices as they address the evolving business features in the United States, the European and African countries, Russia, China, and the world. Since globalization is a common theme in the business world, the Troy University Libraries’ collection also focuses on global business. Within the budget constraints, a balanced acquisition of material is maintained to address the ever-changing business picture throughout the world.\n\nAll resources are collected to serve the needs of business specialty students, faculty, staff, and the general reader working in business related areas who may need to familiarize themselves with principles of their respective field and/or subjects which are outside their main interests. Monographs are acquired that may provide perspectives outside the mainstream.\n\nCDs and DVDs cover a broad range of topics in association with classroom lectures and other written materials to the appropriate patron degree level, as well as for personal use. These may include, but are not limited to, conferences, production procedures, discussions, information technology, sciences, and others.\n\nLevel of Collection Intensity\n\nAccounting, 3B\n\nBusiness, 3B\n\nEconomics, 4\n\nFinance, 3B\n\nInformation systems, 3B\n\nLaw, 3A\n\nManagement, 4\n\nMarketing, 3B\n\nTreatment of the Subject\n\nScholarly and authoritative works are selected, as are other sources, to support study at the undergraduate and graduate (master’s) levels. Liaisons between the Business Reference Librarian and the Sorrell College of Business are ongoing in order to assist the development of specialty areas. Print materials include monographs but also research annuals and/or conference proceedings. Textbooks are not selected. DVDs covering biographies, business histories, and “how-to,” are added each year. Electronic sources are supported from other budget lines. The electronic sources are routinely evaluated to ensure coverage.\n\nCOLLECTION DEVELOPMENT POLICY: EDUCATION AND INSTRUCTIONAL MEDIA\n\nIntroduction\n\nThe Education collection is supervised by one of the subject specialists. Many individual subjects are included in the broad area of study. Some of them include Educational Leadership, Educational Psychology, Elementary Education, and Reading Education.\n\nCampus Connection\n\nThe College of Education houses all areas of education, including counseling, education, instructional media, interpreter training, and psychology.\n\nThe primary purpose of Instructional Media (IM) is to support the professional curriculum of the College of Education at all levels (Grades K-12). These resources are intended to be used by students in their efforts to develop the skills needed to identify, select, and evaluate the materials they will use in teaching. The secondary purpose is to provide media resources for all the subject areas.\n\nFormats\n\nAlong with physical books and periodicals, the Education collection contains children and young adult books, book serials, audio-visuals, and a robust collection of electronic resources.\n\nEmphasis is on current topics and trends in education, but historical works on education in all periods are acquired. English is the primary language of the collection and the geographic emphasis is primarily the United States. Multiple copies are purchased for heavily used titles only. Monographs and journals form the base of the collection with indexes, abstracts, and encyclopedias providing the basic reference information. Publications of educational professional organizations are selectively collected. The library also provides access to a multitude of academic journals through electronic databases.\n\nThe Instructional Media area houses all juvenile print materials and all audio-visual material. English is the primary language of the collection. Materials are selected with a recent copyright date unless they are of historical value. Gifts of books will be accepted if they are of a recent copyright date or of historical value. Current usage will determine the acceptance of duplicates.\n\nLevel of Collection Intensity\n\nCounseling, 4\n\nEducation, 4\n\nInstructional media (collection intensity level not applicable)\n\nInterpreter training, 3A\n\nPsychology, 4\n\nTreatment of the Subject\n\nThe Education subject specialist selects materials for purchase with priority given to faculty requests. A variety of review materials include, but are not limited to, publisher’s catalogs, promotional materials, and a vast number of journals which publish reviews such as Childhood Education, Choice, Harvard Educational Review, JOPERD, and Reading Teacher. All requests are reviewed and assessed based on relevance to the collections, source evaluations, reviews, and use patterns.\n\nSelection of juvenile books will be made from reviews in such periodicals as Booklist, Horn Book, Language Arts, Science and Children, Social Education, and Wilson Library Bulletin. For retrospective buying, selection will be made from standard book selection works such as Children’s Catalog, Junior High School Catalog, School Collection, and other basic lists.\n\nCOLLECTION DEVELOPMENT POLICY: GOVERNMENT DOCUMENTS (UNITED STATES)\n\nIntroduction\n\nThe United States Government Documents collection at Troy University, which comprises approximately 10% of the government documents that are available for the public, includes items that have been selected over the years to reflect the needs of the students, faculty, staff, and the general public served by this depository. The item selection profile is based in part on the recommended core collection for a small academic library as addressed in the Federal Depository Library Manual Desktop online.\n\nCampus Connection\n\nSubject emphasis for the documents collection has been placed in the areas of criminal justice, economics, education, health, military history, and politics that support the curricula of Troy University. The additional areas of small business law and census are selected to help supply the information needs of all interested parties.\n\nFormats\n\nThe collection includes pamphlets, books, microfiche, and reports. The Troy University Library also provides ProQuest Congressional, a database that allows users to access historical and current Congressional information and publications.\n\nLevel of Collection Intensity\n\nNot applicable.\n\nTreatment of the Subject\n\nThe Government Document print collection, numbering approximately 4,000 items, is well-rounded for the material identified for the Troy University depository program. Material use varies from curriculum to curriculum and year-to-year. Government Printing Office (GPO) posters are displayed at the entrance and throughout the Library, informing the patrons that the Troy University Library is a United States Government Documents depository. Librarians and many of the staff are familiar with the location and methods to access this information. The GPO’s move to online access of Government Documents has greatly decreased the size of the physical collection and drastically increased the electronic collection of the Troy University Library. The electronic documents can be accessed through the govinfo database, which is located on the Library’s databases page.\n\nThe Government Document Librarian makes item selection with input from subject specialists. The item selection profile is evaluated annually, at which time additions and deletions are made. Suggestions for additions and deletions are requested from the subject specialists as they evaluate specific areas of the general collection.\n\nThe majority of the U.S. government documents collection is classified by Superintendent of Documents Classification (SuDoc) number and is shelved in the Government Documents area. Selected series such as United States Reports and Area Handbooks are cataloged using the Library of Congress method. The subject specialists may request cataloging of specified documents. These publications, if soft bound, are rebound before being added to the general collection. Duplicates received as gifts may be added if use indicates or fills a void due to loss or damage.\n\nGeographic areas such as Alabama, Pike County, and the southeastern states are emphasized. Librarians can provide service to the patron if information outside this region is required. The collection has a broad coverage in terms of chronology in some areas. Current information is emphasized in most areas. The collection language is primarily English.\n\nAs documents are received, they are identified with a SuDoc number, in ink, affixed to the document. A staff member is responsible for the check-in of the documents and the affixing of the SuDoc number.\n\nWeeding is done annually each summer, or at other times as deemed appropriate by the Government Document Librarian, and disposed of in accordance with the GPO guidelines. Some superseded documents may be retained in order to fulfill any continuity issues that may be pertinent to a specific field for research purposes. This is on an exception basis only due to limited storage space.\n\nGovernment documents may circulate according to the same criteria applied to the general collection: a three-week loan period or as otherwise specified. Documents classified as reference do not circulate. All publications are available for in-house use during the hours the library is open. If a Government Document is brought to Circulation for checkout and a record cannot be found, a Librarian will make a temporary record using OCLC Worldshare.\n\nCOLLECTION DEVELOPMENT POLICY: HISTORY AND SOCIAL SCIENCE\n\nIntroduction\n\nThe History and Social Science collection is supervised by one of the subject specialists. Subjects included in the broad area of study include anthropology, criminal justice, geography, history, human services, international relations, philosophy, political science, public administration, rehabilitation, social science, social work, and sociology.\n\nCampus Connection\n\nThe College of Arts and Sciences houses anthropology, criminal justice, geography, history, international relations, philosophy, political science, public administration, and sociology.
