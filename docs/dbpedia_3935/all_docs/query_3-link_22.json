        "text": "In many cases, professors will require that students utilize articles from “peer-reviewed” journals. Sometimes the phrases “refereed journals” or “scholarly journals” are used to describe the same type of journals. But what are peer-reviewed (or refereed or scholarly) journal articles, and why do faculty require their use?\n\nPopular, Trade and Scholarly Information\n\n“Popular” newspapers and magazines containing news - Articles are written by reporters who may or may not be experts in the field of the article. Consequently, articles may contain incorrect information.\n\nJournals containing articles written by professionals and/or academics - Some trade or academic journals have articles that are written by a single person with little review. Although the articles are written by “experts,” any particular “expert” may have some ideas that are really “out there!”\n\nPeer-reviewed (refereed or scholarly) journals - Articles are written by experts and are reviewed by several other experts in the field before the article is published in the journal in order to ensure the article’s quality. (The article is more likely to be scientifically valid, reach reasonable conclusions, etc.) In most cases, the reviewers do not know who the author of the article is, so the article succeeds or fails on its own merit, not the reputation of the expert.\n\nHow do you determine whether an article qualifies as a peer-reviewed journal article?\n\nFirst, you need to be able to identify which journals are peer-reviewed. There are generally four methods for doing this"
