What's the problem?\n\nI think I have the correct password or library card number, but it isn't working. What's the problem?\n\nMake sure you've selected the academic or public library system you usually use. Use the \"Change my library\" link to change if you need to. Be sure to carefully check the name of the library--many NC LIVE libraries have similar names (e.g., \"Albemarle Regional Library\" vs. \"East Albemarle Regional Library\"). If you don't see your library branch name, look for your county or regional library name, or your college/university name.\n\nAcademic library users usually* need to enter student credentials.\n\nPublic library users usually* need to enter a library card number.\n\n*Some libraries use a special NC LIVE password. The passwords change every summer, so check with your local library to verify that you are using the correct password.\n\nIf you are still having difficulty, please contact the staff at your local library to get more information on how your library accesses NC LIVE.\n\nHow do I read or download an ebook from the HomeGrown Ebook Collection?\n\nTitles in the HomeGrown Ebook Collection are always available to any library user--with no waiting and no limits. That means there is no need for a holds list, checkout limits, or returns.\n\nFor the best experience, NC LIVE recommends accessing the HomeGrown Ebook Collection using the latest version of Google Chrome or Safari. These browsers are both available as a free download. You can still access the collection in other browsers, but you may encounter technical issues.\n\nReading a book in your browser is easy, and you don't even need to create an account. Simply select the book you would like to read and click on \"Read\" from the menu beside the book cover. On your computer, you can turn the pages by clicking on the arrows in the upper right corner. On a touchscreen device, simply swipe to turn the page.\n\nIf you have an iPad, Kindle Fire, or an Android tablet, you can download a title to read it offline. The BiblioBoard Library app is available for iPad®, Kindle Fire HD®, Nexus tablets® and Galaxy Tab® (4.0+) mobile devices.\n\nNote: You must create an account on the BiblioBoard website first before logging into the app. Follow the instructions below:\n\nStep 1: Visit the BiblioBoard website using the HomeGrown Ebook Collection link.\n\nStep 2: Click on the \"Menu\" link in the upper-left corner.\n\nStep 3: Click \"Don't have a profile? Create Yours Now!\" and create your own user account. (After filling in a username and password, you will be shown \"Your Libraries.\" You should see your library's name listed with a checkmark next to it. Scroll down and click \"Done.\")\n\nStep 4: Scroll down to the bottom of the page to the footer, and find the section labeled \"We have an app for this!\"\n\nStep 5: Download the Biblioboard Library app from the Apple, Google Play, or Amazon app store and login using the account information created in step 3.\n\nSummon FAQs\n\nWill my library have to pay for Summon?\n\nNo. NC LIVE has negotiated Summon into our agreement with ProQuest. Summon is available to your library at no charge.\n\nWhen can I implement Summon?\n\nIf you are interested, you can begin implementation of your instance of Summon as early as November 2017.\n\nHow do I implement Summon?\n\nYou can sign up for a preferred implementation spot using the form linked above.\n\nWhat does the NC LIVE Summon deal include?\n\nSummon, 360Link and E-Journal Portal.\n\nWhat if I already have Summon?\n\nContact your ProQuest representative with any questions. You will no longer have to pay for Summon beginning January 1, 2018, but it is prudent to contact your rep to discuss any details about your current contract.\n\nWhat if I already have another discovery service like EDS or WorldShare?\n\nYou can continue those, or adopt Summon. The choice is up to you.\n\nDo I have to implement Summon?\n\nAlthough Summon is available to all 205 NC LIVE member libraries, whether you choose to adopt it is entirely up to you. Some libraries may not see the value in a discovery service. Other libraries may already have a discovery service that they prefer. Implementing Summon is entirely optional.\n\nWho currently uses Summon in North Carolina?\n\nNorth Carolina libraries like NCSU, Wake Forest and Surry Community College, to name a few, currently use Summon. Also, NC LIVE has used Summon since 2015. The prominent search boxes on all of these webpages are entry points to Summon.\n\nOENC FAQs\n\nOENC Grants\n\nAre applications accepted for courses not on the list of OENC Courses for Adoption?\n\nThe OENC program has ended and is not currently accepting applications. While the program was operation, NC LIVE curated high quality content for the top 41 courses across North Carolina, however grant funds were open to instructors of any course and subject.\n\nDo you have a list of who has received grants and which textbooks they have adopted?\n\nPlease see our list of Awarded Grants for examples of materials that have been successfully adopted by North Carolina faculty through the Open Education North Carolina grant program.\n\nAm I limited to using what is on the OENC Collection? Could I adopt material from another organization or a locally adapted OER?\n\nThe OENC program has ended and is not currently accepting applications. While the program was operation, applicants and participants were not limited to the content in the Open Education North Carolina Collection. We hosted curated content there in an effort to make it easier for instructors to discover and adopt high-quality textbooks quickly. Applicants were welcome to use open materials from any source. Please see our OER Guide for other sources of open educational content.\n\nI already use an OER in my course. Can I still apply for a grant?\n\nThe OENC program has ended and is not currently accepting applications or distributing grants. While the program was operation, unfortunately, we could not provide grants to instructors who are already using open materials. Our grant funds were designated to incentivize instructors to move their courses from commercial textbooks/products to open materials.\n\nAre the grants available to individuals only, or can a team of instructors apply?\n\nThe OENC program has ended and is not currently accepting applications or distributing grants. While the program was operation, grants were available to both individuals and teams. An individual who received a grant was awarded $1,000. Teams may have received a slightly larger sum depending on their application, but could expect to receive at least $1,000 to split amongst themselves.\n\nHow long do I have to commit to using OER in my course?\n\nWe asked applicants to estimate how many sections of the course they (and their collaborators, if they have collaborators) would teach using OER over the next two years. However, you were only required to commit to using OER in your course for one semester. If you decide after that semester that you would like to return to using a commercial textbook, you are free to do so.\n\nIs there any effort to make OERs a part of a local QEP initiative?\n\nWe are not aware of any current efforts, but we encourage this idea!\n\nOnce I apply, how long will it take to receive a decision on my application?\n\nThe OENC program has ended and is not currently accepting applications or distributing grants.\n\nWhen will I receive the grant payment?\n\nRecipients will receive their funds after their first semester of open textbook implementation, upon completion of the end-of-semester survey.\n\nHow were these grants funded?\n\nNC LIVE and three of its Communities of Interest (the UNC System, NC Community College System, and NC Independent Colleges and Universities) provided funding for the OENC grants.\n\nOENC Collection\n\nAre the materials in the OENC Collection ADA and WCAG compliant? Are there VPATs available for the material in the hub?\n\nOpen educational materials come from a variety of sources and may or may not be ADA compliant. NC LIVE is committed to accessibility and is currently developing documentation about the accessibility of content in the OENC hub.\n\nDoes OpenStax offer print copies in color?\n\nAll OpenStax textbooks are available in print. Print versions are full color and bound with a hard cover.\n\nCan locally created ancillary materials be added to the OENC Collection?\n\nWe added some curated content to our hub. High-quality, locally created ancillary materials would be great candidates for this!\n\nWill OENC facilitate collaborative creation of ancillary materials or textbooks across institutions?\n\nWe do not coordinate these activities at this time.\n\nAdditional Questions\n\nStill have questions? Please Contact Us!\n\nHosted Proxy FAQs\n\nAre EZproxy logs or usage statistics available?\n\nEZproxy logs can be made accessible to libraries using NC LIVE Hosted Proxy. Please contact the help desk to fill out a consent form (library director signature required) and gain access to EZproxy logs.\n\nHow long does implementation of Hosted Proxy take?\n\nImplementation takes about 4-6 weeks.\n\nWhat resources am I responsible for?\n\nLibraries are only responsible for locally subscribed resources. NC LIVE manages stanzas and proxy access for all NC LIVE resources.\n\nWhat is the cost of Hosted Proxy?\n\nFree! There is not cost for member libraries to implementing and use NC LIVE Hosted Proxy.\n\nWhere do I update local resource stanzas?\n\nResources are updated using ProxyAdmin (https://proxyadmin.nclive.org/). Users login with the user name (not email) and password created at implementation. Need a refresher on how to use ProxyAdmin? Check out the video under \"Need Training\" on the NC LIVE Hosted Proxy page.\n\nWhat is my library's proxy configuration (link to configuration page)?\n\nCurrent library proxy configurations are available on the Proxy Configuration page. Please note this page is based on your IP address so the page must be viewed within your library.\n\nWhat authentication methods are supported? (SIP, Shibboleth, LDAP, III)\n\nNC LIVE Hosted Proxy is compatible with most authentication methods, including though not limited to: SIP, Shibboleth, LDAP, Innovative Interfaces Incorporated (III), SAML. If your preferred authentication method is not listed, please contact help@nclive.org and we can confirm if it is compatible with NC LIVE Hosted Proxy.\n\nWhat version of EZproxy is used and is it by port or name?\n\nNC LIVE uses the most recent version of EZproxy and it is configured by host name.\n\nTroubleshooting\n\nAfter adding/editing/removing stanzas, click 'export'\n\nOnce the proxy server has restarted, test access to the proxy server and resources\n\nIf the proxy server fails, remove the recently added stanza(s) and restart the proxy server (export)\n\nReview the entered stanza:\n\nare all lines correct\n\nverify an 'includefile database/example.txt' line is not present. Remove if one is.\n\ncontact the resource vendor to verify the stanza is correct\n\nEnter the revised stanza and restart the proxy server\n\nRepeat as needed\n\nWebsite Service FAQs\n\nWhat is the cost of the website service?\n\nThe Website Service is a one time cost of $300 for NC LIVE Libraries.\n\nHow long does it take before we can launch a new website?\n\nMany libraries are able to launch a new site in around two months. This time will be extended if new content is created or extensive restructing of the website and link architecture is completed (e.g. what links are included in main and sub menus and how pages link to each other).\n\nIf migrating to LibGuides for website management along with implementing the Website Service, plan for around 4-6 months.\n\nCan our current website be used with the Website Service?\n\nThe Website Service can only be used with a LibGuides website. If you are using another website service, such as WordPress or YouSeeMore, all content would need to be migrated to LibGuides first.\n\nHow is the content on the new site created and who is responsible for it?\n\nThe content for the Website Service is created and maintained by you! Each library is responsible for the content on the site. The Website Service only provides a design template.\n\nAre statistics available for our site once we move to the NC LIVE Website Service?\n\nStatistics for LibGuide pages are available under \"Statistics\" in the LibApps Admin Portal. Libraries with some technical experience may also consider implementing Google Analytics or Google Tag Manager to track statistics. These methods require adding a small amount of code to the Custom CSS provided with the Website Service.\n\nCan I reuse content from my current LibGuides site?\n\nYes, however we do recommend you use the preview aspect of the implementation tool to see how your current pages will look with the new design so you can easily identify any changes that may be needed.\n\nDoes the website service meet accessibility guidelines?\n\nThe Website Service strives to meet W3C Web Content Accessibility Guidelines level AA\n\nWhat if I need technical assistance?\n\nThe Website Service Best Practices Guide contains guidance on many popular questions and issues.
