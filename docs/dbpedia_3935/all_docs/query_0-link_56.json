        "text": "So, how do you write a good title tag these days?\n\nIn this section, we’ll walk you through a 6-step process for writing excellent title tags, step by step.\n\nStep 1: Good title tags start with good research\n\nEffective title tags depend on four types of research: keyword research, customer research, market research, and SERP research. In order to understand what to write about and how to write the title tag for the content you’ve written, spend time:\n\nUsing keyword research tools like Moz Keyword Explorer to understand how people are searching online for the topics covered by your web pages.\n\nSurveying and polling your customers and logging your conversations with them to understand how they talk about the topics covered by your web pages. How your audience refers to things may differ from how your business speaks of itself and its offering. Note the differences.\n\nAnalyzing your mostly highly-ranked online competitors to see how they are writing their title tags when they cover the same topics your web pages are covering. You can do this work manually or use tools like Moz’s True Competitor.\n\nStudying the search engine results for your most important search phrases to see what is already being ranked for them. Don’t just look at your competitors’ title tags, but look at what Google is surfacing in SERP features like the “People Also Ask” and “Related Searches” sections.\n\nTaken altogether, these four types of research should help you determine how to optimize each unique title tag with a combination of the most popular phrases you found via keyword research, the most common and intelligible phrases used by your customers, the most highly-ranked phrases used by your top competitors, and Google’s clues as to other ways in which people might be searching for the topics you cover. Combine all this knowledge with the best practices we’ll summarize next.\n\nStep 2: Incorporate standard best practices\n\nLet’s review what we’ve learned from the studies we’ve cited and incorporate this into how you write your title tags\n\nBe sure the title reflects the page contents accurately.\n\nKeep title tags in the 51-60 character limit, unless you’ve decided to write a longer title knowing that only part of it will display and that it may cause Google to rewrite this element.\n\nUse each keyword phrase only once per title tag.\n\nUse dashes instead of pipes and parentheses instead of brackets.\n\nWrite a unique title tag for each page.\n\n*Note that if you are writing title tags for a local business website, it is a standard best practice to be sure you are including geographic terms in your titles. For example, a chain of Mexican food restaurants should be sure the city name “Novato” is part of the title tag for its Novato branch web page, and that “San Rafael” is included in the title tag of its branch page for that location. Don’t depend on Google to assume the location of your business or customers. Make it clear in your title tags, as well as in your page content.\n\nStep 3: Pay attention to Google’s continual emphasis on writing for people, not search engines\n\nIf you’ve just started studying SEO, it can be a little confusing at first to get your head around Google’s oft-repeated edict that online publishers should create content for people instead of for search engines. After all, you are writing title tags, in part, so that search engines can understand and display the contents of your web pages. So, practically speaking, you will be thinking of the needs and preferences of search engines when you write each title tag."
