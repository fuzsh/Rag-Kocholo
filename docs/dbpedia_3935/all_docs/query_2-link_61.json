        "text": "Modern Campus CMS Website Search provides a search engine for your live website for web visitors to use. Search result pages are styled to match your website, and you can control the search function through an admin panel to exclude or promote pages and results.\n\nWebsite Search has a separate login and admin interface than Modern Campus CMS. Website Search features can be very extensive, with multiple configuration options. This page is not an exhaustive list of every possible configuration option; rather, it provides instructions on how to best set up and use Website Search for full functionality. Website Search can also feature an “Advanced” search option that visitors can use to narrow down their search results, though this is a separate addition to the standard implementation.\n\nAdditional documentation provided by the engine that Website Search utilizes can be accessed via two different ways. One is the Docs link in the upper right-hand corner of the top navigation bar. Additionally, each field in Website Search has a question mark beside it that you can click for an explanation of what that field controls.\n\nModern Campus CMS ConfigurationLink to this section\n\nIn addition to the administrator interface for Modern Campus CMS Website Search, your implementation may contain a PCF page, located at /_resources/search/_ou-search-settings.pcf, that configures display options on your live site. This feature is only available in instances of Website Search implemented on or after April 12, 2018.\n\nEdit this page in page parameters. After making changes, save and publish this page; you don't need to republish the search page.\n\nThe options available under “Custom Settings” are:\n\nSetting Up Your Search ProfileLink to this section\n\nOnce Modern Campus CMS Website Search is installed, your professional services provides you with a login URL and credentials for your search profile. The first time you log in, you’ll need to click on the Profiles tab and select your school’s profile from the list provided. After the profile has been selected, all setup happens in the Settings menu. Many of the settings will never need to be modified by you for Website Search to work properly, but you have the option of fine-tuning performance.\n\nBasic Walk Settings\n\nA \"walk\" is when Website Search scans your website to build an index of pages to use as search results. If your site blocks crawlers, you most likely need to enable (whitelist) the domain name for Modern Campus CMS Website Search. A walk indexes the site by starting from a base URL and following every link on that page, and then following each link on those subsequent pages, and so on and so forth. However, this only includes pages in your site (for example www.domain.edu) and not any links pointing to external pages.\n\nWhen you have finished configuring settings or making changes, select \"Update\" for the changes to take effect. Select \"GO\" to run a walk. You will not see the impact of settings changes on your search results page until a walk has been completed.\n\nAll Walk Settings\n\nThe All Walk Settings are more extensive and complicated than the basic ones. While there are many, many settings available, this section explains only the ones most commonly modified by Website Search administrators. All Walk Settings contains the same information as the Basic Walk Settings, as well as additional fields including the following:\n\nOnce you have finished configuring settings or making changes, select \"Update\" for the changes to take effect. Select \"Go\" to run a walk.\n\nSearch Settings\n\nThese settings configure the actual search function itself, including what web visitors see when they are searching for content on your website.\n\nWebsite Search keeps a test version of the search page in addition to the version on the live website. Selecting “Update Test” updates the test version of the page to match any changes you've made to the search settings. The test page can be viewed by navigating to Tools > Test Search. Note that the test search page may display differently in terms of styling, as it does not pull in the same XSL template the live page does. Note: Newer implementations circumvent this Test Search page to increase search results speed on the live search page.\n\nSelecting “Update Live and Test” applies changes made to search settings to both the live and test versions. “Copy Live to Test” matches the test version to the live one; this can be useful if there are changes you want to revert.\n\nWebsite Search contains a number of tools to help you maximize the efficacy and accuracy of the search. This section explains the most useful, commonly-utilized tools within the system.\n\nList/Edit URLs\n\nUse \"List/Edit URLs\" to see any and all URLs indexed by Website Search. Enter text in the single-line text field to pull up results containing that text. Using only an * character as a wildcard pulls up every URL indexed.\n\nThe dropdown options are “List,” “Download,” “Delete,” and “Replicate.”\n\n“List” displays a list of the URLs on the screen.\n\n“Download” downloads a .txt file containing all the results to your computer.\n\n“Delete” removes any URLs matching the query from the database; note that it does not affect the actual page in Modern Campus CMS, just the indexed location in Website Search.\n\n“Replicate” creates a copy of the indexed entry or entries in the database.\n\nYou can also choose the order by which results are displayed, including URL depth, alphabetical order, time last visited or modified, and size.\n\nSelecting a URL takes you to information about that specific page. Note that this is not the only location from which you can view URLs for pages and select the URL to view page details.\n\nBrowse URLs by Folder\n\nThis tool displays any and all URLs included in the current index in a folder structure format. The Items column notes how many individual pages/files are contained within that folder. Selecting a URL takes you to information about that specific page.\n\nList Duplicates\n\nEnter a URL into the field to see if there are any duplicates of it in the search index. Duplicates can be removed from the index; this improves the speed and relevancy of search results.\n\nTest Search\n\nRun test searches and see what results appear. Bear in mind that this doesn't use your site styling, but instead applies a generic format. This feature is not available in Search modules that were implemented after Fall 2017.\n\nTest Fetch\n\nEnter a URL into the field to test whether that URL would be included in the index. This is a troubleshooting tool which returns information about the page, including the Response code for the URL, and a Text output of content that would be included as the page’s body content if it were added to the Website Search index. Running a test fetch on a URL does not actually add a page into the index.\n\nQuery Log\n\nView various reports on the queries visitors have been entering in your search. It also contains the ability to export results as a CSV.\n\nBest BetsLink to this section\n\nThough Website Search displays results in order of relevancy, you may wish to promote certain URLs for certain keywords. For example, you may want the Biology Program home page to be the first result when someone searches for “biology”. Best Bets can be styled and highlighted differently than the rest of the search results; for example, they could be displayed with a colored box around them.\n\nBest bets are accessed via the Tools menu. Selecting this option shows a list of all best bet groups. A best bet group is the set from which Website Search pulls best bets; you will in all likelihood never need another best bet group beyond the default one.\n\nCreating a Best Bet\n\nTo make a new best bet:\n\nFrom a best bet group, select \"Manage Best Bets.\"\n\nScroll to the bottom of the best bet list and click \"Add a Best Bet.\"\n\nFill out the fields:\n\nURL: The URL of the page you want to be the search result.\n\nPriority: Enter a number. If you have multiple best bets that match a keyword or query, the one with the highest priority is the first result. The larger the number, the higher the priority.\n\nTitle: If the result type includes title, this displays with the search result.\n\nKeywords: Any query containing at least one of these keywords brings up the result. Separate keywords with spaces.\n\nDescription: If the result type includes description, this displays with the search result.\n\nClick \"Update\" to save your changes.\n\nYou can also add a Best Bet by going to the Tools menu and selecting “List/Edit URLs” or \"Browse URLs by Folder.\" Search for the URL you want to add a best bet for, and click on the URL. The section “Best Bet Words” is where you can create a best bet.\n\nManaging Best Bets\n\nWhen viewing the list of best bets, select the pencil icon to edit a best bet, using the same fields as present when creating a new field. You can also delete a best bet by selecting the red “X”. Select “Update” for any changes to take effect.\n\nBest Bet Settings"
