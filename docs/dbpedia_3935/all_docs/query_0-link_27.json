        "text": "Perhaps the most significant tool of our internet age is the web search engine, providing a powerful interface for accessing the vast amount of information available on the world wide web and beyond. While still in its infancy compared to the knowledge tools that precede it–such as the dictionary or encyclopedia–the impact of web search engines on society and culture has already received considerable attention from a variety of academic disciplines and perspectives.\n\nThe paper argues that searching and search engines are very important aspects of the World Wide Web. It asserts that commercial search engines have not progressed in capability since 1998 and the introduction of Google and its PageRank algorithm. PageRank is identified as a problem that prevents users from obtaining the search engine results that would be of most use to them. The basic problems of search engine retrieval are considered alongside two areas of research which if successful could address them. The question, “Will search engines ever get any better?” is posed.\n\nThe fast growth of network information, using search engines to search information has developed into an important part of one’s life every day. In recent years, there is a research focus on the search engine optimization technologies used to rapidly publish business information onto the search engines by which higher rankings can be reserved. Each search engine uses unique algorithm to execute the queries in their perspective search engines. This paper establishes a comparative study on four different search engines which tries to optimize itself by individual unique algorithms. It also shows the pros and cons of the previous algorithm and refinement in the latest algorithm. The vivid search engines which are discussed are: GOOGLE, BING, YAHOO and ASK.\n\nLimitations and shortcomings of traditional approaches for evaluating information retrieval tools, particularly regarding to the consideration of the user, the manner in which these approaches measure the adequacy between the user’s query and the documents returned, and the characteristics consideration of the search tool itself, have motivated our reflections for the exploitation of contextual elements around the user, the query and the search tool during the evaluation process. This paper presents a new approach based on three complementary levels of context for evaluating information retrieval systems. The experiments gives at the end of this article has shown the applicability of the proposed approach to real research tools. The tests were performed with the most popular searching engine (i.e. Google, Bing and Yahoo) selected in particular for their high selectivity. The results have revealed that the evaluation of search engines at three different levels of context is a promisi...\n\nPurpose: To compare five major Web search engines (Google, Yahoo, MSN, Ask.com, and Seekport) for their retrieval effectiveness, taking into account not only the results but also the results descriptions. Design/Methodology/Approach: The study uses real-life queries. Results are made anonymous and are randomised. Results are judged by the persons posing the original queries. Findings: The two major search engines, Google and Yahoo, perform best, and there are no significant differences between them. Google delivers significantly more relevant result descriptions than any other search engine. This could be one reason for users perceiving this engine as superior. Research Limitations: The study is based on a user model where the user takes into account a certain amount of results rather systematically. This may not be the case in real life. Practical Implications: Implies that search engines should focus on relevant descriptions. Searchers are advised to use other search engines in addition to Google. Originality/Value: This is the first major study comparing results and descriptions systematically and proposes new retrieval measures to take into account results descriptions."
