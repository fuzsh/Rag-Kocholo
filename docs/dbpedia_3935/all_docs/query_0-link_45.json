We're also making it easier to monitor and fix the structured data required to enable this display using the Search Console Shopping reports and tools.\n\nGoogle is expanding the display of shipping information on Search\n\nWhen shopping, people want to know the total price for the products they're purchasing, including the shipping price. Shipping speed, cost, and return policy are major factors considered by shoppers when buying products online. Often, consumers will not complete a purchase because the shipping cost is too high, the shipping speed is not fast enough, or return information isn't clear. Therefore, displaying shipping and return information clearly up front is critical for the success of your online sales.\n\nGoogle Search can already display product pricing, now your products will be eligible to display Shipping and Return information on Google Search in the US and in more countries soon.\n\nHow to provide shipping and return information to Google?\n\nTo show shipping and returning information on product search results, add the information using structured data markup similar to how you have marked your products. If you already submit your product information to Google in the Merchant Center, Google will use your Shipping & Returns information from Merchant Center the same way.\n\nUse Search Console to monitor and fix your shipping and returns information\n\nLastly, Search Console is making it easier to understand when your products are missing this information. If your products don't have shipping and return information or the shipping and return information was added incorrectly, you'll receive warnings in the Merchant Listings report and via email notifications."
