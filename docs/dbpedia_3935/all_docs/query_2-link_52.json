        "text": "When you want to learn or research about topics, mostly you often turn to search engines like Google. Isn’t it?\n\nBut did you know other search engines are designed specifically for digging deep into topics?\n\nThese search engines go beyond just finding basic information. They help you find detailed and thorough answers to your questions.\n\nIn this post, we’ll explore the best search engines for in-depth research. So, without any further ado, let’s get started.\n\n1 What Are Search Engines?\n\nSearch engines are sophisticated software systems designed to help you find relevant information on the internet. They work by indexing vast web pages and then retrieving and displaying results based on user queries or search terms.\n\nSearch engines use algorithms to analyze and rank web pages according to their relevance to the audiences’ query. These algorithms consider factors like keywords, website authority, relevance, and user engagement metrics to determine the most appropriate results.\n\nWhen a user enters a search query into a search engine, the engine scans its index to find matching web pages and then presents them in a list format, usually with the most relevant results appearing at the top. The user can then click the links provided to access the desired information.\n\n2 Best Search Engines\n\nBefore we discuss the various types of search engines, below is the market share of the search engines. According to Statista, Google is dominating the market share with 81.95 %, followed by the other search engines.\n\nLet us now discuss the top search engines.\n\n2.1 Google\n\nGoogle Search, commonly referred to as Google, is the most widely used global web search engine.\n\nIt was developed by Google LLC and was launched in September 1997 by Larry Page and Sergey Brin. Google has since become the most dominant search engine, with the majority of web searches conducted through its platform.\n\nGoogle is extremely easy to use. You need to enter your query and click the Enter key, and Google will provide you with the most relevant results for your search.\n\nGoogle employs numerous algorithms, known as ranking systems, to swiftly and accurately deliver search results to users. In addition to its search engine, Google provides a range of popular services such as Google Maps, YouTube, and Gmail.\n\nGoogle displays rich snippets in search results, which provide additional context and information beyond the page title and meta description.
