        "text": "In the Education section you will enter your high school grades and current courses. Some colleges also need you to self report your high school transcript. You can check out your Courses & Grades section to learn more.\n\nYou can share your interests and who you are outside of the classroom in the activities section. You can share information about things like work, hobbies, clubs, and community engagement. And don't forget, family responsibilities can be important to share as well. This is the place to show colleges what makes you unique!\n\nYou may self-report scores for any standardized tests in the Testing section. Every college has different testing requirements. Some colleges will always need your test scores. Other colleges may be flexible or have a test optional policy. Be sure to check the Testing policy of the colleges on your list.\n\nMany colleges collect this information in the Family section for demographic purposes. We will ask for your parents occupation, employment status, and education level. If applicable, we will also ask which college(s) they attended and how many degrees they have earned.\n\nThe Activities section isn't the only place to show your passion and where you excel! You will also have the chance to share any academic honors or achievements from high school.\n\nParents will only need to submit a form if you apply using a college's early decision deadline. They will fill out part of your early decision agreement.\n\nOther recommenders are usually non academic recommenders like coaches, employers, and peers. They give insight into your interests and activities outside of the classroom.\n\nEach college's Explore Colleges profile provides lots of information about the college. You can find details on application information, campus culture, scheduling visits, and more.\n\nIn the My Colleges or College Search tab, you can learn more using a school's college information page. Here you can see requirements for testing, writing, deadlines, and more.\n\nTheÂ requirements grid is a comprehensive PDF that lists all the colleges that use the Common App and their requirements. You can also find the grid within the application.\n\nWe maintain a list of all Common App colleges andÂ their essay prompts. This resource will help as you begin planning your essays. For more help on planning essays, check out our essay planning worksheet.\n\nColleges can either make the personal essay optional or required. In the writing section of your Common App tab, you will see a table that lists each college's requirements.\n\nMany colleges include short answer questions or essay prompts within this section. You can find specific information about each college's individual writing promptsÂ here.\n\nSome colleges use a separate writing supplement. Not all colleges have a writing supplement. Some colleges only request this supplement based on how you answer other questions. You can find more information about writing supplements on the Dashboard or your My Colleges tab."
