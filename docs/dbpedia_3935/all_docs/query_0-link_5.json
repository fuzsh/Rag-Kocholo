She had never asked for one, so she sought help.\n\n“Teacher letter of recommendation,” she typed into TikTok’s search bar.\n\nMs. Moore, 15, scrolled TikTok’s app until she found two videos: one explaining how to ask teachers for a recommendation letter and the other showing a template for one. Both had been made by teachers and were easier to understand than a Google search result or YouTube video, said Ms. Moore, who is planning to talk to her teachers this month."
