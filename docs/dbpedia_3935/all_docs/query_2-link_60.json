Without access to UDLib /SEARCH, our ability to continue academic research would be limited. As we face a year that will probably include a need for remote learning at some level, UDLib/SEARCH will be key to meeting our students educational needs.\n\nâ€”English Teacher (Department Chair) at Mount Pleasant High School"
