        "text": "He Cheng became an official in 1403 and served three successive emperors. Sometime in the 1440s, he begged for permission to retire and is said to have lived to the age of ninety-eight, planting bamboo and raising cranes. It is recorded that at the approach of rain he would go into the mountains “to gaze at ranges of peaks and great rivers, with mists and clouds billowing and flowing in appearance.” Such direct experiences of nature were unusual among painters of the time, who usually created landscape paintings not by looking at nature, but by emulating the pictorial and stylistic traditions of earlier painters. For this landscape, although He Cheng drew on his experience of nature, he nevertheless followed old masters and employed a wet, horizontal dotting, a technique associated with the Song dynasty scholar painters Mi Fu and Mi Youren."
