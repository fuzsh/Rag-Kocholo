        "text": "The Ballad of Mulan is the oldest known version of Mulan’s story. Most likely composed during the era of Northern Wei (around 400 AD), this one poem ended up inspiring countless retellings for centuries to come.\n\nThe Balad most likely began as oral tradition, and was passed down for over a century until it was finally preserved in written form during the Tang dynasty. But as an anonymous and undated work, very little can be said about it with certainty.\n\nThe version that was finally put into writing begins with Mulan sitting in front of her loom, weeping over the fact that her father has just received his conscription orders. Because Mulan has no elder brother, she is resolved to take her father’s place. Upon returning, she is offered a prominent position but turns it down; her only request is that she be sent home to her family.\n\nAfter Mulan is reunited with her parents and she has resumed her feminine appearance, her comrades are shocked to discover that she is a woman—for the twelve years that they fought together, none of them had suspected anything. The Ballad concludes by commenting, “When a pair of rabbits run side by side, who can distinguish male from female?”\n\nSome scholars have argued that this final line stands in stark contrast against China’s patriarchal culture, thus supporting the notion that the Ballad of Mulan was written during an era when Confucian values temporarily lost their sway over Chinese thought. However, not all experts are in agreement. After all, those who supported the patriarchy would have praised a woman for sacrificing everything to save her father.\n\nAlthough most modern historians assume that the Ballad of Mulan is a work of fiction, it was not until recent times that the historicity of Mulan began to be questioned. Previously, the story of Mulan was assumed to be a real historical event. A memorial dedicated to Mulan during the Yuan dynasty explicitly mentions the Ballad of Mulan and cites it as a historical document. During the Ming Dynasty, a number of historians became increasingly interested in Mulan’s story (see The Legend of Mulan During the Ming Dynasty).\n\nNevertheless, the arguments that cast doubt upon the historicity of Mulan’s story are weighty. The historical documents which insist that Mulan was a real person propose contradictory accounts of her life. Each historian offers a different set of details about her family, the time in which she lived, and the enemy against whom she fought. Because no one historical account has emerged as the authoritative record of her life, the majority of modern historians have decided to reject all of these so-called historical documents and conclude that the authenticity of Mulan’s story cannot be verified.\n\nEnglish Paraphrase\n\nFor an English translation, please see Wikisource or Asia for Educators.\n\nThe sound of creaking.\n\nMulan sits in the doorway in front of her loom.\n\nWhen the loom grows silent,\n\nWe can only hear the sound of her sighs.\n\nGirl, who are you thinking about?\n\nGirl… who do you long for?\n\n(Mulan replies)\n\n“There is only one man I think about\n\nThere is only one man I long for\n\nLast night I saw the conscription notice,\n\nThe Khan is issuing a great draft –\n\nA dozen volumes of battle rolls,\n\nEach one with my father’s name.\n\nMy father has no son old enough to take his place,\n\nI, Mulan, have no elder brother.\n\nI’m willing to buy a horse and saddle,\n\nI will take my father’s place in battle.”\n\nShe buys a fine steed at the east market;\n\nA saddle and blanket at the west market;\n\nA bridle at the south market;\n\nAnd a long whip at the north market.\n\nAt dawn, she leaves her parents’ home\n\nand camps beside the Yellow River before dusk.\n\nFrom far away, she cannot hear the sounds of her parents calling for her\n\nOnly the rushing waters of the Yellow River.\n\nShe leaves the Yellow River at dawn,\n\nAnd reaches reach Black Mountain before dusk.\n\nFrom far away, she cannot hear the sounds of her parents calling for her\n\nOnly the cries of the enemy cavalry in the Yàn hills.\n\nShe traveled ten thousand li,\n\nShe flew over mountains and through mountain passes\n\nThe sound of a war gong pierces the air,\n\nThe winter sun shines brightly on her coat of steel.\n\nThe general dead after a hundred battles,\n\nThe warriors return after ten years.\n\nThey return to see the Son of Heaven,\n\nSitting in the royal court\n\nHe unrolls the scroll of merit a dozen times\n\nGiving hundreds and thousands of rewards\n\nThe Khan asks Mulan what she desires\n\n(Mulan replies)\n\nI have no need to be promoted to a prominent position\n\nI only ask for a camel that can travel a thousand li\n\nThat can take me back to my hometown\n\nHer parents hear that their daughter has returned,\n\nThey welcome her at the entrance to the town.\n\nWhen Elder Sister hears of Mulan’s return,\n\nshe stands in the doorway wearing a beautiful dress\n\nWhen Little Brother hears that his sister has returned,\n\nHe sharpens his knife to slaughter a pig and a lamb.\n\n(Mulan speaks)\n\n“I open the door to my eastern chamber,\n\nAnd sit on the bed of my western chamber.\n\nI take off my military robes\n\nAnd put on my old clothes.\n\nI sit in front of the window as I comb my long flowing hair\n\nAnd look into the mirror as I apply makeup\n\nI go outside to see my comrades\n\nThey are all shocked and astounded.\n\n“We traveled together for twelve years,” (they say),\n\n“But we never suspected that Mulan was a woman!”\n\nMost people tell the gender of a rabbit by its movement:\n\nThe male runs quickly, while the female often keeps her eyes shut.\n\nBut when the two rabbits run side by side,\n\nCan you really discern whether I am a he or a she?\n\nOriginal Chinese text\n\nReferences"
