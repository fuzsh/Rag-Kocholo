        "text": "Nowadays, most studies conducted on Chinese photography focus on social documentation and the tools used for realistic reportage. Furthermore, analyses are generally based on the aesthetic principles referred to by the Maoist ideological system, which actually considers photography as an instrument of propaganda for power legitimacy. The book I wrote together with Antonella Flamminii (containing an essay by Yee Wah Foo), is the first Italian monograph on the history of photography in China, and it considers the elements pre-existing in Chinese culture as well. This is because the Chinese element, despite political interferences, has persisted in art since antiquity and is also the result of a hard experimentation, mainly practised by amateurs, so that official channels were involved too. In this article, I would like to place the focus on certain issues related with the origins of Chinese photography, because the process of composition reveals many aspects in common with the theoretical and technical assumptions of traditional painting. the photographic tools provided by the West, could have found a rich soil amongst the Chinese, because there already existed an indigenous research in the field of vision. Photography has rightly been defined as a universal code comprehensively shared and understood all over the world. It is the result of the experimentation of many ways of expression and composition that have participated to the dialogue of civilizations. Even if we can affirm that Western culture has influenced Chinese photographers, they seem to do nothing but use the photographic tools to evoke the style or to maintain the compositional procedure by which the ancestral painting is built up, as demonstrated by some peculiar landscapes, scenes of daily life, and portraits. Although we should not neglect that the selection of these three themes still depends on the contact with Westerners, as demonstrated by our analysis, there are still many Chinese photographers, such as Lai Afong and Liang Shitai, that maintain the lyric aspirations of traditional Chinese paintings. This was the first step of the revolution of Chinese photography that achieved its climax just in the twentieth century."
