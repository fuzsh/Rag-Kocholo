        "text": "A popular Japanese makeup account tweeted that young girls today don’t know how to self-style and will all do the same typical popular douyin-makeup instead of finding what works for them. They said they wished they were alive in the the early Heisei Era (1989-2001) when there were clear cut subcultures. For example in the Golden Era, there was Yaguchi and Maki who looked up to gyaru so that was how they styled themselves. During promo for Do It Now Rika called Fujiwara Norika who was popular with women in their 20s an influence on her hairstyles and fashion. In 2000 and 2001, Kei said she liked Harajuku street fashion so she styled herself that way with her hairstyles. In an interview with staff when she was auditioning on ASAYAN Aibon said she liked gyaru fashion and designer brands like Prada but when she debuted she was styled in that Nicola magazine fashion and Angel Blue style fashion that was popular with school kids because that suited her look better than the popular gyaru look.\n\nCompare that to today, you see H!P members all do the same douyin-makeup. That style works great for girls like Kirara and Nanami but Roko always looks a bit off even though she’s doing the same exact makeup. I would suspect that’s why a lot of people complain a lot of H!P members look alike. They’re all doing the same exact douyin makeup style (thick brow, creating the exact same eye shape, individual lash placement, a thin delicate eyeliner wig, drawing pronounced eye bags with brown contour, red lip) that’s popular without thinking about if it suits them or not. As an idol fans hold them to higher standards when it comes to self producing.\n\nA couple of reasons. Some fans started disliking her because she got tons of lines over the other members and she had been a member for a long long time, also because they thought her leadership style was too strict… The straw that broke the camel’s back though seems to have been that Kaga Kaede openly voiced some frustration about her lack of lines and she decided to graduate. Mizuki’s reaction to the frustration of fans/the whole situation didn’t sit well with lots of people… A kind anon summarized some of the Fukumura-Kaga drama in this post."
