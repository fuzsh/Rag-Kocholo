There are ten different images of each of 40 distinct subjects. For some subjects, the images were taken at different times, varying the lighting, facial expressions (open / closed eyes, smiling / not smiling) and facial details (glasses / no glasses). All the images were taken against a dark homogeneous background with the subjects in an upright, frontal position (with tolerance for some side movement).\n\nCitation: Samaria, F. S. (1994).

All these photographs have been manipulated to appear more or less agentic and communal (Big Two personality dimensions) as well as open to experience, conscientious, extraverted, agreeable, and neurotic (Big Five personality dimensions). Thus, the database consists of forty photographs of different individuals and 14 variations of each of them signaling different personalities. Using this database therefore allows to investigate the impact of personality on different outcome variables in a very systematic way.\n\nCitation: Walker, M., Schönborn, S., Greifeneder, R., & Vetter, T.

High-resolution standardized photographs were taken and supported by the following materials: (a) basic demographic and appearance-related information, (b) two types of landmark configurations (for Webmorph and geometric morphometrics (GM)), (c) facial width-to-height ratio (fWHR) measurement, (d) information on photography parameters, (e) perceptual norms provided by raters.\n\nCitation: Saribay SA, Biten AF, Meral EO, Aldan P, Třebický V, Kleisner K (2018) The Bogazici face database: Standardized photographs of Turkish faces with supporting materials.

The coordinates of the eyes, the nose and the center of the mouth for each frontal face are provided in a ground truth file. This information can be used to align and crop the human faces or as a ground truth for a face detection algorithm.

Ma, Joshua Correll, and Bernd Wittenbrink. The CFD is intended for use in scientific research. It provides high-resolution, standardized photographs of male and female faces of varying ethnicity between the ages of 17-65. Extensive norming data are available for each individual model. These data include both physical attributes (e.g., face size) as well as subjective ratings by independent judges (e.g., attractiveness). The database consists of a main image set and several extension sets.\n\nCFD\n\nThe main CFD set consists of images of 597 unique individuals. They include self-identified Asian, Black, Latino, and White female and male models, recruited in the United States. All models are represented with neutral facial expressions. A subset of the models is also available with happy (open mouth), happy (closed mouth), angry, and fearful expressions.\n\nCitation: Ma, D. S., Correll, J., & Wittenbrink, B. (2015).

Image data consist of approximately 500 image sequences from 100 subjects. Accompanying meta-data include annotation of FACS action units and emotion-specified expressions. Subjects range in age from 18 to 30 years. Sixty-five percent were female; 15 percent were African-American and three percent Asian or Latino.\n\nSubjects were instructed by an experimenter to perform a series of 23 facial displays that included single action units (e.g., AU 12, or lip corners pulled obliquely) and action unit combinations (e.g., AU 1+2, or inner and outer brows raised). Each begins from a neutral or nearly neutral face. For each, an experimenter described and modeled the target display. Six were based on descriptions of prototypic emotions (i.e., joy, surprise, anger, fear, disgust, and sadness).\n\nCitation: Kanade, T., Cohn, J. F., & Tian, Y. (2000, March).

There are 14 images for each of 200 individuals, a total of 2800 images. All images are colourful and taken against a white homogenous background in an upright frontal position with profile rotation of up to about 180 degrees. Scale might vary about 10% and the original size of each image is 640x480 pixels. All faces are mainly represented by students and staff at FEI, between 19 and 40 years old with distinct appearance, hairstyle, and adorns.

Each expression was created using a directed facial action task and all expressions were FCAS coded to assure identical expressions across actors.\n\nThe set contains expressions of happiness, sadness, anger, fear, disgust, and embarrassment as well as a neutral expression for each actor.\n\nContact: Social Psychophysiology Laboratory, Université du Québec à Montréal\n\nThe Academic MORPH database (non-commercial) was collected over a span of 5 years with numerous images of the same subject (longitudinal).This is not a controlled collection (i.e., it was collected in real-world conditions). The dataset also contains metadata in the form of age, gender, and race. The database has 55,134 images of 13,618 subjects.\n\nContact: Available for purchase\n\nThe MMI Facial Expression Database is an ongoing project, that aims to deliver large volumes of visual data of facial expressions to the facial expression analysis community. The database consists of over 2900 videos and high-resolution still images of 75 subjects.\n\nCitation: Valstar, M., & Pantic, M. (2010, May).

Actors from a diverse sample were chosen to portray emotional expressions within this dataset. To be precise, the actors were African-American (N = 10), Asian-American (N = 6), European-American (N = 25), Latino-American (N = 2). The images contained in this dataset include eight emotional expressions, namely: neutral, angry, disgust, surprise, sad, calm, happy, and afraid. Both open and closed mouth versions were provided for all emotional expressions, with the exception of surprise (only open mouth provided) and happy (high arousal open mouth/exuberant provided).\n\nCitation: Tottenham, N., Tanaka, J.

All images are black and white. A brochure providing norms is included with the collection. It is important to note that these images are not identical in intensity or facial configuration.\n\nContact: Paul Elkman\n\nThe Radboud Faces Database (RaFD) is a set of pictures of 67 models (including Caucasian males and females, Caucasian children, both boys and girls, and Moroccan Dutch males) displaying 8 emotional expressions.

Each individual is shown in a range of poses from profile to frontal views – each in a separate directory labelled 1a, 1b, … 1t and images are numbered consecutively as they were taken. The files are all in PGM format, approximately 220 x 220 pixels with 256-bit grey-scale.\n\nCitation: Wechsler, H., Phillips, J. P., Bruce, V., Soulie, F. F., & Huang, T. S. (Eds.). (2012).

It comprises 600 images of 400 people which can be separated into 200 groups. Each group is composed of child, young parent and old parent images. Most of images in the database are real-world collections of public figures (celebrities and politicians) from Internet. To the best of our knowledge, it is the first database that contains all children, young parents and old parents for the purpose of kinship verification.\n\nCitation: Ming Shao, Siyu Xia and Yun Fu, “Genealogical Face Recognition based on UB KinFace Database,” IEEE CVPR Workshop on Biometrics (BIOM), 2011.\n\nContact: Yun Raymond Fu, yunfu@ece.neu.edu\n\nThis database contains 550 photos of US politicians who competed either in a gubernatorial race (248) or in a house race (302). The database also contains the politicians’ perceived competence from their photos, as measured in a forced choice competence judgement of participants unfamiliar with the politicians. As such, these judgments simply indicate perceptions and are in no way indicative of the actual competence of the politicians.\n\nContact: Alexander Todorov, University of Chicago\n\nThe Yale Face Database (size 6.4MB) contains 165 grayscale images in GIF format of 15 individuals.
