        "text": "Michigan is one of the most unique places in America to hunt for rocks, not only because of the wide variety of stones that can be found here, but because of the awe-inspiring views that come along with the hobby of rock hunting. From the foot of 400+ sand dunes on Lake Michigan to the mountainous terrain of the Keweenaw’s rugged beaches, the scenery is half the draw for many rockhounds.\n\nI am far from an expert when it comes to the different stones Michigan has to offer, but I have been to dozens of rock beaches across the state. I have seen a lot, and I have taken photographs and videos at almost every single beach we have visited. Here are some of my favorite rock beaches in Michigan, the rocks you might find there, and other things to see while visiting those places.\n\nDisclaimer: Pursuant Glass v. Goeckel (2005), the public has the right to the shoreline of all of the Great Lakes for walking and navigation purposes. This means that so long as you do not trespass to access the water, and so long as you stay within the high water line, you are allowed to rock pick on almost all Great Lake shorelines in Michigan. It is also important to note that just because you can walk somewhere, doesn’t mean that you should. Many people’s homes are being threatened by the Great Lakes high water levels, causing them to build seawalls. Whereas I do not agree with these structures being built, I understand their purpose, and try to stay away from them. Some areas in Michigan do not allow you to take rocks, including all National Parks and Forests. You are also only allowed to take 25 pounds of rock per year from Michigan state land. That might seem like a lot, but believe me, you will get there quicker than you think! Onto the fun part—\n\nEastern Upper Peninsula\n\nThe eastern portion of Michigan’s Upper Peninsula was the first region that I truly had a problem forcing myself to leave a beach to stop looking for rocks. Lake Superior is by far the best of the Great Lakes for rockhounding due to the abundance of agates, jasperlite, unakite, and because of the breathtaking scenery that surrounds you while hunting. Although agates won’t just hop into your bucket, if you look long enough on any beach on the shipwreck coast, odds are, you’ll find one. When in doubt, just keep walking!\n\nOur favorite rock beaches in the Eastern Upper Peninsula are Whitefish Point, Vermilion Point Nature Preserve, Muskallonge Lake State Park, and Agate Beach. If you’re already way up there, you might as well stop by Tahquamenon Falls, Newberry, and the Mouth of the Two Hearted River.\n\nThe western half of the Upper Peninsula, in particular the Keweenaw Peninsula, is the best rockhouning region in Michigan. The shoreline from Ontonagon to Copper Harbor is littered with rocks of all kinds, and speaking relatively compared to other beaches in Michigan, covered in agates. Any shores in close proximity to Misery Bay, the rocky coast west of Calumet, and the beaches east and west of Copper Harbor are a great bet to find agates, but any beach with fresh Lake Superior gravel is a good place to start your rock hunting journey. Not only do you have an alright change of finding an agate, but additionally copper, iron, and silver are possible finds as well. No matter where you are in the western Upper Peninsula, if there are rocks, you are in the right place!\n\nOur favorite rock beaches in the Western Upper Peninsula are Calumet Waterworks Park and Gratiot River County Park. If you are passing through, you might as well hike Hogback Mountain near Marquette, explore the Quincy Mill site on Torch Lake, and take Cliff Drive on your way to Copper Harbor.\n\nCheck out our Keweenaw Peninsula Rock Hunting Guide, too!"
