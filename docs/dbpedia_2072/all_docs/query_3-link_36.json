        "text": "Here is why a subscription-based app business is like a strategy game 🚀 Building charisme feels like a complex numbers game where our current goal is to become cash-flow positive. Let’s break this all down into some easy-to-understand formulas 🧮 Cash Flow positive = 💰 in > 💰out which could be written as 💰 Revenue > Taxes + Marketing spend + Salaries + Overhead We need to scale 💰 revenue to cover salaries and overhead. This means that we will also scale our marketing spend. For this to be profitable, we need 💰revenue per user > 💸 cost of acquiring a new user Let’s dive deeper into 💰revenue per user. 💰revenue per user = % Trial Started (percentage of users that start our free trial) * % Trial to Subscription (percentage of users that don’t cancel the trial) * 🙋♀️ Customer Lifetime Value (CLV) Here, we could dive deeper once again, e.g., the 🙋♀️ CLV (simplified) = Revenue per year / (1 / 🔥 Churn Rate). 🔥 Churn Rate is the percentage of users that cancel their subscription. Decreasing the yearly churn rate from 70% to 55% would increase the 💰revenue per user by 26%. This is where the thought of “it is like a game” comes into play. Changing one factor down the line has a significant influence on the overall result. Let’s look at the 💸 cost of acquiring a new user. Here, we can go as deep as we like too, but we will keep it simple. 💸cost of acquiring a new user = ⚠️ Cost per click on our Ad (leads potential users to our app store page) * 📱 App Store Page Conversion Rate. This implies that doubling the📱 App Store Page Conversion Rate halves the 💸 cost of acquiring a new user. Thinking about your business that way gives you MANY variables that have significant influence. As an early-stage startup, we try to focus on those that are flexible and easy to change, such as the📱 App Store Page Conversion Rate, which was behind industry benchmarks until recently. I will provide a series of the most important KPIs for us and how we intend to improve them in the next couple of weeks 🚀"
