Because it was my top option.\n\n0:27 And then they were like, here goes some scholarships\n\n0:29 and I was like, yes! I was so happy and grateful.\n\n0:33 It really lifted that weight off my shoulders of even being able to attend college in the first place,\n\n0:37 so the tuition guarantee is actually what made that possible.\n\n0:40 Oh man, it's impacted me a lot.\n\n0:44 When I tell you this took a major weight off me. I can go through like my classes\n\n0:50 not even worrying about, how am I going to get this?\n\n0:52 When they talk about bills I'm like, I don't have to worry about it, it's all paid for.\n\n0:55 And all I have to do is go to my classes and do well.\n\n0:59 One thing I'd encourage anyone to do is\n\n1:01 don't be afraid to ask questions, don't be afraid to contact the school's financial aid office.\n\n1:05 The most important thing is definitely to fill out the FAFSA.\n\n1:08 My experience here has been, actually the best.\n\n1:12 And I'm not lying to you just because, you know, I'm here talking to you right now.\n\n1:16 But it's been the best ever.\n\n1:18 Don't wait, apply today.\n\n1:21 That's what I did!"
