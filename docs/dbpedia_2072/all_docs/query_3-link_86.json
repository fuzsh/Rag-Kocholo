        "text": "Recently I \"guerilla-installed\" (the second version of) my 2010 concrete poem 'Six Signs' in the market opposite the National Taiwan Museum of Fine Arts in Taichung, Taiwan. This series of word-images using illuminated exit signs grew from my experiments with the limits of poetic language at the University of Ulster in the 1990s. There I...

As a (non-theistic) Quaker Chaplain to the University of Sunderland, I have recently explored these issues in a performance series entitled Praying to a Dead God. The title came from an online article discussing the...

Through painting, sculpture, photography, film, music, poetry, dance, performance,...

The show has been put back from 2020 due to the Covid-19 restrictions in force in the UK. It is currently installed but until galleries and museums reopen, on-line only. 3D virtual tour of...

The large 道 (dao) in clerical script was written in China, while the cursive Chinese calligraphy and the uncials were written in the UK. It's my largest ever calligraphy work at about 2 meters long. I practiced... Continue Reading →\n\nIn an effort to improve my cursive calligraphy I have been copying Huai Su's (懷素) (737–799) famous Autobiography (自叙帖). I first copied this while at the LanTing Academy of Calligraphy earlier this year, but thought I would have another attempt. The Autobiography is considered one of the greatest pieces of cursive calligraphy (草書). The original (or... Continue Reading →\n\nMy three month visit to ShaoXing is now over; I learnt a huge amount about Chinese calligraphy through practicing it myself, observing others, and from interviewing expert practitioners. I had classes on cursive scripts, calligraphy creation and on the relation of Chinese painting to calligraphy. As well as learning cursive calligraphy I also wrote some... Continue Reading →\n\nI have been studying the cursive scripts while at the LanTing Academy of Calligraphy: the running script of Mi Fu (米芾), running cursive of Xu Wei (徐渭), cursive of Wang Xi Zhi (王羲之), Wang Duo (王铎) and Huang TingJian (黄庭坚) and crazy cursive of Huai Su (懷素) and Zhang Xu (張旭) , among others. This study can... Continue Reading →"
