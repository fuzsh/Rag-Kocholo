        "text": "Sep 4, 2013 © Ulrich Theobald\n\nHuashi ç«å², also called Mi Haiyue huashi ç±³æµ·å¶½ç«å² or Xiangyang huaxue è¥é½ç«å­¸, is a book on painting written by the great Song-period å® (960-1279) calligrapher Mi Fu ç±³è¾ (1051-1107), courtesy name Yuanzhang å ç« , style Lumen Jushi é¹¿éå± å£«, Xiangyang Manshi è¥é½æ¼«å£« or Haiyue Waishi æµ·å¶½å¤å², also known with the name Mi Nangong ç±³åå®®. The short book on painting is therefore also known with the title Mi Haiyue huashi ç±³æµ·å²³ç«å².\n\nMi Fu hailed from Zhenjiang é®æ±, Jiangsu, where his grandfather had built the Haiyue Studio æµ·å¶½åºµ. About the early life and career of Mi Fu, histories report contradicting matters, but it was clear that he had a talent for poetry and arts. During the Xuanhe reign-period å®£å (1119-1125) of Emperor Huizong å®å¾½å® (r. 1100-1125), Mi was appointed erudite for calligraphy and painting (shuhuaxue boshi æ¸ç«å­¸åå£«) and vice director in the Ministry of Rites (libu yuanwailang ç¦®é¨å¡å¤é), later military prefect (zhijun ç¥è») of Huainan æ·®å. He was very renowned as a calligrapher who mastered the running script (xingshu è¡æ¸) and the \"grass script\" (caoshu èæ¸) as used by ancient masters like Wang Xizhi çç¾²ä¹ (303-361). Mi Fu is one of the four great masters of the Song period (Songdai si da jia å®ä»£åå¤§å®¶), the others being Cai Xiang è¡è¥ (1012-1067), Su Shi èè»¾ (1037-1101) and Huang Tingjian é»åº­å (1045-1105). His teacher in painting was Dong Yuan è£æº, who was a master in depicting withered trees, pines and stones. Mi Fu has also written the books Shushi æ¸å², a history of calligraphy, the Baozhang daifang lu å¯¶ç« å¾ è¨ªé and the Haiyue mingyan æµ·å¶½åè¨. Mi Fu was known as a somewhat eccentric artist and was often called Mi Dian ç±³é¡ \"Topdown Mi\".\n\nHis book Huashi is a critical history of painting from the Wei æ¹é­ (220-265) to the early Song period. It includes biographies of the most important painters and a qualitative rating of their paintings. The book also explains why and how certain paintings can be rated as forgeries, and provides information about the owners and collectors of the most famous paintings. The method of mounting pictures on paper rolls is also described. His book is very important for connoisseurs of the history of painting and is a very reliable source because Mi Fu laid importance on the personal inspection of the paintings he described.\n\nInterestingly enough, his book also includes descriptions of charts on astronomical clocks (huntian tu æ¸¾å¤©å), musical notes, pitch pipes and the twelve musical modes. These do actually not belong into the category of \"red-green\" illustrations (danqing ä¸¹é), i.e. painting, but Mi Fu in this respect imitates Zhang Yanyuan's å¼µå½¥é (early 8th cent.) book Lidai minghua ji æ­·ä»£åç«è¨, where illustrations on the ecliptic of the sun and the moon are to be found. Mi Fu also adds short theoretical discussions on astronomy and music that are, nonetheless, not quite reliable in the scientific sense.\n\nThe Huashi is included in the series Jindai mishu æ´¥é®ç§æ¸, Wangshi shuhua yuan çæ°æ¸ç«è, Shuofu èªªé, Baichuan xuehai ç¾å·å­¸æµ·, Tang-Song congshu åå®å¢æ¸, Hubei xianzheng yishu æ¹åå æ­£éºæ¸, Siku quanshu ååº«å ¨æ¸, Meishu congshu ç¾è¡å¢æ¸ and Hualun congkan ç«è«å¢å.\n\nSources:\n\nDuan Li æ®µè et al.
