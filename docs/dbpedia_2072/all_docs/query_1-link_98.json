        "text": "Welcome to Michigan! New residents can register to vote and must be a resident of their city or township for at least 30 days by Election Day to vote in that election.\n\nIn general, voters do not need a photo ID to register to vote, however, some first-time registrants who register to vote by mail may need to provide some form of ID.\n\nFor more information, visit our first-time voters page.\n\nIf a voter receives a notice of cancellation in the mail for their own voter registration, they can respond to the notification by mail or online in one of the following ways:\n\nRequest their voter registration be canceled.\n\nUpdate their voter registration.\n\nVote or request an absent voter ballot. This will keep a voter’s voter registration active and the record will not be canceled.\n\nDo nothing. By not responding and not voting in upcoming elections, the voter registration will be canceled.\n\nIf an individual’s registration has been canceled but they still want to vote in Michigan, they will need to re-register using one of the registration options listed in the voter registration section. Deadlines for voter registration also apply to individuals re-registering.\n\nMichigan receives information from the Electronic Registration Information Center (ERIC), a bipartisan group of states and Washington, DC, who share voter registration data with each other for the purpose of keeping voter rolls complete, up to date, and accurate.\n\nWhen Michigan receives information through the ERIC program that a voter has registered in another state more recently than their activity in Michigan, the Bureau of Elections uses this as initial information that the voter may have moved. The Bureau sends a notice of cancellation to the voter’s address in Michigan. After the notice is sent, the voter must present the necessary updated documentation to be able to vote. If the voter does not present necessary eligibility documentation, the voter will remain inactive until the cancellation occurs.\n\nIf the voter does not have any voting activity in Michigan by the second even-year federal election following the notice, the voter's Michigan voter registration is canceled.\n\nWhen someone dies, their death record information is sent to the Social Security Administration and added to the Master Death Index. Based on listings of deceased individuals from the Social Security Administration and in the Master Death Index Report, the Michigan Department of State cancels the matching voter registrations.\n\nCounty clerks also inform city or township clerks when they process death records for an individual registered to vote in that city or township. Although the vast majority of these deceased individuals are also identified through the Master Death Index, county clerks quite often can inform municipal clerks before notice arrives from the Michigan Department of State. This is useful in the days leading up to elections, to allow the registrations of voters who become deceased to be canceled more quickly.\n\nCity or Township clerks can also cancel registrations when they have personal knowledge and official documentation that a registered voter has died. For example, the city or township clerk may have an obituary, local death notice, or a written notification from next of kin.\n\nMichigan also receives information from the ERIC program about Michigan voters who have died.\n\nThere are additional inactive registrations in the registered voter database, the Qualified Voter File (QVF), for voters who may have died or moved, but for whom death or residency information was never received by election officials. If an election official receives returned undeliverable mail for these individuals, the registration will be canceled two federal election cycles after the notification is sent unless the voter responds or has voting activity.\n\nMichigan’s list of registered voters is maintained on the Qualified Voter File, a database developed by the state of Michigan and maintained by municipal and county clerks and the Bureau of Elections. The Qualified Voter File contains the names of all individuals registered to vote in Michigan. It also contains the names of individuals with canceled registrations, who are no longer eligible to vote in Michigan. The Qualified Voter File is constantly updated whenever a new voter registers, a voter updates his or her registration information (such as an address), or a voter’s registration is canceled.\n\nVoter registrations are cancelled primarily for one of four reasons:\n\nA voter moves away from their voting jurisdiction.\n\nA voter dies.\n\nA voter registration is identified as a duplicate.\n\nA voter requests that his or her registration be canceled.\n\nLearn more about voter registration procedures\n\nIn Michigan, there is no age, citizenship or residency requirement to run or assist with a voter registration drive.\n\nVoter registration drives may not compensate individuals registering persons to vote based on the total number of persons registered, or the total number of persons registered to vote in a particular political party. Violation of this provision of Michigan law is a felony.\n\nVoter registration drives may not compensate individuals or provide any incentive considered “payment” for registering to vote or for voting. Violation of this provision of Michigan law is a felony.\n\nIndividuals registering persons to vote may not fill in any missing or incomplete information on a registration form themselves.\n\nThere are a few formats for registering voters during a drive, as listed in the Registering to Vote section. The most popular methods for voter registration drives are printed voter registration applications and online voter registration.\n\nPrinted applications are available in several languages, as well as a large print option. Individuals registering persons to vote may not fill in any missing or incomplete information on a registration form themselves. All completed applications must be received by a local clerk’s office, or postmarked if mailed, at least 15 days prior to Election Day. Be sure to look up a voter’s address to ensure the application is sent to the correct clerk’s office.\n\nFor more tips on running a successful voter registration drive, check out these nonpartisan voter registration drive guides:\n\nPlanning a Voter Registration Drive, League of Women Voters\n\nHigh School Voter Registration Training Manual, League of Women Voters\n\nHost a Voter Registration Drive, Rock the Vote\n\nOrganizations interested in registering voters using a customized registration form directly on their website may wish to set up an application programming interface (API). Groups with electronic voter registration programs can now securely connect to the online voter registration system through an API, which allows data to be transferred securely.\n\nOrganizations may also set up a unique URL linking to the state’s online voter registration application. This unique URL will allow organizations to track the number of registrations made through the link.\n\nOrganizations interested in using the API to register voters through the state’s online voter registration portal can do so after completing a security review and working to ensure compatibility with the state’s platform. Those unable to use the API can instead obtain a unique URL to share with those registering to direct them to Michigan’s online voter registration website.\n\nFor more information about the API process, please email Elections@Michigan.gov.\n\nView printable voter registration applications"
