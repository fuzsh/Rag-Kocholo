        "text": "PREVIOUSLY IN THE DA FENG TANG COLLECTION OF ZHANG DAQIAN \"Works of Calligraphy and Paintings of the Da Feng Tang\" was compiled by Zhang Daqian to record his collection of classical paintings, including those by masters in the Song and Yuan dynasties. Devoted to imitating these masterpieces, the young Zhang laid down a solid foundation to become a master in his own right in later years. These two paintings are both marked with the studio seal of the Da Feng Tang, one having the master's colophon. Having been collected by this celebrated painter and distinguished connoisseur, the paintings are of exceptional value owing to the history of this collection.\n\nMI FU (ATTRIBUTED TO, 1051-1107)\n\nHills among Clouds"
