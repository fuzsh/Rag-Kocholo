        "text": "In China, painting, poetry and calligraphy were the dream team of art: the ''three perfections,'' they were called. Any truly evolved person was adept at each. And discussion about any of them was framed in the same terms: rhythm, touch, tone, spiritual energy.\n\nAn eloquent exhibition titled ''The Chinese Painter as Poet'' at the China Institute Gallery examines this three-way partnership through some four dozen paintings, several of them of the very first rank, dating from the Song dynasty (960-1279) through the 20th century.\n\nSome of the pieces are based on poetic themes, but don't include words. Others have verses of popular poems, like Tao Qian's ''Peach Blossom Spring,'' that gentle requiem for a lost Arcadia, written on their surface. In still others, and there are many of these, the artist has inscribed his own poem directly onto the painting as the final touch in a virtuoso multimedia performance.\n\nEven integrated in a single work, though, the three media had hierarchical implications, with calligraphy often on top. Writing, after all, gave poetry its visibility and permanence. And in Confucian thinking, which valued words above everything, any ink-and-brush painting worth its salt was based on calligraphy. The influential control-freak theoretician Zhao Mengfu (1254-1322) insisted on this.\n\nBoth forms used the same tools and shared a ''palette'' of tonal nuance. Because calligraphy had distant roots in pictographs distilled from natural forms, both writing and painting were thought to be hardwired to nature itself: its energy flowed from the body, through the brush and into the ink. The resulting strokes and lines were like a polygraph readout of the soul, revealing its moral strengths and exposing its disharmonies.\n\nPoetry, which was to many the art of arts, was comparable as a moral instrument; natural vitality coursed through it like sap through a tree. When it merged with writing and painting, an aesthetic force field was set up. And this is the magnetic terrain explored in the China Institute show, which has been organized by Jonathan Chaves, professor of East Asian language and literature at George Washington University.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
