        "text": "A rectangular off-white scroll depicting a tall rock form to the left with a man looking up at it from the right. The rock is irregularly shaped and has dark, jagged lines that show texture throughout it. The man is wearing a blue robe and has his hands raised together toward the rock. He has a black hat and holds a white rectangular object in his hands. There are small mountains in the background. The scroll has much calligraphy writing in Chinese at the top. There are three red, square Chinese symbols among the writing."
