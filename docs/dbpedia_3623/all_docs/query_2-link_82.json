        "text": "Say that the British and French did not abandon the Greeks and Armenians and that the Turkish War of Independence was a decisive loss for the Turks. What kinds of republics would arise? An independent Pontic Republic, an Armenian-Pontic confederation, or even a new \"Greek Empire\"?\n\nFirst off welcome!\n\nYou're fairly new so I don't blame you for not knowing that the dismemberment of Turkey following WWI is a bit of a dead horse topic on these forums. In fact your question is perfectly valid and was a fairly common one. If you want to read a more detailed discussion of what I'm about to explain use the Search function and be prepared to wade through a great deal of text.\n\nUnfortunately the scenario you posit is fairly unrealistic for several reasons. Mainly due to the fact that Turkey at this point in time is MUCH more powerful and numerous than any of it's neighbors especially Armenia and Greece. Far from being defeated, it's armed forces following the war were probably among the strongest in the region at the end of WWI.\n\nThese facts necessitate the intervention of Britain and France to make anything resembling the Treaty of Sevres stick. However the problem lies in the fact that it's the inter-war period. Britain and France have bled themselves white in the fields of Flanders, both in terms of manpower and financial resources. They're in no way shape or form ready or willing to mount an expensive campaign on the other side of Europe for no perceived direct gain. Italy is much weaker at this time than either Britain or France, and is affected (to a lesser extent) by the same factors of war weariness and financial exhaustion. These factors would all contribute to the Western Allies' abandonment of the Turkish situation in the Inter-war period, and settling for their gains in the Middle east.\n\nFurther complicating matters is the fact that the territory ceded to Greece and Armenia was hardly uniformly Greek and Armenian and in fact had a large Turkish population that resisted their rule initially and would prove problematic in the long run.\n\nIn order to have a successful partition of the Ottoman Empire and to an extent Turkey, you're going to need a Point of Divergence much earlier than WWI, thus avoiding the conflict (as we know it) all together. Perhaps an option would be to have the 1st Balkan War somehow spiral out of control into a larger conflict, bringing in Britain, France, and Russia on the sides of the Baltic states against the Ottoman Empire and her allies in Austria-Hungary and Germany?\n\nEven then, I'm not sure how long it would stick...\n\nPerhaps an option would be to have the 1st Balkan War somehow spiral out of control into a larger conflict, bringing in Britain, France, and Russia on the sides of the Baltic states against the Ottoman Empire and her allies in Austria-Hungary and Germany?\n\nJust a quip on the proposed PoD, since I discussed the scenario at some length sometime ago. A WWI spiraling out of the 1st Balkan War is quite doable.\n\nHowever, it is bad news for the Entente, since it most likely involves Serbia getting its head swelled (more than usual, anyway) and refusing to quit when Austria and Italy warn it off Albania, perhaps because Russian diplomacy ITTL is experiencing a belligerant phase. Now, preventing Serbian expansion in the Western Balkans was one of the few issues on which Austrian and Italian strategic interests really aligned. Italy is totally going to stick with the Triple Alliance on this casus belli. Let's say that Serbia evades Austro-Italian ultimatum, both powers declare war, war expands to Germany, Russia, France, and Britain by an event chain much like OTL WWI. With German mediation, Italy and Turkey hastily bury the hatchet with a peace of compromise (most likely, Italy keeps Libya and returns Dodecaneso) and switch to being allies in the CPs coalition (Italy is promised Nice, Savoy, Corsica, Tunisia, and French Somaliland, Turkey is promised Cyprus, Aegean islands, gains in the Caucasus). Bulgaria most likely decides to backstab its temporary uneasy allies and long-time rival Serbia and lesser rival Greece and switches to the CPs like OTL. Romania sides with the Entente, hoping for gains from Austria and Bulgaria.\n\nCPs: Germany, Austria-Hungary, Italy, Turkey, Bulgaria.\n\nEntente: Britain, France, Russia, Serbia, Greece, Romania.\n\nAll from the start.\n\nSerbia and Greece are encircled by the CPs and swiftly crushed, then the CPs armies turn and steamroll Romania. The Balkans are a CPs playground, France narrowly survives Schliffen but is soon hammered on by the German-Italians and starved for manpower by an overlong Western Front, which sucks in the bulk of British forces too, otherwise dispersed among many fronts. Russia staggers from the German-Austro-Turkish onslaught. Germany sees victory close in sight enough to drop unrestricted submarine warfare for good the first time neutral America makes unhappy rumors. I would bet my savings on the CPs in the scenario.\n\nIn order to have a successful partition of the Ottoman Empire and to an extent Turkey, you're going to need a Point of Divergence much earlier than WWI, thus avoiding the conflict (as we know it) all together.

Romania sides with the Entente, hoping for gains from Austria and Bulgaria.\n\nJust a question (that i should have asked in the thread i think your talking about ), why would Bulgaria have reason to backstab in this scenerio? Serbia looking towards Albania instead of Macedonia means that that isnt a problem for them. And Russia still has the illusion of a great and tough empire (reality might be different), if they already got most of the world fighting anyways then no international condemnation if they head towards Istanbul.\n\nOn the other hand, Serbia would still be screwed, as its too tired of fighting the Ottomans to fight against Austria. Their only hope would be Russia, and we know how well relying on Russia goes.\n\nJust a question (that i should have asked in the thread i think your talking about ), why would Bulgaria have reason to backstab in this scenerio?

So if they switch to the CPs, they can always expect to gain more and get their conquests secured by a treaty with Turkey guaranteed by the other CPs, Moreover, among the Balka powers, they were the most pro-CPs. So even if they don't join the CPs immediately, we can expect that they switch to neutrality once they see the mess that Serbian ambitions have raised up and they have no reason to fight for. They later re-enter war as IOTL, for more or less the same reasons. Ditto for Romania. Greece is a wild card here, it could go any way, cling to the Entente or switch to neutrality, depending on how their political situation plays out. Serbia is of course at the center of the storm, the CPs hate its guts, it is stuck hoping in the fortunes of the Entente.\n\nAn aside note: although Britain is still going to make a huge propaganda ploy of the fictional \"Rape of Belgium\", American feelings are going to head more towards true neutrality to begin with ITTL, since Italo-Americans shall join German-Americans in pro-CP sympathies, and Pan-Slav Entente expansionistic ambitions shall look more clearly as the cause of the war.\n\nOn the other hand, Serbia would still be screwed, as its too tired of fighting the Ottomans to fight against Austria.\n\nAnd Italy. They declared war on Serbia too from the start, so they are totally going to deploy an expeditionary corps in Albania and start fighting their way towards Belgrad."
