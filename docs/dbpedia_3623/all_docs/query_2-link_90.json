        "text": "I am originally Greek and I live abroad (Romania, Spain, India, US) since 2008 yet in our two national days 28th October and 25th of March, I feel the need to read again about the achievements of my ancestors, reflect upon them and get inspired to move forward.\n\nEven Greek civilization exists for more than 3,000 years (see below) today is an Important day for all the Greeks across the world.\n\nThe Greek War of Independence, also known as the Greek Revolution was a successful war of independence waged by Greek revolutionaries against the Ottoman Empire between 1821 and 1830.\n\nThe insurrection was planned for 25 March 1821 (on the Julian Calendar), the Orthodox Christian Feast of the Annunciation, namely the visit of the archangel Gabriel to the Virgin Mary, during which he informed her that she would be the mother of Jesus Christ, the Son of God.\n\nHowever, the plans of Filiki Eteria were discovered by the Ottoman authorities, forcing the revolution to start earlier. The first revolt began on 6 March/21 February 1821 in the Danubian Principalities, but it was soon put down by the Ottomans. The events in the north urged the Greeks in the Peloponnese into action and on 17 March 1821, the Maniots were first to declare war. In September 1821, the Greeks under the leadership of Theodoros Kolokotronis captured Tripolitsa. Revolts in Crete, Macedonia, and Central Greece broke out, but were eventually suppressed. Meanwhile, makeshift Greek fleets achieved success against the Ottoman navy in the Aegean Sea and prevented Ottoman reinforcements from arriving by sea.\n\nTensions soon developed among different Greek factions, leading to two consecutive civil wars. The Ottoman Sultan called in his vassal Muhammad Ali of Egypt, who agreed to send his son Ibrahim Pasha to Greece with an army to suppress the revolt in return for territorial gains. Ibrahim landed in the Peloponnese in February 1825 and brought most of the peninsula under Egyptian control by the end of that year. The town of Missolonghi fell in April 1826 after a year-long siege by the Turks. Despite a failed invasion of Mani, Athens also fell and the revolution looked all but lost.\n\nAt that point, the three Great powers—Russia, Britain and France—decided to intervene, sending their naval squadrons to Greece in 1827. Following news that the combined Ottoman–Egyptian fleet was going to attack the island of Hydra, the allied European fleets intercepted the Ottoman navy at Navarino. After a tense week-long standoff, the Battle of Navarino led to the destruction of the Ottoman–Egyptian fleet and turned the tide in favor of the revolutionaries. In 1828 the Egyptian army withdrew under pressure of a French expeditionary force. The Ottoman garrisons in the Peloponnese surrendered, and the Greek revolutionaries proceeded to retake central Greece. Russia invaded the Ottoman Empire and forced it to accept Greek autonomy in the Treaty of Adrianople (1829). After nine years of war, Greece was finally recognized as an independent state under the London Protocol of February 1830. Further negotiations in 1832 led to the London Conference and the Treaty of Constantinople;\n\nI am not historian and I do not want to deep dive to each and every battle of those 9 years.\n\nThe reason, I am writing and sharing this article is to inspire entrepreneurs achieve more. By reflecting on past events, we can assess better the present and thereby we can get energy and clarity for the future.\n\nLesson 1:\n\nMark the date; even legally by February 1830 (London Protocol), Greece was recognized an independent state, we celebrate it 25th of March 1821. Why? Because the most important thing as a tech entrepreneur is to get started / launched.\n\nBe Decisive and Committed.\n\nLesson 2:\n\nThe War of Independence was a series of planned & unplanned events. It’s not just a battle, there are many battles to make your efforts worth; you need to exert herculean efforts; even if you feel that you are winning unexpected things can pop up and can derail you.\n\nBe Prepared and Resilient.\n\nLesson 3:\n\nThe Greek War of Independence had a very powerful purpose; Freedom or Death. This was spelled across the Greeks who fought with the Ottomans and this kept them engaged and motivated to sacrifice everything they had for a free land.\n\nHence, as a startup founder, find the Massive Transformational Purpose that resonates to you and go out to change the world.\n\nLesson 4:\n\nThe Greek War of Independence had no a leading figure, but many empowered male (T. Kolokotronis, G. Karaiskakis, O. Androutsos, C. Canaris, A. Diakos) and female leaders (Mpoumpoulina Laskarina and Manto Mavrogenous) that fought fearlessly the opponent; no egos; no titles; all of them were heroes and heroines.\n\nBe Empowered and Empower others to lead something bigger than you.\n\nLesson 5:\n\nOttomans had huge army compared with Greece and any kind of resistance for 400 years was heavily penalized. So, maybe you seem David against Goliath and you feel discouraged to play against the giants; yet focus on the things you can do better and hustle day in and day out for years.\n\nBe Fearless and Hustle\n\nLesson 6:\n\nAs per above, three Great powers—Russia, Britain and France—helped us deal with Ottomans by sending their naval squadrons. So if you do not find the resources in your country, network with strong players outside of your startup ecosystem (Call it London, Berlin, Tel Aviv) share your weak points and ask for help."
