        "text": "Early U.S. Consulates in Romania, .\n\nThe first U.S. Consul was appointed to Romania while it was still an autonomous part of the Ottoman Empire. Louis J. Czapkay, a native of Hungary but a resident of California, was appointed to Bucharest on June 20, 1866. He served from May 1, 1867 to February 1869.\n\nHis successor, Benjamin Franklin Peixotto, was appointed June 29, 1870, as an expression of U.S. concern with the status of Romania’s Jewish community, which was denied citizenship and subject to persecution. Peixotto, a San Francisco lawyer and a former president of B’nai B’rith, was financially supported by a consortium of American, British, and French Jews since there was little American commerce with Romania. His activities involved not only remonstrating on behalf of Romania’s Jewish community, but establishing schools and cultural societies. He served from February 20, 1871 to June 18, 1876. The consulate was abolished that September.\n\nEstablishment of Diplomatic Relations, .\n\nEugene Schuyler was the first U.S. diplomatic representative to Romania. He was appointed Diplomatic Agent and Consul General on June 11, 1880. The Romanian Foreign Ministry indicated on August 13 that it was willing to enter into provisional relations with the U.S. Legation. Schuyler delivered his credentials on December 14, 1880. He was promoted to Chargé d’Affaires and Consul General on December 21, 1880, and presented his new credentials on January 25, 1881. Schuyler was reaccredited when Romania became a kingdom, presenting his new credentials on May 16, 1881.\n\nEstablishment of American Legation in Bucharest, .\n\nSchuyler was promoted to Minister Resident and Consul General on July 7, 1882, and presented his new credentials on September 8, 1882. However, he was also accredited to Greece and Serbia and moved his residence to Athens. Schuyler presented his recall on September 7, 1884.\n\nUntil 1921, no U.S. Minister was commissioned solely to Romania. From 1885 to 1905, their commissions were to Greece, Romania, and Serbia, being resident at Athens. John B. Jackson (1902-05) was also commissioned as Diplomatic Agent in Bulgaria in 1903. From 1905 to 1911, U.S. Ministers to Romania were also commissioned to Serbia but were resident in Bucharest. From 1907 to 1910 they were also commissioned as Diplomatic Agents in Bulgaria. John R. Carter (1909-1911) was appointed Minister to Bulgaria in 1910. From 1911 to 1918, the U.S. Minister to Romania was also accredited to Serbia and Bulgaria.\n\nPeter Augustus Jay was the first U.S. Minister to be commissioned exclusively to Romania. He was appointed April 18, 1921, presented his credentials on June 30, and served until May 9, 1925."
