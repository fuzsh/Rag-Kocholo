        "text": "More than 200 years after the 1821 Greek War of Independence, the experience of Greece's national liberation continues to demand for a critical assessment of its nature and significance. Though sometimes referred to as the first armed conflict that established the independence of a modern nation state, the struggle was fraught with so many conflicting political interests and so many incidents of both atrocity and heroism that no simple definition or explanation is possible. Whether we prefer to call it a war, a revolution or an insurrection, or whether we consider its political context more regional than national, or its causes more economic than religious, the conflict remains a challenging and often bewildering object of historical study. While the combat itself takes place in the Balkans and in the waters of the Ionian and Aegean seas, from Alexander Ypsilanti’s crossing of the Pruth in February 1821 to the decisive naval Battle of Navarino in October 1827, the struggle for Greek independence begins in 1453 with the fall of Byzantine Constantinople, spans centuries of subjection and assimilation to Ottoman rule, and culminates in the late 18th century with a cultural Greek enlightenment that draws the attention and support of most of Europe. Nevertheless, when the battleships of the European Great Powers finally and unexpectedly destroy the Ottoman fleet in the Bay of Navarino, it is far from clear what had actually been accomplished. The entanglement of ethnic and linguistic communities, the protection of the Great Powers’ commercial interests and the political and sometimes armed conflicts between the Greeks themselves all contributed to the chaotic course of events and continued to plague attempts to form a national government well after the significant fighting had ceased. In spite of these difficulties, the independence of Greece was recognized by all in 1830, and although it labored under the long reign of King Otto, the Great Powers’ chosen regent, in 1864, under a far more democratic monarch and constitution, Greece began to better realize the independence its patriots had sacrificed so much to gain."
