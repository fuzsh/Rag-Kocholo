        "text": "23 August 2024\n\nGAZA Talks about a ceasefire in Gaza appeared to sputter this week, with Israel reportedly insisting on holding on to the Philadelphi corridor along the Egyptian border and reserving the right to resume hostilities after a hostage-prisoner exchange. Meanwhile, the confirmed death toll among Palestinians has climbed above 40,000, with several lethal Israeli strikes this week, while Israeli forces recovered the bodies of six hostages. U.S. President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris spoke with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu Wednesday, reportedly urging him to be more flexible. Crisis Group President & CEO Comfort Ero says the U.S. should start using its leverage with Israel – for example, by withholding some arms transfers – to hasten a ceasefire deal.\n\nLIBYA A dispute between Libya’s two rival governments over who should lead the Central Bank heated up this week amid controversies over irregularities in budget disbursements and oil revenue allocations. The disagreement pits the Tripoli-based cabinet, which sacked the bank’s long-time governor, Siddiq Elkebir, against the east-based parliament, which has stood by him. Crisis Group expert Claudia Gazzini says it was the latest in a series of events that have widened the divide between the two bodies, threatening to undermine Libya’s fragile peace. So far, the situation has not turned violent, but tensions are palpable. It is now even more urgent to resume UN-backed negotiations to unify the country, but the odds of that happening remain low.\n\nUNITED NATIONS The UN Office of the Coordinator for Humanitarian Affairs reported Monday that a record 280 aid workers were killed in armed conflicts around the world in 2023. More than half these deaths occurred in Gaza in the last three months of the year. Crisis Group expert Daniel Forti says the unprecedented toll is partly the consequence of faltering peace efforts. Humanitarian personnel working on the front lines often lack the tacit protection afforded them by active political processes; conflict parties, meanwhile, face fewer consequences when they attack those supplying aid. The UN is the only organisation that can deliver life-saving assistance at scale in war zones. But vital as that work is, it is no substitute for vigorous diplomacy.\n\n9 August 2024\n\nRUSSIA-URKAINE Ukrainian forces staged a surprise incursion into western Russia Tuesday, near the city of Kursk, leading to by far the heaviest fighting on Russian soil since Russia’s all-out invasion of Ukraine in 2022. Moscow said it was pushing the Ukrainians back across the frontier, but at week’s end it appeared that fighting in the Kursk region was still under way. Crisis Group expert Lucian Kim says Ukraine’s objectives are still unclear. For the time being, however, Kyiv has managed to turn the tables on Moscow, exploiting weak border defences and an intelligence failure to strike inside Russia.\n\nSUDAN UNICEF and the World Food Programme confirmed this week that famine has struck Zamzam, a camp sheltering some 500,000 displaced people outside El Fasher in North Darfur, site of some of the heaviest combat between the Sudanese army and paramilitary Rapid Support Forces. The fighting makes it nearly impossible for humanitarian agencies to reach the camp, and both warring parties have been obstructing delivery of vital supplies. The worst situation is in Zamzam, but the World Food Programme warned Thursday that thirteen other areas, including the capital Khartoum, are also at risk of catastrophic hunger. Ceasefire talks in Switzerland could finally convene later this month, but expectations remain low, says Crisis Group expert Alan Boswell. World leaders should demand that both sides allow in food aid now – and end the war.\n\nVENEZUELA Authorities this week widened a crackdown on citizens protesting the result of the 28 July presidential election, which the government says incumbent Nicolás Maduro won by a margin of almost 10 per cent. Maduro’s government has yet to release official tallies proving its claim; by contrast, the opposition and foreign media outlets have presented evidence showing that the main challenger Edmundo González was the victor, as exit polls had indicated. At least 24 demonstrators have been killed in clashes with police, who have also detained over 1,100 people. Opposition figures and independent journalists are among the victims of a massive campaign of “knock, knock” arrests across the country. Maduro has vowed to build new jails to house “another thousand” people. The standoff between the government and dissenters looks set to continue, says Crisis Group expert Phil Gunson, while outside parties led by Brazil seek a negotiated solution.\n\n26 July 2024\n\nSUDAN Fighting between the Sudanese army and the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF) continues to exacerbate the country’s humanitarian crisis, as the RSF intensified attacks in the regions of El Gezira, Sennar and Kordofan. According to the UN, the conflict has now displaced at least 10 million civilians and put at least 750,000 at imminent risk of famine-like conditions. The U.S. announced Tuesday that it had invited the warring parties to ceasefire talks in Switzerland scheduled for August. Crisis Group expert Shewit Woldemichael says it is unclear if the talks will proceed, as the army has not yet confirmed its attendance. With the rainy season further disrupting delivery of vital aid to civilians throughout the country, an end to the conflict is urgently needed.\n\nVENEZUELA Venezuelans are set to cast their votes Sunday in a presidential election. While most reputable polls give opposition candidate Edmundo González a large lead, many worry that the government might refuse to accept an opposition victory and instead insist that President Nicolás Maduro remain in power. The opposition candidate chosen in a primary, María Corina Machado, was barred from standing and millions of registered voters, especially in the diaspora, have been disenfranchised. Crisis Group expert Phil Gunson says it is unclear whether the government would countenance defeat. If Maduro does win more votes, on the other hand, the opposition will likely regard the result as illegitimate. Outside actors could help mitigate the risk of post-election violence by facilitating talks between government and opposition to alleviate fears on both sides.\n\nYEMEN Houthi rebels last Friday launched a drone attack on Tel Aviv, killing one person and injuring at least ten others. A day later, Israel launched retaliatory airstrikes on the Red Sea port city of Hodeida, which killed at least nine people and injured over 80. It marks the first direct Israeli attack on Yemen since the Houthis started targeting Israel and commercial shipping in the waters around Yemen with drones and missiles in response to the war in Gaza. Crisis Group expert Ahmed Nagi says the attack on Hodeida has hampered this key port's ability to operate, which could disrupt vital shipments of food and fuel to Yemen. The escalation marks a new phase in the Gaza war’s spillover. The situation could deteriorate further, with the Houthis vowing to hit back and Israel promising to respond in kind.\n\n19 July 2024\n\nBANGLADESH A government crackdown on student protesters intensified this week, with 32 people reportedly killed on 18 July alone. The demonstrators call for scrapping quotas for government jobs, by which almost a third are allocated to descendants of “freedom fighters” from the country’s 1971 war of independence. The government has closed state schools and universities and shut down the internet in a bid to stymie the protests. Crisis Group expert Pierre Prakash says the protests reflect broader tensions in Bangladesh, which has not had a fair election in fifteen years and where Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina’s party, the Awami League, dominates key institutions, including the judiciary and civil service.\n\nDEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC OF CONGO The U.S. Wednesday announced a fifteen-day extension of a humanitarian truce between M23 rebels and government forces intended to allow aid delivery to millions of displaced people across North Kivu province in the country’s east. Crisis Group expert Richard Moncrieff says the truce is welcome, but it has already been broken by skirmishes as the province's armed groups position themselves for further fighting. Neither Rwanda, which has reportedly deployed thousands of troops into North Kivu to back the M23, nor the Congolese government has publicly endorsed the truce, while many Congolese are hostile to what they see as a move to freeze the front line following recent rebel gains.\n\nGAZA As talks for a ceasefire in Gaza continue in Egypt and Qatar, the Israeli military has stepped up attacks throughout the strip, hitting schools and other shelters for displaced Palestinians in areas previously designated as safe zones. An Israeli airstrike on the densely populated al-Mawasi area of Khan Yunis Saturday killed at least 90 people and wounded nearly 300. The Israeli military claimed the attack in al-Mawasi was targeting Mohammed Deif, the head of Hamas’s military wing. Crisis Group expert Tahani Mustafa says the U.S. and other outside actors need to push hard to rein in fighting in Gaza and advance the ceasefire talks. An end to the war is urgently needed to halt the suffering in the strip and avoid further regional escalation.\n\n5 July 2024\n\nDEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC OF CONGO M23 rebels continued their northward advance in North Kivu province over the weekend, taking Kanyabayonga, a town of 60,000 at the junction of major highways in the country’s east. Kanyabayonga lies in Lubero territory, the fourth part of North Kivu the insurgents have entered since resuming their fight with the Congolese army in 2021. Crisis Group experts Richard Moncrieff and Onesphore Sematumba say the M23’s push outside its previous strongholds may lead to frictions with other armed groups in the troubled province. Alternatively, the M23 may be seeking allies among these factions, in addition to the support it already has from neighbouring Rwanda. This latter possibility would deeply worry the Congolese authorities.\n\nISRAEL-LEBANON An Israeli airstrike Wednesday killed a Hizbollah commander, Muhammad Nasser, near Tyre in southern Lebanon. Israel said Nasser headed a unit that has been firing at Israel in the clashes that have been steadily mounting since shortly after the 7 October 2023 Hamas attacks and the subsequent Israeli military campaign in Gaza. In retaliation, the Shiite militia has so far launched 200 rockets and twenty drones at Israeli military bases, killing a soldier in the Golan Heights. Most of the projectiles have been intercepted. Reaching a Gaza ceasefire is crucial to stopping these exchanges, say Crisis Group experts David Wood and Mairav Zonszein, but as that seems unlikely for now, diplomats should keep urging restraint on both sides – lest either one trigger a disastrous escalation.\n\nMYANMAR Fighting intensified this week in Rakhine State, on the border with Bangladesh, as the rebel Arakan Army closed in on Maungdaw, the last major town under the Myanmar military’s control in the state’s north. The Arakan Army, an ethnic Rakhine group, has stepped up its campaign against the military since the 2021 coup. Should it capture Maungdaw, as appears probable, it will hold the entirety of the areas abutting Bangladesh, including those from which Rohingya fled in 2016-2017. Crisis Group expert Tom Kean says clashes between the Arakan Army and the Myanmar military will likely push more Rohingya to leave, though Dhaka is refusing to accept any new refugees.\n\n28 June 2024\n\nBOLIVIA Police on Wednesday arrested the former commander of the Bolivian army, Juan José Zúñiga, after he spearheaded what the government called an attempted coup. The incident involved military units occupying the main square in the capital La Paz and storming the government palace. President Luis Arce called on the public to mobilise before naming a new military high command who ordered the soldiers to stand down. After being arrested, Zúñiga alleged without evidence that Arce had orchestrated the assault to gain popularity. Crisis Group expert Glaeldys González Calanche says the true cause of the events remains unclear. But they underscore the government’s instability and the political tensions that are likely to persist in the run-up to the 2025 presidential election.\n\nHAITI After months of delay, Kenya on Tuesday deployed 200 police officers and additional support staff to Haiti, the first contingent of a larger UN-backed mission of around 2,500 officers from various countries. The Kenya-led mission aims to help Haitian police restore order in the country and regain control of the capital Port-au-Prince, an estimated 80 per cent of which is under the rule of criminal gangs. Crisis Group expert Diego Da Rin says Haitians have high expectations for the force, hoping it will improve security and allow for a return to a more normal life. But they are also wary of possible violent resistance from the gangs, which have been coordinating attacks. How the mission conducts its first operations will determine its chances of success.\n\nRUSSIA Militants orchestrated two attacks in the cities of Derbent and Makhachkala in the Russian republic of Dagestan on Sunday, targeting a synagogue, several churches and a police station. The six attackers, who included close relatives of current and former local elites, including two sons of a Dagestan official, killed sixteen police officers and a priest. No organisation has officially claimed responsibility, though the perpetrators were reportedly jihadist sympathisers. Crisis Group expert Jerome Drevon says the absence of a claim of responsibility suggests the assailants had no direct connection to a larger Islamist militant group active in Russia. But the nature of the attacks and the coordination in two cities suggest a certain level of sophistication.\n\n21 June 2024\n\nCENTRAL AFRICAN REPUBLIC As war rages in neighbouring Sudan, the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces are increasingly crossing over into the Central African Republic (CAR), doing business and recruiting fighters from armed groups there. A new UN report also confirms that the Sudanese army is stepping up air raids along the CAR border, heightening the risk of spillover. Crisis Group expert Charles Bouessel says the foreign incursions have greatly exacerbated criminal violence in CAR’s north, especially in the Vakaga prefecture. They could also aggravate the already dire humanitarian situation there as trade is disrupted and hostility rises toward Sudanese refugees perceived as being affiliated with the RSF.\n\nISRAEL-HIZBOLLAH After a week of intensifying cross-border clashes between Israel and Hizbollah and the arrival of U.S. mediator Amos Hochstein in Lebanon, both sides signalled they were prepared to escalate their eight-month violent standoff into full-scale war. Hizbollah on Tuesday published drone footage of the port of Haifa in northern Israel, while the Israeli military claimed it had received approval for a broad offensive in Lebanon. The heightened rhetoric may just be posturing timed with Hochstein’s arrival, but regardless, the conflict between the two long-time adversaries may be reaching a dangerous inflection point. Crisis Group experts David Wood and Mairav Zonszein say a ceasefire in Gaza is imperative for defusing tensions between Israel and Hizbollah. But the U.S. envoy should spare no effort to bring the two sides to a deal of their own.\n\nSOUTH EAST CHINA SEA The Chinese coast guard on Monday searched and seized Philippine vessels on a resupply mission in the South China Sea’s Second Thomas Shoal. The incident, which left one Filipino sailor injured and the vessels damaged, prompted the Philippine military to accuse China of piracy. China blamed the Philippines for the confrontation, denying that its coast guard acted inappropriately. Crisis Group expert Georgi Engelbrecht says this encounter, the most serious this year, could trigger skirmishes between the Philippines and China. It also raises questions about potential U.S. involvement, given that Washington on Tuesday reaffirmed it will aid Manila in case of an armed attack, in line with the two countries’ Mutual Defence Treaty.\n\n14 June 2024\n\nGAZA The Israeli army pressed deeper into Rafah, Gaza’s southernmost city, amid wrangling over the ceasefire proposal announced by U.S. President Joe Biden last week. Biden presented the offer as approved by Israel, but Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has not embraced it, instead insisting that Israel will keep pursuing its war aim of destroying Hamas (albeit without explicitly rejecting the deal, either). Hamas, for its part, has “welcomed” the proposal, as long as it leads to a permanent ceasefire with guarantees, while suggesting unspecified alterations it calls “not significant”. Crisis Group expert Joost Hiltermann says U.S., Egyptian and Qatari mediators must keep pushing to bridge the gaps between the sides, as this offer is the best and most realistic one to date for both. With much of Gaza facing catastrophic hunger, the imperative of ending the war is glaring.\n\nMEXICO A local councilwoman was shot dead last Friday at her home in Guerrero state, bringing the number of politicians killed around this year’s electoral campaign to 39, a record high. Crisis Group expert Falko Ernst says the toll highlights the challenge that criminal violence poses for Claudia Sheinbaum, who will become the country’s first woman president when she is inaugurated on 1 October. Vowing to take outgoing President Andres Manuel López Obrador’s political program to new heights, Sheinbaum won more than twice the votes of her closest rival in the 2 June election. Her MORENA party also secured a hefty parliamentary majority. But organised crime continues to seek sway over the state. Tackling it may well prove Sheinbaum’s toughest test.\n\nPAKISTAN Authorities said the army raided militant hideouts in the north-western Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province’s Lakki Marwat district Monday night, killing eleven militants it held responsible for taking the lives of an army officer and six soldiers with a roadside bomb a day earlier. Crisis Group expert Samina Ahmed says the military has escalated counter-insurgency operations amid months of mounting clashes with bands of Pakistani Taliban who (though the Afghan Taliban deny it) are regularly crossing into the country from Afghanistan. The military did not name the Pakistani Taliban in its initial report on the incident, but it rarely does in such cases. The surge in Pakistani Taliban militancy is straining relations between Islamabad and Kabul.\n\n7 June 2024\n\nHAITI After nearly a month of discussions, the members of Haiti’s transitional presidential council last week appointed Garry Conille, a longtime UN development expert, as prime minister. Conille, who has previously served as prime minister from 2011-2012, is now working with the council members to form a cabinet, the last step before the official installation of a new government. Crisis Group expert Diego Da Rin says Conille and the presidential council should swiftly agree on individuals with sufficient experience and skills needed for key government positions as they face daunting tasks, including working, likely with the support of foreign forces, to loosen the grip of gangs over the capital, reforming the constitution, organising elections and revitalising the economy.\n\nKOREAN PENINSULA South Korea Monday announced the full suspension of a 2018 military agreement with the North and the resumption of frontline military activities. Seoul partly suspended the agreement last November after Pyongyang successfully launched a reconnaissance satellite into orbit. Shortly after, North Korea stated it would no longer be bound by the agreement. Tuesday’s decision followed a series of incidents involving North Korea sending trash-filled balloons over the border last week in response to South Korean activists allegedly floating anti-regime propaganda to the North. Crisis Group expert Chris Green says the prospect of increased military activity along the border inevitably heightens the risk of inter-Korean clashes and raises the prospect of potentially calamitous miscalculation on either side.\n\nLEBANON Clashes between Hizbollah and the Israeli military along the Israel-Lebanon border continued this week. Rockets fired from Lebanon Monday set off large-scale wildfires in northern Israel. A drone swarm launched at an Israeli military position Wednesday killed one soldier and wounded several more. Hizbollah claimed the latest attacks were in response to intensified Israeli strikes on Lebanon. On Wednesday, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Israel was “prepared for a very intense operation” in the north. Crisis Group expert David Wood says absent a ceasefire in Gaza, which Hizbollah has named as a precondition for stopping the attacks, the risk of continued clashes escalating into an all-out war remains high.\n\n31 May 2024\n\nBURKINA FASO A government-organised national conference in the capital Ouagadougou over the weekend agreed to extend military rule by five years. The military leadership had stated earlier that elections, originally scheduled for July, are not a priority, saying the focus should instead be tackling the persisting jihadist violence in the country. Crisis Group expert Mathieu Pellerin says the decision is unlikely to make the transitional government any stronger, but it did allow President Ibrahim Traoré to show his increasingly numerous opponents that he retains support.\n\nGAZA The Israeli military this week expanded its air and ground offensive in the southern city of Rafah. An airstrike near the city Sunday killed at least 45 civilians in a tent camp. Aid agencies have warned that Israel’s operations in Rafah have significantly disrupted already difficult aid deliveries. Meanwhile, Israeli National Security Adviser Tzachi Hanegbi Wednesday stated the war will continue for at least another seven months. Crisis Group experts Mairav Zonszein and Tahani Mustafa say prolonging the war is unlikely to bring Israel closer to its aim of eradicating Hamas but it will deepen the humanitarian catastrophe millions of civilians in Gaza already face. The U.S. and other outside powers urgently need to ramp up pressure for a ceasefire.\n\nSUDAN Sudan’s army this week again rejected calls to return to negotiations with the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF). Fighting between the two sides is intensifying, particularly in El Fasher, the capital of North Darfur, where full-scale combat broke out earlier this month and UN agencies are warning of an increasingly dire humanitarian crisis. Crisis Group expert Shewit Woldemichael says external powers must redouble their efforts to stop the hostilities and bring the warring parties back to the table. They must also deliver crucial humanitarian aid to those in need, ensure accountability for those who target civilians and sustain pressure on outside actors perpetuating the conflict.\n\n24 May 2024\n\nCOLOMBIA Splinter groups of the former FARC insurgency, known as EMC, launched coordinated attacks Monday on police in four towns in western Colombia, leaving two officers dead and at least six civilians wounded, three of them children. It is the latest escalation after a ceasefire between the government and the EMC broke down in March, prompting factions from the Pacific coast to quit peace talks. Crisis Group expert Elizabeth Dickinson says the attacks are indicative of a trend toward fragmentation in Colombia's conflict. Armed groups are increasingly fracturing to focus on local control of territories and illicit economies. This atomisation could expose ordinary Colombians to greater violence, as groups compete over territory, recruit from local communities and use symbolic violence to entrench their rule.\n\nDEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC OF CONGO The Congolese army Sunday announced it had prevented what it called “an attempted military coup” after around 100 armed men attacked several sites in central Kinshasa, including the residence of politician Vital Kamerhe, who has since been named speaker of the National Assembly. At least three people, including the assailants’ alleged leader Christian Malanga, a diaspora opposition figure, died in ensuing shootouts. Up to three U.S. citizens were arrested on the scene. Crisis Group expert Richard Moncrieff says the attacks’ execution was amateurish, suggesting that they were not a serious effort to overthrow the government. Rather, the incident highlights prevailing political instability and could be connected to infighting over lucrative government roles as President Félix Tshisekedi struggles to form a government six months after elections.\n\nPALESTINE Ireland, Norway and Spain announced Wednesday plans to formally recognise Palestine as a state on 28 May. Crisis Group expert Rami Dajani says the recognition signals increasing frustration among European countries about the Gaza war's growing humanitarian toll, lack of progress on a sustainable ceasefire and the Israeli leadership's failure to offer a political strategy for resolving the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. Israel will see the announcement as highly provocative, with the Israeli right hardening its position against the two-state solution. In contrast, the Palestinian Authority and the PLO will see it as a moral victory, especially if more European countries follow suit, and possibly as a way back to an Israeli-Palestinian peace process.\n\n17 May 2024\n\nCHAD Chad’s electoral authority announced Thursday that President Mahamat Déby has won the first round of the presidential election held on 6 May. The absence of credible observers and the way the ballot was organised cast doubt on the official figures. Déby’s main opponent, Succès Masra, claimed fraud and called for annulling the vote. The army then deployed in major cities and authorities arrested dozens of Masra supporters. Masra may take no further action, as the Constitutional Council has rejected his appeal. Crisis Group expert Charles Bouëssel says Déby’s priority should be to organise legislative elections, the first since 2011, to help lay the foundations for genuine national reconciliation.\n\nRUSSIA As Russian troops continued to advance in Ukraine, the Kremlin announced Sunday that Andrei Belousov, a former deputy prime minister and economist, will take over as defence minister from Sergei Shoigu, who will now head the National Security Council. Belousov’s appointment signals that Russia is preparing for a long war, says Crisis Group expert Oleg Ignatov. Belousov has the necessary knowledge and skills to manage Russia’s burgeoning defence budget. He may be more effective than Shoigu in modernising the military for a protracted conflict.\n\nSUDAN A full-scale conflict has erupted in El Fasher, the capital of North Darfur state, pitting the Rapid Support Forces (RSF) against the Sudanese army in alliance with several Darfuri armed groups. The army and armed groups hold the city’s western and central neighbourhoods, which the RSF has under siege from its strongholds in the northern and eastern sectors. Civilians trapped in El Fasher are forced to move around regularly to evade artillery and aerial assaults. Outside the city, ethnically motivated attacks are on the rise, exacerbating the already dire situation. Crisis Group expert Shewit Woldemichael says it is urgent to halt the hostilities to prevent mass civilian casualties, whether from the belligerents’ fire, starvation or disease.\n\n10 May 2024\n\nDEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC OF CONGO Shelling last week killed eighteen internally displaced people and injured over 30 others at four camps outside Goma, the largest city in North Kivu province, where Congolese troops backed by international allies and informal auxiliaries are battling the M23 rebellion. The Congolese government (along with the UN and U.S.) has long accused neighbouring Rwanda of backing the M23, including with troops on the ground. A spokesperson for Kinshasa said a Rwandan unit fired the shells. The U.S. condemned “the attack from the Rwandan Defense Forces and M23 positions” and called on Kigali to punish the parties responsible for the “heinous act”. A Rwandan representative rejected the idea Rwanda was involved in the incident as “ridiculous”. Crisis Group experts Richard Moncrieff and Onesphore Sematumba say civilians are increasingly caught in the crossfire as the fighting in North Kivu draws ever closer to Goma and the camps. Better protection measures are paramount.\n\nGAZA Israel staged several incursions into Rafah, Gaza’s southernmost city, this week after rejecting an Egyptian-Qatari proposal for a phased ceasefire that Hamas had accepted. Over half the strip’s population is jammed into Rafah, with many having fled the destruction to the north. The Israeli operations were smaller in scale than had been feared, but they caused chaos nonetheless, with the army telling Palestinians who have nowhere to go to evacuate parts of the city. The humanitarian emergency in the enclave continued to worsen, as Israel closed two crossings through which some aid had been getting in (later reopening one of them). The U.S. paused a shipment of certain “high-payload munitions” to Israel Wednesday after having urged Israel not to “go into Rafah”. Crisis Group experts Rami Dajani and Tahani Mustafa say outside powers, particularly the U.S., need to keep pushing hard for a ceasefire.\n\nUKRAINE Russia fired more than 70 missiles and armed drones at power plants in seven regions of Ukraine Wednesday, in the largest such attack in weeks. It has bombarded such facilities hundreds of times since launching its all-out invasion in February 2022, in an attempt to rob the Ukrainian defence industry of electricity and wear down civilian morale. Ukrainian forces intercepted about 70 per cent of the projectiles this time around. Crisis Group expert Simon Schlegel says the strikes underscore Kyiv’s need for continuous supply of air defence batteries and ammunition from its Western backers.\n\n3 May 2024\n\nEL SALVADOR On Monday, El Salvador’s congress approved an amendment that allows for constitutional reforms to be discussed and approved by the legislature in just one term, rather than having to wait for a vote in a newly elected legislature. Critics raised concerns that the move further erodes the country’s democratic institutions as it allows President Nayib Bukele and his party to fast-track constitutional changes. Crisis Group expert Renata Segura says more wide-ranging constitutional reforms could follow, which will likely strengthen Bukele’s grip on power as he enters his new term in June.\n\nGAZA-ISRAEL Hamas negotiators in Cairo are weighing a new Egyptian proposal for a ceasefire whose first stage would include a hostage-for-prisoner swap and a six-week pause in hostilities. Hamas, with an eye to its own survival, insists on a permanent end to the war. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu this past week again committed to launch a ground invasion of Rafah with or without a deal. Crisis Group expert Mairav Zonszein says such an offensive would have severe consequences for the Palestinian population, including the more than a million who have sought refuge there; for the remaining Israeli hostages in Gaza; and potentially for Israeli relations with Egypt.\n\nSUDAN U.S. and UN officials have issued warnings regarding a looming conflict in El Fasher, capital of Sudan’s North Darfur state and an important humanitarian hub. El Fasher has remained largely peaceful since a deal was brokered among the army, Darfur armed groups and the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces in April last year. The truce is now shattered, however. Crisis Group expert Shewit Woldemichael says fighting in El Fasher would be devastating for millions, likely triggering a humanitarian catastrophe. Urgent action is required from the U.S. and other concerned parties to facilitate de-escalation, restart ceasefire negotiations and exert increased pressure on external actors supporting Sudan’s warring parties.\n\n26 April 2024\n\nGAZA Palestinian civil defence workers this week discovered hundreds of bodies buried in the ruins of hospitals the Israeli army had destroyed. UN human rights chief Volker Türk called for an independent investigation of the mass graves. Separately, a UN team led by former French Foreign Minister Catherine Colonna released a report vouching for the neutrality of UNRWA, the agency serving Palestinian refugees, twelve of whose staff Israel accused of complicity in the Hamas-led attacks last October. Meanwhile, severe malnutrition and disease continue to spread in the strip, with new warnings of famine in the north. Crisis Group expert Joost Hiltermann says a ceasefire remains of the utmost urgency, along with an enormous, well-coordinated infusion of humanitarian aid. Donors should also restore funding to UNRWA, which is best positioned to distribute assistance.\n\nHAITI A transitional presidential council was sworn in Thursday with heavy police protection amid threats of violence from a top leader of the criminal gangs that have overrun much of the country. Crisis Group expert Diego Da Rin says the council’s installation is an important step toward bringing in the Kenyan-led multinational mission the UN has authorised to help fight the gangs. The body’s first tests will be to appoint one of its nine members as head and then a new prime minister and cabinet. In the meantime, it will need to work out measures for bolstering public safety until the external force can deploy.\n\nU.S.-UKRAINE President Joe Biden signed a $61 billion military aid package for Ukraine Wednesday, after months of contention with Republican members of Congress over continuing U.S. assistance. The bill will enable Washington to deliver artillery and air defence ammunition Kyiv has been urgently requesting to resist Russia’s invasion. Crisis Group experts Olga Oliker and Michael Wahid Hanna say the aid gives Kyiv a chance to fight on, with Russia advancing on the battlefield and launching punishing rocket attacks into Ukraine. But rapid victory is not at hand: Ukraine will need more assistance in the months to come. When relief over the belated Congressional vote recedes, attention in Washington will shift to what other weapons might be sent to Ukraine and what strategy these would be meant to enable.\n\n19 April 2024\n\nCOLOMBIA Negotiations between the government and a group of former FARC rebels known as EMC fell into crisis this week, as more than half the EMC’s regional blocs left talks, confirming a deep split in the organisation. President Gustavo Petro’s administration is grappling with how to proceed but appears intent on escalating military operations against the breakaway factions, which include powerful blocs along the Pacific coast and in the country’s centre. Crisis Group expert Elizabeth Dickinson says the risk of fresh violence is growing, with the dissidents vowing attacks on military installations and police stations, which are often close to buildings like schools and hospitals. Fighting among EMC factions is also possible, particularly in the south-western province of Cauca, where a half-dozen of them are active.\n\nIRAN-ISRAEL Israel struck targets in central Iran early Friday morning in reprisal for the barrage of drones and missiles fired – for the first time ever, from Iran itself – at Israeli territory last weekend. Details are still emerging, but it appears any damage from Israel’s retaliation was limited. Crisis Group experts Ali Vaez and Mairav Zonszein say both sides are downplaying the latest incident amid international pressure to avoid further escalation, even as Iranian officials warned – as Israeli leaders did previously – that the rules of the rivalry are being rewritten with such overt actions. The situation thus remains precarious and unpredictable. Partners of both sides should continue urging restraint.\n\nSUDAN Donors led by the European Union pledged $2.13 billion in humanitarian aid for Sudan at a Paris conference held Monday on the one-year anniversary of the country’s ruinous civil war. The promised money goes some way toward meeting the $2.7 billion goal the UN has set for the year. Both the main belligerents – the army and the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces – have obstructed the delivery of assistance, leaving millions at risk of famine. Crisis Group expert Alan Boswell says the relief pledges are welcome. Donors should expedite transfer of the funds, and outside powers should work with the same energy to broker an end to the fighting, which is the cause of the humanitarian emergency.\n\n12 April 2024\n\nLEBANON A politician’s mysterious murder Sunday has triggered unrest as the months-long cross-border clashes between Hizbollah and Israel continue to escalate. The army said a group of Syrian men killed Pascal Suleiman, a member of Hizbollah’s staunch Christian opponent the Lebanese Forces, after a failed carjacking. The party did not immediately accept this explanation, saying it would consider Suleiman’s murder politically motivated unless proven otherwise. Several politicians argue that the crime highlights the need to reduce Lebanon’s Syrian refugee population, given the suspects’ nationality. Crisis Group expert David Wood says the volatile situation has not only inflamed sectarian tensions but also imperilled Syrian refugees – whom vigilantes have reportedly harassed and violently attacked following Suleiman’s death.\n\nMYANMAR On Wednesday, the Karen National Liberation Army, the oldest armed group in the country, seized the town of Myawaddy on the Thai border, with the help of allied defence forces. Crisis Group expert Richard Horsey says the loss of economically and strategically significant Myawaddy is another humiliating defeat for the military, which has been on the back foot since last October, when ethnic armed groups launched an offensive, Operation 1027, in areas near the Chinese border. The military has been pushed out of many borderlands and is struggling to project power outside the country’s centre, though it retains significant airpower and standoff weaponry. With internal discord increasing, the army appears to be in its most vulnerable position – politically as well as militarily – since independence in 1948.\n\nUKRAINE In late March, Russia resumed its attacks on energy facilities across Ukraine, using a combination of missiles, glide bombs and drones. Ukraine’s thinly stretched air defences are struggling to fend off these complex strikes. Kharkiv, the country’s second-largest city, had to resort to the rolling blackouts familiar from the invasion’s first winter in 2022-2023. A strike destroyed the Tripillia power station in the Kyiv region Wednesday, taking out 8 per cent of Ukraine’s electricity generation capacity in one blow. The warm spring weather cushions the impact for now, but to get ready for next winter, Ukraine needs more air defence systems and a steady flow of interceptors, says Crisis Group expert Simon Schlegel. It also needs to further decentralise power generation so that even massive hits cannot make entire cities go dark.\n\n5 April 2024\n\nECUADOR The number of violent incidents in Ecuador has increased in recent weeks. On 27 March, a prison riot in Guayaquil, fuelled by dissatisfaction with the government, resulted in three deaths. Last weekend alone, at least 80 violent deaths were reported in Guayaquil and other provinces throughout the country. Crisis Group expert Glaeldys González Calanche says the incidents highlight the security forces’ continuing difficulties in trying to control prisons and curtail violence. The situation could deteriorate further as the country approaches the 21 April popular consultation and referendum election, when Ecuadorians will make crucial decisions about security.\n\nIRAN An Israeli strike Monday on an Iranian consular facility in Damascus killed several members of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, including senior commanders who reportedly were overseeing Iranian-backed non-state actors' operations in the Levant. It was the latest and most significant in a series of killings of Iranian military personnel since the Gaza war began, as Israel spars with several groups that it sees Tehran as funding, arming and coordinating. Iran's leadership has vowed revenge, but its options range from risky to potentially calamitous, says Crisis Group expert Ali Vaez. Any direct or indirect retaliation against Israel and/or U.S. interests risks further escalation that could provoke a bigger Middle East confrontation that neither Tehran nor Washington seems to want.\n\nSOMALIA Mogadishu expelled the Ethiopian ambassador Thursday, recalling its own ambassador from Addis Ababa, following a cooperation deal between Ethiopia and Puntland, Somalia’s oldest federal member state. Ethiopian-Somali relations were already rocky due to January’s port deal by which Ethiopia would obtain a naval base in Somaliland, whose declaration of independence Mogadishu rejects. Puntland had announced Sunday that it will cease recognising the federal government and operate outside national structures to protest a constitutional review that the Somali opposition argue is aimed at bolstering President Hassan Sheikh Mohamud’s chances at re-election in 2026. Crisis Group expert Nicolas Delaunay says Puntland's action is likely meant to draw international attention to the review and put pressure on Mogadishu to conduct the process differently.\n\n29 March 2024\n\nHAITI More than two weeks after a meeting convened by Caribbean leaders at which Haiti's main political groups agreed to create a transitional presidential council, the members of this council issued their first statement announcing preparations for their official installation. Despite delays in appointing representatives to the council, its members claimed to have made progress in drafting operational rules for the body and pledged to set up a clear plan to restore public order and democracy. Crisis Group expert Diego Da Rin says Haitian political forces will have to avoid minor disputes to assert the new transitional government’s authority and resume talks with foreign partners to accelerate the deployment of a multinational security mission to clamp down on gang violence and address Haiti's worsening humanitarian crisis.\n\nSOUTH CHINA SEA On 23 March, Chinese vessels blocked a Philippines supply boat headed for the BRP Sierra Madre, a marooned ship on the Second Thomas Shoal in the Spratlys, a disputed archipelago in the South China Sea, hitting the boat with water cannons and injuring three sailors. Beijing said the boat had illegally intruded in Chinese waters, demanding that Manila “immediately stop infringement and provocation”. On Thursday, Philippine President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. struck a defiant posture, announcing a “comprehensive response and countermeasure package”. The incident followed a series of standoffs in recent months that have raised concerns about escalation. Crisis Group expert Georgi Engelbrecht says the worst-case scenario would be a fatality at sea, which would dramatically heighten the stakes in the dispute. Washington has backed Manila diplomatically but faces the increasingly difficult task of supporting its treaty ally while not letting things spiral out of control.\n\nUNITED NATIONS On Monday, the Security Council passed a resolution calling for a ceasefire in Gaza for the first time since the war between Hamas and Israel began. The U.S., which had vetoed previous ceasefire resolutions, abstained (while referring to the resolution as “non-binding”). Crisis Group expert Richard Gowan says Washington’s abstention is a sign of its increasing concern about the length and human costs of Israel’s military campaign as well as its growing impatience with Israel’s leadership, which has remained defiant in the face of calls for restraint and greatly enhanced humanitarian access in Gaza.\n\n22 March 2024\n\nGAZA-ISRAEL The UN-backed Integrated Food Security Phase Classification released a report Monday warning that famine is imminent in northern Gaza. More than one million Palestinians in the strip are expected to face catastrophic levels of food insecurity between March and July, should Israel’s offensive continue and humanitarian aid access remain disrupted. Meanwhile, the Israeli army this week has besieged Al-Shifa Hospital, Gaza’s largest medical complex, along with surrounding neighbourhoods, as the government reaffirmed plans to launch a ground invasion of Rafah. Crisis Group experts Mairav Zonszein and Tahani Mustafa say the U.S. and other stakeholders urgently need to push for a ceasefire, a massive increase in aid and efficient distribution, as the window to avert famine from spreading throughout the strip is rapidly closing and Israel shows no intention of scaling down its offensive.\n\nU.S.-NIGER Niger’s military government announced Saturday an end to its status of forces agreement with Washington, describing the U.S. garrison in the country as \"illegal\". The statement came after members of a high-level U.S. delegation to Niamey reportedly accused Niger's military leaders of making a uranium deal with Iran. The U.S. representatives also raised concerns about Niamey’s relationship with Moscow and its lack of progress toward elections. Crisis Group expert Sarah Harrison says it is still unclear what the statement means for the approximately 650 U.S. troops in Niger. But if they are forced to leave, it will be a major shake-up for U.S. counter-terrorism operations in the Sahel.\n\nVENEZUELA Attorney General Tarek William Saab Wednesday announced the arrest of two campaign staffers of leading opposition candidate María Corina Machado and issued warrants for seven others, including her campaign manager Magalli Meda, accusing them of anti-government conspiracy. In January, Venezuela’s Supreme Court upheld a ban on Machado's candidacy in the presidential election scheduled for 28 July. Crisis Group expert Phil Gunson says the government’s efforts to stymie Machado’s campaign have amplified calls on Washington to reverse sanctions relief for Venezuela, which is set to expire in April. Despite the setbacks, the opposition's best course is to maintain its adherence to the electoral route and not to boycott the polls.\n\n15 March 2024\n\nNIGERIA Armed groups have snatched more than 300 schoolchildren and over 70 villagers in the north-western states of Kaduna and Sokoto over the last seven days. These abductions are part of a decade-old trend in which heavily armed gangs, locally referred to as “bandits”, kidnap thousands of rural residents and highway travellers annually, mostly for ransom. The group that took 287 schoolchildren in Kaduna state last week is demanding about $620,000 as ransom, threatening to kill the children if it does not get the money by 27 March, but the federal government has ruled out payment. Crisis Group expert Nnamdi Obasi says the resurgence of mass abductions underscores the dire need to boost security and curb impunity, while reversing the deepening livelihood and humanitarian crises in the country’s North West zone.\n\nSUDAN Hopes for a Ramadan ceasefire in Sudan’s grinding civil war evaporated Monday as the army made significant gains over the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces, including seizing control of state broadcasting headquarters in the capital Khartoum. The UN Security Council had unanimously called for a ceasefire last Friday, with only Russia abstaining. Crisis Group expert Shewit Woldemichael says the fighting has intensified in several parts of the country, with rumours that former rebel groups that signed a peace agreement with the government in 2020 have joined the battle in the east on the army’s side. A ceasefire is urgent for the Sudanese people, but the movement on the front lines means that mediation is unlikely to succeed until stalemate sets in once more, at least around Khartoum.\n\nU.S.-ISRAEL Press reports this week said President Joe Biden would consider withholding military aid if Israel invades Rafah, the city in southernmost Gaza where most of the strip’s population is now trapped. It is the latest indication of U.S. impatience with Israel’s campaign in Gaza, which Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has said will proceed in Rafah if Israel sees fit. It is unclear if Israeli forces will in fact move into the city, and the White House’s shift in rhetoric may be an attempt to account for pressure from within the Democratic Party, parts of which are increasingly critical of the Biden administration’s pro-Israel approach. In any case, says Crisis Group expert Sarah Harrison, the U.S. should use its leverage to achieve a ceasefire now rather than later. Every day of delay means more lives lost in Gaza.\n\n8 March 2024\n\nGAZA With negotiations about a hostage-for-prisoner swap and a ceasefire reportedly stuck, and Israel continuing its military campaign, Gaza's humanitarian crisis has reached unprecedented levels. The UN estimates that at least a quarter of the strip's 2.2 million residents are \"one step away from famine\". Meanwhile, Israeli restrictions on aid access and a breakdown of public order in Gaza have made relief distribution increasingly difficult. The U.S., Jordan and other countries have been airdropping food, an action humanitarian organisations have declared highly inefficient. In a Thursday evening speech, President Joe Biden said the U.S. will set up a temporary port on the Gaza coastline to deliver more supplies. But absent a ceasefire, say Crisis Group experts Mairav Zonszein and Tahani Mustafa, the trickle of aid making it into Gaza will not stave off the catastrophe millions of Palestinians are facing.\n\nHAITI Gang violence in Haiti has rapidly escalated over the last week, with criminal groups launching coordinated attacks on government buildings and storming prisons, in a bid to overthrow Prime Minister Ariel Henry’s government. The attacks began last week, when Henry went to Nairobi to salvage a UN-backed international mission that would involve the deployment of around 1,000 Kenyan police officers, along with personnel from other countries, to help restore order in Haiti. Henry has been unable to return to the country. Crisis Group expert Diego Da Rin says the international mission now urgently needs to move ahead as Haitian security forces are overwhelmed, and the gangs are inching closer to gaining complete control of the capital Port-au-Prince.\n\nSAHEL Military leaders from Mali, Niger and Burkina Faso Wednesday announced the formation of a joint force to combat jihadist insurgents. This step comes after the three countries formed a mutual defence pact, the Alliance of Sahel States, last September and withdrew from the regional bloc ECOWAS at the end of January. All three countries have struggled to contain jihadist violence, which has worsened significantly in recent years. Crisis Group expert Jean-Hervé Jezequel says rebuilding a regional security approach definitely makes sense, though details of the joint force are unclear. In any case, authorities in the three countries should consider establishing a political track, possibly including talks with some militant groups, as a military-focused approach is unlikely to bring stability to the Sahel in the long run.\n\n1 March 2024\n\nMEXICO Gunmen assassinated two mayoral hopefuls in Maravatío, Michoacán state, Monday. Both were set to run in general elections scheduled for 2 June, the run-up to which has been marred by violence throughout the country. In 2024 alone, 33 political figures, including ten candidates for office, have been killed nationwide. Crisis Group expert Falko Ernst says this year’s polls could be the bloodiest in Mexican history. Insufficient protection measures by the government have let criminal groups shoot it out for institutional influence and public contracts, largely with impunity.\n\nPALESTINE Prime Minister Mohammad Shtayyeh and his government submitted their resignations Monday to President Mahmoud Abbas. In his announcement, Shtayyeh highlighted the “urgent need for Palestinian-Palestinian consensus based on national unity” in light of the war in Gaza and escalating violence in the West Bank and Jerusalem. Crisis Group expert Tahani Mustafa says the cabinet reshuffle is meant in part to appease calls by the U.S. and others for a “revitalised” Palestinian Authority uniting Gaza and the West Bank under a single post-war government, a suggestion that Israel has repeatedly ruled out. Yet continued rule by Abbas and his entourage will militate against factional reconciliation and political renewal, something the fragmented Palestinian scene sorely needs.\n\nSUDAN U.S. Secretary of State Anthony Blinken Monday announced the appointment of Tom Perriello as special envoy for Sudan. In this role, Perriello will be tasked with advancing efforts to end the war between the Sudanese army and the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces. Crisis Group expert Shewit Woldemichael says a special envoy was urgently needed after growing calls for Washington to put more weight behind efforts to resolve the conflict in Sudan. Perriello will have his work cut out as multiple attempts to mediate between the warring parties have yielded few results. The country’s humanitarian crisis continues to worsen after more than ten months of fighting.\n\n23 February 2024\n\nPAKISTAN The Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz and Pakistan Peoples Party announced at midnight Wednesday they would join forces to form a government, following disputed 8 February elections in which, according to provisional results, they finished second and third, respectively. The top vote getter was Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI), the party of imprisoned former Prime Minister Imran Khan, though it did not win enough parliamentary seats to name its own cabinet. PTI supporters, who allege rigging in various locations and insist on a recount, were outraged at the other parties’ preemptive action. Protests are in the offing, says Crisis Group expert Samina Ahmed, and they could turn ugly. Lacking a strong popular mandate, the incoming government will struggle to make hard decisions needed to kickstart a moribund economy and counter rising militant threats.\n\nRWANDA-DR CONGO With M23 rebels threatening Goma, the capital of North Kivu province in the eastern Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), the U.S. put out a statement Sunday calling on the insurgents to stand down amid the worsening violence. The statement also “condemned” what Washington and Kinshasa, along with the UN and others, say is Rwandan support for the M23, including by means of Rwandan troops stationed on Congolese soil. Kigali issued a strongly worded response, accusing Kinshasa of harbouring Rwandan rebels. Crisis Group expert Richard Moncrieff says international stances on Rwanda’s actions in the DRC appear to be hardening somewhat, with the U.S. leading the charge. But concerted pressure on Kigali and Kinshasa will be needed to see the beginnings of a new regional peace deal.\n\nUNITED NATIONS The U.S. vetoed a Security Council resolution tabled by Algeria calling for a ceasefire in Gaza on Tuesday. It also floated its own draft, cautioning against an Israeli offensive in Rafah, the city in southernmost Gaza where over a million civilians are trapped. Crisis Group expert Richard Gowan says the U.S. may have introduced the draft to deflect attention from the veto, which provoked anger worldwide. But Washington is nonetheless signalling for the first time that there are limits to its support for Israel’s campaign at the UN.\n\n16 February 2024\n\nARMENIA-AZERBAIJAN An Azerbaijani attack Tuesday killed four Armenian soldiers along the two countries' heavily militarised border. Baku stated it conducted the attack in response to Armenian provocations at the border earlier this week, which resulted in wounding one of its border guards, a claim Yerevan denied but said it would investigate. This incident ended a period of relative calm following Azerbaijan’s lightning offensive in Nagorno-Karabakh last September. Crisis Group expert Olesya Vartanyan says it deals a blow to the prospect of thawing relations between Baku and Yerevan after talks late last year had yielded progress. Word that the two countries' leaders may meet at this weekend’s Munich Security Conference may suggest they are looking to restore quiet.\n\nDR CONGO South Africa announced Monday the deployment of 2,900 soldiers to the Democratic Republic of Congo as part of the Southern African Development Community (SADC) mission supporting Kinshasa in fighting M23 rebels in the eastern province of North Kivu. Some of these troops have already engaged in combat. Violence is surging in the region, with clashes between the M23 and government forces intensifying around Sake town, forcing thousands to flee to Goma, the provincial capital nearby, and Minova in neighbouring South Kivu. On Thursday, Pretoria announced the first two fatalities among its soldiers. Absent a diplomatic path to end the conflict, says Crisis Group expert Richard Moncrieff, the SADC forces are unlikely to turn the tide.\n\nLEBANON Clashes escalated this week between Israel and Hizbollah, raising fears that their exchange of fire may blow up into full-scale war. On Wednesday, rockets launched from southern Lebanon struck an Israeli military base in Safed, killing a soldier and wounding eight others. Israel retaliated with airstrikes across southern Lebanon, which claimed the lives of a senior Hizbollah commander, two Hizbollah fighters and ten civilians. Crisis Group expert David Wood says serious incidents like this week’s risk propelling the conflict toward a disastrous confrontation – even if both parties seem for now to prefer to avoid that outcome.\n\n9 February 2024\n\nCOLOMBIA Ahead of a UN Security Council visit, Colombia reached an agreement with the ELN, the country's largest remaining insurgency, that will see a bilateral ceasefire extended for another six months and an end to kidnapping for ransom. The ceasefire has reduced clashes between the guerrillas and the state, said Crisis Group expert Elizabeth Dickinson. But more is needed in the coming weeks, including better monitoring of compliance on both sides, to ensure that civilians reap the benefits.\n\nEL SALVADOR Salvadorans headed to the polls on 4 February for presidential and congressional elections, with President Nayib Bukele seeking an unconstitutional immediate re-election. Bukele has proclaimed that he won with an overwhelming majority and world leaders have congratulated him. But a collapse in the tallying means there are still no official results, leading to allegations of fraud aimed at making sure Bukele’s party, Nuevas Ideas, has full control of Congress. Crisis Group expert Pamela Ruiz says Bukele's win was not surprising, given the broad support for his security policy, which has significantly lowered gang violence throughout the country. As manual counts in Congressional votes begin, electoral authorities must ensure transparency, including allowing independent press outlets to broadcast tallies, to put allegations of cheating to rest.\n\nGAZA-ISRAEL Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu Wednesday rejected the terms of a Hamas-proposed ceasefire, saying the military would continue its offensive in Gaza until it achieves “total victory”. He ordered Israeli troops to prepare for a push into Rafah, Gaza’s southernmost city, which has become a last refuge for more than half of the strip’s residents. Crisis Group experts Mairav Zonszein and Tahani Mustafa say the prospect of expanding the ground offensive into Rafah is alarming, leaving Palestinians in Gaza, already suffering a humanitarian catastrophe, with no way to escape the fighting. Even if Israel deals a blow to the militants there, its war aims of eradicating Hamas and freeing the more than 100 hostages still held captive in the strip will likely remain elusive.\n\n2 February 2024\n\nSAHEL The military regimes in Burkina Faso, Mali and Niger announced Sunday they will be leaving ECOWAS, the West African economic bloc. Crisis Group expert Jean-Hervé Jezequel says the move comes as a shock: it shows how deep the rift between the three Sahelian states and other governments has become following the July 2023 coup in Niamey. If the trio of regimes goes on to scrap regional trade and travel agreements, the lives of tens of millions of people will be disrupted. To avoid further escalation, the two sides should start discussions about mitigating the ramifications of this decision as soon as possible.\n\nUNITED STATES An armed drone hit Tower 22, a facility used by the U.S. military in far north-eastern Jordan on the Syrian border, killing three U.S. servicemembers Sunday. It followed a series of strikes and counterstrikes involving the “axis of resistance” – Iran-linked militant groups – and the U.S. military in the Middle East as Israel’s campaign in Gaza continues. The White House said it believes an assemblage of Iraqi groups launched this particular attack, adding that the U.S. response “won’t just be a one-off”. Crisis Group expert Brian Finucane says restraint is advisable, since Washington is not the only actor with a vote on whether the exchanges keep escalating. A ceasefire in Gaza is the best way to make sure they do not.\n\nVENEZUELA Last week, the government-controlled Supreme Court upheld a ban on opposition figure Maria Corina Machado running for office. Machado won an opposition primary in October, making her the main challenger to President Nicolás Maduro in the election due sometime in 2024. The ban threatens the vote’s validity, setting back prospects of an exit from Venezuela’s protracted political and humanitarian crisis. The opposition called it a violation of government commitments under October’s Barbados agreement, which laid out conditions for the polls, while the U.S. announced it would begin reinstating sanctions it had lifted thereafter. But all is not lost, says Crisis Group expert Phil Gunson, as long as the opposition, backed by outside allies, sticks to contesting the election rather than boycotting it.\n\n26 January 2024\n\nISRAEL-GAZA The International Court of Justice on Friday delivered an interim ruling calling on Israel to take steps to prevent genocide in Gaza and allow in humanitarian aid, stopping short of calling for a ceasefire. The ruling came as the Israeli army this week intensified its assault on Gaza, encircling Khan Younis, the second-largest city in the enclave, killing hundreds of Palestinians. On Monday, 24 Israeli soldiers were killed in the deadliest incident for Israel since 7 October. Crisis Group expert Tahani Mustafa says Israel’s military operations in Khan Younis are deepening a humanitarian catastrophe. The Palestinian death toll since the start of the war has now surpassed 26,000.\n\nUKRAINE Russian missiles hit Ukraine’s two largest cities, Kyiv and Kharkiv, killing at least six people on Tuesday. The attacks came two days after Russian-installed authorities in the occupied city of Donetsk claimed Ukrainian artillery had killed at least 26 people in a suburban market. Amid uncertainty about whether Washington and Brussels will make good on their aid pledges, says Crisis Group expert Simon Schlegel, Ukraine will likely shift to a more defensive posture and extend its fortifications along the front lines.\n\nETHIOPIA-SOMALIA Somalia continues to lobby allies to increase pressure on Ethiopia to stop it from following through with a 1 January agreement with Somaliland, whose declaration of independence Mogadishu does not accept. Landlocked Ethiopia signed a memorandum of understanding with Somaliland to lease land on its coast for naval facilities, in exchange for recognition. On Sunday, President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi of Egypt, an Ethiopian rival, vowed to support Somalia in what Mogadishu terms a plot by Addis Ababa to “annex” its territory. Crisis Group expert Omar Mahmood says the development is ratcheting up tensions at a delicate time in the Horn of Africa, threatening continued Ethiopia-Somalia cooperation on crucial matters such as fighting the Al-Shabaab insurgents.\n\n19 January 2024\n\nIRAN Tehran this week launched missiles into Iraq, Syria and Pakistan, striking what it alleged were bases used by groups implicated in attacks in Iran as well as high-profile killings of Iranian and allied commanders outside the country. Baghdad and Islamabad denounced the strikes, with the former rejecting Tehran's claim to have hit an Israeli intelligence-linked site near Erbil and the latter denying Iran's assertion it had targeted militants. On Thursday, Pakistan launched retaliatory strikes on what it claims were separatist militant hideouts in Iran. The brazenness of Iran's actions, says Crisis Group expert Ali Vaez, shows the government is stinging at having suffered successive setbacks. Yet its countermeasures could end up exacerbating risks to Iran’s security while damaging ties with key neighbours.\n\nSUDAN The army Tuesday announced it is suspending its participation in mediation efforts led by the Intergovernmental Authority on Development (IGAD), accusing the East African bloc of violating Sudan’s sovereignty by inviting Mohamed Hamdan Dagalo, leader of its foe the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces to an extraordinary summit in Uganda Thursday to discuss the Sudanese crisis. Crisis Group expert Shewit Woldemichael says the setback for IGAD is another blow to peace efforts, after separate talks between the warring parties in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia broke down last month. World and regional powers need to make a coordinated push for peace, as the conflict is spreading in Sudan’s east, worsening an already dire humanitarian crisis.\n\nTAIWAN On 13 January, Taiwan elected Lai Ching-te as its next president, marking a historic third term for the ruling Democratic Progressive Party. Lai has pledged to follow in the footsteps of his predecessor Tsai Ing-wen, taking a moderate approach toward China, but Beijing has painted Lai as pro-independence. Crisis Group expert Amanda Hsiao says China’s response to Lai’s election has been measured so far, but Beijing could turn up the heat on Taipei around his inauguration in May. To avoid escalation, Beijing should roll back its military pressures on Taiwan, Taipei and Washington should keep signalling commitment to the status quo that has underwritten cross-strait peace and security for decades, and all three parties should clearly communicate their expectations, intentions and concerns in the lead-up to the transition.\n\n12 January 2024\n\nECUADOR A wave of gang violence erupted in Ecuador this week after prominent gang leader Adolfo Macías escaped from prison, prompting riots in jails across the country that spread to nearby cities. On Tuesday, gunmen stormed a TV station, briefly holding hostages while on the air. The same day, President Daniel Noboa declared an “internal armed conflict”, ordering the military to go after 22 criminal gangs he labelled terrorists. Crisis Group expert Glaeldys González Calanche says the government first needs to regain control of prisons as it works to contain the situation, which is likely to escalate further.\n\nGAZA-ISRAEL As Israel continues its offensive in Gaza, U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken travelled to the Middle East this week, where he met with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas. Blinken reiterated calls to protect civilians in Gaza and outlined plans for the strip’s post-war governance led by a \"revitalised\" Palestinian Authority. Crisis Group experts Mairav Zonszein and Tahani Mustafa say Blinken’s visit is unlikely to change the war’s course as Israel’s leadership looks committed to pursuing its objective of dismantling Hamas. Absent U.S. support for a permanent ceasefire, the humanitarian catastrophe in the strip is likely to worsen.\n\nMYANMAR On 4 January, the military’s last remaining base in Laukkaing, capital of the Kokang self-administered zone in northern Shan State on the Chinese border, surrendered to the Myanmar National Democratic Alliance Army, leaving all of the zone under the ethnic armed group’s control. The deal to surrender the city was facilitated by China, without a shot fired. More than 2,300 troops were stationed there at the time. Crisis Group expert Richard Horsey says it is the most significant ground the military has given up in decades, one of a string of humiliating losses across northern Shan in recent weeks that have emboldened its opponents. On 12 January, a ceasefire brokered by China was announced for northern Shan. If it holds, which is not certain, it allows the armed groups the space to consolidate their gains, while preventing even more serious losses for the military.\n\n5 January 2024\n\nETHIOPIA-SOMALILAND Ethiopia announced Monday it has agreed to lease a 20km stretch of Red Sea coastline from neighbouring Somaliland for a naval base. In exchange, Somaliland is to get shares in Ethiopian Airlines. Hargeisa says the deal also includes acknowledgement of Somaliland as a sovereign state, which would make Addis Ababa the first capital to recognise its 1991 declaration of independence from Somalia. Mogadishu reacted furiously, with President Hassan Sheikh Mahamud saying: “Not an inch of Somalia can or will be signed away by anybody”. Crisis Group expert Will Davison says Ethiopia’s commitment to recognising Somaliland appears tentative, meaning the lease may fall through. But for the time being the announcement has ratcheted up tensions in the Horn of Africa, a region already roiled by several conflicts.\n\nIRAN Two bombs shook the city of Kerman Wednesday morning, during ceremonies commemorating Qassem Soleimani, the Revolutionary Guards commander killed in a 2020 U.S. drone strike in Iraq. Authorities said 84 people died in the explosions, while over 200 others were injured. Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei vowed a “harsh response” to what he called the “terrorist attacks”, which were subsequently claimed by Islamic State or ISIS. The government may have little choice but to respond strongly, says Crisis Group expert Ali Vaez, given the high death toll and the bombings’ timing and place. It may retaliate against ISIS in some way and crack down domestically. If Tehran attempts to link the Kerman attack to Israel, it could fuel Middle East tensions that are already combustible with the Gaza war continuing.\n\nLEBANON An Israeli strike Tuesday killed Saleh al-Arouri, deputy chair of Hamas’s political bureau. Crisis Group expert David Wood says the assassination represents a significant escalation of the post-7 October clashes between Israel and Hizbollah – and not just because Hamas is the Shiite party’s ally. It occurred in Beirut’s southern suburbs, where Hizbollah has numerous offices and many of its supporters live, an area far away from the previously accepted conflict zone near the Israeli border. Hizbollah Secretary-General Hassan Nasrallah announced Wednesday that the killing would not “go unpunished”. Fears are mounting that the group will retaliate severely, but it may opt for more restraint, in keeping with its efforts over the past three months to avoid large-scale conflict with Israel.\n\n15 December 2023\n\nDEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC OF CONGO Over 43 million Congolese are set to go to the polls next Wednesday to elect a new president as well as parliamentary, provincial and local representatives. The electoral commission is struggling to deliver voting materials to polling stations, with the government calling for Angolan and UN assistance. Meanwhile, a campaign meeting in Kongo Central province turned violent this week. Crisis Group expert Richard Moncrieff says the authorities seem determined to avoid delaying the elections. Yet thousands of polling stations may not have what they need to function, increasing the chance of disputed results.\n\nGAZA-ISRAEL On Tuesday, the UN General Assembly passed a nonbinding resolution demanding an immediate humanitarian ceasefire in Gaza. The U.S. had vetoed a UN Security Council ceasefire resolution the previous Friday. Crisis Group experts Tahani Mustafa and Mairav Zonszein say the General Assembly vote reflects converging global public opinion regarding the Gaza war, with the U.S. increasingly isolated in its support for Israel. Palestinians in Gaza are facing a humanitarian catastrophe as Israel continues its bombardment amid the collapse of the strip’s health care system and the outbreak of infectious disease. The Gaza death toll now stands at over 18,000.\n\nYEMEN The Houthi rebels have fired missiles at several cargo vessels, after briefly seizing one in November, raising concerns about the security of shipping lanes in the Bab al-Mandab, the strait connecting the Indian Ocean to the Red Sea. The Houthis have signalled their intent to continue these attacks, mostly targeting Israel-bound or Israel-linked commercial ships, as long as Israel continues its war in Gaza. Crisis Group expert Ahmed Nagi says the escalation in the Red Sea threatens to expand the conflict to Yemen. It could also undermine Saudi-Houthi talks aimed at ending Yemen’s own eight-year war.\n\n8 December 2023\n\nGAZA-ISRAEL After a “humanitarian pause” broke down last Friday, Israel’s military pressed its offensive further into southern Gaza this week, while heavy fighting continued in the north as well. On Wednesday, UN Secretary-General António Guterres warned that the humanitarian system in Gaza is on the verge of collapse and, for the first time since 1989, invoked Article 99 of the UN Charter, forcing the Security Council to discuss a course of action. Crisis Group experts Tahani Mustafa and Mairav Zonszein say a ceasefire is urgently needed as millions of Gaza residents are running out of options to escape the war and are at acute risk of disease and starvation.\n\nSUDAN Talks between Sudan’s armed forces and the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF) in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia were suspended indefinitely this week after reportedly reaching a deadlock. After more than seven months of war, the country’s humanitarian situation continues to deteriorate, with millions displaced and over half the population in need of aid amid mounting reports of war crimes. With both parties seemingly bent on military victory, says Crisis Group expert Shewit Woldemichael, the war is likely to spread. Urgent efforts are needed to bring the parties back to the negotiating table before another opportunity to end the war is squandered.\n\nVENEZUELA-GUAYANA In a referendum Sunday, voters in Venezuela approved their country’s claim to the oil-rich Essequibo region in Guyana, rejecting the International Court of Justice’s jurisdiction in the territorial dispute. Two days later, President Nicolás Maduro proposed that parliament pass a bill creating a Venezuelan province in Essequibo and ordered the state oil company to make plans for tapping its hydrocarbon riches. Guyana responded by putting its armed forces on full alert. Crisis Group expert Phil Gunson says Maduro seeks to shore up nationalist support prior to next year’s presidential election with his bellicose rhetoric. Caracas may think twice, however, before acting militarily as it has virtually no international support for its claims, even among its traditional allies.\n\n1 December 2023\n\nCLIMATE Delegates gathered in Dubai Thursday for the 28th annual UN Climate Conference, where peace and security issues appear on the agenda for the first time. The hosts will ask participating nations to sign a Climate, Relief, Recovery and Peace Declaration and to pledge funds in support. Crisis Group expert Andrew Ciacci says the document is an important first step in raising awareness of the inequities war-torn countries face in dealing with climate change. But without concrete financial commitments, the effort will remain largely symbolic.\n\nGAZA-ISRAEL Israel resumed its air and ground operations in the Gaza Strip Friday, after a seven-day “humanitarian pause” it had agreed to with Hamas. It blamed Hamas for the renewed fighting, though both sides had violated the truce. Israeli planes dropped flyers in southern Gaza warning residents to move toward Rafah on the Egyptian border. During the “pause”, Hamas released 110 of the hostages it took in its 7 October attacks on Israel, while Israel freed 240 Palestinians from prison. Israel also allowed vital aid into Gaza, but not in sufficient quantities. Crisis Group experts Tahani Mustafa and Mairav Zonszein say the imperative now, given the scale of the humanitarian catastrophe and human suffering to date, is to pursue a permanent ceasefire.\n\nSIERRA LEONE An unknown number of armed men attacked military barracks, prisons and an armoury in the capital Freetown Sunday. At least twenty people were killed, including thirteen soldiers, while 1,890 prisoners escaped from jail. The government says the attacks were a failed coup attempt. After restoring calm, authorities imposed a nationwide curfew. The incidents came five months after President Julius Maada Bio won re-election amid concerns in the West about the vote’s transparency. Crisis Group expert Rinaldo Depagne says the episode is the latest illustration of a striking years-long trend in West Africa whereby electoral controversies expose the victors to the threat of violent overthrow.\n\n24 November 2023\n\nDR CONGO Presidential candidates kicked off a month-long campaign Sunday. Incumbent President Felix Tshisekedi is seen as the front runner, in part because the opposition did not throw its weight behind a single challenger. The campaign comes amid a surge of fighting in the eastern DRC, where M23 rebels now occupy much of North Kivu province, drawing close to its capital Goma. Crisis Group expert Richard Moncrieff says the election, set for 20 December, faces myriad logistical challenges on top of mounting security concerns. Inflammatory rhetoric from the candidates heightens the risk of electoral violence in urban centres.\n\nGAZA-ISRAEL A four-day humanitarian pause between Israel and Hamas went into effect Friday morning, marking the first break in seven weeks of devastating conflict in Gaza. The Qatari-mediated deal involves the release of at least 50 of the estimated 240 hostages in Gaza in exchange for 150 Palestinians held in Israeli prisons, as well as allowing for more aid to cross into the strip from Egypt. Crisis Group experts Mairav Zonszein and Tahani Mustafa say the temporary truce offers much-needed respite to Palestinians in Gaza suffering shortages of basic necessities after weeks of Israeli bombardment, but it is not nearly enough. All sides should now focus on turning the pause into a permanent ceasefire.\n\nKOREAN PENINSULA Pyongyang launched a satellite into orbit Wednesday after two failed attempts earlier this year. In response, South Korea suspended parts of a five-year-old military agreement with North Korea, vowing to resume aerial surveillance along the border. North Korea, for its part, immediately stated that it would no longer be bound by the agreement at all and announced plans to send more troops and military equipment to the border. Crisis Group expert Chris Green says the reconnaissance satellite will be a technological breakthrough for the North, if it functions as intended, one that markedly raises Pyongyang's surveillance capacity. Meanwhile, the inter-Korean military agreement's collapse is likely to bring the opposing forces into closer proximity, elevating the risk of cross-border clashes.\n\n17 November 2023\n\nGAZA-ISRAEL Israel pushed on with its ground operations in the Gaza Strip for a third week, with the army laying siege to a major hospital it claimed (without yet presenting clear evidence) to be a Hamas command centre. Some 7,000 people are reportedly trapped inside. The humanitarian situation in Gaza is increasingly desperate, with water, food and fuel very hard to find. The death toll among Palestinians is well over 11,000; Israel reports that 50 of its soldiers have been killed. A ceasefire is urgent, say Crisis Group experts Tahani Mustafa and Mairav Zonszein, as is diplomacy to secure the release of the hostages held by Hamas. The signs, however, point to protracted war and even worse conditions for civilians in Gaza.\n\nSUDAN The Rapid Support Forces (RSF) appeared to make major gains against the Sudanese army amid horrific reports of killings of civilians, looting and mass displacement in Darfur. Fighting between the two sides since April has devastated the country. Yet diplomacy has moved at a languid pace, says Crisis Group expert Shewit Woldemichael, with the warring parties waiting months before reconvening for talks in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia three weeks ago. The RSF is now expected to continue its offensive in regions that have been quiet so far. Outside actors should push the parties to reach a durable ceasefire before war engulfs all Sudan.\n\nU.S.-CHINA Presidents Joe Biden and Xi Jinping met in San Francisco Wednesday for the first time in over a year. Crisis Group expert Amanda Hsiao says the most significant outcome is resumption of military-to-military communications, which Beijing had suspended following then-U.S. House of Representatives Speaker Nancy Pelosi’s visit to Taiwan in August 2022. The two leaders made gestures toward lowering the temperature around Taiwan, but actual de-escalation will require more concerted diplomacy and action. The meeting has helped rebuild mutual good-will that, while modest, could serve as a buffer should tensions flare once more.\n\n10 November 2023\n\nAFGHANISTAN-PAKISTAN Pakistan this week continued the forcible deportation of thousands of Afghans after an ultimatum lapsed on 31 October for “illegal foreigners” to leave the country voluntarily. Islamabad cited alleged Afghan militant attacks near the border to justify the decision. The new rules apply to an estimated 1.7 million Afghans who are living in Pakistan without documentation. But millions of others may also be affected. Crisis Group expert Ibraheem Bahiss says Afghan authorities, already struggling to deal with one of the world’s largest humanitarian crises, are not prepared for an influx of returning refugees. Pakistan should urgently reconsider its repatriation policy to avoid further destabilising the region.\n\nGAZA The Israeli army this week continued its bombardment and ground operations inside Gaza, advancing into Gaza City and leading tens of thousands of Gazans to flee south. After a month of war, the death toll in the strip has surpassed 10,000. Meanwhile, the future of governance in Gaza remains unclear. U.S. Secretary of State Anthony Blinken on Wednesday voiced support for the Palestinian Authority in the West Bank taking over the enclave. Israel, for its part, announced plans to manage security in the strip for an indefinite period. Crisis Group expert Tahani Mustafa says neither option looks feasible. In any case, the immediate need is a ceasefire to stave off further devastation and civilian suffering.\n\nMYANMAR Ethnic Kokang and Ta’ang armed groups, along with allied forces, launched an offensive against regime troops last week in northern Shan State. They seized several strategic towns, severed key trade routes to China and overran numerous hilltop bases. Crisis Group expert Richard Horsey says it is a moment of jeopardy for the junta ruling the country since 2021. While the armed groups are not part of the anti-coup resistance, their military success has encouraged opposition attacks in other parts of the country. The regime will want to respond decisively to avoid further emboldening its opponents, likely with serious humanitarian consequences. Regime or military collapse is still a distant prospect, however.\n\n3 November 2023\n\nBANGLADESH Opposition forces including the Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) called a three-day blockade this week, attempting to disrupt road, rail and river transport, following clashes last Saturday between police and BNP protesters that left at least four dead. The BNP is demanding that Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina step down prior to January 2024 elections, so that a technocratic caretaker cabinet can administer the polls. Authorities arrested Mirza Fakhrul Islam Alamgir and other leading BNP figures following last Saturday’s “grand rally”, accusing them of complicity in violent acts. Crisis Group expert Tom Kean says this crackdown has deepened polarisation in the country, lowering the chances of compromise between the parties before the elections and heightening the risk of further loss of life.\n\nGAZA Israel continued its bombardment of the Gaza Strip this week, also staging multiple ground incursions, following Hamas’s attacks on Israel on 7 October. The death toll among Palestinians now tops 9,000, including more than 3,700 children. Crisis Group President and CEO Comfort Ero says world leaders should work urgently to conclude a ceasefire. There is no easy answer for how to deal with Hamas. But, in the long run, levelling much of Gaza, killing thousands of innocent Palestinians and risking regional war will not make Israel safer.\n\nMEXICO Hurricane Otis tore through the Pacific coastal city of Acapulco last week, leaving at least 46 people dead, 58 others missing and residents scrambling to find food and potable water. The storm had grown to category-five strength at unprecedented speed, reducing the time citizens had to prepare for its approach. Authorities are still assessing the extent of the damage. The government’s aid response has been insufficient, says Crisis Group expert Falko Ernst, providing the area’s powerful criminal groups with the opportunity to fill many gaps. In the short term, elements of organised crime could be handing out supplies; in the medium term, they may find it easier to recruit new members from among the ranks of jobless youth, whose prospects for legal employment the hurricane’s effects have also battered.\n\n27 October 2023\n\nDR CONGO Fighting intensified this week between M23 rebels and pro-government forces, shattering a fragile six-month calm, with clashes occurring within 20km of the North Kivu provincial capital, Goma. On Tuesday, Kinshasa accused Rwandan army units of mounting an incursion into North Kivu to support the M23. According to the UN, over 100,000 people have been displaced since battles resumed in early October. Crisis Group expert Onesphore Sematumba says the latest round of combat, coming just weeks before elections slated for 20 December, will compromise the vote in this troubled area, stymie efforts to reach a ceasefire and add to the struggles of the East African Community force that deployed to contain the violence.\n\nISRAEL-GAZA The Israeli army this week conducted multiple ground incursions into northern and central Gaza, claiming to strike a series of Hamas targets in preparation for a wider offensive. Meanwhile, the situation in Gaza continues to deteriorate, with more than a million people displaced and food, water and fuel in short supply as Israeli air and artillery strikes intensified throughout the strip, flattening entire neighbourhoods and causing thousands of civilian casualties. Crisis Group expert Mairav Zonszein says it is unclear whether a ground offensive could dislodge Hamas from Gaza, and even if it were to, what the day after would look like. It would also likely exacerbate the humanitarian crisis in the strip and significantly raise the risk of a regional conflict.\n\nMEXICO A criminal group killed thirteen police officers on Monday in El Papayo, a coastal town north of Acapulco, Guerrero. Two other officers are missing. The ambush was the latest in a string of increasingly aggressive attacks on security forces in this southern Mexican state. Just days prior, the Guerrero state attorney’s office had instructed its personnel to halt all activities due to insecurity. Crisis Group expert Falko Ernst says the government lacks effective strategies for quelling the violence, enabling organised crime to broaden its sway. Rank-and-file police often pay the price. In the past five years, more than 2,000 have lost their lives.\n\n20 October 2023\n\nCOLOMBIA The Colombian government Tuesday signed a three-month ceasefire with a dissident faction of the former Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC), known as the EMC. The accord comes at a crucial moment, just ahead of the 29 October local elections, and includes a provision to ensure the vote moves ahead without armed interference. Unlike past ceasefires, says Crisis Group expert Elizabeth Dickinson, this agreement focuses on civilian protection, including key commitments to safeguard the rights of children, ethnic communities and other vulnerable populations. It is vital that communities start to feel the impact of de-escalation in their daily lives.\n\nIRAQ Iran-backed militias conducted drone strikes Wednesday on the Ain al-Assad and Harir air bases in the Anbar and Erbil provinces, respectively, lightly injuring a number of U.S. soldiers stationed there. The U.S. military reported additional attacks Thursday on its facilities in Iraq and Syria. Angry about U.S. support for Israel in the Gaza war, the Iran-aligned armed groups in Iraq have threatened to keep targeting U.S. assets. Crisis Group expert Lahib Higel, says their attacks are likely to continue.\n\nSOUTH CHINA SEA The Philippine military called out Beijing Sunday for “dangerous and offensive manoeuvres”, saying a Chinese warship cut across the bow of a Philippine vessel near Thitu island, the Philippines' largest outpost in the Spratlys, a disputed archipelago in the South China Sea. Beijing insisted its ship’s actions were “lawful and legitimate”. The incident followed a standoff last month that pitted a Philippine resupply mission against the Chinese coast guard over the Second Thomas Shoal. Crisis Group expert Georgi Engelbrecht says the incident is another reminder that the Sea is full of flashpoints. With Manila becoming more assertive with its own patrols, further escalation may not be a matter of if but when.\n\n13 October 2023\n\nGUATEMALA Indigenous, student and civil society organisations have set up more than 100 roadblocks as part of a growing national strike demanding respect for the 2023 election results. The strike was called by Indigenous authorities, the 48 Cantones of Totonicapán, to compel the resignation of officials who they see as attacking the elections’ integrity, including by casting doubt on Bernardo Arévalo’s victory in the presidential race. The president-elect has denounced these officials’ efforts as a “slow-motion coup”. Crisis Group expert Pamela Ruiz says the protests bespeak widespread indignation. Most have been peaceful, but demonstrators say provocateurs have infiltrated some in attempts to spark violence that would bring a harsh crackdown.\n\nISRAEL-GAZA Israeli troops massed around the Gaza Strip in seeming preparation for a ground invasion, days after Hamas launched its unprecedented assault inside Israel, killing some 1,200 people, many of whom were civilians, and taking numerous hostages. Crisis Group expert Tahani Mustafa says the Hamas attacks were likely a desperate attempt to bring about change in the status quo, a 17-year siege of Gaza that has made the enclave essentially unlivable. Now Israel’s response – intense bombardment, along with cutoffs of electricity, fuel and food supplies, amounting to collective punishment on a massive scale – is creating a humanitarian catastrophe in the coastal strip. On Friday, Israel told the 1.1 million inhabitants of northern Gaza to move south. A ground invasion would doubtless make the situation far worse.\n\nLEBANON-ISRAEL Hizbollah and Israel have been trading occasional fire over the Lebanon-Israel border since Sunday, the Gaza war’s second day. Both sides appear keen to avoid escalation. But an Israeli ground invasion of Gaza could yet pull the Shiite Islamist group into the fray, as could rockets launched at Israel by Palestinian groups in Lebanon that bring Israeli retaliation. Crisis Group expert Heiko Wimmen says a Gaza ceasefire is the only sure way to forestall these scenarios. In the meantime, Hizbollah should impress upon its Palestinian allies, and Western countries upon Israel, that opening a second front is in no one’s interest.\n\n6 October 2023\n\nARMENIA More than 100,000 ethnic Armenians from Nagorno-Karabakh have sought refuge in Armenia following Azerbaijan’s mid-September offensive that ended the enclave’s de facto self-rule. Beyond providing them with food, shelter and health care, says Crisis Group expert Olesya Vartanyan, it is vital to plan for the future. Not only are the new arrivals traumatised by war, but many also speak a dialect that people in Armenia cannot understand. Yerevan will likely require outside aid and expertise to help them integrate. Authorities should take care that programming is gender-responsive, meeting the particular needs of women, children and the elderly.\n\nHAITI The UN Security Council authorised a new multinational mission in Haiti Monday. Crisis Group expert Diego Da Rin says specialised foreign forces, which could deploy within three months, will likely help police reduce the unprecedented ferocity of gang violence in the country as well as ease the flow of humanitarian aid. But it remains crucial that acting Prime Minister Ariel Henry reach an agreement with a broad cross-section of the opposition to form a transitional government with proper checks and balances. In the absence of such an accord, many Haitians may see the mission merely as a means for Henry and his allies to strengthen their hold on power.\n\nTÜRKIYE The Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK) bombed police headquarters in Ankara on Sunday, the first time it has hit the Turkish capital since 2016. The group is likely trying to demonstrate resilience with the attack; it has been under significant pressure from the Turkish military on the battlefield. Ankara retaliated immediately with a wave of arrests inside Türkiye as well as airstrikes on PKK and allied targets in northern Iraq and northern Syria, straining ties with Washington. The U.S. said it shot down an armed Turkish drone Wednesday flying close to its troops in Syria. Ankara denied the drone belonged to the Turkish armed forces. Crisis Group expert Berkay Mandıracı says the four-decade conflict will now likely escalate further with the Turkish military doubling down on trying to weaken the PKK and the latter pushing back.\n\n29 September 2023\n\nKOSOVO Heavily armed Serbs attacked police Sunday in Banjska, a northern Kosovo village, and then occupied a monastery, leading to a day-long standoff. A policeman and three of the assailants were killed. Prime Minister Albin Kurti accused Serbia of backing the attack; Serbian President Aleksandar Vučić denied involvement and blamed Kurti for provocations. Crisis Group expert Marko Prelec says the military-grade weapons seized from the attackers indicate Serbs in northern Kosovo, where they are in the majority, are preparing for a fight. With neither Kurti nor Vučić likely to make unilateral concessions, negotiations are the best bet for averting major escalation.\n\nNIGER French President Emmanuel Macron announced Sunday that France would withdraw its troops from Niger and recall its ambassador. Relations between Paris and Niamey have soured since a junta deposed President Mohamed Bazoum in July. Coup leaders in Niger have tapped into growing anti-French sentiment to shore up popular support, says Crisis Group expert Jean-Hervé Jezequel. But France’s departure from the country also means the military will have a hard time avoiding accountability should it fail to maintain security in the coming period.\n\nYEMEN A drone strike Monday killed three Bahraini soldiers stationed near the Saudi-Yemeni border. The soldiers belonged to the Saudi-led coalition forces fighting the Houthi rebels. Bahrain blamed the Houthis for the attack, while the coalition condemned it, asserting the right to respond. Without acknowledging the strike, the Houthis accused the coalition of breaking the de facto truce, which has largely held after formally lapsing almost a year ago. The incident is concerning in light of recent advances in Houthi-Saudi ceasefire talks, says Crisis Group expert Ahmed Nagi, but neither side appears inclined to escalate.\n\n22 September 2023\n\nDOMINICAN REPUBLIC-HAITI The Dominican Republic last Friday shut its borders with Haiti, escalating a dispute over construction of a canal by farmers on the Haitian side. The canal taps into the Massacre River, which runs along the northern border, to irrigate the drought-stricken Maribaroux plains. The Dominican government claims that digging it violates a 1929 treaty on shared use of the river waters. Crisis Group expert Diego Da Rin says the border closure could significantly harm both countries’ economies at a time when living conditions in Haiti have already deteriorated amid rampant gang violence and rising hunger.\n\nMALI Fresh fighting broke out Sunday between Malian forces and a coalition of Tuareg rebels who claim to have temporarily seized two army bases in Lere, a town in the northern Timbuktu region. Clashes have intensified in recent weeks amid the withdrawal of MINUSMA, the UN stabilisation mission in the country, after ten years of deployment. Neither side stands to benefit from resuming hostilities, says Crisis Group expert Ibrahim Maiga. A return to dialogue is in the best interest of both the Malian state and the rebel groups, which signed a peace agreement with Bamako in 2015.\n\nUNITED NATIONS World leaders attended the UN General Assembly for its annual high-level week in New York. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy spoke to both the Assembly and the UN Security Council, attempting to rally stronger support for Kyiv in fending off Russia’s aggression, but the main theme of the gathering was economic development, says Crisis Group expert Richard Gowan. As Zelenskyy huddled with non-Western leaders, lobbying them to take a harder line against Moscow, Western leaders, including U.S. President Joe Biden, focused on addressing the economic concerns of the so-called Global South.\n\n15 September 2023\n\nCOLOMBIA The government released a new counter-narcotics strategy Saturday, aimed at helping small farmers find alternatives to growing coca as well as improving law enforcement. Days later, the UN reported that Colombia’s coca crop had reached record levels in 2022, helping drive the price down dramatically. Crisis Group expert Elizabeth Dickinson says the government has a unique opportunity to help farmers stop planting coca, thus following through on President Gustavo Petro's promises to shift the focus of anti-drug efforts off the rural poor onto crime bosses.\n\nNORTH KOREA-RUSSIA North Korean leader Kim Jong-un travelled to Russia for unexpected talks Wednesday with President Vladimir Putin. The two affirmed North Korean-Russian friendship but made no concrete announcements. After two failed satellite launches this year, says Crisis Group expert Chris Green, North Korea is likely seeking technological assistance. It may also be hoping that Russia will admit more North Korean workers. Putin accepted an invitation to visit Pyongyang, a sign of closer relations that will unsettle Washington and Seoul. The U.S. threatened additional sanctions on Moscow should the two countries make a deal for North Korea to send weapons to Russia in order to aid its war effort in Ukraine.\n\nSUDAN An airstrike on a market in the c"
