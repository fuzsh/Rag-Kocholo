        "meta_description": "This article analyses how the post-1908 Ottoman Empire is represented in Türk Tarih Kurumu’s historiographical journal Belleten between 1937 and 1950. The post-1908 Ottoman Empire is a marginal topic in Belleten’s first years. When it is addressed at all, it mainly focuses on Mustafa Kemal’s biography and the Turkish War of Independence. While the Constitutional Revolution is positively evaluated, and the Young Turks are partly represented as ideological predecessors to the Kemalists, the authors also use the Second Constitutional Era as a dark contrast against which they can show the Republican reforms and successes more clearly. Aspects of the recent past that relate to the Ottoman state and government institutions are strongly historicized, while simultaneous events relating to Mustafa Kemal’s biography are discursively brought close to the present by using personal memory as a legitimate source. More than half of the authors writing about the recent past hold a political office, indicating an overlap between the political and the historiographical discourse.",

        "text": "2“Kemal was especially interested in history, which could provide a context for his reforms and strengthen the self-image of the republic. The country needed a new history. ” (Foss 2014: 826)\n\n3Historiography in the young Republic of Turkey remains a topic of fascination for scholars of Turkish history. The new state’s politics of history – or, to use Âfet İnan’s terminology: its history revolution – occupies an important space in the Republic’s consolidation process, making history-writing a political act as well as an academic one. The case of early Republican Turkey lends itself to manifold research endeavors investigating the role of history in state-building and national identity formation. Hence, numerous excellent works have appeared on this topic. However, many of these focus on the emergence and implementation of the Türk Tarih Tezi and the meanings of pre-historic narratives for the construction of a Turkish nationalist identity (e.g. Çağaptay 2004; Ersanlı 1996, 2002a; Foss 2014; Millas 2008), or on the depiction of pre-Ottoman history in a broader sense (e.g. Aktürk 2010; Arı 2013; Hendrich 2004). Depictions of more recent historic periods have long been a less popular topic for scholarly investigation: The predominant – albeit often tacit – assumption was that late Ottoman history had to a large extent been disregarded by early Republican historians, who allegedly dismissed this period as decadent and corrupt and thus participated in “the construction of the immediate past as worthless, corrupt, and unredeemable” (Zorlu-Durukan 2006: 158, cited in Danforth 2014: 659; For notable exceptions, see Ersanlı 2002b; Gürpınar 2013; Turan 2014; Zürcher 2012). This is regrettable because, as Doğan Gürpınar succinctly puts it:\n\n“[T]he eccentricities of Kemalist historiography in the 1930s, which constructed a mythical pagan racial utopia circa B.C. 2000 and established a Turkish-centric world history along racial lines, should not be seen as the core and essence of Kemalist historiography. […] [T]he Kemalist strategies that coopt and cope with the Ottoman history […] deserve more scrutiny. The Kemalist historiography, sanctioned by the regime, shaped the contours of the Turkish national imagination not via this eccentric historic imagination, but via more subtle means and discourses.” (Gürpınar 2013: 19)\n\n4In this vein, I will show that closer analysis of early Republican state historiography’s representation of the recent Ottoman past provides us with a vivid and varied picture. Studying the ways in which ruptures and continuities between the Empire and the Republic have been constructed can help us understand the early Republic’s regime of historicity, that is, “the way in which a society considers its past and deals with it” (Hartog 2005: 8), how this conception of the past is linked to imaginations of the present, and how the notions of memory and history relate to each other (Hartog 2015: 16).\n\n5In order to study these questions, I chose Türk Tarih Kurumu (TTK)’s official journal Belleten as a case study. Belleten cannot – and should not – be taken as representative of all of resmî tarih, but it occupies a special place in the Kemalist historiographic discourse. Belleten laid claim to setting the tone for the overall historico-political debate in the consolidating Republic of Turkey – a claim it succeeded to meet to a remarkable degree. This renders the study of Belleten an important element within the larger research field of re-evaluating Republican historiography in the 1930s and 1940s.\n\n6The present article provides an analysis of Belleten’s first 14 volumes (56 issues), published between 1937 and 1950. From within these volumes, I analyze the articles relating to the late Ottoman Empire, that is, the period beginning with the constitutional revolution in 1908 and ending with the demise of the last Ottoman Sultan in November 1922. Naturally, the time frame from 1908 to 1922 is not a monolithic block and should not be thought of as an internally cohesive ‘era’: It includes aspects and episodes as diverse as the direct aftermath of the constitutional revolution, the Young Turk cabinets, the attempt at counterrevolution in April 1909, the Libyan War, the Balkan Wars, the subsequent coup d’état of 1913, the First World War, the armistice era, the occupation of Istanbul and the Anatolian movement, with the post-war Istanbul government as its antagonist and nemesis. Still, in all its diversity, the period from 1908 to 1922 is the last stage of the Ottoman Empire, the revolution of 1908 being widely recognized as a sizeable historical turning point. I choose this period as an analytical category in this article, not because it represents a coherent entity, but because I am interested in analyzing how the authors in Belleten themselves come to terms with this disparate timespan, what episodes, events and actors they choose to highlight, and what implicit periodization we can deduce from their writings. The question is all the more relevant because the timeframe from 1908 to 1922 not only represents the Republic of Turkey’s immediate predecessor regime, but also a very recent past of which some, if not all, the authors have personal recollections. It will be shown that this specific timeframe is represented in Belleten in a highly ambivalent way: as a period that is integrated into a Republican genealogy, but also relegated to a distant past with a negative connotation.\n\n7Defining 1950 as the end of this sample is a deliberate periodization, yet not arbitrary: The goal of the article is to give an impression of the consolidating state historiography in the late 1930s and 1940s. Rather than emphasizing the political power shift of 1950 and its putative impact on historiography, I argue with Gürpınar “that the building blocks of nationalist imagery had been erected by [1950]” and that this year more or less accurately marks the “time when popular history and the scholarly study of history began to diverge” (Gürpınar 2013: vii). Belleten itself, together with journals such as Tarih Vesikaları and Ankara Üniversitesi Dil ve Tarih-Coğrafya Fakültesi Dergisi played an important role in the development of scholarly historiography. Belleten stands out as a particularly worthwhile case study because research and ideology, source criticism and “nationalist imagery” are not separated by “a clear line between popular historiography and academic historiography” (Gürpınar 2013: 17); they exist alongside each other in Belleten. Between 1937 and 1950, Republican historiography reached a more or less stable stance towards the Ottoman past, and could view it from a safe distance: Neither the Empire nor any dynastic opposition posed a political threat to the Turkish state any more (Danforth 2014: 656; Gürpınar 2015: 398).\n\nI. Belleten: The Venue of a Controlled Discourse\n\n8Belleten is a quarterly journal, founded in 1937, which has appeared without interruption ever since. It is issued by Türk Tarih Kurumu, Turkey’s main state-run historical research body. TTK was founded as one of Mustafa Kemal’s top-priority projects in 1931 under the name of Türk Tarihi Tetkik Cemiyeti and acquired its present name in 1935 (Foss 2014: 829–830; İğdemir 1973: 7). TTK was the most important means by which “the Kemalist state attempted to monopolize historical scholarship in the early 1930s and restructured the contours of the national historical imagination” (Gürpınar 2013: 19). It is the Republican successor organization of the Ottoman Târîh-i Osmânî Encümeni (TOE), which had been founded in 1910. However, TTK largely differed from its predecessor institution in its programmatic outlook: Instead of focusing on Ottoman history without integrating it into a larger framework of Turkish history (Kafadar and Karateke 2011: 570–571), TTK put a strong emphasis on the study of a Turkish continuity that spanned millennia by “dedicating itself essentially to prehistory and antiquity, and by conferring disproportionate importance to questions of origins” (Copeaux 1997: 51).\n\n9Belleten was founded “to function as the Turkish equivalent of the European national historical reviews to embody and promote Turkish scholarship (within Kemalist and statist premises)” (Gürpınar 2013: 19). Due to its consistency in publication, Belleten was an important factor in the “gradual but unmistakable institutionalization” (Kafadar and Karateke 2011: 573) of Turkish historiography.\n\nII. Situating the Authors\n\n16Seventeen of the twenty authors are men. The two authors within the sample who are immediately identifiable as female are İnan, who, as the adopted daughter of Mustafa Kemal, assumes an exceptional position, both socially and academically, and the literary scholar Fevziye Abdullah Tansel. In F. Öymen’s case, only the initial of the first name is given, so the gender is not discernible. Because this person is, however, introduced as being a Member of Parliament for Istanbul, it is plausible to conclude that the author is pedagogue Fakihe Öymen, one of Turkey’s first female Members of Parliament, elected in 1935. Thus, probably three out of twenty authors are female, which reflects the general situation of early Republican academia: It was possible, yet still rare, for women to achieve an academic status that would allow them to publish in specialized journals. In fact, women are probably comparatively overrepresented in this specific sample.\n\nIII. The Place of the Post-1908 Ottoman Empire within Belleten\n\n18In Issues 1 through 56 of Belleten, 33 articles mention the post-1908 Ottoman Empire. I chose the word mention, because not every article treats the Second Constitutional Era as its main topic or as a historiographical research subject in its own right. However, I found it insightful to also include in this analysis articles that devote only introductory remarks to the very recent past, or that mention it only in passing.\n\n20The fact that late Ottoman history plays such a marginal role in Belleten once again shows that (late) Ottoman history was at most a secondary concern to early Republican state historiography, which was mainly pre-occupied with “developing a strong national conscience by relying on pre-Ottoman periods” (Ersanlı 1996: 12). It is even more conspicuous when we call to mind that exactly the recent past would have provided historians with a multitude of well-preserved and rather easily accessible source material to work with (Ersanlı 2002b: 153). As implied above, the focus of TTK, and of Belleten by proximity, lay on earlier historic periods, on archaeology and anthropology. The latter two disciplines were not only en vogue in a global context: In the Turkish case they furthermore provided the means to establish claims to a continuous Turkish presence in Anatolia, which was vital for the young state’s self-assertion against territorial claims by Armenia and Greece (Copeaux 1997: 50–51). The politically sensitive recent past, in contrast, was not a favorite topic. It is all the more interesting to investigate what and how authors in Belleten did write about the post-1908 Ottoman Empire, when they chose to include it in their representations of the past.\n\n23In five articles, the Second Constitutional Era is woven into people’s biographies whithout being expressly marked as such, politically or otherwise. It is simply the time in which certain individuals (such as the linguist Ragıp Hulûsi Özdem or the archeologist Theodor Makridi) happen to live, go to school, publish books, or perform certain professional tasks (Koşay 1944; Ogan 1941; Özgüç 1948; Uzunçarşılı 1940b, 1945). Here, the Second Constitutional Era assumes a quality of biographic background noise. Four articles are concerned with foreign politics (Bayur 1937, 1938, 1943; Uludağ 1938), in which we encounter classical diplomatic history on the international status of the Bosphorus straits, discussions of the revocation of the capitulations, and examinations of the treaty of Sèvres.\n\n24Only three articles within the sample focus on the First World War (Arat 1937; Bayur 1938; İğdemir 1943). It is not surprising that the number of texts on this topic is so small: It confirms the hypothesis that the First World War was for the most part overshadowed by the War of Independence in early Republican state historiography (Turan 2014: 252). Regarding the content of the articles, the successful battles of Gallipoli take pride of place, while unsuccessful campaigns, lost battles, and, indeed, the losing of the war, are treated in less detail. It might go without saying, but I would like to note that the Armenian Genocide is not mentioned within these texts. A further three articles elaborate on the 1908 revolution and its aftermath (İnan 1944, 1950; Kızıldoğan 1937). Strikingly, all three texts engage in a direct recounting of Mustafa Kemal’s personal experiences. More controversial themes, such as the 1909 attempt at counterrevolution or the 1913 coup d’état, are not present within Belleten.\n\n25Four articles take up topics that no other text in the sample does: Only one focuses on the imperial household and the person of Sultan Mehmed V Reşad (Tansel 1949), one delves into medical history (Uludağ 1938), one concerns itself with the development of historical methodology (Uzunçarşılı 1938), and the last one tackles the changing conceptions of Turkish history itself and the developments in the field of historical research in Republican Turkey (Yücel 1944).\n\n26Last but not least, nine articles only mention the Second Constitutional Era in passing, without going into much depth, while being chiefly concerned with another period (Barkan 1947; Göker 1938; Günaltay 1938; [İnan] 1938b, 1938c; Nedkoff 1944; Özer 1938; Sungu 1938; Uzunçarşılı 1940a). These articles provide us with a fresh and unexpected perspective regarding the complexity of the Second Constitutional Era’s historiographical image. That these short remarks are as numerous as articles about Atatürk’s life suggests that the predecessor regime, even if it was not the early Republic’s preferred historiographical topic in itself, still served as an important reference point – a somewhat inverse phenomenon to the one indicated by Etienne Copeaux in Espaces et Temps de la Nation Turque: He identifies instances in schoolbooks where “the historical narrative is interrupted and abruptly makes place for a reflection on recent history or for a quotation of Atatürk” (Copeaux 1997: 136). While in the case described by Copeaux, “the rapprochement expressed by the irruption of the present into the narrative of the past establishes the framework of official collective memory” (Copeaux 1997: 141), mentions of the late Ottoman past usually provide a dark contrast against which the progress and successes of the Republic can be shown all the more clearly (Günaltay 1938; [İnan] 1938b; Özer 1938; Sungu 1938), and at times also as a marked ending point of Ottoman decline, offsetting the Empire’s earlier, more glorious stages (Göker 1938; Uzunçarşılı 1940a).\n\nIV. The Question of Historiographical Genres\n\n27The most frequent historiographical genre within the sample is the obituary, with eight occurrences (Bayur 1939; Bilsel 1939; Göker 1939; Koşay 1944; Ogan 1941; Öymen 1939; Uzunçarşılı 1940b, 1945) (see Figure 3), which should not surprise us: We once again have to acknowledge the extraordinary surge of obituaries that Atatürk’s death provoked. What is more, it is only natural that the Second Constitutional Era should at least implicitly figure in almost every obituary, because it was a time span that people who died between 1937 and 1950 had typically lived through.\n\nV. Evaluating the Post-1908 Ottoman Empire\n\n31The most fundamental question regarding the depiction of the post-1908 Ottoman Empire is, plainly, whether it was represented in a favorable or a negative light. It transpires that the image of this multifaceted timespan is more complex and cannot simply be put into one of those two categories, or, as Nicholas Danforth puts it, the Ottoman past is \"amenable to multiple, often nuanced and contradictory, interpretations” (Danforth 2014: 655).\n\n34A more negative outlook, still related to war and military institutions, is given by Âfet İnan, who portrays the Ottoman army during and before the First World War as too obedient to its foreign military advisers and lacking national self-confidence. In her assessment, it is obvious that in the Ottoman army – and in the state system more generally – the wrong people made it to the top, and that the real ingenuity of the Turkish people could only be found in the lower ranks (İnan 1950: 508–509).\n\n26 Original: “Gerçi meşrutiyet devrinin son senelerinde bazı Türk çocukları millî varlığı ve millî tar (...)\n\n“It is true that in the last years of the constitutional era, some children of the Turkish nation began to work towards bringing the national existence and the national history to the light. But, in the dark days of the armistice, mindless individuals bereft of national feeling, who came to power by relying on their dark souls and on foreign states, saw it as their first task to suffocate this innocent activity and to have those who worked in this field removed from their positions.” (Günaltay 1938: 337)\n\n31 Original: “Abdülhamit devrindeki muktedir bir asker şöhretini haizdir, meşrutiyet devrinde Yemen İm (...)\n\n“In the era of Abdülhamit he possessed the reputation of a capable soldier; in the constitutional era, the treaty he made with the Imam of Yemen gave him the reputation of being an intelligent and efficient statesman. Although during the Great War, he did not do anything to distinguish himself, after the armistice he was deemed to be the greatest statesman and capable commander among those who stayed faithful to the sultan, come what may.” (Bayur 1937: 451, emphasis added)\n\n38As is clearly visible, the same qualifications are not used for negative assessments, which are voiced directly.\n\n40Overall, we see an ambivalent approach to the recent past: In certain respects, especially regarding reform movements, currents and agents from the Young Turk era are seen as predecessors whose agenda is logically continued in the Republican era. The closer we come to the proclamation of the Republic, however, the more reprehensible the central Ottoman state actors are portrayed.\n\nVI. Science and Progress – or Backwardness?\n\n42Thus, the Second Constitutional Era is not per se depicted as an educational dark age. We find, however, conflicting views, notably in Sungu’s article “Tevhidi Tedrisat” [The Unification of Instruction], which, incidentally, is mainly concerned with Republican education reforms and thus uses the Second Constitutional Era as a dark contrasting foil against which the colors of the Republican progress could shine all the more brightly. When the revolutionary character of the Republican reforms and innovations is at stake, ideas of continuity and genealogy, cautiously voiced in other contexts, are left aside.\n\n37 Original: “Anın fikrince suda yaşıyan bir küçük kurt müruru zamanla balık ve daha bir zaman mürur e (...)\n\n“According to that thought, a little worm living in the water after some time becomes a fish, and when again some time has passed, it becomes a crocodile!!! And after that, it becomes a monkey!! And supposedly the monkey becomes a human being!!!!! Alas!!! This harmful thought […]. However, these views are not true.” (Sungu 1938: 410)\n\n45Again, just like in the overall evaluation of the post-1908 Ottoman Empire, Sungu also depicts the realm of education and research in a somewhat ambiguous and paradox light, with religion and elitism marked as the predominant impediments to true progress.\n\nVII. A Past, So Distant, and Yet So Very Near: The Question of Historicity\n\n46Lastly, let us turn to the question of to what extent the late Ottoman Empire is considered ‘history’ in our sample of articles. History does not pre-exist historiography, but it is constructed and stands in a dynamic relationship with different kinds of pasts (such as memory or ‘recent events’). Past-as-history has to be demarcated from the present. The line between both is not self-evident, especially when a recent past is the focus. This brings us to the question of how historicity is marked within Belleten, and how ruptures and continuities are constructed.\n\n40 Original: “Şimdiye kadar takip olunan tahsil ve terbiye usullerinin milletimizin tarihi tedenniyatı (...)\n\n“I hold that the education and teaching methods we have been following until now have been among the most important factors within the decline of our nation’s history. This is why, when I speak of a national education program, I mean a culture that is entirely remote from the old era’s superstition, from the foreign thoughts that have no relation whatsoever to our innate qualities, and from all influences coming from East and West, a culture that is appropriate to our national and historical character.” (Sungu 1938: 422, emphasis added.)\n\n48Within the quote, which Sungu chose to include in his article, we encounter several points worth noting: Apart from the decline rhetoric, we find the question of the authenticity of history. The past is rhetorically devalued, but at the same time, national history and national character are idealized. This specific quote forms part of a rhetoric that propounds an elliptic view of history, in which the Ottoman Empire would not be seen as a part of ‘real’ Turkish history, but as an interregnum of sorts (Copeaux 1997: 140–141; Ersanlı 2002b: 141). Often, however, the lines are not as clear-cut, and it is not as easy to determine which parts of the past should be dismissed and which could be appropriated. This ambiguous approach to historicity shapes much of historical thinking within Belleten, which also distinguishes the journal from more popular publications and magazines, in which the decline paradigm was replicated in a less complex and more unfiltered way (Ersanlı 2002b: 145).\n\n46 Bayur’s article analyses a memorandum by Foreign Minister Ahmed İzzet Paşa, presented to Grand Vizi (...)\n\n47 Original: “Bu lâyiha 40 yaşını geçmiş olanlara çocukluk ve gençliklerinin nasıl bir muhitte geçmiş (...)\n\n“This memorandum reminds those who have surpassed the age of forty in what kind of environment they spent their childhood and youth. It teaches those who are younger than 35 the ruling political spirit of the environment in which their fathers and elder brothers have lived in a past that is both so distant and yet so very near”. (Bayur 1937: 452)\n\n53The difference is also marked on a methodological level: Personal memory is treated as an important source for writing about Mustafa Kemal’s biography – a topic that was already perceived as historical while Atatürk was still alive. Everything that surrounds Atatürk lets personal memory acquire a historical value and a claim to accuracy that surpasses the mere anecdotal. Articles on Mustafa Kemal constitute a clear exception within Belleten: Only here is personal memory valid as a legitimate source. Ottoman history, even if it concerns the very recent past, is written with exclusive reference to written and archival sources, and is thereby historicized methodologically. We can thus speak of two different aspects of Belleten’s regime of historicity, one that takes care that the past is not “too insistently recalled” (Hartog 2015: 16) and one that binds the past to the present by reviving it and integrating memory and history.\n\n54Although the rupture with the Ottoman past is emphasized within Belleten, no clear turning point between the Ottoman and the Republican era is unambiguously established. Belleten’s discourse tends to incorporate specific instances of the Ottoman past into a Republican genealogy, thereby creating two distinct parallel temporal categories, one as ‘Ottoman history’, the other as ‘Republican history’. This goes against Gürpınar’s claim that “[o]ne of the primary concerns of Kemalism was presenting 1923 as year zero without any pre-history” (Gürpınar 2013: 196): Especially the Armistice Period can be interpreted as a time frame during which the synchronicity of Ottoman and Republican history becomes visible, although the Republican character is predominantly emphasized. This is reinforced by the chronology provided in Belleten’s 1938 volume (Türkiye tarihinin son 20 yıllık devrine ait kronoloji (14.X.1918-30.I.1921), 1938): Here, events relating to the Istanbul government are also included, but events connected to the Anatolian movement and Ankara government are predominant. The compartmentalization further reinforces the regime of historicity in the consolidating Republic of Turkey: The late Ottoman Empire is framed as belonging to a distant history, even though it is yet so near to the lives of the historians, or, as Ersanlı put it, “Ottoman history remained close to the minds if not the hearts, of Republican historians” (Ersanlı 2002b: 154).\n\nVIII. Concluding Remarks\n\n55Belleten’s historiography on the recent past is part of a highly politicized and nationalized discourse. The periodical forms a discursive space whose agents are closely linked to the realm of formal political decision-making; the nationalist and the scholarly discourse are porous and overlapping. The nationalist historiography practiced in Belleten fulfills a discrete function within the nation-building process of constructing a new reality and a nationalist relationship with the past by trying to clearly differentiate Turkish from Ottoman history. Belleten’s regime of historicity is constructed by the notion of an Ottoman and a Republican history that overlap temporally and run side by side synchronically for some time – and that these two historical currents can ideally be clearly demarcated one from the other. This is also why a clear breaking point between Ottoman and Turkish history is not established within Belleten’s discourse: Instead, the two parallel historical spheres run side by side over the course of more than a decade, without touching each other or intermingling.\n\n56The findings from this article are directly applicable only to Belleten and should not be misinterpreted as pertaining to all of Republican historiography in the late 1930s and 1940s, not even to all of resmî tarih. Still, an ambivalent approach to the recent past is not unique to Belleten. It connects to a larger phenomenon of state historiography. The interconnections are by no means arbitrary, given that Belleten held such a central place within the discourse of resmî tarih, and that many of its contributors were not only politically active and influential, but also greatly involved in other central historiographic projects, such as the compilation of history textbooks and of the programmatic Türk Tarihinin Ana Hatları.\n\n57In his analysis of history textbooks, Copeaux has identified the same ambivalence toward the late Ottoman Empire (especially to the First World War), and found it persistent until the 1980s and 1990s (Copeaux 1997: 290–292). Ahmet Kuyaş, in an analysis of similar material, shows that the general shift toward a more positive evaluation of the past that occurred from the 1950s onwards did not extend to the Second Constitutional Era, which continued to lead a shadowy existence in Turkish textbooks (Kuyaş 2008: 51–52). However, Copeaux also points to the fact that schoolbooks characteristically demonstrate a significant ‘time lag’ in incorporating discursive changes and developments that take place in a larger historiographical, specifically academic, field (Copeaux 1997: 19). Further research could investigate to what extent the compartmentalization of late Ottoman history still reverberates today. When we look at its point of origin, though, it is clear that the approach was not ‘invented’ by Belleten: Already the 1932 high school history textbook Tarih 3: Yeni ve Yakın Zamanlar [History 3: Modern and Contemporary History] distinguishes, in its narration of the First World War, between a generally negative assessment of the army command (Türk Tarihi Tetkik Cemiyeti 1933: 305–308) and an excursus on Mustafa Kemal’s feat, again with a mythical touch (Türk Tarihi Tetkik Cemiyeti 1933: 307–308). The extension of the Republican genealogy to a time before 1919 seems to be a product of the early 1930s: It is rather absent in Tarih 3’s predecessor work Türkiye Tarihi [History of Turkey] from the 1920s, in which Mustafa Kemal is positively mentioned in the narration of Gallipoli, but is not in any way as central as in the later texts: the collectivity of the army is more important here ([Ahmet] Hâmit and [Mustafa] Muhsin 1930: 721; originally published in 1924, reprinted in 1926 and latinized in 1930). Also Nutuk famously defines the beginning of Republican history as May 1919, a practice Türk Tarihinin Ana Hatları follows (Türk Tarihi Heyeti 1930: 605–606).\n\n59Coming back to Belleten and the texts investigated in this article, it is furthermore noteable that no significant shift in the representation and evaluation of the post-1908 Ottoman Empire occurred. While Kemalism was re-appraised after Mustafa Kemal’s death in other discourses, at least within Belleten, the Kemalist narrative of salvation still persevered. This reaffirms the supposition of Belleten as one of the cornerstones of resmî tarih, the discursive field where nationalist historiography “provide[d] a context for […] reforms and strengthen[ed] the self-image of the republic” (Foss 2014: 826)."
