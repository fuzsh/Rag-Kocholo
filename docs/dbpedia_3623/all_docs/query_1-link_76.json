        "text": "What’s new? Turkey and Greece have returned to talks after their mid-2020 dispute over sovereignty in the eastern Mediterranean Sea devolved into the longest-lasting military face-off since the 1970s. The discussions could help the parties de-escalate tensions and move from brinkmanship to dialogue.\n\nWhy did it happen? Tensions flared in 2019-2020 when Ankara – seeking a say in energy projects – sent seismic research ships to waters contested with Greece and the Republic of Cyprus, intervened in Libya’s civil war and signed a maritime delimitation deal with Tripoli. Turkey’s rivals have increasingly aligned with Greece over competing sovereignty claims.\n\nWhy does it matter? Should talks break down again, Athens and Ankara could find themselves locked in a tenser and more dangerous stalemate than before. More hardware on the seas, higher perceived stakes because of offshore gas discoveries and more actors entangled in the region contribute to the situation’s volatility.\n\nWhat should be done? To keep talks on track, Greece and Turkey should refrain from provocations, including with regard to Cyprus. They should abide by military accords aimed at transparency and trust building. Brussels and Washington should work to overcome Ankara’s exclusion from regional forums and reconsider their backing for an undersea pipeline project.\n\nExecutive Summary\n\nIn July-August 2020, Turkish and Greek warships faced off on high alert across the eastern Mediterranean Sea in the longest-lasting showdown in the two countries’ decades-old dispute over maritime sovereignty. After weeks of tension, with foreign navies entering the mix, two frigates collided, showing the risk that an accident could spill into a conflict neither side wants. Both pulled back, but only weeks later and under pressure from EU leaders. The danger will remain as long as Ankara and Athens stay locked in a cycle of brinkmanship that has nearly brought them to blows at least four times since the 1970s. That brinkmanship has increased in recent years as Turkey has become bolder in lodging claims for sovereignty over eastern Mediterranean waters and Greece has become increasingly assertive in forging ties with regional partners to hem Turkey in. Both Ankara and Athens should steer clear of further provocations and persevere in exploratory talks, to which they have recently returned. European powers and the U.S. should support the effort, including by working to dispel Turkey’s sense of encirclement.\n\nOver years of stagnant talks – Turkey and Greece cannot even agree on what to discuss – the maritime dispute between the two neighbours has grown and so has the range of issues that divide them. Maritime issues encompass disputes about delimitation of fishing rights, seabed resource exploitation and more. Beyond these issues, the disagreements stretch from sovereignty struggles that hark back to the founding periods of both states to recent bitter tussles over migration management. Looming over everything is the unresolved conflict over Cyprus. The island’s Greek Cypriot and Turkish Cypriot communities have been divided since 1964, when the UN set up a peacekeeping mission. In 1974, Greek Cypriots backed by the junta then ruling in Athens carried out a coup aiming to become part of Greece, and Turkey invaded in response. A decade later, Turkish Cypriots proclaimed their own republic – recognised only by Turkey – in the north of the island.\n\nAs the areas of disagreement have piled up and expanded in scope, the relationship between Athens and Ankara has also become more volatile due to geopolitics. The U.S., once an actively engaged peacekeeper in the region, is no longer so invested. Nor is it clear that Washington will reclaim this role amid a host of other pressing issues in its relations with Ankara. EU leaders are trying to fill U.S. shoes but with more limited leverage than they once had as Turkey’s EU accession prospects have dwindled. Mutual North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) membership reduces the chance of war, but Turkey’s relations within the alliance are at an all-time low due to its 2017 purchase of Russian S-400 missiles, while Greece does not trust NATO leadership to mediate fairly.\n\nLately, and particularly following the events of 2019, Ankara has been isolated as France and other nations, including the United Arab Emirates, have lined up behind Greece. Its recent efforts to mend ties with regional rivals Egypt and Israel have yet to bear fruit. In the meantime, its exclusion from hydrocarbon development consortia gives it every incentive to obstruct related projects, while Athens’ diplomatic victories give it less motive to seek compromise.\n\nAll concerned should focus on keeping the discussions going.\n\nAgainst this backdrop, the recent restart of dormant “exploratory talks” on how to tackle the countries’ competing claims to the rocks, air and sea between them offers a sliver of opportunity. Granted, talks could not unravel the dispute despite over 60 rounds of meetings between 2002 and 2016, when they last broke down. Nor are they likely to do so today when the knots have multiplied and become even more tangled. Nevertheless, talking is a better way to build confidence and seek openings for further progress than swapping imprecations as the parties were doing almost daily in mid-2020. All concerned should focus on keeping the discussions going.\n\nTo further bring down the temperature and improve prospects for talks, Ankara and Athens should steer well clear of each other’s red lines and refrain from other provocative rhetoric and action. In an atmosphere of historically low trust, they should implement common-sense measures they agreed to long ago to halt the flexing of military muscle. They should also do all they can to advance UN-mediated talks about a political resolution on Cyprus, without which relations between the neighbours are likely to remain fraught. Because a sense of exclusion and encirclement have only encouraged Ankara to greater heights of brinkmanship, Washington and Brussels should seek ways to overcome opposition by other regional actors to Turkey’s inclusion in groups like the East Mediterranean Gas Forum. They should reconsider their support for a pipeline project that Ankara sees as threatening its interests; this scheme seems to be losing momentum in any case, as it may be less economically viable than first thought.\n\nIf the exploratory talks collapse back into mutual recrimination, the risk of conflict between Turkey and Greece will be rendered greater by fresh mistrust. The mini-arms race under way between the two feeds the danger of accident and miscalculation. Moreover, the more additional regional powers are drawn in, the greater the peril of escalation, with fewer able to mediate than at any time in the recent past. New talks can help reset the tone between these two estranged neighbours and buy time for them and their allies to plot a course out of the crisis that has burdened the region for too long. It is an opportunity they should do their best to seize.\n\nAnkara/Athens/Washington/Brussels, 31 May 2021\n\nI. Introduction\n\nOn 21 July 2020, Turkey announced plans to prospect for gas in disputed waters south of the Greek island of Kastellorizo, near the Turkish coast. Greece put its naval forces on alert, sparking the full deployment of the Greek and Turkish fleets across the Aegean and eastern Mediterranean Seas. For days the two countries traded carefully scripted barbs. Then, on 12 August, one of the two Turkish warships escorting the Oruç Reis, a seismic research vessel, collided with a Greek frigate shadowing it. The bump so noticeably rattled Ankara and Athens that a half-day’s silence ensued. The scare helped pull them back from the brink of a larger confrontation, but tensions simmered for weeks before the warships steamed back to port.\n\nThis crisis was the longest-lasting in a cycle of periodic escalations since the 1970s over competing Greek and Turkish sovereignty claims in the eastern Mediterranean – underscoring geopolitical shifts that have made the situation more volatile than before. The U.S. once kept tensions in check through its close alliances with the parties, which are both North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) members hosting U.S. military bases, but in recent years it has drifted away from this role. Germany, France and NATO have tried to fill the vacuum in different ways, but they lack Washington’s leverage and are seen as less than neutral arbiters. Meanwhile, Ankara’s dim prospects for EU accession has removed a moderating factor in Turkish and Greek policy alike. A scramble for influence in the eastern Mediterranean by newly assertive third parties further complicates the picture: Egypt, France and the United Arab Emirates (UAE) have all sided with Greece in its dispute with Turkey over various maritime claims.\n\nOver the past half-century, Athens and Ankara have found ways to talk to each other and to stop the cyclical crises from escalating. This legacy holds some promise for today. In early 2021, Greece and Turkey returned after a five-year hiatus to so-called exploratory talks intended to lay the groundwork for formal negotiations over maritime boundaries and related issues. In over 60 rounds of meetings since 2002, they have done little to resolve the dispute, although they have at least mapped some common ground. Today, sticking points have become even stickier and new ones have emerged since the two sides last sat across the table. No swift resolution will come from a return to talks. But steady engagement, particularly if coupled with other steps to defuse tension, can have its own benefits, especially given that the sides now face each other over a dangerous buffet of “pessimism, fatigue and mistrust”, in the words of a Western diplomat.\n\nThis report lays out the domestic and international factors that have led to today’s parlous state of affairs between Greece and Turkey in the eastern Mediterranean and what the parties, the European Union (EU), the U.S. and others might do to help the sides sustain de-escalation. It points out the dynamics that need to be in place to move toward resolution of a dispute that is increasingly interlinked with regional challenges. The report is based on dozens of interviews with Turkish and Greek officials and experts, EU officials and representatives of U.S., European and Arab governments. Future reports will look at prospects for a settlement to the Cyprus dispute and how prospecting for gas is serving as a source of conflict and cooperation for Greece, Turkey and other littoral states.\n\nII. Turkey-Greece: Old Rivals, New Tensions\n\nA. Fifty Fraught Years\n\nThe Turkish-Greek dispute in the Aegean Sea is rooted in five decades of fraught relations. Much of the contemporary bad blood between the two arises from the situation in Cyprus. In 1974, the junta in Athens engineered a coup in Nicosia intended to unite Cyprus with Greece. Turkey invaded and maintained a military presence in the island’s northern third, which subsequently declared itself a sovereign state. The northern portion of the island, which calls itself the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus, is recognised by Turkey as independent from the Greek-speaking Republic of Cyprus in the south. No other nation recognises the de facto entity’s sovereignty. Although military tensions have ebbed and flowed, they have generally been high since that time. Greece sent troops to eastern Aegean islands and, in July 1975, Turkey created a new army division in the coastal province of Izmir, known as the 4th or Aegean army.\n\nAgainst this backdrop, a 1976 row marked the first of four times in the last 50 years that third parties felt it necessary to intervene to stop the NATO allies from coming to blows. Disagreement over hydrocarbon exploration sparked the dispute. In August 1976, Turkey sent the Sismik I (Hora) research vessel into disputed waters claimed by Greece, escorted by a warship. Greece responded by putting its armed forces on full alert and sought recourse at both the UN Security Council and the International Court of Justice (ICJ). To get the sides to back down, Washington held out the promise of military aid to Greece and removal of an arms embargo it had imposed to punish Turkey for the 1974 Cyprus invasion. Athens and Ankara signed the Bern protocol in November 1976 agreeing to principles for their negotiations over competing continental shelf claims.\n\nDomestic political considerations and developments in Cyprus disrupted efforts to reach a settlement.\n\nThe ensuing dialogue, launched at a leaders’ meeting in Montreux in 1978, kicked off years of diplomatic engagement that bespeak both a mutual desire to avoid larger confrontation and the enormous challenges impeding an actual resolution of the Aegean Sea disputes. In closed-door talks through 1981, negotiators tackled sensitive issues, such as the delimitation of maritime zones around eastern Greek islands close to Turkey’s coastline, and even tentatively broached the idea of joint energy exploration. Then, as on many occasions since, domestic political considerations and developments in Cyprus disrupted efforts to reach a settlement.\n\nThe parties edged back to the brink twice more in the next fifteen years. In 1987, and again in 1995-1996, Turkey and Greece put their militaries on high alert. In the 1980s, tensions built as Turkey perceived Greece to be blocking its European integration aspirations and Athens resented Ankara’s recognition of Turkish Cypriot independence. Turkey’s deployment of the Piri Reis seismic research ship, flanked by two warships, into waters just outside Greek territorial seas led to a military standoff in March 1987.\n\nIn the mid-1990s, ties were strained after Greece ratified the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea, under which it claimed the right to extend its territorial waters in the Aegean from 6 to 12 nautical miles. Turkey said it would view Greek exercise of this option as an act of war (casus belli). When, in December 1995, a Turkish bulk carrier ran aground on an uninhabited islet off the coast of Turkey – known as Imia in Greek and Kardak in Turkish – arguments over which state had jurisdiction to salvage the boat spiralled nearly out of control. Egged on by respective media, Greek and Turkish citizens scrambled to hoist the national flag over the islet. The two militaries followed suit – with warships standing by.\n\nIn each of these instances, the U.S., Britain and NATO intervened diplomatically to defuse the crisis, but diplomacy aimed at moving the sides from de-escalation to talks has always been a slog. A meeting in 1988 between then-Prime Ministers Turgut Özal and Andreas Papandreou came about only after months of messages passed through embassies. It took two more years of talks – known as the “Davos process” – to hammer out the confidence-building measures (CBMs) that remain the principal framework for the two militaries to exercise mutual restraint. After the 1995-1996 flareup, Ankara and Athens spent almost three years in NATO-brokered talks to recommit to some of the same measures and agree on a number of new ones. Other mediation initiatives, such as an expert group (known as the “committee of wise men”) that the Dutch sought to organise to search for solutions, never really got off the ground.\n\nSustained U.S. diplomatic engagement throughout Bill Clinton’s presidency helped pave the way for a thaw in relations from 1999 through the mid-2000s, initiated under former Foreign Ministers İsmail Cem (Turkey) and George Papandreou (Greece). The diplomatic engagement came despite or was perhaps even lent a sense of urgency by renewed tensions over an aborted Greek plan to deploy Russian-made S-300 surface-to-air missiles in the Republic of Cyprus in 1997-1998 and the capture by Turkey of Abdullah Öcalan, the leader of the Kurdistan Workers’ Party (PKK), which is designated as a terrorist group by Ankara, the U.S. and the EU, after he sought safe haven in the Greek embassy in Kenya in 1999. Each side rallied to the other’s aid following devastating earthquakes in 1999. The first round of exploratory talks began in 2002; after two years, the sides appeared closer than ever to a deal on delimitation of the continental shelf, territorial seas and airspace in contested areas of the Aegean and eastern Mediterranean.\n\nThe reserve of trust from this brief honeymoon helped avert major escalations in the Aegean\n\nDespite bouts of acrimony over Cyprus, the reserve of trust from this brief honeymoon helped avert major escalations in the Aegean and kept lacklustre exploratory talks going. Still, relations remained something of a rollercoaster. Greek Cypriots voted against a UN proposal known as the Annan Plan (see Section III) to reunify the island that Turkish Cypriots backed and which Ankara, the U.S. and the EU had supported. A month later, in May 2004, the Republic of Cyprus became an EU member against Turkey’s objections. But when, in May 2006, a Turkish and a Greek military jet collided south of Rhodes, leading to a Greek pilot’s death, the two sides made use of contacts at chief of staff level to de-escalate. In the next decade, the Aegean neighbours improved trade, Greece allowed Turkish citizens to visit its eastern Aegean islands visa-free, and high-level delegations from each side met within the framework of the so-called High-Level Cooperation Council (see Section V). Exploratory talks broke down when eight Turkish military officers sought refuge in Greece after the failed coup attempt in Turkey in July 2016.\n\nFrom 2019, a series of escalating moves and countermoves discussed below led to an unusually long and tense standoff. A meeting between President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan and Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis and German attempts to mediate initially failed to calm the waters. Space opened for resuming exploratory talks, however, when Ankara pulled back the Oruç Reis from disputed maritime zones in late November 2020 and announced a month later that the vessel would carry out seismic research in uncontested waters until 15 June 2021 (see the map in Appendix A listing Ankara’s navigational advisories for Oruç Reis and depicting the ship’s exploration areas).\n\nB. A Multi-faceted Dispute\n\nAs it has evolved over the years, the Greek-Turkish maritime dispute has come to encompass a web of intertwining disputes and overlapping issues.\n\nFirst there are disputes over Turkey’s maritime boundaries with the Greek islands off its Aegean and southern coasts, where Ankara and Athens have each stretched to make claims over rocks, seas and skies. Among the most far-reaching are Greece’s assertion that Kastellorizo, a 12 sq km island within swimming distance of Turkey, may claim an Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) extending 200 nautical miles from its coastline, drastically cutting into the zone that Turkey would claim for itself. For its part, Turkey negotiated a maritime delimitation (ie, boundary) agreement with the UN-recognised government in Tripoli in 2019 that ignores the potential zones that might extend from sizeable Greek islands, including Rhodes and Crete. Many other delimitation issues also arise with respect to the jigsaw puzzle of more than 2,400 islands (most of them Greek) scattered across the Aegean Sea.\n\nSecondly, the parties disagree about what should be on the agenda between them. Beyond delimitation issues, Turkey wants to add to the list two more items. One is the demilitarisation of certain Greek islands in the eastern Aegean and the status of “grey zones”, hundreds of uninhabited Aegean islets and rocks not explicitly mentioned in international treaties. Ankara says Greek military deployments on islands near Turkey have shifted the delicate security balance in the region. It fears Athens’ possible extension of its territorial waters in the Aegean and claim of large continental shelf areas for its eastern Aegean islands; should Greece do so, it would block Turkey out of shipping lanes traversing the Aegean high seas that Ankara sees as an economic and security lifeline.\n\nGreece refuses to consider either issue. In the former case, Athens argues that demilitarisation would undermine Greek national security in the face of Turkey’s continued threat. In the latter case, it says international treaties offer sufficient guidance as to which isles belong to whom. (For a description of the parties’ technical positions concerning the Aegean Sea dispute’s various dimensions, see Appendix B.)\n\nThirdly, in addition to differing about what should be part of prospective negotiations, the parties cannot agree on a framework through which to address their disagreements. Officials in Athens have long insisted that the ICJ adjudicate delimitation issues. Turkey sees the countries’ maritime disputes as something that the parties must first try to resolve bilaterally; it does not rule out arbitration or recourse to the ICJ but says whatever mechanism the parties choose should cover all Aegean issues over which the two differ – not just delimitation.\n\nBeyond these issues, the unresolved dispute over Cyprus and Turkey’s concerns about the growing economic and military cooperation among its regional rivals are stoking tensions. The discovery of gas in the Mediterranean seabed by Israel in 2008, Cyprus in 2011 and Egypt in 2015 raised the stakes, with Turkey worried that it will be cut out, along with its allies the Turkish Cypriots.\n\nBut the mid-2020 escalation was not about gas per se. In fact, the waters where Turkey and Greece deployed naval forces are far from any known deposits. The acrimony that comes from festering clashes over sovereignty fuels and is fuelled by bilateral spats over military manoeuvres, minority rights and cultural heritage. Meanwhile, Greece accuses Turkey of permitting migrants from across war-torn regions of South Asia and the Middle East to leave its shores for Greek islands or the mainland border as a means of leverage. Turkey retorts with allegations that Greece is harbouring individuals whom Ankara views as terrorists, including alleged members of the PKK and the group it labels the Fethullahist Terrorist Organisation, or FETÖ. In looking for ways to find common ground, it is necessary to examine the drivers of the parties’ behaviour, including how domestic politics in Ankara and Athens are thwarting attempts at reconciliation.\n\nIII. The View from Turkey\n\nAnkara’s increasingly assertive approach to defending its maritime interests, particularly since early 2019, has been driven by two major frustrations: it believes, first, that Turkey and Turkish Cypriots are being excluded from potential energy riches, including by a pipeline plan; and, secondly, that other Mediterranean states are pursuing a containment policy that will chip away at Turkey’s sovereignty, economic security and geopolitical reach. But Ankara is also clearly uncomfortable with the idea of being isolated. Recently, it has begun making diplomatic overtures to rebuild bridges with regional powers and the West and to undercut backing for Greece.\n\nA. Cyprus and the Nationalist Turn\n\nThe failure of Erdoğan’s efforts to reconcile with adversaries at home and abroad in his first decade in power led to disillusionment among Turkey’s political elite and his embrace over time of harder-line approaches.\n\nAs prime minister from 2003 to 2014, Erdoğan took steps to address some of the grievances of Turkey’s Kurds and pursued negotiations with the PKK – albeit fitfully – which drew the ire of Turkish nationalists. He also took relatively conciliatory positions concerning Cyprus reunification, talks with Athens and normalisation of ties with Yerevan – widely described as a policy of “zero problems with neighbours” – that upended Ankara’s foreign policy traditions. He was bolstered in these initiatives by a vibrant economy, friendly relations with Washington and Brussels, and support from Kurds and liberals in Turkey. But Erdoğan won no diplomatic victory on any of these fronts, and in the meantime found himself bleeding votes from nationalists who argued that Ankara’s concessions were not serving Turkey’s interests. “Any more compromise and he wouldn’t have been able to maintain power”, said a presidential palace source.\n\nThe situation in Cyprus, which is foremost among the issues shaping Turkey’s approach to the eastern Mediterranean today, has played into Erdoğan’s political evolution. Following the 1974 invasion that divided the island, Ankara became the only country in the world to recognise the independence of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus, which was declared in 1983 on the third of the island where Turkey maintains a military presence. Nationalists in Turkey have fiercely defended the de facto republic and its claimed prerogatives ever since. But in the period between 2003-2014, Erdoğan made a volte-face. In the face of nationalist resistance, he supported a settlement plan championed by UN Secretary-General Kofi Annan to reunify the island at UN-sponsored talks. In tandem, the EU offered Nicosia a path to accession in 2003, with some inside the bloc arguing that the prospect would encourage Turkish Cypriots to support reunification. Turkish Cypriots did in fact vote for the Annan Plan in a referendum. Greece backed Nicosia’s accession and also supported Turkey’s EU aspirations.\n\nStill, the settlement plan ultimately failed.\n\nStill, the settlement plan ultimately failed. In their own referendum, Greek Cypriots rejected the Annan Plan; nevertheless, the Republic of Cyprus joined the EU in 2004. The Turkish foreign ministry warned the EU that the Greek Cypriots did not have “authority to represent the whole of Cyprus or the Turkish Cypriots”. Leaders in Ankara were also disturbed that the EU failed to fulfil its promises to increase aid and start trade with the de facto Turkish Cypriot entity following the Turkish Cypriot vote in favour of reunification in 2004. (EU leaders at the time had pledged to “put an end to the isolation of the Turkish Cypriot community”. ) Despite these disappointments, Erdoğan’s AK Party government started its own EU accession negotiations in 2005.\n\nThe unresolved feud over Cyprus fed maritime disputes between Turkey and Greece, and vice versa. Turkey does not recognise the Republic of Cyprus and holds that it cannot enter delimitation agreements or exploit natural resources in the eastern Mediterranean without sharing revenues with the de facto republic in the north. Turkish officials say they began voicing concerns about the rights of Turkish Cypriots when Cyprus signed its first maritime delimitation deal with Egypt in 2003. After its EU accession, the Republic of Cyprus went on to sign new delimitation deals, with Lebanon in 2007 and Israel in 2010. These all became sources of friction with Ankara.\n\nTurkey also grew embittered by the influence that Greek Cypriots gained over the EU’s approach to Turkey. “European countries, in addition to missing opportunities for diplomacy, gave in to the spoiled actions of Greece and the Greek Cypriot administration”, Erdoğan said in November 2020, on the anniversary of the northern de facto republic’s establishment. Turkish officials argue that Brussels is partial to the positions of the two EU members involved in the matter, namely Nicosia and Athens; they also hold that maritime delimitation is not an EU competence.\n\nFor years, Turkish officials say, their efforts to draw attention to what Ankara saw as unfair actions by the Republic of Cyprus were ignored. Over time, they found increasing reason for concern. After the discovery of gas off the Cyprus coast, international energy majors began exploration in 2011, picking up pace after 2016, amid excitement that the region might prove an alternative to Russian pipeline gas for Europe. Meanwhile, efforts to reunify the island went nowhere, with the last round of attempts ending in failure in 2017. “We said this is going to lead to problems. The island is still divided: the EU was silent”, a Turkish official said. “We had to do something”. Ankara acquired research and drilling ships and sent them – often with naval escorts – into contested waters both north east and west of Cyprus. “The message was: ‘If you try to go ahead with exploration and a pipeline without including Turkey, you won’t be able to utilise hydrocarbon resources and you will have the constant threat of your neighbour’”, the same official said.\n\nAgainst this backdrop, and particularly after the 2016 coup attempt, Erdoğan and his AK Party increasingly relied on the support of nationalists in parliament and among state cadres. This nationalist turn empowered people who had long opposed Erdoğan’s tentative attempts at diplomacy with traditional foes. These politicians and bureaucrats, who catapulted to positions of power after the coup attempt, believe Ankara’s compromising stances in earlier years led to Turkey’s interests being ignored and emboldened the Republic of Cyprus and Greece. In the words of a Turkish official: “They turned to us and said, ‘We told you so’”. With the AK Party’s formal alliance with the ultra-nationalist Nationalist Movement Party (MHP) in early 2018, the government moved to a yet harder line in its eastern Mediterranean policy.\n\nB. A Convergence of Adversaries\n\nAnkara has also felt increasingly threatened by what it sees as a hostile axis seeking to cage it into a small corner of the Mediterranean. Since the 2011 Arab uprisings, it has been trying to counter what it views as a campaign by the UAE, Egypt and, to a lesser extent, Saudi Arabia to blunt Turkish influence in the Middle East and North Africa. It sees a worrying convergence between these actors and Greece, the Republic of Cyprus and Israel. Plans by the Republic of Cyprus, Egypt, Israel and Greece to run a 1,900km pipeline to Europe for gas extracted from the eastern Mediterranean, bypassing Turkey, seemed to justify these fears. The formation of the East Mediterranean Gas Forum – including the above four countries plus Italy, the Palestinian Authority and Jordan – confirmed them. The U.S. backed the forum, and France has shown interest in joining.\n\nTurkey began looking for ways to counter developments that it saw as boxing it in. One was readiness to go toe to toe with NATO allies such as Greece and France on the seas. In 2019, Ankara sent seismic research vessels into waters claimed by the Republic of Cyprus, also with naval escorts, provoking EU sanctions on two executives of Turkey’s state-owned energy firm. Another was military intervention abroad: Turkey saw Libya as the only remaining eastern Mediterranean littoral state with which it had friendly ties. In 2019, Ankara threw its weight behind Libya’s UN-backed government of Prime Minister Faiez Serraj to prevent Field Marshal Khalifa Haftar’s rival forces from toppling him. Ankara signed a security cooperation deal and a maritime agreement with Tripoli on the same day in November 2019.\n\nNo country other than Libya accepts the legality of Turkey’s delimitation scheme, but from Ankara’s point of view, it achieves key objectives. In the short term, it allows Ankara to delay through lawsuits (and therefore raise the cost of) the construction of the eastern Mediterranean natural gas pipeline that Greece, Israel and the Republic of Cyprus want to develop. In the long term, it lays the groundwork for pressing Egypt and Israel to backtrack on agreements for the delimitation of EEZs they reached with Greece and the Republic of Cyprus. Ankara hopes that these countries would then sign new maritime delimitation agreements with Turkey, which would grant them larger areas of jurisdiction than their existing deals do, at the expense of Athens and Nicosia's claims.\n\nSome officials in Ankara presented the maritime agreement with Libya as part of a relatively new conception of national defence, in which the Turkish “homeland” (vatan) encompasses not only land but also sea, or the “blue homeland” (mavi vatan). Although this concept appears in domestic debates, state officials say it is not official policy. The admiral who years ago coined this concept, Cem Gürdeniz, argued in August 2020 that it was a necessary response to Greece, which was “getting backing from the anti-Turkey approach of the U.S. and EU in the eastern Mediterranean, Syria and Libya”. Hardliners see evidence of such an approach in a 2004 map prepared by two Spanish academics that extrapolates EEZs based on littoral states’ potential claims, which shows Turkey’s Mediterranean access restricted to the Gulf of Antalya and illustrates Ankara’s worst-case scenario. Once referenced only among Turkish Eurosceptics, the so-called Seville map is increasingly cited by officials as a source of disquiet – though both Athens and Brussels deny endorsing it. “This comes up again and again from the Turkish side”, an EU official said.\n\nWhile Ankara lays claim under its deal with Libya to maritime areas west of the 28th meridian, it has refrained from gas exploration or exploitation there. Before 2019, Turkey had seen the 28th meridian as its de facto maritime border with Greece, stretching from its southern coastal town of Marmaris to Egypt’s northern coast (west of Alexandria) and crossing the Greek island of Rhodes. During the mid-2020 standoff, the Oruç Reis did not cross this meridian. Hardliners like former Turkish Admiral Cihat Yaycı, for example, say Turkey should do so nonetheless: “Conducting exercises … [is] futile. To establish that these areas belong to us, the only way is to send seismic survey and drilling ships”. In April 2020, Turkey’s state-owned energy company TPAO applied to obtain survey and drilling licences in new maritime areas to the west of this line. Turkish officials say no decision has yet been made on whether they are likely to grant the licences.\n\nC. A Two-pronged Approach\n\nAs of late 2020, Ankara’s muscular foreign policy has come with diplomacy aimed at peeling away EU, Egyptian and Israeli support for Greece. Erdoğan said in December 2020 that he sought to “turn a new page” in ties with EU and in January that exploratory talks with Greece “will herald a new era”. He promised human rights reforms – an area where EU criticism has caused friction – though prospects seem dim for meaningful progress. Turkish officials say it is only a matter of time before ties with Cairo, severed since the coup deposing President Muhammad Morsi in 2013, improve; Egyptian officials play down the prospect. In March, the Turkish foreign minister revived the possibility of a maritime deal with Egypt. Turkey and Israel have also hinted at normalising relations, though big disagreements remain. In December 2020, Turkey said Israel’s hydrocarbon resources would most efficiently be traded to other markets via Turkey, and in March 2021 Israel’s energy minister said the Israelis would like to see Turkey in the East Mediterranean Gas Forum. Turkey has also made overtures to Saudi Arabia and the UAE.\n\nThe change of tack appears to be driven in part by economic worries. With support in the polls slipping, Erdoğan’s ruling coalition is balancing such concerns against the foreign policy sensitivities of nationalist voters, whom some opposition parties are also vying for. Amid the blow dealt by pandemic restrictions and the lira’s nose dive, most polls show that combined support for the AK Party and its ally, the MHP, has fallen below 50 per cent. A majority of Turks see “making ends meet/unemployment” as the country’s most pressing problems. Driven by economic concerns, the public’s view of the EU is improving, with support for EU membership well above 50 per cent throughout 2019 and 2020. The AK Party’s defeat in Turkey’s three largest cities in 2019 municipal elections highlighted the challenge ahead of presidential and general elections scheduled for 2023. Faced with these problems, the government is keener to maintain European direct investment, to attract European tourists and to upgrade its customs union with the EU.\n\nA fault line has emerged within Turkish officialdom between those for and those against salvaging relations with the West; among the former, some believe that tensions with Greece risk spoiling the effort. “Some nationalist circles want to reorient Turkey away from the West, but there are others in the government and state who are pro-NATO and want to preserve Euro-Atlantic links”, said a pro-Western veteran of debates on this issue. Officials seeking better ties with EU capitals and Washington say improved relations would undercut support for Greece that they believe has emboldened Athens and made it more reluctant to compromise. Turkish officials complain of “hostile” statements by Athens painting Turkey as “provocative” or “the enemy”.\n\nYet maximalist positions still dominate the public discussion, with former military figures calling for Turkey to build bases on contested islets and rocks in the Aegean. As a Turkish think-tank representative told Crisis Group: “Segments of the state will stand against any compromise and they are pumping their narrative into society”. Some figures influential in shaping public debate go as far as to say Turkey has rights over a greater sweep of sea even than envisioned by the “blue homeland” maps, including to the north and south of Crete. A retired Turkish staff colonel vocal on these issues says Greece has occupied seventeen islands since the AK Party came to power and Turkey should reclaim them. More moderate voices, who say the “blue homeland” concept hinders efforts to reach a settlement with Greece, are shunned from state media outlets and labelled traitors on social media. Main opposition parties blame the AK Party for Turkey’s soured relations with the U.S., EU, Egypt and Israel but call on the government to stand its ground in talks with Greece, framing possible concessions as “submission”.\n\nAnkara is likely to continue with the two-pronged approach to Turkey’s disputes in the Mediterranean – balancing muscle flexing with diplomacy.\n\nIn the face of long-term geostrategic concerns and short-term public opinion considerations, Ankara is likely to continue with the two-pronged approach to Turkey’s disputes in the Mediterranean – balancing muscle flexing with diplomacy. Overtures to the West do not necessarily mean a softening of Turkey’s policies toward Greece or the Republic of Cyprus. Ankara sees the latter as linked to the core of its sovereignty and political parties of almost all stripes are united around fairly hawkish stances. Moreover, until Turkey is included in a regional platform, it is likely to continue hydrocarbon exploration to highlight the unsustainability of the status quo, while seeking arrangements with Egypt and Israel to strengthen its hand. At the same time, even if its posture remains assertive, it will also try to maintain talks with Greece to de-escalate tensions. In short, Erdoğan will want to keep his options open, to see which route leads to more domestic political and strategic wins, including with regard to Cyprus.\n\nIV. The View from Greece\n\nUncertain about Turkey’s endgame, the government of Prime Minister Mitsotakis is preparing for the worst by bolstering its military, while warily engaging in talks that it has little faith will bear fruit. It has doubled down on a strategy of strengthening international alliances with two goals in mind: deterring Turkey’s assertive military posturing and countering a unilateral revision of the status quo by Turkey in the eastern Mediterranean, whether through gas exploration or delimitation deals like that with Libya.\n\nIn August 2020, as the Oruç Reis charted a course toward disputed waters, Greek officials rushed back from island holidays to decry what they described as gunboat tactics serving a revisionist, neo-Ottoman expansionist agenda stretching from the South Caucasus to Libya. In the Greek public’s eye, such fears were symbolised by Turkey’s reopening, in late July 2020, for Islamic prayer of Hagia Sophia – once a Greek Orthodox basilica and, since 1934, a state-run museum. “Turkey has moved away from its older, previous foreign policy motto: ‘zero problems with our neighbours’; now, it’s closer to ‘zero neighbours without problems’”, quipped National Defence Minister Nikos Panagiotopoulos. Many in Athens worry that because, for Ankara, resolving the maritime dispute ranks lower than other priorities, it has no incentive to do so without other powers raising the stakes.\n\nFor Mitsotakis, officials say, it was Turkey’s decision to lift border controls on migrants seeking to cross into the EU in March 2020 that shifted his calculus to being ready to respond militarily. Mitsotakis had just met with Erdoğan on the sidelines of a NATO summit in London in December 2019, paving the way for political consultations the next January and defence ministry discussions in February. Greek officials saw the migrant decision as a betrayal, calling it an invasion and an act of hybrid warfare. “It really was a wake-up call”, said a veteran Greek expert. January 2020, the Oruç Reis had entered disputed waters south east of Karpathos for around 24 hours; Greek officials put the military on high alert when, in July, Turkey issued a navigational telex warning of further exploration.\n\nGreece is flexing its own military muscle. In 2020, the government raised its defence spending from €3.4 to €5.5 billion after years of cuts due to austerity measures. Athens is refurbishing and buying new weapons, warplanes and ships, including eighteen French Rafale fighter jets, U.S. anti-submarine MH-60 helicopters and German torpedoes. The army is recruiting more men for longer, and Athens plans to construct new and expanded military bases, including one that was used by U.S. and NATO forces at Souda Bay in Crete.\n\nTurkey’s deteriorating ties with Egypt and Israel have been a catalyst for Greece’s own blossoming cooperation with the two.\n\nMeanwhile, Greece has stepped up its own diplomatic overtures, which have found a receptive audience, as the Libyan conflict has aggravated regional rivalries. “To be honest, we have been feasting on it”, a Greek diplomat admitted. Turkey’s deteriorating ties with Egypt and Israel have been a catalyst for Greece’s own blossoming cooperation with the two. More recently, these dynamics helped Athens build new ties with the United Arab Emirates, with which it signed a defence accord in 2020, and Saudi Arabia, which sent six F-15C aircraft to join Greek military exercises in Crete in March. Describing the atmosphere at a Philia (Friendship) Forum hosted in Athens with participants from the Republic of Cyprus, Egypt, Greece, Bahrain, Saudi Arabia, France and the UAE, another Greek diplomat said: “The most vocal voices against Turkey were the Arab countries, not us: they were basically thundering”. (Egypt, Saudi Arabia and the UAE have found themselves at odds with Turkey over Ankara’s backing of the Muslim Brotherhood and close ties to Qatar. Their interests also clash with Turkey’s in the Horn of Africa. )\n\nAthens capitalised on shared misgivings about Ankara’s 2019 maritime deal with Tripoli to delimit its maritime boundary with other littoral states. With Italy, it agreed on an EEZ in the Ionian Sea. A visit by Dendias to Cairo in June 2020 kick-started long-stalled negotiations, culminating in a partial agreement on the Greek-Egyptian maritime border in August. The deal’s timing, which disrupted German efforts to restart exploratory talks, frustrated EU allies, but Greek officials say they had no choice but to act on Cairo’s openness to a proposal they had been pushing for since 2009. The two deals entailed compromises from Athens, sparking criticism from opposition parties. Then, in October 2020, Greece agreed to settle its boundary dispute with Albania at the ICJ. Most recently, Mitsotakis and officials in the Tripoli government exchanged official visits in which they agreed to restart talks about maritime delimitation in spite of Libya’s deal with Turkey.\n\nAnger over Turkey’s purchase of Russian S-400 missiles (among other disagreements) has also led Washington to pivot strategically from Ankara to Athens, though Turkey retains an important role as a NATO ally and host to U.S. bases. Despite apprehension among Greek officials over U.S. President Donald Trump’s telephone diplomacy with Erdoğan, Athens and Washington signed a defence accord in October 2019. When U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo travelled to the region in 2020, he snubbed Turkish officials on two separate occasions: in September, he visited the Republic of Cyprus after announcing a partial lifting of a 33-year U.S. arms embargo on Nicosia, and, in November, he met the Greek Orthodox patriarch in Istanbul but no Turkish officials. Pompeo also used his final NATO meeting to sharply criticise Turkey over the S-400s – an issue that remains a thorn in U.S.-Turkey relations under President Biden.\n\nWashington sees Greece as at the heart of its efforts to facilitate regional energy cooperation, including via the East Mediterranean Gas Forum. U.S. officials have long backed Greece’s role in a series of energy projects that would weaken Russia’s monopoly over the markets of south-eastern Europe and said gas finds in the eastern Mediterranean could contribute to this policy push. “What we wanted to do was support energy as a proxy for other forms of collaboration”, a senior U.S. official from the Trump era said. “The hypothesis was that it would have a halo effect in the political dimensions as well. I would suggest that we exceeded our expectations in terms of how this could kind of pick up”.\n\nBiden has long been a proponent of stronger U.S. ties with Greece and strategic partnership with the Republic of Cyprus, but it remains to be seen how committed he will be to pursuing these policies during his presidency. Biden spoke to Mitsotakis on 25 March, nearly one month before calling Erdoğan, and Secretary of State Antony Blinken has said he would “continue to deepen ties between the U.S. and Greece, as well as Cyprus”. But the tilt toward Greece, marked by annual joint military exercises, will likely only go so far for fear of antagonising Turkey. “You can imagine a whole bunch of scenarios where we back Greece, but nobody wants to go that route”, said a senior Trump administration official. “They come at a cost. You’re going to escalate with Turkey. And do you want that?”\n\nAthens’ push to threaten fresh economic sanctions and arms sales restrictions has met with mixed success among Turkey’s largest trading partners.\n\nAs for the EU, while Mitsotakis has sought to make Greek priorities European ones when it comes to Turkey, Athens’ push to threaten fresh economic sanctions and arms sales restrictions has met with mixed success among Turkey’s largest trading partners. Germany, Italy and Spain have commercial and security ties with Turkey. Germany, along with the “Visegrad group” of Poland, Hungary, the Czech Republic and Slovakia, also worries that Turkey could hit back by again allowing migrants into Europe. “They’ve been traumatised by the migrant crisis”, a Greek official complained. “They just say: ‘We’ll give you whatever you want’”. Others are wary of alienating a NATO ally that they wish to see better integrated with the bloc. “It’s a problem for us how much Turkey-EU relations got complicated by Turkey-Greece”, a European ambassador to Turkey said. “We want to park the Turkey-Greece and Cyprus issues”. An ambitious push by Mitsotakis to halt EU arms sales to Turkey at the peak of tensions in late 2020 went nowhere. German Chancellor Angela Merkel rebuffed the demand, which focused on planned delivery of six German Type 214 submarines that Athens fears will tip the balance of power toward Turkey.\n\nWhile Mitsotakis has voiced disappointment with the lack of European consensus behind tougher measures to deter Turkey’s sending ships to disputed waters, he has also stressed that sanctions are not an end in themselves. While Greek officials want a credible threat of sanctions, they also pushed the EU at the March summit to offer carrots in the form of smoother trade ties, high-level dialogue and continued cooperation on migration, including the renewal of a 2016 deal in which the EU offered Turkey financial help to host migrants and enforce border controls. “Only punishing Turkey would not lead to a good result”, one official said. In this respect, Athens differs from its most vocal supporters in the bloc – the Republic of Cyprus, Austria and France – who believe the softer touch may embolden Erdoğan. “With the Turkey of Erdoğan, only a show of power can change things”, an EU diplomat said, adding that not doing so would be read as weakness by other actors, such as Russia.\n\nFrance has deepened its strategic and defence cooperation with Greece and the Republic of Cyprus, in part to guard French oil major Total’s stake in seven parcels off the island, but primarily to express a set of disagreements with Turkey from Libya to the Sahel. It sent warships and planes to participate in two Greek naval exercises in August and December 2020, and joined another in April 2021. Recently, the French research vessel L’Atalante ventured south of Crete, west of the 28th meridian – an area, as noted above, claimed by both Greece and Turkey. The voyage, also replete with naval escort, drew a sharp reaction from Turkey, which dispatched its own warships to the area. Despite such manoeuvres, Greek and French diplomats say their positions in the EU Council are not fully aligned. Drawing a pointed contrast to Paris’ position, one Greek official said: “We are not in competition with Turkey over regional influence”.\n\nGreek officials walk an even finer line on aligning their stance with the Republic of Cyprus in EU deliberations. Greek politicians have traditionally seen their dispute with Turkey as inseparable from the Greek Cypriots’ problems with Ankara. More hawkish politicians portray any dialogue with Ankara as a betrayal of Nicosia as long as Turkey has troops on the island. That stance, strongest among the political old guard, has softened since Cyprus’ 2004 accession to the EU, replaced with a more pragmatic approach partly in response to a younger electorate worried about other issues. Mistotakis’ government wants, as far as possible, to decouple its problems with Ankara from those of Nicosia, fearing the latter could act as a spoiler in efforts at de-escalation. “The two things can be separated”, a Greek diplomat said. “We are not going to wait for this [the Cyprus] issue to be resolved, or we will be waiting forever to move on Turkish-Greek relations”.\n\nBut perhaps one of the most important aspects of Mitsotakis’ response has been what he has chosen not to do. Despite the pressure from dramatic media coverage – an element that has played a role in past escalations – officials are under orders “from the top” not to respond to bellicose Turkish rhetoric. The Greek government sometimes issues its statements on any of its manifold disagreements with Turkey with an intentional delay, insiders say, in part because Greece feels it has the upper hand diplomatically or believe Turkish officials are playing to a domestic audience. “We don’t want to get into a declaratory war”, a Greek diplomat said, while noting that the rhetorical restraint has come with a political cost. “We are even criticised for being too soft. It’s becoming increasingly difficult to justify”.\n\nWhile Mitsotakis is popular at home, he has come under attack for his approach in dealing with Turkey.\n\nWhile Mitsotakis is popular at home, he has come under attack for his approach in dealing with Turkey, particularly from his own party’s influential nationalist wing. Former Prime Minister Antonis Samaras says the resumption of talks with Turkey undercut the threat of EU sanctions. “You do not appease the expansionist”, he told the Greek daily Kathimerini. The jostling within the governing party is likely to grow ahead of an uncertain election in 2023 to be held under a new proportional representation system. To a lesser extent, the left-wing opposition parties Syriza and Kinal have also been putting pressure on the government to take a tougher stance, with former Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras calling for Greece to extend its territorial waters around Crete and Rhodes. Although over half of Greeks (54.2 per cent) prefer dialogue to a harsher stance against Turkey, according to a recent poll, a significant 30 per cent want no talks at all.\n\nThe public backlash to moderate statements by the Mitsotakis government illustrates the limits of its room to manoeuvre. In what a source close to de-escalation efforts dubbed a brave effort at dialogue, the prime minister broke from Greece’s official line by referring to areas plied by Turkish research vessels as “non-delimited waters” in an op-ed. All three opposition parties decried the comments as a concession, saying Mitsotakis had called into doubt the reach of Greece’s potential EEZ. A comparable outcry over comments perceived as contradicting the government’s line that Greek naval ships had managed to stop the Oruç Reis from further exploration caused the resignation of the former chief national security adviser, Alexandros Diakopoulos.\n\nDeep scepticism over Turkey’s commitment to dialogue also acts as a check on Greece. Many – including among Greece’s EU allies – see Turkey’s late 2020 change of tack as a ploy to delay sanctions. “We aren’t very optimistic”, a Greek diplomat said, adding that Athens expected Turkish officials to “push the margins as far as they can”. A series of actions by Ankara in the weeks between the October and December 2020 European Council meetings of EU leaders reinforced this suspicion. They included Turkey sending the Oruç Reis back out to sea; calling for a two-state solution in Cyprus; testing the Russian S-400 missile system; protesting German forces boarding a Turkish vessel as part of the EU’s Irini mission; and entering a war of words with French President Emmanuel Macron in the aftermath of terrorist attacks in France. As a result, Athens and its European allies want to see more than friendlier words from Turkey. “Ankara must stop sending us love letters and give us more concrete substance”, one EU official quipped.\n\nAs exploratory talks advance, some EU diplomats worry that Mitsotakis has little incentive to risk politically costly compromise. Entertaining Turkey’s request to discuss a partial or full demilitarisation of the eastern Aegean islands would, in the words of one expert, be “political suicide for any Greek government”. And on maritime rights, Greek officials see a ruling by the ICJ as the only face-saving option. “Kastellorizo has become emblematic”, one diplomat said. “You can’t try to sell compromise around that today after the year we experienced in 2020”.\n\nV. From Brinkmanship to Dialogue\n\nThe mid-2020 military confrontation thankfully did not slide into conflict, but that is not the same thing as de-escalation. High tensions between Greece and Turkey are still the new normal, with little trust or apparent desire for substantive negotiations to resolve their maritime dispute. Nevertheless, exploratory talks offer the best chance to move from brinkmanship to dialogue and for the two to test possible ways forward. So far, the sides have kept silent on the contents of talks and should continue to do so, as this policy can help keep the temperature down, especially as conversations enter a trickier phase in the coming months. Constructive dynamics in the following areas are essential to helping ensure that the return to talks is not derailed.\n\nA. Steer Clear of Red Lines and Provocations\n\nThe maritime rivals need to understand each other’s red lines and steer clear of them. Greek officials say Turkish redeployment of exploration vessels to disputed zones may be reason enough to halt the discussions. Ankara’s go-ahead on TPAO’s request to probe waters west of the 28th meridian, which Turkey claims under its 2019 deal with Libya, would be another. For its part, Ankara maintains that any move by Greece to extend its territorial seas along its mainland or from the coasts of Aegean islands would be cause for war. As such, Turkey is especially sensitive to any Greek statements asserting the right to do so. Greek military exercises held in or around the eastern Aegean islands that Ankara argues should be demilitarised are another sore spot. Both sides also complain about frequent overflights of military jets violating their claimed airspace.\n\nBeyond these top-line issues, both sides should work to avoid lower-level provocations. Each has already engaged in rhetoric or taken actions that the other says undercuts its commitment to renewed exploratory talks. On 25 January, on the same day as the first round of exploratory talks in five years, Athens hosted the French defence minister to mark the purchase of Rafale fighter jets. Hosting the Philia Forum of Turkey’s regional rivals days later caused ire: “It was very blatantly a show of ganging up against Turkey”, a Turkish official said. On the other hand, Greek officials were perplexed by what they viewed as a personal attack by Erdoğan on Mitsotakis over remarks calling Turkey’s presence in Cyprus an “occupation” – language Athens routinely uses, they said. They also gripe that Turkey did not respond to their proposed date for a 16 March meeting until after it had passed. The breadth of grievances at play was on full display when the two nations’ foreign ministers exchanged a volley of words at a meeting intended to reduce tensions on 15 April. They are due to meet again in Athens on 31 May.\n\nSuch low-level provocations may not scuttle talks, but they can dim long-term prospects for resolving the dispute by empowering hardliners on both sides and hardening public opinion. Each side complains that the other’s hostile rhetoric paints it into a corner; one Greek official, for example, said that only the pandemic trumped Turkey on the nightly news, while a Turkish official said it created “a vicious cycle of mutual distrust”. Perhaps of greater import to Ankara and Athens, respectively, their war of words may continue to irritate those outside powers that are eager to help keep a lid on tensions between the two NATO members. EU and U.S. officials are already sceptical of Ankara’s diplomatic overtures. Meanwhile, some of Athens’ EU allies are frustrated that Greece’s dispute with Turkey threatens to hijack the bloc’s strategic relations and economic interests. “Germany … is afraid of an ‘ice age’ in bilateral and EU-Turkey relations”, a German official said. “We are in favour of private diplomacy rather than swinging sticks to be able to come to a win-win outcome”.\n\nB. Avoiding the Worst\n\nThe 2020 crisis – and, indeed, past ones – show the need for renewed focus on military de-escalation and confidence-building measures. As relations have steadily grown worse, Greece and Turkey have built up their military presence in the eastern Mediterranean and the Aegean, each sending warships to shadow the other’s through disputed waters and warplanes to test the limits of each other’s skies. With more ships and planes coming closer to each other, every year brings incidents, from coast guard skirmishes to aerial dogfights. Mutual NATO membership acts as a useful check on military escalation. NATO meetings give the parties a platform to blow off steam and relatively neutral space to talk in the moderating presence of others. In addition, after months of full-scale deployment across the seas between them, they committed in early October 2020 to a de-confliction mechanism within NATO. But both say what is essentially a hotline between their chiefs of staff duplicates existing channels of communication and could prove an empty gesture if not used (which it does not appear to have been to date).\n\nGreece and Turkey could commit to de-escalation and avoid dangerous incidents by implementing existing CBMs. This means first working within the framework elaborated under U.S. and NATO mediation in the aftermath of the 1987 and 1996 crises. In addition, since exploratory talks began in 2002, the two countries have agreed some further 29 CBMs – some brokered at NATO meetings but most in bilateral talks. Some of the measures are routine practice, such as advance notification of military exercises and refraining from exercises during each other’s national holidays. Ankara and Athens, for instance, largely observed a 1988 moratorium on military exercises at the start of the summer tourist season, but the lull in visitors to both countries in 2020 due to the pandemic reduced the incentive for both to abide by it. Other measures, such as joint training, military exchanges and visits, are cosmetic but can nevertheless contribute to better ties.\n\nWhile Ankara and Athens agree the CBMs can be effective at defusing tensions, each accuses the other of violating them. In a glaring example, when an annual ten-day Greek military exercise fell on Turkey’s national holiday, on 29 October 2020, Ankara responded by planning drills on 28 October, Greece’s national day. Only after NATO’s intervention did both sides cancel their plans. In good times, Ankara and Athens have both participated in NATO exercises or held mock joint search-and-rescue exercises. But at others, they have struggled to advance such modest measures as academic cooperation between the countries’ military academies.\n\nA major step forward would be for Athens and Ankara to recommit to at least some existing CBMs. These could include avoiding blocking large sea and air areas for long periods and a moratorium on military exercises over the summer tourist season from 1 July to 1 September, as well as national and religious holidays. On the more ambitious end of the scale, joint air patrols could help reduce the risk of dogfights. Agreeing to mutually cancel planned military drills would be another show of good faith.\n\nC. Improving Bilateral Ties and Cooperation\n\nContact between Ankara and Athens outside of the exploratory talks and military-to-military channels is relatively limited. This climate of “communication by public statement”, in Greek officials’ words, makes for a fragile situation as each side tries to parse what may be intended for domestic consumption or meant as a signal where there is little mutual trust. Sensitivities are heightened around Cyprus, as seen in Ankara’s frustrated statements that followed Mitsotakis’ visit to the island after talks in January. The neighbours should try to improve bilateral ties by refocusing on areas of potential cooperation or shared concern, such as COVID-19 management, climate change, tourism, cultural exchange and economic cooperation.\n\nA face-to-face meeting between Erdoğan and Mitsotakis could go some way to resetting ties, but it would require careful preparation to avoid the testy exchanges of the past. At their first meeting in September 2019, “they did not click”, according to people close to the Greek prime minister. A second meeting in December of the same year did little to improve things. The two have not met since and have spoken by phone only three times in their entire tenures. In January, both leaders said they were ready to meet but backtracked after trading barbs.\n\nThere are undeniably hurdles. Greek diplomats fear there would be a domestic backlash from a leaders’ summit if it fails to achieve anything, with surveys showing the last leader-level meeting was poorly received. After foreign ministers agreed to restart exploratory talks in a meeting in October 2020, a Greek diplomat said, the Turks “stabbed us in the back again” by sending the Oruç Reis back out near Kastellorizo. “The cost of holding such a meeting is too high without anything positive”, another diplomat added. But other officials in Athens see a need to invest in changing the tone of relations. Turkish officials say they are not opposed, but they complain of a lack of positive response from the Greek side. Turkish officials say, for instance, that Ankara withdrew the Oruç Reis in August 2020 to “open a window for bilateral talks”, but that Greece responded by signing a delimitation deal with Egypt, prompting the ship’s redeployment.\n\nThe sides might also explore reviving the High-Level Cooperation Council, a bilateral body aimed at developing trade and cooperation in mundane matters. Turkish officials have expressed interest in doing so. From its inception in 2010 to 2016, the Council held four meetings with the participation of ministers and high-level bureaucrats from both sides. During the first four years the Council was active (2010-2014), trade between the Aegean neighbours almost doubled.\n\nD. Bringing a Constructive Attitude to Cyprus Talks\n\nWithout a constructive attitude toward UN efforts to rekindle dialogue about Cyprus, other efforts to reduce bilateral tensions are likely to hit a wall. On 27-29 April, the UN convened the first informal meeting with parties to the dispute on the divided island since talks collapsed in 2017. Representatives from Turkey and Greece, which alongside Britain were guarantors of Cyprus’ sovereignty upon its independence in 1960, attended the meeting in Geneva. The meeting served as a platform for the sides to table their positions but did not lead to a concrete outcome. Following three days of intense talks, UN Secretary-General António Guterres on 29 April said the parties had “not yet found enough common ground” and announced they had agreed to hold a second round of informal talks in the next “two to three months”. Just as progress in mediation on Cyprus would help ease Turkish-Greek tensions, de-escalation of the latter would facilitate the UN efforts.\n\nAs hopes for a breakthrough remain dim, Greek and European officials should encourage their Greek Cypriot counterparts to explore potential revenue-sharing arrangements with the de facto northern republic for gas drilling around the island – the lack of such arrangements is one of Turkey’s main grievances. The Republic of Cyprus and northern counterparts have put forth their proposals for a possible mechanism in the past and the issue could be taken up as a separate agenda item in UN-mediated talks or as part of a separate track on CBMs involving Greek and Turkish Cypriots. Doing so could offer Turkish Cypriots, who suffer most from the deadlock, a greater degree of agency and limit Turkey’s influence over the north. Coordination with London, which enjoys its own history of engagement with meditation efforts on the island, would be important in exploring such arrangements.\n\nTurkey and the Turkish Cypriot leadership, meanwhile, should refrain from inflammatory unilateral action on the island, such as the Turkish Cypriots’ February 2021 partial reopening of the abandoned beach town Maraş/Varosha, a fenced-off resort that has been a no-man’s land since 1974. Since 2019, Turkey has increasingly voiced its preference for a two-state solution – an idea that Greek Cypriots and Greece oppose. Neither side should prejudice renewed attempts at talks about a compromise political settlement by ruling out options.\n\nE. Outside Actors\n\nThough European leaders should seek U.S. help, they will need to shoulder much of the responsibility for finding ways to de-escalate tensions in their neighbourhood in which three EU member states are entangled. Bilateral diplomacy by Germany, France, Italy and other countries remains crucial, as the EU’s own influence over Ankara has atrophied along with the accession process and the bloc is hamstrung by its members’ differing approaches.\n\nTo be effective, Berlin and Paris must bridge their diverging views and advance policies together within the auspices of the EU. Neither is well placed to play the mediator alone, with neither viewed as a neutral party; the Greeks mistrust Berlin and the Turks feel the same of Paris. Forthcoming German elections in 2021 and France in 2022 bring their own uncertainties and could lead to changes in posture. France’s involvement in military exercises or more recently in exploration alongside Greece in disputed waters, as well as its push to join the East Mediterranean Gas Forum, has added to tensions at times when Berlin was engaged in talks aimed at reducing them. Paris would do well to compartmentalise its differences with Turkey in other areas and use its close ties with Athens to emphasise the importance of talks. Germany, meanwhile, should continue to use its economic and political leverage over Ankara to do the same. Italy, given its own energy interests and good relations with both camps, also has a role to play.\n\nFor its part, the Biden administration may prefer not to prioritise Turkey’s maritime dispute with Greece and Cyprus over other pressing bilateral issues, but it should not leave the Europeans to sort it out on their own. Washington has reason to be concerned about the implications of this dispute for the NATO alliance and regional stability, and the EU is no match in Turkey’s eyes for Washington’s weight within NATO and military assets in the Mediterranean basin, not to mention Ankara’s concern about the economic fallout from deteriorated U.S.-Turkey ties, which has contributed to the Turkish lira’s nosedive in the last few years.\n\nFor starters, European and U.S. diplomats should explore whether they can help create back channels between the sides. Between 2014 and 2016, Obama administration officials acted as an informal conduit for Nicosia, and to a lesser extent Athens, to pass on warnings to Turkish counterparts of announcements of new drilling licences. The Turks, in turn, issued strongly worded statements but refrained from sending research vessels and warships to disputed areas. “We had an early-warning system that worked”, former U.S. special energy envoy Amos Hochstein said of his role as a go-between. “I got messages from both the Turks and the Cypriots during the Trump administration, saying: ‘Hey, can you talk to the Americans about doing this again’, but there was nobody who wanted to do it”.\n\nInstitutionally, the EU faces some constraints in the role it can play, as many items on Ankara’s wish list – such as visa liberalisation and rejuvenated EU accession talks – are stalled because of Turkey’s democratic decline and the erosion of freedoms and rights. That said, at their March summit, EU leaders did hold out smoother trade relations and high-level political contacts in exchange for Ankara sustaining de-escalation in the eastern Mediterranean, including by sticking to talks with Greece and to UN-mediated talks on Cyprus as well as keeping its ships from disputed waters. “The European Union is ready to engage with Turkey in a phased, proportionate and reversible manner”, the summit conclusion underscored.\n\nThe European Council can also play a positive role through its forbearance when it comes to further sanctions. Some EU diplomats believe that the softening of Turkey’s rhetoric and the recalling of research vessels to port in late November 2020 signalled the effectiveness of threats of asset freezes and travel bans on individuals and entities responsible for or involved in drilling activities not authorised by the Republic of Cyprus. Yet the measures on the table were never more than symbolic, lacking the full support of the EU’s 27 states, and the imposition of sanctions in any form would create backlash in Ankara and feed into hardliners’ narratives. Threats of further sanctions should be reserved for major transgressions and tied to concrete, actionable and reversible measures. The EU executive did well to recommend any additional measures be “smart, scalable yet reversible” even in floating the possibility of restrictions on operations by EU financial institutions or targeting the tourism or energy sectors.\n\nStrong coordination between Washington and Brussels will be critical to picking apart the knot of regional rivalries and energy ambitions complicating the Turkish-Greek dispute.\n\nAdditionally, strong coordination between Washington and Brussels will be critical to picking apart the knot of regional rivalries and energy ambitions complicating the Turkish-Greek dispute. Together they should seek ways to end Turkey’s isolation in the region and to encourage a rethink of outdated gas development plans.\n\nOn the former, European Council President Charles Michel in late 2020 took up Ankara’s suggestion of a multilateral conference with other regional powers and has doggedly continued to pursue back-channel discussions about convening one despite the would-be participants’ deep scepticism. This idea, although it may never lead anywhere, is nevertheless a good example of the kind of imaginative policies and, above all, patience needed to inch toward a more stable situation. The initiative to give Turkey a seat at the table may be more gesture than substance, but it would help quiet Ankara’s growing fears about being isolated in the region.\n\nA more ambitious goal would be Turkey’s inclusion in the East Mediterranean Gas Forum. The idea faces too much resistance from members today, but it could become possible if Ankara’s push to restore ties with Egypt and Israel bears fruit. As it stands, Turkey has every incentive to obstruct developments it sees as dispelling its dreams to be a supply hub for Europe and diversify its own energy sources. Interference by Turkish vessels, the creation of legal and diplomatic hurdles through the Libya deal and the underlying risk of conflict add a non-negligible cost to pipeline plans. Efforts to include Turkey in regional forums would help address its geopolitical concerns. More than that, it makes market sense to include Turkey – hungry for gas to power the economy – in regional energy plans. From that economic perspective, its inclusion in the pipeline route would be a win-win.\n\nFor their part, rather than trumpet an unproven pipeline project, regional players should also revise their ambitions – a move that would seem to comport with market conditions. Record-low gas prices, a supply glut in Europe and new climate goals make the eastern Mediterranean less attractive than it once was. As the pandemic hit, ExxonMobil, Eni and Total postponed drilling in waters off Cyprus until 2021. Only Chevron continued exploration around the island. Moreover, the gas discoveries off Cyprus and Israel do not appear sufficient to justify laying what would be the world’s longest and one of its deepest underwater gas pipelines to pump supplies to Europe.\n\nAlthough the pipeline project’s owner IGI Poseidon, a joint Greek-Italian venture, says plans remain unchanged, arguing that gas is needed to power the first phase of the transition to a greener economy freer of coal, the €6 billion ($7.14 billion) East Med pipeline has yet to attract financing. The EU underwrote the project’s feasibility study in 2015, but today Brussels and the European Investment Bank have cut funding for oil and gas infrastructure they fear the bloc’s climate goals will make obsolete.\n\nThe U.S. and EU should refrain from full-throated backing of the pipeline project, which risks fuelling unfounded expectations among local actors, and encourage the parties to refocus on supplying gas to local markets and green energy alternatives. Doing so should help ease tensions by putting the stakes squarely into perspective. Meanwhile, Turkey’s own discoveries of Black Sea gas appear to be more profitable and viable than access to the uncertain future of the eastern Mediterranean resources. Its costly eastern Mediterranean drilling exploration program has been singularly unsuccessful: all seven wells that Turkey has drilled there have come up dry.\n\nVI. Conclusion\n\nGreek-Turkish conflict in the eastern Mediterranean is unlikely but not entirely unthinkable. Fear of such an escalation, economic woes and concerns about damage to their respective ties with other regional powers have pushed Athens and Ankara back to exploratory talks for now. A united transatlantic front on the eastern Mediterranean can help motivate both Greece and Turkey to remain at the table. The talks offer a small opening to break out of the cycle of coercive diplomacy and military brinksmanship. Failure to keep them going, however, would likely result in a worse standoff than that in mid-202o, eroding what little trust exists between the two countries and strengthening the hand of those in both who would eschew diplomacy altogether.\n\nAnkara/Athens/Washington/Brussels, 31 May 2021\n\nAppendix A: Map of Maritime Delimitation Areas"
