        "text": "Aaron got his first taste of creating 3D environments while he was studying engineering at UCLA. He was building VRML websites for the university, and also started designing levels for several internet mods. His level design skills landed him a job at Xatrix Entertainment where he worked on Redneck Rampage, Quake 2, and Kingpin before joining Valve in 1999 to work on Half-Life 2.\n\nGrowing up in Belgium, Bram got hooked on game development making levels for Duke Nukem 3D and Half-life at a young age. After getting a start in the games industry working at various companies in the Netherlands and Sweden, he moved to the United States to help create Overwatch at Blizzard Entertainment. With his roots in the modding community, he now feels at home at Valve, where he spends most of his time obsessing over efficient UV layouts.\n\nChris received his Bachelor's of Fine Arts with an emphasis in Animation and Medical Illustration. After working in the Biomedical field for several years as a 3d artist and traditional illustrator, he went on to work in the film industry as a Look/Dev and Texture Artist, working on films such as Avatar. He has now been at Valve as an artist since 2010 working on all things art related, from character design and environment concepting, to video game trailer production.\n\nAt the age of 6, after a chance encounter with the artist Phil Tippett, Eric had the opportunity to view many of the original models following the release of Return of the Jedi, which set him on course to coloring, building, drawing, and creating with any and all materials in his path. If only his younger self would have ever known what would someday follow as a career. In the years as an artist with Valve, Eric has contributed to the visual design of games including Half-Life 2, Team Fortress 2, Dota 2 and other Valve titles.\n\nJason worked on British comics 2000ad and Judge Dredd Megazine as well as concept art for many games. His free time was spent mostly âenhancingâ (other people’s) property with spray paint. Jason eventually skipped town and now resides near Seattle where he does all manner of arting at Valve and no longer pursues his extra-curricular activities in any way shape or form. Honest.\n\nMatt is and Artist and Designer from the UK city of Nottingham. After spending the first 10 years of his career working at studios in the UK and Canada, Matt joined Valve in 2008. He got straight to work crafting character art and for Left 4 Dead 2, Portal 2, Dota 2 and The Lab and has most recently shipped Half-Life: Alyx.\n\nThiago received his Bachelor's of Architecture and Urban Planning at the University of Sao Paulo - Brazil.He has a passion for learning and started his videogame journey modding Quake back in the 90s. At Valve, he has been working in many different roles like Modeling, Animation, and VFX.In his personal life, he enjoys bladesmithing, racing motorcycles, and transforming his house into a jungle.\n\nView Steam Profile\n\nTristan earned a degree in transportation design. After a dipping a toe into industrial design, he found his way into making models for games, eventually landing at Valve to help with Half Life 2, Episode 2. Since then He's been delighted to get away with building all sorts of models and art for Portal 2, Left 4 Dead, Team fortress 2, among others. Outside of Valve, Tristan enjoys the decision paralysis that comes from making art and models in the real world where there is no Ctrl Z.\n\nMorasky's life and career sounds a lot like one of the post-modern audio collages he is so fond of creating. Teenage guitar player in a bar band in Montana; award-winning experimental composer in Tokyo; audio hardware programmer in Silicon Valley; underground art rocker touring the world; 3D animator and director for television; electronic audio collage artist in France and Japan; visual fx artist on The Lord of the Rings and Matrix trilogies; AI animation instructor at an art college. These days, Mike is doing some combination of all these things at Valve.\n\nAs a freelance composer and musician, Tim has done it all. He played trumpet for the likes of Ella Fitzgerald, Sheila E., Lou Rawls, Huey Lewis, James Brown, and Natalie Cole; recorded numerous records, movies, documentaries, and TV shows (including Survivor and Fear Factor 2.0) as a studio musician; created the sound design for The Chubbchubbs!, a 2003 Academy Award winner for Best Animated Short Film; and as Audio Director at Cyan studio for eight years, created the music and sound for the Myst series. Now, he's here at Valve, where he's worked on just about every title the company has shipped. When he's not working, Tim is playing tennis, fly fishing, or commuting back and forth to his home and family in Spokane, WA.\n\nAs a music major, Tobin looked forward to a career in food service. Instead, he spent most of his twenties touring and recording with Robert Fripp and The League of Crafty Guitarists, which led, somehow inevitably, to Microsoft in 1996, where he worked on Interactive Music Architecture (DirectMusic) and as an Audio Director at Microsoft Game Studios, primarily with FASA. Tobin joined Valve in 2008 and is blown away every day that, in addition to doing audio production on some of the coolest projects in the whole wide world, he's allowed to tinker with the audio calls in the game code, and encouraged to learn more about that side of the process every day.\n\nThe bulk of my childhood and young adult life revolved around working to become a better golfer. After a mostly unsuccessful playing career, I spent a few years coaching collegiate golf teams and then transitioned indoors to work on the Tiger Woods PGA Tour games at Electronic Arts. During my time at EA, I worked in the EA Partners Group where we helped Valve ship The Orange Box, Left 4 Dead, Left 4 Dead 2 and Portal 2 on console and into retail. I started at Valve in 2010, working as a member of the Business Development Team and focusing on Steam, Partner relationships, Hardware and VR among many other things. Mostly unsuccessful is still a good description of my golf game.\n\nTom is a graduate of the University of Washington Foster School of Business and a former high school teacher. He has worked at Valve since 2012. Tom spends his days on the Steam Business team. One part of that work is making Steam a better platform for customers to buy and play games. The other part is helping game developers make the most of Steam's tools, features, and opportunities.\n\nRogue Canadian masquerading as a software engineer, designer, and whatever else they let me get away with. Please note: Valve Employees will never ask you for personal or account information, on Steam or anywhere else. You can safely ignore anyone who claims to have mistakenly reported you - that will not get you banned.

He’s been a gamer since his parents bought their Commodore 64. As a high-schooler he made small Quake mods and became addicted to Team Fortress. After graduating, his brother introduced him to the guys on the Day of Defeat team. They wanted to ship their mod, but they needed animation help. John jumped in. Valve eventually invited John and the rest of the team to continue DoD development at Valve’s offices. At this point, John has worked on nearly every product we've shipped. His TF obsession is over - replaced by an addiction to DotA, and lapping his Ducati at local road courses.\n\nBefore joining Valve in 2010 as a Level Designer and Artist, Ken Banks previously worked on titles including Doom 3, Quake 4, and Borderlands. His career was inspired by his first real gaming experience on the PC, Valve's Half-Life, in 1998. He became established in Half-Life's flourishing mod community as a contributor to the successful Natural-Selection, which helped launch his career into game development at the age of 18.\n\nMatt is and Artist and Designer from the UK city of Nottingham. After spending the first 10 years of his career working at studios in the UK and Canada, Matt joined Valve in 2008. He got straight to work crafting character art and for Left 4 Dead 2, Portal 2, Dota 2 and The Lab and has most recently shipped Half-Life: Alyx.\n\nAs a paint fixer and rotoscope artist at the legendary Tippett Studio, Matthew painted a pimple out of Darryl Hannah's armpit for My Favorite Martian and rotoscoped Kevin Bacon in a black bodysuit for Hollowman. He moved on to legendary Weta Digital to work as an animator and animation lead for The Lord of the Rings trilogy. He came to legendary Valve from Los Angeles where he was the animation supervisor on The Chronicles of Narnia; The Lion The Witch and the Wardrobe, the longest title of any film he's ever worked on. He's now animating on Dota 2. Matthew had been eyeing Valve for awhile and is happy to report that he and his family like Seattle much better than LA, although the weather reminds him of that Ray Bradbury short story (All Summer in a Day) where the sun only comes out for two hours every seven years.\n\nMiles began his career at Foundation Imaging in Southern California as a character animator on the Starship Troopers TV series. Shortly thereafter, he got his start in games - lead animator for Interplay's PS2 game Run Like Hell. Upon joining Valve in 2001, Miles was inhumanely forced to participate in company playtests. As a result, he developed an addiction to Counter-Strike, despite the fact that he was really bad at it. He has since overcome his addiction and contributes character modeling and/or animation to a lot of Valve games. His hobbies include lamenting over the fact that he's not drawing enough.\n\nTristan earned a degree in transportation design. After a dipping a toe into industrial design, he found his way into making models for games, eventually landing at Valve to help with Half Life 2, Episode 2. Since then He's been delighted to get away with building all sorts of models and art for Portal 2, Left 4 Dead, Team fortress 2, among others. Outside of Valve, Tristan enjoys the decision paralysis that comes from making art and models in the real world where there is no Ctrl Z.\n\nUnlike most people at Valve, Amy was actually born and raised right here in Washington, on Whidbey Island. And like all native Washingtonians talking to transplants, she will remind you of this fact roughly twice a minute in any given conversation. After many years working at Zillow, Amy took a break from work to enjoy time with her family and learn how to cook some bucket list foods, like Beef Wellington and Lasagna Bolognese from scratch. Years later, sitting in her kitchen surrounded by pans of Beef Wellington, Amy realized it was either time to pick some new foods or get back to work. Since joining Valve Amy has found a second family. She gets the opportunity to work with exceptionally talented and incredibly kind people every day, and to spend every day helping to make their experience at Valve better. When she’s not working, Amy’s favorite passion is to travel. Be sure to ask her about Utila next time you see her!\n\nRight before joining Valve in 2010, Elizabeth worked for Gracenote(a Subsidiary of Sony). Elizabeth is a graduate of California State University, Chico (with a concentration in Human Resources). Please note: Valve Employees will never ask you for personal or account information, on Steam or anywhere else. If you need help with your Steam account, go to https://help.steampowered.com/.\n\nAlden has a habit of ending up in the middle of everything. If he isn't getting in the way of Steam game releases, he's probably working on UI design for Valve games or the Steam store. Alden came to Valve after working on design and production for the Xbox 360 Dashboard. Before that, he studied design at the University of Washington and worked on various freelance design projects. When he's not working, Alden can be found chasing his competitive ambitions in cycling and swimming. He commutes to work by swimming back and forth across Lake Washington every day. Most weekends, he relaxes by riding his bike to Portland. Twice.\n\nView Steam Profile\n\n\"Q!\" brings over 10 years of multi-disciplinary graphic design experience to Valve. He has had a creative role in launching print, online, and new media endeavors as a senior art director for Incite PC Gaming magazine, art director for PC Accelerator, and associate art director for PC Gamer. At Valve, you can find Q!'s schedule filled with marketing, packaging, web design, game trailers, .dem file creation, and other visual communications tasks. In his spare time, Q! likes to reminisce about how he was training to be a competitive bodybuilder 14 years ago. Get over it, already!\n\nAs a child, Brian learned how to program by cracking all the computer games he couldn't afford to buy. As an adult, he decided to join the games industry as a way to make up for his reprehensible childhood. At LookingGlass, he worked on Flight Unlimited. He went on to co-found GameFX, and was a Lead Engineer on Sinistar Unleashed. He joined Valve in 2000 and has contributed to just about everything the company has shipped since then. Brian focuses mostly on engine and graphics technology, with the occasional foray into game design.\n\nAnother Fort Walton Beach, Florida native, Charlie graduated from the University of Florida in the summer of 1994 and headed for California and 3Dfx Interactive. His responsibilities there included developer support, porting products to hardware, sample code, simple demos, and ultimately working with the 3Dfx developer relations team to manage the engineering game porting effort. Charlie left 3Dfx after two years and, with his college friend Gary McTaggart, created the Uber(tm) Engine at Ritual Entertainment in Dallas, Texas. Not long after joining Ritual, Charlie and Gary left to start their own company. Not long after that, Valve made Charlie (and Gary) an offer \"they couldn't refuse.\"\n\nChris started his career at Looking Glass, working on sound and physics for the Thief Series, and later the sequel to Deus Ex at Ion Storm. Since joining Valve he's worked on chainsaws and jockeys and spell-stealing wizards and machines that make suggestions for Steam and Dota 2.He will never contact you on Discord.\n\nHaving spent his early years between Georgia, Alabama, and Texas, by the end of college Colby was ready to escape the hot, humid weather of the South and jumped on an opportunity to move to the Seattle area and join Microsoft. Then, in 2018, he scored his dream job as an engineer at Valve and has been enjoying every minute of it.\n\nDrew joined Valve in 2018 to work on all things VR, and later dove head-first into building Steam Deck.Originally from \"near Philadelphia\", he graduated from Rochester Institute of Technology having worked at Microsoft (Windows) and Google (Tilt Brush, Google Flights). If he manages to peel a VR headset off his face, it's probably because he has an indie concert to attend or an evening of scuba diving in the many waters of wet Seattle.NOTE: Drew does not have a Discord, so he is definitely not reaching out to you on Discord. Nor is any other Valve employee, ever.\n\nRogue Canadian masquerading as a software engineer, designer, and whatever else they let me get away with.

Before that, he developed titles for Sony Playstation & 3DO. Way before that, he wrote his first computer game (at age 9) and had a game published in a magazine (at age 15). A native of Cajun Country, Jay finds Northwest buildings too hot (what, no air conditioning?) and the food not hot enough.\n\nJoe joined Valve as a programmer in 2009 and has spent his time working on item back ends, trading systems, virtual reality, and hats. These days he is helping out with the software side of Valve's hardware effort. Though he started his game industry career at Sierra in 1998, most of the intervening time was spend on trains and pirate ships during his nine years at Flying Lab software. Before that, he was never in Anthrax, no matter what you may have heard on the internet.\n\nJohn spent his post college graduate years at a struggling Web 2.0 startup, lured in by the illusion of stock option riches. Since arriving at Valve, he's landed on the Steam team where he works on a little bit of everything, from Shopping Carts to the in-game Overlay. His favorite thing about Valve is having a huge, energetic user base, which benefits from the work he does on Steam.\n\nScott began playing and designing games at an early age on an Atari 800 and never looked back. He came to Valve after creating games at Legend Entertainment for many years. Aside from level design and game mechanics, he delights in creating particle effects and programming the system that drives them. When not making worlds come to life, he's usually making them explode, bleed, and burn. He helped to spin up the hardware teams at Valve and currently is working on the Steam Controller.\n\nA bit of an odd-ball, Sergiy joined Valve to do weird low-level stuff and squeeze more blood, um, juice out of the silicon in your gaming machines. Sergiy specializes in systems programming, physics, and applied math. According to him, some games pretend to be simulating physicsy-looking motion. Sergiy made the physics engine behind Uncharted: Drake's Fortune while at Naughty Dog, and the animation system in Far Cry during his lazy years at Crytek. There were a few other odd jobs here and there, but the list is long and boring, and mostly lost in the eons that have passed.\n\nTaylor joined Valve in 2001 to help develop Steam, and has been part of that team ever since. His previous experience ranges from DVD emulation to air combat simulators for the military. He has a Bachelor's degree in electrical engineering from The Cooper Union in New York City. In his spare time, Taylor enjoys photography, playing bass and guitar, and staring at maps.\n\nVitaliy grew up in the Soviet Union. He earned two Master's degrees (with honors) and a lieutenant rank. He solved thousands of differential equations systems, then architected and implemented software that has probably processed petabytes of binary data by now. And then, he moved to Santa Monica to help Sony lay the foundation for PlayStation-3. Vitaliy joined Valve in 2006 and helped us ship The Orange Box, our first Xbox 360 game. He went on to establish our matchmaking system, implement the PlayStation-3 version of our engine, and design and improve our numerous back-end systems.\n\nYahn was an Atlanta patent lawyer with a degree in chemistry from Harvard. So obviously he ended up in Seattle developing computer games. He taught himself to program at the age of 12 and has worked on the systems code and tools for most of Valve's titles.\n\nJay Pinkerton is a comedy writer who fell into game writing completely accidentally fifteen years ago and has been waiting for somebody to notice ever since. Prior to joining Valve, Jay ping-ponged around the industry working with very nice people on games that were worked very hard on and then shelved forever. Prior to that he was an editor at the then-resurrected Cracked.com, and helped get that online. Prior to that he was Managing Editor of the National Lampoon. Prior to that he was mostly freelance writing, which is a professional way of saying he starved for a living. Prior to that he was a child, then a baby, and then hadn’t existed yet. That pretty much catches you up.\n\nAlireza moved to Canada (via Iran and Turkey) when he was nine. His first impressions of the west were the films TRON, Die Hard, and Lawnmower Man. Inspired by this trinity of action, art, and science he chose a career in 3D animation and visual effects. After earning a Bachelor's and a post-graduate degree in animation from Sheridan Institute of Technology, Ali went to London to start work on his first film. He was 24. He now works at Valve where he drives the effort to transform visual effects into a dynamic interactive experience - and blows stuff up.\n\nDavid developed telecommunications software in Boulder, Colorado before he came to Valve. During his time here he's been a programmer/designer and cabal lead on Half-Life 2 and Half-Life 2: Episode Two. He has also worked quite a lot on our Hammer level editor over the years. A fan of recreational physical suffering, David goes rock climbing in his spare time. He has dragged many a pale and shaking Valve employee along on adventures in vertiginous terror.\n\nEric joined Valve in 2000 after graduating from the DigiPen Institute of Technology in Redmond, WA. Before DigiPen, he worked for Nintendo of America. But when DigiPen opened its doors in the U.S. in January 1998, Eric saw an opportunity to change careers and make games instead of just playing them.\n\nErik began his career as a shoe salesman and moved up to selling used cars. When he decided that the car business wasn't for him either, he took a job in Sierra Online's QA department. As one of Sierra's Half-Life testers, Erik spent a lot of time at Valve and we eventually offered him a job as shipping manager. Erik is now one of Valve's business development authorities.\n\nGabe held a number of positions in the Systems, Applications, and Advanced Technology divisions during his 13 years at Microsoft. His responsibilities included running program management for the first two releases of Windows, starting the company's multimedia division, and leading efforts on the Information Highway PC. Then he started Valve. His most significant contribution to Half-Life, the company’s debut title, was his statement: \"C'mon, people, you can't show the player a really big bomb and not let them blow it up.\"\n\nAfter eight years leading ATI's 3D Application Research Group, Jason was finally seduced by the entertainment industry and joined Valve in 2005. He has worked on a variety of projects, from real-time rendering to Source Filmmaker to the Steam iOS client and, most recently, VR game programming on Half-Life: Alyx. He has even gotten to apply his latent CAD skills by modeling and texturing props for Left 4 Dead 2 and designing puzzles and gameplay spaces for Half-Life: Alyx.\n\nLiam showed early promise in his summer job at General Motors making car transmissions. Twice, GM and the UAW awarded him a Certificate of Perfect Attendance. But Liam left the assembly line for the classroom, teaching college and junior high math until a professor named Yau (that would be the Fields Medal-winning Shing-Tung Yau) convinced him to look for other work. Liam's interest in understanding the rules that govern society led him to law school, and then to Seattle's K&L Gates firm where he specialized in technology and business law and worked with a number of game companies, including Valve. Right before joining Valve, Liam served as general counsel of Zillow.com.\n\nSara is one of those odd ducks who decided she wanted to be in Human Resources when she was attending college at the University of Washington. She received an internship in HR with BECU, and began working for them full time once she graduated. From there she went on to work for Zillow, and now she is lucky enough to be a part of Valve's Human Resources team.\n\nBefore joining Valve, Scott was Senior Vice President at Havas Interactive where he created and managed the Sierra Studios business unit that published Half-Life. During his five years with Sierra, Scott held a number of different positions in business development, acquisitions, finance, investor relations, and product development. Before Sierra, Scott worked in the public accounting industry for Coopers & Lybrand. In both the audit and tax departments, he managed a range of clients, from small start-ups to Fortune 500 companies. Scott is a graduate of the University of Washington Business School (with a concentration in accounting), and is an inactive Certified Public Accountant in the State of Washington."
