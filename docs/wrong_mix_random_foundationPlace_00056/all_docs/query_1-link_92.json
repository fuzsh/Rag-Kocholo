        "text": "Writing this post to warn everyone about a new type of scam that I nearly fell for i.e. the personal assistant scam.\n\nSomeone named Sara Wars phoned me to tell me about a position at Take It Easy Personal Concierge where they are looking for someone to run errands for their clients in Toronto.\n\nI was intrigued as this would be a good way to make some extra cash while in-between jobs.\n\nShe was very keen to get me onboard and pretty much said she would like me to start the following day, something about an initial payment for $450, sending over some cheques to help pay for whatever it is they needed me to do (such as buy some items from the nearest convenience store, go to the post office to send parcels etc.) and that I would receive a “corporate package” the following morning to get me started.\n\nWithout giving me much choice to say yes or no or ask too many questions the call was done and I decided to wait till this so called package arrived. In the mean time (since the voice in my head was saying what the hell) I tried to find out as much as possible about the company and it was indeed a legitimate company with a good enough web presence.\n\nThe following day the package arrived and I was in shock to receive a bank draft for CAD 5,000 which I was expected to deposit in my account with a “welcome letter”. It was pure luck that they had misspelled my name on the cheque so I called to inform them and they said not to worry, they will send a new one the following working day.\n\nThis gave me some time to really think about the facts.\n\nThe welcome letter had multiple typos and the addresses and phone numbers did not match the ones on the company website. Plus the call was by Sara, the cheques were signed by a David and the letter was signed by a Susan. [Retrospectively none of it added up but seeing as they used a real company and communicated over the phone it still look me some time to digest the above].\n\nI started researching scams online and found multiple experiences from others who had fallen for it. How once you deposit the cheque, the amount will be visible, however in a few days once the draft will be validated, it will be considered fake and you will end up paying the $5,000 back to the bank!\n\nBy this time they would have asked you to buy and send items to their “clients” for the same amount which means they would have gotten their money back and avoided detection of possible money laundering since it has now gone through a middle man i.e. me.\n\nThat of course made me nervous and I sent them a message saying that I will need to validate the bank draft before depositing it to my account as I will not take the chance of it bouncing at a later date and being liable to which they were surprisingly understanding and said their drafts can be validated on the spot at any leading bank in Canada [wow].\n\nI needed to find out once and for all so I did the only thing that came into my head that would give me an answer. I looked up the CEO of Take It Easy on LinkedIn, told her about the situation and asked her if they are hiring. Luckily she responded not long after saying there is a scam going around and that she didn’t know any of those names and that she is indeed not hiring.\n\nSara Wars was dealt with accordingly.\n\nI know there are plenty of scams out there but this one was particularly infuriating to me because not only were they being smart by referencing a real company and avoiding email contact - they are preying on individuals who are eagerly searching for a job. Someone who is in a hurry might not even have taken the time to do all the research that I did.\n\nHence I just had to put this out there with some key takeaways:\n\n- No one would send large amounts of money to someone they had one phone conversation with\n\n- If it's too good to be true, it most likely is\n\n- If you are not sure even in the slightest do you research and ask questions!"
