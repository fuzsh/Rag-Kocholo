I use the shuttle ride to catch up on email and read the news (the buses have wi-fi so it’s like being on a rolling office).\n\n8:00 AM: Grab cereal and tea at work. I’ve learned to avoid the cafes, which serve bacon and eggs every morning, because the “Google 15” is no joke.\n\n9:00 AM: Lead our daily editorial meeting where we go through the calendar and talk about any corresponding programs we have planned on Google+.\n\n10:04 AM: Watch a video of Congressman John Lewis dancing to Pharrell’s “Happy” on YouTube and share it with my colleague who manages YouTube Nation, YouTube’s new daily show about trending videos."
