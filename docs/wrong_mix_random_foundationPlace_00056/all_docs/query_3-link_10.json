Vinson[1] that workplace harassment can constitute unlawful discrimination under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. More than thirty-seven years later, harassment remains a serious workplace problem. Between the beginning of fiscal year (FY) 2018 and the end of FY 2022, thirty-five percent of the charges of employment discrimination received by the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (“the Commission” or “EEOC”) included an allegation of harassment based on race, sex, disability, or another protected characteristic.[2] The actual cases behind these numbers reveal that many people still experience harassment that may be unlawful. The “#MeToo” movement brought renewed public focus on sexual harassment at work,[3] and racial harassment cases have remained prominent in recent years.[4]\n\nAlthough many high-profile harassment cases involve harassment based on sex, race, or national origin, the EEOC also enforces laws prohibiting work-related harassment based on color, religion, disability, genetic information, and age (40 or over). This Commission-approved enforcement guidance presents a legal analysis of standards for harassment and employer liability applicable to claims of harassment under the equal employment opportunity (“EEO”) statutes enforced by the Commission.[5] This guidance also consolidates, and therefore supersedes, several earlier EEOC guidance documents: Compliance Manual Section 615: Harassment; Policy Guidance on Current Issues of Sexual Harassment (1990); Policy Guidance on Employer Liability under Title VII for Sexual Favoritism (1990); Enforcement Guidance on Harris v. Forklift Sys., Inc. (1994); and Enforcement Guidance on Vicarious Employer Liability for Unlawful Harassment by Supervisors (1999). This document serves as a resource for staff of the Commission and may be helpful to other agencies that investigate, adjudicate, or litigate harassment claims, or that conduct outreach; for employers, employees, and practitioners; and for courts deciding harassment issues. Nothing in this document should be understood to prejudge the outcome of a specific charge filed with the EEOC.\n\nAs with any charge of discrimination filed with the EEOC, the Commission will evaluate claims alleging unlawful harassment based on all the facts and circumstances of the particular matter and the law. This document is not intended to be an exhaustive survey of all legal principles that might be appropriate in a particular case. The contents of this document do not have the force and effect of law and are not meant to bind the public in any way. This document is intended only to provide clarity to the public regarding existing requirements under the law or Commission policies.[6]\n\nB. Structure of this Guidance\n\nIn explaining how to evaluate whether harassment violates federal EEO law, this enforcement guidance focuses on the three components of a harassment claim:\n\nCovered Bases and Causation: Was the conduct based on the individual’s legally protected characteristic under the federal EEO statutes?\n\nDiscrimination with Respect to a Term, Condition, or Privilege of Employment: Did the harassing conduct result in discrimination with respect to a term, condition, or privilege of employment?\n\nLiability: Is there a basis for holding the employer liable for the conduct?\n\nThis guidance also addresses systemic harassment and provides links to other EEOC harassment-related resources, including Promising Practices for Preventing Harassment, a resource to assist employers in preventing and addressing harassment.\n\nII. Covered Bases and Causation\n\nHarassment is covered by the EEO laws only if it is based on an employee’s legally protected characteristics.\n\nThe federal EEO laws prohibit workplace harassment if it is shown to be based on one or more of a complainant’s characteristics that are protected by these statutes.[7] Section II.A. of this guidance identifies these legally protected characteristics, and § II.B. explains how to determine whether harassing conduct is because of them.\n\nA. Covered Bases\n\nRace and color: Race-based harassment includes harassment based on a complainant’s race, e.g., harassment because the complainant is Black, Asian American, white, or multiracial.[8] Examples of harassing conduct based on race include racial epithets or offensive comments about members of a particular race, or harassment based on stereotypes about the complainant’s race.[9] It also can include harassment based on traits or characteristics linked to an individual’s race, such as the complainant’s name, cultural dress, accent or manner of speech, and physical characteristics, including grooming practices (e.g., harassment based on hair textures and hairstyles commonly associated with specific racial groups).[10] Color-based harassment includes harassment based on skin tone.[11]\n\nExample 1: Color-based Harassment. Shawn, a Pakistani-American with brown skin, files a charge of discrimination alleging that two of his direct supervisors have subjected Shawn to unlawful harassment based on color. Shawn alleges that on a near-daily basis, his supervisors call him “turd” and otherwise make comments to him that suggest his skin is the color of human feces. According to Shawn, one supervisor exited the bathroom, placed a cup containing feces on Shawn’s desk, and stated the feces looked like Shawn. Based on these facts, Shawn has alleged harassment based on color.[12]\n\nNational origin: National origin harassment includes ethnic epithets, derogatory comments about individuals of a particular nationality, and other harassment based on a complainant’s, or the complainant’s ancestors’, place of origin. It also includes harassment based on stereotypes about the complainant’s national origin.[13] It can include harassment regarding traits or characteristics linked to an individual’s national origin, such as physical characteristics (e.g., skin tone), cultural characteristics (e.g., attire or diet), and linguistic characteristics (e.g., non-English language accent or a lack of fluency in English).[14]\n\nReligion: Religious harassment includes the use of religious epithets or offensive comments based on a complainant’s religion (including atheism or lack of religious belief[15]), religious practices, or dress.[16] It also includes harassment based on religious stereotypes[17] and harassment because of a request for a religious accommodation or receipt of a religious accommodation.[18] It further encompasses coercing employees to engage in religious practices at work.[19]\n\nSex: Harassment based on sex includes unwanted sexual attention or sexual coercion, such as demands or pressure for sexual favors, sexual assault, or sexual remarks.[20]\n\nHarassment based on sex also includes non-sexual conduct based on sex,[21] such as sex-based epithets (for example, calling a colleague a ‘‘c__t’’), sexist comments (such as making comments that women do not belong in management or that men do not belong in nursing), or facially sex-neutral offensive conduct motivated by sex (such as bullying directed toward employees of a particular sex).[22]\n\nExample 2: Sex-Based Harassment. John, an employee in a supermarket bakery department, alleges that a coworker, Laverne, rubs up against him in a sexual manner, tells sexual jokes, and displays dolls made from dough in sexual positions. Based on these facts, John has alleged harassment based on his sex.\n\nExample 3: Sex-Based Harassment. Aiko, a construction worker on a road crew, alleges that she was subjected to unlawful sex-based harassment by her supervisor, who used sex-based epithets and disparaged women’s participation in the construction industry. Based on these facts, Aiko has alleged harassment based on sex.\n\nSex-based harassment also includes harassment based on:\n\nPregnancy, Childbirth, or Related Medical Conditions: Sex-based harassment includes harassment based on pregnancy,[23] childbirth, or related medical conditions,[24] including lactation.[25] This also can include harassment based on a woman’s reproductive decisions, such as decisions about contraception[26] or abortion.[27]\n\nSexual Orientation and Gender Identity: Sex-based discrimination includes discrimination based on sexual orientation and gender identity.[28] Accordingly, sex-based harassment includes harassment on the basis of sexual orientation and gender identity, including how that identity is expressed.[29] Examples include epithets regarding sexual orientation or gender identity;[30] physical assault;[31] harassment because an individual does not present in a manner that would stereotypically be associated with that person’s gender;[32] intentional and repeated use of a name or pronoun inconsistent with the individual’s gender identity (misgendering);[33] or the denial of access to a bathroom or other sex-segregated facility consistent with the individual’s gender identity.[34]\n\nExample 4: Harassment Based on Gender Identity. Jennifer, a cashier at a fast food restaurant who identifies as female, alleges that supervisors, coworkers, and customers regularly and intentionally misgender her. One of her supervisors, Allison, frequently uses Jennifer’s prior male name, male pronouns, and “dude” when referring to Jennifer, despite Jennifer’s request for Allison to use her correct name and pronouns; other managers also intentionally refer to Jennifer as “he.” Coworkers have asked Jennifer questions about her sexual orientation and anatomy and asserted that she was not female. Customers also have intentionally misgendered Jennifer and made threatening statements to her, but her supervisors did not address the harassment and instead reassigned her to duties outside of the view of customers. Based on these facts, Jennifer has alleged harassment based on her gender identity.[35]\n\nAge: Age-based harassment includes harassment of employees 40 or older because of their age.[36] This includes harassment based on negative perceptions about older workers.[37] It also includes harassment based on stereotypes about older workers, even if they are not motivated by animus, such as pressuring an older employee to transfer to a job that is less technology-focused because of the perception that older workers are not well-suited to such work or encouraging an older employee to retire.[38]\n\nDisability:[39] Disability-based harassment includes harassment based on the complainant’s physical or mental disability.[40] This includes harassment based on stereotypes about individuals with disabilities in general or about an individual’s particular disability. It also can include harassment based on traits or characteristics linked to an individual’s disability, such as how an individual speaks, looks, or moves.[41]\n\nDisability-based harassment also includes:\n\nharassment because of an individual’s request for, or receipt of, reasonable accommodation;[42]\n\nharassment because an individual is regarded as having an impairment, even if the individual does not have an ADA actual or record of disability;[43]\n\nharassment because an individual has a record of a disability, even if the individual currently does not have a disability;[44] and\n\nharassment based on the disability of an individual with whom the complainant is associated.[45]\n\nGenetic information: Harassment on the basis of genetic information includes harassment based on a complainant’s, or a complainant’s family member’s, genetic test or based on a complainant’s family medical history.[46] For example, harassment based on genetic information includes harassing an employee because the employee carries the BRCA gene, which is linked to an increased risk of breast and ovarian cancer, or because the employee’s mother has cancer.\n\nHarassment based on the perception that an individual has a particular protected characteristic, for example, the belief that a person has a particular national origin or religion, is covered by federal EEO law even if the perception is incorrect. [47] Thus, harassment of a Hispanic person because the harasser believes the individual is Pakistani is national origin harassment, and harassment of a Sikh man wearing a turban because the harasser thinks he is Muslim is religious harassment, even though the perception in both instances is incorrect.\n\nThe EEO laws also cover “associational discrimination.” This includes harassment because the complainant associates with someone in a different protected class[48] or harassment because the complainant associates with someone in the same protected class.[49] Such association may include, but is not limited to, close familial relationships, such as marriage, or close friendship with another individual belonging to a protected group.[50]\n\nHarassment that is based on the complainant’s protected characteristic is covered even if the harasser is a member of the same protected class.[51]\n\nHarassment may be based on more than one protected characteristic of an employee. For example, a Black woman might be harassed both because she is Black and because she is a woman, or alternatively, solely because she is a Black woman. This last example is sometimes referred to as intersectional harassment, or harassment based on the intersection of two or more protected classes.[52] If a Black woman is harassed based on stereotypes about Black women, such harassment is covered. Similarly, if a woman age forty or older is harassed based on stereotypes about older women, this harassment is covered.[53]\n\nHarassment based on one protected characteristic, such as national origin, may also overlap with harassment based on another characteristic, such as religion, because of the close association (actual or perceived) between two protected groups. For example, harassment against an individual who is Muslim and Middle Eastern may be based on both national origin and religion.[54]\n\nHarassment based on protected characteristics includes harassment based on social or cultural expectations regarding how persons of a particular protected group, such as persons of a particular race, national origin, or sex, usually act, appear, or behave.[55] This includes, but is not limited to, harassment based on assumptions about racial, ethnic, or other protected characteristics, or sex-based assumptions about family responsibilities,[56] suitability for leadership roles,[57] or sex roles.[58]\n\nAs discussed below in section II.B., harassment need not explicitly refer to a protected characteristic to be based on that characteristic where there is other evidence establishing causation.\n\nAll retaliation claims, even if they potentially involve unlawful retaliatory harassment, are evaluated under the legal standard for retaliation.[59] This is different from the legal standard for unlawful harassment based on a protected class. For further discussion of retaliation, including potentially retaliatory harassment, see EEOC, Enforcement Guidance on Retaliation and Related Issues § II.B.3 (2016), https://www.eeoc.gov/laws/guidance/enforcement-guidance-retaliation-and-related-issues.\n\nB. Establishing Causation\n\nCausation is established if the evidence shows that the complainant was subjected to harassment because of the complainant’s protected characteristic, whether or not the harasser explicitly refers to that characteristic.[60] The EEO statutes do not prohibit harassment that is not based on a protected characteristic.[61]\n\nExample 5: Harassment Is Covered Because Conduct Was Motivated by a Protected Characteristic. James, who is assigned by a temporary agency to work in a bank, alleges that his bank coworkers have subjected him to derogatory comments about his Japanese ethnicity, including epithets and teasing about his accent. Based on these facts, James has alleged harassment based on his national origin.[62]\n\nExample 6: Harassment Is Not Covered Because There Is Insufficient Evidence That Conduct Was Motivated by a Protected Characteristic. Isaiah, a customer service representative at a financial services firm, alleges he was subjected to harassment based on his national origin and color by his coworker, Zach. Isaiah asserts that, although he previously did not interact much with Zach, last winter Zach became increasingly hostile and rude, throwing paper at Isaiah, shoving him in the hall, and threatening to beat him up or otherwise harm him. The EEO investigation revealed that Zach’s misconduct started shortly after Zach’s girlfriend, who also worked for the financial services firm, ended their relationship and started dating Isaiah. No evidence was found in the investigation to link Zach’s threats and harassing conduct to Isaiah’s national origin or color. These facts are insufficient to establish that Zach’s misconduct subjected Isaiah to harassment because of national origin and/or color.\n\nThe determination of whether hostile workplace harassment is based on a protected characteristic will depend on the totality of the circumstances.[63] Although causation must be evaluated based on the specific facts in a case, the principles discussed below will generally apply in determining causation. Not all of them will necessarily apply in every case.\n\nFacially discriminatory[64] conduct: Conduct that explicitly insults or threatens an individual based on a protected characteristic—such as racial epithets or graffiti, sex-based epithets, offensive comments about an individual’s disability or physical assaults that are targeted based on a protected characteristic—discriminates on that basis.[65] The motive of the individual engaging in such conduct is not relevant to whether the conduct is facially discriminatory. Such conduct also does not have to be directed at a particular worker based on that worker’s protected characteristic, nor do all workers with the protected characteristic have to be exposed to the conduct. For example, degrading workplace comments about women in general, even if they are not related to a specific female employee, show anti-female animus on their face, so no other evidence is needed to show that the comments are based on sex.[66] Further, derogatory comments about women are sex-based even if all employees are exposed to the comments.[67]\n\nExample 7: Causation Established Where Harassment Is Facially Discriminatory. Kiran is an individual with a neuropathic condition that causes his muscles to atrophy and degenerate. As a result of his condition, Kiran walks with a limp and must wear leg braces. Kiran files a charge alleging that he has been subjected to a hostile work environment based on disability. Kiran alleges that on a near-daily basis his coworkers and supervisors at the facility where he works make fun of his limp and leg braces by mimicking his gait and calling him “Forrest Gump,” “cripple,” “Gumby,” and “crippled ninja.” Based on these facts, Kiran has alleged harassment based on disability.[68]\n\nExample 8: Causation Established Where Harassment Is Facially Discriminatory. Keith and his colleagues work in an open-cubicle style office environment, and they frequently make derogatory comments about gay men and lesbians. Horatio, who is gay, overhears the comments on a regular basis and is offended by them, even though they are not directed at him. Based on these facts, the conduct is facially discriminatory and subjects Horatio to harassment based on sexual orientation (which is a form of sex-based harassment), even though he was not specifically targeted by the comments.\n\nStereotyping: Harassment is based on a protected characteristic if it is based on social or cultural expectations, be they positive, negative, or neutral, regarding how persons of a particular protected group usually act or appear.[69] This includes harassment based on sex-based assumptions about family responsibilities,[70] suitability for leadership roles,[71] sex roles,[72] the expression of sexual orientation or gender identity,[73] or harassment based on stereotypes about racial or ethnic characteristics. Such stereotyping need not be motivated by animus or hostility toward that group.[74] For example, age-based harassment might include comments that an older employee should consider retirement so that the employee can enjoy the “golden years.” [75] Comments that a female worker with young children should switch to a part-time schedule so that she can spend more time with her children may demonstrate harassment on the basis of sex.[76] Similarly, derogatory comments involving racial stereotypes may constitute race-based harassment.\n\nExample 9: Causation Established Based on Sex Stereotyping. Eric, an iron worker, alleges he was subjected to sexual harassment from his foreman, Joshua. The investigation reveals that Joshua found a remark Eric made to be “feminine” and then began calling Eric “pu__y,” “princess,” and “fa___t,” often several times a day. Several times a week, Joshua approached Eric from behind and simulated intercourse with him. On about ten occasions, Joshua exposed himself to Eric. Based on these facts, the investigator concludes that Joshua targeted Eric based on his perception that Eric did not conform to traditional male stereotypes and subjected Eric to harassment based on sex.[77]\n\nContext: Conduct must be evaluated within the context in which it arises.[78] In some cases, the discriminatory character of conduct that is not facially discriminatory becomes clear when examined within the specific context in which the conduct takes place or within a larger social context. For example, the Supreme Court observed that use of the term “boy” to refer to a Black man may reflect racial animus depending on such factors as “context, inflection, tone of voice, local custom, and historical usage.”[79] In some contexts, terms that may not be facially discriminatory when viewed in isolation, such as “you people,” may operate as “code words” revealing an intent to discriminate against a protected group.[80]\n\nExample 10: Causation Established by Social Context. Ron, a Black truck driver, finds banana peels on his truck on multiple occasions. After the third of these occasions, Ron sees two white coworkers watching his reaction to the banana peels. An investigation reveals no evidence that banana peels were found on any other truck or that Ron found any trash on his truck besides the banana peels. Based on these facts, an investigator concludes that the appearance of banana peels on Ron’s truck was not coincidental. The investigator further finds that the use of banana peels invokes “monkey imagery” that, given the history of racial stereotypes against Black individuals, was intended as a racial insult. It thus constitutes harassment based on race.[81]\n\nLink between harassment that is not explicitly connected to a protected basis and facially discriminatory conduct: Conduct that is neutral on its face may be discriminatory when linked to other conduct that is facially discriminatory, such as race-based epithets or derogatory comments about individuals with disabilities. Facially neutral conduct therefore should not be separated from facially discriminatory conduct and discounted as non-discriminatory.[82] In some instances, however, facially discriminatory conduct may not be sufficiently related to facially neutral conduct to establish that the latter also was discriminatory.[83]\n\nExample 11: Facially Neutral Conduct Sufficiently Related to Religious Bias. Imani, a devout Christian employed as a customer service representative, alleges that coworkers made offensive comments or engaged in other hostile conduct related to her religious beliefs and practices, including suggesting that Imani belonged to a cult or worshipped the devil; calling her religious beliefs “crazy”; drawing devil horns, a devil tail, and a pitchfork on her Christmas photo; and cursing the Bible and teasing her about Bible reading. In addition, the same coworkers excluded Imani from office parties and subjected her to curse words that the coworkers knew Imani regarded as offensive because of her religion. Although some of the coworkers’ conduct was facially neutral with respect to religion, the investigator concludes that such conduct was closely related to the religious harassment and thus that the entire pattern of harassment was based on Imani’s religion.[84]\n\nTiming: If harassment began or escalated shortly after the harasser learned of the complainant’s protected status, e.g., pregnancy, sexual orientation, gender identity, religion, or disability, the timing may suggest that the harassment was discriminatory.[85]\n\nComparative evidence: Evidence showing qualitative and/or quantitative differences in the conduct directed against individuals in different groups can support an inference that the harassment of workers subjected to more, or more severe, harassment was based on their protected status.[86]\n\nExample 12: Comparative Evidence Gives Rise to Inference that Harassing Conduct Is Based on a Protected Characteristic. Tyler is a manager for an educational services firm. Tyler directly supervises two women, Kailey and Anu, and two men, Sandeep and Levi. Tyler grants Kailey’s request for time off to visit her dying sister. When Kailey returns, Tyler confronts her and yells at her for not reading her “damn email” while she was away. From then on, Tyler regularly hovers over Kailey and Anu as they work to make sure they don’t “mess up.” Tyler also yells and shakes his fist at Kailey and Anu when he is angry at them. This conduct continues, and Kailey and Anu file EEOC charges alleging harassment based on sex. During the investigation, the investigator finds that Sandeep and Levi report that Tyler, although occasionally irritable, generally engages in friendly banter with them that is different from the aggressiveness that Tyler displays toward female employees. Tyler sometimes even allows Sandeep and Levi to relax in his office in the afternoons, doing little or no work. Tyler also permits Sandeep and Levi to leave the office early and does not monitor their work performance. Tyler’s different treatment of women and men who are similarly situated would support an investigator’s conclusion that Tyler’s treatment of Kailey and Anu was based on their sex.[87]\n\nCausation Issues Related to Sex-Based Harassment. A claim of sex-based harassment may rely on any of the causation theories described in the preceding sections and in this section. The Supreme Court has addressed three non-exclusive evidentiary routes for establishing causation in a sexual harassment claim: (1) explicit or implicit proposals of sexual activity; (2) general hostility toward members of the complainant’s sex ; and (3) comparative evidence showing how the harasser treated persons who shared the complainant’s sex compared to the harasser’s treatment of those who did not.[88] As noted, these three routes are not exclusive; they are examples of ways in which harassment based on sex (including pregnancy, sexual orientation, and gender identity) may be established.[89] For example, harassment also is sex-based if the harassment occurs because of sex stereotyping.[90] Additionally, hostility may be directed toward only one individual based on sex.[91] The same legal principles apply regardless of whether the harasser and complainant are of the same sex.[92]\n\nIII. Harassment Resulting in Discrimination with Respect to a Term, Condition, or Privilege of Employment\n\nA. Background: Distinguishing an Explicit Change to the Terms, Conditions, or Privileges of Employment from a Hostile Work Environment\n\nFor an employer to be liable under an EEO statute for workplace harassment based on a protected trait, the harassment must affect a “term, condition, or privilege” of employment.[93] In Meritor Savings Bank, FSB v. Vinson, the Supreme Court provided two examples of such unlawful harassment: (1) an explicit change to the terms or conditions of employment that is linked to harassment based on a protected characteristic, e.g., firing an employee because the employee rejected sexual advances, and (2) conduct that constructively[94] changes the terms or conditions of employment through creation of a hostile work environment.[95]\n\nThe first type of sexual harassment claim was initially described as “quid pro quo” harassment.[96] In early sexual harassment cases, quid pro quo described a claim in which a supervisor carried out a threat to retaliate against an employee for rejecting the supervisor’s advances.[97]\n\nHowever, citing the Supreme Court’s 1998 decision in Burlington Industries, Inc. v. Ellerth, the Second Circuit later explained that a quid pro quo allegation now only “makes a factual claim about the particular mechanism by which a plaintiff’s sex became the basis for an adverse alteration of the terms or conditions of [the plaintiff’s] employment.”[98] The underlying issue in a quid pro quo allegation is the same as in any claim of disparate treatment (i.e., intentional discrimination): whether the claimant has satisfied the statutory requirement of establishing “discriminat[ion] . . . because of sex” affecting the “terms [or] conditions of employment.”[99] For example, if a supervisor threatens to deny an employee a promotion or other job benefit for rejecting sexual advances and subsequently denies the job benefit, the denial of the job benefit itself is an explicit change to the terms and conditions of employment and thus constitutes unlawful sex discrimination.[100] Even if the threat is never carried out, the threat itself is a particularly severe form of harassment and would constitute unlawful sex discrimination if it establishes a hostile work environment, either alone or in concert with other harassing conduct, as described below.[101]\n\nTo be actionable absent such an explicit change to the terms or conditions of employment, the harassment must change the terms or conditions of employment by creating a hostile work environment. Such harassment is actionable if, as a whole, the conduct is “sufficiently severe or pervasive ‘to alter the conditions of [the victim’s] employment and create an abusive working environment.’”[102] As the Supreme Court explained with respect to Title VII in Harris v. Forklift Systems, Inc.:\n\nConduct that is not severe or pervasive enough to create an objectively hostile or abusive work environment—an environment that a reasonable person would find hostile or abusive—is beyond Title VII’s purview. Likewise, if the victim does not subjectively perceive the environment to be abusive, the conduct has not actually altered the conditions of the victim’s employment, and there is no Title VII violation.[103]\n\nThus, absent an explicit change to the terms or conditions of employment, harassing conduct based on a protected characteristic is actionable when it is sufficiently severe or pervasive to create an objectively and subjectively hostile work environment.[104] A hostile work environment claim may encompass any hostile conduct that affects the complainant’s work environment, including employer conduct that may be independently actionable. For example, if a woman was demoted because she refused to submit to unwanted sexual advances, the demotion would be independently actionable as sex discrimination and also actionable as part of a hostile work environment.[105]\n\nThe EEO statutes are not limited to discriminatory conduct that has tangible or economic effects and instead “strike at the entire spectrum of disparate treatment.”[106] However, these statutes also do not impose a general civility code that covers “run-of-the-mill boorish, juvenile, or annoying behavior.”[107] As discussed below in section III.B., the severe-or-pervasive standard takes a “middle path” that requires the conduct to be more than merely offensive but does not require that the conduct cause psychological harm.[108]\n\nWhether conduct creates a hostile work environment depends on the totality of the circumstances, and no single factor is determinative.[109] Some such circumstances include the frequency and severity of the conduct; the degree to which the conduct was physically threatening or humiliating; the degree to which the conduct interfered with an employee’s work performance; and the degree to which it caused the complainant psychological harm.[110] If harassing acts are based on multiple protected characteristics, and the acts are sufficiently related to be considered part of the same hostile work environment, then all the acts should be considered together in determining whether the conduct created a hostile work environment.[111]\n\nExample 13: Age-Based Harassment Creates Hostile Work Environment. Henry is a 62-year-old consultant at a professional services company. Ryan, his supervisor, calls him “old man” on a daily basis. Since Henry’s 60th birthday, Ryan has repeatedly asked him when he plans to retire, saying he can’t wait to bring in “young blood” and “fresh ideas.” During a recent staff meeting, Ryan reminded staff to get their flu shots, then looked at Henry and said, “Although I wouldn’t be heartbroken if the flu took out some of the old timers.” Henry asked Ryan if he was referring to him, and Ryan replied, “Absolutely, old man.” Henry reports feeling targeted and ashamed by Ryan’s comments. Based on these facts, the investigator concludes that Ryan has subjected Henry to a hostile work environment based on age.[112]\n\nB. Hostile Work Environment\n\nThese are key questions that typically arise in evaluating a hostile work environment claim:\n\nWas the conduct both objectively and subjectively hostile?\n\nObjective hostility: was the conduct sufficiently severe or pervasive to create a hostile work environment?\n\nSubjective hostility: did the complainant actually find the conduct hostile?\n\nWhat conduct is part of the hostile work environment claim?\n\nCan conduct that occurred outside the workplace be considered?\n\nCan conduct that was not specifically directed at the complainant be considered?\n\nEven if a complainant subjectively finds conduct based on a protected characteristic to be offensive, such conduct does not constitute a violation of an EEO law unless it is also sufficiently severe or pervasive to create an objectively hostile work environment.[113] Conduct need not be both severe and pervasive: The more severe the harassment, the less pervasive it must be, and vice versa, to establish a hostile work environment.[114] There is neither a “magic number” of harassing incidents that automatically establishes a hostile work environment nor a minimum threshold for severity.[115] Whether a series of events is sufficiently severe or pervasive to create a hostile work environment depends on the specific facts of each case, viewed in light of the totality of the circumstances.[116]\n\nA hostile work environment may include a variety of offensive acts and conduct, including physical or sexual assaults or threats; offensive jokes, slurs, epithets, or name calling; intimidation, bullying, ridicule, or mockery; insults or put-downs; ostracism; offensive objects or pictures; and interference with work performance.\n\nA complainant need not show that discriminatory conduct harmed the complainant’s work performance to prove a hostile work environment. Rather, the evidence must establish that the harassment was sufficiently severe or pervasive to “alter[] the terms or conditions” of the complainant’s employment.[117] Similarly, actionable harassment can be established in the absence of psychological injury, though evidence of psychological harm from the harassment may be relevant to demonstrating a hostile work environment.[118]\n\nExample 14: Hostile Work Environment Created Even Though Complainant Continued to Perform Well. Irina works as a sales representative for a freight transportation company. She and her coworkers sit in adjacent cubicles. Her coworkers, both men and women, often discuss their sexual liaisons in graphic detail; use sex-based epithets when describing women; look at pornographic materials; and, on weekend shifts, occasionally come to the office only partly clothed (e.g., a man not wearing a shirt, another man wearing only a towel after leaving the gym). Irina was horrified by the loudness and vulgarity of the conduct, and she frequently left the office crying. Despite this conduct, however, Irina could meet her daily and weekly quotas, and her work continued to be rated in her performance review as above average. Irina filed an EEOC charge alleging a hostile work environment based on sex. Based on these facts, an EEOC investigator concludes that Irina was subjected to a hostile work environment. Although the harassment did not result in a decline in her work performance or in any apparent psychological injury, the nature of the conduct and Irina’s reactions to it are sufficient to establish that the ongoing sexual conduct creates a hostile work environment because the conduct made it more difficult for a reasonable person in Irina’s situation to do her job.[119]\n\n1. Severity\n\na. General Principles\n\nBecause a “supervisor’s power and authority invests his or her harassing conduct with a particular threatening character,”[120] harassment by a supervisor or other individual with authority over the complainant typically has more impact on a complainant’s work environment than similar misconduct by an individual lacking such authority.[121] Moreover, the severity of the harassment may be heightened if the complainant reasonably believes that the harasser has authority over her, even if that belief is mistaken.[122]\n\nThe more directly harassment affects the complainant, the more likely it is to negatively affect the complainant’s work environment. Thus, harassment is generally more probative of a hostile work environment if it occurs in the complainant’s presence than if the complainant learns about it secondhand. Nevertheless, a complainant’s knowledge of harassing conduct that other employees have separately experienced may be relevant to determining the severity of the harassment in the complainant’s work environment.[123]\n\nSome conduct may be more severe if it occurs in the presence of others, such as the complainant’s coequals, subordinates, or clients. For example, a worker’s sexually degrading comments may be more severe if made in the presence of the complainant and the complainant’s subordinates rather than solely in the complainant’s presence due to the humiliating nature of the interaction.[124] Conversely, some conduct may be more severe when the complainant is alone with the offending individual because the isolation may enhance the threatening nature of the discriminatory conduct.[125]\n\nBecause the severity of harassment depends on all of the circumstances, the considerations discussed above are not exclusive. Other factors may be relevant in evaluating the severity of alleged harassment. For example, the severity of harassment may be enhanced if a complainant has reason to be believe that the harasser is insulated from corrective action. This could arise if the harasser is a highly valued employee, or the employer has previously failed to take appropriate corrective action in similar circumstances.[126]\n\nb. Hostile Work Environment Based on a Single Incident of Harassment\n\nIn limited circumstances, a single incident of harassment can result in a hostile work environment. The following are examples of conduct that courts have found sufficiently severe to establish a hostile work environment based on a single incident:\n\nSexual assault,[127]\n\nSexual touching of an intimate body part,[128]\n\nPhysical violence or the threat of physical violence,[129]\n\nThe use of symbols of violence or hatred toward individuals sharing the same protected characteristic, such as a swastika, an image of a Klansman’s hood, or a noose,[130]\n\nThe use of animal imagery that denigrates individuals sharing a protected characteristic, such as comparing the employee to a monkey, ape, or other animal,[131]\n\nA threat to deny job benefits for rejecting sexual advances,[132] and\n\nThe use of the “n-word” by a supervisor in the presence of a Black subordinate.[133]\n\nUsing epithets based on protected characteristics is a serious form of workplace harassment. As stated by one court, epithets are “intensely degrading, deriving their power to wound not only from their meaning but also from ‘the disgust and violence they express phonetically.’”[134]\n\n2. Pervasiveness\n\nMost hostile work environment claims involve a series of acts. More frequent but less serious incidents can create a hostile work environment.[135] The focus is on the cumulative effect of these acts, rather than on the individual acts themselves. As noted above, there is not a “magic number” of harassing incidents that automatically establishes a hostile work environment. Whether a series of events is sufficiently severe or pervasive to create a hostile work environment depends on the specific facts of each case.[136] Relevant considerations may include the frequency of the conduct[137] and the relationship between the number of incidents and the time period over which they occurred.[138]\n\nExample 15: Hostile Work Environment Created by Pervasive Sexual Harassment. Juan, who works as a passenger service assistant for an airline, alleges that Lydia, a female coworker, sexually harassed him. The evidence shows that Lydia directed sexual overtures and other sex-based conduct at Juan as often as several times a week over a period of six months, despite his repeated insistence that he was not interested. For example, Lydia gave Juan revealing photographs of herself, sent him notes asking for a date, described fantasies about him, and persistently told him how attractive he was and how much she loved him. Based on these facts, an investigator concludes that, regardless of whether the conduct was severe, it was sufficiently pervasive to create a hostile work environment.[139]\n\nExample 16: Extensive Sexual Favoritism Creating a Hostile Work Environment. Tasanee, an employee at a government agency, alleges that she has been subjected to a hostile work environment based on her sex. The evidence shows that supervisors engaged in consensual sexual relationships with female subordinates that were publicly known and behaved in sexually charged ways with other agency employees in public. Supervisors rewarded the subordinates who were in relationships or who acceded without objection to the behavior by granting them promotions, awards, and other benefits. Because the conduct was pervasive and could reasonably affect the work performance and motivation of other workers who found the extensive favoritism offensive, the evidence is sufficient to show that Tasanee was subjected to a sexually hostile work environment.[140]\n\nC. Subjectively and Objectively Hostile Work Environment\n\nThe Supreme Court explained in 1993 in Harris v. Forklift Systems, Inc. that to establish a hostile work environment, offensive conduct must be both subjectively hostile and objectively hostile.[141]\n\n1. Conduct That Is Subjectively and Objectively Hostile Is Also Necessarily Unwelcome\n\nAlthough a complainant alleging a hostile work environment must show that the harassment was unwelcome, conduct that is subjectively and objectively hostile also is necessarily unwelcome. In the Commission’s view, demonstrating unwelcomeness logically is part of demonstrating subjective hostility. If, for example, a complainant establishes that a series of lewd, sexist, and derogatory comments were subjectively hostile, then those comments also would be, by definition, unwelcome. In some circumstances, evidence of unwelcomeness also may be relevant to the showing of objective hostility.\n\n2. Derivation of Unwelcomeness Inquiry\n\nThe unwelcomeness inquiry derives from the Supreme Court’s 1986 decision in Meritor Savings Bank, FSB v. Vinson, where the Court stated that the “[t]he gravamen of any sexual harassment claim is that the alleged sexual advances were ‘unwelcome,’”[142] and from the 1980 EEOC Guidelines upon which the Court relied.[143] In Meritor, the Court focused on the concept of unwelcomeness in order to distinguish it from the concept of voluntariness, noting that the complainant’s participation in the challenged conduct did not necessarily mean that she found it welcome.[144] When the Supreme Court refined the hostile work environment analysis in 1993, in Harris, to require a showing that the conduct was both subjectively and objectively hostile,[145] the Court did not explicitly eliminate unwelcomeness as the gravamen of a harassment claim. However, it is the Commission’s position that this requirement was effectively subsumed into the Court’s new requirement of demonstrating that conduct was both subjectively and objectively hostile.\n\nFollowing Harris, a number of courts have addressed unwelcomeness as part of determining subjective hostility, because conduct that is subjectively hostile will also, necessarily, be unwelcome.[146] Other courts continue to analyze “unwelcomeness” as a separate element in a plaintiff’s prima facie harassment case, in addition to the “subjectively and objectively hostile work environment” analysis.[147] In the Commission’s view, this approach may import redundancy or confusion into the legal analysis of harassment and therefore be an unnecessary step in a court’s analysis.\n\n3. Subjectively Hostile Work Environment\n\nIn general, the complainant’s own statement that the complainant perceived conduct as hostile is sufficient to establish subjective hostility.[148] A subjectively hostile work environment also may be established if there is evidence that an individual made a complaint about the conduct, as it follows logically that the individual found it hostile.[149] Similarly, if there is evidence that the individual complained to family, friends, or coworkers about the conduct, it is likely that the individual found it subjectively hostile.[150]\n\nWhether conduct is subjectively hostile depends on the perspective of the complainant. Thus, if a male complainant does not welcome sexual advances from a female supervisor, it is irrelevant whether other men in the workplace would have welcomed these advances.[151] Moreover, the fact that an individual tolerated or even participated in the conduct is not dispositive; for example, an employee might have experienced derogatory comments or other conduct targeted at the employee’s racial or national origin group as hostile but felt that there was no other choice but to “go along to get along.”[152]\n\nThe complainant’s subjective perception may be at issue, however, if there is evidence that the complainant did not find the harassment to be hostile, such as the complainant’s statement that the complainant did not feel harassed by the challenged conduct.[153]\n\nA complainant’s subjective perception, however, can change over time. For example, a complainant who welcomed certain conduct in the past might subsequently perceive similar conduct as hostile after a certain point in time, such as after the end of a romantic relationship.[154] Moreover, although the complainant may welcome certain conduct, such as sexually tinged conduct, from a particular employee, that does not mean that the complainant also would welcome it from other employees.[155] Nor does acceptance of one form of sexually tinged conduct mean that the complainant would welcome all sexually tinged conduct, particularly conduct of a more severe nature.[156]\n\n4. Objectively Hostile Work Environment\n\nIn addition to being subjectively hostile, the conduct in question must create an objectively hostile work environment, that is, an environment that a reasonable person in the plaintiff’s position would find hostile.[157] The impact of conduct must be evaluated in the context of “surrounding circumstances, expectations, and relationships.”[158]\n\nThe determination of whether harassment was objectively hostile requires “an appropriate sensitivity to social context”[159] and should be made from the perspective of a reasonable person of the complainant’s protected class.[160] Thus, if a Black individual alleges racial harassment, the harassment should be evaluated from the perspective of a reasonable Black individual in the same circumstances as the complainant. Conduct can establish a hostile work environment even if some members of the complainant’s protected class did not or would not find it to be hostile.[161]\n\nIn addition to protected status, other personal or situational[162] characteristics of a particular complainant may affect whether the complainant reasonably perceives certain conduct as creating a hostile work environment. For example, if a teenager was harassed by a substantially older individual, then the age difference may intensify the perceived hostility of the behavior, which would be relevant to both subjective and objective hostility.[163] Similarly, if an undocumented worker is targeted for harassment, then the heightened risk of deportation may contribute to both subjective and objective hostility.[164]\n\nExample 17: Religion-Based Harassment Creates an Objectively Hostile Work Environment. Josephine, an IT support specialist at a regional medical facility in the South, attends an employee appreciation barbecue lunch hosted by her employer. When asked by colleagues why Josephine is not eating any of the barbecued pig, Josephine explains that she is Jewish and observes her religion’s kashrut dietary laws, which prohibit her from eating pork. After the barbecue, a few coworkers begin making comments to or within earshot of Josephine, such as calling Josephine “Jew-sphine,” questioning why Josephine even works because she must have a lot of “Jew money”[165] in savings accounts, and stating that “Jews control the media.” Based on these facts, the investigator concludes that this conduct, viewed from the perspective of a reasonable Jewish person, created an objectively hostile work environment based on religion.\n\nExample 18 : Disability-Based Harassment Creates an Objectively Hostile Work Environment. Jin, a cook, has Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD). He tells his coworkers that he served in Iraq on active duty, has PTSD, and as a result, is uncomfortable with sudden loud noises and unanticipated physical contact. He asks them to tell him in advance about any anticipated loud noises, and requests that they avoid approaching him from behind without warning. Lila, a server, regularly drops or bangs on metal trash cans and sneaks up behind Jin while he is working, because she thinks his response is funny. Jin is so rattled after these encounters that he sometimes mixes up orders or fails to cook the food properly. Jin repeatedly tells Lila to stop, to no avail, and the conduct continues. Based on these facts, the investigator concludes that Lila’s harassment, viewed from the perspective of a reasonable person with PTSD, created an objectively hostile work environment based on disability.\n\nAlthough conduct must be evaluated in the context of the specific work environment in which it arose, there is no “crude environment” exception to Title VII if the harassment otherwise meets the standard of severe or pervasive harassing conduct.[166] Moreover, prevailing workplace culture does not excuse discriminatory conduct.[167] For example, public displays of pornography or sexually suggestive imagery demeaning women can contribute to an objectively hostile work environment for female employees, even if it is a long-standing practice.[168]\n\nAs discussed above, in the Commission’s view, demonstrating unwelcomeness logically is inherently part of demonstrating subjective hostility. In some circumstances, evidence of unwelcomeness may also be relevant to the showing of objective hostility.[169] When analyzing whether conduct is objectively hostile, some courts have focused on whether the harasser had notice that the conduct was unwelcome—in other words, whether the complainant had communicated, or the alleged harasser otherwise had reason to know, that the complainant did not welcome it.[170] Such notice may be relevant in determining whether it is objectively reasonable for a person in the complainant’s position to have perceived ongoing conduct as hostile.[171] For example, flirtatious behavior or asking an individual out on a date may, or may not, be facially offensive, depending on the circumstances. If the actor is on notice, however, that the conduct is unwelcome, then a reasonable person in the complainant’s position may perceive the actor’s persistence in flirting or asking for a date to be hostile.[172]\n\nThe same may be true in the context of religious expression. If a religious employee attempts to persuade another employee of the correctness of his beliefs, the conduct is not necessarily objectively hostile. If, however, the employee objects to the discussion but the other employee nonetheless continues, a reasonable person in the complainant’s position may find it to be hostile.[173]\n\nD. The Scope of Hostile Work Environment Claims\n\n1. Conduct Must Be Sufficiently Related\n\nBecause the incidents that make up a hostile work environment claim constitute a single unlawful employment practice, the complainant can challenge an entire pattern of conduct, as long as at least one incident that contributed to the hostile work environment is timely.[174] The earlier conduct, however, must be sufficiently related to the later conduct to be “part of the same actionable hostile work environment practice” claim.[175] Relevant considerations depend on the specific facts but may include the similarity of the actions involved, the frequency of the conduct, and whether the same individuals engaged in the conduct.[176]\n\nA hostile work environment claim may include any hostile conduct that affects the complainant’s work environment, even conduct that may be independently actionable. For example, a racially discriminatory transfer to a less desirable position that is separately actionable also may contribute to a racially hostile work environment if the action was taken by a supervisor who frequently used racial slurs.[177] Under such circumstances, the transfer could be challenged as part of a hostile work environment claim and would be considered in determining whether the conduct was sufficiently severe or pervasive to create a hostile work environment. In addition, if the transfer occurred within the filing period, then the complainant could also bring a separate claim alleging discriminatory transfer. For more information on the timeliness of hostile work environment claims, see EEOC, Compliance Manual Section 2: Threshold Issues § 2-IV.C.1.b (2009), https://www.eeoc.gov/policy/docs/threshold.html#2-IV-C-1-b.\n\nExample 19: Earlier Harassment Sufficiently Related to Later Harassment. Noreen alleges that she was subjected to harassment based on her religion (Islam) and national origin (Pakistani). Noreen says that her team leader in the packaging department, Josiah, made offensive comments about her accent, religion, and ethnicity. Noreen complained to the plant manager, who did not take any action, and Josiah’s harassment continued. At her own request, Noreen was transferred to the stretch wrap department. Soon after, she saw Josiah speaking with Franklin, a stretch wrap employee, while pointing at Noreen and laughing. Starting the next day, Franklin regularly referred to Noreen using religious and ethnic slurs, including “muzzie,” “terrorist,” and “paki.” Franklin also refused to fill in for her when she needed to take a break. Noreen complained to the plant manager about Franklin’s conduct, but again the plant manager did not take any action. Here, Noreen experienced harassment in two different departments by different harassers, but the conduct was similar in nature. The harassment in the second department occurred shortly after the harassment in the first department; the harassment in the second department started after the two harassers met; and the plant manager was responsible for addressing harassment in both departments. Based on these facts, the investigator concludes that the harassment experienced by Noreen in the two departments constitutes part of the same hostile work environment claim.[178]\n\nExample 20: Earlier Harassment Insufficiently Related to Later Harassment. Cassandra, who worked for a printing company, alleges that she was subjected to sexual harassment when she was in the production department and also after she was transferred to the estimating department. Cassandra says that, while in the production department, she was exposed to sexually explicit discussions, sexual jokes, and vulgar language. Although she was no longer exposed to most of the harassment after her transfer to the estimating department, Cassandra overheard a male worker on the other side of her cubicle wall tell someone that if a weekend trip with one of his female friends “was not a sleepover, then she wasn’t worth the trip.” The sleepover comment was made nearly a year after Cassandra’s transfer and was not directed at Cassandra or made for her to hear. Other than that comment, Cassandra did not experience any alleged harassment after her transfer to the estimating department, which did not interact with the production department. Based on these facts, the investigator concludes that the alleged harassment experienced by Cassandra in the production department was not part of the same hostile work environment claim as the alleged harassment in the estimating department.[179]\n\n2. Types of Conduct\n\na. Conduct That Is Not Directed at the Complainant\n\nHarassing conduct can affect an employee’s work environment even if it is not directed at that employee, although the more directly it affects the complainant, the more probative it is likely to be of a hostile work environment.[180] For instance, the use of gender-based epithets may contribute to a hostile work environment for women even if the epithets are not directed at them.[181] Similarly, anonymous harassment, such as racist or anti-Semitic graffiti or the display of a noose or a swastika, may create or contribute to a hostile work environment, even if it is not clearly directed at any particular employees.[182] Offensive conduct that is directed at other individuals of the complainant’s protected class also may contribute to a hostile work environment for the complainant. Such conduct may even occur outside of the complainant’s presence as long as the complainant becomes aware of the conduct during the complainant’s employment and it is sufficiently related to the complainant’s work environment.[183]\n\nExample 21: Conduct Not Directed Against Complainant that Contributes to a Hostile Work Environment. Lilliana is the District Manager for an insurance company. Peter reports to Lilliana and is an Assistant District Manager; he oversees four sales representatives. Lilliana is white, and Peter and the four sales representatives are Black. Over the two years that Peter has worked for the insurance company, Lilliana has used the term “n____r” when talking to Peter’s subordinates; she also told Peter that his “black sales representatives are too dumb to be insurance agents”; and on another occasion she called the corporate office to ask them to stop hiring Black sales representatives. Some of the comments were made in Peter’s presence, and Peter learned about other comments secondhand, when sales representatives complained to him about them. Based on these facts, an investigator finds that Lilliana’s conduct toward Peter’s subordinates contributed to a hostile work environment for Peter because the comments either occurred in Peter’s presence or he learned about them from others.[184]\n\nIn some circumstances, an individual who has not personally been subjected to unlawful harassment based on their protected status may be able to file an EEOC charge and a lawsuit alleging that they have been harmed by unlawful harassment of a third party.[185]\n\nExample 22: Individual Harmed by Unlawful Harassment of Third Party. Sophie, who is white and Christian, works in an accounting office with her coworker Quentin, who is Black and Muslim, and their mutual supervisor, Jordan, who is white and Christian. They work together in the office. Jordan makes frequent offensive comments about Quentin’s race and religion. One day, after referring to Quentin with the n-word and calling him a “terrorist,” Jordan tells Sophie to hide Quentin’s work files on the office server to “make his life difficult” and to reschedule a series of important team meetings so that they will conflict with Quentin’s daily prayers, effectively excluding him from the meetings. Sophie initially objects, but Jordan tells her that “if you want a future here, you better do what I tell you.” Fearing workplace repercussions if she fails to comply, Sophie reluctantly participates in the ongoing race- and religion-based harassment of Quentin.\n\nSophie and Quentin both file EEOC charges. Quentin’s allegation is that he faced a hostile work environment based on his race and religion; Sophie’s allegation is that Quentin faced a hostile work environment based on his race and religion and she was forced to participate in it. Based on evidence that the harassment occurred on a regular basis and included serious and offensive conduct, including harassment designed to interfere with Quentin's work performance and ostracize him, the investigator concludes that Quentin was subjected to a hostile work environment based on his race and religion.\n\nThe investigator further concludes that, although Sophie was not personally subjected to unlawful harassment based on her race, religion, or other protected status, she had standing to file a charge and obtain relief for any harm she suffered as a result of the unlawful harassment of Quentin, because she was required as part of her job duties to participate in the harassment.[186]\n\nb. Conduct That Occurs in Work-Related Context Outside of Regular Place of Work\n\nA hostile work environment claim may include conduct that occurs in a work-related context outside an employee’s regular workplace.[187] For instance, harassment directed at an employee during the course of employer-required training occurs within the “work environment,” even if the training is not conducted at the employer’s facility.[188]\n\nExample 23: Harassment During Off-Site Employer-Hosted Party Was Within Work Environment. Fatima’s employer hosts its annual holiday party in a private restaurant. One of her coworkers, Tony, drinks to excess, and at the end of the evening attempts to grope and kiss Fatima. Although Tony’s behavior occurred outside Fatima’s regular workplace and at a private restaurant unaffiliated with her employer, it occurred in a work-related context. Therefore, based on these facts, the harassment occurred in Fatima’s work environment for purposes of a Title VII sexual harassment claim.\n\nConduct also occurs within the work environment if it is conveyed using work-related communications systems, accounts, or platforms, such as an employer’s email system, electronic bulletin board, instant message system, videoconferencing technology, intranet, public website, or official social media accounts.[189] As with conduct within a physical work environment, conduct within a virtual work environment can contribute to a hostile work environment. This can include, for instance, sexist comments made during a video meeting, racist imagery that is visible in an employee’s workspace while the employee participates in a video meeting, or sexual comments made during a video meeting about a bed being near an employee in the video image.\n\nExample 24: Conduct on Employer’s Email System Contributing to a Hostile Work Environment. Ted and Perry are coworkers in an accounting firm. Ted is white, and Perry is Black. Ted sends jokes every Monday morning from his work computer and work email account to colleagues, including Perry. Many of the jokes are off-color and involve racial stereotypes, including stereotypes about Black individuals. Perry complains to Ted and their mutual supervisor after several weeks of Ted’s emails, but Ted is not instructed to stop. After several more weekly emails, Perry files a charge of discrimination with the EEOC. Based on these facts, an investigator finds that the racial jokes sent by Ted contributed to a hostile work environment for Perry because, among other reasons, they were sent using Ted’s work computer and work email account and were sent to colleagues in the workplace.\n\nc. Conduct That Occurs in a Non-Work-Related Context, But with Impact on the Workplace\n\nAlthough employers generally are not responsible for conduct that occurs in a non-work-related context, they may be liable when the conduct has consequences in the workplace and therefore contributes to a hostile work environment.[190] For instance, if a Black employee is subjected to racist slurs and physically assaulted by white coworkers who encounter him on a city street, the presence of those same coworkers in the Black employee’s workplace can result in a hostile work environment.[191]\n\nConduct that can affect the terms and conditions of employment, even though it does not occur in a work-related context, includes electronic communications using private phones, computers, or social media accounts, if it impacts the workplace.[192] For example, if an Arab American employee is the subject of ethnic epithets that a coworker posts on a personal social media page, and either the employee learns about the post directly or other coworkers see the comment and discuss it at work, then the social media posting can contribute to a racially hostile work environment.\n\nExample 25: Conduct on Social Media Platform Outside Workplace. Rochelle, a Black woman, works at an assisted living facility as a home health aide. She alleges that two Black coworkers of Caribbean descent, Martina and Terri, subjected her to a hostile work environment based on national origin. The investigation reveals that Martina’s and Terri’s harassing conduct included mocking Rochelle, blocking doorways, and interfering with her work, and that it culminated in an offensive post on the social media service Instagram. In the post, Martina and Terri included two images of Rochelle juxtaposed with an image of the fictional ape Cornelius from the movie The Planet of the Apes, along with text explicitly comparing Rochelle to Cornelius. Rochelle learned about the post from another coworker, Jenna. Based on these facts, an investigator finds that the combined conduct, including the Instagram post, was sufficient to create a hostile work environment.[193]\n\nGiven the proliferation of digital technology, it is increasingly likely that the non-consensual distribution of real or computer-generated intimate images using social media can contribute to a hostile work environment, if it impacts the workplace.\n\nFinally, harassment by a supervisor that occurs outside the workplace is more likely to contribute to a hostile work environment than similar conduct by coworkers, given a supervisor’s ability to affect a subordinate’s employment status.[194]\n\nIV. Liability\n\nA. Overview of Liability Standards in Harassment Cases\n\nWhen a complainant establishes that the employer made an explicit change to a term, condition, or privilege of employment linked to harassment based on a protected characteristic (sometimes described as “quid pro quo” as described in § III.A.), the employer is liable and there is no defense.[195]\n\nIn cases alleging a hostile work environment, one or more standards of liability will apply. Which standards are applicable depends on the relationship of the harasser to the employer and the nature of the hostile work environment. Each standard is discussed in detail in §§ IV.B. and IV.C., below. To summarize:\n\nIf the harasser is a proxy or alter ego of the employer, the employer is automatically liable for the hostile work environment created by the harasser’s conduct. The actions of the harasser are considered the actions of the employer, and there is no defense to liability.\n\nIf the harasser is a supervisor and the hostile work environment includes a tangible employment action against the victim, the employer is vicariously liable for the harasser’s conduct and there is no defense to liability. This is true even if the supervisor is not a proxy or alter ego.\n\nIf the harasser is a supervisor (but not a proxy or alter ego) and the hostile work environment does not include a tangible employment action, the employer is vicariously liable for the actions of the harasser but the employer may limit its liability or damages under this standard of liability if it can prove the Faragher-Ellerth affirmative defense, which is explained below at § IV.C.2.b.\n\nIf the harasser is any person other than a proxy, alter ego, or supervisor, the employer is liable for the hostile work environment created by the harasser’s conduct if the employer was negligent in that it failed to act reasonably to prevent the harassment or to take reasonable corrective action in response to the harassment when the employer was aware or should have been aware of it.\n\nNegligence provides a minimum standard for employer liability,[196] regardless of the status of the harasser.[197] Other theories of employer liability — automatic liability (for harassment by proxies and alter egos) and vicarious liability (for harassment by supervisors) — are additional bases for employer liability that supplement[198] and do not replace the negligence standard.[199]\n\nIf the complainant challenges harassment by one or more supervisors and one or more coworkers or non-employees and the harassment is part of the same hostile work environment claim,[200] separate analyses of employer liability should be conducted in accordance with each harasser’s classification (e.g., proxy, supervisor, coworker).[201]\n\nB. Liability Standard for a Hostile Work Environment Depends on the Role of the Harasser\n\nThe liability standard for a hostile work environment depends on whether the harasser is a:\n\nProxy or alter ego of the employer;\n\nSupervisor; or\n\nNon-supervisory employee, coworker, or non-employee.\n\nThe applicable standard of liability depends on the level and kind of authority that the employer afforded the harasser to act on its behalf.\n\n1. Proxy or Alter Ego of the Employer\n\nAn individual is considered an alter ego or proxy of the employer if the individual possesses such high rank or authority that his or her actions can be said to speak for the employer.[202] Individuals who might be considered proxies include sole proprietors and other owners; partners; corporate officers; and high-level managers whose authority or influence within the organization is such that their actions could be said to “speak for” the employer.[203] By contrast, a supervisor does not qualify as the employer’s alter ego merely because the supervisor exercises significant control over the complaining employee.[204]\n\n2. Supervisor\n\nIn the context of employer liability for a hostile work environment, an employee is considered a “supervisor” if the individual is “empowered by the employer to take tangible employment actions against the victim.”[205]\n\nA “tangible employment action” means a “significant change in employment status” that requires an “official act” of the employer.[206] Examples of tangible employment actions include hiring and firing, failure to promote, demotion, reassignment with significantly different responsibilities, a compensation decision, and a decision causing a significant change in benefits.[207] In some cases, a decision may constitute a tangible employment action even though it does not have immediate direct economic consequences, such as a change in job duties that limits the affected individual’s eligibility for promotion[208] or a demotion with a substantial reduction in job responsibilities but without a loss in pay.[209]\n\nEven if an individual is not the final decision maker as to tangible employment actions affecting the complainant, the individual would still be considered a supervisor if the individual has the “power to recommend or otherwise substantially influence tangible employment actions.”[210]\n\nFinally, an employee who does not have actual authority to take a tangible employment action with respect to the complainant can still be considered a supervisor if, based on the employer’s actions, the harassed employee reasonably believes that the harasser has such power.[211] The complainant might have such a reasonable belief where, for example, the chain of command is unclear or the harasser has broad delegated powers.[212] In these circumstances, the harasser is said to have “apparent authority.”[213]\n\n3. Non-Supervisory Employees, Coworkers, and Non-employees\n\nFederal EEO laws protect employees against unlawful harassment by other employees who do not qualify as a proxy/alter ego or a “supervisor,” i.e., other employees without actual or apparent authority to take tangible employment actions against the employee(s) subjected to the harassment. These other employees may include coworkers and shift leads or other workers with limited authority over the complainant. Employees are further protected against unlawful harassment by non-employees, such as independent contractors,[214] customers,[215] students,[216] hospital patients and nursing home residents,[217] and clients of the employer.[218]\n\nC. Applying the Appropriate Standard of Liability in a Hostile Work Environment Case\n\nOnce the status of the harasser is determined, the appropriate standard can be applied to assess employer liability for a hostile work environment.\n\n1. Alter Ego or Proxy - Automatic Liability\n\nIf the harasser is an alter ego or proxy of the employer, the employer is automatically liable for unlawful harassment and has no defense.[219] Thus, a finding that the harasser is an alter ego or proxy is the end of the liability analysis. This is true whether or not the harassment includes a tangible employment action.\n\nExample 26: Harasser Was Employer’s Alter Ego. Gina, who is Peruvian-American, alleges that she was harassed because of her national origin by the company Vice President, Walter. The investigation reveals that Walter was the only corporate Vice President in the organization, answering only to the company’s President, and he exercised managerial responsibility over the Respondent’s operations. Based on these facts, given Walter’s high rank within the company and his significant control over the company’s operations, the investigator concludes that Walter was the Respondent’s alter ego, subjecting it to automatic liability for a hostile work environment resulting from his harassment.\n\n2. Supervisor - Vicarious Liability\n\nAn employer is vicariously liable for a hostile work environment created by a supervisor.[220] Under this standard, liability for the supervisor’s harassment is attributed to the employer. Unlike situations where the harasser is an alter ego or proxy of the employer, an employer may have an affirmative defense, known as the Faragher-Ellerth defense, when the harasser is a supervisor. The availability of Faragher-Ellerth defense is dependent on whether the supervisor took a tangible employment action against the complainant as part of the hostile work environment. If the Faragher-Ellerth defense is available, the employer bears the burden of proof with respect to the elements of that defense.\n\nIf the supervisor took a tangible employment action as part of the hostile work environment, then the employer is automatically liable for the hostile work environment and does not have a defense.\n\nIf the supervisor did not take a tangible employment action, then the employer can raise the Faragher-Ellerth affirmative defense to vicarious liability by proving both of the following:\n\nThe employer acted reasonably to prevent and promptly correct harassment; and\n\nThe complaining employee unreasonably failed to use the employer’s complaint procedure or to take other steps to avoid or minimize harm from the harassment.\n\na. Hostile Work Environment Includes a Tangible Employment Action: No Employer Defense\n\nAn employer is always liable if a supervisor’s harassment creates a hostile work environment that includes a tangible employment action.[221] As previously noted, agency principles generally govern employer liability for a hostile work environment. The Supreme Court stated in Ellerth that “[w]hen a supervisor makes a tangible employment decision, there is assurance the injury could not have been inflicted absent the agency relation.”[222] Therefore, when a hostile work environment includes a tangible employment action, the “action taken by the supervisor becomes for Title VII purposes the act of the employer,”[223] and the employer is liable.[224]\n\nThe tangible employment action may occur at any time during the course of the hostile work environment, and need not occur at the end of employment or serve as the culmination of the harassing conduct.[225] For example, if a supervisor subjects an employee to a hostile work environment by making frequent sexual comments and denying pay increases because the employee rejects the sexual advances, [226] then the employer is liable for the hostile work environment created by the supervisor and there is no defense.[227] This is true even though the supervisor’s tangible employment action, here denial of pay increases, did not occur at the end of the employee’s employment.\n\nAn unfulfilled threat to take a tangible employment action does not itself constitute a tangible employment action, but it may contribute to a hostile work environment.[228] By contrast, fulfilling a threat of a tangible employment action because a complainant rejects sexual demands (e.g., denying a promotion) constitutes a tangible employment action. Finally, fulfilling a promise to provide a benefit because the complainant submits to sexual demands (e.g., granting a promotion or not terminating the complainant after the complainant submits to sexual demands) constitutes a tangible employment action.[229]\n\nb. Hostile Work Environment Without a Tangible Employment Action: Establishing the Faragher-Ellerth Affirmative Defense\n\nIf harassment by a supervisor creates a hostile work environment that did not include a tangible employment action, the employer can raise an affirmative defense to liability or damages. In Faragher and Ellerth, the Supreme Court explained that the defense requires the employer to prove that:\n\nthe employer exercised reasonable care to prevent and correct promptly any harassment; and\n\nthe employee unreasonably failed to take advantage of any preventive or corrective opportunities provided by the employer or to take other steps to avoid harm from the harassment.[230]\n\nIn establishing this affirmative defense, the Supreme Court sought “to accommodate the agency principles of vicarious liability for harm caused by misuse of supervisory authority, as well as Title VII’s equally basic policies of encouraging forethought by employers and saving action by objecting employees.”[231] The Court held that this carefully balanced defense contains “two necessary elements:”[232] (1) the employer’s exercise of reasonable care to prevent and correct promptly any sexually harassing behavior, and (2) the employee’s unreasonable failure to take advantage of any preventive or corrective opportunities provided by the employer or to avoid harm otherwise.[233] Thus, in circumstances in which an employer fails to establish one or both prongs of the affirmative defense, the employer will be liable for the harassment. For example, if the employer is able to show that it exercised reasonable care but cannot show that the employee unreasonably failed to take advantage of preventive or corrective opportunities, the employer will not be able to establish the defense.\n\nExample 27: Employer Fails to Establish Affirmative Defense. Chidi files a charge alleging that he was subjected to national origin harassment by his supervisor, Ang. The employer does not have a written anti-harassment policy and does not offer comprehensive anti-harassment training. Instead, employees are told to “follow the chain of command” if they have any complaints, which would require Chidi to report to Ang. The evidence shows that during meetings with Chidi and his coworkers, Ang repeatedly directed egregious national origin-based epithets at Chidi, and that Ang’s conduct was sufficient to create a hostile work environment. Chidi reported Ang’s harassment to his manager (who was also Ang’s supervisor) on at least two separate occasions. Each time, the manager simply responded, “That’s just Ang—don’t take it seriously.” Based on these facts, the investigator concludes that the employer cannot establish either prong of the affirmative defense. The employer did not exercise reasonable care to prevent or to promptly correct the harassment. Further, the employer cannot establish that Chidi unreasonably failed to take advantage of the employer’s complaint process. Based on these facts, the employer is liable for supervisor harassment under Title VII.\n\nExample 28: Employer Avoids Liability by Establishing Affirmative Defense. Kit files a charge alleging that they were subjected to a hostile work environment by their supervisor because of race. The supervisor’s harassment was not severe at first but grew progressively worse over a period of several months. The employer had an effective anti-harassment policy and procedure, which it prominently displayed on its employee website and provided to all employees through a variety of other means. In addition, the employer was not aware of any harassment by this supervisor in the past.[234] Kit never complained to the employer about the harassment or took any other steps to avoid harm from the harassment. The employer learned of the supervisor’s conduct from Kit’s coworker, who observed the harassment. After learning about it, the employer took immediate corrective action that stopped the harassment. Based on these facts, the employer is not liable for the supervisor’s harassment of Kit, because the employer had an effective policy and procedure and took prompt corrective action upon receiving notice of the harassment and Kit could have used the effective procedure offered by the employer or taken other appropriate steps to avoid further harm from the harassment, but failed to do so.\n\ni. First Prong of the Affirmative Defense: Employer’s Duty of Reasonable Care\n\nThe first prong of the affirmative defense requires the employer to show that it exercised reasonable care both to prevent harassment and to correct harassment. More specifically, an employer must show both that it took reasonable steps to prevent harassment in general, as discussed immediately below, and that it took reasonable steps to prevent and to correct the specific harassment raised by a particular complainant. Because the questions of whether the employer acted reasonably to prevent and to correct the specific harassment alleged by the complainant also arise when analyzing employer liability for non-supervisor harassment, those issues are discussed in detail at § IV.C.3.a. (addressing unreasonable failure to prevent harassment) and § IV.C.3.b. (addressing unreasonable failure to correct harassment). The principles discussed in those sections also apply when determining whether the employer has shown under the first prong of the affirmative defense that it acted reasonably to prevent and to correct the harassment alleged by the complainant.\n\nTitle VII does not specify particular steps an employer must take to establish that it exercised reasonable care to prevent and correct harassment; instead, as discussed below, the employer will satisfy its obligations if, as a whole, its efforts are reasonable.[235] In assessing whether the employer has taken adequate steps, the inquiry typically begins by identifying the policies and practices an employer has instituted to prevent harassment and to respond to complaints of harassment. These steps usually consist of promulgating a policy against harassment, establishing a process for addressing harassment complaints, providing training to ensure employees understand their rights and responsibilities, and monitoring the workplace to ensure adherence to the employer’s policy.[236]\n\nFor an anti-harassment policy to be effective, it should generally have the following features, at a minimum:\n\nthe policy defines what conduct is prohibited;\n\nthe policy is widely disseminated;[237]\n\nthe policy is comprehensible to workers,[238] including those who the employer has reason to believe might have barriers to comprehension, such as employees with limited literacy skills or limited proficiency in English;[239]\n\nthe policy requires that supervisors report harassment when they are aware of it;[240]\n\nthe policy offers multiple avenues for reporting harassment, thereby, allowing employees to contact someone other than their harassers;[241]\n\nthe policy clearly identifies accessible[242] points of contact to whom reports of harassment should be made and includes contact information;[243] and\n\nthe policy explains the employer’s complaint process, including the process’s anti-retaliation and confidentiality protections.\n\nFor a complaint process to be effective, it should generally have the following features, at a minimum:\n\nthe process provides for prompt and effective investigations and corrective action;[244]\n\nthe process provides adequate confidentiality protections;[245] and\n\nthe process provides adequate anti-retaliation protections.[246]\n\nFor training to be effective, it should generally have the following features, at a minimum:[247]\n\nIt explains the employer’s anti-harassment policy and complaint process, including any alternative dispute resolution process, and confidentiality and anti-retaliation protections;\n\nIt describes and provides examples of prohibited harassment, as well as conduct that, if left unchecked, might rise to the level of prohibited harassment;\n\nIt provides information about employees’ rights if they experience, observe, become aware of, or report conduct that they believe may be prohibited;\n\nIt provides supervisors and managers information about how to prevent, identify, stop, report, and correct harassment, such as actions that can be taken to minimize the risk of harassment, and clear instructions for addressing and reporting harassment that they observe, that is reported to them, or that they otherwise become aware of;\n\nIt is tailored to the workplace and workforce;\n\nIt is provided on a regular basis to all employees; and\n\nIt is provided in a clear, easy-to-understand style and format.\n\nHowever, even the best anti-harassment policy, complaint procedure, and training will not necessarily establish that the employer has exercised reasonable care to prevent harassment – the employer must also implement these elements effectively.[248] Thus, evidence that an employer has a comprehensive anti-harassment policy and complaint procedure will be insufficient standing alone to establish the first prong of the defense if the employer fails to implement those procedures or to appropriately train employees.[249] Similarly, the first prong of the defense would not be established if evidence shows that the employer adopted or administered the policy in bad faith or that the policy was otherwise defective or dysfunctional.[250] Considerations that may be relevant to determining whether an employer unreasonably failed to prevent harassment are discussed in detail at § IV.C.3.a, below.\n\nLikewise, the existence of an adequate anti-harassment policy and complaint procedure, and training is not dispositive on the issue of whether an employer exercised reasonable care to correct harassing behavior of which it knew or should have known.[251] For example, if a supervisor witnesses harassment by a subordinate, the supervisor’s knowledge of the harassment is imputed to the employer, and the duty to take corrective action will be triggered.[252] If the employer fails to exercise reasonable care to correct the harassing behavior, it will be unable to satisfy prong one of the Faragher-Ellerth defense, regardless of any policy, complaint procedure, or training. The duty to exercise reasonable care to correct harassment for which an employer had notice is discussed in detail at § IV.C.3.b., below.\n\nExample 29: Employer Liable Because It Failed to Exercise Reasonable Care in Responding to Harassment – Employee Reported to a Supervisor. Aisha, who works as a cashier in a fast-food restaurant, files a charge alleging that she was sexually harassed by one of her supervisors, Pax, an assistant manager. The investigation reveals that Aisha initially responded to Pax’s sexual advances and other sexual conduct by telling him that she was not interested and that his conduct made her uncomfortable. Pax’s conduct persisted, however, so Aisha spoke to the restaurant’s other assistant manager, Mallory, who, like Pax, was designated as Aisha’s direct supervisor. Respondent has an anti-harassment policy, which is distributed to all employees. The policy states that all supervisors are required to report and address potentially harassing conduct when the supervisor becomes aware of such conduct. Mallory, however, did not report Pax’s conduct or take any action because she felt Aisha was being overly sensitive. Pax continued to sexually harass Aisha, and a few weeks after speaking with Mallory, Aisha contacted the Human Resources Director. The following day, Respondent placed Pax on paid administrative leave, and a week later, after concluding its investigation, Respondent terminated Pax. Respondent contends that it took reasonable corrective action by promptly responding to Aisha’s complaint to Human Resources. Because Mallory was one of Aisha’s supervisors, and was therefore responsible for reporting and addressing potential harassment, Respondent could not establish the affirmative defense, having failed to act reasonably to address the alleged harassment after Aisha spoke with Mallory.\n\nExample 30: Employer Liable Because It Failed to Exercise Reasonable Care in Responding to Harassment –Supervisor Witnessed Harassment. Respondent, a large department store, has an anti-harassment policy. The policy is, on its face, effective: for example, it describes harassment; provides multiple avenues for reporting harassment, including a 1-800 number operated by a third-party vendor; and contains an anti-retaliation provision. The policy is distributed to all employees at the time of their hire and can be accessed any time via computer terminals that all employees can use. Further, Respondent ensures that all employees receive annual anti-harassment training that reminds employees of the policy, including their rights and obligations under the policy.\n\nClaudia works as an overnight stocker in Respondent’s housewares department. Claudia is directly supervised by Dustin, the housewares department manager. On an almost nightly basis, Dustin likes to “play a game” in which he hides between store aisles and jumps out with his penis exposed to Claudia. Ravi, who manages Respondent’s produce section, has witnessed Dustin expose his penis to Claudia on a few occasions. Ravi once admonished Dustin for being a “child” and told him “acting like that will lead to you getting fired,” but took no further action to address the harassment. Claudia was embarrassed by the harassment but was afraid that complaining would jeopardize her job, so she never reported the harassment, either to Respondent or the 1-800 number. Respondent cannot establish the affirmative defense. While Respondent appears to have acted reasonably in its efforts to prevent harassment by adopting a comprehensive and effective anti-harassment policy and providing training, it did not act reasonably to correct harassment that it knew about through Ravi’s direct observation.\n\nii. Second Prong of the Affirmative Defense: Employee’s Failure to Take Advantage of Preventive or Corrective Opportunities\n\nThe second prong of the Faragher-Ellerth affirmative defense requires the employer to show that the complainant “unreasonably failed to take advantage of any preventive or corrective opportunities provided by the employer or to avoid harm otherwise.”[253] An employer that has exercised reasonable care will not be liable if the complainant could have avoided all harm from unlawful harassment but unreasonably failed to do so.[254] Moreover, if the employee unreasonably delayed complaining and an earlier complaint could have avoided some but not all of the harm from the harassment, then the employer might be able to use the affirmative defense to reduce damages, even if it could not eliminate liability altogether.[255]\n\nExample 31: Employer Limits Damages by Establishing Affirmative Defense. Nina files a charge alleging that she was subjected to national origin harassment by her supervisor, Samantha. The evidence shows that the harassment began when Samantha used egregious epithets to refer to Nina’s national origin during an informal meeting with Nina’s coworkers, conduct that was sufficient standing alone to create a hostile work environment. Although Samantha’s harassment continues, Nina does not complain until four months later, when she accepts a position with another employer. Nina states she did not complain during her employment because she did not want to “rock the boat” or cause Samantha to be fired. The investigator concludes that the employer has established both elements of the affirmative defense with respect to the continuing harassment after the meeting because Nina could have avoided this harm by complaining promptly. However, the employer is liable for the hostile work environment created by Samantha’s initial use of the egregious epithets because Nina could not have avoided this harm by complaining earlier.\n\nProof that the employee unreasonably failed to use the employer’s complaint procedure will normally establish the second prong of the affirmative defense.[256] In some circumstances, however, there will be evidence of a reasonable explanation for an employee’s delay in complaining or failure to utilize the employer’s complaint process.[257] In addition, there will be instances when an employee’s use of mechanisms other than the employer’s official complaint process will be sufficient to demonstrate that the employee took reasonable steps to avoid harm from the harassment.\n\nThe reasonableness of an employee’s decision not to use the employer’s complaint procedure, or timing in doing so, depends on the particular circumstances and information available to the employee at that time.[258] An employee should not necessarily be expected to complain to management immediately after the first or second incident of relatively minor harassment. An employee might reasonably ignore a small number of minor incidents, hoping that the harassment will stop without resorting to the complaint process.[259] The employee also may choose to tell the harasser directly to stop the harassment and then wait to see if the harasser stops before complaining to management. If the harassment persists or worsens, however, then further delay in complaining might be unreasonable.\n\nEven if the employee uses the employer’s official complaint process, simply filing the complaint does not necessarily show that the employee acted reasonably in using the process. If, for example, the complainant unreasonably failed to cooperate in the investigation, the complaint would not qualify as a reasonable effort to avoid harm.[260]\n\na) Reasonable Delay in Complaining or in Failing to Use the Employer’s Complaint Procedure\n\nThere may be reasonable explanations for an employee’s delay in complaining or failure to utilize the employer’s complaint process.[261] For example:\n\nEmployer-created obstacles to filing complaints: An employee’s failure to use the employer’s complaint procedure could be reasonable if that failure was based on employer-created obstacles to filing complaints. For example, if the process entailed undue expense by the employee,[262] inaccessible points of contact for making complaints,[263] or intimidating or burdensome requirements, failure to use the process could be reasonable.\n\nIneffective complaint mechanism: As a general matter, an employee’s subjective belief that reporting harassment will be futile, without more, will not constitute a reasonable basis for failing to take advantage of preventive or corrective opportunities provided by an employer.[264] However, an employee’s failure to use the employer’s complaint procedure would be reasonable if that failure was based on a reasonable belief that the complaint process was ineffective. For example, an employee might have a reasonable belief that the complaint process would be ineffecti"
