        "text": "By Sarah Roebuck\n\nCorrections1\n\nOKFUSKEE COUNTY, Okla. — A corrections officer was killed in a collision involving another corrections officer, the Oklahoma Department of Corrections said.\n\nOn July 14, Corporal Robert Sumner from the John Lilley Correctional Center was driving an ODOC transport van on the highway when it collided with another vehicle. The other vehicle was driven by Corporal Andrew Freppon who was heading to the facility for his regular duty shift.\n\nAccording to ODOC, Sumner was en route to OU Medical Center to work a hospital shift.\n\n“Our prayers and thoughts are with Cpl. Sumner’s family and friends and all JLCC staff. We are also praying for Cpl. Freppon’s speedy recovery,” stated ODOC Executive Director Steven Harpe.\n\nSumner was found unresponsive by first responders and pronounced dead at the scene, ODOC. Freppon sustained leg and internal trunk injuries. He was airlifted from the scene to a nearby hospital where he is stable following surgery.\n\nBoth corporals graduated from the ODOC academy in November 2023, ODOC said."
