        "text": "I cannot say enough about the experience I have had with Advanstaff HR over the last 5 years. Susan Blaisdell our payroll administrator goes above and beyond, always answers her phone and if a voicemail is left she calls back immediately. She is happy to assist with anything you need or put you in touch with the appropriate department. I feel confident in managing our business with Susan by my side ! Sarah in benefits is also a godsend. Prompt replies and assists me with anything I need.\n\nWe have used AdvanStaff for our human resource needs for all of the companies we own and we would not consider switching to any other company. . We have been loyal customers now for about 25 years and have found that AdvanStaff remains professional and dedicated to us, its customers and they continue to outperform all their competitors especially for the level of customer service that AdvanStaff provides. Over the years AdvanStaff has grown and changed significantly, with more automation helping them to service more customers; however they continue to maintain the personal service that they had when they first started as a smaller family owned company. I have had the pleasure to work with a few of their staff and the personal attention each of them have provided has been incredible. Our current manager is Jennifer Ernst, who recently took over our account. Each transition to a new manager has been seamless since AdvanStaff has excellent retention of its own staff (a sign of a great company) and we have know Jennifer for many years. Like many of the staff she is delightful to work with, always professional and courteous, and goes above and beyond to ensure that our needs are met. AdvanStaff also has provided us with all our human resource needs to guide us through some difficult employee issues which regrettably sometimes happen. They remain up to date with all the regulations (especially Covid) and have been very helpful in guiding their customers through such times.\n\nOur experience with Advanstaff has been nothing short of great! We are a small company and undertaking an in house HR team is something we could not do. Advanstaff takes all the headache out of managing HR. Their platforms are simple to use and their staff is always available to answer questions. We also use them to process our payroll and our account manager, Maria, is amazing. She immediately answers questions or requests and is very thorough at making sure our payroll needs are met. As a small business owner, partnering with someone who manages the HR needs an Payroll for your company is a little scary. It's hard to know who you can trust in this world. Advanstaff delivers on their promises and takes the fear and headache out of the processes!\n\nI have been a satisfied client of Advanstaff for over 10 years. Michelle does our payroll and is very conscientious in handling our requests and prompt in returning messages. The HR department has been helpful in advising how to proceed with employee related issues, which is something that I don't have training in as a small business owner. I only wish that we had other options for health insurance beyond just the one company that dominates our community.\n\nAdvanstaff has been our PEO/HR service provider for several years now. They have helped keep me focused, on track, and out of trouble through this time. They operate as a TEAM and are very customer focused. For a long time I would always email Susan B with a question. More often than not, she was not the best person to handle my issue, but she always passed on my question to the right person which was then addressed quickly and professionally. I now understand my \"team\" at Advanstaff and go to the proper person the first time, but the concept of \"team\" within Advanstaff has served me well. Get to know them. They want to be your successful partner in business.\n\nWe have been working with Advanstaff for close to 10 years. We're assigned an amazing team of people who help keep this aspect of the business running optimally. They've taken care of everything we've needed. Always keeping us informed and updated. Highly recommended. With Advanstaff, hiring, payroll and all personnel adjustments are made simple. We work more with Sommer Cripps. She's our Payroll Administrator and I'm not sure I've ever heard her voicemail. She answers the phone every time I call. She's always very patient and helpful. When you work with people who can be pleasant while you're trying to work through personnel adjustments, it really makes the process less stressful. We could easily do another 10 years with as smoothly as things have gone.\n\nThe company I work for utilizes AdvanStaff HR for all of our payroll, insurance and HR needs. My most frequent contact is Susan Blaisdell who has expertly handled our payroll needs for the past 12 + years. I really appreciate all she does to assist me in processing payroll every month. Susan does a fantastic job - even when I have unusual payroll processing needs. I have on occasion needed HR advice for the Company, and Brad Hafen has been wonderful to work with - he is very prompt and helpful. I also work with Amy Beaman and Lisa Cummings regarding insurance and other benefits. They also are very prompt and helpful when I need information. I am so glad we decided to outsource payroll, insurance and HR - it has made my accounting job at my company much easier! I highly recommend AdvanStaff HR."
