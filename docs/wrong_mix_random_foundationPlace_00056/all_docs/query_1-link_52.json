        "text": "The internet is swamped with tech jargon. Every day, a new word or phrase is trending. Amidst this oversaturation of new language, the term “API-first” might sound like another new buzzword. But if you want your organization to lead the pack, it’s a concept that deserves attention. API-first companies are turning traditional business models upside down and using APIs to find fresh ways to make money. But wait, what exactly is an API, and what does it mean to be API-first?\n\nThink of an API, or Application Programming Interface, as a digital Uber driver, allowing different software systems to talk to each other. Like an Uber driver picking up your order from a location and handling all the logistics in between, APIs do the same for your data across the web.\n\nAPIs account for 83% of the world’s web traffic, running in the background of your everyday life, making it easy for apps and services to share data and functionality at your fingertips. They quite literally underpin the architecture of modern software, providing plug-and-play functionality ranging from payment processing to data analytics. This makeover lets consumers mingle with various services like never before, clearing the stage for apps that are quicker on the draw, more in tune with our needs, and capable of delivering answers in real-time.\n\nAPI-first companies reverse the typical product development by building APIs before they build anything else. Instead of traditional coding, they start with APIs, ensuring all applications are created to deliver value from the start. This means that APIs are built tough and ready to grow with users’ needs immediately.\n\nAPIs aren’t just for developers anymore; you interact with APIs every day – perhaps without knowing it. Have you ever shared a photo on Instagram and automatically shared it on Facebook? What about checking your bank balance online or searching for the latest local weather update? Booked a flight and paid using PayPal? All of this interconnectivity is possible because an API made it so.\n\nOrganizations — in every industry — are creatively leveraging APIs to find new ways to make money. APIs drive all kinds of successful businesses, whether it’s by cashing in on data, automating tedious routine tasks, or offering cool new features. The ability to integrate or extend functionalities via APIs is a table stake in driving growth and innovation. By accessing the API layer, businesses can unlock valuable data, workflows, models, and features that can be monetized in various ways. Let’s take a look at these four distinct business models:\n\nMonetizing Data\n\nData is often referred to as the new oil, and organizations sitting on vast data reservoirs can unlock massive potential through their APIs. By tapping into these large data pipelines, businesses can transform once-stagnant information into revenue-generating machines.\n\nConsider the financial sector. Companies like Sacra are making waves by providing access to private market data. In an age where information is king, Sacra’s APIs open doors for developers to build applications that were previously out of reach. Sacra’s democratization of data, which includes information about non-publicly traded companies, venture capital deals, and private equity investments, is traditionally hard to come by.\n\nOn top of leveling the playing field, developers can also build tools for financial analysis, investment decision-making, or market research, allowing investors or financial analysts to make better decisions. In a world where the competitive edge often hinges on information, APIs like Sacra’s pave the way for a more inclusive financial ecosystem.\n\nThe power to cash in on data through APIs is equally transformative in healthcare. Ribbon Health, for instance, allows healthcare providers and developers to access and integrate healthcare data into their applications. This includes information on healthcare providers, insurance plans, and patient services. But why is that important? By accessing up-to-date provider information data, Ribbon Health’s API is upping the game in patient care, making sure people are sent to specialists that their insurance covers, saving them from unnecessary, annoying out-of-network fees.\n\nThe healthcare industry is one that often grapples with fragmented and outdated information. Ribbon Health’s API addresses this by aggregating and continuously updating its data set, making it easier for organizations to maintain accurate and current information. Ribbon generates revenue from its data by charging for API access, which its customers can use to create premium features such as advanced analytics, custom reporting, or patient engagement platforms, adding new dimensions to revenue strategies for the healthcare industry.\n\nMonetizing Workflows\n\nAPIs are not just about connecting data but also about joining multiple API calls into an easy-to-follow workflow, eliminating customer headaches. Imagine every tedious, repetitive task automated with the flick of a switch — that’s what APIs do for businesses. They link various functions that save time, cut costs, and deliver results.\n\nTake Layer 2’s API, for example, which simplifies cross-border payment processes by integrating multiple payment methods and services into a single workflow. This singular workflow allows businesses to create a bespoke customer payment experience by enabling them to send or receive payments using ACH, Fedwire, Swift, cryptocurrencies, UPI, EFT, and tokenized assets. Monetizing the Layer 2 API’s workflows generates scalable revenue streams while embedding their services into customer’s core operations, transforming Layer 2 into a critical platform that supports a wide range of businesses and applications.\n\nAnother company weaving the concept of API-first into its business model is Truework. Their API automates employment and income verification for HR departments while maintaining people’s privacy and consent. This API-driven approach simplifies compliance issues and provides significant operational cost savings. By monetizing its API workflows, Truework creates a valuable revenue stream and empowers businesses with efficient, scalable solutions. This model exemplifies how an API-first strategy can drive sustainable growth and enhance customer satisfaction by transforming complex processes into easily accessible services.\n\nMonetizing Models\n\nEvery Tom, Dick, and Harry business has an AI copilot now. How? The answer is APIs. AI models are cashing in on APIs, opening the door for businesses worldwide to offer fancy AI capabilities as feature functionality embedded within their products. This approach allows organizations to leverage powerful AI models in-house without building or maintaining these complex systems.\n\nFor example, OpenAI’s API provides developers access to cutting-edge technology like GPT-4o. Their API allows businesses to seamlessly integrate large language models and processing capabilities into applications and facilitate a wide range of AI-driven services. Whether through chatbots and content generation or complex data analysis, OpenAI’s API monetization model unlocks possibilities for scores of businesses. This paradigm shift, underpinned by APIs, transforms global revenue.\n\nMonetizing Features\n\nAPIs foster composability, allowing organizations to turn individual features of their products or services into distinct revenue streams. Take Salesforce, for example; businesses have seamlessly integrated its powerful CRM functionalities into their applications by adopting an API-first development strategy. This strategic move has been transformative, with APIs contributing 50% of Salesforce’s $31 billion annual revenue in 2023.\n\nExpedia’s API allows businesses to incorporate travel booking features into their websites and applications. Through this API feature, Expedia’s customers directly offer services like flight and hotel bookings, car rentals, and travel packages. Expedia monetizes its API by taking a commission on the transactions facilitated through its platform, accounting for 90% of its $13 billion revenue in 2023.\n\nAnother company embracing the API-first approach is Whereby. API allows developers to integrate high-quality video conferencing capabilities into their applications by providing this functionality, broadening its reach into new markets, and generating revenue by offering scalable solutions that meet the growing demand for embedded video services.\n\nSuppose epochs marked the age of the internet — the 90s being the dot-com era, the 2000s being the web, the 2010s by mobile — then the 2020s herald the age of APIs within the digital transformation landscape. APIs are no longer just backend services or technical tools.\n\nThe new era of software is characterized by the disintegration of traditional software stacks into modular APIs, serving unique business functions. API monetization has become crucial for businesses looking to extend their reach and generate new revenue streams. By going all-in on the API-first strategy, businesses turn data, AI models, individual features, and customized workflows into customer-centric, competitive offerings, unlocking unlimited potential for growth and success.\n\nWhether you’re sitting on a goldmine of data, looking to make things run smoother, or itching to share your top ideas, APIs are your ticket to a more connected, more profitable world."
