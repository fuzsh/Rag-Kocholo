        "text": "An insider’s view from within TikTok’s monetization product organization\n\nOutside looking in, working at TikTok can seem like a techie’s dream. The brand is instantly recognizable. The growth and success of the company is awe-inspiring. More often than not, when I tell people that I work at TikTok, their reactions are usually, “That’s awesome! I love TikTok!” Or, “I got so addicted to TikTok I deleted it off my phone..” I even had the good fortune of working on what I considered to be one of TikTok’s coolest product initiatives: the platform that helps creators make money from brand sponsorships. Doubly-awesome. For an admittedly prestige focused, laugh-til-you-cry-on-Tiktok person like me, this was my dream job…until it became a nightmare.\n\nFor those of you who have read TikTok’s Glassdoor and Blind reviews -\n\nSpoiler alert: To me, it’s an oversimplification to say that TikTok is a tough company because of the lack of work-life balance. Yes, the hours there are unequivocally demanding. But in order to understand why, we first need to understand the major contributing factors, ranging from the company’s organizational decisions to geopolitics.\n\nFirst, a recap.\n\nIn Part 1, I said that TikTok operates like a Chinese company with some Silicon Valley influence — not the other way around. The key decision makers at TikTok sit in China (and to a lesser extent, Singapore), and they define the working culture. US teams serve as more of a satellite office, with the purpose of being embedded in TikTok’s largest market.\n\nIt’s key to note that no product teams at TikTok operate independently from teams in China. In my opinion, this is one of the biggest drawbacks of product roles at TikTok. The vast majority of product teams are split across the US and China — meaning PMs, engineering, design, and other product roles within the same team sit in both the US & China, with heavy cross-dependencies on each other.\n\nBefore I joined, my interview panel sold me on a US-based work set up that never materialized. “Your team will transition to be fully based out of the US, so late hours with the China team will only be temporary,” they said. To be fair, I do believe TikTok wanted to move in this direction at the time. But the pandemic’s border closings and the geopolitical fiasco that ensued summer of 2020 (remember when Trump tried to ban TikTok?) appeared to harden Bytedance’s reserve to keep most — if not all — product teams inextricably tied to Beijing HQ.\n\nMy expectation vs. reality grid:\n\nGiven the split team, heavy China dependency dynamic, here’s my take on 4 dimensions of difficulty of working at TikTok: working culture, timezone & language differences, the pandemic, and geopolitics.\n\nThe Working Culture shock is real\n\nThe intensity of Chinese working culture is no mystery. Leaders in Beijing, Bytedance’s headquarters, define the company’s intense working culture, which seeps outwards to all of its satellite offices. 80+ hours a week, instant responses in the middle of the night, and a sheer dedication to work above all else: these are the norms in Tiktok’s China offices. Given more than half my team sat in China, we on the US team were not exempt from the same, crushing expectations of hours and productivity.\n\nSo how did TikTok manage to convince its employees in the US — many of whom came from SV tech giants like Google and Facebook — to work this hard?\n\nThey create a system that rewards speed above all else, and a key tactic is to cultivate intense competition between teams. I uncharitably call it a culture of “burn and churn.” Pit teams against each other, extract the maximum output, burn people out, and replace them. Rinse and repeat.\n\nSince Tiktok & Bytedance have access to deep technical talent pools in China, they do not suffer from the usual labor constraints that plague US companies. Product teams can build the same or overlapping features with little consequence to the company. More than once, I discovered nearly identical mocks to my team’s product interface from another team that I had never heard of. A literal, copy + paste.The only differences would be that the buttons were a different shade of purple and the cards had rounded edges.\n\nUpon escalation to leadership, their guidance was to “build separately for now, and we’ll integrate sometime in the future.” What’s unspoken was *how* they were going to determine which interface would get integrated. “Why is leadership not taking a stance to tie-break?” I fumed. “We’re just here, spinning our wheels, building redundant features!” After hearing multiple, similar stories, I realized — the competition is intentional. Overlap between teams is encouraged to speed up time to market and increase urgency. And the low transparency environment — where all documents are locked by default and even the org chart is obscured — just fanned the flames of our collective paranoia.\n\nEvery day, I’d ruminate. “Who else is building the same thing? Is my team working hard enough? Fast enough?” I felt like we were constantly falling behind, being out maneuvered. After all, our team could only “win” by shipping and delivering results faster than the others.\n\nNowhere in TikTok’s policy says you have to work 996 (9 AM to 9 PM, 6 days a week.) But the terribly ingenious thing is — the system in place will have you work 996, anyway.\n\n2. Long hours and inefficient communication, due to language barriers and time zone differences\n\nMost folks in Silicon Valley like myself have “HQ privilege.” We’re accustomed to our company’s HQ being in Silicon valley — or at least within the US. Other regions work around our time zone. Other regions align with our cultural and language standards. Not so at TikTok.\n\nGiven Bytedance’s HQ is in Beijing, I had few hours of overlap with half my team, compounded by language barriers. Since more than half my product team sat in China, meetings with that team would start at 6 pm, and sometimes end as late as midnight. I gave up weeknight dinners with my husband, our favorite daily ritual to connect, relax, and unwind, in favor of hurried takeout in front of my laptop. The worst part was, my most stressful meetings like leadership reviews would often take place on Sundays or past 10 PM, leaving me anxious throughout my day and unable to sleep at night.\n\nLanguage barriers exacerbated the difficulty of the time zones. Information flows were often incomplete because both sides found it too time consuming to translate. US teammates were often excluded from important discussions happening at HQ, and vice versa. Miscommunication ran rampant. It’s not surprising if you do the math: we had around 4 hours of overlap a day to collaborate instead of the usual 8 (or, if you work in China, 12.) Layer on language comprehension rate at 75% accuracy on both sides, with either the China team trying to use English (their second language), or the US team trying to use Chinese (for our team’s native speakers only.) So instead of having 8 hours a day to work together, we now had 3 — all of which are in our late evening. I often felt guilty for forcing my Chinese colleagues to speak to me in English, as my business Mandarin wasn’t proficient. Joining meetings, I’d catch them hurriedly using Chinese, and upon noticing me, whisper, “她来了，我们换成英文吧！” (“Oh, she’s here! Let’s switch to English now!”)\n\nUnsurprisingly, our US & China teams cultivated mutual resentment and a lack of benefit of the doubt. Because let’s be honest — collaboration is already hard enough in the same language, in the same time zone, in person.\n\n3. Inability to form trustful relationships with colleagues, due to the pandemic\n\nThe pandemic upended everyone’s way of working and collaborating. But the unique aspect of the pandemic’s role in my experience at Tiktok is how it caused my team in the US to have a drastically different working experience than that of my teammates in China. It was as though both teams were living in different years.. or different worlds.\n\nTeam dynamics were impacted by the fact that China had the pandemic under control, while the US did not. By the time I started at TikTok in July 2020, my teammates in China were already heading back into the office, having happy hours and offsites.\n\nFor my first “offsite” on the job, I remember dialing in to a video call at 9 PM to join the “team bonding” portion. It was month 5 of the pandemic quarantine, and I was exhausted from the isolation and lack of social connection. When the other side of my screen came into focus, I saw my entire team and managers in China sitting in a beautifully lit, glass paned office room, all chatting and laughing — on a high from their trip to Shanghai Disneyland the prior day. At that moment, I didn’t think I could possibly feel more jealous and miserable in my entire life.\n\nAt the end of the day, humans are emotional beings. Proximity matters. It matters for collaboration, for relationship building, for career progression. Our US & China teams sacrificed tremendously for each other in our attempts to collaborate. We gave up hours of our lives and family time (China teammates got up super early, we stayed up super late), language comprehension (English vs. Chinese), project scope…yet we barely knew each other at all. The more we had to collaborate, the more we had to sacrifice, to the point where collaboration felt zero sum. We had no way to visit each other in person, as much as we wanted to. To this day, I still wonder if I could have had a far more positive experience if I just got a chance to visit my team, and they got to visit me.\n\n4. Geopolitics defined our destiny.\n\nFrom Trump’s ban to China’s crackdown on high-flying tech companies, I’m constantly reminded that geopolitics is the heavy hand that shapes the company’s decisions — as well as the fate and fortunes of everyone who works there. Yes, Bytedance is the first Chinese social media company to achieve international success, but they also became the poster child of the US & China conflict; a company caught in the crosshairs. During the deliberation over Trump’s ban, I worried about what would happen to my job and my team. When the Chinese government clamped down on big tech companies that listed on US exchanges, my heart sank. I and many others on my team hoped that Bytedance would be listed in the US. And as US China relations further degrade over the war in Ukraine, I doubt the IPO will happen anytime soon, and I don’t see a path towards Bytedance listing in the US or even Europe. Hong Kong is far more likely.\n\nWhenever I thought too hard about the geopolitical risks while working at Bytedance, I’d experience an existential crisis where I felt that everything that I poured my effort into could be for naught. A successful US TikTok ban, one policy change by Xi Jin Ping— it all could come tumbling down."
