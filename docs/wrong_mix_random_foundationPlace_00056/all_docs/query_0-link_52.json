        "text": "NISO on the Road\n\nAbout this Forum\n\nLibraries have a dizzying array of options for acquiring, implementing, and modifying library resource management systems. The ballooning number of choices reflects the changing character of this marketplace. Commercial vendors now compete not only with each other, but also with widely-publicized open source offerings. When evaluating new and existing systems, libraries attempt to balance sometimes conflicting needs:\n\nMaintain functionality for staff / Offer usable interfaces for patrons\n\nPreserve local individuality / Profit from shared practices\n\nCope with shrinking resources / Crave more development input\n\nValue external service and support / Appraise the advantages of internal creative freedom\n\nJoin NISO for a two-day forum in which we will consider these issues' consequences for customers, users, vendors, and developers. During this event, we will:\n\nExplore the effects of changes to the library community on system suppliers' business models\n\nCompare the benefits and disadvantages of commercial and open-source systems through real libraries' experiences\n\nExamine the implications of placing library systems in the cloud\n\nAddress the need for interoperability between library management systems and other systems at work in the library\n\nConsider how information standards can help all stakeholders cope with this shifting terrain\n\nAttendees at all levels of system involvement and expertise will find thought-provoking discussion and ample opportunity to share ideas with the library, vendor, and developer communities.\n\nTo view the agenda for Day Two of this forum, click here.\n\nEvent Sessions\n\nContinental Breakfast\n\n8:00 a.m. - 9:00 a.m.\n\nWelcome & Introductions\n\nSpeaker\n\nTodd Carpenter\n\nExecutive Director\n\nNISO\n\n9:00 a.m. - 9:15 a.m.\n\nKeynote Presentation: Toward Service-Oriented Librarianship\n\nSpeaker\n\nOren Beit-Arie\n\nChief Strategy Officer\n\nEx Libris, Inc\n\n9:15 a.m. - 10:15 a.m.:\n\nThere are significant changes in the manner in which scholarship is conducted – in research, teaching, and overall in scholarly communication. These changes create new conditions and contexts for libraries, and will impact the way we will all have to operate to be successful. As new forms of scholarship emerge, there seems to be a need for new forms of librarianship and for new models for library services.\n\nThis presentation will look at aspects of tradition, transition and transformation in library processes, and will outline in brief the new framework for Library Services that ExLibris is developing in response to the changes we see.\n\nWhat do libraries want to achieve with their library systems?\n\nSpeakers\n\nRobert Gerrity\n\nAssociate University Librarian for Systems and Information Technology\n\nBoston College Libraries\n\nKevin Kidd\n\nLibrary Applications and Systems Manager\n\nBoston College Libraries\n\n10:15 a.m. - 11:00 a.m.:\n\nUpdate (10/6/09): Thomas Wall will not be able to join this forum. Two of his colleagues will be presenting in his stead\n\nBreak\n\n11:00 a.m. - 11:15 a.m.\n\nUser Perspectives: How Our Patrons Interact with Our Services\n\nSpeaker\n\nJudy Briden\n\nDigital Librarian for Public Services\n\nUniversity of Rochester, River Campus Libraries\n\n11:15 a.m. - 12:00 p.m.:\n\nLed by an anthropologist, staff of the University of Rochester, River Campus Libraries have been conducting user research for more than five years, studying how undergraduates, graduate students, and faculty do their work. Drawing on completed research and a preliminary report of research in progress, Judi will discuss what has been learned from their users.\n\nXC User Research Preliminary Report\n\nLunch\n\n12:00 p.m. - 1:15 p.m.\n\nBuild it Yourself or Buy it?\n\nSpeakers\n\nJohn Culshaw\n\nProfessor and Associate Director for Administrative Services\n\nUniversity of Colorado at Boulder Libraries\n\nArt Rhyno\n\nHead, Systems Department, Leddy Library\n\nUniversity of Windsor\n\nGuoying (Grace) Liu\n\nSystems Librarian, Leddy Library\n\nUniversity of Windsor\n\n1:15 p.m. - 2:00 p.m.:\n\nIn this session, attendees will hear from two library case studies answering questions such as: How do you make the choice? What are the costs/benefits? What was decision making process you went through in choosing your system/implementation?\n\nJohn Culshaw, Professor and Associate Director for Administrative Services, University of Colorado at Boulder Libraries\n\nThe University of Colorado at Boulder Libraries are committed to a \"buy it\" approach for critical library technology platforms. We migrated from the legacy CARL system (which was \"built\" here) to an Innovative Interfaces system in 1994 and have since maintained a strong library-vendor relationship including the recent purchase and launch of Encore as our next-generation discovery platform. Similarly, the Libraries also maintains a Luna Insight instance for its digital library. But we also participate in the Colorado Alliance of Research Libraries' Alliance Digital Repository, a preservation-oriented consortial digital repository developed with open source software. John will discuss how the library makes these choices including the costs and benefits from following this approach.\n\nFrom Voyager to Conifer – the University of Windsor’s Experience\n\n• Art Rhyno, Head, Systems Department, Leddy Library, University of Windsor (contributor)\n\n• Guoying (Grace) Liu, Systems Librarian, Leddy Library, University of Windsor (presenter)\n\nIn May 2009, the University of Windsor Libraries switched from Voyager to Conifer, a consortial implemented Evergreen open source ILS. This presentation will share the experience of migrating from a proprietary system to an open source solution. The focus will be on the issues and challenges encountered, and the interaction of Evergreen with an existing ERM/URM.\n\nPanel discussion: Open Source Systems – What is working/what is progressing?\n\nSpeakers\n\nTim McGeary\n\nLehigh University\n\nAndrew Nagy\n\nDirector of Software Innovation\n\nEBSCO Information Services\n\n2:00 p.m. - 2:45 p.m.:\n\nTim will be giving an update of the OLE Project, including highlights of the finalized design document published in July 2009 and information regarding the OLE Project Build Phase tentatively scheduled to begin January 2010.\n\nAndrew will be giving an update of VuFind, an open source discovery interface. This will cover the history of VuFInd, whats happening now and where it is going in the coming years.\n\nBreak\n\n2:45 p.m. - 3:15 p.m.\n\nBringing Open Source to the Library: Lessons Learned\n\nSpeaker\n\nAnnette Bailey\n\nDigital Assets Librarian\n\nVirginia Polytechnic Institute and State University (Virginia Tech)\n\n3:15 p.m. - 4:00 p.m.:\n\nMore and more libraries are turning to open source software to improve their services. This talk will give the perspective of a librarian who has created, distributed, and adapted open source software for libraries. This talk reports on the experience with the LibX and MAJAX projects, two open source software products that closely interact with vendor systems. The presenter will share lessons learned during the development and adoption of this software, and provide advice for librarians considering combining vendor and open source systems. The talk will discuss the role of existing library technology standards and their benefits, and outline the need for new standards.\n\nLibrary Management Systems Business Models Roundtable\n\nSpeakers\n\nTalin Bingham\n\nChief Technology Officer\n\nSirsiDynix\n\nNeil Block\n\nVice President\n\nWorldwide Sales, Innovative Interfaces, Inc.\n\nGalen Charlton\n\nVice President, Data Services\n\nEquinox\n\nPaul Cope\n\nAuto-Graphics, Inc.\n\nCarl Grant\n\nChief Technology Officer and Associate University Librarian for Knowledge Services\n\nUniversity of Oklahoma\n\nAndrew Pace\n\nNorth Carolina State University\n\n4:00 p.m. - 5:00 p.m.:\n\nFacilitated by Marshall Breeding, Director for Innovative Technologies and Research, Jean and Alexander Heard Library, Vanderbilt University\n\nPanelists:\n\nTalin Bingham, Chief Technology Officer, SirsiDynix\n\nNeil Block, Vice President, Worldwide Sales, Innovative Interfaces, Inc.\n\nGalen Charlton, Vice President of Data Services, Equinox Software, Inc.\n\nPaul R.
