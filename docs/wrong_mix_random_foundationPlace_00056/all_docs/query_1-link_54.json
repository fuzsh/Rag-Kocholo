        "text": "Technology is always changing. Whether it be in our cars, phones or fridges, the latest in gadgetry can help make us more effective and productive — and golf tech is no exception. There is no better way to experience this technological revolution than in the personal launch-monitor space, and one company leading the way in precision, user experience and affordability is FlightScope with its Mevo line, including the Mevo +, which is now on sale for a limited time.\n\nWhy the FlightScope Mevo +?\n\nOne of the main reasons the Mevo + stands out in the radar-based launch monitor space is its standard baseline price of less than $2,500. Out of the box, the unit gives golfers access to 20 practice-focused data points, while also offering the option of higher-level data parameters to be added on for $1,000 (Pro Package) and face impact location for $500. The 50+ data points offered with the pro package puts the Mevo + in the same category as other radar-based launch monitors that cost four to five times as much.\n\nAnother great feature of the unit is the ability to use it inside and out, and its user-friendly interface is intuitively navigated even for beginner launch monitor users. As a golfer who has spent much time working with various launch monitors and helping others troubleshoot units, the Mevo + stands out with its FS Golf app for IOS and Android in how easy it is to configure.\n\nFor those looking to use it as part of their home-simulator setup, the Mevo + connects seamlessly to the popular E6 simulator software so you can play some of the world’s best courses, including Pebble Beach Golf Links, the Old Course at St. Andrews, Harbour Town, and more.\n\nMevo + Pro Package features\n\nThe Mevo + comes fully loaded with no need for a subscription to get started, but for those looking to get more detail on their practice or are looking to use the Mevo + as a club fitting and coaching tool, the Pro Package and Face Impact location (total bundle price $1500 when not on sale) provides everything you need including:\n\nFlightScope Mevo+ Launch Monitor\n\nThis portable launch monitor offers 20 data parameters plus 12 E6 Connect Simulated Golf Courses includes Pebble Beach and St Andrews (iOS and PC).\n\nMevo and Mevo + special pricing details\n\nThe FlightScope Mevo and Mevo + launch monitors are on sale now through until July 22, 2024.\n\nFlightScope Mevo Launch Monitor\n\nThis super compact launch monitor offers 8 Accurate data parameters, free software, no subscriptions and syncs with your phone to automatically record and clip swing videos with data overlay"
