Yet they often struggle to fit the profiles sought by employers. A growing number of companies, including SAP, Hewlett-Packard Enterprise, and Microsoft, have reformed their HR processes in order to access neurodiverse talent—and are seeing productivity gains, quality improvement, boosts in innovative capabilities, and increased employee engagement as a result. The programs vary but have seven major elements in common. Companies should: Team with governments or nonprofits experienced in working with people with disabilities Use noninterview assessment processes Train other workers and managers in what to expect Set up a support system Tailor methods for managing careers Scale the program Mainstream the program The work for managers will be harder, but the payoff to companies will be considerable: access to more of their employees’ talents, along with diverse perspectives that will help them compete.",

        "text": "The Problem\n\nMany people with neurological conditions such as autism spectrum disorder, dyspraxia, and dyslexia have extraordinary skills, including in pattern recognition, memory, and mathematics. But the neurodiverse population remains largely untapped.\n\nThe Cause\n\nConventional recruitment and career-development methods (for example, job interviews) and the belief that scalable work processes require absolute conformity to standardized approaches screen out neurodiverse people who could be valuable employees.\n\nThe Solution\n\nA growing number of companies—among them SAP, Hewlett Packard Enterprise, Microsoft, Willis Towers Watson, and EY—have reformed HR practices to capitalize on the talents of neurodiverse people. In the process, they are becoming better able to fully leverage the skills of all workers."
