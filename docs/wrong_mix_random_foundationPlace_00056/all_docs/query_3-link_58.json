Discussion centers on the sit-ins in Nashville, the philosophy of non-violence, the Freedom Rides, his role in SNCC, and the March on Washington.\n\nFunder\n\nThe original interview elements, 16mm negative and 1/4\" audio reel to reel, were preserved during 2010-2016 due to the generosity of a grant from the Andrew W. Mellon Foundation. Thanks to a grant from the National Historical Publications and Records Commission (NHPRC), the preserved films were digitized to create 10-bit uncompressed HD files and the original 1/4\" elements were digitized to create 24-bit 96kHz .wav files. The picture and audio were then reassembled at the Film & Media Archive."
