With timeboxing, you can prioritize what’s important (as opposed to simply what’s urgent).

I take time management very seriously. I read voraciously on the subject, seek out skilled friends for advice, and have taken online courses to master the latest tactics. To-do lists give me a sense of real satisfaction. On days when all my tasks are complete, I feel like a champion. I adore my planner so much, I have considered taking our relationship to the next level by investing in a bullet journal. (Sadly, I haven’t done that yet.)"
