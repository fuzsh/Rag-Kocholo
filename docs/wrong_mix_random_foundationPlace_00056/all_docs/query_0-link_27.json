Iâve always struggled with my mental health, a lot of task avoidance behavior, decision paralysis, & all the nuances of anxiety. During the hard times this podcast has made me feel less alone, & continues to help me do the things I need to do. â A lovely, funny podcast full of compassion. This is a podcast that helps me stay hopeful. Thank you."
