Â§ 97-141 began to run on September 5, 2023.\n\nAs G.S. Â§ 97-141 states:\n\nAll claims or proceedings under this Chapter to which the insolvent member self-insurer is a party either before the Industrial Commission or a court in this State and the running of all time periods against either the insolvent member self-insurer or the Association under this Chapter shall be stayed for 60 days from the later of the date of notice to the Association of the insolvency or the date the Association is notified of a claim or proceeding under this Chapter in order to permit the Association to investigate, prosecute, or defend properly any petition, claim, or appeal under this Chapter, provided that the payment of weekly compensation for incapacity is made whenever time periods or proceedings affecting the payment of weekly compensation are stayed.\n\nPursuant to the automatic stay required by G.S. Â§ 97-141, the Industrial Commission has stayed all workersâ compensation proceedings against Yellow Corporation and its subsidiaries, and the Commission has stayed the running of all time periods against Yellow Corporation, its subsidiaries, and the North Carolina Self-Insurance Security Association (NCSISA) in all workersâ compensation claims or proceedings in which Yellow Corporation or a subsidiary of Yellow Corporation is a party, for a period of 60 days beginning September 5, 2023. Provided, however, that consistent with the language of G.S. Â§ 97-141, this 60-day automatic stay does not apply to the payment of weekly compensation for incapacity that is otherwise due and payable.\n\nYellow Corporation Insolvency Information\n\nOn August 6, 2023, Yellow Corporation filed a Chapter 11 petition for bankruptcy in the United States Bankruptcy Court for the District of Delaware. On August 23, 2023, Yellow Corporation notified the North Carolina Self-Insurance Security Association (NCSISA) that it has discontinued funding for all self-insured workersâ compensation programs, including those in the State of North Carolina. On August 23, 2023, after conferring with the North Carolina Department of Insurance, NCSISA notified the Industrial Commission that Yellow Corporationâs Chapter 11 bankruptcy filing and subsequent default constitute an insolvency in accordance with N.C. Gen. Stat. Â§ 97-135.\n\nAll North Carolina workersâ compensation claims against Yellow Corporation and its subsidiaries are now being transferred to NCSISA, and NCSISA is in the process of reviewing case files in accordance with its statutory mandate.\n\nPursuant to N.C. Gen. Stat. Â§ 97-133(a)(4), NCSISA is obligated to pay âcovered claimsâ of Yellow Corporation upon default. A âcovered claimâ means an unpaid claim against an insolvent self-insurer that relates to an injury that occurred while the self-insurer was a member of the NCSISA. (N.C. Gen. Stat. Â§ 97-130(4)). Yellow Corporation has been a member of the NCSISA since October 1, 1986.\n\nPursuant to N.C. Gen. Stat. Â§ 97-141, NCSISA is entitled to a 60-day stay on all claims or proceedings under the North Carolina Workersâ Compensation Act to which Yellow Corporation is a party. This 60-day period runs from the later of the date of the notice to the NCSISA of the insolvency or the date NCSISA is notified of a claim or proceeding under the North Carolina Workersâ Compensation Act. However, N.C. Gen. Stat. Â§ 97-141 also provides that âthe payment of weekly compensation for incapacity is made whenever time periods or proceedings affecting the payment of weekly compensation are stayed.\n\nAny questions regarding a North Carolina workersâ compensation claim against Yellow Corporation or any of its subsidiaries should be directed to: Catherine Stuart, Stuart Law Firm, PLLC, General Counsel to NCSISA at cstuart@stuartlawfirm.com. Other inquiries may be directed to NCSISA at www.ncsisa.org.\n\nExpedited Hearing Requests in Cases Not Involving an Expedited Medical Motion or an Appeal of a Form 23 or Form 24 Decision\n\nThe Industrial Commission has received several recent inquiries about the procedure for requesting an expedited hearing in a case that does not involve an expedited medical motion under G.S. Â§97-25(f)(2) and does not involve an appeal of a Form 23 or Form 24 decision by the Executive Secretaryâs Office. In such a case, the proper procedure is for the party filing the Form 33 Request for Hearing to additionally file via EDFP a Motion to Dispense with Mediation with the Dispute Resolution Coordinator. As with all motions in workersâ compensation claims, the Industrial Commissionâs Motions Practice rule (11 NCAC 23A .0609) applies. A link to the Motions Practice rule can be found here.\n\n28th Annual N.C.

Among the amended Superior Court mediation rules is Rule 4, which governs attendance at Superior Court mediations.\n\nAttendance at Industrial Commission mediations is governed by Rule 104 of the Industrial Commissionâs mediation rules (11 NCAC 23G .0104), which can be found here. Paragraph (b) of Rule 104 provides that the attendance method for Industrial Commission mediations shall be the same as the attendance method set forth in Rule 4 of the Rules for Mediated Settlement Conferences and Other Settlement Procedures in Superior Court Civil Actions. Therefore, the Rule 4 amendments affect the way the attendance method will be determined in Industrial Commission mediations beginning May 1, 2023.\n\nUnder the Rule 4 amendments, if all parties and the mediator agree on the mediation attendance method (which can be remote, in-person, or a hybrid of the two where some parties are participating remotely while others are together in-person), then the mediation will be held using the agreed-upon attendance method. If an agreement on the attendance method cannot be reached, then attendance will be in-person unless the mediator has designated in the Dispute Resolution Commissionâs Mediator Information Directory that he or she will only conduct remote mediations. However, in all cases, a party who is required to attend the mediation may file a motion with the Industrial Commission Dispute Resolution Coordinator asking that a different method of attendance be ordered. (For example, a party who wishes to participate remotely but who does not object to others participating in-person may file a motion requesting an order allowing a hybrid of remote and in-person attendance at the mediation).\n\nA link to the Dispute Resolution Commissionâs Mediator Search page and Mediator Information Directory can be found here. To determine the attendance method designation, if any, made by a mediator, click on âFind a Mediator,â then click on âMediated Settlement Conference Mediators (Superior Court)\", then type in the name of the mediator and click on âSearch.â You will then see the mediatorâs profile. Look under âKey Wordsâ to see the attendance method designation, if any, made by the mediator.\n\nTo help the parties in Industrial Commission cases better visualize the effect of the Rule 4 changes on Industrial Commission mediations, the Commission has created a flowchart, which can be found here.\n\nAmber May to Serve as Chief Operating Officer Effective June 1, 2023\n\nThe Industrial Commission is pleased to announce that Amber May will serve as its Chief Operating Officer effective June 1, 2023.\n\nMay currently serves as the Commissionâs General Counsel, having returned to the Commission in March of 2022 after eight years as Rules Review Commission Counsel at the North Carolina Office of Administrative Hearings.

Before that, May worked as a Staff Attorney for Legal Aid of North Carolina, where she represented clients in a wide variety of civil matters and gained substantial litigation experience.\n\nMayâs professional background also includes significant human resources experience. Prior to law school, she worked as a Benefits Specialist, first for the University of North Carolina Hospitals and then for the North Carolina Administrative Office of the Courts.\n\nMay earned her law degree from North Carolina Central University School of Law and her bachelorâs degree in Business Administration from Meredith College.\n\nPamela T. Young to Retire from Industrial Commission Effective June 1, 2023\n\nAfter 29 years of impactful public service, the Industrial Commissionâs Chief Operating Officer, Pamela T.

Wallace to serve as a Deputy Commissioner beginning March 13, 2023.\n\nWallace began practicing workersâ compensation law in 1998, and he has represented both plaintiffs and defendants in workersâ compensation cases. He is a North Carolina State Bar Board Certified Specialist in workersâ compensation law and a North Carolina Dispute Resolution Commission certified mediator. Wallace is a former Chair of the North Carolina Bar Associationâs Workersâ Compensation Section, and when North Carolina adopted the Uniform Bar Examination, he served on the North Carolina Board of Law Examinersâ committee that formulated the Workersâ Compensation portion of the North Carolina-specific component of the exam.

Williams School of Law.\n\nWallace will be assigned to the Commissionâs Charlotte regional office.\n\nPhilip A. Baddour, III Reappointed to the Full Commission\n\nGovernor Roy Cooper has reappointed Philip A. Baddour, III to serve a second six-year term as a Commissioner on the North Carolina Industrial Commission beginning May 1, 2023, subject to confirmation by the North Carolina General Assembly.\n\nIn March of 2017, Baddour was appointed by Governor Cooper to serve his first term as a Commissioner, and he was confirmed by the General Assembly in June of 2017. In February of 2019, Governor Cooper designated Baddour as the Chair of the Industrial Commission. Baddour previously served as a Deputy Commissioner at the Industrial Commission for 17 years.\n\nBefore joining the Industrial Commission, Baddour practiced law in his hometown of Goldsboro, North Carolina from 1996 to 1999, primarily representing plaintiffs in the areas of workers' compensation and tort litigation. In 1999, he joined the North Carolina Department of Justice as an Assistant Attorney General, defending State agencies in workers' compensation and tort claim actions. Baddour also previously served as a JAG Officer in the North Carolina National Guard.\n\nBaddour received his B.A. degree from the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill in 1992 and earned his law degree from Campbell University in 1996.\n\nNew Procedure: Report of Mediator Fee Invoices to be Emailed when Mediator Appointed\n\nOn Monday, February 20, 2023, the Industrial Commission will begin emailing Report of Mediator fee invoices at the time the mediator is appointed. The Report of Mediator invoice will be sent to defense counsel by email shortly after the Appointment of Mediator Order is emailed.\n\nThis new procedure, which was created in response to stakeholder feedback, will give employers and carriers additional time to process and pay Report of Mediator fees. Upon receipt of the Report of Mediator invoice, the $200 fee can be paid online via credit card (MasterCard or Visa) or e-Check. A link for online payment will be provided in the email. The $200 fee also may be paid by paper check mailed to the Industrial Commission.\n\nWhile the Industrial Commission strongly encourages early payment of Report of Mediator fees to avoid past due invoices, this new procedure does not change the Report of Mediator fee due date (i.e., payment of the $200 Report of Mediator fee is due no later than seven (7) days from the deadline for completing mediation or seven (7) days from the date mediation is completed, whichever is earlier). With the ability to pay Report of Mediator fees early, however, employers and carriers can avoid the risk of late payment (which may subject them to statutory penalties and interest) and can more efficiently manage and bring closure to their case files.\n\nThe Industrial Commission hopes that employers and carriers will take advantage of the extra time to process and pay Report of Mediator fees afforded by this new procedure. Ensuring timely payment of Report of Mediator fees is an important element of the mediation process and is essential to the Industrial Commissionâs ability to fund its operations.\n\nElias W.

The Commission discovered inaccuracies in these fee schedule tables, and it has corrected these inaccuracies to align the information in the 2022 fee schedule tables with the requirements of N.C.
