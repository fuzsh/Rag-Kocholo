Save time and shed the stress that too often accompanies critical, behind-the-scenes tasks.\n\n“Within one year of working with Skyward, our staff were able to do more than they had done in 10 years with our previous student and financial information systems.”\n\nRoxie Schafer\n\nGarden City Public Schools, KS\n\n“People didn&rsquo;t even know how many days off they had banked before Skyward helped automate the process. Now they can view their requests and approvals within seconds and I can approve their requests right from my phone. Even better, the training took less than a minute for each employee.”\n\nDr. Lisa Parker\n\nStreator Elementary School District #44, IL\n\n“We are able to operate with fewer administrative employees than other districts. Most require approximately five to six systems to accomplish what we do with just one.”\n\nRick Bates\n\nRapid City Area Schools, SD\n\n“The fact that Skyward keeps on top of all of the different state requirements and adjusts the programs as needed in time to complete reports is of great value. I know the time savings in completing state reports alone is well over 200 hours, if I had to do the calculations asked for manually.”\n\nNancy Toll\n\nHudson School District, WI\n\n“Eliminating timecards has been the biggest savings. We used to print out everyone&rsquo;s timecards every other week&hellip; It used to take a day and a half just to print timecards and then enter the hours. Now, it is a day to completely process payroll.”\n\nChar Ruhbeck\n\nFrankfort School District 157C, IL\n\nSteadfast support\n\nIf an issue arises, you won't be left to fend for yourself.
