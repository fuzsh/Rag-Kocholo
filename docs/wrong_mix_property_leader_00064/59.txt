ISLAMABAD, April 27: Former prime minister Benazir Bhutto was posthumously awarded the prestigious International Peace Award for 2007 at a ceremony held in Ireland’s coastal town of Tipperary.

Tipperary is the largest inland county on the southwestern Irish coast and a popular tourist destination.

The award was earlier conferred on former South African President Nelson Mandela, former Soviet president Mikhail Gorbachev, former US president Bill Clinton, US Senator George Mitchell and Lebanese Prime Minister late Rafiq Hariri, says a press release.

Ms Bhutto’s long-time aide Bashir Riaz received the award on behalf of the Bhutto family. Mr Riaz led a large delegation from Pakistan and UK and received the award amid thunderous applause, with the audience giving a standing ovation to the late leader.

PPP co-chairman Asif could not attend the ceremony because of his political engagements in the country.

He sent a message saying that the award was glowing testimony of the international recognition for Ms Bhutto’s life-long endeavour for democracy.

Prime Minister Syed Yusuf Raza Gilani sent a message of thanks in which he said: “The addition of Ms Benazir Bhutto’s name in the prestigious list is a source of pride and inspiration for Pakistanis.”

Pakistan’s High Commissioner-designate to Britain Wajid Shamsul Hassan said that Ms Bhutto had never given up hope for the betterment of the people of Pakistan. “She was a brave woman who could not be deterred by anything if the issue involved principles,” he said.

“She was there to inspire us when some of us would feel down or give up hope about the state of affairs in Pakistan.”

“Ms Bhutto’s relentless struggle for restoration of democracy and peace convinced the Tipperary Peace Committee to decide the award in her favour,” Committee Secretary Martin Quinn said while announcing the award. Ireland’s Minister of State for Health and Children Maire Hoctor formally presented the award.
