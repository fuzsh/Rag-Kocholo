Founded in 1940, the Peabody is the also the oldest electronic media award in the world, recognising excellence, distinguished achievement, and meritorious public service.

The first radio awards were presented in 1941, the first TV awards in 1948, the first cable TV awards in 1981, and the first website awards in 2003.
