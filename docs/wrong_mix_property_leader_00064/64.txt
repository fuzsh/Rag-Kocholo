Among prizes for electronic media â radio, television, interactive and new media â the George Foster Peabody Awards are considered the most prestigious.

Founded in 1940, the Peabody is the also the oldest electronic media award in the world, recognising excellence, distinguished achievement, and meritorious public service.

The first radio awards were presented in 1941, the first TV awards in 1948, the first cable TV awards in 1981, and the first website awards in 2003.

Honouring content from large broadcast networks to tiny online outlets, from popular entertainment programmes to independently produced documentaries, the Peabody Awards seek out “excellence on its own terms”.

The awards are administered by the University of Georgia’s Grady College of Journalism and Mass Communication.
