        "text": "“The Muslim world's two leading stateswomen braved artillery fire during a visit here Wednesday to show solidarity with besieged civilians and appeal to fellow world leaders to defend the European ideals that would be destroyed by a division of Bosnia.” – February 3rd, 1994. Los Angeles Times.\n\nThe year was 1994. Bosnia was reeling from a bloody civil war and genocide of ethnic Bosnian Muslims was questioning world conscience. The Bosnians had few friends and Prime Ministers, both women, of two countries who were sympathetic towards Bosnian cause were visiting the capital Sarajevo in February 1994. Pakistan’s Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto and Turkish Prime Minister Tansu Ciller were only months into their terms as Prime Minister. But they were among the first Heads of government to visit the country.\n\nAs Serbs shelled the city, the two women made their way through the town in armored personnel carriers to visit the Presidency and hospitals where they distributed gifts and sweets to the children affected by the violence. Hardly a relief for the people who were besieged in their own city, but the images of two women draped in signature blue jackets of the United Nations, in the middle of a civil war, was a statement enough for the world to know that the fledgling nation of Bosnia-Herzegovina won’t be left on its own.\n\n\"We are here less as prime ministers and more as mothers, as daughters, as wives, as women, to show solidarity with the suffering people of Bosnia and also to draw world attention to this place where so much suffering is taking place”, Ms Bhutto stated while talking to press. Later she appeared on Bosnian national television with her Turk counterpart, “if the world community cannot act to end the killing, then at least the arms embargo should be lifted to permit the people of Bosnia to defend themselves”, she hinted towards possible assistance from Pakistan in terms of arms. Weeks later, Pakistan pledged 3,000 army personnel to contribute to United Nations peacekeeping force, which was still under deliberation.\n\nSuch is the legacy of late Benazir Bhutto. She made hers and Pakistan’s presence felt at a stage where few had ventured. Pakistan had stood up to a genocide that was unfolding in the heart of Europe.\n\nSixteen years later, about two years after her death, Shaheed Benazir Bhutto Award was announced in various disciplines to commemorate her birth anniversary in 2010. Her husband, and then President, Asif Ali Zardari announced the Benazir Award for Democracy for Burmese politician Aung San Suu Kyi, in recognition of her struggle for democracy. The Burmese politician had spent better part of her life under house arrest since 1989. It didn’t raise any eyebrows as observers had been drawing comparisons between struggles of BB and Suu Kyi; both were daughters of former statesmen, they had borne the brunt of dictators in their own countries and their lives were marked by demands for return to democracy.\n\nPresident Zardari, while on a state visit to Myanmar in January 2012, himself conferred the award on Suu Kyi, who by then had been released from house arrest. One Pakistani daily quoted him on the occasion, “I’m sure she (Suu Kyi) will be this century’s leader to be remembered by the coming generation”. The first wave of violence against Rohingya Muslims of Rakhine started same year.\n\nMs Suu Kyi has been in office as the State Counsellor of Myanmar for more than a year. The situation in Rakhine has deteriorated to the point where more than half of the Rohingya Muslims now live as refugees in other countries. The world has taken notice of the systematic ethnic cleansing after decades of denial as Rohingyas continued to live as aliens in their own lands. Aung San Suu Kyi has chosen to remain silent on their plight, even deny any persecution as refugees pour across Bangladesh. Probably her struggle for a return to democracy was meant for selective groups of her country. Her conscience does not make her take a stance on a genocide that takes place right under her watch. That’s certainly not worthy of a medal that bears the name of a woman who was among the most vocal against a similar genocide.\n\nThe world has changed since 1994. Pakistan has long abandoned taking center stage at world forums. Perhaps Pakistan’s current fiscal proximity to certain states does not permit a more astute stand on the Rohingya question. But surely there must be diplomatic ways for the Government of Pakistan to pursue and demand Ms Suu Kyi to return her Shaheed Benazir Bhutto Award. Perhaps civil activists in Pakistan may consider taking it up, since many of them have been signing petitions for her to return her Nobel Peace Prize. Else, as long as Ms Suu Kyi’s profile continues to mention her as the recipient of the award, a mockery of late Benazir Bhutto’s legacy will be made."
