        "text": "Pakistan's former prime minister, Benazir Bhutto, was last week sentenced in her absence to five years' imprisonment for corruption, disqualified from holding public office and fined more than $8 million.\n\nThe high court in the city of Rawalpindi handed the same sentence to her senator husband, Asif Ali Zardari, who has been held at a Karachi jail since 1996. He faces other charges, including involvement in the murder of his brother-in-law.\n\nThe court also found Bhutto - daughter of the late prime minister Zulfikar Ali Bhutto and Pakistan's only woman prime minister - and Zardari guilty of receiving kickbacks on a government contract with a Swiss firm during her second term of office in 1994. The prosecution alleged that the contract was awarded for illegal monetary gain, leading to huge financial loss to the national exchequer.\n\nThe verdict was the first reached in a series of trials on charges of widespread corruption during Bhutto's two terms in office. It was not clear if she had been immediately stripped of her membership of the national assembly.\n\nBhutto's second government was dismissed abruptly by President Farooq Leghari in 1996 amid allegations of widespread corruption and economic incompetence. Her first term as prime minister came to a similar end in 1990.\n\nIn all, Bhutto and her husband have been accused of stealing as much as $100 million - charges they deny.\n\nBhutto, who was visiting London at the time of the verdict, said that although she would be arrested on her return to Pakistan, she would go back. It is expected that her lawyers will lodge an appeal with the supreme court.\n\nIn Islamabad officials of Bhutto's Pakistan People's party denounced the high court in Rawalpindi, saying: \"It was a kangaroo trial by a kangaroo court.\"\n\nBut the government of Nawaz Sharif - her arch rival - was delighted with the verdict.\n\nSenator Saifur Rehman, a senior member of the ruling party and the man who has spearheaded the campaign to have Bhutto convicted of corruption, said it was a \"foolproof case of corruption and money-laundering\", which they would have no difficulty defending at appeal hearings.\n\nThe information minister, Mushahid Hussain, said the verdict was a crucial judgment \"because for the first time a ranking politician has been convicted for corruption\", setting the precedent for a new culture of accountability within Pakistan's notoriously corrupt political ÂŽlite.\n\nPublic reaction is likely to be mixed. Many Pakistanis, including Bhutto's traditional supporters, have felt let down by her during her time in office.\n\nWhen she first took power there were high expectations that she would introduce reforms to establish democracy and the rule of law in the country after a decade of military rule. But few progressive measures were introduced, and public anger mounted as allegations of corruption emerged. Zardari was particularly disliked.\n\nThe devastating defeat of Bhutto's party in the 1997 elections bore testimony to the extent of public disillusionment. But many people sympathise with Bhutto's claims that the allegations of corruption against her were part of a \"political witchhunt\" by the government to eliminate the opposition.\n\nDespite winning a huge majority in the elections two years ago, the prime minister, Mr Sharif, has systematically removed anyone he believes threatens his grip on political power.\n\nSo far the chief justice of the supreme court, the president and the chief of the army staff have all been forced to resign and have been replaced by candidates believed sympathetic to the regime.\n\nThere has also been a vicious campaign against sections of the press perceived as being too critical of the government.\n\nMore importantly for the opposition, however, Mr Sharif has changed the organisation of the body set up to investigate corruption cases, to ensure that his right-hand man, Senator Rehman, has been able to control which cases have gone to trial in the courts."
