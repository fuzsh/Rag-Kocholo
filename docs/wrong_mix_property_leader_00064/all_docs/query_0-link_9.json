        "text": "UNITED NATIONS — The son of slain Pakistani former-Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto defended his mother’s human rights record Wednesday after accepting a posthumous U.N. prize in her honor.\n\nBilawal Bhutto Zardari accepted the United Nations Prize in the Field of Human Rights reading a prescient quotation from the autobiography his mother had written before her Dec. 2007 assassination. In the book she said she realized returning to her homeland could cost her life, but she did so because “democracy in Pakistan is not just important for Pakistanis it is important for the entire world.”\n\nBut at a press conference following the ceremony, Zardari had to defend his mother’s human rights record during her two terms as Prime Minister from 1998-1990 and 1993-1996, during which time Amnesty International documented hundreds extra-judicial killings by government forces and the jailing of human right defenders, including journalists.\n\n“My mother did everything humanly possible to ensure both democracy and human rights in Pakistan, her governments were undermined by rogue elements within the establishment at the time,” Zardari said. “It was not her who committed any of these crimes and she did everything she could to stop anything of this sort happening.”\n\nZardari, whose father is now the country’s president, acknowledged that many challenges remain in the area of human rights and that they will not likely get the attention they deserve in the face of problems with terrorism and the global economy.\n\nHe urged Pakistani youth to reject extremist interpretations of Islam, which he defended as a religion of peace.\n\nHe also defended his decision to assume, together with his father, the helm of Bhutto’s Pakistan People’s Party in the wake of his mother’s death, saying it had to be looked at in the context of what happened after she was killed.\n\n“Had we not been able to calm the situation as much as possible, our country would not exist today,” Zardari said.\n\nThe UN prize is awarded every five years on Dec. 10 – the anniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, which completed 60 years Wednesday.\n\nOther winners this year included former-U.S. Attorney General Ramsey Clark; slain U.S. nun and Amazon rain forest defender Dorothy Stang; the group Human Rights Watch; Dr. Carolyn Gomes, co-founder of Jamaicans for Justice; Dr. Denis Mukwege who founded a hospital in the Democratic Republic of Congo to treat victims of sexual violence; and Canadian human rights lawyer Louise Arbour.\n\nPast winners have included Dr. Martin Luther King, Jimmy Carter, Amnesty International and Nelson Mandela.\n\n(This version corrects that Zardari’s father is president, instead of prime minister.)"
