It is awarded every five years.\n\nThe UN said the award is given to individuals and organisations in recognition of their outstanding contribution to the promotion and protection of human rights and fundamental freedoms.\n\nPrevious recipients have included Nelson Mandela, Amnesty International,\n\nJimmy Carter, Eleanor Roosevelt, and the Reverend Martin Luther King Jr.\n\n“As we mark the 60th anniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, we acknowledge the tireless work and invaluable contribution of these individuals and organisations that have fought to see the rights and freedoms embodied in this historic document become a reality for people in all corners of the world,” d’Escoto Brockmann said."
