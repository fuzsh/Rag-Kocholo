        "text": "Benazir Bhutto was the first female prime minister of Pakistan and the first female Muslim prime minister in the world. She is an inspiration not only to women around the world but to every individual.\n\nWe work hard to ensure Bhutto students feel part of the House community by building friendships and encouraging team spirit.\n\nIn the spirit of Bhutto, we are strong, resilient and courageous in order to be the best we can be. We create a society of students who look up to Benazir Bhutto and look out for each other throughout their time at Beaconsfield High.\n\nHi, my name is Vanya and I'm one of your new Heads of House for Bhutto! Alice and I are really looking forward to getting to know you all and are very excited to be your Heads of Bhutto this year.\n\nWithin this role, I hope to inspire house pride within all of you, and organise fun competitions, whilst also creating a fun, and inclusive environment where everyone feels happy. I also hope that I can act as a friendly face for the younger years and support in any way possible. Hopefully, we can win the House cup at the end of the year!\n\nI am currently studying Biology, Chemistry and Maths at A-Level, and my hobbies include baking, reading and swimming.\n\nHi, I am Alice, one of your new Heads of Bhutto House!\n\nI study biology, maths and psychology, and am hoping to pursue a career in maths or neuroscience, I am still clueless! In my spare time I love to play, coach and umpire hockey, primarily at Amersham and Chalfont Hockey Club. Other than sports, I enjoy cooking, socialising with friends and pub quizzes.\n\nAs a prefect, my main aims are to be a friendly face around school that anyone can approach at any time, to improve student well-being and inclusivity. I am really pleased to be Head of House as I want to inspire house pride and spirit (and a bit of competitiveness) throughout Bhutto, helping us bond as a House. I am looking forward to sports day this year especially, as well as all the inter-House events that will be a chance to work together as a house, hopefully winning the House cup!"
