        "text": "INTRODUCTION\n\nHuman rights are the rights that all individual are entitle to and they ensure the dignity of every person. Human rights, being inalienable, universal, interconnected & indivisible, are the minimum standards of legal, civil and political freedom that are granted universally. All human are entitled to freedom, security and decent standards of living concurrently. It has been experienced that those societies flourish well where the rights of the people are delivered, protected and observed freely. Projection of human rights is the fundamental pre-requisite for creating an inclusive and just society. The Government of Sindh, sensing the importance of the issue and being aware of its responsibility, established a Human Rights Directorate in September, 2008 under the control of Law, Parliamentary Affairs and Human Rights Department.\n\nFully realizing the heterogeneous nature and composition of the society prevailing in the Sindh province, where in recent past a sudden rise of complex nature of human rights violations has witnessed and to effectively address the issues relating to human rights violation the Human Rights Department was given an independent entity with full-fledged concentration and established as separate Department in December, 2016. The mandate assigned was to deal with the complaints and allegation of human rights violation and collect information and reports on such complaints from other departments and agencies.\n\nThe Department has been further strengthened by placing following attached department under its domain for checking the human rights violation in its true spirit.\n\nDirectorate of Human Rights\n\nSindh Human Rights Commission\n\nTreaty Implementation Cell\n\nThese three attached departments are actively engaged in the resolution of human rights issues related to individual and public interest and have also played a role as watchdog to oversee the human rights situation in Sindh Province holistically. Human Rights Department has been endeavoring to ensure that the Human Rights of the people in the province are fully realized and protected in law, in policy and in practice.\n\nREDRESS YOUR GRIEVANCES THROUGH COMPLAINT LODGING MECHANISM FOR EMERGENCY HELPLINE CONTACTS\n\nSindh Child Protection Authority\n\nGovernment of Sindh\n\nComplaints Related to Child Rights\n\n(Please Click Here)\n\nHelpline No.\n\n1121\n\nWomen Development Department\n\nGovernment of Sindh\n\nComplaints Related to Women Rights\n\nHelpline No.\n\n1094\n\nMinorities Affairs Department\n\nGovernment of Sindh\n\nComplaints Related to Minority Rights\n\nContact No.\n\n021-99206184\n\nLegal Aid Society\n\nComplaints Related to Legal Aid\n\n(Please Click Here)\n\nHelpline No.\n\n0800-70806\n\nSindh Police Helpline\n\nComplaints Related to Police\n\n(Please Click Here)\n\nHelpline No.\n\n15\n\nPakistan United Society Legal\n\nComplaints Related to Legal Aid\n\n(Please Click Here)\n\nContact No.\n\n021-34011698\n\nWomen Protection Unit-Madadgar\n\nComplaints Related to Women Protection\n\n(Please Click Here)\n\nHelpline No.\n\n1098\n\nCyber Harassment\n\nComplaints Related to Cyber Harassment\n\n(Please Click Here)\n\nHelpline No.\n\n0800-39393\n\nSindh Chief Minister's Public Complaint Cell\n\nGovernment of Sindh\n\nComplaints Related to Legal Aid\n\n(Please Click Here)\n\nHelpline No.\n\n0800-91915"
