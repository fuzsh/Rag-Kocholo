        "text": "The son of Pakistan's murdered ex-Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto has promised to fight militancy to maintain democracy, in his first major political speech.\n\nBilawal Bhutto Zardari told party supporters marking five years since his mother's death that she \"sacrificed her life to uphold democracy\".\n\nMs Bhutto died in a gun and bomb attack during her 2007 election campaign.\n\nHer son, whose father is President Asif Ali Zardari, has so far kept a low profile as party chairman.\n\nIn remarks carried by Pakistan state television, Mr Bhutto Zardari told a crowd of tens of thousands of Pakistan People's Party (PPP) supporters near his family's shrine in Sindh province that the people were \"the source of power\".\n\n\"The beacon of democracy continues to shine,\" he said, pledging that his party would fight militancy and extremism to create a peaceful, democratic Pakistan.\n\nHe cannot contest an election until his 25th birthday, which falls next September, some months after a parliamentary vote is due.\n\nIt was the first time that Pakistanis had heard Mr Bhutto Zardari speak live on radio and TV and he drew heavily on his family's dynastic role at the heart of the country's politics.\n\n\"Bhutto is an emotion, a love,\" he was quoted as saying, adding that however many Bhuttos were killed, even more would emerge.\n\nOver the next few months, Mr Bhutto Zardari is expected to play a bigger role in party politics, the BBC's Shahzeb Jillani reports from the event in the city of Larkana.\n\nBut our correspondent says it will be a while before he emerges from the shadow of President Zardari, who will remain the de facto PPP head and its chief strategist in its bid to return to power next year.\n\nStressing his family's political legacy, Mr Bhutto Zardari said the party's focus was and would remain on \"food, clothes and homes\".\n\nAlthough the PPP government faced considerable challenges from terrorism and a global recession, Pakistan's economy was standing on its own two feet, he said.\n\nPresident Zardari, who also addressed the crowd, promised that next year's vote would be free and fair and would not be postponed."
