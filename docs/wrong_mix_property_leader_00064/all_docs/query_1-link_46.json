        "text": "Washington: A documentary on the life of Benazir Bhutto has received a prestigious George Foster Peabody Award for electronic media the US.\n\n\"Bhutto\" is a 111-minute documentary about the two-time Pakistani Prime Minister who was assassinated in Rawalpindi while campaigning in 2007, the Associated Press of Pakistan reported.\n\nThe documentary received the award at a glittering ceremony held in New York.\n\nBhutto's son Bilawal Bhutto Zardari, who is the Chairman of the ruling Pakistan People's Party, attended the award ceremony with his aunt Sanam Bhutto.\n\nHollywood actor Patrick Stewart of \"X-Men\" fame presented the awards.\n\nAmong prizes for electronic media - radio, television, interactive and new media - the George Foster Peabody Awards are considered the most prestigious.\n\nFounded in 1940, the Peabody is the also the oldest electronic media award in the world, recognising excellence, distinguished achievement, and meritorious public service.\n\nThe first radio awards were presented in 1941, the first TV awards in 1948, the first cable TV awards in 1981, and the first website awards in 2003.\n\nHonouring content from large broadcast networks to tiny online outlets, from popular entertainment programmes to independently produced documentaries, the Peabody Awards seek out \"excellence on its own terms\".\n\nThe awards are administered by the University of Georgia's Grady College of Journalism and Mass Communication."
