        "text": "RAWALPINDI, Pakistan (CBS/AP) -- Opposition leader Benazir Bhutto died Thursday from injuries sustained in a suicide attack, a party aide said.\n\nThe bomb went off just minutes after Bhutto spoke to thousands of supporters and she appeared to be the target of the attack. Farahtullah Babar, the spokesman for her party, said her vehicle was about 50 yards away from blast which went off as she was leaving the rally venue.\n\nA senior military official, who spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to comment, confirmed that Bhutto had died.\n\nPolice official Saud Aziz said it was a suicide attack.\n\nParty security adviser says Bhutto was shot in the neck and chest as she got into her vehicle, then gunman blew himself up.\n\n\"At 6:16 p.m. she expired,\" said Wasif Ali Khan, a member of Bhutto's party who was at Rawalpindi General Hospital.\n\nHer supporters at the hospital began chanting \"Dog, Musharraf, dog,\" referring to Pakistan's president.\n\nSome of them smashed the glass door at the main entrance of the emergency unit, others burst into tears. One man with a flag of Pakistan People's Party tied around his head was beating his chest.\n\nSen. Babar Awan, Bhutto's lawyer, said, \"The surgeons confirmed that she has been martyred.\"\n\nAt least 20 others were killed in the blast that took place as Bhutto left a political rally where she addressed thousands of supporters to canvas votes for Jan. 8 parliamentary elections.\n\nAn AP reporter at the scene saw body parts and flesh scattered at the back gate of the Liaqat Bagh park in Rawalpindi where the rally was held. He counted about 20 bodies, including police, and could see many other wounded.\n\nThe road outside was stained with blood and people screamed for ambulances. Others gave water to the wounded lying in the street. The clothing of some of the victims was shredded and people put party flags over their bodies.\n\nOn Thursday, hundreds of people were forced to pass through metal detectors and undergo body searches before entering a sprawling public park decorated with the red, black and green flags of Bhutto's party and massive portraits of her with local candidates running in Jan. 8 parliamentary elections.\n\nIn recent weeks, suicide bombers have repeatedly targeted security forces in Rawalpindi, a city near the capital where Musharraf stays and the Pakistan army has its headquarters.\n\nBhutto served twice as Pakistan's prime minister between 1988 and 1996. She had returned to Pakistan from an eight-year exile on Oct. 18.\n\nHer homecoming parade in Karachi was also targeted by a suicide attacker, killing more than 140 people. On that occasion she narrowly escaped injury.\n\nEarlier Thursday, pro-government supporters waged an afternoon gunbattle with backers of opposition party politician Nawaz Sharif at a political rally outside the capital, killing four people, police said.\n\nThe parliamentary election is scheduled for Jan. 8.\n\nSadiq ul-Farooq, a spokesman for Sharif's party, said the opposition leader was about 1.3 miles away when pro-government party supporters opened fire on people gathering for a rally at Karal Chowk, near the airport about 10 miles outside Islamabad.\n\n\"Nawaz Sharif and his procession are safe, but we have received reports that a few people were wounded and maybe a few suffered fatal injuries,\" ul-Farooq said. All the injured were from Sharif's Pakistan Muslim League-N group.\n\nPakistan's private ARY news channel quoted Sharif as saying the government had deliberately not provided security to his backers.\n\nImtiaz Ranjha, a spokesman or the ruling Pakistan Muslim League-Q party, condemned the attack and accused Sharif's supporters of provoking the fight. The party called for those involved to be punished, he said.\n\nLocal police chief Mohammed Hussain confirmed that four people were killed and three were wounded in the fighting.\n\nZaman Shami, an official at the police control room, said police were trying to determine who initiated the attack.\n\nThe Associated Press and CBS News contributed to this report.\n\n***\n\nFrom the Women's International Center web site:\n\nOn December 2, 1988 Benazir Bhutto was sworn in as Prime Minister of Pakistan, becoming the first woman to head the government of an Islamic State.\n\nIn the preceding decade of political struggle, Ms. Bhutto was arrested on numerous occasions; in all she spent nearly 6 years either in prison or under detention for her dedicated leadership of the then opposition Pakistan Peoples Party. Throughout the years in opposition, she pledged to transform Pakistani society by focusing attention on programs for health, social welfare and education for the underprivileged.\n\nWhile Prime Minister, Benazir Bhutto emphasized the need to heal past wounds and to put an end to the divisions in Pakistani society -- including reducing discrimination between men and women. Ms. Bhutto also launched a nationwide program of health and education reform.\n\nBenazir Bhutto was born in Karachi in 1953. After completing her early education in Pakistan, she attended Radcliffe College and Oxford University. As well as obtaining a degree in Philosophy, Politics and Economics, she also completed a course in International Law and Diplomacy at Oxford.\n\nMs. Bhutto is the author of \"Foreign Policy in Perspective\" (1978) and her autobiography, \"Daughter of Destiny\" (1989). She received the Bruno Kreisky Award for Human Rights in 1988 and the Honorary Phi Beta Kappa Award from Radcliffe in 1989.\n\nBenazir Bhutto is a woman of courage and conviction and we are proud to acknowledge her with the International Leadership Award.\n\nOn the Web: www.wic.org/bio/bbhutto.htm"
