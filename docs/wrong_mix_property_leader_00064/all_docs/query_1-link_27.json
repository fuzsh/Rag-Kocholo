        "text": "Slain former Pakistani premier Benazir Bhutto will be posthumously awarded the United Nations Human Rights Award on December 10 on the occasion of the UN Human Rights Day.\n\nThe President of UN General Assembly, Miguel d'Escoto Brockmann, is in the process of informing Bhutto's widower, President Asif Ali Zardari, about the decision, media reports said.\n\nZardari was made co-chairman of Bhutto's Pakistan People's Party shortly after she was assassinated by a suicide bomber in December last year.\n\nInstituted in 1968, the UN Human Rights Award honours people and organisations which have made an outstanding contribution to the promotion and protection of the human rights embodied in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and in other UN human rights instruments.\n\nBhutto is being honoured by the world body for her efforts to promote democracy and fundamental freedoms in Pakistan. The award is given out once every five years. It was first handed out on the 20th anniversary of the adoption of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.\n\nUN Secretary General Ban Ki-Moon will present the award at a ceremony in the world body's headquarters.\n\nBegum Rana Liaquat Ali Khan, the wife of Pakistan's first premier Liaquat Ali Khan, was one of the recipients. Ironically, both Bhutto and Khan were assassinated at the Liaquat Bagh ground in the garrison city of Rawalpindi.\n\nSome other winners of the award are former South African President Nelson Mandela, former US President Jimmy Carter, Egyptian writer Taha Hussein, Prince Sadruddin Aga Khan, former UN Secretary General U Thant of Myanmar and US civil rights leader Martin Luther King.\n\nadvertisement"
