        "text": "On the eve of receiving the Nobel Peace Prize, Pakistani activist Malala Yousafzai is sharing what she hopes to accomplish in the years to come.\n\nIn an interview with the BBC, Yousafzai,the youngest ever recipient of the prize, said she is inspired by Benazir Bhutto, the former prime minister of Pakistan who was killed in 2007. \"If I can serve my country best through politics and through becoming a prime minister then I would definitely choose that,\" Yousafzai said.\n\nYousafzai is being awarded the prize along with Kailash Satyarthi, a children's rights activist from India. Both are adamant about all children receiving an education, and Yousafzai says receiving the honor is putting more responsibility on her â€” but that's a good thing. \"I want to serve my country and my dream is that my country becomes a developed country and I see every child get an education,\" she told the BBC. \"I feel I am answerable to God and to myself and that I should help my community. It's my duty.\""
