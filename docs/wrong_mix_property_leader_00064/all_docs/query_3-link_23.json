        "text": "Myanmar’s dissident political leader Aung San Suu Kyi has become the first recipient of the new Benazir Bhutto Shaheed Award for democracy instituted by the Pakistan People’s Party in the memory of the slain former premier.\n\nThe award was instituted by the ruling PPP to mark Bhutto’s birth anniversary, which was observed yesterday.\n\nIt pays tribute to Bhutto’s life—long struggle for democracy, human rights, improvement of the status of women and social causes.\n\nThe recipients of the award in four categories — democracy, human rights, philanthropy and women’s empowerment — were chosen by a committee chaired by PPP chief and President Asif Ali Zardari, an official statement said.\n\nThe statement said Suu Kyi was being honoured for challenging the dictatorship in Myanmar despite remaining in detention and house arrest for many years.\n\nPakistani rights activist I A Rehman received the award for human rights for his role at the forefront of the struggle for greater human rights and for his work as a peace activist.\n\nThe award for philanthropy went to Sheikha Fatima Bint Mubarak, the founding president of the UAE Women’s Association.\n\nThe statement said she was known for her “concerted campaign for the case of promoting welfare and well—being of women in the UAE“.\n\nThe recipient of the award for women’s empowerment is Sheikha Mowza Ali Hamad Al Mualla, who has been engaged in educational and other social reforms in Qatar over the years."
