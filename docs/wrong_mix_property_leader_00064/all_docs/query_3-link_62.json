        "text": "A major new investigation into the Bhutto family that examines their influence in Pakistan from the colonial era to the present day, The Bhutto Dynasty has been called “an important addition to the literature of a very important, and often very misunderstood, state” by prominent journalist Jason Burke. Drawing on original research and unpublished documents gathered over 20 years, Owen Bennett-Jones explores the turbulent existence of this extraordinary family, including their volatile relationship with British colonialists, the Pakistani armed forces, and the United States.\n\nWe invite you to join the conversation on November 3 at 11 AM EST via Zoom. Please register below. After registering, you will receive a confirmation email with information on how to join the call."
