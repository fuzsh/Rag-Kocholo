        "text": "Prepaid debit cards allow customers to spend conveniently and safely, without needing to worry about going over budget. You’ll only ever be able to spend the money you’ve loaded onto your card, so there are no overdraft fees or interest charges to worry about.\n\nThis guide will look at some of the best free prepaid debit cards out there, covering key points including:\n\nFree prepaid debit cards - the basics\n\nOur roundup of the best free prepaid debit cards\n\nHow to use your prepaid card, and some key considerations when choosing the right card for you\n\nFree prepaid debit cards\n\nLet’s start off with an admission. When it comes to prepaid cards - and in fact, any other financial service - ‘free’ is a relative term.\n\nNo credit or debit cards - prepaid or not - are ever really completely free. You’ll always find a selection of fees are applied for some services when using a card - but you’ll also find cards which waive charges if you meet certain criteria, which can make them good value depending on your regular usage.\n\nIn this guide we’ll look at some of the best available prepaid cards. In general this means there are no overdraft fees, you’ll be able to avoid monthly or annual card charges, and you’ll only face limited transaction costs for card use.\n\nBefore you decide which one is right for you, you’ll need to weigh up all the different possible charges and think about how you are likely to use the card.\n\nFor example, there are cards which don’t charge a monthly service fee - but if their transaction costs are high, they may actually work out more expensive than an alternative with a monthly service charge but low transaction costs. There are also some cards which waive charges if you top up a certain amount per month - if you know you’ll use the card regularly these may be a smart choice, but they could work out costly if you don’t intend to use the card often.\n\nIf you travel or often pay in a foreign currency, you may want to look into cards that don’t have a foreign transaction fee, for example.\n\nFree mastercard with balances\n\nBefore we dive into prepaid debit cards in more detail, we’ll take a look at an alternative worth mentioning - the Wise debit Mastercard.\n\nThis debit card comes with a multi-currency account and can be used like a prepaid card. You won’t pay any fees to open or operate an account, and can simply top up when you need to - just like using prepaid.\n\nWise's free multi-currency card can be up to 4x cheaper when spending abroad, compared to banks and PayPal\n\nUnlike most prepaid cards, the Wise balances can be used to hold over 40 different currencies, so you’ll be able to use your card for online shopping with foreign retailers, or as you travel, with no transaction fee to pay.\n\nYou can switch between currencies conveniently using the Wise app, and you’ll get the mid-market exchange rate every time. There’s just a transparent, low fee to pay.\n\nHere’s a quick rundown of the features of the Wise debit Mastercard.\n\nCard Features Wise Mastercard\n\nNo monthly or annual maintenance fee\n\nFree withdrawals up to $250 per month\n\nNo foreign transaction fees. This means no extra costs when buying online in foreign currencies, and paying abroad when you travel will be cheaper too\n\nLinked to the Wise borderless account, holds over 40 currencies\n\nAward-winning app to manage balances\n\nWorks with ApplePay, Google Pay and Samsung Pay\n\nAccepted around the world anywhere you see the Mastercard logo\n\nConvert your money between currencies easily using the mid-market exchange rate\n\nGet local account details to receive payments for free in major currencies including US, Australian and New Zealand dollars, euros and British pounds\n\nFree prepaid cards\n\nHere are a few of the best free prepaid debit cards out there for you to consider. It’s good to know that the fees, terms and charges may vary by state. Those set out here are the most common charging structures applied - check the details for your own location online.\n\nAs we mentioned in the intro, even a free prepaid card won’t be entirely free. Some charges are added for different services, so we have noted the key costs for you to consider, too. Make sure you read the small print before choosing the right prepaid card for your needs, so there are no nasty surprises.\n\nIt’s also worth noting that each card has different features and benefits which may suit some customers more than others. For example, some cards offer cash back or rewards for purchases. Others allow customers to have multiple cards linked to the same account - useful if you want to give a card to a family member or older child, for example. You’ll need to do a bit of research to find the right card for you - but there are so many options out there you’re sure to find one which suits your needs.\n\nHere’s our roundup of some of the best options available.\n\nCard Features American Express Serve¹\n\nFree to order your card online, and monthly fee is waived if you top up $500 per month\n\nNo credit check\n\nFree to top up from a bank account or by direct debit - there is a fee for cash top up of up to $3.95\n\nATM withdrawals are free from MoneyPass ATMs - fees apply to other ATM networks\n\nAmEx network cards aren’t as widely accepted as Visa or Mastercard\n\nOnline bill payment services\n\n2.7% fee for purchases in foreign currencies\n\nCard Features Movo Virtual Prepaid Visa Card ² ³\n\nCreate and use digital Visa cards after registration\n\nRegister for free online and get your card in 5 - 10 days ( you must contact customer support to receive a physical card )\n\nNo credit check required\n\nTop up from your bank account, tax refund, PayPal or using a direct deposit\n\nFree to use wherever you see the Visa logo, within the US\n\nUse with Apple Pay, Google Pay and Samsung Pay\n\n$2 ATM fee when using an ATM outside the Visa Plus Alliance Network, plus international charges if you spend using your card in a foreign currency, or make ATM withdrawals while abroad\n\nInactivity fee if you don’t use your card for 90 days - $4.95 per month\n\nCard Features Starbucks Rewards Visa Prepaid Card ⁴ ⁵\n\nVisa network card, issued by Chase\n\nCards are free to open, and replacements are free if you choose standard shipping options\n\nNo monthly, annual or reload fees\n\nNo overdraft or credit fees, and your money is FDIC protected\n\nCan not be used in an ATM for withdrawals\n\nCash reload is not possible - top up from a checking account or another debit card\n\nEarn rewards you can spend in Starbucks\n\n3% foreign transaction charge added to international purchases\n\nCard Features Bluebird by American Express ⁶\n\nFree to open an account, no monthly fee\n\nAvailable to customers with poor credit history\n\nOrder a card online for free - there’s a $5 for cards purchased at retail locations\n\nAdd money for free online using a direct debit or debit card\n\nAdd money using a cash payment for free at Walmart - there may be a fee to add cash at a different location\n\nFree ATM withdrawals at MoneyPass ATMs - a 2.50 fee elsewhere ( not including possible ATM operator fees )\n\nNo foreign exchange fee\n\nNo inactivity charge\n\nCard Features Walmart MoneyCard Cashback Prepaid Debit Card ⁷\n\nCard issued on the Visa network, and widely accepted\n\nNo credit check required to get a card\n\nEarn 1% - 3% cashback on purchases made with the card\n\nNo monthly fee if you top up at least $1,000 per month\n\nTop up in cash for free at a Walmart store - there may be a charge if you top up in cash elsewhere\n\nYou may be able to get your pay or benefits earlier by having them paid to this account using direct deposit\n\nCard Features Fifth Third Access 360 Prepaid Debit Card⁸\n\nFree to open an account\n\nMonthly fee is waived if you have an existing Fifth Third account, or top up more than $500 a month\n\nNo cost to add, withdraw or transfer funds\n\nDeposit cash at Fifth Third locations\n\nCard is on the Mastercard network, which is widely accepted at home and abroad\n\nFee free ATM withdrawals from Fifth Third ATMs around the country\n\nInternational fees and currency conversion charges for spending overseas and making ATM withdrawals while you travel\n\nWhat is a prepaid debit card and how does it work?\n\nSo what exactly is a prepaid card used for, and who might benefit from getting one? Here are some pointers if you’re still not sure about whether or not you need a prepaid card of your own.\n\nWho might use a prepaid card?\n\nPrepaid cards are popular with many different types of customers. Because it’s not possible to overdraw on the account, they’re useful for people on fixed incomes or who are managing their budget tightly.\n\nPrepaid cards are also frequently used by tourists, as they’re a good way to safely carry your foreign currency, and access it conveniently.\n\nPrepaid cards don’t require a credit check, so they’re also a good choice for those with bad credit, households without a regular bank account, or younger customers who might not have the credit history to get a regular credit or debit card. Some card accounts let customers apply for extra cards, too. This might be useful for example, if you want to give your teenager a card for their allowance or emergency use, but don’t want to give them free access to your regular bank account.\n\nWhat’s the advantage of prepaid over a regular bank card?\n\nPrepaid cards are more convenient - and often safer - than carrying cash. But they also come with a few other benefits compared to other types of credit or debit card.\n\nWith a prepaid card you can only access the money you load in advance, so you can’t accidentally overspend. That means you won’t dip into your overdraft and find yourself paying bank fees you didn’t expect. You don’t spend on credit, so there are no interest charges or late fees either. However, you’ll still get many of the benefits of using a regular card, such as ATM withdrawals and simple day to day spending.\n\nWhat’s the downside?\n\nWhen you’re choosing a prepaid card, it’s important to look at the fees associated, as they can be on the high side compared to regular debit cards. You’ll also want to check how you can reload your card, and whether there are any costs involved to top up.\n\nTake a look at the online options for managing your account, as not all cards have simple apps or access to the type of services you’ll see with mainstream mobile banking. You might also find some places which won’t accept prepaid cards, such as gas stations and hotels.\n\nIt’s also important to note that, although prepaid cards are great for people without good credit, they won’t help you to build a credit history or improve your credit score over time. They’re also not the ideal option for people who want to set aside money for savings - no interest is paid in most cases, so you could be better off with a regular savings account instead.\n\nHow do I use my prepaid card?\n\nIn many ways, using your prepaid card is very similar to using any other credit or debit card.\n\nYou’ll be able to buy a prepaid card online and have it sent to your home. You can also buy some cards through selected retailers, but there may be a fee for this service. Top up your card, and then use it to make cash withdrawals and online payments, and to pay for goods and services while you’re out and about.\n\nYou can often top up your account balance online, or by visiting a retail outlet to top up in cash. Once you’ve spent your balance your card will simply be declined if you try to use it, until you top it up again.\n\nSo there you have it - your complete guide to free prepaid debit cards. By doing some research into the card types available, and thinking in advance about how you might use your card, you’ll be able to find one which works for you. Don’t forget to look at the Wise debit Mastercard as a smart alternative which comes with many of the perks of prepaid - and a few more besides.\n\nSources:"
