Applications range from EnLighten, which tells drivers when the light they are stopped at will turn green, to vehicle powertrain optimization based on the state of upcoming lights. Safety is our number one priority. We alert drivers to possible dangers without distracting them. For example, EnLighten tells drivers stopped at red lights whether they have time to catch their breath for a few seconds, change the radio station, or pick up the papers that fell on the floor. EnLighten waits until the car stops, so the driver is not distracted, then announces how long the light will be red and gives a visual countdown. A few seconds before the light turns green, an alert sounds to tell the driver to focus on to the road. Another service we are developing warns drivers when they, or another connected vehicle, are about to run a red light. We partner with municipalities, handling the complexities of gathering real-time signal data and making it available in consistent formats for a variety of uses.

Confused if he was being overcharged or not, he starting calling providers and found that the same MRI would have cost him $450 if he paid cash. Realizing how hard it was to find trusted providers and cost information, the concept of Doctible was born. Doctible recruits the best providers in your neighborhood who publish their profiles, patient reviews, services and most importantly their rates. Doctible is the first cash-based healthcare network of its kind. Anyone can use the website to search for providers based on location, quality ratings, insurance plans accepted and prices they charge. We also enable you to easily book an appointment online. No phone calls and no waiting on hold! At Doctible, we work hard every day to help you find the right provider to take care of your healthcare needs.\n\nDocufide (merged with Parchment Inc. in 2012)\n\nDocufide's focus is our strength.

The treatment relies on behavioral and lifestyle changes usually spurred by a collection of digital impetuses. Because of the digital nature of the methodology, data can be collected and analyzed as both a progress report and a preventative measure. Treatments are being developed for the prevention and management of a wide variety of diseases and conditions, including type II diabetes, congestive heart failure, obesity, Alzheimer’s disease, dementia, asthma, substance abuse, ADHD, anxiety, depression, and several others. Digital therapeutics often employ strategies rooted in cognitive behavioral therapy. Remembering the past can bring a large amount of pleasure and understanding for anyone. People who suffer from Dementia and early onset Alzheimers often have difficulty remembering what has recently happened in their lives, so it is a way to easily talk about what they do remember. Often times the memories from years back remain detailed and intact.Reminiscence Therapy involves discussing and sharing memories, reviewing and evaluating those memories, and re-capturing the emotions and feelings that are an integral part of those memories. RT has been shown to be helpful in reducing reclusive tendencies that cause depression and anxiety.Pictures that bring back memories are another excellent aid to the reminiscence process.

Our Fast Collective Evolution Technology (FACET) combines biological and mathematical principles to answer billion-dollar questions that elude statistics, business intelligence, and traditional AI methods. No Black Boxes: Many AI methods take too long to train and are black boxes. These characteristics make them vulnerable to failures without advance warning, and cannot provide insight into the nature of the solutions. Emerald Logic is an algorithm factory that can produce tiny software programs in both human readable and executable forms. Finding Hidden Answers: Solutions to billion dollar problems are often hidden in complex, nonlinear relationships. Challenges in healthcare, finance, and defense have outrun business intelligence, statistics, and AI methods. Our FACET engine paradoxically ignores most of the haystack to find a needle, radically reducing solving time and costs. Math for the Real World: Engineers and finance quants often have to make simplifying assumptions to make intractable problems solvable, but real-world performance suffers. Instead, Emerald Logic samples the solution space with random bits of math, then guides and integrates them into optimal solutions. This simultaneously finds both the structure and parameters of formerly unknown solutions. Parallel Agent Search: Dandelion seeds spread by wind. Some take hold in fertile areas, then reproduce again. What starts randomly ends up efficiently finding the best areas to thrive. Our FACET engine produces many tiny software seeds that randomly sample a hyper-dimensional solution space. Some are closer to the ideal solution than others, and survive to evolve to optimality..\n\neTeam – Acquired by NC4 in 2006 (some return of capital)\n\nE Team Inc. provides sophisticated software and planning tools to enable emergency managers to effectively process the massive amounts of information generated during a major event, crisis or disaster.

However, Glassbeam founding team came from a rich background of working in leading storage networking companies such as NetApp and Brocade that were pioneers in uncovering the hidden potential in call home and phone home log data. The team had the fundamental belief that any high technology machine, system, or device, whether located in a data center or outside, such as storage, servers, MRI, CT Scan, CNC machines, industrial robots, etc will increasingly be connected to their manufacturer home base. These complex logs, if parsed and analyzed the right way, would have immense business and operational value for support, services, engineering, sales and marketing groups in these organizations.

Growing up Dr. O’Neil’s passion for health and fitness began at a young age by trying various protein powders, and vitamin solutions. In medical school and residency training he was always interested and intrigued by what could make the body better and healthier. Dr. O’Neil felt that preventing a cold and keeping one’s body healthy, is much more important than trying to treat a cold you already have. As Ben Franklin stated, “An ounce of prevention, is worth a pound of cure.” Working in the ER, Dr. O’Neil witnessed that most immune-supporting products required the administration of tablets, or liquid-mixed powders several times a day. They are inconvenient to use and many don’t contain proven ingredients. In a fast-paced world people need a product that is not only effective, but also easy to use – something they can keep handy in their pocket or purse, and pop into their mouth when they are exposed to a cold, or in a space where they think they may be exposed to a cold. Dr. O’Neil concluded that the solution is to put quality immune-supporting ingredients in a pleasant-tasting product already used by millions everyday: chewing gum. Gum is convenient and, as Dr. O’Neil points out, “gum offers superior absorption advantages, as many of the ingredients can be absorbed directly through the mouth. In contrast, tablets and drinks need to [...]\n\nImmunophotonics inc\n\nImmunophotonics (JLabs @ TMC) is a developing a drug that turns a common tumor ablation into an immunotherapy for cancer.\n\nImpact Hub\n\nImpact Hub is an accelerator/incubator in Santa Barbara.

We mapped the entire flu genome. Over three years, the founder Arthur Young tediously went through all 13,000 nucleotide positions and generated a comprehensive map of the genome through a functional screen. We used the map to identify the 28 regions of the virus that cannot mutate without it self-destructing. InvVax's key differentiator is that our vaccine targets only invariant positions. Our direct competitors are targeting conserved regions only. These are regions of the virus that are the same between most flu strains in nature. Targeting conserved regions addresses the first problem with seasonal vaccines, the mismatch of predicted and circulating strains. But it does nothing to address the second main problem, the mutation of the virus. Our functional screen revealed that the majority of conserved residues are actually not invariant. These invariant regions and the screening methodology used to identify them are patent-pending. InvVax has secured an exclusive option on this technology from UCLA. In addition, we are developing a much broader patent strategy with Wilson Sonsini.\n\nIP3 Networks, Inc. – Acquired by Second Rule LLC in 2006\n\nIP3's broadband subscriber management solution, NetAccess, aims to enable service providers to easily manage and control public access to the Internet by establishing a customized billing and authentication system.
