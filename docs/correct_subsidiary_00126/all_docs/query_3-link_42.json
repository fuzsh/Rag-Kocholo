        "text": "The Effective Mobile Marketing Awards (EMMAs)\n\n• Founded: 2010.\n\n• Organized by: Mobile Marketing Magazine.\n\n• Deadline for entries: September, each year.\n\n• Entry fee: free (though originally there was a fee).\n\n• Number of entries: 250.\n\n• Winners announced: November, each year at an awards dinner in London, UK.\n\n• Categories in 2013: Most Effective Mobile… Advertising Campaign; Tactical Messaging Campaign; Advertising Network; Affiliate Campaign; Augmented Reality Campaign; B2B Application; B2C Application; Charity Campaign/Solution; Couponing or Barcode Campaign; CRM/Messaging Campaign; Location-based Service/Campaign; mCommerce Solution; Mobile Site; Campaign from a Mobile Operator; Payment Solution; Publishing Solution; Social Campaign; Mobile Sales Promotion; Tablet Application; Ticketing Solution; Travel & Tourism Solution.\n\n• What the judges look for: Originality of idea (scored out of 10); quality of execution (out of 10); Effectiveness (out of 15)\n\n• mobiThinking verdict: The EMMAs is rapidly becoming one of mobiThinking’s favorite awards. The quality of the entries improves year-on-year. Entries still tend to be skewed towards the UK and Western Europe, but the global reach is growing. The distinguishing feature of these awards is the focus on effectiveness. That means these winners have been honored because they delivered ROI for the client, not just because the creative looked nice. The organizers go to some trouble to profile both the winners and finalists in the magazine and online… which is a lot more useful than the list of winners that some awards think is acceptable.\n\n• Judges include: David Murphy, Mobile Marketing magazine; Helen Keegan, technokitten.com; James Cameron, Camerjam; John Mew, IAB; Rob Thurner, Mobile Training Academy; Russell Buckley, UK Government Advisor; Nick Lane, mobilesquared; Steve Ricketts, ATAO; Andy Favell, mobiThinking.\n\nPrevious winners with videos and case studies: 2012 winners • 2011 winners • 2010 winners.\n\n• Guide to mobile awards • World Summit Mobile Awards • EMMAs • Smarties (MMA Awards) • Global Mobile Awards • Cannes Lions • Meffys • ME Awards •\n\n• Congratulations finalists – please send a link to your video case study to: editor (at) mobiThinking.com, if you wish it to be included here.\n\nMost Effective Mobile CRM/Enterprise Messaging Campaign\n\nWinner: Brandtone and PepsiCo – Credit for Torcida\n\nSummary: Street traders represent nearly 90 per cent of PepsiCo’s sales of Torcida snacks in Brazil, but how do you engage with an estimated 200,000 informal traders and street vendors in a meaningful way? For Pepsico, mobile was the answer. Working with Brandtone, PepsiCo offered Torcida vendors free airtime via mobile redemption of codes printed on product shipper packaging, in return for answering questions about their business needs and priorities. The campaign drove significant sales uplift and ongoing engagement with the street trader community.\n\nFinalists:\n\nBrandtone – Knorr Soup In Every Stew\n\nInfinite Convergence Solutions – Enterprise Messaging Service\n\nIris Mobile and Leo Burnett USA – George & Will Come to Life\n\nOpenMarket – Amdocs Mobile Engagement Platform Deployment\n\nWestfield/nFluence – My Westfield Personalised App\n\nVideo case study: Credit for Torcida.\n\nMost Effective Mobile Advertising Campaign\n\nWinner: OMD UK/Intel – Intel Inside Live: TV Star In 30 Seconds\n\nSummary: This campaign aimed to reverse negative perceptions of the Intel brand among young digital natives. It gave TV viewers the chance to star in Intel’s Christmas TV ad in the X Factor Final, with the ad created during the programme by bringing together mobile, social and TV. A 10-second ad near the start of the show invited the audience to star in the ad using the Shazam app and their mobile to submit festive picture messages to their friends, all to be live-edited remotely and showcased in a final ad at the end of the show, making it the fastest edited and approved TV commercial shown in the UK. 17,000 people engaged with the campaign, and brand sentiment improved significantly.\n\nHighly commended: OMD UK/Channel 4 – Tonight on 4 TV Guide\n\nFinalists:\n\nCheil Worldwide and Mobile 5 – Samsung Galaxy S4 Global Launch\n\nFetch – From eBay With Love\n\nInMobi – Nick Grimshaw Breakfast Show\n\nManning Gottlieb OMD – John Lewis Click and Collect\n\nManning Gottlieb OMD – Driving the Nissan N-Tec\n\nManning Gottlieb OMD – Specsavers Hyper-local Sales\n\nMillennial Media/Eagle Eye/Harvester – Mitchell & Butlers Harvester Passbook\n\nMindshare – Kleenex & Sneezeman: The Game\n\nOMD UK/Coty UK – Rimmel London Kate Mappe Lip Ad Sync\n\nSomo and Probability – Lady Lucks Second Screen\n\nUnilever VO5 – VO5 & Shazam\n\nWaitrose – Waitrose Passbook\n\nYuMe – JustWink\n\nVideo case study: Intel Inside Live: TV Star In 30 Seconds.\n\nMost Effective Tactical Messaging Campaign\n\nWinner: Iris Mobile and Leo Burnett USA – George & Will Come to Life\n\nSummary: The goal of the campaign was to attract theatre goers to a production of the musical, “Sunday in the Park with George” at Chicago’s Shakespeare Theatre, on a shoestring budget of less than $10,000.\n\nLeo Burnett USA went to the Art Institute of Chicago, the home of the painting that inspired the play, and created a fake painting with the main characters missing. While guests were completely confused… the “missing” characters came to life in front of their eyes. After the performance the audience was encouraged to opt in to a mobile messaging campaign. Those who did received a video trailer encouraging them to buy tickets to see the play. The campaign delivered the highest number of first-time guests in the theatre’s history, and extended the musical’s run by an extra seven nights, at a time when sales were slumping.\n\nFinalists:\n\nAmobee – Svarovski App Download and Footfall Campaign\n\nMEC – Colgate Kumbh Mela\n\nManning Gottlieb OMD – Virgin Wi-fi on the Underground\n\nMindshare UK – Comfort Range, Weve Proximity Messaging\n\nVirgin EMI & the7 Stars – Avicii ‘Wake Me Up’ Mobile-first Alarm\n\nVideo case study: George & Will Come to Life\n\nMost Effective Mobile Advertising Platform/Network\n\nWinner: Fiksu Mobile App Marketing Platform\n\nSummary: The company offers a high-performance mobile app marketing platform that delivers quality users at scale. It combines centralized media buying from what the company claims is the world’s largest mobile advertising inventory, with advanced optimization technology, to help app marketers deliver exceptional results. Fiksu says that its algorithm-based, real-time ad buying platform secures the lowest possible cost-per-install, and targets high-quality, loyal users for an app. Developers and brands using the platform include Coca-Cola, Zynga, Rovio and Disney.\n\nHighly commended: Qriously Opinion Targeting\n\nFinalists:\n\nAdColony HD Instant-Play\n\nAirpush\n\nAmobee\n\nInMobi\n\nLeadbolt Mobile User Acquisition and Monetization Platform\n\nSmaato Mobile RTB Ad Exchange\n\nTapjoy Mobile Advertising Platform\n\nTextlocal Messenger 2.0\n\nTrademob\n\nUpstream MINT\n\nVserv.mobi\n\nMost Effective Location-based Service/Campaign\n\nWinner: MEC – Colgate Kumbh Mela\n\nSummary: This campaign targeted Hindu pilgrims attending the huge Kumbh Mela festival. The aim was to drive footfall to the Colgate stand, where the new Ayurvedic toothpaste was being sampled, and sold at a discount. Subscribers who came within a certain proximity to the Colgate stand were sent a 30-second voice message (as opposed to text message, due to high levels of illiteracy), encouraging them to visit the Colgate stand. 175,000 subscribers were contacted over three days, increasing footfall to the Colgate stall by over 300 per cent.\n\nHighly commended: Finalists:\n\n9xb – Eddisons\n\nManning Gottlieb OMD – Specsavers Hyper-local Sales\n\nMX Data – Tube Map\n\nTelmap Navigator South Africa\n\nVirgin EMI & the7stars – Emeli Sande Valentine’s Day Proximity MMS\n\nVideo case study: Colgate Kumbh Mela.\n\nMost Effective Mobile Affiliate Campaign/Solution\n\nWinner: TradeDoubler Omni-Channel Affiliate Program for The Body Shop\n\nSummary: Mobile is at the heart of The Body Shop’s affiliate activity, driving significant sales growth. For 2012/13, The Body Shop provided Tradedoubler with four main objectives for its affiliate program: to grow sales by 40 per cent over the previous year; to expand the mobile and in-store strategy for affiliates; to mirror The Body Shop’s movement to an omnichannel brand; and to remain at the forefront of innovative solutions in the online space. Tradedoubler’s activity over-delivered against all targets, making it a worthy winner in this category.\n\nFinalists:\n\nAffiliate Window Network\n\nMac Presents – Rolling Stones App Sponsored by Citi\n\nTradedoubler’s Mobile Affiliate Solution\n\nWestfield/nFluence – My Westfield Personalised App\n\nMost Effective Mobile Augmented Reality Campaign/Solution\n\nWinner: Nimbletank Universal Music Grrrrrr Rolling Stones Album Launch\n\nSummary: Nimbletank set out to create the world’s first Augmented Reality album launch for the release of The Rolling Stones’ 50th anniversary album, ‘GRRR!’. The result was uView, an app that allows Universal Music to create integrated campaigns that merge worlds instantly. More than 3,000 locations, including the Eiffel Tower, Big Ben and the Statue of Liberty were ‘tagged’ to release the virtual gorillas featured on the album artwork. When a user pointed his uView-equipped app at one of the buildings, he or she saw one of the Gorillas scaling the building. Grrregory (the gorilla) was seen over 200,000 times on buildings across the world, and a 28 per cent clickthrough rate to buy the album directly from the app. A great campaign\n\nHighly commended: Audi and Somo Audi A3 iPad App\n\nFinalists:\n\nAudi and Somo – Audi Vision\n\nFetch – eBay Living Augmented Reality Campaign: Three Lives of Household Objects\n\nRe:Systems: BT London Live App\n\nVideo case study: UView augmented reality campaign\n\nMost Effective B2B Mobile Application\n\nWinner: Warburtons/Golden Gekko\n\nSummary: Golden Gekko developed this tablet app for the Retail Field Team at Warburtons, to help them manage inventory across more than 20,000 stores across the UK. The app mobilizes the process of capturing in-store product data, and equips the team with real-time storecard details, access to marketing and promotion collateral, and an interactive product catalogue. Today, the company estimates it is saving an estimated 5,000 working days on a yearly basis, thanks to time saved which was previously taken up inputting data. The app has proved hugely popular with the people who use it.\n\nFinalists:\n\nAuto Trader Dealer Portal\n\nEE/Publicis Blueprint – Orange Exchange Magazine App\n\nHoneywell/ The Purple Agency – Honeywell Installer Assistant\n\nIt Suits IT – Apps4FashionRippll AppSplash – Boxpark App\n\nMyrio Interactive Shopping Window\n\nPitcher CLM\n\nTassell Design – ProLogis UK iPhone/iPad App\n\nThomson Reuters Eikon\n\nMost Effective B2C Mobile Application\n\nWinner: Mothercare app\n\nSummary: The Mothercare iPhone app is designed as a smart companion for busy mums and mums-and-dads-to-be, designed to help them through one of the most important times of their life. In the app, users can shop the full mothercare.com range, view product videos, access their mothercare.com account, and create wishlists, checklists and To Do lists. The app also features a store finder, barcode scanner, advice-led videos from Mothercare TV, and a week-by-week pregnancy guide. It looks great, is easy to navigate, offers a heap of useful advice to a target audience that really needs it, and the entry came with a convincing stats as evidence of the app’s success and effectiveness.\n\nHighly commended: The Asda App\n\nFinalists:\n\nAccuWeather for Android\n\nBritish Gas App\n\nDurex – The Durexperiment App\n\nHotels.com\n\nMX Data – Tube Map\n\nSync Interactive – Pregnancy by Bounty\n\nTUI Travel/AKQA/Aditi Technologies/Creator – My Thomson App\n\nTurkiye Is Bankasi – IsCep\n\nWestfield/nFluence – My Westfield Personalised App\n\nWimbledon, The All England Lawn Tennis Club – Wimbledon 2013 Official App\n\nVideo promo: Mothercare app\n\nMost Effective Mobile Charity Campaign/Solution\n\nWinner: OpenMarket Open Fundraising’s Mobilise Platform\n\nSummary: Mobilise is an innovative and easy-to-use platform for regular giving mobile donations via Premium SMS. It’s built on OpenMarket’s robust gateways, and allows the rapid creation and deployment of SMS-based donation services. The platform enables donors to control their gifts and the charities they donate to, while also connecting charities with a younger audience. The Mobilise platform has processed over £1m of donations in the year to date, with a further £700,000 expected before the end of the year. There are currently 15 charities using the platform, including UNICEF, RSPCA, Shelter and Merlin.\n\nFinalists:\n\nFriends of the Earth and OpenFundraising – The Bees Need You\n\nOpenMarket – DEC Syria Crisis Appeal\n\nSociercise Virtual Charity Races\n\nThe Marketing Arm – The Skyhook Challenge\n\nVelti – Comic Relief 2013\n\nMost Effective Tablet Application\n\nWinner: Apptitude Media British Journal of Photography iPad App\n\nSummary: The British Journal of Photography iPad app takes the honours in this category for two reasons. Firstly, it’s a beautiful piece of work, with, as you might expect, stunning photography and great design. But the judges were impressed too by the story behind the development of the app, the way in which the magazine, which launched in 1854, has reinvented itself for the mobile age. And with such success that there are now 140 per cent more subscribers to the iPad version of the magazine, than there are to the print version.\n\nHighly commended: EE/Publicis Blueprint Orange Exchange Magazine App\n\nFinalists:\n\nAccenture Outlook iPad App\n\nAudi and Somo – Audi A3 iPad App\n\nAuto trader iPad App\n\nEE/Publicis Blueprint – Orange Exchange Magazine App\n\nHotels.com iPad App\n\nPocket App – Prostate Clinic\n\nRe:Systems – Skidmore, Owings & Merrill LLP Portfolio App\n\nWimbledon, The All England Lawn Tennis Club – Wimbledon 2013 Official iPad App\n\nVideo demo: British Journal of Photography iPad App\n\nMost Effective Mobile Couponing or Barcode Campaign\n\nWinner: Manning Gottlieb OMD – Specsavers Hyper-local Sales\n\nSummary: The judges liked this campaign for the clarity of thought and execution. The first step towards selling a pair of glasses is to convince a customer to take an eye test, so the campaign was designed to drive spontaneous footfall for free eye tests in Specsavers’ branches, using mobile coupons that users could redeem in their local store, with a unique SKU code. When users tapped on an ad, they were taken to the offer page, and encouraged to download their voucher to Passbook (non-Apple users could save the URL or take a screengrab of the voucher). Results are confidential, but the campaign was a huge success.\n\nHighly commended: i-movo Coors-Light Cold Caller\n\nFinalist: Millennial Media/Eagle Eye/Harvester – Mitchell & Butlers Harvester Passbook\n\nMost Effective Mobile Site\n\nWinner: Nimbletank Mobile Site\n\nSummary: Nimbletank took this award for its bold vision of what a mobile site could be and could look like. The best way to describe it is to encourage you to look at it on your own handset. The motive for the site was to showcase the company’s abilities – it has helped the company pick up an impressive roster of clients, including ASOS, Universal Music Group, BBC and Random House Publishing and the company saw a 500 percent increase in revenues within three months of release. This is the first time the EMMAs has given the Most Effective Mobile Site to a mobile firm for its own project, but despite the fact that it was up against some stiff competition, it’s totally justified. The phrase mobile-first might have been invented for it.\n\nHighly commended: Debenhams\n\nFinalists:\n\nAccuWeather\n\nHotels.com\n\nIsobar – Toyota GT86 ‘The Real Deal’\n\nMothercare\n\nMovement – ADT 2012\n\nThe Share Centre/SDL Mobile – The Share Centre\n\nVelti – Walkers Homegrown\n\nVideo case study: Nimbletank Mobile Site.\n\nMost Effective mCommerce Solution\n\nWinner: Demandware Mothercare\n\nSummary: Mothercare takes the honours in this category for its mobile site, which displays the full Mothercare range, with multiple product images, product reviews, easy sort and refine options, and synchronised basket and browse history between the full site and the mobile site. The site has delivered significant year-on-year increase across a number of metrics, including session length, revenue, average transaction value, and site speed.\n\nFinalists:\n\nAdd Innovation – Zando\n\n9xb – Hi-Tec\n\nMothercare\n\nPaythru & ParkREG – ParkREG\n\nPaythru, Shopamani and Mudo – Mudo Express Checkout\n\nThe Share Centre/SDL Mobile – The Share Centre\n\nTxtNtion – Junglepay.com\n\nMost Effective Campaign from a Mobile Operator\n\nWinner: EE/Publicis Blueprint Orange Exchange Magazine App\n\nSummary: Publicis-Blueprint produces this beautiful, bi-monthly tablet magazine for iPads and larger Android tablets on behalf of Orange. It’s aimed at the operator’s business customers, and is designed to keep them informed about EE and Orange products and services in a rich, interactive and engaging manner, something it succeeds handsomely in doing, with intuitive navigation and beautifully-presented content. The magazine is also used for reader surveys and polls to provide EE with customer insight. In a reader survey conducted earlier this year, 92 of respondents took positive action as a result of reading the magazine, with 55 per cent visiting the business website, 32 per cent contacting EE about products or services, and 13 per cent changing their business tariff.\n\nstrong>Highly commended: Velti – Vodafone Freebee Rewardz\n\nFinalists:\n\nAmobee – Telefonica Tu Me App Download Campaign\n\nEE/IMImobile – EE Personalised Mobile Site\n\nT-Mobile/IMImobile – Dancing Dads Campaign\n\nVideo demo: Orange Exchange Magazine App.\n\nMost Effective Mobile Payment Solution\n\nWinner: PKO Bank Polski IKO Mobile Banking App\n\nSummary: The IKO app combines mobile banking and payments. It enables users to make payments and ATM withdrawals, and to send person-to-person payments to a mobile phone number. It also shows the current account balance and transaction history. The app launched in March, and has seen transactions to the tune of tens of millions of Polish zloty (several million pounds).\n\nFinalists:\n\nBango’s Payment Platform for App Stores\n\nCorethree – Brighton and Hove Buses Mobile Ticketing\n\nKotak Mahindra Mobile Banking App\n\nOxygen8 Group – Charge2Mobile\n\nPostFinance – iTunes Credit Top-up\n\nTurkiye Is Bankai – Iscep Parakod\n\nMost Effective Mobile Publishing Solution\n\nWinner: Velti 5ml\n\nSummary: 5ml is a cloud-based, rich media authoring and publishing tool for multiple-channel HTML5-capable devices and media. It includes a free canvas editor tool, with over 40 built-in widgets, and allows brands and publishers to produce mobile versions of their content in the most effective format and factor for smartphones and tablets. There are currently 4,000 active 5ml mobile projects, serving millions of requests monthly across the globe.\n\nFinalists:\n\nDudaMobile\n\nIt Suits IT – Apps4Fashion\n\nPixelplant\n\nVideo promo:\n\nMost Effective Social Campaign\n\nWinner: Initiative UK – Tesco Forget Me Not\n\nSummary: The plan was to position Tesco, in the run up to Christmas 2012, as ‘Santa’s little helper’ – the retailer that was open late, and understood its customers’ needs at Christmas time.\n\nIt used Facebook ads and page posts to ask Tesco shoppers’ what were their most forgotten items at Christmas, and then targeted customers with ‘most forgotten’ messaging when they were close to a Tesco store. Reminders were even incorporated into shoppers’ smartphone calendars. The campaign generated almost 6,000 comments, more than 26,000 clickthroughs to a mobile landing page, and increased Tesco’s market share in the run up to Christmas by 1.8 per cent.\n\nHighly commended: Tapit – Halo Capture the Poster\n\nFinalists:\n\nMillennial Media & Maxus – Mercedes ‘You Drive the Story’\n\nMillennial Media & MEC – Activision Call of Duty, Black Ops II’ Photo Shoot Campaign\n\nVideo case study: Halo Capture the Poster\n\nMost Effective Mobile Sales Promotion/Direct Response Campaign\n\nWinner: Upstream Megabolada Brazil 2012\n\nSummary: Megabolada is an on-going mobile SMS marketing promotion operated by Upstream on behalf of four mobile network operators in Brazil: TIM, Claro, Oi, and Vivo. The campaign uses freemium mechanics to engage subscribers on a scale never before attempted via a trivia quiz with prizes, including a weekly R$20,000 (US $10,000) cash prize. Using its MINT platform, Upstream is able to help operators segment their customers and share the insights captured from the responses to the campaign. The results, while confidential, are little short of incredible, both in terms of participation, and revenues generated.\n\nHighly commended: Millennial Media/Eagle Eye/ Mitchell & Butlers Harvester Passbook\n\nFinalists:\n\nBrandtone – Credit for Torcida\n\nFriends of the Earth and OpenFundraising – The Bees Need You\n\ni-movo – Coors-Light Cold Caller\n\nManning Gottlieb OMD – Specsavers Hyper-local Sales\n\nWaitrose – Waitrose Passbook\n\nMost Effective Mobile Ticketing Solution\n\nWinner: Corethree Brighton and Hove Buses Mobile Ticketing\n\nSummary: The Brighton and Hove mobile ticketing service includes a powerful mPayment and mWallet solution which means users can pay for products and services via any major smartphone or tablet, via any network, and by any debit or credit card.

So the judges loved this app from TUI Travel, through which it engages with the customer from the moment they book their holiday to the moment it begins. It offers information on the resort, hotel, flights, weather and excursions, plus a ‘days to your holiday’ countdown timer, currency converter, and To Do and My Packing lists. The download and usage stats, which were for judges’ eyes only, were impressive too. For its ability to maintain a relationship with the company’s customers, the TUI Travel app is a worthy winner in this category.\n\nHighly commended: MX Data – Tube Map\n\nFinalists:\n\nAirAsia Expedia & Somo – AirAsia Expedia App Promotion\n\nHotels.com\n\nNetbiscuits – Hotels.info\n\nVideo promo:\n\nVideos from EMMAs finalists\n\nVideo case study: Novartis “Skyhook Challenge”\n\nVideo demo: Millennial Media & MEC – Call of Duty, Black Ops II\n\nVideo case study: Wimbledon 2013 Official App\n\nVideo case study: Ladylucks Dual Screen\n\nVideo case study: Hotel.info Netbiscuits\n\n• 2012 Winners include (brand/agency):: Papa John’s (Net Media Planet); McDonald’s (MobileBits); The Body Shop (TradeDoubler); Unilever (Rabarba); O2 (Cherry London); British Gas (IMImobile); McDonald’s (OMD); Screwfix Direct (Netbiscuits); Wienerberger (Sync Interactive); EasyJet (Mobile Travel Technologies); Compsoft; Nokia (YOC); Fiksu; Pizza Hut (Bemoko); Stylist (Blippar); Vodafone; Samsung (Kilimanjaro Live/Intellitix); Barclays.
