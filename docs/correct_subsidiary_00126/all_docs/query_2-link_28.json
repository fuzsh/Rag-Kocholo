        "text": "Marital property is property owned by both parties. This type of property is split during the property division phase of a divorce.\n\nMarital property does not have to be split evenly, rather it is split equitably. This means the court splits the assets based on what each party deserves. The split could be 50/50, but it could also be 60/40, 70/30, or some other ratio. They decide how to split property based on the property division factors outlined in the Illinois state statutes.\n\nHow to Determine Marital Property in Illinois\n\nAn asset or debt is marital property if it was gained after the marriage but before the divorce date.[1] For example, if a couple buys a house together and uses it during the marriage, then it is a marital asset.\n\nThese defined lines make it easy to understand which assets and debts are part of the marital estate. However, non-marital assets can become marital assets.\n\nCommingled Assets\n\nIf a non-marital asset becomes co-owned by both parties, it turns into a marital asset.[2] So, even if parties have separate finances, if a savings account was added to during the marriage, it is a marital asset.\n\nFurthermore, even if the title of the asset only has one party’s name on it, it can still become a marital asset. Using the above example of a savings account, even if it is only in one party's name, it's still a marital asset.\n\nAnother example is if a party has a retirement account they created before the marriage. If they continue adding to it throughout the marriage, it becomes a marital asset. If the retirement account was not added to during the marriage, then it is a non-marital asset.\n\nExamples of Marital Property\n\nSome examples of assets that are commonly part of the marital estate include:\n\nThe Marital Home\n\nOther Homes or Properties\n\nVehicles\n\nHousehold Items\n\nSavings Accounts\n\nRetirement Accounts\n\nInvestments\n\nPensions\n\nLife Insurance Policies\n\nThough these are commonly marital assets, sometimes they can be non-marital assets. For example, if a party gained an inheritance and invested that money separately from the other party, those investments are likely not a marital asset.\n\nIllinois Dissipation of Marital Assets\n\nIf a spouse wastes, destroys, or hides assets, that is a dissipation of assets. This is illegal under Illinois law. If you suspect your spouse of this, it is important to speak with an attorney as soon as possible.\n\nAn attorney knows the precautions and the necessary evidence to support a dissipation of assets claim. For this or any other divorce issue, contact Sterling Lawyers, LLC to meet with an attorney.\n\nIs Illinois a Community Property State?\n\nNo, Illinois is not a community property state. Illinois is an equitable division of property state. This means they don’t split assets 50/50 down the middle. Instead, the court divides property based on each party's contribution and situation.\n\nIs Everything I Earned During My Marriage Considered Marital Property in Illinois?\n\nYes, everything earned during marriage is marital property. There is room for nuance in this though. For example, if a non-marital asset increases in value, that increase is not a marital asset.[3]"
