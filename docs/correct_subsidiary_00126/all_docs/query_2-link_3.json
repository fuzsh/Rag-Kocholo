The tribe's elders and their devotion to passing along traditions to younger generations create a solid base for this group of 7,752 citizens.\n\nWe hope to provide you with the necessary forms and resources you need on this website. Wa'iniginapsanawi.\n\nAho! Welcome Visitors to the Ho-Chunk Nation.\n\nThe Indigenous people, with an ancestral lineage dating back to pre-history, were first recorded as the Wisconsin Winnebago Tribe. This name was given to them by early European explorers. In 1994, when the tribe adopted its present constitution, the nation reclaimed their original name: Ho-Chunk or \"People of the Big Voice.\"\n\nThe Ho-Chunk Nation is one of Wisconsin’s leading employers. In various counties it serves across the State, the Ho-Chunk Nation’s guiding work principles and attention to detail have providing many employees a great chance to move up quickly into leadership positions. Our workforce is diversified, knowledgeable and respected. One of biggest areas we appreciate our employees is having one of the best benefits packages ever assembled. Thank you for your consideration and we look forward to working with you."
