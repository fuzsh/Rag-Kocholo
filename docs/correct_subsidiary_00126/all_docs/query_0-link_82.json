        "text": "PayPoint plc\n\nResults for the half year ended 30 September 2020\n\nFinancial HIGHLIGHTS\n\nProfit before tax from continuing operations of £16.8 million (2019: £20.7 million) decreased by £3.9 million, reflecting the decrease in net revenue from continuing operations and the expected impact of the British Gas contract ended in December 2019. Underlying profit before tax1 from continuing operations of £17.8 million (2019: £18.6 million) has been resilient with a 4% decrease.\n\nProfit before tax from the discontinued operation of £3.8 million (2019: £3.3 million) increased by £0.5 million (12.8%), mainly due to improved margins.\n\nNet revenue from continuing operations of £46.4 million (2019: £50.3 million) decreased by £3.9 million (7.8%); the prior period included £2.1 million net revenue from the British Gas contract now ended. Net of the expected British Gas impact, net revenue decreased by £1.8m.\n\nTotal costs2 from continuing operations of £29.6 million (2019: £29.7 million) decreased by £0.1 million (0.3%). Total costs include £1.0 million of non-recurring costs, associated with one-offs for acquisitions and disposals. Other savings were mainly due to cost efficiencies from bringing terminal maintenance and repairs in-house and lower costs from decreased transaction volumes.\n\nNet corporate debt of £6.1 million (2019: £12.3 million) reflects cash balances of £14.9 million less borrowings of £21.0 million from the revolving credit facility.\n\nOrdinary interim dividend of 15.6 pence per share declared. The dividend will be paid in equal instalments of 7.8 pence per share on 29 December 2020 and 8 March 2021.

The sale is subject to competition and regulatory approvals, as well as other conditions precedent, and therefore completion is anticipated to take place on 31 March 2021. The Romanian business has been classified as a discontinued operation and the comparative Consolidated Statement of Profit or Loss and relevant notes have been restated to show the discontinued operation separately from continuing operations. The Romanian business has also been classified as held for sale in the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position.\n\nNick Wiles, Chief Executive of PayPoint plc, said:\n\n“Our first half has been a particularly busy and challenging period for the business, against which we have delivered a solid performance, with a proactive network and product recovery post-lockdown supported by our resilient, sustainable business model.\n\nIn addition, we have made a number of important steps to underpin our growth strategy in the UK, with the acquisitions of Handepay Ltd/Merchant Rentals Limited (card payments) and i-movo Limited (digital vouchering), significantly expanding our capability to seize the significant opportunities in our core market. The sale of our Romanian business to Innova Capital enables us to realise value and focus on the UK business.\n\nThese steps, together with our internal investment plans, reinforce the focus on our UK markets and our confidence in the accelerated growth opportunities we see for the business.\n\nOur declaration of a dividend of 15.6p per share, consistent with our dividend policy, also reflects our long-term confidence in the business, the strength of our underlying cash flow and the enhanced growth prospects from the steps we have taken in the current period.”\n\nOPERATIONAL HIGHLIGHTS\n\nStep change in execution of growth strategy in UK\n\nDisposal of Romanian business at significant profit, underpinning UK-focused strategy\n\nAcquisition (subject to regulatory approval) of Handepay Ltd/Merchant Rentals Limited (card payments) and i-movo Limited (digital vouchering) to deliver enhanced growth and opportunities in UK, driving a broadening of payment capabilities and greater leverage of retailer network\n\nWithin both client and retail services, incremental growth opportunities identified, leading to focused investment and resource allocation to accelerate delivery\n\nRe-organisation delivering a more streamlined and accountable structure across the business\n\nSolid performance with resilient recovery post-lockdown and good progress against strategic priorities\n\n1.

Building a delivery focused organisation and culture\n\nStrengthened Executive team with key appointments, completing organisation structure announced earlier in year\n\nBen Ford joined PayPoint on 1 July 2020 to lead our new Retail Services function. His focus is on aligning all our retailer-facing resource and capability, the end-to-end delivery of products and services to our retailers and the management of retailer relationships, leveraging our new CRM system\n\nNext phase of CRM now fully rolled out to Contact Centre, enabling ‘single customer view’ of retailer and enhanced retailer experience\n\nFirst phase CRM benefits yielding better data to improve key business decisions\n\nIn-house warehouse operations extended to products and consumables, giving complete control of experience and key moments of retailer lifecycle\n\nCovid-19 impacts\n\nOverall trading continued to be resilient in the first half following the impact of the Covid-19 outbreak, with a proactive network and product recovery post-lockdown, supported by our resilient, sustainable operating model, as evidenced by the tables at the end of this section.\n\nAt the beginning of the national lockdown earlier this year, PayPoint swiftly moved to an operating model which combined remote working and continued activity in the field to support our retailer partner network, along with some essential office based activity. We are actively minimising the disruption to services and the support we provide clients and retailer partners whilst we continue taking the appropriate steps to safeguard our people. In the first half of this year, we have not furloughed any of our people and have not accessed any available government assistance. Instead, we have continued to review third party spend, continued to seek efficiencies in cost and invested our capex carefully.\n\nTransaction volumes and sites have recovered well from the initial impacts seen in April through the first national lockdown. An expected reduction in bill payment transactions year on year was further compounded by Covid-19, with consumers increasing their average top-up amounts and energy companies providing pre-payment consumers with credit advances. However, by the end of the first half, volumes had started to recover and in September 2020 were 19% behind the same period last year. Digital payments continue to grow strongly, with eMoney volumes recovering well. Card payments have benefited from the broader consumer shifts from cash to card and to more local shopping, delivering a strong performance with transactions increasing by 68.7% for the same six-month period last year. ATM volumes continue to recover, although this recovery remains dependent on a broader recovery in the economy. Parcel transactions continue to recover and are showing year on year increases from June onwards.\n\nThe resilient performance of the business through this period was further underpinned by a series of proactive initiatives to support clients, retailers and consumers. This included launching a partnership with Deliveroo to give our retailer partners the capability to deliver goods to their local communities, the PayPoint Retailer Heroes awards recognising retailers who had gone above and beyond to support consumers through the pandemic and a £25,000 contribution to the NFRN Covid-19 Hardship Fund, helping retailers adversely affected by Covid-19.\n\nService April 20/21 vs 19/20\n\n% increase/ (decrease)May 20/21 vs 19/20\n\n% increase/ (decrease)June 20/21 vs 19/20\n\n% increase/ (decrease) July 20/21 vs 19/20\n\n% increase/ (decrease)August 20/21 vs 19/20\n\n% increase/ (decrease)September 20/21 vs 19/20\n\n% increase/ (decrease)UK bill payment transactions10(28%)(26%)(20%)(18%)(19%)(19%)UK mobile top up transactions(22%)(20%)(18%)(19)%(20)%(17%)UK eMoney transactions(5%)11%32%27%14%15%Card payment transactions72%89%79%61%58%54%ATM transactions(37%)(30%)(24%)(20%)(19%)(18%)Parcels transactions(36%)(9%)4%9%4%10%\n\nSites temporarily suspended due to Covid-19As at 31 March 2020 As at 30 April 2020 As at 31 May 2020 As at 30 June 2020As at 31 July 2020As at 31 August 2020As at 30 September 2020UK PayPoint One32836818579413929UK ATMs283330303212574326UK Card payments29323012447181615UK Parcels20827418287494718\n\nEnquiriesFinsburyPayPoint plcRollo HeadNick Wiles, Chief ExecutiveNidaa LoneAlan Dale, Finance Director (Mobile: 07778043962)(Telephone: 0207 251 3801)(Email: [email protected])\n\nA presentation for analysts is being held at 9.30am today (26 November 2020) via webcast. This announcement, along with details for the webcast, is available on the PayPoint plc website: corporate.paypoint.com\n\nCHIEF EXECUTIVE’S REVIEW\n\nThe business has delivered a solid performance in the first half, against the backdrop of Covid-19, with a proactive network and product recovery post-lockdown, supported by our resilient, sustainable operating model. In addition, we have taken important steps to strengthen our operating model and organisational structure and to identify and support growth opportunities in our core UK business.\n\nOur priority through this crisis remains to keep our people safe and well, while providing the necessary support to our clients and retailer partner network, as we continue to serve some of the most vulnerable in our communities. The business quickly moved to a hybrid operating model which combines remote working, continued activity in the support of our retailer partner network, including our Contact Centre which has remained fully operational throughout, and some essential office-based activity. We have sought to minimise the disruption to service and support we can provide to clients and our retailer partner network, as evidenced by the swift recovery of transaction volumes and retailer sites in the half year period.\n\nAs we indicated in our first quarter results, we have continued to see recovery in our business from the April lows and overall trading has remained resilient. Bill payment volumes have not recovered as we would have hoped, reflecting a combination of continued higher than average top up amounts, the consumer benefit of the reduced energy price cap and mild weather conditions. ATM volumes remain subdued after some recovery over the summer months, while volumes in Cards, Top-ups, digital payments (MultiPay), eMoney and in a number of the new payment initiatives have all continued to perform strongly. In addition, we have seen some recovery in parcel volumes, although this has been more subdued in recent weeks as a result of the recent additional government restrictions.\n\nThe Board continues to support our core strategic priorities for the business: embedding PayPoint at the heart of convenience retail; becoming the definitive parcel point solution; sustaining leadership in ‘pay-as-you-go’ and growing digital bill payments. We have also fully embedded a new organisational structure to underpin these core strategic priorities and create meaningful new opportunities for growth. As set out later in this report, we have made good progress in the first half on strengthening and investing our business to deliver a stronger platform for long-term growth. Following the Board changes announced in May 2020, I am also delighted to welcome Rosie Shapland to the Board as an Independent Non-Executive Director who will assume chairmanship of the Audit Committee effective from 1 December 2020, and to confirm the appointment of Alan Dale as Finance Director, effective from 20 November 2020.\n\nWe have now accelerated the execution of our strategy for growth in the UK, with the acquisitions of Handepay Ltd/Merchant Rentals Limited (card payments) and i-movo Limited (digital vouchering) significantly expanding our capability to seize the significant growth opportunities in our core market. As the UK’s leading secure digital vouchering system, i-movo will enhance our EPOS and terminal services proposition and create new opportunities with Newspaper, Government, FMCG, Utilities and banking clients. Our acquisition of Handepay/Merchant Rentals enhances significantly our existing cards business, creating access to new SME sectors including food services, garages and hospitality and the opportunity to accelerate the growth of the combined business in a growing cards market through clear operational initiatives, cross selling opportunities and synergies. The sale of our Romanian business to Innova Capital will enable us to realise value and focus on the UK business.\n\nOn 30 Sept 2020, we announced that we had received a Statement of Objections from Ofgem relating to certain contractual terms with certain energy suppliers and retailers for the provision of over-the-counter (OTC) payment services. We are considering Ofgem’s provisional views set out in the Statement of Objections and will exercise our right to respond to Ofgem in due course. It is therefore too early at this stage to predict an outcome and any potential outflow of funds.\n\nWith new national restrictions in force across the UK, we are applying our learnings from earlier in the year to ensure the continued resilience and preparedness of our business for this developing situation. We have clear plans underway to contain costs, we are working flexibly in support of our clients and retailer partner network and we continue to explore new opportunities.\n\nFinally, I am deeply grateful to our incredible people who have been working so hard over the past six months, the senior team who have shown great leadership in response to the challenges we are facing, and, most importantly, our retailer partners and clients who continue to work with us to deliver vital services and support consumers across the UK.\n\nNick Wiles\n\nChief Executive\n\n25 November 2020\n\nMARKET OVERVIEW\n\nChanging market dynamics are creating significant opportunities for PayPoint, with the business uniquely placed to take advantage of the continued shift from cash to digital payments and the increase in shopping local.\n\nKey trends and changes since the end of the 19/20 financial year in the UK markets in which PayPoint operates include:\n\nConvenience retail\n\nThe UK convenience sector has been one of the main beneficiaries of the increase in shopping local through Covid-19, with consumers choosing to stay closer to home, avoid busier stores and support businesses in their local community\n\nTotal UK convenience sector is expected to grow by £3.8bn in 2020, an expected 9.2% growth on 201911\n\nTotal UK convenience store numbers remained resilient, with marginal growth to 47,000 and numbers of independently-owned stores gaining 3% in the year12\n\nCard payments\n\nGrowth in this sector has again been driven by the shift from cash to card payments accelerated by Covid-19\n\nForecast growth in UK debit card market by 2027 to 19.7bn payments, with 36% contactless13\n\nIn H1, PayPoint has seen card payment volume increase by 68.7% YOY\n\nUK convenience store card payments transactions overall increased by 27.2%14 and average basket sizes increasing 16.9% in 202012\n\nOutside of this sector, card payments overall have recovered well since the lows experienced earlier in the year, with latest data from August 2020 showing 1.6 billion debit card transactions, an increase of 2.5% YOY, and total spend of £58.4 billion, an increase of 12.5% YOY15\n\nCash Out\n\nThere have been clear challenges in this sector due to Covid-19, with a shift away from cash usage by consumers\n\nLINK’s ATM transactions declined by 44.8%16 to c700 million transactions and the number of ATMs in the UK reduced by 3.9% (2,241 sites) to 55,56517 in the 5 months to August 2020\n\nSome sites with multiple ATMs have closed one or more ATMs to aid social distancing\n\nAccess to cash remains a key priority in the UK. The FCA (Financial Conduct Authority) and PSR (Payment Services Regulator) are taking a joint approach to maintaining services for the many people who continue to rely on cash as a vital way of making payments, despite the changes brought by Covid-19\n\nParcels\n\nOverall online sales increased during the lockdown earlier in the year, particularly in electronics, leisure equipment and grocery, as consumers were restricted at home\n\nHowever, the fashion sector saw a decrease by 4.4% year on year18, for the period from January to August 2020, due to lack of socialising. This was also evidenced through a subsequent drop in demand in parcel volumes seen in our network due to the fashion focus of our carrier partners\n\nAs consumers were generally at home, we also saw a reduction in the requirement for out of home pick up points\n\nSince April, pick-up and drop-off (PUDO) volumes have recovered well through our Collect+ network, ahead of the overall PUDO market performance\n\nThe PUDO market comprises Click and Collect, returns and send propositions. The Click and Collect market is 11% of all volumes, c.150 million parcels per year and is expected to double by 202519. Returns and send volumes are estimated at c.185 million and c.380 million parcels per year respectively20\n\nBill payments and top-ups\n\nThe price cap for pre-pay customers reduced to £1,164 for the six months to September 2020. This is 6%21 lower than the cap set in September 2019. This will further reduce by 8.1% in the six months to March 2021\n\nNon-Big Six energy providers combined market share remained static at c28%22.\n\nThe rollout of smart meters has slowed further with the impact of Covid-19 impacting installations with only 1.1m meters installed in 202023. The deadline for completion of the rollout has now been extended to 30 June 2025\n\nThe number of PAYG mobile subscribers declined by 3% in 2019 to 24.9 million subscribers24\n\nPROGRESS AGAINST OUR STRATEGIC PRIORITIES\n\nPayPoint is uniquely placed to take advantage of the continued shift from cash to digital payments and the increase in shopping local, with both of these trends accelerated further over the past six months by Covid-19.\n\nOur core strategic priorities for the business remain unchanged:\n\n1. Embed PayPoint at the heart of convenience retail\n\n2. PayPoint becomes the definitive parcel point solution\n\n3. Sustain leadership in ‘pay-as-you-go’ and grow digital bill payments\n\n4. Building a delivery focused organisation and culture\n\nDuring the period, we have made a number of important steps to underpin this strategy through the acquisition of i-movo Limited and Handepay Ltd/Merchant Rentals Limited (subject to regulatory approval) and the disposal of our Romanian business.\n\nAs the UK’s leading secure digital vouchering system, i-movo will enhance our EPOS and terminal services proposition and create new opportunities with Newspaper, Government, FMCG, Utilities and banking clients. Our acquisition of Handepay/Merchant Rentals enhances significantly our existing cards business, creating access to new SME sectors including food services, garages and hospitality and the opportunity to accelerate the growth of the combined business in a growing cards market through clear operational initiatives, cross selling opportunities and synergies. We believe the sale of our Romanian business is well timed, delivering a strong profit on its disposal and ahead of the next stage of development and investment in this business. These steps, together with our internal investment plans, underpin the focus on our UK markets and our confidence in the accelerated growth opportunities we see for the business.\n\nProgress against the core strategic priorities is set out below:\n\nPRIORITY 1: EMBED PAYPOINT AT THE HEART OF CONVENIENCE RETAIL\n\nPayPoint continues to provide technology, payment services, increased footfall and basket spend to our retailer partners. Our UK network of more than 27,500 stores is bigger than all banks, supermarkets and Post Offices together, putting us at the heart of communities nationwide and comprising the best multiple, symbol and independent retailers in the UK. Our superior network means 99.5% of the urban population live within one mile of a PayPoint retailer partner and 98.3% of the rural population live within five miles.\n\nOur network is enabled with cutting-edge technology designed to create a platform for growth and provide retailer partners with everything a modern convenience store needs. Core to this priority is PayPoint One, which includes EPoS and bill payment functionality, and other products such as card payments and ATMs.\n\nH1 Progress\n\nPayPoint One:\n\nPayPoint One was live in 16,900 sites at 30 September 2020, an increase of 802 since 31 March 2020\n\nThe number of sites suspended due to Covid-19 has reduced by 91% since 31 March 2020 to 29 at 30 September 2020\n\nAverage weekly service fee revenue per site increased to £15.7 (2019: £15.5). To support our retailers during the Covid-19 period, the annual inflation increase was waived this year\n\nEPoS Pro was live in 1,336 sites, growth of 498 (59%) since 31 March 2020\n\nWe launched a new promotion in July 2020 to enable PayPoint One retailers to try our EPoS solution at no extra cost for 3 months. After the trial period, we are anticipating two thirds of retailer partners will remain on the platform and benefit from the full capability of our EPoS solution\n\nEPoS technical re-platforming is now complete and we have fully launched a new retailer self-service portal, improving the quality of our retailer experience and reducing their need to call our Contact Centre\n\nEstablished trials of digital advertising screens and digital vouchering to drive conversion and footfall for retailer partners, new engagement channels for FMCG brands to their consumers and, subsequently, open up new revenue streams for PayPoint One\n\nCard payment:\n\nCard payment services were live in 9,885 sites at 30 September 2020, an increase of 450 sites since 31 March 2020 mainly due to installs and Covid-19 suspended sites returning\n\nTransactions grew significantly by 68.7% to 112.3 million and net revenue increased by 63.4% to £6.9 million, benefiting from the increase in convenience store sales and the preference of stores to take payment by card\n\nThe average transaction value for the period increased to £12.5 from £11.8 in the prior period.

Operationally, we have remained focused on managing our business by supporting our people, our clients and retailer partner network and the most vulnerable in the community. In addition, we have taken important steps to strengthen our operating model and organisational structure and to identify and support growth opportunities in our core UK business.\n\nOur core strategic priorities for the business remain unchanged: embedding PayPoint at the heart of convenience retail; becoming the definitive parcels solution and sustaining leadership in ‘pay as you go’ and growing digital bill payments. During the year, we have made a number of important steps to underpin this strategy through the acquisition of i-movo Limited and Handepay Ltd/Merchant Rentals Limited (subject to regulatory approval) and the disposal of our Romanian business. As the UK’s leading secure digital vouchering system, i-movo will enhance our EPOS and terminal services proposition and create new opportunities with Newspaper, Government, FMCG, Utilities and banking clients. Our acquisition of Handepay/Merchant Rentals enhances significantly our existing cards business, creating access to new SME sectors including food services, garages and hospitality and the opportunity to accelerate the growth of the combined business in a growing cards market through clear operational initiatives, cross selling opportunities and synergies. We believe the sale of our Romanian business is well timed, delivering a strong profit on its disposal and ahead of the next stage of development and investment in this business. These steps, together with our internal investment plans, underpin the focus on our UK markets and our confidence in the accelerated growth opportunities we see for the business.\n\nWe expect the continuing government restrictions to create some uncertainty in the outlook to a number of our businesses in the second half, although we have taken the necessary steps and learnings from the first lockdown to ensure their continued resilience through this developing situation. The influence of parcel volumes during the important peak seasonal period and resilience in bill payment volumes will also be important factors, along with the continuation of the positive trends we have seen in card volumes, e-Money and MultiPay. Underpinning our outlook for the second half are the actions we have taken during the year to manage our costs, apply a tight operational focus and maximise new business opportunities. We have declared a dividend of 15.6p per share, consistent with our dividend policy, which reflects our long-term confidence in the business, the strength of our underlying cash flow and the enhanced growth prospects from the steps we have taken in the current year. Overall expectations for the full year remain unchanged.\n\nFinancial review\n\nOVERVIEW\n\nRestated28Restated1\n\n£mSix months to\n\n30 September\n\n2020Six months to\n\n30 September\n\n2019Change\n\n%Year ended\n\n31 March\n\n2020Net revenueContinuing operations UK retail services 21.7 19.98.6% 41.0UK bill payments and top-ups 24.7 30.4(18.6%) 65.8 46.4 50.3(7.8%) 106.8Discontinued operationRomania 7.6 7.34.5% 14.6Total net revenue 54.0 57.6(6.2%) 121.4Costs from continuing operations 29.6 29.7(0.3%) 56.8Profit before tax from continuing operations 16.8 20.7(18.6%) 50.0Cash generation 29.5 27.18.9% 66.4Cash generation from continuing operations 25.1 22.412.1% 57.9Net corporate debt(6.1)(12.3)(50.3%)(12.0)\n\nProfit before tax from continuing operations of £16.8 million (2019: £20.7 million) decreased by £3.9 million due to the decrease in net revenue from continuing operations and the expected impact of the British Gas contract ended in December 2019.\n\nRevenue from continuing operations decreased by £8.4 million to £60.7 million (2019: £69.1 million). Net revenue from continuing operations decreased by £3.9 million (7.8%) to £46.4 million (2019: £50.3 million); the prior period included £2.1 million net revenue from the British Gas contract now ended.\n\nUK retail services net revenue increased by £1.8 million (8.6%) to £21.7 million mainly from increased card payments net revenue. Card payments net revenue increased by £2.7 million (63.4%) due to a significant increase in transactions (68.7%). Service fee net revenue increased by £0.8 million (12.7%) driven by the roll out of PayPoint One to additional sites. ATM net revenue decreased by £1.0 million (17.8%) due to a reduction in transactions with reduced demand for cash over the period and the closure of sites due to Covid-19. Parcel net revenue decreased by £0.3 million (20.1%) mainly due to a decrease in transactions.\n\nUK bill payments and top-ups net revenue of £24.7 million decreased by £5.7 million (18.6%). UK bill payments revenue was restated to include the intercompany revenue recharge for transactional services with the discontinued operation. UK bill payments net revenue decreased by £5.7 million (25.6%), or £3.6 million (17.9%) excluding the £2.1 million prior period net revenue from British Gas, mainly due to the impacts of Covid-19 where consumers are making larger payments, less frequently and energy companies provided credit to prepayment customers.\n\nMultiPay net revenue increased by £0.3 million (17.7%) driven by growth from new revenue streams and an increase in transactions from other clients excluding Utilita. As expected MultiPay transactions decreased due to Utilita moving customers to their own in-house app. UK top-ups and eMoney net revenue remained stable at £8.1 million (2019: £8.1 million), transactions decreased by 13.8%. eMoney transactions increased by 15.4% which increased net revenue by £0.6 million (19.9%).\n\nRomania’s net revenue increased by 4.5% to £7.6 million (2019: £7.3 million) through margin improvement in bill payments and top-ups. Transactions increased by 1.2% to 57.4 million (2019: 56.7 million).\n\nTotal costs from continuing and discontinued operations of £33.4 million (2019: £33.6 million) decreased by £0.2 million. Total costs include £1.0 million associated with the one-off acquisition and disposal costs. Costs from continuing operations decreased by £0.1 million mainly due to cost efficiencies from bringing terminal maintenance and repairs in-house and lower costs from decreased transaction volumes. Costs from discontinued operations decreased by £0.1 million due to cost reduction measures for Covid-19 including travel savings and lower bonuses.\n\nCash generation remained strong with £29.5 million (2019: £27.1 million) delivered from profit before tax from continuing and discontinued operations of £20.6 million. There was a working capital inflow of £3.4 million, of which £3.3 million will reverse next year once the HMRC VAT deferral is paid. There was also the add back for depreciation and amortisation of £4.9 million.\n\nNet corporate debt decreased by £6.2 million to £6.1 million (2019: £12.3 million). Dividend payments were lower compared to the same period last year due to the end of the additional dividend programme. At 30 September 2020, £21.0 million (2019: £18.0 million) was drawn down from the revolving credit facility, repayments of £49.0 million were made for the revolving credit facility in the period since 31 March 2020.\n\nSECTOR ANALYSIS\n\nUK retail services\n\nUK retail services are services PayPoint provides to retailers which form part of PayPoint’s networks. Services include providing the PayPoint One platform (which has a basic till application), EPoS, ATMs, card payments, parcels and SIMs.\n\nSix months to\n\n30 September\n\n2020Six months to\n\n30 September\n\n2019 Change\n\n%Year ended\n\n31 March\n\n2020Number of retailers 17,279 17,472(1.1%) 16,663PayPoint terminal sites (No.)PayPoint One29 16,900 15,08812.0% 16,098Legacy terminal 2,360 4,732(50.1%) 2,496PPoS30 8,293 8,546(3.0%) 8,235Total sites 27,553 28,366(2.9%) 26,829Services in sites (No.)PayPoint One Base 8,153 7,5797.6% 8,304EPoS Core 7,411 6,68510.9% 6,956EPoS Pro 1,336 82462.1% 838Card payments 9,885 9,8790.1% 9,435ATMs 3,782 3,972(4.8%) 3,620Parcels 10,486 7,11347.4% 8,646Transactions (Millions)Card payments 112.3 66.668.7% 136.8ATMs 15.6 20.7(24.8%) 40.4Parcels 11.2 11.5(2.5%) 24.5PayPoint One average weekly service fee per site (£) 15.7 15.51.2% 15.4Net revenue (£m)Service fees 7.1 6.312.7% 13.1Card payments 6.9 4.263.4% 8.7ATM 5.0 6.0(17.8%) 11.9Parcels and other 2.7 3.4(20.3%) 7.3Total net revenue (£m) 21.7 19.98.6% 41.0\n\nAs at 30 September 2020, PayPoint had a live terminal in 27,553 UK sites, an increase of 724 sites from 31 March 2020, primarily as a result of sites temporarily suspended sites due to Covid-19 returning to the network. PayPoint One sites increased by 802 since 31 March 2020 due to installs and a reduction in sites suspended due to Covid-19.\n\nUK retail services: net revenue increased by £1.8 million (8.6%) to £21.7 million. The net revenue of each of our key products is separately addressed below.\n\nService fees: This is a core growth area and consists of service fees from PayPoint One and our legacy terminal. Service fee net revenue increased by £0.8 million (12.7%) to £7.1 million (2019: £6.3 million) driven by the additional 1,812 PayPoint One sites compared to 30 September 2019. The PayPoint One average weekly service fee per site increased by 1.2% to £15.7 (2019: £15.5), benefiting from the increase in Core and Pro sites which are charged at a higher rate. EPoS Pro and Core sites increased by 498 and 455 respectively since 31 March 2020, mainly due to new sales, the EPoS try before you buy trial and Covid-19 suspended sites returning. Legacy terminals now just remain in our multiple retailer partners, the replacement in our independent retailer partners having been completed at the end of the last financial year.\n\nCard payments: Card payment transaction volumes increased significantly by 68.7% to 112.3 million (2019: 66.6 million). Across our network, 9,885 retailer partners were using the card payment solution, an increase of 450 sites since 31 March 2020 mainly due to new sales and Covid-19 suspended sites returning. Net revenue increased by 63.4% to £6.9 million (2019: £4.2 million), benefitting from the increase in convenience store sales and the preference of stores to take payment by card. PayPoint’s revenue rebate is broadly based on a percentage of the transaction value processed.\n\nATMs: As expected ATM net revenue decreased by £1.0 million (17.8%) to £5.0 million (2019: £6.0 million) due to a 24.8% reduction in transactions, attributable to a combination of suspended sites from Covid-19 and reduced demand for cash across the economy over this period. ATM sites increased by 162 since 31 March 2020 due to a reduction in the Covid-19 suspended sites and the re-opening of a large leisure partner. PayPoint continued to optimise its ATM network by relocating existing machines to better performing locations.\n\nParcels & other: Total parcel volumes decreased by 2.5% to 11.2 million (2019: 11.5 million), impacted by Covid-19 with consumers staying at home. Parcel sites increased by 1,840 from 31 March 2020 to 10,486 sites (31 March 2020: 8,646 sites), due to increasing sites for the newer parcel partners and Covid-19 suspended sites returning. Parcels and other net revenue decreased by 20.3% to £2.7 million (2019: £3.4 million), due to parcel net revenue which was impacted by Covid-19 and a market decline in SIM sales. Other services provided include SIM sales and other ad hoc items.\n\nUK bill payments\n\nBill payments is our most established category and consists of prepaid energy, bill payments (including MultiPay) and Cash Out services.\n\nRestated31Restated1Six months to\n\n30 September\n\n2020Six months to\n\n30 September\n\n2019Change\n\n%Year ended\n\n31 March\n\n2020Total transactions (millions) 90.6 141.7(36.0%) 296.9Of which: MultiPay transactions (millions) 12.2 13.9(11.8%) 32.9Transaction value (£m) 2,207.7 2,896.6(23.8%) 6,106.3Net revenue (£m) 16.6 22.3(25.6%) 49.6Net revenue per transaction (pence) 18.3 15.716.4% 16.7\n\nUK bill payments revenue was restated to include the intercompany revenue recharge for transactional services with the discontinued operation. UK bill payments net revenue decreased by 25.6% (£5.7 million) to £16.6 million (2019: £22.3 million). Excluding the £2.1 million prior period net revenue from British Gas, net revenue decreased by £3.6 million (17.9%). Net revenue per transaction continued to increase and was up by 2.6 pence (16.4%) due to a 16.9% increase in the average transaction value for prepay energy and the ongoing improvement in mix to smaller, but higher yielding clients. Transaction volumes decreased by 51.1 million (36.0%), excluding British Gas transaction volumes decreased by 22.0%. The decrease in bill payment transactions was primarily as a result of the continued switch to digital payment methods along with the impacts of Covid-19 where consumers are making larger payments, less frequently and energy companies provided credit to prepayment customers.\n\nMultiPay net revenue continued to grow and increased by 17.7% to £2.1 million (2019: £1.8 million) driven by growth from new revenue streams and an increase in transactions from other clients excluding Utilita. As expected, MultiPay transactions decreased by 1.7 million (11.8%) to 12.2 million (2019: 13.9 million) due to the planned Utilita switch to their in-house app.\n\nUK top-ups & eMoney\n\nTop-ups include transactions where consumers can top up their mobiles, prepaid debit cards and lottery tickets. This sector also includes eMoney transactions where PayPoint provides the physical network for consumers to convert cash into electronic funds with online organisations.\n\nSix months to\n\n30 September\n\n2020Six months to\n\n30 September\n\n2019Change\n\n%Year ended\n\n31 March\n\n2020Transactions (millions) 17.6 20.4(13.8%) 39.5 Of which: eMoney transactions (millions) 5.0 4.415.4% 9.1Transaction value (£m) 358.2 308.116.3% 684.1Net revenue (£m) 8.1 8.10.7% 16.2Net revenue per transaction (pence) 46.3 39.617.0% 41.0\n\nAs expected, UK top-up and eMoney transactions decreased by 2.8 million (13.8%) to 17.6 million (2019: 20.4 million) due to further declines in the prepaid mobile sector and Covid-19 impacts. There was a resilient performance in UK top-up and eMoney net revenue which has stayed stable at £8.1 million (2019: £8.1 million), with the decline in UK top-ups offset by the growth in eMoney.\n\neMoney transactions increased by 0.6 million (15.4%) to 5.0 million (2019: 4.4 million) and net revenue increased by 19.9%. eMoney transactions derive a substantially higher fee per transaction than traditional top-up transactions.\n\nRomania (Discontinued operation)\n\nThe Romanian business mainly comprises bill payments and top-ups operating on a similar basis to our UK business. Cash payment remains a mass market proposition in the country and is expected to be the dominant payment method for the medium term.\n\nSix months to\n\n30 September\n\n2020Six months to\n\n30 September\n\n2019Change\n\n%Year ended\n\n31 March\n\n2020PayPoint terminal sites (No.) 19,048 19,088(0.2%) 19,257Transaction value (£m) 1,228 1,1467.2% 2,296Transactions (millions)Bill payments 49.5 49.6(0.3%) 100.0Top-ups 6.1 6.10.2% 12.4Other 1.8 1.085.1% 2.2Total transactions 57.4 56.71.2% 114.6Net revenue (£m) 7.6 7.34.5% 14.6Net revenue per transaction (pence) 13.2 12.83.1% 12.8\n\nThe number of sites decreased by 209 from 31 March 2020 to 19,048 as a result of an exercise to close non-performing sites. Bill payment transactions decreased by 0.3% to 49.5 million (2019: 49.6 million) and top-up transactions remained stable at 6.1 million (2019: 6.1 million). The growth in other transactions was driven by card payment transactions with an increase of 10 sites to 1,451 sites (2019: 1,441 sites). Net revenue increased by 4.5% from margin improvement in bill payments and top-ups.\n\nTOTAL COSTS\n\nRestated32Restated1\n\n£mSix months to\n\n30 September\n\n2020Six months to\n\n30 September\n\n2019Change\n\n%Year ended\n\n31 March\n\n2020Continuing operationsOther costs of revenue 3.2 3.8(16.0%) 7.3Depreciation and amortisation 4.6 4.014.6% 8.7Administrative costs 21.1 21.7(2.6%) 40.3Finance costs 0.7 0.2262.8% 0.5 29.6 29.7(0.3%) 56.8Discontinued operation Romania 3.8 3.9(2.6%) 7.9Total costs 33.4 33.6(0.6%) 64.7\n\nTotal costs decreased by £0.2 million (0.6%) to £33.4 million (2019: £33.6 million). Total costs include £1.0 million associated with the one-off acquisition and disposal costs. Costs from continuing operations decreased by £0.1 million (0.3%) to £29.6 million. Costs have been tightly managed in the period with further cost efficiencies driven by bringing terminal maintenance and repairs in-house and lower costs associated with transaction volumes. As anticipated, there were increases in depreciation and amortisation relating to the investment in our back-office systems, together with the amortisation in relation to the intangible asset recognised on acquisition of the remaining Collect+ asset. Financing costs have increased as a result of the £70.0 million revolving credit facility being fully drawn down for six months, £49.0 million was repaid in the period.\n\nOPERATING MARGIN33\n\nOperating margin from continuing operations of 37.7% (2019: 41.4%) declined by 3.7ppts due to a 7.8% decrease in net revenue from continuing operations.\n\nPROFIT BEFORE TAX AND TAXATION\n\nThe tax charge for continuing operations of £3.7 million (2019: £4.0 million) on profit before tax from continuing operations of £16.8 million (2019: £20.7 million) represents an effective tax rate34 for continuing operations of 21.8% (2019: 19.2%). The effective tax rate was 2.6ppts higher than the prior period due to an increase in disallowable expenses associated with the one-off acquisition and disposal costs.\n\nSTATEMENT OF FINANCIAL POSITION\n\nNet assets of £45.0 million (2019: £41.4 million) increased by £3.6 million. Current assets decreased by £12.5 million to £163.3 million (2019: £175.8 million) mainly due to a decrease in trade and other receivables, there is a corresponding decrease in trade and other payables. Non-current assets decreased by £11.5 million to £45.0 million (2019: 56.5 million), due to goodwill in relation to the discontinued operation being classified as held for sale.\n\nCASH FLOW AND LIQUIDITY\n\nThe following table summarises the cash flow movements during the period.\n\n£mSix months to\n\n30 September\n\n2020Six months to\n\n30 September\n\n2019Change\n\n%Year ended\n\n31 March\n\n2020Profit before tax from continuing and discontinued operations20.624.0(14.2%)56.8Depreciation and amortisation4.94.314.0%9.5VAT and other non-cash items--100.0%0.4Share based payments and other items0.6-100.0%(0.4)Working capital changes (corporate)3.4(1.2)(383.3%)0.1Cash generation29.527.18.9%66.4Taxation payments(4.2)(10.2)(58.8%)(15.8)Capital expenditure and business acquisitions(9.8)(4.1)139.0%(8.4)Loans and borrowings(49.0)18.0(372.2%)70.0Acquisition of subsidiary - cash acquired0.9-100.0%-Lease payments(0.1)-100.0%(0.3)Dividends paid(10.7)(28.7)(62.7%)(57.4)Net (decrease)/increase in corporate cash and cash equivalents(43.4)2.1(2,166.7%)54.5Net change in clients’ funds and retailer partners’ deposits7.70.8862.5%1.4Net (decrease)/ increase in cash and cash equivalents(35.7)2.9(1,331.0%)55.9Cash and cash equivalents at the beginning of year93.837.5150.1%37.5Effect of foreign exchange rate changes0.40.1300.0%0.4Cash and cash equivalents at period end58.540.544.4%93.8Comprising:Corporate cash14.95.7161.4%58.0Clients’ funds and retailer partners’ deposits27.234.8(21.8%)35.7Assets held for sale - Clients' funds and retailer partners' deposits16.4-100.0%-\n\nCash generation remained strong with £29.5 million delivered from profit before tax from continuing and discontinued operations of £20.6 million.

Capital expenditure and business acquisitions primarily consists of IT hardware, PayPoint One terminals, EPoS, CRM development and T4 terminals, together with the acquisition of the remaining 50% asset that Yodel owned for £6 million. Excluding the acquisition of the remaining 50% asset that Yodel owned, capital expenditure was £0.3 million lower compared to the same period last year. This is as a result of reduced CRM development as the core platform is now live, although this was partially offset by the purchase of T4 terminals in Romania.\n\nAt 30 September 2020 net corporate debt was £6.1 million (2019: 12.3 million), £21.0 million of the £70.0 million revolving credit facility was utilised (2019: £18.0 million). Repayments of £49.0 million were made for the revolving credit facility in the period since 31 March 2020.\n\nDIVIDENDS\n\nSix months to\n\n30 September\n\n2020Six months to\n\n30 September\n\n2019\n\nChange\n\n%Ordinary dividends per share (pence)Interim (Proposed)15.6 23.6(33.9%)Final (paid) 15.6 23.6(33.9%)Additional dividend per share (pence)Interim (Proposed) - 18.4(100.0%)Final (paid) - 18.4(100.0%)Total dividend per share (pence) 31.2 84.0(62.9%)Total dividends paid in period (£m) 10.7 28.7(62.7%)\n\nIn the six months to 30 September 2020, total dividend payments of £10.7 million (15.6 pence per share) were made, representing the final ordinary dividend for the year ended 31 March 2020.

Accounting policies\n\nReporting entity\n\nPayPoint plc (‘the Company’) is a Company domiciled in the United Kingdom. These consolidated interim financial statements (‘interim financial statements’) as at and for the six months ended 30 September 2020 comprise the Company and its subsidiaries (together referred to as the ‘Group’). The Group is primarily involved in providing innovative and time-saving technology to retailers and is a service provider for consumer transactions (see note 2).\n\nBasis of preparation\n\nThese interim financial statements have been prepared in accordance with IAS 34 Interim Financial Reporting, and should be read in conjunction with the Group’s last annual financial statements as at and for the year ended 31 March 2020 (‘last annual financial statements’). They do not include all the information required for a complete set of IFRS financial statements. However, selected explanatory notes are included to explain events and transactions that are significant to an understanding of the changes in the Group’s financial position and performance since the last annual financial statements. The interim financial statements contained in this report are unaudited, but have been formally reviewed by the auditor and their report to the Company is set out on page 36.\n\nThe information shown for the year ended 31 March 2020, which is prepared under International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS), does not constitute statutory accounts within the meaning of section 434 of the Companies Act 2006. The report of the auditor on the statutory accounts for the year ended 31 March 2020, prepared under IFRS, was unqualified, did not draw attention to any matters by way of emphasis and did not contain a statement under sections 498 (2) or (3) of the Companies Act 2006 and has been filed with the Registrar of Companies.\n\nBy order of the Board, these interim statements were authorised for issue on 26 November 2020.\n\nThe condensed consolidated interim financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis. At 30 September 2020, the Group had cash and cash equivalents of £42.0 million, including £27.2 million of clients’ funds and retailer partners’ deposits. In addition, the Group has in place a five-year unsecured £75 million revolving loan facility with a £20 million accordion expiring in March 2023. The lender has confirmed the accordion of £20 million. At 30 September 2020, £21 million was drawn down from the revolving credit facility. Our cash and borrowing capacity provides sufficient funds to meet the foreseeable needs of the Group. This includes the acquisition of i-movo for an initial cash consideration of £2 million and Handepay and Merchant Rentals for a cash consideration of £70 million, which are expected to be paid on the anticipated completion dates of late November 2020 and the last quarter of the current financial year respectively. This excludes the proceeds from the sale of the Romanian business which is anticipated for April 2021. The acquisitions will be funded by the credit facility and agreed £20 million additional commitment via the accordion. The Group has a resilient Statement of Financial Position, with net assets of £45.0 million as at 30 September 2020, having made a profit for the period of £16.4 million and delivered net cash flows from operating activities of £32.8 million for the period.\n\nAs referred to on page 2, the business continuity plans actioned by the Group to date have resulted in operations\n\ncontinuing unaffected on a remote working basis and an analysis of post period end transaction volumes is included on page 2.\n\nThe Directors have prepared cash flow forecast scenarios over a three-year period, taking into account the Group’s current financial and trading position, the principal risks and uncertainties and the strategic plans that are reviewed at least annually by the Board. The cashflow forecasts included an analysis and stress test to ensure working capital movements do not trigger a covenant breach. Based on this assessment, the Directors confirm that they have a reasonable expectation that the Group will be able to continue in operation and meet its liabilities as they fall due over the period of not less than 12 months from the date of this announcement and therefore have prepared the financial statements on a going concern basis.\n\nThe accounting policies are consistent with those included in the annual report 2020, apart from non-current assets held for sale and discontinued operations which is detailed below.\n\nNon-current assets held for sale and discontinued operations\n\nA non-current asset or a group of assets containing a non-current asset (a disposal group) is classified as held for sale if its carrying amount will be recovered principally through sale rather than through continuing use, it is available for immediate sale and sale is highly probable within one year.\n\nOn initial classification as held for sale, non-current assets and disposal groups are measured at the lower of previous carrying amount and fair value less costs to sell with any adjustments taken to profit or loss. The same applies to gains and losses on subsequent remeasurement although gains are not recognised in excess of any cumulative impairment loss. Any impairment loss on a disposal group first is allocated to goodwill, and then to remaining assets and liabilities on pro rata basis, except that no loss is allocated to inventories, financial assets, deferred tax assets, employee benefit assets and investment property, which continue to be measured in accordance with the Company’s accounting policies. Intangible assets and property, plant and equipment once classified as held for sale or distribution are not amortised or depreciated.\n\nA discontinued operation is a component of the Group’s business that represents a separate major line of business or geographical area of operations that has been disposed of or is held for sale, or is a subsidiary acquired exclusively with a view to resale. Classification as a discontinued operation occurs upon disposal or when the operation meets the criteria to be classified as held for sale, if earlier. When an operation is classified as a discontinued operation, the comparative income statement is restated as if the operation has been discontinued from the start of the comparative period.\n\nUse of judgements and estimates\n\nIn the application of the Group’s accounting policies, the Directors are required to make judgements, estimates and assumptions about the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. The estimates and associated assumptions are based on historical experience and other factors that are considered to be relevant. Actual results may differ from these estimates.\n\nEstimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Revisions to accounting estimates are recognised in the period in which the estimate is revised if the revision affects only that period, or in the period of the revision and future periods if the revision affects both current and future periods.\n\nCritical judgement: recognition of cash and cash equivalents\n\nThe nature of bill payments services means that PayPoint collects and holds funds on behalf of clients as those funds pass through the settlement process and also retains retailer partners’ deposits as security for those collections.\n\nA critical judgement in this area is whether clients’ funds and retailer partners’ deposits are recognised in the statement of financial position. This includes evaluating:\n\n(a) existence of a binding agreement clearly identifying the beneficiary of the funds\n\n(b) the identification, ability to allocate and separability of funds\n\n(c) identification of the holder of those funds at any point in time\n\n(d) whether PayPoint bears the credit risk\n\nThe judgement is where there is a binding agreement specifying that PayPoint holds funds on behalf of the client (i.e. acting in the capacity of a trustee), PayPoint bears the credit risk and those funds have been separately identified as belonging to that beneficiary, the cash and the related liability is not included in the statement of financial position. In all other situations the cash and corresponding liability are recognised on the statement of financial position.\n\nCritical estimate: useful economic lives of intangible assets\n\nA critical estimate for the amount of amortisation that is recognised in the profit or loss account and the carrying value of the asset in the statement of financial position. The useful life used to amortise intangible assets relates to the expected future performance of the assets and management’s judgement of the period over which economic benefit will be derived from the asset. For development costs, the Group has determined the useful life based on historical experience with similar products and platforms controlled by the Group as well as anticipation of future events which may impact their life such as changes in technology.\n\nThe Group has recognised a brand intangible asset at fair value in accordance with IAS38 Intangible Assets, which is being amortised over its estimated useful economic life of twelve years.\n\nCritical estimate: capitalised development expenditure\n\nA critical estimate at the statement of financial position date that has a risk of causing an adjustment to the carrying amount of assets and liabilities through estimation uncertainty is the evaluation of capitalised development expenditure shown in intangible assets. An estimate is required of how additions to intangible assets will generate probable future economic benefits whilst judgement is required in determining the technical feasibility of completing the intangible asset.\n\nAlternative performance measures\n\nNon-IFRS measures or alternative performance measures are used by the Directors and management for performance analysis, planning, reporting and incentive setting purposes which have remained consistent with prior periods. These measures are included in these interim financial statements to provide additional useful information on performance and trends to shareholders.\n\nThese measures are not defined terms under IFRS and therefore they may not be comparable with similarly titled measures reported by other companies. They are not intended to be a substitute for, or superior to, IFRS measures. The measures are described below.\n\nNet revenue (non-IFRS measure)\n\nNet revenue is revenue less commissions paid to retailer partners and the cost of mobile top-ups and SIM cards where PayPoint is principal. This reflects the benefit attributable to PayPoint’s performance eliminating pass-through costs which creates comparability where PayPoint is agent or principal and is an important measure of the overall success of our strategy.\n\nThe reconciliation of revenue to net revenue is as follows:\n\nRestated36Restated16 months\n\nended\n\n30 September\n\n2020\n\n£0006 months\n\nended\n\n30 September\n\n2019\n\n£000Year\n\nended\n\n31 March\n\n2020\n\n£000Continuing operations Service revenue 58,876 67,585 141,280Sale of goods 744 891 1,793Royalties1,091 574 1,216Revenue60,71169,050144,289less:Retail partners’ commissions(14,122)(18,533)(37,243)Cost of mobile top-ups and SIM cards as principal(173)(160)(286)46,41650,357106,760Discontinued operation Net revenue from Romania7,5927,26214,633Total net revenue 54,00857,619121,393\n\nEffective tax rate (non-IFRS measure)\n\nEffective tax rate is the ongoing tax cost as a percentage of the net profit before tax.\n\nCash generation (non-IFRS measure)\n\nCash generation reflects earnings before tax, depreciation, amortisation and exceptional items adjusted for working capital (excluding movement in clients’ funds and retailers’ deposits) as detailed in note 16. This measures the cash generated which can be used for tax payments, new investments and financing activities.\n\nTotal costs (non-IFRS measure)\n\nTotal costs comprise other cost of revenue (note 4), administrative expenses, financing income and financing costs.\n\nOperating margin (non-IFRS measure)\n\nOperating margin is calculated by dividing operating profit by net revenue. This measure reflects the efficiency of converting revenue into profits.\n\nNet corporate (debt)/cash (non-IFRS measure)\n\nNet corporate (debt)/cash represents cash and cash equivalents excluding cash recognised as clients’ funds and retailers’ deposits, less amounts borrowed under financing facilities (excluding IFRS 16 liabilities).\n\nThe reconciliation of cash and cash equivalents to net corporate debt is as follows:\n\n30 September\n\n2020\n\n£000\n\n30 September\n\n2019\n\n£000\n\n31 March\n\n2020\n\n£000Cash and cash equivalents42,02840,52193,774less:Clients’ funds and retailer partners’ deposits (27,160)(34,848)(35,739)Loans and borrowings(21,000)(18,000)(70,000)Net corporate debt(6,132)(12,327)(11,965)\n\n2. Segmental reporting\n\nThe Group provides a number of different services and products, however these do not meet the definition of different segments under IFRS 8, as the chief operating decision maker does not review those separately for resource allocations purposes, therefore the Group has only one operating segment. A sector analysis has been provided in the finance review on pages 12 to 14.\n\nRestated37Restated16 months\n\nended\n\n30 September\n\n2020\n\n£0006 months\n\nended\n\n30 September\n\n2019\n\n£000Year\n\nended\n\n31 March\n\n2020\n\n£000Revenue by countryContinuing operationsUK60,71169,050144,289Discontinued operationRomania34,47235,04269,712Total95,183104,092214,001\n\n30 September\n\n2020\n\n£00030 September\n\n2019\n\n£00031 March\n\n2020\n\n£000Non-current assets Continuing operationsUK45,04642,21140,493Discontinued operationRomania14,61414,27314,039Total59,66056,48454,532\n\n3.

The energy bill payment and parcel sectors are the most seasonal sectors with the energy sector generating more transactions during the winter months and parcels generating higher volumes in the lead up to Christmas. As a result, higher revenue and operating profits are usually expected in the second half of the year rather than in the first six months. This does not constitute “highly seasonal” as considered by IAS 34 Interim Financial Reporting.\n\nContract balances\n\n30 September\n\n2020\n\n£000\n\n30 September\n\n2019\n\n£000\n\n31 March\n\n2020\n\n£000Trade receivables 7,831 13,701 12,346Accrued income 3,935 4,147 2,518Contract assets - deferred setup and development fees2,3243,3972,862Contract liabilities(1,644)(2,378)(1,965)Deferred income(348)(612)(328)Total contract balances 12,098 18,255 15,433\n\n4.

The tax rate is increased by disallowable expenses in the UK, but reduced by profits in Romania being taxed at a lower rate than the UK.\n\n6.

The total dividend of 15.6 pence per share will be paid in equal instalments of 7.8 pence per share on 29 December 2020 (to shareholders on the register on 4 December 2020) and 8 March 2021 (to shareholders on the register on 5 February 2021). Total dividends of £10.7 million (15.6 pence per share) were paid during the period and comprised of the final ordinary dividend for the year ended 31 March 2020.\n\n8. Acquisition of Collect+ Group\n\nOn 6 April 2020, PayPoint plc acquired the remaining 50% of the asset that Yodel owned, resulting in Collect+ becoming a fully owned brand within the PayPoint Group. From 6 April 2020, Collect+ Holdings Limited and Collect+ Brand Limited (Collect+ Group) were fully owned and controlled subsidiaries.\n\nThe agreement reaffirmed the long-term partnership with Yodel, committing to a multi-year contract to continue as a parcel carrier for Collect+. PayPoint also acquired the ownership of the Collect+ website domain which has been developed and a new Collect+ website has been launched.\n\nTotal consideration payable was £6.0 million cash paid on completion. An intangible brand asset of £6.0 million has been recognised initially at cost and will be amortised over the useful life of 12 years.\n\nIn the period since acquisition, the Collect+ Group earned gross revenues of £1.1 million and reported profit after tax of £0.9 million.\n\nThe following table summarises the recognised amounts of assets acquired and liabilities of the Collect+ Group assumed at the date of acquisition.\n\nFair value of assets and liabilities acquired on 6 April 2020£000Trade and other receivables 8 Cash and cash equivalents 923 Trade and other payables(906)Total identifiable net assets acquired 25\n\n9. Disposal Group held for sale and discontinued operation\n\nOn 21 October 2020, PayPoint announced that it had signed an agreement to sell its Romanian business, PayPoint Services SRL and Payzone SA to Innova Capital. The sale is subject to competition and regulatory approvals, as well as other conditions precedent, and therefore completion is anticipated to take place on 31 March 2021. The cash consideration is expected to be circa £47 million on a debt-free, cash-free basis, subject to a net working capital adjustment on completion.\n\nThe sale was consistent with PayPoint’s focus on its key strategic priorities and the delivery of enhanced growth and value in its core UK markets, which is where the net proceeds will be invested.\n\nThe major classes of assets and liabilities comprising the operation classified as held for sale are as follows:\n\n30 September 2020Assets held for sale£000Goodwill12,042Other intangible assets314Property, plant and equipment2,247Deferred tax asset11Inventories203Trade and other receivables19,198Clients' funds and retailers' deposits16,51450,529Liabilities directly associated with assets classified as held for sale: Trade and other payables41,227Current tax liabilities28741,514Net assets held for sale9,015\n\nThe assets held for sale are those of the Romanian business, including the related goodwill.\n\nThe net assets have been assessed to ensure their fair value less costs to sell is greater than the carrying value. The proceeds of the disposal are expected to substantially exceed the carrying amount of the related net assets and accordingly no impairment losses have been recognised on the classification of the operation as held for sale.\n\nThe Romanian business was not previously classified as held-for-sale or as a discontinued operation. The comparative Consolidated Statement of Profit or Loss has been restated to show the discontinued operation separately from continuing operations.\n\nUK revenue was restated to include the intercompany revenue recharge for transactional services with the discontinued operation. Subsequent to the disposal, the Group will continue to recharge the discontinued operation for transactional services. Although intra-group transactions have been fully eliminated in the consolidated financial results, PayPoint has elected to attribute the elimination of transactions between the continuing and discontinued operation before the disposal in a way that best reflects the continuance of these transactions subsequent to the disposal.\n\nTo achieve this presentation, the discontinued operation results include the intercompany cost for transactional services within the expenses line below.\n\nThe results of the discontinued operation, which have been included in the profit for the period, were as follows:\n\n6 months\n\nended\n\n30 September\n\n2020\n\n£0006 months\n\nended\n\n30 September\n\n2019\n\n£000Year\n\nended\n\n31 March\n\n2020\n\n£000Revenue34,472 35,042 69,712Cost of revenue(27,333)(28,384)(56,479)Gross profit7,1396,65813,233Expenses(3,465)(3,416)(6,704)Operating profit3,6743,2426,529Finance income184169382Finance costs(70)(53)(94)Profit before tax3,7883,3586,817Tax(556)(546)(1,171)Profit from discontinued operation attributable to equity holders of the parent 3,2322,8125,646\n\nCash flows (used in)/from discontinued operation\n\n6 months\n\nended\n\n30 September\n\n2020\n\n£0006 months\n\nended\n\n30 September\n\n2019\n\n£000Year\n\nended\n\n31 March\n\n2020\n\n£000Net cash from operations4,161 3,690 6,942Net cash (used in)/from investing activities(439) 149 678Net cash used in financing activities(6,570)- (920)Effect of foreign exchange rate changes361 58 366Net cash flow for the period(2,487) 3,897 7,066\n\n10.

An equivalent balance is included within trade and other payables.\n\n11. Cash and cash equivalents\n\nThe Group operates cash pooling amongst its various bank accounts in the UK and therefore individual accounts can be overdrawn without penalties being incurred so long as the overall position is in credit.\n\nIncluded within cash and cash equivalents of £42.0 million (2019: £40.5 million) are balances of £27.2 million (2019: £34.8 million) relating to funds collected on behalf of clients where PayPoint has title to the funds (clients’ funds) and where retailer partners have provided security deposits (retailer partners’ deposits). An equivalent balance is included within trade payables (note 12). Clients’ funds held in trust which are not included in cash and cash equivalents amounted to £51.0 million at 30 September 2020 (2019: £38.4 million).\n\n12.

Share capital\n\nShare capital as at 30 September 2020 was £228,220. During the period PayPoint plc issued 89,294 (September 2019: 111,602) shares for the 2017 LTIP, DABS, SIP and Restricted Share Plan which were all equity settled share schemes. All ordinary shares were issued with a par value of 1/3 pence each.\n\n14. Share-based payments\n\nThe total charge of £0.9 million (September 2019: £1.4 million) recognised directly to equity for schemes which have lapsed or vested was transferred from the share-based payments reserve to retained earnings during the period.\n\nOn 27 July 2020 the following restricted share awards (RSAs) were issued to eligible employees: 20,117 2-year RSAs, 140,894 3-year RSAs, 14,861 4-year RSAs and 14,861 5-year RSAs. The restricted share awards do not contain any performance criteria and will vest over either 2, 3, 4 or 5 years.\n\nA further 2,532 share awards were issued under the DABS scheme with vesting over three years to 09 June 2023.\n\n15. Fair value of financial assets and liabilities\n\nThe Directors consider there to be no material difference between the book value and the fair value of the Group’s financial instruments at 30 September 2020, 30 September 2019 and 31 March 2020.\n\n16.

Ofgem Statement of Objection\n\nOn 30 Sept 2020, we announced that we had received a Statement of Objections from Ofgem relating to certain contractual terms with certain energy suppliers and retailers for the provision of over-the-counter (OTC) payment services. We are considering Ofgem’s provisional views set out in the Statement of Objections and will exercise our right to respond to Ofgem in due course. It is therefore too early at this stage to predict an outcome and any potential outflow of funds.\n\n18. Post balance sheet events\n\nOn 24 September 2020, PayPoint agreed to acquire all of the shares of i-movo Holdings Limited and its wholly owned subsidiary i-movo Limited for an initial consideration of £3.0 million and potential deferred, contingent consideration capped at £6.0m. The acquisition completed on 24 November 2020 after receiving approval from the regulatory authorities. The initial accounting of the business combination is yet to be finalised and therefore the allocation of the purchase price has not been disclosed.\n\nOn 4 November 2020, PayPoint agreed to acquire all of the shares of Handepay Limited and Merchant Rentals Limited for cash consideration of £70.0 million on a cash-free, debt-free basis. The acquisition is conditional on approval from the regulatory authorities which is expected to be received in the last quarter of the current financial year. The Group is now awaiting approval from the regulatory authorities before proceeding with the acquisition. Beneficial ownership and control of Handepay and Merchant Rentals would be transferred, and consideration paid, following regulatory approval. The initial accounting of the business combination is yet to be finalised and therefore the allocation of the purchase price has not been disclosed.\n\nPRINCIPAL RISKS AND Uncertainties\n\nSince the publication of the Annual Report, a further review of the key risks that could prevent PayPoint meeting its strategic objectives, its risk appetite and the risk management framework was undertaken. Key risks are highlighted below with changes in risk level denoted as follows > - risk level has not changed, ^ - risk level has increased and V risk level has reduced.\n\nRisk areaPotential impactMitigation strategiesChangeCredit and operational risk\n\nPayPoint processes large volumes of payments creating significant credit risks and risk of fraud and error. Significant credit exposures exist with large retailers and other counterparties, and failure of a large retailer or counterparty may result in significant financial loss. Effective operational controls are essential to settle funds securely and timely, and inadequate or failed controls may result in fraud, liquidity risk, contractual breaches or other financial loss.PayPoint has effective credit and operational\n\nprocedures and controls in place. Retailers and\n\ncounterparties are subject to ongoing credit\n\nassessments, and effective debt management\n\nprocesses are implemented. Settlement processes\n\nand controls are continually assessed and enhanced, and new systems and technology implemented.\n\nEffective governance is in place with segregation of duties and approval processes enforced to protect against fraud and error.> People and culture\n\nFailure to attract and develop key talent and\n\ncontinue evolving our culture may impact service levels and delivery of strategic initiatives. If we do not develop our employees and maintain an appropriate culture, our business performance and reputation may be damaged resulting in reduced revenue and growth.\n\nThe Executive Board define and advocate\n\nPayPoint’s values, and employee development and\n\nculture are key strategic priorities. Talent\n\nmanagement and people development are well\n\nestablished, and employment guidelines and ethical principles are implemented to assist maintaining a strong culture. Values and ethical principles are aligned with employee objectives and employee and retailer engagement surveys are regularly conducted to assess how we deliver on our values. PayPoint is protecting its employees through the Covid-19 pandemic by allowing employees to work from home and offering additional support and flexibility.> Losing key clients and retailers\n\nPayPoint has diversified portfolios of clients and retailers however some are more strategically important. Our business relies on an appropriate mix of clients and retailers and losing a key client or retailer has the ability to adversely impact the business model and reduce revenue.PayPoint builds strategic relationships with key\n\nclients and retailers and continually seeks to improve its service levels; including conducting retailer engagement surveys to monitor and enhance our performance. Key clients and retailers are on long-term contracts, and new clients and retailers are routinely onboarded maintaining and diversifying portfolios. New products and channels are also developed to diversify revenue streams and mitigate the impact of losing key clients or retailers in particular markets.> Competition and markets\n\nThe markets in which PayPoint operates, and the competition in those markets continue to evolve.\n\nCovid-19 has impacted PayPoint’s markets and may continue to do so. The decline in cash usage, and changes in consumer\n\ntrends and government policy may impact our core markets, and failure to implement effective strategies in response to changes will negatively impact revenue. Industry consolidation in the UK has increased the competitive environment, and our market proposition and service levels need to\n\nremain strong to maximise business performance.PayPoint closely monitors consumer and\n\ntechnological trends and engages with clients and\n\nretailers to continually improve service levels. The\n\nExecutive Board regularly reviews markets, trading\n\nopportunities, pricing and competitor activity, and\n\nthe Board oversee and challenge strategic direction.\n\nPayPoint invests in new products, services and\n\ntechnology and adapts to consumer trends such as\n\ngrowing its parcel and online payments businesses\n\nto capitalise on market changes.\n\n^Innovation and implementation\n\nFailure to innovate and implement new products, services and technology would impede business performance and our ability to achieve strategic goals. Our business relies on continued product enhancements and failing to improve products due\n\nto poor design, build or roll-out would ultimately reduce revenue. Continued system infrastructure improvements are essential in maintaining resilient and effective services, and ineffective infrastructure upgrades may impact future performance.PayPoint is committed to innovation and investing\n\nin new technology and products to support its\n\ncontinued growth. Products and services are\n\ncontinually reviewed and developed to enhance\n\nour proposition and service levels, consistent\n\nwith customer needs and expectations. Various\n\nimprovement programmes are under way and\n\neffective change management processes are\n\ndeployed by dedicated project teams. The Executive Board oversees all major projects to ensure governance and implementation are effective.>\n\nKey partners and suppliers\n\nPayPoint has a diverse range of suppliers and\n\npartners, however some suppliers and partners\n\nare more strategically important and not so easily\n\nsubstituted. If supply of goods or services is\n\ndisrupted or relationships cease before alternative\n\narrangements can be implemented, PayPoint may\n\nexperience difficulty maintaining service levels\n\npotentially resulting in revenue loss, reputational\n\ndamage or penalties. Continued uncertainties around Covid-19 remain a risk to PayPoint’s continued relationship with key partners and suppliers.PayPoint has effective partner and supplier\n\nselection processes and long-term contacts are\n\nimplemented for strategic partner and suppliers.\n\nWe aim to develop strong relationships with key\n\npartners and suppliers, and single points of failure are avoided where practicable, with alternative suppliers and partners contracted and continuity plans implemented. Impact assessments are conducted for critical dependencies and mitigation measures implemented.> Business interruption\n\nService delivery interruption caused by system\n\nfailure, loss of premises, or other disruption may\n\nimpede performance and harm our reputation.\n\nClients, retailers and consumers rely on resilient\n\nsystems and continued service delivery, and failure to promptly recover services may result in revenue loss, contractual breaches, penalties and increased costs. PayPoint’s important transition from cash to digital creates an upward trend in interruption risk and a recent interruption incident was encountered. Additionally, continued uncertainties remain around Covid-19 which may impact PayPoint’s service delivery, therefore interruption risk is considered increasing.Comprehensive continuity plans have been\n\nimplemented to mitigate risk of disruption from\n\nCovid-19. Systems are continually upgraded and\n\nresilience is built into systems and processes.\n\nEffective change management processes are\n\ndeployed minimising risk of disruption, and systems are regularly tested and continually monitored for outages. PayPoint has a Major Incident Response Plan and business continuity and disaster recovery plans are implemented and regularly tested. Third party data centres are used with failover capabilities, and business continuity premises and work from home arrangements are implemented.^Legal and regulatory\n\nPayPoint is required to comply with numerous legal and regulatory requirements, and breaches of these obligations may result in costly corrective actions, reputational damage and prosecution. Regulatory landscapes continue to evolve, and changes in regulations and license requirements may adversely impact our business. In September 2020, PayPoint received a Statement of Objections from Ofgem under the Competition Act, and possible outcomes from the Statement of Objections are a risk for the Company. PayPoint is subject to numerous contractual requirements and failure to meet obligations may result in penalties and financial loss.PayPoint’s legal team work closely with management to advise on regulatory matters and adopt strategies to ensure regulatory adherence. Legal teams are engaged on key contracts and legal matters, and compliance teams oversee compliance programmes, monitoring and reporting. PayPoint is in the process of responding to the Statement of Objections received from Ofgem. Emerging\n\nregulations are incorporated into strategic planning, and we engage with regulators to ensure we have appropriate frameworks to support new products and markets. External counsel is engaged where required.^Cyber security and data protection\n\nCyber attacks on PayPoint’s systems and networks may significantly impact service delivery and data protection causing harm to PayPoint, our clients, retailer partners and other stakeholders. Although PayPoint continues to upgrade and enhance its cyber security capabilities, attacks are a constant threat, with increased ransomware attacks on businesses over the last 12 months. Covid-19 has heightened cyber risk with significant reliance on home working tools and criminals exploiting vulnerabilities. Failure to comply with service de"
