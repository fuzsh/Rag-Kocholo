This made it possible to reconstruct around 65,000 journeys using eight different modes of transport.

Car trips, on the other hand, are less likely to be replaced. However, an important distinction must be made between private ownership of e-scooters and the sharing model. Shared e-scooters emit more CO2 than the mode of transportation they replace, while privately owned e-scooters emit less CO2 than the mode of transportation they replace.
