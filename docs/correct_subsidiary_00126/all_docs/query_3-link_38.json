        "text": "PayPoint Plc\n\nResults for the year ended 31 March 2024\n\nFurther progress towards £100m EBITDA by end of FY26\n\nThree-year share buyback programme commencing with at least £20m over the next 12 months\n\nGROUP FINANCIAL HIGHLIGHTS\n\nUnderlying EBITDA1 of £81.3 million (FY23: £61.3 million) increased by £20.0 million (32.6%)\n\nUnderlying profit before tax2 of £61.7 million (FY23: £50.8 million) increased by £10.9 million (21.5%)\n\nNet corporate debt7 of £67.5 million reduced by £4.9 million from opening position of £72.4 million\n\nFinal dividend of 19.2 pence per share declared vs the final dividend for the year ended 31 March 2023 of 18.6 pence per share\n\nYear ended 31 March 2024 FY24 FY233 Change Revenue £306.4m £167.7m 82.7% Net revenue4 £181.0m £128.9m 40.4% Underlying EBITDA1 £81.3m £61.3m 32.6% Underlying profit before tax2 £61.7m £50.8m 21.5% Adjusting items5 £(13.5)m £(8.2)m 64.6% Profit before tax £48.2m £42.6m 13.1% Diluted underlying earnings per share6 62.6p 60.3p 3.8% Diluted earnings per share 48.8p 49.6p (1.6)% Net corporate debt7 £(67.5)m £(72.4)m (6.8)%\n\nNick Wiles, Chief Executive of PayPoint Plc, said:\n\n“This has been another year of progress for PayPoint where we have delivered a robust financial performance and made further progress towards delivering £100m EBITDA by the end of FY26. These results reflect both the resilience of our businesses and the transformation delivered over the past three years as we unlock further opportunities and growth across our four business divisions.\n\nIn the current year, consumer behaviour across a number of our businesses remains subdued, reflecting continued tighter family budgets and a generally flat economy. Our expectation is that the consumer outlook will improve during the course of the year.\n\nAgainst this background, our streamlined organisational structure and cost base will support the delivery of our medium-term growth plans. Strong earnings growth and cash flow generation, combined with a sustainable dividend policy provide a robust platform for the Board to propose further steps to enhance shareholder returns through a share buyback programme of at least £20 million over the next 12 months, all underpinned by the delivery of further progress in the current year.”\n\nSHARE BUYBACK PROGRAMME\n\nToday the Group announces its intention to commence a 3-year share buyback programme (the “Buyback Programme”). This Buyback Programme reflects the strong cash generative nature of the Group, along with the Board’s confidence in delivering on our growth targets for FY25-FY27 and in-line with our commitment to enhance shareholder returns.\n\nThe Buyback Programme will return at least £20 million to shareholders over the next 12 months, with the potential to increase in years 2 and 3 depending on business performance, market conditions, cash generation and the overall capital needs of the business.\n\nThroughout this period, we will continue to increase dividends at a nominal rate and grow our cover ratio from the current 1.5 to 2.0 times earnings range to over 2.0 times earnings by FY27. Combined with the Buyback Programme, this will enhance shareholder returns and ensure the business continues to maintain an efficient capital structure, balancing an appropriate leverage ratio of around 1.0 times net debt/EBITDA with the overall capital needs of the business.\n\nOPERATIONAL HIGHLIGHTS\n\nThe Group has delivered significant progress in the year in a number of key growth areas:\n\nParcels and Network Expansion – positive momentum on journey to achieving a 250m+ parcel network.

Total digital net revenue decreased by 12.7% to £13.8 million (FY23: £15.8 million), with the prior year including the one-off benefit of £3.5 million from the Energy Bills Support Scheme\n\nCash through to digital net revenue now stabilised to £6.8 million in the year (FY23: £6.9 million), with a new baseline set for the category and continued growth in banking with over £430 million of deposits processed for neobanks\n\nCash payments net revenue decreased by 2.5% to £32.8 million (FY23: £33.6 million). Legacy energy sector net revenue decreased by 10.6% for the full year, the rate of decline moderating in H2 FY24 to -2.6% versus the sharp fall of -19.2% in H1 FY24.\n\nLove2shop divisional net revenue was £51.3 million (FY23 – one month only post-acquisition: £3.4 million)\n\nPark Christmas Savings returned to growth, delivering £162.6 million of billings for the Christmas 2023 season, an increase of 1.2% versus the prior year (Christmas 20228: £160.7 million). The Christmas 2024 season has started positively, with payment rates +5% versus the prior year and a reduction in the number of ‘nil paid’ customers of 21%, driven by a proactive plan to improve conversion and completion of savings targets\n\nLove2shop Business experienced a weaker billings performance than expected in H2, as indicated in our Q3 trading update, with £162.8 million delivered in FY24 (FY239: £170.3 million). This was seen particularly in employee rewards, reflecting the broader caution from large businesses and the overall challenging economic situation. New corporate APIs were launched in November 2023, with the first clients onboarded shortly after, and a restructured corporate sales team now in place\n\nMBL, the leading gift card technology platform acquired by Love2shop in June 2022, processed £59.7 million of gift card value in the year (FY23: £43.6 million) for its extensive client base, including Greggs, B&M and Argos.\n\nRECONCILIATION OF REPORTED NUMBERS\n\n£m FY24 FY23 Reported profit before tax 48.2 42.6 Exceptional items10 5.2 5.6 Profit before tax excluding exceptional items 53.4 48.2 Net movement on convertible loan notes – OBConnect and Optus 0.2 - Amortisation of intangible assets arising on acquisition – PayPoint (previous acquisitions) 2.1 2.1 Amortisation of intangible assets arising on acquisition – Love2shop 6.0 0.5 Underlying profit before tax (profit before tax excluding adjusting items) 61.7 50.8 Underlying EBITDA 81.3 61.3\n\nBUSINESS DIVISION NET REVENUE AND MIX\n\nNet revenue by business division (£m) FY24 FY23 FY22 Shopping\n\nE-commerce\n\nPayments & Banking 64.4\n\n11.8\n\n53.5 62.0\n\n7.3\n\n56.2 58.7\n\n4.9\n\n51.5 PayPoint Segment Total 129.7 125.5 115.1 Love2shop Segment Total 51.3 3.4 N/A PayPoint Group Total 181.0 128.9 115.1 Business division mix FY24 FY23 FY22 Shopping 35.6% 48.1% 51.0% E-commerce 6.5% 5.6% 4.3% Payments & Banking 29.6% 43.6% 44.7% Love2shop 28.3% 2.7% N/A\n\nEnquiries PayPoint plc FGS Global Nick Wiles, Chief Executive (Mobile: 07442 968960) Rollo Head Rob Harding, Chief Financial Officer (Mobile: 07525 707970) James Thompson (Telephone: 0207 251 3801)\n\nA presentation for analysts is being held at 9.30am today (13 June 2024) via webcast. This announcement, along with details for the webcast, is available on the PayPoint plc website: corporate.paypoint.com\n\nCHIEF EXECUTIVE’S REVIEW\n\nGROUP UPDATE\n\nRobust financial performance with further progress towards delivering £100m EBITDA by the end of FY26\n\nThis has been another year of progress for the PayPoint Group where we have delivered a robust financial performance and made further progress towards delivering £100m EBITDA by the end of FY26. These results reflect both the resilience of our businesses and the transformation delivered over the past three years as we unlock further opportunities and growth across our four business divisions.\n\nPartnership philosophy opening up new revenue opportunities\n\nOur partnership philosophy across the Group, combined with an intensity and focus on execution, is already unlocking new markets and revenue opportunities for us. This includes the recently announced partnerships with Royal Mail, Lloyds Bank and DVLA, our success in Open Banking working with Ovo and the Department for Energy Security and Net Zero, and the continued focus on our convenience retail sector relationships, working closely with our retailer partners and the key retail trade associations. This approach underpins our delivery across every business division, in addition to our growth building blocks in digital payments, card payments, parcels, community cash access, retailer services and our Love2shop business.\n\nStreamlined organisational structure and cost base to deliver medium-term growth\n\nDuring H2 FY24, we announced that we had commenced a thorough review to ensure we had the appropriate organisational structure and cost base to underpin our growth ambitions and, in part, mitigate inflationary cost pressures. Like many organisations in the UK, we are trading in a challenging economic climate and facing significant inflationary cost pressures, and need to be proactive in order to mitigate these pressures and maintain a strong business platform. The review concluded in March 2024 and a number of changes were implemented in April 2024 to simplify the structure, enhance cross company collaboration and deliver efficiencies to enable future reinvestment in the business, representing a gross cost saving of circa £4 million for FY25.\n\nREVIEW BY DIVISION\n\nSHOPPING DIVISION\n\nIn Retail Services, we have further enhanced our retailer propositions, with positive feedback from our partners and additional value delivered to our retailers through a 21.5% increase in commission paid year on year. In November 2023, our next generation device, PayPoint Mini, was launched and our integrated third-party EPoS solution, PayPoint Connect, is now rolling out across our estate, working in partnership initially with the Retail Data Partnership and iPosG. Our FMCG consumer engagement proposition, PayPoint Engage, has delivered its first seven figure net revenue contribution, delivering brand campaigns for major consumer brands, leveraging our PayPoint One platform, advertising screens and vouchering capability. In addition, we launched Love2shop physical gift cards for the first time in over 2,600 locations for the Christmas 2023 gifting season, partnering with key multiple retailers, including One Stop, MFG, Henderson’s Retail and CJ Lang, with a further rollout to independent retailers underway in the current year.\n\nIn Cards, the positive momentum has continued to grow, driven by further improvements to our merchant proposition, including our recently launched Handepay Rewards scheme, a strengthened pricing governance approach and a continued focus on proactive churn management driven by AI and analytics. Our recently announced major partnership expansion with Lloyds Bank will enhance our proposition further, strengthening our market position, accelerating growth across our merchant estates and delivering better tools, support and experience for our SME and retailer partners. The expanded partnership, starting with an initial phase in Q2 FY25, followed by a full launch expected in Q3 FY25 (subject to regulatory approval), will offer merchants a market-leading banking and card services proposition combining card payments, a 12-month fee-free Lloyds bank business account and a connected competitive commercial card offering. Lloyds Bank Cardnet will be investing significantly into their business to enhance product development and data analytics for merchants.\n\nIn our building Community Cash Access and Banking network, ATM performance has been disappointing, with net revenue decreasing by 8.2% year on year. Management in this area has been strengthened, with a new hire secured to drive tighter operational management of the estate and to win new estate growth opportunities. Our Counter Cash service, offering withdrawals and balance enquiries over the counter, has grown to 2,150 locations, and, we have processed over £430 million of consumer deposits for our neobank clients in the year. We are now actively exploring how we support High Street Bank customers with cash access for consumer and SME deposits and withdrawals across our extensive network.\n\nWe have continued to strengthen our retailer partner relationships and service, including a refreshed approach to the ‘early life’ support provided to our retailer partners to drive adoption of new services, the launch of a new chatbot and automated services for day-to-day queries, more direct communications and our strengthened relationships with the key retail trade associations. Our broader commitment to our retailer partners to deliver further value and opportunities to earn has delivered an increase to a positive NPS score for the first time in six years. As more critical services continue to withdraw from communities and High Streets across the UK, we are more focused than ever on working closely with our retailer and industry partners to evolve our service provision and ensure we can leverage our extensive network to provide vital infrastructure and accessibility to individuals close to where they live.\n\nEMERGING OPPORTUNITIES\n\nFMCG – further growth from our consumer engagement platform, PayPoint Engage\n\nForeign Currency – development of our partnership with eurochange in circa 500 stores\n\nPark Christmas Savings – optimisation of our network of Super Agents for recruiting savers\n\nE-COMMERCE DIVISION\n\nIn E-commerce, it has been a landmark year for Collect+, with net revenue of £11.8 million delivered and parcel transactions exceeding 100 million for the first time. This excellent performance has been delivered against the backdrop of an increasingly challenged UK online retail market, with total market parcel volumes down in each year since the recent peak of 2021 and a number of major brands failing in the year. Our partnership with Yodel/Vinted has delivered strong growth in our new Store to Store service, which has been quickly adopted by consumers and our carrier partners. We have also expanded our Amazon network to over 7,000 stores and a further rollout of Zebra printer technology has also been completed in the year, underlining our continuing commitment to invest in improving the consumer experience in store.\n\nImportantly, we have announced new and expanded partnerships with Royal Mail and Yodel, particularly via their relationship with Vinted, reinforcing the quality and attractiveness of our leading Out of Home network and ensuring that we continue to deliver positive volume growth over the current financial year. We have also successfully expanded the Collect+ network into new locations and demographics, including our growing student presence working with 15 of the top universities and student unions.\n\nEMERGING OPPORTUNITIES\n\nExpanded carrier relationships – broadening range of services offered to each of our carrier partners, leveraging our superior in-store technology and network to drive further volume growth\n\nNetwork expansion – expanding from extensive convenience retail network into new sectors and locations, including student unions, transport hubs and hospitals\n\nPrint In Store – further rollout of circa 2,000 additional Zebra label printers to widen access to service and support new partnerships, including Royal Mail\n\nPAYMENTS & BANKING DIVISION\n\nIn Payments & Banking, our integrated digital payments platform, MultiPay, continues to establish itself as a comprehensive payment solution for clients across card processing, Open Banking, direct debit and cash. We have secured further wins in the Housing sector, with Rooftop and Sovereign Network Group, and in the Charity sector with East Anglian Air Ambulance. We have processed over £430 million of neobank consumer deposits through our retailer partner network and are expanding our community cash banking solutions across the UK. We were also pleased to have won the DVLA contract for International Driving Permits, which went live on 1 April 2024, marking another key central government service that will be fulfilled via our extensive retailer network.\n\nOur Open Banking services continue to go from strength to strength, supported by our partner, OB Connect, with 25 clients live for our services, including Ovo and AMEX for Confirmation of Payee. In particular, our work with Citizens Advice in Stevenage, and a growing number of Citizens Advice offices nationally, utilising our FIS (Financial Information Service) support tool, is having an important impact on the work they do supporting clients in financial distress – debt caseworkers are now able to get an up to date, accurate and holistic view of someone’s finances in minutes, when it used to take weeks or even months. As a result, they can provide advice and information faster, reducing the risk of debts becoming even greater or more serious throughout the advice process. Open Banking payments in the UK grew 90% year on year to 130m payments in 2023 and PayPoint is now one of the leading Payment Initiation Service Providers (PISP) in the UK. This is an important demonstration of how our digital payments solutions are having a strong community impact, which is underpinned by our continuing engagement with key senior stakeholders across the sectors we operate in, including Ofgem, UK Finance, Pay.UK and the Department of Energy Security and Net Zero.\n\nIn Cash, legacy energy bill payments net revenue decreased by 10.6% for the full year, with the rate of decline year on year moderating in H2 FY24 to -2.6% versus the sharp fall of -19.2% in H1 FY24. The decreased H1 FY24 performance was driven by several factors, including a shift in consumer topping up behaviour due to the Cost of Living challenges, unseasonably warm weather over the period and the impact of customers still using credit from the Energy Bills Support Scheme (EBSS) up until the end of the half year. In H2, energy sector performance recovered as the EBSS scheme ended, with the rate of decline moderating versus the prior year. In addition, the energy price cap, updated by Ofgem on a quarterly basis, was set at £1,928 for pre-pay customers for January to March 2024, decreasing over the course of FY24 from £4,358 in the same period last year. The impact of this reduction in our consumer energy top up frequency and volumes is not yet clear in the current financial year.\n\nEMERGING OPPORTUNITIES\n\nNew business growth – build a more systematic approach to growing our client base in target sectors of Housing and Charities for our MultiPay platform\n\nStrengthening PayPoint and Love2shop collaboration – develop closer alignment between the corporate sales teams, driving revenue opportunities across both client bases and leveraging the Group’s comprehensive payments solutions\n\nOpen Banking growth – further expansion of our Open Banking services to new and existing sectors, leveraging CCS/DPS frameworks and working in partnership with OBConnect and Aperidata, an innovative consumer and business credit reporting and Open Banking platform\n\nGovernment services – expand range of services provided for central and local government, building on the DVLA International Driving Permit service win and the existing DWP Payment Exception Service\n\nLOVE2SHOP DIVISION\n\nIn Park Christmas Savings, it was particularly pleasing to see a return to growth in the Christmas 2023 season, with conversion to paid for new customers up 5%, retention rates for direct customers the highest to date at 77%, and agency size maintained at an average of 4.49 savers per agent. In addition, a new closed-loop Mastercard (Purple Card) was launched with 140+ brands, exclusively for Park customers. The 2024 savings season has started positively, with payment rates +5% versus the prior year, cash collected +1% versus the prior year and a reduction in the number of ‘nil paid’ customers of 21%, driven by a proactive plan to improve conversion and encouraging savers to stay on track with payments, leveraging PayPoint’s Pay By Link service for when a payment has been missed. This again reinforces the enduring appeal and vital role this service plays in helping consumers budget for big occasions and avoid debt, with a Trustpilot rating of 4.6/5 and over £2 million of value delivered to savers each year. In our first year, we have established a Park Super Agent network of circa 1,700 PayPoint retailer partners, with a modest number of savers recruited and with plans underway to improve on this early success in the 2025 season.\n\nIn Love2shop Business, we experienced a more challenging H2, with billings down year on year due to the broader caution from large businesses, particularly with employee rewards. We have now taken steps in the year to address this, investing in additional APIs to unlock further sales growth and establishing a restructured corporate sales team to better manage our existing relationships and drive new business, with some early success already evident in Q4 FY24. There is now a strong pipeline of new business building into the current financial year and much closer alignment with the business development team in PayPoint, driving revenue opportunities within both client bases. On highstreetvouchers.com, a key acquisition channel for B2B sales, we made important changes in Q4 FY24 to the product mix and focus of the site, prioritising corporate sales and digital products, which has resulted in improved margin and profitability for billings generated via this channel and where we will continue to optimise activity into the current financial year.\n\nIn addition, we are well-positioned to leverage the technology platform and capabilities of MBL, which was acquired by Love2shop in 2022, to expand the range of products that we offer to our corporate clients and grow gift card management services with more retailers. This will build on the £59.7 million of gift card value processed in FY24 and a strong client base including Greggs, Argos and Pizza Express. A number of major brands were also added in the year to Love2shop as redemption partners, including B&Q, Currys, Adidas, WH Smith, Matalan & Blackwell’s and a successful refresh of the Love2shop brand was delivered.\n\nEMERGING OPPORTUNITIES\n\nLove2shop channel and partnership expansion - delivering further growth through new partnerships, expanded provision of gift card management services and acceleration of Love2shop Business\n\nLove2shop Gift Cards – grow sales within multiple retailer network of circa 2,600 stores\n\nPark Christmas Savings – expand into delivering white label savings schemes for partners and broaden prepaid savings occasions beyond Christmas\n\nUPDATE ON CLAIMS AGAINST PAYPOINT\n\nIn FY24, a number of companies in the PayPoint Group, including PayPoint Plc, received two claims relating to issues addressed by commitments accepted by Ofgem in November 2021 as a resolution of Ofgem’s concerns raised in its Statement of Objections received by the PayPoint Group in September 2020. The Ofgem resolution did not include any infringement findings.\n\nThe first claim was served by Utilita Energy Limited and Utilita Services Limited (subsequently renamed Luxion Sales Limited) (“Utilita”) on 16 June 2023. The second claim was served by Global-365 plc and Global Prepaid Solution Limited (“Global 365”) on 18 July 2023. Paypoint can confirm that a first Case Management Conference (CMC) was held on 31 October 2023 at the Competition Appeal Tribunal relating to these claims. The focus of the first CMC was to agree disclosure and a timetable for proceedings. PayPoint can also confirm that a second CMC was held on 26 April 2024 to agree further disclosure and the appointment of expert witnesses for all parties. A provisional date for a third CMC was set for 28 October 2024. Both claims have been listed for a joint trial at the Competition Appeal Tribunal starting on 10 June 2025.\n\nThe Group’s position remains unchanged: it is confident that it will successfully defend the claim by Utilita, which does not provide any clear evidence to support the cause of action or the amount claimed, and also that it will successfully defend the claim by Global 365, which fundamentally misunderstands the energy market and the relationships between the relevant Group companies and the major energy providers, whilst also over-estimating the opportunity available, if any, for the products offered by Global 365. Consequently, no accounting provision has been made for these claims.\n\nThe Group will continue to update the market on a quarterly basis as part of its financial reporting cycle.\n\nOUTLOOK AND DIVIDEND\n\nThe streamlining of our organisational structure and delivery of our FY24 financial performance are important building blocks to achieving our financial targets, including the delivery of £100 million EBITDA by the end of FY26.\n\nIn the current year, consumer behaviour across a number of our businesses remains subdued, reflecting continued tighter family budgets and a generally flat economy. Our expectation is that this consumer outlook will improve during the course of the year.\n\nAgainst this background, our confidence in the prospects for the business is underpinned by the actions we are taking in each of our divisions to accelerate performance and identify new opportunities. In addition, our commitment today to a three-year share buyback programme, commencing with at least £20 million over the next twelve months, will enhance shareholder returns and is reflective of our long-term confidence in the business and our underlying cash flow. The Board has proposed an ordinary final dividend of 19.2p per share, an increase of 3.2% vs the prior year final dividend of 18.6p per share, consistent with our dividend policy and target cover range of 1.5 to 2.0 times earnings excluding exceptional items.\n\nWe remain confident in delivering further progress in the current year and achieving our medium-term financial goals.\n\nNick Wiles\n\nChief Executive\n\n12 June 2024\n\nKEY PERFORMANCE INDICATORS\n\nPayPoint Group has identified the following KPIs to measure progress of business performance:\n\nKPI Description, purpose and reference FY24 FY2311 FY22 Overall performance\n\nNet revenue\n\n(£ million) Revenue from continuing operations less commissions paid to retailers and Park Christmas Savings agents and costs where the Group is principal for SIM cards and single retailer vouchers. This reflects the benefit attributable to the Group’s performance eliminating pass-through costs and is an important measure of the overall success of our strategy.\n\n(See Financial review – ‘Overview’ on page 9) 181.0 128.9 115.1 Underlying EBITDA\n\n(£ million) This measures our earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation, net movements in convertible loan notes and exceptional items. This is an important measure as it is widely used by investors, analysts and other interested parties to evaluate profitability of companies.\n\n(See Financial review – ‘Overview’ on page 10) 81.3 61.3 58.2 Underlying profit before tax (profit before tax excluding adjusting items)\n\n(£ million) Underlying profit before tax (profit before tax excluding adjusting items), provides a measure of the operational performance of the Group. This reflects the rebalancing of the business towards growth opportunities, the shift away from our legacy cash payments business and is an important measure of the overall success of our strategy.\n\n(See Financial review – ‘Overview’ on page 9) 61.7 50.8 48.0 Net corporate debt\n\n(£ million) Net corporate debt represents cash and cash equivalents excluding cash recognised as clients’ funds, retailer partners’ deposits, and card and voucher deposits, less amounts borrowed under financing facilities (excluding IFRS 16 liabilities).

Net revenue increased by £52.1 million (40.4%) to £181.0 million (2023: £128.9 million), with the Love2shop (L2s) segment contributing an increase of £47.9 million with a full year of revenue compared to one month in the previous year. Revenue from the PayPoint segment increased by £9.7 million to £169.8 million (2023: £160.1 million) predominately driven by the growth in e-commerce, with parcel transactions exceeding 100 million in the year, partially offset by the cash payments decline in Payments & Banking.\n\nTotal costs increased by £41.2 million to £119.3 million (2023: £78.1 million). The increase in costs was driven by the £37.2 million additional costs from a full year of L2s compared to one month in the previous year, together with increases in transactional costs of revenue and depreciation of terminals and devices used to drive revenue in the business. Exceptional costs of £5.2 million, which are one-off, non-recurring and do not reflect current operational performance, consisted of £2.0 million restructuring costs, £2.1 million in relation to legal fees incurred as a result of the Group’s defence of claims served against it and £1.1m in relation to costs associated with refinancing for the Group.\n\nThe underlying profit before tax for the Group increased by £10.9 million (21.5%) to £61.7 million (2023: £50.8 million). This result includes 12 months of contribution from L2s leading to an increase of £10.7 million in underlying profit before tax.\n\nProfit before tax of £48.2 million (2023: £42.6 million) increased by £5.6 million (13.1%). The increase reflects a full year of profit contribution from the L2s segment compared to the prior year which only included one month.\n\nEBITDA / Underlying EBITDA (£m) Year ended 31 March 2024 Year ended 31 March 2023 Profit before tax 48.2 42.6 Add back: Net interest expense 7.0 2.6 Depreciation & Amortisation - including amortisation of intangible assets arising on acquisition 20.7 10.5 EBITDA (£m) 75.9 55.7 Exceptional items and net movement in convertible loan notes 5.4 5.6 Underlying EBITDA (£m) 81.3 61.3\n\nUnderlying EBITDA increased by £20.0 million to £81.3 million (2023: £61.3 million), which comprises £17.8 million for the L2s segment and £63.5 million for the PayPoint segment.\n\nCash generation reduced by £2.5 million to £57.9 million (2023: £60.4 million), delivered from profit before tax of £48.2 million (2023: £42.6 million). There was a net working capital outflow of £11.8 million, of this £3.2 million related to payment of costs accrued for the Appreciate acquisition at the prior year end, £3.7 million for the extension of payment terms with a key customer, £3.0 million following an exceptionally high year of non-redemption income releases in L2s and £2.8 million resulting from the timing of redemption and expiry of various types of L2s products.\n\nNet corporate debt decreased by £4.9 million to £67.5 million (2022: £72.4 million) following cash generation of £57.9 million partially offset by tax, capital expenditure and dividends.

Service fees net revenue increased by £1.8 million (10.1%) driven by the implementation of the annual RPI increase and additional PayPoint sites. Cards net revenue increased by £0.9 million (2.8%), with site growth delivered in the Handepay EVO and PayPoint Lloyds Cardnet estates. ATM and Counter Cash net revenue decreased by £0.6 million (6.4%) due to a reduction in transactions driven by the continuing trend of reduced demand for cash across the economy. FMCG voucher revenue increased by £0.5 million (75.4%) to £1.1 million (2023: £0.6 million) following further campaigns run in the year.\n\nE-commerce net revenue increased by £4.5 million (61.6%) to £11.8 million (2023: £7.3 million), driven by strong growth in total transactions which increased by 77.5%. This was due to our strength in clothing/fashion categories, the investment in the in-store experience with Zebra label printers over the past 18 months and the continued expansion from new services and carrier partners.\n\nPayments & Banking net revenue decreased by £2.7 million (4.8%) to £53.5 million (2023: £56.2 million). Cash bill payments and top ups revenue decreased by £2.2 million (7.3%) to £27.8 million (2023: £30.0 million) driven by a 12.2% reduction in transactions following the reduced usage of cash and the continued switch to digital payments. Digital net revenue decreased by £2.0 million (12.7%) to £13.8 million (2023: £15.8 million) as a result of the EBSS scheme which benefited the previous year by £3.0 million. This was partially offset by an increase in interest income received on client balances resulting from the increase in interest rates.\n\nThe cost of commission to retailers increased by £7.4 million (21.5%) to £41.8 million (2023: £34.4 million). This increase in payment to our retailer partners reflects an increase in the number of transactions processed as well as more with higher commission rates per transaction\n\nTotal costs (excluding adjusting items) increased by £4.0 million (5.3%) to £79.2 million (2023: £75.2 million), primarily as a result of further investment in our people and field sales team to support growth in sales.\n\nSECTOR ANALYSIS\n\nSHOPPING\n\nShopping consists of services PayPoint provides to retailer partners, which form part of PayPoint’s network, and SME partners. Services include providing the PayPoint One platform (which has a basic till application), EPoS, card payments, terminal leasing, ATMs, Counter Cash and FMCG vouchering.\n\nNet revenue (£m) Year ended\n\n31 March 2024 Year ended\n\n31 March 2023 Change % Service fees 19.7 17.9 10.1% Card payments 32.7 31.8 2.8% ATMs and Counter Cash 8.8 9.4 (6.4)% Other shopping 3.2 2.9 10.3% Total net revenue (£m) 64.4 62.0 3.9%\n\nNet revenue increased by £2.4 million (3.9%) to £64.4 million (2023: £62.0 million) primarily due to the growth in service fees and Handepay/Merchant Rentals card payments.

Service fee net revenue increased by £1.8 million (10.1%) to £19.7 million driven by the additional revenue generating sites compared to the prior year.\n\nThe PayPoint One average weekly service fee per site increased by 7.3% to £19.1, following an annual RPI increase.\n\nCard Payments and leases Year ended\n\n31 March 2024 Re-presented16\n\nYear ended\n\n31 March 2023 Change % Net Revenue (£m) Card payments – Acquiring 23.3 23.5 (0.9)% Card payments – Rentals 8.8 7.8 12.8% Card payments – Lending and other 0.6 0.5 20.0% Services in Live sites (No.) Card payments – Handepay - EVO 19,682 18,397 7.0% Card payments – Handepay - Worldpay 2,572 3,839 (33.0)% Card payments – PayPoint 10,064 9,541 5.5% Card terminals – Merchant Rentals 49,844 47,085 5.9% Transaction value (£m) Card payments – Handepay 4,612 4,421 4.3% Card payments – PayPoint 2,561 2,457 4.2%\n\nCard payments: Card payments acquiring services generated £23.3 million net revenue in the year, a reduction of £0.2 million from the previous year (2023: £23.5 million). Transaction values overall have increased by 4.3% to £7,173 million (2023 £6,878 million) and Handepay new site sales increased in the year supported by an improved proposition, but sites have been impacted by higher churn, particularly in our Worldpay back book in this very competitive market.\n\nCard payment terminal rentals have increased by £1.0 million (2023: £7.8 million) mainly as a result of a change in the sales mix of operating leases compared to finance leases. Operating leases also have associated costs included in the profit and loss account.\n\nATMs and Counter Cash Year ended\n\n31 March 2024 Year ended\n\n31 March 2023 Change % Net Revenue (£m) 8.8 9.4 (6.4)% Services in Live sites (No.) 9,599 9,150 4.9% Active sites (No.) 5,635 5,400 4.4% Transactions (Millions) 28.5 30.1 (5.3)%\n\nATMs and Counter Cash: Net revenue reduced by £0.6 million (6.4%) to £8.8 million (2023: £9.4 million) as transactions reduced by 5.3% to 28.5 million. This is attributable to the continued reduced demand for cash across the economy, although our new product, Counter Cash, continues to grow. ATM and Counter Cash active sites increased 4.4% to 5,635 mainly as a result of the continued roll out of Counter Cash sites and PayPoint continued to optimise its ATM network by relocating existing machines to better performing locations.\n\nOther: Other shopping services increased by £0.3 million (10.3%) to £3.2 million (2023: £2.9 million) this includes FMCG voucher campaigns which have increased by 75.4%.\n\nE-COMMERCE\n\nParcels Year ended\n\n31 March 2024 Year ended\n\n31 March 2023 Change % Net Revenue (£m) 11.8 7.3 61.6% Services in Live sites (No.) 11,786 10,514 12.1% Transactions (Millions) 100.1 56.4 77.5%\n\nE-commerce net revenue increased by £4.5 million (61.6%) to £11.8 million following a record year for Collect+ as parcel transactions grew strongly by 77.5% to 100.1 million. This was driven by our strength in clothing/fashion categories and the investment in the in-store experience with Zebra label printers over the past 18 months. There has been continued expansion from new services, Yodel store to store and Amazon returns, and new carrier partnerships with Royal Mail.

The DWP Payment Exception Service contributed £3.9 million net revenue in the year (2023: £4.4 million) following the expected decrease in customers.

The year on year increase is driven by the impact of increased interest rates on our client cash balances.\n\nLOVE2SHOP SEGMENT\n\n£m Year ended\n\n31 March\n\n2024 One month in the Year ended\n\n31 March\n\n2023 Billings 359.3 14.8 Revenue 136.6 7.6 Net revenue 51.3 3.4 Other costs of revenue (7.0) (0.6) Depreciation and amortisation (administrative expenses) excluding amortisation on intangible assets arising on acquisition (2.5) (0.2) Other administrative costs (26.5) (1.8) Net finance costs (4.1) (0.3) Total costs (40.1) (2.9) Underlying profit before tax (excluding adjusting items) 11.2 0.5\n\nL2s has generated £359.3 million of total billings in the year. The primary focus of the business is the sale of multi-retailer redemption products. Revenue from these products is largely service fee received from retail partners when the products are spent, non-redemption income when the product expires, and interest income earned on prepaid funds. L2s also sells cards and vouchers that can only be redeemed at a single retailer, effectively acting as a reseller. For these products, L2s acts as the principal, and revenue is recognised at the full value of billings at the time of dispatch. Net revenue however is stated after deducting the costs for the single retailer product, reflecting the actual income generated from the sale. Net revenue for the year was £51.3 million with the previous period only including one month of contribution following the acquisition.\n\nThe business is seasonal in nature, and profit is primarily generated in the second half of the financial year, which represents the peak trading period for L2s corporate business and the dispatch of Park Christmas Savings prepaid products around Christmas.\n\nPROFIT BEFORE TAX AND TAXATION\n\nThe income tax charge of £12.5 million (2023: £7.9 million) on profit before tax of £48.2 million (2023: £42.6 million) represents an effective tax rate of 25.9% (2023: 18.5%). This is higher than the UK statutory rate of 25% mainly due to adjustments in respect of share based payments. The effective tax rate is higher than the prior year primarily as a result of the UK statutory rate of tax increasing from 19% to 25%.\n\nGROUP STATEMENT OF FINANCIAL POSITION\n\nNet assets of £121.2 million (2023: £111.7 million) increased by £9.5 million reflecting the growth in retained earnings. Current assets increased by £44.7 million to £296.6 million (2023: £251.9 million) due to an increase in the balance for items in the course of collection, an equal but opposite increase in the settlement payables is included in current liabilities. Non-current assets of £222.5 million (2023: £228.1 million) decreased by £5.6 million due amortisation of intangible assets partially offset by additional investment in terminals.\n\nTotal liabilities increased by £29.7 million to £398.0 million (2023: £368.3 million) due to an increase in settlement payables, as noted above.\n\nNet corporate debt was £67.5 million (2023: £72.4 million) and has decreased by £4.9 million from the previous year. Positive cash generation from trading has been offset by working capital requirements in the year along with tax payments, capital expenditure and dividend requirements. Total loans and borrowings were £93.9 million at the year end, reducing by £0.5 million from 31 March 2023. These consisted of a £36.0 million amortising term loan, £57.5 million drawdown of the £90.0 million revolving credit facility and £0.4 million of accrued interest (2023: £46.5 million drawdown from the revolving credit facility, £46.8 million of amortising term loans and £1.1 million of asset financing balances and accrued interest).\n\nGROUP CASH FLOW AND LIQUIDITY\n\nThe following table summarises the cash flow and net debt movements during the year.\n\n£m Year ended\n\n31 March 2024 Year ended\n\n31 March 2023 Change % Profit before tax 48.2 42.6 13.1% Non cash other exceptional items 0.2 1.3 (84.6)% Depreciation and amortisation 20.7 10.5 97.1% Share-based payments and other items 0.6 2.4 (75.0)% Working capital changes (corporate) (11.8) 3.6 n/m Cash generation 57.9 60.4 (4.1)% Taxation payments (8.4) (6.2) 35.5% Capital expenditure (16.2) (13.0) 24.6% Acquisitions & disposals of strategic investments and acquisitions (0.1) (44.4) n/m Payment of leases (1.0) (0.2) n/m Dividends paid (27.3) (25.1) 8.8% Net increase/(decrease) in net corporate 4.9 (28.5) n/m Net corporate debt at the beginning of the year (72.4) (43.9) 64.9% Net corporate debt at the end of year (67.5) (72.4) (6.8)% Comprising: Corporate cash less overdraft 26.4 22.0 Loans and borrowings (93.9) (94.4)\n\nCash generation reduced £2.5 million to £57.9 million (2023: £60.4 million) delivered from profit before tax of £48.2 million (2023: £42.6 million). There was a net working capital outflow of £11.8 million, of this £3.2 million related to payment of costs accrued for the Appreciate acquisition at the prior year end, £3.7m for the extension of payment terms with a key customer, £3.0 million following an exceptionally high year of non redemption income releases in L2s and £2.8 million resulting from the timing of redemption and expiry of various types of L2s products.\n\nTaxation payments on account of £8.4 million (2023: £6.2 million) were higher compared to the prior period, with the increase in the rate in corporation tax rate from 19% to 25%. Dividend payments were higher compared to the prior period following an increased interim and final ordinary dividend per share from the prior year ended 31 March 2023.\n\nCapital expenditure of £16.2 million (2023: £13.0 million) was £3.2 million higher than the prior year. Capital expenditure primarily consists of PayPoint One and card terminals, terminal development, the enhancement to the Direct Debit platform and IT hardware. The increase in capital expenditure is primarily the result of the inclusion of L2s, which accounts for £2.2 million of the £3.2 million.\n\nDIVIDENDS\n\nWe have declared an increase of 3.2% in the final dividend to 19.2 pence per share (2023: 18.6 pence per share) payable in equal instalments of 9.6 pence per share (2023: 9.3 pence per share) on 6 August 2024 and 27 September 2024 to shareholders on the register on 5 July 2024 and 30 August 2024 respectively. The final dividend is subject to the approval of shareholders at the annual general meeting on 1 August 2024.\n\nThe final dividend will result in £14.0 million (2023: £13.5 million) being paid to shareholders from the standalone statement of financial position of the Company which, as at 31 March 2024, had approximately £102.2 million (2023: £44.2 million) of distributable reserves.\n\nCAPITAL ALLOCATION\n\nThe Board’s immediate priority is to continue to preserve PayPoint’s balance sheet strength. The Group maintains a capital structure appropriate for current and prospective trading over the medium term that allows a healthy mix of returns to shareholders and cash for investments. The Group’s capital allocation priorities have been updated as follows:\n\nInvestment in the business through small investments and capital expenditure in innovation to drive future revenue streams and improve the resilience and efficiency of our operations;\n\nProgressive ordinary dividends targeting a growth of our earnings cover ratio from the current 1.5 to 2.0 times range to over 2.0 times by FY27\n\nA 3-year share buyback programme, returning at least £20 million over the next 12 months, with the potential to increase in years 2 and 3 depending on business performance, market conditions, cash generation and the overall capital needs of the business.\n\nTargeting an appropriate leverage ratio of around 1.0 times net debt/EBITDA\n\nGOING CONCERN\n\nThe financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis having regard to the identified principal risks and uncertainties and the viability statement on page 21. Our cash and borrowing capacity provides sufficient funds to meet the foreseeable needs of the Group including dividends.\n\nRob Harding\n\nChief Financial Officer\n\n12 June 2024\n\nPRINCIPAL RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES\n\nContinuous development and review, whilst maintaining a dynamic and effective risk management process, is vital to support the business in achievement of its strategy and business objectives. Risk management continues to be an essential part of PayPoint’s Corporate Governance.\n\nChanges to principal risks\n\nNew risks and disclosures\n\nThe integration of Love2shop into the wider PayPoint Group has continued over the financial year, including the roll-out of PayPoint’s risk management framework into Love2shop. Our risk appetite remains the same as last year.\n\nIt is defined as:\n\nRisk appetite Impact on profit before tax Low Under £2 million Medium Under £5 million High Over £5 million\n\nChanging risks\n\nCompetition & Markets – Recognising the increased importance of consumer behaviours and their impact on our business model, this risk has been relabelled as “Consumer Behaviours and Markets” to reflect the composition of this risk more fully. The appetite for this risk has been assigned as “high” to reflect the relationship between this risk and value creation / reward.\n\nOperating Model– This risk has now been renamed as “Client Services” to reflect clients becoming increasingly demanding in terms of need and service expectations, along with the compliance requirements accompanying those services.\n\nEmerging Risks\n\nESG and Climate Risk remains an emerging risk. Whilst we recognise the impact climate change is having globally, we continue to be a low-carbon producing company and, as such, these risks do not pose an immediate risk to our operations. We have embedded a strategy of reducing our carbon emissions, with a goal of becoming fully net-zero by 2040 (2030 for our own operations). Details of how we plan to achieve are set out in our annual report.\n\nIn 2022 we implemented The Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) which provides companies with a framework to improve reporting on climate-related risks and opportunities. Risks caused by climate change have been embedded into our enterprise risk management framework including our financial planning processes, business case development and our overall risk identification and management processes are set out in our annual report.\n\nThe table on pages 17 to 20 sets out our principal and emerging risks and includes: details of the potential impact; mitigation strategies; status of each risk; risk appetite; and exposure trend. They do not comprise all risks faced by the Group and are not set out in order of priority.\n\nRisk Trend & Appetite Potential Impact Mitigation Strategies Status Principal Risks 1 Consumer Behaviours and Markets\n\nTrend = Increasing\n\nAppetite =\n\nHigh\n\nPayPoint’s markets and competitors continue to evolve. The decline in legacy business cash usage is expected to continue prompting the need for further business diversification. The current economic climate, of continually rising prices and lower spend levels by consumers, has continued from the previous financial year. The impact in particular markets, such as the Cards market, has been noticeable with transaction process volumes remaining subdued. The Executive Board closely monitors consumer trends and spending behaviour, regularly re-assessing our markets, competitor activity, along with any opportunities to further de-risk its legacy business. We continue to develop our service offerings and to adapt to changes in consumer needs and behaviours, including strategic acquisitions or investments, where appropriate. Risk is increasing as cost of living pressures have continued in the year, causing changes in consumer activities, particularly in spending behaviours. This, along with the continued decline in cash legacy business has impacted income streams for certain parts of the business. 2 Emerging Technology\n\nTrend = Stable\n\nAppetite = Medium\n\nAs our markets continue to evolve, so does the technology supporting the service provision. Pressures to deliver new and innovative products remain and failure to keep pace with this technological change is a risk for the Group. We continually review technological developments (including the evolution of AI) to understand how new technologies can be used to support and enhance our service offerings. The Executive Board closely monitors emerging technologies and the impact they may have on the Group. We also develop and implement our own innovative technology, where appropriate. Risk is stable as Group acquisitions, investments and partnerships have helped to mitigate risks associated with emerging technologies. The ongoing programme of re-platforming our digital proposition will facilitate the further expansion of our presence in digital payment markets. We continue to roll out the new, updated version of our retailer terminal – the PayPoint Mini. 3 IT Transformation\n\nTrend = Increasing\n\nAppetite = Medium Several significant IT projects are in our 3-year plan and the delivery of these projects will be key to delivering our business strategy and growth aspirations, along with platform resilience.\n\nThe Executive Board is accountable for the management and delivery of these projects, with oversight from the Group Board. Risk is increasing as several of these projects have been mobilised after the FY24 year end and will be delivered over the course of the next 2 – 3 years. 4 Client Services\n\nTrend = Increasing\n\nAppetite = Medium\n\nClients’ expectations in terms of service level standards and compliance are increasing as the business diversifies into new products/ channels (such as community banking).\n\nClient retention and the exposure to clients developing in house solutions as an alternative to our services remains an ongoing risk, along with customer concentration risk, such as in Parcels.\n\nPayPoint builds and carefully manages strategic relationships with key clients, retailers, redemption partners and suppliers. We continually seek to improve and diversify services through new initiatives, products and technology and our involvement in new and innovative markets. Risk is increasing. We continue to renew contracts and onboard new retailers, clients, merchants and redemption partners in line with expectations. We have built on our services and continue to encourage our clients to diversify and utilise more than one of our service provisions. Working with our clients to continue to understand their requirements and how best we can meet our clients needs remains a priority for the Group. 5 Legal and\n\nRegulatory\n\nTrend = Stable\n\nAppetite = Low\n\nPayPoint is required to comply with numerous contractual, legal, and continuously evolving regulatory requirements. Failure to anticipate and meet obligations may result in fines, penalties, prosecution and reputational damage. Increased levels of regulatory supervision, the implementation of consumer duty and the addition of new service offerings, such as open banking and PISP, have all increased the complexity of the regulatory environment in which we operate. Our Legal and Compliance teams work closely with the business on all legal and regulatory matters and adopt strategies to ensure PayPoint is appropriately protected and complies with regulatory requirements. The teams advise on all key contracts and legal matters and oversee regulatory compliance, monitoring and reporting. Emerging regulations are incorporated into strategic planning, and we engage with regulators to ensure our frameworks are appropriate to support new products and initiatives. Risk is stable. We continue to manage new legal and regulatory exposures through our risk management framework and this framework has been rolled out across our Love2shop business following its acquisition in 2023.\n\nAs referenced in Note 11, the two claims served on a number of companies in the Group in relation to the matters addressed by commitments made to Ofgem in 2021 in resolution of Ofgem’s competition concerns are still ongoing. The Group's position remains unchanged and we are confident that we will successfully defend these claims.\n\n6 People\n\nTrend = Increasing\n\nAppetite = Low\n\nFailure to retain and attract key talent impacts many areas of our business. A key element of the 3 year plan is revenue growth, and we need to be confident we can attract/ retain those individuals who are instrumental in driving top line growth, along with individuals who will support the operational transformation of our business. Key person dependencies, at both executive and senior management levels, have been noted as a key risk.\n\nThe Executive Board continues to monitor this risk, with oversight from the Remuneration Committee. We continue to invest in our people, with a clear focus on retaining talent and key person dependency. PayPoint’s purpose, vision and values, are defined and embedded within the business, our expected behaviours and our review and monitoring processes. An employee forum comprising employees from across the business engages directly with the Executive Board on employee matters. Risk is increasing. The delivery of £100m EBITDA requires significant revenue growth over FY25 and FY26 and a key element of this is retaining and attracting key talent to support delivery of this growth. Employee engagement surveys remain positive and key actions around cost-of-living support, better employee interaction and flexible working have been implemented. 7 Cyber\n\nSecurity\n\nTrend = Increasing\n\nAppetite = Low\n\nCyber security risk continues to grow due to the growing volume and ever-increasing sophistication of the nature of these attacks and our expanding digital footprint. Such attacks may significantly impact service delivery and data protection causing harm to PayPoint, our customers and stakeholders. As the geographical instability has continued and increased over the last year, cyber-crime and its potential impact on our Group continues to increase as do our efforts to mitigate the likelihood of such an attack and in monitoring activities for potential instances of attack.\n\nRecognising the importance and potential impact this risk poses to our business, the Executive Board regularly assesses PayPoint’s cyber security and data protection framework, and the Cyber Security and IT Sub-Committee of the Audit Committee maintains oversight. Our IT security framework is comprehensive, with multiple security systems and controls deployed across the Group.\n\nWe are ISO27001 and PCI DSS Level 1 certified, and systems are constantly monitored for attacks with response plans implemented and tested.\n\nEmployees receive regular cyber security training, and awareness is promoted through phishing simulations and other initiatives. We have implemented tools to assist in quick identification of potential threats. We operate a robust incident response framework to address potential and actual breaches in our estate or within our supply chain. We engage with stakeholders, including suppliers on cyber-crime and proactively manage adherence with data protection requirements. Risk is increasing because of the growing volume and sophistication of cyber-attacks, coupled with our expanding digital footprint. We continue to enhance our architecture, systems, processes and cyber monitoring and response capabilities. We regularly engage third parties to assess and assist on our cyber defences and strengthen our controls and have implemented strong monitoring capability across the Group. 8 Business\n\nInterruption\n\nTrend = Increasing\n\nAppetite = Low\n\nFailure to provide a stable infrastructure environment or to promptly recover failed services following an incident can lead to loss of service provision and financial and reputational loss. Interruptions may be caused by system failures, cyber-attack, failure by a third party or failure of an internal process. Recovery of the service can be hampered by lack of appropriate resilience levels.\n\nPayPoint has developed a comprehensive and robust business continuity framework. This is reviewed by the Executive Board and the Cyber Security and IT Sub-Committee of the Audit Committee maintains oversight of the framework and its implementation. Business continuity, disaster recovery and major incident response plans are maintained and tested with failover capabilities across third party data centres and the cloud. Systems are routinely upgraded. With numerous change management processes deployed and resilience embedded where possible. Risk from supplier failure is managed through contractual arrangements, alternative supplier arrangements and business continuity plans. Risk is increasing. System disruption is an inherent business risk. However, we recognise that the acquisition of Love2shop, our IT transformation projects and our expansion into different products contribute to an increasing complexity of our operations. Better staff training and retention has enhanced our ability to detect and recover from service issues. 9 Credit and Liquidity/ Treasury Management\n\nTrend = Stable\n\nAppetite = Low\n\nThe Group has significant exposures to large clients/retailers, redemption partners and other counterparties. We process high volumes of payments which are dependent upon effective operational controls. The Group also operates a number of debt/banking covenants and interest expenses which must be carefully managed. Cash flow management plays an increasingly important role in the Group’s operations.\n\nPayPoint has effective credit and operational processes and controls.\n\nRetailers and counterparties are subject to ongoing credit reviews, and effective debt management processes are implemented. Settlement systems and controls are continually assessed and enhanced with new technology. We have effective governance with oversight committees, delegated authorities and policies for key processes. Segregation of duties and approvals are implemented for all areas where fraud or material error may occur. Residual risk associated with potential default of gift card providers is mitigated through insurance. Risk is stable. Cost of living pressures may impact our client and retail estate. However, we have robust monitoring and an increase in support payment processing in place to reduce default rates and impacts.\n\nThe risk profile of our business operations remains stable. We continue to review and enhance our operational processes and controls, and relationships with our funding partners. We successfully refinanced to support the acquisition of Love2shop and our cash generation remains robust. We also successfully refinanced our facility in June 2024. Liquidity targets as planned for the year have been met. 10 Operational Delivery\n\nTrend = Stable\n\nAppetite = Low\n\nDelivery of key initiatives and strategic objectives, including sales and service delivery growth, is key to achieving the desired success levels anticipated for the group. Successful planning, forecasting and successful execution of all business function areas are key to ensuring operational delivery. Supply chain management is also a key factor in delivering our operational targets. Failure to manage this risk would hamper our business performance, impact our stakeholders, and may lead to regulatory or legal sanctions.\n\nThe Executive Board has overall responsibility for delivering key initiatives implementing a robust control framework. The Executive Board has implemented a robust and effective reporting suite to ensure management of BAU activity is supported by timely and accurate business analysis. We continue to develop our Business Intelligence and Management information reporting capabilities to enhance, support and develop our management functions.\n\nOur project management methodology ensures projects are prioritised and governed effectively. Our existing\n\nprocesses are continuously reviewed to make sure they\n\nare efficient and well controlled. Risk is stable. We continue to focus on effective integration of Love2shop into our business. We continue to develop new services and enhance existing capabilities. Emerging Risk 1 ESG and Climate\n\nTrend = Stable\n\nAppetite = Medium\n\nWe continue to focus on environmental, social and governance matters and recognise that our business needs to be environmentally responsible to create shared value for\n\nall stakeholders.\n\nPayPoint continues to seek ways to reduce carbon emissions and its environmental impact.\n\nWe continue to closely monitor the impacts on our business to ensure our revenue streams remain sustainable. The CEO and the Executive Board have overall accountability for PayPoint’s climate and social responsibility agendas, and they recommend strategy to the Board. PayPoint aligns its business with reducing carbon emissions, and continually assesses its approach to environmental risk and social responsibility, which are embedded in our decision-making processes. We have multiple policies and processes governing our social responsibility strategy and we continually assess and evolve our strategy and working practices to ensure the best outcomes for stakeholders and the environment. Our ESG working group has implemented various measures as we embed low carbon strategies into our working practices and business strategy. The roll out of the PayPoint Mini, our new terminal, supports reduction of our carbon footprint through production of lower emissions. We continue the move toward electric cars for our company fleet helping our field team to travel in more environmentally friendly ways.\n\nWe run an employee forum and have implemented various measures as a result, such as cost of living support.\n\nVIABILITY STATEMENT\n\nIn accordance with the 2018 UK Corporate Governance Code, The Directors have assessed the viability of the Group over a three-year period, taking account of the Group’s current financial and trading position, the principal risks and uncertainties (as set out on pages 17 to 20) and the strategic plans that are reviewed at least annually by the Board.\n\nAssessment period\n\nThe Directors have determined that the Group’s strategic planning period of three years remains an appropriate timeframe over which to assess viability. This broadly aligns to average client renewal terms, new client prospecting and onboarding cycles and the development-through-to-maturity evolution of new products and service lines. The current financing facilities are in place until June 2028, broadly in line with this period.\n\nAssessment of prospects\n\nThe Directors assess the Group’s prospects through the annual strategy day, held this year in November 2023, and review of the Group’s three-year Plan, which was most recently in March 2024. The planning process forecasts the Group’s financial performance that include cash flows, allowing the Directors to assess both the Group’s liquidity and adequacy of funding. In its assessment of the Group’s prospects, the Directors have considered the following: —\n\nThe Group’s strategy and how it addresses changing economic environments in the context of our clients, parcel partnerships, merchants, prepay savers and retailer requirements.\n\nIn each of our business divisions we evolve our proposition to specifically address the requirements of our clients and merchants. In our Shopping division, our partnership with Lloyds Bank will provide a market-leading banking and card services proposition. In the e-Commerce division, the new partnerships with Royal Mail and Yodel/Vinted, together with new locations in Student unions creates additional convenience for online shoppers. In Payments and Banking, we are expanding our community cash banking solutions across the UK providing much needed access to cash for consumers. In Love2shop, we have added the ‘Essentials’ product to key government procurement frameworks and integrated this product into our PayPoint OpenPay service enabling consumers choice of cash or vouchers.\n\nThe Group’s inherent resilience to risk.\n\nThe Group has an inherent resilience to risk from its diversified proposition across many sectors. This means there are substantial opportunities to continue to provide more key services across all our customers (Retailers, SMEs, Clients, prepay savers and Parcel partnerships). This will ensure we are more integral to all of our customers. The business remains highly cash generative, enabling continued investment in key areas of growth to support the Group’s longer-term viability.\n\nExpectations of the future economic environment.\n\nThe economic environment remains uncertain. Higher inflation and cost of borrowing have and continue to impact consumer behaviours and confidence. The diversity and necessity of our proposition ensures the business can adapt to ongoing and unexpected changes. A good example of this is the Yodel/Vinted partnership which supports many value seeking consumers with purchases in the previously loved clothing market.\n\nThe Group’s financial position.\n\nAs at 31 May 2024 the Group had £66.2 million of net debt, split £11.6 million cash and £77.8 million utilised facilities. Compared to the total committed facilities of £135m means the group has substantial headroom of £68.8 million. This level of liquidity is sufficient for all viability scenarios.\n\nAssessment of viability\n\nTo assess our viability, we modelled different scenarios by considering the potential impact of the principal risks (as shown in the table on pages 17 to 20). Risks are broadly unchanged, the additional investments required to realise our integration and plan targets are included in the plan financial projections. We have reassessed the group’s scenarios to reflect the progress made in delivering our strategy. All ten principal risks were used in our modelling. They were chosen because they combine to represent plausible scenarios covering a range of different operational and financial impacts on the business.\n\nIn total, three severe but plausible individual scenarios have been modelled, with a fourth reverse stress test scenario. These scenarios and the assumptions within are detailed in the table below. Theoretically all these scenarios, with differing causes could occur together, with varying levels of impact. However, we have not included a combined scenario of scenarios A to C.\n\nNone of the separate scenarios modelled was found to impact the long-term viability of the Group over the assessment period. In assessing each of the scenarios, we have taken account of the mitigating actions available to us, including, but not limited to reducing discretionary operating spend, reducing non-committed capital expenditure, repricing our products and services, freezing recruitment, reducing variable incentives and temporary suspension of dividend payments.\n\nConclusion\n\nHaving assessed the Group’s current position, potential impacts of principal risks, managing adverse conditions in the past, potential mitigating actions and prospects of the Group, the Directors confirm they have a reasonable expectation that the Group will be able to continue in operation, remain solvent and meet its liabilities as they fall due over the three-year assessment period.\n\nScenario modelled Linked to principal risks Assumptions Scenario A\n\nA sharp economic decline in the economy and our markets causes material divergence on planned product growth rates or accelerated declines\n\nRisk (1) Competition and markets,\n\nRisk (2) Emerging technology,\n\nRisk (4) Operating model\n\nRisk (10) Operational delivery\n\nTransactions/merchants/estate\n\nAreas of growth have been reduced or held flat and in areas of decline have been assumed to continue or accelerate those declines.\n\nMargins, revenue rates per transaction/merchants or estate\n\nMargins and rates have been held in line with planned levels\n\nCosts\n\nNo cost savings assumed however bonus would not be paid.\n\nAll of the above are assumed to impact for FY24/25 with a slow recovery in FY25/26 back to planned levels in FY26/27.\n\nDividends and Share Buy-Back\n\nDividends are unchanged as per the dividend policy. Share buy-back is maintained.\n\nScenario B\n\nOur transformation and integration projects do not deliver the planned growth Risk (3) Transformation\n\nRisk (6) People Revenue Growth\n\nPlanned transformational revenue growth rates are assumed to halve over the life of the plan.\n\nCosts\n\nCosts, linked to transformational revenue growth are assumed to increase by 5% p.a. above planned levels to achieve transformational execution and cover retention issues or unforeseen skills gaps.\n\nDividends and Share Buy-Back\n\nDividends are unchanged as per the dividend policy. Share buy-back is maintained.\n\nScenario C\n\nA one-off event, such as a legal, regulatory, cyber security or a significant credit loss event\n\nRisk (5) Regulatory and legal (grouping all the one-off hits together)\n\nRisk (7) Cyber security,\n\nRisk (8) Business interruption\n\nRisk (9) Credit and liquidity/Treasury Management\n\nRevenue\n\nNo impact is assumed as PayPoint would adjust to change or correct any breach so that level of business could continue\n\nCosts\n\nIt is assumed that an average of all possible maximum fines, £26.9m, is incurred in FY24/25 but no other associated costs together with a credit risk of £12.1m totalling £39m.\n\nDividends and Share Buy-Back\n\nNo interim dividend would be paid in FY26, the year impacted. Otherwise, dividends are unchanged as per the dividend policy. Share buy-back is maintained. Scenario D\n\nTwo reverse stress tests scenario were undertaken\n\nThe first: adopting the principles of Scenarios A and B where a continuously monthly impact has been modelled to understand when our funding limits would be breached.\n\nThe second: adopting the principles of Scenario C to determine the quantum of a one-off impact to breach covenants or exceed funding availability.\n\nRisk (1) Competition and markets,\n\nRisk (2) Emerging technology,\n\nRisk (3) Transformation\n\nRisk (4) Operating model\n\nRisk (6) People\n\nRisk (10) Operational delivery\n\nFor the first scenario, no dividends paid across the three years, other than the final dividend in respect of FY24. The share-buyback is assumed to continue.\n\nFor the second scenario, In this reverse stress test, it is assumed no dividends are paid in the year of the event and therefore from a cash perspective, we save c£13m in FY26 and FY27.\n\nFor both tests, the share buyback is assumed and therefore remains a management ‘lever’.\n\nConsolidated statement of profit or loss\n\nNote Year ended\n\n31 March 2024\n\n£’000\n\nYear ended\n\n31 March 2023\n\n£’000 Revenue 2,3 277,816 165,220 Other revenue 2,3 28,551 2,503 Total revenue 306,367 167,723 Cost of revenue (158,964) (64,257) Gross profit 147,403 103,466 Administrative expenses -

The Company’s ordinary shares are traded on the London Stock Exchange. The Group and Company financial statements have been prepared in accordance with UK-adopted International Accounting Standards (“UK-adopted IFRS”) and with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006 as applicable to companies reporting under those standards.\n\nThe financial information for the year ended 31 March 2024 set out in this document does not constitute the Group’s financial statements for that financial year but is derived from those financial statements. Those financial statements have been reported on by the Group’s auditor, PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, and will be delivered to the Registrar of Companies in due course. The report of the auditor (i) was unqualified, (ii) did not include a reference to any matters to which the auditor drew attention by way of emphasis without qualifying their report and (iii) did not contain a statement under section 498 (2) or (3) of the Companies Act 2006.\n\nThese financial statements are presented in Pounds Sterling rounded to thousands (£’000). The Pound Sterling is the currency of the primary economic environment in which the Group operates.\n\nAdoption of standards and policies\n\nThe accounting policies adopted by the Group in the financial statements for the year ended 31 March 2024 have been applied consistently to all periods set out in these group financial statements.\n\nRestatement of comparative figures in the Consolidated statement of cash flows, and the related note, for the recognition of acquired cash and cash equivalents in Appreciate Group PLC\n\nOn 28 February 2023 the Group acquired Appreciate Group PLC for consideration of £79,181,000, comprising cash of £61,925,000 plus equity of £17,256,000. In its Consolidated statement of cash flows for the year ended 31 March 2023, the Group reported a net cash and cash equivalent outflow of £(45,580,000) for Acquisitions of subsidiaries net of cash acquired. This figure was the net of the cash outflow of the £61,925,000 referred to above less £16,345,000 corporate cash and bank overdraft acquired from Appreciate.\n\nThe acquired cash and cash equivalents should also have included £64,960,000 of Appreciate’s non-corporate cash and cash equivalents, comprising Gift card voucher cash and Prepay savers’ cash. The total cash and cash equivalents acquired should therefore have been £81,305,000, and the Acquisitions of subsidiaries net of cash acquired a net inflow of £19,380,000, rather than a net outflow of £(45,580,000). The Movement in clients’ funds, retailer partners’ deposits and card and voucher deposits in the prior year note to the Consolidated statement of cash flows should have excluded the £64,960,000 of acquired non-corporate cash and cash equivalents and should therefore have been reported as an outflow of £(25,701,000) rather than an inflow of £39,259,000.\n\nThe restatement of the comparative figures in the Group’s Consolidated statement of cash flows and the related note reduces Cash generated from operations by £64,960,000. It has no impact on the Group’s opening cash and cash equivalents, net assets or retained earnings.\n\nThe re-presentation of the comparative figures in the Group Consolidated statement of cash flows and the related note, arising from the changes explained below to the treatment of the movements in Restricted funds held on deposit (non-corporate) and in Payables – non-corporate, increases Cash generated from operations by £25,701,000. The net impact of the restatement and the re-presentation is therefore a reduction of £39,259,000, from the inflow of £102,182,000 reported in the prior year financial statements, to the inflow of £62,923,000 reported as the comparative figure in the current year financial statements.\n\nRe-presentation of comparative figures\n\nConsolidated statement of financial position\n\nIn its financial statements for the year ended 31 March 2023, the Group classified its revolving credit facility as a current liability. The Group reclassified the liability to non-current as at 31 March 2024, having adopted early the International Accounting Standard Board’s Non-current Liabilities with Covenants, which amended IAS 1 Presentation of Financial Statements.\n\nConsolidated statement of cash flows and Note to consolidated statement of cash flows\n\nIn its financial statements for the year ended 31 March 2023, the Group did not show separately Movement in Restricted funds held on deposit (non-corporate) and in Movement in payables – non-corporate. Their inclusion in the current year improves the year-on-year comparability of Cash generated from operations by excluding movements in Cash and cash equivalents – non-corporate and in Restricted funds held on deposit (non-corporate).\n\nGoing concern\n\nThe financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis. The Group manages its capital to ensure that entities in the Group will be able to continue as a going concern while maximising the return to shareholders through the optimisation of the debt-to-equity balance. The capital structure of the Group consists of debt, cash and cash equivalents, restricted funds held on deposit and equity attributable to equity holders of the parent company comprising capital, reserves and retained earnings.\n\nThe Group’s policy is to borrow centrally to meet anticipated funding requirements. Our cash and borrowing capacity provides sufficient funds to meet the foreseeable needs of the Group. At 31 March 2024, the Group had corporate cash of £26.4 million.\n\nThe Group carried out a refinancing, completed on 6 June 2024, following which its borrowing facilities consist of:\n\na £45.0 million non-amortising term loan expiring in June 2028\n\na £90.0 million unsecured revolving credit facility expiring in June 2028; and\n\na £30.0 million accordion facility (uncommitted) expiring in June 2028 with an option, subject to lender approval, to extend by a further year.\n\nAt 31 March 2024, £57.5 million (2023: £46.5 million) was drawn down from the previous £90.0 million revolving credit facility and the outstanding balance of the previous amortising term loan was £36.0 million.\n\nThe Group has a strengthened statement of financial position, with net assets of £121.2 million as at 31 March 2024 (£111.7 million as at 31 March 2023), having made a profit for the year of £35.7 million (2023: £34.7 million) and generated cash from operations of £65.7 million for the year then ended (2023: £62.9 million). The Group had net current liabilities of £4.4 million (2023: £16.8 million).\n\nThe Directors have prepared cash flow forecast scenarios for a period of 3 years from the date of approval of these financial statements, which take into account the Group’s current financial and trading position, the principal risks and uncertainties and the strategic plans that are reviewed at least annually by the Board. In this ‘base case’ scenario, the cash flow forecasts show considerable liquidity headroom and debt covenants will be met throughout the period.\n\nAdditionally, the Directors have carried out an assessment of the principal risks and uncertainties and applied severe but plausible scenarios to test further the Group going concern assumption. These scenarios included a reduction in the volume of transactions caused by a severe economic downturn, transformation and growth plans not delivering intended benefits and material one-off impacts of regulatory, IT or credit loss events. As mitigating actions, we have assumed achievable reductions in expenditure and a reduction in the level of future dividends following the payment of the final dividend of 19.2 pence per share declared in respect of the financial year ended 31 March 2024. The cash flow forecasts included an analysis and stress test for the above scenarios to ensure working capital movements within a reporting period do not trigger a covenant breach.\n\nBased on this assessment, the Directors confirm that they have a reasonable expectation that the Group will be able to continue in operation and meet its liabilities as they fall due over the period of not less than 12 months from the date of approval of these financial statements and therefore have prepared the financial statements on a going concern basis.\n\nUse of judgements and estimates\n\nIn the application of the Group’s accounting policies, the Directors are required to make judgements, estimates and assumptions about the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. The estimates and associated assumptions are based on historical experience and other factors that are considered relevant. Actual results may differ from these estimates.\n\nEstimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Revisions to accounting estimates are recognised in the period in which the estimate is revised if the revision affects only that period, or in the period of the revision and future periods if the revision affects both current and future periods.\n\nCritical judgement: recognition of cash and cash equivalents and restricted funds held on deposit\n\nThe nature of payments and banking services means that PayPoint collects and holds funds on behalf of clients as those funds pass through the settlement process and retains retailer partners’ deposits as security for those collections. Following the Appreciate acquisition, it also holds, in trust, gift card voucher deposits on behalf of agents, cardholders and redeemers and prepay savers’ cash on behalf of savers.\n\nA critical judgement in this area is whether each of the above categories of funds, and restricted funds held on deposit, are recognised on the consolidated statement of financial position, and whether they are included in cash and cash equivalents for the purpose of the Statement of consolidated cash flows. This includes evaluating:\n\n(a) the existence of a binding agreement, such as a legal trust, clearly identifying the beneficiary of the funds;\n\n(b) the identification of funds, ability to allocate and separability of funds;\n\n(c) the identification of the holder of those funds at any point in time;\n\n(d) whether the Group bears the credit risk.\n\nWhere there is a binding agreement specifying that PayPoint holds funds on behalf of the client (i.e. acting in the capacity of a trustee) and those funds have been separately identified as belonging to that beneficiary, the cash (referred to as ‘Clients’ own funds’) and the related liability are not included on the consolidated statement of financial position.\n\nIn all other cases, the Group has access to the interest on such monies and can, having met certain conditions, withdraw the funds. The cash and corresponding liability are therefore recognised on the consolidated statement of financial position. Corporate cash and cash equivalents consists of cash freely available to the Group for use in its daily operations and is presented as a separate line item on the consolidated statement of financial position from non-corporate cash and cash equivalents, which is not freely available to the Group, either because of self-regulation and segregation or due to contractual or regulatory requirements. Non-corporate cash and cash equivalents comprises:\n\nClients’ cash – cash collected on behalf of clients from retailer partners but not yet transferred to clients. Clients’ cash is held in PayPoint’s bank accounts\n\nGift card voucher cash – cash collected on the issue of gift card vouchers which have not yet expired or been redeemed\n\nPrepay savers’ cash - cash received from customers under a prepayment scheme accumulating towards their se"
