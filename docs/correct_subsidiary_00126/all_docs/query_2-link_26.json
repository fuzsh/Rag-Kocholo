        "text": "The U.S. Marshals Service provides for the security, health and safety of government witnesses, and their immediate dependents, whose lives are in danger as a result of their testimony against drug traffickers, terrorists, organized crime members and other major criminals.\n\nThe Witness Security Program was authorized by the Organized Crime Control Act of 1970 and amended by the Comprehensive Crime Control Act of 1984. The U.S. Marshals Service has protected, relocated, and given new identities to more than 19,000 witnesses and their family members, since the program began in 1971.\n\nThe successful operation of this program is widely recognized as providing a unique and valuable tool in the government's battle against organized crime and terrorism.\n\nWitnesses and their families typically get new identities and funding for basic living expenses and medical care. Job training and employment assistance may also be provided.\n\nThe U.S. Marshals Service provides 24-hour protection to all witnesses, while they are in a high-threat environment including pretrial conferences, trial testimonials, and other court appearances.\n\nNo Witness Security Program participant, following program guidelines, has been harmed or killed while under the active protection of the U.S. Marshals Service."
