Webb and Vary Company 1922\n\nDEDICATION To the Boy Scouts and the Girl Scouts of Rome and Floyd County, whose youthful enthusiasm and helpful, un selfish spirit of service promise so much for the development of civic enter prise and the advancement of in terest in the wholesome life of the Great Outdoors, this book is affec\n\ntionately dedi cated by\n\nTHE AUTHOR.\n\nIntroduction\n\nOAV AND THEN a queen pawns her jewels to advance the cause of civilization, and thus gives back part of what her admiring- subjects have offered up. Similarly has a queen who wears no tiara or crown thrown herself into the breach and made possible the completion at this time of the History of Rome. Her rocking- chair is \"in soak\" because she believes the enterprise is worth while. If we will redeem the chair\n\nout of sales from the book, she will feel amply repaid, and can. sit down again. It will be possible through a little unselfish sacrifice on the part of each and all of us.\n\nOne thousand copies of the book are included in the first binding. More than half of these have been mailed to subscribers who spoke for them in advance. Additional sheets have been printed so that other Romans may have copies who desire them. Kxtra copies will be bound in. accordance with the demand, so that the total issue will be just what Romans, former Romans and a select company of \"innocent bystanders\" make it. The compiler hopes that many will avail themselves of the opportunity to invest, for the double reason that the book contains a wealth of material which everybody should have, and a subscription does just that much to advance the interests of the town and section. He does not urge any support in the expectation of making\" a profit, for he lias put far more into it these two years than he can possibly get out, except in mental satisfaction. He wishes to sell the book not on personal or sentimental grounds, but on the basis of whatever value the purchaser may see in it. No doubt the edition will be quickly exhausted, because material has been included which is expected to stimulate a heavy demand outside of Rome. Then there will be 110 more copies, for the number is strictly limited.\n\nThe excuse for this work was found in the fact that the historians have systematically neglected the section known of old as \"Cherokee Georgia.\" The compiler \"went back to his birthplace Oct. 21, 1920, to supply whatever of the deficiency he could, realizing that he had had no previous historical experience, but believing' that the subject was worthy of a literary masterpiece. He found a fertile field in which to labor; the legend of DeSoto's visit in 1540,._.the Indian occupation and removal, the deeds of valor in war, the constructive enterprises following the war's wake,, all supplied an inspiration that was irresistible. On begin ning his work, he saw the truth of the statement, \"The South makes plenty of history, but writes very little of it.\" His task, therefore, con sisted in laying- a foundation as well as erecting- a superstructure, and he realizes the imperfections that such conditions necessarily impose, and is fully conscious of his inability to handle the material as it deserves. He only hopes that the work may be considered from cover to cover, and thus criticized, rather than that any insignificant error of omission or commission may be allowed to obscure the \"whole in the estimation of the individual.\n\nIt is manifestly impossible here to devote much attention to the entire Northwest Georgia section. Floy el's sister counties AVI 11 no doubt eventually write histories of their own. However, there are numerous references to happenings elsewhere which are connected with characters\n\nIX.\n\nor events in Floyd, and in certain instances the material is quite general in its character and application.\n\nSince the greater part of Rome's history existed in tradition and in scrap books and old records, it has been deemed advisable to go back as far as possible, and rescue the fragments of early Rome before the}r are lost in the dust of the past. The story of Rome's part in the removal of the Indians has never been adequately told, nor has the picture of con ditions just before the Civil War been fully presented. The subject of Rome's part in the war of 1861-5 is all but ignored. The duty is man ifestly to revert to the dim beginning's, to give \"right-of-way\" to the \"old settlers,\" to suggest that the present generation keep newspapers and records liberally so our contemporary history may not suffer likewise.\n\nSo much material has been developed that the necessity, of a second volume is apparent. Volume I contains half of the complete narrative, a great many pictures and a vast amount of miscellaneous data. Its faulty arrang-emeiit is due to the uncertainty, up to the last moment, ovefwhat was to_be used. Volume II, which it is intended should be pub lished when conditions are more favorable, \\vill contain many additional pictures and such biographical sketches and miscellaneous items as could not be included in the first. These two volumes will in a measure tell the romantic tale.\n\nThe history started with a series of articles in the Rome News, fol lowed by \"Rambles Around. Rome.\" It has been augmented from many sources, and particularly from the files of the old Rome Courier, which\" was the forerunner of Rome's daily newspaper,. The Tribune-Herald. Both of these present-day newspapers have been, unflagging friends of the history. In the collection, of material, chiefly of a statistical nature, the most consistent individual has been Richard Venable Mitchell, of Rome. Mr. Mitchell, has worked with splendid spirit and \"without hope of reward ; Romans are certain to appreciate the accurate data he gives, them in his lists of the natural resources of Floyd, and of the state, city and county officials, various important and interesting dates and a vast quantity of odd information. Mrs. Harriet Connor Stevcns has contributed liberally of her time in order that some of the Cave Spring1 pioneers rnig-ht be remembered. Miss Frances Long' Harper has also helped substantially at Cave Spring\". In forcing\" the history upon public attention, the most valiant supporters have been H. H. Shackelton, presi dent of the Chamber of Commerce ; Robt. H. Clagett, editor of the Rome News ; W. S. Rowell, editor of the Tribune-Herald, and Lee J. Langley, writing1 for both papers.\n\nThanks are due Hooper Alexander, of Atlanta ; W. R. L. Smith, of Norfolk. Va. ; Mrs. Mabel Washbotirne Andersen, of Pryor, Okla. ; S. W. Ross, of Tahlequah, Okla.; Judge Henry C. Mcigs, of Ft. Gibson, Okla., and C. F. Haiike, chief clerk of the Indian Office, Washing-ton, D. C., for much of the Indian data. (The biographies of the Indian leaders are omitted for further investigation of conflicting- material). Substan tial assistance has been given by Miss Tommie Dora Barker, librarian of the Carnegie Library, Atlanta, and by Miss Carrie Williams, of the ref erence department ; Mrs. Maud Barker Cobb, state librarian, the Capitol, Atlanta ; Duncan. Burnett, librarian of the library of the University of Georgia, Athens; Dr. Lucian L. Knight, director of the State De partment of History, the Capitol, Atlanta, and Miss Ruth Blair, of the same department. Dr. Knight's valuable books have been consulted freely and credit generally given in each instance. Appreciation is like-\n\nwise expressed herewith of aid rendered by the Daugiiters of the Ameri can Revolution and the United Daughters of the Confederacy, and of the interest shown by Hendersoii L. Lanham, president of the Board of Education of the City of Rome, by Prof. B. F. Quigg, City Superintendent, and Prof. W. C. Rash, County Superintendent, in a plan for teaching- local history in the public schools. While nothing- definite has been done, the suggestion that a condensed school history be written out of the His tory of Rome is being- considered, and already has the moral support of at least one larg-e Eastern publishing house.\n\nMost of the maps are from Rand-McNally & Co., Chicago.\n\nThe artistic pictures of the Berry Schools were taken by D. W. Densmore, faculty member, and a number of pictures of landmarks by R. V. Mitchell. Several pictures and some text do not appear because they have been lost or misplaced; a few typographical errors herein like wise prove the intensely human character of the work of man.\n\nLoans negotiated through the assistance of John M. Graham and Wilson M. Hardy greatly helped the work at the outset, and $100 received near the close from a group of Rome business men, headed by H. R. Fishburne, averted an almost certain postponement. Mr. Walter D. Carr, of Silver, Burdett & Co., Boston publishers, loaned the cuts of John Ridge and Major Ridge. To all others who have helped with friendly advice, data or money the heartfelt thanks of the compiler are herewith given. Rome will thank them in her own way. The list is a long one, and it cannot be extended here ; it will appear, perhaps, in the proposed Vol. II.\n\nThere is a g-reat deal that is left over for another volume simply because no funds were in sight to print it. Ample -warning of this situa tion was given from time to time. If Romans make Vol. II possible by an under-writing plan, or if ^i single Roman desires the opportunity of doing that much for the town he loves, the compiler will dig\" into his files again. Undoubtedly some Roman who wishes a send-off here below and a welcome above will remember Vol. II in his will.\n\nThe rules governing the history campaign were very simple. Prac tically everybody who showed as much as a passing interest has been given some notice in the book, either for themselves or their ancestors. Those who have ignored letters, personal or circular, or both, or have refused to \"weep\" while we \"mourned,\" have erected a temporary barrier between us. Fortunately, there have not been many of these, although more have sat on the fence. They will have another chance if thev want it--for Vol. II. No considerations of friendship have caused us to over look a flagrant neglect of Rome and the history by those who in our opin ion could have helped. At the same time, we feel friendly and hold the door open--for Vol. II. \"We consider it a duty to speak plainly so Romans will understand, and that we may do better next time. Let us make Vol. II surpass Vol. I.\n\nThe original plan called for sections of text devoted to the Berry Schools, Shorter College, Hearn Academy, the Georgia School for the Deaf at Cave Spring, and the Floyd County and Rome public schools. Failure of the leading institutions in this group to pay a cost price for the printing (due largely to the general economic conditions) has put these sections over for further consideration.\n\nA few words about quoted articles. Most of the items with dates from 1920-22 affixed are from The Rome News, prior to that, after 1886, from The Tribune of Rome or The Tribune-Herald, and from 1850 to 1887\n\nfrom The Rome Tri-\\Veekly Courier or \\Veekly Courier. An understand ing of this scheme, it is believed, will assist the reader.\n\nIt is hoped that the history will please the subscribers as well as prove of some use to them as a work of reference. A reading glass for aged eyes is recommended where type and pictures are small. In practically all cases the biographies have been submitted to the families for correc tion and approval. A committee of Romans has kindly gone over most of the other data. Anecdotes are told--on our own clan, too--which we hope will be received in good part, for there is 110 intention, to offend anyone. Romans are noted for speaking the truth fearlessly, and since we are all in one big' family and arc blessed with a sense of humor, we can well afford to perpetuate the stories of our members for fireside en joyment. A colorless story of Rome would be of no g'ood and would find few willing\" consumers.\n\n\\Vith this much said by way of introduction, we salute our sub scribers and friends, wish them a merry Christmas and a happy New Year, and unreservedly place our literary fate in their tender hands.\n\n81 W. 14th St., Atlanta, Ga.,\n\nFriday, Dec. 1, 1922.\n\nGEO. M. BATTEY, JR.\n\nP. S. -- Since the above was written, the decision -was reached to include in Vol. I. no biographical sketches. It was believed best to hold over for considera tion for Vol. II. all the 300 sketches rather than to print only a few to the ex clusion of the many. A little extra financial support would have made possible\n\nthe inclusion of all. Since it was not forthcoming, it seemed best to file this other valuable material. The recent vote by mail, by the way, was overwhelmingly in favor of holding the biographies for another time. The several persons -who advanced money for sketches will be reimbursed or given extra copies of the\n\npresent volume, as they prefer. W,e assure them and all others that we regret our inability to use this excellent data, -which can only be improved -with age.\n\nWe -will keep it intact in the confident hope that Romans will make its publication possible at some day in the near future.\n\nG.

The waters of this re gion, leaping- through the moun tain gorges in slender, silken streams, purled their way into the valleys and found outlets in the Atlantic Ocean or Gulf of Mexico. They -were alive with fish, especial ly the upland streams with trout, and it used to be said that had the\n\nIndian possessed a hat, in many places he could have scooped up a hatful at a time.\n\nLarge black bears -went grubbing' over the mountain tops in search of worms and roots, occasionally shambling- into the fertile valleys below; hungry -wolves leaped free ly through the forest trails; deer penetrated the thickets and slaked their thirst at the sparkling brooks ; panthers arid wildcats slunk se renely from feeding ground to cavernous lair; snakes of huge size and great number infested the rocky fastnesses, the sun-baked river banks and the grassy plains ; wild turkeys clucked along the leafy bowers and smaller birds of beautiful plumage dotted the trees of hillside, valley and swamp.\n\nUpon this primitive stage at some uncertain date had appeared the Indian, successor to the illfated Mound Builder of North America. Agile, bloodthirsty and possessing a keen appetite, the In\n\ndian pursued by foot and in his swift canoe, with his trusty bow and arrow, the animals, birds and snakes, killed them and ate the flesh, sometimes cooked, some times raw, and made the skins into rug-s, wig'warn covers, robes, pa poose bags and numerous orna ments for his person. The Indian painted bis face and, bis body with a mixture of oil and clay, dressed himself in a wampum belt from which depended a wildcat skin or kilt of limber grass or hair, and with a headdress of feathers which hung down to his waist he joined in the big tribal hunts or fared forth to fight enemy tribesmen. The Indian women, or squaws, did the routine work about the hut or wigwam settlements, took care of the children and strung beads and wove various materials into bas kets, rugs and articles of clothing, ;md cultivated small patches of grain.\n\nFrom the time \"when Christopher Columbus discovered America in 1492 and took possession in the name of the King and the Queen of Spain, the Indian was forced to count 011 the paleface as a po tential foe who needed his hunt ing grounds and his towns for col onization purposes. The Spanish are regarded as the pioneer ex plorers of America through their expeditions to Florida, the L,and of Flowers, which embraced vastly more territory than the State of Florida of the present day. Juan Ponce DeL/eoii explored the coast of the Florida Peninsula in 1513, penetrated into the interior in search of the Fountain of Perpet\n\nual Youth, engaged the savages and was killed with a poisoned ar row. Followed the cruel Narvaez to the west coast of the peninsula,\n\n18\n\nA HISTORY OF ROMK AND KLOYD COUNTY\n\nwhere be set an example for the savages by loosing\" bloodhounds on the ae^cd mother of an Indian chief, which tore her to pieces; then he cut off the chief's nose and sent him to Cuba as a slave. The Indiaris avenged this atrocity by driving Narvaez to his ships ; a storm hit the vessels and Narvaez and all 1)ii t four of his men were lost.\n\nNext in importance was TTernanoo (Ferdinand) DeSoto, who in his search of the Chiahaii Kldorado in the hope of filling the treasure chest cjf the King- 01 Spain is supposed to have spent nearly 30 days on the present site of Rome.\n\nDeSoto had fought successfully in the Spanish wars of conquest in Central America and Peru, when called bv the king- to cut a path through\" Florida, to work the gold mines arid the pearl fisheries which earlier explorers had assured the king existed. Having- recently married Dona Isabel * de Bobadilla, member of the Spanish royal family and his social equal\", whose father was his superior in wealth if not in manhood, DeSoto set sail from Spain on April 8, 1538, taking- with him his wife, 600 soldiers. 200 horses and a herd of swine for food. DeSoto's \"noble Six Hundred\" carried arquebuses, matchlocks, one cannon and a falconet\n\n(small cannon in general use at that time). They had plenty of ammunition, and led by tethers a pack of fierce bloodhounds. I'leiity of iron chains, collars and wristlets were carried to put upon Indian prisoners. Swine and cattle furnished a large part of the food. while pack mules bore the provisions. The personnel was made up of mechanics, builders and smiths monks, laymen and Catholic priests in robes. \"Quite a number of the fighters wore light armor which readilv shed the sharp darts of the red-skins. They landed at Havana.\n\nCuba, but after a Short Stay pro-\n\nays an return to her settement. DeSoto pressed northward in\n\nforced marches to relieve his weary and starving horses and men, and to seize or unearth gold for the king.\n\nTHK SPANISH CAVALIERS AND THEIR QUEST FOR GOLD\n\n19\n\nWhile accounts differ as to the route DeSoto took through North Georgia, the authorities generally agree that after leaving\" Cutifachi-qtri, DeSoto went to the site of Yonah Mountain, in Nac.hooeh.ee Valley, White County, where he mined a while and the Indians gave his troops manv dogs to eat ; also that he crossed the North Georgia mountains to the Connasauga Riv er, thence followed the Oostanaula River to the junction of the litowah River, where the Coos a forms, to Chiaha province and town, the modern site of Rome ; also that he followed the Coosa southwestward into Alabama, whence in time he pushed on across West Term.esssee and discovered the Mississippi Riv er, in which he was buried after dying oi fev er in 1541.\n\nIt is possible to mention these differences of opinion only in brief here. James Mooney, a careful stu dent of the subject, held that De Soto followed the Chattahooch.ee River headwaters clown the val leys of Habersham County, sight ed Kennesaw (Kensagi) Moun tain in Cobb County, instead of the Connasauga River, (passing near the site of modern Atlanta), and instead of visiting Chiaha, visited Chehaw, a Creek town in Alabama below Columbus. It may be signifi cant that Atlantans do not claim that DeSoto passed near their land.\n\nAn understanding\" of the topog raphy of the country, the aims and necessities of the expedition and the reasonable probabilities are prerequisites to a r ecoiieiliatioii of the viewpoints. Some aid may be found in the reflection that DeSoto often divided his force; undoubt edly he let the main body follow the rivers in the valleys, while prospecting parties penetrated through the mountains. Thus it is possible that his main force, with the h e a vy e qti i p m e n t a n d pigs, started down the headwaters of\n\nthe Chattalioochee in Habersham County, bore to the northwest, crossed the headwaters of the Ktowah and followed the Rtowah to Rome, discovering and exploringthe Vmg'e ] nclian mound on the Tumhn place three miles south of Cartersville; also that the mining group, after exploring the moun tains nearly to the Tennessee line, came to the Connasauga River and followed the Oostanaula River down to Rome, where he joined the other unit. Chiaha Town was described by the early chroniclers of the expedition as an island. That impression might easily be made on an explorer,crossing the creeks north of Rome whose headwaters nearly touch, and passing on down the peninsula to the water on all sides.\n\nIt is quite possible, moreover, that 382 years ago a canal con nected the Oostanaula and Ktowah rivers, passing- through North Rome arid making an island of the narrow neck of land between\n\nFERDINAND DeSOTO, Spai it is senerally accepted %' Rome in 1540, searching: for : aid for his king.\n\n20\n\nA HISTORY OF ROME AND KLOYD COUNTY\n\nthe streams at their junction. An other theory is that the DeSoto\n\ndistrict (now better known as the l^ourth ward), which is supposed to have been where the Spanish camp ed, was once an island, having- been cut off by a break in the Oosta naula near the mouth of Little Dry Creek, which found its way throug'h the lowlands and entered the Coosa above florseleg- Creek, forming- a body of land of not less than 250 acres.\n\nBoth of these suppositions find encouragement in freaks of nature which are observable in the hfetime of the average man. Less than a decade ago Perkiris Island, in the Ktowah River, near the foot of Fifth Avenue, was yielding- sand to a concern which for many vears\n\nhad sold to contractors -who were erecting\" the most substantial build ings in \".Rome. Tn 1920 suit was tiled in the Superior Court of Flo3rd county- by the Pcrkins heirs against Mrs. 7- Lmclsay Johnson to prevent her from removing\" the sand. Airs. Johnson's answer recited that the island had stood opposite her Kast Rome farm, separated from the mainland by a narrow body of wa ter. Accretions of sand and silt had filled up this channel and made the island part of the mainland; there fore, as she claimed, the 1 ormer island belonged to her.\n\nAnother island which has be come part of the mainland in like manner was at Nixon's sand bar, Coosa \"River, just below and across from the mouth of Horseleg Creek. There a re no examples as con spicuous as these in which new islands have been formed, but ex amples are common elsewhere, notably in the Mississippi \"Valley.\n\nCertain historians who do not believe DeSoto camped at the pres ent site of Rome locate the island down the Coosa in Alabama, near the Georgia line. However, Pickett, Jones, Ktiig-ht and others hold\n\nthat Chiaha settlement and the present site of Rome are identical, and that the route proceeded down the Coosa. it is worthy of note that DeSoto resisted the suppli cations of his me 11 to turn back toward his ships and l\\rst landing place, and insisted on striking re peatedly north-ward in search of gold. Althoug-h he followed a zig zag course, his trail was g-enerally northwestward, allowing\" for a con siderable zag\" toward Mobile, where he won a great battle with the Indians. At Chiaha he dispatched two cavaliers on a ten-day journey northward. There appears to have been no point in his going* below Columbus, where in July it is much hotter than the North Georgia mountains.\n\nThe Indians all along' the route had told DeSoto of the rich prov ince of Chiaha, the Kl dorado of his dreams. To the principal towns of this p r o v 111 c e De Soto had sent scouts to de mand of the. chiefs a two months' supply of maize (Indian corn). On June 4, 1540, DeSoto entered Chia ha Town via the valleys of the west bank of the Oostanaula Riv er, camped his cohorts along- what has for many years been known as the DeSoto Road of the DeSoto District of Floyd County, and crossed the Oostanaula River (probably in canoes) with his ad vance guard. Here he was warm!}' received bv the young\" chief, who spake substantially as follows as he handed DeSoto a long* string- of perfect pearls :*\n\nMighty Chief: Into this beautiful and beloved country which our fathers have hunted for the beasts and birds of the forest and handed down to us a long1 time ago, and in which -we wor ship the Spirit of the Sun with all the strength of our natures, we welcome you as friends and brothers. Stay\n\nTHK SPANISH CAVALIERS AND THEIR QUEST FOR GOLD\n\n21\n\nwith us as long- as you desire; live in our houses, fish and hunt 'with us in our choice places, and accept our gifts offered you from our hearts. Tell us at once your mission, that we may serve you with the fidelity of the stars. You have asked of my g-ood people supply of maize to sustain your power ful tribe two months. Here you will find 20 barbacoas (barns) burstingwith our best grain. Welcome! May your people and my people enj oy a peaceful friendship that will be as strong1 as the mountains and last as long as the sun shines -warm and the rivez-s of Ghiaha run cold.\n\nThrough an interpreter DeSoto\n\nthanked the chief cordially, then\n\ngave to him some trinkets and\n\ncoins.\n\n\"Chocklestce !--Sit down !\" in\n\nvited the chief, and turning* to a\n\ngroup Of copper-colored warriors,\n\nhe said: \"Talahi--chetawga--clnsqua !\" The men ran to a picketed enclosure and brought many fowls and clog's for the hungry Spaniards to eat, after which the young: chief announced that IDeSoto would stop at \"akwenasa\" (my home).\n\nDeSoto is supposed to have spent 26-30 days in Chiaha, after which he went through Alabama and Western Tennessee and discovered the Mississippi .River at Chic/kasaw Bluff, below Memphis. Pie died shortly after and was buried in the Mississippi to prevent the In dians from destroying' his corpse. His wife died in Cuba of a broken heart, following* her husband short ly. She had had no word from him since his departure-\n\nCHAPTER II. John Sevier, John Floyd and the Indians\n\nN SEPTEMBER, 1793, an event was catalog-tied in which the site of Rome was brought to the attention of\n\nthe country. Gen. John Sevier* de scended upon Cherokce Georg'ia from Tennessee, chasing' with his SOO men 1,000 Indiana who had scalped and killed thirteen people at Cave It's Station, near Kiioxville. and had retreated southward. Gen. Sevier swept out of his path such resistance as was offered, and burned a number of Indian towns. Presently he arrived at Oostanaula, near the forks of the Coosawattee and Connasauga rivers, and after burning- this village, divided his force. With half he proceeded down the Oostanaula, while Col onel Kelly and Major Evans were detailed to take the other half down the Ktowah river, and to de stroy such towns as they found. On Oct. 17, 1793, the Battle of Kto wah was fought.\n\nThe Kelly-Evans force discov ered the main body of the fleeing; Indians at a rocky bluff across the Etovrah. Sonic say this was where the Southern Railway now crosses the river, about a mile above Rome* while others hold it was quite a distance farther clown the stream. The Indians had felled numerous trees and behind these had sought protection, while a few hid in the rocky fissures of the bluff. Many others had been strung- out clown the river bank to protect a ford. A clever ruse dislodg-ed the In dians and broug'ht about their de feat. The two officers took then force below the crossing point. Col onel Kelly and several others plunged their horses in and swam across. Thinking- the -whole force was coming- into the water and hoping- to shoot them with ar\n\nrows and guns before the}r could g-ct out, part of the Indians left their protection and bore down upon the Colonel and his squad, who quickly dashed back into the Etowah. In the meantime, Capt. Evans had back-tracked his force to the ford, and there crossing, fell heavily upon the surprised foe, and put them to flight with a heavy loss. For many years later Indian bones and relics could be found in the crevasses of the hill.\n\nSuch of the Indians as escaped swam \"the river at Myrtle Hill cemetery, and made a stand at the western foot of it. Gen. Sevier hav ing come up with his force, the frontiersmen inflicted terrible slaughter upon the red-skiiis, and drove them in contusion clown the Coosa Valley. Sevier is also said to have destroyed Coosa Old Town at this time. This was a village which has been located by certain people on the Nixon farm and by others below it on the Coosa River.\n\nIt so happened that most of these Tennessee \"squirrel hunters\" were volunteers who had had a friend or relative killed at Cavctt's Station, ;nd among\" them we find a youth of tender years named Hugh L,awfton White. ** Historians relatethat in this engagement the young- pale face shot a minie ball into the breast of Chief King\" lusher, one of the leaders of the Indian horde, killing' him instantly and causing the Indian ranks to break in con-\n\nexploit at the\n\n**A kinsman of Dr. James Park, of Knoxville, and his descendants, including Mrs. B.

Senator\n\nand friend arid supporter of Presi\n\ndent Andrew Jackson, with many\n\nof the Jacksonian attributes. In\n\n1835 he was nominated for presi dent by the Whigs, and carried his\n\nown state over Martin Van Buren.\n\nthe Democratic nominee, by 10,000\n\nmajority. It was said that Jack\n\nson's support would have won for\n\njudge White, but it was captured\n\nby Van Buren.\n\nA more complete account of the\n\nBattle of Ktowah is found in the\n\nTennessee Historical Mag'aziiie\n\n(Nashville). 1918, Vol. TV, pages\n\n207-9-10:\n\nFinding the authorities powerless, the patience of the Cherokees gave way, and the latter part of August, 1793, provided unmistakable evidence of. iTidian hostility. The settlements were put in a posture of defense. Gen. Sevier was posted at Ish's station, across the river fi'om KnoxviYle, \"with 400 mounted infantry. . . . On the evening- of Sept. 24, John Watts, at the head of a large body of Indians, estimated at 1,000 men or more, com posed of Cherokees and Creeks, cross ed the Tennessee river below the mouth of Holston and inarched all night in the direction of Knoxville. They avoid ed Campbell's station, passed -within three miles of Ish's, and daylight found them in sight of Cavett's sta tion, eight miles west of Knoxville . . .\n\nCol. Watts had with him some of the most intractable chiefs of the na tion . . . The chiefs disputed whether they should kill everybody in Knoxville or only the men. Doublehead insisted on the former. An altercation be tween Doublehead and Vann was longend heated. Vann had a little boy, a captive, riding behind him. Doublehead became so infuriated that he killed the little boy. . . .\n\nIn sight of Cavett's station there was a block house in -which Alexander Cavett and family of thirteen people resided, only three of whom were gun men. The three made a brave resist ance. Alexander Cavett, the father, died with bullets in his mouth, which he had placed there to facilitate load ing. Five Indians fell dead of wound ed Before, their rifles. This checked\n\nthe assaults and brought on a parley. The Bench, Watts' nephew, who spoke Eng-lish, ag-reed with the besieged that if they surrendered, their lives should be spared, and they should be exchanged for a like number of In dian prisoners. These terms were ac cepted and the little gar risen sur rendered.\n\nAs soon as they left the blockhouse, -Doublehead and his party fell upon them and put them all to death in the most barbarous manner, except Alexander Cavett, Jr., who was saved by the interposition of Col. Watts, though he was afterwards killed in the Creek towns . . ,\n\nGen- Sevier being reinforced until his army numbered about 700, he marched rapidly southward until Oct. 14, 1793, when \"he reached the beloved town, of Kstaunaula. The town -was deserted, but since it contained abund ant provisions, Sevier halted and rest ed his men. The Indians undertook to disperse his camp at night, but the attack was unsuccessful. From some Cherokee prisoners taken at Estaunaula it was learned that the main body of the enemy, composed of Cher okees and Creeks, had passed the place a few days previously, and were mak-\n\njr of Ter of Indiansrfisher.\n\nA HISTORY OF ROME AND FLOYD COUNTY\n\ning for a town at the mouth of the Etowah river. After refreshing his troops, Gen. Sevier followed the enemy, reaching the confluence of the Etowah and the Oostanaula rivers on the evening of the 17th.\n\nThe Creeks and a number of Cherokees had intrenched themselves on opposite banks of the Etowah, to obstruct its passage. A happy mistake on the part of the guides, Carey and Findleston*, saved the day for the whites. They carried Col. Kelly's force half a mile below the ford, where he and a few others immediately swam the river. The Indians, discovering this movement, abandoned their intrenchments and rushed down the river to oppose Col. Kelly. Capt. Evans, discovering the error, wheeled, and straining his horses back to the ford, dashed into the river. The Indians at the ford, under the command of King Fisher, a Cherokee chief of the first consequence, saw their mistake, and, returning, received Capt. Evans' company furiously at the crossing of the bank.\n\nThe engagement was hot and spirited. The King Fisher made a daring sally within a few yards of H. L. White, afterwards the distinguished jurist and statesman. He and some of his comrades discharged their rifles, the King Fisher fell and his warriors abandoned the field. The whites lost three men in the engagement. This campaign ended the war and closed the military careers of Col. Watts and Gen. Sevier.\n\nGen Sevier's official report of the battle follows:**\n\nIsh s Mills, Tenn., 25 Oct., 1793. Sir:\n\nIn obedience to an order from Secretary Smith, I marched in pursuit of\n\nthe large body of Indians who on the 25th of last month did the mischief in Knox County, Grassy Valley. . . .\n\nWe directed our march for Estanaula*** on the Coosa**** river, at which place we arrived on the 14th instant. . . . We there made some Cherokee prisoners, who informed us that John Watts headed the army lately out on our frontiers; that the same was composed of Indians more or less from every town in the Cherokee na-\n\ntion; that from the Turkey's Town,\n\nSallyquoah, Coosawaytah and several\n\nOther principal Ones almost to a man\n\nwas out, joined by a large number of the upper Creeks, who had passed that\n\nplace on their return only a few days since, and had made for a town at the mouth of Hightower riv er.**** :\"\n\nWe, after refreshing the troops, marched for that place, taking the path that leads to that town, along which the Creeks had marched, in five\n\nlarge trails. On the 17th instant, in the after-\n\nnoon, we arrived at the forks of Coosa and Hightower rivers. Col. Kelly was ordered with a part of the Knox regiment to endeavor to cross the Hightower. The Creeks and a number of Cherokees had intrenched themselves to obstruct the passage. Col. Kelly and his party passed down the river half a mile below the ford and began to cross at a private place, where there was no ford. Himself and a few others swam over the river. The Indians, discovering this movement, immediately left their intrenchments and ran down the river to oppose their passage, expecting, as I suppose, the whole intended crossing at the lower place.\n\nCapt. Evans immediately with his\n\ncompany of mounted infantry strained their horses back to the upper ford and began to cross the river. Very few had, got to the south bank before the Indians, who had discovered their mistake, returned and received them furiously at the rising of the bank, An engagement instantly took place and became very warm, and notwithstanding the enemy were at least four to one in numbers, besides the advantage of situation, Capt. Evans with *\"F heroic company put them in a short timf tteflv to flight. They left sev-\n\neral dead on the ground, and were seen to carry others off both on foot and on horse. Bark and trails of blood from the wounded were to be seen in every quarter,\n\nThe encampment fell into our hands, with a number of their guns, many of which were of the Spanish sort, with budgets, plankets and match coats, together with some horses. We lost three men in this engagement, which is a31 tnat have fel1 during the time of our route, although this last attack was the fourth the enemy had made upon us, but in the others repulsed without loss, --------\n\n^ovfc^s ^(T7-jrtH was evielentK made to Gov\n\nWm.^Blount. 1I<tP ?s h61-4%resented\" frcm^Bamsey's\n\nAnnals of Tennessee, ps. 587-8.\n\n****NowaIOostanau1a!' \" E*'saca\" ***--*sitc cf Rome.\n\nJOHN SEVIER, JOHN FLOYD AND THE INDIANS\n\n25\n\nAfter the last engagement we cross ed the main Coosa, then proceeded on our way down the main river near the Turnip Mountain,* destroying in our way several Creek and Cherokee towns, which they had settled together on each side of the river, and from which they have a.11 fled with appar ent precipitation, leaving- almost every thing behind them. Neither did they after the last engagement attempt to annoy or interrupt us on our march, in any manner \"whatever. I have got reason to believe their ardor and spirit was well checked.\n\nThe party flogged at Hightower were those which had been out -with Watts. There arc three or four men slightly \\vounded and two or three horses killed, but the Indians did not, as I heard of, get a single horse from us the time we -were out. We took and destroyed nearly 300 beeves, many of which were of the best and largest kind. Of course their losing so much provision must distress them very much.\n\nMany women and children might have been taken, but from, motives of humanity I did not encourage it to be done, and several taken were suf fered to make their escape. \"Your Ex cellency knows the disposition of many that were out on this expedition, and can readily account for this conduct.\n\nThe National Encyclopedia of American Biography, Vol. II, page 395, gives Hugh Lawson White\n\ncredit for the death of the Indian chief mentioned above : \"A war\n\nwith the Cherokees breaking out, he volunteered under Gen.

John Floyd in 1814. Gen. Floyd was a native of S(_mih Carolina arid a descendant of noted fighting men.\n\nHe owned Fail-field Plantation,\n\nCaniden County, where he died June 24, 1839, after having- served in the State legislature and in Congress. He defeated the Creek\n\nIndians, allies of the Piritish, at\n\nAutossee, Fort Defiance, and Chinibee, Ala., and so complete was the rout that the warlike Creeks as a nation never afterward became dang-erotis along the border, and the comparatively peaceful settle ment of Northwest Georgia was made possible.\n\nAnother civilizing influence about this time was the invention of the Cherokee alphabet of 85 characters by Sequovah (George Guess or Gist), an uneducated In dian who lived at Alpine, Chattooga County, and \"who was a fre quent visitor to Major Ridge's at his home on the Oostanaula. Sequoyah wrote on bark with pokeberry juice, instructed his little daughter and any Indian who wished to learn. He went west to the Indian country in a few years, and presently his alphabet was adopted by the Cherokee Nation and was used along with English in copies of the Cherokee Phoenix,\n\n26\n\nA HISTORY OF ROME AND FLOYD COUNTY\n\nthe paper edited at New Echota by Elias Boudinot.\n\nSeveral glimpses into Indian and frontier life are given in \"The Laws of the Cherokees,\" published by the Cherokee Advocate at Tahlequah, Okla., in 1852. One of these ir contained in an order from the chiefs and warriors in National Council at \"Broom's Town,\" Sept. 11, 1808. (Broom's Town was probably Broom Town, Cherokee County, Ala., in Broom Town Val ley, and about five miles from\n\nCloudland, Chattooga County, Ga.). The order forms \"regulating com panies\" of one captain, one lieu tenant and four privates each, at annual salaries of $50, $40 and $30, respectively, for the purpose of arresting horse thieves and pro tecting property. The penalty for stealing\" a horse was 100 lashes on the bare back of the thief, be he man or woman, and fewer lashes for things of less value ; and if a thief resisted the \"regulators\" with gun, axe, spear or knife, he could be killed 011 the spot.\n\nThis law was signed by Black Fox, principal chief ; Chas. Hicks, secretary to the Council ; Path Killer and Toochalar. These offi\n\ncials and Turtle at Home, Speaker of the Council, drafted the follow ing law Apr. 10, 1810, at \"Oostan-\n\nnallah,\" a town supposed to have been located about three miles east of Resaca, Gordon County, on the east bank of the Comiasauga\n\n(sometimes known at that point as Oostanaula) River, near the\n\nmouth of Polecat Creek :\n\nBe it known that this day the various clans and tribes which compose the Cherokee Nation have agreed that should it happen that a brother, for getting his natural affection, should use his hand in anger and kill his brother, he shall be accounted guilty of murder and suffer accordingly; and if a man has a horse stolen, and over takes the thief, and should his anger be so great as to cause him to kill him, let his blood remain on his own conscience, but no satisfaction shall be demanded for his life from his rel atives or the clan he may belong to.\n\n\"Echota\" was the Cherokee term\n\nfor \"town.\" The first capital is said by some authorities to have been\n\noriginally in Virginia, the second in North Carolina and the third in East Tennessee. Prior to 1825, it\n\nappears, John Ross, principal chief, lived at Ross' Landing-, Tennessee River, now Chattanooga. The first\n\nmention in the Cherokee laws of New Town (or New Echota) was\n\nunder date of Oct. 26, 1819. This place was situated on the south bank of the Oostanaula River, in\n\nGordon County, Ga., just below the confluence of the Coosawattee\n\nand the Comiasauga Rivers and presumably three miles south of\n\nOostanaula village.\n\nOn Oct. 28, 1819, at Newtown\n\nthe following- order was passed :\n\nThis day decreed by the National Committee and Council, That all citi zens of the Cherokee Nation establish ing a store for the purpose of vend ing merchandise shall obtain license for that purpose from the clerk of the\n\nJOHN SEVIKR, JOHN FLOYD AND THE INDIANS\n\nNational Council, for which each and every person so licensed shall pay a tax of $25 per annum, and that no other but citizens of the Cherokee Nation shall be allowed to establish a permanent store within the Nation. And it is also decreed that no peddlers not citizens of the Nation shall be permitted to vend merchandise in the Nation without first obtaining- license from the Agent of the United States for the Cherokee Nation, agreeably to the laws of the United States, and each and everyone so licensed shall pay $80 to the treasurer of the Cherokee Nation annually.\n\nTTMhi-s l, aw was si- gned. bi y JTohi n\n\nRoss, President of the National Committee ; Path Killer, ChaS.

In a description of the Coosewatee District the ferry\n\nof the Widow Fool is again mei\n\ntioned.\n\nT\n\n,,\n\n. *t would appear that for about\n\nsix years, from 1819 to 1825; the\n\nCherokee National Committee and\n\nCouncil held their meetings at New Echota On Nov. 12 1825, it was\n\nr \" l r?

R- TTicks,** A. McCoy, clerk of the .National Commit tee, and Ellas P>oudinot, clerk of the Na tional Council.\n\nThus we see the Cherokees, driv en from pillar to post by the en croaching- pale-faces, marshaling\" their forces for a last ditch stand. Their first expedient was to estab lish \"a nation within a nation,\" hence the concentration of power in a Principal Chief, a National Committee and a National Coun cil, and a regular scat of govern ment at New Hchota ; their second expedient was resort to such force as they could command--hig'hway assassination, attacks on isolated families, tribal uprising's -- and finally, when state and federal gov ernment pressure became too great, non-intercourse and passive resistance. Their newspaper proved a feeble weapon.\n\nAs far back as the presidency of Georg-e Washington (1794) we find pow-wows in Philadelphia (then the national capital) with the Cherokees and other tribes of the va rious states in the east and the southeast. Tn 1803 Trios. Jefferson, then President, suggested a gen eral movement westward. In 1817\n\narid in 1819, dtiring- the Presidency of James JMoiiroe, important trea ties were signed with the Cherokees, involving' cessions of land. In\n\n1802, during the administration of JVl'r. Jefferson, Georgia had ceded to the United States government all the land she owned westward to the Mississippi River, now the states of Alabama and Mississippi, in exchange for the g-ov eminent's promise to extinguish the Indian title to land within Georgia's pres\n\nent boundaries. Twenty years passed ; nothing having- been done, Gov. Geo. M. Troup pressed the matter upon the attention of Presi dent James Monroe, and the Presi dent called a meeting' in 1825 for Indian Springs. Here the Lower Creeks, led by Gen. Win. McTntosh, ignored the hostile Alabama Creeks, who did not attend, and signed away their Georgia lands. This act infuriated the Alabama Creeks, and 170 men volunteered to kill Gen. McTntosb, who lived at \"Md.ntosh Reserve,\"on the Chattnhoochee River, five miles southwest of \\Vhitesburg\", in what is now Carroll Countv. The band lay in the woods until 3 o'clock one morning, and proceeded to the Afclntosh home with a quantity of pitch pine on the backs of three warriors. Presently the pine knots were ig\n\nnited and thrown under the house, and the structure blaxed up brightly. l(*rom the second story Mcintosh fought off his enemies with four g'Uiis, but eventually the heat forced him to descend, and when he exposed himself he was shot, then drag'g'ed into the yard and killed with knives.\n\nThe Alabama Creeks having claimed the Indian Springs instru\n\nment waft \"no treaty,\" the incom-\n\nrful orator, fmt _ it\n\nJOHN SEVIER, JOHN FLOYD AND THE\n\n29\n\ning president, John Oumcy Aciams,\n\ntook their side and ordered Gov. Troup not to survey the lands just ceded. The Georgia Governor de fied Mr. Adams and told him if United States troops invaded Geor gia soil, Georgia troops would put them off. Trouble was averted by a new agreement in which the In dians were given about $28,000.\n\nThe Creek settlement furnished a suggestion for the agents who ten years later negotiated with a minority faction of the Chcrokces, as will be told more fully herein hereafter. Farther down, in South Georgia and Florida, were the\n\nsuch establishment. Samuel A. Worcester, a native of Worcester, Mass., had charge of a mission at New Echota. Missionary\n\nStation, at Coosa, Floyd Coun ty, was in the care of Rev. and Mrs. lilijah Butler, who were\n\nsent out from South Canaan, Conn., by the American .Baptist Commit tee on Foreign Missions. J'n 1831 Or. Worcester, Dr. Butler and nine others were sentenced to a term of\n\nfour years in the Georgia peni tentiary at Mill edge ville, and served a year and four months.

The clans were Wolf, Deer, Paint, .Long-hair, Bird, Blind Sa vannah and Holly. Jno. Ross was a Tlird, Major Ridge a Deer and David Vami a Wolf.\n\nPrior to 1820 Congress appro\n\npriated $10,000 yearly toward the maintenance of missions and mis sionaries among the Indians of Cherokec Georgia and contiguous territory. The Brainerd Mission\n\nwas located on Missionary Ridge.

Various land speculators, adventurers, criminals and good, substantial people began to over run the Cherokee country. Under letter date of Aug. 6, 1832, from the Council Ground at Red Clay, \"Whit field County, the following red-skins protested to .Lewis Cass,\n\n30\n\nA HISTORY OF ROME AND FLOYD COUNTY\n\nSecretary of War, against the pale\n\nface encroachments :*\n\nRichard Tayloi', President of Com mittee ; John Ridge.\n\nMajor Ridge, his x mark, Geo.

Then it was that the lottery drawings for the Cherokcc lands were held, and the influx of settlers became gen eral. L,ike a plague of locusts the new-comers alighted on the choice hunting- grounds of the Cherokees. The territory was broken up into counties, and thus was also broken the friendship between the con tending1 parties, which for so long had been hang-ing* by a slender thread. John Ross directed a pro test to his tribesmen which caused them to fast for several days. The Indians assumed an ugly attitude, but it availed little, as we shall presently see.\n\nPART II\n\n\"ANCIENT ROME\" 1834-1861\n\nCHAPTER I. Rome's Establishment and Early Days\n\nX THE spring of 1834 two lawyers were traveling on\n\nhorseback from Cassvillc, Cass County, to attend court at Living-ston, the county seat of Floyd. Thev were Col. Daniel R Mitchell, a lawyer of Canton, Chctokee County, and Col. Zachariah B Hargrove, Cassville attorney, formerly of Coving-ton, Newton County. The day was warm and the travelers hauled up at a small spring on the peninsula which separates the Ktowah and the Oostanaula rivers at their junction. Here they slaked their thirst and sat clown under a -willow tree to rest before proceeding- on their way.\n\nCol Hargrove gazed in actaira.lion on the surrounding hills and remarked - \"This would make a splendid site for a town.\"\n\nI was just thi.nking- the same, returned his companion. 'There seems to be plenty of water round abotit and extremely fertile soil and all the timber a man coulu want.\n\nA stranger having come up to refresh himself at the spring, and having overheard the conversation, said : \"Gentlemen, you- will pardon me for intruding, but I have been convinced for some time that the location of this place offers exeeptional opportunities for building a city that would become the largest and most prosperous in Cherokee Georgia. I live tu-o miles south of here. My business takes me now and then to George M. Lavender's trading- post up the Oostariaula there, and 1 never pass this spot but I think of what could be done.\"\n\nThe last speaker introduced himself as ilaj. Philip Walker Hemp-\n\nhill, planter. Learning- the mission\n\nof the travelers, he added: \"The court does not open until tomorrow afternoon. You g-eiitlemcn are no doubt fatigued by your journey, a d it will give me great pleasure if you will accompany me home and spend the night. There we can discuss the matter of locating a town at this place.\"\n\nCol. Mitchell and Col. Harg-rove accepted with thanks. The three left the spring- (which still runs tinder Broad street at the southeast corner of Third Avenue), crossed the Etowah River on John Ross' \"Forks Ferry,\" and proceeded with Major Hemphill to his comfortable plantation home at what is now DeSoto Park. Here the >' wellt lnto the question more deeply. A cousin of Maj. Hemphl11 - Gen - James Hemphill, who hved about ten miles down Vann's Valley, had recently been elected to thc Georgia legislature, and ccmld no doubt bring about a removal of the county site from Living-ston to Rome ;\" he was also commanding officer of the Georgia Militia in the section.\n\nAfter court was over, Col. Mitchell and Col. Hargrove spent aiiother night with Maj. Hemphill, and the \"next morning Col. Wm. Smith was called in from Cave Spring-, and became the fourth member of the company. It was there agreed that all available land would be acquired immcdiateiy, the ferry rights would be bought and the ground laid off in lots. Gen. Hemphill was requested to confer with his compatriots at ]S1 illedgeviUe and draw up a bill for removal. The projectors would give sufficient land for thc public buildings and in time would make the ferries free and cause neces-\n\n34\n\nA HISTORY OF ROME AND FLOYD COUNTY\n\nsary bridges to be built, as well as to lay out streets at once. A con tract alongf these lines was signed with the Inferior Court of Floyd County. Since Col. Mitchell and Col. ITargrove were fairly well es tablished elsewhere, and it would be some time before the}' could move, they agreed to leave the le gal matters in the hands of J ohn H. Lumpkin, of Oglethorpe Coun ty, who was ready to resign as sec retary to his uncle, Governor Wil son Lumpkin, and to grow up with the new town.\n\nThese five pioneers put five names into a hat, it having been agreed that the name drawn out should be the name of the city the}' were to build. Col. Smith put in the name Hillsboro, typify ing the hills, arid this later became the name of the suburb he develop ed, South Rome ; Col. Hargrove suggested Pittsburg, after the iron slid steel metropolis of Pennsyl-\n\nDAN1KL R. MITCHEI.L, la\n\nvariia ; Col. H emphill preferred Hamburg, after the great commer cial city of Germany ; Col. Mitchell, recalling the seven hills of an cient Rome on the Tiber, wanted Rome ; and Mr. Lumpkin favored Warsaw, after the city of Poland. The name Rome was extracted and became the name of the town.\n\nAmong- other early settlers of Rome or Floyd County were the following :\n\nCol. Alfred Shorter, who came from Society Hill, Ala., to finance the operations of William Smith, on a half interest basis ; Joseph Watters and John Rush, of the Waiters District; John EHis, Jos. Ford, Judge W. H. Underwood, Alford P>. Recce, Tbos. G. Watters, Thos. S- Price, Wesley Shropshire, Edward Ware, Thos. and Elijah l,umpkin, Micajah Mayo, Rlkanali Kverett, of Everett Springs ; A.

Lidclell (or Ladelle), Alfred Brown, James Wells, Jesse Lamberth, Terrence McGuirc, Dennis Hills, Dr. Tbos. Hamilton, Samuel Mobley, Wm. Montgomery, Fielding* Flight, Green Curmingham and Samuel Stewart.\n\nJackson County appropriately bears the name \"Mother of Floyd,\"\n\nROME'S ESTABLISHMENT AND EARLY DAYS\n\n35\n\nbecause of the number and promi nence of her citizens who settled, ia Cave Spring-, Vaiin's Valley or Rome. Among these might be men tioned Mrs. Alfred Shorter, Major Philip W. Hcmphill and his brother, Chas. Jonathan TTemphill; Col. and Mrs. Wm. Smith and her brother, Jiio. W'illis Mayo, and her kinsman, Mica jah Mayo, after whom the Mayo Bar lock was named; Col. Smith's brothers, Chas., John and Elijah A. Smith ; Gen. Jas. Hemphill, Walton H. Jones, Pcyton Skipwith Randolph, New ton Green, Col. James Liddell (or Ladelle), and Win. Montgomery. Most of these settled in Va tin's Valley or Cave Spring- and thus furnished the inspiration for Rome. Generally they hailed from Jefferson, borne of Dr. Crawforcl W. Long-.\n\nTii 1828 the Georgia Legislature had passed a law extending- juris diction over the Cherokee countrv.\n\nthus ending the \"nation within, a\n\nnation\" dream. On Dec. 3, 18,32, less than two months after the lottery drawings, the Legislature passed an act providing for a division of Cherokee Georgia into ten large counties : Floycl, called after the Indian fight er, Gen. Jiio. Floycl, of Camden County ; Cherokee, Forsyth, Lumpkin, Cobb, Gilmer, Cass, Murray, Paul ding- and Union. Roughly speaking, this territory lay northwest of the Chattahoochee River, and -was bounded on the north by the Tennessee line, ;md on the west by the Alabama line. Gradually more and more, di visions were made, until today the territory is composed of the fol lowing- additional counties : Dade, Walker, Catoosa, Chattooga, Bartow, Gordon, Polk, Haralson, Carroll, Douglas, Milton, Dawsoii, White, Fanniii, Pickeiis, Rabun, Towns and Habersharn, and purl's of Hall, Heard and Troup.\n\nFloyd was surveyed by Jacob M. Scudcler, who in 1833 was em ployed by the United States gov ernment to appraise Indian lands and improvements near Cave Spring-. Mr. Scudder's name ap pears on the early records at the Floyd County courthouse in a real estate transaction, but there is 110 evidence that he ever lived at Rome. Livingstoii, a hamlet located 011 the south side of the Coosa River at Foster's Bend, about 14 miles below Rome, was chosen bv legis lative act of Dec. 21, 1833* as the county seat, and a log cabin court house was erected at which one or more sessions of court, presided over by Judge Jiio. W. Hooper, were held, and in which quite a number of Indians appeared as prosecutors and defendants.\n\nThe removal of the countv seat from Livingstoii to Rome took place under authority of an act passed Dec. 20, 1834\",** and was\n\n36\n\nA HISTORY OF R.OMH AND RLOYD COUNTY\n\nconsummated, in 1835. However, a considerable settlement had sprung\" up prior to this in Vann's Valley. On the \"pale-face side\" of the Chattahoochee a large and restless element had been held back by the existing1 conditions, but when encouragement was g-iven by the Georg-ia autliorities to ciicroachments oil the Indian lands, this tide overflowed into the Cherokee country.\n\nThe county site w-as removed to Land Lot 245, 23rd District, 3rd Section, Head of Coosa, Floyd County, the new place to be known as Rome.* The first Saturday in February, 1835, was set as the date for selecting\" five commissioners for one-year terms.** Parts of hind lot 244, east of the Oostanaula and 276, north of the Hightower (Ktowali), were also reserved for the growth of the town.. The act further stated that nothing therein was to be considered in conflict with a contract made previously by Wm. Smith, et ah, with the In ferior Court.\n\nAn. amendment*** to the act of 1834, passed Dec. 29, 1838, provided for creation of the office of \" i n tciidant,\" which means \"superin tendent\" by the dictionary, but probablv meant \"mayor\" in those days ; also included were commis sioners, clerk, marshal, etc., and some salaries were fixed.\n\nDavid Van 11, a Clierokee subchicf, had settled near Cave Springin the valley which was given his name, and in this valley between the present Rome and Cave Springpeople began to \"squat\" several years before there was a Rome.\n\nTn 1828, Major Armistead Rich ardson, father-in-law oC the late\n\nJudge Augustus R. Wright, of Rome, removed to Vann's,-Valley from Augusta and wit'rf\" the as sistance of a number \" of -enthusi astic associates began preparations\n\nTor the establishment of Cave Spring in 1831.\n\nRidg-e Valley, seven miles north of Rome, had been settled simul taneously with the Vann's Valley settlement. This valley was named a ftcr another Indian leader, Major Kidge, who is supposed to have lived in it, at the present Rush place, at H crmitag'e, a number of years before moving- to the Oosta naula near Rome.\n\nThe period of j ohn Ross J resi dence in JDcSoto (Rome's present Fourth ward) has not been deter mined accurately. However, a sat isfactory conclusion may be drawn from the fact that the CheroTccc chiefs had been meeting at the New Echota Council ground, since 1819, that New Kchota had been the capital since 1825, and Mr. Ross found DeSoto (\"Head of Coosa\") a central point to reside.**** Un doubtedly Mr. Ross was influenced\n\nirned John Ros;\n\n. Cl\n\n(Land Lot 237, 2~3rd district 3rd section) was drawn by Mush Brown, of Beavour's district, Habersham County.

The rivers were still alive with fish; wild turkeys and deer were often seen; snakes were numerous ; quail were abundant and squirrels skip ped in their native element where Broad Street now extends; the bushes were alive with wild birds of beautiful color; on Mt. Alto and Lavender Mountain, five miles away, bears could be found; and at night the fiery gleam from the eye of a wolf was a common sight. It was a wild country, with trails for roads, and few conveniences.\n\nSquatters and Indians alike pitched their tents in suitable spots waiting for -some new word to \"move on\" or \"move off.\" Small squads of Georgia Guardsmen, es tablished by act of 1834, or of Unit ed States soldiers, watching Guards and Indians alike, camped a while and then went on to other duty. Trappers and traders did a thriv ing business; so did the ferry men who set people across at the forks or elsewhere. Everybody seemed to be going or coming, de spite the efforts of the Town Com pany to halt them at Rome. The Indians were unusually restless.\n\nAlong would come a wrhite fam ily on horseback, carrying all their worldly goods. They had traveled from some neighboring county, or perchance as far as from North Carolina, hoping to better their material condition. The man would lead, the children would follow, and the mother bring up the rear, rid ing sidewise. Any old port in a storm looked good.\n\nMany had definite objectives, many did not and would \"squat\" anywhere that looked like it held promise for the future. Others were definitely attracted by the prospect of pioneering in a live town. It is fair to say that Rome\n\nand Floyd County received, along with many \"floaters,\" a highly sub stantial and even aristocratic cit izenship. The founders were men of character and iron will--accus tomed to blazing their way through one kind of forest or another. They started with little and made out of it much. There were no luxuries to be had, hence they worked with the things of nature, and fashioned out of them whatever they could.\n\nThe old Alabama Road forked where the Central Railroad trestle now crosses it. One fork led to Major Ridge's Ferry opposite the Linton A. Dean place, and the other bent southeast to the Ross ferry at the confluence of the rivers. At the Ross ferry a man from Ala bama could gain the Hillsboro side or the Rome side, as he pleased. A little later the traffic became so heavy that Matt and Overton Hitchcock built for Col. Smith a covered wooden bridge at Fifth Avenue (over the Oostanaula), and from that point connected with the Alabama Road. Agricultural busi ness gradually grew prosperous. George Lavender's trading post did a land office business. It used to be said that Lavender kept his money in a barrel or keg which was al ways fairly well filled with gold and silver coin; and that when his partnership with Major Ridge and Daniel R. Mitchell was dissolved, they cut a melon estimated at $250,000 in 1922 coin.\n\nPerhaps 5,000 Indians patronized\n\nthis establishment, and they paid\n\nany price for what they wranted. They were especially fond of calico garments, and would buy extrava gantly for their women, and often include enough for an odd waist which the women would make for them. They wore outlandish clothes, never matching in any par ticular ; buckskin or \\voolen trous ers, wrell worn or patched; hats that suggested the hat of today on\n\n40\n\nA HISTORY'OF ROME AND FLOYD COUNTY\n\na Chinaman, often with a squirrel tail tacked on it and hanging; clown the side or back; some hats made entirely of skin, and therefore very warm in cold weather; moccasins or discarded white man shoes cov ering- their feet, but many bare foot ; die up jewelry and trinkets whenever they could g-et it, which was often ; sometimes a queer turbari in place of a hat; usually no coat or jacV.et ; except in winter.\n\nThe Indian was fond of tobacco and liquor, but as soon as the lead ers saw what terrible inroads were being- made on Indian territory by pale-face profiteers of various kinds, a strong\" Indian organization was formed to stamp out the evils. l^Kjuor was obtained from stores that had a provision shop in front and a barroom or \"doggery\" in the rear, the entire establishment be ing- dignified by the name \"gro cery.\" Green wooden screens ob scured the occupants of the bar room until a state law caused them to be abolished, and then every body could peek in and see who \"was getting \"lit up.\" Around these places loafed a gang* of shiftless Indians and whites, bent on satis fying their abnormal appetites, and fit subjects for whatever mischief might be sugg-ested by the Demon\n\nRum. These g-angs were extremely profane, and poisoned the atmos phere for such a distance that ladies and young* ladies would nev\n\ner venture closer than across the street. Knife and pistol scrapes were frequent, especially late at night after the more peaceful in habitants had retired to their beds. A calaboose soon became a crying necessity, and with it a town mar shal who managed to keep it full, except when the inmates escaped and turned the thing- over on its side. It \"was a log affair, near \\Vest Second Street and Sixth Avenue.\n\nThere is no certainty as to just what the early city government was like. Doubtless in the begin ning every man was a law unto himself. Gradually, however, local laws were passed and irresponsi ble persons made amenable to them. In the thirteen years that Rome remained unincorporated it is likely that the intendant or the marshal acted as the executive ma jor douio, and. certain that local or inferior court judges meted out\n\njustice.\n\nCol. Mitchell, surveyor, evidently had in mind a future instrument like the automobile when he laid out the streets of the town. He made Broad Street and Oostanaula Street (Fourth Avenue) 132 feet wide, all other streets 66 feet wide and lanes 33 feet. Some modifica tions of that scale, notably with regard to Fourth Avenue, have hi lice been made, and a lawsuit of some importance and ititerest has\n\nresulted.\n\nA few more stores and shops sprang up which carried every ar ticle that could be obtained in such a limited market. The groceries would also offer a line of retail'dry goods, small farming- implements, plug and smoking tobacco, pipes, lanterns and lamps, wax tapers, matches, candles, novelties for the Indians, snuff for the women, suits,\n\nROME'S ESTABLISHMENT AND EARLY DAYS\n\n41\n\nhats and shoes, horse collars and harness, nails, hand tools, occa sionally musical i list runic nts. There were no soda water, ice, silver ciga rette cases, bon-bons or chocolates, nail files, Up sticks, rouge, hair nets or beaver hats. Drug stores, banks newspapers, steamboats, crocker ies and bakeries, schools and churches were to come'along later.\n\nGentlemen blacked their own boots and cut out of the forest with great cross-cut saws the wood that went into their homes. They wore the uniforms of the frontier and assumed the manners of frontiers men. Rome was to be built, and it could not be built with kid gloves.\n\nThe social life was very restrict ed at first. It consisted of calls from neighbor on neighbor, afoot, on horseback or by ox-cart; or maybe a country break-down on a ruddy improvised platform- Since the Indians had no city to build-- since the}^ needed only to g-et a little something' to eat every day and keep out- of the way of landgrabbers and the \"state police\"-- they had more time for frolics than the early whites. Around bonfires in their villages the red-skins made merry, rending- the nights hideous with their war-whoops; and 011 these special occasions they put aside their semi-civilized g-arb and donned the buckskin, the flaming headdress of feathers and all the paint they could daub on.\n\n\"Each year in summer came the Green Corn Dances at the various villages. The late Mr's. Robert Battey recalled one at Major Ridge's, held when she was about seven years of age. A large com pany of Indians g-athered, and one thing' that impressed her particu larly was that some of the men had mussel shells tied around their ankles and filled with gravel that\n\n'From this description it is evident that the games were played on the low, level spot which\n\nand the Geci-g-ja School for the Deaf.\n\nrattled -when they danced. She re membered that several remained over night until Sunday, and kick ed up their heels in George Laven der's store. Her impression of the Indian was the same as that ob tained by anybody who knew his nature; he was a silent, taciturn individual, deeply religious in his own way, ever faithful to the pale face who befriended him and ever the foe of one who played him false. He seldom, if ever, broke a promise.\n\nFrom Montgomery M. Kolsom, writing- in The Rome Tribune Nov. 20, 1892, we have the following contribution on the pioneer (\\ayf-:\n\nI drove with Mr. Wesley O. Connor out to see Mr. Wright Ellis, one of the last of the old settlers of the Cave Spring region, and Mr. Ellis told many interesting stories of the early days. Mr. Ellis came to Cave Spring with his father as a little boy. Near his house at the end of Vann's Valley stood an old fort which protected the settlement. He told me of a wolf found dead in the cave it had lain there several years, and the mineral qualities of the cave had preserved it perfectly, until one day a band of Indian boys dragged forth the carcass and tore it to pieces.\n\nDavid Vann lived on the hill above the spring and the Indians used to congregate near his place for their an nual ball play, as they called it*. They came from miles away to enjoy the sport. They would also form in two\n\nA HISTORY OK ROME AND FLOYD\n\nlines (sides) and shoot arrows at rolling- stones. The side which scored the most hits \"would \"win.\n\nA short distance west of Cave Spring1 was -where the Indians of that neigh borhood held their Green Corn dances. Mr. Ellis aid he had seen crowds es timated at 1,000 to 5,000. Out in the nearby mountains Capt. John Ellis, his father, \"went with a small party and captured two Cherokee chiefs who were giving trouble during1 the re moval, and threatening a massacre. The chiefs were sent west. As the raiders approached, a sentinel cried, \"Eastoehatchee soolacogee!\" meaning\"much white man!\"\n\nThese were the days of the \"pony clubs,\" whose members blacked their faces and stole horses from whites and Indians alike.

The country was overrun\n\nwith vigilance committees, out\n\nlaws, land speculators, soldiers, un ruly Indians and plain people of\n\nrespectability who wanted to farm\n\nand conduct their shops in peace. .Peace and the social order that thrives in it was not to be attained,\n\nhowever, until the Indians were\n\nsent west lock, stock arid barrel.\n\nCHAPTER II. The Great Indian Meeting at Rome\n\nHK following item from the\n\nprietors), announced the date and place of the important meeting of Ridge and Ross forces and Geor gia Guardsmen and United States troopers near Rome. Tins meet ing\" was vital because it paved the way for the Council pow-wow at Red Clay in October, which in turn brought about the New Echota meeting' and treaty signed Dec. 29, 1iS35, the instrument by which the Cherokees were removed :*\n\nThe Cassville Pioneer says John Ridge and his friends will hold a Coun cil in Floyd County six miles north of Rome 20th of July inst. It is expected this Council -will be numerously at tended. The cause of Ridge and his party is g-oing ahead.\n\nThe meeting actuall3r opened on the 19th, a day ahead of schedule.\n\nThe gathering was supposed, prior to discovery of the above item in an old newspaper file in the I vibrary of the University of Georgia, to have been held at the home of Major Ridge on the Oostanaula, but since the item says it was to be held six miles north of K-ome, and several authorities as sert the place was \"Running Wa ters,\" the conclusion is inevitable th?t it was held at the home of John Ridge, son of the ^Major, three miles north of Rome, at the planta tion later owned by John Hvime, and now the property of K. 1^,.

A bold spring- at this domicile caused the name \"Tantataiiara,\"\n\nGuards'menf U^iteT1 iStTtesf \"troops' Officials0 a'nd onlookers, it is probable that 3,000 people at tended this meeting.

Elbert Herring, Esq., Commissioner of Indian Affairs,\n\nWashington, D. C. Dear Sir: The people composing the\n\ncouncil called for the purpose of ob\n\ntaining the sense of the nation on the subject of the annuity convened on the\n\nday before the period appointed. There were between 2,500 and 2,600 Indian\n\nmen present. This number could not by any previous measures or meetings have been anticipated. Mr. Schermer-\n\nhorn was present and obtained their consent to address them on the next\n\nmorning. The first day was consumed in discussions, explanations and vot\n\ning on a proposition to divide the an\n\nnuity among the people by ayes and\n\nnays.\n\nWhen the next morning arrived, Mr. Schermerhorn had a stand erected, so\n\nthat he might by his elevation be the\n\nmore generally heard; aided by the Rev. Jesse Bushyhead, he went into a full\n\nexplanation of the views of the Gov ernment, and the relation in which\n\nthe different delegations stood to one another; their people, the States and\n\nthe general Government; which was listened to with much attention for a\n\nperiod of three hours. In order to\n\ninsure attention, this resolution had\n\nbeen so worded that it would not dis\n\npose of the question further than the single proposition was concerned; and\n\nby addressing them before the vote was finished, Mr. Schermerhorn had,\n\nperhaps, the largest red audience of adult males ever before assembled to-\n\ngather in this nation at one time.\n\nThe Cherokees had, until a few days before, been advised not to attend, but\n\nwhen Ross found that the money would be paid to the order of the majority\n\n44\n\nA HISTORY OF ROME AND FLOYD COUNTY\n\nattending, bis head men were called together at Red Clay, when I am in formed he told them the agents of Government, and the disorganized at tached to Ridge, must be put down; and in order to do this, all the men of the nation must rally, and be there to sustain their nation and treasury.\n\nThey came, some starving-, some half clad, some armed, and scarcely any with provisions for more than one or two days. Under these circumstances, having a desire to be heard, Mr. Schermerhorn promised them rations for one day, on condition they would hear him as commissioner. On exam ination, I found they might, under the 9th section of the regulations for pay ing annuities, be furnished at public expense, if circumstances rendered it necessary. Arrangements were accord ingly made, and requisitions drawn on Ijieut. Bateman to meet the same.\n\nI took occasion to say to the Cherokees, as they came up by districts, that let them vote the money in what way they would, it could not save their country; that their party had been in vited to express their views and wishes freely; instead of doing this they had withdrawn themselves from the ground, and been counselled in the bushes. Why was this so? Were their chiefs still disposed to delude their people, when ruin demanded entrance at the red man's door, and the heavy hand of oppression already rested upon his head?\n\nTo say the least of it, there was something suspicious fri their -with drawal. The officers of Government were bound to report their speeches to the Secretary of War, and the chiefs had shown contempt to the United States by -withdrawing themselves and their people into the woods beyond their hearing. If this was not the proper construction to be placed upon such a proceeding-, the chiefs had cer tainly carried them off to feed their feelings on false hopes jmd false prom ises once more.\n\nWhen the resolution presented by Smith* was disposed of, which stood 114 for and 2,238** against, Gunter's resolution to pay to the Treasury was next in order. The whole people were called up and the resolution read. Mr. Gunter made a few remarks in its sup port, when Major Ridg-e offered an amendment, directing that none of this money should be paid to lawyers. This was seconded by John Ridge, which gave both these latter gentlemen a full\n\nopportunity to be heard. They went into a most pathetic description of na tional distress and individual oppres sion; the necessity of seeking freedom in another clime; the importance of union and harmony, and the beauties of peace and of friendship; but said if there -were any who preferred to endure misery and wed themselves to slavery, as for them and their friends, they craved not such company.\n\nThe Indians had, by districts, in files four deep, been drawn up to vote on Gunter's resolution, that they might hear it read? and be counted the more conveniently- But when the Ridges were speaking, all the previous prej udices so manifestly shown by looks appeared to die away, and the be nighted foresters involuntarily broke the line and pressed forward as if at tracted by the powers of magnetism to the stand, and when they could get no nearer, they reached their heads forward in anxiety to hear the truth. After the Ridges had procured the de sired attention, they withdrew their amendment, and the vote -was taken on Gunter's resolution, and carried by acclamation. Mr. Schermerhorn then requested eich party to appoint com mittees to meet him and Governor Carroll*** at the agency on the 29th in stant. Ridge's party complied. If the other party did, it has not been made known to the commissioner.\n\nBy the next mail we will be able to give information of a more sat isfactory nature, having reference to the future.\n\nI have no doubt, although the money -went into the treasury of the nation, (as might have been expected from a general turnout), still, the informa tion communicated in the discussions growing up on the occasion -will be attended with the most happy conse-\n\nTHE GREAT INDIAN MEKTINQ AT ROME\n\n45\n\nJ OHN ROSS, Principal Chief of the Cherokee Nation of Indians from 1828 to his death in 1866, who fought with admirable courage more than 25 years to keep his people in the hunting grounds of their forefathers.\n\n46\n\nA HISTORY OF ROME AND FLOYD COUNTY\n\nquences to the Cherokees, and great ly facilitate a final adjustment of their difficulties.\n\nIt is a matter worthy of remark that so great a number of persons of any color have seldom if ever met and preserved better order than was ob served on this occasion.\n\nMost respectfully, I have the honor to be, your very obedient servant,\n\nBENJAMIN F.

Nathaniel Smith, \\vho were appointed in June last by me to take the census of the Cherokees east, in conformity with a verbal request from the Honorable Secretary of War, as well as to com ply with the requirements contained in a \"circular\" dated War Depart ment, Office Indian Affairs, May, 1835, addressed to me a short period before this duty was commenced. Runners were sent over the country, and some of Ross' messages were seen and read by the census-takers, direct ing the Cherokees not to allow their numbers to be taken.\n\nIn 1819 John Ross notified the In dian agent that he had determined to reside permanently on a tract of land reserved -within the ceded territory for his use; and in contemplation of the treaty, took upon himself all the re sponsibilities of a citizen of the United States. Has he not, then, subjected himself to the penalties of the 13th, 14th and 15th sections of \"An Act to regulate trade and intercourse with the Indian tribes,\" etc., approved June 30, 1834?\n\nOne thing is very certain, that by sending his messages and holding his talks in the Cherokee settlements, he more effectually disturbs the peace, and defeats or delays the measures of the Government of the United States, than he could if he were the citizen of a\n\nforeign Government, and much better than one of our own citizens possibly could do?**\n\nVery respectfully, I have the honor to be, your very obedient servant,\n\nBENJ.

But all who were present did not vote on either side, and many of those who were in favor of dividing the money, finding that their wishes could not be carried, voted it to the treasurer. Some of the voters in favor of a treaty, having claims on the Cherokee nation, voted, and influenced many others to vote, in the same way; so that the vote on Smith's resolution can not, properly, be considered a fair test of the strength of the parties.\n\nRidge's party is increasing rapidly, and will, by raising the proper means, reach the majority of Georgia, Ala bama and Tennessee, long before the adjournment of the next Congress.\n\nMost respectfully, I have the honor to be, your very obedient servant,\n\nBENJ.
