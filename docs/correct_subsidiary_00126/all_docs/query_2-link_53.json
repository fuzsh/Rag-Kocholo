        "text": "BUTLER, Pa. – Donald Trump and would-be assassin Thomas Crooks started on their violent collision course long before the former president's political rally ended in gunshots and death.\n\nCrooks, 20, was a one-time registered Republican, a nursing home worker with no criminal record, shy in school, and living in a decent middle-class neighborhood in suburban Pennsylvania with his parents. Trump, 78, was eyeing Crooks' state as a key battleground – but not in the way that anyone envisioned on Saturday.\n\nRiding high on polls showing that he's got a strong chance of toppling President Joe Biden, the former president had been campaigning for reelection in swing states, and Pennsylvania is a key prize. Trump won the state in 2016 but lost it four years later.\n\nAnd on July 3, Trump's campaign announced he would hold a rally at the Butler Farm Show grounds, about 30 miles north of Pittsburgh.\n\n\"Pennsylvania has been ravaged by monumental surges in violent crime as a direct result of Biden’s and Democrats’ pro-criminal policies,\" Trump's campaign said in announcing the event, noting that when he's elected, he'll \"re-establish law and order in Pennsylvania!\"\n\nThe Saturday attack on Trump turned the heated rhetoric of the 2024 presidential campaign freshly violent. Authorities said bullets fired from Crooks' AR-15 style rifle about 150 yards away grazed Trump's ear, killed a rally attendee as he dove to protect his family, and critically wounded two others. Secret Service agents killed Crooks moments later.\n\nAttack planned well in advance\n\nInvestigators are still seeking Crooks' motive – despite his Republican leanings, he had donated recently to a progressive voter-turnout campaign in 2021 – but indicated he'd planned the attack well in advance.\n\nThe shooting marks the first assassination attempt against a former or current U.S. president since President Ronald Reagan was injured in a March 1981 shooting at a Washington, D.C., hotel.\n\nThere are many questions about why Crooks turned into a would-be presidential assassin, firing indiscriminately into hordes of political supporters.\n\nFBI special agent Kevin Rojek said on a call with media that law enforcement located \"a suspicious device\" when they searched Crooks' vehicle and that it's being analyzed at the FBI crime lab.\n\n\"As far as the actions of the shooter immediately prior to the event and any interaction that he may have had with law enforcement, we're still trying to flesh out those details now,\" Rojek said.\n\nNone of Crooks' shocked neighbors or high school classmates described him as violent or that he in any way signaled he was intent on harming Trump. Sunday morning, reporters and curious locals swarmed the leafy streets of the home where Crooks lived with his parents in Bethel Park, about 50 miles from the shooting scene.\n\nThose who knew him described a quiet young man who often walked to work at a nearby nursing home. One classmate said he was bullied and often ate alone in high school.\n\nSunday morning, neighbor Cathy Caplan, 45, extended her morning walk about a quarter mile to glimpse what was happening outside Crooks’ home.“It came on the morning news and I was like ‘I know that street,’” said Caplan, who works for the local school district. \"It feels like something out of a movie.”\n\nDietary aide turned deadly killer\n\nAuthorities say they are examining Crooks' phone, social media and online activity for motivation. They said he carried no identification and his body had to be identified via DNA and biometric confirmation.\n\nAlthough no possible motive has yet been released, Crooks nevertheless embodies the achingly familiar profile of an American mass shooter: a young white man, isolated from peers and armed with a high-powered rifle. His attack was one of at least 59 shootings in the United States on Saturday, according to the Gun Violence Archive.\n\nAccording to records and online posts of the ceremony, Crooks graduated from Bethel Park High School, about 42 miles from Butler County, on June 3, 2022. That same day, Trump met briefly with investigators at his Mar-a-Lago club in Florida as they examined whether he improperly took classified documents with him when he left the White House.\n\nA classmate remembered Crooks as a frequent target of bullies. Kids picked on him for wearing camouflage to class and his quiet demeanor, Jason Kohler, 21, said. Crooks usually ate lunch alone, Kohler said.\n\nCrooks worked as a dietary aide at the Bethel Park Skilled Nursing and Rehabilitation, less than a mile from his home. In a statement provided to USA TODAY on Sunday, Marcie Grimm, the facility's administrator, said she was \"shocked and saddened to learn of his involvement.\"\n\nNeighbor Dean Sierka, 52, has known Crooks and his parents for years. The families live a few doors apart on a winding suburban street, and Sierka’s daughter, who attended elementary, middle and high school with Crooks, remembers him as quiet and shy. Sierka said they saw Crooks at least once a week, often when he was walking to the nursing home from his parents' three-bedroom brick house.\n\n\"You wouldn’t have expected this,\" Sierka said. \"The parents and the family are all really nice people.\"\n\n\"It's crazy,\" he added.\n\nSecret Service role: Did they do enough?\n\nFounded in 1865, the Secret Service is supposed to stop this kind of attack, and dozens of agents were present Saturday. As the former president and presumptive Republican presidential nominee, Trump's public appearances are managed by the Secret Service, which works with local law enforcement to develop security plans and crowd-management protocols.\n\nIn the days before the event, the agency's experts would have scouted the location, identified security vulnerabilities, and designed a perimeter to keep Trump and rally attendees safe. Congress and the Secret Service are now investigating how Crooks was able to get so close to the former president, and several witnesses reported seeing him in the area with the gun before Trump took the stage.\n\nAs the event doors opened at 1 p.m., the temperature was already pushing close to 90, and ticketed attendees oozed through metal detectors run by members of the Secret Service's uniformed division. Similar to airport security screenings, rallygoers emptied their pockets to prove they weren't carrying guns or other weapons.\n\nMedia reports indicate the Secret Service had in place, as usual, a counter-sniper team scanning the surrounding area for threats.\n\nIn an exclusive interview, former Secret Service Director Julia Pierson told USA TODAY that maintaining such a sniper security perimeter is part of the agency's responsibility for safeguarding protectees like Trump from harm. She said agents typically consider 1,000 yards to be the minimum safe distance for sniper attacks.\n\nThe Secret Service has confirmed that it is investigating how Crooks got so close to Trump, who took the stage shortly after 6 p.m. Officials say Crooks' rifle was legally obtained but have not yet released specifics.\n\nOutside the venue at that time, Greg Smith says he tried desperately to get the attention of police. He told the BBC that he and his friends saw a man crawling along a roof overlooking the rally. Other witnesses said they also saw a man atop the American Glass Research building outside the official event security perimeter, well within the range of a 5.56 rifle bullet.\n\n\"We noticed the guy bear-crawling up the roof of the building beside us, 50 feet away from us,\" Smith told the BBC. \"He had a rifle, we could clearly see him with a rifle.\"\n\nSmith told the BBC that the Secret Service eventually saw him and his friends pointing at the man on the roof.\n\n\"I'm thinking to myself, why is Trump still speaking, why have they not pulled him off the stage?\" Smith said. \"Next thing you know, five shots rang out.\"\n\nFrom his nearby deck, Trump supporter Pat English watched as the former president took the stage to Lee Greenwood's \"God Bless the U.S.A.,\" and attendees raised their cell phones to record.\n\nEnglish had taken his grandson to see the rally earlier but left when it got too hot. From his deck, they listened as Trump began speaking at 6:05 p.m., backed by a crown of red-hatted MAGA supporters waving \"fire Joe Biden\" signs.\n\nAnd then gunfire began.\n\nBoom, boom, boom\n\n\"I heard a 'boom, boom, boom' and then screams,” English said Sunday. \"I could see people running and the police run in.\"\n\nTrump was saying the word \"happened\" as the first pop rang out. He reached up to grab his ear as two more shots echoed, and the crowd behind him – and Trump himself – ducked. Plainclothes Secret Service agents piled atop the president as a fusillade of shots rang out, apparently the Secret Service killing Crooks.\n\nThe crowd screamed, and the venue's sound system picked up the agents atop Trump planning to move the former president to safety. One yelled, \"shooter's down. Let's move, let's move.\"\n\nThe agents then helped Trump back to his feet as they shielded him on all sides.\n\nThe sound system then picked up Trump's voice: \"Wait, wait,\" he said, before turning to the audience and triumphantly raising his fist to yell \"fight, fight\" as the crowd cheered, blood streaming down his face.\n\nBy 6:14 p.m. Trump's motorcade was racing from the scene, and in a later statement, Trump's campaign said he was checked out at a local medical facility.\n\n\"I was shot with a bullet that pierced the upper part of my right ear,\" Trump said in a statement. \"I knew immediately that something was wrong in that I heard a whizzing sound, shots, and immediately felt the bullet ripping through the skin. Much bleeding took place, so I realized then what was happening.\"\n\nFirefighter 'hero' gunned down\n\nOutside of the Butler Township Administration Office Sunday afternoon, Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro identified the rally attendee killed by Crooks as Corey Comperatore, a firefighter, father of two and longtime Trump supporter.\n\n“Corey died a hero,” Shapiro said. “Corey dove on his family to protect them last night at this rally. Corey was the very best of us. May his memory be a blessing.”\n\nTwo other Pennsylvanians are still undergoing treatment for their injuries, Shapiro said.\n\nPennsylvania State Police identified two wounded attendees David Dutch, 57, of New Kensington, and James Copenhaver, 74, of Moon Township. Both are hospitalized and listed in stable condition. Shapiro said he spoke with the family of one victim and received a message from the other.\n\nBiden spoke briefly with Trump on Saturday night, and the president condemned the assassination attempt as “sick.” He said there’s no place for political violence in the U.S. and called on Americans to unite together to condemn it.\n\nBut earlier in the week, Biden told campaign donors in a private phone call it was time to stop talking about his own disastrous presidential debate performance and start targeting Trump instead.\n\n\"I have one job and that's to beat Donald Trump,\" Biden said. \"We're done talking about the (June 27) debate. It's time to put Trump in the bullseye.\"\n\nRepublicans across the country have used similar language to attack their opponents over the years, and political scientists say violent rhetoric used worldwide almost invariably leads to physical violence.\n\nOn Sunday, someone parked a truck-mounted electronic billboard at the gates to the Butler Farm Show grounds reading \"Democrats attempted assassination,\" along with a picture of Trump clutching an American flag, his face overlaid with a bullseye crosshairs.\n\nAuthorities say they have not yet determined a motive for Crooks' attack. But in a statement, Trump declared the shooting an act of evil and thanked God for preventing the unthinkable.\n\n\"We will fear not, but instead remain resilient in our faith and defiant in the face of wickedness,\" Trump said.\n\nAnd he said he'd be back on the campaign trail for the Republican National Convention in Milwaukee, which starts Monday.\n\n\"Based on yesterday’s terrible events, I was going to delay my trip to Wisconsin, and the Republican National Convention, by two days,\" Trump said on his Truth Social account Sunday, \"but have just decided that I cannot allow a 'shooter,' or potential assassin, to force change to scheduling, or anything else.\"\n\nContributing: David Jackson, Aysha Bagchi, Christopher Cann, Bryce Buyakie, Emily Le Coz, Josh Meyer, USA TODAY Network"
