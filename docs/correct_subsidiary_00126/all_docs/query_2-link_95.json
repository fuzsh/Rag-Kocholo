        "text": "(Updated May 16, 2024)\n\nThe Housing and Civil Enforcement Section of the Civil Rights Division is responsible for the Department's enforcement of the Fair Housing Act (FHA), along with the Equal Credit Opportunity Act, the Servicemembers Civil Relief Act (SCRA), the land use provisions of the Religious Land Use and Institutionalized Persons Act (RLUIPA), Title II of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, and the Housing Rights subpart of the Violence Against Women Act Reauthorization Act of 2022 (VAWA 2022).\n\nUnder the FHA, the Department of Justice may bring lawsuits where there is reason to believe that a person or entity is engaged in a \"pattern or practice\" of discrimination or where a denial of rights to a group of persons raises an issue of general public importance. The Department of Justice also brings cases where a housing discrimination complaint has been investigated by the Department of Housing and Urban Development, HUD has issued a charge of discrimination, and one of the parties to the case has \"elected\" to go to federal court. In FHA cases, the Department can obtain injunctive relief, including affirmative requirements for training and policy changes, monetary damages and, in pattern or practice cases, civil penalties.\n\nSeveral cases we have filed or resolved recently exemplify our efforts to ensure the availability of the housing opportunities guaranteed by the Fair Housing Act. (1) The complaints and settlement documents for the cases discussed in the text, as well as other cases handled by the Housing Section, can be found on the Housing Section’s website at www.justice.gov/crt/about/hce/caselist.php.\n\nWhile we endeavor to ensure that the electronic copies of court documents available on this site are complete and accurate (apart from formatting changes necessitated by the conversion to HTML or PDF format), errors or omissions may occur. The official versions of court documents are the versions available from the court.\n\nFair Lending\n\nRental and Sales Discrimination based on Race, Color, National Origin, Familial Status and Religion\n\nSexual Harassment\n\nRental and Sales Discrimination based on Disability\n\nDesign and Construction\n\nDiscriminatory Land Use and Zoning\n\nPublic Accommodations (Title II)\n\nReligious Land Use and Institutionalized Persons Act (RLUIPA)\n\nServicemembers Civil Relief Act (SCRA)\n\nFair Lending\n\nOn February 13, 2024, the court entered a consent order in United States v. First National Bank of Pennsylvania, et al. (M.D.N.C.). The complaint, which was filed on February 5, 2024, by the United States and North Carolina Department of Justice, alleges that First National Bank of Pennsylvania (including as successor in interest to Yadkin Bank, which it acquired in 2017) violated the Equal Credit Opportunity Act and the Fair Housing Act by engaging in unlawful redlining in its service areas in the Charlotte and Winston-Salem, North Carolina markets. Specifically, among other things, the complaint alleges the bank located and maintained nearly all of its branches and mortgage loan officers outside of majority-Black and Hispanic neighborhoods, relied on mortgage loan officers concentrated in majority-white areas as the primary source of new loan applications, and maintained inadequate internal fair lending policies and procedures to ensure that the bank was positioned to provide equal access to majority-Black and Hispanic neighborhoods. As a result, the bank’s peers generated lending activity in those neighborhoods at two to four times the rate of other banks with similar lending volume. The consent order requires the defendant to invest at least $11.75 million in a loan subsidy fund to increase credit opportunities for residents of majority-Black and Hispanic neighborhoods in Charlotte and Winston-Salem; spend $1 million on community partnerships to provide services to residents of those neighborhoods; spend $750,000 for advertising, outreach, consumer financial education and credit counseling focused on those neighborhoods; open two new branches in majority-Black and Hispanic neighborhoods in Charlotte and one such branch in Winston-Salem; ensure that at least two mortgage bankers and two community homeownership specialists are assigned to solicit loan applications from majority-Black and Hispanic neighborhoods in Charlotte and Winston-Salem; and employ a Director of Community Lending who will oversee the continued development of lending in communities of color in North Carolina. First National Bank of Pennsylvania also agreed to complete a community credit needs assessment, to assess and report on its fair lending program; and to train staff on the bank’s obligations under the consent order.\n\nOn January 30, 2024, the court entered a consent order in United States v. Patriot Bank (W.D. Tenn.). The complaint, which was filed January 17, 2024, alleged violations of the Fair Housing Act (FHA) and the Equal Credit Opportunity Act (ECOA) specifically that, from 2015 through 2020, Patriot Bank engaged in unlawful redlining in its self-designated service area in Memphis, Tennessee and discriminated on the basis of race, color, or national origin. The consent order requires Patriot to invest at least $1.3 million in a loan subsidy fund to increase access to home mortgage, home improvement, and home refinance loans for residents of majority-Black and Hispanic neighborhoods in Memphis. Additionally, in those same neighborhoods, Patriot will spend at least $375,000 for advertising, outreach, and consumer financial education and counseling; spend $225,000 to develop community partnerships to provide services that increase access to residential mortgage credit; employ two loan officers dedicated to serving those communities of color in Memphis and a Director of Community Lending who will oversee the continued development of lending in those communities; and continually assess the credit needs of the communities.\n\nOn December 20, 2023, the United States and the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau jointly filed a complaint in Consumer Financial Protection Bureau v. Colony Ridge (S.D. Tex). The complaint alleges that Colony Ridge LLC and its affiliated companies violated the Equal Credit Opportunity Act (ECOA) and the Fair Housing Act (FHA), as well as other consumer protection statutes, by operating an illegal land sales scheme targeting tens of thousands of Hispanic borrowers with false statements and predatory loans.\n\nOn November 7, 2023, the court entered a consent order in United States v. Ameris Bank (M.D. Fla.). The complaint, which was filed on October 19, 2023, alleged that Ameris Bank violated the Equal Credit Opportunity Act (ECOA) and the Fair Housing Act (FHA) by engaging in unlawful redlining in the bank’s Jacksonville, Florida service area. The Department’s complaint alleges that, from 2016 through 2021, Ameris Bank avoided providing mortgage services to majority-Black and Hispanic neighborhoods in Jacksonville and discouraged people seeking credit in those communities from obtaining home loans. Ameris’ home mortgage lending was focused disproportionately on white areas of Jacksonville while other lenders generated applications in majority-Black and Hispanic neighborhoods at three times the rate of Ameris. Additionally, although Ameris operates 18 branches in Jacksonville, Ameris has never operated a branch in a majority-Black and Hispanic neighborhood in the city. The consent order requires Ameris to invest at least $7.5 million in a loan subsidy fund to increase access to home mortgage, home improvement, and home refinance for residents of majority-Black and Hispanic neighborhoods in Jacksonville. Additionally, in those same neighborhoods, Ameris will spend $900,000 for advertising, outreach, and consumer financial education; spend $600,000 to develop community partnerships to provide services that increase access to residential mortgage credit; open a new branch; ensure at least three mortgage loan officers are dedicated to serving those communities; and employ a Director of Community Lending who will oversee the continued development of lending in communities of color in Jacksonville. Ameris will also retain a consultant to assess the bank’s compliance management system as it pertains to redlining risk across all of its markets.\n\nOn October 31, 2023, the court entered a consent order in United States v. Washington Trust Company (D.R.I.). The complaint, which was filed on September 27, 2023, alleged that Washington Trust violated the Equal Credit Opportunity Act and the Fair Housing Act by engaging in unlawful redlining in the State of Rhode Island. Specifically, the complaint alleged that despite expansion across the state of Rhode Island, Washington Trust has never opened a branch in a majority-Black and Hispanic neighborhood, relied on mortgage loan officers working out of only majority-white areas as the primary source for generating loan applications, and failed to train or incentivize its lending staff or conduct outreach, marketing and advertising of its mortgage services to compensate for its lack of branches and presence in majority-Black and Hispanic areas. The consent order requires the defendant(s) to invest at least $7 million in a loan subsidy fund to increase access to home mortgage, home improvement, home refinance and home equity loans and lines of credit for residents of majority-Black and Hispanic neighborhoods in Rhode Island; spend $1 million on community partnerships to provide services that increase residential mortgage credit access for residents of those neighborhoods; spend $1 million for advertising, outreach, consumer financial education and credit counseling focused on majority-Black and Hispanic neighborhoods; open two new branches in majority-Black and Hispanic neighborhoods in Rhode Island; and ensure at least two mortgage loan officers are dedicated to serving these neighborhoods; and employ a Director of Community Lending who will oversee the continued development of lending in communities of color. Washington Trust also agreed to complete a community credit needs assessment, to assess and report on its fair lending program; and to train staff on the bank’s obligations under the consent order.\n\nOn October 4, 2023, the court entered a consent order in U.S. v. American Bank of Oklahoma (N.D. Okla.). The complaint, which was filed on August 28, 2023, alleges that American Bank of Oklahoma violated the Equal Credit Opportunity Act (ECOA) and the Fair Housing Act (FHA) by engaging in unlawful redlining in the Tulsa, Oklahoma Metropolitan Statistical Area. Specifically, the complaint alleged that the defendant refrained from providing mortgage services to majority-Black and Hispanic neighborhoods and discouraged prospective applicants from those neighborhoods from applying for credit. The consent order requires American Bank of Oklahoma to invest at least $950,000 in a loan subsidy fund to increase access to credit in majority-Black and Hispanic neighborhoods; spend $100,000 on community partnerships to provide services that increase access to residential mortgage credit; and spend $100,000 on advertising, outreach, and consumer financial education in majority-Black and Hispanic communities. The consent order also requires American Bank of Oklahoma to open a loan production office in a Black and Hispanic census tract which will provide access to mortgage services and a community room available to the public; ensure at least two mortgage loan officers are dedicated to serving majority-Black and Hispanic neighborhoods in Tulsa; and conduct a research-based market study to help identify the needs for financial services in majority-Black and Hispanic neighborhoods in Tulsa.\n\nOn August 2, 2023, the Court issued an Opinion granting in part and denying in part defendants’ motions to dismiss in Connolly v. Lanham (D. Md.), a private lawsuit brought under the Fair Housing Act (FHA), the Equal Credit Opportunity Act (ECOA), and other laws. The complaint in the case alleges that an appraiser and a lender violated the FHA and ECOA by lowering the valuation of a home because the owners were Black and by denying a mortgage refinancing application based on that appraisal. On March 13, 2023, the Justice Department and the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau filed a Statement of Interest explaining that it is illegal for a lender to rely on an appraisal that it knows or should know to be discriminatory and providing guidance on pleading standards under the FHA and ECOA. The Court agreed that a lender violates the law by relying on an appraisal that it knows or should know to be discriminatory, adopted the pleading standards in the Statement of Interest, and held that plaintiffs stated claims for relief under ECOA and multiple provisions of the FHA.\n\nOn June 9, 2023, the court entered a consent order in United States v. ESSA Bank & Trust (E.D. Pa.). The complaint, which was filed on May 31, 2023, alleges that ESSA violated the Equal Credit Opportunity Act (ECOA) and the Fair Housing Act (FHA) by engaging in unlawful redlining in the Philadelphia Metropolitan Statistical Area by avoiding providing mortgage services to majority-Black and Hispanic neighborhoods and discouraging prospective applicants from those neighborhoods from applying for credit. The consent order requires ESSA to: (1) invest at least $2.92 million in a loan subsidy fund to increase access to credit in majority-Black and Hispanic neighborhoods; (2) spend an additional $125,000 on community partnerships and $250,000 on advertising, outreach, consumer financial education, and credit counseling in majority-Black and Hispanic communities; (3) hire two new mortgage loan officers to serve its existing branches in West Philadelphia; and (4) conduct a research-based market study to help identify the needs for financial services in communities of color.\n\nOn March 2, 2023, the court entered a consent order in United States v. Park National Bank (S.D. Ohio). The complaint, which was filed on February 28, 2023, alleges that, from at least 2015 to 2021, Park National Bank (Park National) violated the Fair Housing Act and the Equal Credit Opportunity Act on the basis of race, color, and national origin by engaging in unlawful redlining of predominantly Black and Hispanic neighborhoods within the Columbus, Ohio metropolitan area. The consent order requires Park National to invest at least $7.75 million in a loan subsidy fund to increase access to credit in majority-Black and Hispanic neighborhoods in the Columbus area; $750,000 in outreach, advertising, consumer financial education, and credit counseling initiatives; and $500,000 in developing community partnerships to provide services that expand access to residential mortgage credit. Park National will also open a new branch and a new loan production office in majority-Black and Hispanic neighborhoods and ensure that a minimum of four mortgage lenders, at least one of whom is Spanish-speaking, are assigned to serve these areas.\n\nOn January 31, 2023, the court entered a consent order in United States v. City National Bank (C.D. Cal.). On January 12, 2023, the United States filed a complaint alleging that City National Bank (City National), violated the Equal Credit Opportunity Act (ECOA) and the Fair Housing Act (FHA) by engaging in unlawful redlining in the Los Angeles Metropolitan Division (Los Angeles County) by avoiding providing credit services to majority-Black and Hispanic neighborhoods because of the race, color, and national origin of the people living in those neighborhoods. The consent order requires City National to invest at least $29.5 million in a loan subsidy fund for residents of majority-Black and Hispanic neighborhoods in Los Angeles County; invest $750,000 for development of community partnerships to provide services that increase access to residential mortgage credit in those neighborhoods; invest $500,000 for advertising and outreach in those neighborhoods; and invest $500,000 for consumer financial education.\n\nOn October 17, 2022, the court entered a consent order in United States v. Evolve Bank and Trust (W.D. Tenn.). The complaint, which was filed on September 29, 2022, alleges that from at least 2014 through 2019, the bank engaged in lending discrimination on the basis of race, sex and national origin in the pricing of its residential mortgage loans. The consent order requires the bank to amend its pricing policies, employ a fair lending officer who will work closely with the bank’s leadership, and have employees undergo fair lending training. The consent order also includes a $1.3 million settlement fund to remediate borrowers harmed by this pricing discrimination and a $50,000 civil penalty.\n\nOn September 29, 2022, the court approved the entry of consent order in United States v. Lakeland Bank (D.N.J.). The complaint, which was filed on September 28, 2022, alleged that from at least 2015 to 2021, Lakeland violated the Fair Housing Act and Equal Credit Opportunity Act on the basis of race, color, and national origin by failing to provide mortgage lending services to Black and Hispanic neighborhoods in the Newark, New Jersey, metropolitan area. The complaint also alleges that all of Lakeland’s branches were located in majority-white neighborhoods and that its loan officers did not serve the credit needs of Black and Hispanic neighborhoods in and around Newark. Under the settlement, the Bank will invest at least $12 million in a loan subsidy fund for residents of Black and Hispanic neighborhoods in the Newark area; $750,000 for advertising, outreach and consumer education; and $400,000 for development of community partnerships to provide services that increase access to residential mortgage credit. Lakeland will also open two new branches in Black and Hispanic neighborhoods, including at least one in the city of Newark; ensure at least four mortgage loan officers are dedicated to serving all neighborhoods in and around Newark; employ a full-time Community Development Officer who will oversee the continued development of lending in Black and Hispanic neighborhoods in the Newark area; and maintain an expanded Community Reinvestment Act Assessment Area that includes Essex, Somerset and Union counties.\n\nOn September 14, 2022, the court entered a consent order in United States v. Trident Mortgage Company, Inc. (E.D. Pa.). The complaint, which was filed jointly by the United States and the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau on July 27, 2022, alleges that Trident Mortgage Company (Trident), which is owned by Berkshire Hathaway, Inc., violated the Equal Credit Opportunity Act (ECOA), the Fair Housing Act (FHA), and Consumer Financial Protection Act (CFPA), by engaging in unlawful redlining in the Philadelphia metropolitan area by avoiding providing credit services to neighborhoods of color because of the race, color, and national origin of the people living in those neighborhoods. The complaint also alleges that Trident’s loan officers and other employees sent and received work e-mails containing racial slurs and referring to communities of color as “ghetto.” The consent order requires the defendant to invest at least $18.4 million in a loan subsidy fund for residents of predominantly neighborhoods of color in the Philadelphia metropolitan area; invest $750,000 for development of community partnerships to provide services that increase access to residential mortgage credit in those neighborhoods; invest $875,000 for advertising and outreach in those neighborhoods; and invest $375,000 for consumer financial education. Trident will also pay a civil money penalty of $4 million.\n\nRental and Sales Discrimination based on Race, Color, National Origin, Familial Status and Religion:\n\nOn April 2, 2024, the United States filed a Statement of Interest in DHD Jessamine, LLC v. Florence County, South Carolina, et al. (D.S.C.), a case that includes claims brought under the Fair Housing Act (FHA), Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, the U.S. Constitution, and state law. The Plaintiff alleges, in part, that Defendants violated the FHA when Florence County passed an ordinance to prevent the development of Plaintiff’s proposed Low-Income Housing Tax Credit apartment complex based on discriminatory objections raised by community members. Defendants moved for summary judgment on all of Plaintiff’s claims. In its Statement of Interest, the United States argues that the Defendants are not entitled to summary judgment on Plaintiff’s FHA claims. First, the United States explains that Defendants misstate the legal standard for assessing disparate treatment FHA claims and that Plaintiff has put forth circumstantial evidence that may be indicative of discriminatory animus. Next, the United States explains the correct legal framework for assessing disparate impact FHA claims. Applying the correct legal standard, Florence County’s ordinance is the kind of “policy” that may cause a disparate impact, and Defendants fail to counter Plaintiff’s arguments and evidence that Florence County’s ordinance was passed for illegitimate reasons and disproportionately affects Black residents.\n\nOn January 8, 2024, the court entered consent decrees resolving the Department’s claims against each of the three defendants in United States v. Isle of Paradise \"B\", Inc., Isle of Paradise \"C\", Inc., and Isle of Paradise \"E\", Inc. (S.D. Fla.). The complaint in this Fair Housing Act pattern or practice lawsuit, which was filed on November 30, 2023, alleges that the defendants—nonprofit cooperative corporations that each own a residential building on an island known as Isle of Paradise in Hallandale Beach, Florida—discriminated on the basis of familial status in violation of the Fair Housing Act (FHA) by maintaining and/or enforcing a no-children-under-12 policy. The consent decrees require defendants to remove their no-children-under-12 policy (except that one defendant, Isle of Paradise “C”, Inc., can instead show that it is exempt as housing for older persons); to undergo other standard injunctive relief; and to pay a total of $52,000 in monetary relief, composed of $20,000 in damages to a mother and son who were turned away and $6,000 to their real estate agent, $13,000 in settlement funds, and $13,000 in civil penalties.\n\nOn July 17, 2023, the United States filed a Fair Housing Act complaint in United States v. Teruel (N.D. Cal). The complaint alleges that the manager of a two-story, seven-unit apartment complex in Burlingame, California, discriminated on the basis of familial status in violation of 42 U.S.C. §§ 3604(a), (b), (c) and 3617 by pressuring a couple, who had two babies during their tenancy, to move out of their one-bedroom apartment and then falsely accusing the family of causing significant damage to the unit after the family moved out. The case was referred to the Division after the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development received a complaint, conducted an investigation, and issued a charge of discrimination.\n\nOn June 27, 2023, the United States filed a Statement of Interest in Shen v. Simpson (N.D. Fla.), a lawsuit challenging provisions of a new Florida law, SB 264. Among other things, the law prohibits individuals who are “domiciled” in certain foreign countries, particularly China, from purchasing real property in the state; sellers of real property and individuals who own or acquire real property in violation of the law may be subject to civil and criminal penalties. In its filing, the United States supports the ACLU’s motion to enjoin implementation of these provisions. The brief explains that SB 264’s property ownership restrictions violate the Fair Housing Act because they discriminate based on a person’s national origin and violate the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment because the restrictions are not narrowly tailored to serve any compelling government interest. The United States Attorneys in all three Florida judicial districts signed on to the brief.\n\nOn April 6 and 10, 2023, the court entered two proposed consent orders to resolve claims against all defendants in United States v. Louis Liberty & Associates, PLC, et al. (N.D. Cal.), a Fair Housing Act (FHA) “election” case. The complaint, filed on September 30, 2022, alleges that the defendants discriminated on the basis of national origin in violation of the FHA by targeting Hispanics for predatory loan modification services. Louis A. Liberty and Barney Diamos were also named as a defendant in the case. The case was referred to the Division after the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) received a complaint, conducted an investigation, and issued a charge of discrimination.\n\nOn April 10, 2023, the court entered a consent order in United States v. Concord Court at Creative Village Partners, LTD, et al. (M.D. Fla.). The complaint, which was filed on October 6, 2022, alleges that the defendants discriminated against families with children in violation of the Fair Housing Act by refusing to issue building access devices to minor residents, prohibiting children from common areas and amenities unless supervised by adults, and misrepresenting the availability of units to families with children at an apartment complex in Orlando, Florida. The consent order requires the defendants to pay $260,000 to residents who were harmed by their practices and a civil penalty to the United States. The defendants will also implement nondiscrimination policies and provide fair housing training to employees with management or leasing responsibilities at all the residential rental properties they own or operate in Florida. The case was referred to the Division after the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) received several complaints, conducted an investigation, and issued multiple charges of discrimination.\n\nOn March 27, 2023, the United States filed a Statement of Interest in Lost Lake Holdings, LLC v. Town of Forestburgh (S.D.N.Y.), a private lawsuit alleging discrimination based on religion under the Fair Housing Act. The lawsuit alleges that the Town of Forestburgh and other municipal defendants engaged in a series of discriminatory acts to prevent an Orthodox Jewish developer from building a subdivision in Forestburgh because the defendants believed that it would attract Orthodox Jews. The statement argues that the plaintiffs’ Fair Housing Act claims, premised in part on the Zoning Board of Appeals’ denial of their building permit applications, are ripe and that the plaintiffs, who alleged lost profits and lost home sales, have standing to assert their FHA claims.\n\nOn January 9, 2023, the United States filed a Statement of Interest in Louis et al. v. SafeRent, et al. (D. Mass.), a case brought under the Fair Housing Act (FHA). The Louis lawsuit was filed on behalf of two plaintiffs, Mary Louis and Monica Douglas, Black rental applicants who use housing vouchers to pay part of their rent. Plaintiffs applied for rental housing but allege they were denied due to their “SafeRent Score,” a score derived from Defendant SafeRent’s algorithm-based screening software. The plaintiffs allege that SafeRent scores result in an unlawful disparate impact against Black and Hispanic rental applicants because the underlying algorithm relies on certain factors that disproportionately disadvantage Black and Hispanic applicants, such as credit history and non-tenancy related debts, while failing to consider one highly-relevant factor, that the use of housing vouchers funded by HUD makes such tenants more likely to pay their rents. In its Statement of Interest, the United States sets out the appropriate standard for pleading disparate impact claims under the FHA and clarifies that the FHA’s text and caselaw support the FHA’s application to companies providing residential screening services.\n\nOn December 27, 2022, the court entered a consent order in United States v. City of Hesperia, et al. (C.D. Cal.). The supplemental complaint, filed on July 22, 2021, alleged that the City of Hesperia and the San Bernardino County Sheriff’s Department engaged in a pattern or practice of discrimination against Black and Latinx individuals and communities in Hesperia, in violation of the Fair Housing Act and Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, through the adoption and enforcement of a so-called “crime-free” rental housing program. The original complaint was filed on December 2, 2019, and an amended complaint was filed on September 10, 2020. The amended complaint added a Title VI claim against the City. The supplemental complaint added factual allegations concerning a rental housing law that the City adopted during the litigation. As part of the case’s resolution, Hesperia has repealed its “crime-free” ordinance, modified the related rental housing business license ordinance, and reduced fees associated with rental housing business licenses. The Sheriff’s Department also has agreed to stop enforcement of Hesperia’s “crime-free” program. Under the order, the defendants will spend $950,000 and commit to injunctive relief, including: a settlement fund of $670,000 to compensate individuals harmed by the program; the payment of $100,000 in civil penalties; affirmative marketing to promote fair housing in Hesperia; partnerships with community-based organizations; notifications to property managers, landlords, and owners of the changes to the ordinances and fee schedule; submission of certain policies, procedures, and ordinances for the United States’ review and approval; adoption of non-discrimination policies and complaint procedures; designation of civil rights coordinators; anti-discrimination training; a fair housing needs assessment; and reporting to the court and the United States during the order’s five-year term.\n\nOn December 13, 2022, the court entered a consent decree in United States v. Housing Authority of Ashland, AL, et al. (N.D. Ala.). After filing a complaint on December 1, 2020, the United States filed an amended complaint on January 25, 2021, alleging that the Ashland Housing Authority engaged in a pattern or practice of discrimination and denied rights to a group of persons on the basis of race, in violation of the Fair Housing Act, by steering Black applicants away from four overwhelmingly white properties that it manages and steering White applicants away from two disproportionately Black properties that it manages, and by maintaining those properties as largely segregated. The complaint also named as defendants the private owners and agent of two of these properties. The consent decree requires the defendants to pay $275,000 in damages to 23 current or former tenants who were allegedly harmed by the defendants’ conduct; pay a $10,000 civil penalty to the United States; implement policies and procedures to remedy the alleged segregation and to ensure nondiscrimination, transparency, and consistency in processing applications and offering units to applicants; contact a group of approximately 145 individuals who are disproportionately Black who applied to two overwhelmingly white properties but were not placed on the waiting lists for those properties, and offer them spots on the waiting list based on their original dates of application if they still qualify; undergo fair-housing training; and submit periodic compliance reports to the Justice Department.\n\nOn November 1, 2022, the court entered a consent decree in United States v. SSM Properties, LLC, et al. (S.D. Miss.). The complaint, which was filed on November 11, 2020, alleged that the owners and manager of three apartment complexes in Pearl, Mississippi discriminated on the basis of race by steering Black testers toward one complex and falsely representing that the other two complexes did not have vacancies. On August 3, 2022, the court granted the United States’ motion for summary judgment on liability, finding, as a matter of law, that the defendants violated the Fair Housing Act. The consent decree requires the defendants to pay $110,000 in damages and attorneys’ fees and $13,000 in civil penalties; prohibits the manager-defendant from working at any residential rental property; and requires the owner-defendants to hire an independent manager, implement nondiscriminatory standards and procedures, undergo fair housing training and provide periodic reports to the Department.\n\nOn September 12, 2022, the Division filed a statement of interest in Fair Housing Center of Central Indiana, et al. v. Rainbow Realty Group, et al. (S.D. Ind.). The plaintiffs challenge defendants’ “rent-to-buy” program in Indianapolis, Indiana, alleging that it exploits consumers in predominantly Black and Hispanic neighborhoods by selling properties in poor condition at inflated prices through contracts that are designed to fail. The statement of interest aims to assist the court in evaluating plaintiffs’ Equal Credit Opportunity Act (ECOA) claims. The court dismissed plaintiffs’ ECOA claims on summary judgment, and plaintiffs filed a motion for reconsideration. The brief explains that a contract can both be a lease and also be an “aspect of a credit transaction” for purposes of ECOA. The brief analyzes the record using the definitions in ECOA, concluding that there is sufficient evidence to find that the rent-to-buy agreement used by defendants may extend “credit” as defined by ECOA, and that defendants may fall within ECOA’s definition of “creditor.”\n\nOn July 8, 2022, the Court denied the Defendant’s motion to dismiss in CNY Fair Housing v. Swiss Village LLC, et al. (N.D.N.Y.), a lawsuit alleging that the defendants violated the Fair Housing Act by refusing to rent apartments to applicants who are limited English proficient (LEP) unless someone who speaks and reads English lives in the unit. On April 1, 2022, the Department filed a Statement of Interest explaining how a restrictive language policy may violate the Fair Housing Act when it has a disparate impact or is used as a proxy or pretext for discrimination based on national origin or race, as alleged in plaintiff’s complaint. It also discussed how the plaintiff’s allegations are consistent with the Department of Housing and Urban Development’s Guidance on Fair Housing Act Protections for Persons with Limited English Proficiency, which clarifies how restrictive language policies may run afoul of the Fair Housing Act. The Court first found that, contrary to the Defendant’s position, the HUD LEP Guidance did not assert that LEP status alone is a protected class under the FHA, but rather that language criteria may be evidence of discrimination, the same as any other potentially discriminatory criteria. The Court held that the HUD LEP Guidance was “persuasive and entitled to deference” because it was consistent with case law regarding the use of language as a proxy for race and national original, was consistent with other HUD Guidance, and that the Fourth Circuit had given it deference in a recent case, Reyes v. Waples Mobile Home Park LP, 903 F.3d 415, 432 & n.10 (4th Cir. 2018). The Court also found that the Complaint alleged sufficient facts to state a disparate impact claim (it repeated statistical Census data allegations regarding national origin and race made in the Complaint). The Court found that the Complaint stated a claim for intentional discrimination in that “[d]iscriminatory intent may be inferred from the totality of the circumstances, and this Court discerns no reason why” that “would not include evidence of a language policy being used as a proxy for discrimination on the basis of national origin or race.” Finally, the Court held that a “Plaintiff does not need to identify the specific national origin or race of particular tenants in order to state a prima facie case of discrimination under the FHA” and that “neither disparate impact nor discriminatory statement claims require a showing that Defendants were aware of the national origin or race of the prospective tenants.”\n\nOn June 26, 2022, the court approved the parties’ settlement agreement and entered a final judgment in United States v. Meta Platforms, Inc., f/k/a Facebook, Inc. (S.D.N.Y.). The complaint, which was filed on June 21, 2022, alleged that Meta’s housing advertising system discriminated against Facebook users based on their race, color, religion, sex, disability, familial status, and national origin, in violation of the Fair Housing Act (FHA). Specifically, the complaint alleged, among other things, that Meta uses algorithms in determining which Facebook users receive housing ads and that those algorithms rely, in part, on characteristics protected under the FHA. Under the settlement, which was approved by the court, Meta will stop using an advertising tool for housing ads (known as the “Special Ad Audience” tool) and also will develop a new system to address racial and other disparities caused by its use of personalization algorithms in its ad delivery system for housing ads. Under the terms of the settlement, Meta will not provide any ad targeting options for housing advertisers that directly describe or relate to FHA-protected characteristics. The settlement also requires Meta to pay a civil penalty of $115,054, the maximum penalty available under the FHA. The case involves a Secretary-initiated HUD complaint and was referred to the Justice Department after the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) conducted an investigation and issued a charge of discrimination.\n\nOn June 10, 2022, the Court entered a consent order in United States v. Advocate Law Groups of Florida, P.A. (M.D. Fla.). The second amended complaint, which was filed on August 16, 2021, alleges that Advocate Law Groups of Florida, P.A., Jon B. Lindeman, Jr., Ephigenia K. Lindeman, Summit Development Solutions USA, LLC, and Haralampos “Bob” Kourouklis violated the Fair Housing Act by interfering with Hispanic homeowners’ exercise of their fair housing rights by targeting Hispanic homeowners for a predatory mortgage modification and foreclosure rescue scheme. As part of the scheme, defendants charged Hispanic homeowners thousands of dollars for their mortgage modification services, instructed Hispanic homeowners to stop paying their mortgages, and instructed them to stop communicating with their lenders. But defendants did little to provide the promised services, resulting in homeowners paying thousands of dollars in fees with no benefit, and, in many cases, resulting in foreclosures and the loss of homes. The original complaint was filed on October 29, 2018. The Consent Order permanently enjoins defendants from providing any mortgage relief assistance services, requires them to implement nondiscriminatory policies in all real estate-related businesses, and requires reporting and recordkeeping. The Consent Order requires defendants to pay $95,000 to three Plaintiff-Intervenors and enters a $4,500,000 judgment, which is suspended based on sworn financial statements showing inability to pay submitted by defendants to the Department. Defendants will be required to resubmit financial statements every six months, and, if any material misrepresentation or omission is found, the entire judgment will be reinstated. Defendants must also pay a $5,000 civil penalty to the United States.\n\nOn May 27, 2022, the court entered a consent order in United States v. Crimson Management, LLC, Benefield Housing Partnership d/b/a Cedartown Commons, and Cedartown Housing Association, d/b/a Cedarwood Village (N.D. Ga.). The complaint, filed on May 13, 2020, alleged that the defendants violated the Fair Housing Act by discriminating on the bases of race and color when they steered African-American housing applicants who were elderly and/or had a disability away from Cedarwood Village, a predominantly white housing complex for elderly persons and persons with disabilities, to less desirable units at Cedartown Commons, a predominantly African-American general occupancy complex. The complaint also alleged that defendants maintained and perpetuated racial segregation of the elderly and disabled population at Cedarwood Village and Cedartown Commons. The consent order requires the defendants to pay $83,000 in damages to three former tenants who were harmed as a result of the defendants’ racial steering, pay a civil penalty to the United States, implement nondiscriminatory policies and procedures, complete fair-housing training, and submit periodic reports to the Justice Department.\n\nOn February 28, 2022, the court entered a consent order in United States v. Orchard Village, LLC, et al. (E.D. Mo.). The complaint, filed on May 28, 2021, alleged that the defendants discriminated against the complainants on the basis of familial status by imposing overly restrictive policies on families with children, including prohibiting children under the age of 18 from accessing the computer room, on-site movie theater, fitness center, or pool at the apartment complex without being accompanied by an adult leaseholder. The complaint also alleges that the defendants interfered with the complainants’ fair housing rights by ejecting complainant’s 16-year-old daughter from those facilities and issuing complainants a lease violation notice and notice of eviction based in part on the daughter’s access of those amenities. The consent order requires the defendants to pay $16,000 to the complainants and adopt new rules and policies regarding access to amenities at 24 residential rental properties that Defendants own, operate, and manage that comply with the Fair Housing Act. The case was referred to the Division after the Department of Housing and Urban Development received a complaint, conducted an investigation, and issued a charge of discrimination.\n\nOn February 14, 2022, the Department filed a statement of interest in Austin, et al. v. Miller, et al. (N.D. Cal.), a private lawsuit alleging that defendants violated the Fair Housing Act by discriminating on the basis of race in connection to a residential home appraisal. The statement of interest explains that appraisers may be liable under the Fair Housing Act and provides guidance on pleading and proof standards for Fair Housing Act claims.\n\nOn February 1, 2022, the court entered a consent order in United States v. Bacchus (E.D. Pa.). The complaint, which was filed on August 18, 2021, alleges that defendants discriminated on the basis of familial status and disability related to their refusal to allow the complainant, who was recovering from addiction to alcohol, to move his pregnant girlfriend and her child into his unit. Under the consent order, the defendants will pay a total of $75,000 to the complainant and his child and take actions directed towards preventing future unlawful discrimination, including undergoing training and implementing nondiscrimination policies on the FHA in connection with the rental and management of residential properties. The case was referred to the Division after the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) received a complaint, conducted an investigation, and issued a charge of discrimination.\n\nOn January 18, 2022, the court entered a consent order in United States v. City of Arlington (N.D. Tex.). The complaint, filed on January 13, 2022, alleged that the City of Arlington, Texas violated the Fair Housing Act (FHA) by discriminating on the basis of familial status when it blocked the development of an affordable housing project for families with children that had been proposed by a developer, Community Development, Inc. (CDI), and would have been financed using federal Low-Income Housing Tax Credits (LIHTC). The complaint alleged that the City refused to issue a Resolution of Support or a Resolution of No Objection to CDI because the City had a policy of supporting LIHTC developments only for new senior housing intended for persons 55 years of age or older. Under the consent order, the City will pay $395,000 in damages to CDI, maintain a non-discrimination policy for future LIHTC developments, provide Fair Housing Act training to certain city officials, and submit to compliance and reporting requirements for three years. This case was referred to the Division after the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) received a complaint, conducted an investigation, and issued a charge of discrimination.\n\nSexual Harassment:\n\nOn May 2, 2024, the court entered a consent order in United States v. Leaf Property Investments, LLC (E.D. Wis.). The complaint, which was filed on September 9, 2022, alleged that Dennis Parker, the on-site manager of a 19-unit rooming house in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, violated the Fair Housing Act by harassing a male tenant because of the tenant’s sex, including the tenant’s sexual orientation, and because of the tenant’s disability. The complaint alleges that Defendant Parker engaged in verbal and virtual harassment, as well as one instance of punching the tenant in the groin and threatening to evict him in retaliation for reporting the harassment to the police. The complaint also named as defendants Leaf Property Investments, LLC and Sam Leaf (the “Leaf defendants”), who own the property where the harassment occurred. The case was referred to the Division after the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) received a complaint from the complaint, conducted an investigation, and issued a charge of discrimination, and the tenant elected to have the matter litigated in federal court.

In its Statement of Interest, the United States explains the well-established principle that Section 3604(b) of the FHA prohibits post-acquisition sexual harassment and is not limited only to conduct during the process of acquiring or renting property, argues that a state statute cannot immunize a public housing authority from a federal FHA claim, and addresses the proper standard for holding a defendant vicariously liable under the FHA.\n\nOn September 6, 2023, the United States filed a complaint in United States v.
