        "text": "Do your clients own or are they considering buying a holiday home or an additional property for frequent visits? With holiday home insurance your clients' property can benefit from added protection against damage, theft and other risks. Whether it’s for weekends away with the family or a base for friends to stop-by, second homes open up opportunities such as second income from letting out the property during unoccupied periods. However, they may also want to consider putting suitable safeguards in place for their property. At Intasure, we offer holiday home insurance in the UK and across 19 countries throughout the EU and beyond. Speak to us about securing cover for a variety of property types – from luxury villas to apartments, barns, and chalets for your client. Contact us to find out more by speaking to our business development team by emailing us at brokerteam@intasure.com or calling 01892 239 370. #holidayhomeinsurance #secondproperties #propertyspecialists\n\nIf your client owns a holiday home abroad and it is unoccupied for long periods, they may be concerned about how secure it is. There are several ways of potentially minimising the risk of burglaries or serious damage. The best way to help prevent potential burglars or squatters is to ensure the property is secured, by ensuring that there are adequate heavy-duty locks on doors, windows, and gates. If the property has window shutters, your clients should make sure they are closed and locked securely while they are away. To learn more, speak to our business development team by emailing us at brokerteam@intasure.com #squatters #propertyinsurance #unoccupiedproperties\n\nDo you have clients who are preparing to leave a property unoccupied? Are they aware of the steps they could take to reduce the risk of damage to the property during the period it is being left unoccupied? According to the Office for National Statistics, 89.7% of the unoccupied dwellings recorded in England are truly vacant and 10.3% are second properties with no permanent resident. We outlined tips on how to safeguard an empty property and ensure your client’s property is safe and secure.
