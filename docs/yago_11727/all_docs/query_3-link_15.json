        "text": "For decades, families have been treated to holiday cheer each year with their favorite animated classics featuring Rudolph, Frosty, Santa, and a whole host of eclectic characters thanks to the work of Rankin/Bass Productions. Arthur Rankin Jr. and Jules Bass founded the company, originally known as Videocraft International, in 1960, after the duo met working at ABC as ​​an art director and copywriter, respectively.\n\nTheir first stop-motion series was The New Adventures of Pinocchio. After renaming themselves as Rankin/Bass Productions, the two enjoyed a long stretch of directing beloved holiday classics, animated series, and fantasy films that we have grown to love. Perhaps best known for their distinguished stop-motion specials that have been parodied and honored since the company shut down in 1987, Rankin/Bass also worked with Japanese animation studios on fantasy specials and TV shows and delved into some live-action small-screen endeavors. Bass died in October 2022, leaving behind the legacy of these shows and films alongside his late partner (Rankin died in January 2014).\n\nTo honor the memory of the studio behind these beloved, timeless productions, EW takes a look at the best Rankin/Bass specials.\n\n01 of 12\n\nRudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer (1964)\n\nPerhaps the most famous Rankin/Bass production and one of the most iconic Christmas shows of all time, Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer is a stop-motion holiday delight, one that has earned its spot as the longest-running holiday special in U.S. TV history.\n\nThe hour-long show follows Rudolph, the misfit elf Hermey, and the prospector Yukon Cornelius as they embark on a trip to the island of misfit toys, first saving the reindeer's friend Clarice from the Abominable Snowman, and then ultimately Christmas with his nose that shines so bright. The stop-motion animation can be choppy at times but is all the more adorable with its iconic characters, like Sam the Snowman (voiced by Burl Ives), and beautiful color schemes that transport us into this world. Rudolph is a mainstay of American holiday culture, a treasured classic, and a rightful memory of Rankin/Bass.\n\nWhere to buy Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer: Amazon Prime Video\n\n02 of 12\n\nThe Hobbit (1977)\n\nLong before Peter Jackson's Hobbit trilogy starring Martin Freeman, Rankin/Bass produced this original TV movie that was made when the work of J.R.R. Tolkien was in the public domain in 1977. Animated by Topcraft, a defunct Japanese animation company whose workers rebranded into the famous Studio Ghibli, The Hobbit is a family-aimed adventure with unique animation and great voiceover work.\n\nWhile some Tolkien scholars and fans lamented the infantilization of the source material and some creative changes, the animated special remains a fun take on the tale and an early foray into adapting Tolkien's work to the screen. Even though later efforts have eclipsed the classic work, Rankin/Bass' animated tale is still an exciting adventure and a treat to view.\n\nWhere to watch The Hobbit: Max\n\n03 of 12\n\nFrosty the Snowman (1969)\n\nOne of the most treasured family holiday specials that builds upon the classic song is Frosty the Snowman. In this special, a group of schoolchildren build Frosty and place a magician's hat on his head, bringing him to life. Happy birthday! But, when he realizes it's too hot, he travels to the North Pole with a bunny named Hocus Pocus and a girl named Karen to escape the heat.\n\nRankin/Bass wanted the distinct look of a Christmas card for the film, which the animators nailed with the crisp colors and holiday imagery seeping out of every corner. The studio also got Jimmy Durante, one of the original recorders of the song, to serve as narrator in his final film role before his death in 1980. Rankin/Bass, along with their frequent writing collaborator Romeo Muller — who is famous for his adaptations of numerous Christmas classics — crafted another well-remembered special that still delights audiences today.\n\nWhere to buy Frosty the Snowman: Amazon Prime Video\n\n04 of 12\n\nThe Last Unicorn (1982)\n\nThis oft-overlooked fantasy adventure from Rankin and Bass is a cult classic. With the same animation team behind The Hobbit and other Rankin/Bass productions, The Last Unicorn features a unique script and an impressive voice cast, including Mia Farrow, Alan Arkin, Jeff Bridges, Angela Lansbury, and Christopher Lee.\n\nWhile the animation has left some viewers and critics with much to be desired, the unusual characters and story make for an intriguing film that deserves its place in the animated classic films of the 20th century.\n\nWhere to watch The Last Unicorn: Hulu\n\n05 of 12\n\nThe Year Without a Santa Claus (1974)\n\nWhen Santa gets a cold and decides to take a holiday instead of delivering gifts, he inadvertently sets off events that have turned into this beloved Christmas classic.\n\nFeaturing memorable holiday characters, like the elves Jingle and Jangle and the warring brothers Heat Miser and Snow Miser, The Year Without a Santa Claus is a well-earned holiday classic with the distinct animation style from Rankin/Bass and original songs that spread the Christmas cheer. The special spawned a live-action retelling with John Goodman as Santa Claus and even a sequel more than 30 years later about the Miser Brothers that kept the charm and style of the original.\n\nWhere to rent The Year Without a Santa Claus: Amazon Prime Video\n\n06 of 12\n\nThunderCats (1985–1989)\n\nWhile their holiday films and specials are more often remembered, the TV series work from Rankin/Bass has also left an enduring legacy. Based on the characters created by Ted Wolf, ThunderCats follows the adventures of catlike humanoid aliens from the planet Thundera.\n\nRankin/Bass started with the production until merging with Lorimar Productions on this series, which has a huge cult following and continues to be viewed and remade to this day.\n\nWhere to watch ThunderCats: Hulu\n\n07 of 12\n\nSanta Claus Is Comin' to Town (1970)\n\nBased on the classic Christmas tune, Santa Claus Is Comin' to Town follows in the stop-motion footsteps of Rudolph with a yearly tradition of holiday joy. Fred Astaire and Mickey Rooney lend their vocal talents to this wholesome romp about the history of Christmas traditions.\n\nThe stop-motion animation is charming and it has rightly kept its place as part of annual Christmas TV viewing rituals with fun music and even spin-offs including a Nintendo game.\n\nWhere to watch Santa Claus Is Comin' to Town: Peacock\n\n08 of 12\n\nThe Return of the King (1980)\n\nFollowing the success of The Hobbit, production began on this film, an adaptation of the third and final book of J.R.R. Tolkien's The Lord of the Rings trilogy. This particular iteration is often confused as the sequel to 1978's The Lord of the Rings, the animated movie by director Ralph Bakshi, because Warner Bros. marketed the films together after acquiring the rights.\n\nStill, Rankin/Bass' animated follow-up to The Hobbit is thematically ambitious, albeit often lacking the lyricism of Tolkien's original work — though it may not be fair to compare it to director Peter Jackson's Best Picture-winning masterpiece. Even Rankin didn't believe audiences would have the patience for the entire trilogy.\n\nThe Return of the King is not available to watch or rent\n\n09 of 12\n\nThe Stingiest Man in Town (1978)\n\nOne of the most musical films of the Christmas catalog of Rankin/Bass, The Stingiest Man in Town is a delightful animated production centered on Ebenezer Scrooge.\n\nIt is actually a remake of a live-action episode featured on the '50s anthology series The Alcoa Hour and was lost until it was found in the home of an Alcoa executive and restored in 2011. Now, audiences can enjoy the original, delightful animated special that features a well-acted voice cast and smart script that would make Charles Dickens proud.\n\nThe Stingiest Man in Town is not available to watch or rent\n\n10 of 12\n\nHere Comes Peter Cottontail (1971)\n\nMost of the beloved specials from Rankin/Bass bring the Christmas cheer but even this Easter classic kept a little yuletide spirit as Peter Cottontail goes to all the other holidays to win an egg contest in order to become the Chief Easter Bunny.\n\nWith their famous stop-motion, gorgeous music, and a great voice cast that features Vincent Price, Casey Kasem, and a final role from White Christmas' Danny Kaye, Rankin and Bass made a non-Christmas holiday special that is ideal for Easter season.\n\nWhere to watch Here Comes Peter Cottontail: Tubi\n\n11 of 12\n\nThe Mouse on the Mayflower (1968)\n\nThanksgiving traditions aren't held in as high esteem as Christmas ones, but classrooms across the country have shown elementary students this charming Thanksgiving film for years. Is it historically accurate? No. But as Rankin and Bass have shown with their Christmas specials over their career, the charm of their films is in capturing the joy and spirit of holidays.\n\nFollowing Willum, a church mouse discovered on the Mayflower on the Atlantic, The Mouse on the Mayflower details the pilgrims' first Thanksgiving feast. As with all the Rankin/Bass specials, the animation here is fascinating, and features uncredited work from legendary director Hayao Miyazaki.\n\nThe Mouse on the Mayflower is not available to watch or rent\n\n12 of 12\n\nThe Little Drummer Boy (1968)\n\nAaron is a little Jewish boy who lives with his parents on a farm. He enjoys his animals, Samson the Donkey, Baba the Lamb, and Joshua the Camel. But his life takes a sour turn after bandits ruin his quiet existence, setting Aaron off on a journey of self-discovery and hope.\n\nBased on the song of the same name, The Little Drummer Boy is full of darker material compared to other Christmas specials from Rankin/Bass, but the film contains enough powerful moments to wow audiences. The studio made a sequel in 1976 with Aaron and his animal companions, so audiences have two films to enjoy and listen to Aaron play his little drum. Pa rum pum pum pum.\n\nWhere to rent The Little Drummer Boy: Amazon Prime Video"
