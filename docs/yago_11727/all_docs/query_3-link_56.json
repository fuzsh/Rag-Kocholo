        "text": "The Cultural Gutter is a website dedicated to thoughtful writing about disreputable art. The site is updated every Thursday afternoon. Carol Borden, Angela Englert, Sachin Hingoo, Alex MacFadyen, and Beth Watkins probe science fiction, draw out the best in comics, stare deeply into the screen, sink their fangs into horror, dally with romance, speedrun their brains on videogames and explore so much more. Our Guest Stars shine here. Thanks to Gutter aesthetic director Brian Kirby for all his swank art. Thanks to EJ Lee for providing the fantastic art we used in the Cultural Gutter book. The Cultural Gutter's signature nail polishes, \"Disreputable,\" and, \"Disreputable 2: Hellcat,\" were created by Andrea Evans of MPZ Cosmetics. MPZ Cosmetics also teamed up with Dill McKinley to recreate the classic fragrance, Cornichon by Dill McKinley for Gutterthon 2021. We've migrated to a new server. We're adding in lost pictures and reformatting as fast as we can. Thanks for your patience with older posts! We do not accept unsolicited pitches.
