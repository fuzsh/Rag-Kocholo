With Jules Bass, produced and directed 'The Hobbit (1977)(TV)' and 'The Return of the King (1980)(TV)', both of which were later remade as live-action films by Peter Jackson. Both films also feature some casting similarities. Rankin and Bass hired Orson Bean to be the voice of Bilbo, and later Frodo as well. The older Bilbo in Jackson's film is played by Ian Holm, largely on account of his having played Frodo in the BBC Radio version. The three trolls in Der Hobbit: Eine unerwartete Reise (2012) are all voiced by actors who also play one of the dwarves. Rankin and Bass's version did the same, although the actors do not play the same dwarves in both versions.
