Dan knows firsthand what it feels like to be on the outs. When his mom signs him up for a school trip to Europe with the same kids who made middle school miserable, Dan can’t believe his bad luck. Full of heart, laughter, and extremely embarrassing moments, this true tale isn’t one to miss.\n\nTeenDan SantatJimgraphic-novel staff-shelf teen\n\nWolf by Wolf\n\nThe page-turning action and overall themes of identity that define this alternate WWII make it a knockout of a story, with characters and scenes that I still can vividly recall.\n\nTeenRyan GraudinHanafiction staff-shelf teen\n\nWildoak\n\nA misunderstood girl and a neglected snow leopard cub find solace and strength in one another’s caring.\n\nKidC.C.

The Lost Islands\n\nLOVE the diverse stories and this entire concept of different interpretations of a subject becomes so interesting with all the different art styles and directions it end up in. The editor, and the author of a couple short stories within the series, is also the author of the Amulet series that was one of my favorites for so long. This one is by far my favorite out of the three collections.\n\nTeenKazu KibuishiBibigraphic-novel staff-shelf teen\n\nBreathless\n\nTeenJennifer NivenBibifiction staff-shelf teen\n\nThe Start of Me and You\n\nTeenEmery LordBibifiction kid staff-shelf\n\nThis Adventure Ends\n\nTeenEmma MillsBibifiction staff-shelf teen\n\nIn Real Life\n\nGraphic novels were my FAVORITE for so long, and this one has such pretty art and an intriguing story.\n\nTeenCory DoctorowBibigraphic-novel staff-shelf teen\n\nAmulet.

I’ve reread it at least 5 times now and it just gets better every time, the movie just overshadows so much of the characters development.\n\nTeenErnest ClineBibifiction staff-shelf teen\n\nThe Perks of Being a Wallflower\n\nI loved the format of written letters, and it works so well for Charlie and how he thinks.\n\nTeenStephen ChboskyBibifiction staff-shelf teen\n\nLooking for Alaska\n\nTeenJohn GreenBibifiction staff-shelf teen\n\nPaper Towns\n\nTeenJohn GreenBibifiction staff-shelf teen\n\nThe Sky Is Everywhere\n\nTeenJandy NelsonBibifiction staff-shelf teen\n\nFangirl\n\nMy favorite book for a solid year in early middle school, it’s honestly so cheesy but in the best way possible. Finding out the connection between this and “Carry On” also by Rowell was so fun.\n\nTeenRainbow RowellBibifiction staff-shelf teen\n\nFirestarter\n\nTeenStephen KingBibifiction staff-shelf teen\n\nIn a Perfect World\n\nTeenTrish DollerBibifiction staff-shelf teen\n\nEvery Day\n\nWeird concept, but I liked it.

The entire book is so vividly written that it plays out as smooth as a movie and I just love the way the author talks about each character. For something that’s considered a kid’s series, there are some really creepy aspects that stick with you throughout the entirety of the series.\n\nTeenRansom RiggsBibifiction staff-shelf teen\n\nThe Night Country\n\nTeenMelissa AlbertBibifiction staff-shelf teen\n\nThe Hazel Wood\n\nThis was super weird when I first read it but really good and was kind of an introduction to other fantasy novels.\n\nTeenMelissa AlbertBibifiction staff-shelf teen\n\nHolding Up the Universe\n\nTeenJennifer NivenBibifiction staff-shelf teen\n\nFriends With Boys\n\nA fun graphic novel where a girl gets followed around by cute ghosts in high school, more of a casual read because its not crazy lot of action\n\nTeenFaith Erin HicksBibigraphic-novel staff-shelf teen\n\nSpeak of Me as I Am\n\nTeenSonia BelascoBibifiction staff-shelf teen\n\nA Very Large Expanse of Sea\n\nTeenTahereh MafiBibifiction staff-shelf teen\n\nWildwood\n\nKidColin MeloyBibifiction kid staff-shelf\n\nI’ll Give You the Sun\n\nCombining the back-and-forth perspectives between the twins with a view into the past creates a wonderful tension between the siblings and their struggles, while still showing the connection that they have throughout the years. An extra twist of romance on both sides of the story, and a bit of forbidden love, makes this one of my most memorable reads.\n\nTeenJandy NelsonBibifiction staff-shelf teen\n\nThe Miseducation of Cameron Post\n\nThis book was one of the most memorable books I read in middle school, and a really good combination of heartbreaking and hopeful.\n\nTeenEmily DanforthBibifiction staff-shelf teen\n\nA Little Dose of Nature\n\nThis book features outdoor science activities you can try at home!\n\nKidAlison Greenwood; Anneli BrayJimkid nonfiction staff-shelf\n\nSaving Sunshine\n\nWhen two siblings who are always at odds find a sick turtle, they must overcome their differences if they want any change at saving their new friend.\n\nKidSaadia Faruqi; Shazleen KhanJimgraphic-novel kid staff-shelf\n\nThe Big Book of Mysteries\n\nUFOs, Sasquatch, and Ghosts – oh my! Fact or Fiction?

What’s not to love? This YA novel from Marie Lu is fast-paced and fun.\n\nTeenMarie LuJimfiction staff-shelf teen\n\nMiss Quinces\n\nWhen Sue’s mom surprises her with a quinceañera, Sue just about loses it. Dresses? Speeches? The dreaded color pink? How could this be happening? Sue isn’t quite so sure that she’s going to let it happen. I love this book because it balances the need to be an individual while simultaneously living with and loving an imperfect family.\n\nKidKat FajardoJimgraphic-novel kid staff-shelf\n\nAlex Wise Vs. the End of the World\n\nThis book is action-packed, fun, and real. If you enjoyed series like Percy Jackson and Harry Potter, it’s time to meet Alex Wise.\n\nKidTerry J. Benton-WalkerJimfiction kid staff-shelf\n\nAllergic\n\nJust when it seems Maggie is about to bring home her forever friend she discovers something terrible. She’s allergic to just about every pet you’d ever want!\n\nKidMichelle Mee Nutter; Megan Wagner LloydJimgraphic-novel kid staff-shelf\n\nClick\n\nThe only thing Olive wants is to find where she fits in. But in 5th grade when she realizes cliques are forming all around her, she doesn’t feel quite at home in any of them.\n\nKidKayla MillerJimgraphic-novel kid staff-shelf\n\nPathfinder\n\nFans of Ender’s Game will love Pathfinder!\n\nTeenOrson Scott CardJimfiction staff-shelf teen\n\nThe Young Elites\n\nAt what point does someone become irredeemable? Can one bad decision define who we are and how we see ourselves?\n\nTeenMarie LuJimfiction staff-shelf teen\n\nThe Calvin and Hobbes Tenth Anniversary Book\n\nI could read Calvin and Hobbes all day. It’s positively hilarious.\n\nKidBill WattersonJimgraphic-novel kid staff-shelf\n\nBeetle & the Hollowbones\n\nWonderful illustrations, fun characters, and lots of magic! It’s a perfect storm.\n\nKidAliza LayneJimgraphic-novel kid staff-shelf\n\nSquished\n\nThis family-friendly story about finding your own space will tug at your heartstrings. Especially if you have loveable boogers for siblings (I’m lucky enough to have five loveable boogers.)\n\nKidMegan Wagner Lloyd; Michelle Mee NutterJimgraphic-novel kid staff-shelf\n\nShip Breaker\n\nA gripping dystopian set in the not-so-distant future.\n\nTeenPaolo BacigalupiJimfiction staff-shelf teen\n\nThe Last Apprentice\n\nThis series is downright spooky and extremely bingeable. I first read it in middle school and instantly loved it. As the seventh son of a seventh son, Tom Ward has the opportunity to become a Spook and learn how to cast out boggarts, demons, and other evils lurking in the dark. But Spooking takes a lifetime to master and Tom’s not so sure he’ll live that long.\n\nTeenJoseph DelaneyJimfiction staff-shelf teen\n\nEverlost\n\nEerie and peculiar, Everlost scratches that itch for a story that’s riveting and simultaneously a bit unsettling. Not quite dead, but not quite alive the Everlost is a place of in-betweens.\n\nTeenNeal ShustermanJimfiction staff-shelf teen\n\nLast Star Burning\n\nThere’s something about a good dystopian novel that just hooks me. Add an outcast criminal, a forbidden relationship, and headstrong characters and it’s over – I’m reading way past my bedtime.\n\nTeenCaitlin SangsterJimfiction staff-shelf teen\n\nShade’s Children\n\nI waited until well past my 14th birthday to read Shade’s Children because my older brother used to scare me with stories from it. “It’s about evil overlords who harvest human children on their 14th birthday to build war machines!” While he wasn’t wrong about that, Shade’s Children is much more than horror. When I finally read it, I found it was packed full of complex characters who struggled to find themselves in a hostile world. It was emotional, raw, and cautiously optimistic.\n\nTeenGarth NixJimfiction staff-shelf teen\n\nHippos Remain Calm\n\nThe long-awaited counter-part of Hippos Go Berserk. Excellent opportunities to count, sing, and play.\n\nEarlySandra BoyntonJimearly picture-book staff-shelf\n\nHippos Go Berserk!\n\nCount up as the hippos gather and then down as they disperse! Highly addictive. Growing up, I made my dad read this one so many times that I can still recite most of it today. Next time you see me in the library I just might recite it for you.\n\nEarlySandra BoyntonJimearly picture-book staff-shelf\n\nThe Incredible Book Eating Boy\n\nThe Incredible Book Eating Boy simply devours books!
