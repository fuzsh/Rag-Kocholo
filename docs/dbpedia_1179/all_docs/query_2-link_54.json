        "text": "Testimonials, reviews, and news:\n\nTestimonials:\n\n“Silouan Green’s message impacted everyone in attendance and it is exactly the kind of message all our veterans need to hear, especially those who are dealing with PTSD and other types of trauma. His story relative to his personal experiences and his own personal journey are relevant across the spectrum of today’s military, the veteran community and society as a whole.” Michael A. Blum, National Executive Director, Marine Corps League\n\n“Silouan was a great partner to work with! He definitely exceeded our expectations! PTSD is a sensitive and very misunderstood subject so it was nice to be able to bring in an expert who could shine a positive light on the issue as well as motivate the audience towards engaging with those in the community who may be currently suffering. I would highly recommend Silouan Green to anyone looking for a knowledgeable and encouraging speaker!” Jenny Johnson, Northeast Indiana AHEC, Ball State University\n\n“Silouan’s training is invaluable, life changing and has far exceeded our expectations. I believe it has saved the lives of the many officers who have been in attendance.” James R.Alsup, President, Public Agency Training Council, The largest public safety training agency in the World\n\n“Silouan Green’s journey of overcoming incredible personal trauma to find passion and purpose in life is both inspirational and timely. I look forward to helping spread the word and reach those who need to hear his message.” Sheron Bellio, Producer, Bill Handel Show, Clear Channel Media + Entertainment\n\n“The future of Silouan Green’s The Ladder UPP is easy to see- it needs to be provided as part of a treatment program for any service member who is suffering from stress, anxiety, anger and/or depression due to trauma. It doesn’t have to be in a group- it can be individually, with or without a clinician, and it can even be sent as a care package to anyone willing to give it a try.” Curtis DeLoach, Maj, BSC, USAFR, Deputy Chief, Behavioral Health Operations, Office of the Command Surgeon General, USAFE\n\n“Military Care at Willow Creek Community Church asked Silouan to speak and teach his Ladder UPP class. The feedback was incredible and we actually saw lives changed. We look forward to putting on an even bigger class with a larger kick-off event later this summer and as we help spread his mission across the country.\n\nSilouan’s message is much needed in a hurting society – that regardless of how we might be broken, we can find hope and purpose in our lives.” Ali Heath, Director – Military Care at Willow Creek Community Church\n\n“Silouan Green and his Ladder UPP program are vital components to the collective healing of our veterans and country. I highly endorse him and his program.” Congressman Zach Wamp, Former Ranking Member of the Veterans Affairs Appropriations Subcommittee\n\n“Your presentation at our annual convention had the most positive response of any program that we have presented. Among the attendees, were WWII, Korean, Viet Nam, Iraq and Afghanistan war veterans. I watched them as they sat spellbound and, after the program, I spoke to some of them who refused to leave the presentation even though what they heard was hard for them to admit was a part of their lives.\n\nWith the increase of veterans returning and moving back into society, the need will most certainly increase and with programs like yours, we may be able to reduce or at least recognize the issue for them and their families. I was struck by your sincerity, conviction and dedication to the program as were both the national Commandant and Executive Director of the Marine Corps League who were in attendance. I understand they are having you speak and present at this summer’s national convention.” Don Haines, Commandant, Department of Illinois, Marine Corps League\n\n“Your ability to reach inside folks and bring out some of their darkest moments to help them and let them know they are not alone and they too can live a free and happy life is truly amazing. As the rest of the attendees in the workshop see that, everyone pulls together and opens up to help one another, again, strengthening the fact that they are not alone. It is an amazing thing to watch. During both of the talks I have attended I sat pretty much in the back of the room and I tell people this all the time – as I sat there I could actually see the healing take place and their personal demons float away.” Bill Doss – Fallen Hoosiers, Freedom PT\n\n“I had the opportunity to work with Silouan at Fort Campbell’s Warrior Transition Battalion, where he came and spoke to our wounded warriors, communicating his story and inspiring hope for those that could relate to his moving narrative. In addition to visiting with the soldiers, he also spoke to an assembly of professional social workers at a luncheon. I sat in my chair, tears streaming down my face…unashamed, and proud to have served under the same flag that he still serves. Several of my clients love his product, the Ladder UPP, and speak to the differences they see in their lives as a result of its use.\n\nThis man embodies a spirit of humble service, and a dedication to others born from his family of origin and tempered through his experiences in the military and beyond. I would welcome him back as a speaker immediately and often. He’s authentic, humble and gracious, and exceptionally good at what he does.” Kenneth S. Murray, MHA, MSW, LCSW, ACSW\n\n“I have been doing April conferences for many years now, and never have I had so much positive feedback regarding a speaker. I can say that you far exceeded any expectation I may have had.“ Jean E. Snyder\n\nDirector, Fulton County Services for Children\n\nAmazon reviews of Sycamore Hill:\n\n“Silouan touches the hearts and minds of those who have lived the horrors of man’s inhumanity to man. His clear message that we are not alone and the blessing brought to our souls by taking a chance to trust God to make something good out of the ashes of our pain resonates gently with those who have known great pain. A must read for anyone who has carried the burden of loss, violation, or who works with those who have. This book brings hope and understanding with direction toward life and that abundantly. This book needs to be read by every person who wants to know wholeness and healing and to find encouragement to go forward with life.” by Joyce I. Vaughan\n\n“This is a fantastic book. It reminds me in some ways of “The Shack” or the “Perfect Stranger” books. But this book is better. Those books introduce you to God, which is certainly a great thing. “Sycamore Hill” goes further by explaining in simple words how we can find God, how we can live each moment of every day following Him, letting Him love and care for us, letting Him heal us and take away our shame and demons, and showering His goodness on us. I strongly recommend this book to anyone who’s had even one dark night of anxiety or shame or loneliness. It will help you see you are not alone, and also see the path to take to God.” By Eric P\n\n“A clear, simple and profound message presented in a warm story. Any reader will gain from Green’s efforts to give of himself and his experience to any of us willing to go with him on this healing journey. A tough question, posed by mankind since only God knows when, and always lurking inside each of us, is treated deftly, carefully and lovingly by Green. Don’t be put off if you aren’t exactly a devoted believer in “a God”, this gentle guide towards a meaningful life with others and with ourselves is superb, touching and humble. This is for everyone. The story format makes the author’s “guiding” very accessible and though you might make it a quick read, I’ll bet you will want to go back to it down the road. I know I will.” By John D.\n\nAmazon reviews for Who Am I?:\n\n“This book has changed my life. I am not a vet but I have struggled greatly with self worth and my place in this world. I chose every wrong path towards getting through every day for about thirty years. For the past twenty years Jesus has been instrumental in turning things around but I never really put myself out there and reached out transparently to someone. Reaching out to Silouan and reading this book have brought me moments and days of freedom that I didn’t think I could experience. And it’s just begun! Having finished his book, I now read parts of it before bed every night. Every day something occurs or a Bible verse comes up that “coincidentally” meshes with what I’ve been learning from Silouan and from reading his work. Now I’m working through the Ladder UPP workbook…this has NOT been easy at times, but through reaching out to others I’m learning to live free. Highly recommend Who Am I and the Ladder UPP…along the way enjoy Silouan’s music and poetry….the man can write and make you think. Thanks Silouan!” by Stephen Thien\n\n“After I heard Silouan speak I had to get his book and learn more about him. How someone can survive what he went through and come out the other end to do what he does today is amazing to me. I’ve read it now three times and every time I do I get more inspired. Great read.” by Robert Simon\n\nAmazon reviews for The Ladder UPP:\n\n“This book has changed my life. I am not a vet but I have struggled greatly with self worth and my place in this world.
