        "text": "Machcinski, Dr. Victor A.\n\nDr. Victor A. Machinski Sr., surgeon, musician, athlete and family man, passed peacefully from this earth while in the loving arms of his family on Thursday, May 11, 2006. Known affectionately as ''Dr. Vic'' by his Hospice aides, Dr. Machcinski gracefully and courageously lived with cancer for several years until age 82. He is survived by his beloved and dedicated wife of fifty-eight years, Barbara Weeks Machcinski.\n\nDr. Machcinski was born in Brooklyn, New York on December 8, 1923, son of the late Stephen and Charlotte Machcinski. An all-around athlete, vice president of the Class of 1941 and Colgate Cup recipient for excellence in scholarship and athleticism at Poly Prep School in Brooklyn, he went on to be a Dean's List student at Yale University where he was a star pitcher of the baseball team. Dr. Machcinski pitched exhibition games for Yale against the Philadelphia Phillies, Brooklyn Dodgers and Boston Braves, played semi-pro baseball, and was scouted by major leagues. However, medicine was the stronger calling.\n\nAfter accelerating his study at Yale because of World War II, he graduated with the Yale College Class of 1945 and then from Yale Medical School in 1947. Following his internship at Grace-New Haven (Connecticut) Community Hospital and a surgical residency at New Britain (Connecticut) General Hospital, he served in Korea with the U.S. Army, Medical Corps, 32nd Infantry, attaining the rank of Captain.\n\nWhile in Korea he was awarded the Bronze Star Medal for meritorious service, Commendation Ribbon with Metal Pendant, and Combat Medical Badge. His enjoyment of every moment of life, his calmness under pressure, and his ability to handle medical traumas inspired all who knew him. He saved many lives while in Korea, working ahead of the MASH Units to stabilize patients for further treatment.\n\nDuring thirty-one years of medical practice at Danbury Hospital (Danbury, Connecticut), he earned the highest regard of his peers and love of his patients. He was a Fellow of the American College of Surgeons, and held several prominent offices and chairmanships, including Chairman of the Medical Staff at Danbury Hospital and President of the Fairfield County Medical Association. He pioneered new methods of surgical stapling and was the doctor to whom all the most difficult burn victims were sent. More than once he resuscitated someone on a tennis court or a sidewalk. He showed endless patience and compassion treating the injured and sick.\n\nHe was also a devoted and generous husband, friend and father, who was wise with his counsel, eternally optimistic and strong in spirit, with a quick wit and keen sense of humor. He was always a man you could count on, both in his professional and private life.\n\nBorn into a musical family, where his parents and brothers, Stephen and Richard, each played the piano or violin, Victor became an accomplished pianist as a teenager. He performed difficult solo pieces in concert at Poly Prep, including the Grieg Piano Concerto in A Minor, and he was known to liven up many school meetings with his brilliant playing. He might have become a concert pianist if medicine had not captured his interest. Instead, he used music as his release and inspiration. Chopin was his first love and lifetime muse, but he also loved jazz, show tunes and ragtime, as his playing days with the Dixieland ''Band Aids'' will attest. Vic could play endlessly from memory and delighted his family and friends with countless hours at the piano. No gathering was complete without his passionate and seemingly effortless playing.\n\nDr. Machcinski retired in 1985 and lived in West Chatham, Massachusetts with his wife, Barbara, for more than twenty years, most of which saw him active and engaged in local activities. He enjoyed golf and tennis, his membership in the Retired Men's Club (for which he served as pianist for many years), and his volunteer work for the Town of Chatham, including service as Town Representative to the Regional Transit Authority, and Director of the Council on Aging.\n\nHe was an avid reader who enjoyed both current events and the classics, and in recent years he became skilled with his home computer and use of the Internet. His primary joy, however, was his home and family. He regularly traveled to visit his four children and eight grandchildren, and he was tireless and selfless in his devotion to them.\n\nIn addition to his beloved wife, he is survived by his loving son, Victor A. Machcinski, Jr. and his wife Mary Ellen, of Stamford, Connecticut, and three loving daughters, Robin M. Prechter and her husband Robert, of Gainesville, Georgia, Katja Machcinski of Ashland, OR and Lauren M. Mazur and her husband Richard, of Dublin, Ohio. He has four grandsons, Elliott Prechter, Richard and Stephen Mazur, and Scott Machcinski, and four granddaughters, Dana Prechter, Meaghan and Caitlin Machcinski, and Victoria Mazur. He also has one nephew, Stephen A. Machcinski, III, and three nieces, Donna Petersen, Carol Santora, and Victoria Brenha.\n\nHe will live forever in our hearts, in the beautiful example he left us of an extraordinary life well-lived. A Mass of Christian Burial will be celebrated Tuesday, May 16, 10:00 A.M. at Holy Redeemer Church, Highland Avenue, Chatham, MA, with burial to follow at 12:45 P.M., Bourne National Cemetery, Bourne, MA. The family will receive friends at the Nickerson Funeral Home, 87 Crowell Road, Chatham on Monday, May 15, from 5-8 P.M., with a memorial tribute at 7 P.M. The family requests that in lieu of flowers, donations be made in Dr. Machcinski's name to Hospice and Palliative Care of Cape Cod, 270 Communication Way, Hyannis, Massachusetts 02601 (www.hospicecapecod.org)\n\nMackenzie, George R.\n\nFrom the Seventh Marines message board 12/27/05: \"Roger King reports that George Mackenzie suffered a massive heart attack and died instantly.\" George was an A/1/7 veteran of the Chosin Reservoir campaign. The family address is 10218 Cemetery Road, Pecatonica, IL 61063-9013.\n\nMackin, John C. Jr.\n\nJohn C. Mackin Jr., age 95, of Fairview Heights, Illinois, born on November 2, 1927, in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, died on Saturday, January 21, 2023, peacefully at home.\n\nJohn was a graduate of LaSalle High School (Class of 1945) and LaSalle College (Class of 1951) in Philadelphia with a Bachelor's Degree in Marketing. He interrupted his college education to join the Army and spent fourteen months in Alaska as part of Task Force Frigid as a Surveyor and Administrative Non-Commissioned Officer.\n\nIn 1954, he married Barbara Schwartz having met her on a blind date set up by his mother who worked with Barbara. They were married for 60 years raising four boys. After moving to the Midwest, he worked as a Chemical and Industrial Equipment Salesman with Oakite Products and Hunter Sales servicing a wide range of businesses in the southern Illinois area.

His father, Ellis Marsalis Sr., who died in 2004, owned the segregated Marsalis Hotel (whose guests included Ray Charles, Adam Clayton Powell, Jr., and Thurgood Marshall) and was active in the civil rights movement. Marsalis, an accomplished pianist who eschewed the New Orleans “traditional” style, began as a tenor saxophonist, but after switching to piano played with such modernists as the Adderley brothers, Ornette Coleman and drummer Ed Blackwell, as well as trumpeter Al Hirt. He gained a bachelor’s degree in music from Dillard University and after military service, an MA in music education from Loyola University. He later taught at Virginia Commonwealth University, and the University of New Orleans – where he spent 12 years as director of its jazz studies programme. Among his pupils were Harry Connick, Jr., Nicholas Payton and Terence Blanchard.\n\nAlthough he performed locally from the 1950s with Ed Blackwell and clarinetist Alvin Batiste, appearing weekly at Snug Harbor, one of New Orleans’s most prestigious jazz spots, Ellis ironically achieved international recognition as the founding father of a jazz dynasty with the emergence of his sons – trumpeter Wynton and tenor saxophonist Branford – later joined by trombonist Delfeayo and drummer Jason. On August 2001, to mark the occasion of Ellis’s retirement from the music faculty at the University of New Orleans, they recorded a live performance (The Marsalis Family: A Jazz Celebration, which included a sprightly bop-inflected version of The Surrey With The Fringe On Top, by the celebrant. In 1979, Ellis had appeared at Carnegie Tavern in New York, and critic John S. Wilson observed: “Unlike the widely accepted image of jazz musicians from New Orleans, Mr. Marsalis is not a traditionalist” but was rather “an eclectic performer with a light and graceful touch [and] an exploratory turn of mind”. His well-received latter-day albums include Father And Sons (with Wynton and Branford (1982), Duke In Blue (1998), Ruminations In New York (2005), An Open Letter To Thelonious (2008) and a solo album, On The First Occasion (2014).\n\nDuring his lifetime Ellis’s musician sons paid fulsome tributes to their father. In 2004 Wynton remembered ”My father never put pressure on me. He’s too cool for that kind of stuff”. On his talents as a teacher, Branford observed that “Learning has always been more important to my dad than the sense of established order. His quest with students was all about taking them to a better place intellectually, not teaching them to know their place”. And their father returned the compliments: “I do have a lot of pride in my sons. They were able to make music work as a profession by playing what they chose to play”. Immediately after his father’s death, Branford quoted from a text he’d received from David Wilkins, a Harvard Law professor: “We can all marvel at the sheer audacity of a man who believed he could teach his black boys to be excellent in a world that denied that very possibility, and then watch them go on to redefine what excellence means for all time”.\n\nFittingly, the Mayor of New Orleans, LaToya Cantrell, issued this statement: “Ellis Marsalis was a legend. He was the prototype of what we mean when we talk about New Orleans jazz. He was a teacher, a father, and an icon – and words aren’t sufficient to describe the art, the joy and the wonder he showed the world”.\n\nIn addition to his jazz playing sons, Ellis is survived by two non-musician sons, Mboya and Ellis III, a sister, Yvette, and 13 grandchildren. His wife of 58 years, Dolores Marsalis, died in 2017.\n\nMartel, Norma M. Fascendini\n\nA one-of-a-kind, courageous, independent and beautiful soul has been called home. Norma M.

Determined to become a nurse, Norma joined the Hospital Corps and served from 1952 – 1956 during the Korean War. While stationed at US Naval Hospital Portsmouth, VA she met the love of her life, Anthony N. Damian, Jr. Together they had two children before his untimely death. She later married Paul A. Martel, eventually moving to Plainville to raise the family. Norma is survived by her children: Tony Damian, Mary (Damian) Reynolds, Joseph, David, Richard, Carol Martel Hall, James and their families; brother in-law Moe; sisters-in-law Simone, Dallas, Juanita, Jackie, and Charlene along with many cherished nieces, nephews, and adopted members to the Martel clan.

He loved fishing, woodworking, hunting, and his grandchildren.\n\nMeising, Joseph John \"Jim\"\n\nJoseph John \"Jim\" Meising, age 91, passed away peacefully on Tuesday, January 17, 2023, surrounded by family in the home that he had built in 1958 in Plum Borough, Pennsylvania, where he lived with his wife Mary Margaret (Rogel) Meising for 63 years. It was the homestead where he raised his two children, John (Amanda) Meising of Wasilla, Alaska and Karen (Alan) Toth of Plum Borough, and the home where he hosted family Christmases and celebrated his wife's and mothers-in-law birthdays. Having a Christmas Eve birthday, Mary said her first birthday cake was one that Jim had gotten her when they were dating.\n\nHe was an exceptional provider as a builder and as a masterful gardener. He took pride in his work and what he could grow. A child of the Depression, he was a collector of many things and spent a lot of Sundays at the flea market.\n\nIn his long life he had to let go of many treasured family members. He was preceded in death by his twin brother, Edward Meising of Penn Hills; his sister, Ruthann Fornof of Northridge, California; and brothers-in-law, Daniel O'Brien, James Grossi, Robert Rogel and Lloyd Amy; and his sisters-in-law, Lillian O'Brien, Frances \"Bibe\" Grossi and Louise Meising. Awaiting him in heaven are many friends that made his life memorable: Joe and Mary Kulick, Melvin and Virginia Miller, Bill and Elma McKee, Rita and Jack Lauric, Jack Werder and Bill Werder.\n\nBorn in Penn Hills to the late John and Stella (Pajeck) Meising, Jim graduated from Penn Hills High School in 1951 and was soon drafted into the Korean War. He served for two years as an Army medic stationed in Japan. He was stationed at Camp Haugen from 1951 to 1953. His daughter recalls him telling her that the town had burned to the ground and many Army guys pitched in to fight the fires. He also was impressed with the local area’s farming.\n\nAfter leaving the service he started a building company that built homes in Penn Hills, Churchill, Wilkinsburg and Plum Borough. He was forced into retirement at age 63 with a detached retina and failing eyesight, yet he could spot bald tires from his porch chair. With his wife as his 'eyes' and his driver and his right hand, they continued to manage their residential rental properties. Until he was 90, he cut the large yard on a riding lawn tractor as if from memory. His will to work never left him, and as he sat in his rocking chair these last months waiting for his daily phone calls from his brother-in-law, Richard \"Dic\" Fornorf and dear friend Marlene Scherer, he would restlessly think about what project he should take on.\n\nEver the tough negotiator, he had a business deal with someone one-third his age in his last month of life. The younger negotiator considered Jim to be sharp, aware, and difficult. She knew him well for only meeting him in December.\n\nIn his final days he required much care and he was forever grateful for having loving family around to attend to him. His son-in-law Alan Toth and his grandson Nathan Toth made his last days at home possible. Vitas hospice's nurses Miranda, Kelly and Erica all assisted in his care as well, and his family is eternally grateful to them. He was blessed with loving grandchildren: Christian Toth, Nathan Toth, Julia Toth ,and Charlotte Meising. His many treasured nieces and nephews that visited, sent cards and who spoke to him often on the phone made his days more colorful with their conversations. May he be welcomed by our heavenly family, as he will be missed by his earthly one.\n\nMass of Christian Burial was celebrated on Tuesday at St. John the Baptist R. C. Church of Holy Family Parish. Interment followed in Plum Creek Cemetery.\n\nPittsburgh Post-Gazette\n\nPublished on January 21, 2023\n\nMeister, Paul P.\n\nPaul P. Meister passed away July 25, 2023, at the age of 90 in Nashville, Tennessee. He was born an only child in Belleville, Illinois to the late Clem and Pauline (Whittauer) Meister. He is preceded in death by his adored wife of 61 years, Shirley Vogler Meister who passed away in January 2020. Paul was a devoted husband, loving father, grandfather, friend to many, lover of music, published and award-winning photographer, train engineer and just all-around nice guy.\n\nIn his early years, Paul attended Cathedral Grade School and Cathedral High School in Belleville. He went on to attend Belleville Junior College studying mechanical and sales engineering. He met Shirley while working as a photographer for the Belleville Daily Advocate and she worked as a proofreader. Their first date was attending a stock car race where Paul was the assigned photographer for the newspaper. Unaware of the evening plans, when picked up, Shirley donned her best attire wearing a lovely dress and high heels. To her surprise, she ended up covered in dust and dirt throughout the evening. He often joked it was a miracle she ever went out with him again.\n\nDrafted into the Army during the Korean War, Paul was trained in field wire and radio maintenance repair. While stationed at Ft. Hood, Texas he kept in close contact with Shirley, regularly writing her sweet love letters. He and Shirley married in 1958, moved to Chicago for a brief time, and eventually settled in the Broad Ripple neighborhood of Indianapolis, Indiana in 1959. They joined Christ the King Church and community and raised three girls through primary, secondary school and college.\n\nPassion for trains began as a young boy for Paul when he often rode in the engine with his grandfather (Bombo), a train engineer, on routes to and from Belleville/St. Louis, Missouri. He acquired a substantial Lionel O Gauge train collection, built a platform and transformer capable of running it along with all its accessories. He also spent years volunteering at the Indiana Transportation Museum in Noblesville, Indiana where he worked on train engines, became a certified train engineer running locomotives during the Indiana State Fair, and served as a member of its Board.\n\nPaul's love of music compelled him to join The Indianapolis Maennerchor, once the oldest continuously existing male choir in the United States, where he sang for 50 years until the group's last performance in 2018. He was also an active member of Christ the King Church choir and acted as a cantor for many years. He continued his appreciation for music by singing along at music performances as late as a week before his passing.\n\nPhotography was a hobby, passion, and profession for Paul. He loved taking pictures. His desire was not to take good pictures; he strove to take outstanding pictures; and they were. Most all family gatherings eventually turned to a directive to retire to the front porch for the compulsory family picture; only to find him fiddling with the flash or tripod; something to ensure the picture would be flawless. Paul won many awards for his photography and often freelanced, taking photographs for family reunions, first communions and weddings.\n\nBeing a proud Veteran, Paul could usually be seen wearing his Korean War ball cap and was tickled to tell the story of strangers \"thanking him for his service\" or picking up his lunch tab. He enjoyed long-time membership in the Service Club of Indianapolis, attending weekly meetings at the Knights of Columbus. Thrilled to attend the Honor Flight for Korean Veterans to Washington, DC at the age of 83, it was no surprise Paul carried along his heavy camera gear for the 18-hour day trip to memorialize the experience.\n\nProfessionally Paul's career focused on sales engineering, primarily the sale of large heating and air conditioning units. He worked hard and provided well for his family. No matter how he felt, he got up, got dressed and went on with his day. You could count on him. He was well-read, a brilliant man and seemed to know something about everything. He could build or fix almost anything and taught his girls his handiness. A steadfast, faithful, loyal, and good man he selflessly and compassionately cared for Shirley throughout her time with Alzheimer's. He never complained and always kept a cheerful outlook, even during the most challenging times. He is missed terribly and will always be remembered for his witty quips and gems of wisdom, particularly in his final months and days.\n\nPaul is survived by his daughters Donna (Robert) Simons, Cleveland, Ohio, Diane Meister (Al Houin), Plymouth, Indiana, Lisa Meister, Nashville, Tennessee; grandsons David (Chelsey) Meister, San Diego, California and Samuel Simons, Tel Aviv, Israel; sister-in-law Beverley (John) Thurman, Belleville, Illinois, brother-in-law Michael (Betty) Vogler, Huntley, Illinois along with multiple nieces and nephews.\n\nA Mass of Christian burial will be at Christ the King Church, 5884 Crittenden Ave., Indianapolis, Indiana at 12:00 PM on October 13, 2023. A celebration of life will follow in the St. Joseph's Room at Christ the King School.

Melby, 90, of O'Fallon, Illinois, passed away on Sunday, May 30, 2021 at Memorial Hospital in Belleville, Illinois. Robert was born March 3, 1931 in Chicago, Illinois. After high school, Robert joined the Air Force and spent many years serving as an aviation mechanic before retiring as Chief Master Sergeant.

He was the devoted and cherished husband for 56 years of the late Barbara L. (Greco) Menna. Born in Providence, he was the son of the late Agnello and Antonetta (Verdecchia) Menna.\n\nAngelo was Owner and President of Quonset Cities Service, Inc., an automotive repair facility in North Kingstown for 40 years before his retirement in 1997.\n\nHe was a veteran of the United States Air Force, serving from March 1951 to October 1953. On October 23, 2004, Angelo was awarded The Distinguished Flying Cross medal by Senator Jack Reed in recognition of his heroic efforts as a B-29 Central Fire Control Gunner in the 93rd Bomb Squadron. While en route to North Korea, during an aerial mission on November 26, 1952, his aircraft experienced a major and near-catastrophic malfunction of the autopilot gyro causing the aircraft to suddenly dive. The resulting instant weightlessness caused the equipment and crew to be thrown about the aircraft. All of the bombs, with the exception of four, had broken loose from the racks and had fallen through the bomb bay doors. One 500-pound bomb and three other armed, photoflash bombs loosened but were hanging from the forward bomb rack. Angelo, without regard for his own safety and without a parachute, managed to release the four bombs and pushed them out of the bomb bay doors into the sea. Because of his extraordinary courage and exceptional skill, Airman Menna ultimately saved the lives of the eleven-member crew.\n\nHis selflessness and devotion to duty and responsibility were his guiding principles in his later roles as an extraordinary, husband, father, and grandfather.\n\nAngelo is survived by his adoring daughters, Karen L. Menna with whom he lived, and Jamie G. DiMaio and her husband Leo of Cranston. He was the proud and cherished grandfather of Stephanie Grace, Angelica Marie, and Leo Angelo DiMaio. He was the brother of the late Katherine Oliver, Emma D'Ambra, Gaetano Menna, John Menna and Elaine DeMatteis. He is also survived by many nieces and nephews.\n\nMerna, Richard G.\n\nPosted by the Merna Family:\n\n\"Our wonderful Brother Richard left us today [July 04, 2006], at 1:55 p.m. He was 71.

He loved to share the joy of this family holiday tradition at any hour of the day or night!\n\nOut of all of his accomplishments and activities, what he cherished most in his life, was the importance of “The Family”.
