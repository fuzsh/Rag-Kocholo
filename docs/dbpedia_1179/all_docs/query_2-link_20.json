        "text": "The primary project of Warexperience.org and Omni Media Services is the video acquisition of interviews with war veterans and civilians whose lives have been impacted by war. Since 2001, over 180 veterans have been interviewed, including decorated heroes and combat veterans, stories of the home front and those who trained men for action. Their stories detail the brutality of the war experience, as well as the camaraderie and even humor that accompanied their service. It is the history not covered in the textbooks. In many cases, these veterans have not spoken publicly about their experiences until these sessions. Full interviews are archived at the Broomfield Veterans Memorial Museum and at the Regis University Center For The Study Of War Experience.\n\nOnline Video Archive - Individual interview excerpts\n\nWorld War II Europe\n\nPhil Antonelli\n\nDewey Augenstein\n\nBob Ball\n\nVern Bingham\n\nPhil Bissell\n\nJesse Black\n\nJoe Clarke\n\nWayne Coleman\n\nHenry Dahlberg\n\nJoe DeLio\n\nLoy Dickinson\n\nRobert Egnew\n\nRon Fenolia\n\nWarren Foote\n\nEd Gitlin\n\nCarlton Goodwin\n\nLouis Goos\n\nUwe Grapengeter\n\nLee Guenther\n\nTom Gunning\n\nVinton Guy\n\nBill Hessin\n\nOrville Horn\n\nRuth Jones\n\nBill Kenyon\n\nGil Maestas\n\nLucky McGinty\n\nLeonard McKinney\n\nGeorge Meshko\n\nBen Miller\n\nMitch Mischler\n\nBill Moore\n\nWright Morgan\n\nNewt Moy\n\nDon Nate\n\nAl Nelson\n\nBarney Nolan\n\nWendy Oakes\n\nGrant Oasheim\n\nHubert Peters\n\nPete Peterson\n\nDaniel Pettee\n\nGuy Purdy\n\nMike Quering\n\nEd Reilly\n\nRigney Sackley\n\nJoe Sakato\n\nTom Sander\n\nMartin Small\n\nFelix Sparks\n\nRay Spiro\n\nVivien Spitz\n\nDuane Thayer\n\nBilly Thornton\n\nJim Tracy\n\nClark Valles\n\nLeonard Wallden\n\nHal Weekley\n\nKen Wilson\n\nWorld War II Pacific\n\nJohn Atkinson\n\nHoward Beasley\n\nGlen Berry\n\nJohn Brown\n\nYvonne Charles\n\nClay Decker\n\nDoolittle Raiders - Dick Cole & Bill Bower\n\nJohn Doolittle & Jonna Doolittle Hoppes\n\nLou Eckland\n\nJohn Greaves\n\nBill Greenewald\n\nBen Hartman\n\nJulius Jordahl\n\nStan Kerkhoff\n\nStanley Knoop\n\nHal Leith\n\nJoe Lemmo\n\nPaul McDowell\n\nStan Miller\n\nPaul Murphy\n\nDick Newell\n\nSaul Nova\n\nWaverly Person\n\nBill Reynolds\n\nTony Romeo\n\nPenny Schumann\n\nBob Seeber\n\nJack Tanner\n\nJack Thurman\n\nJim Van Buskirk\n\nWilliam Vickers\n\nDon Whipple\n\nJim Withers\n\nWorld War II\n\nHome Front\n\nRomana Antonelli\n\nPeg Ball\n\nSophie Bellino\n\nJim Bennett\n\nMurray Brown\n\nFrank Busnardo\n\nLaura Busnardo\n\nClarence Edmonds\n\nPauline Edmonds\n\nRobert Goldie\n\nSally Guy\n\nBryan Jaggers\n\nEd Kirsch\n\nBernie Langfield\n\nRio Lucas\n\nLouise Lyon\n\nJim Madrid\n\nDaniel Oredson\n\nArt Peterson\n\nRuth Prudhomme\n\nJosMarie Vanderspek\n\nRuss Warmack\n\nDaryl Wilson\n\nKorean War/\n\nCold War\n\nLou Barrientos\n\nArthur Bjorhus\n\nRobert Blum\n\nRobert Fleming\n\nTom Foley\n\nChic Fries\n\nKen Harris\n\nCarl Hardesty\n\nAl Jeffries\n\nDon Johnson\n\nJoe Lutz\n\nBob Murphy\n\nBill Roberts\n\nBen Smith\n\nJoe Weibel\n\nThe Vietnam War\n\nTom Campbell\n\nMichael Carmichael\n\nTom Courant\n\nTom MacKenzie\n\nDon Maison\n\nLew Moir\n\nMark Nichols\n\nVance Rasmussen\n\nTom Ryan\n\nDon Schaffer\n\nPete Snyder\n\nReed Sundine\n\nBob Wardlaw\n\nThe Gulf War, Afghanistan & Iraq\n\nChris Edgerton\n\nPat Hanlon\n\nJ.P. Malbeouf\n\nMel Plett\n\nDavid Wilder\n\nWorld War II Europe\n\nSoon after his POW camp was liberated by the Russians, Ed Gitlin embarked on a journey through Russian occupied Poland and Germany motivated by a desire to witness the history unfolding around him.\n\nGerman native Uwe Grapengeter served as an interpreter for the U.S. Army's military government in postwar Germany which helped him locate and assist his own relatives impacted by the devastation of war.\n\nBen Miller's ability as a combat medic saved the lives of soldiers in the field, but he was frustrated by the lack on information field soldiers received about their friends once they left the front lines. Stepping on a German land mine in Eastern France was the start of Daniel Pettee's lengthy journey of recuperation from serious injuries. After escorting a crippled plane to safety in Russian occupied Poland, P-47 pilot Pete Peterson was stranded with other American fliers and found the Russians less than willing to help fix their planes and get them back to their units in Western Europe. That led to a dramatic escape in a hastily repaired B-17.\n\nLee Guenther was stationed at General Eisenhower's Supreme Allied Headquarters during the preparations for D-Day, overseeing women who were sending and receiving coded messages to the invasion units. Soon after the landings, she and and other women from headquarters spent time on the beach in Normandy until communications could be firmly established.\n\nAs a combat infantry scout, Wright Morgan would observe German movements and direct fire on potential targets. One day, observing from a captured German pillbox, he witnessed a medical convoy that he suspected wasn't all that it seemed. Foward artillery observer Ron Fenolia could come within yards of the Germans while on scouting and observation missions. He tells how his observer teams operated, where they looked to observe the enemy and what they did when a target was spotted.\n\nHubert Peters was in one of the worst places to be when the opening artillery barrage at the Battle Of The Bulge began...by himself in an open field. Hear him tell how he managed to get back to his unit just in time to evacuate.\n\nGerman fighter pilots proved to be a tough enemy for American bomber crews, and didn't just pose a threat over enemy-held territory. Grant Oasheim says the bombers were vulnerable even on approach to their English bases.\n\nIn World War II, letters provided the only communication with home for soldiers deployed overseas. Phil Bissell describes how letters kept him in touch with his wife and informed him of the birth of his first child.\n\nCommunications specialist Louis Goos found himself isolated from his unit during the invasion of Italy in 1943. He and his crew were left behind during a German counterattack and had to fend for themselves until the Allies could regroup and retake the area. Axis naval forces were active in the Caribbean before and after the Pearl Harbor attack. Newell Moy flew anti-submarine patrols in antiquated B-18 bombers, and recalls how brazen the Germans were and where they could go for help in the area.\n\nWayne Coleman flew two of America's best fighter planes during World War II, The P-47 and the P-51. He says that the P-51 gets more attention these days, but he actually preferred flying the Thunderbolt.\n\nAs a dietician at an Army hospital behind the lines in France, Ruth Jones didn't expect to come under air attack by the Germans, but on Christmas Eve 1944, the soldiers a her hospital found that attending a party may have saved their lives. Joe DeLio had a bad feeling before the mission where he was shot down over Germany. The extra precautions he took that day saved his life when he was literally blown out of his exploding bomber by anti-aircraft fire.\n\nOne of the foremost challenges of invading across the English Channel was supplying the troops that landed in Normandy for the breakout into France. Ed Reilly served in the Navy and tells of how engineers built and repaired port facilities to keep the invasion going,\n\nStationed at a hospital in Europe receiving casualties from the front lines, Vinton Guy couldn't help but feel for the soldiers he saw recuperating from permanently disabling wounds, often just weeks into their service.\n\nBefore travelling over the English Channel to bomb the Third Reich, heavy bombers would form up over England in an intricate process. Lennart Wallden details how pilots would get in the proper formation with hundreds of planes from multiple squadrons in the air all at once.\n\nLate in the war American bomber crews faced a nearly invincible challenge from German jet fighters. Don Nate describes how the ME-262s would attack bomber formations, and about their one of their few vulnerabilities.\n\nThe view from the ball turret provided Robert Egnew a wide field of view for all the things that could happen during a B-17 bombing mission. Most aircraft mechanics stayed on the ground, but Leonard McKinney was fortunate enough to find a pilot who would let him join the crew and fly on the planes that he prepared and repaired. When a bomber took off for a mission to Germany, the crews that prepared the plane were often left in the dark for hours waiting for their return, and dealing with the possibilty that the fliers they worked with on a daily basis might not come back as Guy Purdy describes.\n\nOn The B-17, perhaps no crewman was more isolated than the ball turret gunner who flew on the bottom of the plane in cramped conditions. Billy Thornton describes what it took to fly in the ball.\n\nRigney Sackley was part of a special unit that addressed technical problems experienced by Eighth Air Force fliers on mssions from England to the Continent. Here, he describes one particular issue that victimized a number of heavy bomber crews.\n\nThe P-47 Thunderbolt turned out to be one of the most effective weapons against the dreaded German Tiger tank. Warren Foote describes one tactic that P-47 pilots discovered to hit the Tigers where they were most vulnerable.\n\nThe story of Martin Small's rescue from Mauthausen has a twist that he didn't discover for nearly 60 years. Watch this entire clip for one of the most amazing stories you'll ever hear from World War II. Wendy Oakes treated casualties of the Battle Of The Bulge at an evacuation hospital. Doctors and nurses there had to learn quickly how to adapt to the injuries they were facing, and were affected by the impact those injuries would have on the men who suffered them. The approach to the target was one of the most dangerous times for the men flying bombing missions. Joe Clarke describes how planes were vulnerable in the moments immediately before and after reaching the target. Upon liberation as a POW from Stalag Luft 1 in May 1945, Loy Dickinson got a taste of future Cold War rivalry when he and other American prisoners were nearly interned by the Russians, and would only be released when certain conditions were met.\n\nOne of the deadliest and least-known accidents of World War II, Operation Tiger, occurred less than a month before D-Day as Carlton Goodwin recalls. Few things went smoothly on Dewey Augenstein's English Channel crossing to Utah Beach on D-Day. His artillery crew had difficulty getting to the beach and though they didn't land under fire, he soon made a rookie mistake. Not long after arriving at the front for the first time, Al Nelson experienced the first attacks in The Battle Of The Bulge, where he feels history hasn't given enough credit to his undermanned 99th Division.

He talks about why he didn't exactly relish his new assignment. The American push into Germany was slowed by the numerous rivers that needed to be crossed. Bill Hessin tells how Army Combat Engineers constructed ponton bridges that allowed entire divisions to cross and continue the advance quickly. Few bombing missions were costlier to the Eighth Air Force than the infamous Schweinfurt raid of October, 1943. Jim Tracy was one of the fliers shot down in that raid, and he says the results weren't completely unexpected to the men who flew that day. Jim spent six months with the French Underground before escaping through Spain and returning to England. The Eighth Air Force's early raids on Germany proved so costly it necessitated a dramatic overhaul in tactics. Barney Nolan addresses how General Curtis LeMay devised new formations that protected more bombers and made the raids more effective. The most forgotten of all the service branches is the Merchant Marines. Still fighting for recognition and respect, their contributions during the war were seldom publicized, largely due to the fact that they had higher casualty rates that the other branches of service as Clark Valles explains. Events moved quickly at the end of the war in Europe for Bill Moore. The Germans managed to put up sporadic resistance almost to the very end, albeit with a ragtag collection of troops. Joe Sakato of the 442nd Regimental Combat Team was recruited into the Army from the internment camps Japanese-Americans were imprisoned in after the war started. He tells of what finally receiving the Congressional Medal Of Honor meant to him 55 years after his heroic actions in France.\n\nFelix Sparks, one of America's most decorated soldiers, commanded the first American unit to enter the Dachau Concentration Camp.

One of the most famous aviation units of World War II played a role in the rescue of Gil Maestas. He tells the aftermath of a raid to southern Germany that gave him a lifelong appreciation for the Tuskegee Airmen. Glider pilot Tom Sander thought the life of a glider pilot would be exciting and glamorous, but had a different impression after flying into Normandy on D-Day +1. German fighter pilots were particularly good a attacking American bomber formations from angles that offered the best possibility of doing damage to the bombers with minimal opportunity for response. Lucky McGinty was a gunner on B-17s and describes how the Germans preferred to attack. Though Mitch Mischler's plane made it through its missions relatively unscathed and he completed 25 missions quicker than almost anyone, others in his bomb group weren't as fortunate. He tells of the most dangerous missions his group faced, including a long-range trip to Berlin without fighter escorts. Few pilots have had the varied flying experiences of Orville Horn. An American who enlisted with the RAF before America's entry into the war, he few Hurricanes and Spitfires before transferring to the Army Air Corps, which immediately assigned him to fly B-17 bombers. Here he describes whether he'd rather fly a fighter than a bomber. In the winter of 1945, the Germans moved prisoners of war out of their camps and marched them through the German countryside in the cold and snow. Among them was Duane Thayer, who'd been shot down and captured several months before. Though in German custody on the march, he and his fellow POWs did have protection from their fellow American fliers along the route. The inevitable casualties of the air war also brought about awkward situations as replacement crews were brought in to replace the dead and missing, often within hours of their loss. George Meshko discusses how veteran fliers reacted to these new colleagues. Hal Weekley flew the B-17 during the war, and flew it while touring the country with the Aluminum Overcast into the 21st Century. During many visits, he noticed a number of spectators who always seemed to watch the plane from afar. He soon learned there was a very special reason for their interest. For all the men who flew on the heavy bombers, there were many more on the ground who did the important work of keeping the planes in the air, often salvaging equipment from damaged planes to keep others airworthy. Henry Dahlberg was a crew chief in charge of several maintenance crews, and was so valuable he was forbidden to fly on the planes he maintained. World War II Pacific Though Japan had surrendered, occupation forces expected resistance when landing on Honshu. Waverly Person worried that racial segregation would make the landing more dangerous for black troops and raised his objections.\n\nThe first wave of the invasion of Iwo Jima was the first taste of combat for Jack Thurman.

Even when islands were largely thought to be secure, the engineers still came under attack from the air.\n\nThough his ship's primary duty was to scout for submarines, Bob Seeber's Destroyer Escort's biggest threat came from Kamikaze attacks on the \"Ping Line\" between the home islands of Japan and Okinawa.\n\nIn the early days of World War II, the Marines often didn't get the best pilots for their small air wing. John Brown was a tail gunner for a particularly poor pilot who ditched his plane in the ocean five times, and was lucky to survive the experience.\n\nWhen World War Ii ended, American Naval vessels docked in Shanghai, China. Though the Japanese occupiers were gone, Shanghai was still under threat by Mao's Communist forces and Americans wouldn't be welcome there for long says Bill Greenwald.\n\nJohn Atkinson entered the service and went overseas just as World War II was winding down and feels that just by being a year or two younger than many of his high school classmates might have saved his life.\n\nEven after Japanese-held islands were taken by American forces, there were still Japanese soldiers holding out in the jungle, fending for themselves after the battles ended. Jim Van Buskirk tels of how close the holdout Japanese on Tinian would get to American bases. Marines fighting on Okinawa not only fought the enemy on the ground, but also underground, as the Japanese hid in caves and tunnels. Howard Beasley describes how difficult it was to root out an enemy that lived and fought in tunnels.\n\nHal Leith led a small team that parachuted into Japanese-occupied Manchuria right after the Emperor's announcement of the surrender. Their goal was to make contact with Allied POWs held at a camp near Mukden, but first, they had to convince the Japanese that the war was over, and Leith had to keep his own team from provoking a firefight.\n\nFlying cargo missions in the C-47 in the China-Burma-India theater often required taking off and landing from crude jungle airstrips far shorter than the planes were supposed to use. Monroe Withers tells what pilots had to do to deal with such short airfields.\n\nFlying long-range missions to China could get boring for bomber crews without listening to Tokyo Rose. Paul McDowell notes that not only was she accurate in predicting their targets but she also broke a major news story.\n\nA veteran of multiple amphibious landings as a Marine Raider, Ben Hartman found out that Japanese resistance during the invasion of Guam would prove tougher than any of his previous landings.\n\nJoining his P-38 squadron in the late stages of the Pacific War, Saul Nova had a memorable experience upon the war's end when he flew into a Japanese airfield soon after the surrender.\n\nFlying over the high mountains in the China-Burma-India Theater presented challenges for pilots. C-46 pilot Stan Miller describes how flying at high altitudes would affect the crews transporting vital cargo over some of the world's toughest terrain.

Fresh out of training with other green troops, he tells when it began to sink in that it wouldn't be like the repetitive training exercises they had become bored with.\n\nWorking in a field hospital in the South Pacific during World War II often meant making do with less than ideal facilities. Penny Schumann, a nurse in several field hospitals, recounts how the Army went about setting up operating rooms and patient wards in temporary quarters within a few miles of the front lines.\n\nInfantry observer William Vickers went ashore in the invasion of Peleiliu, one of the toughest days the Marines had before Iwo Jima. He tells about how the initial landings unfolded. Paul Murphy is one of only 317 survivors of the sinking of the USS Indianapolis at the end of World War II. Though many more men survived the initial attack by a Japanese submarine, there were more perils in the water before they could be rescued.

B-29 pilot Bill Reynolds describes the varying accounts he and his crew have come up with while discussing their war experiences at reunions decades after they happened.\n\nBefore pilots could launch missions, an accurate weather report was essential to their safety and mission success. Air Corps meteorologist Dick Newell tells how the weather affected pilots around his bases in New Guinea and Darwin, Australia. The importance of training was driven home for Julius Jordahl when the USS Tennessee was attacked at Pearl Harbor. He survived the attack, where the crew members at his station on the nearby West Virginia paid a price for a lack for preparedness.
