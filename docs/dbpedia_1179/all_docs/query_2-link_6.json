We analyze survey data collected among northern and central Vietnamese older adults in the 2018 Vietnam Health and Aging Study (N = 2,447) to examine the association between various war traumas, psychological distress, and suicidal ideation. Informed by life course and stress process perspectives, we use structural equation models with multiple mediators to analyze the relationship between mental health outcomes and five types of wartime stress exposure: loss of family and friends, witnessing death, malevolent living conditions, life threat, and moral injury. Our findings reveal enduring mental health impacts of war among survivors. Wartime stress exposure’s influence on mental health is mediated by recent comorbidities and stressful life events. Loss of family members, witnessing death, and malevolent living conditions during war are particularly salient risks for psychological distress.\n\nKeywords: late-life mental health, psychological distress, suicide ideation, Vietnam War, war stress exposure\n\nThe cohorts of men born in the early twentieth century encountered pronounced combat stressors in World Wars I and II, the Korean War, and the American War in Vietnam.1 For many, the gravity of these stressors reaches “with a long arm” into older adulthood, contributing to posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), depression, and other forms of psychological distress for decades postconflict (Elder and Clipp 1989; Lee et al. 2019). Although classic studies on war and health in the life course concentrate on American soldiers’ experiences, armed conflict’s enduring influence is global and is arguably most pronounced in developing, postconflict societies where wars of the twentieth and twenty-first centuries have been disproportionately waged (Jawad et al. 2019).\n\nMilitary veterans’ elevated risk of suicide, especially among American service members deployed to Iraq and Afghanistan, has garnered widespread scholarly and public attention (Bryan et al. 2015; Giacomo 2019). Although disturbing in magnitude and severity, this highly publicized phenomenon represents the tip of the iceberg of psychological suffering associated with waging war (Charlson et al. 2012). Research conducted among refugees of the Vietnam War and other conflicts indicates that PTSD, depression, and other mental health problems are pervasive among those fleeing war zones (Birman and Tran 2008; Momartin et al. 2004). Although this research is informative of the needs for psychiatric care in select war-affected populations in the immediate postconflict era, understanding and treating psychological scars among war survivors requires a longer term, life course perspective and population-based data on war exposures and diverse dimensions of mental health. Life course thinking acknowledges the accumulation of stressors in the lives of war survivors and the tendency, observed by Pearlin and colleagues (2005: 210) and others, for traumas in early life to “etch deeply” and to beget further secondary traumas.\n\nThis study investigates the relationship between war-related stress exposure and later life mental health among elderly residents of northern and central Vietnam. Using data from the 2018 Vietnam Health and Aging Study and informed by a life course and stress process framework, we investigate five specific components of wartime stress as they relate to general psychological distress and suicidal ideation: war-related loss of family and friends, witnessing war-related death, malevolent wartime living conditions, life threat and personal endangerment in war, and moral injury related to wartime death or injury. Our analyses also consider recent life events and physical health conditions as mediating the association between wartime stressors and late-life mental health. Consistent with public health scholars’ assessment of armed conflict’s sizable impact on the global burden of mental illness (Charlson et al. 2012), our findings indicate that wide-ranging wartime stressors, together with late-life illness and stressful life events, accumulate to exert an enduring influence on psychological distress in this postconflict population.\n\nBACKGROUND\n\nWar in the Life Course, Cumulative Stressors, and Health in Late Adulthood\n\nWe combine and adapt life course, stress process, and cumulative inequality frameworks to investigate how extensive and diverse war exposures, spanning adolescence and early adulthood, impact elderly Vietnamese war survivors’ mental health (Elder, Johnson, and Crosnoe 2003; Ferraro and Shippee 2009; Pearlin et al. 2005). This framework integrating life course and cumulative process principles situates individuals in social and historical contexts within which accrual of experiences over time informs aging and health trajectories. Drawing from the stress process model, the current study seeks to understand inequalities in older adults’ mental health as they arise from “patterned differences in social experience” and stress exposures linked to the American War (R. J. Turner and Lloyd 1999:274).\n\nLife course perspectives inform social and health outcomes among those who experienced childhood stress and disruption (Haas 2008; Hayward and Gorman 2004) and those who survived societal conflicts and crises such as World War II and the Great Depression (Elder 1985, 1994). Numerous scholars have shown that wartime and military service are critical “hidden” variables in the life course, underappreciated for their profound effects on health and aging in the lives of men (Lee et al. 2019; Settersten 2006; Spiro, Schnurr, and Aldwin 1994; Ureña, Taylor, and Kail 2018; Wilmoth and London 2016). Many of these studies reveal the long-term physical, psychological, and social damage experienced by veterans attributable to combat participation, exposure to death, or other physical and psychological harms. Even more so than in U.S. veterans, hidden variables of wartime are pertinent to health outcomes across an entire cohort of Vietnamese older adults—men and women—and those brought into proximity to war irrespective of their military participation.\n\nCumulative inequality theory and, by extension, the cumulative insult approach link sociological, psychological, and biological concepts, interpreting older adulthood health as resulting from lifelong personal trajectories of differential risk and resource accumulation (Ferraro and Shippee 2009; Haas and Rohlfsen 2010). Scholars adopting accumulation frameworks typically examine U.S. or European adult populations’ physical and mental health (e.g., suicide attempts), health behaviors (e.g., alcohol abuse), and well-being in association with early life socioeconomic or family relationship adversities (e.g., emotional abuse, parental divorce or death) as well as war and military service (Dube et al. 2001; Schafer, Ferraro, and Mustillo 2011; Surtees and Wainright 2007). Accumulation theoretical principles are apropos to diverse settings, especially those in which war has layered additional, severe adversities on broad segments of the population over their lives. Besides the life-threatening aspects of combat, populations at war often experience en masse certain hardships, such as food shortage and forced displacement, that resemble the adverse experiences faced by disadvantaged segments of general populations in peacetime.\n\nStress process theory’s emphasis on the long reach of trauma is also salient for investigating war survivors’ mental health (Pearlin et al. 2005). Armed conflict invokes trauma exposure on a vast scale, and in societies at war, those traumas are inflicted across the entire population. Following Pearlin and colleagues’ (2005:207–208) stress process conceptualization, wars generate unique levels of both “eventful” and “ambient” stressors, each of which may exact long-term damage on physical and mental health. Stress process theory also conveys that insults or traumatic exposures may build on one another, proliferating or creating “chains of risk” as adversity begets subsequent adversities (Ben-Shlomo and Kuh 2002:287). For example, a soldier who survives violent combat may experience marital conflict and/or alcohol abuse later in life that stem from combat exposure. Adverse health behaviors as well as somatization increase the likelihood of poor physical health after exposure to war, and studies have shown bidirectional relationships between physical and mental health (Ohrnberger, Fichera, and Sutton 2017).\n\nThus, the long-term mental health effects of early life stress are both direct and indirect, operating through accumulating life stressors and health comorbidities (Ohrnberger, Fichera, and Sutton 2017; H. A. Turner and Butler 2003). In another example, a veteran may experience a host of physical comorbidities tied to early life combat exposures, and the associated physical limitations and pain may underlie their current psychological distress. In postconflict settings, to understand the full, lasting toll of war on health demands comprehensive enumeration and analysis of traumatic stress exposures during war but also consideration of subsequent stressors arising in the postconflict period and in later adulthood.\n\nMental Health in the Aftermath of War: Life Threat, Malevolent Conditions, and Moral Injury\n\nWithin this study, we examine psychological distress and its association with various wartime experiences such as combat deployment, injury and displacement, witnessing death, and exposure to malevolent conditions, such as food shortage and fear of death. Research conducted primarily among American veterans demonstrates that exposure to traumatic stress can manifest in PTSD, anxiety, depression, and suicidal behaviors. Many studies find that combat exposure and life threat in combat situations heighten risk for PTSD (Kang et al. 2016; Momartin et al. 2004) and that PTSD heightens suicidality (Guerra and Calhoun 2011; Jankovic et al. 2013).\n\nAlthough malevolent environment stressors were initially conceived to understand PTSD in American veterans of the Vietnam War (D. W. King et al. 1995), they also capture persistent stressors that accompany life within a war zone among both combatants and noncombatants. To date, few studies examine linkages between displacement and subsequent psychological distress within Vietnam. However, several studies demonstrate enduring negative effects of displacement and flight on the mental health of Vietnamese refugees (Flaskerud and Anh 1988). Studies of displaced populations globally demonstrate forced migration’s ill effects on mental health. For example, higher rates of suicidal ideation have been documented among Sudanese women who have experienced displacement compared to their nondisplaced counterparts (Goldney et al. 1998).\n\nExperiencing traumatic loss and witnessing loss of human life, events that span combatants and noncombatants, are also significant contributors to mental health problems (Elder and Clipp 1989; Momartin et al. 2004). Seeing another’s traumatic death, in particular, is a risk factor for somatization and PTSD (Ursano et al. 1995). Karam and colleagues (2008) found that witnessing death or injury in the Lebanon Civil War was associated with lifetime mood disorders. In a study of U.S. veterans, Bryan and Cukrowicz (2011) found that high levels of exposure to death or injury led to increased capability for suicide. These studies suggest that exposure to loss of life has lasting mental health consequences across diverse contexts.\n\nAnother important factor for psychological distress lies in moral injury or transgression. Past research conducted among U.S. military personnel found that guilt and shame are better predictors of suicidal ideation than combat exposure or deployment (Bryan et al. 2013, 2015). Maguen and colleagues (2011:566) explain that an act that “severely and abruptly contradicts a personal or shared expectation about the rules or the code of conduct … may lead to shame, guilt, and a failure to forgive oneself,” or in other words, moral injury. Moreover, the same researchers find that morally injurious killing is associated with suicidality.\n\nThe impacts of war diverge across time, social position, and geographic location. Thus, it is important to examine the specific situational and cultural factors prevailing in Vietnam during the American War instead of analyzing the situation solely through a Western lens. Our study will thereby advance a global approach to understanding war experiences as hidden variables in the life course that shape trajectories of aging across postconflict populations. This approach also responds to calls to arrive at improved measurements of armed conflict’s enduring toll on the global burden of death and disease, including mental illness (Murray et al. 2002).\n\nVietnamese Experiences of Violence and Traumatic Exposures in the American War\n\nLike those in many other postconflict settings, Vietnamese older adults endured the travails of war for several decades over the course of childhood, adolescence, and young adulthood (Settersten 2006). War affected almost every facet of Vietnamese life and encompassed all social strata—from soldiers to militia members to civilians (Miller 2016; van Dyke 1972). It is estimated that a million Vietnamese lives were lost from 1965 to 1975 (Hirschman, Preston, and Loi 1995) and that wartime mortality rates for young northern Vietnamese men were 10 times higher than peacetime mortality rates (Merli 2000).\n\nAlthough prolonged exposure to stressful and harmful conditions was commonplace during the American War (Korinek and Teerawichitchainan 2014), divergent experiences are nevertheless evident among war survivors (Bao 1996; Miller 2016; Taylor 1999). Many segments of the population were directly engaged with or very proximate to wartime violence. Draft laws made service in the People’s Army of Vietnam nearly universal for young men from the 1960s to 1980s (Teerawichitchainan 2009). Additionally, nearly 150,000 teenagers were recruited to the Youth Shock Brigades, and approximately 1.6 million adult civilians were recruited to paramilitary defense forces (Guillemot 2009; Pike 1986). Although their primary roles were to provide logistical support such as infrastructure repair and transport, brigade and militia personnel were frequently proximate to sites of battle.\n\nMental Health in the Context of Vietnam\n\nDespite the Vietnamese people’s extensive and extended exposure to the traumas of war, research investigating mental health in Vietnam remains limited (van der Ham et al. 2011; Vuong et al. 2011), with most studies focusing on children, adolescents, and young adults (Blum, Sudhinaraset, and Emerson 2012; Tran et al. 2013). A critical knowledge gap thus remains given the many elderly Vietnamese exposed to traumatic events during the American War (Korinek et al. 2019).\n\nLimited existing research suggests that a significant minority of the Vietnamese population struggles with serious mental health problems (Richardson et al. 2010; Vuong et al. 2011). Analyzing nationally representative data from 2001, Vuong and colleagues (2011) found that 14.9% of Vietnam’s population experienced one or more of the 10 most common mental disorders: alcohol abuse, depression, and anxiety being the most prevalent. A more recent survey put the rate at 19.1% (Richardson et al. 2010). The World Bank estimates that suicide represents the thirteenth leading cause of death in Vietnam, and the overall rate has been rising over the past two decades (Macrotrends n.d.). In addition, the rate of suicide-related deaths appears relatively pronounced within the elderly population (Ritchie, Roser, and Ortiz-Ospina 2020). These risks notwithstanding, the country lags in mental health services, including suicide prevention and treatment resources (United Nations Children’s Fund 2017).\n\nIn the Vietnamese language, the term mental health triggers prejudices, social stigmas, and discrimination (Nguyen 2015). As Vuong and colleagues (2011:67) note, “Whenever people think about mental illness, they will certainly think about madness and strange behavior.” This perception can result in conceptual and measurement problems for researchers in the Vietnamese context (Do et al. 2014; Kamimura et al. 2018; Nguyen 2015). Limited knowledge of specific mental illnesses, their symptoms, and means to seek treatment, coupled with negative associations, likely contributes to underreporting in clinical and research settings (Nguyen 2015; van der Ham et al. 2011; Vuong et al. 2011).\n\nAlthough the research record is thin, a handful of studies have provided insights into the individual and contextual factors underlying depression and other forms of mental illness. For instance, Dao-Tran, Anderson, and Seib (2017) report results consistent with stress process theories. Specifically, their study among older Vietnamese women observed a significant, positive association between the experience of life stressors and depressive symptoms.\n\nOne of the few studies examining the long-term mental health effects of war in Vietnam found people exposed to adverse circumstances at a young age—especially related to war—reported substantially higher symptoms of depression (Singhal 2019). Using district-level bombing intensity, Singhal (2019) found that minor increases in bombing intensity were associated with substantial increases in the likelihood of severe mental distress in later life. Their use of district-aggregated measures of war exposure, a common tactic due to lack of individual-level exposure data, assumes that residents of a given district experienced the same adverse war events. The present study addresses this issue by using self-reported individual exposure to adverse war events as well as regional proxies for aggregate exposure. Singhal (2019:5) noted that early life conflict exposure also affects late-life physical health, such that the mental health findings “could both be a manifestation of poor health status or help explain these related health effects.” The present study clarifies these interrelated processes by explicitly examining physical health and life event stressors in older adulthood as mediating pathways between war-related stress exposures and mental health.\n\nHYPOTHESES\n\nGiven the intense, long-enduring, and often violent experiences of the American War among older adults currently residing in northern and central Vietnam and informed by tenets of life course, stress process, and cumulative inequality perspectives, we hypothesize (Hypothesis 1) that greater levels of psychological distress and greater odds of suicidal thoughts will characterize older adults whose experiences of the following exposures were relatively numerous or severe: (a) war-related losses of family and friends, (b) firsthand witness to war-related deaths (either military or civilian victims), (c) malevolent wartime living conditions, (d) life threat or personal endangerment, and (e) moral injury linked to causing death to noncombatants or failing to prevent the death of a comrade.\n\nSecond, informed by the concept of stress proliferation and the role of stress exposure in the etiology of chronic illness, we hypothesize (Hypothesis 2) that the association between wartime stress exposures and late-life psychological distress will be mediated by recent life event stressors and comorbidities in the lives of war survivors.\n\nDATA AND METHODS\n\nData and Sample\n\nWe analyzed older adults who were participants in the 2018 Vietnam Health and Aging Study (VHAS). The VHAS included an omnibus in-person interview with detailed questions about military service and war experiences; physical, mental, and functional health; socioeconomic conditions; stressful life events; and social engagement and support. VHAS respondents (N = 2,447), roughly ages 60 and older in 2018, were community-dwelling older adults who were young adults at the time of the American War (1965–1975) and were heavily mobilized for participation in armed conflict. Of the respondents, 51.2% were female, and their mean age was 70.3 (SD = 8.46; range = 59–105). Due to missing data on variables pertinent to our analysis, the analytical sample in the present study was 2,307.\n\nVHAS participants resided in one of four districts in Vietnam’s Red River Delta and North Central regions, purposively selected to capture a range of war exposure based on bombing intensity during the American War (Korinek et al. 2019; Miguel and Roland 2011). Stratified, random sampling techniques were used to select communes or wards in each district. Individuals listed in commune/ward-level household registration systems were then randomly selected within four subdomains of interest: male–military, male–nonmilitary, female–military, and female–nonmilitary. Sampling rates varied across subdomains according to the relative size of the eligible population. Of those contacted, 84.7% agreed to participate. In cases where a person declined to participate or was otherwise unavailable, a replacement participant matching the nonresponder’s gender, veteran’s status, and commune of residence was randomly chosen from the sampling frame. The application of sampling weights made the VHAS data representative of the older adults currently residing in the 12 communes/wards from which the sample was drawn. The sample was selective to the extent that it includes only those who survived the war, remained in Vietnam, and were alive in 2018.\n\nMeasures\n\nDependent variables.\n\nWe analyzed two dependent variables to investigate the relationship between war-related stress exposure and later life mental health. Psychological distress is defined by Mirowsky and Ross (2003:8) as “unpleasant subjective states of depression and anxiety, which have both emotional and physiological manifestations.” We measured general psychological distress experienced in the past month using an index adapted from the Self-Reporting Questionnaire (SRQ; Beusenberg, Orley, and World Health Organization 1994; Chipimo and Fylkesnes 2010). The SRQ has been culturally adapted and validated for use with Vietnamese populations (Giang et al. 2006; Richardson et al. 2010). The SRQ modified for the VHAS included nine items indicating whether the respondent experienced particular emotional (e.g., the urge to cry more than usual, sensing daily life as suffering) or physical (e.g., insomnia, indigestion) expressions of distress in the past month (for the complete set of questions and response categories, see Appendix A in the online version of the article). Following previous studies (Chipimo and Fylkesnes 2010), we weighted these items according to their severity and then created a summative index. The VHAS SRQ had a Cronbach’s alpha of .73. We analyzed the sum of the weighted items as a continuous variable. Second, we examined suicidal ideation, assessed through the following question within the SRQ, “Has the thought of ending your life been on your mind?” Using a single indicator of suicide ideation is not uncommon (Ishida et al. 2010; Ullman and Najdowski 2009), and prior researchers have used the SRQ question to assess suicide ideation (Giang et al. 2006; Ishida et al. 2010).\n\nIndependent variables.\n\nOur key independent variables captured distinct forms of wartime stress exposure. In particular, we included sets of variables that indicate individual-level experiences with the following stressors: (a) war-related loss of family/friends, (b) witnessing death during the war, (c) wartime malevolent living conditions, (d) life threat or personal endangerment in war, and (e) morally injurious wartime experience. The questions used to derive these measures were adapted from the National Vietnam Veterans Readjustment Study, the Combat Exposure Scale, and the Deployment Risk and Resilience Inventory, all of which have been used extensively to assess combat conditions among American veterans of the Vietnam War (Keane et al. 1989; L. A. King et al. 2006; Kulka et al. 1988; for the complete set of questions and response categories, see Appendix B in the online version of the article).\n\nMediators.\n\nTo address our second hypothesis, we included covariates for life event perceived stress and experience of chronic disease comorbidities. We counted and weighted (from 0 to 3 for no, low, moderate, or severe distress, respectively), according to the respondent’s assessment of associated distress, the following life events experienced within the past 2 to 3 years: an accident, marital disruption (divorce or widowhood), major residential move, death of a child, spouse’s severe illness, and significant financial difficulty. Comorbidities were measured with a summative index of nine self-reported chronic conditions: hypertension, diabetes, heart disease, lung disease/COPD, cancer, liver disease, stroke, arthritis, and asthma.\n\nControl variables.\n\nWe incorporated model covariates controlling for a range of respondent characteristics associated with mental health, including respondents’ sex, age, place of residence, main lifetime occupation, household assets, emotional support, marital status, and lifetime military service. The specific categorization for these variables is elaborated in our descriptive statistics.\n\nAnalytical Approach\n\nOur analyses began with descriptive statistics for our analytical sample, followed by a series of bivariate associations between our explanatory variables and dependent variables. We then estimated two sets of multivariate models. In the first set, we employed survey-weighted ordinary least squares (OLS) regression analysis to evaluate the relationship between wartime trauma exposure and general psychological distress. We generated two versions of these models for comparison: one without mediators and one with multiple mediators—recent life stressors and comorbidities. In the second set of multivariate models, we employed survey-weighted logistic regression to investigate the relationship between wartime trauma exposure and suicidal ideation. We again treated life stressors and comorbidities as potential mediators. Finally, to formally test for multiple mediators, we used structural equation models of the mediated relationships (Iacobucci, Saldanha, and Deng 2007), followed by mediation analysis with Monte Carlo replication and bootstrapping to test and quantify the direct and indirect effects of wartime trauma exposure via comorbidity and stressful life events (Jose 2013; Preacher and Hayes 2008). We estimated all statistical models using Stata 16.1.\n\nRESULTS\n\nDescriptive Statistics\n\nThe analytical sample for this study included 1,132 men and 1,175 women; 66.7% participated in some form of military activities. Of those who reported some military participation, 61% were members of formal military organizations, and 39% participated in informal military activities such as the Youth Shock Brigades or other militia organizations.\n\nThe average SRQ-10 score in our sample was 5.3 (range = 0–20). This corresponds to respondents experiencing, on average, approximately two of the enumerated symptoms in the past month. Greater numbers of respondents reported experiencing physical ailments such as feeling tired (68.2%) and having digestive problems (38.8%), whereas suicide ideation was the least prevalent symptom among respondents (9.5%).\n\nWartime stress exposure is pervasive in the VHAS sample. Concerning war-related stressors, 30% of VHAS respondents lost an immediate family member during the war. Respondents were also direct witnesses to death and war dead, with 51.3% and 24.9% having seen dead or mortally injured civilians or American soldiers, respectively. In addition, 58.3% experienced at least one type of malevolent living condition during the war. Specifically, 29.4% were forced to move due to wartime bombing, 25.9% experienced severe wartime food shortage, and 35.1% reported having experienced fear of being injured or killed in wartime. Among respondents who had served in either formal or informal military service, 48.1% engaged in combat or other dangerous duties, and 29.3% experienced at least one “close call” of being shot or hit in battle. Among former military respondents (formal and informal), 34.7% reported being involved in actions that potentially resulted in moral injury. Although few participants self-reported engagements that accidentally led to the death of civilians, 34.0% had a friend killed near them in battle.\n\nIn addition to these war-related stressors, recent comorbidities and life event stressors, which we investigate as mediators between war stressors and late-life psychological distress, are also relatively common in the VHAS sample. On average, VHAS respondents report currently suffering from two (from a list of nine) chronic conditions. Although 47.6% of respondents reported having experienced no stressful life events in the past 2 to 3 years and the mean number of events reported was only .8, a majority of the sample experienced at least one. Among those who experienced recent life stress, most respondents indicated having one (29.1%) or two (18.3%) recent stressful life events; experiencing severe financial hardship and a spouse’s illness were the most commonly mentioned stressors.\n\nBivariate Analyses\n\nTo test for bivariate associations between wartime stress exposures and mental health, we conducted a pairwise comparison of means and chi-square tests of significance by gender for each of our wartime stressor items in association with SRQ—psychological distress and suicide ideation ( ). Bivariate results reveal that men and women diverge on certain stressor items and that women experience higher SRQ scores and are more likely to express suicide ideation; however, for both men and women, mean SRQ scores are significantly higher for those who experienced wartime stress exposures. Comparing levels of suicide ideation across those differently impacted by wartime stressors, the bivariate results indicate significant associations with death or injury of a personal contact and witnessing dead civilians among women. However, the share of men reporting suicide ideation does not differ significantly across wartime stressor experiences. Notably, for both men and women, levels of psychological distress and suicide ideation diverge considerably according to counts of comorbidities and stressful life events. Those facing more numerous hardships in these areas indicate greater degrees of recent psychological distress and suicide ideation.\n\nTable 2.\n\nSRQ Psychological DistressSuicide Ideation (%) N MenWomenMenWomenMeanMean Difference SignificanceMeanMean Difference Significance%χ2\n\nSignificance%χ2\n\nSignificanceWar-related stress exposures Zero immediate family members died through military service/war-related causes4.335.716.111.9n.s.1,610 1+ immediate family members died through military service/war-related causes5.14 ** 6.65 ** 7n.s.14.9697 R does not know persons dead/seriously injured due to war4.145.485.911 *** 1,430 R knows 1+ persons dead/seriously injured due to war4.94 ** 7.46 ** 6.6n.s.18.1877 R did not see dead/injured civilians during war3.875.35510.8 * 1,120 R saw 1+ dead/injured civilians during war5.01 *** 6.92 *** 7.2n.s.15.21,187 R did not see dead/injured American soldiers during war4.295.9612.4n.s.1,733 R saw 1+ dead/injured American soldiers during war4.98 * 7 * 6.9n.s.25.3574 R did not experience forced migration due to wartime bombing4.45.815.812.4n.s.1,630 R experienced 1+ forced migration(s) due to wartime bombing4.96n.s.6.52 * 7.8n.s.13.9677 R did not experience illness/weakness due to wartime food shortage4.285.675.612n.s.1,709 R experienced illness/weakness due to wartime food shortage5.3 *** 7.08 *** 8.3t15.4598 R did not experience wartime fear of being injured or killed4.175.085.7n.s.101,497 R experienced wartime fear of being injured or killed5.55 *** 7.44 *** 8.117.2 *** 810 R did not perform combat patrols or dangerous duties4.125.936.112.7n.s.1,568 R performed combat patrols or dangerous duties4.88 ** 6.62n.s.6.4n.s.13.9739 R did not experience “close call” of being shot/hit4.235.89612.6n.s.1,856 R experienced “close call” of being shot/hit5.19 ** 7.45 ** 6.8n.s.15.5451 R does not self-report accidentally causing death of noncombatants4.51——6.2——2,282 R self-reports accidentally causing death of noncombatants5.73n.s.——9.1n.s——25 R did not have a comrade shot near them in battle4.15.945.512.71,784 R had a comrade shot near them in battle5.18 *** 7.05n.s.7.315523Recent stressful life events = 0 (reference)3.343.893.8 *** 6.5 *** 1,084Recent stressful life events = 1–25.59*** *** 7.41 *** 8.5171,094Recent stressful life events = 3+7.74*** *** 9.51 *** 12.824.4129Chronic condition comorbidities = 0–1 (reference)3.434.534.2 *** 7.4 *** 1,005Chronic condition comorbidities = 2–34.75*** *** 6.75 *** 6.315.2974Chronic condition comorbidities = 4+6.83*** *** 8.83 *** 11.625328No military service (reference)3.825.9814.1n.s.Service in formal military4.61n.s.4.92 * 6.5Service in informal military (militia, Youth Shock Brigades)4.95* * 6.25n.s.12.4\n\nMultivariate Analyses\n\nThe results of survey-adjusted OLS and logistic regression models estimating psychological distress and suicide ideation are shown in and . Coefficients for key predictors are reported in the figures (for full results with all covariates, Appendix C in the online version of the article). Each figure includes two models—one estimated with the full analytical sample (N = 2,306) and one estimated for a subset of VHAS respondents who served in military roles (n = 1,526). We include the latter models because questions about life threat and moral injury were only posed among VHAS respondents who engaged in the formal military or militia organizations. In models using the full analytical sample, individuals who did not serve in the military are coded as zero on variables measuring life threat and moral injury, based on the assumption that they did not encounter these wartime stressors.\n\nResults for both psychological distress and suicide ideation are largely consistent with our hypotheses and generally indicate an association between multiple domains of wartime stressors and psychological distress. With respect to our first outcome variable, psychological distress, and our first set of hypotheses concerning wartime stress exposures, we observe statistically significant, positive associations with war-related loss of family or friends, witnessing of death during the war, and wartime malevolent living conditions. These significant associations characterize the full sample and military service subsample. Notably, levels of psychological distress are significantly higher among respondents who observed dead or injured civilians but not for those who observed dead or injured American soldiers. Among the malevolent conditions included in our models, severe food shortage and fear of being injured or killed demonstrate statistically significant associations with late-life psychological distress; migration due to bombings does not emerge as statistically significant.\n\nSuicide ideation exhibits similar but distinctive patterns of association with wartime stress exposures. Personal family loss, exposure to death, and malevolent living conditions demonstrate significant associations. Specifically, those VHAS respondents who lost family members due to war, saw dead or seriously injured civilians in wartime, moved due to wartime bombing, and/or experienced significant wartime food shortage are significantly more likely to report suicide ideation, or thoughts of ending their life, in the past month.\n\nConcerning our hypothesis that experiences connoting moral injury will result in late-life psychological distress, our models provide modest partial support. Recalling that self-reports of actions that resulted in the death of noncombatants were very rare in the VHAS data, we do not observe an association between such actions and either psychological distress or suicide ideation. However, for older adults in the military subsample who experienced having a friend shot near them in battle, SRQ psychological distress scores are significantly higher (coefficient = 1.659, p ≤ .05) compared to those who had no such experience in wartime. Results for morally injurious experiences and suicide ideation do not reach statistical significance.\n\nTo evaluate our hypotheses regarding recent stressful life events and chronic illness comorbidities as mediators between wartime stress and late-life mental health, we conduct mediation analyses with post hoc tests of indirect effects. Overall, we observe highly significant positive associations between three wartime stress exposures and both psychological distress and suicide ideation. Experiencing the war-related death of family members, wartime food shortages, and a fear of being injured or killed all exhibit some degree of mediation, whether complementary, competitive, or only indirect (see and for a summary of indirect and direct effects). Collectively, these supplemental analyses (see Appendices D–G in the online version of the article) confirm that wartime stress exposure’s effects on psychological distress are both direct and indirect via life event stressors and comorbidities experienced in late adulthood.\n\nTable 3.\n\nIndirect through Life Stress (% TE)aIndirect through Comorbidity (% TE)Direct EffectIndirect through Life Stress (% TE)Indirect through Comorbidity (% TE)Direct EffectWar-related loss of family/friends Number of family members died.055* (13.4%).122*** (29.0%).231*.085** (16.5%).135*** (26.2%).295* R knows persons dead/seriously injured−.080.078.647**−.052.046.317Witnessing death during war R saw dead/injured civilians.091+.085+.480*.103+.043.322 R saw dead/injured foreign soldiers−.086−.047−.180−.095−.032−.095Wartime malevolent living conditions R moved due to bombing during war−.103−.040.159−.073−.039.343 R experienced wartime food shortage.114* (17.0%).101* (15.0%).457*.019.094.484+ R experienced fear of being injured or killed.250*** (22.3%).140** (12.5%).733***.192*** (100.0%).048.411+Life threat, personal endangerment in war R performed combat patrols or dangerous duties.064.069−.080.069.061−.029 R experienced “close call” of being shot/hit.081.089.166.075.110+.223Wartime death/injury and moral injury R accidentally caused death of noncombatants−.172−.209.68−.175−.217.616 R had friend shot near them in battle.071.109.154.084.112+.310\n\nTable 4.\n\nIndirect through Life Stress(% TE)aIndirect through Comorbidity(% TE)Direct EffectbIndirect through Life Stress(% TE)Indirect through Comorbidity(% TE)Direct EffectbWar-related loss of family/friends Number of family members died.015+.039* (17.6%).182**.025+.039* (14.2%).236* R knows persons dead/seriously injured−.022.025.240−.015.013.047Witnessing death during war R saw dead/injured civilians.024.027.335+.030.012.285 R saw dead/injured foreign soldiers−.023−.015−.133−.028−.009−.064Wartime malevolent living conditions R moved due to bombing during war−.028−.013.482*−.021−.011.533* R experienced wartime food shortage.031* (49.2%).032* (50.8%).178.005.027.224 R experienced fear of being injured or killed.067** (59.8%).045* (40.2%).078.560* (100.0%).014−.142Life threat, personal endangerment in war R performed combat patrols or dangerous duties.017.022−.147.020.018−.165 R experienced “close call” of being shot/hit.022.029−.099.022.032−.096Wartime death/injury and moral injury R accidentally caused death of noncombatants−.046−.067.016−.051−.063.003 R had friend shot near them in battle.019.035+.099.024.033.139\n\nDISCUSSION\n\nOnce conceived as a “hidden variable” in the life course (Spiro et al. 1994:17), an empirically rich scholarship has since emerged that reveals the consequences of military service along multiple dimensions, including PTSD and other psychological health outcomes, chronic illness, social functioning, and life satisfaction. The present study, informed by life course scholarship on the dramatic, enduring impacts of war and military service and adapting the life course and cumulative inequality theoretical paradigms to the critical postconflict setting of northern and central Vietnam, has sought to reveal the toll of widespread war stress exposures on late-life mental health.\n\nThe findings from our study align with previous research on exposure to war-related stress and later life mental health. Consistent with life course and stress process perspectives, we found mixed support for our first set of hypotheses concerning diverse domains of war stress exposure and psychological distress in late adulthood. In our sample, the loss of family and/or friends during wartime continues to heighten psychological distress in general and suicide ideation in particular. Although bereavement research suggests that the effects of loss tend to subside with time, we reason that the effects of wartime losses may endure longer due perhaps to their violent nature, the relative youthfulness of the deceased, and other reasons (Kaltman and Bonanno 2003).\n\nThe individual predictors for our hypotheses around witnessing death yielded mixed results. Although seeing dead or injured civilians was significantly associated with psychological distress (for both the full and military samples) and suicide ideation (for the full sample), seeing dead or severely injured American soldiers was not. This finding may reflect aspects of Vietnam’s communal culture. Tétreault (1996) notes that the military routinely sent soldiers and cadres to their home villages to support family and friends, increasing both village social cohesion and the national sense of community (Anderson 1983; Durkheim [1897] 1951). Moreover, wartime propaganda on both sides of the conflict likely helped to assuage the moral injury otherwise associated with killing or witnessing death as long as the victim was perceived as an enemy combatant and, therefore, a legitimate target of wartime violence in a protracted fight for national independence.\n\nOur results also demonstrate mixed support for the hypothesis concerning malevolent living conditions during wartime. Experiencing shortages of food and the fear of being injured or killed were associated with higher levels of psychological distress but not with suicide ideation. In contrast, being forced to move during the war due to bombing was associated with a higher likelihood of suicide ideation but not general psychological distress. These mixed results are somewhat puzzling. The latter finding parallels extant research on forced migration and mental health (Gong et al. 2011), whereas the former may indicate that food shortages and generalized fear were chronic, persistent stressors exerting small but salient effects across a host of mental health outcomes and that forced migration is a short-term acute stressor tied to a single, drastic mental health outcome. Additionally, conditions of persistent fear and food shortage may be indicative of other unobserved aspects of wartime living environments encountered by soldiers and civilians.\n\nSurprisingly, our hypothesis concerning life threat and personal endangerment, as indicated by combat patrols and “close calls” in battle, was not supported. Notably, the items comprising this group of predictors were only asked of veterans or militia members. Their military training may have prepared them to handle such events, yielding resilience to aid in adapting and overcoming traumatic exposures (Ardelt, Landes, and Vaillant 2010; Elder and Clipp 1989). Alternatively, repeated exposures may have desensitized them to recurring dangerous circumstances.\n\nOur hypothesis around moral injury received weak support in the analysis. Respondents in the military subsample who had friends shot near them in battle indicated higher psychological distress scores, but this experience was unrelated to suicide ideation. Causing the death of noncombatants, which has the strongest theoretical tie to moral injury, was not significantly associated with either outcome. However, this may be an artifact of the limited variation in responses in VHAS. Ninety-eight percent of respondents reported that this had never happened to them. Due to the sensitive nature of this question, we suspect that our variable underestimates the incidence among this population.\n\nWe find strong support for our second hypothesis, which posits that the association between wartime stress exposures and late-life psychological distress is mediated by recent life event and health-related stressors in the lives of war survivors. Current comorbidities and stressful life events are each strongly linked with psychological distress, and both are also associated with early life wartime stressors. This pattern of results supports the stress proliferation and cumulative insults approaches to late-life health disparities (Haas 2008; Pearlin et al. 2005). Such results suggest that measures to improve psychological distress among war survivors could target their experiences with the stressors common to older adulthood in developing countries and implement preventive measures against the onset of chronic conditions.\n\nWe are attentive to several limitations that may influence our conclusions. First, the cumulative inequality perspective sensitizes us to the importance of premature mortality and selection processes as they influence analyses of health outcomes in late life (Ferraro and Shippee 2009). Selective mortality within this war era cohort may dampen the associations between war stress exposures and late-life health because those most heavily exposed to the violence and trauma of war are especially likely to have died prior to data collection, such as in battle or in midlife. Second, the VHAS relies heavily on self-reports of both wartime stressors and current health conditions. This approach may contribute to biased results through inaccurate recall and other mechanisms. As noted earlier, mental illness remains stigmatized in this cohort of Vietnamese, and self-reports may be biased downward accordingly. Also, our assessment of suicidality is based on only one question; questions about suicide ideation in Vietnam and elsewhere are sensitive in nature, and the phenomena tend to be underreported (Thanh et al. 2006). Future studies may wish to add multiple items that assess the gravity of suicidal thoughts. Finally, the VHAS sampled only four districts in Vietnam, so the sample is not wholly representative of the entire population. Broader geographic sampling could bolster these findings and expand our knowledge.\n\nIn conclusion, few studies have examined well-being among Vietnamese people following the American War. The results from this study show that war exposures that are common to noncombatants and those active on the battlefield, such as witnessing death, loss of loved ones, and enduring malevolent living conditions, exhibit long-term associations with psychological distress. Although the war ended over 40 years ago, the “arm of war” is long and exerts a persistent, substantial burden on mental health in this population. Having identified stress exposures particularly salient to late-life mental health in this population, we propose that civil society organizations in Vietnam, such as its Veteran’s Association or Women’s Union, work with their members to identify and introduce counseling resources to community members at risk of psychological distress. In parallel to U.S. veterans’ groups, these civil society organizations may mobilize groups of army veterans or brigade volunteers to provide support and informal group therapy in a manner that does not invoke judgment or social stigma.\n\nIn a review article advocating a life approach to understanding the health effects of combat, Levy and Sidel (2009:124) comment that “important to the understanding of the long-term health consequences of war is an understanding of the indirect adverse effects of war, in both the short and the long term.” In utilizing a life course and stress process approach to analyze a diverse array of wartime stressors and their long-term consequences, our aim has been to foster such an understanding. Given the dearth of research on mental health in Vietnam, Vietnam’s extensive history of war, and the close tie between war exposure and mental health revealed in the current study and other recent investigations (i.e., Singhal 2019), additional research investigating these connections is warranted.\n\n​\n\nTable 1.\n\nMean (SD)/%a n Dependent variables SRQ Psychological Distress score (range = 0–20)5.29 (4.85)2,307 Suicide ideation: Respondent “thinks about ending life” (binary)9.5%2,291 War-related loss of family/friends Has 1+ immediate family members who died by military service/war-related causes30.2%2,307 Knows persons killed/seriously injured due to war38.0%2,307 Witnessing death during war Saw dead/injured civilians during war51.5%2,307 Saw dead/injured American soldiers during war24.9%2,307 Wartime malevolent living conditions Moved due to bombing during war29.4%2,307 Experienced illness/weakness due to wartime food shortage25.9%2,307 Experienced wartime fear of being injured or killed35.1%2,307 Life threat, personal endangerment in war Performed combat patrols or dangerous duties32.0%2,307 Experienced “close call” of being shot/hit19.6%2,307 Wartime death/injury and moral injury Accidentally caused death of noncombatants1.1%2,307 Experienced friend shot near them in battle22.7%2,307Mediating variables: current stress and health conditions Recent life event perceived stress (range = 0–5).83 (.94)2,307 Comorbidity index (range = 0–9)1.95 (1.39)2,307Additional covariates Age 59–6432.68%754 Age 65–6924.53%566 Age 70–7417.04%393Age 75–7911.44%264 Age 80–847.93%183 Age 85+6.37%147 Male49.1%1,132 Female50.9%1,175 Bavi district33.9%783 Yen Khanh district33.2%765 Bo Trach district16.4%379 Dong Hoi town16.5%380 Less than secondary education81.1%1,871 Secondary education or higher18.9%436 Main lifetime occupation: agriculture66.6%1,537 Main lifetime occupation: professional, technical12.1%279 Main lifetime occupation: other nonagriculture21.3%491 Weighted index of household assets2.30 (.96)2,306 No lifetime military service33.3%769 Formal military service40.9%943 Militia/informal service25.8%595 Family relationship support index4.10 (1.78)2,307 Not currently married27.3%630 Currently married72.7%1,677\n\nSupplementary Material\n\n2\n\nClick here to view.(424K, pdf)\n\nFUNDING\n\nResearch reported in this publication was supported by the National Institute On Aging of the National Institutes of Health under Award Number R01AG052537.
