We travel across the country every year. I was a self-employed financial planner until retirement. We wander the United States and Canada and the whole world.\"\n\nJane Newhagen writes: “I want to share the news of the publication of my new historical novel, Chambered Nautilus. It is the third in the series of tales of old Key West. Wally Lamb said, ‘Lovers of the charms of modern Key West will find Jane Newhagen’s Chambered Nautilus a fascinating read. Newhagen’s carefully researched novel fuses a story about a sympathetic, humanly flawed heroine with rich period detail about the beloved island’s 19th-century past. Stories that educate as they entertain are treasures. Chambered Nautilus is one.’ Although the Middle Keys were badly damaged by Hurricane Irma, I’m happy to report that Key West suffered less damage, and we are trying to help out those who lost their homes.”\n\nFrom the November/December 2017 Issue\n\nSend your news to the BAM at alumni_magazine@brown.edu\n\nBarbara Zwick Sander writes “I had a fabulous time at the celebration of 125 Years of Women at Brown with Susan Sinykin Benjamin and Peggy Cox Moser—great keynoters and workshops. We stayed at Peggy and husband Dewey’s lovely Narragansett home. Wish more classmates had been there.”\n\nJames Sutton writes that Joshua Mandelbaum ’01 stopped by his house to ask for his vote. Josh was running for Des Moines city council in the November 7 election. Jim promised to vote for him, but chided him for going to law school.\n\nFrom the July/August 2017 Issue\n\nBill Horne’s book, The Improbable Community, was published last fall.\n\nJim Sutton (see Jim Governale ’87).\n\nAllen M. Ward writes: “At almost 75, my wife and I are building our dream house, a duplex, one side for her and one side for me, with connecting interior doors. We designed it, and I am acting as general contractor as well as doing a lot of the interior work. It’s a great way to keep active.”\n\nFrom the March/April 2017 Issue\n\nA. Thomas Levin writes: “It was a busy fall season. I was named to the New York Metro Area Superlawyers for the sixth consecutive year and also received the Leadership in Law Lifetime Achievement Award from Long Island Business News. I’ve been designated general counsel to my law firm, Meyer, Suozzi, English & Klein PC, where I continue as a shareholder and a partner. I’m also chair of our Local Government Law and Environmental Compliance Practice Group and our Professional Responsibility Group. Time flies when you’re having fun.”\n\nFrom the September/October 2016 Issue\n\nCharlotte Cook Morse writes: “Living alone in retirement was not good, so I moved to a Westminster Canterbury Retirement Community in Richmond, Virginia.

So far, so good.”\n\nFrom the July/August 2016 Issue\n\nJames Sutton’s 20th book of poetry, Daffy’s Hell, has been published by indiequill.com and is available for download.

Kupersmith writes: “After more than 28 years as a Vermont Superior Court judge, I retired from the trial bench in July. Unfortunately, there is no senior status for Vermont judges, so I have taken a part-time job as an administrative law judge in the Vermont Office of Professional Regulation (which regulates 44 professions) to keep my hand in the action. Cheryl and I have fulfilled a long-held dream and have purchased a Toyota Tacoma; a teardrop camper trailer is in the offing. Look for us to be camping in your front yard.”\n\nFrom the January/February 2016 Issue\n\nRichard Goeltz was elected an Honorary Fellow of the London School of Economics and Political Science. The LSE describes the fellowship as “the greatest honor the School can bestow.”\n\nJim Sutton published his 14th book of sonnets, Love, God, & Country, available exclusively from Amazon. Jim retired as a lobbyist for Iowa’s teachers. Paraphrasing Shelley, he writes: “Poetry is when I argue with myself; politics is when I argue with everyone else.”\n\nAllen Ward writes: “I was troubled to see no notes for the class of 1964 in the latest issue of the Brown Alumni Magazine. I trust that the reason for this is not that the rest of the class has all died, but that we are having such active lives in our golden years that no one has time to write. I decided that it was time to rectify the situation, and I hope that many of you will follow suit. Aside from welcoming a new grandson, Adam Griffin Barnes, on May 11, I have been finishing up a 10-year renovation project on my current dwelling. Having honed my construction skills, I am about to indulge my inner architect in building a duplex that I designed so that my wife and I can live side by side with our extensive libraries under one roof. As a classicist, I am still keeping my hand in professionally by organizing the spring and fall meetings of the New England Ancient History Colloquium and assuming the presidency of the Classical Association of Connecticut for 2015–16.”\n\nFrom the May/June 2015 Issue\n\nSusan Rosenfeld ’65 AM writes: “Three months after enjoying our 50th reunion, my husband, Fred Stielow, and I fulfilled a longtime dream by traveling around the world. We left Sept. 1 and visited Kenya for a safari, took a ‘maharaja’ train in India from Delhi to the Taj Mahal, and cruised the Mekong River from Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam, through Angkor Wat, Cambodia, ending in Hanoi, Vietnam. We also saw the Yangtze River in China and visited Japan, ending with two weeks in Kaua’i, Hawaii, and returned home in time for Thanksgiving.”\n\nFrom the March/April 2015 Issue\n\nOn Nov. 20, David Brodsky, Richard Fried, Philip Hahn, Jonathan Small, and Laurence Sorkin traveled to Hyde Park, N.Y., for a tour of the FDR Library. Recently renovated, the facilities include exhibits based on Franklin and Eleanor Roosevelt’s lives, old newsreels, tape recordings of fireside chats and press conferences, and drafts of speeches, letters, and memos culled from rare archival material. They also had a delicious lunch at the neighboring Culinary Institute.\n\nFrom the January/February 2015 Issue\n\nR. Lee Bennett was selected for 2015 Best Lawyers in America.

In good health and happy to visit with many of our classmates.”\n\nFrom the November/December 2014 Issue\n\nAnne Wohlers Toombs writes: “My husband of nearly 44 years, David, passed away on July 16 after a short illness. He was a retired pilot for United Airlines and an importer, distributor, and seller of Cheoy Lee sailing yachts from Hong Kong. His employment with UAL enabled us to satisfy our love of travel for many years. Fortunately, I was able to attend our 50th reunion, although he did not. Now it’s on to a new path, and where it will take me, I have no idea.”\n\nFrom the September/October 2014 Issue\n\nSteven Fried (see Michael Thompson ’07).\n\nFrom the July/August 2014 Issue\n\nAdrienne Bassick Rosenthal does interior design in Los Angeles and has three grandchildren.\n\nFrom the May/June 2014 Issue [50th]\n\nNicholas Califano writes: “After my wonderful but somewhat tumultuous years at Brown, I followed my passion in medicine and then returned to Brown to do my fellowship in gastroenterology and have remained here since. I helped start the largest GI group in the state, teaching and practicing as a clinical associate professor of medicine. I just retired from my clinical practice after 37 years but will continue teaching and volunteering. My bride of 44 years, Julia, has been the inspiration of our family: daughter Isabella with her husband, Tim, in Concord, Mass, and their sons August and Julian; son Gabriel and Sharon in Manchester, New Hampshire; and daughter Sophia and Josh now at UNC and Duke, respectively. We continue to wonder where all the years have gone. We are waiting for more grandchildren while we travel, sail, write, fly-fish, and smile. I hope to see old friends again.”\n\nFrom the March/April 2014 Issue [50th]\n\nBob Bidwell finished writing a 155-page guide to trout fishing day trips in the Washington, D.C., area for the Northern Virginia Chapter of Trout Unlimited, a coldwater conservation nonprofit.

Last spring Bob spent a week fly-fishing with Howard Johnson in the Catskills and they plan to do it again after the reunion. Bob lives in Reston, Va.\n\nLinda Mason writes: “After 47 years at CBS News, starting at the bottom as a desk assistant for CBS radio and ending as a senior vice president, I have retired. It was a wonderful career, traveling the world and working with Walter Cronkite and Dan Rather on the CBS Evening News as a field producer and then a senior producer, and with Charles Kuralt as the executive producer of Sunday Morning. I was the executive producer of CBS Reports and ran the Decision Desk on election nights. I was the first woman in many of those jobs. Pembroke was great training for that! I was honored with 13 Emmys, two DuPonts, one Peabody, and one Polk, and in November was inducted into the Deadline Club Hall of Fame with, among others, Jimmy Breslin, Graydon Carter, and Bill Moyers. I live with my husband, Cary Aminoff, in Riverdale, N.Y.”\n\nDavid K. Rumsey retired from the U.S. Marine Corps Reserves and from family law practice.

In addition, 17 grandchildren keep them busy. He lives in Upper Marlboro, Md.\n\nFrom the January/February 2014 Issue\n\nCharlotte Cook Morse writes: “I’m slowly getting used to retirement. If you are coming through, the Virginia Museum of Fine Arts is well worth a stop. The state capitol, featured in the movie Lincoln, is not far either, in downtown Richmond. Give me a call!”\n\nJudith Macintosh O’Neil and Thomas O’Neil III (see Christine O’Neil Harrison ’91).\n\nFrom the November/December 2013 Issue\n\nDonald August (see p. 53, Births & Adoptions, Kyuhey Lee August ’01).\n\nFrom the September/October 2013 Issue\n\nBrian Catto retired in 2007 from the Medical College of Georgia as a professor of medicine and infectious diseases.

It starts in the summer of 1963, when he and others were summer interns in various government agencies in Washington, D.C., and experienced late adolescents’ perceptions of the March on Washington, JFK, and U.S.-Soviet relations. Skimming along the edges of history, and after a few side-slams, the story ends 30 years later on a railroad platform by the border between Russia and Finland. Cliff writes: “If it half-works commercially, there will be at least two more. Fiction has become the bucket list. After producing a library shelf, my research and writing on higher education have probably come to an end, though I continue to sit on advisory boards for higher education reform undertakings in both the United States and Europe. I’m married to Nancy Kilpatrick ’65, with children in Maryland and Minnesota, and the Minnesota Twins for grandchildren. Hey! If you hadn’t noticed, we’re getting old, but we haven’t stopped learning—or laughing. See you for the 50th next year! 50? Oh, God!”\n\nRachael Deborah Amos ’66 MAT writes she is teaching drawing to many coworkers from The Tattered Cover Bookstore, and thus “converting” them as best she can to being visual people.

Gittleman writes: “I recently celebrated my 50th year in the investment business. During the first 25 years I became president of the Michael Investment Co. and then chairman of the board of Boston-based F.L.Putnam & Co. During the last 25 years I was fortunate enough to be a vice president with Janney Montgomery Scott LLC. We currently manage about a billion in assets. I hope to complete a book next year on an investment strategy known as ‘secured option writing.’ Ellen and I winter in Scottsdale, Arizona, but still maintain our residence in Rhode Island.”\n\nRobert C. Liotta writes: “I am still happily practicing law, married to Barbara, and living in Washington, D.C. This year I became president of the D.C. chapter of the American Academy of Matrimonial Lawyers.

He recently finished his first novel, The Russian Embassy Party, and is in the process of marketing it.\n\nDavid M. Brodsky writes: “After practicing law since 1967, I retired from active practice at the end of December 2011 and opened a one-person mediation and arbitration firm in New York: Brodsky ADR LLC. I have been retained in more than 10 active disputes by lawyers on both sides and am also doing mediation pro bono for the Appellate Division in Manhattan. I am having the time of my life, as my hours are my own, the work is intellectually challenging and fulfilling, and I am spending more time with my wife, our two daughters, and my son and his family, including three grandchildren. I face my 70th birthday with optimism and good cheer.”\n\nTom Draper writes: “I live on a farm just north of Lewes, Delaware. My four children, including my eldest, Mariah Draper Calagione ’93, have produced nine grandchildren. I still work with my two businesses here on Delmarva: WBOC-TV (CBS) and Fox21 Broadcast throughout the peninsula. The family operates a number of farms, which grow grain crops such as corn, soybeans, wheat, and barley, with a few vegetables thrown in. I spend approximately two months per year in Big Sky, Montana, one in the winter and one in the summer. My hobbies include waterfowl hunting, biking, and reading, along with some travel.”\n\nJames L. Knoll writes: “I am continuing to practice, but I am most definitely taking lots of time off. Life is good. I only need more time to bike. My wife and I enjoy good health.”\n\nPeter J. Levin writes: “Carol and I are first-time grandparents. Linus James Schaeffer was born on November 21. The proud parents are Daniel Levin and Cassandra Schaeffer.”\n\nJudith MacIntosh O’Neil writes: “Tom and I have traveled all the continents and are enjoying adventure travel.

We’re looking forward to our 50th class reunion.”\n\nThomas J. O’Neil writes: “After 45 years of teaching Latin, I am continuing to enjoy retirement.

He retired as colonel and remarried in 1994. He has eight children, including Alan Rumsey ’94, and 17 grandchildren. He writes: “My wife, Michele, and I enjoy travelling, visiting kids and grandkids, hiking, and attending baseball games across the United States. We regularly go to Orioles and Nationals games. I have been travelling to the hometowns of those killed in action from my marine company in Vietnam, visiting with surviving family members and conducting memorial services in their honor. Our visits are bittersweet but much appreciated.”\n\nRichard Tremaglio continues his architectural practice in Cambridge, Mass. He is looking forward to semi-retirement on the Maine coast, where he has been building, teaching, and consulting for several years.

Hands-on experience, initiated in his early participatory building projects, will remain central to his design philosophy. He would enjoy hearing from Brown friends.\n\nAllen M. Ward writes: “After teaching Greek history and an advanced Latin course on Lucretius last spring, I spent the summer working on the sixth edition of A History of the Roman People.

To get in the mood, Carol and I attended the Campus Dance last year and had a great time.”\n\nFrom the January/February 2013 Issue\n\nAnne Keve Lindsey writes: “We recently traversed the Panama Canal and were very interested to see the great care taken to promote and maintain Teddy Roosevelt’s dream of transcontinental ship traffic.”\n\nFrom the May/June 2012 Issue\n\nJack Gardner writes: “After nearly 45 years of law practice, I finally retired from Hogan Lovells. I have been blessed by good fortune over those years. I’ve been with two firms and I’ve been privileged to work on many wonderful corporate and public finance projects in over 35 states. I pass by some of these projects every day and I am proud to remember the efforts that brought each one to fruition. But the true reward has been the time spent working with the many professionals in the public finance industry, those who bring their knowledge and expertise to shape each project to the needs of the principals and offer security to investors. My wife, Greer, and I are both cancer survivors and are thankful for the medical professionals and facilities that brought us to good health! We’ll continue to enjoy life here in the High Country, where I did my first Colorado financing some 36 years ago.”\n\nFrom the March/April 2012 Issue\n\nCharlie Berry (see Engagements & Weddings, Katie Barry ’04).\n\nRobert J.

I have also been appointed as a mediator and arbitrator by private law firms, the New York City Bar Assoc., and federal judges in the Southern District of New York and the Southern District of Texas.

Nearly 900 persons gathered in September in Montreal for the purpose of reducing the number of animals used in research and safety testing of commercial products globally. European regulations continue to lead the world in the effort, having banned any new cosmetics if animal testing had been used to develop them. Our InVitro Int'l sales for 2011 finished at a 15-year high, and we celebrated with one glass of Champagne each.

As the remaining people sat down, we began introducing ourselves. Except for two genuine Parisians, the rest of us soon realized we were the ‘American table’ among more than thirty tables. Without any prior arrangement, it turned out that four of the nine people at the table were Brown grads, and two of us were classmates planning to return to Brown for our 40th reunion. At the table, in addition to our family and two Parisians, were Lisa and Joel Cassel ’62 and Isabel and David Brodsky. We all marveled at the remote odds of our meeting. Unspoken was the sense that a ‘higher authority’ or perhaps Josiah Carberry had orchestrated the scenario.”\n\nDavid Lovenheim writes: “Since 2002 I have served as group chief executive of WR2 Companies, based in Indianapolis and in Glasgow, Scotland.

He writes: \"Over the past twelve years, I have been assigned to civil, family, and criminal dockets in the northwestern quadrant of Vermont. The work still intrigues. Just when I think I have seen it all, a new variation appears. I must say that family court work is becoming more difficult for me, as well as for most of my colleagues, as people turn more and more to the courts to micromanage the lives they cannot control themselves. I see Dean Pineles '65, a fellow district judge, regularly and share news of Brown fortunes and/or misfortunes.

Yeo, who authored the first edition in 1962. A month earlier, while attending the annual meeting of the American Classical League in San Francisco, I met fellow Brunonian and classicist Rod Dashnaw '58, who keeps alive the spirit of Professor John Rowe Workman by teaching Latin in Phoenix. He kindly lent me Professor Robert Scholes's new and provocative book, The Rise and Fall of English, which not only sheds much light on problems in the discipline of English and what to do about them, but ought to be read by anyone interested in the perilous state of the liberal arts in education today. (See \"Does English Matter?\" in the September/October BAM.) During the next two years, I hope to help restore and renew the classical part of the liberal arts as chairman of the National Committee for Latin and Greek, whose recent efforts have helped fuel the resurgence of Latin and Greek in secondary schools.\"\n\nFrom the November / December 1998 Issue\n\nIt's that time again - time to join fellow classmates back at Brown.
