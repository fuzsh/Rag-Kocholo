As a pilot of a fighter plane, Ensign Abbott participated in thirty-five strike missions over enemy territory.\n\nAbbott, John (USN) (2nd award)\n\nThe President of the United States of America takes pleasure in presenting a Gold Star in lieu of a Second Award of the Distinguished Flying Cross to Lieutenant, Junior Grade John Abbott (NSN: 0-505134), United States Navy, for extraordinary achievement and distinguished leadership while participating in aerial flight as pilot of a fighter aircraft attached to Fighter Squadron FIFTY-THREE (VF-53), based on board the U.S.S. Essex (CV-9), during attacks against enemy forces over hostile North Korean territory on 15 January 1952. As Division Leader of a flak-suppression element escorting attack bombers on a strike mission against an important and heavily defended rail and supply center near Yangdok, North Korea, Lieutenant, Junior Grade, Abbott preceded the attack bombers into the target area and with utter disregard for his own personal safety and in the face of extremely intense and accurate anti-aircraft fire, led his team in repeated bombing and strafing attacks against these anti-aircraft gun positions which were concealed in treacherous mountain terrain. His aggressiveness, courageous leadership and outstanding airmanship enabled his division to suppress the flak so thoroughly that no damage was sustained by the attack bomber elements during their attacks. Lieutenant, Junior Grade, Abbott personally destroyed three heavy gun positions and silenced several others. His gallant and untiring devotion to duty was at all time in keeping with the highest traditions of the United States Naval Service.\n\nAbles, Robert J. (USMC)\n\nHeadquarters, Commanding General, 1st Marine Aircraft Wing\n\nGeneral Orders: Serial 17443 - 24 December 1952\n\nThe President of the United States of America takes pleasure in presenting the Distinguished Flying Cross to Captain Robert J. Ables (MCSN: 0-39391), United States Marine Corps, for extraordinary achievement while participating in aerial flight against the enemy in Korea on 15 July 1952. Captain Ables, as leader of a four-plane flight of a Marine Fighter Squadron, was assigned a deep support mission against targets in the Pyongyang industrial complex. Instrument conditions prevailed at the time of take off, while at cruise altitude the underlying clouds completely obscured the objective area. Despite the difficulties in navigation thus imposed, Captain Ables skillfully directed his flight to the target and completed his let-down through the intervening clouds in the precise position to launch his attack. He immediately pressed his attack against the target in the face of heavy anti-aircraft and intense automatic weapons fire. Direct hits from his bombs caused a large secondary explosion and the complete destruction of an important factory. Captain Ables' outstanding ability and skillful leadership insured the success of a difficult mission. His courageous devotion to duty in the face of the enemy were in keeping with the highest traditions of the United States Naval Service.\n\nAbner, Edward L. (USMC) (2nd award)\n\nCommanding General, 1st Marine Aircraft Wing\n\nGeneral Orders Serial: 10755 – 14 August 1952\n\nThe President of the United States of America takes pleasure in presenting a Gold Star in lieu of a Second Award of the Distinguished Flying Cross to Captain Edward L. Abner (MCSN: 0-25823), United States Marine Corps, for heroism while leading an aerial flight against the enemy as a member of a Marine Fighter Squadron in the vicinity of Imdang-ni, North Korea, on 30 October 1951. The close air support mission guided by Captain Abner's daring and skillful leadership accounted for the destruction of ten bunkers and one artillery piece. Despite the fact that his plane was hit by intense and accurate ground fire, he led his flight through repeated attacks on a group of bunkers on a commanding ridgeline overlooking allied ground elements. The flight neutralized the ridgeline and relieved the allied ground troops of their perilous situation. Captain Abner then led his flight through a strafing attack on a gun position behind the ridgeline and destroyed the enemy weapon with his remaining one thousand pound bomb. His actions throughout were in keeping with the highest traditions of the United States Naval Service.\n\nAbrahams, Charles W. (USMC)\n\nHeadquarters, Commanding General, 1st Marine Aircraft Wing\n\nGeneral Orders: Serial: 3709 25 April 1951\n\nThe President of the United States of America takes pleasure in presenting the Distinguished Flying Cross to First Lieutenant Charles W. Abrahams (MCSN: 0-38626), United States Marine Corps, for heroism while participating in aerial flight as a Pilot attached to a Marine Aircraft Group, from 23 September 1950 through 1 January 1951. First Lieutenant Abrahams successfully completed his first through thirty-fifth combat missions in support of our ground forces, destroying and inflicting great damage to concentrations of North Korean vehicles, material and personnel. By his airmanship and devotion to duty in the face of enemy anti-aircraft fire, he contributed materially to the success of our troops. His conduct throughout was in keeping with the highest traditions of the United States Naval Service.\n\nAckerman, Arthur H. (USMC)\n\nThe President of the United States of America takes pleasure in presenting the Distinguished Flying Cross to Captain Arthur H. Ackerman (MCSN: 0-23257), United States Marine Corps, for extraordinary achievement while participating in aerial flight in support of the First Marine Division and the First Marine Aircraft Wing on 20 May 1951. The First Marine Division was withdrawing from the enemy during their \"fifth phase\" offensive in the Korean Conflict. In providing many close support missions upon the advancing enemy, the Forward Echelons of the FIRST Marine Aircraft Wing Fighter Squadrons in the Hoengsong area developed a critical shortage of bombs, napalm, napalm tanks, and ammunition. Captain Ackerman, while serving as a pilot with the Forward Echelon of a Marine Transport Squadron, flew the vitally needed supplies into a hastily improvised dirt strip located on a river bed. The enemy had infiltrated into the area to the north of the strip. Extreme caution had to be used in approaching the field in order to avoid small arms and mortar fire. The weather was such as to require an instrument let-down on an unreliable homer in dangerous mountain terrain. Despite these hazards Captain Ackerman made this flight in a R-5D aircraft that was overloaded by more than 4,000 pounds. The aircraft was unarmed and loaded in a manner that the crew could not have abandoned it prior to off-loading the cargo. The arrival of the critically needed bombs, napalm, napalm tanks and ammunition enabled the Marine Fighter Squadrons to continue their close support missions, thereby inflicting tremendous damage upon the enemy which greatly contributed to stopping its advance. In addition to the above action, Captain Ackerman participated in more than 300 other flights in heavily loaded aircraft. Many of these flights were carried out under unusually hazardous conditions, including extremely adverse weather with heavy icing and turbulence, inadequate aids to navigation including unreliable homer facilities, hazardous mountain terrain, dangerous runways of the advanced airstrips on many occasions covered with mud or ice and snow and over guerrilla infested territory where aircraft had been fired upon and hit. Many of these flights were made into airstrips tin extreme forward areas where no aids to navigation or crash facilities existed. Captain Ackerman's alertness, efficient actions and fearless devotion to duty were in keeping with the highest traditions of the United States Naval Service.\n\nAdam, Jack H. (USMC)\n\nHeadquarters, Commanding General, 1st Marine Aircraft Wing\n\nGeneral Orders: Serial 3709 – 25 April 1951\n\nThe President of the United States of America takes pleasure in presenting the Distinguished Flying Cross to First Lieutenant Jack H. Adam (MCSN: 0-36693), United States Marine Corps, for heroism while participating in aerial flights over enemy territory from 1 October 1950 to 12 January 1951. Serving as a Pilot with the FIRST Marine Air Wing Photographic Unit, First Lieutenant Adam successfully completed flying more than one flight each day against the enemy over Korea where enemy anti-aircraft fire was either received or expected. His skilled airmanship and devotion to duty contributed materially to the success of our ground forces during this critical period. His actions throughout were in keeping with the highest traditions of the United States Naval Service.\n\nAdams, Arthur H. (USMC) (4th award)\n\nThe President of the United States of America takes pleasure in presenting a Third Gold Star in lieu of a Fourth Award of the Distinguished Flying Cross to Lieutenant Colonel Arthur H. Adams (MCSN: 0-6051), United States Marine Corps, for extraordinary achievement while participating in aerial flight against the enemy in Korea. On 22 December 1952, Lieutenant Colonel Adams led a flight of Marine jet fighter-bombers against heavily defended enemy front line forces engaged in combat with elements of the First Marine Division. As the flight approached the objective area, a low cloud formation so reduced visibility that positive target identification was extremely difficult. Because of the extreme proximity of the friendly forces and despite intense hostile automatic weapons fire, Lieutenant Colonel Adams made a low reconnaissance run beneath the overcast in order to locate the enemy trenches and mortar positions. When positive of his target, he initiated a daring assault in the face of concentrated defensive fire, scoring direct hits with all his bombs on an enemy personnel shelter and heavy mortar emplacement. His accurate marking of the obscure target enabled the remaining elements of his flight to execute a highly effective attack that completely destroyed the enemy positions. Lieutenant Colonel Adams' bombing accuracy and exemplary leadership were largely responsible for the success of a mission that substantially reduced hostile pressure on friendly troops.\n\nAdams, Arthur H. (USMC) (5th award)\n\nThe President of the United States of America takes pleasure in presenting a Fourth Gold Star in lieu of a Fifth Award of the Distinguished Flying Cross to Lieutenant Colonel Arthur H. Adams (MCSN: 0-6051), United States Marine Corps, for extraordinary achievement while participating in aerial flight against the enemy in Korea from 10 January 1953 to 13 January 1953, during a series of massed aerial assaults on a heavily defended bridge complex in the vicinity of Sinanju. Confronted by intense defensive fire and under constant threat of attack by superior jet interceptors, Lieutenant Colonel Adams led his squadron in three separate aerial assaults on the target area. In the face of concentrated enemy fire, he initiated a dive bombing attack on a series of enemy gun emplacements, personally scoring direct bomb hits that silenced several of the hostile weapons, thus effectively suppressing the flak over the main target area. Leading his squadron on two successive missions in the same area, by his daring attacks he again neutralized the enemy anti-aircraft and automatic weapons defending the vital bridge complex. Lieutenant Colonel Adams by his aggressive leadership and exceptional bombing accuracy contributed materially to the successful disruption of the re-supply of the enemy front line troops and the destruction of vital transportation facilities and equipment.\n\nAdams, Richard C. (USN)\n\nThe President of the United States of America takes pleasure in presenting the Distinguished Flying Cross to Lieutenant, Junior Grade Richard C. Adams (NSN: 0-512903), United States Navy, for extraordinary achievement while participating in aerial flight as a jet fighter and strike leader while attached to Fighter Squadron One Hundred Twelve (VF-112), on board the U.S.S. Philippine Sea (CV-47), in attacks against enemy rail installations and trains west of Kowon, North Korea, on 26 May 1952. By skillfully pressing home repeated bombing attacks in the face of intense anti-aircraft fire, his flight destroyed twelve railroad cars loaded with ammunition and fuel oil and also damaged many other cars with their strafing runs. Lieutenant, Junior Grade, Adams personally scored four direct hits with the four 250 pound bombs which were loaded on his F9F-2, an extraordinary feat of accurate bombing. His fortitude and determination in the face of great personal hazard and his accurate bombing under trying conditions contributed to the successful accomplishment of an important mission and were in keeping with the highest traditions of the United States Naval Service.\n\nGeneral Orders: Commander 7th Fleet: Serial 1714 (July 12, 1952)\n\nAdams, Stanley E. (USMC) (2nd award - 1st was received in WWII)\n\nGeneral Orders: Board Serial 845 - 28 September 1956\n\nThe President of the United States of America takes pleasure in presenting a Gold Star in lieu of a Second Award of the Distinguished Flying Cross to Major Stanley E. Adams (MCSN: 0-37088), United States Marine Corps, for heroism and extraordinary achievement while participating in aerial flight as a Pilot of a Plane in Marine Attack Squadron Two Hundred Twelve (VMA-212), during operations against enemy aggressor forces in Korea on 27 June 1952. Leading a flight of attack aircraft in a mission to attack a heavily defended enemy front line troop concentration, Captain Adams promptly located the enemy position without the aid of customary marking devices, initiated a bombing and strafing attack, accurately marking the target with his direct bomb hits. Despite intense enemy defensive anti-aircraft fire, which damaged his aircraft, Captain Adams led his flight in repeated attacks which accounted for the destruction of two bunkers, damage to three additional bunkers, damage to one artillery piece, destruction of one automatic weapon, and heavy damage to vital enemy supplies. By his courageous leadership, professional skill and unswerving devotion to duty, Captain Adams contributed materially to the infliction of heavy damage on the enemy and upheld the highest traditions of the United States Naval Service.\n\nAhern, Raphael (USMC) (2nd award)\n\nHeadquarters, Commanding General, 1st Marine Aircraft Wing\n\nGeneral Orders: Serial 4195 – 5 April 1952\n\nThe President of the United States of America takes pleasure in presenting a Second Gold Star in lieu of a Third Award of the Distinguished Flying Cross to Major Raphael Ahern (MCSN: 0-14500), United States Marine Corps, for heroism and extraordinary achievement while participating in aerial flight against the enemy in Korea on 9 January 1952. Major Ahern, leader of the second division of an eight-plane flight of F-4U's was directed by an airborne controller to attack a group of four artillery positions near the town of Ando-ni. Despite intense and accurate enemy anti-aircraft and ground fire, Major Ahern maneuvered his division into position and with complete disregard for his own personal safety, led them on two expertly executed dive bombing runs. He was observed by the airborne controller to have scored a direct hit on his first run and was directly responsible for destroying an enemy artillery piece and damaging a third. Major Ahern's efficient action, courageous leadership and fearless devotion to duty were in keeping with the highest traditions of the United States Naval Service.\n\nAillaud, Emmett R. Jr. (USN) (2nd award - 1st received in World War II)\n\nHeadquarters, Commander 7th Fleet\n\nGeneral Orders: Serial 541 – 6 March 1952\n\nThe President of the United States of America takes pleasure in presenting a Gold Star in lieu of a Second Award of the Distinguished Flying Cross to Ensign Emmett R. Aillaud, Jr., United States Navy, for extraordinary achievement and unswerving devotion to duty while participating in aerial flight while serving as Pilot of an attack bomber in Fighter Squadron Fifty-four (VF-54), attached to the U.S.S. Essex (CV-9), in action against enemy aggressor forces in Korea. On 4 September 1951, with courageous efficiency and utter disregard for his own personal safety, he fearlessly made repeated attacks against enemy ground troops within seventy to one hundred fifty yards of United Nations Forces. Time after time, in the face of withering fire from enemy ground troops, he made low level, scorching napalm attacks, and followed these with precision bombing and strafing until all ammunition was expended. As a result the target was neutralized to the point that friendly forces were able to secure this position shortly thereafter. Upon securing the area under attack, United Nations Forces counted over five hundred enemy dead. His gallant devotion to duty was in keeping with the highest traditions of the United States Naval Service.\n\nAillaud, Emmett R. Jr. (USN) (3rd award)\n\nGeneral Orders: All Hands (June 1954)\n\nThe President of the United States of America takes pleasure in presenting a Second Gold Star in lieu of a Third Award of the Distinguished Flying Cross to Ensign Emmett R. Aillaud, Jr., United States Navy, for extraordinary achievement while participating in aerial flight while serving as Pilot of an attack bomber in Fighter Squadron Fifty-Four (VF-54), attached to the U.S.S. Essex (CV-9), in action against hostile North Korean and Chinese Communist Forces on 29 October 1951. On that date, Ensign Aillaud was engaged on a strike against a strategic enemy headquarters located at Kapsan, North Korea. In the face of grave hazards, with precise accuracy, he pressed tree-top-level napalm runs and bombing and strafing attacks against pinpointed targets, until all ordnance was expended and the assigned area was completely demolished. His utter disregard for his own personal safety, coupled with his superb airmanship, aided immeasurably in the successful culmination of this important mission. Heavy and severe losses were sustained by the North Koreans and Chinese Communists as a result of the total destruction imposed upon this vital headquarters center and the annihilation of high ranking military leaders and their advisors. His gallant devotion to duty was at all times in keeping with the highest traditions of the United States Naval Service.\n\nAkagi, Joe L. (USN)\n\nFor heroism and extraordinary achievement in aerial flight as Pilot of a Fighter Plane in Fighter Squadron One Hundred Ninety Four, based on board the U.S.S. Boxer, during operations against enemy aggressor forces in Korea on 26 July 1953. Flying as section leader on a strike against enemy rail installations in the heavily defended area of Tanchon, Lieutenant, Junior Grade, Akagi surprised a group of two hundred enemy troops repairing damaged rails and immediately initiated strafing attacks on a rail tunnel in which the troops had taken cover. Skillfully pin-pointing his bombing attacks, he succeeded in personally sealing both ends of the tunnel to trap the enemy troops. Despite intense and accurate enemy antiaircraft fire, he carried out additional attacks which severed three railroad bridges and caused two rail cuts. After expending his bombs, he strafed and silenced two active enemy positions to permit the remainder of his flight to complete their bombing attacks. By his expert airmanship, courageous initiative and unswerving devotion to duty, Lieutenant, Junior Grade, Akagi contributed in large measure to the success of the Boxer in its assigned missions and upheld the highest traditions of the United States Naval Service.\n\nAlbers, George H.\n\nCommanding General, 1st Marine Aircraft Wing\n\nSerial: 4591 - April 13, 1952\n\nThe President of the United States of America takes pleasure in presenting the Distinguished Flying Cross to Captain George H. Albers (MCSN: 0-30556), United States Marine Corps, for extraordinary achievement while participating in aerial flight against the enemy in Korea on 3 December 1951. Captain Albers, as leader of a flight of four AD's, took off on a close air support mission at the request of the Joint Operations Center. Flying in extremely hazardous weather conditions, he led his flight to a very low altitude below a solid overcast and contacted the pre-assigned controller. Because of the low overcast and reduced visibility in the mountainous area, the controller deemed conditions too hazardous for close air strikes and recommended that the flight return to base. Climbing again through the solid overcast, Captain Albers led his flight to Kosong on the east coast, where better weather conditions prevailed. Exercising his own initiative, he contacted Marlin Control, a Tactical Air Control Party, and was ordered to contact Marlin 6, an airborne controller, for direction. Following the orders of this controller and disregarding intense ground fire, Captain Albers led a series of expertly executed bombing and rocket attacks against supply buildings in the village of Ungong-ni, personally destroying 8 of the 12 buildings destroyed. He then led his flight in repeated strafing and rocket runs against enemy troops entrenched on a ridge near Songtan-ni, resulting in 25 troops killed in action. He was then directed to destroy an artillery piece near the village of Pohyon-ni. Disregarding personal safety, he made several low reconnaissance runs to locate the target, and then led the flight in a bombing attack, destroying the artillery piece with a direct hit. When all ordnance was expended, he led his flight safely to their home base. Captain Albers' initiative, courageous leadership, efficient action and fearless devotion to duty were in keeping with the highest traditions of the United States Naval Service.\n\nAlbright, Edward H. (USN)\n\nHeadquarters, Commander 7th Fleet\n\nGeneral Orders: Serial 1071 – 17 November 1950\n\nThe President of the United States of America takes pleasure in presenting the Distinguished Flying Cross to Lieutenant, Junior Grade Edward Henry Albright (NSN: 0-419391), United States Navy, for extraordinary achievement while participating in aerial flight while serving in Fighter Squadron Fifty-Four (VF-54), in action against enemy aggressor forces in Korea from 4 July to 22 September 1950. As Pilot of a fighter plane Lieutenant, Junior Grade, Albright participated in thirty-five strike missions over enemy territory. His conduct throughout has distinguished him among those performing duties of the same character.\n\nAlbritton, Emory C. (Army)\n\n1st Lieutenant Emory C. Albritton, 0993286, Infantry, United States Army, is awarded the Distinguished Flying Cross. Lieutenant Albritton distinguished himself by extraordinary achievement while participating as Senior Jumpmaster in aerial flight over hostile territory during a nighttime, highly classified mission of critical importance to the United Nations Forces engaged in ground combat in Korea. Lieutenant Albritton, a member of the 8240th Army Unit Aviary Team, without regard for his personal safety, greatly aided the pilot in locating the drop zone for the successful completion of the mission. Lieutenant Albritton reflects great credit upon himself, the United States Army, and the United States Air Force.\n\nAldrich, Robert G. (USN)\n\nHeadquarters, Commander 7th Fleet\n\nGeneral Orders: Serial 1071 – 17 November 1950\n\nThe President of the United States of America takes pleasure in presenting the Distinguished Flying Cross to Ensign Robert G. Aldrich (NSN: 0-504416), United States Navy, for extraordinary achievement while participating in aerial flight while serving in Attack Squadron Fifty-Five (VA-55), in action against enemy aggressor forces in Korea from 3 July to 14 September 1950.

On 18 September 1952, Major Aldworth led a flight of Marine jet fighters against a heavily defended railway bridge on an enemy main supply route between Sunch'on and Wonsan. Locating the objective in extremely mountainous terrain, he skillfully maneuvered his flight through a precipitous valley and initiated the attack through intense anti-aircraft fire. He scored direct hits with his bombs collapsing two main spans of the bridge and then directed the remaining elements of his flight in the complete destruction of the target. Major Aldworth's outstanding accuracy in delivering his own bombing attack and his exemplary leadership in organizing and directing the flight were largely responsible for the success of a mission that seriously impaired the enemy's rail transportation system. His courageous conduct, professional skill, and devotion to duty throughout were in keeping with the highest traditions of the United States Naval Service.\n\nAlexander, Murl V. (USMC)\n\nHeadquarters, Commanding General 1st Marine Aircraft Wing\n\nGeneral Orders: Serial 2841 – 5 March 1952\n\nThe President of the United States of America takes pleasure in presenting the Distinguished Flying Cross to Captain Murl V. Alexander (MCSN: 0-28175), United States Marine Corps, for heroism while participating in aerial flight against the enemy, as a member of Marine Fighter Squadron Three Hundred Twelve (VMF-312), on 22 September 1951 in the vicinity of the North Korean city of Saktun-ni. While on a close air support mission, Captain Alexander led his division of four aircraft against a heavy concentration of enemy troops well entrenched in bunkers along a ridge line. Despite adverse weather conditions over the hazardous terrain, he pressed home his attack, scoring a direct hit on the open trenches with napalm, and at the same time sustaining several hits on his own aircraft from nearby anti-aircraft batteries. Despite the fact that his own aircraft was damaged, he directed his flight to continue their runs upon the troop emplacements while he diverted the enemy fire with a separate single-plane attack. Through a series of low level strafing and rocket attacks, he was able to silence the anti-aircraft batteries there by assuring the success of the mission. Captain Alexander's courage, aggressiveness, and fearless devotion to duty were in keeping with the highest traditions of the United States Naval Service.\n\nAlexander, Robert D. (USMC)\n\nGeneral Orders: Heroes U.S. Marine Corps 1861-1955 (Jane Blakeney)\n\nThe President of the United States of America takes pleasure in presenting the Distinguished Flying Cross to Captain Robert D. Alexander (MCSN: 0-39421), United States Marine Corps, for extraordinary achievement while participating in aerial flight against the enemy in Korea. On 29 October 1952, Captain Alexander led a flight of Marine attack aircraft against heavily defended enemy front line positions opposing elements of the U.S. Tenth Corps. Searching at dusk under conditions of restricted visibility, he successfully located the obscure objective in extremely mountainous terrain. Immediately initiating a coordinated attack through intense defensive fire, Captain Alexander scored direct hits with his bombs, and then despite increasingly heavy ground fire, continued to lead his flight in repeated low level bombing and strafing assaults on the enemy positions. Captain Alexander's skillful deployment of his flight under adverse conditions was largely responsible for the demolition of twelve enemy occupied bunkers, and the partial destruction of an active enemy artillery battery. His courageous actions, professional skill, and zealous devotion to duty throughout were in keeping with the highest traditions of the military service and reflect great credit upon himself, his unit and the United States Army.\n\nAllen, Gordon L. (USMC) (3rd award - 1st two received in World War II)\n\nHeadquarters, Commanding General 1st Marine Aircraft Wing\n\nGeneral Orders: Serial: 15581 – 28 September 1953\n\nThe President of the United States of America takes pleasure in presenting a Third Gold Star in lieu of a Fourth Award of the Distinguished Flying Cross to Major Gordon L. Allen (MCSN: 0-10926), United States Marine Corps, for extraordinary achievement while participating in aerial flight against the enemy as a member of a carrier-based Marine Attack Squadron in Korea. On 14 July 1953, Major Allen, in answer to an urgent request for all available air support, led a division of Marine attack aircraft against a major enemy troop concentration near Kumsong, North Korea. Despite extremely rough seas, a fifty mile per hour gale sweeping the carrier's deck and a heavy overcast, conditions that would normally preclude combat flight operations from an aircraft carrier, Major Allen safely led his division into the air, through the instrument weather and directly to the target area,. Over the objective the adverse weather prevented dive bombing attacks and he was compelled to conduct his bombing runs by the use of radar. Displaying exceptional professional ability, he scored direct bomb hits that inflicted heavy casualties on the enemy. After directing his flight in a highly successful bombing assault, he safely led the division back to the carrier. Major Allen's outstanding accuracy and exemplary leadership were responsible for the success of a mission that disrupted and repulsed one of the largest enemy offensives in over two years, thereby substantially reducing pressure on front line elements of the United Nations ground forces. His courageous conduct, exceptional initiative and steadfast devotion to duty throughout reflected great credit upon himself and were in keeping with the highest traditions of the United States Naval Service. (USN)\n\nAllen, Lawrence Richard\n\nGeneral Orders: Commander Naval Forces Far East\n\nSerial 1815 - March 5, 1951\n\nThe President of the United States of America takes pleasure in presenting the Distinguished Flying Cross to Lieutenant, Junior Grade [then Ensign] Lawrence Richard Allen (NSN: 0-496707), United States Navy, for heroism and extraordinary achievement in aerial flight as a Member of a Patrol Plane Crew in Patrol Squadron Forty-Seven (VP-47), during operations against enemy aggressor forces in Korea, from 2 July to 25 December 1950.

Major Allen led a four plane armed reconnaissance flight through adverse weather conditions to the town of Changjon, Korea. In spite of dangerously poor visibility, a low ceiling and intense enemy ground fire, he divided his flight into two units, and made a series of coordinated attacks with napalm, rockets and strafing. Major Allen made repeated attacks until all his ammunition was exhausted. One fuel dump, three supply dumps, and five houses containing approximately seventy-five hostile troops were destroyed. Major Allen's aggressive leadership, skillful airmanship and fearless devotion to duty were in keeping with the highest traditions of the United States Naval Service.\n\nAllen, Thomas C.
