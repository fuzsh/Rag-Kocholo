        "text": "Daima Lockhart Clark (IH 1938-39)\n\nScholar of African philosophy and religion\n\nDaima Lockhart Clark (also known as Daima May Clark) was married to late artist Claude Clark. She received her first master’s degree in 1941 in philosophy. Then, in 1967, she received two additional master’s degrees in theology and religious education from Pacific School of Religion. In 1974 she was ordained by the Alamo Black Clergy. She also founded the Association of Africans and African-Americans in 1978. After her husband died April 1st, 2001, that same year, she founded the Claude Clark Memorial Scholarship Fund and has been providing scholarships/awards to students of Oakland for approximately 16 years. The foundation is currently still under the care of Daima.\n\n\"If I had not come to I-House, the experiences and great opportunities that I have had since then simply would not have been possible.”\n\nEdith Simon Coliver (IH 1940-43)\n\nFirst female Field Office Director for the Asia Foundation\n\nEdith Smith was born in Karlsruhe, Germany in 1922. She moved to London with her family in 1936 after being denied an academic award for being Jewish. Two years later, she and her family moved to San Francisco, California. She received her bachelor’s degree from UC Berkeley, studying International Relations and Languages. Coliver graduated as the summa cum laude. In 1945 she worked as a translator at the founding conference of the United Nations in San Francisco and a few years after that, she went back to Germany and translated the pretrial testimony for high-ranking Nazi officer Hermann Goering. After her years of being an interpreter, she worked with Jewish refugees in a camp taken over by the U.S. Army. In 1954, Edith worked for the Asia Foundation and then in 1979, she moved to Manila where she headed the foundation’s Philippines office. She then headed the foundation’s Taiwan office in 1988 until her retirement in 1992. Though a majority of her career was mainly focused on Asia, her communal work focused a lot in the Middle East. She was a founding member of the Women’s Interfaith Dialogue on the Middle East and served on both the national and international boards of the New Israel Fund. She served on the boards of the American Friends of Hebrew University, American Friends of Neve Shalom/Wahat al Salam, International House of UC Berkeley, and the Institute for International Education.\n\n“Our greatest pleasure in those days was the folk dance evenings, where students from different, and sometimes hostile, countries danced with each other in friendship and harmony.”\n\nDelbert Wong (IH 1940)\n\nFirst Chinese-American judge in the continental U.S.\n\nDelbert E. Wong was born May 17th, 1920 in Hanford, California and was raised not too far from Bakersfield, California. He attended Bakersfield College where he received his Associate of Arts degree and then transferred to UC Berkeley. After leaving UC Berkeley, Wong joined the Army Air Corps during World War II and became one of eleven B-17 Flying Fortress navigators to graduate in his class at Mather Field in Sacramento. In 1949, Wong became the first Chinese American graduate of Stanford Law School. He was the first Asian American to be appointed Deputy Legislative Counsel serving the California State Legislature, and the first Asian American to be appointed a Deputy State Attorney General. During his time as Deputy State Attorney General, he was appointed to the Municipal Court of the Los Angeles Judicial District in 1959 which made him the first Chinese American to sit on the bench in the continental United States. Two years later, Wong was elevated to the Superior Court in which he served for over 20 years. Judge Wong died on March 10th, 2006 at the age of 85.\n\nHugh Macbeth, Jr. (IH 1941-44)\n\nLawyer and Advocate of Japanese Americans\n\nHugh E. Macbeth Jr, who died Sept. 14, 2019 at the age of 100, was an extraordinary figure. In fall 1941, Hugh Jr. enrolled at UC Berkeley’s law school and became active within International House. In collaboration with his father, Hugh resisted the infamous 9066 Executive Order imposed on Americans of Japanese descent during World War II. Hugh Jr. became a partner in his father’s firm, and the Macbeth family's work on instrumental cases such as People v. Oyama not only halted enforcement of the Alien Land Act against Japanese Americans, but established the legal grounds for future Supreme Court civil rights cases. His thirty years of private practice were a testament to his discipline. But looking for other challenges, he applied for the judicial office of Commissioner of the Superior Court. In short order, he was administering the largest Family Law court in Los Angeles County, supervising a staff of counselors and mediators, and taking the most contentious cases for himself. It was a very good fit. His technical mastery of the law joined his compassion for the ordinary lives it touched. From his May 14th, 1941 Application for Admission to I-House, Mr. Macbeth wrote: “The International House provides an opportunity for inter-stimulation of people of widely variant social, cultural, national, and racial backgrounds. More than this, it provides the only true medium through which foreign people can know, understand, sympathize, and fully realize the essential unity of all mankind and their community of purpose and problem, that is, personal and continued contact. My immediate parental background is such that the need for international and interracial understanding and cooperation has been deeply impressed upon me. Nor am I oblivious of world conditions today which shout that same need.”\n\nEmmett Rice (IH 1947-48)\n\nFulbright scholar, member of the Federal Reserve Board and Berkeley’s first African-American firefighter\n\nEmmett John Rice was born on December 21st, 1919 in Florence, South Carolina. He studied at the City College of New York, receiving a B.B.A. in 1941 and an M.B.A. in 1942. After that, he joined the U.S. Army Air Force in World War II, serving with the Tuskegee Airmen. After the war, he earned a Ph.D. in economics at UC Berkeley and was a Fulbright scholar in India. Rice was a research assistant in economics at Berkeley from 1950-51 and then became a teaching assistant in economics, teaching from 1953-54. The year before he became a teaching assistant, he was a research associate at the Reserve Bank of India as a Fulbright Fellow. From 1964 to 1966, Rice was Deputy Director, then Acting Director, of the Treasury Department's Office of Developing Nations. From 1966 to 1970, he was U.S. Alternate Executive Director for the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (World Bank), the International Development Association, and the International Finance Corporation. In 1972 he left public service to assume the position of senior vice president of the National Bank of Washington. Emmett was then appointed to the Federal Reserve Board in 1979. He passed away in 2011 at his home in Camas, Washington at the age of 91.\n\nMaggie Gee (IH 1950-51)\n\nPhysicist at Lawrence Livermore National Lab and one of the first Chinese-American aviators of the Women Airforce Service Pilots\n\nMaggie Gee was born August 5th, 1923 in Berkeley, California. She was an American aviator who served in the Women Airforce Service Pilots (WASP) in World War II. Gee was one of the two Chinese American women to serve in the organization. Since female pilots were not allowed in combat at the time, she helped male pilots train for combat and also ferried military aircraft. After graduating from UC Berkeley in physics, she worked at the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory. She is also featured in a number of books and documentaries. In 2010, she and other living pilots of WASP received the Congressional Gold Medal. Maggie served as an elected member of the Alameda County Democratic Central Committee for numerous decades and served on the California Democratic Party Executive Board and Asian Pacific Islander Democratic Caucus. She passed away in 2013 at the age of 89.\n\nPauli Murray (IH 1944-45)\n\nAttorney, poet, and the first African-American Episcopalian minister\n\nAnna Pauline “Pauli” Murray was born November 20th, 1910 in Baltimore. She was an American civil rights activist, women's rights activist, lawyer, Episcopal priest, and author. She graduated from Hunter College with a Bachelor of Arts degree in English in 1933. In 1940, Murray sat in the whites-only section of a Virginia bus with a friend, and they were arrested for violating state segregation laws. This incident and her subsequent involvement with the socialist Workers' Defense League led her to pursue her career goal of working as a civil rights lawyer. She then enrolled in law school at Howard University but even after graduating first in her class, she was denied to do post-graduate work at Harvard because she was a woman. She earned her master’s degree in law at UC Berkeley and after that, became the first woman to receive a Doctor of Juridical Science degree from Yale Law School. During her career as a lawyer, Murray argued for civil rights and women’s rights. She also served on the 1961-63 Presidential Commission on the Status of Women and in 1966, became the co-founder of National Organization for Women. She passed away in1985 in Pittsburgh due to pancreatic cancer.\n\nLearn more about her remarkable life: https://www.paulimurraycenter.com/who-is-pauli\n\nWatch the documentary trailer, My Name is Pauli Murray.\n\nVictor Santiago Pineda Ph.D. (IH 1999-00)\n\nSocial development scholar & disability rights advocate\n\nVictor Santiago Pineda was born in 1978 in Caracas, Venezuela. While attending UC Berkeley, Pineda developed his leadership skills. He was an elected Senator for the ASUC student government, defended ethnic studies, and brought back the Disabled Students Union (DSU). Also at this time, he established the Pineda Foundation in order to provide 21st-century workforce skills to youth with disabilities. Pineda earned a B.A. in Political Economy, a B.S. in Business Administration, and eventually a master’s degree in City and Regional Planning with a concentration in Regional Economic Development. In 2006, Victor received a graduate equity and diversity fellowship to pursue a doctoral degree in Urban Planning at the Luskin School for Public Affairs at UCLA. In 2009, he was awarded the US Department of Education's Fulbright-Hays Doctoral Dissertation Research Abroad Fellowship and the Sheikh Saud Qassimi Public Policy Fellowship at the Dubai School of Government and then proceeded to receive a Ph.D. for his dissertation.\n\n“I-House instilled in me a deep understanding of humanity and inspired me to contribute my knowledge about disability and human rights with the rest of the world.”\n\nWendell Lipscomb (IH 1947-48)\n\nPsychiatrist, trainer of Tuskegee Airmen & first African American to complete a residency at Kaiser Hospital\n\nWendell was born in Berkeley in 1920. During World War II he became an instructor for the Tuskegee Airman, the first African Americans to fly airplanes for the Army Air Corps in Alabama. After the war ended, he had applied to many different airliners to become a commercial pilot, but none of them were accepting African-American pilots at the time. Since he couldn’t find stability in flying, he decided to head to college and graduated from San Diego State College in 1947 and then enrolled in medical school at UC Berkeley. Lipscomb then graduated in 1953 and soon after, he moved to Korea during the war. After returning to America, he returned to school and graduated with his master’s in public health from the University of Michigan. Wendell became the first African-American to do his residency at Kaiser Hospital in Oakland. He did not stop there though. He pursued other interests such as serving as the supervisor of the alcoholism project for the California State Department of Public Health. He also did a residence at the Mendocino State Hospital as a psychiatrist. Unfortunately, Wendell Lipscomb passed away in May of 2004 at the age of 83.\n\nWendy Schmidt (IH 1978-80) I-House Alumna of the Year 2014\n\nPresident and co-founder of the Schmidt Family Foundation and the Schmidt Ocean Institute (SOI)\n\nWendy Schmidt was born July 26th, 1995 in Orange, New Jersey.
