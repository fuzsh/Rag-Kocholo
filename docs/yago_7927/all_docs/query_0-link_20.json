        "text": "The administration of partify.io is constantly improving technology to help address issues related to the illegal distribution of content. The Places charity project section is a charitable social network and it is a charity project created by the Tech4Art Foundation Swiss charity foundation to promote museums and galleries around the world and the project does not make any commercial profit. Some of the content in Places has been donated by the foundation and any user who has contributed by providing information on museums and galleries. As the Project partify.io we check as much as possible for copyright infringement, but unfortunately not all users who have submitted information about a museum or gallery have done so correctly and have not infringed anyone's copyrights. We can't rule out that this does not rule out complaints about copyright infringement by users and right owners. The charity social network Project Places is obliged to take measures to stop them as it may act as an information intermediary.\n\nIf the author is facing an infringement of rights, the administration of the social network recommends to contact the infringer directly by sending an email to [email protected]. According to the representatives of partify.io, it is often possible to resolve the conflict directly woth foundation before contacting the support desk. If this is not possible, the author may contact the administration of the site to have the post or page of the offender blocked by filling out the form in the contact section.\n\nThe application must contain: information about the applicant: first name and last name, contact information for individuals; name, location and address, contact information for legal entities, details of the illegally posted content, e.g. the URL of the page where the material was published and a link to the original source an indication that the copyright or related rights holder did not have permission to post the item documents, files and links proving title to the disputed item.\n\nIf you do not attach evidence to the request for removal, the administration may not respond to the complaint. To avoid ending up in a situation where the author does not have proof of rights, we recommend that you think about it beforehand, e.g. by depositing the copyright in the file.\n\nAfter reviewing the application with the attached evidence, the social network removes the disputed object from the resource. If the situation is reversed, for example, the work has been removed from the site, but the author can prove his rights to it, he also needs to submit an application with reliable information about the rights to the disputed object."
