        "text": "Her Highness Princess Sudasiri Sobha was born on 16 December 1921, eldest daughter of His Royal Highness Prince Chudadhuj Dharadilok, Prince of Bejraburna, and Mom La-or Sirisambhand. She was also the eldest grand daughter of Her Majesty Queen Sri Bajarindra, the Regent Queen.\n\nPrince Chudadhuj died when the princess was only two years old. She therefore went to live with her great aunt, Her Royal Higness Princess Busban Buapan in the Grand Palace. She lived there until aged 18.\n\nPrincess Sudasiri received her education in the Grand Palace, and then attended the Queen's school, Rajini School. While she was preparing to go to Switzerland, to receive further education in the care of His Majesty King Rama VI, her uncle, when World War II broke out in Europe. She therefore had to remain in Thailand, and received further education here instead. She was then under the care of Her Majesty Queen Savang Vadhana (Queen Sri Savarindira), and went to live with her at Sukhothai Palace.\n\nPrincess Sudasiri married His Serene Highness Mom Chao Suvinit Kitiyakara, son of the Prince of Chandaburi in 1943. They have two daughters,\n\nMom Rajawongse Sunida Kitiyakara and\n\nMom Rajawonge Saovanit Kitiyakara\n\nHer Highness was involved in many projects and charities all for the betterment of the livelihood of the Thai people, which is continued to this day by her surviving daughter, Mom Rajawongse Sunida. She was also interested in the preservation of old monuments of historical importance to Thailand; one that was dear to her heart was Tamnak Prathom, her father's main residence in Bangkok. When the land at the family's Petchaburana Palace reverted back to the royal treasury, she asked for permission to relocate the villas in the palace compound to a piece of land in Nondhaburi Province. The villas are now private museums, open to the public on special occasions, so that the younger generations can learn more about the Prince and his family, as well as Thailand's past."
