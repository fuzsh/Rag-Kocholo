        "text": "Dara Rasami as Matron of Lan Na Culture: 1914–33\n\nDara Rasami truly began to come into her own as a siwilai matron of Lan Na culture following her return to Chiang Mai in 1914. In the last period of her life, from her retirement until her death in 1933, Dara’s activities reflected the values of her particular worldview and its effect on the types of matronage in which she engaged. This period sheds additional light on the gendered aspects of her activities and the differences between the roles of Siamese and Lan Na elite women. In addition to promoting Lan Na arts and culture, Dara’s participation extended to activities more consistent with masculine forms of patronage practiced by siwilai Siamese elite males—but which were quite consistent with Lan Na elite female matronage of prior generations. In addition to her matronage of dance, drama, and textile arts, there were two main areas in which Dara demonstrates a matronage informed by notions of siwilai: as a matron of medicine and agriculture, and as an amateur scholar of Lan Na cultural history. First, however, let us begin with a discussion of what matronage means.\n\nDefining “Matronage”\n\nIn discussing Dara Rasami’s activities following her retirement, I utilize the concept of “matronage” coined by Linda Nochlin, who was among the first to bring feminist critique to the field of art history.5 Nochlin’s essay challenged the field’s structural sexism by questioning the absence of women from the categories of “greatness” and “genius,” and the “system of gendered exclusion that rejected them in the first place.”6 In the nearly four decades since, feminist art history has responded by investigating the gendering of artistic activities and the division of artistic labor, furthering the critique by examining their intersections with race, class, and postcolonialism. More recently, scholars have begun applying these considerations to how women have acted as “matrons” (versus “patrons”) of artistic endeavors in a variety of Asian contexts. Elsewhere I have explored Dara Rasami’s use of her privilege as an elite Lan Na woman and royal Siamese consort to support particular forms of cultural expression that persist down to the present day in northern Thailand.7 It is in this sense that I use the term “matron” to describe Dara as an important promoter of Lan Na culture.\n\nMusic, Dance-Drama, and Textiles\n\nSince her days as a consort living in the Royal Palace in Bangkok, Dara Rasami and her ladies-in-waiting had practiced the arts of music and dance in her palace residence, in Lan Na, Siamese, and Western modes. This blending of styles and instruments continued after Dara Rasami’s retirement in Chiang Mai.\n\nBack in Chiang Mai, Dara Rasami’s younger half brother (and new city governor), Chao Kaew Nowarat, had built her a new residence in anticipation of her return. The new house was called KhumChediKiu (the Chedi Palace), after a small stupa/chedi located outside the compound’s walls on the corner of the lot. The site was located—as were many elite residences in early twentieth-century Chiang Mai—between the eastern wall of the old city and the western bank of the Ping River. In addition to her residence, there was also a space called the RongKii (or Kii Hall), which was a “long, open room flanked by columns, used as a rehearsal space for dance and lakhon.”8 There, Dara Rasami oversaw the training of many young women in the traditional forms of Lan Na dance, as well as the new Siamese styles. Among her students were many of the daughters of the Chiang Mai nobility as well as those of the Siamese administrators living in Chiang Mai. These high-born students included her foster daughter Than Phuying Chatrsudha Wongtongsri (née Chatrchai), who later became a teacher of Lan Na dance herself; also Chao Jamrut na Chiang Mai; Chao Saeng Sawang Sirorote; Chao Butsaban Sirorote; Chao Wowdao na Chiang Mai; Chao Khrua Gaew na Chiang Mai; Samruay (Manowong) Bunnag; Sompun (Duangsing) Chotana; and others. However, it was not only the elite who danced at the Rong Kii. Another source notes that “[there were] children of average villagers who were interested in dance—not a few—that she took on as dancers at the palace” (see figure 8).9\n\nDara Rasami employed several teachers (kru) at the Rong Kii, a number of whom had trained as dancers in the palace of her late half brother, former governor Chao Intawarorot, whose troupe had incorporated Bangkok palace dances into their repertoire.10 The teachers of Dara’s troupe at the Rong Kii included Mom [Lady] Sae, Kru Pun, Kru Puen, and Kru Thuy.11 Dara took a personal interest in the training at the Rong Kii, often observing the rehearsals held there every morning from 10:00 a.m. to noon, and afternoons from 3:00 to 6:00 p.m. One observer noted that Dara would\n\n. . . come to supervise the dance practice herself. If anyone made a mistake, they had to endure punishment—be hit, pinched, or thumped with a fist. All her nieces and the other dancers were very afraid of [Dara]. But in the end, when the work was authentic and proper, she was satisfied/happy.12\n\nIn addition to monitoring dance instruction, Dara Rasami was instrumental in recording and refining the various positions and gestures of both Lan Na and Bangkok dance styles. For example, she wrote down dances like the fingernail dance, which she adapted from old Lan Na palace dance forms, and the candle dance, both of which became styles identified with traditional Lan Na culture (even as she updated them to appeal to contemporary audiences).13 She codified local forms of dance-drama that utilized northern instruments, rhythms, and vocalizations called lakhon saw, creating a dramatic form much closer to the new Siamese form of lakhonrong, or singing plays. The similarities of lakhon saw style to the modern lakhon rong, blended with elements of exotic northern difference, appealed greatly to the new Siamese audience in Chiang Mai. Most significantly here, however, Dara Rasami went a step further in creating her own lakhon saw play, called PhraLoh WaenKaew (Lady of the Crystal Ring), sometimes also called NoiChaiya. In contrast to the tragic northern heroine embodied in SaoKhrua Fa (the Siamese adaptation of Madame Butterfly), the female protagonist of Dara’s play defied cultural norms to reject the man her parents chose to be her husband, and instead runs away with her lover, even though he is of lower social status than she is. Parts of this play were often performed in Chiang Mai during events held to receive official guests or celebrate high holidays, and its signature song, “Noi Chaiya,” is still well known and performed for functions around Chiang Mai today.14\n\nWhile Lan Na’s nobility had a long tradition of court lakhon dancers, they were typically supported by the male ruler’s household.15 Dara Rasami’s matronage of the arts in Chiang Mai was significant in consolidating existing local traditions and extending the appeal of Lan Na dance and music, which were in danger of losing ground to Siamese dance and dramatic styles following the political integration of Lan Na into the Siamese thetsaphibaan administrative structure in the 1890s. As Chiang Mai continued to see an increasing flow of Siamese officials and Siamese culture into the area, Dara Rasami’s matronage ensured the continued relevance of Lan Na dance and dramatic styles to the area. The training she provided guaranteed ongoing employment for local dancers by supplying the growing community of Siamese officials in Chiang Mai with performers and dances that they considered both sufficiently “exotic” and “authentic” enough, but which simultaneously incorporated enough central Thai elements to render them comfortably recognizable to a Siamese audience.\n\nDara Rasami’s promotion of local dance traditions had the additional effect of promoting Lan Na’s distinct textiles as well. In her riverside compound in Chiang Mai, she had two rooms set up adjacent to the Rong Kii with looms for the weaving of phasin textiles.16 This filled the need for special textiles required by palace dancers in particular, as “the [phasin] of northerners used in dance especially demonstrated the status of the wearer as well. If it was a ‘dance’ phasin, materials of silver and gold thread were woven into [its] stripes.”17\n\nDara Rasami also promoted Lan Na textiles outside the dance and performance space. At the home she later built on a piece of rural farmland, Dara Phirom Palace in Mae Rim, she installed looms in the shady area underneath the raised house where local girls could learn to weave traditional patterns.18 Her interest in textiles and weaving was at least in part inherited from her aunt, the aforementioned Ubonwanna, who was considered an expert in local textiles. Ubonwanna had directly managed the production of textiles at her household, where slave women could often be seen working at the looms on the front veranda of her house. 19\n\nDara was also interested in maintaining the local patterns practiced in the rural villages scattered among the mountains near Chiang Mai, and she traveled to collect them as well. Her foster daughter Chatrsudha Wongtongsri claims Dara Rasami would ride miles to visit the village of Mae Chaem, where the highest-quality teen jok patterns could be found.20 But it appears that she knew her way around a loom herself: Chatrsudha notes that Dara Rasami had woven a number of traditional Lan Na-style shoulder bags to donate to monks at her sixtieth birthday celebration only a few months before her death at the end of 1933.21\n\nMost notable is Dara Rasami’s gradual movement from performer to patron—or in this instance, matron. Whereas many women of both noble and common birth participated in music and dance as performers, there are few examples of women as sponsors of such activities; that role was typically reserved for male elites, the noblemen, or kings whose prestige was enhanced by performers’ presence in their households. As a matron devoted to sponsoring—and not merely performing in—Lan Na arts, Dara’s pattern of participation aligned more closely with those practiced by Siamese noblemen rather than those of Siamese elite women of her era.\n\nDara Rasami as Modern Matron of Medicine and Agriculture\n\nIn addition to supporting, maintaining, and preserving local traditions of Lan Na dance, Dara’s matronage took other forms consistent with those practiced by her Siamese contemporaries, especially relating to Western medical practices and facilities. Siam’s royals had experience with Western medicine beginning with the first Protestant missionaries who came to Bangkok in the 1830s, and they eagerly accepted vaccination and surgery as complements to traditional Thai medicinal practices. King Chulalongkorn founded Siriraj Hospital in 1888 and sponsored the British-founded Bangkok Nursing Hospital (now known as BNH) in 1897. The standard of royal medical patronage was feminized around the turn of the twentieth century, as Queen Saovabha initiated the first branch of the Red Cross in Siam, modeling elite women’s support of medical enterprises as siwilai practice.\n\nDara Rasami’s family had a similar history of exposure to Western medicine, also through Protestant Christian missionaries in Chiang Mai. Dara’s parents had maintained their belief in the efficacy of Western medicine despite having lost a child to a failed vaccination attempt in 1868.22 Nonetheless, Chiang Mai’s royal family continued to have a close relationship with the missionaries, encouraging their activities by granting them funds and land for their residences, hospitals, and schools in Chiang Mai. When Dara Rasami’s mother died in 1884, it was noted not only that missionary Dr. Peoples had been entirely in charge of her care, but also that “Mrs. McGilvary was with her at her death, and remained to see the body dressed for the coffin. We missed her very much as a friend.”23\n\nFollowing her return to Chiang Mai, Dara Rasami appears to have had a similarly close relationship with the missionaries of Chiang Mai, acting as a matron of their medical activities and facilities between 1915 and 1933. She built on her parents’ legacy of support for the local Presbyterian missionaries, donating funds for the expansion of McCormick Hospital and the McKean Leper Colony.24 When the latter opened new housing for its patients in 1923, she even enlisted the help of her old friend Prince Damrong to assist in the ribbon-cutting ceremonies. Dara Rasami represented Siamese royalty by giving a speech at the reception luncheon held for the hundred local Western and Lan Na elites who attended the occasion.25\n\nDara’s siwilai orientation familiarized her with other contemporary sciences, particularly agriculture. Even before her retirement to Chiang Mai, Dara’s agricultural bent was noted by King Chulalongkorn while she visited Chiang Mai in 1909; in two of his letters to Dara, he makes a point of updating her on the condition of a lamduan tree she planted just before her departure.26 During the same visit, local Chinese merchants allegedly presented Dara with five lamyai trees, two of which she brought back with her and planted in Bangkok. Dara’s passion for growing things soon developed in a philanthropic direction, which was aided by several Siamese and Lan Na elites—most notably, Mom Chao Sithiphon Kridakorn (1883–1971), who came to be known as the “father of Thai agriculture.” After a successful twenty-year career in the royal administration, Sithiphon resigned in 1921, moving to the rural village of Bang Berd approximately 250 miles south of Bangkok (near Hua Hin), where he and his wife set up an experimental farm and founded the agricultural journal Kasikorn (1927). After he was appointed director-general of the Agricultural Inspection Department in 1931, he expanded his agricultural project to establish three experimental agriculture stations to the north, northeast, and south of Siam.27 Dara and Sithiphon shared several Lan Na connections. His father, Prince Boworadet (1877–1947), who had served as viceroy of monthon Payap from 1915 to 1926, had married Dara’s former lady-in-waiting, Thipawaan, and lived for several years in a mountainside retreat next door to Dara Rasami’s just outside Chiang Mai. Sithiphon himself was married to Mom Chao Siphroma, a Lan Na woman of the Nan royal family (who had also served in King Chulalongkorn’s court).28\n\nDara Rasami shared an interest in agriculture with a number of other Lan Na elites. Chao Cheun Sirorote (1896–1996), one of the founding instructors of Chiang Mai’s agricultural college, had knowledge of cultivating Virginia tobacco and other crops new to Siam.29 Chao Thipawaan, Dara’s former lady-in-waiting, made her fortune as the first to cultivate and cure Virginia tobacco in Chiang Mai following her divorce from Prince Borowadet in 1926.30\n\nLike these elites, Dara Rasami saw both obstacles and opportunities for local farmers to adjust their practices to better meet the market realities of Siam’s changing economy. To pursue this interest, however, Dara needed a bigger plot of land than the rose garden at Khum Chedi Kiu. Not long after her return to Chiang Mai, she began seeking a space of her own on which to build her own residence and farm.31 She eventually found her ideal site about nine miles north of Chiang Mai near the village of Mae Rim, where the soil was fertile and there was an ample water source in the nearby Mae Sa River. Although the exact dates are not known, it is estimated that she broke ground on her new farm not long after her return to Chiang Mai in 1915, and that the residence—Dara Phirom Palace—was ready to move into by 1920.32\n\nThere Dara Rasami became a local matron of modern agriculture for Chiang Mai. The seventy rai of land surrounding the Dara Phirom residence, known as SuanChaoSabai (Garden of the Princess’s Happiness), served as a kind of laboratory for experimenting with new agricultural techniques and crops.33 On her new farm, Dara Rasami cultivated both native and foreign species of both ornamental and fruiting trees, flowers, and crops. Dara recognized the challenges local farmers faced as the local economy shifted away from subsistence farming toward the raising of cash crops. She used her farm to evaluate which fruits and vegetables farmers could easily grow to sell.34 Through her connections to Lan Na and Siamese nobility, Dara Rasami brought several new crops to Chiang Mai which subsequently became economically important. Using seeds and agricultural knowledge obtained from the aforementioned Sithiphon Kridakorn, Dara introduced cabbage to northern farmers, who were able to sell their produce to Bangkok at a profit. She took a personal interest in these agricultural pursuits, as is evident in the account of a local farmer whom she encouraged to grow cantaloupe:\n\nI planted the “farang” melon using the special-formula fertilizer of Chao Sithiphon [Kridakorn], and the fruit looked very good. They were smaller than Thai melon, but sweeter. I took one to give to Dara, and she was very impressed by its sweetness. I sent one as an example to a hotel in Bangkok—the Hotel Trocadero. Their manager answered me that if I had any more like the one I’d sent, he’d buy them all at thirty satang a pound—around three pounds for a baht.35\n\nDara Rasami is also credited with the introduction of a new variety of lamyai tree to Chiang Mai, whose fruit became another important cash crop for northern Thai farmers.36 In addition to cantaloupe and lamyai, Dara also planted Chinese cabbage, bamboo shoots, rambutan, lychee, purple cabbage, sweet and sour tamarind, mangosteen, coconuts, pomegranates, rose apples, and star apples in the fields at Mae Rim. Though she continued to grow her beloved roses at Suan Chao Sabai, her involvement in experimental agriculture demonstrates both her high esteem of scientific siwilai and her desire to benefit the people of Lan Na through agricultural knowledge. In the next form of matronage we will examine, Dara Rasami combined science with her concern for the survival of local culture to become a matron of a wholly new kind: a matron of historical knowledge.\n\nDara Rasami as Matron of Cultural History\n\nIn addition to her support of medical activities, Dara Rasami also became a well-known repository of local cultural history. Her interest in Chiang Mai’s local history can be traced to two distinct sources: first, her family’s deep connection to and knowledge of Lan Na history; and second, her friendship with Prince Damrong, who is known as the father of Thai history.\n\nDara Rasami was steeped in Lan Na myth and history as she grew up and was raised by Lan Na elites who passed along their knowledge to her. According to British explorer Holt Hallett, who visited Chiang Mai in the early 1880s, Dara’s aunt Ubonwanna shared with him the story of Lan Na’s legendary Queen Chamathewi, prompting Hallett to call her “the historian of the Chiang Mai palace.”37 Other British officials of the time describe Ubonwanna as “the person who knows the story of Chiang Mai better than anyone else.”38 As Dara Rasami lived with her aunt for about two years following her mother’s death in 1884, she would certainly have learned these and many other stories during her childhood. More importantly, Dara grew up amid royal women for whom family and local histories were both personally and historically meaningful.\n\nDara Rasami and Prince Damrong had become friends during her career in the Bangkok palace, a relationship they maintained after her return to Chiang Mai in 1915. Their connection during this period is evidenced both by Dara’s numerous appearances in his (voluminous) collected correspondence, and by Damrong’s repeated visits to Dara in Chiang Mai (often with a few of his daughters in tow). For our purposes, the most important link shared by Prince Damrong and Dara Rasami was their appreciation of learning and historical knowledge. Damrong, who had translated and published the corpus of Siamese royal chronicles in updated Thai language, traveled extensively to archaeological sites all over Southeast Asia in his later life, and wrote extensively on Thai history and antiquities. Dara Rasami appears to have shared his passion for knowledge, as she herself engaged in similar activities following her return to Chiang Mai. In a 1931 letter, Damrong responded to another scholar seeking information about the use of currency in old Lan Na that “I will ask [Dara Rasami], because she knows better than I do.”39 In their subsequent correspondence on the subject, Dara described to Damrong the evidence she had found in traveling around the area, and also explained that she had been reading the “ancient chronicles” to see if she could find any additional past references.40 She subsequently set up the first central library in Chiang Mai, looking to the model of Damrong’s recently-created National Library in Bangkok.41 Damrong’s daughter later said of Dara:\n\nI once asked some Westerners in the timber trade who had come from living in the north about how the northern rulers really were. They told me that the “stupid” rulers of Chiang Mai were really very smart. And “the Queen of Chiang Mai” was what they called [Dara Rasami].42\n\nAccording to her foster daughter during that period, Chatrsudha Wongtongsri, Dara traveled extensively throughout the region surrounding Chiang Mai to gather historical data from surviving members of the old nobility, as well as any artifacts she could find. These journeys through the thickly forested, mountainous terrain of the region often necessitated travel on horseback or by elephant, as paved roads had not yet been laid.43 On these travels, Dara Rasami was usually accompanied by Chatrsudha herself, who—like her European-educated mother, Laddakham—was a skilled horsewoman.44 Dara Rasami’s horseback journeys to the village of Mae Chaem to collect samples of the beautiful teen jok textiles are still known to people living in Chiang Mai today.45 Part of the impetus behind these activities appears to have been Dara’s consciousness of the importance of the past in maintaining a people’s cultural identity—and the potential for loss of Lan Na culture and/or history, as the Siamese became increasingly involved in the governance of Chiang Mai, and elite cultural expressions. Dara Rasami went to great lengths to ensure that her own generation of Chiang Mai’s royal family was not forgotten. Not long after returning to Chiang Mai in 1914, she and her foster daughter Laddakham saddled horses and rode to the top of Doi Angkhan, the highest peak in Thailand, where she carried out her father’s wishes to have his remains interred atop the mountain, which she subsequently re-named Doi Inthanon after him. Their timing was not the best, however: after burying the “gold-plated box containing [Inthawichyanon’s] bones,” the temperature dropped into the lower 40s and the women were stuck in their camp on the mountaintop for two days.46\n\nPrince Damrong himself made several journeys to visit Dara Rasami in Chiang Mai, and recognized her expertise in the cultural history of Lan Na on several occasions. When approached by scholars seeking information on topics related to Lan Na’s history, he often referred them to Dara Rasami. In August of 1923, Prince Damrong wrote to Dara Rasami to introduce a young Suzanne Karpeles, visiting on a scholarship from the French government to study the histories and customs of the countries of the Tonkin region:\n\n[Regarding] Miss Karbolet [sic], a French student who knows Pali, Sanskrit and Thai. . . . She would also like to go to Chiang Mai in order to see the country and study ancient history. She has told me that for knowledge of northern antiquities, your expertise is like no one else’s in Payap province, and she has heard many praise your character. . . . In my view Miss Karbolet is very proper, loves learning, and would get along well with you. Please accept this letter of introduction and help make Miss Karbolet comfortable when she comes to Chiang Mai so that she can study and seek knowledge as she wishes.47\n\nThe knowledge of her home region’s history that Dara Rasami gained through travel, collecting oral history, and reading older texts earned her a reputation over time as a local historical expert among Western and Siamese scholars alike. But it also represents a marked departure from the practices of her female Siamese counterparts. Culturally, femaleness tended to be far more strongly associated with “inside” than the masculine, dangerous “outside” in mainland Southeast Asia.48 In Siam, the careers of royal consorts within the palace would have habituated them to the luxury and security of life behind palace walls, and few would have considered undertaking the difficult and sometimes dangerous journeys that Dara Rasami and her foster daughter did—particularly without the accompaniment of elite males. In this respect, Dara’s activities appear more consistent with those of Siamese male contemporaries such as Prince Damrong, rather than Siamese elite women, for whom such solo travels would have been quite unthinkable. Despite her own long years living within the confines of the palace, Dara Rasami’s youthful experiences of the outside, while traveling between Chiang Mai and Bangkok with her parents, may have been a key factor that rendered possible the outdoor journeys she made later in life. Perhaps the proscription against the outside among elite women was weaker in the north, where women’s status was higher and “traditions of female governance were stronger” than in Siam.49 In any event, Dara Rasami’s research travels represent a major divergence between the practice of cultural matronage in Lan Na and those of Siamese elite women of the same era.\n\nDara Rasami’s Role in Contemporary Memory\n\nDara’s post-palace life in Chiang Mai appears to have been relatively healthy and happy. She divided her time between the farm in Mae Rim and her summer residence on the mountainside at Doi Suthep, and by all accounts was kept very busy by her many interests and projects. She continued to include children in her household, as is evident from a number of photographs of the era. In one, Dara conducts a soul-tying ceremony with a relative’s infant child; in another, she is shown working in her rose garden accompanied by her young foster daughter Chatrsudha Chatrchai. Even after her foster children left Dara’s household, she continued to support them, financing the education of several children abroad in Europe.53\n\nDespite her return to her Chiang Mai roots, Dara Rasami did not allow her Bangkok connections to lapse. In fact, Dara made an annual visit to Bangkok every August around the time of her birthday. During her visits she stayed with Queen Savang Vadhana, one of Chulalongkorn’s other highest-status queens, with whom she had become close friends.54 During these visits, the women shared their mutual pastimes of sewing and needlework, and enjoyed playing cards as they had in the palace, sometimes gambling late into the night.55\n\nAltogether, Dara lived in Chiang Mai for nineteen years following her retirement from palace life in Bangkok. The last year of her life, however, witnessed tumultuous times in Siam. On June 24, 1932, a group of civilian reformers brought the absolute monarchy to a sudden end with a change of government that introduced a constitution and body of elected representatives to the Thai state.56 The change was anything but universally embraced among Siam’s elites and commoners alike, who were at first mystified by the appearance of the radical new Khana Ratsadon party. Among those opposed was Dara’s old friend—and former Chiang Mai resident—Prince Boworadet, who along with several other princes launched an unsuccessful rebellion in October of 1933. On the failure of his counterrevolution, Boworadet and his second wife escaped by airplane to live in exile in Vietnam and Cambodia.57 The prince’s son, Sithiphon, who had shared his agricultural know-how with Dara, was imprisoned for several years for taking part in his father’s rebellion.58 The events surrounding the change of government also swept up Dara’s friend Prince Damrong, who was forced into exile in Penang, Malaysia, in the fall of 1933. In little more than a year, the familiar world in which Dara Rasami and her royal counterparts had lived was turned upside down: the course of history had irreversibly changed, taking with it a way of life.\n\nDara’s old lung ailment returned in the spring of 1933. No doubt the difficult events of that summer and fall took their toll on Dara’s already fragile health. Telegrams of the time show that King Prajadhipok sent 5,000 baht for her medical care, and Damrong wrote expressing great concern, promising to try to visit (even though his own situation at that point was politically precarious).59 Although her half brother took her in to care for her at his residence at Khum Rinkaew, Dara Rasami died on December 9, only a few months after her sixtieth birthday.60 Queen Savang Vadhana telegraphed Chao Kaew Nowarat to express her “great sadness at this unexpected tragedy.”61 Dara Rasami’s funeral events in April of 1934 were attended by both members of the former Chiang Mai royal family (such as her half brother Major General Kaew Nowarat) and Siamese administrators sent up to Chiang Mai from Bangkok—a total of 287 officials.62 From photographs of the time, it appears most of Chiang Mai’s population turned out to join the procession to Wat Suan Dok for her cremation ceremony (see figure 9). Dara’s ashes were divided and interred in two different locations: half reside in Dara’s monument in the royal cemetery at Wat Suan Dok in Chiang Mai, while the other half are interred in her monument at the women’s cemetery adjacent to Wat Rajabophit in Bangkok, along with her daughter’s ashes.\n\nDara Rasami as an Ambiguous Symbol of Lan Na Identity\n\nGiven Dara Rasami’s unique historical role in maintaining and preserving Lan Na identity, one might wonder whether her memory could be considered threatening to the Thai nation-state. After all, many elements of the Lan Na identity as it is expressed in Chiang Mai today stem directly from the “invented traditions” Dara Rasami created following her return home in 1914. However, these invented traditions, coupled with Dara Rasami’s foothold in the central Thai royal family, have created a uniquely ambiguous niche for her in local culture: a figure whose memory is championed by localists and royalists alike, albeit in different moments.\n\nSince her death, Dara Rasami has figured in Chiang Mai’s local memory in unusual ways. At times, Dara’s image appears alongside those of her male relatives as part of the greater lineage of Chiang Mai royalty, as in the display located in the bot (main hall) at Wat Phra Singh. Tourists and locals may know her through the museum at Dara Phirom Palace, the house Dara built at her experimental farm, Suan Chao Sabai in Mae Rim. The house, which fell into disuse after her death, was utilized from the 1940s to 1960s by the Thai military. Ownership of the property eventually fell to Chulalongkorn University, which undertook a complete restoration of the house in the late 1980s. The prominent role played by the current Thai royalty (late King Bhumibhol’s older sister, Princess Kalyani Wattana [d. 2008], and daughter, Princess Sirindhorn) in the renovation and reopening of Dara’s house as a museum in 1990 additionally helped to revive Dara Rasami’s role in local history. At the same time, the presence of the contemporary Thai royal family in this event served to reify the close—yet subordinate—relationship of both Dara Rasami and Chiang Mai itself to Bangkok royalty.\n\nLocal memory of Dara Rasami and her historical role is ambiguous, at times even problematic. After Dara Rasami’s return to Chiang Mai in 1914, apocryphal stories attribute her move to Mae Rim to discomfort with the suspicion expressed toward her by local Chiang Mai residents, who felt she was an outsider, having lived in Bangkok for too long. This notion seems to have some traction, particularly in recent years as northern history, language, and cultural difference have experienced a renaissance in Chiang Mai. Although undoubtedly several local cultural forms benefited from Dara’s patronage, there is some debate as to whether they became too “Siamized” in the process. Chiang Mai’s local historians and proponents of Lan Na studies seem to have some difficulty deciding which side Dara Rasami was on, exactly. One local scholar described Dara Rasami to me as “the skeleton in the closet” of Chiang Mai’s nobility.63 Dara Rasami’s status as both a Chiang Mai insider and Bangkok outsider makes it difficult to claim her as fully embodying either “authentic” Lan Na culture or history.\n\nYet Dara Rasami’s status among regular Chiang Mai folk is not so difficult to parse. Mention of Dara Rasami to local people in Chiang Mai often elicits stories of ancestors with connections to her household.64 The annual celebration of Dara’s birthday, held at Dara Phirom Palace every August, features Buddhist ceremonies with chanting monks as well as dance performances, and appears to be very well attended by local people.65 However, when compared to Siamese royals, her visibility as a famous figure is clearly not equal. For example, while one can find any number of vendors selling amulets featuring the image of King Chulalongkorn in Chiang Mai’s local markets, it is difficult to find images of Dara Rasami for sale—and sometimes the vendors do not recognize her name when asked.\n\nIn examining Dara’s legacy in local memory, there is an interesting comparison to make between her and a contemporary local figure similarly important to Lan Na identity: Buddhist forest monk Khruba Srivichai (1878–1938), whose “statues, photographs and amulets can be found at Buddhist temples and homes throughout the region.”66 Born in Amphur Lii just north of Lamphun—allegedly in the middle of a thunderstorm—Khruba’s controversial career overlapped Dara Rasami’s later years in both Bangkok and Chiang Mai.67 Like Dara Rasami, Khruba similarly lived through the era during which Siam solidified its control over the previously sovereign kingdoms of Lan Na. Unlike Dara, however, Khruba Srivichai became emblematic of resistance against Siamese domination, and the figurehead of a millenarian movement that blossomed throughout Lan Na from the 1910s to the 1930s. From early in his career, the monk had driven a number of several important temple restorations and construction projects—an unusual arena for monastic aspirations. His projects included rebuilding the reliquary at the Chamathewi temple in Lamphun, and building the road just outside Chiang Mai that leads up the side of Doi Suthep to the temple at the top. These he achieved through a combination of lay donations and volunteer labor (yet another finger in the eye of the Siamese), establishing the monk’s reputation as a charismatic leader of people in addition to his religious leadership. Khruba Srivichai’s “public works” approach to local modernization also drew a stark contrast to the exploitation and neglect many Lan Na people experienced at the hands of the Siamese authorities (and their tax collectors) in that turbulent era.\n\nIn addition to his massive popular following, Khruba Srivichai gained a passionate backing from local monks who chafed at Bangkok’s attempts to extend spiritual authority over the local Buddhist sangha, preferring Khruba’s charismatic ordination instead. The revered monk’s practice of Lan Na-style “forest” Buddhism held great appeal to local laypeople and monastics alike, as it functioned as an expression of both cultural and religious resistance to incipient Siamese hegemony. To Siamese authorities, Khruba Srivichai’s authority was dangerous for precisely the same reasons. The monk was detained and released several times by the Siamese authorities and ultimately stripped of his titles; he was even summoned to appear in Bangkok in both 1920 and 1935 to answer to Siam’s Supreme Patriarch himself before being allowed to return to Lan Na.68\n\nKhruba Srivichai’s rise corresponded to the massive social and economic changes occurring in Lan Na communities as a direct result of Siam’s new administrative and tax practices. The 1900 Ministry of the Interior Order, which established themonthontawantokchiangnua (northwest circle), completely overhauled the civil service structure in the north. Positions, salaries, and responsibilities were reorganized, and while northern nobles could still apply, “many were not invited since the King wanted . . . only the talented.”69 As taxation shifted from in-kind payments made to local rulers to a flat four baht “head-tax” by often extortive tax collectors, villagers and farmers felt increasingly oppressed by new Siamese systems. Although villagers unable to pay the tax were allowed to perform corvée labor instead, Siamese officials frequently abused the practice well beyond the legal twenty-day limit, deploying thousands of “free” local laborers in the building of roads, bridges, and canals.70 Karen locals recalled that sometime between 1900 and 1910, “they and some Thai killed the first Nai Amphoe of Ping Tai (now Hot) district over taxation matters,” which “prompted a Thai armed presence and the moving of the District seat to Chiang Khoeng village.”71 Droughts and famines throughout the 1910s compounded the situation, with moneylenders seizing fields from farmers whose crops had failed, and rice shortages forcing many families to leave.72 In 1912, a Lampang observer reported that “I have heard a lot about the wholesale removal of households from some parts of Monthon Phayab. . . . Some of the people have gone over to the Burma side, others have only changed into another Quang. The reason is partly scarcity of rice or good land for cultivation, partly the taxes and the forced labour, making of roads, etc.”73 Chiang Mai suffered flooding in 1909, violent hailstorms that damaged homes and injured villagers in 1913 and 1914, and earthquakes that shook the region in 1912 and 1914. As if these tribulations were not enough, epidemics of malaria and smallpox also ravaged the region from 1912 to 1913, anthrax and rinderpest devastated villagers’ working animals in 1914 and 1915, and influenza swept through in 1918.74 The vector for these maladies was frequently identified as traffic coming from Bangkok by boat or train, which, as Bowie notes, “may describe a fact, or instead reveal anti-Bangkok sentiments.”75\n\nAs the social fabric that had held Lan Na together for centuries seemed to unravel, the region became fertile ground for millenarian social movements—and figures like Khruba Srivichai—that promised the return of cosmic order. The mythology of Khruba Srivichai in particular locates the monk in a lineage of Lan Na tonbun (which translates to “having merit” or, roughly, “saint”), and sees him as Maitreya, an incarnation of the future Buddha. Lan Na Buddhist legend privileged the magical future Buddha over the original Gautama Buddha, and predicted that Maitreya’s return would follow a series of disastrous events, which included “kings oppressing the populace, rampant unrestrained warfare, crop failure, natural disasters, famine and the unleashing of evil spirits.”76 Khruba Srivichai’s construction and renovation activities—restoring significant religious monuments as well as creating important new overland arteries for transportation and communication—represented a positive response to the devastating changes of the era. By 1920, Khruba Srivichai was, according to Sommai, “attracting huge crowds wherever he went, and rumors of his magical protective powers (waetmonkhathaa) mushroomed. People spread turmeric on his feet and saved the white cloth on which he had walked for worship and protection.”77 During his detention in Chiang Mai prior to being sent to Bangkok in 1920, “there were nearly a thousand and on hardly any day was [sic] there less than a hundred to see him.”78 When Khruba Srivichai returned to the north later that year, his journey was accompanied by throngs of thousands along the way, much as Dara Rasami’s 1909 visit was—except that Khruba Srivichai had neither the royal financial support nor official arrangements that had smoothed the way for Dara’s journey.\n\nIn today’s northern Thai politics, the memories of Khruba Srivichai and Phra Rachaya Chao Dara Rasami stake out opposite ends of the political spectrum. The persistence of Khruba Srivichai’s memory as a champion of the people has proved to be an important Lan Na touchstone for the campaigns of both Thaksin Shinawatra and his sister, Yingluck, who launched her successful 2011 bid for the office of prime minister at Khruba Srivichai’s shrine. The intentional alignment of such regional populists with the rebel monk’s memory makes sense, given the Red Shirt movement’s appeal to the people at the peripheries over the traditional bureaucratic politicians in the center of Bangkok.\n\nDara Rasami’s place in local memory, alternatively, sits at the more conservative, royalist end of the spectrum. Contemporary fans romanticize her fabled commitment to “duty over love,” and celebrate her alignment with cultural tropes of successful motherhood and matronage. The positive historical associations with her 1909 visit and the massive economic boost it brought to Chiang Mai compete with problematic activities like her relocation of Chiang Mai’s royal remains from the riverside to a new cemetery at Wat Suan Dok. That Dara achieved a queenly rank and maintained close relationships with Siamese royals in Bangkok continues to provide local elites—particularly the “na Chiang Mai” and other “city” families—with an insider figure that links them directly to the central Thai royal family. Dara’s internalization of the siwilai worldview and associated cultural practices form the foundation of local elites’ notions of their role in both creating and maintaining “ur-Lan Na” culture, tradition, and history—even though Dara’s is essentially a story of Lan Na’s submission to Siamese domination.\n\nYet, at the same time, Dara’s contributions to cultural preservation open avenues to proponents of Lan Na identity that resist the domination of central Thai identity in the region—particularly via local textile traditions. Wearing the phasin on Fridays has become accepted practice in Chiang Mai and its environs, and various Lan Na communities have found economic advantage in reviving the local weaving industry.79 Thus Dara Rasami’s legacy—and memory—remain ambiguous and open to appropriation at either end of the Thai political spectrum. By embodying an alternative—possibly elitist—approach to “Lan Na-ism” when compared to that of Khruba Srivichai, Dara Rasami serves simultaneously as an insider and outsider figure to both Chiang Mai’s local identity and Bangkok royalty. At the same time, her status reveals how the construction of Lan Na identity remains a focal point of local resistance to projects that attempt to impose hegemonic central Thai politics and identity.\n\nDara Rasami’s position as a “Siamized” member of the Bangkok elite—and her adoption of the Siamese siwilai worldview—alerted her to the value of Lan Na’s ethnic difference, and provided her the tools with which to actively preserve and promote it. The Siamese adaptation of Madame Butterfly, SaoKhrua Fa, serves as an exemplar of how Bangkok crypto-colonially exoticized Dara Rasami’s native culture; yet its wild popularity also demonstrated to Dara Rasami the potential value of self-orientalizing her Lan Na-ness as a means of preserving local culture and traditions in her home region. Her promotion of dance, music, and textile arts in particular reflects the keen awareness she gained from the popularity of SaoKhrua Fa as to which Lan Na cultural elements central-plains Thai considered unique. At the same time, Dara Rasami’s matronage of practices like medicine, agriculture, and historical research demonstrated her desire to preserve valuable aspects of Lan Na’s cultural difference in anticipation of future economic and social change. In addition to reflecting Dara Rasami’s enculturation to the siwilai worldview, it is also emblematic of the particularly modern form of matronage that she practiced."
