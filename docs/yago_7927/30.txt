Visitors are given an audio guide in English. The museum is open Monday to Saturday from 10am to 3pm, and advance booking is required. The entrance fee is Bt150 (Bt50 student). Dress code is proper black clothing for mourning. To book a visit, call (02) 252 1965-67 between 8.30am and 6.30pm. Find out more at www.QueenSavang.org.

Angkhang in the pink

Cherry blossoms are turning the valley pink at Angkhang Royal Project just in time for the holiday season. The trees have bloomed around the 80 Anniversary Park and English Rose Garden, where some other cold-climate flowers also add colour to the agriculture station. One of the late King’s agricultural research and development projects, Chiang Mai’s Angkhang is a much-loved winter destination.
