        "text": "Entrepreneur and Seasoned Film and Documentary Producer Natalie Boll is launching Tribela, a ground-breaking social media and e-commerce platform.\n\nWith the success of “Maker of Monsters: The Extraordinary Life of Beau Dick,”Natalie is currently filming two documentaries, “Code Shift” and “WasteWise.”\n\nEntrepreneur and seasoned film and documentary producer Natalie Boll is inspired by her personal experiences and the pervasive issues within current social media platforms to create Tribela, an innovative online platform dedicated to the safety and well-being of its users. Natalie is an award-winning producer from Vancouver, BC, who has been a dynamic force in the entertainment industry for over two decades. Her extensive experience managing large teams and significant budgets has prepared her for the challenge.\n\nSplitting her time between Germany and Canada, Natalie chose to prototype Tribela in Germany, working with the Heidelberg-based tech firm in partnership with Microsoft for Startups. She remarks, “Germany is at the forefront of technology and innovation, particularly in regulating technology with strong legislation and data privacy policies. Harnessing this advanced German technology to build a new platform at this scale could be very special.”\n\nNatalie has led the development of Tribela. Her journey includes comprehensive research and development phases, where she engaged in educational programs to deepen her expertise. These encompass Harvard Business School’s online courses in Launching Tech Ventures and Leading with Finance studies through the Center for Humane Technology in San Francisco on the Foundations of Human Technology and a course on the Well-being of Teens at Yale University. She further honed her leadership and management skills at Oxford University’s Saïd Business School Advanced Management and Leadership Programme. Additionally, she was invited to join The Break Fellowship, which supports female entrepreneurs in the EU, providing mentoring and support that helped accelerate Tribela’s development during a company development period in San Sebastian, Spain. This fall, Natalie will return to Oxford University to participate in their Innovation Incubator and further develop the foundations of Tribela.\n\nTribela’s platform design, influenced by extensive research, aims to disrupt the industry with a focus on ethical and transparent AI and algorithm development. Natalie’s daughter, who will attend Western University, played a crucial role in the research and design tailored to the Gen Z market. Natalie explains, “What we’re creating is truly extraordinary. With my daughter’s insight and research, we are entering the market with a deep understanding of what this generation needs. Safety is a given with our design, but the features must be genuinely useful.”\n\nNatalie’s entrepreneurial spirit extends beyond media; she has successfully owned and operated businesses in real estate and the restaurant industry. Her business acumen was recognized with Vancouver’s 40 under 40 award.\n\nNatalie is the co-owner of Athene Films, a Vancouver-based production company. Their recent work includes “Maker of Monsters: The Extraordinary Life of Beau Dick,” which continues to air on CBC Gem. Production is underway on “Code Shift” ” exploring the creation of Tribela where Natalie leads a pivotal movement to redefine social media, weaving together her battles and behind-the-scenes insights into the industry’s urgent need for change” by documenting her journey to build Tribela in a male-dominated tech industry and the future of ethical technology through a female lens.\n\nNatalie has also completed the pilot episode of WasteWise, which will be released on July 1. The first season will be filmed in Rome during the fall of 2024. This engaging and inspiring half-hour YouTube original series focuses on sustainable home organization. Hosted by Ottavia Belli, CEO of Sfusitalia and an Italian-based environmental educator and speaker, the series aims to inspire viewers to adopt a zero-waste lifestyle through manageable steps.\n\nJoin Us: To support Tribela and be part of the movement for safer social media, visit our crowdfunding campaign at https://chuffed.org/project/111154-tribela-building-a-safer-more-inclusive-social-media-platform and make a donation today.

Tyson Media is pleased to announce that principal photography is underway on “My Pet Ate What?” for Bell Media. The show is being filmed in the Greater Vancouver, the Fraser Valley, Vancouver Island and the Okanagan. Filming started in late March and continues until late July, with anticipated pickup shoots in August and September 2024. Production has shot in over 30 clinics so far this filming season, and it is estimated that they will film in more than 50 clinics across British Columbia by the time production is wrapped. Post-production began in late April and is projected to run until the series is fully delivered in January 2025.\n\nIntroduction\n\n“MY PET ATE WHAT?” is a new documentary series for Bell Media that follows the work of Dr. Eugene Gorodetsky, an expert in veterinary care who uses a minimally invasive instrument that combines a camera, light, and grasping tools to reach down animals’ digestive tracts and recover wild, surprising, and dangerous items they’ve ingested. The show ‘My Pet Ate What?!’ was created by Ben Gordetsky, Eugene’s son, who came to British Columbia to work with his father during this period. Ben also serves as the project executive producer.\n\nAbout Dr. Eugene Gorodetsky\n\nOne of the only veterinarians in the world known to focus exclusively on this field of endoscopy. Dr. G’s been practicing for more than 20 years. He provides a specialized procedure that prevents invasive, higher-risk surgery when successful. Dr. G is tirelessly motivated by extraordinary love for animals and dedication to their well-being. He’s extracted a 2-carat diamond ring, a hefty chunk of sofa cushion, four baby soothers and assorted brooches, among hundreds of other objects.\n\nThe show is unique because Dr. Gordetsky has no ‘home base’ and is a fully remote veterinarian, adding additional access challenges to the crew. Here’s a news article with more information on Dr. G’s practice: This B.C. travelling vet saves animals from swallowed objects.Impact and Awareness\n\n“MY PET ATE WHAT?” presents a unique and heartfelt opportunity for pet owners, veterinary staff, and other participants to make a difference in the lives of animals. Those who are a part of the project will help raise awareness about the benefits of Dr. G’s approach to pets’ health and well-being, as the show aims to highlight the importance of prompt veterinary care, which can mean life or death for a beloved animal. The production also hopes to spread the word about measures to help owners prevent their pets from ingesting foreign objects.Production Team\n\nIn partnership with Bell Media, “MY PET ATE WHAT?” is produced by Tyson Media Productions, the Vancouver-based production company behind the Canadian Original series Pets and Pickers. The third season of Pets and Pickers premieres on Sunday, July 14, at 8 p.m. ET on Animal Planet. Seasons 1 and 2 are available on Discovery and Crave.\n\nThe “MY PET ATE WHAT?” production crew has worked on Pets and Pickers and is very experienced with filming in a clinical veterinary setting. They are sensitive to client care needs and compassionate considerations and are also experts at taking an observational approach and remaining unobtrusive to veterinary practices and procedures.Executive Producer: Tyson Hepburn\n\nExecutive Producer / Creator: Ben Gorodetsky\n\nExecutive Producer / Production Executive: Kelly McClughan\n\nSeries Producer: Nicole Tomlinson\n\nSupervising Producer: Jeff Wonnenberg\n\nSeries Director: Andrew Vacheresse\n\nDirector of Photography: Jonny Schmidtgall\n\nSenior Story Producer: Cody Shaw\n\nSenior Story Editor: Kathy Johnson\n\nSenior Editors: Jenypher Fisher and Brent J.

When the Executive Director/CEO job was first floated, Eyal initially dismissed it. “I said ‘No way. I’m not working where my wife works. Forget it.’” But he was convinced by the cause – and after serious family discussions about keeping work and home separate, signed on. He set an ambitious goal of caring for every animal in need. He knew to do it, the organization had to think bigger – and expand its fundraising vision beyond what one RAPS director described as “pub nights and bake sales.” In the past five years, Eyal’s uncanny ability to see opportunities where others see risk has served RAPS well. When a storage company offered to donate the bins from abandoned storage lockers to charitable organizations so they could sell the goods for profit, other non-profits were leery, viewing it as a potential liability. Eyal saw the picking as a potential gold mine to help raise money for animal care. Another goal is to foster a culture where everyone feels like family, something newcomers to the organization and pet families often remark on. Under his leadership, RAPS has grown from treating 1200 animals yearly to 15,000. Its Cat Sanctuary houses and cares for wild and abandoned cats – with the goal of finding forever homes for as many as possible.\n\nFilming is complete for a documentary to showcase the artists and students in Wingspan Dis/Ability Arts, Culture & Public Pedagogy in three Canadian provinces.\n\nFor immediate release, Vancouver, BC.: Filmmaker and Award-winning NFB director Thomas Buchan of Entyre Films and Professor Dr. Leslie G. Roman, visionary for the Wingspan program, are pleased to announce that Entire Films has completed the filming of a documentary for Wingspan Dis/Ability Arts, Culture & Public Pedagogy, Canada’s first accessible and inclusive Disability and Deaf Artist Residency Program in Canada’s schools and UBC VPRI Excellence Cluster. In 2024, under the leadership of Dr. Leslie G. Roman, UBC Professor of Educational Studies, in collaboration with an interdisciplinary cluster of colleagues, asks: how can the aims of Canada’s Accessibility Act take center stage in the hearts and minds of students, teachers, and staff in partner K-12 schools? The documentary follows Wingspan artists and students in the schools of three Canadian provinces: British Columbia, Manitoba, and Ontario.\n\nFollowing the journey in the classrooms, Thomas Buchan is a Director and Director of Photography (DOP) for several feature documentaries, collaborating with the National Film Board (NFB), CBC, and the Knowledge Network. He is co-directing this film with Prof. Roman.\n\nFilming the program began in February with a retreat at Loon Lake Lodge in Maple Ridge, BC, to co-train the teachers, artists, and staff. Students in schools have had the opportunity to have sustained learning experiences with artists with disabilities or Deafness in residencies. They have also been treated to experiences of touring artists and taken on field trips to art galleries to exhibit their art or hear the performances of Wingspan artists or perform alongside them. The showcase of celebrations of learning features the work of the Wingspan artists but, most importantly, what the students have learned from the role model artists in their classrooms in each Wing province.\n\nWorking with students in British Columbia is classical, folk, and rock singer Jugpreet Bajwa Jugpreet, who has gained worldwide recognition for performing with his motto of “Seeing the world through music.” Jugpreet’s musical journey began at the tender age of five. It evolved into a lifelong passion despite facing the adversity of Eye Cancer, to which he lost both of his eyes. Canadian audiences will know Jugpreet from his celebrity status as a televised performer of our national anthem at the Vancouver Canuck and Whitecap games.\n\nIn Winnipeg, Wingspan students have had a rich learning opportunity to work first-hand with nationally and internationally regarded Dis/Deaf artists, from renowned jazz pianist and saxophonist Connor Derraugh to Métis artist Candace Lipischak, a multidisciplinary artist who hand-carves antler jewelry. They are joined by Wingspan touring artist Natalie Sluis, who turns her hearing loss into the language of contemporary performance dance.\n\nToronto artists include Felicia Byron, a Caribbean-Canadian multidisciplinary artist and photographer. As a Black Jamaican Canadian woman and neurodivergent artist living with cerebral palsy, Byron employs a cinematic approach to creating still imagery through light, colour, wardrobe, prop and set design elements to build worlds, weave stories and evoke feelings of familiarity. Danielle Hyde is a multi-disciplinary Tkaronto Treaty 13 Indigenous artist with lived experience of an invisible mental health disability. Her artwork spans many mediums, including new media, murals, painting, photography, and installations, all mixed with performance. In dialogue as four-dimensional beings of hearts, minds, bodies, and spirits, we co-create decolonial ecologies of community and accessibility.\n\nFilming has been completed in all three provinces. Once the documentary is edited, plans are to contact TV networks and documentary festivals.For more information, interviews, and photographs, please get in touch with publicist Lesley Diana | lesley@thepromotionpeople.ca | 604-726-5575\n\nCanadian Films “War Tails,” “Run for Noah” “Henderson,” “Suzy Makes Cupcakes,” and “And…Action” to screen at the Seattle Film Festival running from June 26 to June 30\n\nThe 9th annual Seattle Film Festival, under the direction of William Wayne and Michael Rey in their second year, has tripled its film screenings both online and theatrically, presenting over 450 unique films.

It highlights Seaquam Secondary and Elsie Roy Elementary students’ performances at Seaquam Secondary School in Delta, B.C., on May 31, 2024, at 3:00 p.m.\n\nThe Honorable Carla Qualtrough will be in attendance to provide welcoming words.\n\nWingspan: Dis/ability Arts, Culture and Public Pedagogy, is pleased to announce that the Wingspan Showcase is open to the public on May 31st, 2024, at Seaquam Secondary School in Delta at 3:00 p.m. Jugpreet Bajwa has been working with students at Seaquam Secondary in Delta and Elsie Roy Elementary in Vancouver for the past two months all to culminate in the Wingspan Showcase. An invitation is open to the media and public to experience the fantastic performances by the students. Manitoba Wingspan musician Connor Derraugh and guests join Jugpreet. The Honourable Carla Qualtrough, Minister of Sport and Physical Activity, who has strongly supported Wingspan since its inception, will attend to open the Showcase and offer welcoming words.\n\nJugpreet has gained recognition worldwide for performing with his motto of “Seeing the world through music.” Jugpreet’s musical journey began at the tender age of five. It evolved into a lifelong passion despite facing the adversity of Eye Cancer, to which he lost both of his eyes. Canadian audiences will know Jugpreet from his celebrity status as a televised performer of our national anthem at the Vancouver Canuck and Whitecap games. A graduate of Seaquam Secondary, he returns as a role model and a barrier-breaker at both schools. His life’s mission is spreading love and peace through music globally. “Jugpreet has been creating magic in the Wingspan classrooms, and we are thrilled to share the enthusiasm from his students in the performances at the Wingspan Showcase,” says Dr. Leslie Roman, Wingspan visionary.\n\nJugpreet is joined by Manitoba musician and Wingspan artist Connor Derrough at the Wingspan Showcase. Music has always been central to Connor’s life. At 15, he suffered a traumatic brain hemorrhage during routine surgery. Connor has performed at the Winnipeg Jazz Festivals and the Asper Jazz Series and is a regular performer with the Winnipeg Jazz Orchestra.\n\nWingspan Dis/Ability Arts, Culture & Public Pedagogy is Canada’s first accessible and inclusive Disability and Deaf Artist Residency Program in Canada’s schools and is a UBC VPRI Excellence Cluster. In 2024, under the leadership of Dr. Leslie G. Roman, UBC Professor of Educational Studies and visionary for the Wingspan program, in collaboration with an interdisciplinary cluster of colleagues, asks: how can the aims of Canada’s Accessibility Act take center stage in the hearts and minds of students, teachers, and staff in partner K-12 schools? Like starlings in a murmuration, Wingspan has flown into schools in three Wing Provinces: British Columbia, Manitoba, and Ontario. Wingspan, this year, has gone national.\n\n“Creating inclusion begins with educating students, teachers, and educational leaders that disabilities or Deafness are not something to fear or feel shame about. The more we learn, the more we appreciate what artists with disabilities and Deafness bring to the table of our schools (K-12) and our entire educational system”, says Prof. Roman, a leading scholar of disability studies and sociology of education. Artists have been placed in K-12 schools or as touring artists who perform in art galleries, museums, or community centers.\n\nWe encourage the media and the public to attend this unique showcase to share the incredible performances the Wingspan artists and students have created in the classroom.\n\nThe Wingspan Showcase is free to the public – May 31st at 3:00 – 6:00 p.m. at Seaquam Secondary School 11584 Lyon Road, Delta, BC, V4E 2K4 604-591-6166\n\nhttps://se.deltasd.bc.ca/our-school/contact-directions\n\nWingspan artists, teachers, cluster leaders, and educational leaders for both districts are available for interviews, photos, and more information upon request.\n\nFor more information, photos, and interviews, please contact:\n\nLesley Diana | Wingspan Publicist | lesley@thepromotionpeople.ca 604-726-5575\n\nWingspan Dis/Ability Arts, Culture & Public Pedagogy: https://wingspan.educ.ubc.ca/.\n\nJugpreet Bajwa – https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jugpreet_Singh_Bajwa\n\nSeaquam Secondary School – https://se.deltasd.bc.ca/\n\nElsie Roy Elementary School – https://www.vsb.bc.ca/elsie-roy\n\nActor Donald Heng’s upcoming supporting lead role in Sight, starring Terry Chen, Greg Kinnear and Ben Wang, opens in 2100 theatres worldwide on May 24th, 2024.\n\nThe movie is a true story based on Dr. Ming Wang, a world-renowned eye specialist whose technology has restored sight to millions of people.\n\nActor Donald Heng is thrilled to join the stellar cast of the feature film Sight, which opens in theatres worldwide on Memorial Day Weekend, May 24th. Sight, starring Oscar-nominated and Emmy-winning actor Greg Kinnear (Little Miss Sunshine, As Good As It Gets) and Terry Chen (Almost Famous, Falling) is based on the true story of Dr. Ming Wang, a poor Chinese American who defies all odds to become a world-renowned eye surgeon in the United States. Set in 1970s rural China, a teenage Ming is played by Ben Wang (Disney + American Born Chinese) as he faces persecution and despair at every turn. Still, with his dedicated family’s support and unwavering determination, he finds his way to America, attends Harvard and MIT, and helps develop an innovative technology that restores sight in millions of people. Taking on the seemingly impossible challenge of helping a blind orphan, the resilient Dr. Wang must reconcile with his traumatic past and face the harsh reality that the strength of his own will can only go so far.\n\nDonald portrays the role of Zhensheng, Dr Ming Wang’s (Terry Chen’s character) young father, in all the flashback scenes. He worked alongside Ben Wang (who has just been cast as the new upcoming Karate Kid opposite Jackie Chan) and Jayden Zhang (Shang Chi), who portrays an even younger version of Dr. Ming Wang.\n\nDonald has already had a busy year in 2024. Earlier this year, Donald guest starred in 3 different network shows: CBS’ Tracker, The CW’s Family Law, and ABC’s The Good Doctor. In the 2nd episode of 2024’s biggest network show, Tracker, entitled Missoula, Donald portrays Jackson Cheong opposite Justin Hartley (This is Us, Smallville) as an accountant who has recently cut ties with his family and joins a cult. Jackson’s parents hire Colton Shaw (Justin Hartley) and successfully track him down, discovering that Jackson may or may not be there of his own free will.\n\nIn the season premiere of the final season of The Good Doctor, Donald plays Owen Pierce, a father whose son urgently needs a heart transplant. In season 3 of Family Law, Donald was cast as Theo Leung, a man who becomes entangled in an inheritance dispute with his sister soon after their father passes away.\n\nMost recently, Donald also appeared in a supporting role opposite Emmy-award-winning actor Peter Dinklage (Game of Thrones) as Dr. Berton in the indie black comedy American Dreamer, which premiered at the Tribeca Film Festival. The film also stars Academy Award winner Shirley MacLaine, Academy-Award-nominated actor Matt Dillon, and Danny Glover. Furthermore, he recently wrapped filming in an undisclosed role in the highly anticipated upcoming sci-fi blockbuster film Tron: Ares (Jared Leto, Greta Lee).\n\nIn 2022-2023, Donald had a 7-episode recurring Guest Star role as Anthony Chan in The CW’s Kung Fu. Anthony is introduced as the district supervisor of Chinatown, running for re-election. He is a family friend of Tzi Ma’s (Rush Hour, Arrival) character “Jin.” They are initially allies fighting for the exact cause until Jin discovers Anthony is being blackmailed, pitting them into a campaign against one another in the upcoming election.\n\nAlso, in 2023, Donald was cast as one of the leads in Hallmark Channel’s movie Retreat to You. In it, Donald plays a chef at a resort who falls in love with MeganHeffern’s (Wynona Earp) character.\n\nThroughout his career, Donald has had a leading role in an episode of the CW’s Two Sentence Horror Stories and other guest star spots, including roles on the CW’s The Flash, CBS’ Ransom, and CityTV’s The Murders. He also has a recurring role as George on one of Netflix’s most popular shows, Virgin River.\n\nOn the big screen, Donald has appeared in a supporting role alongside Milo Ventimiglia (This is Us, Gilmore Girls) in Fox Studio’s The Art of Racing in the Rain.

The play stars Ben Immanuel (Wonder, The Man in the High Castle, Sisters and Brothers) as John D’Agata (the writer), Loretta Walsh (When Calls the Heart, Creepshow, Batwoman) as Emily Penrose (the Editor in Chief), and Tal Shulman (So Help Me Todd, Holiday Road) as Jim Fingal (the Fact Checker). Directed by Jennifer Clement (Director credits: Dinner with Friends, Italian American Reconciliation, Actor credits: Supernatural, Psych, Eureka) and the Set Design by Interior Designer Peter Wilds. “The Lifespan of a Fact” is written by Jeremy Karaken & David Murrell, and Gordon Farrell based on the book by John D’Agata and Jim Fingal.\n\nThe story follows Jim Fingal (Shulman), a fresh out of Harvard fact checker for a prominent but sinking New York magazine. John D’Agata (Immanuel) is a talented writer with a transcendent essay about a high-stakes event concerning a teenage boy – an essay that could save the magazine from collapse. When Jim is assigned to fact-check D’Agata’s article, the two come head-to-head in a comedic yet gripping battle over facts versus fiction.\n\nThe play is based on real-life D’Agata’s piece “What Happens There,” an essay written about the teenager Levi Presley. In real life, Jim Fingal was assigned to fact-check the piece and ignited a seven-year debate on the blurred lines of what passes for truth in literary nonfiction. Having had success globally (the play made its world premiere on Broadway in 2018 starring Daniel Radcliffe, Bobby Cannavale, and Cherry Jones), it is currently being highly produced worldwide. “The Lifespan of a Fact” is not only a story brimming with comedic banter and debate about “truth,” it also offers themes of the story being a conduit to connect us in our humanity and trust in journalism and the media.\n\nWith the branding of terms such as “fake news” and the recent elimination and banning of news being allowed to be shared on Meta-owned social media platforms (Facebook and Instagram), the public is more and more challenged with the ideas of “what is a fact?” “Is what I am reading legitimate?”\n\nThe book on which the play is based, The Lifespan of a Fact, received critical attention from national media, including NPR, The New York Times, and The Los Angeles Times. It was subsequently named a “Top 10 Most Crucial Book” by the editors of Slate, a “Best Book of the Year” by The Huffington Post, and an Editor’s Choice by The New York Times Book Review.\n\nKey artistic contributors to the project are veteran actor/director Jennifer Clement, award-winning and nominated actors Ben Immanuel and Loretta Walsh, and set designer Peter Wilds. This team has worked together in the past, in 2012 critically acclaimed and sold-out production of “Dinner with Friends” at the Nest on Granville Island.\n\nThe Cast:\n\nBen Immanuel (playing John D’Agata, the writer)\n\nBen Immanuel is a multiple-award-winning actor, writer, director, and producer.
