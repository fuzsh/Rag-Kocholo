This show is generously sponsored by David Short and Beverley Luckey-Short.\n\n“Acoustic Guitarist of the Year” and celebrated singer/songwriter Christie Lenée is more than a musician – she’s an experience. Symphonic compositions flow from her fingertips effortlessly, with sound ranging from transcendental folk-pop to virtuosic instrumentals.\n\nChristie has been described as “Dave Matthews meets Joni Mitchell and Michael Hedges,” integrating melodic pop lyricism with catchy hooks and percussive, harmonic textures. Since achieving 1st place at the International Fingerstyle Guitar Championship in 2017, her captivating performances have been seen on stages with Tommy Emmanuel, Tim Reynolds (Dave Matthews Band), Andy McKee, Amy Ray (Indigo Girls), Melissa Etheridge, Antigone Rising, Kaki King, Jake Shimabukuro and Christopher Cross to name a few.\n\nFeatured on the Grammy Museum’s virtual program streaming from Los Angeles, a 2x Finalist in the USA Songwriting Competition, plus a variety of articles in Guitar Player Magazine, Acoustic Guitar Magazine, and the recent notability of “Best Acoustic Guitarists in the World Right Now” (Guitar World Magazine), Christie continues to awe crowds with the unique essence of her music.\n\nLenee’s newly released album Coming Alive reminds devout listeners of her spiritual and sublime songwriting, inspirational lyrics, and of course, sensational guitar playing. The first line of the intro title track (“I’ve got a feeling deep inside”), tells you everything you need to know: Lenée’s sixth album is a chronicle of joy and hope, of self-confidence and empowerment, of renewal and light.\n\nComing Alive features iconic guitar hooks and powerhouse vocal performances. She collaborated with a bevy of talented musicians on the album, including co-producer Matthew Odmark (Jars of Clay), drummer Keith Carlock (Steely Dan, Toto, Sting, John Mayer), bassist Adam Nitti (Kenny Loggins, Carrie Underwood, Susan Tedeschi), and keyboardist Charlie Lowell (Jars of Clay). It was a dream lineup put together to create Lenée’s quintessential statement piece.\n\nChristie was recently featured in Go Magazine, Americana Highways, Bluegrass Situation, Country Queer and Acoustic Guitar Magazine. With a new album in hand, she’s Coming Alive – right on time.\n\nAbout Ryan David Green\n\nRyan David Green's music has been called \"virtuosic acoustic guitar that is remarkably accessible\", with fast fingerwork that is always in service of unmistakeable melodies. Performing a blend of instrumental guitar pieces and delicate vocal tunes, Green takes audiences to a place both otherworldly, and somehow surprisingly intimate.\n\nA graduate of Boston's prestigious Berklee College of Music, Ryan David Green has performed on four continents, been profiled in Acoustic Guitar Magazine, and twice been named \"Best Guitarist\" in the Tucson Music Awards (where he currently resides). His original compositions have received numerous film and TV placements, including shows on E!, Lifetime, and ABC Family/Freeform.\n\nHis acoustic-duo Ryanhood (with musical partner Cameron Hood) has performed with a wide-range of artists including Jason Mraz, Matt Nathanson, and Train, and were named the \"Best Group/Duo\" in the International Acoustic Music Awards.\n\nHis debut solo-guitar album Off and Running was released on June 14, 2024.\n\nNAACP Freedom Fund Banquet\n\nOur Culture, Our CommUNITY: \"We Are Bold, Impactful, and Revered.\"\n\nPresented by NAACP Bremerton Unit 1134 and the Admiral Theatre Foundation\n\nSaturday, September 14, 2024\n\nReception 5 PM | Program 6 PM\n\nTickets $85 (incl. dinner and fees) - Dinner options below\n\nNAACP Bremerton Unit 1134 and the Admiral Theatre Foundation proudly present the 2024 NAACP Freedom Fund Banquet / Our Culture, Our Community: \"We Are Bold, Impactful, and Revered.\" This year's festivities include remarks by Craig Sims, Attorney at Law and Former King County Deputy Prosecutor, and Dr. Chauné Fitzgerald, founder Washington State Tri-Cities Black Chamber of Commerce, and live performances by Ms. Ruth Jones, and the Eugenie Jones Band.

We are honored to introduce Retired US Army Staff Sergeant Travis Mills, a recalibrated warrior, motivational speaker, actor, author, and advocate for veterans and amputees.\n\nTravis now travels nationwide, sharing his story and inspiring everyone to overcome life’s challenges and adversity. Join us to hear his powerful message and celebrate the resilience and strength of those with disabilities.\n\nMeet Travis Mills / Founder, Travis Mills Foundation\n\nBorn and raised in Vassar, Michigan, United States Army Staff Sergeant (Ret.) Travis Mills of the 82nd Airborne is a recalibrated veteran, motivational speaker, actor, author and an advocate for veterans and amputees. In addition to being the founder of the Travis Mills Foundation, Travis also serves as the President of the Board of Directors.\n\nTravis has achieved his vision for the Foundation by bringing together a talented array of experts who masterfully accomplish the Foundation’s mission. Per Travis’s lead, the team at the Foundation are not only respected colleagues, they are family.\n\nTravis' Story\n\nOn April 10, 2012, Travis was critically injured by an improvised explosive device (IED) during a routine patrol on his third tour of duty in Afghanistan. The explosion blew off portions of all four of his limbs and he is one of only five quadruple amputees from the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan to survive.\n\nWhile recovering at Walter Reed National Military Medical Center, family was a crucial component to Travis’s healing. His wife, Kelsey, their daughter, Chloe, along with both their families, spent 19 months at Walter Reed, recovering alongside other veterans and their families.\n\nTravis maintained his lifelong mantra of: “Never Give Up. Never Quit,” and credits Kelsey and Chloe (then 6 months old) as the driving force behind his positivity and persistence to overcome the challenges of his new normal.\n\nAfter his recovery, Travis attended an adaptive sports camp in Colorado and realized the need for a such a place where a veteran and their entire family could relax, reconnect and find strength. Born out of this idea, Travis and Kelsey founded the Travis Mills Foundation Veterans Retreat.\n\nThe Mills Family lives near the retreat and in 2017, welcomed their second child, Dax, who is named after the two medics who saved Travis’s life – Daniel and Alexander.\n\nTravis continues to have an outstandingly positive outlook on life and works to offer more adaptive opportunities for recalibrated veterans and their families.\n\nTravis’s New York Times bestselling memoir, “Tough as They Come,” is available online and in bookstores and he’s working on his second book.\n\nIn September 2013, Travis and his wife Kelsey founded the Travis Mills Foundation, a nonprofit organization, formed to benefit and assist post-911 veterans who have been injured in active duty or as a result of their service to our nation. The veteran and their families receive an all-inclusive, all-expenses-paid, barrier-free experience in Maine where they participate in adaptive activities, bond with other veteran families, and enjoy much-needed rest and relaxation in Maine’s great outdoors.\n\nWhat is a recalibrated veteran?\n\nSSG Travis Mills coined the term “recalibrated veteran” after he lost portions of all of his limbs in an IED explosion while serving our country in Afghanistan. He was injured and healed; he didn’t want to be called a “wounded warrior” – his wounds had healed. Instead, he referred to himself as recalibrated. He adjusted to his new normal; he recalibrated.\n\nAbout Skookum\n\nCreating opportunities for people with disabilities\n\nFounded in 1988 out of a desire to do good in our community, Skookum has carried forward our social mission \"creating opportunities for people with disabilities\" in all that we aspire to be.

Bars for 21+.\n\nSparking his career at the age of 12, Nick Carter quickly became an international pop superstar as the youngest member of the iconic boy band, Backstreet Boys. With his boyish good looks and heartthrob status, Carter's 30-year entertainment journey has extended far beyond sold-out arenas, encompassing a diverse range of projects in television, film, philanthropy, and publishing.\n\nThe Backstreet Boys hold the distinction of being the best-selling boy band in history and rank among the world's top-selling music artists of all time. The group solidified one of the largest record deals ever, signing a $60 million deal with Jive Records in 1999. Since taking the world by storm in 1995, the band has sold over 130 million records worldwide and has earned five Grammy nominations and countless Billboard Awards, MTV Video Music Awards, American Music Awards, RIAA Awards, People’s Choice Awards, and an honorary star on the iconic Hollywood Walk of Fame. To date, the Backstreet Boys have toured around the globe several times over, released ten studio albums and have broken several records, including the U.S. record for most albums sold in one year, selling over 11 million copies of their third studio album, Millennium, in 1999.\n\nIn 2002, Carter ventured into a solo career with his debut album, Now or Never, released under Jive Records. It debuted impressively at #17 on the Billboard 200 chart and received Gold certification in the United States, Japan, and Canada. This marked the beginning of a successful solo journey, complementing his fame as a member of the Backstreet Boys. Since then, Carter has released two additional solo albums I’m Taking Off in 2012 followed by All American in 2016. Notably, his 2023 single \"Hurts to Love You\" became his most successful track, charting in seven different countries, topping the charts in the United States and charting number one in Canada.\n\nIn 2004, Carter made his foray into the world of film and television, starring in the remake of the classic horror film \"Sleepy Hollow\" called \"The Hollow.\" Carter further showcased his acting skills through various film appearances on TV shows such as the CW Network's revived series \"90210.\" In 2014, Carter and his now wife, Lauren Kitt, made their reality TV debut as a couple on the VH1 series \"I Heart Nick Carter.\" Furthermore, he participated in season four of Fox's hit show, \"The Masked Singer,\" as well as the 21st season of ABC's \"Dancing with the Stars\" making it to the finals on both series.\n\nDuring his time on “Dancing with the Stars,” Nick and Lauren announced that they were expecting their first child together. On April 19, 2016, they joyfully welcomed their son, Odin. The family expanded further with the arrival of their daughter Saoirse on October 2, 2019, and their youngest daughter, Pearl, on April 21, 2021.\n\nIn 2023, Carter wrapped another massive tour with the Backstreet Boys, “The DNA World Tour”, before embarking on his first solo tour in seven years, the international “Who I Am” tour, which kicked off in the U.S. in October and followed the release of three new solo singles, “Superman,” “Made For Us,” and “Never Break My Heart (Not Again).” The “Who I Am” tour will continue through 2024, reaching territories in South America, Asia, Canada, and the United States. Carter will join the Backstreet Boys for the band’s “Backstreet’s Back at the Beach Cancun” concert series in April 2024.\n\nThis show is exclusively sponsored by Joanne Haselwood.\n\n**Venue presale begins Thursday, March 28, 2024 at 10 AM PT and ends Friday, March 29, 2024 at 11:59 PM PT.

No dinner service at this show. Concessions and the bars will be open. All Ages. Bars for 21+.\n\nBremerton's Admiral Theatre is proud to present As We Speak: Béla Fleck, Zakir Hussain, Edgar Meyer featuring Rakesh Chaurasia - all masters of their craft with an astonishing 30 GRAMMY Awards between them.\n\nBéla Fleck, Zakir Hussain, and Edgar Meyer are virtuoso musicians and collaborators from three entirely different musical realms — bluegrass for Fleck, Indian classical music for Hussain, and Western classical music for Meyer. Sharing a gift for improvisation, they reach across musical genres as casually as neighbors might chat over a backyard fence.\n\nTheir latest collaboration, As We Speak showcases the group’s breathtaking versatility as instrumentalists — gliding easily between the cerebral complexity of Indian rhythm, the gut-level groove of a funky bass line, and the rigors of raga. Rakesh Chaurasia, a young master of the bansuri, an Indian bamboo flute, joins the group, adding to the magic.\n\n*********\n\nThe first-time banjo legend Béla Fleck, tabla master Zakir Hussain, and double bass virtuoso Edgar Meyer got together to make an album, it was to write, not to play.\n\nWhen Fleck and Meyer were looking for a third partner for a triple concerto, they had been commissioned to write to mark the opening of Nashville’s Schermerhorn Symphony Center, they thought of Hussain, who was quite interested in orchestral writing. “We thought we could learn a whole lot from this guy!” says Béla. The result was The Melody of Rhythm (2009), recorded with the Detroit Symphony Orchestra under Leonard Slatkin.\n\nIt wasn’t until the three began touring to promote the album that the trio’s true potential became apparent. Although each had a base in a different musical realm — bluegrass for Fleck, Indian classical music for Hussain, and Western classical music for Meyer — they shared a gift for improvisation as well as an ability to reach across musical genres as casually as neighbors might chat over a backyard fence.” When we are performing on stage, in composing mode or creating mode, we are basically having a conversation,” says Hussain. “So, the music emerges as we speak.”\n\nHence As We Speak, an album that not only showcases the group’s breathtaking abilities as instrumentalists but underscores the wide range of musical influences at their command. Across a dozen tracks, the group glides easily between the cerebral complexity of Indian rhythm and the gut-level groove of a funky bass line, sounding equally at home with the rigors of raga.\n\nAdding to that magic is Rakesh Chaurasia, who plays bansuri, an Indian bamboo flute. When the trio was touring India, Hussain — who knew Rakesh through his uncle, Indian flute legend Pandit Hariprasad Chaurasia — invited the younger flautist to sit in, and the chemistry was immediately apparent. “I think we wanted to see if we could do something a little more organic with just a small group,” says Meyer. “And to have somebody who plays as beautifully as Rakesh join us really opened it up to a more lyrical and melodic situation.”\n\n“What I think is good about this quartet is that everybody has to stretch in the direction of the other people,” adds Fleck. “To me, a collaboration where nobody changes is not a collaboration. It’s a mashup. And there’s nothing wrong with that. But I like a collaboration where I have to learn a bunch of new things from the other people. And in this case, I’m learning like crazy.”\n\nBéla Fleck\n\nFew musicians in any category seem as uncategorizable as Béla Fleck. After initially making his mark with the progressive bluegrass group New Grass Revival, Fleck proceeded to take his instrument, as New York Times critic Jon Pareles noted, “to some very unlikely places.” He formed the Flecktones, a groundbreaking group whose repertoire ranged from fusion to Bach; the group celebrates its 46th anniversary this year. In addition, he has played jazz with Chick Corea, American roots with his partner, banjoist Abigail Washburn, written concertos for banjo and orchestra, and created a documentary film and album, Throw Down Your Heart, that examined the banjo’s African roots. Along the way, he has won 16 Grammys across 10 categories.\n\nZakir Hussain\n\nThe pre-eminent classical tabla virtuoso of our time, Zakir Hussain is appreciated as one of the world’s most esteemed and influential musicians, one whose mastery of his percussion instrument has taken it to a new level, transcending cultures and national borders. A child prodigy, accompanying India’s greatest musicians and dancers from his early years, and touring internationally while still in his teens, Zakir has been at the helm of many genre-defying collaborations including Shakti, Remember Shakti, Masters of Percussion, Diga, Tabla Beat Science, CrossCurrents, Sangam and Grammy-award winners Planet Drum and Global Drum Project. A revered composer and educator, Zakir is the recipient of countless honors, most recently the 2022 Kyoto Prize in Arts and Philosophy, the 2022 Aga Khan Music Award for Lifetime Achievement, and in January 2023, the title of Padma Vibhushan, India’s second highest civilian award.\n\nEdgar Meyer\n\nAptly described by The New Yorker as “the most remarkable virtuoso in the relatively un-chronicled history of his instrument,” double bassist and composer Edgar Meyer is at home in a broad spectrum of musical styles. A MacArthur Fellow and Avery Fisher Prize winner, he is eminently at home within classical music, both performing traditional works and also his significant catalog of original solo, chamber, and orchestral pieces. His 30-year relationship with Yo-Yo Ma has yielded seven recordings together, and his upcoming projects include a duo recording with jazz bassist Christian McBride and a recording of all four of his concertos with the Knights and the Scottish Ensemble, produced by Chis Thile.\n\nRakesh Chaurasia\n\nLike Zakir Hussain, Rakesh Chaurasia comes from Indian classical music royalty. His uncle, Pandit Hariprasad Chaursia, is widely considered the greatest bansuri player in India, and Rakesh — who started playing at age five — is deemed his most brilliant student. Not only has he mastered the techniques of Indian classical music, he has developed additional techniques allowing him to venture into other styles of playing, particularly with his crossover band Rakesh and Friends. A composer as well as flautist, he has written and performed on numerous Indian movie soundtracks, and in 2007 was awarded the Indian Music Academy Award.\n\nThis show is generously sponsored by Annie Murphy & Brian Curtis, and Patricia McKenzie & Leonard Costello!\n\n**This is a free public event presented by Bremerton’s Admiral Theatre Foundation and Inspire Washington.

We’ll announce a date as soon as it’s confirmed. We’re excited to welcome Comedian John Caponera on June 1 @ 8 PM.\n\nComedian John Caponera\n\nSaturday, June 1, 2024\n\nDoors 6:30 p.m. | Show 8 p.m.\n\nMain Floor Seating Only $25\n\nThis show is included in our 2023-2024 Comedy Series sponsored by Mark & Sue Rufener. No dinner service at this show. Concessions and the bars will be open. All Ages. Bars for 21+.\n\nJohn Caponera always knew he wanted to be in show business but in what dimension was undetermined until the summer of 1979 when John entered a talent show at a local bar in Chicago. After doing several impressions, he walked away with the five hundred dollar winner's pot and a realization that he might have something to offer in the world of comedy.\n\nCaponera's instincts proved right and after two years working the Chicago comedy club circuit, John took his act on the road where he was immediately accepted . He has honed his act over a forty year career performing to audiences all over the world. Caponera is considered a comic's comic, a true professional offering a mix of material from topical to impressions to characterizations to stories and one liners.\n\nMichael Paskevich of the Las Vegas Review-Journal writes:\"Unafraid of letting a room grow quiet, Caponera sets his own intentionally erratic pace, pausing to perfection to complement his oddly timed but rewarding comic insights. The jokes are further bolstered by his talent for facial gestures that range from goofy to arrognat, making Caponera arguably the hottest club headliner going at present.\"\n\nHowell J. Malham Jr. of the Chicago Tribune writes: \"Every so often, the kingdom of comedy is graced with a gifted, naturally refined performer who can effectively demonstrate the transcendental powers of the medium while making it look deceptively easy.\"\n\nYou may recognize John as the star of his own sitcom called \"The Good Life\" or as the host of Comedy Central's sport show \"Jocks\" and ESPN's \"Talk II\". Other credits include guest star appearances on \"ER\", \"Love & War\", \"Blossom\", \"Tales From The Crypt\", \"The Tonight Show\", \"The Dennis Miller Show\", \"L.A.
