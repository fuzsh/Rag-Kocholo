        "text": "When Mrs. Green entered private investigator Howard Lotor's office, the latter had no idea that what started out as a case to catch an infidel husband would literally change his life.\n\nThe investigation even started out as usual, having Howard stroll around anthropomorphic Vancouver's Granville high street as he tried to get into the posh jazz club, The Bite, where Mr. Green was supposed to be. The process wasn't all that straightforward though. Howard had to get past the hulking bouncer by first \"befriending\" a street punk; only to get kicked out moments later by Ms. Clarissa Bloodworth, The Bite's owner.\n\nSo our PI had to resort to more unconventional ways of getting back in so as to pursue his investigation. This led him to discover Ms. Bloodworth's own unconventional and troubling practices happening behind the scenes of The Bite. Howard's sinister discovery spirals this seemingly simple case of a cheating husband into the biggest and most dangerous case of his career leading him to make new friends, influential enemies and uncover a surprising sci-fi twist behind it all.\n\nThis twist to the detective noir genre was really what made Backbone’s plot stand out for me. Integrating a sci-fi aspect is not a very common approach in such types of games but Backbone executes it well enough to keep the intrigue going. And there are more than one twist to Backbone that will keep you hooked on the game to uncover the truth as Howard Lotor.\n\nUnfortunately, Backbone's plot progression isn’t executed in a fully satisfying fashion; as by the end, there are still many questions left unanswered and some story beats left under-explored. You see, despite the anthropomorphic depiction of its characters, Backbone is essentially a story about identity in a hierarchical, dystopian society that draws obvious parallels to our own society. But the identity of that intriguing sci-fi twist and what comes after isn't given proper closure. It's not that the developers are leaving more for a sequel (which they might be thinking about) but even the arcs of protagonist and the main antagonist of the game feel rushed towards the end.\n\nThis feeling is accentuated not only in character development and plot progression but also across gameplay sequences, especially in the latter half of the game; indicating some pacing and execution issues with the plot. For instance, while investigating a room, I was suddenly caught sneaking by some kids who seemingly appeared out of nowhere. When I first traveled to another part of the city, West End, I was thrown a bunch of names that were supposed to make sense. Later, I found that those were the people that Howard had to investigate but their names didn’t pop up until I went to West End for the first time. Towards the very end of Backbone, the game let me do something I couldn’t do throughout its duration up to that point: control other characters. It’s not a bad thing in itself but there’s no proper flow to it; and just like the previous instances, it indicates some execution issues.\n\nWhat’s better executed though is Backbone’s atmosphere. While somewhat lacking in an abundance of jazz tunes for a detective noir game, Backbone’s highly detailed environments turn practically every scene as one to behold. Even with the retro aesthetics, the surroundings are chock-full of details inch to inch that make for vibrant, lively scenes.\n\nIn Howard’s office, you can see leaves rustling in the wind across the window while Mrs. Green reveals her husband’s suspicious behavior. In Granville, you can see people and cars passing by while rain drops occasionally smudge the screen as you try to find a way into The Bite. In Gastown, you can visit shops with pixelated, yet detailed wares on display and take a breather by a lake while pigeons peck on food remains.\n\nIn short, if you’re a fan of pixel art, Backbone won’t disappoint when it comes to the visuals. Much attention to detail was paid in crafting this anthropomorphic universe and it shows.\n\nAs for the gameplay, it’s a mix of point-and-click and platforming while combining stealth and puzzle elements. Yes, stealth in a detective noir game isn’t that common but it does fit well in the genre. In Backbone, this involves crouching and staying in shadows to avoid getting caught. It’s a simple but effective mechanic that helps diversify the gameplay.\n\nBut even with such a welcome addition, Backbone’s gameplay feels a bit too simple and linear. It’s equal parts walking to the designated location, reading through texts and clicking where needs to be clicked. While these actions flow fluidly, there are no real challenges to any of them, even to the handful of puzzles that the game throws at you.\n\nOn the plus side though, even with its linearity, Backbone does encourage exploring the environment you're in. I actually quite enjoyed reading tidbits scattered around the environment and talking to the NPCs. In doing so, you can even discover some minor “side quests” like becoming a matchmaker for two pensioners or petting the duck (!). This helped flesh the universe and the characters out, making them more relatable.\n\nAlso breathing some life to the game are the conversations. During these, you are given a number of choices to select as your reply. Through these, you can learn more about a situation or character or just keep it to a minimum. There are different types of replies to choose from ranging from empathic to cold, but your choices don't bear much weight in how the story progresses.\n\nThat said, Backbone isn’t a particularly long game either; clocking at around 4-5 hours, so the gameplay doesn’t feel too simplistic to be a bore. And really, a detective noir game stands out by its plot and characters. Even if Backbone faces some pacing and execution issues, it has an intriguing plot going for it and a relatable cast. It's just a shame that some of its most intriguing story beats and characters aren’t fleshed out or wrapped up in a satisfactory way.\n\nTo compare it with another anthropomorphic game of the same genre that was executed more successfully, you can turn to Chicken Police. In fact, after having played the latter, I was looking forward to playing Backbone on release. But while they are two different games with two different gameplay, they are of the same genre and explore some similar themes; and my experience with Backbone wasn’t as satisfying as what Chicken Police delivered.\n\nBackbone certainly looks good but the execution issues it faces aren’t negligible. However, it will deliver an intriguing, original story that packs its fair share of surprising twists. Maybe by trying to cram that many twists and story beats towards the second half is what bogged down the experience and led to a less than optimal execution. But if this is the first entry to the Backbone universe as the developers hinted in a recent tweet, then I certainly look forward to the next installment and hope it will tie up the looser ends of this title.\n\nYou can pet the duck!\n\nBackbone Launch Trailer"
