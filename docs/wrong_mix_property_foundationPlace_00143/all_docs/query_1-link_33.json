With affordable new technology and equipment, however, the cost and integration to live production systems are similar to those of a traditional broadcast camera.\n\nRecently, multiple “cine” cameras have been incorporated into the Super Bowl telecast, concerts, awards shows, and Fortune 500 corporate projects, either supplanting or adding to the use of traditional 2/3” broadcast cameras and lenses. On the sports side, national and regional leagues and teams are using cine cameras to enhance their storytelling capabilities.\n\nJoin industry leaders to explore this new workflow, discuss challenges and opportunities, and walk through case studies and use cases.\n\n1:00 pm – 1:15 pm\n\nWelcome Remarks and Set Up\n\nCraig German, HPA\n\nCraig German\n\nHPA\n\nMark Chiolis, Mobile TV Group\n\nMark Chiolis\n\nMobile TV Group\n\nMark Chiolis is the Director of Business Development for Mobile TV Group (MTVG), which provides facilities for over 4,000 live professional and college sports and entertainment events annually, with more than 35 mobile units, and dozens of remote Cloud Control facilities, based throughout the U.S. MTVG has been leading the 4K/UHD/HDR/Cloud live event production with key broadcasters, networks and distribution companies.\n\nMark is currently working to interface with customers and partners to develop and support MTVG’s entertainment, awards, corporate, concerts, egames, and esports events with current and new trucks, using both broadcast and cine workflows.\n\nPrior to MTVG, Chiolis worked in marketing, business development, and sales for Grass Valley, Thomson, Technicolor, Philips, and BTS as well as at television stations KMUV, KRBK and KVIE.\n\nChiolis is an active board member of the HPA, an associate member of the American Society of Cinematographers, member of the NAB Cine Consortium, member of the SciTech group at the Television Academy (Emmys), member of the National Academy of Television Arts & Sciences (NATAS), member of International Association of Aviation Photographers, past section manager of SMPTE, member of STE, SBE and California Broadcasters Association.\n\n1:15 pm – 1:35 pm\n\nOpening Keynote\n\nPhil Galler, Lux Machina\n\nPhil Galler\n\nLux Machina\n\nAs a principal and founder at Lux Machina Consulting, I strive to push the boundaries of technology and design in the entertainment industry.\n\nFocusing on in-camera visual effects, real-time mixed reality, and the future of film making and live broadcast, I have been fortunate enough to find myself at the crossroads of technological innovation and creativity.\n\nWorking closely with clients in a wide variety of entertainment formats, I tackle complex, large scale entertainment projects. Finding ways to empower my clients with versatile design options, new technology and unique solutions is a continued mission in my new venture.\n\nBefore starting Lux Machina Consulting with two of my colleagues, I worked for Production Resource Group (PRG), one of the largest entertainment technology vendors in the world. In my first role as a production coordinator, I handled logistics, design and execution of large multi discipline jobs. After many successful shows and events, I transitioned into member of PRG’s full time event staff, where I designed, programmed and project managed some of the most preeminent shows in the entertainment industry.\n\nI am truly passionate and genuinely invested in bringing technology such as high end media servers, automated lighting, LED and Projection systems to the film market. By merging new tools and products with the hard to crack film market, I am able to provide unique solutions to cinematographers, artists and producers. Having helped spearhead the modern use of interactive, immersive lighting setups on stage to accompany the ever changing VFX workflow, I have an intimate understanding of film sets, and the intricacies of that market.\n\nI am always interested in discussing new projects and ideas for the entertainment industry! Please reach out to talk about an upcoming project and how I might be able to help you, or just to chat about technology in the industry.\n\n1:35 pm – 2:20 pm\n\nBlending Broadcast and Cine Workflows in Today's Day-to-Day Sports, Entertainment, Corporate and Concert Productions\n\nKey industry personnel share from both technical and creative perspectives how they are using cine cameras to enhance their storytelling capabilities.\n\nModerator: Mark Chiolis, Mobile TV Group\n\nMark Chiolis\n\nMobile TV Group\n\nMark Chiolis is the Director of Business Development for Mobile TV Group (MTVG), which provides facilities for over 4,000 live professional and college sports and entertainment events annually, with more than 35 mobile units, and dozens of remote Cloud Control facilities, based throughout the U.S. MTVG has been leading the 4K/UHD/HDR/Cloud live event production with key broadcasters, networks and distribution companies.\n\nMark is currently working to interface with customers and partners to develop and support MTVG’s entertainment, awards, corporate, concerts, egames, and esports events with current and new trucks, using both broadcast and cine workflows.\n\nPrior to MTVG, Chiolis worked in marketing, business development, and sales for Grass Valley, Thomson, Technicolor, Philips, and BTS as well as at television stations KMUV, KRBK and KVIE.\n\nChiolis is an active board member of the HPA, an associate member of the American Society of Cinematographers, member of the NAB Cine Consortium, member of the SciTech group at the Television Academy (Emmys), member of the National Academy of Television Arts & Sciences (NATAS), member of International Association of Aviation Photographers, past section manager of SMPTE, member of STE, SBE and California Broadcasters Association.\n\nDavid Bourgeois, Cyanview\n\nDavid Bourgeois\n\nCyanview\n\nDavid started in the broadcast industry by joining I-Movix as CTO, manufacturing slow-motion camera systems based on Vision Research Phantom cameras for the live sport events. David founded Cyanview in 2015 which designs camera control interfaces to integrate any kind of specialty cameras in broadcast workflows. This includes shading panels, interfaces for various cameras, lenses or other accessories and robotics. These products now also take place into smaller productions providing remote shading and lens control to mid-range D-Cinema cameras. The architecture being all IP based, this is now also used for remote productions where any camera controlled locally can now be also controlled over the internet.\n\nDavid always worked closely with video engineers in order to bring the best out of each camera in terms of image control and quality. The VP4 is a unique video processor designed to help with camera matching. The current interest in integrating D-Cinema cameras into broadcast workflows will lead to some new designs around this solution to combine the requirements of live shading with the creativity of post production grading.\n\nKevin Norris, Freelance Video Engineer\n\nKevin Norris\n\nFreelance Video Engineer\n\nKevin is a freelance broadcast engineer based in San Diego, CA.
