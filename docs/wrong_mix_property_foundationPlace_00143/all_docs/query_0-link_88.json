        "text": "Dokken had a rightful place among the hair/glam metal subgenre of heavy metal, and it certainly was not a \"heavy\" group by any standard. However, that should not take away from the brilliance of Lynch's guitar work. Following his time with Dokken, Lynch enjoyed reasonable success with Lynch Mob, which made music for parts of three decades. Known for his intricate playing and stellar finger work, Lynch made a name for himself as a standout soloist. He's the main reason to appreciate either of his aforementioned bands.\n\nSlipknot has done a good job of setting itself apart from other thrash/nu metal/alternative metal acts. Root is certainly a major reason for that distinction, rising to become one of the most prominent guitarists within the entire metal movement. In whichever of those aforementioned categories one wants to choose, Root fits well into them all. Aggressive, but concise and clean might be appropriate ways to describe Root's playing, whether in the confines of Slipknot or while serving as lead guitarist for the popular Stone Sour, which includes Slipknot vocalist Corey Taylor.\n\nCurrently part of the three-pronged Iron Maiden guitar attack, Murray is known for his smooth play, especially when it comes to transition and chord progressions. Just give a listen to the Maiden classic \"The Trooper,\" for proof. Though he may not play with the fury of his bandmates (more to come about one of them), Murray is one of the best melodic guitar players in the metal genre. Murray and bassist/band founder Steve Harris are the only members to play on every one of Iron Maiden's studio releases.\n\nIt's not easy choosing among Machine Head's bevy of talented lead guitarists over the years. However, Demmel seems like an easy choice, and when teamed with the rhythmic greatness of Flynn, Machine Head seemed at its all-time best for nearly two decades (until Demmel left the band) dating back to the early 2000s. While Machine Head is known for its aggressive sound as one of the key figures amid the so-called \"new wave of American heavy metal,\" the band has usually been defined by its raucous, yet precise riffs. And, no doubt, championed by Flynn and Demmel.\n\nReid might not fit the mold of the traditional heavy metal guitarist, but he's certainly worthy of a spot on this list. An eclectic performer on the guitar, Reid gained mainstream notoriety during the late 1980s while shredding with avant-garde, progressively alterna`tive, funk-metal favorites Living Colour — while also incorporating elements of modern jazz and R&B, and successfully catering to the heavy metal crowd. While Reid and the band continue to make music and tour, his best work might still be found on their debut hit \"Cult of Personality.\"\n\nWhen it comes to modern-day guitarists who have made a name for themselves in the last couple of decades, Gates (born Brian Elwin Haner Jr.) is one of the more celebrated hard rock/heavy metal superstars. Though frontman M. Shadows gets a lot of attention, the true bloodline of third-generation metal giants Avenged Sevenfold is Gates. Though his ability to shred is well known, Gates is among the few artistic metal guitarists. He takes influences from the world of jazz and classical music and incorporates them into his playing, resulting in a unique troupe of melodic metal mastery.\n\nThere are several guitarists on this list who have been influenced by the famed German axe man. Now, Roth can be labeled as a true rock guitarist, notably while starring with the Scorpions in the early-to-mid-1970s, then Electric Sun. However, as the heavy metal genre continued to evolve during that decade, Roth's style veered to a melodically heavier, neoclassical vibe. That, in turn, became another subgenre of metal, further pioneered by the likes of Deep Purple. In addition, there has always been a strong blues influence to Roth's guitar work.\n\nWhen it comes to trendsetting guitarists within the metal subgenres of thrash and death metal, Kisser was been a longtime star, while a force within legendary Brazilian group Sepultura. Kisser can not only deliver spine-breaking solos and monster riffs, but his ability to groove on the guitar has been an influence to many other players. Notably those in the Nu metal genre, which Kisser — depending on who is doing the talking — has been credited with actually creating, even though Sepultura is a thrash band at heart.\n\nThe legendary Swedish guitarist played with early-1980s metal acts Steeler and Alcatrazz, but Malmsteen earned most of his acclaim as a solo artist. A master technician of the guitar, Yngwie has drawn throngs of fans while showcasing his neoclassical guitar style. Though Malmsteen never enjoyed the consistent mainstream success as some of his ‘80s metal contemporaries, he's long been regarded as one of the most influential and studied guitarists around the globe within that community — even to this day.\n\nThe founder and leader of Bay Area thrash stalwarts Exodus, Holt isn't always listed among the metal greats. Perhaps because Exodus never enjoyed the consistent mainstream success like other bands of its ilk -- notably its buddies from Metallica. Still, Holt is one of the most severe metal guitarists around (especially when it comes to his solo work), and also among the hardest working. In addition to his stellar work with Exodus, Holt stepped in during the early 2010s for Slayer guitarist Jeff Hanneman during his extended illness. Holt later became a full-time band member of the band upon Hanneman's death in May 2013.\n\nOne of the great technical heavy metal guitarists of all time. Testament's Skolnick was taught by the legendary Joe Satriani. When it comes to the intricacies of thrash metal, Skolnick makes it look quite easy. His time and finger work are second to none, while some might need a PhD to figure out his blistering chord progressions. Testament might not have enjoyed the consistent mainstream success like other metal bands of the 1980s and '90s, but Skolnick's guitar work should be loudly celebrated.\n\nWe might be playing with a gray area on whether Tremonti can be labeled a metal guitarist; Creed was certainly not metal, but power pop rock. However, Tremonti's stellar technical work, whether when riffing or soloing, gave that band a modicum of credibility. However, Alter Bridge is heavier, but still melodic, with plenty of pop sensibilities. With Tremonti shredding even harder, Alter Bridge can fit well into the alternative metal subgenre, and generate little argument. Anyway we can slice it, Tremonti is an exceptional guitar player that can play anything, with anyone.\n\nWe touched on Iron Maiden bandmate Dave Murray, but when it comes to the driving lead force amid the longtime triple-guitar assault within the band, Smith is the king above kings. Complete with his usual headband, Smith is a groover — meaning his playing has a undeniably blues feel to it. While it's never really been about speed with Smith, when it comes to legendary solo work (\"Heaven Can Wait\", \"Powerslave), he continues to bring it at a level that others only wish they could pull off.\n\nOften overshadowed by Metallica's frontman, rhythm guitarist and band leader James Hetfield (more from him in a bit), Hammett might be one of the most underrated guitarists in hard rock/metal history. Hammett doesn't draw too much attention to himself off stage, and is more casual and laid back than other members of the legendary metal outfit. However, when it comes to playing the guitar, Hammett can deliver at a blistering pace without compensating style or flare. Just listen to Metallica classics like \"For Whom the Bell Tolls (1985),\" \"Master of Puppets\" (1986) and \"One\" (1988), to get a true test of his stellar lead guitar work.\n\nAnthrax is considered part of the \"Big 4\" of thrash metal, along with Metallica, Megadeth and Slayer. Yet, there tends to be an underrated quality when it comes to Ian's place among the heavy metal's great guitarists. Anthrax has always been a unique band, but when it comes to the great rhythm guitarists within the metal movement, Ian must be considered one of the best to ever play. His ability to keep a track moving with his killer riffs, regardless of pace or speed, is quite impeccable. Not to mention, he's the backbone and life energy of a band that just keeps going — and getting heavier.\n\nOzzy Osbourne has been associated with some of the greatest guitarists in the world, and Wylde can certainly challenge for the top spot in that category. A true character, the often leather-clad, long-bearded Wylde, known for his bevy of creative-looking guitars, is relentless when it comes to his lead play. While he can melt faces with his solos, there is an obvious bluesy influence within his work, whether rocking alongside Ozzy, with longtime band Black Label Society or as a member of the new-look Pantera lineup, with surviving members Phil Anselmo and Rex Brown.\n\nTo those old-schooler metal heads, Schuldiner is considered the \"Godfather of Death Metal.\" Sadly, a brain tumor eventually took Schuldiner's life at only 34 years old. However, his legacy as one of the most legendary metal guitarists continues to live on amid celebration. He founded and fronted death metal favorites Death during the early 1980s, and from there, opened the door for many guitarists to rip open their aggression and put it all into this relentless and chaotic form of metal. Perhaps most impressive, Schuldiner essentially taught himself to play guitar.\n\nWhen it comes to true pioneers of the heavy metal sound, Blackmore needs to be placed near the top of the list. Sure, he can be domineering within the confines of a group, but there really is no arguing Blackmore’s talent when it comes to mastering the guitar. The Deep Purple star (not to mention his time with Rainbow) helped define the hard rock/heavy metal guitar sound while also mixing in some blues and raw aggression. His performance on the Deep Purple classic \"Highway Star\" is the gem of his resume, but his catalog is filled with consistent greatness.\n\nMustaine has always seemed to be his worst enemy, especially when it comes to his abusing his body. Sure, years of hard drug use and drinking didn't help, but when it comes to the epitome of a heavy metal guitar player, Mustaine is the poster boy. He's not the hardest player, but his speed — even in his aging state — is second to none. And, he can still head bang, even if his neck and other body parts have suffered. Mustaine managed to overcome those demons (for the most part) and the sacrificing of his body to deliver some of the greatest thrash and metal songs of all time.\n\nThe furious, aggressive double assault of Kerry King and Jeff Hanneman can best be described as relentless. If there is such a thing as a musical brawl, the Slayer sound was it. King and Hanneman were a big reason for that. \"Seasons of the Abyss,\" from the 1990 album by the same name, is a perfect example of King and Hanneman each showing off their other-worldly guitar talents. Though Hanneman passed away in 2013, and the aforementioned Gary Holt filled the void admirably, the lasting greatness of the King/Hanneman duo will live on through some of the greatest thrash music of all time\n\nFor decades, legendary British metal trendsetters Judas Priest boasted two of the genre's greatest dual-lead guitarists in Downing and Tipton. There are countless examples of their collective assault on the metal movement; they especially shined on \"Victim of Changes.\" Individually, two of Tipton's most notable solos can be found on \"Beyond the Realms of Death\" and \"Painkiller.\" Meanwhile, Downing also stands out on the latter, and \"Sinner.\" However, as Downing has noted in recent years, these two influential guitarists were never as close as fans might expect.\n\nHetfield is the hard-nosed taskmaster and undisputed life blood of Metallica (no offense to pal and co-founder Lars Ulrich). He is Metallica's principal songwriter, and his lyrics tend to be extremely personal. However, those within the heavy metal community regard Hetfield as the best rhythm guitarist within the genre — and it's not all that close. Hetfield is meticulous when it comes to his playing, almost to a fault in some cases. The complexity and intricacies of his guitar work often leaves fans — and his own bandmates -- in awe.\n\nWhen it comes to the legacy of Randy Rhoads, it’s usually about what could have been. The guitar virtuoso, who also gave lessons, died during a senseless plane crash in 1982, at age 25. A co-founder of the band that would become Quiet Riot, Rhoads, however, earned international notoriety playing lead guitar at the beginning of Ozzy Osbourne’s solo career. Osbourne’s Blizzard of Ozz (1980) record was the defining moment of Rhoads’ all-too-brief career. Classics like “Crazy Train,” “Mr. Crowley” and “Steal Away (The Night)” are just a few examples of Rhoads’ excellence.\n\nBlack Sabbath has long been considered the \"Godfathers of Heavy Metal.\" And honestly, much of that had to do with Iommi's distortedly menacing, almost haunting guitar work. This Sabbath legend might not be the best guitarist of all time, but he’s certainly one of the most important. A master of the riff, Iommi’s work often had a hint of the blues. but in a famously heavy, dark way. He influenced a generation of rock and heavy metal guitarists, and the iconic Sabbath gem “Iron Man” is a perfect example of the left-hander's immense talent.\n\nWhen it comes to guitar-playing versatility, \"Dime\" could do it all. If he wasn't playing metal, Dimebag probably would have excelled as a straight-up rock guitarist, perhaps even a classically-trained virtuoso. However, thankfully for metal fans, Dimebag made his bones musically crushing skulls with Pantera, a band that that fused thrash, groove and speed metal together in forming one of the most unique and influential sounds of all time. Arguably, there hasn't been a metal guitarist over the past 30 years who has exuded as much praise than Abbott. And, even in the wake of his tragic death in 2004, Dimebag's career continues to be celebrated and his legacy stronger than ever."
