        "text": "Because at Spectrum, the opportunities that I've been able to do with this job has been amazing.\n\nWhen we moved here, we were building a new house, we got to go pick out what we're building, the plans, the whole nine.\n\nI wanted to show people like if you put the work in and you sacrifice you can make whatever goals you want.\n\nI've done the work, I've done the sacrifices, and I've jumped on the opportunities, and I've done everything I can to get myself to this level.\n\nI was also in the Reserves through that so I was still getting deployed and Spectrum has those programs to keep you employed so when you come back you don't have to stress about having a job.\n\nWhen I was in California, I entered into the Future Leader Program which was the 18-month training and then essentially placement into a senior leadership role.\n\nIf it wasn't for that program, I never would have got the chance to bridge into Net Operations and specifically the ISP Department.\n\nSpectrum has those reimbursement programs. I almost got a master's degree free after everything was said and done was just very minimal cost out of pocket. And now that the program is 10 grand my son is doing that exact same program. He works as an Internet Repair Rep I he's been doing it for about six months and he's going to school full-time here in Louisville and using that reimbursement program to get him through school.\n\nThe company is there and the pay the benefits that come along as you progress are definitely worth the sacrifices.\n\nAs leaders we need to understand that that's what makes us better, that makes the company better to constantly remind everybody that ‘here are opportunities, you got to go get them.’\n\nThey definitely open up new doors. It’s life-changing."
