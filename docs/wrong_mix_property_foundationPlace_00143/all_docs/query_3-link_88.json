        "text": "Stampede Week has come and gone, however, it’s important to recognize just how incredible the week’s festivities were for Cariboo Chilcotin and our local economy. From rodeos to pancake breakfasts and everything in between, these hallmark events helped us welcome thousands of visitors to our region. They supported our businesses, experienced the cultural fabric that makes us a diverse and welcoming community and they enjoyed our natural beauty.\n\nWith this in mind, it is also important to remember and proudly acknowledge that these things are not possible without the dedicated support of hundreds of volunteers who take the time to ensure we have safe and exciting experiences. From flipping pancakes, to getting blisters from setting up stages and attractions, these folks are the backbone of our community spirit and they deserve our thanks and appreciation.\n\nI also want to give a special shout-out to this year’s South Cariboo Citizen of the Year which was announced at the 108 Heritage site on Canada Day. We had seven talented and qualified nominees: Courtney White, Lori Fry, Shannon Sadlowski, Nicole Blades, Brian Brown and Mildred Halcro. Each one of these community members has risen to the challenge to make the place we call home even better.\n\nThis year, Mildred Halcro won the South Cariboo Citizen of the Year prize and it was an honour to present her with this well-deserved award and recognition. Mildred has been living in South Cariboo since 1953 and has quite an impressive list of activities and accomplishments when it comes to community service. From helping the Cedar Crest Society For Community Living get off the ground in its early days to rolling up her sleeves to help out the 100 Mile Festival of the Arts, Mildred is a champion in our community and I know she is appreciated by so many of us here. Thank you Millie and thank you to all of this year’s nominees! We are grateful for all you do for us, even when it’s not always seen!\n\nAs we all continue to enjoy our beautiful British Columbia summer days, let's continue to think about how we can do our part to help out in our community and how we can ensure our volunteers get the thanks and appreciation they deserve. I encourage you to reach out to an event that’s happening in Cariboo Chilcotin this summer to see how you can pitch in and meet new friends. Be safe this summer, enjoy time with your friends and loved ones and remember to take time to thank a volunteer when you’re exploring all our province has to offer!"
