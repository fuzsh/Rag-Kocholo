With our volunteers supporting all of the centreâ€™s activities, their capacity is limited in assisting children who require help in the washrooms. Hand washing support will be provided.\n\nMy child has unique needs and requires professional care or specialized assistance. Can they use the space?\n\nWe want to be able to assist with specialized care requests but at this time, the centre does not provide specialized support and can only support children who if required, attend with a professional support person who is welcome, but retained by the family.\n\nCan staff or visitors of the campus use the space for their children?"
