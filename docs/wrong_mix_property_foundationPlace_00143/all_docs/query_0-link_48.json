        "text": "Following acclaimed runs in New York, London, Edinburgh, Melbourne, Boston, and Washington D.C., as well as a six-time extended Off-Broadway engagement leading into Broadway, Alex Edelman’s JUST FOR US finally goes on tour.\n\nIn the wake of a string of anti-Semitic threats pointed in his direction online, standup comic Edelman decides to go straight to the source; specifically, Queens, where he covertly attends a meeting of White Nationalists and comes face-to-face with the people behind the keyboards. What happens next forms the backbone of the shockingly relevant, utterly hilarious, and only moderately perspirant stories that comprise JUST FOR US.\n\nExpertly crafted by one of comedy’s most distinctive voices, this singular theatrical experience is an exploration of identity and our collective capacity for empathy — oh, and it’s also “belly-laugh funny!” (The New York Times)\n\n“Uproarious! Among Edelman’s many strengths as a writer and performer is an exceptional eye for the absurd.” (The New Yorker)\n\nAlex Edelman is a comedian and writer whose Orthodox Jewish upbringing has informed critically and commercially acclaimed work for the stage and screen. He is known both for his solo shows - three, all award-winning, sell-out hits in London’s West End and the Edinburgh Fringe Festival - and for his TV writing. At the start of the pandemic, he served as the head writer and executive producer of Saturday Night Seder, a star studded 70-minute special, posted on YouTube, that has so far raised $3.5 million for the CDC Foundation (COVID-19) Emergency Response Fund.\n\nAdam Brace (Director) (1980-2023) was Associate Director at Soho Theatre, London, where he worked across Comedy, Theatre and Performance Art. Within comedy he developed a varied range of work, which included 6 Edinburgh Comedy Award-nominated shows, 2 Herald Angel Award winners, 2 Barry Award nominees, and a Southbank Award. He was Creative Supervisor on Soho Theatre’s Amazon Prime series and was Live Director on Ahir Shah’s HBO Max special, “Dots.” He had worked with Alex Edelman since 2014."
