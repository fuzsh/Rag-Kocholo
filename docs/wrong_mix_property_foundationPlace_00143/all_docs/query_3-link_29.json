Thankfully, we’ve got some tips from an industry veteran, Brian Upton, to guide you.\n\nHis journey began at RedStorm Entertainment, contributing to classics like Rainbow Six and Ghost Recon, and continued for 14 years as a senior game designer at Sony Santa Monica.\n\nWith a career spanning two decades, he’s been on the receiving end of numerous game pitches, which makes him the perfect mentor to navigate the do's and don'ts of game pitch decks.\n\n7 key mistakes to avoid:\n\nOverloading with backstory: Avoid starting your pitch with an extensive backstory of the game world. Remember, the pitch is about selling the concept, not delving deep into lore.\n\nLacking a clear vision: Don’t ask the listener what they want to see; instead, present a clear, confident vision of the game you are passionate about creating.\n\nNeglecting player experience description: Ensure you clearly articulate what the player will actually do in the game. Describe the gameplay experience in detail.\n\nIneffective prototypes: Your prototype should highlight unique aspects of your game, not just basic functionalities. Make sure it showcases the game’s hook and demonstrates your ability to overcome challenges.\n\nPoor quality artwork: Quality over quantity. One or two outstanding art pieces are better than multiple mediocre ones. Also, distinguish clearly between placeholder and final art.\n\nUndefined scope and resources: Know your game's scope and have a clear idea of the budget, timeline, and team size needed. An undefined scope can make your project seem unfeasible.\n\nUnrealistic business plans: Base your business plan on realistic projections, not outlier successes. Aim for a balanced approach that aligns with your game's scope and market potential.\n\nIf you’d like to learn more, you can check out the full video of Brian’s speech below:\n\nHow to design a game pitch deck?\n\nYour deck's design can significantly influence how your game is perceived and can be the difference between capturing attention or being overlooked.

Incorporate interactive elements like clickable demos, embedded gameplay videos, or even mini-games.\n\nThis interactivity not only showcases your game's features but also keeps the audience engaged. Multimedia elements like sound clips, animations, and videos can bring your game's world to life right within the deck.\n\n3) Use data visualization\n\nData visualization is a powerful tool to present market research, player demographics, and financial projections.\n\nComplex data can be transformed into easy-to-understand graphs, charts, and infographics. This not only makes your deck more visually appealing but also ensures that your data is easily digestible and memorable.\n\nHere's a great example of data visualization:\n\n4) Personalize your deck\n\nPersonalization can make a significant impact. Interactive pitch deck software allows you to connect to your CRM and use dynamic variables to personalize the deck with the viewer's name or company name.\n\nThis tailored approach shows attention to detail and can create a more meaningful connection with your audience.\n\nIf you want to find the best tool for your needs, I prepared a handy list of the best pitch deck software currently available.\n\n5) Use cohesive branding\n\nTailor your pitch deck to reflect your game's style and personality. Use colors, fonts, and imagery that align with your game's aesthetic.\n\nThis type of personalization creates a cohesive visual experience and helps your audience immerse themselves in your game's world from the first slide.\n\n6) Ensure mobile-responsive design\n\nIn today's world, it's crucial to ensure your pitch deck is mobile-responsive.\n\nYour audience might view your deck on various devices, so it should look great and function well on everything from a smartphone to a large monitor. A mobile-responsive design ensures accessibility and convenience for your viewers.\n\nHere's an example of a mobile-responsive deck:\n\n7) Highlight key information\n\nDesign your pitch deck to focus the viewer's attention on the most important information.\n\nTechniques like graying out content help guide the reader's focus to the most critical elements at a time, ensuring that key points are effectively communicated without overwhelming the audience.\n\n8) Segment content in tabs\n\nOrganize your content in tabs to cater to different aspects of your game and audience. This approach allows viewers to easily navigate through your deck and focus on the sections most relevant to them.\n\nSegmenting content in tabs also helps in structuring your presentation logically, making it more user-friendly and effective.\n\nHere's an example of a deck with segmented content:\n\nGame pitch deck templates\n\nStarting your game pitch deck can be challenging, especially when you're trying to encapsulate the spirit of your game into a presentation.\n\nInteractive game pitch deck templates are here to ease this process.
