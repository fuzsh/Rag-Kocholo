        "text": "Imagine getting about 90 seconds notice before jumping into a live role on stage in a national tour of a Broadway musical like Disney’s “The Lion King.”\n\nFor guys like Christopher L. McKenzie Jr., that happens on a regular basis. He is what is called a “swing” in musical theater, meaning his job is to be prepared to step up and perform any role in the show’s ensemble – sometimes at a moment’s notice, sometimes mid-show and often doing it so seamlessly that the audience doesn’t even notice. Unlike an understudy, which is someone who learns one or two principal roles, a swing typically covers anywhere from five to 15 tracks (or parts) in a show’s ensemble.\n\nMcKenzie is touring with “The Lion King” as a swing and a dance captain and is ready to cover more than 85 different scenes, (13 tracks) in the musical as needed.\n\nOften swings fill in when other performers take vacation time. But with COVID affecting many performers’ ability to go on when symptoms arise, swings have been more important than ever to keeping the lights on and theater seats full.\n\n“Pre-COVID you’d go on once or twice a month,” McKenzie said. “You’d be on standby, mostly, but post COVID you find you don’t have enough coverage. Having three swings used to feel like plenty of coverage. Now you find there are times where it’s like ‘wait a minute, we need swings to do the whole show.’ You can never have too many swings. They will forever be vital.”\n\nNiani Feelings is currently touring with “Mean Girls” as a swing, an understudy and the dance captain. In addition to knowing all the dance numbers well enough to teach them, she swings for eight ensemble tracks and can fill in for one of the main character roles.\n\n“Right now we are up to eight swings,” Feelings said. “We started back on the road with six but have been adding some coverage. We used to only have four.”\n\nUnsung theatrical heroes\n\nUnlike many theatrical performers who get to steal the show with their performance, enjoy the spotlight during curtain calls and hear thunderous applause, the goal of a swing is to fly under the radar and ideally not even be noticed at all.\n\n“Our entire job is to make sure the audience doesn’t know anything is different,” Feelings said. “It’s an interesting dynamic. So much work and not as many accolades. The biggest compliment you can get as a swing is for someone in the cast to say they didn’t even notice anything was different. That means you did everything correctly.”\n\nMcKenzie recently jumped in for a performer who hurt his knee mid-show.\n\n“I didn’t miss a beat,” he said. “I made it in that scene in less than 80 seconds. That’s what we do as swings. You shouldn’t notice that we switched. It should be a seamless transition.”\n\nAnd while swings may go weeks without performing at all, there’s also the other end of that spectrum.\n\nIt was 2018 at the second of a double Father’s Day show in Dallas. A night McKenzie will never forget.\n\n“I got a text an hour before the evening show saying they needed me to come in,” he said. “They said they were out five male dancers and one swing. There was no way they could make the show happen with only two male dancers. We walked through each scene to see what we could cut. The other dancer did his track and I did everything around him. I worked to fill the stage. I was four different male dancers and one male singer in one show. Technically, I covered five parts in one show with about an hour’s notice.”\n\nFeelings said swings have a lot of pride and integrity in the work they do because they are the reason a show doesn’t have to cancel in the event of an injury or a performer coming down with COVID.\n\n“We ensure a show is going to happen. You might not get the praise from the outside, but you can know you stepped in and saved a show or did your job well. It’s a different high five than the rest of the industry,” she said.\n\nOn Jan. 19, the Actors’ Equity Association celebrated the seventh annual National Swing Day to honor the hard-working performers who go onstage often with little notice for multiple roles, often ensuring the curtain can rise at all.\n\nThat night, at the end of “The Lion King” at the Tennessee Performing Arts Center in downtown Nashville, actor Ben Lipitz, who plays Pumbaa, recognized the swings from the stage and solicited for them a special round of applause.\n\n“Swings are those rare performers who step into as many as 13 different roles on any given night,” he told the crowd. “Some nights they are called upon and given a moment’s notice to do so. Being a gifted swing requires a skillset far beyond talent. Our swings, our standbys and our understudies are the backbone of our company and without them the curtain would not rise. Please give them a generous round of applause.”\n\nThe swing book\n\nSo how do these amazing performers remember so many roles, lines, dances, locations on stage and everything else that comes with an on-stage performance? Three words: the swing book.\n\nMcKenzie says he couldn’t do his job without it.\n\n“Your swing book keeps you in line,” he said. “It keeps us in the cleanest clarity of our decision making. You have a graph of the entire stage and you write where everyone is in space. I always have my swing book to keep me on my A-game.”\n\nMatthew Edward Kemp, a swing in “Dear Evan Hansen,” says his swing book is quite a colorful collection of notes to himself.\n\n“I am big on color coordination, so in my binder, each role has its own color,” he said. “Lines being highlighted in a certain color helps me organize my brain. I think I almost know everyone’s lines verbatim. Even lines I don’t cover.”\n\nOnce in Vancouver, a performer started feeling ill about five minutes before showtime. Kemp had a lot to do in a short amount of time to get himself ready.\n\n“I had to get in costume, which included painting my nails,” he said. “I remember people fanning my nails to try to get them dry in time.”\n\nFeelings added that every time a swing is called in to perform, it’s always a challenge.\n\n“There’s only so much information you can keep in mind,” she said. “That’s why we rely on tracking sheets or notes for each role you are doing. You will always find a swing with their tracking sheet in the corner before they go on. The support from the rest of the company is amazing. Nobody’s perfect. You can only do the best you can do.”\n\nAlaina Anderson, a swing in “Dear Evan Hansen,” said audiences should always go into a show with an open mind.\n\n“People think because someone is an understudy or a swing, they aren’t as good as the original performer,” she said. “But ... every person you have the potential to see on that stage has worked hard to get there.”\n\n“Mean Girls” is coming to TPAC Feb. 8-13 and “Dear Evan Hansen” will be here March 2-6.
