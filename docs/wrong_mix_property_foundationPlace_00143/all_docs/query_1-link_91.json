        "text": "Series to be based on Ryan McMahon and Jesse Brown’s acclaimed investigative podcast exploring the impact of colonialism on Canada’s Indigenous peoples\n\nThe podcast has been hailed as “riveting”, “smart and thought-provoking”, “unsparing”, and “vital listening”\n\nTORONTO, ON—Northwood Entertainment (ANNE WITH AN E, THE GRIZZLIES) has partnered with the producers of the Canadaland podcast ‘Thunder Bay’ – and together they are developing the podcast into a drama series. Miranda de Pencier’s Northwood Entertainment will co-produce the series alongside Anishinaabe comedian, writer, & podcaster Ryan McMahon, and journalist & Canadaland founder/publisher, Jesse Brown.\n\nExecutive producers McMahon, Brown, and de Pencier are currently considering showrunners for the series.\n\nHosted and co-written by McMahon, the serialized, true crime podcast examines the systemic racism, corruption, and crime that runs rampant in Thunder Bay and the factors that make the city amongst the most dangerous for Indigenous youth in the world. THUNDER BAY plans to bring all of these issues to light in a searing and riveting drama series that considers not who killed nine Indigenous high school students, but what killed them. The series begins with an examination of nine deaths and goes on to explore the broader impact of colonialism and racism.\n\n“The fact that a podcast like ‘Thunder Bay’ has received more than a million downloads globally, makes it clear that the world is ready to hear about the complex and nuanced relationship between Indigenous and non Indigenous people,” said Ryan McMahon, co-writer and host of ‘Thunder Bay’. “We just scratched the surface of these stories through our podcast, the team at Northwood Entertainment will help us bring the complicated dance of colonialism to the screen.”\n\n“On our podcast, Ryan only told a fraction of the shocking stories that we found in Thunder Bay,” said Jesse Brown, founder and publisher of Canadaland. “With Miranda’s excellent help, we will keep holding a mirror up to this troubled city, and to Canada itself. These stories cannot be told enough.”\n\n“Thunder Bay’ is the most gut-wrenching, outrageous, shocking and important podcast I have ever experienced,” said Northwood Entertainment CEO Miranda de Pencier. “I love my country, but it’s messed up. So working with Ryan and Jesse to turn their brilliant podcast into a dramatic series right now feels beyond insanely exciting. It feels vital.”\n\nTHUNDER BAY executive producers are Miranda de Pencier, Ryan McMahon, and Jesse Brown. Northwood Entertainment and Canadaland will co-produce the series.\n\nFor more information and to arrange interviews, please contact:\n\nGabrielle Free | Free Publicity (for Northwood Entertainment) gabfree.publicity@gmail.com\n\n416-220-0201\n\nAbout Northwood Entertainment\n\nFounded by Miranda de Pencier, Northwood Entertainment is a film and television production company with a mission to create a thriving home for creators with singular voices that reach global audiences.
