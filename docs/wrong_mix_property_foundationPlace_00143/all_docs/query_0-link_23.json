        "text": "Occasioned by the theatrical release of Last Summer (2023), Breillat’s first picture in a decade, “All True Artists Are Hated” surveys a feather-ruffling career, including new restorations, as well as 35mm presentations, of rarely screened works.\n\nFilm noir returns to The Cinematheque this summer for another lucifugous season of hard-bitten American crime fiction from arguably Hollywood’s most distinctive—and inarguably most misanthropic—chapter of moviemaking.\n\nWhile film noir is often considered an American phenomenon, it never would have existed without the émigré directors that entered Hollywood during that classic period.
