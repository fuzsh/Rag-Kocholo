This is typical of Ewan’s community-focused outlook. Still a relative newcomer to the international circuit, his commitment to building a local scene in Ayr, combined with his DJ skills and fearless approach to production make Ewan one of the most promising artists of his generation. Nominated in the Breakthrough DJ category at the DJ Mag Best of British Awards in 2020, he is ascending rapidly up the ranks. His gold selling single ‘Tell Me Something Good’ bought wins for two awards in 2021 - ‘Track of the Year’ for DJ Mag Best of British accompanied by Radio 1’s first ever ‘Electronic Track of the Year’. To date McVicar is especially proud of remixing one of the most important songs in recent electronic music folklore ‘Gabriel’ by Joe Goddard. Throughout June 2022, Ewan was invited to present the prestigious Radio 1 Residency which saw Ewan celebrate the music that had influenced and inspired him over the years, paying homage to his underground heroes as well as shining a light on homegrown producers from Ayr. The brains behind his own mini empire, this early success is a sure-fire sign of things to come. Hungry, determined and full of good vibes for all, Ewan McVicar is primed for the next phase of his burgeoning career…\n\nwww.thisisblueprint.com\n\n#FortuneSound\n\n@FortuneSound\n\nPlease be aware of ticket scams!\n\n• Only buy tickets online through our website or Official Promoters\n\n• Do not buy from someone you don't know\n\n• Buying resale tickets is at your own discretion\n\nView Event →\n\nZHEANI - The Maenad World Tour\n\nZHEANI\n\nTuesday.

His impact spans music, fashion and film, soundtracking some of the most important cultural moments in recent years, as well as building a catalogue of solo releases that traverse genre, style and composition. His irreplicable sound has been woven into the production of pop disruptors including Eartheater, Caroline Polachek and Shygirl, on her Mercury Prize-nominated record Nymph.\n\nIn late 2022, Sega released the 6Music playlisted single ‘Kepko’ closely followed by a remix of Björk's ‘Ovule’ in early 2023.

Born and raised in Los Angeles, Candy first gained notoriety from her work on Grimes’ 2012 music video “Genesis,” followed quickly by high-profile collaborations with such fellow iconoclasts as Charli XCX, Sia, Diplo, Lizzo, Pussy Riot, Sophie, Mykki Blanco, and countless more. The multi-faceted, infinitely talented Candy has explored an array of inspired possibilities throughout her career, from styling music videos (including Lizzo’s “Truth Hurts” and David Guetta & Afrojack Ft. Charli XCX & French Montana’s “Dirty Sexy Money”) and teaching performing arts classes at New York University to collaborations with the Brooklyn Museum and Los Angeles’ Museum of Contemporary Art (MOCA) and brand partnerships with MAC Cosmetics and Diesel. Candy has devoted much of her recent creative efforts to the art of tattooing, reinventing herself as a living, breathing cyborg centerfold whose work conjures the retro-futurism of Japanese illustrator Hajime Sorayama’s robotic pin-ups, fused with archetypal “Sailor Jerry” traditionalism.\n\nwww.thisisblueprint.com\n\nPlease be aware of ticket scams!\n\n• Only buy tickets online through our website or Official Promoters\n\n• Do not buy from someone you don't know\n\n• Buying resale tickets is at your own discretion\n\nView Event →\n\nLUNA LI\n\nLUNA LI\n\nMONDAY, OCTOBER 7\n\nMODO-LIVE, I am the Eggplant, Programme present...\n\nLuna Li - When a Thought Grows Wings Tour\n\nw/ Special Guests\n\nMonday October 7th, 2024\n\nFortune Sound Club\n\nVancouver, BC\n\nDoors: 6pm\n\nShow: 7pm\n\n19+\n\nARTIST Presale: Tuesday, May 21 @ 1pm LOCAL\n\nSPOTIFY Presale: Wednesday, May 22 @ 10am LOCAL\n\nPromoter Presales: Thursday, May 23 @ 10am LOCAL\n\n*All presales end: Thursday, May 23 @ 10pm LOCAL\n\nGENERAL ONSALE: Friday, May 24 @ 10am LOCAL\n\n#FortuneSound\n\n@FortuneSound\n\nPlease be aware of ticket scams!\n\n• Only buy tickets online through our website or Official Promoters\n\n• Do not buy from someone you don't know\n\n• Buying resale tickets is at your own discretion\n\nView Event →\n\nJessia\n\nLive Nation Presents:\n\nJessia\n\nThurs, Oct 24, 2024\n\nDoors 6pm\n\nOn Sale: Friday July 26 - General On-Sale – 10AM LOCAL\n\nwww.thisisblueprint.com\n\nPlease be aware of ticket scams!\n\n• Only buy tickets online through our website or Official Promoters\n\n• Do not buy from someone you don't know\n\n• Buying resale tickets is at your own discretion\n\nView Event →\n\nmoved to commodore!

The self- taught multi-instrumentalist and unashamed pop music fan is a student of the YouTube generation of songwriters/producers. Hailing from Oxfordshire, but now based in London, Artemas made the most of being restricted to his bedroom over the past couple of years, spending most waking hours during that time honing his studio craft. With release of his pretty mixtape earlier this year, led by single “if you think i’m pretty,” he garnered global attention with hundreds of millions of streams, while being named an Artist to Watch by both Hypebeast and Ones to Watch. Now, he continues his takeover with “i like the way you kiss me” zooming to over 520M streams, reaching #12 on the Billboard Hot 100 and #1 on Billboard 200 Ex-Us chart.\n\nAnnounce: Fri, May 17 @ 9am EST\n\nArtist Presale: Monday, May 20 @ 10am local\n\nLN Presales: Tuesday, May 21 @ 10am local\n\nSpotify Presale: Wednesday, May 22 @ 10am local\n\nOn Sale: Thurs, May 23 @ 10am Local\n\nwww.thisisblueprint.com\n\nPlease be aware of ticket scams!\n\n• Only buy tickets online through our website or Official Promoters\n\n• Do not buy from someone you don't know\n\n• Buying resale tickets is at your own discretion\n\nView Event →\n\nKate Bollinger\n\nKate Bollinger\n\nSaturday, November 16\n\nMODO-LIVE, I am the Eggplant, Programme present...\n\nKate Bollinger\n\nw/ Special Guests\n\nSaturday November 16th, 2024\n\nFortune\n\nVancouver, BC\n\nDoors: 6:30pm\n\nShow: 7pm\n\nVenue Configuration: GA\n\n19+\n\nView Event →\n\nŁaszewo - Live In Color\n\nŁaszewo\n\nSaturday, november 23, 2024\n\nBlueprint Events presents:\n\nŁaszewo - Live In Color\n\nSaturday, November 23 2024\n\nFortune Sound Club\n\n19+\n\nIndie electronic trio blending feel good EDM with pop, Łaszewo return to Vancouver and perform at Fortune Sound on November 23rd\n\nArtist Pre-Sale: Wednesday, June 19th @ 10am local\n\nSpotify Pre-Sale: Wednesday, June 19th @ 10am local\n\nOn Sale: Friday, June 21st @ 10am local\n\nwww.thisisblueprint.com\n\n#FortuneSound\n\n@FortuneSound\n\nPlease be aware of ticket scams!\n\n• Only buy tickets online through our website or Official Promoters\n\n• Do not buy from someone you don't know\n\n• Buying resale tickets is at your own discretion\n\nView Event →\n\nANTI PARTY AT WHERE YOU AT?

There’s no blueprint to Fenton’s music; his latest project, Sd-2, takes in tempos spanning hip-hop to drum & bass, with a few fruitful detours into beatless ambience and guitar-led instrumentals along the way.\n\nHe’s shared stages with artists such as Ecco2k, Amine, Oli XL, and Vegyn, among others. He also scored various compositions for brands such as Nike, Stussy, Converse, Vans, and more.\n\nSophia Stel:\n\nVancouver, BC based Sophia Stel writes songs that feel like a dream, a waking memory that grows more real the longer you sit with it. Her debut EP Object Permanence (out on New York City based imprint Pack Records this September) flits between poignant pop, patchwork synths and textural strands of dance music, all softly lit in the grey area between fantasy and revelation.\n\nView Event →\n\nVancouver international jazz festival: SUMAC WITH MOOR MOTHER\n\nSUMAC WITH MOOR MOTHER\n\nFriday, June 21\n\nPRESENTED BY COASTAL JAZZ FOR VANCOUVER INTERNATIONAL JAZZ FESTIVAL\n\nFriday, June 21, 2024\n\nFortune Sound Club\n\n7:00PM\n\n$37 plus service fees\n\n147 E Pender St, Vancouver, BC V6A 1T5\n\nSUMAC\n\nIn a time of significant social upheaval, SUMAC pushes further into the extreme polarity of their expressionistic metal, fluctuating between meticulous discipline on one end, and untethered feral energy on the other. This navigation of chaos and control is a testament to the technical skills and tour-honed collective intuition of guitarist/vocalist Aaron Turner (Isis, Old Man Gloom, Mamiffer), drummer Nick Yacyshyn (Baptists), and bassist Brian Cook (Russian Circles, These Arms Are Snakes).\n\nTheir humanistic lyrics strike a compassionate tone that stands in stark contrast to the misanthropy of some heavy music, and their sonic approach is akin to free jazz or abstract noise, where the emotional resonance isn’t bound up in melody as much as in performance. Fusing heavy riffage, knotty structures, and expressionistic forays into epic, wildly dynamic narrative arcs, the music of SUMAC is by no means a salve or anodyne, but neither is it nihilistic. Rather, it’s like a confrontation, a baptism by fire, a therapeutic razing. Ultimately, it’s a reminder of the life force that binds us together, and a clarion call to be an active participant in an evolving world.\n\nMoor Mother\n\nHow do you engage the stunning, evocative, haunting gift that is Moor Mother’s latest album The Great Bailout? Only by following the trail of potent verbal and sonic poetry. Only by letting Moor Mother be your guide.\n\nReleased March 8, The Great Bailout is Moor Mother aka Camae Ayewa’s ninth studio album, and third with ANTI- Records. Called “the poet laureate of the apocalypse,” by Pitchfork, Ayewa’s music contains multitudes of instruments, voices, and cacophony that take on themes of Afrofuturism, colonialism, commerce and collective memory with the forebearers of jazz, hip hop, and beat poetry in mind.\n\nMoor Mother is presented by Coastal Jazz in association with Queer Arts Festival.\n\nPlease note this venue is stair access only. 19+. No refunds.\n\nMore 2024 Vancouver International Jazz Fest shows here\n\nView Event →\n\nSister Nancy - Fortune 15 year anniversary\n\nSister Nancy\n\nFriday.

The New Yorker In the words of her iconic 1982 single Bam Bam, Sister Nancy is one inna three million, an artist whose talents truly come from creation. Regarded as the first female star in the male-dominated world of Jamaican dancehall, Sister Nancy continues to blaze new trails 35 years after the release of her first and only album. Recently recognized by Pitchfork as The Best Dancehall Song of All-Time, Bam Bam has been sampled, quoted and referenced in tracks by Lauryn Hill, Wiz Khalifa, Too Short, Kanye West and Jay-Z. Its ethereal and inherently Cinematic tones have made it a popular choice for films, too, leading to memorable scenes in 1998 Belly and Seth Rogen and James Franco The Interview (2014). Born Ophlin Russell, Nancy grew up in Kingston, Jamaica Papine district, in a large family that included dancehall pioneeR&Brigadier Jerry. Her familial ties afforded her an opportunity granted few, if any, Jamaican girls at the time: To deejay (or chat) songs on sound Systems, the local DJ crews that form the backbone of dancehall culture.\n\nwww.thisisblueprint.com\n\n#FortuneSound @FortuneSound\n\nPlease be aware of ticket scams!\n\n• Only buy tickets online through our website or Official Promoters\n\n• Do not buy from someone you don't know\n\n• Buying resale tickets is at your own discretion\n\nView Event →\n\nCatching Flies North American Tour 2024\n\nCatching Flies\n\nFriday, June 14th 2024\n\nBlueprint Events presents:\n\nCatching Flies North American Tour 2024\n\nFriday, June 14 2024\n\nFortune Sound Club\n\n19+\n\nBlurring the boundaries between mainstream and underground, making music that contains shades of everything from hip-hop to house, from soul to jazz, Catching Flies performs in Vancouver on June 14 at #FortuneSound\n\nwww.thisisblueprint.com\n\n#FortuneSound #Fortune15\n\n@FortuneSound\n\nPlease be aware of ticket scams!\n\n• Only buy tickets online through our website or Official Promoters\n\n• Do not buy from someone you don't know\n\n• Buying resale tickets is at your own discretion\n\nView Event →\n\nKitty Ca$H @ HEF\n\nKitty Ca$h\n\nFriday.
