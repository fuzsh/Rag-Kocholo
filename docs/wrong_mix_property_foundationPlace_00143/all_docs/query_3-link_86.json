        "text": "Who We Are\n\nWords shape our worlds.\n\nThey can delight, inspire, provoke, comfort and unite—as do the authors, journalists and poets who wield them. At the Vancouver Writers Fest we encourage readers of all ages to explore the power of storytelling, and books, through our dozens of events with local and international writers.\n\nOur activities include both year-round programming and our flagship, annual literary Festival: one of the largest and most prestigious in North America. Tens of thousands of readers visit the cultural hub of Granville Island and venues around Vancouver to connect with local and international authors during this week-long event.\n\nThroughout the year we offer free and paid events with established and emerging authors, in addition to youth education opportunities.\n\nMission: We connect people to exceptional books, ideas and dialogue through year-round programming that ignites a passion for words and the world around us.\n\nVision: A world in which the transformative power of books and ideas is the foundation of an empathetic, inspired and just society.\n\nFind out more about our programs below.\n\nHistory of the Festival\n\nThe Festival was inaugurated in 1988 by founding Artistic Director Alma Lee and City of Vancouver cultural planner, Lorenz von Fersen. Artistic Directors have included Alma Lee, Hal Wake and Leslie Hurtig.\n\nIn its 33 year history, the Vancouver Writers Fest has presented multiple award-winning writers from Canada and across the world including: Zadie Smith, Margaret Atwood, David Mitchell, Madeleine Thien, Marlon James, Malcolm Gladwell, Roxane Gay, David Sedaris, Viet Thanh Nguyen, Esi Edugyan, Alice Munro, Salman Rushdie, Rachel Kushner, Kevin Kwan, Kate Atkinson, Ian McEwan, Thomas King, Naomi Klein, Ian Rankin, Marilynne Robinson, Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie and more.\n\nFurther Reading\n\n2023 Annual Report (PDF)\n\nVWF Strategic Plan\n\nLegal Documents:\n\nVWF Bylaws, May 2024\n\nVWF-Constitution\n\nFAQ\n\nWhen is the Festival lineup announced each year?\n\nWe announce our October program to VWF members first in late August, and the first of our Incite events in early January.

Sometimes solo events with one author are shorter, and events with an intermission are often slightly longer. Youth events are usually under one hour. Events take many forms: readings, panel discussions, performances or interviews. All events are directed at the book-reading public.\n\nWhy aren’t there more practical “hands-on” courses or workshops offered for aspiring writers?\n\nThe focus of the VWF is on connecting writers with readers through interviews, performances, panel discussions and readings.

Our Youth events have suggested age ranges between grades K-12. Please note there may be content only suitable for adults at other events. We ask our audience to use their own discretion if bringing children.\n\nWhat age groups are your events suitable for?\n\nOur events are suitable for a wide range of ages, and older children will often enjoy events for adults, depending on the nature of conversation or reading.
