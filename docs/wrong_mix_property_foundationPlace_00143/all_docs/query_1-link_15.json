        "text": "Filming for The Night Agent Season 2 is currently underway. Ready for the second chapter of the popular Gabriel Basso-led series? Read on for everything we know about the next installment of Netflix’s popular action-thriller, including the release date, filming details, and more.\n\nBased on Matthew Quirk’s novel of the same name, The Night Agent is Netflix’s spy drama series that premiered on March 23, 2023. Basso stars as Peter Sutherland, a low-level FBI agent assigned to the “Night Action shift” to manage an emergency hotline catering to undercover operatives. The agent’s routine tasks take a dramatic turn when CEO Rose Larkin (Luciane Buchanan) reports the murder of her aunt and uncle. As Peter and Rose pursue the truth, they must confront the highest powers of government, putting their lives and careers on the line.\n\nThe series was created by showrunner Shawn Ryan, best known for The Shield and S.W.A.T. Ryan told Collider that he made a few changes to the TV series after talking with Quirk, the author, but many of the core details from the novel remain the same. “There’s a lot that’s similar, but there is a lot that’s different. But the spine and the basic hook and the main characters, in Peter and Rose and Diane Farr, are all lifted pretty exact from the book,” he explained.\n\nRyan’s version of The Night Agent has proved to be a massive success. It scored the third-best opening week for a new Netflix series behind Wednesday and Monster: The Jeffrey Dahmer Story. The Night Agent was also named the most-watched series for the first half of 2023, racking up 812.1 million hours of viewing.\n\nNow, almost one year after Season 1 first premiered, the second season of The Night Agent is officially in the works. Deadline reported that filming has started for the second season, and the team shared a new photo of Basso on set.\n\nLearn more about The Night Agent Season 2 below.\n\nWhen Does The Night Agent Season 2 Come Out?\n\nNetflix has not yet revealed an official release date for The Night Agent Season 2. However, the streaming giant recently announced that a second season is coming sometime in 2024.\n\nThe Night Agent received its Season 2 renewal on March 29, 2023, less than a week after it debuted on Netflix. “To see the tremendous reaction to the show has been a great joy and is a credit to our cast, our writers, our directors, our crew and our partners at Sony Pictures Television and Netflix,” Ryan said about the Season 2 news, according to Netflix’s Tudum.\n\nThe creator continued, “We couldn’t be any prouder or more excited to get cracking on Season 2 to share the further adventures of Night Action with our newfound fans.”\n\nWho Is In The Cast Of The Night Agent Season 2?\n\nGabriel Basso, Luciane Buchanan, and Amanda Warren are set to return for Season 2, plus a few new faces will join The Night Agent cast. On January 11, 2024, Berto Colon, Louis Herthum, and Arienne Mandi joined the crew as new series regulars, while Brittany Snow and Teddy Sears will appear as recurring roles.\n\n“Colon plays Solomon, a former Marine turned right-hand man/fixer for a powerful businessman; Herthum plays Jacob Monroe, an international businessman with powerful global connections that he uses to obtain valuable information; and Mandi plays Noor, a low-level aide in the Iranian mission to the United Nations in New York who is looking to leverage her access to top secret information into a better life for her and her family,” according to Deadline.\n\nWhat Is The Night Agent Season 2 About?\n\nThe plot for Season 2 of The Night Agent Season 2 is tightly under wraps, but the Season 1 finale gives viewers a major clue about what Peter will be up to in Season 2 of the anticipated series.\n\nIn the final scene of Season 1, Peter boards a jet where he’s handed a mysterious tablet. When he opens it, a folder loads that says, “Night Action: Mission Brief” — his next top-secret assignment.\n\n“I love the symbolism in that,” Ryan told Tudum about the scene. “That he’s the guy who, from the beginning, has been trying to do more, has been trying to be of service, has been trying to be noticed for his good qualities since his father was accused of bad qualities and people were suspicious about him.”\n\nUnfortunately, Ryan cautioned that Peter’s new gig is “going to bring new problems.” The showrunner continued, “One of the reasons we like Peter so much is he’s a rule follower who has such a strict moral code that he lives by. We admire the choices he makes. [As a night agent] those choices will become difficult, the stakes will become even higher and the danger he’s in will grow even bigger.”\n\nAs for what will happen between Peter and Rose in Season 2, Ryan added in the interview that he can’t wait to find out. “We’d love to tell that story,” he said. “If viewers react to the show the way that we hope they will, and if people come and check it out.”\n\nDeadline revealed that filming for Season 2 will primarily take place in New York City with additional filming in Thailand and Washington D.C. In contrast, Season 1 was set in Washington D.C., but filmed in Vancouver.\n\nStay tuned to learn more about Season 2 of The Night Agent, including the exact release date.\n\nSeason 1 of The Night Agent is streaming on Netflix."
