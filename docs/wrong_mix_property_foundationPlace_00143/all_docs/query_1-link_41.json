Having lived in more than 10 countries, she speaks a little German, a little French and has an ease with new cultures that belies her age.

She is always learning new skills on tour with her family show, Flynn Creek Circus. When she is not on tour, she attends High School and plays on the Varsity basketball team.\n\nEka Malboeuf\n\nAERIAL ROPE\n\neka’s life as a performer began in her backyard at the age of 4, where she put on her nightly solo show, The Opossum Show, for a mostly imaginary audience. This was, however, her only foray into the world of show business until she happened upon a small, local circus school at 19. At the time, she couldn’t go upside down or do even a single push up, much less climb a rope. She had absolutely no background or aptitude whatsoever, but she just *really* wanted it and kept at it day after day, year after year. Although fraught with challenge and peril, circus has allowed her to be an adult version of her four year old self, living out her childhood dream and performing different versions of The Opossum Show to audiences near and far. Eka is delighted to join Flynn Creek Circus for a third season.\n\nIn addition to being a circus artist, eka also holds a BFA in fashion design from Academy of Art University. She makes one-of-a-kind costumes and designs for the occasion of life.\n\nShe is a lover of movement, embodied expression, and the absolute strange and beautiful magic of being human. When she is not performing, eka is a strength and NAMS certified nutrition coach at The Green Door Life. She can also be found wandering through the woods with her wolf dog, Lilu and mustang, Indi. Follow along with her adventures on instagram @ekaboo.button\n\nMaya DeLoche\n\nAERIALIST\n\nMaya’s passion is Circus and she specializes in Aerial Silks, Circeau (aerial hoop), and contortion with a background in Theatre Arts.\n\nAt an early age Maya discovered Circus and began training and eventually performing with Circus MeCCA in Mendocino CA, where she fell in love with all things Circus. She was able to expand her skills attending classes at Ecole National de Cirque in Montreal, and competing in Las Vegas VIVA Fest, where she took 3rd place in 2018 Emerging Artist Program.\n\nMaya enjoys building character and choreography such as she has done in previous tours with Flynn Creek Circus\n\nThis Summer marks Maya’s 4th tour traveling with the show.\n\nWhen she is not training or performing, she enjoys photography, learning about Auto Mechanics, and Off Road Adventures.\n\nMaya also teaches/coaches Aerial classes and is a Circus Mentor encouraging other young people to follow their dreams.\n\nJustin Therrien\n\nSWORD SWALLOWING & ILLUSION\n\nJustin Therrien arrived here with the Flynn Creek Circus by way of a long and squiggly path. He knew that he wanted to be in a circus one day and hasn’t really stopped holding on to that compass to direct him. He began with a juggling act but that wasn’t going to be the act that put him on the map. To set himself apart and stand out he took up the art of sword swallowing and other dangerous stunt tricks such as walking on broken glass, eating glass light bulbs, and pounding nails into his nose. Those skills took him to many amazing places but as you do in the circus you must keep moving. He started falling in love with the art of clowning, the refined skills of the mime, and the subtle beauty of magicians. He is particularly drawn to taking these skills that he has adopted and applying them to tell the story of his heart. The thing that brings him the most joy is sharing with the audience the magic of the circus.\n\nRoss Travis\n\nCHINESE POLE & COMEDY\n\nRoss Travis is an award winning Actor/Creator, Bouffon, Physical Comedian and Circus Performer (specializing in Chinese pole), who has studied with world renowned master pedagogues, including Dodi DiSanto, Giovanni Fusetti, Ronlin Foreman, Stephen Buescher, Dominik Wyss and Master Lu Yi.

She became pretty enchanted with the scene and as luck would have it the local circus was hiring one summer for a gal to run the ticket wagon. She became such gal and fell down the technicolor rabbit hole into the realm of Flynn Creek Circus. She was taught to spin on a rope, tally the attendees, and take no shit. She danced dumb, she swung big, she started throwing chairs from her teeth and sweated as knives flew by. She fell off the stage while trapped in a balloon and has been referred to as the “best chicken.” She learned to treat a show as a living thing. She learned from the best.\n\nHer life became a circus as she traveled with other tented shows and theaters and in 2022 she and three friends bought a circus tent of their own!\n\nThe very tent she first told a Fairytale…\n\nThis will be her eighth season with Flynn Creek Circus.\n\nYou can join her on the road by following @shoestringcircus and @freckleglitz.\n\nAvery Cluff\n\nSAND PAINTING & AERIAL ARTS–\n\nAvery has been climbing things since before she could walk, so it’s no surprise she fell in love with aerial arts early on. She grew up in Oakland, CA and after a childhood rotating through gymnastics, ballet, and circus she eventually joined the Circus Spire program at Kinetic Arts Center. There she trained a baseline of acrobatics, contortion, handbalancing, juggling, and physical theatre but never got over her love for being in the air. Through shows, cabarets, street fairs and gigs she performed a variety of conventional and invented apparatuses while specializing in solo and duo static trapeze.\n\nOver the past few years, she shifted her pursuit of heights to an interest in climbing. After several beautiful seasons working as a guide in Maine, she climbed and camped her way across the country in her little green van before settling back in Santa Cruz. Since, she’s rediscovered her love for the circus; teaching and performing with Cirque Tumble Cheer in Capitola. She’s gotten back into performing through showcases, festivals, and gigs but is overjoyed to be part of a cast again, and working with Flynn Creek for the first time!\n\nEdward Robinson\n\nART AND REPAIR\n\nAs soon as Ed got his driver’s license he ran away with the circus to be a clown.\n\nAfter working his way up to Producing Clown at Great American Circus, they shuttered and he spent several years ‘Framing up’ new shows, Canvas bossing and Clowning at Circuses all over the country.\n\nAfter a couple seasons Managing a Sideshow unit with a Freak Animal Zoo and a ‘Xoma the Monkey Boy’ show he shifted to the Renaissance Fair Circuit and spent almost 30 years entertaining crowds by swallowing swords, eating fire and doing disturbing things with an ice-pick.\n\nWorking on the Grounds Crews and in Fair Management he helped build, Performed at and Managed some of the largest fairs in the country until a serious sword swallowing slip caused him to rethink his career choices.\n\nHe then combined his entertainment and engineering skills and started building Combat Robots to compete with on shows like BattleBots and Robotica in Hollywood, Robot Wars in London and King of Bots in China. He’s the guy with the Shark Robots.\n\nWhen the world shut down he moved to the California High desert to enjoy the life of a true hermit. Fully off-grid and isolated from mankind & modern life.\n\nAfter 3 years in the desert he has now returned to his first love, The Circus, and uses his mechanical & engineering skills to keep the wheels rolling, the lights burning and the music jamming.\n\nDmytro Chernyavski\n\nPARKOUR ACROBAT – COACH – STUNTMAN\n\nDmytro ‘Dima’ is a 26 years old parkour athlete from Ukraine.

Originally from North Carolina, Jon has been traveling all his life which now fuels his sense for adventure.\n\nNow a self-proclaimed Roustabout with several shows under his belt, he doesn’t plan on stopping anytime soon. While he is not a stage performer, he enjoys working hard to keep the wheels of the circus “turning”. His passions include learning new skills and pushing himself to the limit. He takes great pride in overcoming seemingly impossible obstacles.\n\n.\n\nJocelyn Olum\n\nCIRCUS MENTORS APPRENTICESHIP -AERIALIST\n\nThe first word that Jocelyn ever spoke was “up,” and her love of the air has continued into adulthood. She was born in Boston, MA; she has trained at the San Diego Circus Center and performed with Tempos Contemporary Circus in Portland, OR. Jocelyn is an acrobat, a learner, a writer, and a lover of living. She swims, she cooks, she dances. This is her first time performing with the Flynn Creek Circus!\n\nEgon Dugas\n\nCIRCUS MENTORS APPRENTICE AWARDEE -PARKOUR ACROBAT\n\nEgon Zap Dugas fell in love with parkour when he was nine years old through YouTube videos and watching Legolas the elf from the Lord of The Rings movies. To him, it was the coolest thing a person could do. However, Egon never believed he could learn to do the tricks he watched online. To him, those athletes were somehow different from him. Actually, he did once make an attempt to learn. He still vividly remembers the experience of trying to backflip, alone on his backyard trampoline: the feeling of landing on his head, the crunch of his spine, the stars that filled his vision, the sensation of being unable to move for a few seconds, and the terror that he had broken his neck. In fact, his neck was fine, but he did not try again. It was clear to him that parkour was only a thing for special people… so, for the next nine years, parkour faded to the back of his mind, and Egon did other things. He learned Dungeons & Dragons, got into LARPING, and played more traditional sports like volleyball and soccer. It wasn’t until he was eighteen years old that parkour crossed his path again.\n\nHis family was gifted a trampoline, and as he played on it for the first time, his mom (an ex-cheerleader) suggested that he try a backflip. After laughing and informing her that his blood would be on her hands, he gave it a shot and landed it on his second try.\n\nA lightbulb winked on somewhere in his brain.\n\nThe moment he realized that he could learn parkour, it became his obsession. He has trained nearly every day since. Now, at 21 years old, when Egon is not in school, he is traveling around the country, training with other athletes, living his childhood dream.\n\nEgon was introduced to the world of circus by his girlfriend Jocelyn, and he is thrilled to be performing for the first time with Flynn Creek Circus!\n\nLorynne Machado and Matthew Bagshaw\n\n<\n\nLORYNNE MACHADO- LIZARD\n\nLorynne (she/her) is an acrobat from Vancouver Canada; specializing in hand to hand, partner acrobatics, and group acrobatics. She has a passion for learning new things, being tossed high in the air, and being upside down. With a background in theatre and acting she enjoys having the opportunity to bring a character to life. “Small and chaotic. More energy than sense.” -Matt\n\nMATTHEW BAGSHAW- LIZARD\n\nJumping straight in, Matt ports people and spins left. More so he bases Hand to hand, banquine, and Russian Bar and cradle. The spinning left? Well this is what started it all, it was what took him away from one obscure job choice into another – the cyr wheel. Cyr quickly became an obsession, drowning out other hobbies almost overnight. The dizzies, the crushed fingers, the countless times being tossed on the ground by this cruel piece of metal, mental fatigue and physical pain.. worth it. Cyr showed Matt new places of the world and opened different doors, one such door was hand to hand.\n\nWhile cyr wheel is cold and cuel, hand to hand is warm and cruel. Cruel as in with cyr if you make a mistake you will fall and the wheel will try to come crashing down onto your head, with hand to hand you make a mistake and your flyer tries to come crashing down onto your head, but then asks you if you’re ok? But atlast he’s done it, He’s ran away and joined the circus!\n\nAnna Minakova\n\nANNA MINAKOVA- general aerial acrobat\n\nAnna started her sport career at the age of 5. Her first sport was rhythmic gymnastics, which she pursued for about 5 years. Later, she ventured into sport ballroom dancing, participating in city and international competitions. Seeking more, Anna transitioned to cheerleading. With her team, she traveled nationally and internationally for performances. After her competitive career ended in 2016, she joined a dance-circus show as a universal dancer and aerial gymnast on the hoop. Anna has performed across Ukraine and Europe for 6 years. Now a resident of the USA , she is happy to start performing here..\n\nFlynn Creek Circus ‘DESERT MYTH’ is created, directed and choreographed by Blaze Birge and the Flynn Creek Circus cast."
