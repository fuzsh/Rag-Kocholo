        "text": "GOODLAD brings a memorable shopping experience to the North Shore in a unique retail concept located across from the Sea Bus Terminal\n\nThis summer, North Vancouver had an exciting addition to the neighbourhood. Right across the street from the Sea Bus Terminal, next to Lonsdale Quay, a one-of-a-kind retail space opened in the form of GOODLAD Coffee, Clothing, and Cut. The innovative shop has now opened its doors.\n\nThe talent behind GOODLAD is the creative trio of Shane Meier (Clothing), Christopher Glenn (Cut) and Mike Hong (Coffee). This project brought to life their idea of combining men’s clothing, barbering, and coffee under one roof for a heightened retail experience. Their collective love of entrepreneurship and passion for people, paired with their extensive business experience, is a recipe for success for the spacious shop, located at the intersection at Chesterfield and 221 Esplanade in North Vancouver. It’s the perfect stop for sea bus commuters, residents and tourists alike.\n\nWanting to create a ‘stand-out shop’, the team spared no expense for the interior design of the space, which took over six months to complete. Well-known and highly respected Cutler Design is delivering a concept that will create a memorable experience that clients won’t want to leave.\n\nLIGHTS… CAMERA…\n\nThe man behind the concept is Shane Meier, who was a busy child actor with memorable roles that include Clint Eastwood’s son in the Oscar-winning film ‘Unforgiven’, Young Macgyver on TV’s ‘MacGyver’, and roles in Steven King’s ‘Needful Things’, ‘Andre,’ ‘The Matthew Shepard Story’, and countless more local and US network shows over the years. Having spent a number of years working in Los Angeles, Shane wanted to bring a unique men’s shopping experience that he had enjoyed during his travels, back to Vancouver. With Shane’s talent, Mike’s marketing background and Chris’ creativity as a marketing & design artist, this collaboration has the ability to leave customers in awe of the design and services offered. Adding the barbershop and coffee shop to the clothing concept was a ‘no brainer’. Men want quality service quickly, so to be able to buy clothes, grab a drink and get a shave all in less than an hour makes for a pleasurable experience.\n\nLOCATION, LOCATION, LOCATION\n\nAfter spending over six months looking in North Vancouver for a location, the team finally found the perfect space. They got lucky with the location, which is just a 30-second walk from Lonsdale Quay and located directly across the street from the movie theater.\n\nCLOTHING:\n\nPartnering with Brooklyn Clothing’s Jason Overbo and Howard Clothing’s Chris Martin, Shane is bringing their high-end men’s denim fashion brands and personal service to the North Shore. GOODLAD is able to carry brands that other shops can’t as they have built strong relationships with vendors going back 15 years. Dressing men from head to toe, GOODLAD carries men’s denim, outerwear, boots, t-shirts, sweaters, hoodies, socks, underwear, shorts and endless apothecary.\n\nHigh-end American, Canadian and European-made denim anchors the collections. Bigger brands include AG, Nudie, Kato, Canada Goose, Barbour, with smaller local brands like 18 Waits, Outclass, Viberg Boots and Vancouver’s own Reigning Champ and Wings and Horns to round out the brands that will keep men looking good and coming back for more.\n\nAs GOODLAD is a small “owner operated” shop, chances are you will have Shane helping you in your clothing search. The partners attend trade shows in New York and LA twice a year, continuously searching for the newest trends.\n\nCOFFEE:\n\nGOODLAD Coffee is a happening place as commuters can grab a cup of coffee and bite to eat as they travel to and from Vancouver. Conveniently located at the front of the shop for commuters running to catch the Sea Bus, it’s a quick stop and you’re on your way.\n\nTheir coffee brewer is local West End Roaster, so a cup of that paired with a tasty item from the menu, and you are ready to start or end your day. Featured items include Bullet Coffee – a high-octane blend of espresso, grass-fed butter, coconut oil, and pure MCT oil.\n\nA must-try is the Spicy Chorizo English Muffin, combining egg, Havarti cheese, fire-roasted corn, and spicy chorizo sausage. Grilled and served hot!\n\nCUT:\n\nGOODLAD offers traditional men’s cuts with modern techniques and style. Christopher Glenn sums up his experience as a barber, saying: “It is all about the client, their needs and nothing to do with trends or fads. GOODLAD follows the 60/ 40 rule – 60% cut, 40% experience. Our clients aren’t after a quick cut or an in and out astrosphere – they come to us for advice, community, an effortlessly cool vibe and experience that they really can’t get elsewhere. They’re our clients, not customers and we look after them as such.”\n\nGOODLAD services include Hair Cut, Shave, Buzz Cut, Beard Trim, Wash Blow-Dry & Style, and Cleanup.\n\n“Oh man, how cool is this concept? We love that we are bringing something very different to the clothing, barbering & coffee experience to North Vancouver. Honestly we couldn’t think of a cooler city! The people are so friendly and so cool, they’re going to really dig this,” says Chris.\n\nShane, Chris and Mike are looking forward to bringing their enthusiasm, entrepreneurial spirit and vision to the North Shore. They invite everyone to visit this unique shopping/service concept in an electric atmosphere.\n\nGOODLAD is located at 221 Esplanade at Chesterfield in North Vancouver.\n\nHours: Saturday to Wednesday: 10:00 a.m. to 6:00 p.m.\n\nThursday and Friday: 10:00 a.m. – 9:00 p.m. Call GOODLAD at 604-971-3939\n\nFor press inquiries, more information, interviews, and photos, please contact:\n\nLesley Diana | Lesley@thepromotionpeople.ca | 604-726-5575\n\nFind Goodlad on social media:\n\nWebsite: www.goodladclothing.com\n\nTwitter: @GoodladClothing\n\nInstagram: @Goodladclothing\n\nFacebook: @GoodLadClothing\n\nMEDIA RELEASE\n\nBellMedia.ca/PR/TV/Discovery/\n\nTwitter.com/DiscoveryCanada\n\nWicked Weather and Wild Wrecks: The Elite Rescue Teams of Original Canadian Hit Series HIGHWAY THRU HELL Return to Discovery for Season 7, Sept. 4\n\n– Discovery’s most-watched series HIGHWAY THRU HELL delivers 17 all-new action-packed episodes, more than any previous season –\n\n–Previous seasons now available for streaming on the Discovery GOapp, Discovery.ca, and CraveTV–\n\n– Toyota returns as the exclusive automotive sponsor for HIGHWAY THRU HELL Season 7 –\n\n– Discovery’s first-ever Facebook Live aftershow with series star Jamie Davis streams Sept. 4 at 11 p.m. ET, immediately following the season premiere –\n\nClick HERE for a sneak peek at the all-new season of Discovery’s HIGHWAY THRU HELL\n\nTo tweet this release: https://bmpr.ca/2KRQc6L\n\nVancouver, BC– Battling massive mudslides, whiteout snowstorms, torrential rain, or dangerous rockslides, the highway heroes of Discovery’s most-watched original Canadian series HIGHWAY THRU HELL are set to return for Season 7 with an unprecedented 17 action-packed episodes, more than ever before!

After years of keeping the highways open with some of the most modern heavy wreckers – the legendary tow man is staking his future on old iron equipment.\n\nAt Davis’ yard in Hope, B.C., Classic Holmes tow trucks – some nearly half a century old – are slowly replacing newer, costlier wreckers. For Davis, the vintage trucks are more than just a passion– they represent survival. Under pressure to reduce costs and stay competitive, Davis is confident this winter he and his crew can tackle some of the toughest jobs – on and off the Coquihalla Highway – using an aging, rebuilt fleet.\n\nThis winter season, Davis is counting on one truck more than any other – the “Mighty Mo”. After rolling out of his garage at the end of last winter, the beautifully restored Holmes 850, named after a World War II battleship, is ready for war. Known as the most powerful tow truck of its day, the hulking 40-ton wrecker will need to shoulder the biggest jobs as Davis prepares to sell his last modern truck.\n\nAfter a challenging first winter working the mountain passes, former prairie operator Colin McLean is back in Hope for more adventures as Davis’ lead driver. But having run some of the best top-of-the-line hydraulic trucks, Davis’ “old iron” is going to take some getting used to.\n\nEach one-hour episode follows the Jamie Davis Motor Truck team as well as their competitors – Quiring Towing, Mission Towing, Aggressive Towing, and Reliable Towing –as they brave the harsh conditions of the Coquihalla Highway. Ready to navigate extreme roads and weather, each team prepares to put themselves on the line in order to keep some of the most economically important and traveled trucking routes in North America open and accessible for all.\n\nHIGHWAY THRU HELL is produced by Great Pacific Media in association with Discovery Canada.

At fifteen, Sofia is releasing her debut album entitled ‘Butterfly’ on August 24thon all platforms: iTunes, Apple Music, Spotify, Amazon, Google Play, and more!\n\nSofia Evangelina is a rising young Canadian teen pop singer who is bringing a collection of iconic songs, which is a perfect blend of historical resonance and pop modernity, to her debut album ‘Butterfly’. Bryant Olender who has worked with Michael Bublé produced the aspiring pop princess magical debut album. Interweaving elements of R&B, soul, gospel, and pop, her forthcoming releases are a collection of covers and originals showcasing her vocal ranges and newly found passion for songwriting.\n\nThe debut album compiles some of Sofia’s favorite covers that showcase her evolving voice, handling different vocal and musical styles in a completely unconventional way. ‘Butterfly’ is the first extension of her soul, to be shared with the world. She has drawn songs from some of her favorite artists: Beyoncé, Etta James, and Nina Simone. These powerhouse voices have changed Sofia’s perception of how her voice will forever evolve. Sofia was also inspired by some soulful old hits from Lionel Richie, Bill Withers and Stevie Wonder, Moody Singing and the youthful bops of Jackson 5 by adding her touch of sparkle and modernity.\n\nFrom the very early days, Sofia was a natural born performer full of boundless energy. Putting on her mom’s mascara and lipstick and cutting her scarves to create her own funky “designs”, she would spend hours performing in front of a mirror and later, entertaining random audiences. “I have fallen for music since day one,” Sofia explained. “I can just remember hearing and seeing music everywhere as if it followed me. No matter where I went, I felt the rhythm and a beat. I told my mother “it paralyzed me” – for the silly lack of better words at age five!”\n\nGrowing up in Calgary, Sofia attended an art-centered school. She won an award entitled ‘the closest to the core of arts’ and enthralled the audience into repeat standing ovations. She won several National talent competitions including Canada’s “National Overall Talent Awards” at Talent INC 2014, Canada TeenFest, The Mics and many others. She has also appeared at various festivals throughout North America.\n\nMany of her fans don’t know that this talented singer-songwriter is an accomplished freestyle skier who has been the youngest to compete at the World Cup circuit in her discipline. It was freestyle skiing that led her to travel the world and observe cultures and people. This experience formed her perspective on youth and global problems and has opened her eyes to identify the trends, narratives of society, and finding raw emotions.\n\nSofia has a first-hand, deep understanding of the issues and the trends pertaining to youth culture. Through her music, Sofia hopes to inspire her fellow peers and encourage them to embrace their individuality, develop self-esteem, stand up for what is right and embrace their inner beauty. Working painstakingly on her vocals and mastering her craft with prominent Canadian songwriters, Sofia is on an upward trajectory to becoming the voice of her generation.\n\nSofia translates all of her powerful experiences she lived through and her overflowing passion into her song’s lyrics. Her skiing and striving to achieve personal-best attitude, together with traveling the world – has helped to shape her vision and character and had led her to evolve into someone who with her music – now, can help to empower the world.\n\n‘Butterfly’ is being released on August 24thon all platforms and more information can be found on her website www.sofiaevangelina.com\n\nSofia Evangelina is available for interviews, appearance, and photos upon request.\n\nPress please contact:\n\nLesley Diana | Lesley@thepromotionpeople.ca| 604-726-5575\n\nSOCIAL MEDIA LINKS:\n\nWebsite: www.sofiaevangelina.com\n\nInstagram@sofiaevangelinaxoxo\n\nFacebook page: @sofiaevangelinaxoxo\n\nTwitter: @sofiaevaxo\n\nListen to Butterfly: https://www.sofiaevangelina.com/media/\n\nYOUTUBE channel:\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UC_up6S731hUOWyVKn3dwXow?view_as=subscriber\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-0GANKSI2I\n\nWhat are they saying about Sofia Evangelina?\n\n“At such a young age Sofia has an incredible voice with a matching persona to perform and such determination I haven’t seen in anyone since I worked with Michael Buble”. ~Bryant Olender, Producer\n\n“Sofia is a powerhouse of talent, energy, and excitement! We have had the pleasure of working with her in her development over the past several years and we can tell you that she delights every single person he meets. She is more than a singer, actor or dancer she is an allover, all-out, full-out, non- stop performer who never disappoints” ~John Stevens and Doug Sloan | Owners, Talent INC Canada\n\n“A powerful and commanding voice for someone so young. With her passion, determination and positive attitude, superstardom is imminent.” ~ Beverly Delich-Silver Lining Management, Vancouver, BC\n\nMembers’ films will be screening at Vancity Theatre from September 7th to 9th\n\nVancouver, August 13, 2018 – The Directors Guild of Canada British Columbia (DGC BC), is pleased to announce an exciting new event for the film industry: The First Annual DGC BC Directors Guild of Canada B.C.

Most of all, it honours the great masters of cinematography—unsung heroes whose vision and talent was always right before our eyes. Legendary cinematographers including Vittorio Storaro, Roger Deakins, Gordon Willis, and John Seale share their stories and some of cinema’s most memorable images.\n\nBye Bye Blues\n\nDirector Anne Wheeler’s most famous and honoured film is a delicate, upbeat and unapologetic World War II romance set to the music of a Prairie swing band. When her husband is transferred to Singapore, Daisy (Rebecca Jenkins) is deposited back home in Alberta with their two kids and an old piano. In need of work, Daisy starts playing with a local dance band. Photographed by Vic Sarin, this is an evocative, finely tuned romance.\n\nBackbone: Vancouver Experimental Cinema 1967-1981\n\nCelebrating artistic innovation in Vancouver from 1967 to 1981, this documentary follows a period when Canada was an international hub for experimental film. Vancouver artists, on Canada’s west coast, had a particularly dynamic scene that inspired an enduring body of work that resonates today. Featuring Alex MacKenzie, Dr Ron Burnett, Colin Browne, Stan Fox and Peg Campbell.\n\nHaida Gwaii: On the Edge of the World\n\nIf you have never visited Haida Gwaii then this is a great place to start. Charles Wilkinson’s stunning cinematography vividly captures the raw beauty of this very special part of the world. It is also, of course, a battlefield, though Wilkinson finds reasons to hope that First Nations’ long-view of environmental sustainability can prevail over short-term economic interest. Audience Award winner: VIFF\n\nTank Girl\n\nDecades before Fury Road, Lori Petty’s shaven headed Tank Girl waged post-apocalyptic rebellion in this film maudit based on the cult British comic book. Director Rachel Talalay (now of Dr Who fame) went all out in her determination to make “the ultimate grrrl movie”, only to suffer unkindly cuts from the studio brass. But even then, there’s nothing quite like this big, brash feminist action fantasy. Ice T plays a mutant kangaroo. Bjork, Joan Jett, and Devo mix it up on the soundtrack.\n\nEve and the Firehorse\n\nIn Julia Kwan’s award-winning first feature Eve is a precocious 9-year-old girl with a wild imagination growing up in a traditional Chinese immigrant family in Vancouver. Confucian doctrines, superstition and divine visions abound. When Buddhism and Catholicism are thrown into the mix, life for Eve and her 11-year-old sister escalates into a fantasia of catastrophe, sainthood and social confusion. “One of the most enchanting and memorable films made in this country.” Jennie Punter, Globe & Mail\n\nOn Putin’s Blacklist\n\nWonder how adoption became mixed up with human rights and US election conspiracies? Boris Ivanov’s lucid but enraging documentary is a depressing portrait of Russia today, where propaganda and demonization of the “other” result in institutionalized racism and homophobia, and innocent orphans are caught up in a cultural Cold War.\n\nDGC BC Showcase: Short Films Program\n\nThe Wolf Who Came to Dinner: Bea Barkley is an eight-year-old horror fanatic with a serious problem: her mom’s brought her new boyfriend home to meet the family, and no-one but Bea seems to notice he’s a werewolf.\n\nThe Money Pet: After his mutt accidentally eats some loose change, a man is soon bewildered to discover that his furry companion has passed the currency with compounded interest.\n\nGrave Decisions: not available\n\nCrazy Late: Jimmy Smith wakes up 5 minutes late for his own wedding with 4 blocks between him and the rest of his life.\n\nIn the Deep: Jodi’s mother passed away five years ago, and since then, her father has pretty well stopped living himself. Arriving unannounced on his doorstep one day, with shattering news of her own, Jodi is determined to make the most of the time they have left.\n\nThe Directors Guild of Canada, B.C.

Ronnie got caught up in the drama of working on a TV series that encouraged drinking and partying for ratings, resulting in longtime relationships unraveling, and her drinking being exposed to up the ratings. Since the show wrapped, her marriage has dissolved, like many of the housewives on the popular TV series brand. The statistics of the number of the ‘Housewives’ cast members who have been divorced is shocking. Sadly, Ronnie is one of the statistics. It hasn’t been easy for her, as she says she was married to her ‘best friend’, but that all dissolved after the show ended.\n\nRonnie is now willing to share her private struggle, which played out publically on television, by opening up about overcoming her issues with alcohol and the breakup of her marriage.\n\nSober for three years and turning 50 in September, Ronnie is using this milestone to spread an important message to her: that no matter what they have been through, there is always a way to turn your life around in a positive way. Her lifestyle has significantly improved since she has stopped drinking, and she is hoping to help others accomplish the same. Using herself as an example, Ronnie talks to groups and shares her story on social media to women and men around the world. As the Vancouver Housewives series has aired in countries ranging from England to Australia, her fan base is global, and she has been sharing her help and experience worldwide.\n\nAs a lifelong advocate of health and wellness, Ronnie encourages others to incorporate proper nutrition and exercise into their lifestyles. An icon of natural beauty, Ronnie is collaborating to launch Ronnie Negus-endorsed supplements.\n\nRonnie has a passion for home décor and fashion. She has renovated and designed a number of homes, including her current waterfront home on the shores of the Pacific in West Vancouver.

After the first cast reading of the script, she was rendered speechless. The show’s talented creator and executive producer, Stephen Tolkin, told Camille, “I wrote this role for you.”\n\nIn the recurring role of Esperanza, Camille plays a crazy, hip, alcoholic mother who is in recovery at a chic rehab center for celebrities. Esperanza tries to mend her relationship with her daughter, played by Paula Patton, all while dallying with one of the male nurses at the center, certainly making it an interesting role to play.\n\nIn stark contrast, Camille recently finished a lovely guest-starring role, playing refined Mrs. Fontleroy, on SyFy Channel’s Van Helsing. She appears in the episode entitled “I Awake”, directed by executive producer Michael Nankin, with whom she previously worked with on Caprica.\n\nAlthough acting is her first love, after her son was grown, Camille embraced filmmaking with her first short film, A Mother’s Love. The short won her Canada’s Crazy 8s Film Competition and numerous accolades at festivals around the world, including the Madrid International Film Festival, Manhattan Film Festival and London’s Best Drama Award at the SuperShorts International Film Festival.\n\nA year later, Camille couldn’t pass up the opportunity to pursue her Master’s degree in Production and Feature Film, when she received a scholarship to Screenwriting at Loyola Marymount University’s School of Film and Television in Los Angeles. “I was the oldest person in the classroom with over thirty years experience in the industry. The profs didn’t really know what to do with me,” says Camille. She quickly proved her talent transcended from in front of the lens, to behind it as well, with Camille winning the Best Shorts Film Competition and 2016 Award of Merit for her second short film, By the Fountain, which also screened at the 2016 New York City International Film Festival, the 2016 People’s Film Festival of Harlem, and at the 2016 Marche du Film in Cannes with Camille in attendance.\n\nCamille has garnered extraordinary acclaim for her versatility onstage and onscreen. Perhaps best known on television for her Leo Award nominated role portraying tough-talking Sheriff Nancy Adams on the CW’s hit television show Smallville for five seasons, she also appeared onstage as a leading lady at the Stratford and Shaw festivals, where she was hailed her as “a gift to the theater” by the London Times.\n\nCamille won Canada’s Jessie Award for her portrayal of Ariel in Shakespeare’s “The Tempest” opposite Gordon Pinsent and was also nominated for Best Actress Awards for Blanche in “A Streetcar Named Desire,” Madame Tourvel in “Les Liaisons Dangereuses,” and Elizabeth in “The Crucible.”\n\nBorn in Santa Monica to Hollywood star Cameron Mitchell and Viennese actress Camille Janclaire, Camille was raised in Vancouver, Canada, and studied at the Royal Central School of Speech and Drama in London, England.\n\nCamille is available for interviews and photos upon request.\n\nPlease contact: Lesley Diana | Lesley@thepromotionpeople.ca | 604-726-5575\n\nCamille Mitchell Demo Reel\n\nCamille Mitchell IMDb\n\nSomewhere Between IMDb"
