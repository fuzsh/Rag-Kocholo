Backbone will also be included in Game Pass for both Xbox and PC at launch (June 8th for Win10 so assumedly Game Pass for PC at that time).\n\nConsole backers of the Kickstarter are getting PC keys in the meantime:\n\nNintendo Switch, Playstation and Xbox releases are coming later this year. To all our console backers, we will send Steam / GOG keys for PC release on June 8.\n\nFurry Disco Elysium, sounds interesting. Wonder if it'll have full VA or just purely text? ðŸ‘€\n\nPurely text, they hit the stretchgoal for voice acting but it looks like the scope of it was too big.\n\nPurely text, they hit the stretchgoal for voice acting but it looks like the scope of it was too big.\n\nFingers crossed for a voice-over deluxe edition down the road then. Either way, I'll still enjoy this ostensibly meaty plot.\n\nPurely text, they hit the stretchgoal for voice acting but it looks like the scope of it was too big.\n\nOh, that means I'll definitely wait. For some reason that bothers me more than I thought.\n\nPlaying Monkey Island 1 with VA recently made me realize how I just can't go back to \"text only\" anymore for Point and Click.\n\nPost-noir isn't a thing. Noir isn't a time period, even if your instincts tell you that it is.\n\nRock, punk and hardcore aren't time periods but we still have post-rock, post-punk and post-hardcore.\n\nRock, punk and hardcore aren't time periods but we still have post-rock, post-punk and post-hardcore.\n\nYeah but Neo-Noir has been the term used since the 1970s. No one calls it post-noir.\n\nYeah but Neo-Noir has been the term used since the 1970s. No one calls it post-noir.\n\nI get that, I was just being overly pedantic :p"
