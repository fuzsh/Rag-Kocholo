        "text": "Mark Bonnen graduated from Angleton High School in 1986 with honors, and if you asked his teachers and peers, Bonnen was likely to head for a career in journalism. He was the obvious choice to receive the AHS Senior Newspaper Award for his work throughout high school interviewing and writing stories on top state government officials about the changes to education in the 1980s. He was not afraid to go after a story and to take the time to follow it through to the end. Bonnen’s strong work ethic has always driven him to be successful and to challenge himself. After high school, Bonnen attended Texas A&M University, and he found that his path led him not toward a future in journalism but instead in an almost completely different direction. He graduated in 1991 with two degrees, one in physics and one in philosophy. He embraced both, finding fascinating connections between such things as quantum theory, relativity and the philosophy of science. After working as a physicist for a while, Bonnen decided he really wanted to pursue a career where he could help people, and he chose to get his medical degree, graduating from the University of Texas Health Science in Houston in 1999. He completed his internship in 2000 at Baylor College of Medicine and his residency at the University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center in Houston. Bonnen’s combined his interest in medicine and physics led him into radiation oncology, and he found a way to serve his community through his work. He soon started helping residents at the Brazosport Regional Cancer Center in Lake Jackson, and he also founded South Texas Radiation Therapy Associates. Bonnen became a sought-after oncologist specialist, and he was recruited as program director of the Radiation Oncology Residency Program at Baylor College of Medicine in 2013, where he is helping to train the next generation of radiation oncologists. Today, he is chairman of the Radiation Oncology Department at Baylor in the world-renowned Texas Medical Center. Bonnen is at the forefront of technology and advancements in his field. Entrusted with the early development of the department, Bonnen has led his faculty and staff in significant growth and development in academic and clinical work. He has redesigned residency physics, radiation biology and clinical didactics courses, and he has created radiation oncology fellowships as well as attained millions in national competitive grants. At the same time, Bonnen has published research on the use of radiation therapy in several types of cancer, and he has presented at multiple national and international scholarly conferences. Because of his research, the use of radiation therapy is more pointed so that it is most effective with the least possible side effects. Bonnen’s reputation as a highly skilled doctor has spread as much as his reputation for being an extremely compassionate professional. In fact, Bonnen is widely praised for his compassion. People are known to seek his expertise and advice, whether they are his patients or not, and Bonnen will help them locate specialists and help them understand their treatments and procedures. No matter how busy he is, Bonnen is there for those who seek his help, visiting people in the hospital and sitting with families in waiting rooms at surgery centers. Bonnen’s blend of skill, knowledge, dedication and compassion saves lives and makes him a model physician, caregiver and educator in the medical world.\n\nGraduating Angleton High School in 1993, Chris Heatherly knew he wanted to make his mark in interactive communications although at the time few even understood what that field was. For Heatherly, who was a creative and “out-of-the-box” thinker, that meant exploring how the new technology of the time would change the way the world communicated in the future. That path started at AHS as a student in journalism where he started working as a freshman on a brand new machine that would change his life—a Macintosh computer. By the time he was a senior at AHS, Heatherly had twice been presented Tops in Texas awards in computer graphics, and he won national awards in page design. As the school newspaper editor his junior and senior years, his work was noted not only locally but around the state, and the Tattler was ranked in the top 15 school newspapers in Texas. Building on his passion for journalism, Heatherly’s path to the future led him to the University of Texas journalism program, where he continued to hone his computer skills. While at UT, he also worked at Apple Computer and later Power Computing to put himself through college. His strong and ever-growing background in computers led Heatherly to a career in the early days of the web and e-commerce worlds. He was hired by the world-renowned company Frog Design in California, where he helped start the company’s interactive division and founded its strategy group. As chief strategist, he worked with a variety of clients from startups to Fortune 500 brands, and he worked on a variety of design work from physical product to brand overhauls to internet software. His clients included Target, Ford, Real Networks, Macromedia and Nike. While at Frog, Heatherly began working with Disney on an innovative project to develop a line of kid’s consumer electronics. Seeing his tremendous gift in computers and strong work ethic, Disney soon hired him to launch their kid’s electronics business, and Heatherly built that into a global business. He went on to found Toymorrow, Disney’s innovative project focused on the emergent confluence of digital and physical play, creating everything from a real, flying Tinkerbell to a scale-working robot Wall-E to the first toys that interacted with the iPad. It was clear how vital Heatherly was to Disney, and in 2008 he became the vice president/general manager for the company’s toy business, overseeing $3 billion in domestic wholesale sales and all of Disney’s toy lines, including Disney Princesses and Pixar’s Cars. Heatherly even worked closely with the Pixar creative team on the toy lines for Toy Story 3 and Cars 2, and he has worked with every major toy company, expanding relationships with global partners such as Mattel, Hasbro, Lego, Hallmark and Crayola. Additionally, in his time at Disney’s Consumer Products division, Heatherly oversaw product innovation, holding 46 patents in areas of consumer electronics and software. In 2011, Heatherly returned to the digital world as the Vice President of Production and Marketing for Disney’s Interactive Worlds business, and three years later he was promoted to Senior Vice President of Disney’s Social Kids business, where he oversaw the company’s kid’s games and kids-safe social systems. In 2016, Heatherly made a career move, leaving Disney and moving to NBC Universal as their Executive Vice President of Games and Digital Platforms. He now oversees all games on mobile, console, PC and emerging platforms such as VR and AR. This includes work on NBC (SNC, Fallon, American Ninja Warrior); Universal (Jurassic World, Fast & Furious); Dreamworks (Trolls, Shrek); TV Animator (Voltron, Troll Hunters); and Cable (Mr. Robot, Battlestar Galatica). With more than 20 years of experience, Heatherly has become a well-respected and accomplished veteran in the interactive entertainment and consumer technology industry, and he continues to be a visionary and world-wide leader in the games and digital world where he influences and inspires entertainment that is enjoyed by millions around the world.\n\nIn 1981, Cal McNeill graduated from Angleton High School, where he was known by everyone for his outgoing personality and ability to make strong friendships. He was also known to be a leader on and off the field as an active member of the Wildcat football team and Student Council president for two years. McNeill left Angleton to attend Texas A&M University, where he walked on to the Aggie football team. After graduating from the university in 1985, he started a career in banking. He has worked with many prestigious Texas banks in and around the Bryan and College Station area, and he currently serves as Executive Vice President of the The Bank & Trust of Bryan/College Station since 2009. McNeill believes that people should take care of one another and should give back to their community. Putting his words into action, he has been a fixture in his community, serving in various roles in several charitable and community organizations. He is the current president of the Texas A&M University Association of Former Students, and he was very active in the Bryan/College Station Chamber of Commerce for many years, acting in various leadership roles including chairman. He was also a member of the College Station ISD Education Foundation from 2004 to 2016, serving as president from 2010 to 2012. Continuing his role as a community leader, McNeill has served in the past as president of the Brazos County A&M Club and as treasurer for five years of the College Station Tiger Club, where he is still an active member today. Additionally, he has served on the Brazos Valley Research Partnership Leadership Council since 2010, and he has also served on several other boards and organizations such as the Children’s Miracle Network, Boys and Girls Club, and Better Business Bureau, just to name a few. Since he was young, McNeill has loved sports. Since 1992, he has worked his way up to officiating football at college games, and after 2009 he started officiating in the Big XII Conference and is currently officiating in the Mountain West Conference. With his constant service mentality, McNeill has also actively sought leadership opportunities in the sports arena. He has been a member of the Texas Association of Sports Officials, serving on the state board of directors for the organization, and he was a board member for the Brazos Valley Sports Foundation as well the Bryan North Little League in past years. From volunteer to president, McNeill’s resume is filled with a multitude of activities that show his commitment to serving his community, but his giving does not stop with the years of service he has given to his community. When a former coworker told McNeill that her husband was in desperate need of a kidney, McNeill did not hesitate to step up again. He immediately applied to be a donor, and in 2017 McNeill gave a friend new life by donating a kidney. McNeill has led a life dedicated to serving his community and to helping others. His life has been filled with examples of charitable undertakings and literal life-saving good deeds that continue to show the community and future generations that a life driven to serve is a life filled with purpose and endless accomplishment.\n\nCatherine Munson Foster, “The Ghost Lady” of Brazoria County, graduated from Angleton High School in 1925. Her love of writing started early. She attended the College of Industrial Arts, now Texas Woman’s University, where she earned a journalism degree in 1929, and she continued her journalistic path writing for the Fort Worth Record-Telegram and later the Houston Press. In 1944, Foster returned to Brazoria County and began writing for the Angleton Times. While still writing a regular column for the Angleton Times, Foster became a librarian at the Brazoria County Library, and she retired from the library after 16 years of service. Foster loved to tell stories, in particular stories that could make a person shiver in spooky delight, but her stories were always rooted in local history. Because of her love of storytelling and history, she became The Ghost Lady and the preserver of classic Brazoria County ghost stories, blending reality with a little folklore as a writer. Her most notable work, Ghosts Along the Brazos, recounts 14 stories of ghosts in Brazoria County. Through her book, countless children and adults would learn about Brit Bailey, the early settler who still searches for his jug of whiskey by lantern light—Bailey’s Light. People would listen with breath held as she recounted how The Lady in the Gray Taffeta Dress was murdered in the Sweeny House and later haunted the house, slowly gliding down the stairs with her skirt rustling with each ghostly step. Foster also helped to write and edit other books rooted in the rich history of the area, including A Narrative History of Brazoria County as well as a pictorial history and a cookbook of historic recipes. Furthermore, she was instrumental in the formation of the Brazoria County Historical Museum. While she did so much to preserve history, she was equally known for educating others about that history, especially its ghostly side. It was in her storytelling where Foster really shined. For decades, Foster shared her tales with the community, giving special readings of her book at schools throughout the county. Even after she retired in 1970, she continued to visit schools. Three generations of students knew The Ghost Lady and were captivated by her visits to their schools. Foster died at the age of 86 in 1995. To honor her legacy, the Brazoria County Historical Association created the Catherine Munson Foster Memorial Award for literature, which is awarded annually. Her tales live on in her book that the can still be purchased through the Brazoria County Museum. She was a master storyteller who loved what she did, which as she self-proclaimed was being “the sort of person who scares little children.” And, it was through her apparitions and her ghostly tales that she was able to make a lasting impact on her community, preserving a special part of Brazoria County history and cementing her forever as The Ghost Lady.\n\nCol. Laura Knapp graduated from AHS in 1990, but even right before graduating she was not exactly sure where her collegiate path was directed. Knapp accepted a scholarship to at-tend Rice University, but when the principal called her to the office in May with an ac-ceptance letter from West Point, her direction shifted to a military path, a path she has never strayed from since. In 1990, she made history as the first woman from Brazoria County to at-tend West Point, and she graduated from the prestigious military academy and was commis-sioned as a Military Intelligence Officer in 1994. Knapp found herself moving up the ranks of leadership. She served as a tactical intelligence officer and platoon leader during assignments with the 2nd Infantry Division (Republic of Korea) and 1st Cavalry Division (Ft. Hood, Texas) as lieutenant, and later she served as assistant Brigade S-2 for the 2nd Infantry Brigade (Strike) and as commander of D Company, 311th Military Intelligence Battalion, 101st Airborne Division. She assumed command in Operation Enduring Freedom I and deployed the company again for Operation Iraqi Freedom I. In 2005, she became the 309th Military Intelligence Battalion Opera-tions Officer in Fort Huachuca, Arizona. After graduating from Air Com-mand and Staff College with a Bachelor of Science degree and a Master of Military Arts degree, she transitioned to the 743rd Military Intelligence Bat-talion in Aurora, Colorado, serving as NSA Colorado Operations Officer and later as Battalion Executive Officer. In 2010, Knapp reported to the XVIII Airborne Corps and served as the Corps Analysis and Control Ele-ment Chief and the XVIII Airborne Corps Commander’s Initiative Group Chief. Knapp excelled in her role as a military leader, especially in helping soldiers learn and grow. In 2012, she took command again of the 309th Mil-itary Intelligence Battalion and held the post until 2014. As bat-talion commander of the 309th, she trained the Army’s counter-intelligence and human intelli-gence collectors to prepare them for initial assignments in the operational force. Knapp has worked hard helping the Army strengthen its programs. Following her command of the 309th, she completed the Army War Col-lege National Security Agen- fending cyberspace intelligence from infiltration is currently in pilot by the U.S. Army Intelligence and Security Command in four Army Service Component Commands. One of Knapp’s strengths is her ability to further the development and capabilities of her team. For her, it is important to encourage, coach and mentor her soldiers. Knapp has even gone so far as to aid one of her privates in achieving his own higher education goal by gaining admittance into her alma mater, West Point. She helped him with his application, SATs and admission interviews. For her success comes when her soldiers do well or accomplish great feats. However, Knapp has been successful in her own right and continues to move up in rank. In 2015, Knapp served for 10 months as the Director for the Office of the Chief of Military Intelligence, and she was the ideal candidate in 2016 to take over the Army’s 504th Military Intelligence Brigade located in Fort Hood. With her strong leadership skills and varied career experiences as well as her growing achievements, Knapp again made history by becoming the 504th’s first female Military Intelligence Brigade Commander. In addition, she is a decorated officer, receiving the Bronze Star Medal, Afghanistan Service Ribbon, and Iraq Service Ribbon to name just a few. Excelling to the rank of U.S. Army Colonel, Knapp has proven herself a strong military leader, leaving a significant impact in the area of military intelligence as well as leading troops in day-to-day operations and in combat. Her willingness to push beyond boundaries also extends into her personal life where she has completed three IRONMAN challenges testing her physical toughness and mental strength. For Knapp, family is very important as well. She is blessed with an amazing family including her mother Deborah Knapp, sister Susannah Ferguson, brother Alex Knapp, and nephews Belsey and Jack. Since October 2017, Knapp has been overseas in Afghanistan leading her troops in current missions. The 504th Military Intelligence Brigade is the Afghanistan Theater Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance Task Force known as Task Force Ready. Knapp remains a role model for all with her strong spirit and resounding character, and she is a pillar of honor lighting the way for both men and women in today’s military.\n\nAfter graduating from Angleton High School in 1951, Emma Lou O’Bannon never knew she would become an Angleton legend. She has been a mainstay in the community for decades although many in the community may not even recognize her name. That’s because most people know her simply as “Miss Emmy” from the library. O’Bannon went to work for the Brazoria County Library in 1976 as a cataloger. It was there that her love for children and storytelling would collide. The librarian at the time Catherine Munson Foster (yes, one of the other inductees) asked her to have a children’s storytelling time, and history was made. She loved it because she could share her love of books and reading with those who needed their imaginations to soar most of all, the children. After the Angleton branch of the library opened in 1979, O’Bannon officially became the children’s specialist at the library. She was the first children’s librarian the Angleton library branch had, which is a title she held until her retirement in 2017. For years she made stories and characters come alive for countless children who gathered for her special story time readings. But, O’Bannon did more for the library than just read. She helped the library financially, often modeling in fundraising style shows to garner support. She even gave her own money to support the library and to continue bringing the joy of reading to others. A few years after her first story time, her husband and she donated $1,000 for new children’s books. O’Bannon always looked for ways to make the library and her story time better. She diligently planned her Summer Reading Program every year and even visited local libraries on vacations to get ideas and inspiration. For decades, O’Bannon has offered monthly and even weekly programs for toddlers, local day cares, older children, and local schools. The children at Central Elementary, formerly ECC, would travel across the street to the library once a month for more than 30 years to hear O’Bannon read stories. Teachers at Central Elementary credit her with helping to inspire a love of reading in more than 500,000 students from the campus. O’Bannon just wanted to share her love of reading with as many children as possible. It helped that she had a stylish flare. For her, story time was a chance to entertain children. She loved dressing up to fit whatever program she had and to be on theme with her books. It was not unusual to see O’Bannon dressed as a pirate or a clown while at work. But, her signature garments were always her hats. If she was out and about, it was most likely her hat that you noticed first. While she might have drawn in her crowds of listeners with her creative hats, they stayed because of her enchanting tales. It was her creative accents, gestures and characterizations that made her story time magical. For O’Bannon, being a librarian was not a job; it was a passion, a passion that has touched the hearts of hundreds of thousands of children in this community for many generations. When one of her children, no matter how old, opens a book still, a piece of Miss Emmy will always be with them.\n\nAlbert Korenek graduated from Angleton High School in 1948 and earned an athletic scholarship to play football at the University of Houston. While in college, Korenek was part of the Naval Reserves and left for active duty in Washington D.C. immediately after graduation. He played one season on the Washington D.C. Main Navy football team. In 1953, he returned to Texas and began night school graduate courses at UH. It is in graduate school that he found his love of both trees and machinery. For an assignment, Korenek “dug” into his childhood farming background to study a tree service company that hand dug and transplanted large trees all over Texas. He saw the possibility of growing large trees locally as opposed to hauling them from other states. He started planting trees in his spare time and soon discovered the most difficult part was digging and handling the huge ball of tree roots and dirt. This led him to start building a model of his dream tree digger. In 1965, Korenek perfected his design of the Texas Tree Shovel, the first fully hydraulic tree transplanting spade. Several manufacturers were interested in how he successfully transplanted large pecan trees that had 100 percent livability. He soon signed a contract to build and sell a version of his tree digger and received a patent in 1968. He simultaneously was running his own successful company, Instant Shade Trees, Inc., and was growing thousands of oak trees. Still, Korenek was making a name for himself for his expertise in hydraulic tree digging. That reputation led him to save two 250-year-old live oak trees at the state capital in 1987. Officials wanted to relocate the trees instead of bulldozing them, and they turned to Korenek for help. Although the trees were embedded in limestone and trees that large had never been moved before, Korenek developed equipment to successfully transport and save them. Three years later, he again successfully moved the 425,000-pound Twin Oaks at the state capital, earning him praise from the Texas House of Representatives who passed a resolution commending him. Once again in 1990, his expertise was called upon when he was given the honor of digging up and personally transporting the National Christmas Tree from New Mexico to Washington D.C., hauling a 60-foot live blue spruce across three mountain ranges and six states. Korenek also worked on what others considered “impossible” projects and saved large trees at Texas A&M and Space Center Houston. Korenek has had patents issued in five countries, and all hydraulic tree spades manufactured today derive their basic concept from his original patent, which contributed to the creation of a new industry. For more than 25 years, Korenek improved and refined tree digging equipment that has saved beautiful, mature trees instead of bulldozing them. Impressively, 98 percent of the thousands of trees that Korenek has moved are still living today. Korenek has dedicated his life to preserving trees of past generations for future generations, gaining world-wide respect for his work.\n\nAfter graduating from Angleton High School in 1977, Michael Ramos found that music would be his life’s passion and vocation. Music was a part of his life from an early age. Ramos came from a close-knit family that embraced music every day from different genres. When his family got an old, upright piano, music really clicked for Ramos, and he discovered the intricacies of music and how notes and rhythm intertwined. After graduating, Ramos pursued his music career in Austin, the live musical capital of the world. As part of the infamous Austin music scene, Ramos became a top recording session player, playing synthesizer, percussion and trumpet but specializing in keys/accordion. He soon began to gain the attention of national recording and touring acts and has had a very broad musical career, working with many legendary musicians from different musical genres. He became a permanent member of the band The BoDeans, who he was with for six years, and he toured and recorded with The Rembrandts, playing on their multi-platinum CD L.P. His strength as both a touring and studio musician also caught the eye of musician and singer-songwriter John Mellencamp, and Ramos did a long stint working with Mellencamp. Ramos also did a long stint with Los Lonely Boys and had notable studio appearances with Paul Simon. While working with his friend singer-song writer Patty Griffin, Ramos was inspired and encouraged to record his own music. He kept finding his way back to the Latin music that inspired him when he was growing up, but he wanted to combine his love of Latin music with his love of Rock. Ramos has received critically acclaimed review in the U.S. as well as abroad for his work, especially with his own projects and as front man of Charanga Cakewalk where he blends Latin, Afro-Cuban, Brazillian, funk, and soul music.

Stone graduated from Angleton High School in 1995 and attended Reed College in Portland, Oregon. After earning a Bachelor of Arts in Anthropology, Stone dedicated his life to community economic development, disaster recovery, and social justice. Stone’s early career included working with Latino entrepreneurs in Washington D.C. and serving as a Peace Corps volunteer in Mongolia, before returning to school to receive his Master of Public Administration from New York University. There he focused his academic work on international economic development, microfinance, and urbanization. While getting his Master’s, Stone worked at the NY-based nonprofit Seedco Financial where he designed and managed small business recovery programs after disasters such as Hurricane Katrina, the BP oil spill, and September 11th. During that time he developed and funded a $1 million Fisheries Assistance Center in Louisiana that brought together nine agencies to support commercial fishermen and rural entrepreneurs. In 2008, he took over as economic development project manager for Ecotrust Canada in Vancouver where he worked with Native-Canadian communities and commercial fishermen engaging in sustainable resource extraction. Subsequently, Stone started his own consultancy, Recovery and Relief Services, Inc., which works with local governments to prepare for, and respond to, economic shocks following disasters. Stone is currently a Doctoral candidate at the University of British Columbia working on issues involving gentrification and community disaster recovery. Stone’s dissertation research explores how African-American residents in New Orleans cope with displacement pressures when higher-income people buy properties in their neighborhoods, drive up rents, and take over commercial spaces. This research is being undertaken with community organizations and neighborhood partners who will use the results to empower neighborhood residents, preserve local culture, and improve the resilience of low-income families to social change. Stone also sits on several non-profit boards including Coastal Communities Consulting in southeast Louisiana, which works with Vietnamese- and Cambodian-American commercial fishing families, and the Eastside Community Fund in Vancouver, which funds microbusinesses engaged in survival trades like street vending and trash collection. In his spare time, Stone raises a six-year-old dynamo named Ellie and works on a certificate in Emergency Management at the Justice Institute of British Columbia. After growing up in a low-income family in Angleton, Stone sees his work as an opportunity to pass on the love and support that he has received from a variety of people and institutions throughout his life, and he hopes that this year’s graduates will be likewise inspired to improve the lives of our society’s most vulnerable residents.\n\nSenator Jimmy Phillips graduated from Angleton High School in 1929, raised by extended family and friends and helping to support himself after being orphaned at an early age.

In 1940 he was elected to the Texas House of Representatives for Brazoria County and was re-elected in 1942. However, at the height of World War II, Phillips made a courageous decision to resign as a state representative and to volunteer to become a private in the U.S. Army, where he served in military intelligence until 1946 and was honorably discharged at the rank of sergeant. Soon after being discharged, he turned his focus back to politics and was elected to the Texas Senate representing the 17th Senate District that included a wide representative area of Brazoria, Chambers, Fort Bend, Galveston, Matagorda, and Wharton counties. Phillips had a long tenure in the Texas Senate, serving from 1947 until 1963. He was respected in the Senate, and in 1953 fellow senators elected him to serve as President Pro Tem. In his career in the Texas Senate, Phillips was known as an ardent champion of the poor and underprivileged. He fought to improve the state hospital system, looking for ways to add charity beds for sick children. He also fought fiercely against any effort by the Legislature to raise college tuition, working hard to control the cost of tuition for state colleges. It was important to Phillips that state colleges grow for new students. Also, he was a strong defender of veterans and conducted a single-handed investigation of a major veterans land scandal during his time on the Senate’s General Investigating Committee. Outside of the Senate, Phillips was active in the American Legion and served as the Brazoria County chairman for the National Foundation for Infantile Paralysis in addition to starting the Brazoria County 100 Club that helps provide financial and emotional support for the surviving spouses, children and family members of officers who give their lives in the line of duty.

After giving needed treatment to several other men, he continued searching for wounded. He then suffered wounds to both legs, immobilizing his legs; however, Clarence continued to drag himself through the mud toward another injured soldier. He treated the soldier and encouraged others to crawl to safety. Once they were in safer conditions, Clarence treated wounded soldiers for another five hours until they were evacuated. Because of his extraordinary heroism, Specialist Fifth Class Clarence Sasser received the Medal of Honor, America’s highest military decoration. Clarence returned to Brazoria County, going to work for Dow Chemical, and in 1977 he began working for the Veteran Affairs office where he retired after 20 years. Clarence Sasser is considered one of “the bravest of the brave”.\n\nElizabeth Silverthorne graduated from Angleton High School in 1941.
