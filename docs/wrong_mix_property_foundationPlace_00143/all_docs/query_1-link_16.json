        "text": "We can help anyone add to that special celebration. It could be a corporate event, a reunion, a family get together or a birthday celebration. Any thing you have in mind\n\nWe have Polynesian Dancers, Bollywood, Belly Dancers, Samba, Ballet and Break Dancers. We can join your party and make it just a little more memorable. If kids are involved and want to learn the dances we can make that happen. Our dancers love teaching the youngsters. We also have face painting, balloon twisting, and other activities for the kids as well!\n\n4th of July will soon be here and we can bring some real excitement to the holiday. We have both family friendly and night life entertainment. Fire and LED performers always make a fantastic addition to Independence Day celebrations!\n\nWe pride ourselves on offering professional services and making your party all that you hoped for. We have the ability to provide video and photograph to capture all the fun your family and friends will have. Consider making us a part of your corporate event or family get together. You will not regret it.\n\nTake a look at photos from some of our past events!\n\nYou can hire Easter Bunnies and mascot characters at various companies in the PNW, but our performers are something special, and their energy and commitment to their characters are just not matched by anyone else! Any old Easter Bunny can sit in front of a back drop and take a photo, but our Bunnies truly get into character! They know that Easter Bunny, and mascots in general can sometimes be a little scary to the little ones, so all of our performers use their years of experience in physical comedy, dance, and the study of their various performance arts to make their Bunny characters approachable! I mean, seriously…. When was the last time you saw an Easter Bunny do the Fortnight dances? Or play practical jokes on the older kids? Our performers know how to perform for an array of ages! They know when to burst out with Energizer Bunny like energy, and when to calmly approach the littles and offer hugs to Mom and Dad to show the kids that there is nothing to be afraid of! Our Bunnies get all the laughs and really know how to make any event special!\n\nLast year we had the opportunity to visit a corporate event! Our Bunny not only spent time taking photos with the families, but he even challenged some of the older kids to video games! And when all the kids were gone and it was time to clean up, Bunny stayed around a little bit longer for a ridiculous photoshoot with the office staff!\n\nOur Easter Bunny is available to hire for all types of events! From photo-ops at company events! Or even a private backyard BBQ with friends and family! We can join your event for a quick “Telegram” style visit that lasts around 15 minutes, or Bunny can stay for hours, help with Easter Egg hunts, pose for photos, and play games with kids! We can customize your events in anyway that you imagine! We love bringing the magic of Easter alive for the little ones, and provide the comic relief the adults need after dealing with their sugar-high littles! Let our Bunny run the energy out of them with customized games, Bunny dance offs, and much much more! No one brings the magic like CG Entertainment!\n\nWe are so excited for the opportunity to celebrate Easter with all of our clients this year!\n\nCall us today to hire our Easter Bunny for your Spring-time event! 503-547-7760! Talk to you soon!\n\nIt's officially summer! And all of this sun is just one of the many reasons to celebrate this weekend because Portland and Seattle were jam packed with all types of events!\n\nWe kicked off Friday morning with three of our Polynesian dancers making an appearance at a Portland Gymnastics Camp in Beaverton for the third year in a row! The dancers performed a tribute to the Hawaiian Hula and a traditional Tahitian dance followed by an engaging, fun, and fact filled history lesson about Tahitian dance and a lesson wherein the older kids learned 7 basic Tahitian dance moves, and the younger ones choreograph their own Hula Dance that everyone performed together! After that the dancers headed across town to NE Portland to perform at a retirement community celebrating a summer Luau! The residence were captivated by both their tribute to the Hawaiian Hula, and multiple Tahitian choreographies, as well as a silk fan dance! But nothing could beat what came after the performance! What started out as taking photos with the residents and staff soon turned into a party of its own with group singing and sharing stories of days gone by, lots of hugs, and memories that will last a life time! On our way out, the event director took the time to come thank the dancers for their beautiful performances and for the time they took to make one-on-one connections with the residents! They told us they couldn’t wait to have us back for their Country Western themed party for which they will be hiring some of our Line Dancers and our Cowboy Comedian. They also want to have our Reptile Show out for one of their community enrichment events later this summer and we couldn't be more excited to celebrate and spend time with their residents again soon!\n\nSimultaneously, over in the Hollywood district two of our B-Boys (breakdancers) performed and taught at a Taekwondo Summer Camp! The kids, parents, and teachers loved them so much they invited us back to close out another summer camp they are hosting in August! Here is what the client had to say via email as we were shoring up our next event:\n\n“Just wanted to share my campers and our staff had so much fun yesterday! Thank you all so so much for coming. Looking forward to our next one.“ - Josh T.\n\nCheck out some photos we snapped at the event!\n\nSinging Telegrams and Character Impersonators are a great way to make any birthday celebration memorable! Not only do you get an engaging and beautiful performance from one of our endlessly talented vocalists and actors but it creates a fun (and often slightly embarrassing) opportunity to put your guest of honor in the limelight on their special day! We have many characters to choose from, from Marilyn Monroe to Sasquatch, a gorilla or monkey to a scary or silly clown! Generally, we can have your choice of any of our standard characters and songs but given enough time, we can create most any character that you’d like, learn and perform any song, or even create a custom parody song featuring personalized details you'd like for us to highlight in our performance!\n\nSaturday was another incredible day of celebration and performance of all kinds! We kicked off Saturday morning with a Polynesian dancer, a break dancer, and a fire dancer at a summer pool party for a Beaverton, Oregon based fitness club! The place was packed and everyone enjoyed our mashup performance!\n\nBy mid day two of our character impersonators were out! Our Woman of Wonder visited a fair in Aumsville, Oregon and enjoyed an afternoon of photos with families and entertaining the many community event attendees with action packed silliness!\n\nTake a look at some photos from our Woman of Wonder’s trip to Aumsville, OR!\n\nOur closing event of the evening was in Seattle, WA on Saturday evening! One of our Party Motivators and Line Party Dance Instructors joined our client Victoria for her 60th birthday where they danced into the night to classics like the Cupid Shuffle, Electric Slide, Footloose, and so much more! Our client wanted to be sure that everyone at her event would be engaged in dancing and there is no better way to keep the dance floor pumped than by hiring one of our Party Motivators! The client loved our dancer so much she asked her to extend her visit!\n\nWe are incredibly grateful for all of our clients and performers that bring magic to events all over Oregon and Washington!\n\nCall us today to book an event! 503-547-7760 or email us at bookings@cigientertainment.com\n\nTime to celebrate Summer! Wouldn’t having a beautiful and magical, real-life mermaid come visit your home for a backyard pool party be the perfect way to kickstart your summer? We have a new addition to CG Entertainment and her name is Mermaid Orielle, the most enchanting and rare creature to ever visit the shores of the PNW!\n\nShe also would make a wonderful addition to a HOA pool party, a summer corporate event, or even your daughter’s next birthday party! Orielle can perform on land or water but of course water is where she shines. On land she loves doing mermaid make-overs, story-time, and applying temporary glitter tattoos! In water she can play games like Marco Polo, Simon Says swimming addition, and much much more! Mermaid Orielle is full of fun ocean facts so not only will the experience be magical, it will be educational as well!\n\nDon’t forget we have many other services just to fit any occasion. Maybe you have a graduate heading off to college, wouldn’t it be fun to send them a singing telegram? Or have a flash mob perform a special dance for them. We would be very honored to help you with any type of event you have in mind. Just give us a call or send us an email and we can get the ball rolling."
