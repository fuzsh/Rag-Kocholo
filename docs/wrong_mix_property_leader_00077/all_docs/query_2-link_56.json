Art, our chancellor emeritus, maintains an office at Brown and participates in daily activities at the University, not the least of which is organizing the class of ’55’s 50th Reunion in 2005. Martha is planning to add the word emerita to her title following Commencement in order to pursue her archaeological work and publish her magnum opus. The Joukowskys live at 79 Prospect St., Providence 02906.\n\nJohn Lawson is in his fifth year back in Paris.

Peter Pemberton writes: “I retired in 1997, after thirty years managing a once- world-famous jewelry company headquartered in Providence. On Nov. 21, 1997, we were asked to vacate our offices and leave the building that same day to satisfy a financial consolidation dictated by the company’s new owners. The company has gone from $95 million to $25 million in six short years.”\n\nAl Phillips writes: “Since my early retirement because of heart problems as business manager of a General Motors facility in the Detroit area, my wife, Val Jean, and I have been significantly involved in a variety of volunteer activities. Particularly satisfying is my work with the American Heart Association and Mended Hearts, Inc. We travel extensively, including trips to South America, New Orleans, New England, and California.”\n\nFrom the September / October 2002 Issue\n\nRichard Wolfson has been elected chair of the Bristol (Mass.)

I continue to work there a few hours a week, but I spent the winter in San Diego, as I have for the past few years. My home continues to be in Cambridge, Mass., but there is a possibility I will migrate to San Diego one of these days.

At the library's annual meeting in April, Bob Kenny Jr. and Leslie Travis Wendel each received a William Williams Award for extraordinary support of the library. The award commemorates the efforts of William Williams, class of 1769, who sequestered the College library at his home in Wrentham, Mass., throughout the Revolutionary War. For the past six years Bob has volunteered at least three days a week, helping to manage the Anne S.K. Brown Military Collection, the largest collection of its kind in the world. Bob helps with exhibitions, events, greeting the public, and preserving and acquiring resources. He enjoyed a career in business and served in the U.S. Army, retiring with the rank of lieutenant colonel. His military interest brought him to the Anne S. K. Brown Memorial Lecture in 1993, where classmate Leslie Travis Wendel recruited him as a volunteer.\n\n\"Leslie was lauded for her many contributions as coordinator of the Friends of the Library, a position she held from 1991 until she retired in 1995. She lives in Chestertown, Md., with her husband, Dick. Leslie was director of communications and donor relations in Brown's development office from 1978 to 1986, where she helped launch a most successful library-campaign kickoff party - a luncheon and musical revue aboard the Royal Viking Sky. As coordinator of the Friends, she launched the Carberry Cookbook, the holiday-card catalog, and the \"Hunk of the Hay\" promotion, in which chunks of marble steps from the John Hay Library were sold to alumni. To date, more than 200 'hunks' have been sold, netting more than $2,300 for the library.\"\n\nIrwin Sydney, of Brookline, Mass., received the Ma'asim Tovim award for good deeds from the New England region of the Federation of Jewish Men's Clubs.

Gilbane III '99).\n\nFrom the November / December 1999 Issue\n\nJudith Thorsen Chusid writes: \"I have been president of PIC Consultants for approximately ten years. We provide human-resources consulting to companies, as well as career planning and personal marketing to executives, managers, and professionals. The company, based in Vancouver, B.C., has been in existence since 1975. Unlike at our previous company, which was based in Chicago, we find that many of our clients are immigrant professionals and managers. It seems that whatever is happening in the world, we see the effects of it in our office - from the Prague Spring and the beginning of the South African 'brain drain' in the 1970s to Ismailis from East Africa to clients who had been part of the Shah's court. We've also seen Polish professionals who left during the solidarity movement, Chinese academics who left after the Tiananmen Square massacre, and, most recently, we've seen the effects of the Serbian 'brain drain.' Connecting across the cultural divide with these people has been fascinating and challenging. Providing significant assistance to them has been even more of a challenge. On the personal side, our four kids are married, separated, or repartnered (or whatever the correct terminology is), and we have somewhere between eight and twelve grandchildren, depending on whether you count the partners' kids. With a few exceptions, I've been out of touch for a long time with my friends at Brown and would love to hear from you.\"\n\nFrom the May / June 1999 Issue\n\nDick DePattie, class treasurer, and Nancy Schuleen Helle, co-secretary, report an overwhelming response to the November class newsletter, both in news and dues!

Warren is the past executive director of the Indiana University Center on Philanthropy.\n\nArtemis Joukowsky and Finn Caspersen '63 joined to help the Lawrenceville School and the Peddie School, their respective prep schools, build a joint boathouse in West Windsor, N.J. The new three-bay boathouse, which was dedicated on Sept. 19, provides a home for the two schools' crew programs, which have been homeless for more than a decade.\n\nDave Zucconi (see Ben Ballard '42).\n\nFrom the November / December 1998 Issue\n\nJanet MacPhail Smith writes: \"A trip back to Brown in July with four of my grandchildren reminded me I need to bring my own and my husband's classmates up-to-date on our comings and goings. George '53 and I have been retired for six years. I taught for more than twenty years as an elementary special-needs teacher, despite having to live with multiple sclerosis for the past thirty years. We have managed a great dealing of traveling since retiring, including a safari in Africa and boating with polar bears in the Northwest Territories. George worked summers for the Woodrow Wilson Foundation from 1984 to 1992. He was part of a physics team that went to colleges and universities all over the country to give workshops to local high school teachers. After he retired, he was a consultant to a three-year high school physics teachers' National Science Foundation grant at the University of Massachusetts. We have a summer home in Eastham, Mass., and have been in touch recently with Nancy and Bob Carlson. We are thinking of downsizing to just one home on the Cape. After forty years in South Hadley, Mass., we are facing a difficult decision. We try to see Janice Kennedy Doctor every other year, and give Shirley Morse Richmond a call when we are in Pennsylvania.\"\n\nFrom the May / June 1998 Issue"
