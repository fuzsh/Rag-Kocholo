Anderson Papers Dates: 1911-1995 Extent: 424 items. Abstract: Papers, 1911-1995, of Henry Hill Anderson. Includes a variety of unbound logs, narratives, and journals as well as correspondence concerning Anderson’s voyage as a cabin boy from 1911 Nov-1912 on the bark FOOHNG SUEY, from New York to Hawaii. During this voyage around Cape Horn he records navigational data, what he learns from the many different men on board, and the death of one of the men at the hands of the cook, who later jumped overboard mid-ocean. The different documents all record the same events and voyage but are written at different times and not all are complete. Anderson made this voyage following his graduation from the Adirondack-Florida School and before matriculating at Yale University. The collection also contains an edited log from his son, Henry Hill Anderson, Jr.’s, voyage on the schooner GEORGE B. CLUETT and the steam vessel STRAHCONA from 1939 Jun 24-Sep 3 as part of the Tanner-Forbes geological expedition from Boston to Newfoundland and Labrador.
