        "text": "Although he scored the two first Batman films from Christopher Nolan's reboot, along with Hans Zimmer, he turned down the opportunity to score The Dark Knight Rises (2012), as he felt that Nolan and Zimmer make a better partnership than the three combined.\n\nI wish I had some great words of advice. The only advice I have ever been able to give anybody is to focus on writing music, and if you're writing a movie score particularly, don't worry about the picture. Just write great music and the rest will take care of itself."
