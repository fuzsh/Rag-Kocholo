        "text": "This is going to be a longer one. I am not used to reviewing music so I hope that I get the terminology right.\n\nI would like to focus on a couple of film scores by composer James Newton Howard. Especially some scores for movies directed by M. Night Shyamalan. I know Shyamalan’s movies are widely ridiculed and I mostly agree with the criticism directed at them. It is for that very reason that I would like to highlight the music written for them, because a film’s music tends to get buried under the general dismissal of a film as a whole. Film music is its own art form and can be regarded and experienced as separate from the film it is attached to. It deserves to be. The music is written for the film, yes, but the music in itself is capable of telling a story.\n\nOne thing I cannot abide is for a composer to put his/her heart and soul into the creation of a beautiful piece of music, only for that music to be attached to an absolute shit film and so losing the recognition for all the work and mastery that has gone into it.\n\nI will first say something about film scores in general and then about Howard’s early career leading up to his Shyamalan scores.\n\nAbout the nature and place of film scores\n\nLiking film scores is like fighting for the underdog sometimes. Composers are honored by the Oscars, yes, but that is a very flawed platform. Complete scores are sometimes written in haste or thrown in the waste bin during production. And since most composers use old and established techniques from the Romantic period of classical music, their film scores are often not seen as adding anything significant or innovative to the classical canon and therefore ignored from that angle. Add to that the free incorporation of any kind of rock, jazz, electronic or world music to their compositions to muddy the definitions, and it is easy to see that film scores sometimes just can’t seem to find their place, audience or recognition. I recommend the documentary Score: A Film Music Documentary (2017).\n\nThe structure of film scores is also not exactly what is traditionally found among classical music. A film score is made up, usually, of a handful of themes and leitmotifs that correlate to elements in the film, like a love theme, a danger theme, a theme for specific characters or a main theme for the franchise. The first cues introduce the themes for the first time. Then, throughout the “album” that is created from the material, the themes return in different variations and combinations, which can be very playful. The climax of the film often corresponds with a final iteration of the musical themes in their full power and glory, as if the themes like organisms grow fully into their own. The end credits music is often an encore or a selected suite of the themes.\n\nWhen regarding a film score, then, there are different moments on the album and different iterations of themes to notice. Sometimes individual cues stand alone. Sometimes an entire album is more than the sum of its parts.\n\nHoward’s early work\n\nJames Newton Howard made his name as a film composer in the 1990s. He scored a lot of comedic dramas that did not as yet display the gravity and artistic voice of his later work. Some early highlights of his career include Flatliners (1990), The Prince of Tides (1991) and Dave (1993). The tone of these scores is mostly charming and accessible, with occasional beautiful choral work. After that came a number of overwrought Kevin Costner films, Wyatt Earp (1994), Waterworld (1995) and The Postman (1997) which were stepping stone works for the composer. The cue “The Wedding” is a standout from Wyatt Earp.\n\nBefore getting into some Shyamalan scores of the early 2000s, I would like to highlight some of Howard’s scores concurrent to that same period. Snow Falling on Cedars (1999) has some of Howards best and most dramatic work, like the cue “Tarawa”. Howard experiments here with rhythms of motifs that would become a recognisable part of his style later on. The work Howard did for Disney animated movies in this time is outstanding. The three films Dinosaur (2000), Atlantis: The Lost Empire (2001) and Treasure Planet (2002) have some of his best work, but can be a bit loud and overblown at times. Try “The Egg Travels” and “Across the Desert” from Dinosaur and “The Crystal Chamber” from Atlantis.\n\nSigns (2002)\n\nNow we come to the scores written for M. Night Shyamalan. In a strange inverted trend, Shyamalan’s films became progressively worse, while Howards music for them became progressively better. His scores for The Sixth Sense (1999) and Unbreakable (2000) were very functional but unremarkable to listen to. Signs (2002) too, is not exactly a great pleasure to listen to in its entirety, as it is repetitive and minimalistic, but it is also very recognisable with a strong character of its own.\n\nThe score is dominated by progressions of a three-note motif that is a times upfront and unrelenting and at times hypnotic and uplifting, dependent on what the scenes needed. The “Main Titles” are a good example. This style of flowing progressions of motifs would become part of Howard’s future projects. It is remarkable how many different moods he can convey with them. “Baby Monitor” feels more mysterious and gentle while “Boarding up the House” dares some real optimism. Most of the score is filled with suspense, until the powerful “The Hand of Fate – Part 2” gives a release of redemption that feels truly amazing. A highlight of Howard’s career. Listen to “The Hand of fate – Part 1” as well before it for the complete arc of terror leading to redemption.\n\nThe Village (2004)\n\nThe music for this film evokes earlier pastoral times and sounds inspired by Vaughan Williams’ The Lark Ascending (1914). Howard makes heavy use of violin, piano and woodwind instruments to make beautiful, stretched-out melodies. The teenage violin sensation Hilary Hahn was brought in to give elegant and energetic performances of some of the most beautiful melodies of Howard’s career. Again, rhythms are used to build up tension throughout the score. “What Are You Asking Me” starts with a clear-eyed statement of the main theme and returns often in moments of affection in the film.\n\nThe strongest cue of the score is “The Gravel Road”, but moments of transcendent beauty dotter the album, such as 2 minutes into “Those We Don’t Speak Of” which also has a rare but beautiful sub-theme that comes back in “The Vote”, a superb track, and in the End Credits cue (which was not included for some mind-boggling reason but can be found with some searching online). The violin and woodwinds give a wistful and innocent sound that is contrasted against more violent and sudden outbursts of danger that mar the experience a bit. Still, this score is a strong contender for Howard’s best of his career.\n\nLady in the Water (2006)\n\nPerhaps my personal favourite. A fairytale approach worked best for this film, giving us cute, lullaby-like melodies (established in the “Prologue” cue). Sometimes they sound too sweet, but they are magical and near the end of the film truly majestic. What is brilliant here is that Howard uses pulsing rhythms to mimic water. The trickling of drops, the surging tides and ebb and flow of waves.\n\nA good example of this is the beautiful cue “Charades”, in which a rich palette of progressions and instruments weaves in and out of the soundscape, slowly building up to momentary statements of the main theme, as if breaching the surface of the water.\n\nThe climactic cue “The Great Eatlon” tells a whole epic story in itself. The story of the film has simple good vs evil ideas and both have their musical representations. The final struggle between good and evil is played out in this score, sometimes evil seems to win out, only before a majestic performance of the good themes overcomes it. Afterwards, the “End Titles” gives a calming piano melody to recover from this ordeal.\n\nThe Last Airbender (2010)\n\nThis is a very robust, muscular score, making full use of a large orchestra and is technically very accomplished. Although there are many heroic themes weaving in and out, none of them really stand out as an identity for the entire work, except maybe for a certain flowing theme for strings. The cue “Earthbenders” is a good clear introduction to some of the themes and texture of the score while a special “Airbender Suite” highlights some themes more than the rest of the album does.\n\nHoward gives us a really well balanced score that includes everything from airy woodwinds to grounded percussion. “Journey to the Northern Water Tribe” shows a joyful energy and “We Are Now The Gods” a touching majesty, but the music is restless, always changing into something new. The true highlight comes at the end of the album with “Flow Like Water” where Howard builds up the intensity to new highs and lets loose waves of melody.\n\nRecent work\n\nThose were some highlights from the middle part of Howard’s career that I wanted to put in the spotlight. I highly recommend anyone trying them out if you are interested in film music."
