        "text": "The market for blockbuster catalog deals has largely been driven by rights belonging to superstar artists and their estates, like Bruce Springsteen, Bob Dylan and David Bowie.\n\nBut copyrights belonging to composers for film and TV are big business, too.\n\nJust last month, UK-based Cutting Edge Music Holdings partnered with affiliates of London-based investment firm Blantyre Capital to acquire music publishing rights owned by composers who write music for film and TV â committing an initial $125 million to the strategy.\n\nNow, a new and very well funded player has entered the fold.\n\nMeet Multimedia Music, a London and Los Angeles-based firm that has just closed a major initial round of fundraising of more than $100 million.\n\nThe funding comes from Metropolitan Partners Group and Pinnacle Bank, and Multimedia Music says that it now plans to acquire catalogs of film and TV music rights from production companies, composers and other rights holders.\n\nMultimedia Music has also announced its very first catalog deal, and it includes rights in music from films that have made over $15 Billion at the Box Office.\n\nThe firm launches with an acquisition of the catalog of all music income and copyrights from what it calls, “one of the greatest film composers of recent times”, James Newton Howard, including the film and TV music scores forÂ Fantastic Beasts, the Hunger Games Trilogy, The Dark Knight, Maleficent, Raya and the Last Dragon, Snow White and the Huntsman, King Kong, I Am Legend, Blood Diamond, Runaway Bride, ER, Emily In ParisÂ andÂ Pretty Woman.\n\nJames Newton Howard’s career spans over 30 years and encompasses more than 140 film and television projects.\n\nHe is a 9-time Oscar nominee, and Emmy and Grammy winner.
