        "text": "James Newton Howard in the late 1990's\n\n\"Composing is a natural fit. As far as the creative process goes, I'd rather do this than anything else, by far. Something different happened to me when I started to write music to images. It was a feeling of excitement and connection and a sense of being in the right place that I never had before.\"\n\n- James Newton Howard in 2000\n\nBorn in 1951, James Newton Howard's youth was rooted in the study of classical music. With a grandmother who performed the violin with the Pittsburgh Symphony, Howard began lessons on the piano that would eventually culminate in a classical education at Santa Barbara's Music Academy of the West (with Reginald Stewart and Leon Fleischer) and at the USC School of Music. Though always fond of orchestral strings, Howard was drawn into the world of pop rock during the 1960's and 1970's. After performing keyboards with the Southern California band \"Mama Lion\" in the early 70's, Howard produced a few solo albums featuring the advancing technologies of Yamaha keyboards. It was during that time that Howard made a living as a session keyboard artist, often programming synthesizers for the likes of Diana Ross, Carly Simon, Ringo Starr, and others.\n\nSeeking a lucrative career with his talents, Howard expanded his name for publicity purposes to include the full James Newton Howard, partly because it sounded more distinguished and partly because there was already a James Howard in the industry (which causes problems when registering with a professional guild). In the mid-1970's, Howard was contacted by Elton John, and he soon became John's regular keyboardist. The collaboration included album performances through 1981, and eventually included a tour with John in 1986. While on tour, Howard began experimenting with other career avenues. He produced recordings for Cher and Valerie Carter, which led to similar deals with everyone from Barbara Streisand to Randy Newman. Howard had the opportunity to orchestrate and conduct Elton John's live performance in Australia. He became acquinted with the popular rock band Toto, fresh off of their cult score for Dune, and Howard's music is performed by Toto members to this day. His knack for superior string arrangements led to recordings for which he orchestrated and conducted the London Symphony Orchestra.\n\nIt was then, in the mid-1980's, that Howard stumbled upon film scoring. His first score was for Head Office in 1986, and while the films he composed for over the next five years were extremely forgettable, Howard's name was beginning to filter to very well known Hollywood directors. His career skyrocketed in 1991, when he was nominated for an Academy Award for The Prince of Tides and also successfully scored Man in the Moon and Grand Canyon. He expanded his work to television, scoring many popular themes. His Emmy nominated theme for E.R. in 1994 has since given him a comfortable financial situation, earning him royalties for each episode. He has won and been nominated for other Emmys and Grammys, and has received Academy Award nominations for The Fugitive, My Best Friend's Wedding, and The Village as well as several songs. Howard's ongoing collaborations feature well-chronicled admiration from directors Ivan Reitman, Kevin Costner, and Lawrence Kasdan. He remains one of the versatile composers in Hollywood today, collaborating with Hans Zimmer in the 2000's to popular results. Residing in the Los Angeles area with his wife and two sons, Howard is a proud dog owner.\n\nFILMOGRAPHY & REVIEWS AT FILMTRACKS\n\n(see legend below for abbreviations and codes)\n\nTitleFR VRVT RD TRDates Notes2023:The Hunger Games: The Ballad of Songbirds & Snakes***2.80177|||2,036Pain Hustlers (co-wrote)2022:Fantastic Beasts: The Secrets of Dumbledore****3.71303|||||1,9492021:Jungle Cruise****3.75252||||1,981Raya and the Last Dragon***3.20250|||1,9912020:News of the World (AW)***3.23208|||2,0622019:A Hidden Life****3.49261||1,9882018:Fantastic Beasts: The Crimes of Grindelwald****3.79514||||1,653The Nutcracker and the Four Realms****3.57351|||1,785Red Sparrow***3.25266|||1,7132017:Roman J.
