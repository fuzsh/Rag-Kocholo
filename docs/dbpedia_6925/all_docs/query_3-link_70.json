James Newton Howardâ€™s career spans over thirty years. He has composed music for over 120 films, including the Academy Award-nominated scores for Defiance, Michael Clayton, The Village, The Fugitive, The Prince of Tides, and My Best Friendâ€™s Wedding, and Academy Award-nominated songs for Junior and One Fine Day. James also received Golden Globe nominations for his massive orchestral score for Peter Jacksonâ€™s blockbuster remake of King Kong, his provocative symphonic score for Defiance, and his songs from Junior and One Fine Day.\n\nOur Big Dreamers can learn so much from Evaâ€™s interview with James. For instance, James famously wrote 3 hours of music for King Kong in just 5 weeks. It takes an incredible work ethic and dedication to pull off such a feat on a tight deadline. James also shares the importance of teamwork and all the incredibly talented people involved in a major Hollywood production. As we often say, you canâ€™t accomplish your Big Dreams alone. And James shares that even after his prolific 30+ year career in Hollywood, he is still striving to improve his craft with each and every project. Big Dreamers donâ€™t believe in perfection and are always looking to grow. There are so many nuggets to be learned! Enjoy the interview ðŸ™‚\n\nWHAT YOUâ€™LL LEARN\n\nThe interesting (and unexpected) story of how James started his career in film composing.\n\nJames explains the analogy of how composing his music is just like his wifeâ€™s cooking.\n\nJamesâ€™ experience on writing music for the movie King Kong, where he only had 5 weeks to write nearly 3 hours of music.\n\nJamesâ€™ thoughts on deadlines and why he thinks theyâ€™re important.\n\nJames shares just how big of a team effort it is to put together a movieâ€™s soundtrack.\n\nWhy people tend to take the music/soundtrack of a movie for granted.\n\nWhy James wants to work on the Fantastic Beasts movies (Eva loves the Fantastic Beast series so was super excited to learn he scored the films!).\n\nWhat drives James to keep composing for movies, and how he strives to always become better.\n\nJamesâ€™ advice to his 10-year old self.\n\nHow James overcome his fears and doubts.\n\nJamesâ€™ Big Dream for the future.\n\nAnd so much more!\n\nRESOURCES\n\nJames Newton Howardâ€™s Website\n\n>> Get Evaâ€™s Free Confidence Secrets Course Here <<\n\nIf you are a long-time listener, you know that we are working on a course that we are going to launch in 2019 called the Dream Big Academy.
