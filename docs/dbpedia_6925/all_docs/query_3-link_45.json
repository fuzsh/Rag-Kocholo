        "text": "“Collateral” by James Newton Howard, Antonio Pinto, Tom Rothrock, Various Artists\n\nMichael Mann’s Collateral is a troubled rag rug of a score, with composer’s duties allegedly split up among nine different people. While James Newton Howard has been the one to walk away with the official credit, Brazilian film score composer Antonio Pinto and also musician/producer Tom Rothrock contributed easily as many musical cues as Howard. However, with the recent release of a Special Collection by Intrada’s this matter has been ended once and for all and Collateral is now officially being considered a James Newton Howard score. Despite that circumstance I’ve decided to keep my custom covers (#2, #3) fairly nonspecific. So no matter what release you…\n\nLost Covers, Vol. 2\n\nHQCovers recently surpassed 100000 views and I thought I’d take this opportunity to have a little resume and see where I’m from, where I’m at and where I’m going. The Past I started creating soundtrack covers in 2006 after I bought the iPod Video, the first one to handle cover artworks. High quality scans were a rarity back then, so I began making them myself in glorious 500×500 pixels! And because I’m a kind person I shared them via the now defunct Amazon customer image galleries. Some of them are still online, for example here’s a nice one that shows my early typewriting skills. After some time I had a…\n\n“Nightcrawler” by James Newton Howard\n\nI love the fact that James Newton Howard can write scores like Maleficent and Nightcrawler within the same year. Compare the lush and romantic beauty of the former with the strange yet oddly efficient combination of electronica and woodwinds of the latter and you couldn’t go further apart. This one wasn’t on my to-do list at all, but once the original artwork (#1) popped up on the net, I changed my mind all of a sudden. Who wouldn’t want to have a picture full of awesomeness on his website? This series started off fairly easy with a custom cover based on the official…\n\n“Maleficent” by James Newton Howard\n\nI‘m back from my summer hiatus with kind of a surprise. If not for you, then at least for me. Because I didn’t expect to feature James Newton Howard’s Maleficent on my site at all. This one totally came out of the blue. I’ve already heard rumors that it may be the next big thing among film-score-enthusiasts, but I when I gave it a spin for myself, I was downright blown away! Two spins later I was already looking for source images and, just like this score keeps getting better and better, my custom cover series kept growing bigger and bigger. The…"
