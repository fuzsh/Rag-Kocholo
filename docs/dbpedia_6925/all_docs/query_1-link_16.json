        "text": "A PERSONAL REFLECTION ON JAMES NEWTON-HOWARD\n\nJames Newton-Howard is a very pleasant man with an aura relaxed competence. He is someone you would like to work with and who you would trust to do a really good job.\n\nJames Newton-Howard is a devotee of computer technology and uses it to compose, to create demos and to write his notation for the live musicians a pencil gives my hand a cramp. Back in the early days of the technology, he created for Yamaha the first demonstration pieces with their innovative keyboard.\n\nHis own studio is not the usual jumble of equipment in a snakepit of cables, but a beautiful setting in which to work. (see photos below)\n\nI had written a lot of instrumental music, but until you become a film composer, you don't know what the word 'productive' means. You work 60 or 70 hours a week to create six or seven minutes of music. It's a whole new ballgame.\n\nHe starts every day full of confidence and by the end of the day he feels discouraged because the expectations are so daunting. Fear is always a companion and a necessity.\n\nNewton-Howards movie scores have successfully encompassed every genre, but he is probably best known for the scores he has done for Disney animated features, because the music is such a noticeably important element in them.\n\nFor Treasure Planet a retelling of the classic novel in an outer space setting, he knew a symphonic score that would remind the audience of the swashbuckling movies of old would best link together the outer space setting with the classic story.\n\nA Disney animated feature is often five years in production, and the first step is to compose the main themes and demo them for a committee, after which the score and movie are developed together.\n\nNewton-Howard says of writing for animated features, You have to be shameless about writing funny music. You must resist overwriting in an animated movie. and do not hit everything with the music. I use subtle changes in the tonality for transitions.\n\nJames Newton-Howard is a good friend of other composers. He and Hans Zimmer exchanged libraries of samples from their own work and when something is used by the other, a royalty is paid.\n\nLike almost all composers, James Newton-Howard hates coming on a job where there is already a temp score, and like many movie composers, he hates most of all temp scores made from his own music. Composers do not like to be hired to repeat themselves any more than they like being hired to copy someone elses music.\n\nWhen you meet James Newton-Howard he very much fits his role of husband, father of two young sons, and owner of people-friendly a yellow labrador. Hes a man youd like for your neighbor, your colleague, and a composer of music for your movies.\n\nJAMES NEWTON-HOWARD BIOGRAPHY\n\nJames Newton Howard was born on June 9, 1951. His grandmother was a classical violinist and concertmaster of the prestigious Pittsburgh Symphony during the 1930s and '40s, when women concertmasters were very rare indeed. She began giving her grandson James piano lessons when he was four.\n\nJames Newton Howard studied classical music, majoring in performance piano, at the USC School of Music, and at Santa Barbara's Music Academy of the West with Leon Fleischer and Reginald Stewart.\n\nHe particularly liked composing for strings which later gave him the chance to orchestrate and conduct recordings with the London Symphony.\n\nTypically for a young American musician, James Newton-Howard was attracted to pop and rock and roll, in which he achieved significant success in association with such top names as Elton John, beginning in 1974 as Johns keyboardist. He rejoined Elton John in 1986 as the conductor/orchestrator for Live in Australia with the Melbourne Symphony.\n\nJames Newton-Howard has co-written and/or produced recordings, including those by Valerie Carter, Cher, Randy Newman, Rickie Lee Jones, Chaka Khan, Jude Cole and the Brothers Johnson. He has arranged music for Earth, Wind and Fire, Barbara Streisand, Dwight Twilly, and Bob Seger.\n\nHis first movie score was Head Office in 1985 and he has been constantly writing scores every since. In 2002, he scored four major movies in four entirely different genre! His best known collaboration has been with Disney for whom he scored the animated features Treasure Planet, Atlantis and Dinosaur.\n\nJAMES NEWTON-HOWARD FILMOGRAPHY AND AWARDS\n\n\\Dreamcatcher (2003)\n\nBig Trouble (2002)\n\nThe Emperor's Club (2002)\n\nSigns (2002)\n\nTreasure Planet (2002)\n\nWho Shot Victor Fox?
