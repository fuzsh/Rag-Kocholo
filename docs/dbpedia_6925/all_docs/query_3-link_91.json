        "text": "One of the most versatile and respected composers working in film, James Newton Howard's career spans over thirty-five years. He has composed music for over 140 films, including multiple Academy Award-nominated scores and songs. His success reflects the experiences of a rich musical past, completing his formal music education with orchestration study under legendary arranger Marty Paich. Though he was classically trained, he maintained a strong interest in rock and pop music and collaborated with some of popâ€™s biggest names, including Elton John; Crosby, Stills & Nash, Barbra Streisand; Earth, Wind and Fire, Bob Seger; Rod Stewart; Toto; Glenn Frey; Diana Ross; Carly Simon; Olivia Newton-John; Randy Newman; Rickie Lee Jones; and Chaka Khan. It was until 1985 when he was offered his first film, Head Office, and he quickly knew he had found his calling. Since then, he has scored films such as Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them, all four installments of The Hunger Games, King Kong, The Dark Knight, Signs, Peter Pan, The Sixth Sense and News Of The World."
