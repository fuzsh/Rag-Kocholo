        "text": "As the world prepares to dive back into the wizarding world that produced Harry Potter and his memorable friends, interest in the franchise is back at an all-time high. The actors starring in the first of five new films have been promoting the project heavily, and fans have been talking about the upcoming series for months. While this new movie may take place in the same world as Potter, and the book the film is based on comes from J.K. Rowling, those behind the scenes apparently want to make Fantastic Beasts stand on its own as a great cinematic experience, and that requires some excellent music.\n\nLegendary composer James Newton Howard stepped up to take on the task of scoring the film, which turned out to be an extensive, involved process. The nine-time Oscar nominee and Emmy and Grammy winner spoke to me about his process, his favorite scores and what his kids thought when they found out he was to be a part of the same universe as Harry, Hermione and Ron.\n\nWatch On FORBES:\n\nHugh McIntyre: Fantastic Beasts is a spinoff franchise, and it's already a huge deal. Harry Potter is an entire world on its own, and it has millions of diehard fans. Were you at all nervous to join a project that so many people were going to watch so carefully?\n\nJames Newton Howard: Absolutely. I was very nervous. Well, I don't know if nervous is quite the word. I think to do anything out of one's comfort zone, there has to be some aspect of it that feels inspiring and challenging in a positive way. Sure, the fear of failure is always a companion in my work, and for a lot of other people. I was very excited by it. I felt fairly confident, without trying to sound self-congratulatory. I think I understood the world, I understood the script, I had great conversations with David Yates, and I felt prepared to dive in.\n\nMcIntyre: Would you describe this movie as out of your comfort zone?\n\nHoward: I would describe inheriting a franchise where John Williams has written unforgettable thematic material for the last 15 years and being asked to re-create the melodic world as slightly uncomfortable. I seek those kinds of jobs out. I think they are the ones that help me grow as a composer, and they don't come along all that often.\n\nMcIntyre: There are a number of great composers that worked on the Harry Potter series, but John Williams was the first.\n\nHoward: Yes he was. He wrote “Hedwig’s Theme,” which I think is the one that most people probably identify with. The thing about Fantastic Beasts is that it's in the wizarding world, in J.K. Rowling’s world, but it's not a Harry Potter movie. It takes place 70 years before Harry comes into being, so while we tip our hat and acknowledge in a respectful and witty wink and a nod kind of way to “Hedwig’s Theme,” the score is composed of all new material.\n\nMcIntyre: Was it at all intimidating to pick up where John Williams left off and to use the music he made and reinterpret it?\n\nHoward: I didn't really do that. We only used John's themes for I think seven seconds when they show the Warner Bros. logo, and I think in a few other tiny spots. From the very beginning, and probably in David Yates’ mind from the very beginning, was to create new thematic material that would be identifiable with Fantastic Beasts.\n\nMcIntyre: Now that you have done the first film, are you interested in seeing it through for the next four?\n\nHoward: David and I have talked about it. I'm certainly doing the next one, he's asked me to do it. We had a pretty incredible time together on this one, so I will certainly be doing that one. Beyond that, who knows? I would like to think that I would do all of them and that I would be asked back, but who knows what happens that far in advance.\n\nMcIntyre: How familiar with you with the wizarding world before this opportunity popped up?\n\nHoward: I was pretty familiar. I have kids who are now in their 20s who were devout and committed fans of Harry Potter, so I watched most of them several times, and all of them at least once. When I say the wizarding world, if you translate that into musical terms, it means somewhat sophisticated and detailed orchestral writing in sort of a 19th-century classical modality. It's borrowing orchestrational ideas from everybody from Tchaikovsky to more contemporary composers and even further into the 20th century with strong thematic elements with certain orchestrational sounds that make it feel magical. It's in the heart of the music where the differences are made. Hopefully, the substance of the score has a life beyond on the movie, and people will enjoy it and carry it on with them through the next film.\n\nMcIntyre: What did your kids say when you accepted this position?\n\nHoward: They were thrilled. They were very happy. I auditioned several themes for them before I played them for David, and they certainly have their favorites. They are my biggest fans and my harshest critics, or at least my most honest critics.\n\nMcIntyre: How long does it take from beginning to the score being completely finished? How long does that take and what does that process look like?\n\nHoward: In this particular case it took nearly seven months, which is really long. One of the things David wanted when we first talked was a composer who would come onto the film early, and in his words, be “part of the architecture of the movie.” Someone to provide music early on in demo form that they could use while the film is being edited, which is a really effective tool to have so you're not covering the movie borrowing music from others while you're editing the movie.\n\nI spent the first three months in Los Angeles creating mock-ups or demos and emailing them to David in London. Our dialogue began then. I wrote a lot of music, and then I rewrote a lot of music. Then I went to London late in June and stayed through the middle of September working with David, back and forth, rewriting again, trying different ideas and ultimately recording about nine days’ worth of music at Abbey Road with an orchestra and choir.\n\nIt's a long process, and I would say that when a composer writes, what a composer really does is rewrite. It's something that can be utterly exhausting, but ultimately really beneficial to the process. I think when the director challenges you in a positive way, that the results are inevitably better. For instance, I discovered a couple of the primary themes of the movie really in the last hours of my composing. That had to do with David continually saying, “That's fantastic, but is there any other way?” Or, “Is there anything else we could try?” It can be frustrating and intimidating at times, but ultimately a very fruitful process.\n\nMcIntyre: When you are starting on a movie, especially a large franchise like this, do you think about what critics will think, what fans think, or what the Oscars may think? Do you keep any of that in mind?\n\nHoward: You don't keep in mind, but it invades your mind anyway. You try not to keep any of that stuff in your mind, but I do believe that it's a positive thing for a composer to consider what life a score could have beyond the movie. Obviously, the first and foremost job is to do the storytelling, but that doesn't mean the music can't have some degree of substance and enjoyment outside of the movie. That's what I think about from time to time. I really don't think about the Oscars. I hate bad reviews, so yeah, every now and then I think, “Boy I hope everybody really likes this and thinks this theme is good.” You can't help but do that. I think we all are, or at least I am, reduced to a schoolboy seeking approval. I feel very vulnerable and confident at the same time depending on what day it is.\n\nMcIntyre: When you look back on your career, is there a certain piece of music that stands out to you as something that you think of as best or perhaps a favorite?\n\nHoward: At this point, I'm not sure, but I think I might've done 130 movies, so it's really hard for me to say that one score is my favorite. I tend to feel that the score I just finished is my favorite because I am so immersed in it, so I'm going to say Fantastic Beasts is my favorite. There are things about it that I think I have done better as a composer and as an orchestrator in Fantastic Beasts.\n\nThere are some scores that I've done that I am particularly fond of for other reasons. I think one of my favorite scores ever was a small movie that Robert Mulligan directed. To work with him is thrilling, and I think the movie is charming and very moving and very powerful. I have good, warm feelings for the music. That's one of my favorites, even though most people haven't seen that movie. Usually, we get recognized for our most popular work, but that doesn't necessarily mean that's our best work."
