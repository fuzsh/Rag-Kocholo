        "text": "\" A world where James Newton Howard rules the planet \"\n\nWritten by Thomas Glorieux - Review of the regular release\n\nWaterworld (at that specific moment the most expensive movie ever created) was the entry of James Newton Howard into the Hollywood A-list of composers. At least that's what I thought of it. People all accepted it but didn't give Howard the much deserved praise. It did take nearly 5 years for fans to finally adore the man, when his entries of The Sixth Sense and Dinosaur gave people the wonder that is James Newton Howard. David Arnold was catapulted into fame with Independence Day, and I believe James Newton Howard did exactly the same thing when he made Waterworld soar.\n\nYes you better admit it, what Waterworld packs is a sheer massive tone from begin to end. Even with the occasional percussion trembles, ethnic whistles or chiming bells, there is always an example of powerful music waiting around the corner. \"Main Titles\" is one example where the choir suddenly explodes without ever stating the main theme, and \"Half an Hour\" is another one where the last minute is chock full of choral majesty. But that's just the beginning.\n\nBecause Waterworld has so much more. For instance the extensive use of the LA Master Chorale, delivering an impact during almost any track. It not only enhances the fantasy element during the breathtaking sceneries, it also elevates the action on screen. But even without the choir, the score remains to deliver sheer bombastic energy. Take for instance the absolutely breathtaking main theme in \"Escaping the Smokers\". This is fantastic stuff and offers you immediately a heroic main theme that's instantly accepted. The other theme of the movie is the complete opposite of that. In \"Prodigal Child\" Enola's theme counter attacks the energy by delivering a soft and beautiful humable theme for flutes.\n\nBut it are the massive thematic action tracks that give this score its mighty wings. \"Smokers Sighted\" delivers a pair of angry villain marches, \"The Skyboat\" boasts some almighty choral statements, the heroic attitude and the return of the main theme make \"Helen Frees the Mariner\" an amazing track to listen to, and the once more excellent use of choir and orchestra in typical rousing form make \"Slide for Live\" recommendable. And there's more. The choir is also used to deliver a more wondrous air around things, like in \"The Atoll\" or most impressively in \"The Bubble\". You've guessed it, practically every track carries a unique touch with them.\n\nSo are we there yet? Hardly because we've got a couple of enchanting beauties after that bombastic stuff too. In \"Swimming\" we receive the delicate blossoming love that's supported by flutes, bells, soft strings and Marisa Chandler's solo voice as we watch Enola and The Mariner swim together for the first time. Truly enchanting. Besides that we have powerful statements of Enola's theme in \"Dry Land\" and the main theme in \"Main Credits\". And I think \"Deacon's Speech\" will remain for practically everyone one of the most brilliant pieces of James Newton Howard's career.\n\nYes, we are finally done. Waterworld is simply loaded with goodies, perhaps not in order but nonetheless delivering a big and epic score for what is still a roller coaster ride of a film. Not many people think highly of the film, but I love the humor, the action and the look of it all. And I think James Newton Howard is partly responsible for that honor, making the film so much more enjoyable. In a nutshell, Waterworld is just like Stargate, Independence Day and First Knight one of those knock-out soundtracks that comes around too slim these days. So better order it fast, if you haven't done so already.\n\nTracklisting\n\n1. Main Titles (4.43)\n\n2. Escaping the Smokers (3.49) Excellent track\n\n3. The Atoll (1.42)\n\n4.
