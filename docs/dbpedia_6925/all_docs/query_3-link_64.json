        "text": "Nine-time Oscar-nominated film composer James Newton Howard will be honored in the Los Angeles Chamber Orchestra's (LACO) \"2022 Gala Celebration: Simple Gifts.\"\n\nAs a composer, conductor, and music producer Howard has scored over 100 films and is the recipient of a Grammy Award and Emmy Award.\n\nHoward composed the music for films such as Fantastic Beasts: The Crimes of Grindelwald, The Hunger Games franchise, Nightcrawler, Maleficent, and The Bourne Legacy.\n\nThe in-person event includes a cocktail reception, dinner, and live musical program featuring LACO Music Director Jaime Martín conducting the Orchestra in Copland's Appalachian Spring. There will also be special arrangements of two works from two of Howard's film scores, \"The Wedding\" from Wyatt Earp directed by Lawrence Kasdan, and \"A Man & His Beasts Redux,\" a suite from the Fantastic Beasts films directed by David Yates. Introducing Howard is multi-platinum recording artist Josh Groban.\n\nBesides the gala event — in which proceeds will benefit concert performances and educational initiatives of the LACO — a virtual auction has also been planned to start on April 25. Highlights of the virtual auction include a private meet and greet with Howard and a one-hour tour of his Santa Monica studio for four guests."
