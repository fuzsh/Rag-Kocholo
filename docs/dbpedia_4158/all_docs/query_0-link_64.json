        "text": "Heart palpitations are when your heartbeat becomes more noticeable. They're usually harmless, but get help if you keep getting them or you also have other symptoms.\n\nWhat heart palpitations feel like\n\nWhen you have heart palpitations, your heartbeat feels uncomfortable or unusual. You may feel it in your chest, neck or throat.\n\nYour heartbeat may feel like it is:\n\nracing or beating very fast\n\nirregular, with skipped or extra beats (ectopic beats)\n\npounding or thumping\n\nfluttering\n\nHeart palpitations can last seconds, minutes or longer.\n\nCauses of heart palpitations\n\nHeart palpitations are common and not usually a sign of anything serious.\n\nCommon causes include:\n\nstrenuous exercise\n\nlack of sleep\n\nstress and anxiety\n\nmedicines (check the leaflet that comes with the medicine)\n\nalcohol, caffeine, nicotine and recreational drugs\n\nSometimes heart palpitations can be a sign you're going through the menopause. Some people get them during pregnancy.\n\nLess often, they can be caused by a condition such as iron deficiency anaemia, an overactive thyroid (hyperthyroidism) or a heart rhythm problem (arrhythmia).\n\nNon-urgent advice: See a GP if:\n\nYou have heart palpitations and:\n\nthey keep coming back or they're getting worse\n\nthey last longer than a few minutes\n\nyou have a heart condition\n\nyou have a history of heart problems in your family\n\nImmediate action required: Call 999 or go to A&E if:\n\nYou currently have heart palpitations with any of these symptoms:\n\nchest pain\n\nshortness of breath\n\nfeeling faint or fainting\n\nInformation:\n\nIf you've had these symptoms but they've now stopped, ask your GP surgery for an urgent appointment, call 111 or get help from 111 online.\n\nInformation:\n\nDo not drive to A&E. Ask someone to drive you or call 999 and ask for an ambulance.\n\nBring any medicines you take with you.\n\nTreatment for heart palpitations\n\nTreatment for heart palpitations depends on the cause. They often do not need to be treated.\n\nAvoiding things that can trigger palpitations, such as stress, smoking, caffeine and alcohol, can help.\n\nYou may have an electrocardiogram (ECG) to help find out what the cause might be. This is a test where small pads are stuck to your skin to check the electrical signals coming from your heart.\n\nIf your palpitations are caused by a heart problem, you may need medicines or a procedure to help correct your heartbeat."
