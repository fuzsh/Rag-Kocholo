        "text": "How to Do It is Slate’s sex advice column. Have a question? Send it to Jessica and Rich here. It’s anonymous!\n\nDear How to Do It,\n\nI’m a nonbinary lady type person somewhere on the asexual spectrum married to a straight allosexual guy. I love him so much, I think he’s gorgeous and I love making him feel good and the sense of intimacy I get from sex. But I have a really hard time relaxing and enjoying when the focus is on me (so pretty much anything other than me, still partially dressed, blowing him). I don’t know if it’s my anxiety disorder, my general discomfort with my body, or the asexual stuff or what, but I have the hardest time turning off my brain and enjoying the physical sensations… unless I’m drunk or high. Then it’s all systems go. I don’t want him to feel like I have to be under the influence to have sex with him! I barely ever drink or smoke, so the pattern would be pretty obvious. My partner wants to make me feel good and I don’t know how to relax enough to let him. Help!\n\n—Want To Do It Sober\n\nDear Want To Do It Sober,\n\nWhile you certainly don’t want to use so much that you become incapacitated, the substances you mention can offer relaxation when taken in moderation. It seems like you’ve found a way to use them to your benefit, so I’m loathe to forbid you from doing so, but I understand you’re looking for other routes. That’s healthy! You say you have an anxiety disorder—where are you with that? Are you seeing a clinician and have you made any progress? It sounds like this issue is bigger than sex and requires a bit of heavy lifting, so by all means pursue it with a doctor or therapist and see if they can help you find some useful treatments.\n\nTo relax, you may want to look into CBD, which can give you some of the chilled-out effects of weed (if said CBD comes with a low dose of THC, the potential for those effects is higher). Meditation and exercise are my go-tos for stress management (I went into my meditation practice in a past column, which you may want to check out). Your mention of being unable to turn off your brain and enjoy the physical sensations makes me wonder if a blindfold isn’t worth a shot, too—sensory deprivation can allow you to focus specifically on sensation. It might be a bit too advanced/scary for you, but it also might do the trick.\n\nYou could also play around with going slowly—try to connect with your partner sober, and only go as far as you’re comfortable with. Maybe that’s just cuddling or kissing. If that feels good, try progressing something else that seems low level, as well, like fondling. Get comfortable in that space and keep ratcheting up the contact. Of course, a sex therapist/couples counselor could also be useful in helping target your difficulties and creating a path to substance-free satisfaction.\n\nNeed Friendship Advice?\n\nFor a special feature, we want to help answer all your questions about the friendships in your life! Send in a question now.\n\nDear How to Do It,\n\nLong time reader, first time writer here… Although I am one of the few children lucky enough to have received respectful and accurate sex education at my public schools in the ‘80s and ‘90s, our understanding, acceptance, and vocabulary regarding individual sexuality have obviously accelerated by light years since then. Especially from reading your columns, it has occurred to me that I think I have the words to express mine. I wonder if you’ve seen this before and what overall advice you have for me. After a long, difficult, and sexless marriage for the majority of my adult life, as I ponder perhaps dating/having sex now, I think I identify as pan for dick, in that physical body type means nothing to me—while soul, heart, and intellect are turn ons, and asexual for masturbation. Is this a thing? Does it have a name?!\n\n—Pan for Dick? Ace Solo?\n\nDear Pan for Dick? Ace Solo?,\n\nShort answer: It is a thing, in that it’s happening to you, and it has a name because you just gave it one.\n\nHowever, it would help to have a bit more background, just to check your specific rationale. “Pan for dick” sounds to me like it could describe someone who is attracted to people with penises, regardless of their gender identity, or is attracted to the penises themselves—phallophile could work in that specific case. But your turn-ons being soul, heart, and intellect sound something adjacent to sapiosexuality (an attraction to intellect) and demisexuality (an attraction to emotional connection, which I think you need to respond to someone’s heart and soul). These are just words, though! If they don’t work for you, I always advise to use a sentence (or a paragraph or an essay or a book) when describing your sexuality to other people. Everyone is different and labels are shorthand—more important to adhering to an existing categorization is the self-interrogation that will allow you to articulate your own with specificity. You’re already there.\n\nAsexual for masturbation is a bit more perplexing to me, as the broadest definition of asexuality is a lack of sexual attraction. Perhaps you don’t feel sexual attraction in your solo time and are more focused on sensation? Certainly plenty of asexual people masturbate for a variety of reasons. Aceflux is the term generally used for people whose sexuality fluctuates (either within the asexual spectrum or sometimes within and sometimes not). So that might be useful for you.\n\nYou’re thinking about this stuff, and that’s what’s important. Keep it up and stay open to evolving.\n\nHow to Get Advice From How to Do It\n\nHave a nagging (or totally inconsequential) question about sex? It’s fun to see your words in this column! Send it in now.\n\nDear How to Do It,\n\nI am a woman in my 60s. My husband died a little over two years ago. We were married contentedly over 20 years. He was my only sexual partner. I miss him, and I also miss the intimacy of having another person with whom I feel connected in my life. I didn’t date much before we met. We met in a workplace, but I don’t work in such a setting anymore. I have never used dating apps and, frankly, I’m scared to try them. I don’t want to replace my late husband, but I also don’t want to spend my last couple of decades without a loving, intimate relationship. What do you suggest?\n\n—Facing a New World\n\nDear Facing a New World,\n\nI think one of the best things you can do to set yourself up for your next relationship is to accept that it will be different than your last one. You deserve happiness and love. A new partner won’t replace your old one. Don’t think of it like wallpapering over your past; think of it like setting up a new room. You’ll have your memories and you’ll retain all of the things your relationship has taught you—your husband lives on through the mark he made on your life.\n\nApps can be daunting, even as a regular user, but right now your fear is of the unknown. There’s a chance that if and when you start using them, you’ll see that they can be helpful and fun. You have a wide variety to choose from—OK Cupid, Bumble, and Hinge among them. Be honest about who you are and what you’re looking for and know that a lot of people will talk plenty of nonsense. Also, know that finding a partner is a process—you may find some inspiration in this personal essay by a woman who started using apps at 62. “Dating had become a process of tossing out pancakes and hoping a good one would finally materialize in the pan,” writes the author, Andi Pollinger. To stay safe and avoid wasting time, you can shut things down at the very impression of a red flag. If you really don’t like online dating, though, you can try to meet people the old-fashioned way, face-to-face. It doesn’t have to be at work—I would look into group activities and hobbies in your area (your local parks district or recreation centers might be places to start your search) where you could meet people in your age group.\n\nDear How to Do It,\n\nI (early 40s married man) am having a long-distance affair with a (late 30s, married) woman and I’m struggling with an emotion I cannot quite determine is jealousy, and I am having difficulty isolating it from (certainly) feelings of guilt, self-consciousness, and insecurity. For background and context: One morning, she initiated a playful conversation. A racy photo, featuring the underwear bottom of lingerie, quickly spun us into a hurried sext/voice quickie. Throughout the day we continued to chat and in the afternoon she was able to play some more, while I was not able to do much more than provide extensive and enthusiastic text encouragement. I let her know I was still sore from the morning’s enthusiastic play, and she echoed that sentiment, followed by the admission that she also had sex the night before with her husband.\n\nPerhaps sensing a line crossed, she quickly explained how she wished for certain things to be different between them—the specific text was deleted shortly afterward, but in the moment I found no real response coming to me outside a bit of shock; I did my best not to show it. We both acknowledged it was a bit of a tricky situation and that she would let me get back to work.\n\nI’ve been haunted since then by a feeling—I do not believe it is jealousy. I am an affair partner, and thus know my role as such. I was chosen for (presumably) what I could provide outside of her current situation. And likewise, the same applies, I did choose her also. I have no such delusions of exclusivity to her intimacy, nor do I believe she harbors any feelings like that toward my wife (although, she had previously expressed a protective disappointment in the lack of intimacy in my marriage, which is its own landmine). What, then, was I, and am I still feeling?\n\nIn her admission to me that she wished for several things to be different with her husband, I felt something like (but perhaps not like) an injury. In that moment, I wished that she could have it all. What she sees in me—attraction, excitement, arousal, intimacy—I found myself wishing that her husband could provide. From all I know of her life, she’s got a stable marriage, house, kids. So why then, should I need to exist, I found myself asking? What if she could have it all, and therefore not need someone like me?\n\nWe are, surprisingly, very open about things like this, and I expressed some version of the above thought process to her, and it’s possible I did not accurately, fully, or wholly describe how it is affecting me so. I believe we’ve moved past the incident itself, but a part of me cannot yet. I’m disturbed that I felt this way, and grapple with the idea that it is merely a facet of jealousy of the intimacy she shares with her husband and the nature of being that “other” person—fully acknowledging that she is that for me in my situation. Am I jealous? If so, then of what? And if it not jealous, am I simply finding some edge of guilt, self-consciousness, and insecurity manifesting itself like this?\n\n—A Ghost Who Asks to Be Judged Later\n\nDear a Ghost Who Asks to Be Judged Later,\n\nAs powerful as this job sometimes makes me feel, I cannot tell you what your emotions were, especially if you can’t. But I can tell you that what you describe sounds a lot to me like empathy. This person that you clearly have feelings for, irrespective of the unethical nature of your relationship, revealed that she wishes for a different life. This resonated so much that it made you yearn for it as well to the point of eliminating your own presence in her life as you realize it is a symptom of dissatisfaction. It made you existential and it imparted the emptiness that she expressed. I have to wonder if what I’m perceiving as empathy hit you so hard because you are also married and cheating thanks to, in your telling, a lack of intimacy in your marriage. We all carry around emptiness and she just happened to share some of hers that you could relate to.\n\nI think it might just be that simple. I know those perceived as male are socialized in a such a way that it can make emotions difficult to verbalize and sometimes even identify, but I’m side-eyeing you a little for not being able to come up with that on your own. (Or at least describe why it isn’t empathy in your letter.) Empathy, what a concept! But then again, you’re engaging in an affair without the permission (or, I’m assuming, knowledge) of your wife, so maybe it’s not surprising that empathy doesn’t come natural to you and when it does, it’s confounding. I know you asked to not be judged, but I couldn’t help but get in that dig. Sorry, I’m human.\n\n—Rich\n\nMore Advice From Slate"
