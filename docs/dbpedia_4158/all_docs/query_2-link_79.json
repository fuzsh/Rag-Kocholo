        "text": "It's important to embrace our natural bodies – and that's exactly why a model proudly flaunted her bare skin.\n\nAriella Nyssa is a body positive influencer known for sharing self-love advice, which is why she boasts more than 720,000 Instagram followers. Recently, she shared an unedited video which showed close-up shots of her whole body – and she did so for a very important reason.\n\nThe influencer, who's known for opening up about body image, went make-up free and zoomed in on unfiltered parts of her body - from her face to her hips to her eyes. She did this to show her skin marks, cellulite, the hairs on her face and the wrinkles on her skin.\n\nThe blonde beauty showed that these components are what mix together to make a \"normal woman\", so there's no need to feel shame if you don't look like a curated Instagram image 24/7.\n\nEven though the clip carried a poignant message, Ariella admitted editing and posting the video really \"tested her soul\". It forced her to think a lot about her own insecurities.\n\nAlongside the clip, Ariella wrote: \"I've thought about people in my life seeing this, people on the internet and judging me. Judging me for all of these things I usually hide because of society's expectations of beauty.\n\n\"But, as you guys know, posting the things I'm insecure about are where I grow the most in my own self-love journey. Posting the things I'm insecure about takes the power of societal beauty standards anyway. It gives me my power back.\n\n\"That if I say this is beautiful, this is real. Then this is beautiful and real. I hope this helps you see how beautiful you are - that your insecurities make you imperfectly perfect, and that you are enough.\"\n\nSince she shared the post, more than 11,000 people have liked it and left positive comments. People really appreciate how transparent Ariella is with her powerful posts.\n\nOne person said: \"I'm incredibly grateful for this post, and all the content you share. It has forced me to love my body. I think you're so beautiful and it helps me find things like this beautiful in myself. So, thank you.\"\n\nA second added: \"Thank you for being so brave, raw and real by sharing this. Love all your posts.\" And a third also replied: \"This is so real. We need to learn what real is when scrolling the internet.\"\n\nThe model is celebrated for opening up about her body image issues candidly – but she sometimes receives backlash. Even so, she's determined not to let the negative comments get her down, so she clapped back in the best way she knew how - by sharing a video of herself strutting her stuff in a bikini.\n\nIn a previous Instagram post, Ariella said: \"I've had my fair share of comments about my cellulite. And trust me I've heard it all. Sometimes it even makes me want to stop posting photos like this. To give in to what society deems as un achievable expectations of beauty. To hide. To cover up.\n\n\"But, the only way to show people this is normal is to post it. So this post is for every woman who has been told their cellulite is too much. That it’s something they should be insecure about.\n\n\"Because it's NORMAL. And it’s a beautiful part of myself that I never want to hide out of embarrassment or shame. It’s NOTHING to be ashamed about. It’s imperfect. Just like each and every one of us. Let’s make THIS normal.\"\n\nAriella often shares candid snaps of herself in bikinis with her body totally relaxed. As well as going make-up free, she likes to show how her body naturally sits to reveal her tummy rolls, curves and cellulite."
