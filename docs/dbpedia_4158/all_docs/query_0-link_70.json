        "text": "GMO Cookies, also known as as \"GMO Garlic Cookies\" and \"Garlic Cookies,\" is a potent indica-dominant hybrid marijuana strain made by crossing Girl Scout Cookies with Chemdawg. This strain produces a euphoric high with mentally uplifting effects. Consumers say Garlic Cookies promotes an incredible body high that leaves you feeling relaxed and free from pain. In large doses, this strain may lock you to the sofa and make you feel sedated. As a descendent from Girl Scout Cookies, you can expect loud flavors from Garlic Cookies, like a diesel aroma and a garlic-forward taste that lingers on your tastebuds. Medical marijuana patients choose this strain to help relieve symptoms associated with chronic pain, depression, and nausea. According to growers, Garlic Cookies flowers into light green, spade-shaped buds that are dusted with white trichomes and curly orange hairs. This strain was originally bred by Mamiko Seeds. If you've smoked, dabbed, or consumed Garlic Cookies (aka GMO Cookies) before, tell us about your experience by leaving a strain review.\n\nThose growing GMO Cookies with standard or feminized seeds should expect to pay $10-15 per seed. Growing GMO Cookies with standard or feminized seeds is considered to be hard and produces a medium yield. The healthiest GMO Cookies plants will grow to be short to medium in height, especially when grown in soil. Flowering time for GMO Cookies is 8-9 weeks. With all of this said, if you’re growing GMO Cookies with auto-flowering seeds, you can expect the process to look slightly different. Auto-flowering seeds will flower automatically regardless of the light cycle, and will usually be ready to harvest in 8-9 weeks from seed."
