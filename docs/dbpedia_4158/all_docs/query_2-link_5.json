I distinctly remember describing it to anyone who’d listen at the time- good one Racey Helps xxx\n\nThis entire review has been hidden because of spoilers.\n\nJune 18, 2023\n\nA hedgehog and a mouse take a holiday together when low on funds. Adventure ensues with beautiful pictures and sweet dialogue. My favorite childhood book."
