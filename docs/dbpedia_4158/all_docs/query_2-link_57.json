[...] Everything so far he said he'd do he's done, which is almost unheard of in politics, he gets no credit for it! [...] I think when everything is all said and done, he's gonna be one of the best presidents we've ever had.\"[67] In an interview with Esquire magazine in 2023, Parsons stated that he was \"no longer a fan\" of Trump, and was neither a Democrat nor a Republican.[64] He added that in retrospect, the U.S. president that he thinks most highly of is former U.S. President Barack Obama.[64]\n\nControversies\n\n[edit]\n\nIn 2011, Parsons was criticized by animal rights and other groups for tweeting a video in which he shoots and kills an elephant on a safari in Zimbabwe.[68][69] In response, Parsons said, \"elephants are not endangered and probably there are too many of them.\"[70] According to Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora elephants are listed as Schedule II.[71] Parsons was unapologetic and believed the controversy would not harm his company, saying \"For anyone leaving GoDaddy, someone new has come. It has had minimal impact—and probably overall, I see it as a net positive. All publicity is good publicity if you’re [in] the right. I can’t quantify it for you. I didn’t do this to promote GoDaddy.\"[72]\n\nGoDaddy was criticized as sexist for advertising practices between its first Super Bowl ad in 2005 through the company's IPO in 2014.[73] \"The Go Daddy girl was my idea,\" Parsons said. \"I told the ad agency, I want a really well-endowed, good-looking gal in a tight T-shirt, with our name right across her breasts.\"[74] He used his blog to draw attention to ads that were rejected from television as too racy.[75]\n\nReferences\n\n[edit]\n\nBiography portal"
