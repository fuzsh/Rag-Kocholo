        "text": "Looking for the best “Never Have I Ever\" questions to level up your next group hang? This slumber party classic is perfect for a real-life or Zoom game — and we've done the work for you of whipping up some good “Never Have I Ever” questions that are perfect for getting your friends to spill. (Because, let’s be honest, secret swapping is the real reason we play this game.) Whether you’re looking for funny “Never Have I Ever” ideas or you’re the type of person who sticks to tell-all truth questions when playing Truth or Dare, you’ll find what you need below for a round that’s as fun as it is revealing. All you have to do is play!\n\nHow to Play Never Have I Ever\n\nSpeaking of playing, if you need a refresher, here are the “Never Have I Ever\" game rules. To start off, every player holds up their hands with all 10 fingers showing. Then, you’ll go around and take turns reading off a “Never Have I Ever” from the list. As the person reading, you’ll need to choose a thing you actually haven’t done yourself — feel free to skip around the list, or substitute in some good “Never Have I Ever” questions of your own. Every time a player has, in fact, done one of the things mentioned, they must put a finger down. The person with the last finger standing wins!\n\nThe Best Times to Play Never Have I Ever\n\nLike with most things, there’s a time and a place for a game like this. Is it an ice breaker for a professional setting, like, say, a meet and greet with a new coworker? Maybe not, unless you’re really close. Never Have I Ever is a perfect party game because you can play with as many people as you want. In fact, the more the merrier. It’s also great for small groups, maybe a sleepover with your closest friends or as a tool for killing time on an especially long road trip.\n\nIt’s a great game to play with family, too, on vacations or while you’re gathered together for the holidays. Just make sure you keep it clean and you don’t ask anything you actually wouldn’t want to share with your parents or siblings. Make sure you really think about the best Never Have I Ever questions for a family setting before jumping into the deep end.\n\nBest Never Have I Ever Questions\n\nNever Have I ever is a very situational game, which can make it tough to put together a tidy curation of the very best questions to ask. Instead, think of the first few queries as a vibe check of sorts. These are the questions that you can ask a wide range of people, from parents and coworkers to best friends and romantic partners. If anything, they’re great conversation starters. Here are some Never Have I Ever examples to get the group going.\n\nNever have I ever broken a bone.\n\nNever have I ever Googled myself.\n\nNever have I ever traveled solo.\n\nNever have I ever seen a ghost.\n\nNever have I ever toilet-papered someone's house.\n\nNever have I ever laughed so hard I spit out my drink.\n\nNever have I ever pretended to be on the phone.\n\nNever have I ever met a celebrity.\n\nNever have I ever sleepwalked.\n\nNever have I ever read an entire book in a day.\n\nNever have I ever gone to a party I wasn’t invited to.\n\nNever have I ever stayed up all night.\n\nNow, onto the questions!
