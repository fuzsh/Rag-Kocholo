        "text": "Adventures of an All-Rescue Sled Dog Team: Racey’s Rescues\n\nThanks to the Bayfield Chamber and Visitor Bureau for featuring our story.\n\nThe underdog is a term often reserved for the team that everyone expects to fail but secretly hopes will come out on top. Jim Lynch and Sally Hedges, pack leaders of Racey’s Rescues sled dog team, pride themselves on being the underdogs at the Apostle Islands Sled Dog Race, because for their six rescued sled dogs it’s all about living a life filled with fun runs and adventure.\n\nIt all started fourteen years ago with a bird-dog named Racey that Lynch and Hedges rescued from a neglect situation. At the time of her adoption, Racey was malnourished and tied up outside 24 hours a day without access to a doghouse.\n\n“That was by far the most dramatic rescue we made,” Hedges recalled, who slept with Racey on the floor until she was comfortable with her new home. “The funny thing is, Jim always said he wasn’t a ‘dog-person.’ He’s had her by his side ever since.”\n\n“She is the love of my life next to Sally,” Lynch laughs.\n\nShortly after the adoption, Lynch was cross-country skiing with Racey when a skijorer passed him. Seeing how fast this person was moving and the excitement of the dog pulling its owner, Lynch immediately purchased a harness.\n\n“She started it all through skijoring,” said Lynch. “Once you have a good lead, everyone else just wants to follow.”\n\nEach of the dogs on the Racey’s Rescues team was adopted as a puppy from varying circumstances, some of which were more tragic than others.\n\nFor someone who never considered himself a dog person, over the years Lynch has become a proud pack leader. He enjoys treating his pack to his own homemade smoked fish caught straight from Lake Superior. “It’s what I live for, it’s a part of me and it’s my hobby,” Lynch beamed.\n\n“It’s really interesting taking a bunch of shelter dogs,” Lynch stated. “Eventually everything works, but it takes time and patience. Each one of them comes from a different background and they usually tend to be a little skittish. By the time they race, each one of the dogs must be accustomed to people, cars, ATV’s, snowmobiles, blizzards, windstorms, other dogs and trees falling in the forest.”\n\nThree years ago, Lynch apprehensively approached the start chute of the Apostle Islands Sled Dog Race with a pounding heart, a head swimming with worries and a team of six rambunctious rescued sled dogs.\n\nAlthough Lynch had been working with his team for seven years at that point, he had his trepidations about the race and the dogs’ ability to make it through as a team. The race usually draws about 50 sled dog teams and follows a course along a variety of terrains unique to the Bayfield Peninsula, enough to make even seasoned mushers and teams work for their keep.\n\n“I was so nervous at the start chute,” recalled Lynch. “I just sort of wanted to get through it and I honestly couldn’t remember why I had decided to do it in the first place.”\n\nAs soon as the signal blasted and the dogs began running, Lynch’s worries about the dog’s performance and trail manners were left in the team’s snow-blasting wake. He was shocked at how well the team performed—passing without issues and finishing as a unified crew—Lynch couldn’t help but beam by the end of his first race.\n\n“It went really good and the dogs did great,” Lynch said. “I was so ecstatic that night! I think I loved those dogs more than I ever had. They were heroes. The only time I really get emotional is when I get out on the trail and see those dogs and how happy they are. It actually brings a tear to my eye.”\n\nLynch said he never consciously decided to become a musher or adopted dog parent, it “just sort of happened.”\n\nIn fact, training the Racey’s Recues team over the years has been a true community effort asserts Lynch. Although he is the only person who currently runs with the Racey’s Rescues team, he said there have been countless individuals who’ve educated him on kennel maintenance, team operations and who still contribute to the Racey’s Rescues kennel today.\n\n“What’s neat about this team is that the whole community has really embraced it and helped out,” said Hedges.\n\nLynch said he feels compelled to participate in the Apostle Islands Sled Dog Race because so many people in the community get excited to see his team of misfits.\n\n“I have to do this for the dogs, it’s a part of the community and now it’s a tradition for me,” he said.\n\nPhotography by Hannah Stonehouse Photo"
