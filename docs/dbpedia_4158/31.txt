Angus Clifford Racey Helps (1913–1970) was an English children's author and illustrator.

A TV interview with Racey Helps 30th August 1966.

Racey Helps was born in Bristol on 2nd February 1913, to Clifford R. Helps and his wife Dorothy (née Davis) who had married in Cardiff in 1911. He spent his childhood in Chelvey, Somerset. He was privately educated at a vicarage and later at Bristol Cathedral School.

On leaving school he entered the antiquarian book business and attended the West of England College of Art. Helps married Irene Orr on 8th April 1936. A daughter, Anne, was born in July 1937 and a son, Julian Racey, on May 4th 1950.

Racey Helps was first published by Collins. Later his books and illustrations were published as greetings cards and postcards by the Medici Society and others.

The Helps family lived in Shepton Mallet and then Clevedon both in Somerset, then Saltford near Bath and from 1962 in Barnstaple, Devon.

Racey Helps suffered a fatal heart attack at home in Barnstaple in 1970 aged 57.
