        "text": "Stone Age and Early Iron Age\n\nThe first inhabitants came to Lithuania approximately thirteen thousand years ago, after a glacial retreat. Late Palaeolithic hunters wandered to this area with harsh natural environmental conditions. They followed the migration herds of reindeer and set up temporary camps in their hunting grounds. More than once they also stopped in Kernavė. Their traces discovered in the Pajauta Valley on the River Neris include flint arrowheads of Swiderian culture and other artefacts dating from the Late Palaeolithic period about the 9th millennium BC. The warming up of the climate during the Mesolithic period contributed to landscape changes from the tundra with sparse herb cover and dwarf shrubs to woodlands of deciduous and coniferous trees. Forests were home to a wide variety of animals; rivers and lakes abounded in fish. People, still dependent on nature, became increasingly sedentary. Since then the archaeological site of Kernavė was continuously being settled. Along with the domestication of plants and animals during the Neolithic period (5th–3nd millennia BC) the campsites were replaced by permanent settlements. The worldview had changed as well: humans increasingly considered themselves as separate from the natural world; animal cults were gradually supplanted by the worship of anthropomorphic gods. The Indo-Europeans, ancestors of the Baltic tribes, were a new wave of inhabitants who arrived to Lithuania during this period. The Early Iron Age marked the transition from the Stone Age to the Iron Age. People living in the territory of Lithuania started to make tools of bronze, although, flint and bone tools remained in use for a long time. Investigations carried out in the Pajauta Valley reveal the development of campsites and settlements in Kernavė during the Stone Age and the Early Iron Age, whereas the archaeological material from the hill-forts provides evidence of their early settlement during the Early Iron Age.\n\nIron Age\n\nSignificant and rapid changes in the material culture of people took place at the turn of the Common Era in the territory of Lithuania. The large extent of iron metallurgy and widespread use of iron working tools led to such advances as increasing productivity, improvement of living conditions, and growth of the population. In the basin of the River Neris flourished the culture of Brushed Pottery whose people are considered to be ancestors of the East Baltic tribes.\n\nDuring the first centuries, modest fortified settlements formed on the hill-forts. In Kernavė a natural promontory of the upper terrace of the Neris, today called Aukuras Hill, had been adapted for living. With the ongoing increase in population, settlements of farmers were established in the fertile Pajauta Valley in the 2nd–3rd centuries.\n\nThe Iron Age is an important period for the formation of the Baltic tribes. As a result of the complicated ethnocultural processes in the 3rd century, the East Lithuanian Barrow Culture emerged. Representatives of this culture are the direct ancestors of the Lithuanian nation. The final split of the Balts into separate tribes was prompted by the Great Migration which culminated in the 5th century. Traces of this turbulent period were found in Kernavė as well. Evidence of repeated attacks by the Huns revealed findings discovered in the hill-fort of Aukuras Hill, such as arrowheads characteristic to those of the nomadic tribes and remains of burned defensive fortifications.\n\nDuring the Iron Age, one of the most important tribal centres of the Lithuanian tribe was formed in Kernavė. This tribe played a crucial role in the consolidation of the Balts as well as in the formation of the Lithuanian state – the Grand Duchy of Lithuania in the 13th century.\n\nKernavė in the Middle Ages"
