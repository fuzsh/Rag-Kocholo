I insisted I have him as my guide on my tour the next day, and he was even better than today. The capitals are all beautiful, and having the chance to see places like this one-on-one with a local person made it all the more interesting and better. He helped me understand my Lithuanian heritage, and the country as it was, and now is.\n\nThis was a great tour. Being able to see the three places gave me different perspectives on Lithuania. The guide was incredible and knowledgeable about each location. The lunch was delicious and authentic.\n\nThis was a great tour.

My guide, Giedirus, was a smart, personable companion (he’s also a university teacher, which is always good) who took me off the beaten paths to see the city, the beautiful countryside, and the fairy tale Castle at Trakai. Kernave was a especially interesting addition to this tour because it sets up a missing part of the story that most people don’t see about how Lithuania became a culture during its pagan origins. Great tour!\n\nWow. What a tour. I learned so much about the history of Lithuania and about Lithuania today. Trakai is a must see, and Karnave is quite lovely -- that alone made the trip worthwhile.
