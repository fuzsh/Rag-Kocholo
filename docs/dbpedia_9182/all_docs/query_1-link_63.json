Optional private transfer from the airport to the hotel. Check in to the hotel.\n\nOvernight: Vilnius\n\nDAY 2: DISCOVER VILNIUS\n\nVilnius is a lively and vibrant Baltic capital that offers a great contrast – the Old Town charms you with wonderful gothic, renaissance, baroque, and neoclassical architecture gems, while other parts of the city are known for a buzzing alternative culture scene. Lithuania is very proud of its history as the Grand Duchy, and many cultural monuments in Vilnius still speak of these times. One is Gediminas Tower, a very distinctive landmark of Vilnius that offers a wonderful panorama of the Old Town. Another important monument is Vilnius Cathedral, an impressive neoclassical building that once served as the coronation place of the Grand Dukes, but today is the main Catholic cathedral in Lithuania. Vilnius is especially famous for its sophisticated baroque architecture. To see the most outstanding examples of this richly decorated style, visit the Church of St. Peter and St. Paul, the Church of St. Catherine, the Church of St. Archangel Raphael, the Church of St. John, the Church of St. Theresa, and wander around the Old Town.\n\nRight next to the Old Town lies the self-declared artists’ republic Uzupis, a very charming bohemian district with its own “constitution”, “president”, “flag” and even “money”. One EurUzas, the local currency, is worth one pint of beer. Uzupis is full of art pieces on the streets and secret artists’ yards, and it offers many exciting discoveries that reveal themselves only to the most attentive observers. Go for a leisurely walk around the Uzupis, sit at a cafe, and enjoy the creative atmosphere of the artists’ republic.\n\nOvernight: Vilnius\n\nDAY 3: VILNIUS – KERNAVE – TRAKAI – VILNIUS\n\nIn the morning, drive to Kernave where the first capital of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania once stood. Today, the Kernave Archaeological Site offers time travel through history starting from the late Paleolithic Period to the Middle Ages. In Kernave, you can see the remains of five picturesque hillforts, a reconstructed 13th – 14th-century settlement, as well as interactive expositions at the Kernave Archaeological Site Museum. Take your time and explore the history of Lithuania at this UNESCO World Heritage Site.\n\nLater, drive to Trakai and visit Trakai Island Castle, one of the main tourist attractions in the country and the symbol of Lithuanian statehood. Being built on an island on Lake Galve, one of the deepest lakes in Lithuania, the red brick medieval castle looks just like out of a fairytale. You can easily reach the castle by crossing a bridge, however, renting a boat and sailing around the castle is a very nice activity too. Trakai Island Castle used to be a residence of the Grand Dukes of Lithuania, and you can learn more about them by visiting the Trakai History Museum located in the castle. Historically, Trakai has been a very diverse town where many ethnic and religious groups have been coexisting for centuries. One of the most distinctive communities is the Karaite people, a Turkic ethnic group. Go for a walk along Karaimu Street and enjoy Karaite wooden architecture.\n\nIn the late afternoon, return to Vilnius and discover the places you didn’t manage to see yesterday: dive into one of the many museums, stroll around the most beautiful streets, look for some impressive pieces of street art, or simply find a nice and cozy restaurant, enjoy a great meal and observe the surroundings.\n\nOvernight: Vilnius\n\nDAY 4: VILNIUS – MERKINE – DRUSKININKAI\n\nMost of this day you will spend in the Dzukija National Park or very close to it. Start your day by driving to Merkine, one of the oldest settlements in Lithuania. This little town is known for the Merkine Hillfort. Once, one of the most important castles of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania stood on this hill, but today it serves as a beautiful landmark of the Dzukija National Park and offers a wonderful panorama of the confluence of the Merkys River and the Nemunas River. To see another great view, go to the nearby Merkine Observation Tower. Being twenty-six meters high, it is one of the highest viewing towers in the country. Merkine Observation Tower consists of several platforms and provides a stunning panorama of the valley of the Nemunas River, Pastraujas Island, vast forests, and Merkine town.\n\nLater drive to Druskininkai, the largest and oldest resort in Lithuania. Druskininkai is famous for its mineral waters, pine forests, fresh air, and healing mud, inviting you to relax and enjoy some refreshing health procedures. You can go to one of the countless wellness centers, spas and saunas, or choose to spend some fun time at the Druskininkai Aquapark instead. You can also rent a boat and explore the lake, or simply walk around the town and its many parks, for example, Dineika Wellness Park. If you want to acquire eternal beauty, wash your face in the Beauty Spring, the saltiest spring in Druskininkai with skin cleansing and rejuvenating properties. Apart from mineral waters, Druskininkai is also known for stunning 20th-century wooden villas which are waiting for you to discover them. To see the landscape surrounding Druskininkai, go to one of the top tourist attractions in the town – Druskininkai Cable Car which stretches across the Nemunas River, offering about eight minutes of a wonderful panorama.\n\nOvernight: Druskininkai\n\nDAY 5: DRUSKININKAI – BIRSTONAS – KAUNAS\n\nIn the morning, drive to Birstonas, another famous mineral water resort. To explore the best of Birstonas, we suggest choosing one of the walking routes. A great place to enjoy relaxing mineral water therapy is the mineral water pavilion Villa Birute. Simply lie down and enjoy the healthy air and the calming sound of running water. Another unique place not to miss is the Druskupis mineral water facility which offers a very special air therapy, similar to breathing the seaside air. If you are brave enough to drink some of the mineral waters, visit Versme Spring or Birute Spring. Later, you can go for a leisurely walk along the Nemunas River, visit Kneipp Garden and enjoy body-strengthening activities, look for historical architecture, or climb to the top of the Vytautas Hill, a hillfort that offers a wonderful panorama of the town and the river. If you feel like climbing three hundred steps up to see an even more stunning panorama, go to the Birstonas Observation Tower. It provides a view of the most beautiful part of the Nemunas River – its famous curves.\n\nIn the afternoon, drive to Kaunas, the second-largest city in Lithuania known for its Interwar architecture, mostly Art Deco, amazing pieces of street art, as well as the only invisible and inaccessible square in the world that was inspired by the Fluxus art movement – George Maciunas Square. To see the greatest examples of Art Deco and other Interwar architecture, it is best to follow one of the walking routes. An exciting walking route is also created for street art lovers, but one of the must-see places is the Yard Gallery. Follow the map and explore the beauty of Kaunas!\n\nOvernight: Kaunas\n\nDAY 6: DISCOVER KAUNAS\n\nSpend the whole day in Kaunas. Keep exploring Art Deco and street art jewels, but don’t forget to stroll around the Kaunas Old Town too. Walk along Vilniaus Street, a lively pedestrian avenue full of cozy shops and lovely stores, and visit the Town Hall Square and House of Perkunas, as well as other sights in the Old Town. Later, go to the Kaunas Castle built right at the confluence of the Nemunas River and the Neris River. It is one of the first stone castles in Lithuania, but today it serves as a museum telling the history of Kaunas and even offering to meet the ghost of the castle. If you are an art lover, spend some time at M.K.Ciurlionis National Museum of Art, one of the oldest and largest art museums in Lithuania that allows you to see the development of Lithuanian art throughout the centuries. The museum is especially proud of a great artwork collection of M.K.Ciurlionis, the most famous Lithuanian artist. You can also choose some of the other popular museums: Kaunas City Museum Folk Music Branch, Kaunas Picture Gallery, or Kaunas Photography Gallery. To get the best panorama of the city, go to the Aleksotas Hill either on foot or by the Aleksotas Funicular. If you feel like exploring a darker period of history, it is worth visiting the impressive Ninth Fort, part of Kaunas fortress that was built in the 20th century as a defensive fortification but later turned into a prison and place of mass murders of Jews.\n\nOvernight: Kaunas\n\nDAY 7: KAUNAS – VENTE – KLAIPEDA\n\nStart your day by driving to Vente Cape, a peninsula at the Curonian Lagoon that is home to one of the oldest bird ringing stations in Europe. Vente Cape is located in the area that serves as the main migration route for Lithuanian birds, so it is a perfect place for observing, catching, and ringing birds. You can visit the small museum at the ornithological station and get to know more about bird migration and ringing. While visiting Vente Cape, don’t miss out on the opportunity to climb to the viewing platform of the Vente Cape Lighthouse, one of the few Lithuanian lighthouses available for visitors, and enjoy a scenic panorama of the dunes of the Curonian Spit and such villages as Nida and Preila.\n\nLater drive to Klaipeda, a lively and colorful port town full of fishing boats, yachts, and ships. Klaipeda has a very distinctive architectural style strongly influenced by Germans, and that makes Klaipeda very different from any other Lithuanian town. Go for a walk around Klaipeda Old Town and fall in love with cozy architecture, cobblestone streets, and countless sculptures that hide in the most unexpected places: on the rooftops, on the street corners, and on the walls. Later enjoy the promenade along the Dane River. It is a lovely place for leisurely walks that offers a romantic port-town atmosphere with sailing boats in the river, countless cafes and restaurants, and old warehouses standing on the shores. If you feel like exploring the town’s history, visit the Klaipeda Castle Museum.\n\nOvernight: Klaipeda\n\nDAY 8: KLAIPEDA – CURONIAN SPIT\n\nIn the morning, take a ferry that will bring you to the Curonian Spit, a long and narrow sandspit stretching for almost a hundred kilometers between the Curonian Lagoon and the Baltic Sea. If you would like to get to know more about sea life and maritime history, as well as enjoy very fun dolphin and sea lion performances, we suggest spending the first half of the day at the Lithuanian Sea Museum, Aquarium, and Dolphinarium. In this place, time will fly in the blink of an eye – it is a very interactive and engaging museum with many topics to discover and many sea creatures to observe and adore.\n\nLater drive to Juodkrante and go for a walk along the promenade, as well as explore beautiful wooden villas, hiding in this lovely village. If you are interested in wooden sculptures and Lithuanian mythology, visit the Hill of Witches, one of the most popular tourist attractions on the Curonian Spit. Not far from Juodkrante, you will find another tourist attraction with a spooky atmosphere – the Grey Heron and Cormorant Colony.\n\nOn your way to Nida, stop by a truly wonderful place for discovering the magical charm of dunes – Naglia Nature Reserve and its dead dunes that once buried several villages under sand. As this is a strictly protected area, you should follow the Nagliai Cognitive Trail to visit the dead dunes and feel like in a real desert.\n\nIn the evening, enjoy the peaceful atmosphere of Nida.\n\nOvernight: Nida\n\nDAY 9: CURONIAN SPIT\n\nThe Curonian Spit offers a unique and diverse natural and cultural landscape: magnificent sand dunes, peaceful fishermen’s villages with lovely wooden architecture, vast pine forests, and endless beaches. Enjoy a slow morning in Nida: walk around and explore the colorful architecture and weather vanes traditional to the Curonian Lagoon, enjoy the promenade, peek inside the Fishermen’s Ethnographic Homestead, discover the surprising world of ambers at Mizgiris Amber Museum, and take a look at the Curonian Spit from the heights of Nida Lighthouse. If you are interested in literature, pay a visit to the summer house of the world-famous writer Thomas Mann. When you feel hungry, look for some smoked fish and enjoy the local flavor.\n\nUndoubtedly, one of the most spectacular places on the Curonian Spit is Parnidis Dune. Go to the observation deck right next to the Nida Sundial to enjoy the best panorama of the dune. Later, follow a small footpath and explore the beauty of Parnidis Dune by walking on it.\n\nIf you feel like going for a longer walk, you can choose one of the hiking routes and explore different villages, dunes, forests, and capes.\n\nOvernight: Nida\n\nDAY 10: NIDA – PALANGA – PLATELIAI\n\nTake a ferry back to the mainland and drive to Palanga, the most popular seaside resort in Lithuania that is often called the Summer Capital of Lithuania. This is a great place for a couple of peaceful hours at a beach or leisurely walks along Basanavicius Street, a lively pedestrian boulevard full of cafes and restaurants. The most known symbol of Palanga is the Palanga Pier, an L-shaped pier that stretches into the sea for 470 meters. Already at the end of the 19th century, the pier was dedicated for the use of pedestrians only. Today, it is the most popular place for watching the sunset, going for romantic walks, and having a panorama of the beach. In order to catch the aristocratic 19th-century resort vibe, walk around and look for historical villas.\n\nLater, stop by Plateliai, a typical Samogitian town located next to Lake Plateliai in the Samogitia National Park. Go for a walk in Plateliai to discover characteristic Samogitian town structure with a central square in the middle, as well as visit one of the oldest shrines in Lithuania – the Church of St. Peter and Paul. If you feel like hiking, go to the Seire Cognitive Walking Trail which stretches for about seven beautiful kilometers. Keep exploring the Samogitia National Park by driving around Lake Plateliai, the largest and deepest lake in Samogitia that is known for its natural and cultural value. There are several places that offer a great panorama of the region and the lake, for example, Siberija Observation Tower and Lake Plateliai Viewing Platform.\n\nOvernight: Plateliai\n\nDAY 11: PLATELIAI – SIAULIAI\n\nDrive to Siauliai and dedicate this day to exploring the city. You will see the Cathedral of St. Peter and Paul, a renaissance architectural monument, shining bright white already from far away. The best place to feel the real essence of Siauliai is Siauliai Boulevard, the pedestrian part of Vilniaus Street that is often called the Heart of Siauliai. Go for a leisurely walk along the boulevard and enjoy its charm: various sculptures, buildings from different centuries, tiny stores, cozy cafes, and restaurants create a very lively atmosphere. Siaulai offers different museums for a wide range of interests. One of the top museums in the city is Chocolate Museum Ruta, founded in an old chocolate factory building. To get to know Baltic people better, visit the interactive Baltic Culture Education Center Balts’ Road. Photography enthusiasts will appreciate the Photography Museum.\n\nOvernight: Siauliai\n\nDAY 12: SIAULIAI – HILL OF CROSSES – NAISIAI – PAKRUOJIS – AUKSTAITIJA NATIONAL PARK\n\nIn the morning, visit the Hill of Crosses, one of the most sacred Christian pilgrimage sites in Lithuania. It is believed that people have been leaving crosses of different sizes on this hill since the 1830s. In some historical periods, this activity was perceived as a resistance against the regime, but generally, the Hill of Crosses serves as a place for hope. If you want to leave a cross on the hill, but you don’t have one, don’t worry – people often create symbolical crosses from whatever they can find around, little branches, grass, or tiny stones.\n\nLater, visit another unique place – Naisiai Baltic God Park. This is an open-air museum that educates about ancient Baltic religion and pagan ways of understanding the world around us. Stroll around the park, enjoy wooden sculptures depicting different Baltic gods and deities, and explore the ancient Baltic worldview.\n\nContinue driving to Pakruojis Manor, one of the biggest, most impressive, and most beautiful manors in the Baltic States that is especially famous for its Flower Festival which takes place every summer. The manor offers time travel back to the 19th century by strolling around its splendid interiors and wonderful garden, exploring the curiosity room and clock room, peeking into the beer brewery and distillery, as well as visiting a fortune teller. If you wish, you can rent a 19th-century costume and feel like a real noble person.\n\nIn the late afternoon, drive to Aukstaitija National Park, the oldest national park in Lithuania rich with charming lakes and hills. To see rural architecture and local farmers’ lifestyle, visit such ethnographic villages as Suminai, Vaisnoriske, or Kretuonys, stop by Paluse St. Joseph’s Church, a wooden church built without any iron nails, and go to Ginuciai Watermill. One of the most famous sights in Aukstaitija National Park is Ladakalnis, a very scenic hill that provides an amazing panorama of six lakes. If you feel like hiking, you can choose one of the hiking routes and discover the beauty of the national park.\n\nOvernight: Aukstaitija National Park\n\nDAY 13: PAKRUOJIS – LABANORAS – VILNIUS\n\nIn the morning, drive to Labanoras Regional Park, the largest regional park in Lithuania. Labanoras region is famous for very picturesque landscapes with lakes and forests. One of the best places to enjoy a great view of the surroundings is Mindunai Observation Tower. As there are about seventy lakes in the Labanoras Regional Park, fishing is an important tradition, and you can learn more about it at the Lake Fishery Museum. If you feel like going on a hike, choose one of the hiking trails and explore the best of what the regional park offers.\n\nOn your way to Vilnius, visit the Europa Park, also known as the Open-Air Museum of the Centre of Europe. The park was founded by Lithuanian sculptor Gintaras Karosas, and today you can see fifty-five hectares richly decorated with contemporary art pieces created by various artists from all over the world. The art pieces are hidden between trees, exposed on hills, and exhibited in meadows. Art and nature create a charming combination, making the visit to the Europa Park a very special one. You can enjoy the peace and quiet of nature and stunning contemporary art at the same time and place.\n\nLater drive to Vilnius, and enjoy your evening in the capital.\n\nOvernight: Vilnius\n\nDAY 14: DEPARTURE FROM VILNIUS\n\nDeparture day.

He told us a lot of... interesting information and gave me the inspiration to walk across the falls. He was very considerate regarding the time to spend at each location and the speed of walking through the township. I would recommend this tour for anyone wanting to see the Latvian countryside - we really enjoyed the tour with Valdis - Thank you very much.read more\n\nDona Zavislan\n\n2023-09-25T14:40:43+0000\n\nI loved this tour and it was a highlight of my five days in Latvia. After spending a few days in Riga, I wanted to... explore more of the country and do some hiking. I considered renting a car for the day, but this tour provided just what I was looking for and so much more without the expense and hassle of a car rental and figuring out where to go. I was picked up and dropped off at my hotel and was able to enjoy the drive and an opportunity to see area surrounding Riga. Guide Valdis is a native Latvian and has a lot of experience hiking and much knowledge about the area and Latvia. The 15 K hike was rigorous, but doable. I found the park gorgeous and peaceful. We hiked through a forest, along the river, crossed bridges, explored caves and sandstone carvings and passed other notable places. Valdis made the hike very interesting with stories and he pointed out other activities available in this beautiful park and surrounding area. We stopped midday for a lovely picnic. Valdis also gave me information about other places to consider exploring in Latvia. A perfect day and I highly recommend this tour.read more\n\nTom Moore\n\n2022-11-19T14:17:21+0000\n\nHad a fantastic hike with Valdis today. He's really friendly and knowledgeable.

He has a wealth of knowledge and is always able to tell you... interesting history along the way. The route plan of the hiking is also reasonable. In autumn, the fallen leaves near Sigulda are also very beautiful. If you are planning to do an outdoor hike in Latvia too, then don't hesitate to join a walking group organized by Valdis.🇱🇻read more\n\nSheila Dunk\n\n2022-06-04T01:33:30+0000\n\nAbsolutely brilliant day out with Valdis, we didn’t stop talking from the moment he picked me up. He was knowledgeable... about the area, answered all my questions about Latvia and was just delightful to be with.The area of the hike was stunning, we got some good spots for views and pictures, the weather was beautiful and I couldn’t have asked for a better way to spend the day.

With woods that look like the one from a fairy story book and really good company it's definitely a suggested tou experience for the lovers of outdoors activities..The guide is super available and offer explanations and curiosity. Particularly useful is the description of how to reach the starting point with public transport (even with the specific schedule time).

His advance communication and arrangements were unfailingly responsive, prompt and helpful. On the trip, we had different guides as well as drivers in the different cities (Vilnius, Riga and Tallinn.) In each case, they were well-informed and on time at the meeting point. We never needed to worry or contact the guide (though we were provided with their information.) Every hotel Valdis chose for us was of a very good standard, well-run, clean, exceptionally well located, and with wonderful breakfasts. The restaurants he recommended were also excellent – we learned to just go where he suggested! The tour was an exceptionally good value. In sum, we couldn’t have been more pleased. Our trip was wonderful and we left wanting to see more of the Baltics' beauty. If we do go again, we would unquestionably work with Valdis. In the meantime, we will recommend him to all of our friends.\n\nLucía Gómez\n\nFantastic Self-Guided Hiking Experience! We recently completed a self-guided hike in Gauja National Park, which was wonderful. The trails were serene, and we rarely encountered other hikers. The provided materials and app were excellent and highly accurate. The hotels, luggage transfer, and overall transportation arrangements were flawless. Highly recommend this experience!\n\nPaul Green\n\nAnna Brish was a fantastic tour guide for understanding Jewish history and culture in Vilnius. She was friendly, deeply knowledgeable, eager to answer our questions and accommodate our specific interests. Anna does other tours and we would take any of them, she’s amazing!\n\nJames Cornez\n\nMyself and my best friend came across this company whilst researching options to travel in Latvia and we are very pleased we did. Valdis was very amenable during the planning process by arranging video calls with both of us so we could better understand what was on offer for us to do. He compiled an 8 day itinerary for us that did not disappoint starting in Riga for 2 days. We paid for an optional 3hr walking tour which was very worthwhile to see the main sites of the city. Janis took us on the tour who is a great guy that gives you plenty of interesting information, ready to answer any questions regarding Latvian history/culture. We chose the self driving option to see as much of Latvia as possible which I would definitely recommend if you want to have more than just a city break. It took us to varied places ranging from the heavily forested and pretty areas of Sigulda (where we did a fun kayaking tour on the Gauja river) and Cesis to the pleasant coastal cities of Liepaja and Ventspills. Overall, definitely the company to approach if you want to authentically explore Latvia!\n\nEsther A\n\nValdis and his team helped us to organise a guided 16 day trip across Lithuania, Latvia, Estonia and Helsinki. We had a very enjoyable experience! Coming from Singapore and not knowing Valdis beforehand, we were initially worried about language and logistical challenges. All these were unfounded as Valdis and his guides were not only knowledgeable but also responsive, helpful and flexible. We had some minor hiccups during the trip but Valdis was able to resolve them very promptly. I would highly recommend engaging Valdis for your next trip!\n\nAnnette Ihrman\n\nThe tour was very versatile and a good addition to our trip to Riga. We can recommend it!\n\nK G\n\nI joined Valdis for Gauja national park tour and experience breathtaking views, beautiful cave, Plus the experience to see the inside of luge and skeleton track. It’s an unforgettable experience to see something outside the Riga! Highly recommended!!!\n\nCarmen Daams\n\nI took the Kuldiga trip with Valdis. The experience was amazing. The entire day was great. He is a great guide, and knows a lot of interesting information. He would definitely make your whole experience even better. Kuldiga is such a captivating city, very unique with a very special style and soul. If you are visiting Latvia, don't hesitate to take this trip, it is a \"must\".\n\nStanley Wallerstein\n\nGreat Tour and great guide. Baltic Nature Travel is excellent.\n\nMaria M Andrade\n\nValdis organized an absolutely wonderful 10 day trip to Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania trip for my sister, a friend, and myself. He arranged all details including our private chofer and tour guide up the last detail. He went far and beyond when he knew I had an accident in Estonia. We met him Latvia and he make us feel welcome. He recommended the most amazing restaurants for us and he took care of my doctor needs where he was the interpreter. In every country we had the best guys one can possibly ask for. All hotels were walking distance from city centre. Thank you Valdis we will always remembered this trip!!!!\n\nLoad more\n\nLeave a review\n\nTell us about your experience!\n\nAbout the booking terms & conditions\n\nTravel insurance needed?
