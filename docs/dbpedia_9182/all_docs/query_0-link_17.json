        "text": "Overview\n\nThis tour is like a trip across the layers of time, back to the oldest recorded Lithuania history. As we can only imagine some of the heritage in this location, much has been explained by archeological reconstructions while the rest of the charm is simply felt – as astonishing views from the hilltops accent Neris river basin. Kernave is the first capital of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania mentioned in historical chronicles (the second half of the 18th century). The hill forts of Kernave are unique in the entire Baltic Sea region, as there are five on just one location. To help us travel in time to pre-christian history, this tour includes a visit to the oak tree sanctuary which has a beautifully reconstructed “old God” trail and ending the tour with a cup of tea/coffee on an astonishing bluff overlooking river Neris. If you wish, this tour can be expanded into a full day tour, which offers a deeper dive into history, art and nature walks."
