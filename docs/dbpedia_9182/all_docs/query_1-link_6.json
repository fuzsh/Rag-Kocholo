        "text": "Explore a UNESCO World Heritage Site\n\nThe Cultural Reserve of KernavÄ is included on the UNESCO World Heritage list for its authentic beauty and the exceptional historical value it preserves from the Palaeolithic era. The 15 archaeological sites and three historical monuments are on a territory covering 196.2 hectares, and the five impressive KernavÄ Hills make up one of the largest archaeological outdoor expositions.\n\nFeel free to climb the stairs to the top and try to imagine what it was like hundreds of years ago.\n\nBreathe in Ancient History\n\nEnter the archaeological open-air museum and travel back in time – homesteads with workshops and animal sheds are reconstructed and look like they’re taken straight from the 14th century.\n\nEven though archaeologists have been working at KernavÄ for over twenty years, only 2% of the cultural reserve territory has been researched. But KernavÄ has been called the Troy of Lithuania, as it preserved most of the relics intact.\n\nThe oldest hard surface road found in Lithuania shows that KernavÄ played an important role in trade relations with the Roman Empire, proven by a silver denarius of Marcus Aurelius dating from 161.\n\nExplore the Artefacts\n\nGet acquainted with prehistoric times and the Middle Ages of KernavÄ. It’s easy to imagine life in the prehistoric habitat, the thriving craft period and the golden age of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania while exploring the authentic exhibits and archaeological finds.\n\nIf you have more time, enrol in the educational programme offered by the museum. The Museum of the Archaeological Site of KernavÄ and the KernavÄ Open-air Museum are closed on Mondays, Tuesdays and national holidays.\n\nEnjoy a Medieval Feast\n\nFor a special treat, visit KernavÄ between July 5 and 7. The Live Archaeology Days in KernavÄ, an experimental archaeology festival dedicated to the KernavÄ name mentioned 740 years ago, will give you a chance to experience authentic ancient Baltic traditions, crafts, and food. You can even try your hand at making something out of clay or stone.\n\nWalk in the Largest Oak Woods\n\nOn the way to KernavÄ stop by the DÅ«kštai oak woods, the largest and one of the oldest natural oak forests in Lithuania. You will learn more about the pagan Lithuanian religion and get a glimpse of the 38 wooden sculptures.\n\nThe 200-year-old oak forest is home to many rare animal and plant species. Plus, July is the perfect time to spot the rare purple Lithuanian orchids.\n\nClimb the Karmazinai Hill-Fort\n\nOn the other side of DÅ«kštai oak forest lies the Karmazinai Mound, which offers a beautiful view of the Neris Valley, where there was once a pagan place of worship. Take a walk in the area and discover 130 burial mounds; three of them were reconstructed after archaeological excavations had been carried out there.\n\nGetting to KernavÄ\n\nBy car: take the A1 or A2 motorway from Vilnius and then either road 108 or 116.\n\nBy bus: from the Vilnius Bus Station, platforms No. 10 or 11. Check the timetable here. Buses to KernavÄ run about six times per day."
