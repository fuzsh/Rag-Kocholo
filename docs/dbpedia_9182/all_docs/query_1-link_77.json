        "text": "Kernavė, the first capital of Lithuania, is a historic town renowned for its ancient hillforts. Located about 35 kilometers northwest of Vilnius, Kernavė holds significant cultural and historical importance.\n\nThe town itself is nestled in a picturesque valley along the Neris River, surrounded by beautiful natural landscapes. It boasts a rich archaeological heritage, with evidence of human presence dating back to the 9th millennium BCE.\n\nThe Kernavė hillforts, the highlight of the town's historical significance, are a complex of five fortified settlements constructed between the 10th and 14th centuries. Serving as defensive structures, these hillforts played a vital role in the political and military history of the region.\n\nIn addition to their strategic importance, the hillforts reflect distinct architectural features. They vary in size and possess defensive walls, as well as remnants of residential structures. The archaeological excavations at the site have unearthed various artifacts, including pottery, weapons, tools, and jewelry, providing insights into the lives of the past inhabitants.\n\nThese hillforts were part of the medieval center of Kernavė, which served as the capital of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania before Vilnius took over. Today, the Kernavė hillforts stand as a testament to Lithuania's ancient history and cultural heritage, attracting visitors who seek to explore the town's fascinating past"
