        "text": "The article presents an analysis of the present state of and prospects for preserving Lithuanian manor residences. It describes the general state of historic preservation in Lithuania and surveys the history of Lithuanian manors from their initial construction until the present, revealing the impacts of political, social, and landscape changes to this heritage. The nation&#39;s turbulent history, its repeated occupations, agrarian reforms, and changes to the landscape resulted in distinctly individual Lithuanian manor residences. Because of the nation&#39;s difficult history, preservation of this heritage has been fraught with problems. However, due to a dramatic shift in country&#39;s political situation over the past sixteen years, scholars have increasingly focused on Lithuanian cultural identity, and their growing interest raises hope that this distinctive heritage will be preserved.\n\nThe construction of national museums in Lithuania can be analysed in relation to traditional conceptualizations of European nationalism which emphasize state building through the identification of an ethnic and cultural nation situated in a particular territory (Hroch 2000). Although state building is not entirely explained by theories of nationalism, this report will broadly rely on this theoretical framework. The history of Lithuanian national museums can be divided into the following stages, based on forms of national statehood, key museums and key political oppositions:\n\nInterwar Vilnius was the center of conservation district, one of eight conservation districts in Poland. The paper focuses on images of interwar Vilnius’ monument protection in historiography. Two different images are noticeable: one in the historiography of interwar Vilnius’ monuments protection, the other in the historiography of interwar Poland’s monuments protection. In the first case interwar period in Vilnius is highly evaluated as significant in the context of monuments protection in the 19th-20th c. and in interwar Poland. Contrary to this Vilnius region almost disappear and is hardly comparable to the former Galicia or Warsaw in the historiography of monuments protection in interwar Poland."
