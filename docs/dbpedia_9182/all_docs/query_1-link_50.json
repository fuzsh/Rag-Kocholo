        "text": "Proud keepers of the Grand Duchy's 500-year legacy, Lithuania is a vibrant country that flaunts bustling cities and unspoiled lands.\n\nIts cities have absorbed many influences over history: Vilnius — the capital — is filled with impressive Gothic and grand Baroque buildings, while Kaunas, the second-largest city, is a bulwark of interwar Modernist architecture. Any architecture-lover is due a visit.\n\nAnd from wind-blown dunes to mystical, emerald-green forests, Lithuanian nature is its greatest treasure. Over 33% of the country’s surface is blanketed by woods, and in combination with 30 national parks and around 90km of a pearly shoreline, the great outdoors is always within reach.\n\nHere we explore Lithuania’s vibrant heart through its culture, nature and food.\n\nA historic jewel\n\nVilnius' Gediminas Tower stands proud overlooking the city’s surrounding parks, wooded hills and architectural delights. Down below, the Unesco listed medieval Old Town (one of Europe’s largest and most well-preserved) is a feast for the eyes.\n\nNewly 700 years old, Vilnius was once the political centre of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania and its rich mix of architecture lives to tell the tale. Narrow medieval streets meander around a curious mix of Gothic, Renaissance, Baroque and Neoclassical buildings that are a testament to the many ethnic and political influences that have permeated the city throughout centuries.\n\n‘There is a church wherever you turn’, as the old Lithuanian saying goes, with 28 dotted around the Old Town alone.\n\nNear the Vilnelė River, you'll stumble upon three facing each other: St. Anne’s — which Napoleon Bonaparte sought to carry back to Paris in the palm of his hand — as well as Bernardine and St. Michael's.\n\nLikened to Montmartre in Paris, the residents of the nearby district of Užupis breathed new life into residual Soviet Bloc architecture before declaring itself a ‘republic’ on April Fool’s in 1997. The ‘republic’ has an unusual constitution which includes the rules: ‘People have the right to live by the River Vilnelė, while the River Vilnelė has the right to flow past people’ and ‘a dog has a right to be a dog’.\n\nThe founding fathers are often seen in Užupis's parliament, otherwise just a cafe where bohemians chill out. Go get your passport stamped and enjoy a bowl of Šaltibarščiai, a bright pink and refreshingly cold beetroot soup, and Cepelinai, potato dumplings shaped like Zeppelin airships, which populate the menu.\n\nThere are many ways to explore the city.\n\nAfter you've got up close and personal with Vilnius' architectural treasures, why not take to the skies in a hot-air balloon for breathtaking views of the red-roofed city and surrounding greenery?\n\nAnd, if you're feeling adventurous, meander down the Neris River in a kayak for a more frogs-eye view of Vilnius, passing beautiful cathedrals and Lithuanian forests.\n\nDown in the valley\n\nThe Neris River snakes its way through the trees like a ribbon around a present, exchanging greetings with its banks and neighboring fields. It’s shimmering waters make their way through Vilnius before heading West towards Kaunas,.\n\nIn the valley between the two lies the remains of Kernavė — once a thriving town during Lithuania’s craft period between the 13th to 14th centuries, now a Unesco World Heritage site. Its Cultural Reserve is protected for its genuine beauty and remarkable historical importance from the Paleolithic era, as well as ties to being a sacred spot for pagans. The 15 archaeological sites and three historical monuments are spread across 196.2 hectares, and the five spectacular Kernavė Hills form one of the greatest archaeological outdoor expositions in the world.\n\nPulled from the pages of an ancient fairytale, the nearby town of Trakai is surrounded by beautiful forests and the purest of water.\n\nTrakai Island Castle sits on one of 22 islands in the mesmerising Lake Galvė. The town was home to many Karaite and Tatar people from 1398, when they returned with Vytautas – the Grand Duke of Lithuania – after a victorious fight against the Golden Horde.\n\nThe lakeshore is a perfect place to demolish kibinai — a traditional Karaim pastry, which is dragon-shaped and filled with meat, vegetables or mushrooms.\n\nThe River Neris eventually reaches the photogenic city of Kaunas. Visiting the city is like stepping back in time. From the city's unique take on Art Deco to the dynamic and vibrant street art that adorns many of the city's walls, Kaunas is a city for the creatively curious. The city is an essential stop for lovers of the modern movement, with over 6000 buildings serving as arty backdrops for holiday snaps.\n\nKaunas is also home to an array of intriguing museums including the Nuclear Bunker Museum and the Devil's Museum, featuring over 3000 devils, demons and imps, largely related to Lithuanian folklore.\n\nLithuanian nature\n\nOutside the cities, Lithuania is home to nature so tranquil, some areas remain largely unspoiled by humans. From wild grasslands to ancient green forests, vast low-lying plains, and an impressive dune-lined coast, nature is its greatest asset.\n\nIf you've got the time, the best way to explore Lithuanian nature is by foot, with over 150 cognitive walkways throughout the country. Walking along such pathways, you will not only view the most fascinating natural objects, but you will also hear millions of sounds of the Lithuanian forest, dispel the mystery of the marshes, and refresh yourself with water from Lithuania’s pure streams or springs in moments of relaxation.\n\nIf hotels aren't your thing, there are lots of unusual ways to stay outdoors. If the rules of the forest or the national or regional park permit, you can set up camp or just spend half the day having a picnic on the grass: good weather, great company, tasty snacks, the smoke of the bonfire, and a beautiful place are essential for a nature outing. With over 3,000 natural lakes, rivers, a coastline, sea, and lagoon, there are several chances for water sports ranging from kayaking, boating, and fishing to sailing. So, if you enjoy the water, consider camping by a seaside or lakeside. Foraging for mushrooms and berries is also a favorite way among locals to get in touch with nature, as Lithuania’s forests are chock-full of edible gifts.\n\nThe Baltic coast\n\nTo the East, a 98km long Curonian spit separates the Baltic Sea from the Curonian Lagoon. Now a Unesco World Heritage site, legend has it that a giantess named Neringa, conjured up the sublime dunes to protect herself from a dragon, angered by her unrequited love. Today the landscape is dominated by pine forests as a result of an attempt to tame the nature, nevertheless, some of the breathtaking dunes remain, while the idyllic fisherman lodging remains one of the region’s distinctive features."
