        "text": "Kęstutis (born c. 1300—died Aug. 15, 1382, Kriavas, Lithuania?) was the grand duke of Lithuania (1381–82) who defended his country’s western borders against the Teutonic Knights.\n\nKęstutis was one of the seven sons of Gediminas, the grand duke of Lithuania (reigned 1316–41), who had built that nation into a powerful east European empire. Kęstutis fought to make his brother Algirdas (Olgierd) the official grand duke of Lithuania (1345), with himself as coruler. Thereafter, while Algirdas extended Lithuania’s territory to the south and east, Kęstutis prevented its neighbours, the Teutonic Knights, from conquering Lithuania and making it the centre of their eastern Baltic domain. Having unsuccessfully attempted in 1345 to occupy Samogitia (the land corresponding to most of present-day Lithuania), the Knights later resorted to a tactic of continual raids on Lithuanian territory. In response, Kęstutis led expeditions into their Prussian lands, and in 1370 he and Algirdas attacked the order, imposing heavy losses upon it at the Battle of Rudava. In the same year, after a prolonged dispute (1349–70) with Poland over Galicia and Volhynia, Kęstutis gained control over both regions."
