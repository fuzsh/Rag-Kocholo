        "text": "First Chapter: 'Apples From the Desert'\n\nBy SUZANNE RUTA\n\nAPPLES FROM THE DESERT\n\nSelected Stories.\n\nBy Savyon Liebrecht.\n\nTranslated by Marganit Weinberger-Rotman, Jeffrey M. Green, Barbara Harshav, Gilead Morahg and Riva Rubin.\n\n234 pp. New York:\n\nThe Feminist Press. $19.95.\n\nhe parents of Savyon Liebrecht -- who was born in Munich in 1948 -- were death camp survivors who immigrated to Israel when she was a year old. Her childhood was shadowed by their silences. Her father had another wife, and children, in Poland before the war. Who were they? What became of them? She never learned. When she did her military service on a kibbutz and then left for school in London, her father stopped speaking to her for a year. More silence. She returned to Tel Aviv, married, had children and only then began her writing career.\n\n''Apples From the Desert'' is a collection of 12 stories published in Israel between 1986 and 1992 that explore the gap between bereft parents and their conflicted children. Liebrecht has perfect pitch for certain hyperalert, abrasive patterns of Jewish speech. Her characters squabble like George's parents on ''Seinfeld,'' except their grievances are real. She takes you places you've never been before -- a Warsaw apartment right after the war, crowded with young, marriageable death camp survivors; an Israeli playground frequented by nannies who had been rabbis' daughters and then were forced into prostitution in a Nazi brothel. At her best, Liebrecht is the equal of far better-known Israeli authors like Amos Oz. She deserves to have more of her work translated, in a more consistent fashion. Five translators, of varying abilities, contributed to this edition.\n\nAmericans expect only minor epiphanies from short stories. Liebrecht wants soul-shattering revelations and last-ditch reconciliations. Pregnant situations intrigue her more than rounded characters. You can feel you're reading a screenplay (she also writes for television) that leaves it to the actors to provide nuances and idiosyncrasies that make characters come to life.\n\nIn ''Hayuta's Engagement Party'' a survivor in his 70's begins, at last, to speak of the past. For his loving daughter, his death camp tales are ''a key to the riddle that haunted her all those years.'' For the rest of the family, they're a major nuisance -- horror stories that ruin every celebration. The naive, anguished patriarch, with ''the raised hand that always heralded the lofty words,'' is a gripping figure, but Liebrecht plays him for maximum pathos. Forbidden to speak at his granddaughter's engagement party, he has a stroke and drops dead on the cake. Bitter stories in his heart, sweet frosting on his lips? It might work on television.\n\nIn '' 'What Am I Speaking, Chinese?' She Said to Him'' a wealthy matron seduces a real-estate agent in the slum apartment where her Holocaust survivor parents quarreled about sex 20 years before, while she, a terrified teen-ager, listened through the wall. Her re-enactment of her parents' bedroom drama is sad and vaguely incestuous. The real-estate agent who doesn't know what hit him adds a rueful, comic element. But again Liebrecht asks more of the story than it can give. Not only is this encounter presented as a transformative experience in the woman's life; the walls must bear witness. The mother was tormented by ugly stains on the bedroom ceiling. The daughter re-examines the stains and discovers the outlines of a pair of butterflies on the wing.\n\nWhy the awkwardness? Maybe the author, like the people she writes about, is floored by her subject, Holocaust memory. How do you portray a past that isn't even past? Maybe only outrage can answer outrage. ''La Compagnie des Spectres,'' by the French novelist Lydie Salvaire, for example, records the Beckettian rants -- funny, obscene, disturbing -- of an old woman for whom it has never stopped being 1943 in France. Liebrecht's conventional realism seems polite and constrained by comparison.\n\nExploring other fault lines in Israeli families -- secular vs. Orthodox Jews, or stay-at-homes vs. Israelis living abroad -- Liebrecht is more relaxed, and right on target. In the title story Rivka, from an Orthodox Jerusalem family, has outraged her father, a noted scholar, by running away to live with her boyfriend on a secular kibbutz. Rivka's cowed, housebound mother finally sets out to haul her wayward daughter home. On the bus into the desert, she eats an apple with a rotten core. Another sledgehammer symbol? Not quite: when the mother says the prescribed blessing over the apple, an element of subversive irony takes over. A blessing given can also be withheld. Sure enough, Rivka's wicked boyfriend turns out to be a gentle charmer, a grandson of Holocaust victims, who nurtures apples in the desert by trapping the cold night air in little plastic tents. Horticultural details ground the metaphor and give it point. Biblical allusions add resonance. Rivka's break liberates her mother, who recognizes that her own marriage has been a loveless sham. Lucidity brings dignity, if not happiness.\n\nIn ''The Homesick Scientist,'' much has been taken from an old man who has spent his life in a desert village. A son was killed in combat; a beloved nephew emigrated to America 20 years back. Then the emigre returns -- a renowned scientist who's been everywhere, done everything; but all along, it turns out, yearned only for his childhood village in the desert, where nothing ever happens. The gentle, inconclusive weighing of expectations, disappointments, time and memory, is utterly convincing.\n\nMost of Liebrecht's characters share a tragic view. Two stories, however, introduce a very different type, the technocrat -- a cool, nasty computer expert in ''A Room on the Roof,'' an arrogant army colonel in ''The Road to Cedar City.'' The colonel, a military prosecutor in the occupied territories, is the only figure in the collection without past or memory. He seems sprung from the soil like dragon's teeth, to battle every obstacle. How can this man, all anger and aggression, coexist with Liebrecht's other characters, who are all sadness and searching? He can't. His long-suffering wife in effect defects to his enemies. On a trip through Utah, she leaves him and travels with an exiled Jerusalem Arab couple and their baby. A mere gesture of protest; she'll return to her husband for the next lap of the trip. Still, the point is made. The real split in Israel, observers say, is between Jews with different visions of Israel's future. These finely wrought stories of private lives shed light on a terrifying political conflict.\n\nSuzanne Ruta is the author of a collection of stories, ''Stalin in the Bronx.''"
