        "text": "“Governing Immigration in Advanced Welfare States: The Scandinavian Case”\n\nApril 25, 2014\n\nWith Grete Brochmann\n\nScandinavian countries today face different kinds of challenges in relation to multicultural immigration. Questions of social cohesion and the sustainability of societal formation have been raised in all three countries over the past 10 to 15 years.\n\nGrete Brochmann described and analyzed the dynamics generated when these challenges meet the traditionally equality-oriented and ethnically homogeneous Scandinavian countries. She asked how the political approaches available for governance are formed by the institutional structure of the region in which the welfare state plays an essential role.\n\n“The Shoah in Israeli Culture, Memory and Politics” with Elie Wiesel and Dan Michman\n\nApril 27 - 28, 2014\n\nOur conference, “The Shoah in Israeli Culture, Memory and Politics,” took place on Holocaust Remembrance Day (Yom HaShoah). Since the topic of Israel and the Shoah is not well understood, this was a particularly meaningful opportunity to share how the subject may be treated.\n\nThe conference opened with a videotaped message from Professor Elie Wiesel, the Andrew W. Mellon Professor in the Humanities at Boston University and university professor. The author of “Night” and over 60 fiction and non-fiction books, Professor Wiesel is also the 1986 Nobel Peace Laureate.\n\nThe keynote speaker was Professor Dan Michman, modern Jewish history professor and chair of the Finkler Institute of Holocaust Research at Bar-Ilan University; head of the International Institute of Holocaust Research; and John Najmann Chair in Holocaust Studies at Yad Vashem.\n\n“Crimea and Beyond: Russia and Its Neighbors Today”\n\nMarch 27, 2014\n\nPanel discussion with Brandeis faculty experts about the current developing situation featuring:\n\nSteven Burg, Adlai Stevenson Professor of International Politics\n\nDavid Engerman, Ottilie Springer Professor of History\n\nChandler Rosenberger, Assistant Professor of International and Global Studies Program and Sociology\n\nRussia's recent annexation of Crimea has sent shock waves throughout the post-Soviet space, the European community and beyond. How are we to understand recent events in Ukraine? What is the historical background? What is the proper response? Are we looking at a new Cold War? Brandeis faculty members discussed what many are calling the most significant geopolitical event in Europe since the fall of the Iron Curtain.\n\nMarch 27, 2014\n\nDirected by Guy Ben-Aharon, artistic director and founder of the Israeli Stage.\n\nActors:\n\nWill Lyman\n\nPatrick Shea\n\nRebecca Schneebaum\n\n“Dear Sigmund and Carl” depicts the historic meeting between Freud's and Jung's sons when they agreed to publish their fathers’ exchange of letters.\n\nAfter the show there was a discussion with Savyon Liebrecht. Liebrecht is also working on another play about Freud: “Freud's Women,” which explores Freud's relationship to his wife and his sister-in-law, and their relationship to Judaism.\n\nSavyon Librecht was born in Munich in 1948 to Holocaust survivors. She grew up in Israel and studied literature and philosophy at Tel Aviv University. She writes about Israel today, the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, conflicts between religious and non-religious Jews, and the effect of the Holocaust on subsequent generations. Her books have been translated into many languages. She is the recipient of the Alterman Literary Prize for her story collection “Apples from the Desert” (1987) and the Prime Minister's Prize for Literature (1992 and 1999) and the Playwright of the Year Award (2004 and 2006).\n\nRead the Boston Globe article about Liebrecht.\n\n“Tragedy and the Tragic in German Literature, Art and Thought” — A 3-Day Symposium\n\nMarch 13 - 15, 2014\n\nKeynote by Bücher Prize winning author Felicitas Hoppe\n\nDo we live in tragic times?\n\n“America has everything ….” wrote Max Frisch, “except only one thing: a relationship to the tragic.”\n\nIs the tragic something to be pursued, like life, liberty — and happiness? Is tragedy the pursuit of unhappiness? Should we worry, should we be happy— when people pursue the tragic? Did Frisch hit the nail on the head— and miss the point? Does German culture have everything— except a healthy relationship to happiness? Is the pursuit of happiness an American way of relating to the tragic? Does tragedy express resignation in the face of things unchangeable, or a sorrow-driven rebellion against the way things are, against the way we are? Are we talking about metaphysics and art when we should be talking about ethics and politics?\n\nThe symposium was a search to define for today a phenomenon that sheds light in and on ancient Greece. Does tragic art continue to shed light— does it remain a force of enlightenment — or has it only cast its shadow on times past, more as a sign of resignation and renunciation than illumination? What sense can we make of tragedy? What sense can tragedy make of us?\n\nModerators\n\nSteve Dowden (Brandeis University)\n\nThomas Quinn (Independent Scholar)\n\nSabine von Mering (Brandeis University)\n\nMeike Werner (Vanderbilt University)\n\nParticipants\n\nIsabel Ballan (Brandeis University)\n\nJeffrey Bernstein (College of the Holy Cross)\n\nJoshua Billings (Yale University)\n\nJohn Burt (Brandeis University)\n\nWolfram Ette (University of Basel)\n\nAnke Finger (University of Connecticut)\n\nRachel Freudenburg (Boston College)\n\nGesa Frömming (Wellesley College)\n\nAbigail Gillman (Boston University)\n\nJessica Gokhberg (Brandeis University)\n\nEugene Goodheart (Brandeis University)\n\nJennifer Anna Gosetti-Ferencei (Fordham University)\n\nBarbara Hahn (Vanderbilt University)\n\nJohn T.

Portrayals can be found in personal narratives, historical writing, political rhetoric and art. Over the last century, the cinema has become the primary transmitter of the imagery of war, and it is from film that most derive their essential understanding of the nature of warfare and military history.\n\nThis panel brought together historical and artistic perspectives to discuss important questions surrounding the portrayal of war. These included: What are the challenges to portraying war historically or artistically? In what ways do the concerns of historians and directors of films overlap or diverge? What political or cultural influences shape how war is portrayed? How can portrayals of war confront or confirm the biases of the audience?\n\nExile and Persecution Series: Dr. Christiane Zehl Romero\n\nNovember 13, 2013\n\n“Exile in a Strange Land: Reality, Fiction and ‘Truth:’ Exploring Anna Seghers’ ‘The Excursion of the Dead Girls’”\n\nAs Jew and a Communist, notable 20th century writer Anna Seghers had no choice but flee Germany to France due to Nazi occupation. However, when the Germans occupied the north of France, she had to flee again from the trap that Europe had become for her. The only country which would take her in was Mexico, where she originally did not want to go. Her most famous story reflects her own — and others’ — conflicted situation as an end to exile became a distinct possibility. Seghers weaves reality and imagination to communicate important truths about an exile going “home.”\n\n“Do We need a Motherhood Quota? Women and Mothers in the German Parliament”\n\nNovember 19, 2013\n\nFeaturing Hilke Brockmann, PhD\n\nAre women and men, mothers and fathers, represented equally in the German Bundestag? Or does politics remain a male-dominated affair because the life script of most women includes children who do not fit the demanding time schedule of a politician? This question is highly relevant, given the current debate about a women's quota for leadership positions in the German economy and in the European Union. We discuss the potential advantages and disadvantages of a mother quota.\n\nDr. Hilke Brockmann is a sociologist and demographer by training, and a professor of sociology at Jacobs University, Germany. Her research deals with the causes and consequences of population aging and of subjective well-being (SWB), often equated with happiness. During her stay at Minda De Gunzburg Center for European Studies CES at Harvard, Brockmann is working on four quantitative projects which all deal with issues of subjective well-being.\n\n“New Findings from the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum Encyclopedia of Camps and Ghettos”\n\nOctober 30, 2013\n\nFeaturing Dr. Martin Dean\n\nDr. Martin Dean, of the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum’s Center for Advanced Holocaust Studies (washington, DC), discussed recent findings from the museum’s massive “Encyclopedia of Camps and Ghettos” project, volume 2, covering ghettos in German-occupied Eastern Europe. Published in 2012, the project documented more than 300 ghetto sites not previously described in English. Dr. Dean outlined some of the research methods and sources used and gave a survey of the wide variety of forced labor camps and police-run camps to be covered in the forthcoming Volumes 5 and 6, devoted mainly to more than 30,000 forced labor sites across Europe.\n\nDr. Martin Dean was born in 1962 in London. He received his doctorate in history from Queens’ College, Cambridge, in 1989 for his thesis entitled “Austrian Policy during the French Revolutionary Wars, 1796-1799.” Subsequently, he worked as a historical researcher for the British Home Office War Crimes Inquiry (1988-1989), for the Cambridge University History Faculty’s Project on Berlin during the First World War (1989-1991), and for the Australian Special Investigations Unit (War Crimes) (1989-1992). From 1992 to 1997, Dr. Dean worked as the senior historian for the Metropolitan Police War Crimes Unit in London. His publications include: “Collaboration in the Holocaust: Crimes of the Local Police in Belorussia and Ukraine, 1941-44,” “Robbing the Jews: the Confiscation of Jewish Property in the Holocaust, 1933-1945,” and “The United States Holocaust Memorial Museum Encyclopedia of Camps and Ghettos 1933-1945, vol. 2, Ghettos in German-Occupied Eastern Europe.” He has also written many book chapters and articles on the Holocaust focused mainly on the issues of ghettos, collaboration, war crimes and the confiscation of Jewish property.\n\n“Successful Reconciliation of a Divided Society: 25 Years After the Fall of the Berlin Wall”\n\nSeptember 28 - September 29, 2013\n\nContemporary Germany is one of the rare examples of successful reconciliation. Despite the fact that in parts of East Germany unification continues to be a struggle, the generation of Germans born after 1990 fully embrace their (united) German identity. There are only a few other examples of such unification: the united nation of Vietnam is one.\n\nJust like war-torn Vietnam, the reunified Germany faced hitherto unknown challenges of economic, political and social proportions. Young Germans all over the country have moved beyond the mindset of the cold war and are helping to shape a self-confident national image that first surprised their elders in its demonstration of patriotism during the 2006 soccer world cup.\n\nWhat is this new German identity about? How do young Germans today connect to their country’s past, and how do they view their future? How did/do educators, journalists, politicians and cultural institutions promote a new, forward-moving set of values? How will Germany deal with its new role as a major guarantor of peace, prosperity and security in Europe? Will the German economy be strong enough to pull its Southern European neighbors along? What happens if it won’t? How has Germany’s image abroad evolved as a consequence, and how do Germans see themselves?\n\nBy bringing together German, American and Israeli students, this project explores the lessons that can be shared from German successes in reconciliation and how the German experience can be compared to other countries or situations. Students and faculty from all three countries participated in the workshop. Following the workshop, conversations continue via the web over the course of the year in preparation for a 2-week intensive seminar held in Germany in May 2014.\n\n“The World Nuclear Industry Status Report: Rethinking the Nuclear Renaissance Worldwide”\n\nOctober 16, 2013\n\nFeaturing Mycle Schneider\n\nThe plummeting natural gas prices, sovereign debt crisis, proliferation concerns and improved economic conditions for renewable energy sources have created a challenging global environment for nuclear power. Contrary to what the nuclear industry would have us believe — that we are seeing a global renaissance in nuclear power — nuclear power the world over is on the decline. This is especially true in the U.S., where operating reactors are being closed as uneconomic for the first time in 15 years. The World Nuclear Industry Status Report provides a vital reality check to the current situation of the global nuclear industry, as well as identifying important nuclear trends.\n\nMycle Schneider is an independent international consultant on energy and nuclear policy, based in Paris. Mycle is a member of the International Panel on Fissile Materials (IPFM) at Princeton University, U.S. His consulting clients included the French and German Environmental Ministries, the U.S. Agency for International Development, the International Atomic Energy Agency, Greenpeace, the International Physicians for the Prevention of Nuclear War, the Worldwide Fund for Nature, the European Commission, the French Institute for Radiation Protection and Nuclear Safety. Mycle has given evidence and held briefings at parliaments in 13 countries and given lectures at 14 universities around the globe. He founded the Energy Information Agency WISE-Paris in 1983 and directed it until 2003. In 1997, along with Jinzabuto Takagi, he received the Right Livelihood Award, also known as the Alternative Nobel Prize."
