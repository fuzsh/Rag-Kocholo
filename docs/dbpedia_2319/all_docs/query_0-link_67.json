Amongst the works published by Balai Pustaka in the 1920s ; there are most popular works namely Sitti Nurbaya (1922 ; Azab dan Sengsara(1927 and Salah Asuhan (1928 representing the tone of 1920s literary productions. This paper aims to look at images of women in those three works written by male authors ; using feminist literary criticism. By means of close reading technique; the study uses feminist literary criticism to examine and (reexamine the images of women portrayed in those three works. The finding shows that on one hand some women are still trapped with the shackle of patriarchy, but, on the other hand, some women are not simply passive victims of patriarchy: these women still attempt to escape from the patriarchal chain and cut out the patriarchal oppression. Key Words: modern Indonesian literature; 1920s; Balai Pustaka; women; feminist literary criticism Abstrak: Sastra Indonesia modern dapat dikatakan lahir sekitar tahun1920-an dengan publikasi karya sastra Indonesia modern oleh Balai Pustaka.

However, since the beginning, an instructive conditioning was attributed to childrenâs and young peopleâs literature, placing it often in the educational field. Thus, the feminist movement dealt with the revision of many of these texts, within the context of activities in favour of coeducation. Galician literature was not an exception, so this paper aims to review the tasks carried out by feminists in order to analyze the existing books and streng then a new childrenâs and young adult literature\n\nFeminist Studies / Activities in Japan: present and future\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nKazuko Takemura\n\n2010-01-01\n\nFull Text Available The essay provides an overview of feminist studies in Japan nowadays, exploring in particular how new perspectives on sexuality and postcolonial theory have been gradually incorporated into feminist studies since the 1990s. In relation to sexuality, approaches to gender-sexuality have been enriched by the incorporation of new theories from areas such as literary criticism, art or history, among others. This has allowed for new critical examinations of heterosexism and of questions about gender and sexuality, and has eventually derived in the institutionalization of feminist studies with a poststructuralist influence in the Japanese academia. The article also analyzes the incorporation of postcolonial studies into feminist studies, as well as the impact that the question of prostitution during the war has had on them.\n\nFeminist Film Theory and Criticism.\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nMayne, Judith\n\n1985-01-01\n\nDiscusses Laura Mulvey's 1975 essay, \"Visual Pleasure and Narrative Cinema,\" and the ideas about feminist film theory and psychoanalysis as a critical tool which it raises.

In order to convey this, this essay attempts to define literary criticism as a genre that parodies the literary text it aspires to examine. Mikhail Bakhtinâs analysis of the novelistic discourse is useful to establish a connection between parody and criticism. Although Bakhtin discusses the novel, I ascertain that his arguments may be applied to the description of criticism as a parodic-travestying genre. Secondly, this paper discusses Linda Hutcheonâs work, which states that parody is a repetition of the original text. According to Hutcheon, this repetition implies a critical distance with the parodied text, which marks difference rather than similarity.\n\n89 ESTABLISHING THE NEXUS BETWEEN LITERARY CRITICISM ...\n\nAfrican Journals Online (AJOL)\n\nProf Alex C Asigbo\n\nliterary critics to base their work on literary theories in order to make their ... years there has been a great surge of such thinking, much of which challenges ... of the effect produced upon the critic by the book he is .... engaging in their work.\n\nâTelling Feminist Storiesâ and the Reconstruction of the Recent Feminism\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nLiane Schneider\n\n2009-01-01\n\nFull Text Available This essay discusses the article âTelling Feminist Storiesâ published by Claire Hemmings in Feminist Theory, trying to verify the ways through which the construction/deconstruction of the story of recent feminist discussed by the author influences (or not the more frequent circulation of some texts considered fundamental for the structuring of feminist studies. We also discuss the way references influence the consolidation of specific theories, mainly those connected to the poststructuralist perspective. We discuss the main points defended by the author, exemplifying our agreement or disagreement through examples taken from the critic-literary sphere.\n\nNurturing \"Critical Hope\" in Teaching Feminist Social Work Research\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nAnderson-Nathe, Ben; Gringeri, Christina; Wahab, Stephanie\n\n2013-01-01\n\nDespite the congruence between critical feminist values and the cardinal values of the social work profession, feminist research in social work has lagged behind its feminist cousins in the social sciences, particularly in terms of critical uses of theory, reflexivity, and the troubling of binaries.

Article presents a qualitative method with its purpose to present a survey to this new literary term and probe into what may lie behind this new critic perspective. Analysis was done by exploring the new literatures in terms of paratext. It can be concluded that paratext has a great influence to the deeper understanding from different perspectives of a literature work.Â\n\nQuantitative criticism of literary relationships.\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nDexter, Joseph P; Katz, Theodore; Tripuraneni, Nilesh; Dasgupta, Tathagata; Kannan, Ajay; Brofos, James A; Bonilla Lopez, Jorge A; Schroeder, Lea A; Casarez, Adriana; Rabinovich, Maxim; Haimson Lushkov, Ayelet; Chaudhuri, Pramit\n\n2017-04-18\n\nAuthors often convey meaning by referring to or imitating prior works of literature, a process that creates complex networks of literary relationships (\"intertextuality\") and contributes to cultural evolution. In this paper, we use techniques from stylometry and machine learning to address subjective literary critical questions about Latin literature, a corpus marked by an extraordinary concentration of intertextuality. Our work, which we term \"quantitative criticism,\" focuses on case studies involving two influential Roman authors, the playwright Seneca and the historian Livy. We find that four plays related to but distinct from Seneca's main writings are differentiated from the rest of the corpus by subtle but important stylistic features. We offer literary interpretations of the significance of these anomalies, providing quantitative data in support of hypotheses about the use of unusual formal features and the interplay between sound and meaning. The second part of the paper describes a machine-learning approach to the identification and analysis of citational material that Livy loosely appropriated from earlier sources. We extend our approach to map the stylistic topography of Latin prose, identifying the writings of Caesar and his near-contemporary Livy as an inflection point in the development of Latin prose style. In total, our results reflect the integration of computational and humanistic methods to investigate a diverse range of literary questions.\n\nThe potential of critical feminist citizenship frameworks for ...\n\nAfrican Journals Online (AJOL)\n\nThere is a paucity of South African literature that uses feminist critical approaches as a conceptual tool to examine intersections of social justice and citizenship.

The polemic played a significant role in the development of modern Polish literary criticism. The matter of dispute was a new method of literary criticism announced by Kridl in his renowned Introduction to the Research of Literary Work (1936. The main topics of the discussion were the problems of the literary process, the evaluation of a literary work and the uses of scientific methods in humanities. The paperâs author pays attention especially to the rhetorical and literary means of argumentation which were used in the creation of this unusual form of non-fiction.\n\nDatabase in Theory and Practice: The Bibliography of Irish Literary Criticism\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nHowell, Sonia\n\n2013-01-01\n\nFocusing on \"The Bibliography of Irish Literary Criticism\" (BILC, 2010), a bibliographical database of Irish literary criticism developed by humanities and information and communications technology (ICT) researchers in NUI Maynooth, this chapter investigates the opportunities and implications afforded the field of Irish literary studiesâ¦\n\nLiterary and Electronic Hypertext: Borges, Criticism, Literary Research, and the Computer.\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nDavison, Ned J.\n\n1991-01-01\n\nExamines what \"hypertext\" means to literary criticism on the one hand (i.e., intertextuality) and computing on the other, to determine how the two concepts may serve each other in a mutually productive way.

There is shown that the parody, according to the creative invention of its author, has the purpose to expose and then to deride the certain disadvantages of on original poetic text; however, in closer reading, it seems to maintain a critical paradigm. First of all, this paradigm reveals all of the noticed flaws as the remedy to make âthe creative prophylacticsâ for a future poet; second, it helps a reader to comprehend as well the positive features of a parodied text (particularly, in reading an original, and also to imagine the image of an author (of either the original or the parody opened to further interpretations. The subjects of studies in this article are Ukrainian literary parodies published throughout the 20th â the beginning of the 21st centuries (authors â Ostap Vyshnia, V. Yaremenko, Yu. Ivakin, A. Bortnyak, I. Havryliuk; there are also analyzed several poetic works that are not parodies a priori, but tend to deride some realia of the authorsâ everyday life. There was shown that the efficiency of literary criticism could be defined by not only what the critic said, but also how one did it. Therefore, elucidation of a parody seems to be impossible without studying its generic, stylistic, imagery and compositional characteristics of a potential parody object (original verse work, including the specifications of development of a poetâs individual style within parodying any kind of literary works.\n\nCritical Thinking, Bias and Feminist Philosophy: Building a Better Framework through Collaboration\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nAdam Dalgleish\n\n2017-12-01\n\nThese are damning charges that warrant a response within critical thinking frameworks. We suggest that the broader critical thinking literature, primarily that found within contexts of critical pedagogy and dispositional schools, can and should be harnessed within the critical thinking literature to bridge the gap between classical and feminist thinkers. We highlight several methods by which philosophy can retain the functionality of critical thinking while mitigating the obstacles presented by feminist critics and highlight how the adoption of such methods not only improves critical thinking, but is also beneficial to philosophy, philosophers and feminists alike.\n\nWhat Do Feminist Critics Want?

(HTH)\n\nManaging menopause: a critical feminist engagement.\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nGuillemin, M N\n\n1999-12-01\n\nFeminist critiques of menopause have been beneficial in opening up important public health debates around menopause. One of the most contentious public health issues concerns the use of Hormone Replacement Therapy (HRT) for the prevention of osteoporosis, heart disease and, more recently, Alzheimer's disease, in postmenopausal women. For preventive purposes, it is recommended that women should take HRT for 10-15 years and preferably remain on the therapy for the remainder of their lives. This is despite reported increased cancer risks associated with HRT, side effects and considerable cost of the therapy. Various studies have shown that up to 50% of women stop taking HRT after 9-12 months. These figures are used in the medical literature as an indication of women's non-compliance. Extending earlier feminist critiques around menopause and HRT, this paper discusses a critical feminist engagement around issues of women's perceived non-compliance with HRT.\n\nFrom the Inside Out: On First Teaching Women's Literature and Feminist Criticism.\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nBogdan, Deanne\n\n1989-01-01\n\nRuminates on and analyzes the author's experiences in teaching the first course in women's literature and feminist criticism at the Ontario Institute for Studies in Education.

The feminist view found in Pride and Prejudice is well-supported in literary criticism yet little discussion has focused on Elizabethâs feminism as seen in the prominent contrast to her female foils within the novel, namely Caroline, Jane, and Charlotte. Each of these women conforms to the socially imposed gender norms of Regency England, while Elizabeth artfully challenges gender inequality. As other women adapt their views to increase their chances of marriage, Elizabeth persistently refuses to capitulate. Defying traditional gender norms, Elizabeth affirms her feminist perspective by helping to shape Mr. Darcyâs moral character to match her own. Elizabeth inspires Mr. Darcy to set aside the pride he has in his high station in society in order to win her affections and take her hand in marriage. I argue that Elizabethâs character is not feminist in isolation, but is understood only in contrast to Caroline, Jane, and Charlotte. This claim is supported by an in-depth comparison of Elizabeth and each of the female foils.\n\nUit die oogpunt van ân vrou? Perspektief op feministiese literÃªre kritiek in die kader van die Airikaanse prosa\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nJ. W. du Plessis\n\n1991-05-01\n\nFull Text Available Feminists feel that in literary criticism not enough consideration is given to feminism as an ideology in the production of texts. According to them, existing literary criticism is strongly man-centred. This is especially true of the practice of South African literary criticism. Although feminism does not have at its disposal a formulated feminist literary criticism, a great deal of research has been done in this direction abroad. This is especially the case in Europe and America. Feminist literary critics apply themselves to the representation of the woman in works by male authors and an analysis of feminine experience in the production of texts by women. This article is an exploration of the Anglo-American and French approaches in feminist literary criticism. An attempt is made to formulate the aims of a possible South African feminist literary criticism in order that not only the general norms, but also the feminist codes in the production of a text, speak towards the final interpretation of a work.\n\nFeminist Scholarship: Cross-Disciplinary Connections for Cultivating a Critical Perspective in Kinesiology\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nReifsteck, Erin J.\n\n2014-01-01\n\nKinesiology has not been a particularly inviting space for feminist critical analysis.

Further, this integration of critical and feminist pedagogies and standpoint theory allows educators to model multicultural democracy and hone the tools of democratic citizenry with students in an emergent process that connects poli...\n\nNeurofeminism and feminist neurosciences: a critical review of contemporary brain research.\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nSchmitz, Sigrid; HÃ¶ppner, Grit\n\n2014-01-01\n\nTo date, feminist approaches to neurosciences have evaluated the debates surrounding practices of knowledge production within and research results of contemporary brain research. Consequently, neurofeminist scholars have critically examined gendered impacts of neuroscientific research. Feminist neuroscientists also develop research approaches for a more gender-appropriate neuroscientific research on several levels. Based on neurofeminist critique feminist neuroscientists aim to enrich neuroscientific work by offering methodological suggestions for a more differentiated setup of categories and experimental designs, for reflective result presentations and interpretations as well as for the analysis of result validity. Reframing neuro-epistemologies by including plasticity concepts works to uncover social influences on the gendered development of the brain and of behavior. More recently, critical work on contemporary neurocultures has highlighted the entanglements of neuroscientific research within society and the implications of 'neurofacts' for gendered cultural symbolisms, social practices, and power relations. Not least, neurofeminism critically analyses the portrayal of neuro-knowledge in popular media. This article presents on overview on neurofeminist debates and on current approaches of feminist neurosciences. The authors conclude their review by calling for a more gender-appropriate research approach that takes into account both its situatedness and reflections on the neuroscientific agenda, but also questions neurofeminist discourse in regards to uses and misuses of its concepts.\n\nUsing \"The Giving Tree\" To Teach Literary Criticism.\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nRemler, Nancy Lawson\n\n2000-01-01\n\nArgues that introducing students to literary criticism while introducing them to literature boosts their confidence and abilities to analyze literature, and increases their interest in discussing it.

This paper analyses the different perspectives women authors used to approach both Cervantes and his work. Strict literary criticism coexists with the exploration of Don Quixoteâs main characters in the philosophical and literary essays of MarÃ­a LejÃ¡rraga, Matilde Ras, Concha Espina and Carmen de Burgos. The authors studied include intheirs texts their social concerns and feminist ideology and give their opinion about key political and intellectual debates affecting society at the beginning of the twentieth century.\n\nBenedito Nunes and the Modern Brazilian Literary Criticism (1946-1969\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nMaria de FÃ¡tima do Nascimento\n\n2013-08-01\n\nFull Text Available The research analyzes the literary criticism of Benedito Nunes and is divided in two parts. It is based on a variety of textual genres (attempts to write novels, poems, aphorisms, chronicles on science, poetry and philosophy, interviews, criticism on poetry and novels. In other words, on the first texts of Nunes, published in the newspaper âFolha do Norteâ (1946-1951, where he started the career as literary critic, in the magazines âEncontroâ (1948 and âNorteâ (1952, and in other Brazilian newspapers, such as âJornal do Brasilâ, âO Estado de SÃ£o Pauloâ and âO Estado de Minas Geraisâ. Nunesâ first books are also analyzed, âO mundo de Clarice Lispectorâ (1966 and âO dorso do tigreâ (1969, for which he was acclaimed one of the exponents of literary criticism in the second half of the 20th century in Brazil, mainly of authors that published from the decade of 1940 on, namely, Clarice Lispector, GuimarÃ£es Rosa and JoÃ£o Cabral de Melo Neto. The compilation of texts published in newspapers enables the identification of the main readings of Benedito Nunes, which were incorporated to his work, such as the Christian philosophers, Saint Thomas Aquinas, Pascal and SÃ¸ren Kierkegaard, who will be constant in the writings of Nunes. The compilation also makes possible to trace the intellectual trajectory of Nunes, especially as literary critic. He after added to his work the ideas of Jean-Paul Sartre and Martin Heidegger. Regarding Heidegger, who Nunes studied throughout his life, it is possible to consider the ontological conception of artistic creation by verbal language, which, according to the German philosopher, corresponds to the foundation of the self by the word. The first part of this research analyzes the intellectual trajectory of Benedito Nunes as well as the material compiled in newspapers and in his first books. The second part presents a sample of the compiled material.\n\nClassification and Criticism of Nigeria Literary Drama | Iwuchukwu ...\n\nAfrican Journals Online (AJOL)\n\nNigerian drama has gained prominent and permanent position on the world literary map especially with the winning of the Nobel Prize by Wole Soyinka.

Haarhoff\n\n1979-03-01\n\nFull Text Available A Christian approach to literature is easily confused with a theological approach. There are many dangers implicit in such an approach. Sallie McFague TeSelle says the following about theologians who presume to violate the bounds of both theology and literature by attempting literary criticism: âThere is no reason to suppose that those trained in theology, or philosophy for that matter, are likely to possess, what is essential to the practice of literary criticism, that âsensitiveness of the intelligenceâ described by Matthew Arnold as equivalent to conscience in moral matters. A theological training seems to have a disabling effect and has subsequently to be struggled against when literary criticism is the concern.â (TeSelle 1966:4.\n\nAfra-Hispanic Writers and Feminist Discourse.\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nDeCosta-Willis, Miriam\n\n1993-01-01\n\nExplores Afra-Hispanic literature, the writing of black Spanish-speaking women of the Caribbean and Central and South America.

In this essay I look at how her literary representations negotiate religious and feminist discourses in doing so.

The critical view of psychoanalysis as the literary criticism tool in the Russian culture is presented. Through the systematization of complementary contexts and psychoanalytic interpretation the myth about F. M. Dostoyevskyâs epilepsy as a source of his creativity is discredited; though by recognition of the writer, personal problems and neuroses nevertheless were reflected in his works. The hypothesis of the opposite influence of creativity of F. M. Dostoyevsky on S. Freudâs concept, i.e. formation of psychoanalysis under impact of art creativity is made.Scientific novelty. Methods of engaging of an intertextual and socio-cultural environment are known in linguistics and literary criticism long ago. However, diverse environments of existence of the personality and works of the artist as the unified system of contexts psychological in essence have not been considered yet. The novelty of the proposed way of a research consists in systematicity of formation of a complex of contexts of the studied phenomenon that makes it possible to correlate the diversified information through its origin. As a result, the researcher receives a number of complementary descriptions in the spirit of Â«the principle of a complementarityÂ» by N.

Through an examination of recent production of interdisciplinary feminist and cultural theory journals, I suggest that despite a rhetorical insistence on multiple feminisms, Western feminist trajectories emerge as startlingly singular. In particular, I am critical of an insistent narrative that sees the development of feminist thought as a relentless march of progress or loss. This dominant approach oversimplifies the complex history of Western feminisms, fixes writers and perspectives within a particular decade, and repeatedly (and erroneously positions poststructuralist feminists as âthe firstâ to challenge the category âwomanâ as the subject and object of feminist knowledge. Rather than provide a corrective history of Western feminist theory, the article interrogates the techniques through which this dominant story is secured, despite the fact that we (feminist theorists know better. My focus, therefore, is on citation patterns, discursive framings and some of their textual, theoretical and political effects. As an alternative, I suggest a realignment of key theorists purported to provide a critical break in feminist theory with their feminist citational traces, to force a concomitant re-imagining of our historical legacy and our place within it.\n\nAcknowledging the Infrasystem: A Critical Feminist Analysis of Systems Theory.\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nCreedon, Pamela J.\n\n1993-01-01\n\nExamines the absence of a critical feminist perspective in the application of systems theory as a unifying model for public relations.

After an initial break with readersâ expectations, criticism of the magical realism and other aspects of the prose of GarcÃ­a MÃ¡rquez soon (from 1975 began to develop in Serbia, and intensified in the later seventies of the last century as well as at the end of the first decade of the 21st century, when a series of essays, reviews, articles and studies were published on the novels, stories, reportages, essays and memoirs of GarcÃ­a MÃ¡rquez, including his journalistic work. Half of the texts written by Serbian critics for literary journals came out in Belgrade, especially in KnjiÅ¾evna reÄ (The Literary Word, the most prolific authors being Radomir IvanoviÄ and Branko AnÄiÄ. The judgment of Serbian critics, presented in the literary magazines, which was based frequently on the latest advances in narratology, genealogy and comparative literature, has contributed greatly to the shaping of readersâ expectations not only regarding Gabriel GarcÃ­a MÃ¡rquezâs prose but also new Latin American narrative in general.\n\nFeminist music therapy pedagogy\n\nDEFF Research Database (Denmark)\n\nHahna, Nicole; Swantes, Melody\n\n2011-01-01\n\nThis study surveyed 188 music therapy educators regarding their views and use of feminist pedagogy and feminist music therapy.

In present time, the ability to master a language is vital for a language is a powerful means of Â communicating. Most of us will not focus on the language present in the literature part because our mind sets only towards the grammar. This has made both the teacher and students to ignore the literature part and made them to focus only on grammatical part to learn language. The urge behind using literary works in the teaching a language is to argue that the current attempts to implant literary works to the teaching of a language definitely develop studentsâ critical thinking in such a way that help them to easily master a particular language. Learning literary works in a classroom not only make the students learn about a story but also study how the language are structured and how its structured bring a great difference in meaning. Through a literary works student sees the language of real-life contexts. They learn the feelings, ideas, and experiences of linguistics components that give a realistic touch and help them to learn a language in a comprehensive way. It is also found that using literary works in the teaching learning process can improve studentâs ability both in micro-linguistics and macro-linguistics.\n\nUniting the Spheres: Modern Feminist Theory and Classic Texts in AP English\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nDrew, Simao J.

Phillips\n\n1983-01-01\n\nFull Text Available Equally as demanding of others as he was of himself, Juan RamÃ³n JimÃ©nez conceived of literary criticism as a serious and exacting task. The critic and the poet, standing side by side, are devoted to complementary activities of mutual enrichment. However fragmentary and partial the critical opinions of Juan RamÃ³n may be (also outspoken and polemical in nature, they are invaluable as a personal historical and aesthetic guide to about fifty or sixty years of Hispanic literary development (1900-1960. Not to take them into account is to fail to recognize a highly important aspect of his total artistic personality. These varied critical texts are a product of a first rate intelligence and the sensibility of a writer of consummate discrimination who was endowed not only with an excellent memory but also a very special talent for appreciating the authentic. Juan RamÃ³n as a critic is quick to praise (San Juan, BÃ©cquer, Dario, Unamuno and Machado and at the same time strong in his censure of certain contemporaries. Several recently collected volumes of miscellaneous critical materials have resolved the bibliographical muddle for the initial study of this fundamental aspect of the poet, but still particularly important are the expressionistic portraits of EspaÃ±oles de tres mundos , longer tributes to Valle, Ortega and Villaespesa as well as the extensive lectures delivered in his latter years. Examination of these pages gives us an historical and creative overview of the period in which he lived and worked in addition to original considerations about the evolution of Hispanic poetry. Of course, one of the constant focal points of his literary criticism was the modernist epoch of his early days, a movement or attitude which he considered to be a modern twentieth century renaissance. Together with detailed study of these two areas of historical and aesthetic nature, in the ensuing pages some conclusions are pointed out as to the essence of poetry\n\nIs Zaynab Alkali Merely A Feminist Writer? An Appraisal Of The Stillborn And The Virtuous Woman\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nAmase, Emmanuel Lanior\n\n2014-05-01\n\nFull Text Available Many African literary critics seem to have some preconceived notions about female writers. Consequently, there has been indiscriminate branding of some female writers either as feminists or female chauvinists. This portrays them as incapable of addressing other topical issues of national interest other than those that affect the women directly. In this paper therefore, we have undertaken an appraisal of Zainab Alkaliâs The Stillborn and The Virtuous Woman to buttress our position that the issues in her novels transcend gender imbalance. The paper examines Alkalâs treatment of the clash of westernisation, tradition and city life, political mal-administration, poor infrastructure as well as the challenging environment of the emerging cities. These are issues, which we believe, affect both male and female. The paper advocates a broader look at texts rather than the emphasis on the feminist angle in the interpretation of works by female authors at the expense of probably more important issues.\n\nFeminist Popular Education in Transnational Debates: Building Pedagogies of Possibility.

On the one hand, it is claimed that it results in relativism of the worst sort since the political commitment to feminism is prima facie incompatible with scientific objectivity. On the other hand, when critics acknowledge that there may be some value in work that feminists have done, they comment that there is nothing particularly feminist about their accounts. I argue that both criticisms can be addressed through a better understanding of the current work in feminist epistemology. I offer an examination of standpoint theory as an illustration. Harding and Wylie have suggested ways in which the objectivity question can be addressed. These two accounts together with a third approach, âmodel-based objectivityâ, indicate there is a clear sense in which we can understand how a standpoint theory both contributes to a better understanding of scientific knowledge and can provide a feminist epistemology.\n\nThe feminist approach in the decision-making process for treatment of women with breast cancer.\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nSzumacher, Ewa\n\n2006-09-01\n\nThe principal aim of this review was to investigate a feminist approach to the decision-making process for women with breast cancer. Empirical research into patient preferences for being informed about and participating in healthcare decisions has some limitations because it is mostly quantitative and designed within the dominant medical culture. Indigenous medical knowledge and alternative medical treatments are not widely accepted because of the lack of confirmed efficacy of such treatments in evidence-based literature. While discussing their treatment options with oncologists, women with breast cancer frequently express many concerns regarding treatment side effects, and sometimes decline conventional treatment when the risks are too high. A search of all relevant literary sources, including Pub-Med, ERIC, Medline, and the Ontario Institute for Studies in Education at the University of Toronto was conducted. The key words for selection of the articles were \"feminism,\" \"decision-making,\" \"patients preferences for treatment,\" and \"breast cancer.\" Fifty-one literary sources were selected. The review was divided into the following themes: (1) limitations of the patient decision-making process in conventional medicine; (2) participation of native North American patients in healthcare decisions; (3) towards a feminist approach to breast cancer; and (4) towards a feminist theory of breast cancer. This article discusses the importance of a feminist approach to the decision-making process for treatment of patients with breast cancer. As the literature suggests, the needs of minority patients are not completely fulfilled in Western medical culture. Introducing feminist theory into evidence-based medicine will help patients to be better informed about treatment choices and will assist them to select treatment according to their own beliefs and values.\n\nWriting from other margins. Difference, exception, and translation in the portuguese-speaking world: counterpoints between literary representations and critical paradigms\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nElena Brugioni\n\n2017-01-01\n\nFull Text Available Translation as a conceptual framework for the study of the so-called Postcolonial Literatures represents a complex critical paradigm that opens up a number of theoretical paths with which to read and place literary representations within a global perspective. Regarding what can be defined as African Europhone Literatures (Zabus, 2007, the concept of translation offers the possibility of problematizing several critical issues, particularly those relating to questions of âcultural differenceâ (Bhabha, 1994 and, thus, the textual âembodiment of the otherâ (Ahmed, 2000. In this respect, translation becomes an operational concept not only for a textual hermeneutic, but also for a wider epistemological reflection, allowing for a discussion of paradigms that characterize the critical reception of the African novel, and therefore the very field of African literary criticism. Through the exploration of authors and texts from the so-called Lusophone African Literatures, this article aims to draw a critical journey that highlights the theoretical possibilities that the concept of translation can offer, in order to address literary representations as crucial âepistemological experiencesâ (GarcÃ­a Canclini, 2012, 50 with which to read and understand changes, challenges and transformations of our time.\n\nMoving Forward/Looking Back: Reclaiming and Revising our Feminist Past and Searching for Solidarity\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nCassandra Denise Fetters\n\n2015-11-01\n\nFull Text Available Interweaving personal anecdotes, feminist theory, and literary and popular culture references, this article attempts to provide answers to the question of how we build a social movement and establish solidarity among women while still recognizing and respecting difference. The article traces historical accounts of feminists contending with the âdifference impasseâ and argues that we should return to and revise the feminist thought that preceded us, weaving together theories from our feminist past with contemporary models, including those of feminist psychoanalyst Jessica Benjamin and her ideas of âmutual recognitionâ and intersubjectivity. Drawing on fictional accounts from literature by women writers, the middle section of the article illustrates what intersubjective relating can mean for the feminist movement and provides a discussion of how differences and interdependencies can be sources of connection rather than division. The article ends with examples of divisions among women drawn from popular culture, wherein the author recognizes the difficulty of establishing solidarity in the face of the neoliberal cooptation of the feminist movement, the intensely materialist and individualistic images and ideas bombarding us daily, and the polarizing economic conditions faced by women today. Ultimately, the article acknowledges that finding solidarity is just a starting point, as we really need a pervasive change in consciousness.\n\nOn Literary Criticism: Looking into Noerâs Moths from the planes of light of New Critics, Russian Formalists and the Structuralists\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nHerujiyanto Herujiyanto\n\n2016-12-01\n\nFull Text Available Without denying the truth of the so-called silent enim leges inter arma [Law stands mute in the midst of arms], this paper makes use of the analytical perspectives of New Criticism, Russian Formalism and Structuralism to look into Arifin C. Noerâs play named Moths. It is admitted that literary critics often define their assumptions about literary work and the better way to go about reading it (and writing about it. The New Critics, Russian Formalists and the Structuralists are only three of them. According to Ian Ousby, the three groups can be described as formalists; they share a common conception: a work is autotelic, that is, complete in itself, written for its own sake, and unified by its form â that which makes it a work of art.1 Looking closer at the three movements, we would undoubtedly find that they are not exactly the same. The New Critics, for example, explicitly repudiated English Romanticism and its radical tradition while Russian Formalists merely attacked the utilitarian and social tradition.2 Then, Russian Formalists were concerned with the way in which the individual work of art was perceived differently against the background of the literary system as a whole. The Structuralists, however, set themselves the task of describing the organization of the total sign-system itself by dissolving the individual unit back into the langue of which it is a partial articulation.3 The end goal of this study is, thus, to find the possible ways to go about reading the play; to see how the playwright seems to write about his work; and to have a better understanding of the nature of the play.

However, both the process model of forgiveness therapy and the social-cognitive developmental model on which it is based have received criticism from feminist theorists. The current paper considers feminist criticisms of forgiveness therapy and uses a feminist lens to identify potential areas for growth. Specifically, Worell and Remer's (2003) model of synthesizing feminist ideals into existing theory was consulted, areas of bias within the forgiveness model of psychotherapy were identified, and strategies for restructuring areas of potential bias were introduced. Further, the authors consider unique aspects of forgiveness therapy that can potentially strengthen existing models of feminist therapy.

Women reaching leadership positions, even the highest, together with development of transformational leadership theory led to an increased scientific interest in relationship between gender and transformational leadership theory. Unlike dominant leadership theories, feminist theories in the past decades have offered new theoretical and research concepts that can improve our understanding of gender in the study of leadership and organizations. In this paper we have tried to research how different feminist theories, developed from the three waves of feminism, link with scientific studies of gender and transformational leadership. Thought presentation and analysis of dominant leadership theories, with emphasis on transformational leadership theory, and their analysis in feminist perspective we have tired to present how each of the feminist theories highlight a different aspect in understanding of gender and transformational leadership. In this paper we have also tried to show the theoretical and methodological advantages and disadvantages for each of the feminist theories and possible future direction of research of gender and transformational leadership.\n\nFeminist Standpoint and Question of Women Participation in Decision-Making, in Nepal\n\nOpenAIRE\n\nBinda Pandey\n\n2016-01-01\n\nFeminist standpoint theory emerged in the 1970s.

In her study GyÃ¶rgyi HorvÃ¡th discusses three aspects of the gendered regimes of authority in order to give deeper insights into how gender bias re-produces within the Hungarian context. First, she focuses on lists of literary prize winners and critical rankings of published works (showing how many women writers are present on such lists in absolute numbers and in what percentages, and how their numbers have changed over time. Secondly, she explores the practice of critique writing itself, by analyzing the book review pages in two literary journals between 2007 and 2009 focusing on cases when the issue of âgenderâ itself comes up in the rhetoric of critics trying to underpin their aesthetic judgments on a given work. And finally, she examines briefly the attitude of contemporary women writers towards Gender Studies. HorvÃ¡th concludes that Gender Studies in Hungary has not contributed significantly to increasing the prestige of contemporary women writers, most of whom, in turn, do not want to be involved with Gender Studies or feminism at all. She also points out that at present in Hungary there is a general blindness in understanding how gender/power relations permeate aesthetic judgments.\n\nâIâm a feminist, Iâm not ashamed and Iâm proudâ : young peopleâs activism and feminist identities in Estonia, Spain and the UK\n\nOpenAIRE\n\nCharles, Nickie; Wadia, Khursheed; Ferrer-Fons, Mariona; Allaste, Airi-Alina\n\n2018-01-01\n\nThis paper explores the upsurge in young people's activism across Europe by drawing on three ethnographic studies of feminist and LGBT activism. The studies include a feminist organisation, UK Feminista, in a stable liberal democracy, the Feministes Indignades in post-fascist Spain, and the LGBT movement in post-communist Estonia. The paper argues that feminist identities, both individual and collective, are critical to the feminist and LGBT movements studied; that affect, both positive and n...\n\nFeminist theory and the study of gender and education\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nAcker, Sandra\n\n1987-12-01\n\nThis paper considers the three main Western feminist theoretical frameworks â liberal, socialist and radical â and their educational applications. Examples of studies using each approach are discussed. Liberal feminists writing about education use concepts of equal opportunities, socialization, sex roles and discrimination. Their strategies involve altering socialization practices, changing attitudes and making use of relevant legislation. Critics of the liberal school point to conceptual limitations and the liberal reluctance to confront power and patriarchy. Socialist feminists analyze the role of the school in the perpetuation of gender divisions under capitalism. Major concepts are socio-cultural reproduction and to a lesser extent acceptance of and resistance to gender-based patterns of behaviour. So far socialist-feminist educational writing is mainly theoretical rather than practical and has therefore been criticized for its over-determinism and insufficient empiric foundation. Radical feminists in education have concentrated mainly on the male monopolization of knowledge and culture and on sexual politics in schools. Strategies involve putting women's and girls' concerns first, through separate-sex groups when necessary. Critics argue that radical feminism tends towards biological reductionism, description rather than explanation and also contains methodological weaknesses. Mutual criticism of perspectives seems less destructive in educational writing than in some other categories of feminist scholarship. All the theoretical frameworks are subject to the same pressures including the oppressive power of structures, the resilience of individuals, and the tension between universality (how women are the same) and diversity (how women differ on attributes like class and race).\n\nFeministische Theorien\n\nOpenAIRE\n\nBabka, Anna\n\n2004-01-01\n\nmy article provides an overview on following subjects: beginnings and backgrounds of feminist theory; literary theory, literary criticism; equality and difference; women's studies and feminism of difference in France; deconstructive feminism literary studies in the united states of america; gender studies, gay and lesbian studies, queer studies and black feminism; german reception.\n\nApplication of Freudian Concepts to the Explication of Literary Texts ...\n\nAfrican Journals Online (AJOL)\n\nThis article established and proved the age old relationship between.

Yet, if modernism compromised at times with realism or, at least, with a \"naturalistic\" version of realism, its total antipathy to the fundamentals of romanticism has been absolute. This was a modernist trend that covered both literature and criticism and a modernist characteristic that extended from German philosophers, French poets to British and American professors of literature. Names as diverse as Paul Valery, Charles Maurras and F.R. Leavis shared a common anti-romantic outlook. Many of the important modernist literary trends like the Anglo-American imagism, French surrealism, German expressionism and Italian futurism have been antagonistic not only to ordinary realism as a relic of the 19th century, but also, and fundamentally, to that century's romanticism. In nihilistically breaking with everything from the past, or at least the immediate past, they were by definition anti-romantics. Even writers like Bernard Shaw or Bertolt Brecht and critics like Raymond Williams or George Lukacs, who would generally be regarded as in the pro-realist camp, have, at times, exhibited, to the extent that they were afflicted with the modernist ethos, strong anti-romantic tendencies.\n\nFeminist Standpoint and Question of Women Participation in Decision-Making, in Nepal\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nBinda Pandey\n\n2016-10-01\n\nFull Text Available Feminist standpoint theory emerged in the 1970s. As a feminist critical theory it focuses on the relationship between the production of knowledge and practices of power. It can be considered as a blended form of Marxist feminist, critical theory and a range of social scientific disciplines. Feminist standpoint helps to understand and explain the world through marginalized, subordinated and oppressed women's point of view in the society considering them as knowledgeable. It is the process of mainstreaming their knowledge, skill and experiences. Feminist standpoint focuses on power relations, which is broadly cultivated on cultural values and assigned gender role. In this context, feminist standpoint could be a theoretical basis to mainstream women's knowledge, skill and experiences, instead of conventional way of thinking and doing things with taking into account the knowledge and experiences of dominant groups.\n\nFeminist Pedagogy Meets Feminist Therapy: Teaching Feminist Therapy in Women's Studies\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nMagnet, Shoshana; Diamond, Shaindl\n\n2010-01-01\n\nThe affective realm--including sorrow, pain, ecstasy, vulnerability, joy, and rage--is a central component of feminist teaching and learning.

Feminist Criticsâ Response to the âQueernessâ of Modernist Womenâs Writing\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nMeridith M. Kruse\n\n2013-12-01\n\nFull Text Available This article employs insights from contemporary theories of ethical reading to conduct a case study of feminist criticsâ reaction to the queerness of modernist womenâs writing. My aim is to develop a set of practices and principles for ethically responding to queerness in literary texts and everyday life, as well as contribute feminist acumen to the current claim that the humanities are the best site to train students how to do justice to texts. The introduction utilizes theories of ethical reading set forth by Jane Gallop and Eve Kosofsky Sedgwick to develop a preliminary framework of ethical response. The subsequent section provides a historical overview of feminist criticsâ reaction to the queerness of modernist womenâs literature. I then take my preliminary framework âinto the fieldâ to see what it can tell us about how Marianne DeKoven and Sandra Gilbert and Susan Gubar react toward one type of queerness: Gertrude Steinâs experimental language. In my conclusion, I employ the knowledge gained from this analysis along with my theoretical framework to offer feminist insights to the contemporary claim that the humanities are the optimal location to teach ethical reading.\n\nDo You Understand? Unsettling Interpretative Authority in Feminist Oral History\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nKatherine Fobear\n\n2016-06-01\n\nFull Text Available This article interrogates interpretative authority in feminist oral history through a critical Indigenous lens. I argue that critical Indigenous theory provides a useful and needed understanding of participantsâ agency and the active role they have in shaping the research. Feminist oral history as a methodology has a long and well-established lineage of exploring difficult questions of power in the relationship between the researcher and the participants. While many feminist oral historians have actively interrogated issues surrounding power within their own research, there are relatively few works that press beyond looking at the one-sided hierarchical relationship between the oral historian and the research participants. The first part provides a theoretical and historical overview of feminist oral history in North America and Europe. From there I bring forward Linda Tuhiwai Smithâs work on decolonizing research and the need to recognize the authority of the participants. I will review the challenges I encountered when conducting oral histories with lesbian, gay, bisexual, and trans (LGBT refugees, and discuss how critical Indigenous theory provided a useful tool in understanding, acknowledging, and representing participantsâ agency. In this way, I will intersect critical Indigenous theory with the methodology of feminist oral history and move previous discussions on power and interpretative authority away from focusing just on the role of the researcher and toward embracing the role of the participant as well.\n\nEffects of Stereotypes about Feminists on Feminist Self-Identification\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nRoy, Robin E.; Weibust, Kristin S.; Miller, Carol T.\n\n2007-01-01\n\nThis study examined whether negative stereotypes about feminists serve as a barrier to self-identifying as a feminist.

Authenticity and feminist identity in teenage feminists' talk.\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nCalder-Dawe, Octavia; Gavey, Nicola\n\n2017-12-01\n\nThis article explores how young people's feminist identities take shape in conjunction with a contemporary ideal of personal authenticity: to know and to express the 'real me'. Drawing from interviews with 18 teenagers living in Auckland, New Zealand, we examine a novel convergence of authenticity and feminism in participants' identity talk. For social psychologists interested in identity and politics, this convergence is intriguing: individualizing values such as authenticity are generally associated with disengagement with structural critique and with a repudiation of politicized and activist identities. Rather than seeking to categorize authentic feminism as an instance of either 'good/collective' or 'bad/individualized' feminist politics, we use discourse analysis to examine how the identity position of authentic feminist was constructed and to explore implications for feminist politics. On one hand, interviewees mobilized authentic feminism to affirm their commitment to normative liberal values of authenticity and self-expression. At the same time, the position of authentic feminist appeared to authorize risky feminist identifications and to justify counter-normative feelings, desires, and actions. To conclude, we explore how encountering others' intolerance of authentic feminism exposed interviewees to the limits of authenticity discourse, propelling some towards new understandings of the social world and their space for action within it.

Hermeneutic, as a researching object, includes literary, critical, theological, juridical, linguistic, psychological, verbal and sociological knowledge. Literary Hermeneutic is one of the most favored disciplines. It is venerated both in Homeric exegesis from antiquity and in the improvement of the methodology interpretation of the canonical works, in which a vain moment is textsâ deciphering â the monuments and authorsâ comment from times immemorial, thus re-establishing a part of human values. The re-establishing of the connections between the values of the past and their understanding from the present prospect is due to literary interpretation. The demands of the paradigm of the literary and artistic interpretation, constitutes a basic element which is important both for the writing of academic researches and for the literary values of understanding. It directs the student to scientific works and facilitated the professional activity of teachers, journalists, jurists and translators.\n\nJohn Deweyâs Feminist Legacy\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nMarta Vaamonde Gamo\n\n2016-07-01\n\nFull Text Available This article demonstrates how feminism welcomed and was influenced by the pragmatism of John Dewey. While in real terms his impact on European feminism has been minimal, this was not the case in contemporary America. In this article we study both how Deweyâs ideas were received amongst American feminists, as well as certain aspects of his thinking that could be enormously useful in present-day debates between critical and postmodern feminists. We compare the Deweyan and feminist arguments against the traditional dualisms that acted as philosophical support for social inequality, paying particular attention to mindâbody dualism, and the consequent undervaluation of physical and emotional wellbeing. We also show that John Deweyâs proposals were, in fact, more radical than those of the feminists of the day. Indeed, democracy has to be understood as a way of life that affects every dimension of experience, and is crucial to the personal and social growth that enables the unjust social inequalities between men and women to be overcome.\n\nUnderstanding Program Planning Theory and Practice in a Feminist Community-Based Organization\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nBracken, Susan J.\n\n2011-01-01\n\nThe purpose of this article is to discuss feminist-program-planning issues, drawing from a critical ethnographic study of a Latin American feminist community-based organization.

Whether blamed as a central reason for feminism's alleged failure or seen as an unrealistic, utopian vision, lesbian separatism is a maligned social and cultural formation. This article traces the intellectual roots of lesbian feminism from the early 1970s in The Furies and Radicalesbians through the work of Julia Penelope and Sarah Lucia Hoagland in the 1980s and 1990s, then considers four feminist and lesbian organizations that offer innovative engagements with lesbian separatism. Olivia Records operated as a separatist enterprise, producing and distributing womyn's music during the 1970s and 1980s. Two book distributors, Women in Distribution, which operated in the 1970s, and Diaspora Distribution, which operated in the 1980s, offer another approach to lesbian separatism as a form of economic and entrepreneurial engagement. Finally, Sinister Wisdom, a lesbian-feminist literary and arts journal, enacts a number of different forms of lesbian separatism during its forty-year history. These four examples demonstrate economic and cultural investments of lesbian separatism and situate its investments in larger visionary feminist projects. More than a rigid ideology, lesbian separatism operates as a feminist process, a method for living in the world.\n\nRussian-Soviet Literature of the 1960s and 1970s: Motherhood in Disguise, or A Male Anti-Feminist Rethoric for what itâs Worth\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nOlga Tabachnikova\n\n2017-12-01\n\nFull Text Available This paper looks into the Russian Soviet literature of both the âthawâ and âstagnationâ periods (1960s and 1970s in order to reassess the existing paradigm in its critical reception provided from the gender perspective. The discussion starts with consideration of the issue of motherhood â especially in the case of working mothers â and its literary treatment, but then expands to a feminist reading of the literature in question more generally. By suggesting an alternative interpretation of literary works of this period, especially those authored by male writers, the paper challenges the accepted understanding of this literature as essentially misogynistic. By revealing concealed insecurities behind hostile male rhetoric, it turns the tables round to argue that the prevailing model that arises from this literature is, in figurative terms, that of all pervasive motherhood, and as such is actually matriarchal. Thus, the suggestion made, is that this literature should be viewed at least as two-fold: superficially misogynistic, but matriarchal in spirit.\n\nWhat's in a Label?

Feminist evolutionists have criticized various evolutionary psychologists for perpetuating gender stereotypes, using questionable methodology, and exhibiting a chill toward feminism. Though these criticisms have been raised many times, the conflict itself has not been fully analyzed. Therefore, I reconsider this conflict, both in its origins and its implications. I find that the approaches and perspectives of feminist evolutionists and evolutionary psychologists are distinctly different, leading many of the former to work in behavioral ecology, primatology, and evolutionary biology. Invitingly to feminist evolutionists, these three fields emphasize social behavior and the influences of environmental variables; in contrast, evolutionary psychology has come to rely on assumptions deemphasizing the pliability of psychological mechanisms and the flexibility of human behavior. In behavioral ecology, primatology, and evolutionary biology, feminist evolutionists have found old biases easy to correct and new hypotheses practical to test, offering new insights into male and female behavior, explaining the emergence and persistence of patriarchy, and potentially bringing closer a prime feminist goal, sexual equality.\n\nReading the World's Classics Critically: A Keyword-Based Approach to Literary Analysis in Foreign Language Studies\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nGarcÃ­a, Nuria Alonso; Caplan, Alison\n\n2014-01-01\n\nWhile there are a number of important critical pedagogies being proposed in the field of foreign language study, more attention should be given to providing concrete examples of how to apply these ideas in the classroom.

This lets us update the system of factors that influence the formation of the texts' genre specificity in the mass media. The analysis of programme literary criticism speeches published in the journals of N.M. Karamzin â Moskovsky Zhurnal, Vestnik Evropy â shows that not only rational and logical structures accomplish the constructive function in the text-formation mechanisms of such publications. The use of imaginative resources of journalistic and artistic discourses plays an important role in the implementation of the author's intentions. The supplementation of programme texts with the components non-typical of informational genres (lyrical and biographical fragments, expressive lexis, artistic and journalistic forms of the author's subjectivity expression is conditioned by organic interaction of several pragmatic goals in the texts, such as: informational, author's individual (Karamzin as a personality, and author's professional (Karamzin as an editor, writer, literary critic. These peculiarities together with a subtext contribute to the formation of new features of programme publications, which are not common for informational genres such as aesthetic function and multi-discursivity, reflected in semantic, expressive and vocabulary redundance. They also expand the range of possible effects on audience â cognitive, emotive, behavioral and communicative. As a result, a unique informational text of a programme type is formed. Therefore, a strict differentiation of genre forms of journal texts is only possible when taking into consideration all the possible text goals, as well as its role in the organization of common-journal discourse and publication policy.\n\nA fully feminist foreign policy? : A postcolonial feminist analysis of Sweden's Feminist Foreign Policy\n\nOpenAIRE\n\nNylund, Mia-Lie\n\n2017-01-01\n\nThis thesis is a postcolonial feminist discourse analysis of Swedenâs Feminist Foreign Policy. Swedenâs Feminist Foreign Policy is unique to the world, but it is not the only case of incorporating a gender perspective as a central part of national or international politics.

This article describes the author background and the subjects of the articles published in REF from 1992 to 2002. It was analysed the title, abstracts and keywords of the articles and the topics of the dossier, totalising 20 editorials, 105 articles and 20 dossiers. The classification and indexation of the material was guided by the controlled vocabulary of the âTesauro para Estudos de GÃªnero e sobre Mulheresâ, from FundaÃ§Ã£o Carlos Chagas. The results show that 95% of the authors are women, and that 54% are from Socials Sciences. There are articles in all thematic areas suggested by the Tesauro except on âScience and Technologyâ and âEducationâ, with a concentration on the following thematic areas: âSocials Sciences and Cultureâ (26%, âLanguage, Literature, Religion and Philosophyâ (17% and âHistory and Social Transformationâ (17%. The most discussed topics were in this order: sexual division of work, literary analysis, reproduction, and feminist theory. The analysis of REF suggests that gender and feminist research is a solitary activity, with a few number of articles published in partnership. There is a strong preference for qualitative methodologies (92%. This article aims to facilitate the process of identification some marginal areas in the gender and feminist studies in Brazil, empowering the educational and political work of the journal.\n\nA Classification of Feminist Theories\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nKaren Wendling\n\n2008-09-01\n\nFull Text Available In this paper I criticize Alison Jaggarâs descriptions of feminist political theories. I propose an alternative classification of feminist theories that I think more accurately reflects the multiplication of feminist theories and philosophies. There are two main categories, âstreet theoryâ and academic theories, each with two sub-divisions, political spectrum and âdifferencesâ under street theory, and directly and indirectly political analyses under academic theories. My view explains why there are no radical feminists outside of North America and why there are so few socialist feminists inside North America. I argue, controversially, that radical feminism is a radical version of liberalism. I argue that âdifferenceâ feminist theories â theory by and about feminists of colour, queer feminists, feminists with disabilities and so on â belong in a separate sub-category of street theory, because theyâve had profound effects on feminist activism not tracked by traditional left-to-right classifications. Finally, I argue that, while academic feminist theories such as feminist existentialism or feminist sociological theory are generally unconnected to movement activism, they provide important feminist insights that may become importantby showing the advantages of my classification over Jaggarâs views.

The scientific methods to be employed will be analysis-synthesis and induction-deduction in the processing and systematization of the information that leads to interpretations and generalizations of the main theoretical concepts this article deals with; and the theoretical premises CDA hinges on.\n\nNew directions for feminist therapy based on social constructionism.\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nFinfgeld, D L\n\n2001-06-01\n\nFeminist therapy has made significant contributions in the area of women's mental health care. Of late, however, critics have argued that feminist therapists are neglecting the needs of many women. The unique perspectives of women of color, lower and upper class women, lesbians, and other persons have been ignored. As such, it is proposed that social constructionism offers a metaframework for reinterpreting feminist therapy tenets to better address the needs of a broad range of individuals. Clinical implications are offered along with future directions for research and education. Copyright 2001 by W.B. Saunders Company\n\nReligion, Intersectionality, and Epistemic Habits of Academi"
