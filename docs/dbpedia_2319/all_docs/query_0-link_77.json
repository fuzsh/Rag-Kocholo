There are programs of one sort or another at hundreds of universities. The Association of Jewish Studies, which is the professional organization of professors in the field, has a membership that is approximately equal to that of the organizations for Reform or Conservative rabbis, with annual meetings that routinely attract close to a thousand participants. Yet, as Ellen Frankel, editor-in-chief of the Jewish Publication Society, has observed, “Jewish laypeople and rabbis remain uninterested in what Jewish scholars study and publish”; instead, rabbis “continue to teach what they themselves learned in seminary or even earlier . . . even though many of the ideas . . . have been discredited by contemporary scholarship” (Sh’ma, March 2004). If Frankel is right that “Scholars have yet to demonstrate that what they’re up to is good for the Jews,” then surely the dramatic insights pertaining to women is one area where their work has much to offer. It would be hard to find any other field within the constellation of Jewish Studies that is as relevant to contemporary Jewish life. Because women obviously constitute half of the Jewish people, their experience represents half of Jewish culture, even if that half has typically been overlooked. Recovering their experience, therefore, amounts to recovering half of Jewish civilization. But its value goes much further, because it can also provide information and insights that pertain to a host of issues that afflict contemporary Jewish life. Studying Jewish women can help to separate myth from reality, clarify the distinction between custom and law, and explore possible alternatives to the present way. It would obviously have been impossible to include every relevant topic within a single volume and still keep it to a reasonable length. However, these chapters, written by some of the leading scholars in their respective vii\n\nviii Acknowledgments\n\nfields, address many of the most prominent topics in such areas as Jewish history and law, literature and theology. They are offered here in the conviction that Jewish scholarship has much to contribute to enriching Jewish life and addressing current concerns. Moreover, ignoring scholarly insights and information can actually impede progress by making it more difficult to resolve pressing problems and thereby creating anxiety where there need be none so that potential solutions are overlooked. This series, Jewish Studies in the 21st Century, is the product of many people’s effort and support. It began with the vision of Herbert and Elaine Gimelstob, who provided the resources that have made it possible. From the beginning, Jennifer Hammer has been generous with her time and expertise, helping to turn a vision into reality; along the way, the staff at New York University Press has ensured that the results take the highest possible shape. Ellen Frankel gave the project clarity by sharing her knowledge and experience, along with her deep commitment to our goals, and Teresa Maybee invested yeoman service toward making the nuts and bolts of this effort work. Others who participated in the realization of this volume included Jessica Spitalnic Brockman, Avigail Rock, and Marianne Sanua. And, ah. arona ah. arona h. aviva, Barbara Pearl made my goals her own, providing support, insight, and assistance every step of the way while creating the supportive environment that has made this endeavor enjoyable as well as constructive.\n\nIntroduction\n\nFour Approaches to Women and the Jewish Experience Judith R. Baskin\n\nAlthough women have always constituted half of the Jewish population and have played essential roles in ensuring Jewish continuity and the preservation of Jewish beliefs and values, it is only since the 1970s that their contributions and achievements have received sustained scholarly attention. This burgeoning research into women and women’s experiences is a result, in great part, of the development of women’s studies as a theoretical discipline and of the significant increase, beginning in the 1970s, in the number of women who earned doctoral degrees in various fields of Jewish Studies. Using gender as a category of analysis, these scholars and increasing numbers of their colleagues have begun to investigate Jewish women’s domestic, economic, intellectual, spiritual, and creative roles in Jewish life from biblical times to the present. Studies of the conceptions and portrayals of women in every genre of Jewish literature, including the legal documents that have determined patterns of Jewish life for centuries, are also ongoing. Similarly, female writers and poets, as well as female readers, from various Jewish milieus have attracted unprecedented scholarly attention. This volume details these new developments in academic research about Jewish women and suggests future directions in a range of fields, including biblical studies, rabbinics, literature, history, and sociology. In her chapter, for example, Esther Fuchs delineates the varied ways in which Jewish feminist scholars of the Hebrew Bible have approached and analyzed biblical images of women, while Dvora Weisberg and Judith Hauptman consider innovative feminist analyses of the representations 1\n\n2 In trodu c t i on\n\nof women in rabbinic texts. Sara Horowitz and Nehama Aschkenasy, in their chapters, discuss the literatures that contemporary Jewish women have created in North America and in Israel. Historians, too, have returned to a range of primary documents to reveal women’s central social and economic contributions to sustaining the Jewish family in many different times and places, as well as evidence of their intellectual and spiritual lives. Renée Levine Melammed, Chava Weissler, and Harriet Pass Freidenreich address the situations of Jewish women in the medieval Muslim world, in early modern Europe, and during the first decades of the 20th century in Central Europe. Since the 1970s, many Jewish women, of all ages and backgrounds, have combined feminism’s mandate for equality in every area of human endeavor with an explicit commitment to Jewish identification and the Jewish community. Pamela Nadell and Sylvia Barack Fishman analyze the impact of this second wave of North American feminism on American Judaism and Jewish life and the ways in which the ordination of women as rabbis and cantors, as well as the spiritual and intellectual empowerment of Jewish lay women through enhanced Jewish education, have significantly altered the contemporary landscape. As Nadell and Fishman detail, changes in liturgical language that render the language of prayer both gender neutral and inclusive of all worshippers, as well as the development of new religious symbols and rituals focused on events in women’s lives, are among a number of innovations that have transformed Jewish life and worship at the beginning of the 21st century. This introductory chapter will focus on four overarching themes that inform all of these areas. The first of these is the repercussions of the inherently androcentric characteristics of biblical religion and rabbinic Judaism for Jewish women and their religious and social options throughout the centuries; the second is the equally important influence of host environments, whose norms and customs have also played a vital part in the ways Jewish women’s social and spiritual lives have developed and diverged from place to place. Third, I discuss the role of economic resources in determining women’s roles and status in various Jewish communities of the past and present. My final focus is the impact of technological innovations on the personal, educational, vocational, and communal opportunities open to Jewish women in the 21st century. Technological advances have transformed and improved women’s lives in numerous ways; at the same time they have brought about broadly accepted cultural changes in\n\nFour Approaches to Women and the Jewish Experience 3\n\nattitudes about women and their appropriate roles and activities that will inevitably determine the future contours of Judaism and Jewish life.\n\nThe Lasting Impact of Rabbinic Judaism While originating in the practices and literature of Israelite religion, rabbinic Judaism, which recorded its distinctive legal and literary traditions in the first six centuries of the Common Era, is the foundation of all contemporary forms of Jewish religious life. The earliest written documents of rabbinic Judaism are the Mishnah (henceforth m.), a compilation of legal rulings based on biblical law, actual practice, and spiritual vision, organized by subject matter, and edited in the land of Israel in the early 3rd century c.e., and the Tosefta, a contemporaneous collection of legal rulings, which follows the order of the Mishnah. In the centuries following the completion of these two works, rabbinic communities in the land of Israel and in Babylonia (the ancient Jewish communities in the Tigris and Euphrates river valleys) produced extensive commentaries on the Mishnah, known as gemara. The gemara produced in the rabbinic academies of Babylon was far more complete than that produced in the land of Israel, and when the Mishnah and this more extensive gemara were combined to form the Babylonian Talmud sometime in the 6th century c.e., the definitive compilation of Jewish law and tradition for the next millennium had been completed. The Talmud of the Land of Israel, completed in the 5th century c.e., although less comprehensive and considered less authoritative than the Babylonian Talmud (henceforth b.), also became a part of the larger body of rabbinic literature together with a number of exegetical (midrashic) compilations. These documents were all produced by rabbis, men who believed that their view of the world reflected a divinely ordained pattern of life for the Jewish people.1 As Dvora Weisberg and Judith Hauptman indicate in their chapters, rabbinic Judaism was essentially androcentric. Building on biblical legislation and the variety of women who populate the pages of the Hebrew Bible, described in this volume by Esther Fuchs, the rabbis developed a distinctive view of women as essentially different from men. While rabbinic views about women are as diverse as rabbinic opinions on other subjects, they rest on the talmudic statement that “women are a separate people” (b. Shabbat 62a), which conveys the basic rabbinic conviction that females are human entities created by God with physical characteristics,\n\n4 In trodu c t i on\n\ninnate capacities, and social functions inherently dissimilar from those of males. Moreover, the ways in which women are perceived to be essentially different are not only ineradicable but problematic for men. In particular, these include woman’s sexual attractiveness to men and the biological functions of the female body, especially those related to fertility.2 The certainty that women take a secondary place in the scheme of things permeates rabbinic thinking. The sages who produced rabbinic literature apportioned separate spheres and separate responsibilities to women and men, making every effort to confine women and their activities to the private realms of the family and its particular concerns. These obligations included economic activities that would benefit the household, since undertaking business transactions with other private individuals was an expected part of a woman’s domestic role.3 This template was already well established by late biblical times, as indicated by Proverbs 31:10-31, which describes the domestic, philanthropic, and entrepreneurial activities of the ideal wife. In rabbinic times, too, women participated in the economic life of the marketplace, worked in a number of productive enterprises, trades, and crafts, brought claims to the courtroom, met in gatherings with other women, and attended social events.4 But whatever women did in public, they did as private individuals. The rabbis were determined to exclude women from significant participation in most of their society’s communal and power-conferring public activities, not only by custom but as a result of detailed legislation. Since these public endeavors had mostly to do with participation in collective worship, communal study of religious texts, and the execution of judgments according to Jewish law, women were simultaneously isolated from access to authority and leadership and from the spiritual and intellectual sustenance available to men.5 As long as women satisfied male expectations in their domestic roles, they were revered and honored for enhancing the lives of their families and particularly for enabling their male relatives to fulfill their religious obligations. The Talmud relates that women earn merit “by sending their children to learn [Torah] in the synagogue and their husbands to study in the schools of the rabbis, and by waiting for their husbands until they return from the schools of the rabbis” (b. Berakhot 17a). Judith Hauptman demonstrates in her chapter that rabbinic jurisprudence often goes beyond biblical precedents in its efforts to ameliorate some of the difficulties women faced as a consequence of biblical legislation. Particular attention was devoted to extending special new protections to women in\n\nFour Approaches to Women and the Jewish Experience 5\n\nsuch areas as the formulation of marriage contracts, which provided financial support in the event of divorce or widowhood, and in allowing a woman to petition a rabbinic tribunal to compel her husband to divorce her in specific circumstances.6 Nevertheless, in this religious system, men expound the divine rulings that affect women’s lives; women, the objects of these directives, have no standing to legislate for themselves or others. This is not to say, however, that rabbinic Judaism did not grant women spiritual status. Women, like men, were responsible not only for obeying all of Judaism’s negative commandments but also for observing the Sabbath and all of the festivals and holidays of the Jewish calendar (although male and female obligations on these days sometimes differed). Although women are exempt from participation in communal prayers that must be recited at specific times, they were not free from the obligation to pray, which is incumbent on each individual (b. Berakhot 20a-b). Later Jewish tradition understood that women were to make a personal address to God as they started their day and that the content of women’s prayers might be spontaneous and could be voiced in a vernacular language, rather than according to an established liturgy.7 However, Chava Weissler reminds us that we do not find extant versions of specific formulations of prayers for women until the end of the medieval period.8 Women also observed a number of ritual regulations within the domestic sphere. These included preparation and serving of food according to the rabbinic dietary laws (kashrut) and the observance of limitations on marital contact during the wife’s menstrual period (niddah). Similarly, women were expected to separate and burn a piece of the dough used in making Sabbath bread (h. allah), a reminder of Temple sacrifice, and to kindle Sabbath lights (hadlaqah). Doubtless, these rituals provided satisfying spiritual avenues for sanctification of aspects of daily life for many women. Yet, it is also the case that at least some strands of rabbinic tradition regard women’s performance of these ordinances not as mitzvot, that is, as divine commandments whose observance enhances the religious life of the observer and ensures divine favor, but rather as eternal punishments brought upon woman to remind her of Eve’s responsibility in the death of Adam and therefore in all human mortality (Genesis Rabbah 17:8). According to the Mishnah, “For three transgressions do women die in childbirth: for heedlessness of the laws concerning their menstruation, the dough offering, and the lighting of the Sabbath lamp” (m. Shabbat 2:6).9\n\n6 In trodu c t i on\n\nThe rabbis believed that to be female was less desirable than to be male and several times listed the physical and social disadvantages to which a woman was subjected.10 One of the most trenchant statements of the difference in the status of men and women in rabbinic Judaism is found in a discussion of the various ritual obligations incumbent on the adult male Jew. According to this text, one of the three blessings a man is obligated to say daily thanks God “who has not made me a woman” (b. Menah. ot 43b). This blessing ultimately became part of the daily liturgy for morning prayers in traditional Jewish practice, enshrining the difference in the status of men and women in rabbinic Judaism for centuries to come. It remains part of the traditional liturgy to the present day; in its place, women thank God “for making me according to Your will.”11 The negative ways in which woman were constructed as “other” and as morally inferior to men in the foundation texts of rabbinic Judaism had a long-lasting impact on men’s perceptions of women and on women’s images of themselves; they play a major role, as well, in the negative images of women found in Jewish folk literature and mystical teachings. Yet, different as they were imagined to be, women were also acknowledged as essential to men as the indispensable social mortar that sustained rabbinic society. Women as wives, mothers, and economic partners were praised as “bolsters to their husbands,” eminently worthy of recognition and appreciation.12 Still, in virtually no time or place prior to the contemporary era did any Jewish man ever imagine that a woman could be his equal.\n\nThe Influence of the Majority Culture Since the Babylonian conquest in biblical times (586 b.c.e.), the majority of Jews have lived outside the land of Israel. Jewish societies, living in a variety of host cultures, have consistently struggled to maintain a balance between the guidance and demands of Jewish law and the social practices of their gentile neighbors. Often this has meant that Jews have adopted the language and dress of the majority society and many of its dominant cultural attitudes, as well. Degrees of Jewish adaptation and acculturation, as well as instances of Jewish uniqueness in any specific instance, can be discerned only through comparisons with the larger cultural context within which any particular Jewish subculture has functioned. Culture is closely entwined with social class. While Jews in both medieval Muslim and Christian societies, for example, were under a\n\nFour Approaches to Women and the Jewish Experience 7\n\nnumber of personal and political constraints as members of a minority community, many nevertheless maintained a higher standard of living than the majority of the gentile population. It is important, therefore, that comparisons of Jews and non-Jews in any given time and place take into account the social norms and practices of groups with similar economic resources. Although the patriarchal culture of rabbinic Judaism conformed in great part to wider Near Eastern norms that also tended to restrict women to domestic tasks, at least one Jewish social setting in late antiquity allowed independent women significant communal participation. From the 3rd century b.c.e. on, large numbers of Jews lived in the Greek-speaking Diaspora of the Hellenistic and Roman worlds. Evidence suggests that a number of aspects of Jewish life in these communities, including possibilities available for women, diverged significantly from the norms and prescriptions found in rabbinic Judaism, which was centered in the land of Israel and in Sassanian Iraq. While it seems likely that most Jewish women in the Greek-speaking parts of the Roman Empire lived their lives in the relative seclusion of the home, examinations of funerary and other inscriptions demonstrate that some Jewish women acted as autonomous entities in the social, economic, and religious spheres.13 On the basis of a number of inscriptions in Greek and Latin, dating from the 1st century b.c.e. to the 6th century c.e. and ranging from Italy to Asia Minor, Egypt, and Phoenicia, in which women bear such titles as “head of the synagogue,” “leader,” “elder,” “mother of the synagogue,” and “priestess,” Bernadette Brooten has suggested that, contrary to previous scholarly consensus informed by rabbinic texts, Jewish women assumed positions of leadership in the very public sphere of the ancient synagogue in these Diaspora communities.14 Although it is not clear if these synagogue titles were simply honorific in recognition of significant philanthropy or if they imply that women had meaningful leadership and/or ritual obligations, Ross S. Kraemer has suggested that Jewish communities in the Greco-Roman Diaspora may have been particularly accepting of women’s leadership in areas of public affairs where “civic responsibility and religion intersected,” as in synagogue activities. She has written “that women’s leadership was particularly likely in Jewish synagogues with relatively high numbers of proselytes (both male and female) for whom the participation of women in public life, including religious collegia, was familiar and acceptable.”15 It is quite possible that many of these women were widows or otherwise independent women in control of substantial\n\n8 In trodu c t i on\n\nfinancial resources, since they are almost never mentioned in terms of a relationship to a husband, father, or son. A few Jewish women of this milieu may also have possessed significant Jewish learning. The 1st-century c.e. writer Philo of Alexandria relates that a small number of upper-class, well-educated Jewish women joined the contemplative monastic Therapeutic community that was located outside Alexandria, Egypt. Apparently, most of those women were older virgins, who, like their male counterparts, spent their days reading Jewish scriptures and allegorical commentaries and living a life of rigorous asceticism, broken only by Sabbath and festival observances. When men and women prayed together on the Sabbath, they were separated by a partial wall that prevented visual contact but allowed women to participate equally with men in prayer and song.16 Clearly, there were non-Jewish models of female autonomy, religious leadership, and political and economic power in these Greek-speaking Roman communities that sanctioned this kind of independent female activity, and a small number of women who identified themselves with the Jewish community were able to take advantage of them. Jewish communities have generally conformed to the patterns of the majority culture in terms of the status of women. In her chapter, Renée Levine Melammed discusses roles of Jewish women in the Muslim world and demonstrates how expectations for Jewish women and Jewish marriage practices were strongly influenced by Islamic norms. Although Jewish women of prosperous families were not literally isolated in women’s quarters as were Muslim women of comparable social status, religious and community ideals dictated that women should remain at home as much as possible.17 Polygamy was a feature not only of biblical and rabbinic social policy but of Muslim life; thus, it is not surprising that many Jewish men in Muslim environments appear to have had more than one wife. Documents from this milieu frequently contain agreements to grant equal rights to wives in a polygamous family, the husband generally undertaking to spend alternate nights with each spouse. Wealthy families often insisted on the insertion of clauses in their daughters’ marriage contracts that forbade the husband to take a second wife.18 Polygamy remained a feature of Jewish life in the Muslim world well into the 20th century. In medieval and early modern Christian Europe, on the other hand, monogamy was the rule, and women generally had significantly more freedom of movement than women in the Muslim world. These cultural patterns had a significant impact on Jewish women. In this social setting, the position of Jewish women, who were active participants in the\n\nFour Approaches to Women and the Jewish Experience 9\n\nfamily economy, was significantly higher than that of Jewish women in the Islamic milieu. This is indicated, in part, by their large dowries, which might constitute 10 percent of their parents’ worth.19 A further recognition of women’s high standing, as well as the strong influence of the larger environment, is the 11th-century takkanah (rabbinic ruling) forbidding polygamy for Jews in Christian countries. This change in traditional Jewish law is attributed to Rabbi Gershom ben Judah (c. 960–1028), the first great rabbinic authority of Western European (Ashkenazic) Jewry. R. Gershom is also credited with the even more significant pronouncement that no woman could be divorced against her will, a positive enhancement of women’s legal status in Judaism.20 In fact, divorce appears to have been less common among Jews in medieval Christian Europe than in the Muslim milieu, perhaps because it was not sanctioned by Christianity. Another example of significant social influence on women’s lives from the majority culture is found in the period of Haskalah, the Jewish Enlightenment movement that began in late-18th-century Germany and brought enormous changes to Jewish religious, political, and social life in Central and Western Europe. Receptive to modernity and European culture, Haskalah insisted that Jewish acculturation to the mainstream mores and customs of the public sphere was not incompatible with adherence to traditional Jewish practice. Adoption of the language and values of the non-Jewish world tended to occur first among the wealthiest Jews, who had frequent financial dealings with non-Jews. As Harriet Pass Freidenreich points out, many daughters of the wealthy Jewish elite became highly educated in European languages and culture. Exposure to a world of secular novels, poetry, and plays, together with instruction in music and modern languages, distanced young women from brothers and husbands whose lives were restricted narrowly to commerce and finance. In the late 18th and early 19th centuries, a number of these prosperous and accomplished women found success in a salon society where gentiles and Jews mixed socially, and a few of them ultimately moved entirely into the gentile world through conversion.21 Some of the supporters of Haskalah championed social changes within the Jewish community that had an impact on less privileged women. Moses Mendelssohn (d. 1786), the founder of Haskalah in Central Europe, and others of his circle, for example, expressed opposition to arranged marriages and advocated love matches.22 Haskalah also led to religious transformations that enhanced women’s position and status. Indeed, many contemporary forms of Jewish religious practice, including Reform Judaism,\n\n10 In trodu c t i on\n\nConservative Judaism, and Modern Orthodoxy, were shaped in this milieu. Reform Judaism, in particular, which offered 19th-century Jews a modernized and acculturated form of Jewish belief and practice, proclaimed that women were entitled to the same religious rights and subject to the same religious duties as men in both home and synagogue. Emphasis on equal religious education for girls and boys, including the introduction of a confirmation ceremony for young people of both sexes and the shaping of an accessible worship service in the vernacular, made the new movement attractive to many women. Similarly, the introduction of family seating in North American Reform synagogues, permitting men and women to sit together during worship, was also appealing to acculturated Jews. Pressure from young women may have prompted the Reform rabbinate to adopt the Christian model of double-ring wedding ceremonies in which not only men but women made a statement of marital commitment.23 Nevertheless, Freidenreich reminds us that the process of acculturation to the larger society was generally quite different for women and men in Central and Western Europe. Confined to the domestic scene, restricted in their educational opportunities, and prevented from participating in the public realms of economic and civic life, most Jewish women had few contacts with the non-Jewish world. Rather, women were encouraged to cultivate a home-based Judaism in which spirituality was expressed in domestic activities; in secularized homes they were usually the last to preserve elements of Jewish tradition. This 19th-century domestic Judaism not only reflected traditional Judaism’s preferred positioning of women in the private realm of husband and family but also was a form of Jewish conformity to the Christian bourgeois model of female domesticity that put religion in the female sphere.24 Similarly, emulation of Christian models of female philanthropy and religious activism inspired middle-class Jewish women to establish service and social welfare organizations in Germany, England, and North America in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. These organizations, some of which were connected with synagogues, advocated greater recognition of women within their respective Jewish communities as “sustainers of Jewish communal life and guardians against defection from Judaism.”25 In her chapter, Freidenreich demonstrates the extent of female activism in Germany in this era and discusses Jewish women’s support of social welfare services, feminist trade unionism, women’s suffrage, and religious change. She also documents Jewish women’s prominence among university graduates in German-speaking Europe prior to the Nazi period.26\n\nFour Approaches to Women and the Jewish Experience 11\n\nThe ordination of women as rabbis is another innovation that was very much affected by larger cultural attitudes. As Pamela Nadell has chronicled, female rabbinical ordination was first seriously considered in late19th-century Germany and the United States as a natural result of Reform Judaism’s insistence on the equality of men and women. The discussion about female ordination within the Jewish community was actually part of a larger social debate as women began to gain access to higher education and the learned professions. Women were now able to become doctors, lawyers, and ministers; why should Jewish women not also aspire to the rabbinate? However, the ambivalence of Reform Jewish leaders, who struggled to balance their long-stated commitment to the religious emancipation of Jewish women with their own engrained prejudices about women’s proper sphere and their perceptions of the receptivity of their congregations to female rabbis, delayed a positive commitment to women’s ordination for nearly a century, despite a series of challengers. It took the collision between second-wave feminism and American Judaism to propel women into the rabbinate in a sustained and institutionalized way.27 At the beginning of the 21st century, much of the creativity in contemporary Jewish spirituality, liturgy formation, scholarship, and artistic life is coming from women. This phenomenon raises many questions about continuing male roles in liberal forms of Jewish practice, learning, and institutional life. As Sylvia Barack Fishman has cautioned, the stakes for American Jews are significant, since “The American Jewish community not only shares in all the human consequences of feminism but also carries with it the additional responsibility of preserving three thousand years of Jewish history and culture and confronting the problems of a numerically challenged population as well.”28 However, if the past is any indication, forces from outside the Jewish community will be as influential as any from within in determining the roles of women in American Judaism and American Jewish life in the decades to come.\n\nEconomic Resources In eras of opportunity, Jewish women who controlled significant economic resources frequently assumed prominent roles in their households and in their communities. Widows and other independent women of means, such as divorcées, were particularly likely to become influential. In her chapter, Dvora Weisberg discusses the wealthy and politically well-\n\n12 In trodu c t i on\n\nconnected Yalta in rabbinic Babylon,29 while Renée Levine Melammed talks about the independent Cairo businesswoman Wuhsha. Clearly, the women in the Greek-speaking Diaspora discussed earlier, who were leaders in their synagogues or who devoted their lives to study, were also individuals of means. One region where the phenomenon of women and economic success is particularly striking is northern France and Germany, known to medieval Jews as Ashkenaz. Avraham Grossman has shown that Jewish women’s position here markedly improved between 1100 and 1300, relative both to the talmudic era and to the situation of Jewish women in Muslim countries. He suggests that this was a result of the economic success that transformed relatively small Jewish communities into a bourgeois society. As Jews prospered in trade and money lending, Jewish women played an increasingly vital and often autonomous part in their family’s economic lives, both as merchants and as financial brokers. Indeed, Jewish women’s influential position and activities during the High Middle Ages paralleled those of Christian women within the upper bourgeoisie, as both groups of women achieved literacy and financial skills and ran their households and economic affairs effectively during their husbands’ absences, whether on mercantile or military endeavors.30 As I noted earlier, one indication of the high status of Jewish women in this medieval milieu was the large dowries they brought into marriage. Since the capital with which a young couple started life had its origin mainly in the bride’s portion, parents demanded strong guarantees in the ketubah (marriage contract) that the bride would be treated with respect, that her marriage would have some permanence, and that she would be financially secure. Jewish women’s economic activities generally supplied a part or even the whole of the family income, sometimes allowing their husbands to devote themselves to study. Medieval Jewish literature is full of references to women’s business undertakings and to their frequent meetings and travels with Jewish and gentile men for business purposes; no objections are cited anywhere to women’s wideranging freedom of action. In fact, rabbinic authorities allowed Jewish businesswomen traveling alone to disguise themselves as men or as nuns for self-protection.31 Women engaged in all kinds of commercial operations and occupations, but money lending was especially common. Jewish matrimonial and property laws permitted women to manage capital they acquired through dowry, inheritance and, in case of divorce or widowhood, their ketubah.\n\nFour Approaches to Women and the Jewish Experience 13\n\nSurviving records indicate that women were responsible for one-third to one-half of all loans in Northern France in the 13th and 14th centuries and in German and Austrian communities between 1350 and 1500. These figures represent loans granted by women who were acting alone or as the head of a business consortium. A small group of women, mostly widows, were active in top-level business with the nobility or rulers.32 Because of their high tax contributions, some of these businesswomen gained administrative power as tax collectors. Others, such as Kändlein of Regensburg in 1354 and Josephine of Regensburg in 1374, were elected officers in their Jewish community administrative council (kehillah), a most unusual honor for a woman and evidence of the power these individuals had attained through their economic success.33 Another indication of women’s high economic status in Ashkenaz was their voluntary assumption of religious practices from which they were exempt in rabbinic Judaism. Thus, in 12th-century Germany and northern France, at least some women of means insisted on assuming time-bound positive precepts, such as putting on tefillin (phylacteries), even though they were not obligated to do so by halakhah, and contemporary sages felt compelled to acquiesce. The 12th-century scholar R. Simcha of Speyer included women among the quorum of ten people required to recite the grace over meals.34 A fascinating example of women’s assumption of ritual roles in the public domain was the prominent women who served as godmother (sandeqa’it) at the circumcision of a son or grandson. R. Meir of Rothenburg, a major rabbinic leader of the 14th century, attempted to abolish this practice, since he believed the presence of perfumed and well-dressed women in the synagogue among men was immodest. He was unsuccessful, and this custom continued until the beginning of the 15th century, an indication of Jewish women’s high status and financial clout in the communal realm of Ashkenaz.35 However, as the political and economic situation of European Jewish communities gradually worsened, beginning in the 13th century, and as traditional practice and laws were reasserted, most of the nonhalakhic privileges Jewish women had achieved in this and other areas of daily life were firmly curtailed.36 Following the expulsion from Spain in 1492, the experience of immigration and the encounter with non-Iberian communities offered some female refugees with significant financial resources a similar empowerment and independence. Powerful and wealthy widows, such as Benvenida Abravanel and Doña Gracia Nasi, both of the 16th century, continued their deceased husbands’ business ventures successfully, intervened with\n\n14 In trodu c t i on\n\nrulers on behalf of threatened Jewish communities, and were renowned for their philanthropy and their support of Jewish culture and learning.37 Several wives and widows of the early “Court Jews” of German-speaking Europe were also active entrepreneurs. One example is Esther Schulhoff Aaron Liebmann (c. 1645–1714), who was married first to Israel Aaron (d. 1673), a supplier of goods to the Brandenburg court and founder of the Berlin Jewish community. She subsequently married Jost Leibmann; she and her husband were the court jewelers to Frederick I of Prussia and the leading family in the Berlin Jewish community. Esther worked actively alongside her husband and successfully carried on their business after her husband’s death. Like many Jews who served the courts of local and regional rulers, Liebmann’s fortunes depended on personal favor. After the death of Frederick I and the accession of Frederick William I, in 1713, Esther Liebmann was put under house arrest and released only after she had paid the king a substantial fine.38 Control of economic resources provided women with other kinds of communal and spiritual options. One woman who crossed gender boundaries to achieve independent religious leadership in a Hasidic sect was Hannah Rochel Werbermacher (1815–1888?), a woman of independent means. Well-educated and pious, Webermacher, known as the Holy Maid of Ludmir, acquired a reputation for saintliness and miracle-working in her Polish town. Her wealthy father died when she was nineteen, leaving her a sufficiently large inheritance to support herself without a husband or community aid, and she built her own prayer house and held gatherings like a Hasidic rebbe. Werbermacher attracted both men and women to her “court,” where she delivered lectures from behind a closed door. Not surprisingly, reaction from the male Hasidic leaders of her region was uniformly negative, and Hannah was pressured to resume her rightful female role in marriage. Although her marriages were unsuccessful, they had the intended result of ending her career as a religious leader, at least in Poland. Around 1860, Werbermacher used her financial resources to relocate to Jerusalem where she reestablished herself as a holy woman. Here, too, she attracted a following of Hasidic women and men, as well as Sephardi and possibly some Muslim Arab women, and led gatherings at the Western Wall, the Tomb of Rachel, and her own study house.39 In the contemporary era, too, Jewish women of substantial financial resources frequently play important roles in the Jewish community, particularly in North America. It is the case, however, as Sylvia Barack Fishman and others have documented, that women remain poorly represented in\n\nFour Approaches to Women and the Jewish Experience 15\n\nthe upper echelons of Jewish philanthropic leadership. During the late 1990s, concluding that issues important to women and girls were not being appropriately funded by community allocations, female philanthropists established Jewish women’s foundations in a number of North American cities. In their first ten years, more than twenty such funds have raised more than $35 million to support services that are specifically directed to the needs of girls and women. In addition to drawing attention and resources to Jewish women’s issues, the new philanthropies are also attracting more women to the Jewish organizational world.40\n\nTechnological Changes and Jewish Women Advances in technology over the centuries have profoundly affected many aspects of human society, including the lives of women. The invention of printing in the 15th century, which made the dissemination of popular literature practicable and inexpensive, played an important role in expanding Jewish women’s religious lives and piety in the early modern period. In her essay in this volume, Chava Weissler discusses tkhines, supplicatory prayers for women written in the vernacular, and notes the significance of this new technology in making these liturgical texts easily available. Access to reading matter in the vernacular had a transformative effect for many women, deepening their knowledge of Judaism and Jewish traditions and even empowering a few women to become writers.41 Rabbinic injunctions against women’s learning were believed to apply to Talmud study but not to the Bible or legal rulings necessary for women’s everyday activities. While Jewish women were generally ignorant of Hebrew, most were literate in Jewish vernaculars (Judeo-German [Western Yiddish] in Central Europe and Yiddish in Eastern Europe, written in Hebrew characters), which had long been essential to women’s economic activities. Translations of the Hebrew Bible, the first books to be printed in the Jewish vernacular, gave women access to Judaism’s holy texts. Particularly popular were the Taytsh‑khumesh, first published by Sheftl Hurwitz in Prague in 1608 or 1610, and the Tsenerene, by Yankev ben Itzkhok Ashkenazy (c. 1590–1618), both of which included homilies on the weekly biblical readings from the Torah and Prophets, as well as stories, legends, and parables drawn from rabbinic literature, the Zohar and other mystical texts, and histories and travel accounts. Ethical treatises that discussed proper conduct, woman’s religious obligations, and a woman’s relations with her husband, such as\n\n16 In trodu c t i on\n\nthe Brantshpigl (Burning Mirror) by Moses ben Henoch Altschuler (1596) and the Meneket Rivkah of Rebecca bas Meir Tiktiner of Prague (d. 1550; posthumously published in the early 17th century), were also available to female readers. These vernacular books, which were also read by Jewish men, many of whom were not possessed of significant Jewish scholarship, were printed in a special typeface, vayber taytsh (“women’s vernacular”), based on the cursive Hebrew hand women were taught for business contracts, marriage agreements, and correspondence. With the publication of these works, the new technology of printing provided a vehicle of education and expression for nonelite Jews, including literate women.42 A similar phenomenon of female literary empowerment was also present in Italy, where Deborah Ascarelli translated Hebrew liturgical poetry into rhymed Italian, presumably for use by female worshippers. Her book, containing translations of liturgical selections into Italian, as well as her own poetry in Italian, is the only source of information about her. According to the book’s dedication, Deborah and her husband, Joseph Ascarelli, lived in Rome; the family is associated with exiles from Spain and the leadership of the Catalan community of Rome. Her Abitacolo degli oranti, completed in 1537 and published in Venice in 1601, is probably the earliest published work in Jewish literature written by a woman.43 One early modern woman who was strongly influenced by printed vernacular literature was Glikl bas Judah Leib (also Glückel of Hameln) (1646–1724).44 Born into the prosperous Court Jew milieu of Central Europe, Glikl was well read in Judaeo-German literature and had some knowledge of Hebrew and German, as well; her memorial notice characterizes her as “a learned woman” (melumedet), unusual praise in her time and place.45 Betrothed at twelve, married at fourteen, and the mother of fourteen children, Glikl was active in business and pious in religious observance, including regular synagogue attendance. Her autobiography, written to drive away the melancholy that followed her husband’s death and to let her children know their ancestry, is an engrossing document that interweaves and juxtaposes pious tales and moralizing from her extensive reading with Glickl’s accounts of events in her own life and those of her loved ones. At the threshold of modernity, both as a woman and as a Jew, Glikl undertook business activities that reflect the growing economic participation of Jews in the non-Jewish world, while her religious and secular educations speak to the broader horizons and new educational and intellectual opportunities available to some 17th-century Jewish women thanks to the proliferation of printed books. Her journey from\n\nFour Approaches to Women and the Jewish Experience 17\n\nreader to writer would be experienced by a growing number of Jewish women in the centuries to come, as Sara Horowitz and Nehama Aschkenasy have demonstrated in their scholarship and in their chapters.46 Over the past two hundred years, the domestic, religious, and communal roles of Jewish women in the Western world have undergone significant expansions as a result of the technological transformations associated with modernity. By the end of the 19th century, the industrial production of textiles and ready-to-wear clothing and the commercial milling of flour and baking of bread liberated women from what were historically their most time-consuming activities. Similarly, growing industrialization and urbanization in Europe and North America led to the separation of economic activities from the domestic realm. These social changes wrought by technological advances played a significant part in the contemporaneous growth of women’s service organizations discussed earlier, as middleclass women found that they could care for their families and also play a role beyond their domestic responsibilities. By the second half of the 20th century, the widespread availability and affordability of refrigerators, washing machines and dryers, vacuum cleaners, modern cooking equipment, and dishwashers reduced the time that women were required to devote to household maintenance.47 These new appliances, together with ongoing innovations in communication devices, allowed many women to consider undertaking paid employment and broader communal responsibilities outside the home to assist in the economic support of their families and to expand their personal, intellectual, and spiritual horizons. None of the phenomena that Nadell and Fishman describe would have been possible without these technological leaps forward. Concurrently, the development of a range of effective birth control options in the 1960s and 1970s enabled Jewish women to plan their families. At the beginning of the 21st century, medical fertility technology is also playing an increasingly important role for a Jewish population in demographic decline, given the late ages at which Jewish couples tend to marry, a rate of reproduction below that of other ethnic groups, and the growing incidence of marriage outside the Jewish community.48 And, just as the invention of the telephone transformed human interactions one hundred years ago and the invention of the typewriter opened office employment to women in the first decades of the 20th century, so, too, the development of computer technology, particularly the Internet, has also given Jewish women unimagined new options for learning, organizing, and communicating with each other in every sector of the Jewish female community.\n\n18 In trodu c t i on\n\nConclusion In the first decade of the 21st century, Jewish women have encountered new challenges in the areas of family formation; unprecedented opportunities in higher education and vocational choice; increased communal acceptance of homosexuality and other alternative lifestyles; and a wide range of options in religious and spiritual expression and political and civic activism. However, many of the battles for female integrity and equality within Judaism remain to be fought within traditional forms of Judaism, Jewish communities with roots in the Muslim world, and Israel, where Jewish women’s rights in marriage and divorce remain circumscribed by halakhic regulation. The chapters of this volume make clear that whatever the future holds for the Jewish people, there can be no doubt that these four factors—Judaism’s traditional androcentric views of women, the impact of the larger societies in which Jews live, Jewish women’s increasing economic clout, and future technological advances—will continue to play central roles in determining the contours of Jewish women’s lives.\n\nNotes 1.

Weisberg\n\nThe rabbi and his wife retired for the evening. Unbeknownst to them, one of the rabbi’s students was hiding under their bed. When the student was discovered, his teacher angrily questioned him: “What do you think you are doing?” The student replied, “This too is Torah, and I need to learn.”1 This story, found in the Babylonian Talmud, offers several lessons. The most obvious one is that the behavior of rabbis, including their sexual habits, is viewed by their disciples—and by the editorial voice of the Babylonian Talmud—as Torah, just like the teachings they convey in the house of study. A good student, a student who wants to immerse himself in his teacher’s Torah, absorbs not only the teacher’s formal lessons but also the lessons conveyed through the teacher’s behavior, even if it means following the teacher into the bedroom. A second, more subtle message is taught through this story. Rabbis and their students are engaged in an intimate relationship, the object of their mutual desire being Torah. This relationship trumps the intimate relationship between the rabbi and his wife. When the rabbi in question confronts his student, he indicates that the student’s presence is intrusive. At that moment, the three actors in the drama are triangled; the rabbi’s reaction suggests that the student is the outsider, while the rabbi and his wife are paired. Through his reply, “This too is Torah, and I need to learn,” the student proposes a different way of seeing the relationship. He and his teacher are now allied, for together they are engaged in the study of Torah; the rabbi’s wife is now the outsider. The sexual act, which is too private to be shared with a third party, is transformed; the proper behavior of a sage during the sexual act is Torah, something meant to be analyzed by student and teacher. The wife, by virtue of her gender, is not a suitable 41\n\n42 Pa rt I: C l as si c a l T ra di t i on\n\nstudy partner for her husband; she is displaced by both Torah and her husband’s student. She is now the intruder, the unwanted, unnecessary outsider. This story supports the argument that, in excluding women from the study of Torah,2 rabbinic culture marked women as Other. While this is not the only way in which rabbinic Judaism differentiates between men and women,3 it is one of the most powerful. Rabbinic culture idealizes the study of Torah, naming it the highest calling and most rewarding endeavor open to Jews. In doing so, it dismisses, to a greater or lesser degree, those who do not engage in the study of Torah.4 Every male Jew is a potential student of Torah, but study by women is ignored or discouraged. Even a woman who learns Torah has no place in rabbinic circles. Nowhere is this more evident than in the stories told of Beruriah, the only woman described in classic rabbinic documents as a Torah “scholar.” Beruriah is said to have learned “three hundred laws from three hundred teachers.”5 In one source, her legal ruling is said to have been preferable to that of her brother.6 At the same time, Beruriah is never shown learning Torah from or with a rabbi. Nor does she teach, except through dismissive comments. Moreover, women’s knowledge of Torah is viewed by the Babylonian Talmud (Bavli) as problematic and even dangerous. In the Mishnah, one sage counsels that women should not be taught Torah, for, even when taught, women transform Torah into frivolity (tiflut) or worse.7 In various talmudic stories, women are portrayed using Torah for their own purposes, often at odds with rabbis and rabbinic law. In this chapter, we consider the relation of women and Torah as portrayed in nonlegal material in classical rabbinic texts (aggadah).8 We analyze aggadic texts about women and Torah and discuss contemporary scholarship on aggadah and gender issues. We conclude with a brief consideration of the future of gender studies in relation to aggadah.\n\nStories About Women Studying Torah: Interpreting From Silence Rabbinic literature is replete with stories about rabbis and Torah study. There are stories about rabbis’ first exposure to Torah study, including stories about how individuals overcame serious disadvantages—illiteracy, poverty, parental opposition—to become great sages. Scholars are\n\nWomen and Torah Study in Aggadah 43\n\nfrequently portrayed in discussion with their teachers, students, and colleagues. Many of these stories contain valuable lessons about the centrality of Torah study and warnings about proper and improper ways to interact with one’s colleagues. Women are almost uniformly absent from these stories. Legal discussions about women and Torah study do not segue into stories that illustrate the danger of teaching women Torah or highlight individual women who did study Torah. Instead, legal statements about women and Torah study end abruptly, moving to other issues. Commenting on the obligation of a father to teach his son Torah, the Babylonian Talmud offers interpretations that contend that women are not required to teach their sons or to learn on their own and that men are not obligated to teach women. Rather than offering any stories or incidents to elaborate on these issues, it then proceeds to explore the problem that arises when both a man and his son need to study Torah but there are funds to finance only one education.9 Similarly, women’s exemption from the study of Torah is used as support for their exemption from other commandments without any discussion of women actually studying Torah.10 In Mishnah Sotah 3:4, we learn that a woman may drink from the waters of jealousy (Numbers 5:11ff.) and not feel the effects immediately “if she has some merit.” This unspecified merit may delay the impact of the waters as long as three years, according to the Mishnah. In response to this teaching, Ben Azzai asserts that “a man must teach his daughter Torah, so that if she drinks [the waters of jealousy and experiences no adverse effects] she will know that her merit is the source of the delay.” The Mishnah continues, “Rabbi Eliezer says, ‘Anyone who teaches his daughter Torah teaches her frivolity.’” The ensuing talmudic discussion focuses on the length of the delay caused by merit and then asks “what type of merit” the Mishnah imagines a woman might have.11 It quickly dismisses the possibility that the merit could be for studying Torah, since a woman would be in the category of “one who is not commanded but performs,” implying that the merit involved would be inadequate to counteract the waters of jealousy. The Talmud concludes that a woman might be protected by the merit of the commandments she has performed and then goes on to compare the merit afforded by Torah study to that afforded by the performance of other commandments. There is no discussion of a woman’s studying Torah—even though the possibility has been raised—and no elaboration of Ben Azzai’s exhortation that fathers teach their daughters Torah. While there is a brief discussion of Rabbi Eliezer’s statement, it\n\n44 Pa rt I: C l as si c a l T ra di t i on\n\noffers no textual support for his contention that teaching women Torah leads to frivolity. Classical rabbinic literature shows no interest in the subject of women as students of Torah. While women occasionally cite Torah, we are rarely given any sense of how these women came to their knowledge of Torah. The “exceptional” women cited in contemporary feminist discussions of women in rabbinic literature have no “paper trail”; we never learn how they came to possess the information they offer. We can assume that some women learned some Torah at home, as a result of proximity to learned male relatives. Imma Shalom, explaining to her husband, Rabbi Eliezer, how she knew that his prostration and prayer had led to her brother’s death, says, “I received this tradition from the house of my father’s father—all the gates are locked except the gate of oppression.”12 There is no reason to read this statement as an indication that Imma Shalom studied formally at home; she may have learned a number of traditions by virtue of growing up in a rabbinic household. Similarly, when some women are taken captive and appear before Rabbi Hanina to testify regarding their captivity, he remarks, “They are obviously the daughters of a scholar.”13 The women, who are in fact the daughters of a prominent Babylonian rabbi (Samuel), are “learned” enough to stage their appearance and testimony in a way that benefits them by protecting their status as marriageable virgins. Neither the rabbis in the story nor the Talmud speculate on the manner in which Samuel’s daughters learned the law that allowed them to maintain their status. There is no way to know whether the observation “They are obviously the daughters of a scholar” indicates that rabbis’ daughters were formally educated by their fathers or simply suggests that proximity to rabbis might afford a woman some informal access to Torah.14 Similarly, rabbis’ daughters are sometimes mentioned as women knowledgeable in matters of law concerning food preparation, and this knowledge is attributed to the fact that the woman in question had a rabbi-father who was meticulous.15 We are left to assume that women raised in rabbinic households somehow acquired knowledge, but, again, the Talmud displays no interest in how that acquisition occurred or what part rabbis played in educating their daughters. Rabbinic literature displays a similar lack of interest in the scholarly beginnings of Beruriah, the woman most often cited in the quest for learned women in early rabbinic circles. The most impressive testimony to Beruriah’s erudition is found in b. Pesah. im 62b, where she is described by Rabbi Yohanan to Rabbi Simlai as a person who “learned three hundred laws\n\nWomen and Torah Study in Aggadah 45\n\nin one day from three hundred teachers” and as someone who devoted years to the study of a particularly challenging work, Sefer Yuh. asin. The Talmud records this impressive feat without comment, offering it primarily as a snub to the ambitious and overconfident Rabbi Simlai. There is no discussion of Beruriah’s Torah study; the passage offers no hint as to why she chose to study Torah or why so many rabbis were willing to teach her, beyond identifying her as the daughter of one rabbi and the wife of another.16 It is fair to assert that the Talmud displays no interest whatsoever in the study of Torah by women, which the Talmud views as anomalous at best and problematic at worst.\n\nAggadah and Gender: Thirty Years of Scholarship In considering the relationship of women to Torah study, we turn to recent scholarship on aggadah and gender. In the 1970s and 1980s, there was a surge of interest in discussions about women in classical Jewish texts. Early studies17 that mined rabbinic literature for insights into the status of women in Judaism focused on halakhah, attempting to describe the legal status of women in Judaism.18 At the same time, there was some interest in aggadah, since aggadah could be cited to support competing views of Jewish attitudes toward women. Rabbinic stories were also cited as evidence for the existence of extraordinary Jewish women, women whose actions did not conform to gender stereotypes. For those who argued for a broader role for women in Jewish life, these stories were inspirational. For those who defended the status quo or those who condemned Judaism as patriarchal or antiwoman, these stories were exceptions that proved the rule. What these articles and books had in common was a tendency to read rabbinic stories as if they were historical sources.19 This approach was adopted by both academics20 and nonacademics.21 There was also a willingness to read stories out of their literary context and to read stories uncritically, using aggadah to create “biography.” In fairness, this approach had been used by important scholars of rabbinics, including Louis Finkelstein and, in his early work, Jacob Neusner, and was not called into question until the early 1980s.22 At the same time, it rendered early forays into the topic somewhat questionable as serious scholarship. Explorations of the feminine in aggadah in a critical, scholarly context are a more recent development. These studies offer a varied approach to rabbinic aggadah. In Mine and Yours Are Hers, Tal Ilan considers the\n\n46 Pa rt I: C l as si c a l T ra di t i on\n\npossibility of using aggadah as a source for recovering women’s history. Ilan begins by discussing the attempts of other scholars to “recover” specific women—Beruriah (identified at times as the wife of Rabbi Meir and/ or the daughter of Rabbi Hananiah ben Teradion, Palestinian rabbis in the 2nd century c.e.) and Rachel, the wife of Rabbi Akiba. Ilan’s discussion of the work of other scholars focuses on the importance of reading rabbinic aggadah critically, recognizing that the literary goals of redactors are paramount and that these stories are often “a-historical.”23 Despite her critique of her colleagues’ work, Ilan believes that rabbinic literature can be a valuable resource for scholars of women’s history.24 While most of her book focuses on legal traditions, she titles one chapter “Extracting Women’s History from Aggadah.” Ilan acknowledges that aggadah consists mainly of stories and that these stories are first and foremost literary compositions that should be read utilizing tools developed for literary analysis. Nevertheless, Ilan argues, “Having discredited aggadah as worthless for historical investigation, I now wish to suggest that it can nonetheless be used as a reliable historical tool for the study of Jewish women’s history.”25 Ilan suggests that rabbinic stories primarily employ “free, male, adult Jews” as characters, employing slaves, women, and gentiles only when those personal traits are “necessary” for the story. On the basis of this argument, Ilan claims that since in purely fictional literature a women [sic] would be mentioned only if she has a specific feminine function, one mentioned in a midrashic tradition, is probably historical if she appears within an episode or story to which she is not inherently critical or where her role could just as well have been played by a male.26\n\nIlan’s thesis is an intriguing one and allows her to make historical claims about some female characters in individual aggadot. However, even if one were to accept Ilan’s criteria, her method offers extremely limited results. One cannot dispute Ilan’s conclusion that even if she could collect all the aggadot that meet her criteria for containing historical information, they would “not yield a vast amount of information about real Jewish women of the rabbinic period.”27 Whatever promise aggadah holds for those interested in Jewish women, that promise is not of great significance for those concerned with women’s history. Few scholars share Ilan’s optimism on recovering history from agga‑ dah. A more common approach focuses on literary analysis of rabbinic\n\nWomen and Torah Study in Aggadah 47\n\nstories and seeks to draw insights into rabbinic culture from these stories. This approach is used by Daniel Boyarin and Jeffrey Rubenstein,28 and elicits valuable observations about the centrality of Torah in rabbinic culture and the apparent conflict between the study of Torah and marriage and family. Boyarin’s Carnal Israel: Reading Sex in Talmudic Culture focuses on rabbinic culture’s understanding of sexuality and the body. In his analysis, Boyarin considers many aggadot about marriage, female origins, and desire. Boyarin argues that rabbinic literature adopts a positive attitude toward female desire and sexuality within marriage.29 At the same time, he also acknowledges that the Babylonian Talmud highlights the tension between a life devoted to the study of Torah and family life. In particular, a set of stories in b. Ketubot 62b-63a offer ample evidence that the redactors of the Babylonian Talmud realized that devotion to Torah often required that a man abandon his wife and children for long periods of time, sometimes resulting in poverty, infertility, and emotional distress for wives.30 In his acknowledgments, Boyarin explains that his book had its origins in a discussion about “Beruria [sic] and the study of Torah for women in the Talmudic period.”31 The chapter of the book that resulted from that conversation, chapter 6, begins with the statement that “classical Talmudic Judaism denies women access to the most valued practice of the culture, the study of Torah.”32 Boyarin argues that opposition to women studying Torah was particularly strong and univocal in Babylonia. Boyarin reads the Babylonian Talmud’s stories about Beruriah in light of Rabbi Eliezer’s dictum “A man who teaches his daughter Torah teaches her lasciviousness,” for, despite Beruriah’s learning, she comes to a bad end.33 Boyarin’s work offers readers a nuanced view of sexuality and gender in rabbinic culture. It also reinforces our sense of a sharp dichotomy between men and women in rabbinic culture, particularly in the area of Torah study. Women are not potential students and teachers of Torah—the only woman named as a student of Torah is eventually revealed as just another frivolous woman—and marriage and family are described in opposition to devotion to Torah. Jeffrey Rubenstein’s work offers a model for reading Talmudic stories, insisting that these stories or aggadot should be read in the broader context of the often halakhic passages (sugyot) into which they are embedded. Reading stories in context, Rubenstein argues, allows us to understand the ways in which stories in the Babylonian Talmud were reworked from earlier narrative sources. Furthermore, reading in context allows us\n\n48 Pa rt I: C l as si c a l T ra di t i on\n\nto appreciate the insights these stories offer about the rabbinic culture that produced them.34 The stories that Rubenstein analyzes focus on Torah and rabbinic authority. Women occasionally make appearances in these stories as the wives, sisters, and daughters of rabbis. Rubenstein considers the actions and words of these women as important elements in the literary units he analyzes,35 but his work makes it clear that women are marginal figures in rabbinic stories. This marginalization of women is evident in another of Rubenstein’s books, The Culture of the Babylonian Talmud. In that book, Rubenstein explores that culture through analysis of stories about rabbis that consider the study of Torah, the rabbinic academy, lineage, and relations between rabbis and nonrabbis. One chapter focuses on rabbis and wives. Rubenstein argues that Torah study, an activity pursued exclusively by men, inevitably created tensions for the sages in relation to their wives and families. Because women did not participate in the dominant aspects of rabbinic life—study, collegiality, master-disciple relationships—they could not share in the concerns most important to the sages.36\n\nNot only were women excluded from the study of Torah, they were seen— as wives and as symbols of family life—as distractions from the study of Torah.37 Rubenstein’s analysis of b. Ketubot 62b-63a underscores the tension between marriage and Torah study. Rabbis are portrayed first and foremost as lovers of Torah, not of their wives. Sometimes the intense devotion of a rabbi to his studies has disastrous consequences for the sage,38 but often the consequences of a rabbi’s prolonged absence from his family have the greatest and most problematic impact on his family.39 What also emerges from Talmudic stories is the powerful desire of rabbis for the Torah, which is presented as an alternative to the eroticism of marital relations.40 As we saw in the story of the student who hid under his teacher’s bed, the study of Torah displaces the wife as the focus of the rabbi’s energy. In a similar way, the strong bond between two sages, study partners, or teacher and student can displace the bond between husband and wife.41 Rubenstein’s work offers both a model for and a challenge to those interested in studying women in rabbinic aggadah. Rubenstein rightly notes that removing a story from its broader context in a Talmudic sugya skews the story and impairs our ability to “read” it as a cultural artifact. At the\n\nWomen and Torah Study in Aggadah 49\n\nsame time, it is difficult to “read” women in context, because there is no place in the Babylonian Talmud in which women are the subject of a sustained discussion. This is true even in halakhic discourse, because, for the rabbis, women are always the Other, the object of men’s control and desires. It is even more the case in aggadah, where women are occasional characters flitting on and off the stage of the rabbis’ drama. If the culture of the Babylonian Talmud is, as Rubenstein asserts, the culture of the rabbis, of Torah study, of the beit midrash, then studying women requires that we read in the margins and not in the center, at times sacrificing context in order to consider marginalized figures.42 While Boyarin and Rubenstein view aggadah as a window into elite culture, the culture of the rabbinic academy, other scholars see aggadah as equally informative about folk culture. Galit Hasan-Rokem, an Israeli scholar of folklore, argues that rabbinic midrash shows the influence of many institutions, that “the academy and the synagogue . . . were also open to other socializing institutions, above all, the family, rural and urban public spaces, and the political, commercial, and artistic discourse of the time.”43 Hasan-Rokem presents aggadot as multivocal texts that “represent both the elite and the broader layers of society.”44 Hasan-Rokem’s work offers a venue for recovering women’s voices in midrashic texts. While she acknowledges that one cannot hope to recover the narrative context of folk literature through study of stories committed to writing fifteen hundred years ago, she does believe it is possible to find within these texts “clear marks of the social context within in which they were created.”45 In a chapter entitled “Social Context of Folk Narratives in the Aggadic Midrash: The Feminine Power of Laments, Tales and Love,” Hasan-Rokem “highlights the perspective of women, both as characters in the stories and as part of the society creating folk literature.”46 The chapter goes on to highlight stories in Lamentations Rabbah that portray women as mourners, martyrs, and intercessors. Hasan-Rokem’s analysis focuses on themes of birth and death, strength and compassion, and violence and love, underscoring themes of masculinity and femininity. One of the stories Hasan-Rokem cites deals with God’s response to the destruction of the Jerusalem temple. While God, according to Lamenta‑ tions Rabbah, allows the Romans to destroy the temple, God is also overcome by grief. The prophet Jeremiah is sent to summon first the patriarchs and then Moses to comfort God and to intercede with God on behalf of Israel. They come and offer counsel, but God is unmoved. “At that moment, Rachel leapt before the Holy One”; unbidden, she pleads the case\n\n50 Pa rt I: C l as si c a l T ra di t i on\n\nof the Jewish people. She does so by reminding God of Jacob’s love for her, love that was thwarted when Laban decided to replace Rachel with her sister, Leah. Rachel claims to have warned Jacob of her father’s plan and to have provided Jacob with a way to see through the ruse. However, in the end, Rachel became a party to her father’s and sister’s deception of Jacob. “Later, I repented and suppressed my desire, and took pity on my sister so that she would not be shamed.” Rachel not only teaches Leah the sign she had given Jacob; she lies under the bed and speaks for her, so that Jacob will not recognize that he is making love to Leah, not Rachel. Given her compassion, Rachel argues, surely God should show compassion for Israel. We are told, “Immediately, the mercy of the Holy One . . . was stirred, and God said, ‘For your sake, Rachel, I will restore Israel to their place.’”47 As Hasan-Rokem points out, Rachel’s presentation differs on several levels from those of the patriarchs and Moses. They are summoned; she comes of her own accord. They speak of momentous events in the history of the Jewish people; she speaks of her personal struggle. They speak of justice; she speaks of love, loyalty, and empathy.48 This story highlights a woman speaking with a woman’s voice about women’s concerns, and it is that voice that impels God, frequently portrayed as an angry, violent father-figure, to relent and show compassion to Israel.49 Another avenue of research focuses on aggadot that offer rabbinic expansion of the stories of biblical women. This type of work allows scholars to explore the ways in which the classical rabbis dealt with women whose behavior challenged rabbinic views about women’s roles in society. How did rabbinic exegesis grapple with God’s command to Abraham to “listen to the voice [of Sarah]” or Deborah’s leadership of the Israelites during the period of the judges? Was Michal, the daughter of Saul, a “bad” daughter because she deceived her father to save David? How is Esther’s marriage to a non-Jewish king read by rabbis who saw intermarriage as a threat to Jewish continuity? Research on aggadot about biblical women also challenges feminist arguments about the patriarchal nature of various Jewish texts. There is a school of thought that presents the Hebrew Bible as a text with “a remarkably unified vision of humankind” in which women have “the same inherent characteristics as men.”50 For Tikva Frymer-Kensky, the “Otherness” of women in Judaism is a legacy of Israel’s encounter with Greek thought and culture.51 Analysis of rabbinic aggadot about biblical women may serve to test Frymer-Kensky’s thesis.\n\nWomen and Torah Study in Aggadah 51\n\nOne analysis of such stories is offered by Leila Leah Bronner in From Eve to Esther.52 Bronner explores rabbinic traditions about a variety of biblical women. Her work suggests that there was no single rabbinic approach to biblical women. Serach bat Asher, a woman mentioned only in passing in biblical genealogies, becomes, in Bronner’s words, a “heroine” in rabbinic aggadah and is credited with informing the aged Jacob that Joseph is still living and with identifying the burial place of Joseph when Moses and the Israelites are ready to depart from Egypt.53 Deborah, portrayed in an unabashedly positive light in Judges 4-5, is criticized in rabbinic literature for her haughtiness.54 Biblical women, whether praised or criticized, are never portrayed in aggadah as students or teachers of Torah. While the patriarchs are said to have studied Torah, the same is not true of the matriarchs. Women described as prophetesses in the biblical text or accounted as prophetesses by the rabbis are never portrayed teaching Torah in aggadic discussions. While aggadot about biblical women may attribute positive virtues and character traits to them, they also underscore the rabbinic assumption that Torah study is and has always been the province of men. Perhaps the most fruitful work done on women in aggadah is scholarship that acknowledges that aggadah, like halakhah, is androcentric and that all of classical rabbinic literature represents a male point of view. Studies that begin with this acknowledgment nonetheless see the value in exploring images of women in aggadah. The most comprehensive of these studies is Judith Baskin’s Midrashic Women. Baskin recognizes that rabbinic literature “preserves a variety of competing interpretations and opinions” in diverse documents that were composed over several time periods.55 At the same time, Baskin argues, “the shapers and expositors of rabbinic Judaism were men and the ideal human society they imagined was decidedly oriented towards their own sex.”56 Baskin reads rabbinic texts aware that even women’s “voices” in these texts are mediated through male sensibilities and assumptions about women. Baskin’s work focuses on midrash, which she sees as the “basic literary method of the rabbinic enterprise,”57 and her focus is on midrash aggadah. Baskin, like Rubenstein, acknowledges the importance of context in reading aggadah.58 This acknowledgment is reflected in her decision to restrict her primary analysis in each chapter to “one or two lengthy and contextualized aggadic passages.”59 If Baskin goes beyond the “context” of a given text, relating one passage to other aggadot on the same theme, it is because she believes that “one cannot work with aggadah and aspire to a high\n\n52 Pa rt I: C l as si c a l T ra di t i on\n\ndegree of systematic exposition.”60 She may also agree with other feminist scholars that the absence of women’s voices and unmediated women’s experience in the rabbinic corpus necessitates going beyond the confines of individual talmudic sugyot or midrashic musings on a biblical verse. Baskin’s work explores a number of issues that are important to our understanding of rabbinic ideas about the nature of women. The first and last chapters of her book focus on the “Otherness” of women in rabbinic literature. Analyzing a passage from b. Niddah 31b, Baskin notes that the distinction between males and females begins for the classical rabbis at birth, when a male “comes into the world with his provisions” but a female comes into the world “with nothing.” Of course, all children are born “emptyhanded”; the passage’s editors see men as equipped to make their way in the world, whereas women must depend on others (presumably male relatives) for sustenance.61 While women are seen in this passage as more in need of men than men are of women, the passage goes on to claim that it is the way of the world that men “go in search of women [i.e., wives] and women do not go in search of men [i.e. husbands].” This, too, reflects women’s nature; created from the rib of man, woman is compared to a lost object that is sought by its “owner” and cannot actively seek restoration to that owner but must wait passively to be (re)claimed. The creation story in Genesis 2 and the story of Adam and Eve’s expulsion from the Garden of Eden in Genesis 3 are used by the rabbis to assert gender differences and to explain and justify the subordinate position of women. In a chapter entitled “Why Were the Matriarchs Barren? Resolving the Anomaly of Female Infertility,” Baskin argues that aggadic texts on female infertility “convey important insights into the dilemma of suffering and the efficacy of prayer.”62 Because female infertility is a recurring motif in the Bible, which describes three of the four matriarchs as barren, these ag‑ gadot also provide “examples of the ways in which biblical models could become paradigms and symbols of empowerment in women’s lives.”63 The matriarchs’ responses to their barrenness, as imagined in rabbinic literature, portray biblical women as women of faith and compassion. Sarah affirms that God controls fertility, rejecting the folk remedies offered to her, amulets and spells.64 While the Torah describes Isaac praying on behalf of his barren wife,65 at least one midrash claims that Rebecca, too, prayed on her own behalf.66 The Torah portrays the relationship between Leah and Rachel, sisters who became the wives of Jacob, as highly competitive and antagonistic; nonetheless, midrashim imagine Leah praying on behalf of her barren sister.67\n\nWomen and Torah Study in Aggadah 53\n\nBaskin’s presentation of aggadot that portray women as active agents on their own behalf is reinforced in my own work. In “Men Imagining Women Imagining God: Gender Issues in Classical Midrash,” I argue that, in classical midrashim, women are portrayed as “confident supplicants before God.”68 These aggadot involve biblical women addressing prayers to God in response to a number of situations, including barrenness, imprisonment, and threats to the Jewish people. In these stories, women do not hesitate to hold God to account. Beseeching God to free her from the house of Pharaoh, Sarah reminds God that, although her husband “Abraham went forth [from Haran] on [the basis of God’s] assurances, I went forth because of [my] faith.”69 Sarah’s claim for divine protection is rooted in her willingness to leave her home for destinations unknown on the strength of faith in God, despite receiving none of the promises God directed toward Abraham.\n\nDangerous Knowledge: Women and the Manipulation of Torah At least one woman’s prayer to God includes a barely veiled threat based on her knowledge of Torah. In a lengthy analysis of Hannah’s prayer for a child (1 Samuel 1), the Talmud considers the significance of the words “If You will look” (1 Sam 1:11). Playing on the repetition of the Hebrew verb “to look,” the Talmud suggests that Hannah said to God: Master of the Universe, if you look [favorably upon my request], all will be well. If you do not look [favorably upon my request], I will go and conceal myself [as if I were committing adultery] against Elkanah my husband. When I do this, they will administer the waters of jealousy to me. [This will result in pregnancy], for You will not allow Your Torah to be regarded as false, and it is written, “[But if the woman has not defiled herself and is pure], she shall be unharmed and she shall become pregnant” (Num 5:28) . . . this teaches that if she was previously barren, she will now conceive.70\n\nHannah is presented here as a woman who knows the law and is willing to use it to her own advantage. A virtuous woman, she is nonetheless prepared to feign adultery to force God to give her a child. The Talmud’s discomfort with this strategy is displayed in the comment of Rabbi Akiba, who says, “If so, all barren women will conceal themselves [in order to\n\n54 Pa rt I: C l as si c a l T ra di t i on\n\nconceive].” Using the test of the bitter waters as a fertility treatment is a dangerous ruse, threatening the confidence of husbands in their wives’ chastity and raising the possibility that a virtuous yet barren woman might come to question the truth of the Torah upon which Hannah is relying. This story is only one of several in which women use the Torah or their knowledge of Jewish law to manipulate the legal system, challenging the decisions of God and man. In b.
