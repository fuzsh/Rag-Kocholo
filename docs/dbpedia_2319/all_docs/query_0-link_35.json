It was nurtured by the longing I felt for the Israel I left behind; it stood before me in the books I chose to read, and informed many of the courses I taught about Israeli literature and culture at Brandeis, Princeton, and George Washington University. Had I lived in Israel at that time I may not have noticed so readily the sweeping changes that transformed the country so much. But I lived far away, and the great distance from home and the sense of removal I felt from it sharpened my vision and at the same time drove me to bridge the gap by staying almost obsessively connected: I read several Israeli newspapers a day, watched newscasts, followed popular television programs, and remained connected to Israel in the many ways made possible by the rapidly growing Internet. The great hopes of the Oslo years in the mid-1990s made my sense of removal deeper and more frustrating still. I was too young to be permanently impressed by the victory in the Six-Day War—I was seven at the time—and too old to believe that the 1982 war in Lebanon would really protect the Galilee—I was twenty-two at the time and on reserve duty for the first time. For my generation, then, Oslo seemed like the End of Days, that blissful time of peace with our Arab neighbors we were promised time and again since childhood. Being away from an Israel that seemed so cool and so “happening” was exasperating. This book was conceived as an attempt to channel these frustrations. The fact that the Oslo hopes did not materialize only makes their promise more alluring. I hope this book captures this promise and allure.

As expatriate members of the “Oslo Generation” we tried to bring our far homeland closer by endlessly discussing it. Many of our discussions found their way into this book in one form or another and, one hopes, improved it. I also want to thank another colleague and friend, Gidi Nevo of Ben-Gurion University, for carefully reading the manuscript and giving me the benefit of his keen intellect. My partner, Mike, has been by far the greatest source of inspiration and encouragement. His passionate interest in Israel, his affinity for its people, and his remarkable feeling for its culture constantly challenge my own understanding and views, sharpening and focusing them in ways that I believe and hope have benefited this book very much.\n\nT4763.indb xi\n\n8/19/08 8:53:10 AM\n\nTHIS PAGE INTENTIONALLY LEFT BLANK\n\nIsr a eli Cu lt u r e bet w een t h e T wo I n t ifa da s\n\nT4763.indb xiii\n\n8/19/08 8:53:10 AM\n\nTHIS PAGE INTENTIONALLY LEFT BLANK\n\nIN T RODUCT ION\n\nT\n\nhe last two decades of the twentieth century brought profound changes to Israel and opened it up to increasing outside influences. Throughout the 1980s, the country also experienced accelerated economic development and the establishment of a Western, capitalist society, a trend which was expedited by the influx of hundreds of thousands of Russian immigrants in the early 1990s and symbolized by the signing of the Oslo Accord in 1993. These developments, the addition of nearly one million workers and consumers to Israel’s economy, and the first real chance at peace with the entire Arab world, brought Israel much closer to Western consumerist society, exposed it to its popular culture, and began to change it in significant ways. The most notable of these changes was the apparent demise of Zionism, the powerful ideology which, in the span of merely fifty years, gave birth to Jewish nationalism and then to the modern state of Israel.1 The weakening hold of Zionist ideology was not necessarily a negative development. Many saw it as a sign of health that marked the country’s maturity and signaled the next stage in its evolution. Like any liminal stage, however, it was a period that engendered fear, confusion, and doubt, all of which found concerned expression in the culture’s literature. Since its strong ideological beginnings in the nineteenth century, modern Hebrew literature has often been used by readers to take the nation’s pulse, as it were, to follow its development and understand its inner workings. This book attempts to do something similar, to examine what contemporary Israeli authors have to say about the alleged decline of a national ethos that united Jews for one hundred years and about the arrival of a post-national age in Israel.\n\nT4763.indb 1\n\n8/19/08 8:53:10 AM\n\nOne of the illustrative ways Hebrew literary critics characterized and distinguished literary generations from one another during the past century has been to focus on the common use and function of the narrative voice as an expression of the age.2 Thus, the anguished and introverted voice of the lonely first-person-singular narrator in many works of the Hebrew Revival came to symbolize the hesitant and precarious beginnings of a new Hebrew culture in the Land of Israel at the beginning of the twentieth century. Similarly, the first person plural of the following literary generation, the Yishuv or 1948 Generation, came to symbolize the next stage in the Hebrew cultural revolution and its success in establishing a cohesive national culture whose members strongly identified with it at the expense of more personal concerns. The turn to a plurality of first-person narratives after the establishment of the State, during what is commonly called the State Generation, marked a break from the group culture of the first native Israeli generation and a rebellion against it. This book suggests the emergence of yet another cultural generation in Israel, which, beginning in the early 1990s, can be distinguished by a new voice, the “first person dual” of the romantic couple. Although the first person dual does not exist as a grammatical category in Hebrew, the sense of the pronominal narrative voice in many literary works from that time is neither that of an individual “I” or of a communal “we,” but that of the romantic duo (“Myynvwar Pvg”). Since Gershon Shaked completed his monumental study of modern Hebrew literature between 1880 and 1980, few literary historians have attempted to follow his example. The reluctance to do so can be attributed to a lack of adequate historical perspective, which the proximity to the new literature bred. Another, more compelling reason, perhaps, may be related to the arrival of the so-called postmodern age in Israel at the end of the millennium, an age wary of positivistic studies like those of Shaked, who based his work and organized it according to his professed attachment to Zionism.3 Instead of a definitive history, then, the proximity in time to the literature in question produced numerous studies that focused primarily on its impressive expansion and diversity,4 while the attempts to classify it focused on defining that literature broadly as postmodern.5 Since both of these observations about literary diversity and postmodernism are expansive and somewhat vague, I would like to draw in the following pages a more specific map of Israeli literature during the last two decades. The chart I suggest here is made more precise by limiting it to a shorter period of time and focusing on fewer writers. The time I examine in this book is that between the two Intifadas, 1987 to 2000, and 2\n\nT4763.indb 2\n\nIsraeli Culture between the Two Intifadas\n\n8/19/08 8:53:10 AM\n\nthe writers I consider here are Etgar Keret, Gadi Taub, Uzi Weil, and Gafi Amir. Keenly expressive of the profound changes Israeli society underwent in the last two decades of the twentieth century, these four writers struck a new narrative voice. Instead of the common Zionist “we” of previous generations or the individual “I” who rebelled against it, Keret, Taub, Weil, and Amir adopted an unaffiliated Me and You, an alternative romantic narrative that focuses on coupling and privileges personal love over communal and national attachments. Characterized by terse narratives that usually unfold in urban settings, the First Person Dual writers seem to have abandoned the grand Zionist story of the past in favor of a narrative that is both smaller and larger in scope—the preoccupation with romantic love as the ultimate fulfillment of the human condition. The works of these writers, unlike those of writers from previous literary generations, appear largely unconcerned with Jewish identity, Jewish nationality, or Jewish history. Moreover, their move away from the particular and the local toward more universal literary themes, and especially the construction of the romantic experience within a capitalist framework, is distinctly marked by the abandonment of the tension between individual and community, a tension that has stood at the center of modern Hebrew literature since its inception. Instead, these writers seek to realize themselves within the confines of a couple rather than in relation to a community. By the appellation “romance” or “romantic love,” which I use freely and expansively throughout this book, I mean the way contemporary culture, as represented especially by the entertainment industry and the mass media, idolizes what it refers to as “true love”—that is, the kind of monogamous coupling based on mutual attraction and sustained by continuous devotion that was first conceived of and popularized during the nineteenth century. Popular phrases such as “soul mate” or “the one,” which can often be read or heard in many popular movies, mostly Hollywood romantic comedies, capture this sense fairly well. Peculiarly, the liberal sexuality that the mass media reflects and promotes in the West is also accompanied by more conservative “romantic” values that privilege the kind of faithfulness associated more readily with medieval courtship. A good measure of naivety and often even childishness is required to maintain such simplistic idealizations that go against common cultural practices.6 Guilelessness and innocence, then, whether genuine or contrived, are also part of the way I apply “romantic” in my analysis. Surprisingly, it is this quality that distinguishes this group of writers and makes them an emblem of a time that was marked by a burst of Introduction\n\nT4763.indb 3\n\n3\n\n8/19/08 8:53:11 AM\n\nliterary activity and that witnessed the remarkable growth of a variety of distinct literary voices: women, Mizrahim, gays, the religious, Arabs, and others. Throughout the 1990s these writers were mentioned again and again in the daily press as well as in more academic venues, individually and as a group, as the voice of a new Israeli age, an age that is alternatively called postmodern or postzionist. Their resonance in an increasingly fragmented society and the ability of these First Person Dual or romantic writers to reach across a plurality of voices by constructing a fragile but distinct voice is the subject of this book.7 This modest study does not purport to be synoptic. At the same time, although it makes no claim to continue the kind of comprehensive classification Shaked offered, it does something similar by different means. The map I chart here suggests the contours of a cultural “age” by presenting a very small but evocative group of writers during a fixed timeframe. With the exception of Etgar Keret, perhaps, the four writers chosen for inspection here were not the most central literary figures of the decade (a decade whose extraordinary literary ferment and diversity makes such determinations very difficult anyway). Various other writers, especially female writers, may have been more visible and prolific. Some were arguably better. Many of them, like Savyon Liebrecht, Dorit Rabinyan, Yael Hadaya, Tzruya Shalev, Leah Aini, and Mira Magen, also privileged romance and eschewed more national concerns. But while their works underscore the premise of this book, they do not present the kind of emblematic similarities that can be more readily gleaned in the works of Etgar Keret, Gadi Taub, Uzi Weil, and Gafi Amir.\n\nThe scant attention modern Hebrew works historically gave to romantic love makes the preoccupation of the First Person Dual writers with it especially intriguing. The development of modern literature in Europe, especially the rise of the novel, is directly linked to romance as an individualizing force, a mode of rebellion, liberation, and fulfillment in an increasingly bourgeois, capitalist, and secular world. The very European term for the novel, román (from “romance”), makes clear the extent to which the literary form itself centered on relations between the sexes.8 Generally speaking, this was not the case with modern Hebrew literature, which waged a different cultural war at its beginning and focused more on reforming the Jewish community and forging new connections between its members that were not based on religion. There were, to be sure, genuine attempts to incorporate romance into modern 4\n\nT4763.indb 4\n\nIsraeli Culture between the Two Intifadas\n\n8/19/08 8:53:11 AM\n\nHebrew letters. The most obvious example would be the very first modern Hebrew novel, Avraham Mapu’s 1853 Love of Zion (Ahavat tzion). Other notable examples come from the Hebrew Revival at the end of the nineteenth century and beginning of the twentieth (Berdichevsky and Gnessin, for instance). But most of these served more ideological than romantic concerns. While Mapu’s novel was a maskilic critique of the moribund Jewish community of his day, the precarious freedom that Revivalist heroes won from their traditional Jewish communities often came at the expense of their love lives, which tended to be tortuous and abortive. That is, the failed love affairs of the uprooted young Jew, the Talush, were yet another indication of his existential limbo, stuck between the declining old world and an unknown Jewish future. More contemporary successors of Revivalist writers, the New Wave writers of the 1950s and 1960s in Israel, used romance in similar ways. Amos Oz epitomized this in his signature novel of the period, Michael sheli (My Michael, 1968), when he endowed the love life of the heroine, Hanna, with distinct national symbolism. The same can be said for New Wave female writers like Yehudit Hendel, Amalia Kahana-Carmon, and Ruth Almog, who, generally speaking, seem more concerned with a feminist agenda than with the potential for romance in their works from that time. The focus of these women writers on physical and psychological interior spaces and on the political dynamics of romantic relationships is especially important for this study because in the long run it legitimized such concerns, leading eventually to the emergence of the romantic writers. This does not mean, of course, that Hebrew literature knew no romance (S. Y. Agnon, for instance). But a comparison to other literatures, certainly English, French, and American literatures, which from the 1960s on exercised a growing influence on Israeli culture, will reveal that romance occupied a secondary role that usually served communal, Jewish, and Zionist politics. One of the peculiar characteristics of the romantic texts in this book is the recurring urban environments they present, whose setting and imagery often seem taken from generic American films and television programs, including bars, gun-toting detectives, nightly taxi rides in the city, and beautiful, mysterious women. In this “capitalist realism,” as Eva Illouz calls it in her illuminating study about the connection between love and modern consumerism, romantic love is perceived as inherently liberating and individualizing, a mode of rebellion, escape, and fulfillment in an increasingly alienating world.9 It is after all a commonplace that romantic love replaced religion in twentieth-century Western culture Introduction\n\nT4763.indb 5\n\n5\n\n8/19/08 8:53:11 AM\n\nand has become one of the most pervasive mythologies of contemporary life in the West. But since nationality, not religion, held center stage in Zionism, the closer identification with the West and the eager adoption of its values, especially love, eventually undermined Israeli nationalism, not Jewish religion. In Israel, this kind of romantic consumerism occurs most conspicuously in the rebellion of post-army Israeli youth, who take prolonged trips abroad, especially to the Far East. These excursions serve a double purpose. The most obvious one is to disengage physically and mentally from a dismal Israeli reality that is still stuck, as it were, in a primitive and anachronistic conflict while the rest of the civilized world is out having fun. Another purpose is to foster a closer association with the West through the consumption of tailored tours to exotic locations, replete with extreme sports and drug parties that characterize youth culture, especially in Europe.10 Today we know that these changes were not as enduring, and that in many ways, the economic boom and the chance for peace were artificial. But the fictive quality of both, the economy and the peace, was nevertheless alluring at the time, perhaps even more so because they were an attractive promise.11 This goes directly to the nature of the romantic writers, who perceived these trends and commented on the possibilities they held for a truly Western, civil society in Israel, an Israel that would finally be able to lead the bourgeois life it always craved. This, essentially, is the sentiment that the romantic writers express in their works, which usurp the grand Zionist narrative of the past in favor of a more Western-universalist one. While the new narrative retains elements of the former, such as the Arab-Israeli conflict, the AshkenaziMizrahi divide, and secular-religious tensions, these no longer hold the same values they held before. As part of a postmodern, post-national literary universe, they are subsumed under and serve a grander romantic narrative, to which Jewish history, culture, and identity are in many ways incidental.12\n\nThe study is framed between the two Intifadas because that time saw some of the most portentous changes in recent Israeli history, society, and culture, including the chance for a lasting peace between Israel and its Arab neighbors as well as the country’s rapid economic development and its attendant bourgeoisification. At the time, both of these were perceived as having the potential to change the country in profound and unprecedented ways. The discrepancy between 6\n\nT4763.indb 6\n\nIsraeli Culture between the Two Intifadas\n\n8/19/08 8:53:11 AM\n\nthe first Intifada, which was perceived by a majority of Israelis as unjust, senseless, and ultimately a losing fight with the Palestinians, and the unprecedented rise in Israelis’ own standards of living brought into question the very foundations of Zionism. The second Intifada, however, marked the end to some of these trends because its eruption against the country’s protracted economic slump confirmed the intractability of the Arab-Israeli conflict and resurrected Israel’s Masada complex. The romantic writers expressed many of the sensibilities—chances as well as dangers—of a new Israeli era after the first Intifada in 1987. The second Intifada in 2000, however, changed this dynamic by eliminating some of the gap that grew between the political and the personal during the 1990s and, harking back to earlier times of national emergency, drew it closer again. The following four chapters draw a literary map of the last twenty or so years in Israel. The map proposed here focuses primarily on the literature between the two Intifadas as two symbolic milestones that frame the period and inform it. Chapter 1 looks at some of the profound changes brought on by what has been termed the end of the Zionist era during the 1980s. The chapter examines the critique of the old Zionist narrative, often referred to as postzionist criticism, not only by scholars like Benny Morris and Tom Segev, but especially by writers like Meir Shalev, David Grossman, Orly Castel-Bloom, and Yosef Al-Dror, whose diverse works foreshadowed and heralded a new era. Chapter 2 continues the examination of this new era by focusing on one of its most immediately visible articulations: the growth of a new press in Israel during the last decades of the millennium. The chapter centers primarily on a local Tel-Aviv weekly, Hair, which became one of the most articulate voices of a dynamic, urban, and sophisticated young and rebellious Israeli generation between 1985 and 1995. The chapter examines the connections between literature and more popular media like Hair, which became a fertile hothouse for most of the writers who are discussed in the next chapters and inspired some of their literary innovations. Chapter 3 looks at the works of Etgar Keret, one of the best-known and most articulate voices in Israel and abroad, who spoke for a new Israeli generation that no longer abided by many of the old Zionist tenets. The chapter looks at Keret as a representative of an Israeli Generation X, a generation that did not subscribe anymore to many of the old Zionist truisms, refused to sacrifice itself unnecessarily on what it perceived to be a false national altar, and looked for new ways to express and fulfill Introduction\n\nT4763.indb 7\n\n7\n\n8/19/08 8:53:12 AM\n\nitself. Chapter 4 looks at three of Keret’s contemporaries, Gadi Taub, Uzi Weil, and Gafi Amir, who echo many of Keret’s concerns and sensibilities, especially his cultivation of romantic love as an interim solution to the ideological vacuum and confusion of the age. Finally, the conclusion looks at several works written after the second Intifada in 2000 in order to show how a new generation of young writers returns to some of the old literary paradigms abandoned briefly by the romantic writers. The conclusion makes clear that ultimately, the attempt of the First Person Dual or romantic writers to suggest alternative narratives did not last long. The breaking of the second Intifada silenced their voices and returned many of the old national concerns to center stage. As the new millennium began, the harsh reality of the Middle East announced itself ever more ruthlessly. It erected newer boundaries between Israel and its Arab neighbors, deepened the conflict between them, and returned the old tribalism in more virulent forms.\n\n8\n\nT4763.indb 8\n\nIsraeli Culture between the Two Intifadas\n\n8/19/08 8:53:12 AM\n\nOne\n\nB O U R G E O I S I F I C AT I O N A ND ITS DISCONTENT\n\nI\n\nwant to draw the emergence of romance in contemporary Israeli culture against a historical moment Gadi Taub describes so well in his study of a phenomenon he termed the Dispirited Rebellion.1 Taub, who is also one of the writers I discuss in this book, published in 1997 a collection of essays in which he defined a new Israeli generation in what is essentially a post-national era. Taub’s thesis is important for understanding the state of mind of a generation of Israelis who were born after the triumphant war in 1967 and whose consciousness was forged in an increasingly safe, economically advantaged, and militarily strong Israel.2 The romantic writers are the products of this generation and, somewhat paradoxically, derive their anxieties from their unprecedented privilege as powerful and secure Jews.3 Taub places his discussion of the changes Israeli society and culture underwent within the larger context of postmodernism—a valuable category for understanding some of the main psychological currents that shaped the age. The most important element of postmodernism in this regard is its tendency to bring together disparate elements or ingredients that do not have an immediate or apparent meaning as a unified whole (in architecture, literature, music, fashion, etc.). Taub writes that a tendency toward this kind of disconnectedness was one of the most identifying characteristics of his generation. It was an inclination that was cultivated by the mounting tension between the private and the public spheres, an increasing pessimism about Israel’s political course, a heightened frustration with the ability to change it, and an acute wish to disengage from it in order to protect one’s sanity and psychological integrity in the face of it. Very early in his book, Taub credits this sense of disconnect to the first Intifada, the Palestinian popular uprising that broke out in 1987 against Israel’s occupation of the territories following the 1967 war. He\n\nT4763.indb 9\n\n8/19/08 8:53:12 AM\n\nwrites, “As long as the political problems in Israel had to do with the nation’s very existence and Israelis agreed on a common and more or less just way to ensure it, the personal and the communal coexisted well together.” 4 But since 1967 this coexistence began to unravel, becoming increasingly uneasy after the 1982 war in Lebanon, and especially after the Intifada in 1987. “A system of values based on secularism and humanism,” continues Taub, “cannot support the occupation of another nation beyond a certain point,” and a soldier who is required to forcefully maintain this control has to find at some point a rationale for his own behavior and that of his government. If the soldier is not religious, “he must find a political justification for his actions. The search for political rationalization becomes a deep psychological need, more than just an intellectual one so that, suddenly, a lot of weight is placed on the political” (14). Among the most common reactions to this tension was a great wish to disconnect oneself from anything political, a refusal to deal with it, and a tendency to turn away from it and look elsewhere. The Intifada did not trigger this dynamic as much as it clarified and articulated it for many. The ground for this realization was laid long before the Intifada broke out, not just by the changes in the country’s material culture, but especially by so-called new historians and sociologists, whose challenges to well-accepted perceptions of Israeli history gradually entered into academic and then public discourse from the beginning of the 1980s. Studies such as Simha Flapan’s 1987 The Birth of Israel: Myths and Realities, Benny Morris’s 1987 The Palestinian Refugee Problem, Ella Shohat’s 1989 Israeli Cinema, and Tom Segev’s 1985 1949, The First Israelis, and his 1991 The Seventh Million, to name the most prominent of them, began to reexamine some of Zionism’s most deep-rooted and hallowed claims about Israel’s wish for peace, about its relations with Arabs, about its immigration and social integration policies, and about its relationship to the Holocaust and its survivors. Although these challenges were not immediately accepted and were strongly resisted by the establishment and the culture at large, some of the well-researched and pointedly argued alternative explanations they provided slowly gained credence, especially with younger people. A sense that Israel might not have been right at all times, that it was not always the victim, and that there are other, legitimate, sides to the Middle East story slowly encroached on Zionist dogma. The first Intifada broke out against this background. And when the country was rallied to fight the Palestinians in the name of some of the tired old slogans about self-defense and existential threats, the call did 10\n\nT4763.indb 10\n\nIsraeli Culture between the Two Intifadas\n\n8/19/08 8:53:12 AM\n\nnot ring so true anymore. Moreover, the discrepancy precipitated a cognitive dissonance of national proportions that could not be maintained for long. Taub quotes an angry teenager who had this to say in 1988: Life is not what it used to be, on all counts. All the great visions, which in our case means the overused Zionist vision, are preparing us for a vague fulfillment that will never materialize and designate our lives here and now as an interim stage, a state of emergency full of dangers whose end no one can predict. The paranoid assumption, even if true . . . that our proud and small Jewish state is constantly under threat, is used as a shrewd ploy to unite the people and as a wonderful excuse for all the things we ought to have accomplished but never managed to after forty years, five wars and thirtyfour records by Hava Alberstein. (19)\n\nThis heated but unusual response for the apolitical 1980s ends on a more typical postmodernist note: forty years of Zionist development are dismissed by comparing them with a veteran, folksy singer, Hava Alberstein, ridiculed here for her old-fashioned music and sentimental lyrics from a bygone, gullible era. The majority of young people who were of army age did not actively engage with this tension, certainly not politically. In fact, a sense of disillusion and political disengagement marked the age and distinguished it from past generations. Taub predicates his book on this phenomenon, which he defines by the oxymoron “dispirited rebellion.” In hindsight, hints about the shifting paradigms Taub described in 1997 can already be detected in some of the major literary works that were published almost a decade before that, novels like Meir Shalev’s 1988 Blue Mountain (Roman rusi), David Grossman’s 1986 See Under: Love (Ayen erech: ahava) and especially his 1991 The Book of Intimate Grammar (Sefer hadikduk hapnimi), Orly Castel-Bloom’s 1992 Dolly City, and, finally, the scant but extremely influential plays and other writings of Yosef Al-Dror.5 With the exception of Al-Dror’s, all of these were major works, which received wide public attention and marked a discernible change in the self-perception of Israelis.6 In its uproarious send-up of Zionism’s most cherished myth, the foundational myth of the Second Aliya in the first decades of the twentieth century, Shalev’s book exhibits perhaps the most visible change in the attitude toward the grand Zionist narrative, which was inculcated to generations of Israelis from the movement’s establishment. The magic-realist Bourgeoisification and Its Discontent\n\nT4763.indb 11\n\n11\n\n8/19/08 8:53:13 AM\n\nnovel is an ode to the extraordinary sacrifice of the pioneering men and women who dried swamps, tilled the land, and literally built the country from the ground up with their own hands at a great personal cost. But the half-imagined novel also lays bare the sheer lunacy and folly of some of these pioneers, whose grandchildren fulfill their legacy in highly ironic ways: they profit from their inherited farmland not by continuing to cultivate it but by selling it at exorbitant prices as burial ground for those seeking eternal rest in the shadow of the myth. The extraordinary success of the novel underscores its importance and reveals something about the profound changes that began to be felt at the time.7 One of the most remarkable attributes of the work is the lush world of pioneering lore it re-creates, a concoction of foundational stories and legends, slogans, modes of speech, terminology, and other trivia, delivered in an extraordinarily rich Hebrew that creates anew the lofty register of the Zionist founders without sounding archaic. Indeed, the Hebrew of Blue Mountain, and of Shalev’s oeuvre in general, is perhaps one of the most enduring successes of the Zionist revolution, whose mythological beginnings are “rearranged” in the novel in viciously funny ways. “One summer night,” the novel begins, “the old schoolteacher Yaakov Pinnes awoke from his sleep with a great start. ‘I’m screwing Liberson’s granddaughter!’ someone had shouted outside.” 8 Pinnes is a member of the old Zionist guard, one of the founders of the co-operative settlement that is at the center of the story, a kind of a has-been who still wages fervent battles against breaches in the pioneering protocol years after it has been relaxed, perhaps even abandoned. His very name is a jibe. Pronounced “Penis” in Hebrew, Pinnes is indeed a prick of sorts. “For years,” continues the story, he had chinked every crack, repaired every rent, stood in the breach every time. “Like the Dutch boy plugging the dike,” he would say as he beat back yet another threat. Fruit aphids, state lotteries, cattle ticks, anopheles mosquitoes, bands of locusts and jazz musicians swirled around him like dark waves before breaking in a slimy froth against the breastwork of his heart. (1)\n\nThe old-fashioned teacher is clearly regressive. He is a bore and a nag who thinks of himself in heroic terms that sound embarrassingly out of touch with the times (“Like the Dutch boy plugging the dike”). They may have been appropriate once, but they are not so anymore, just as the man himself is not what he used to be. He is old and confused, his hands 12\n\nT4763.indb 12\n\nIsraeli Culture between the Two Intifadas\n\n8/19/08 8:53:13 AM\n\ntremble as he buttons his khaki pants, he needs eyeglasses, and his gait is unsure: “outside he tripped over a molehill subversively dug in the garden” (2). The strict ideological way he perceives the world around him is ridiculed by the amusing mixture of natural and cultural phenomena he fights against. State lotteries and jazz musicians are considered natural disasters like locusts or the mole whose tunnels are dug in a deliberate attempt, as Pinnes thinks of it, to thwart the success of the Zionist pioneering project. The sexual connotations of Pinnes’s name are directly related to the crude and abrupt beginning of the story, which opens with a joyful cry of libidinous abandon. Despite his name, Pinnes is not the one doing the screwing, an irony that is underscored by the fact that he is a childless widower as well. The brazen shout becomes then not only an indictment of the frustrated sexual energy of the pioneers, which could often be diverted and unleashed in twisted ways. The mysterious “degenerate,” as Pinnes calls the shouter, literally screws the offspring of these pioneers, or, more figuratively, their legacy. The cry itself, loud, bodacious, utterly reckless and uninhibited, is directly opposed to the ascetic restraint of the pioneers, who purported to dedicate their lives to productive labor in modesty and with few words. It is, of course, ironic that Pinnes should hear the cry, because, as the settlement’s educator, the old teacher spent his life preaching the Zionist revolution without really practicing it. At least not with his own two hands, as Zionist dogma dictated. The cry is an ironic mockery of Zionism through a warped mimicry of its rhetoric. But the remarkable aspect of Blue Mountain is not its ironic commentary on Zionism, a tradition that began with the pioneers themselves. The novel is noteworthy for the easy detachment and carelessness with which it regards them. It is not a passionate satire that focuses on the critical difference between an “is” and an “ought,” nor a parody that aims to correct a wrong, like most Zionist satires before it. The importance of the book lies in the effortless way it trifles with the pathos of the founding fathers and mothers. Shalev writes with the assurance of a secure and pedigreed son, who looks at his past with ease and good-natured humor padded by the distance of generations. This is the novel’s innovation that marks the changing times. Blue Mountain is postzionist in the sense that it does not participate in the debates about the value of Zionism that always raged within the movement. The book peers at it from a distance and regards it with a mixture of reverence and amusement. Like the mythological image of Ephraim who walks around in the novel with a giant ox wrapped around his shoulders, the book paradoxically Bourgeoisification and Its Discontent\n\nT4763.indb 13\n\n13\n\n8/19/08 8:53:13 AM\n\nvalorizes the pioneers by poking fun at them. The ox is a symbol of the tremendous pioneering feat as well as a grotesque image of its excesses. It elevates and at the same time debunks the grand foundational myth of Zionism as only someone who is very sure of it is able to do. Grossman’s See Under: Love foreshadows the new era in different ways that have more to do with the increasing influence of postmodernism at the time. The novel, as its name suggests, is preoccupied with the inherent instability of language as one of the central modes of postmodern critique. Already the title alerts readers to the quality of language as a consciously organized phenomenon whose fluid meaning always needs to be defined and fixed. The sense of linguistic uncertainty and confusion is destabilized further by the quizzical relationship between the “love” of the title and the Holocaust in the book. The tension is upheld throughout the novel, whose four distinct parts wrestle with the need to contain the Holocaust in words and bring what is essentially indescribable under the rule of language. The first part, “Momik,” re-creates the novelty and incomprehensibility of the Holocaust by introducing it through the consciousness of a young child whose parents survived the catastrophe. The second part, “Bruno,” deals with the Holocaust “linguistically” through silence, by turning one of its victims, the PolishJewish writer Bruno Schulz, into a metaphorical fish. The third part, “Wasserman,” reverses the utter destruction of European Jewry by introducing a fanciful character who cannot be destroyed no matter how many times he is executed by the Nazis. The fourth part, “The Complete Encyclopedia of Kazik’s Life,” is a short lexicon that redefines or rearranges real and imaginary events to bestow a measure of grace on the lives of Holocaust victims. The clue to the novel’s linguistic project comes early on, when young Momik tries to understand something about the nature of the Holocaust by looking it up in the Hebrew Encyclopedia. Momik loves to hold the big books in his hands, and it makes him feel good all over . . . because who are you, what are you compared to the Encyclopedia, with all the little letters crowded in long, straight columns and mysterious abbreviations like secret signals for a big, strong, silent army boldly marching out to conquer the world, all-knowing, allrighteous . . . and even though he doesn’t always understand what they’re talking about, he likes to touch the pages and feel deep in his stomach and his heart all the power and 14\n\nT4763.indb 14\n\nIsraeli Culture between the Two Intifadas\n\n8/19/08 8:53:13 AM\n\nthe silence, and the seriousness, and the scientificness that makes everything so clear and simple. (43–44)\n\nAs one of the most ambitious undertakings of the new state, the Hebrew Encyclopedia was meant to lend scientific credence to Zionism. The nearly thirty-volume work was intended to project the breadth, the permanency, and the authority of the newly established culture by bringing out a definitive guide to the universe from its perspective, just like the French and English encyclopedias did when those national cultures coalesced a hundred or so years before. Momik’s sense of comfort and delight stems from the paternalistic authority of this new guide, whose words he compares to a conquering army. Coming close on the heels of the War of Independence, the words of the Encyclopedia thus become a continuation of the conquest of Canaan by other means, drawing a minute Hebrew map of it and on it and laying claim to it as Israeli. Yet Momik’s praise is ambivalent, and his self-rebuke—“who are you, what are you compared to the Encyclopedia”—can be construed as critical as well. So is his delight in “the power and the silence . . . that makes everything so clear and simple.” The whole point of the novel is that nothing is clear or simple about the Holocaust. Momik finds out that even the Encyclopedia cannot help here. In fact, “there seemed to be an awful lot of things the Encyclopedia was trying to ignore, as if they didn’t exist” (43). In his childish way, Momik censures the Encyclopedia’s authors for their tendentiousness in selecting the entries as well as for their negligence for not completing the job they have begun (at the time the story takes place in the 1950s, not all of the volumes had been published). Read toward the end of the 1980s, Momik’s disapproval can be taken as a general critique of Zionism as dogmatic and incomplete. See Under: Love undermines this dogma by attempting to complete it in alternative ways, providing a personal map or guide as a compendium or even as a replacement for the culture’s official manuals. Grossman’s other work, The Book of Intimate Grammar, expresses the passage into a new era in less subtle ways by placing at the center of the book a protagonist who refuses to grow. Aron, the novel’s hero, is a prepubescent boy who lives in a working-class neighborhood in Jerusalem on the eve of the 1967 war. As imaginative and adventurous as he is, Aron abhors the repulsive way his friends begin to sprout hair, crack their voices, and shift their attention from the games and pranks of childhood to girls and sex. He tries to arrest his own maturation by holding desperately to his boyhood and even invents a present-progressive world, Bourgeoisification and Its Discontent\n\nT4763.indb 15\n\n15\n\n8/19/08 8:53:14 AM\n\na linguistic modality that does not exist in Hebrew, by manipulating the English suffix “ing” and affixing it to Hebrew nouns and verbs. Finally, after this inventive stratagem cannot stop the march of time either, Aron climbs into an old, broken refrigerator and locks himself in there in an attempt to freeze himself in time, as it were. Grossman’s wish to arrest time and roll it back is not exactly aimed at the resurrection of a communal coziness of an unspoiled and innocent Israel before the “big bang” of the Six-Day War. The parochial crassness, jingoism, and subdued violence that mark Aron’s milieu in the book, which frustrates and depresses him so, is a prediction in hindsight about the eventual outcome of the war. With such coarse and small-minded victors as Aron’s parents and their friends, how could it be otherwise? Nevertheless, Grossman’s creation of a young hero, precarious, sensitive, and idealistic—an important element that recurs in the works of the romantic writers, especially Keret—is a nostalgic gesture posed as critique. In the last chapter of the book, the imminence of the war and the onset of puberty for Gideon, Aron’s best friend, are frantically conflated, sending the desperate hero into a tailspin that eventually lands him in the refrigerator. “Hey, it could start any minute now, today or tomorrow,” Gideon says to Aron about the impending war everyone in the country is tensely awaiting. “What could?” asks the agitated Aron, whose mind is fixated on another imminence, the realization that his friend had already passed into the adult world. “Aron shook his head no, he didn’t understand, what was Gideon talking about? What did all his words amount to: are you or aren’t you?” he thinks to himself, wondering about Gideon’s loyalty to him and about puberty. “Aron heaved a sigh of relief, Gideon was talking of nothing but the war. But just when Aron thought he still had a chance, he noticed a dark shadow, new and kinky, where Gideon’s thigh met his groin.” Aron then demands that Gideon take off his shorts so he can make sure of it, and when Gideon refuses he chases him and forces him to submit. “He stripped the pants off the sobbing youth, pulled them down to his knees. Looked, examined. Then nodded as his eyes began to dim.” Aron then leaves Gideon with disgust and disappointment and runs away, till at last he arrived and collapsed on the ground, leaning against the refrigerator door. Slowly, as if trying to remember something, he ran a finger up his body . . . investigated his flesh, tracing the geography of the unfamiliar zone of hell. Then he stood up, pulled the cold door handle, opened the 16\n\nT4763.indb 16\n\nIsraeli Culture between the Two Intifadas\n\n8/19/08 8:53:14 AM\n\nrefrigerator . . . folded himself into the lower shelf . . . and looked up at the spangled sky. . . . There in the darkness, beyond the ring of light, he felt the whole nation waiting for the first shot, the great jump-off. Who would win and who would lose? How many would die? (341)\n\nAron’s violent refusal to grow up, poised as it is on the eve of the SixDay War, highlights some of the more problematic outcomes of that war, which exacerbated the Palestinian refugee problem, escalated the conflict with the Arabs, and deepened the secular-religious divide in Israel following the growth of the settlers’ movement. Aron’s defiance becomes a rejection of recent Israeli history, and his attempt to cleanse it of contamination is made all the more endearing by its impossibility. The juvenile Aron is a prototype of a protagonist that will appear again in the literature of the romantic writers, mounting a similar critique of the present through nostalgia for the innocence and promise of youth. In many ways, the works of the next writer, Orly Castel-Bloom, were closer to the literature of the romantic writers than those of Meir Shalev or David Grossman, and foreshadowed it more tangibly. The distinct postmodernist qualities of Castel-Bloom’s writing were noticed immediately after her first publication of short stories in 1987, the anthology Not Far from the City Center (Lo rachok mimerkaz hair), even if they were not labeled as such until a few years later.9 Almost all readers commented on the strange, discombobulated language of the texts, a pastiche of registers, lexica, modes of speech, etc., that crowd the pages in a dense and frantic disarray. By 1990 most of the critical establishment already declared Castel-Bloom a prominent existential writer, focusing particularly on her style. In an article dedicated almost entirely to Castel-Bloom’s language, Dan Miron refutes its definition as thin, meager, or coarse, as has often been suggested, and defines it instead as “tin-like,” that is, language that does not try to be mimetic or expressive but focuses instead on its automation, its clichéd quality, the fact that it no longer expresses depth or emotion. Castel-Bloom’s stories, writes Miron, “are a cruel parody on the kitschy desire for meaning.” The writer, he continues, “rejects any illusion of depth in language, in culture, in the human experience, in the privacy of the human soul, in society, in tradition and in the past.” All she sees before her is a reality “made up of a thin and dull layer of automatic and quotidian existence that hides an abyss of chaos below it.” 10 Ariel Hirshfeld concurred in his review of Castel-Bloom’s first anthology, Where Am I (Hechan ani nimtzet, 1990), which he saw as a “large and Bourgeoisification and Its Discontent\n\nT4763.indb 17\n\n17\n\n8/19/08 8:53:14 AM\n\nhorrifying image of the world as it is imprinted on the soul.” The book imparts to the reader “a sense of insult of such vast proportions that it suffuses the world with its shrieking darkness.” 11 Stylistically, then, Castel-Bloom clearly employs postmodernist techniques: language is no longer mimetic but becomes a fetishized medium, senseless, circular, a collection of signifiers without signifieds. Yet, surprisingly, the thrust behind many of these avant-garde texts seems much more conservative. Castel-Bloom’s contorted works are primarily allegories of an Israeli world gone bad.12 As a literary stratagem, writes Ortzion Bartana, Israeli postmodernism “is a satirical-allegorical protest against a harsh reality. The evil and the ugly are embellished in order to be derided and condemned.” 13 Many readers agreed that CastelBloom’s stories are “trapped in a harsh and grating reality, made up from the worst of Israeliana: brutality, violence, detachment,” and that they evince the desperation of a dead-end or no-win situation.14 The pastiche becomes an internal critique “against the oppression of absolute kitsch and the system of values it represents,” so that all we can do now “is use kitsch itself as an avant-garde weapon of last resort: the question these days is not how to return to heaven, but how to decorate Hell.” 15 Drawing on this metaphor, Castel-Bloom’s first novel, Dolly City (1992), is a master class in interior decoration. The novel takes place in an alien, futuristic Israel and tells the strange story of Dr. Dolly, an overly protective mother, whose anxious love for her adopted son almost destroys him. Much of the dense novel is hard to decipher because CastelBloom employs here one of her signature postmodern devices. She eliminates the causal connections between syntax and lexicon, between the grammatical propriety of her sentences and the nonsensical or fantastic content or “reality” they describe. The correspondence between the language and what it actually describes exists only on a technical level. The descriptions themselves make little sense. Take for example the opening of the novel, in which the narrator, the bizarre Dr. Dolly, describes the death of her goldfish. I took a plastic glass and fished up the corpse. . . . I laid the fish on the black marble counter, took a dagger and began cutting it up . . . until I had turned its body into little strips you could measure in millimeters. Then I looked at the pieces. In very ancient times, in the land of Canaan, righteous men would sacrifice bigger animals than these to God. When they cut up a lamb, they 18\n\nT4763.indb 18\n\nIsraeli Culture between the Two Intifadas\n\n8/19/08 8:53:14 AM\n\nwould be left with big bloody, significant pieces in their hands, and their covenant would mean something. I seasoned the strips of goldfish, put a bit on my finger, lit a match and brought the flame up to the flesh of the fish until it was a little charred and my finger too began to smell like a steak. Then I threw my head back, opened my mouth wide, and let the first strip of the fish fall straight into my alimentary canal. (9)\n\nThese are all proper sentences that nevertheless make strange sense or no sense at all. The analogy between Abraham’s momentous covenant with God (Gen. 15), during which the Land of Israel was bequeathed to him, and the narrator’s own absurd mockery of it is even more confounding. Who is this person, readers ask, what on earth is she doing, and why? Some of these questions clear up only after enough obsessive descriptions of this kind accumulate to invoke an exaggerated picture of a deeply sick Israel. The language makes no sense because the society it describes does not. It is a pitiless Israeli society, nasty, mean, lacking in compassion and absent of any vision for a future. What remains of the biblical allusion is its bloody brutality, unmitigated anymore by a redemptive promise or a meaningful narrative. Castel-Bloom showed an uncanny ability to articulate precisely the inchoate angst of the Israeli bourgeoisie, “to express the emptiness it feels and its inability to define exactly what bothers it behind the comforts of its privileged existence.” 16 One of her most important contributions, wrote Ariana Melamed, was the skillful way she mapped the modern soul, delicately, precisely, and subversively, “through the deliberate deconstruction of linguistic and conscious clichés and the paradoxical construction of a nightmarish world made up of the most common and immediate Israeli materials.” 17 In various interviews, Orly Castel-Bloom herself acknowledged her agenda, the motives behind her writing. “I ask moral questions; questions about our ability to live in a world like ours. I want to protest, to unite people through some action; I want justice, a sense of brotherhood. I have naïve hopes that I don’t think we should give up on. I am an idealist.” 18 These are strange words from the author of such wildly anarchical texts. But this is also the point at which Castel-Bloom adjoins Grossman and makes way for writers like Keret. The value of Castel-Bloom’s works resides in the loud cry they raise, a terrible lament of prophetic proportions about the dismal state of the country, its politics, and its culture. Bourgeoisification and Its Discontent\n\nT4763.indb 19\n\n19\n\n8/19/08 8:53:15 AM\n\nThus, the very terror that her stories raise becomes one of their most redemptive aspects because it is a terror that expresses an inherent inability to make sense of an Israeli world that lost its anchoring in a grand national narrative; a terror that is both a protest and a call-to-arms of sorts. This is not to say that Castel-Bloom is a reactionary who wishes to reinstate a parochial Zionism, but rather that she expresses a profound sense of loss on the brink of a new era. Orly Castel-Bloom has often been included as part of a group of writers who have alternatively been labeled Lean Language writers, Postmodernists or Urban writers. Various other names included the Shenkin group and the mekomon style of writing. The first name is a reference to Shenkin Street in Tel-Aviv, which in the 1990s came to represent Israel’s new urbanism with its artistic boutiques of consumer goods. The second refers to the young writers in mekomonim, local weekly papers which the media revolution in the 1980s brought into prominence, especially in Tel-Aviv and Jerusalem, and which were distributed as supplements to major newspapers.19 Keret, Taub, Weil, and Amir, the writers I call here romantic, were almost always included in that group in one constellation or another. But as I showed in my analysis of Castel-Bloom above, and as I demonstrate with respect to the other four writers later in this book, the work of Orly Castel-Bloom is more meaningful as both a precursor to the urban literature of the 1990s that makes up the major part of this study, and as an overarching influence and reference that frames that period. In terms of scope, depth, and cultural consequence the literature of CastelBloom exceeds that of the romantic writers. At the same time, until the second Intifada her frequent publications—between 1987 and 2000 she published nine different works, collections of short stories and novels— continued to articulate her existential terror in similar ways. Keret, Taub, Weil, and Amir, on the other hand, tried to divert attention from these ghosts by suggesting a romantic alternative. Their solution may have been precarious and fleeting, but unlike Castel-Bloom, they still suggested it, which is why I chose to place them at the center of this study. Yosef Al-Dror is the last forerunner to the romantic writers that I discuss here. Calling him “forerunner” is misguiding, because Al-Dror was not only a peer and contemporary of the four writers; in many ways he founded the group. He worked closely with Keret and Weil on various projects and was a remarkably creative writer who had considerable influence on them. Like Orly Castel-Bloom, Al-Dror returns in his works to the betrayal, the cultural confusion, the helplessness, and the lack of control his generation feels at the brink of a new era. He also tackles 20\n\nT4763.indb 20\n\nIsraeli Culture between the Two Intifadas\n\n8/19/08 8:53:15 AM\n\nthese frustrations by manipulating language. But unlike Castel-Bloom, Al-Dror reacts to the confusion and despair not so much by embellishing them as by mocking or disengaging from them through nonsense. In some of his later work he also suggests romance as a vague and noncommittal solution. Gadi Taub refers frequently to Al-Dror in his study and uses his work as standup comedian and writer for newspapers, television, and stage as some of the most succinctly dispirited expressions of the age. Al-Dror’s contributions to two principal venues of the cultural revolution that swept Israel in the late 1980s and throughout the 1990s, the wildly successful local Tel-Aviv weekly Hair and the equally popular television skits of the Chamber Quintet, were critical in fomenting this revolution.20 The use of nonsense was one of Al-Dror’s most inspiring contributions. First in his standup comedy act in the late 1980s, but more enduringly in his contributions to the wacky Back Cover (Hashaar ha’achori) of Hair and then to the Chamber Quintet (Hachamishiya hakamerit), Al-Dror established nonsense in the English tradition of Monty Python as one of the leading genres of his generation; nonsense with decidedly dark, introspective undertones. During the weekly’s heyday, in the first half of the 1990s, its Back Cover was the paper’s most identifiable feature. For many people it was one of the main reasons they got the paper and the first thing they read in it. A jumbled collection of anecdotes, quotes—real and invented—bits of monologues and dialogues, and flashes of wit, the Back Cover, says Al-Dror, “was the best thing that ever happened to me. It was where I was born to myself as a writer. There was no structure, no rules, and the most wonderful thing was that I didn’t have to sign my name. Everything was so loose, a sort of a vacuum in which you let language roll freely and bump against itself.” 21 Al-Dror’s confession provides a valuable insight into an era that was perhaps frustrating and confusing. But it also opened up great opportunities for a generation that rebelled against its predecessors and discarded its most cherished tenets, without yet having invented new ones of its own. In its wonderfully creative, funny, and iconoclastic jumble of intelligent nonsense, the Back Cover was an eloquent expression of the first joy of artistic freedom, imparting a sense of giddiness and weightlessness that comes from unburdening oneself of the past without yet carrying a present. Here is the August 6, 1993, issue of the Back Cover, randomly chosen, which includes the following items: The middle of the page featured a short philosophical musing disguised as drawing-room wit that Bourgeoisification and Its Discontent\n\nT4763.indb 21\n\n21\n\n8/19/08 8:53:15 AM\n\nreads: “Everything has such a multiplicity of meanings these days. People’s intentions have become so diverse, so developed and energetic that they have become entities unto themselves. You can frequently see people who have intentions only. There is no personality behind them; behind the intentions, that is. Imagine all those intentions out there by themselves without a person behind them.” Next to it we find an absurd, fake ad written in impossible Hebrew that announces: “Due to lack of need of two lines [Myvvq ynwb Krvx ya bqi] a telephone line is for sale in the Bialik area of Ramat-Gan for half the price that Bezeq [the phone company] charges (including change of ownership). 5236510.” The first item seems like postmodern commentary that contemplates the gap between people’s real needs and their imaginary desires in what one assumes to be a world that hurls an endless stream of possibilities or experiences for purchase at them. The second item, while clearly nonsensical and a spoof on similar, more practical ads of this kind, may be a disguised call to slow down, downsize, get rid of an unnecessary plenty that may be ironically contrasted to more dire economic times when Israelis waited years to have a phone line installed but may have been more content with less. This confusion is echoed in another item in the same column that reads: “Whenever I baby-sit and the baby begins to cry, I am never sure if it’s because he needs to poop or because he wants his mommy or something. What do babies like, anyway, tenderness? Violence? Do they like it hard, sweet? I don’t know. So I do what always worked for me as a baby—every time it cries, I give the baby a hundred dollars (Tamara Brody, the new girl of the Back Cover).” The lack of compassion and connection between the girl and the baby stems not only from the fact that she is a “rented” mother. The girl also talks about the baby using inappropriate and vaguely sexual terminology and highlights the problematic commoditization of love by absurdly trying to soothe it with money. While this ultimate capitalist pacifier is obviously lost on the baby, the girl is likely also chastised for believing in it herself. Further down the column, there is a disconnected personal appeal that alludes to the romantic narrative: “Aliza, what were we thinking, sleeping in separate beds for two years? Love you, Ron.” The Back Cover was often filled with similar appeals, usually by men, who crave meaningful and lasting relationships although they seem unable to have them. The appeal here does not specify whether Aliza and Ron have separated as a couple or may still be living together. But the ambiguity is part of the problem that deepens the gap between these two seemingly close people, who are or were separated not only by two beds but by an inability to communicate. 22\n\nT4763.indb 22\n\nIsraeli Culture between the Two Intifadas\n\n8/19/08 8:53:15 AM\n\nThe categorization into genres of the items that filled the Back Cover was never clear. Were they ads, announcements, short stories, moralist proverbs, or any other literary classification that comes to mind? Part of their charm, of course, was the inability to label them neatly and their grouping together on one page in a postmodern, nonsensical jumble. The very introduction of “non sense,” humor that does not make sense, was groundbreaking in the context of Israel’s committed and ideologically mobilized culture. True, Israel has a long tradition of satirical humor, beginning most famously perhaps with Ephraim Kishon in the 1950s, continuing with the legendary 1974 television program Head Cleaning (Nikuy rosh) and then the television puppet show Hachartsoofim in the mid-1990s, modeled after Britain’s Spitting Image. But most of these satires and the many others they inspired were politically and socially motivated. True to the genre, their underlying agenda was to reform the country’s various ills. Even the successful 1950s and 1960s radio show, Three in a Boat (Shlosha besira achat), which was nonsensical to a degree, aimed most of all to showcase the country’s most famous New Hebrews like a proud parent parading his talented children before the guests.22 Al-Dror’s humor had none of these attributes. It made few references to politics, local or international, and it did not comment directly on Israeli society, which was a mainstay of Israeli humor as epitomized by the country’s longest-running and most successful entertainment trio, Hagashashim.23 Instead, it negotiated the literary worlds of other mostly Western cultures, created its own absurd world in the language, and maintained a tenuous relationship with an identifiable here and now. If it had any agenda at all it was the wish to disengage, to turn away from the social and the political, to be isolated in a virtual world of words whose apparent lack of meaning could not be externally dictated but sprang from the writer’s own imagination. In a post-Intifada world in which the traditional distinctions between good and evil, right and wrong, were no longer clear, Al-Dror’s nonsense provided not just an outlet but a kind of silent or “dispirited” protest, as Taub would call it. This was no doubt one of the main attractions the Back Cover offered: a soothing humor mingled with a peculiarly morbid sensibility whose vague “agenda” seems to have protested the loss of meaning and direction and the abysmal state of the State. Al-Dror said as much himself. Interviewed in 1993 about his new play Loop, in which he honed the kind of nonsense he wrote for the Back Cover into sharper and more philosophically poignant meditations, he Bourgeoisification and Its Discontent\n\nT4763.indb 23\n\n23\n\n8/19/08 8:53:16 AM\n\nopenly confessed that “there is no generation above us, only a vacuum.” 24 The play, he continued, “was born out of a great confusion and is meant to express it. . . . There is a generational disconnect above us . . . who do we look up to, who is supposed to show us the way, who do we learn from? We don’t even have a school to rebel against.” Confusion seems to plague many of Al-Dror’s peers; a sense of loss brought on by the fundamental changes that the country was undergoing then and which were intensified further by the economic plenty and the moral relativism of postmodernism that followed suit. All of this was played out during the first years after the first Intifada. “It was hard during those days,” says Amos, one of the characters in Loop: Psychology was at its peak, and penny-psychology was not even the cheapest thing around. Who would have thought that all the psychologists would be executed? It was difficult in those days, casual sex, casual husband, casual wife, who had a casual baby and raised a casual family. Suddenly, opportunities that came once in a lifetime began returning again and again, more and more opportunities, people buckled under their weight. Everything was possible, everything was allowed. All expectations were met and all hopes materialized, and not in synagogues or in heaven or in faith or in art. On the street, everything happened right on the street, under one’s nose, almost inside one’s nostrils, if it’s possible or acceptable to put it this way, everyone thought that this was it or that was it.25\n\nNone of these questions is solved in the play, of course, which rails against the endless stream of false “choices” whose shelf life is as short as the time it takes them to flicker across one’s consciousness. As a writer of absurd plays that rely heavily on language and create their own distinct verbal worlds as part of their message, Al-Dror seems to continue Hanoch Levin’s unique theatrical tradition. But the distinct differences between them go to the heart of Al-Dror’s role as one of the era’s cultural “ideologues.” Levin was an intensely political playwright whose plays, absurd as they were, maintained an overt relationship to a concrete Israeli reality which they presented in an almost hyper-realistic manner.26 This was also true of his singular linguistic style, which relied on the adroit manipulation of different Hebrew (Ashkenazi) argots—social, ethnic, bureaucratic—for its artistic affect. Levin was also a unique and prolific playwright, a “one-man show” who did not inspire 24\n\nT4763.indb 24\n\nIsraeli Culture between the Two Intifadas\n\n8/19/08 8:53:16 AM\n\na school. Al-Dror, on the other hand, had no commitment to politics in a traditional way, yet despite the limited scope of his output his sensibilities reverberate in many of his contemporaries’ works. To paraphrase the essence of the 1990s successful American television show, Seinfeld, Al-Dror essentially wrote about nothing. But as with Seinfeld, his minute preoccupation with “nothing,” with the small absurdities of everyday life that often involve an obsession with words or phrases, examines human relations in a world of shifting and unstable values of gender, race, family, and friendship. Or as Al-Dror himself put it once: “It is becoming gradually apparent that no one has an identity,” that is, not while they are engaged in doing something. Identity means consciousness. You know who you are because you and others remember something about yourself, but actually, you are not anything while you are engaged in doing something. I am who I am because my little dog recognizes me.27\n\nIn an attempt to describe his second and last play to date, The Obvious (Hamuvan me’elav),28 Al-Dror provides the following summary of the work: A salesman of dialogues who believes in ultimate ambivalence meets a messenger who believes in clarity and decisiveness. The messenger, who claims to be sent by Everybody, forbids him to be ambivalent anymore. The salesman appeals the request but is turned down. Two actors who believe in success at all costs join the salesman and argue with him about the perception of reality. One of them leaves while the other stays. An actress, who is tired of being treated as a sexual object, even if it is a legitimate one, approaches them in search of an emotional connection. She also argues with the salesman but at the same time, from the force of habit, carries out a functional relationship with the remaining actor. Between the Messenger, the Woman, the Actor and Ticking Time the Creator’s mental condition deteriorates until he achieves a sort of inner peace.29\n\nThe most fundamental function of language as a system of stable signifiers, a human invention that endows voice utterances or words with mutually agreed-upon values, is questioned here. We understand the word good to have several definitive qualities that we perceive as positive, Bourgeoisification and Its Discontent\n\nT4763.indb 25\n\n25\n\n8/19/08 8:53:16 AM\n\nworthy, valuable, and so forth. Even if we deviate from these meanings for various effects, we depend on a common and stable value to produce those effects. One of the most nagging questions Al-Dror asks over and over again in all of his writings is: what happens when these values begin to shift, when some people begin to doubt and question them or replace them with different values of their own? 30 This is very different from Hanoch Levin, whose angry diatribes against the establishment are reformatory in essence and rely on the stability of language for their satirical affect. The doubts Al-Dror raises about linguistic values express his pessimism about the reality he lives in, his inability to make sense of it, or literally its non sense. Asked what exactly he is accused of, a character called “Creator” in The Obvious blames another character called “Citizen” for “emptying words of their meaning, secretly and without permission . . . replacing depth with superficiality and internal with external, deliberately sabotaging the mysterious and the complex, mortally wounding the absurd and the paradoxical, kidnapping terms and selling them on the sly, cultural manipulation . . . severing morality from everyday life and diminishing the ability to tell good from evil.” 31 Here, very concisely, we have Al-Dror’s complaint about the world and the times in which he lives, as well as his own role as an artist. Significantly, the characters in the play are not given names. Instead they are called Creator, Citizen, Young Woman, Alef, Bet, and so on. Al-Dror does not think that this makes the characters less human and more symbolic. “It doesn’t make them less real,” he insists; “this is how people around me speak and behave.” But it does give his work a passionate ideological bent. Devising characters who are named after the entity, quality, or trait they represent was one of the hallmarks of medieval literature in Europe, for instance. It marked the ideological intensity of a deeply religious society that put little value in the individual personality of mortals and considered ideas such as God, heaven, and hell far more concrete than the realities of everyday life. In the medieval imagination, spirits and demons were far more real than living men. Al-Dror’s use of a similar device in his play, his engagement with ideas and ideals, seems like a protest against a contemporary culture that falsely claims to believe in individuality and to hold it above all else. This is true especially in Western societies which purport to uphold the belief in the uniqueness of each and every human being and the supreme value of his or her life, but betray it repeatedly in their politics and economics at home and abroad.32 Al-Dror is not only targeting here 26\n\nT4763.indb 26\n\nIsraeli Culture between the Two Intifadas\n\n8/19/08 8:53:16 AM\n\na fraudulent secular dogma. He also blames capitalism, which insincerely worships at the altar of an allegedly hallowed individuality. The choices that the forces of the market offer are meant to maximize profits, not to promote equality and compassion, even if they cunningly appear to do so, like Benetton’s ads, for instance, and those of countless other retailers. Part of the dynamic created in free-market democracies that promotes this flawed sense of freedom and equality is the exaggerated focus or importance given in its arts and letters to the personal, the individual. The natural course of this historical development in the West, from ideologically symbolic representations in religious art and literature to the increasing concentration on the personal in the novel and beyond, is only part of it.33 Al-Dror seems to point out that in late capitalism, as the last half of the twentieth century is sometimes called, there seems to be an increasing collusion between politics, economics, and art that is expressed most acutely in an inherent relativism that takes the form of the devaluation of language and the disappearance, diminution, and blurring of ideology as a consequence. In Israel, the outbreak of the first Intifada brought this process into high relief. The slow erosion of the Zionist pioneering ideals, which is the natural course of any realized ideology, was not accompanied by an equal change in Zionist rhetoric or self-perception. When the Intifada broke out, it acted like a sudden shock that revealed the large gap between words and actions, between the self-righteousness of Zionism, the magnitude of its hyperbole, and its ugly policies toward the Palestinians. Once this disparity was exposed, it was not long before the ethos or ideology itself began to be questioned and then charged for precisely those transgressions the Creator in The Obvious enumerates: for “emptying words of their meaning secretly and without permission,” for “cultural manipulation,” for “severing morality from everyday life,” and for “diminishing the ability to tell good from evil.” 34 Perhaps this is the reason behind Al-Dror’s insistence on devising a play that refuses to construct verisimilitudes of real people, but instead insists on engaging with ideals on a more pure and rudimentary level as a way to return them to public debate and awareness. The exaggerated focus on the personal rang false for Al-Dror, because, in his experience, opinions of individuals were disregarded in the real world in the same way that individual rights were disrespected and ignored. What Al-Dror seems to be protesting, then, is the way we become victimized by bigger forces that lull us into submission by frivolously bandying about lofty words, words whose real meanings are often discounted. Bourgeoisification and Its Discontent\n\nT4763.indb 27\n\n27\n\n8/19/08 8:53:17 AM\n\nThe disturbing inconsistency that was laid bare during the Intifada between Zionist preaching and practice was further aggravated by the wholesale importation of superficial free-market economic ideals as a kind of substitute for a discarded Zionism. The rapid bourgeoisification of Israeli society during the 1980s and 1990s produced a sense of confidence that had nothing to do with the actual ability of the country to address many of its remaining internal and external problems. The variety made possible by affluence, like the proliferation of consumer goods and services, media venues, and entertainment choices, did not change the makeup of Israel’s troubled society and did not take it out of a wartorn Middle East, as much as Israelis wished it or imagined it. “I hate style,” says one of the characters in Loop, “I hate little sandwiches with Italian dressing, I hate dressings, can’t you get it through your head. Do you really think that by eating a baguette for breakfast you internalize Europe?” This was another aspect of a new postmodern, postzionist era that Al-Dror found distressing, the confusion between image and substance, and indeed the frequent mistaking of image for substance, as his musing about the disconnect between people and intentions discussed above makes clear. Most if not all of Al-Dror’s works inherently feed on confusion and add to it or ignore it rather than bring order to a confusing world, as we often expect from art. Loop, for example, leaves the characters with neither a solution for nor a hint at the root or cause of their problems. The play, Al-Dror explains, “suffers from the very symptoms it describes” because “it was born out of a deep sense of confusion and aimed to express it.” 35 From an artistic point of view, this may be wrong, he admits, because while the artist is expected to bring order to chaos, he, Al-Dror, does not do so in his plays. But Al-Dror could be selling himself short. His second play, The Obvious, which in some ways continues his first play, does suggest a solution of sorts. Loop concludes with a reverberating imperative given by the female protagonist to the male protagonist to “go, beat off.” In The Obvious, the solipsism of masturbation is abandoned in order to explore the possibility of a relationship with another person. The play is a story that begins with a wedding and ends with a partnership or “couplehood” (tvygvz), explains Al-Dror, a difference that is clearly marked by the playwright. In a postmodern era replete with such abundance of symbols, says Al-Dror, many objects and ideas are emptied of their original meaning and begin to function as symbols. Conversely, many meaningful symbols are deprived of their former meaning. Marriage, Al-Dror points 28\n\nT4763.indb 28\n\nIsraeli Culture between the Two Intifadas\n\n8/19/08 8:53:17 AM\n\nout, is one of them. As an institution, marriage has lost a lot of what it meant in the past: Creator: In the communication age, from the moment human beings, and especially women, become objects that can be bought and sold, any connection between them will always have the emotional detachment of a commercial act, albeit with some of the excitement that usually accompanies a successful transaction, but nothing more than this, which wreaks havoc on the heart.\n\nAt the same time, it also gained a new meaning, glamorous perhaps, but empty. Creator: Why have a wedding? Citizen: There’s an interest to see you married. Creator: With her? Why? What for? Citizen: For nothing immediate. It’s a long-term strategy. Creator (bitterly): Yes, I know the strategy. Citizen: Some people would consider it as the height of their career. Creator: Only people who have a career! (106–107)\n\nThe question which the play raises is how clear and how obvious the obvious really is. Getting married in the past was something no one thought too much about. It was an obvious social rite of passage. If you were not married after a certain age, it raised all kinds of suspicions against you and forced you to prove your innocence. “Everyone around you lets out a big sigh of relief after you’re married, and that sigh could put out a forest fire,” says Al-Dror.36 The problems start, he continues, once you begin to reevaluate the obvious. “If you use marriage as a way to gain social legitimacy it ceases to be a personal, private affair” and becomes a public performance you put on in order to present yourself to society in a certain way or as a way to fit in.37 Hence his description of the play as a story that begins with marriage and ends with couplehood. Al-Dror wants to go beyond the patina of the symbol and perhaps even discard it altogether. He is much more interested in exploring love as a condition of being rather than to engage with its hollow, socially prescribed and sanctioned representation known as “wedding” or “marriage.” As they hug and plan a future together, Creator says to Young Woman in the play: “You know, people say that there’s a place in Scotland where it’s foggy all year round. Wanna go there?” This is by no Bourgeoisification and Its Discontent\n\nT4763.indb 29\n\n29\n\n8/19/08 8:53:17 AM\n\nmeans a definitive solution to any of the questions Al-Dror raises and which remain unclear, literally enveloped by fog. Significantly, however, Al-Dror does not leave his protagonists to contemplate and confront these questions alone. Their coming together as a couple, isolated so romantically, in fact, in a foggy location in Scotland—and away from Israel—is a solution of sorts. It is not only a respite that suffices for now, but in some ways also an act of rebellion and defiance. Al-Dror was one of the most incisive commentators of the postIntifada era, quick to expose its inherent absurdities, keen to treat them artistically, and shrewd to present them in the country’s emerging new entertainment venues—standup comedy, urban weeklies (mekomonim), and expanded television programming. Paradoxically, however, he was not very visible. He was a standup comic before this imported art form gained wide popularity. He did not sign his name to his contributions to the Back Cover. As a writer for the Chamber Quintet his name was buried in television credits that rolled by too quickly. His two plays were minor productions that drew a small audience of cognoscenti, and his artistic career seems to have come to a halt with them. Al-Dror was, however, more of a writers’ writer, one of those cultural figures whose influence on other artists exceeds in many ways that of their own work. Y. H. Brenner comes to mind in this regard. Many of the more visible “romantics,” especially Etgar Keret and Uzi Weil, worked closely with Al-Dror and continued to develop his acute sense of disconnectedness and absurdity, and his preoccupation with meaning in a “meaningless” post-national and postmodern age, in their literary and other works. Significantly, too, they continued to explore his “romantic solution.”\n\n30\n\nT4763.indb 30\n\nIsraeli Culture between the Two Intifadas\n\n8/19/08 8:53:17 AM\n\nTwo\n\nPOPUL A R MEDI A IN A P O S T- N AT I O N A L A G E\n\nS\n\nince the romantic writers, like all other writers, were products of their age, I want to consider in this chapter some of the cultural aspects that distinguished the last decade or so of the twentieth century in Israel. Of these changes, one of the most significant was the rise of a new press. The creation and proliferation of new media outlets did not only express and record the profound changes Israel was undergoing. Because the romantic writers participated in these new media early in their careers, their journalistic beginnings render important insights into their more enduring works. This chapter looks closely at one of the most important of these new media, the Tel-Aviv weekly Hair. First, because the magazine was prominent. Second, because it was published in and about Tel-Aviv, which, more than any other city in Israel, symbolized the new era. Third, because in the works of the romantic writers, all of whom lived in or around the city, Tel-Aviv is not only the background to their stories. In almost all of them it appears as one of the characters as well. The emergence of a new press in Israel in the 1980s as an expression of the rapidly changing times has been amply recorded, most comprehensively by Oz Almog in his encyclopedic 2004 Farewell to Srulik: Changing Values among the Israeli Elite.1 The local Tel-Aviv weekly paper Hair occupies an important place in Almog’s cultural analysis, although it is not the only newspaper he focuses on, of course. Another important bellwether was the daily Hadashot, started in 1984 and nicknamed the first “national local paper” (mekomon artzi).2 The daily earned the moniker because it was inspired by the successful local weeklies (mekomonim), among them Hair, that began four years earlier. Designed as a hybrid between a tabloid and a yuppie magazine, Hadashot was, as Almog put it, “a liberal, modern, young, urban, dynamic, witty, provocative, and critical” newspaper, styled after English and American models.3 As such,\n\nT4763.indb 31\n\n8/19/08 8:53:18 AM\n\nand as this long string of adjectives attests, it also meant that it was a “TelAviv” newspaper—a paper which openly and unapologetically viewed the affairs of the country not from some “objective” national perspective as much as from a Tel-Aviv one, from within the Bubble, as the city is often called in Israel, because of its unique and independent nature and its perceived dissociation from the rest of Israeli culture in the way of many cultural urban centers (New York, Paris, Cairo). In some respects, Tel-Aviv was always a cultural bubble that stood apart from its immediate Israeli environment, a fiercely secular and doggedly hedonistic city, whose denizens saw themselves at one and the same time as Ur Zionists and as citizens of the (Western) world. While ideological and political Israel was fighting for survival, independence, and security—soldiers defended the borders, kibbutzniks made the desert bloom, new immigrants populated new frontier towns—the inhabitants of Tel-Aviv seemed always to be going to the beach, strolling leisurely in the streets, and especially to be drinking coffee, preferably espresso.4 Or so it seemed to the rest of the country.5 It was not that Tel-Avivians did not feel part of Israel; they did, but their insistence on leading a normal life in defiance of the country’s many abnormalities earned them this reputation. For people who lived outside of Tel-Aviv, this behavior did not seem right somehow. It was also seen as disrespectful of the sacrifices others were making. At the same time, residents of Tel-Aviv considered themselves not only models of normality but also model Zionists. Since one of the most powerful motives that animated early Zionism was to “normalize” Jewish life, Tel-Avivians held on to that creed even if sometimes they had to invent that normality.6 During the 1980s, this sense or view gradually gained momentum that was boosted and disseminated by the growth of the local weeklies and the adoption of their “local” sensibilities by national newspapers like Hadashot. This does not mean that Hadashot was a parochial rag that reported about local, Tel-Aviv matters. The paradigmatic shift it signaled was that, first, the solemn reporting about politics and the supreme affairs of the state, which occupied the media prior to that time, was pushed aside in favor of more immediately sensational news, like crime and human interest stories. Second, having been shifted aside and demoted, the affairs of the state and the conduct of its leaders were subjected to an ever increasing censure by a growing number of critics who adopted a “Tel-Aviv perspective”—that is, a perspective that focused on domestic affairs rather than on security and foreign relations. Many of these domestic affairs consisted of social and economic issues that were 32\n\nT4763.indb 32\n\nIsraeli Culture between the Two Intifadas\n\n8/19/08 8:53:18 AM\n\nneglected during years of Arab-Israeli conflict. They also included a substantial focus on issues relating to the country’s developing middle class. The shift was not only thematic, it was stylistic as well. Hadashot distilled many of the journalistic innovations that had been brewing in the media for about a decade before and presented its readers with an admixture of “vulgarity and discernment, highbrow and lowbrow, sensationalism and conservatism, patriotism and criticism, young and old, trivial and important.” 7 It was a so-called postmodern concoction that came to define the new media during those years. This was true not just for Hadashot but also for local weeklies like Hair, which gave a chance to a generation of young journalists, unable to get ahead in the more established national media, to launch their careers. All of the writers or “cultural agents” reviewed in this book were involved in the country’s various new media venues in some capacity or another. Etgar Keret wrote film reviews for Hadashot and later collaborated with Yosef Al-Dror, Uzi Weil, and others on writing scripts for the wildly successful television show The Chamber Quintet (Hachamishiya hakamerit). Gadi Taub began his media career as a host on a children’s television show and then joined the local weekly Tel-Aviv. Uzi Weil wrote for Hair, and Gafi Amir was a teenage journalist who later also worked for the weekly Tel-Aviv and other papers. The 1987 uprising in the territories, later known as the Intifada, highlighted many of these innovations because the human and civil-rights dimensions of the popular revolt coincided with a heightened sensitivity to these issues by a maturing Israeli middle class. Hadashot was the first paper that recognized it and did not mistake the Palestinian riots in the territories for another Arab war on Israel.8 Its sympathetic stance toward the Palestinians—in a reversal of traditional roles, the Palestinians were seen as a weak David beat up by an unjust Israeli Goliath—was soon adopted by other newspapers. Even Hair, which was not concerned with politics in the usual sense, began reporting more frequently about the Intifada—although, following Hadashot, and true to its “local patriotisme,” Hair’s reporting was even more “parochial,” of course. At first, the riots were treated by Hair as a curious media event, something that could have been going on in Greenland or Patagonia. It had little, if any, effect on life in the city. But that was precisely the problem. Although the Intifada did not impose any visible disruptions to the city’s life, its effect was more psychological, conscientious, or ethical. The longer the uprising dragged on and the greater the misery of Palestinians became, the less viable it was to stay morally unimplicated in what was going on Popular Media in a Post-National Age\n\nT4763.indb 33\n\n33\n\n8/19/08 8:53:18 AM\n\nin the territories, especially for the denizens of Tel-Aviv, who were doing so well. As a local paper, Hair had an approach and a commitment to politics that were naturally different from those of the national papers, all the more so since it was not the local paper of just any old city, but the paper of the Israeli city, Tel-Aviv. Hair promoted first and foremost not just a new civil society but also a new consumerist society. Most of its pages were dedicated to raising readers’ awareness about their various municipal and civic rights and to discovering new consumer products and new ways to consume them: foods, restaurants, clothes, décor. These were very welcome breaths of fresh air, which the residents of the city relished. Finally, they felt, the rest of the country was catching up with them. After almost fifty wrenching years of conflict and strife, it was legitimate, natural, even commendable, to cultivate “a measure of natural and comfortable permissiveness devoid of any hang-ups,” as the clever and acerbic columnist Doron Rosenblum put it.9 Doron Rosenblum, together with several other distinct commentators who wrote in Hair, most notably Eli Mohar, came to define the ascendancy of a new bourgeois culture. This was a culture, as Rosenblum so succinctly put it, which could finally take pleasure in the little joys of life. There was much Rosenblum made fun of in Hair’s obsessive navelgazing and its penchant for fantasy and self-aggrandizement. “Immediately after it first appeared,” he wrote in an article commemorating the mekomon’s fifth anniversary, Hair “pounced with the verve of immigrants from other cities on the invention of a gigantic Tel-Aviv, metropolitan, artistic; a city of sins and theaters, a local Manhattan or a petit Paris.” 10 From its first day, continued Rosenblum, Hair was extremely meticulous in its conceptual invention of a “Tel-Aviv,” The paper began counting, sometimes with too much gravity, the buttons and knots in every notions store; it marked the number of sesame seeds on every bagel and gave them names; it reviewed with the thrill of a museum critic shop after shop, curlicue after parapet, [artisan] cheese rack after [homemade] pickle rack, and did not forget to comment on the last one-eyed cat.\n\nWhether invented or not, the new dynamic took hold until, finally, it was not possible anymore to distinguish between what was authentic and what was merely a pretension, wrote Rosenblum. “Words propped the city up. Tel-Aviv really became colorful and diverse, happy, self-aware, 34\n\nT4763.indb 34\n\nIsraeli Culture between the Two Intifadas\n\n8/19/08 8:53:18 AM\n\nand full of options.” If reality sometimes did not live up to its description in the weekly’s pages, that was its own fault, not Hair’s, wrote Rosenblum. It made no difference anymore whether the myriad of entertainment spots and the instant celebrities were created first on paper or vice versa. Both existed in mutual dependency. But Rosenblum did not only criticize. He found much to celebrate in these new and exciting developments: Hair . . . [is such] a pleasant habit. . . . It is part of the weekend routine and a central part of the Tel-Aviv invention itself. . . . In its first five years this paper . . . has brought the spring to Tel-Aviv in the dead of summer: a bit of intimacy, a certain weekend joy. It doesn’t slake a thirst as much as it articulates the hunger of an entire generation: an appetite for silence, for individuality, for nonsense, for bagatelles, for peace, for simple weekend calm, for the small pleasures of body and soul, for a measure of indulgence and silliness, for the humdrum of a tranquil town, for small pleasures, . . . for the invention of culture and all those other pieces that make up the very big thing called normalcy. (My emphasis.)\n\nIf, wrote Rosenblum, normalcy will not come from above, maybe it will rise from the bottom. If political change will not hasten its arrival, maybe the decision of a no-name gallery owner to declare himself a masterpiece will bring it about. And it must have worked, Rosenblum concludes his review, because “Tel-Aviv has bought all of the wistful fibs about itself, lock stock and barrel.” His critical conclusion notwithstanding, Rosenblum was clearly proud of his newly discovered city and especially of Hair, its leading voice. From a journalistic standpoint, he asserted, “it would be hard to exaggerate the importance of the historic breakthrough that the weekly made,” which was first and foremost a generational revolution. This is something Oz Almog points to as well.11 Hair and other young papers like it enabled a generation of Israelis who were born with the State or a little later to express themselves publicly and independently for the first time. Until the weekly and other papers like it came along, public opinion was shaped primarily by old-guard newsmen and -women, representatives of what Rosenblum calls a stagnant Zionist establishment that still had a hold on politics and on the country’s veteran news media. Since the young guard could not push the old aside, they overtook them Popular Media in a Post-National Age\n\nT4763.indb 35\n\n35\n\n8/19/08 8:53:19 AM\n\naltogether by establishing new venues that gave voice to what Rosenblum describes as “the urban, dynamic and confused Israeli reality.” The term confused is important here, especially since the exact word Rosenblum uses, Kvbn, includes a sense of hesitancy and embarrassment that is central to the writings of Keret, Taub, Weil, and Amir. It stands in contrast to the conviction and certainty that characterized the older generation, which by the 1980s turned into what Rosenblum calls stagnant. Perhaps, he muses, the energy that was poured into art and into journalistic enterprises—verbal creations rather than more tangible ones—was a reaction against a moribund and corrupt political system, a system that seemed resistant to any real change and forced an exasperated new intelligentsia to focus on the everyday instead of on politics. Whatever it was, Rosenblum points out that Hair blazed a trail. It abandoned national and political matters and instead focused more locally and individually, inspiring many papers to follow suit. So new and so refreshing were these local weeklies that “they are the first sections you pull out of the pile of weekend papers,” wrote Rosenblum in a resounding testimonial. Eli Mohar was another important contributor to Hair, part of its cadre of urban commentators. In 1984 he began writing a running commentary for the weekly made up of his observations about little details or episodes from the city’s daily life, something like the New York Times’s Monday section, “Metropolitan Diary.” Mohar was born in Tel-Aviv in 1948 and lived in the city all his life. Before he began writing for the weekly, he was known as a popular song writer. Maybe because he was older than most of the weekly’s other contributors, he chose to give his column a somewhat old-fashioned, even nostalgic name: “Some Goings On in Our City” (mehanaaseh beirenu). In the preface to an anthology of these commentaries, published in 1994, Mohar explains that he chose the oldfashioned title in order to balance some of the weekly’s trendier proclivities, especially its penchant for slang and hyper-current Hebrew.12 Whether he meant it or not, Mohar’s name for his column brings almost immediately to mind one of the first and certainly the most memorable and celebrated collections of local Tel-Aviv lore, Nahum Gutman’s anthology of early Tel-Aviviana, A Little City and Few Men within It (Ir ktana ve’anashim ba meat).13 Gutman, who immigrated to Palestine in 1905 at the age of seven and settled in the first neighborhood of what later became Tel-Aviv, has drawn the city’s image in its infancy more palpably than any other of its early residents. In his ink sketches and short, anecdotal stories, Gutman—later one of Israel’s celebrated painters— recorded small details and random episodes from the city’s early life: the 36\n\nT4763.indb 36\n\nIsraeli Culture between the Two Intifadas\n\n8/19/08 8:53:19 AM\n\nfirst classical music concert, various human types like the town doctor, various neighbors, and physical objects that made up the town’s urban landscape, like its first streetlight, gardens, houses, trees. Mohar’s choice, if he indeed named his column as a tribute to Gutman, seems strange at first. Gutman’s stories conjure up a small,"
