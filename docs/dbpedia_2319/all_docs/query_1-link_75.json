This Arab revolt against Jewish immigration and British rule resulted in a week of terror throughout the Mandate. Maurice Samuel, a British Jewish journalist and translator newly arrived in the country, wrote his assessment of the situation in a book that appeared six months after the events and before the official government reports.¹ He described the growing tensions in the days before the violence and his participation in a delegation from the Zionist Executive that visited the inspector-general of police, Alan Saunders, on August 23, requesting he deputize Jewish men. When Saunders declined, they approached the acting high commissioner, Sir Harry Charles Luke. According to Samuel, Luke expressed his concerns that deputizing the Jews would be seen as a provocation but conceded that the police force was too small to withstand an Arab attack.² In order to mitigate the situation, Luke authorized Saunders to recruit every able-bodied British man who was willing to supplement the meager forces.\n\nThat summer, forty theology students from Wycliffe Hall were brought by Rev. George Francis Graham Brown (1892–1942), principal of the Anglican college at Oxford University, who began that excellent scheme of taking parties of young students in his charge to Palestine to get the knowledge that only sight of that land gives.³ As divinity students, they were supposed to be attending the college’s usual programme of lectures and tutorials,⁴ poring over religious texts, visiting churches, and generally taking in the sites and history of the Holy Land as groups had done in previous years as part of a travel-abroad study program. Instead, caught up in the outbreak of hostilities, they volunteered as special constables for the understaffed police force in the face of mounting tensions between Arabs and Jews. The students executed their duties with aplomb, and the British High Commissioner, Sir John Chancellor, praised their service, subsequently writing to them, If Palestine has given you less than you had hoped of her, you have bestowed upon Palestine most timely services, which will not be forgotten.⁵ Though one student was shot in the shoulder and was delayed by hospitalization, the others returned to England at the end of the summer to resume their studies.\n\nI first read about this incident as I was preparing my master’s thesis as part of my degree in Middle Eastern Area Studies at the School of Oriental and African Studies in the summer of 2001. My research examined the relationship between the historical facts around the events that took place on the morning of Saturday, August 24, 1929, in Hebron and the interpretations that they were given by the British, Jews, and Arabs. The participants narrated these events to score political points and entrench their position, a path that not only prolonged the situation in the short term but also formed the basis of ideological myths that informed all sides for decades. But the events were also given interpretations by journalists in the British press, who were concerned about the danger to British forces; the Jewish press in Britain, who were worried not only about their brethren in Palestine but also that the British government would betray its commitment to Jewish self-determination promised in the Balfour Declaration; the Hebrew and Arabic press in Palestine, whose diverse range of positions reflected political and ideological divisions in approaching the situation; and the European press, who were critiquing the British right to the Mandate.⁶ As I sat in the idyllic surroundings of the English countryside writing more than seventy years later, a wave of suicide bombings were taking place in Israel, whose interpretation in the British, Israeli, Arabic, and Jewish press were framing the contemporary events in light of the region’s history. The resonances between the past and the present seemed at the heart of why my work mattered.\n\nLater that year, I began my doctorate in Israeli literature at the University of Oxford and ultimately wrote my dissertation on the ways in which fiction and poetry have commented on national narratives. Between my training (first in Islamic studies as an undergraduate, then Middle Eastern studies, and finally Israel studies) and my research interests, I had arrived at a deep underlying and very personal understanding of the Arab-Israeli conflict that informed my scholarship from thence onward. I believed that studying the historical facts could only tell us part of why the situation was so difficult to navigate socially, politically, and intellectually and that the focus on politics tended to emphasize the perception, ideology, and achievements of the leadership without considering the social and cultural impacts. In turn, this also marginalized the voices that had informed and shaped the mythologization of history. Art, I felt, offered a way to analyze myths and see how they shape our understanding of the past, and ultimately art made space for the voices on the fringes, including women and minorities.\n\nWith this in mind, I created my first course, War and Peace in Israeli Poetry, for a continuing-education program for young adults at the Reform Synagogues of Great Britain. Despite the title, the course included poems by Palestinian authors. For, as Liora R. Halperin explains in her essay in this book, Though one may make pretensions to study Israel without Palestine or Palestine without Israel, on the basis of one’s topic of interest, the practice of scholarship requires facing both Israel and Palestine. The course was divided into six topics: The Role of the Sabra, Memory and Memorials, Contested Land, Human Relations, Daily Life, and War Cries and Peace Songs, and in later iterations of the course I added A Perfect Peace. The readings included poems by women, Mizrahi authors, disabled authors, and veterans. I have taught it in a variety of guises including public lectures, academic-credit courses, and to undergraduates at two different universities in the United States where I have been on the faculty (SUNY Albany and the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign). Later I created a second complementary course, The Arab in Hebrew Literature (which I taught first in England and then in the United States), which explores mainly fiction and includes writing by Palestinian authors who write in Hebrew (Sayed Kashua and Emile Habibi) and a Palestinian author who was born in Lebanon, lives in Britain, and writes in English (Samir El-youssef). The course includes works by Mizrahi authors on the experience of being both Arab and Jewish (Tikva Levi, Sami Shalom Chetrit, and Yechezkel Rachamim). More recently at Illinois, I created an Israeli film course that includes modules on Palestinian films and filmmakers (Hiam Abbas, Elia Suleiman, Suha Arraf, Hany Abu-Assad, and Ibtisam Mara’ana) and that I have also taught in a variety of adult-education and community settings.\n\nYet having been deeply embedded in this field for my entire professional academic career, I felt my teaching becoming stale. I was helped by becoming a fellow and participating in the Brandeis Summer Institute for Israel Studies (SIIS), a three-week intensive program for faculty, as have many of the contributors to this volume, but there were few other pedagogical resources available within the field for faculty working in the arts. In recent years, several new textbooks suited for use in history and political science courses have been published, and there is a longer history of resource collections, such as Walter Laqueur’s The Israel-Arab Reader: A Documentary History of the Middle East Conflict (1969), now in its eighth, revised and updated edition, coedited with Dan Schueftan (Penguin Books, 2016). Nevertheless, like many such comprehensive resource books meant for classroom use, there is an absence of female voices or documents from other minority groups. There are few comparative works, textbooks, readers, or anthologies designed for university instruction in the many other disciplinary fields in which the Arab-Israeli conflict is taught. There is a dearth of suitable English-language resources for undergraduate (and graduate) courses. For the most part, faculty cobble together courses with homemade readers, trading materials like samizdat. Whereas once conferences were the only opportunity to corner colleagues to discuss teaching, today Facebook has become a space for crowdsourcing suggestions for texts, assignments, and class activities. But as with all social media, the record may be permanent, but finding the informative thread, even a few days later, may prove challenging.\n\nWide-reaching historical changes in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries and two world wars in the twentieth century transformed the modern political landscape, creating nation-states where once there had been ruling empires. The global reach of these epoch-changing historical events played out in the localized region of Palestine, an administrative district of the Ottoman Empire from 1517 until it became a British Mandate in 1918 and an area often known as the Holy Land. This territory on the eastern shores of the Mediterranean has been a contested landscape for as long as history has been written. The site of successive waves of settlement and military attack for millennia, it also serves as the home of important religious sites for three major monotheistic religions: Judaism, Christianity, and Islam. While the contemporary Arab-Israeli conflict has modern political roots, this religious historical context has meant that the events in the region are of interest in large parts of the world, particularly where Christians and Muslims live, far outweighing the economic or geographic size of the land.\n\nThe Arab-Israeli conflict emerged in the shadows of European colonialism that began in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries. European powers raced to control natural resources in the New World and the Far East and later engaged in land-grabs during the nineteenth century that included taking control of parts of Africa and the Middle East. With the Ottoman Empire’s central location between the European West, and the Great Powers’ resources and political ties in the East and in Africa, Britain, France, and Germany began to see the sultan as an obstacle to their enrichment. At the same time, the presence of the Ottoman Empire limited Russian expansion beyond the Black Sea. Thus, during the nineteenth century, the Ottoman Empire faced external attacks by Russia (Russo-Turkish Wars), a desire for its dismantlement by the Great Powers (through treaties), and internal factionalism as a result of the growth of nineteenth-century nationalist political movements that began with the Greek Wars of Independence (1821–27).\n\nThe region’s connection to the Bible had made Mesopotamia, Egypt, and particularly Palestine important sites of religious pilgrimage. But these expeditions had often proved treacherous. With the introduction of steam-powered ships and the railway in the middle of the century, travel became affordable and relatively safe. In turn, this increased accessibility intensified interest in the region for scientists, botanists, historians, archaeologists, and tourists. There are more than three thousand travelogues including books and paintings of Palestine during the nineteenth century, created by primarily European and North American travelers, which further sparked public interest. In 1869, with the opening of the Suez Canal, the travel agency Thomas Cook began leading tours of the region, opening it up as one of the most desirable destinations for international travel.\n\nIn Europe, changes since the Middle Ages had affected the nature of citizenship and the attitude toward Jews. Following the French Revolution, Jews first gained political emancipation, which spread through parts of Europe with Napoleon Bonaparte’s conquests. Yet it took until the end of the nineteenth century for all of western Europe and parts of central Europe to grant Jews full legal equality. In the Russian Empire, such political emancipation did not arrive until the Russian Revolution in 1917. Yet even with nineteenth-century political emancipation, blood libels and waves of antisemitism continued. The Jewish Question—the concern that Jews somehow were not quite the same as the other Europeans among whom they lived—destabilized the very meaning of inclusion that emancipation promised.\n\nNew political ideologies began to develop both in Europe and in the Ottoman Empire, and though they started as consciousness-raising efforts by groups of intellectuals, they eventually developed widespread appeal, flowering into mass movements for political self-determination. For Jews in the nineteenth century, Zionism began as an effort at national consciousness-raising among a small elite, and waves of immigration to Palestine served to situate a modern territorial claim to a historic and spiritual homeland. Palestinian national consciousness developed locally in the Levant among the elite, in response to the collapse of Ottoman identity, as well as to Jewish immigration, and driven by the same nationalist ideologies as other movements of the time. While it found mass expression among the local population in the Peasant’s Revolt of 1936–39, the Second World War and the Arab losses in 1948 led to the movement’s suppression until its reemergence with the Palestinian Liberation Organization (PLO) in the 1960s.\n\nThe Western powers remained attentive to the Middle East in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, motivated by a rush to control former Ottoman territories and the protection of financial interests in the region. Later, the discovery of oil and the opening of the Suez Canal and the Hijaz railway served to provide new strategic interests that kept Britain, France, and Russia in competition for Palestine leading into the First World War, resulting in British and French control of regional mandates after it. The Cold War and the alignment of powers following the Second World War also encouraged the United States and the European Union to continue regional investment out of concern over Russian influence in the newly created Arab states.\n\nIt is these geopolitical and historical forces that have meant that the Arab-Israeli conflict is a global issue. Nevertheless, it is not a single war. Rather, it is a number of smaller conflicts between different countries and political groups over a range of regional issues. These disputes include territorial debates over land, water rights, and gas fields in the Mediterranean. Changing political alliances in the region, between Arabs, Iranians, and Turks, particularly with regard to religious issues; the Syrian conflict and Russian involvement; and the rise of extremist religious groups engaged in terrorism against other Muslims and Christians also affect Israeli-Arab relations and lead to changing allegiances in response to facts on the ground. Hence, the Arab-Israeli conflict should not be regarded as an inevitable, long-standing, and unresolvable historical conflict but a dynamic, complex, and constantly changing engagement whose parameters are dictated by issues of the day.\n\nThe most well-known of these smaller Arab-Israeli conflicts, and the one that has been at the center of most of the regional issues since the beginning of the twentieth century, is the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. While this conflict is no less global, its interests are localized. At its heart is the fact that two groups both claim the right to sovereignty over the same territory, and both groups claim Jerusalem as their capital. Neither Jews nor Palestinians can be considered monolithic in their political positions, religious identities, or geographic histories. Nor do all Palestinians or all Jews, even Israeli Jews, live in the territories under dispute. But we have come to think of these two groups as opposing camps engaged in a political struggle based on the competing desires for governance of the region, with diasporic communities whose reach extends the conflict beyond the land’s boundaries.\n\nThe creation of the State of Israel in 1948 led to the end of British control of Palestine, though it covered a smaller territory than the mandate. The remaining territory was occupied by Israel’s Arab neighbors: Egypt, Jordan, and Syria. In 1967, in a war with several Arab countries, Israel conquered these and additional territories containing large populations of Arabs, many of whom had originally lived within areas of mandate Palestine that came under Israeli rule in 1948.⁷ These areas have come to be known as the occupied territories. While some of these territories have been absorbed into the suburbs of Jerusalem and thus fall under Israeli law, the majority of them remain under a separate legal system of Israeli military rule.⁸ Since 1948, Israel has frequently been at war with its neighbors, though it has also made peace treaties with Egypt and Jordan. From 1964 onward, the Palestinian Liberation Organization (PLO) and then other Palestinian groups worked to raise international consciousness about the Palestinian cause, through both political and violent means, but in 1987, the First Intifada, a grassroots Palestinian uprising, moved the fight from a struggle masterminded by a leadership to a popular rebellion. This served as the precursor to the beginning of a peace process between Palestinians and Israelis. While aspects of the process remain in place, the negotiations broke down, and waves of terror and suicide bombings in Israel, known as the Second Intifada, began. In recent years, it has seemed that Israelis and Palestinians have reached a stalemate. The intractability of this conflict lies not in the inability to propose technical solutions to political issues but in the deep emotional trauma that has resulted from more than a century of violence. As with other long-standing conflicts, however, there is no reason to imagine that a resolution is impossible.\n\nTeaching the Arab-Israeli conflict is approached from numerous historical and disciplinary perspectives that include the geopolitical role the conflict has played and the global actors that continue to influence the political reality, including the European Union, the United Nations, the United States, Turkey, Iran, and the Arab states that surround Israel and the Palestinian territories. But it is also explored and situated in the more localized context of Israel/Palestine. The essay contributors here have chosen different roots to approach this topic, and the variety—including that of terminology—often reflects the particular contexts the instructors are framing.\n\nThough there continue to be many ongoing conflicts throughout the globe, few have held the international interest of the Arab-Israeli conflict, and there are few conflicts that have been as literary or that have engendered as much scholarly attention. All sides have created fiction, poetry, and films reflecting their perspectives, while historians and political scientists have fought over the facts, the narrative, and the impacts to the political reality. Anthropologists and sociologists have sought to understand these societies from within. They consider the impact of the conflict on microcosms such as the religious community, settlers, development towns, the kibbutz system, Russian and Ethiopian immigrants, Bedouin, women, and the Arab Israeli population. Scholars have studied the ways in which reality is processed by individuals (through travel or military service) and as a society at large (through memorial culture). Literature, communication, and film departments have worked to understand the ways in which communities are represented or represent themselves. Urban planners consider the situation and impact of development projects; musicians and dancers explore cultural innovations and their roots in traditions; and lawyers examine the implications of everything from the absence of a formal constitution to the impact of ruling a population that is not part of a country’s citizenry. That is to say that there are a wide number of ways to approach the study of the conflict and the region. There are courses in many fields including religion, conflict resolution, demography, economics, comparative literature, Jewish studies, film studies, gender studies, security studies, geography, tourism, education, peace studies, food studies, Mediterranean studies, international relations, urban planning, dance, music, and law. Military institutions teach the conflict in order both to use it as a case study for other regions and to prepare students should they find themselves deployed. Religious studies programs teach about the sacred sites; communications departments use it to consider children’s educational programing as a way of peace building. Planning programs teach about the conflict as a way for thinking about urban segregation and the challenge of two communities sharing water, power, air space, and telecommunication networks. In fact, there are few fields within the humanities and social sciences where the Arab-Israeli conflict would not prove a relevant case study. Teaching the Arab-Israeli Conflict is designed to help faculty planning a course to consider approaches to the topic, find relevant resources, think through possible assignments, navigate institutional settings, and consider the ways the political climate may intrude on the classroom space.\n\nThis book explores different pedagogical aspects that arise in teaching the conflict. It begins with a historical overview by Jacob Lassner. The first section, Teaching Skills, Facing Challenges: What Happens in the Classroom?, brings together essays that engage directly with classroom skills, such as close readings, critical thinking, debate, and tolerance for diverse opinions in the class space. The second section, Empathy, Access, Language and Education: Learning to See the Other, considers the meanings of othering and otherness. These essays recognize diversity not only within the conflict but also within the classroom. The focus on empathetic readings is meant to create an understanding about not only the complexity of the conflict but the ideological and lived experience that students bring when they study courses in the humanities and social sciences that engage with conflict and real-world questions. The selections of texts used in classes discussed here provide models for comparative reading that ultimately facilitate student engagement with difference. The third section, Competing Interpretations and Multiple Narratives: Teaching Diversity, questions the nature of narrative. The scholars here discuss teaching materials and in-class exercises that force students to retain a sense of competing political positions simultaneously. These chapters develop models for complete courses, particularly in literature and film, but also think about the impact of discipline on the ways we use materials. The fourth section, History, Politics, and Religion: Putting the Class(room) in Context, brings us to reflect on the institutional, political, and religious contexts in which we teach. These essays draw our attention to the particularity of teaching location in framing course content and finding the right angle for sharing the conflict’s complexities. These essays particularly consider institutional and social cultures and their potential opportunities and constraints. They also suggest ways of navigating these complexities by drawing on other local reference points for providing a starting point for access to the topic and materials. The fifth section, The Personal and the Political: When the Outside World Intrudes on the Sacred Class Space, considers the political implications of the conflict as they impact the personal lives of students and faculty. Here many teachers share their own conflicted personal journey navigating the tension between their discipline and belief system. The sixth section, Thinking Differently and Creating New Paradigms: Teaching Israel/Palestine without Repeating History, provides a series of essays that offer practical advice on creating a syllabus and framing a course. Though they refer to logistics, they also provide different theoretical models that can help faculty set out course objectives before selecting the course content and materials. The conclusion is the testimony of one faculty member’s constantly changing classroom journey. It is a reminder that as teachers we are also students.\n\nThe essays contain their own citations, but the book includes a selected bibliography of works (primary and secondary) to help instructors prepare materials for class. The annotated filmography provides information about feature, short, and documentary films, including ways to stream or purchase them. The time line situates the Arab-Israeli conflict within the larger global historical context of the past two centuries. It is meant for quick reference and contextualization, and it may prove useful in creating class exercises.\n\nIn the introduction to this book, Jacob Lassner provides an overview of the history of the region and its political ramifications. He carefully frames the competing interpretations of history, challenging any notion that the conflict is a binary between Palestinian and Israeli. Instead, he situates history into a contextualization of competing ideological positions—expanding beyond Israelis and Palestinians as homogeneous categories. His essay situates the conflict within the larger landscape of the Arab world and the Middle East and addresses the diversity within all camps, reminding us that this conflict has never been about two coherent groups with competing agendas but many groups brought under larger umbrellas who may have as much intragroup conflict as intergroup divisiveness. Some understanding of the facts of history may be necessary in teaching courses on the Arab-Israeli conflict—one that reaches well beyond a discussion of Palestine/Israel and takes into consideration competing political forces within the region. But as Marcela Sulak notes in her essay about creative writing courses that she teaches in English at Bar Ilan University, it is not only what we read but how we read that shapes our understanding. Caitlin Carenen’s history courses, Janice W. Fernheimer’s courses in rhetoric and composition built around comics, and Donna Robinson Divine’s politics courses are the subjects of just a few of the essays that directly explore this relationship between content and analysis, thinking through the ways in which we teach our students to engage with representations of these facts.\n\nCourses on the Arab-Israeli conflict are often, by their very nature, interdisciplinary, and Donna Robinson Divine, Amy Weiss, and Marilyn R. Tayler direct our attention to a variety of texts that can facilitate such engagement. Several essays consider the balancing act between teaching within a discipline and teaching context. Often faculty will use examples from other disciplines to elucidate an idea—a historical document is provided in a poetry class, or a film is screened in an anthropology course. Tayler discusses her experience of teaching literature in a jurisprudence course, in which she wants students to understand the conflicting interests of Jewish and Arab Israelis, represented by Israel’s security concerns, on the one hand, and the opposition of Arab Israelis to Israeli-imposed civil rights limitation on Arab Israelis, on the other. She explains that in her class, fiction frees students from many of their conscious and subconscious biases and preconceived notions and engages them intellectually and emotionally at a human level. Amy Weiss, for similar reasons, discusses teaching film in a history course, in which the discussion about borders and boundaries acquires a visual reality, emotionally charging the students’ encounter with the facts, so that they gain greater insight into the real costs to daily life.\n\nFor literary courses, it is frequently desirable to provide historical and political context or to explain the sociological situation that may give birth to art. Russell A. Berman through the novel, Cary Nelson through poetry, Olga Gershenson through film, Beverly Bailis through a reading of Mahmoud Darwish, Peter C. Herman using the British novel The Little Drummer Girl, Martin B. Shichtman referencing Joe Sacco’s comic Palestine, Philip Metres in his comparison of two short stories by women, and others engage with the contextualization of literature, providing close readings of several texts in poetry, fiction, comics, and film.\n\nMetres, Halperin, Alan Dowty, Shiri Goren, Joel S. Migdal, and I, in my own essay, also provide examples of thinking structurally about the creation of courses and the ways in which we constitute the students’ engagement with material. These essays share a clear pedagogical focus directed at helping teachers create courses and select suitable texts that offer complex readings of the situation, while stimulating students’ engagement.\n\nThe literate nature of the region has particularly facilitated the emergence of a range of voices in the modern period. Teaching this diversity is integral to disrupting the prejudices created through propaganda, social media, and the press that students bring to the classroom. For Rachel Feldhay Brenner, tracing the shared history of Jerusalem as a sacred space offers an avenue to ensure that students see the shared cultural history of the region; thus, reading Christian, Muslim, Jewish, Druze, and Baha’i writing together elucidates the central place that the Holy Land occupies in several religious traditions. Writing by women is replete in both Arabic and Hebrew, the two major languages of the conflict (though texts in Persian, French, and English may also provide additional perspectives), and offers an opportunity to consider female experience within cultures that revere masculinity and militarism, asking whether women’s shared experience may transcend that of national difference. Moreover, the diversity within Palestinian and Israeli culture also reveals issues of race, privilege, and the staking out of multiple diasporic sites. In Hebrew, one can use writing by Mizrahi Jews (Jews who lived in Muslim countries before the twentieth century), Arab citizens of Israel, Vietnamese immigrants, Ethiopians, and Russians, as many of the contributors here do, including Gershenson, Ranen Omer-Sherman, Berman, Nelson, and Bailis. These relationships complicate our conceptions of identification with the nation-state and the place of the individual within the conflict. At the same time, the Palestinian diaspora not only writes from within Gaza or the West Bank or in the Arabic language but also has emerged as a literary force writing in Hebrew in Israel; across the Arab world; and in an English-speaking diaspora in the United Kingdom and the United States. As Berman explains, the multiplicity of these voices allows us to consider the impact of the conflict on daily life in the region and also the shaping of diasporic identity for those who consider it a geographical point of identification but are no longer situated within it.\n\nOren Kroll-Zeldin, Bailis, Rolin Mainuddin, and Mira Sucharov also offer discussions of the ways in which courses on the Arab-Israeli conflict serve to address contemporary social justice issues within the United States and Canada. While not collapsing the distinctions between different regions and historical situations, these parallels draw students into an immediacy that reflects other conversations with which they are already familiar. It can also work to give a face to Palestinian suffering and situate contemporary movements within a larger global debate about privilege, oppression, and government responsibility.\n\nSeveral essays consider the ways in which teaching frames the material that students encounter and the role the instructor plays in crafting the narrative of the historical context and what terms are used to describe wars, events, borders, nations, and peoples, including essays by Goren and Ashley Passmore. Fernheimer addresses the issues that arise in defining terms of reference that potentially evoke the region’s tensions, characterized for example in the ways in which Arab Christians and Muslims who live within Israel are defined: as Arab citizens of Israel, Arab Israelis, Palestinians, Palestinian Israelis, the Arab minority—terms that may or may not be hyphenated. Moreover, these terms pretend to specificity, but the reality is that the groups to which these given terms refer are also debated. Are Druze and Bedouin separate groups, are they identified with the Arab minority within Israel, and can they be called Palestinian or choose to identify themselves as such?\n\nThe sites of classrooms also shape the kinds of labor demanded by instructors. The United States is only one among a large number of countries in which there are course offerings on the Arab-Israeli conflict. These include Australia, Britain, Canada, China, Cyprus, Denmark, Egypt, France, Germany, India, Ireland, Israel, Japan, Jordan, Malaysia, Poland, Qatar, Romania, Saudi Arabia, South Africa, Turkey, UAE, the West Bank and Gaza, and Zimbabwe, to name but a few. The historical, political, and social context of the institutions and geographic locations play a role in the work of faculty. Umut Uzer reflects on the legacy of Ottoman colonialism in discussing the Middle East and the complex relationship that Turks have with Arabs and Jews. P. R. Kumaraswamy outlines the issues of teaching Israel studies in India, where the conventional frames of reference that function within Western culture are absent. Like Uzer, Husam Mohamad shows in his essay that even a single faculty member may need to modify his or her teaching depending on location, for teaching within the Islamic world or another country embroiled in its own regional conflict; Mohamad found that teaching in Cyprus is not the same as teaching at an institution with a large evangelical Christian population in Oklahoma. Menna Abukhadra outlines the changing history of teaching the conflict in Egypt and the impact that the World Wide Web has had on creating immediate access to resources, news, and people.\n\nMya Guarnieri Jaradat found that the conflict intruded into the classroom, when as a Jewish woman she was told her presence was unwelcome teaching Palestinian students in the West Bank. She questions whether there are limits to what can be taught, by whom, and where, but as Adia Mendelson-Maoz shows in her discussion of running the Open University literature department in Israel, we can continue to work to make education accessible, even when that requires us to rethink our materials. Moreover, in different areas within the United States and different kinds of academic institutions, the student encounter is shaped by factors that exist beyond the classroom walls. Not only do politics on campus, including Birthright, the debate over Hillel’s relationship to Israel, Apartheid Week events, and Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions (BDS) campaigns, affect student engagement, but the economic and social demands that students encounter must also be part of our broader discussion about enfranchising student learning. Sucharov, Berman, Guarnieri Jaradat, and Ari Ariel consider the ways BDS can and does play a role in considering how and what we teach. Even as course objectives continue to focus on enabling students to develop the apparatus for critical, reasoned thinking and civil discourse, in an age of trigger warnings, faculty more than ever are asked to respect students’ feelings and backgrounds. Ariel’s discussion of hummus maps out the issues that arise in tying identity to the conflict and considers learning in relation to BDS efforts to single out Israel. Berman discusses his own political activism against BDS outside the classroom and his refusal to treat the classroom space as a captive audience for his political positions.\n\nThe essays in the volume include examples from two-year colleges, regional public universities, small liberal arts colleges (SLAC), a U.S. military service college, state universities, private universities, institutions with a religious mission, a historically black college and university, and elite schools both in the United States and abroad.\n\nSeveral essays here consider physical and experiential learning experiences in order to create empathic responses. Ellen W. Kaplan uses theater, asking students to take on the roles of Palestinians one week and Israelis another so that they learn to embody their awareness of the other. Divine teaches respect for the other by asking students to defend different political positions each week, and Passmore enables students to speak in the voice of characters as they work through their understanding of the conflict. Kroll-Zeldin and Jeffrey Bloodworth use travel to Israel and the West Bank, including walking through checkpoints, as a way to have students experience the conflict; while Randall G. Rogan has students act out conflict resolution, and Divine also invites students to participate in a model UN debate—all examples that help students engage in experiential learning. Goren using maps at Yale and Shayna Weiss using a battle plan at the United States Naval Institute invite students to reconstruct the very process of history and highlight the shaping of narratives and the ways they inform ideology.\n\nMany of the essays address institutional requirements and their application in courses on teaching the conflict, such as Carenen’s comparison of lower- and upper-division courses, Passmore’s essay on her institution’s critical thinking curriculum, or Berman’s observation that adding learning requirements moved his student enrollment from fifteen students to fifty. Terri Susan Fine’s essay focuses on the ways in which middle school and high school curriculums with requirements to teach Israel and the Holocaust engage in discussion of the conflict within the tightly regulated structures of mandated instructional criteria. Though her essay focuses on a specific institutional setting, it maps out the ways of engaging with institutional language that may also form part of having courses listed for general education requirements.\n\nMany essays move beyond this broader discussion to consider the instructor’s own personal experiences of encountering the materials and changing in the face of the classroom experience, including those by Susan Jacobowitz, Guarnieri Jaradat, and Sucharov. As Sucharov explains, we carefully and deliberately analyzed the many dynamics of activism we observe . . . on campus and social media, but keeping politics out of the class proved an uncomfortable struggle that worked against the principles of her discipline. Learning to embrace the discussion instead, she harnessed the tension within her instruction in order to make the engagement a relevant practical lesson. Jacobowitz’s horror at encountering apathy from students toward Palestinians, while wrestling with her own ambivalence toward the occupation, due in part to being a daughter of Holocaust survivors; Sherman’s discussion of the tensions he experiences as a Zionist opposed to the occupation; Guarnieri Jaradat’s conflict between her beliefs in educational counterargument and her students’ perceptions of her as a Jewish woman; and Mainuddin’s identity as a Bangladeshi Muslim, which marks him out as an object of suspicion when teaching political science about the conflict, are studies in navigating the personal encounter that faculty have with the material. Many of the essays in this volume consider whether there is a moral and political responsibility in the ways in which we teach the conflict. Can the lessons in the classroom facilitate an awareness of the region’s complexity that eschews simplistic explanations, thereby combating propaganda in the face of rigorous intellectual analysis? Can we use education to help us build bridges and work toward compassion in an effort to tear down prejudice and aim for the higher ideals of empathy and tolerance?\n\nThe book’s contributors were given two principles: first, that the essay should provide insight for someone who might face the same pedagogical problems, offering assignments, activities, and lists of resources that could be used effectively by a person in a similar disciplinary context; second, that the essay should prove useful for scholars and educators in other fields, institutions, or locations, by providing reflection on guiding principles or exploring challenges that extended beyond a specific area of study. The essays range from short, practical guides to extended analyses of the field and institutional context. I have learned from all of the essays as I have edited this collection, and often by translating ideas through my own disciplinary lens, I have enriched my syllabus as well as my teaching practice.\n\nWith these goals in mind, the book is organized by thematic topics, across disciplinary lines. Adjacent essays (even across sections) expand on related ideas. The book can be dipped into for quick inspiration or read from beginning to end—though the essays can be read in any order—as part of course planning. As such, there is some repetition among the essays—of philosophy, texts, and assignment ideas. I have left these in place so that readers will find what they most need wherever they look. Rather than impose standardized terminology, contributors have chosen the terms they prefer to use for referring to historical events, wars, and peoples, though as most of the essays show, the discussion of terminology serves a pedagogical role within the class itself.\n\nIn discussions of travel-abroad programs, Holli Levitsky, Kroll-Zeldin, and Bloodworth all consider students’ encounters with the reality of life in the region. They encourage connecting with Israelis and Palestinians, and Bloodworth’s students also stay in Jordan, where they meet Christian and Muslim Arabs—both Jordanian and Palestinian—who view Israelis and the conflicts in very different ways. Yet all of them address in some ways the need to keep their students safe on the trips. It is jarring to think that in 1929, the Wycliffe Hall students were willing to sacrifice their own security to stabilize the region. It may not be the objective of today’s travel-abroad programs to directly participate in this same task, but all of these courses serve in some ways a similar end. For all of the contributors to this volume, helping students understand the regional complexity is part of a process that leads toward a responsible citizenry. We hope that critical thinking, empathy, and respect will inform their approach to the conflict, and perhaps our students may go on to be journalists, politicians, soldiers, activists, or scholars whose actions could ultimately play a direct role in shaping the future of the region.\n\nNotes\n\n1.

Though large populations of Arabs came under Israeli rule, many had also fled during the 1948 and 1967 wars and moved to other parts of the Arab world and later the United States and Europe. Among the major issues in resolving the Israeli-Palestinian conflict has been the situation of Palestinian refugees since 1948. While many Palestinians were displaced, the actual numbers are contested by both scholars and the United Nations. Since one of the negotiating points has been a Palestinian claim to a right of return for these individuals and their descendants, or in some cases there has been the suggestion of remuneration and reparations, the establishment of precise numbers is relevant for those who are negotiating a final peace agreement. For a detailed analysis of this question of numbers, see Efraim Karsh, How Many Palestinian Arab Refugees Were There?, Israel Affairs, April 1, 2011, www.meforum.org/​articles/​2011/​how-many-palestinian-arab-refugees-were-there; Benny Morris, The Birth of the Palestinian Refugee Problem, 1947–1949 (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1987); and Alan Dowty, Israel/Palestine, 3rd ed.

In 2005, Israel withdrew from Gaza, leaving a Palestinian population to internal self-determination, while continuing to control the access of goods to the area, some infrastructure (such as airspace), and maintaining the Erez border crossing into Israel, which is generally restricted to humanitarian passes. The main route into Gaza is through the Rafah crossing with Egypt. By contrast, the West Bank is divided between areas of Palestinian rule and areas of Israeli rule, with some overlap, and Israel continues to control access from the West Bank into Israel.\n\nAcknowledgments\n\nTeaching a living conflict is for many people both an intellectual exercise and a deeply profound experience. I am grateful to the contributors here, who have reflected on the professional and personal challenges they have encountered, and their willingness to share their journeys toward making the classroom a thoughtful, reflective, and inclusive space.\n\nThis book grew out of my own need to revisit my teaching (the result is a course on women’s filmmaking that I discuss in the volume), my need to connect with other practitioners in the field to overcome the inevitable isolation of the classroom, and my awareness of the increasing globalization of this area of study, with its inherent complications. As the fields of Israel studies, Palestine studies, and Middle East studies continue to expand not only at universities in North America but across the globe, a book that helps faculty engage with the pedagogical challenges of teaching the Arab-Israeli conflict becomes ever more necessary. I want to thank Kathryn Wildfong at Wayne State University Press, who supported the project from the beginning; Kristin Harpster, my ever-patient editor; and Andrew Katz, Kristina Stonehill, and Rachel Ross at Wayne State for their expertise and trust. I am grateful to the Academic Engagement Network for a subvention grant to help with the manuscript preparation; and Martin B. Shichtman, who served as a sounding board and thoughtful reader throughout the project. I also want to thank the anonymous reviewers and the network of fellows from the Brandeis Summer Institute for Israel Studies (SIIS), many of whom contributed essays or helped connect me to potential authors. I would like to express my very great appreciation to the Washington Institute and Aviva Weinstein for arranging access to their shape files for the West Bank, settlements, and the barrier, as well as areas A, B, C. Using these and by sourcing population data from both the Israeli and Palestinian population bureaus, who kindly shared their materials, Gregory Newmark was able to make original maps for this book, and I am thankful for these resources and his work to make them happen. I owe a huge debt of gratitude to Randy Deshazo, my husband, for the significant amount of invisible labor he contributed toward creating the time line, as well as all those who advised and reflected on it, including Helene Sinnreich, Joshua Shanes, Jarrod Tanny, Jacob Lassner, Katja Vehlow, Liora Halperin, Mira Sucharov, Michal Raucher, and Husam Mohamad.\n\nThis project became deeply personal when two close mentors who had dedicated their careers to ensuring the teaching of the Arab-Israeli conflict through interdisciplinary engagement died early in its development. It is dedicated to the memory of Michael Kotzin, at the Jewish Federation of Metropolitan Chicago, a literary scholar and administrator who fought bravely against the disease that claimed his life, working to advance Israel studies until weeks before his death; and to the memory of Michael Feige, a sociologist and anthropologist at Ben Gurion University of the Negev and the Ben Gurion Research Institute for the Study of Israel and Zionism who was a friend and collaborator and whose works have informed many of the essays here. Feige’s support of this volume and our early conversations on the shape it would take were a manifestation of his intellectual generosity. We had been discussing his participation in the project when in June 2016, he was one of four Israelis killed in a terrorist attack on the Sarona Market in Tel Aviv. In a eulogy, his research institute paid tribute to him by describing him as the incarnation of a man of reason, tolerance, and peace. He lived the qualities that I hope this book embodies.\n\nMaps\n\nThe Middle East\n\nSoutheastern Mediterranean\n\nTerritory of Israel/Palestine\n\nPopulation distribution\n\nWest Bank administrative divisions\n\nJerusalem occupied and expanded\n\nIntroduction to the History of the Region and the Conflict\n\nThe Path to Genuine Peace?\n\nHistorical Perspectives on the Arab-Israeli Conflict\n\nJacob Lassner\n\nIt is now almost seven decades since the creation of the Jewish state, and yet the Arab-Israeli conflict endures, a dispute that engulfs all the nations of the region as well as much of the wider world beyond. Complex and morally vexing, the conflict has all the outward appearances of a theatrical tragedy, a performance that exhausts actors and audience alike even before the final act has begun. What is it that makes the Arab-Israeli conflict, and in particular the dispute between Israelis and Palestinians, so resistant to some sort of resolution, a question easily posed but given to varied answers, depending in large part on how past and present events in the region are interpreted.\n\nThere is a tendency among many, if not most, Western observers to view the Arab-Israeli conflict—the outgrowth of what before the establishment of Israel was called the Palestine Problem—from two distinct and, at times, seemingly incompatible points of view. The first characterizes the dispute between Israel and its Arab neighbors and between the Jewish state and the as-yet-stateless Palestinians as a dispute between modern political movements, one Jewish, the other Arab, both inspired by the rise of European nationalism in the nineteenth century. Analysts who maintain that the Arab-Israeli conflict, and specifically the dispute between Israelis and Palestinians, is driven essentially by modern politics contend that the issues dividing the parties should and could be resolved by political means: namely, extensive negotiations that build trust between the contending parties, a trust that can then lead to the kind of give-and-take that will point the way to a permanent settlement. In this scenario, cooler heads and gifted leaders will prevail. Peace has a compelling logic on its own.\n\nThe second perspective recognizes that the Arab-Israeli dispute is in many respects the outgrowth of interlocking political events that have unfolded in modern times. But it also places great stress on residual attitudes from a distant past. Those who hold this view maintain that the current situation between Israel and the Arab states is in essence an existential conflict between two faith communities, both deeply rooted in the Holy Land. That is, most Arabs are seen as tied to long-standing and deeply felt religious traditions that preclude the very existence of an independent Jewish state in the Islamic heartland. And so any political settlement that legitimizes any Jewish state compromises Islamic principle and degrades the Muslim body politic. In these circumstances, Muslims, who represent well over 90 percent of those who identify themselves as Arabs, will find it difficult to reach any sort of agreement that fully sanctions an independent"
