Some of the authors are well-known or newer talents, but not all are themselves children of survivors, for example David Grossman, author of See Under: Love, the most successful account so far of growing np in Israel under the shadow of the Holocaust and the repercussions for a young writer. This essay examines the reasons for the apparent turn-about in Israeli discourse on the Holocaust and discusses ways in which these changes are inscribed in contemporary novels and short stories. The emergence of a \"second generation\" of survivors in the mid-1980s is a phenomenon not unconnected with transformations of Israeli society, the peace process, and rethinking of the past. In particular, the issues raised by these writers confront the tensions between personal and collective identity, between memory and history, which underlie the turmoil of public debate in cont emporary Israel.\n\nThe Past That Didn't Go Away\n\nWhether, as in Jeremiah's parable of the sour grapes, the children are fated to suffer for the fathers, or whether the second generation of Holocaust survivors is a transitory phase, like the Children of Israel in the desert, is a question debated by clinical psychologists and therapists. [1] There can be, however, no doubt that there has been a painful and compulsive return to the past in writing by children of Holocaust survivors in Israel and their contemporaries. They may loosely be labeled \"second generation\" since they share similar artistic dilemmas and participate in the same existential post-Holocaust predicament, though the term is contentious and variously understood. In common with the children who came to the Land of Israel in time or children hidden during the Holocaust, their writing may be the only means to represent the unknown or unremembered experience. Like Yehudit Hendel, they revisit the vanished homeland of Poland, and, as in David Schutz's Ha 'esev vehakhol (The Grass and the Sand, 19 78), they mix expressionism with the conventions of the family romance to patch the holes in personal memory and resurrect the repressed European past in Israeli collective memory. Nava Semel, Ilan Sheinfeld and several other children of survivors have gone back to the past in order to verify its reality as more than a place-name or figment of the imagination, to literally ground memory in a geographical place but also in order to form a bridge for survivors to transmit their testimony and to perpetuate the vibrant life of communities before their destruction. I am not arguing for a new brand of secondary Holocaust literature, nor is this merely a case of belated responses to the Holocaust, though the influence of Aharon Appelfeld and other survivors can be felt in the attempts to resolve issues of representation and realism. Rather, the unexpected return of Holocaust trauma is a disturbing trend in the larger crisis of collective identity, a crisis in which the Holocaust plays an emotionally charged and ubiq uitous role which cannot be extricated from the ongoing reconstructions and deconstructions of Israeli history and Jewish identity, not least because the intrusion of the history of the nation into personal destiny is unwilled and violent, as well as for the simple reason that personal identity and memory often had to be repressed if survival was to be possible. The cohesion of personal identity was further weakened by the erasure of the Holocaust past when orphans or child-survivors who had been living under assumed names as non-Jews were brought to Israel and given new names; indicative of the mid-life collapse of assumed or enforced identities is the title story of Rinah Uziel-Blumenthal's Haetsbah shel elokim (The Finger of God, Tel-Aviv: Krikhah rakhah, 1997), and Tirtsah Dvir's memoir of her invented identities, Zeh lo hashem sheli (This is Not My Name, Tel-Aviv: Kholonot, 1998).\n\nIt is worth remembering that for many years the Holocaust was taboo. The European past of the survivors and camp-inmates (the \"sheep led to slaughter\") was negated as an abnormal exile, a nightmare that in retrospect justified the creation of the state of Israel as the only refuge for the persecuted Jews. [2] The emphasis was laid on a new life and on building a new society, cut off from the Diaspora past, which had come to an end according to a deterministic scheme of history with the reclamation of the Jews' homeland. When the Holocaust past was invoked in public discourse it was usually the story of heroic partisans who had resisted and of ghetto uprisings. For many years to be a victim was to be the opposite of the strong Sabra who was master of his destiny; it was to be a \"musselman\" or even \"soap,\" a Yiddish-speaking outsider contaminated by the inhuman conditions of the camps and by whatever price bought survival. This stigma further reinforced the misunderstanding of the survivors and rubbed off on t heir children. Besides, there was a war to be fought and there were daily problems of survival. The acceptance of reparations and normalization of ties with West Germany in the fifties, however controversial, were the pragmatic facts of a reality in which the past was eclipsed by a new state representing a secular redemption that had no place for the traumatic memory of loss and destruction. [3]\n\nYet the past did not go away, and by the mid-nineties the return to the past had become something of a national obsession. Israeli schoolchildren and soldiers were encouraged to explore their Holocaust past as a collective heritage in trips to Poland, mandatory visits to Holocaust museums and memorials, \"roots\" projects and extensive reading and instruction on the subject. Hava Alberstein, one of the first folk-singers to reintroduce Yiddish traditions into her repertoire, continued to be popular, while Yehuda Poliker, a well-known pop singer, incorporated the Holocaust theme into his album Avak ve'efer (Dust and Ashes). Public attention was saturated by a flood of films, television dramas and documentaries, plays, fiction and non-fiction, as well as media reports (especially in the wake of the Demjanjuk, Touvier, and Barbie trials, and the various attempts to recover confiscated Jewish assets in Switzerland, France, and elsewhere). [4]\n\nThe Holocaust became one of the defining moments (if not for some the defining moment) in collective memory, competing with other narratives like the Destruction of the Temple, the fall of Betar, Massada, Tel-Hai, the Balfour Declaration, Exodus 1947, and the War of Independence. [5] Together with the national and religious commemorative dates on the calendar, these were inscribed, rewritten, and variously interpreted as Israel reinvented itself as a nation state. The reasons for the transformation of silence into obsession are complex and have to do with the maturing of Israeli society, which could now find room for private identities and memories, as well as for stories of harrowing inhumanity rather than heroism. Previously the individual and the private worked against social integration in a society which demanded, at least in public, conformity with a cultural hegemony that was largely dominated by an Ashkenazic socialist elite. It also has to do with a \"post-Zionist\" revision of history and the reappra isal of Israel's moral position in the war in Lebanon and the treatment of the Palestinian Arabs during the Intifada, which reversed the roles of perpetrator and victim in the eyes of intellectuals on the Left. [6] In the eighties, a religious movement of repentance and the rediscovery of the traditions of the Diaspora past, together with the continuing debate over whether Israel was a Jewish state, a state of Jews, or a binational state, led to a public debate about national and personal identity in which the traumas of the past were never far below the surface. [7] The simultaneous legitimization of counter-memory by the Israeli left and under the Baraq government (such as the discussion of the Dir Yassin massacre in school textbooks) and the retelling of survivor testimonies as unheroic tales of gruesome horror, as in the film Habekhira vehagoral (Choice and Destiny, 1993) came as part of the revision of Israeli history and new commemorative events such as the Rabin assassination and Borukh Goldstein's mas sacre of Arab worshippers in the Cave of the Patriarchs, which further deepened the fault-lines in conflicting identities and narratives. The way in which public discourse adopted the counter-memory of marginalized or oppositional groups for shifting political agendas and government policies (especially during the peace process) only goes to show the instability of construction (or revision) of the past and the frailty of consensus. [8]\n\nIn the eighties the \"second generation\" of Holocaust survivors acquired a legitimacy that had been denied their parents. Their telling of their parents' stories became a telling of their own, an unwilled voicing of what they had not known and had not lived through. [9] It was an attempt to recover personal and collective memory from a politicized public discourse and to express something of the guilt for the stigmas attached to the survivor immigrants, perhaps also for the Jewish leadership's inability to help the European Jews in their hour of need [10] and the former denial of the relevance of the Holocaust to national identity. In some cases guilt is somehow felt for not being \"there,\" either as an expression of the desired but impossible rescue of the six million or as an expression of inferiority to those who had the strength to survive. Fantasizing an alter ego or \"dybbuk\" makes it easier to imagine being \"there\" and to tell the story of the lost Jews in order to reconstitute their life-stories. Howeve r, this \"rescue\" of memory risks overidentification with the Holocaust dead, through transposition of their suffering or role-playing, so that personal identity is called into question and the line between present realities and an imagined past gets blurred. In addition, because popular culture and the mass media have trivialized the images and meaning of the Holocaust, there is a felt need to recycle the well-worn cliches and code-words of Holocaust stories into a provocative message that would wake the next generation from moral indifference to the \"lessons\" of the Holocaust. This is one reason why Haim Maor, Rami Katsir, Roee Rosen and other artists of the \"second generation\" use recycling in their provocative art installations, which internalize the role of victim and externalize the role of aggressor; it explains also why they adopt as their identity the tattooed camp number but also play off Jewish against Nazi symbols to challenge political, artistic and theological assumptions. [11]\n\nThe Value of Love\n\nDavid Grossman (born 1954), a major Israeli novelist and social critic, is contemporary with the children of survivors, but not himself a son of Holocaust victims. [12] In his novel 'Ayen 'erekh: ahavah (See Under: Love), Grossman has nevertheless portrayed the anxieties and complexes of the children of survivors with painful accuracy, as well as with compassionate humor, in the figure of Shlomo \"Momik\" Neumann. [13] As a young boy, Momik is exposed through the nightly screams of parents and neighbors to the nightmare of \"over there.\" \"Over there\" is the cursed magical kingdom which is unknown and incomprehensible, where something has gone terribly wrong that holds the clue to the adult world around him.\n\nMomik's search for memory and identity is a search for language, and it begins with the unexpected arrival of his Uncle Anshel, a Holocaust survivor who has been kept in an insane asylum and was thought lost by his family. The arrival of Uncle Anshel, delivered like an unwanted baby in an ambulance, reawakens the traumatic memories the family has been trying to repress. The boy is drawn to the old man because he embodies the secret story that nobody wants to tell him and only he, Momik intuitively feels, can break the code of the old man's gibberish. Another motivation lies in the fact that the children's stories written in Hebrew by Anshel Wasserman before the war represent a hope in a world in which there was no hope, a fanciful hope that the \"Children of the Heart\" could keep alive the human spirit in the imagination.\n\nThe inability to fully know the Holocaust is seen in the first (to my mind the most successful) section, entitled \"Momik,\" which is narrated in the stream of consciousness of the child growing up in an Israeli immigrant housing project, Bet Mamzil, whose family and neighbors are still living out in some way or other the nightmare of the concentration camps. One way Momik tries to break the code of the secret kingdom is to turn Uncle Anshel's muteness into a storytelling that will reverse the curse and save his family from the nameless honor that has struck them all. It is like cracking a safe or spy stories, and he feels \"he's the only one in the whole world who can do it\" [14]--only he can rescue his family from the repressed memory of the Holocaust. That rescue of the Holocaust dead is a sacred mission shared by many \"memorial candles,\" the term used by Dina Wardi for the children raised as replacements for lost siblings or named for the dead. [15] First, however, Momik must learn what the Nazi Beast is, s o he reads books about the Holocaust in the public library; only then can he summon the Beast and conquer it. He effectively internalizes the experience of the Holocaust victims, copying out passages from Anne Frank's Diary and having nightmares himself. By confronting the Beast with the Jewish victim he thinks he can exorcise the nightmare that has been haunting them all, but all he succeeds in doing is drawing out Anshel's story and discovering the terror, cruelty, and power in himself. Momik confronts the Beast in the storeroom of the family's apartment, a storeroom of repressed memory, where the nameless tenor can be exorcised. The Beast is the child's instinctive awareness of evil, as William Golding showed in his postwar classic Lord of the Flies. There the Beast was actually the eminence of Hiroshima, in the form of a parachutist who drops from the sky in a nuclear world war, but which soon becomes a totem of the heart of darkness that destroys any Romantic delusion of innocence; in Grossman's novel, h owever, Momik has to recognize the Beast within himself--the \"little Nazi within you.\"\n\nThe incredible reality of the Holocaust can only be imagined as fantasy, and Grossman imagines Anshel Wasserman as a Scheherazade who tells stories each night to an SS officer in order to die, rather than to live. The immortality of the writer who cannot be shot dead makes his life in a concentration camp literally a living death, a kind of parable of what fictionalizing the Holocaust is doing: prolonging the agony of the victim and, what Adorno found most objectionable, making art out of it. The historical record is in effect abandoned for a fantasy which gives birth to a miraculous creature, Kazik. Kazik is an eternal Jew, whose entire life as an inmate of the Holocaust universe spans a mere twenty-four hours. Yet he is also a new Adam, who engenders a dictionary that redefines humanity after the Nazi destruction of language and reinstates the entry missing in other encyclopedias of the Holocaust--love.\n\nIt is love and mercy, as opposed to facts, that Ayala urges Shlomo to stick to in trying to imagine the Holocaust, yet he never seems able to realize these values in his relationship with his wife Ruth and his mistress Ayala. To know a woman is to know the daughter of survivors of Bergen-Belsen, and it is Ayala who introduces him to the metaphorical White Room. Grossman confesses that to emerge sane from the Holocaust complex, from the imagination's White Room at Yad Vashem, is not easy: \"In the White Room everything comes out of your own self, out of your own guts, victim and murderer, compassion and cruelty...\" [16] In order to imagine the Holocaust, a necessary condition for mourning and working through, Planet Auschwitz must be understood as real, as a place where, even there, stories could be told. Grossman works to challenge the \"unrepresentability\" of the Holocaust and to revise its place in official discourse. His novel is paradigmatic of the struggle to claim legitimacy for art in the wake of destru ction and to find a status for the post-Holocaust Jew beyond that of victim.\n\nIsraeli Children of the Holocaust\n\nSeveral novels centering on the experience of the second generation have won public recognition in the wake of Grossman's success. They mostly follow a trend emerging from the tradition of \"magic realism\" to recreate the fantasy lives of society's outcasts and outsiders, a trend that by its nature resists any attempt to forge a single meaning out of the Holocaust and assimilate it to national identity. [17] Among them is Lily Perry-Amitai's Golem bema'agal (Golem in a Circle, 1986), which exemplifies the attempt to break out of the circle of silence and non-communication by a young woman designated by her grandmother as custodian of the memory of \"over there.\" Dorit Peleg's eponymous central protagonist Una (1988) is so engrossed in the dream figure of a child from the Holocaust that fantasy cannot be separated from reality. Itamar Levi's Agadat haagamim ha'atsuvim (Legend of the Sad Lakes, 1989) explores a lurid imagination obsessed by the Holocaust of an Israeli who goes back to Germany to discover whether his father was a Nazi war criminal. [18] These and other children of Holocaust survivors who were born after World War Two, such as Nava Semel and Savyon Liebrecht, address the transferal of trauma from within the general preoccupation in Israeli postmodernism with childhood, sexuality, the breakdown of identity, and the fluidity of memory. [19] The Holocaust theme as such may not necessarily be expressed in all of their writings (unlike, say, Ka-Tzetnik or Aharon Appelfeld), but it exerts its indirect influence through both the cultural discourse and the personal psyche of the author.\n\nYa'akov Buchan is a novelist of the \"second generation\" who has returned more than once to the fictional memoir of growing up as a child of survivors. In 'Iver tsv 'aim (Colorblind, 1990), a child grows up hearing so many Holocaust stories that he cannot free himself from the compulsive need to suffer and inflict pain. Another novel by Buchan, Yeled shakuf (Transparent Child, 1998), which was awarded the prestigious Bernstein prize, tells the story of Bentsi Gutman who, like Grossman's Momik, grows up in an Israeli city emotionally crippled by the after-effects of the Holocaust and by his inability to ever satisfy his parents. The fact that they are survivor immigrants who speak Yiddish, added to the characteristic lack of parenting skills found among Holocaust victims, increases the hostility around the child. Unlike Momik, who was coddled and smothered by his neurotic parents, this is a neglected child, an unwanted baby, despised by his mother as a coward because he runs at the sight of the neighborhood bu lly. [20] His mother calls him \"musselman\" when he does not eat the food she has prepared, accusing him of ingratitude since in the camps they only got bones. In this way the reality of the camps is played out, and the mother regards the child as another enemy come to plague her, as if Hitler wasn't enough, as she puts it.\n\nFor his part, the boy thinks of his mother as a Hitler to whom he is enslaved and who is using her suffering in the camps to make him feel ungrateful and inadequate. Disappointing her in not matching up to the test of survival skills and powerless when faced with her Holocaust suffering, the child knows he can never be worthy of the concentration camp universe. For example, he collects scraps of food-droppings under the dinner table and offers them to his mother as if demonstrating his understanding of physical starvation, though in fact showing his own emotional starvation. He closes in on himself, unable to respond to the little affection offered him by his father, a weak and absent figure, who gets beaten up in the street and whom his mother has betrayed--another traumatic spot of memory undermining the sanctity of the family in postmodern fiction. For all the notice taken of him or care taken of him, he feels he might as well be transparent:\n\nLacking any shadow, I drift from place to place. Even glass has a shadow. I see and cannot be seen. I hear and cannot be heard. I feel and cannot be felt. And the more I am unseen from without, the more I see inside. The more I am unheard, the more my scream resounds in me. And the more I am unfelt, the more my soul is torn to shreds, drowning in tears. That's how I am and that's how I was brought up by hungry wolves. [21]\n\nUnconsciously the child serves as a conduit for shame and guilt, expressed powerfully in the death by neglect of his chick and the unwilled gaze at the bodies of his parents or his friend's mother (another kind of forbidden knowledge). His behavior pattern suggests denial of death but also a morbid attraction toward and fear of impending disaster. When he leans habitually against the wall, he notices a stain (obviously the contamination of repressed trauma), yet fails at first to realize that his illness does not come from the chill of the wall from which he has been seeking support and nurture, but is a psychosomatic symptom of family ills. [22] Emotional and physical abuse deprives the child of self-esteem and security, but it also inures him to the needs of others, from whom he is constantly distancing himself (by not responding or by running away), a kind of hide-and-seek game which draws attention to his \"transparency\" but which also reinforces it. At the same time, the control of emotion protects him fr om the inevitable pain of separation and rejection, like Shlomo in Grossman's novel who denies love to protect himself from what he thinks is the inevitable separation in another Holocaust. Bentsi too cannot give the love his wife needs, and he finds an outlet for his egoistic needs and libido, as well as his anxiety about his masculinity, in his fantastic adventures with the voluptuous Danielle, who is similarly searching for instant satisfaction in a shallow, drifting life. She is an eroticized projection of male desire which resists the pull of Thanatos and which replaces the lost fetishized object (such as the special stone that the boy finds and then throws away).\n\nTypically, the return to the repressed past is triggered when Bentsi is called back to his ailing parents in Canada, a journey that awakens in him, during an attack of claustrophobia, a fear of death and a paranoiac panic that he is being gassed. [23] The journey is the path for transmission of the hidden legacy of the Holocaust and working through bereavement by accepting death as a fact of mortality. What Bentsi discovers is that he cannot deal with his mother's persecution mania, and when his parents turn to him in their senility he cannot find in himself the strength that helped them in their daily decision-making which got them through the Nazi death camps. He has internalized their mute pain and repeated their behavior pattern. Significantly, the noise of builders, which his mother attributes to attempts to drive them out of their home, drowns out communication and forces down the emotional burden, just as he is doing in his uncommunicative relationship with his wife (in fact, this is probably why he c haracteristically seeks satisfaction in another woman or a nameless prostitute in a nameless foreign town, who fulfill his erotic desires without commitment to responsibility or dialogue). In an inversion of the Israeli national self-image, he is like the Sabra fruit mentioned twice in the novel with the prickly side turned inwards so that pain is both mentally and physically self-inflicted.\n\nNarrated in the consciousness of Bentsi, who is flashbacking to childhood memories, the return of repressed traumas is, as in Grossman's novel, an internal grammar of the artist as a young man, [24] but one who is overwhelmed by the fragility of his life and unable finally to mend his marriage or the world. The author, who was born in a D.P. camp in Austria in 1946, presents us instead with an individual who cannot place himself in the collective, who is born of no country or nation, and who is drifting nowhere. Both Grossman and Buchan write beyond the referential frame of the Zionist discourse and address issues of artistic rather than Jewish and Israeli identity, which is subordinated to the egocentric need for the painful cry to be heard.\n\nCutting Away\n\nThe most striking difference between stories of the first and second generations of Holocaust survivors resides in the need of the second generation to imagine the unspeakable horrors of their parents and grandparents in order to construct an ethnic, collective, and personal identity. Their difficulty is that they must imagine at second hand what they did not experience themselves. The Israeli short-story writer Savyon Liebrecht, for example, has speculated that homes which maintained almost total silence about the Holocaust bred creativity because of the space it gave for fantasy. The code of silence, claims Liebrecht, also gave her the gift to understand the unsaid and the unsayable. And perhaps because she grew up in a generation that did not know its grandparents, her stories harp on family occasions that allow her to invent them and to bridge the generation gap by telling stories: \"I had to tell stories to myself. Mostly because the best way to break a silence is by telling stories.\" [25] The silence is two-way-of the parents who are reluctant to tell and the children who are afraid to ask. Liebrecht was afraid to question her father about the family he had before the war, and he spoke to her only in Polish, a language she does not understand, on a trip to the site of Treblinka, so that she did not hear his story. [26]\n\nOne of Liebrecht's stories, \"Excision\" tells of the breaking of silence when a grandmother relives her camp experience of forty-five years previously. Excision (\"kritah\") is both ritual excision of the past and a cutting away that fails to exorcise the past. Henia cuts her granddaughter's hair to excise the lice the little girl has picked up at kindergarten, but she is also passing onto the third generation her story of the excised past, much to the consternation of her daughter-in-law who shrieks that four-year olds should be hearing about Cinderella and not Auschwitz. The wall of silence between the survivors and their children is broken when the survivors tell their story to their grandchildren. However, \"Hayuta's Engagement Party\" illustrates the opposite extreme of compulsive telling of the story of the camps, when the grandfather embarrasses the family by his inability to be silent; the story's turning point, when the old man collapses in the middle of his granddaughter's engagement party, points to th e need for understanding and love in an insensitive society that has placed a \"sweet frosting\" over the survivor's unstoppable flow of words that can now bring no reconciliation or relief from painful loss.\n\nFailure to communicate and schizophrenia are matched in other stories by Liebrecht, such as \"Horses on the Highway\" and \"'What Am I Speaking, Chinese?' She Said to Him,\" by cracks or contaminating stains in the parental home (like the home of Buchan's Bentsi) which yields its traumatic and secret inheritance after the death of the Holocaust victim. As in many narratives by children of survivors, the Holocaust is not directly mentioned in Liebrecht's \"'What Am I Speaking, Chinese?' She Said to Him.\" The Ghetto Uprising, however, is a silent presence in the name of the street of the parents' home, and in the detail that one of the photos in the estate agent's office was taken in Germany: the home of memory is always \"over there,\" however much home is in the here and now of modern Israel. A wealthy blonde persuades an unwitting estate agent to admit her into her former home, now up for rent, in a desire to return to the past and work through a secret trauma. The stains on the apartment ceiling which she remembe rs from her adolescence are still there, stains of memory which are real reminders of the emotional and communication gap between her parents, in particular of her father's deafness to her mother's complaints and her mother's refusal of marital relations, which she discovered one night. That traumatic primal scene is one she tried to drown out in the bathtub, even muffling the faucet with towels in symbolic mirroring of muteness and silencing of memory; now she reenacts the primal scene with the estate agent who suddenly finds his client wants a different service from the one he had in mind. The woman tries to release the sexual repression she has internalized, and communes with her mother as she copulates with this stranger. Liberated from the trauma, the woman reassures the estate agent, \"You'll find tenants easily. It's a very good apartment. Just be sure to paint the ceiling.\" [27]\n\nIn making the estate agent the object of release of sexual repression, the woman is here releasing another trauma within the trauma. Like sex, the Holocaust is a taboo in the childhood home, a secret knowledge that is silenced and that forms a bond between the survivor parents which excludes the child. So by releasing her mother's sexual repression, the woman (who is not named in the story) is unconsciously touching the forbidden--the unnamed and unnamable--in an act of adultery that expresses Oedipal desire. She then tries to wipe out its contamination, symbolized by the butterfly-shaped stains on the ceiling which are associated in memory with the father's eroticization of the mother and which clearly represent the male genitals, at once a threat and an object of desire.28 The other image of male threat and desire is the spider tattoo on the man's shoulder, which, like the concentration camp inmate's tattoo, is a symbol of victimization and entrapment with the association of the poison of the Holocaust pas t that has incapacitated emotional growth and individuation. The lack of communication between the parents (the \"Chinese\" that the mother might as well have been speaking) is matched by the silence between the generations and by the failure to understand the survivors. The act of release described here is sexual, an act of rebellion in the gender battle, but it is not hard to see that it is itself an act of repression rather than repair--to wipe out the stains is both to listen to the mother and respond to the unrecognized after-effects of trauma, but also to \"wipe out\" rather than work through the trauma.\n\nLiebrecht's stories are generally about a strained family or marital situation, and the struggle by women to control their destinies and avoid a loveless marriage, as in \"Apples from the Desert,\" where the ultra-orthodox mother's perception of the love her daughter has found in a kibbutz changes her views. The discovery of a terrible secret in someone else's life in Liebrecht's stories triggers a catharsis of self-recognition which leads to a decision to be free of psychological or emotional entrapment. Often the dark secret that serves as trigger is the unexpected return of the Holocaust past, as in \"Mother's Photo Album,\" where a mother's institutionalization makes her son decide to become a doctor, but also reveals to him a secret from the Holocaust in the form of his father's former wife. The family album sometimes hides the past which remains latent and inescapable, but sometimes the past is all too insistently present, as in \"Hayuta's Engagement Party,\" where the ensuing tension between speaking and si lencing (when the third generation does not want to hear) dramatizes the undercurrent of an unbearable burden of memory in the family. In \"Purple Meadows,\" [29] the unwilled involvement with a rape-victim and her daughter forces the narrator to touch a wound in a way that changes her life; the hint of a similarity between the rape-victim and a Ghetto survivor at the beginning of the story gives a clue to the state of knowing and not knowing that is found among children of survivors. The familiarity of the uncanny in such encounters with complete strangers is attributed to an unconscious guilt in \"The Strawberry Girl\" [30] when the narrator imagines herself as the wife of an SS officer in a concentration camp who is also forced into an unwilled contact with a Jewish girl, this time a child prisoner who has been growing strawberries at the camp perimeter, fertilized by the ashes of the cremated victims. The enormous strawberries force the German woman into a recognition of the surrounding conspiracy of silence that protects her from the truth about the prisoners, but more importantly forces her into a recognition of the truth about herself and her husband's relations with her and with her son. [31]\n\nIf, as the Israeli psychologist Ilany Kogan insists, knowledge of love is essential for mourning work, [32] the search for intimacy in these stories opens up another dimension of the breaking of silence about repressed trauma. In \"Sonia Muskat\" (a story which Liebrecht dramatized for the stage in 1 997), [33] the Holocaust survivor serves as a medium to recall the story of forbidden love in a cellar where a Jewish family was hiding during the Holocaust. A wealthy heir to the family business fulfills his desire for a servant who is the daughter of his mother's sister, the black sheep of the family who ran way to a distant village and married a Christian. The recall of intimate feelings by an aging man in Israel forms a surrogate dialogue with the second and third generation, while the moral burden of loss is at once universalized and historicized, yet subtly shifted from the fulcrum of Nazi horror to family secrets and hidden desire.\n\nIn a sense, the children have become survivors themselves by internalizing their parents' experiences through their behavior patterns and absorbing their anxieties. They seek role-models among the missing members of family for whom they are \"memorial candles\" and whose name they carry, to whom they are responsible for fulfilling their expectations as well as for bearing a memory that is an impossible and unimaginable burden. To bear a child in the poetry of Rivkah Miriam, for example, is to bear the past, dragging the dead and transferring their memory to the next generation in the way Dina Wardi has described. [34] The confrontation with \"das radikale Bose\" may, however, place the children of survivors in the dual relationship of victim and perpetrator, a double role which they live out in their own fantasies, transferring onto their parents the erotic relationships depicted in novels and films like Sophie's Choice and The Night Porter. Such transference explains the fantasies of Dvori, in a story by Esty G . Hayim, \"Hi ohevet otkha, ken, ken, ken\" (She loves you, yeah, yeah, yeah). [35] This is a fictional memoir of a Tel-Aviv neighborhood populated by Holocaust survivors. Dvori grows up into puberty and into the secrets of her mother's survival in a concentration camp. Like the rotten pickles which are flushed into the toilet bowl, these are shameful and disgusting secrets whose unconscious acknowledgment brings self-punishment. Dvori tries to deny her body's desires by holding in her physical need for defecation, a containment suggestive of an autistic response to trauma. When she cannot hold out any more after her father's forced application of an enema, she runs to the storeroom. There in the storeroom, a kind of private memory chamber like Momik's, she fails to immediately connect her bodily secrets with those of her pregnant cat's. Sexual awareness comes slowly, precipitated by peeping in on the naked body of the neighbor Mrs. Stein in the bath. Unlike Dvori's mother, Mrs. Stein appears to be untainted by the moral contamination of the concentration camps; she did not have to satisfy the desires of a camp commandant to survive. But her grotesque and monstrous body similarly expresses a denial of desire, a symbolic denial of that growing awareness of forbidden knowledge which is invading Dvori's own body. Mrs. Stein is herself deaf to the needs of her blind daughter, Julia, and forces on her the art and music of her pre-Holocaust Austrian home which no longer exists. As in Liebrecht's \"'What Am I Speaking, Chinese?' She Said to Him,\" denial is symbolized by the woman's frigid lack of response to her husband, as well as by her constant baths and obsession with cleaning herself from his seminal contamination, while, in a reenactment of the traumatic past by the second generation, the daughter has run away to France, to the site of the Holocaust scenario which is so terrifyingly haunting the present.\n\nReoccupying Silence\n\nWhat links the first and second generations is the burden of memory that weighs down the children of survivors like the \"Glass Hat\" of the title story of Nava Semel's 1986 short-story collection of that title. [36] Semel, born in 1954, told her mother's story for her, as if she were in the camps and had been saved by a Kapo. The \"glass hat\" is the children's story of their parents' loss that has become their own. Semel shares Liebrecht's desire for closure, to end the story in order to reorder the past into a meaningful narrative, but also in order to gain control over one's life, something that runs through the stories in Liebrecht's aptly titled Tsarikh sof lesipur ahavah (On Love Stories and Other Endings, 1995), not just the stories that deal with the memories of Holocaust survivors or events that force them to relive the past.\n\nWhat can only be described as overidentification characterizes adoption of the personality of the victim in \"The Glass Hat\" and other stories by Nava Semel, who felt she was compelled against her will to write. The Holocaust denial around her pushed her on like a \"forced laborer,\" a sentiment reported by other writers of the second generation. [37] \"Over the years,\" she confessed in conversation with Uri Orlev, the Holocaust survivor and children's author, \"I found myself repeatedly touching the open wound.\" [38] The unknown Holocaust experience is relived in order to give existence to the victims, to make history a real memory by giving the tale a tongue, yet this is clearly a fantasy which is imagined at the same level as the real. The double level of consciousness in which the story of the camps exists simultaneously with \"normality\" blurs all dividing lines between fantasy and the real, as in a poem by Leah Aini, \"Shower\" (1992), where the pain of memory and the sinister image of showers in Auschwitz int rude into the healthy image of contemporary Israel. Born in Tel-Aviv in 1962, Aini cannot evade the thought of the grandmother killed in the gas-chamber when she recalls how her living grandmother combed her hair when she was a little girl:\n\nThe combing of my hair by grandma...\n\nstill today pleasure-combs\n\nsting me into memory\n\nin the small shower-room in the yard\n\na mirror like a belly spilling over\n\nEros and Thanatos are joined together, as if present reality was pregnant with the distorted, monstrous memory concealed in the body, the memory of death that the poet has buried like a bone, \"the bone of the murder/ and the bone of bathing! in the garden of life.\"\n\non a wall swollen from steam [39]\n\nThat the Holocaust figures in recent women's writing does not make it necessarily a gender issue, but its treatment is often informed by a feminist perspective40 and is sometimes lent an erotic sensuality by the voice of the \"deranged\" woman who breaks the taboos of both sex and the trauma of the Holocaust. On the other hand, a cursory glance at recent collections of Israeli women's writing [41] will suffice to suggest that such imagery blends with the general trend of anti-heroes in Israeli fiction, with the tradition of \"magical realism\" and surrealism, mingled with the despair of a war-weary country in which women, as the scarred children of Holocaust survivors and biological carriers of the next generation, express their anxiety about giving birth and about the traumatic legacy to be passed on to the next generation. Leah Aini's short story \"Until the Entire Guard Has Passed\" (1995) [42] is one demonstration of the continuing transferal of Holocaust trauma to succeeding generations, who become new victim s of the Holocaust. The story not only echoes the danger that was posed during the Holocaust by children to parents in fear of the Gestapo, but also expresses mixed feelings that the child may bear the madness of the traumatized mother, which reminds us that the Nazi threat did not end with liberation in the minds of many survivors and that it may be carried on to the next generation as \"inherited fear.\"\n\nGendered discourse on the Holocaust has itself been muted, partly because it was not until the seventies that women told their stories as women's experience of the Holocaust, but also because psychology and sociology alike ignored gender difference. [43] Among other suffering, many women had to cope with sexual exploitation, the loss of femininity resulting from physical deprivation, and the loss of children or the prohibition on childbirth (punishable by death), though to be sure men also suffered separation from their families, sterilization, and abuse. Women in Israel felt the need to regain their voice, to \"reoccupy the territories of silence,\" as Ronit Lentin puts it, [44] because they were doubly silenced, firstly in the taboo area of the Holocaust and secondly as women.\n\nBorn in Haifa in 1944, Ronit Lentin is an Israeli sociologist who has lived in Ireland since 1969 (which raises the question of the boundaries of a national literature, and the boundaries between the Diaspora and the Zionist homeland). Lentin's fieldwork with Palestinian Arab women has given her a special insight into the dual identity and victimhood iniherited by the daughter of survivors; Songs on the Death of Children (1997) is a novel about an Irish journalist in search of Palestinian Arab women, who discovers the story of her mother's survival in the Holocaust on a trip to Israel. The cloak-and-dagger relationship with an Israeli secret agent uncovers her own secret past and the lost sister unknown to her. The secret agent is a phallic figure threatening her as a woman but luring her with the secret he holds and controls, a voyeuristic fantasy of an alter ego represented by the agent's wife Hannah and a murdered Arab woman (another \"sister\"), Nadia. Lentin's autobiographical Night Train to Mother [45] i s one of many such travelogues in which a child of survivors cannot resist the urge to return \"over there\" in an attempt to \"reoccupy the territory of silence.\" [46] The compulsive return to the scene of the primal wounding, which figures in so much Holocaust fiction, has been imagined by Elie Wiesel as a dangerous, almost erotic meeting of the child of survivors with the pre-Holocaust past in his novel The Forgotten. Despite having been brought up as a Sabra whose refugee parents tried to free their child from the stigma of Holocaust victim and to protect her from the trauma of starvation, deprivation, and otherness, like many secular Israelis Lentin discovered she was a stranger in her own land. She went back to Ceaucescu's Romania to relive her family's harrowing experiences and reconnect with her family psychologically and emotionally. In this way she tells their story and thus hers, breaking the silence through writing and closing the circle by going back to origins. She finds a \"destination\" but also concludes, as do so many others, that had she been there she would not have survived, an implicit recognition of an internalization of the victim status and of unworthiness next to those who braved the hardships of the Holocaust (like Nava Semel who speaks of herself as \"sheep to slaughter\"). Only at the completion of the journey can she understand the cause of all that guilt instilled in her in countless ways by the refugees who left their dearest relatives behind and were made to feel unwanted \"foreign brothers\" [47] in the early years of the state when the national ethos fostered physical s trength, heroism, and resistance and denigrated the victim as a \"musselman.\"\n\nThe journey back to Europe, the largest Jewish graveyard there is, is a \"total journey,\" as Lentin calls it, an attempt to rework an unknown past and make space for the vanished places (\"non-lieux\") of the past, to which Lanzmann tried in Shoah to give a \"here-and-nowness.\" [48] It is an irrepressible nostalgia for places that have been swallowed up by history, leaving only a shadow after-image like the pictures of the victims and the litany of a paper memorial in the lists of names or places. [49] The macabre installation of a German railway cattle car at Yad Vashem, perched precariously in midair in a Jerusalem forest, is one instance of the resulting double life of \"over there\" and \"here\" which has made literal the metaphor of the past catching up with the present. The reality of deportations becomes a shadow-life of present-day Jerusalem, as it does in a frequently anthologized story, \"Twilight\" (1980) by Shulamith Hareven, born in Poland in 1931 but brought to the Land of Israel in 1940. Like Joel in Ye huda Amichai's Not of This Time, Not of This Place (1963), the mind of the narrator is both here and there at the same time, except that subjectivity is more real \"over there\" than in Israel, which in much post-1948 writing is eerily unreal, an existential land of anxiety and loss of identity. To reach the dreamscape of \"over there,\" the city of her birth, Hareven's narrator repeats the password, Dante's line, \"Per me si va nella citta dolente.\" There, in the city of eternal sorrow, she witnesses the surrealistic nightly repetition of the roundups of the Jews and participates in their fate by marrying and bearing a son. Only by fulfilling the fantasy of living in a ghetto hideout, by being the conduit to a Dantean hell, can she come back whole, after a symbolically healing operation, to the light of her real life.\n\nNarratives of Return and Redemption\n\n\"The past carries with it a temporal index by which it is referred to redemption,\" wrote Walter Benjamin in his \"Theses on the Philosophy of History.\" \"There is a secret agreement between past generations and the present one.... Like every generation that preceded us, we have been endowed with a weak Messianic power, a power to which the past has a claim. That claim cannot be settled cheaply.\" [50] Saul Friedlander, however, sees in Benjamin's sense of historical redemption an insoluble paradox when applied to the extermination of European Jewry, for, on the one hand, \"the memory of these victims is more present than ever in our historical consciousness; on the other hand, both the representation of the events and their interpretation approach limits that may well be inherent in the very nature of this crime. In these terms, our redeeming powers may well be paralyzed.\" [51] It is because he believes that the Holocaust is unique in resisting a redeeming narrative in the collective consciousness (particularly t he official discourse of \"geulah vetekumah\"), that Friedlander voices reservations about Cathy Caruth's view that historical events are never understood when they occur but are later interpreted. [52] If there is no tenable redemptive narrative, then the Holocaust can become almost an arbitrary determining genetic defect, which convinces the survivors and their children they are \"not made\" for happiness or love (as in Buchan's Transparent Child). The emptiness of the cynical fatalism parodied in Orly Castel-Blum's Dolly City, [53] a savage satire of Tel-Avivian culture paralyzed by its traumatic memories and fears, which kills what it loves out of excessive anxiety and justifies its existence by goy-bashing, contrasts with a novel by Michal Govrin, Hashem (The Name), [54] which describes a young woman's religious repentance as a struggle between escaping and coming to terms with the Holocaust past. Govrin (born in 1950), a drama specialist who has drawn on Jewish sources in her theatre productions, writes aga inst the background of the movement of tshuvah (repentance) in the eighties, when many disaffected youth and dropouts returned to Judaism and Jewish roots. Israel's rebirth following the Holocaust was a sign for them of the coming redemption as promised by the biblical prophets and as interpreted by Rabbi Kook. Govrin's prize-winning novel is a dialog with Jewish responses to the Holocaust such as Esh haqodesh and Em habonim smekhah.\n\nThe central figure at the center of that dialog, Amalia, is a \"memorial candle\" named for her father's first wife, who committed suicide during the Holocaust, and she has been trying to rid herself of that name which haunts her. As a child, she suffered emotional abuse because she didn't fulfill her father's expectations that she would live up to Amalia Auerbach's musical fame. The ominous Ludwig Stein manipulates her talent as a photographer to go back to Europe and resurrect her father's lost love in the photos which she runs away with, not knowing why or whether she has any right. The \"black hole\" of the Holocaust, which had so frightened her as a child and which she imagined as a terrifying echo chamber that threatened to destroy her and her parents, now becomes part of her schizoid personality. Her attempted tshuvah (literally \"return\") in a well-known Israeli religious institution is a struggle to overcome the past, to wipe it out, for the penitent, according to the ruling of Maimonides in Hilkhot tshu vah, must forget the sinful past and become someone else (akher) with a different name. In this agonized and lengthy rebirth of tshuvah, the true penitent is one who can face the sinful past and say \"I am someone else (akher).\" Yet the Jew is commanded to narrate the Exodus to the succeeding generations and never to forget what Amaleq did to destroy the Jewish people. Amalia, unfortunately, does not perceive this distinction between personal identity and collective memory, which her mentor Rabbi Gotthelf underscores in a presentation of standard Jewish responses to catastrophe. As a result, she sets out on a misguided and sacrilegious course of self-destruction.\n\nAmalia's writing is an act of tikkun to repair her soul and relieve her guilt (ashema) as family scapegoat, a role often bestowed on the \"memorial candle.\" Her search for hashem--her name as well as God's--is symbolized by her weaving of the sacred textile of the curtain of the Holy Ark and the text of her story, a confessional diary in which she counts the days of the 'Omer from the Exodus out of Egypt on Passover to the revelation at Sinai on Pentecost, days of a mystical symbolic process in Cabala and Jewish history from bondage to revelation, from destruction to redemption. In a familiar Talmudic legend, four sages entered Paradise using the secret Name; however, Amalia (whose name combines a mixed etymology of labor and evil with the divine Name) follows not\n\nRabbi Akiva, who came out safely, but Elisha ben Abuya who became a heretic and is therefore called the Other (Akher). Amalia falls under the influence of his descendent, Abuya ben Elisha, a mystic who tells her she has a holy mission to redeem the souls of the Holocaust dead because it is precisely in the destruction of the Holocaust that the last gate of the deepest tumah (ritual contamination) can open to redemption and tikkun 'olam (mending of the world). Rather perversely, Amalia reinterprets this as an erotic union which will somehow redeem the dybbuk of the dead Amalia that has possessed her body and soul.\n\nWriting is a means of tikkun, like Amalia's cabalistic labor of love over the holy textile, but the ending of the novel is open, leaving it unclear whether Amalia will commit suicide, as an atoning scapegoat, or will accept that tshuvah and tikkun can never be completed, that coming to terms with the past is the true self-sacrifice. The question being asked by this confused voice of a disturbed young woman strikes at the very meaning of literature after the Holocaust: can it have redemptive value? In her response to the writer who equated the Holocaust and a corncob, Cynthia Ozick took up the metaphor of tshuvah to show something \"deeply perilous\" in the imagination. That is the source of the creative force in the yetser har 'a (evil inclination) itself, which is the power not simply to penetrate evil but to turn back on meaning, to create an idol to which everything human is sacrificed in the name of art. [55] That is why, in Ozick's the Messiah of Stockholm, Lars is almost destroyed by the idol that obsess es him when he adopts as his progenitor Bruno Schulz, and why, in The Name, Amalia mistakes the yetser har'a for redemption through love rather than a channel to release the holy sparks of authentic tshuvah meahavah (repentance out of love).\n\nFor David Grossman, by contrast, in his appropriation of Bruno Schulz and the story of the lost manuscript of The Messiah in See Under: Love, the redemptive project is suspect because it offers a utopia in which there will be no place for the humanity so necessary for art after Auschwitz. [56] Bruno serves as a vehicle for one who was not yet born to imagine himself \"over there\" (erets sham). He is named for the Polish author of Street of the Crocodiles and Sanatorium Under the Sign of the Hourglass, yet he escapes from Bruno Schulz's fate in the Drohobycz ghetto and slips into the sea, where the credibility of the story is submerged under the surrealism of an underwater Schulzian fantasy. Bruno offers a secular messianism, the old delusion that literature can bring redemption. Shlomo realizes that \"the Messiah would never come in writing, would never be invoked in a language suffering from elephantiasis. A new grammar and a new calligraphy had first to be invented.\" [57] This is, of course, a post-Holocaust awareness of the inadequacies of language to describe the unimaginable horror of the Holocaust and the incapacitating fear of touching the wound, an anxiety contextualized by Shlomo's trip to Poland and Adorno's famous negation of poetry after Auschwitz, to which Ayala and Ruth respond that poetry is about human beings and, since human beings were in Auschwitz, poetry is the most effective means to preserve belief in humanity. [58]\n\nThe Future of the Past\n\nFor Grossman's Momik, the Holocaust is a continuing fact of his life, as it is for Art Spiegelman, in his comic-strip story of his father's survival, Maus. The \"memorial candles\" are born into their parents' story because their birth is for the survivor a small victory against Hitler's plan to exterminate all Jews, almost a compensation for loss and suffering and a justification of survival. The simulation of the victim's role model is an attempt both to be free of the burden of their parents' memory and to claim the story as their own. Yet the territory of the traumatic past has already mapped out the story of the second generation. Momik grows up in the shadow of \"over there\" and it is inevitable he should go back there not just to rescue his family's memory but also to recover the very possibility of story-telling, which he does through the figures of Bruno and Wasserman. In Maus, too, the map of the Holocaust looms over the son's struggle for identity and sanity, as well as over his difficult relationship with his father, which frames the father's story. By the end of the story Art has become his dead brother, as his father calls him by his lost son's name, just as Elie Wiesel's Ariel, in The Fifth Son, eventually merges with his lost brother. [59]\n\nIn working through inherited trauma there comes a stage of separation from the dead, from the corpses, when the \"memorial candle\" discovers its own identity, when the damaged ego becomes whole, enabling open discussion of the hidden content of the traumatic past without fear of damage and of again wounding loved ones. The process of working through can proceed, allowing the children of victims to vent their anger and frustration and to express their identity and individuality. Only then can the second generation drop the role of \"memorial candles\" and recognize that they are a living link in a generational and collective chain, rather then feeling they are dragging the dead. [60] This stage allows for interpretation, and Ilany Kogan understands the role of the therapist as bringing into existence the separate cohesive self through interpretive acts which bring into play the roles of Eros and Thanatos in the stories of the second generation in order to turn fragmentary reenactments of the past into meaningful , life-affirmative experiences. In this way, the \"Beast\" becomes something that is not just a black hole of unimaginable trauma but something that can be dealt with. [61]\n\nThe writing of the \"second generation\" both in Israel and America reflects this process of separation, which has become all the more urgent with the aging and passing of the last survivors. The \"second generation\" are not mere transmitters of survivor testimony but must imaginatively reconstruct the story when the witnesses do not or cannot speak or, when they do, speak to an indirect audience, such as the third generation or reading public. The writings of the \"second generation\" reclaim a voice in that story, as well as a place in history, though not without guilt and anger, not least because of the parents' silence and their own shame or misunderstanding towards their parents. [62] Children of survivors are afraid that by reawakening the traumatic past or exposing ghosts in the family cupboard they will hurt parents who may fear for control of the memory and who may fear they are losing \"their\" story. Like any act of writing, however, it entails a reformation of self that challenges personal and collectiv e identity: who I am depends on what is remembered and by whom, on the moral relativity of the subject position, and on the information available.\n\nUnlike any other act of writing, however, the Holocaust has imposed a double-bind in its sacred commandment to remember the six million and the impossibility of doing so in any historicized way. The reason is not just because we are too close in time, or because of the hotly debated \"unrepresentability\" of the Holocaust. [63] Nor because of the forbidden boundary of figurality and imagination, which has already been surpassed by survivors like Paul Celan and Dan Pagis, as well as those who were not there, like Cynthia Ozick and David Grossman. The reason is that memory of the survivors is not the memory of their children since neither come unprocessed by the cultural norms of the time of narration and by intervening events. The story of the second generation, moreover, usually includes the story of transmission as they pass on the narrative to their children. That story foregrounds the impossibility of telling, which, in common with many postmodernist texts, self-consciously draws attention to the fragmentat ion of the self, of knowledge, and of memory. [64]\n\nThe psychological wound inherited from Holocaust survivors or prewar refugees who lost all their family can be a festering one that is not easily discernible from other pains of adolescent rage or complexes of identity. It is surprisingly similar among members of the second generation in Israel and the Diaspora, despite all the differences between the Diaspora and Israel situations and despite the assumptions that the Israeli has found a home and identity not available to the Diaspora Jew or that the Israeli is somehow too tough for neuroses. For both the Diaspora Jew and the Israeli the same issues are raised: whose memory, who are the legitimate heirs, and what \"usable past\" can be recovered from the inherited trauma? For both the Diaspora Jew and the Israeli, muteness is turned into voice through the act of writing, albeit at the expense of self-exposure, an exposure of the inward-turned pain that is the share of Buchan's Bentsi Gutman. The ready recognition by their contemporaries of the personal stories of the second generation since the 1980s suggests a number of factors that point to the nature of the confrontation of the personal and the collective in public discourse. Firstly, Israeli culture has obviously become more materialistic, dominated by spending and getting, the sensation of the moment and sexual gratification (both Grossman's Momik and Buchan's Bentsi turn to women to unload their heavy emotional burdens and are trapped passively, almost childishly, between a mother-figure and a seductive mistress). Secondly, in a Western culture characterized by atomization, simulacra, and surrogate values, it's easy to be cynical about redemptive narratives and difficult to place oneself in a meaningful historical continuum. The Holocaust becomes an archetypal misfortune that destroys personal happiness and reinforces fears of imminent catastrophe. Finally, the dissolution of belief in ideological institutions and religious faith, which tended to give history meaning, in favor of the pursuit of private happi ness and the militant defense in its name of individual liberty makes the suffering that is passed down (what George Steiner once called \"a dread remembrance\") almost all that remains to define the Jew once Judaism and Zionism have been discarded.\n\nWe can see, in conclusion, that a traumatic past is being worked through rather than denied, as in previous paradigms of official discourse on the Holocaust in Israel. To perceive the past as disruptive trauma, rather than redemptive history, would have been unthinkable less than a few decades ago. Then official discourse on the Holocaust would not have tolerated the expression of private pain and would have marginalized personal trauma as irrelevant or harmful to the collective. In the opinion of a recent commentator, the \"silence\" of Israeli literature on the Holocaust resulted in \"narrative displacement,\" an attempt to expunge traces of the traumatic event that called the narrative into being. [65] Now official discourse recognizes what Aharon Appelfeld complained was so lacking in Israeli culture and education, knowledge of the heritage of the Diaspora; [66] he declared that to write was to write \"home,\" in a return to the past.\n\nThe return is also a return to the self that deconstructs previous identities and narratives, especially those forced on the survivors and their families, and this often causes a cathartic soul-searching about the nation's moral responsibility for its treatment of the victims during the first years of statehood. The mass trauma of the destruction of European Jewry, moreover, brings into tension the relations between individual and collective identity which are no longer clear-cut when the historical narrative is not coherent and the boundaries (political as well as psychological) of nation and individual are breaking down. The Zionist version of history is no longer sacrosanct and a Jewish Diaspora identity has been re-legitimized--in Ilan Sheinfeld's Shedletse (1999), for example, an Israeli reinvents the past through the eyes of an eternal Jew metamorphized into a frog blessed (or cursed) by long memory who mimics the hassidic story-teller. In the attempt to remember destruction, the stereotypes of Jewish history and Israeli society break down, reclaiming exile as homeland, the past as future, but also exposing memory as an impractical luftgesheft in which the survivors traded but which the next generation spurned. On the other hand, Amir Guttfreund, son of child-survivors, in his fictional autobiography, Shoah shelanu (Our Holocaust, 2000), explores the conflicting memories and identities of the \"Holocaust after the Holocaust,\" [67] the spiritual and psychological aftereffects experienced by Guttfreund's \"11/2 generation\" after Auschwitz, growing up in a survivor community and in a besieged country that is reliving traumatic destruction and does not seem able to break out of its Holocaust complex. Whatever the eventual outcome of these conflicts, it is clear that second-generation fiction, like much contemporary writing, is breaking from all master-narratives to focus on personal memory in a nation where both collective and individual identity is at the center of heated debate. The quest, however, itself form s a narrative of self-definition and is the beginning of coming to terms with the past in ways that are meaningful for the future.\n\nEfraim Sicher teaches British and comparative literature at Ben-Gurion University of the Negev.

The question in the title was a common accusation hurled at survivors who were held guilty for not having the foresight to save themselves by coming to the Land of Israel. The misunderstanding of the traumatized, bereaved victims is compounded by the shame Elisabeth feels at Helena, who significantly is not called mother or by a family name. Doron's fictional memoir attempts to reclaim her name and thereby the key to the locked past of the haunted castle that is the Holocaust, an incredible fairy-tale kingdom that can only be approached in a childish sing-song prose.\n\n(3.)

Much has been written on the policy of the Yishuv toward European Jewry under Nazi occupation, but Tuvia Friedling has demonstrated on archival evidence that considerably more was done than has previously been thought (Khets be'arafel: Ben-Gurion, hanhagat hayishuv venisionot hatsalah bashoah [Sde Boqer: Ben-Gurion Research Institute, 1998]).\n\n(11.)

Leon Yudkin has argued that the fact that Grossman is not a child of survivors himself has no significance because the impact of the transferred trauma is no less powerful for being absorbed from the collective psyche and national culture (\"Holocaust Trauma in the Second Generation: The Hebrew Fiction of David Grossman and Savyon Liebrecht,\" in Sicher, ed., Breaking Crystal, pp. 170-6).\n\n(13.) Ayen 'erekh: ahavah (Tel-Aviv: Haqibuts hameukhad, 1996); English: See Under: Love, trans. Betsy Rosenberg (New York: Farrar, Straus and Giroux, 1989). Unlike the other works discussed in this essay, much has been written about this novel, which created a furor in the Israeli press when it appeared. The leading literary critic Gershon Shaked concluded that Grossman seems optimistic that writing can survive the post-Auschwitz situation and that the writer can recover the past through art (\"Yaldei haley vehamifletset,\" Yedi'ot akharonot, vol.7 (March 1986), pp. 20, 25; English version: \"The Children of the Heart and the Monster: David Grossman--See Under: Love,\" Modern Judaism, vol. 9, no.3 [1989], pp. 311-23). Another Israeli scholar, Gabriel Tsoran, was quick to perceive the revolution that Grossman's novel had worked in representation of the Holocaust in Hebrew literature (Gabriel Tsoran, \"Mebet mazmil leerets sham,\" Siman griah, vol. 20 [1990], pp. 245-50), and he concluded that Grossman had put all his money on the stakes but had won. Tsoran believes that the moral questions raised in the novel can be compared with those in Smile of the Lamb, but the novel does not become a mere allegory and tries to find meaning in life after the Holocaust--another \"missing\" entry in Kazik's Encyclopedia. Yael Feldman, on the other hand, sees the ending of the novel as anything but optimistic (\"Whose Story Is It Anyway? Ideology and Psychology in the Representation of the Shoah in Israeli Literature,\" in Probing the Limits of Representation: Nazism and the \"Final Solution,\" ed.

In an overview of the Holocaust theme in Israeli fiction of the 1980s, Avner Holtzman places these works in the context of renewed contacts with Poland, the use of fiction in \"documentary\" novels about the Holocaust, and post-modernist attempts to grapple with the difficulties of a literary perspective so soon after the Holocaust (\"Trends in Israeli Holocaust Fiction in the 1980s,\" Modern Hebrew Literature, vol. 8-9 [New Series] [1992], pp. 23-8).\n\n(19.)

This is connected with his general feeling that the world is not safe, shared with Helen Epstein and described in her Children of the Holocaust: Conversations with Sons and Daughters of Survivors (New York: Penguin Books, 1988), p. 9.\n\n(24.) This theme appears in another novel by Grossman, The Book of Internal Grammar. It is a theme taken up in Yitskhak Rubin's film, White Lies (1999), about an Israeli child of survivors who is unable to work through his Holocaust complex by writing a play and cannot cope with the pain of his mother's terminal cancer; like Bentsi, he seeks release for his powerless rage in a foreign prostitue.\n\n(25.)

The difficulty of this story is the lack of any distance in time or emotional detachment that would allow a convincing perspective on the psyche of the wife of a perpetrator; the horror of the camps is more powerfully conveyed in another story related in flashback, \"Morning in the Park Among the Nannies\" (in Apples from the Desert), when the narrator recognizes a woman who was the 85 officers' whore.\n\n(32.)

Esty Hayim's main theme is not so much the Holocaust but forbidden love and a family secret, the theme also of her first novel, Khayav hashniim (Tel-Aviv: Haqibuts hameukhad, 1999). However, it is a theme that expresses the second-generation situation of discovering a repressed past.\n\n(36.) Nava Semel, Kov'a zkhukhit (Tel-Aviv: Sifriyat hapo'alim, 1986).

This maybe expressed by sensitivity to stereotyping of Palestinian Arabs or the plight of Arab women (for example, in Liebrecht's story \"A Room on the Roof' or her \"The Road to Cedar City\" in Apples in the Desert). Liebrecht says of her participation in Jewish-Arab dialogue that she was moved by her own sensitivities as a daughter of survivors rather than politics, and that she opposed interpretations of her stories by Palestinian women in which they appropriated Holocaust suffering to their own (interview with Tamar Fox, \"Stories From the Second Generation,\" Jewish Quarterly [Summer 1998]: 26-8).\n\n(41.)

Ruth Linden has shown how the telling of the Holocaust story from a woman's perspective worked to form her own identity as a returning Jew (though not quite a ba 'alat tshuvah) in Making Stories, Making Selves: Feminist Reflections on the Holocaust (Columbus: Ohio State University Press, 1993). Savyon Liebrecht, however, denies that women's writing is gendered (Rattok, \"Introduction,\" p. 12), though her own biological role as child-bearer and her concern with the revolt of daughters against mothers, particularly women's assertion of their sexuality and identity, relate the story of the transmission of memory and the long-term effects of trauma to a female perspective on the Other, Jewish-Arab relations and battered wives (Rattok, \"Introduction,\" pp. 19--30).\n\n(44.)

For a different view which interprets Holocaust trauma as a latent Nachtdglichkeit that reinvents the past in the writing of history see Michael S. Roth, The Ironist's Cage: Memory, Trauma, and the Construction of History (New York: Columbia University Press, 1995). Sidra Dekoven Ezrahi, in a critique of the views of Alan Mintz (in Hurban) and David G. Roskies (in his Against the Apocalypse), has argued that modem Jewish literature has resisted redemptive narratives of apocalypse. Her examples from Israeli writing show the concern with the burden of history and the attempts to reinterpret the redemptive future posited by Zionism (\"Considering the Apocalypse: Is the Writing on the Wall only Graffiti?\" in Writing and the Holocaust, ed. Berel Lang [New York: Holmes and Meier, 1988], pp. 137-1 53).

Doli siti (Tel-Aviv: Zemorah-Bitan, 1992); English: Dolly City, trans. Dalya Bilu (London: Loki Books, 1997). In this novel, a hysterical woman is trapped between extreme anxiety for her adopted son's health and ambivalence toward any emotional connection, a postmodern satire of the relations between nation and body. She performs unnecessary operations on the boy, carving a map of Israel on his back and transplanting kidneys from German babies in Dusseldorf--a travesty of the sacredness of land, but also a dismembering of self followed by a re-member-ing of the past by transplanting it to the present body of Israel. Dolly City mocks the saturation of Holocaust memorialization which shames Dolly for not being a daughter of survivors and turns Dachau into a meaningless sign-board. Ambivalence towards memory by a materialist society that has branded the legacy of the Holocaust on its children is also shown in Etgar Karrett's short story \"Na'alaim\" in his Ga'aguai lekissinger (Tel-Aviv: Zemora Bitan, 1997) , pp. 87-9.\n\n(54.)

Lizzie Doron's Why Didn't you Come Before the War? is a good example of an attempt through writing at reparation for these feelings, a kind of yizkor to recall the insults and humiliations that injured the victims' pride and dignity. Doron had previously resisted identification with the second generation, but was forced into writing her account when she realized she knew few basic facts about her mother to complete her biography and to pass on to her children when they came home with a family roots project; the effect was unexpected in the discovery of relatives and the overwhelming response of survivors (public address at a symposium on \"Daughters of Survivors: Looking Back,\" Ben-Gurion University of the Negev, April 1999 and interview with Ora Cummings, \"Scenes from Lizzie Doron's Childhood,\" Jewish Quarterly [Summer 1999], pp. 55-6).\n\n(63.)

In his art, the Israeli second-generation artist Haim Maor insists that only in representing the impossibility of representation can the tale be told: the success of the artist is in this failure. In a different way, Art Spiegelman foregrounds the medium and mode of representation to show its problematic status.
