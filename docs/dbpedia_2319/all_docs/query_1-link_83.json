        "text": "- Hebrew literature consists of ancient, medieval, and modern writings in the Hebrew language and is one of the primary forms of Jewish literature. - Important ancient works include the Hebrew Bible and the Mishna. Medieval works include commentaries, law codes, and mystical works. - Modern Hebrew literature began in the 18th century and flourished in the 19th century with Haskalah works promoting Jewish enlightenment. - With the rise of Zionism and the establishment of Israel, Hebrew became the national language and Israeli literature developed as a major genre."
