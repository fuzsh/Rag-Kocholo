        "text": "Citation preview\n\nTHE\n\nCAMBRIDGE DICTIONARY OF\n\nJUDAISM AND\n\nJEWISH CULTURE The Cambridge Dictionary of Judaism and Jewish Culture is an authoritative and accessible reference work for a twenty-first-century audience. Its entries, written by eminent scholars, define the spiritual and intellectual concepts and the religious movements that distinguish Judaism and the Jewish experience. They cover central personalities and places, formative events, and enduring literary and cultural contributions, and they illuminate the lives of ordinary Jewish women and men. Essays explore Jewish history from ancient times to the present and consider all aspects of Judaism, including religious practices and rituals, legal teachings, legendary traditions, rationalism, mysticism, and messianism. This reference work differs from many others in its broad exploration of the Jewish experience beyond Judaism. Entries discuss secular and political movements and achievements and delineate Jewish endeavors in literature, art, music, theater, dance, film, broadcasting, sports, science, medicine, and ecology, among many other topics from the ancient Near East to the Internet. Judith R. Baskin is Philip H. Knight Professor of Humanities and Associate Dean for Humanities in the College of Arts and Sciences at the University of Oregon. Her books include Pharaoh’s Counsellors: Job, Jethro, and Balaam in Rabbinic and Patristic Tradition (1982) and Midrashic Women: Formations of the Feminine in Rabbinic Literature (2002). She is the editor of Jewish Women in Historical Perspective (1991; 2nd edition, 1998) and Women of the Word: Jewish Women and Jewish Writing (1994) and is coeditor of The Cambridge Guide to Jewish History, Religion, and Culture (with Kenneth Seeskin, 2010), which received the 2010 National Jewish Book Award for anthologies and collections.\n\nTHE CAMBRIDGE DICTIONARY OF JUDAISM AND JEWISH CULTURE EDITOR: Judith R.

Its entries, written by eminent scholars, define the spiritual and intellectual concepts and the various religious movements that distinguish Judaism and the Jewish experience. Their subjects include central personalities, formative events, and enduring literary and cultural contributions. Essays outline Jewish history from ancient times to the present, and they also illuminate the daily lives of Jewish women and men in many eras and locations. Contributions discuss legal teachings and legendary traditions, and they explain the roles of rationalism, mysticism, and messianism within Jewish thought. The religious rituals and customs of Judaism – and the texts and contexts that explain, expand, and animate them – are a major focus as well. Many entries focus on geographic regions, countries, and cities, documenting the distinctive characteristics of Jewish life and cultural production in these specific places. Yet what makes this reference different from many others is that it also explores Jewish acitivities and contributions outside the religious boundaries of Judaism. Articles in this dictionary explore Jewish secular and political movements, Jewish achievements beyond the confines of the traditional Jewish world, and the often disregarded lives of Jewish women. Discussions of numerous events of the modern era, including the Holocaust, Zionism, and the founding of the State of Israel, and Jewish involvement in numerous aspects of mainstream culture, demonstrate the inadequacy of defining Jews only from a religious viewpoint. Entries in this book consider manifestations of religious disaffection and secularism, as well as the impact of intellectual, social, and political tendencies in the larger societies of which Jews have been a part. Authoritative essays delineate Jewish expressions and achievements in a variety of languages and literatures and in the visual and lively arts. Readers of this compendium will find new and compelling approaches both to Judaism and to the intellectual and cultural development of the Jewish people. The Cambridge Dictionary of Judaism and Jewish Culture reviews Jewish participation in a wide variety of areas, including journalism, literature, art, music, theater, dance, film, sports, travel, and other forms of popular culture from periodicals, radio, and television to the graphic novel and the Internet. Topics of interest include the involvement of Jews in medicine, politics, science and mathematics, ecology and the environmental movement, and the academic world of higher education. Authors of articles in this volume employ the insights of art history, cinema studies, musicology, social sciences, cultural studies, women’s studies, and gender studies, in addition to more traditional approaches centered on historical, philosophical, literary, religious, and textual scholarship and analysis. A one-volume dictionary of Judaism and the Jewish experience could never claim to be fully comprehensive, and this work is no exception. However, the sixteen subeditors have endeavored to provide coverage of topics ranging from the ancient Near East to Jewish demography in the twenty-first century. Most important, The Cambridge Dictionary of Judaism and Jewish Culture is designed for ease of use. Its articles are succinct, clearly written, and accessible to general readers. xxvii\n\nPREFACE\n\nIn many cases, authors have suggested further reading from reliable and readily available primary and secondary sources in English for those who would like to explore a topic in more depth. This volume would not have been possible without the contributions of the subeditors, who chose the subjects to be covered in their areas of expertise and who recommended colleagues as potential authors. I am grateful for their efforts in helping make this dictionary a reality. Most essential to this project’s success, of course, are the hundreds of contributors whose entries reflect both cutting-edge scholarship and perceptive analysis. I am in their debt, as are all who make use of this book. Special thanks are due to my assistants over the years: Peter Calley, Noah Mullin, Moshe Rachmuth, Brianna Bridegum, Kate Friedman, Elizabeth Shulman, and Sara Waltemire. Without their much appreciated help, this volume would never have been completed. I am most grateful for a very generous gift from the Harold and Arlene Schnitzer Care Foundation of Portland, Oregon, which made possible the inclusion of color plates. These images significantly enhance a number of the articles on art and ceremonial objects. Harold Schnitzer died on April 27, 2011, just a few months before the publication of this volume. His vision in establishing the Harold Schnitzer Family Program in Judaic Studies at the University of Oregon was typical of his many extraordinary acts of philanthropy. Certainly it transformed my life and I will always be grateful to Harold and his family for bringing me to Oregon in 2000 to head this exciting academic program and for their ongoing support of my academic endeavors. I know that Harold’s memory will be a blessing for many generations to come. A research leave in 2007 and a sabbatical in 2009 allowed me to do essential work on this project. I am grateful to the University of Oregon and particularly the College of Arts and Sciences for providing me with these gifts of time. As always, I am deeply appreciative of the sustaining love and patience of my husband and children, Warren, Sam, and Shira Ginsberg; they help make the impossible possible.\n\nxxviii\n\nHOW TO USE THIS BOOK\n\nEntries in this volume are arranged alphabetically. Within each entry, asterisks (∗ ) identify people, places, literary works, and concepts and movements for which separate articles exist. Often, in the course of an essay or at its conclusion, references to other relevant entries are indicated in UPPERCASE letters. Articles often refer to interesting and important individuals for whom there are no designated entries. A comprehensive Index of Names at the end of the volume directs readers to all the entries in which a particular person is mentioned. The Contributors listing at the beginning of the book identifies each author and the entry or entries she or he has written. Some articles have been grouped by topic for the reader’s convenience. For example, substantive entries about Jewish writers and writings in various times and places appear alphabetically under Literature. Similar groupings are found under Art, Bible, Film, Holocaust, Israel, State of, Journalism, Middle Ages, Music, Poetry, Sports, Theater, United States, and Women, among others. Articles related to one or more of these topics also stand alone, but cross-references direct readers to them. The entries in this volume are relatively brief; none is longer than 3,000 words and most are far shorter. They are also highly focused, exploring specific subjects in some detail. In many ways, this book complements The Cambridge Guide to Jewish History, Religion, and Culture (ed. Judith R. Baskin and Kenneth Seeskin, 2010), whose far longer historical and thematic essays provide comprehensive overviews of particular eras and subjects. The entries in The Dictionary address in detail topics that essays in The Guide could only mention in passing. Together the two volumes provide in general and specific ways a sense of the immense richness and diversity of Judaism and the bountiful expressions of Jewish culture and creativity through the ages.\n\nxxix\n\nA NOTE ON TRANSLITERATION\n\nGenerally, the Hebrew letter h.et is represented in this volume by h., the Hebrew letter khaf by kh, and tzadei by tz. However, an effort has been made to balance the demands of consistency with those of familiarity. Thus, biblical names and places are spelled here as they are in The Jewish Bible: Tanakh: The Holy Scriptures. The New Jewish Publication Society Translation according to the Hebrew Text (1985). Similarly, the names of individuals from the eighteenth century on are spelled as they most commonly appear in English. The name H.ayyim, for instance, may be spelled Chaim, Chayim, Haim, or Haym depending on the individual involved. Names of individuals have been standardized as much as possible across entries, although this occasionally leads to inconsistencies in transliteration within entries. Names of places in the State of Israel generally follow conventional English spellings. Transliterations of other languages, such as Arabic, Ladino, Russian, and Yiddish, usually respect the choices of the authors of specific entries.\n\nxxxi\n\nABBREVIATIONS\n\nAbbreviations appear throughout the volume in the following categories: CHRONOLOGY\n\nb.

Aaron is also the father of the levitical ∗ priesthood (Exod 28:1); Leviticus 8–10 describes the ordination of Aaron and his sons as the priests (kohanim) of the ∗ Tabernacle. Nadab and Abihu, two of Aaron’s sons, die in the course of this event (Lev 10:1–3), apparently because they disobey God by incorporating foreign elements into the cultic service. Numbers 18 affirms the primacy of the priestly roles of Aaron and his direct descendants: They alone are responsible for maintaining the purity of the sanctuary (18:1), while the other members of the tribe of Levi are to provide support services and “do the work of the Tent of Meeting” (Num 18:2–7). Aaron sometimes challenges his brother’s leadership. When Moses ascends Mount Sinai, Aaron stays behind and is persuaded to build the golden calf; he is spared, however, from the plague that strikes the idolaters (Exod 32). Numbers 12 relates that both Aaron and Miriam speak against Moses and challenge the unique nature of Moses’ prophetic relationship with God. Both are verbally chastised by God, but only Miriam is punished with a skin affliction and a week’s expulsion from the camp. Aaron, like Moses, is barred from entrance to ∗ Canaan for his failure to sanctify God as commanded at the waters of Meribah (Num 20:1–13). Numbers 20:22– 29 describes Aaron’s death at Mt. Hor and the thirty days of communal mourning that follow.

E LIZABETH S HULMAN\n\nhealth, debate focused on permissible conditions and situations. Rabbi Jacob Emden (1697–1776), among others, permitted abortion “as long as the fetus has not emerged from the womb, even if not to save the mother’s life, but only to save her from the harassment and great pain which the fetus causes her,” ruling that abortion was permitted when a pregnancy resulted from ∗ adultery or another prohibited sexual union (She’elat Yavez 1:43). There is no monolithic attitude toward abortion in modern Judaism, and contemporary Jews hold diverse opinions. However, various movements have formulated denominational positions. All streams of Orthodox Judaism endorse the rabbinic position (based on Exod 21:22–25) that abortion is permitted when there is a high probability that the mother’s life is at risk, whether for physical or psychological reasons (see JUDAISM, ORTHODOX: MODERN ORTHODOX; JUDAISM: ORTHODOX: ULTRA-ORTHODOX). However, most Orthodox legal authorities prohibit abortion when the fetus has a significant abnormality or a fatal genetic condition. One recent exception is Rabbi Eliezer Waldenberg (1915–2006), who allowed the first-trimester abortion of a fetus with a deformity that would cause it to suffer and permitted abortion up to the end of the second trimester of pregnancy of a fetus with a lethal defect such as Tay-Sachs disease (Tzitz Eliezer 9:51:3). The position of Conservative Judaism, expressed in 1983, is that “an abortion is justifiable if a continuation of pregnancy might cause the mother severe physical or psychological harm, or when the fetus is judged by competent medical authorities to be severely defective.” Conservative authorities, as well as some Orthodox rabbinic decision makers, would permit abortion when pregnancy resulted from rape or from illicit sexual relations such as adultery or incest (See JUDAISM, CONSERVATIVE). Reform Judaism allows the option of abortion in all of the instances mentioned above, as well as for additional reasons in individual cases. In a 1967 statement approved at the 49th General Assembly, a lay policymaking body, the movement declared abortion permissible “under such circumstances as threatened disease or deformity of the embryo or fetus, threats to the physical and mental health of the mother, rape and incest and the social, economic and psychological factors that might warrant therapeutic termination of pregnancy.” In a 1975 statement, passed at the 53rd General Assembly, Reform Judaism expressed confidence in the right and ability of a woman to exercise her ethical and religious judgment in making her own decision (See JUDAISM, REFORM: NORTH AMERICA). In Israel, the 1977 penal code permits legal abortions by appropriately trained physicians in medical facilities that are “specifically and publicly recognized” as providers of abortions. A termination committee must approve abortion requests. Acceptable grounds include the following: a pregnant woman younger than seventeen, the legal age for marriage; physical, emotional, or psychological damage to\n\nAbarbanel: See ABRAVANEL Abel: See ADAM;\n\nCAIN AND ABEL; EVE.\n\nAbortion. Judaism respects the sanctity of life and of potential life and has generally prohibited abortion. When a pregnant woman’s life was endangered, however, rabbinic and medieval authorities permitted abortion on the basis of Exodus 21:22–25. This text was understood to make a distinction between the actual human status of the pregnant woman and the potential human status of her fetus, which was not considered an independent entity before its birth (BT Yevamot 69b; BT H . ullin 58a). Because the fetus is not an autonomous being, abortion is not regarded as murder. Once most of the child has emerged from the mother’s body, M. Ohalot 7:6 rules that “it is not to be touched, for one [life] is not [to] be put aside for another.” Moses ∗ Maimonides wrote that when the mother’s life was at risk the fetus should be regarded as a pursuer (rodef) attempting to kill her and be dealt with accordingly (∗ Mishneh Torah, Rotze’ah. 1:9). Although most legal authorities permitted abortion when it was judged essential for a woman’s physical or mental 1\n\nAbortion\n\nAbraham ben David of Posqui`eres\n\nthe mother; a pregnancy resulting from irregular circumstances (rape, incest, pregnancy outside of marriage); and the probability that the fetus is severely disabled or otherwise unlikely to live a normal life. The committee approves almost all requests. Liberal political parties in Israel favor legalized abortions on the basis of a woman’s right to choose; Orthodox political parties and other traditionally oriented and right-wing groups argue that, except for rare cases, abortion should not be permitted in a Jewish state.

Schiff, Abortion in Judaism (2002). J UDITH R. B ASKIN\n\nMesopotamian literature of the late second and early first millennium BCE correspond to names in Abraham’s ancestry. Nevertheless, most would agree that the Genesis narratives about Abraham should be understood as ancestral narratives that developed over a long period of time and were shaped to express themes that were important to Israelite religion and culture.

B ASKIN\n\nAbraham bar H . iyya (ca. 1065–ca. 1140), mathematician, philosopher, and astrologer, was born in Barcelona and died in Provence. In an epistle he reports that he was held in high esteem by grandees and kings and that he was engrossed from youth in learning, dealing with, and teaching the socalled science of the stars. Bar H.iyya’s reference to grandees and kings is borne out by his appellation, Savasorda, a corruption of sahib al-shurta (chief of the guard). Abraham Bar H . iyya’s work has a scientific and encyclopedic character; it is written entirely in Hebrew, an indication that he developed his career principally among Jews. His Yesodei ha-Tevuna u-Migdal ha-‘Emuna (Foundations of Understanding and Tower of Faith) is the first medieval Hebrew encyclopaedia of science (it was edited by J. M. M. Vallicrosa in 1952). H . ibbur ha-Meshih.ah veha-Tishboret (Treatise on Mensuration and Calculation) is a mathematical work intended for the use of landholders and judges (ed. M. Guttman [1913]). Bar H.iyya described Surat ha-’Aretz (The Shape of the Earth) as presenting the “shape of the configuration of the heavens and the earth, and the order of the motion visible in the skies and in the stars” (ed. Munster [1546]). He drew up a set of planetary tables called Luh.ot ha-Nasi (Tables of the Prince), the canons of which appear in H . eshbon Mahalakhot ha-Kokhavim (Computation of the Motions of Stars; ed. J. M. M. Vallicrosa [1959]). As for the Jewish ∗ calendar, Bar H . iyya wrote Sefer ha-‘Ibbur (Book of Intercalation), which was in all likelihood the first Hebrew work of this type. This treatise also includes vigorous polemics and rich astronomical materials (ed. T. Philipowsky [1851]). Megillat ha-Megalleh (Scroll of the Revealer) is devoted to foretelling the exact date of the coming of the ∗ messiah, mainly by means of scriptural data (ed. J. Guttmann [1924]).

S HLOMO S ELA\n\nAbraham is the ancestral father of the Jewish people\n\nthrough ∗ Isaac, his son with his wife ∗ Sarah, and of the Arabs through ∗ Ishmael, his son with the Egyptian maidservant, ∗ Hagar. Abraham’s origins are in ∗ Mesopotamia in Ur of the Chaldeans (Gen 11:28); later he settles with his father Terah, his wife Sarai, and his nephew Lot in Haran. According to Genesis 12, Abraham set out with his wife and nephew for the land of ∗ Canaan in obedience to a divine mandate; there, ∗ God promised, his progeny would become a great people. Abraham’s relationship with God progresses through a series of ∗ covenants in which Abraham’s faith is tested in various ways. These covenants require transformations, including the change of name from Abram to Abraham (and Sarai to Sarah) and the institution of male ∗ circumcision (berit milah) within Abraham’s household (Gen 17). Abraham is characterized by his obedience to God’s commands, yet he also questions divine decisions, as in his bargaining with God to save the inhabitants of Sodom and Gomorrah from destruction (Gen 18). Abraham is also portrayed as less than admirable in certain circumstances; one example is when he yields his wife Sarah to another man to save his own life (Gen 20). Despite the divine promises of untold numbers of descendants who would inherit the land of Canaan, Abraham and his wife Sarah remain childless for many years, another test of Abraham’s devotion to God. The less patient Sarah attempts to provide her husband with an heir by giving him her maidservant, Hagar (Gen 16); however, after Hagar conceives and gives birth to ∗ Ishmael, tensions escalate within the household, ultimately leading to the expulsion of Hagar and her son (Gen 21). Finally, when Sarah is beyond the normal age of pregnancy, divine promises (Gen 18) are fulfilled with the birth of Isaac (Gen 21). This biblical motif of female ∗ infertility overcome by divine intervention also appears in other narratives about the births of important figures such as ∗ Jacob, ∗ Joseph, and ∗ Samuel. Perhaps the greatest challenge to Abraham’s faith is the divine commandment to sacrifice Isaac in Genesis 22. The binding of Isaac (∗ akedah), a literary masterpiece of concision and terror, establishes indisputably both the depth of Abraham’s devotion and the kind of faith that God demands. This biblical episode is followed by Sarah’s death and Abraham’s purchase of a family burial place at Machpelah (Gen 23). In his old age, Abraham marries Keturah (Gen 25) and fathers six more sons, although Isaac remains his sole heir (25:5–6). Scholars who advocate some level of historicity to the figure of Abraham point out that place names associated with the Syro-Mesopotamian (Amorite) region that are found in\n\nAbraham ben David of Posqui`eres (ca. 1125–1198), also known by the acronym Rabad, was a halakhic authority in southern ∗ France. Born in Narbonne, Rabad received most of his talmudic education from Moses b. Joseph and Meshullam b. Jacob of Lunel. Rabad used some of his significant wealth, possibly acquired through dealings in textiles, 2\n\nAbraham ben David of Posqui`eres\n\nAbulafia, Abraham\n\n` to establish and direct an important school in Posquieres. A number of his students, including his son ∗ Isaac the Blind, went on to become major scholars. Rabad’s commentaries on rabbinic texts and his ∗ responsa were particularly influential. So, too, were his annotations (hassagot) to ∗ Maimonides’ Mishneh Torah; they were frequently published together, beginning in 1509. In his hassagot, Rabad expands and reconstructs many of Maimonides’ halakhic arguments; he is critical of Maimonides both for excluding the references and explanations from earlier sources that informed his legal decisions and for some of his philosophical views. Rabad left no mystical writings, but is known to have transmitted kabbalistic teachings to his sons (see KABBALAH).

His three lengthy messianic works contain much anti-Christian argumentation. Isaac Abravanel employed Renaissance methods and ideas in both his Iberian and Italian works, attracting the attention of a wide range of Jewish scholars and many Christians, some of whom translated excerpts into Latin. JUDAH ABRAVANEL, Isaac’s son, better known as Leone Ebreo, wrote the Dialoghi d’amore (Dialogues of Love), a Renaissance Neoplatonic tract whose original language is a matter of dispute. After its posthumous publication in Italian in 1535, it was translated into other languages, including French and Latin. The work comprises three dialogues on love between the characters Philo and Sophia. Its style and contents bear strong affinities to literary and intellectual currents associated with contemporaneous Florentine Neoplatonist trends. Its later readership included Giordano Bruno, ∗ Spinoza, and Friedrich Schiller. Judah’s wrenching Hebrew lament to a son living in Portugal as a forced convert to Christianity also survives. Various Abravanels continued to hold eminent positions in ∗ Sephardic ∗ Diaspora communities during the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries. BENVENIDA (ca. 1473–after 1560) of Naples and later Ferarra, daughter of Jacob Abravanel (d. 1528), one of Isaac’s two brothers, and wife of Isaac’s son Samuel (d. 1547), was one of the most influential and wealthy Jewish women in early modern Italy. A supporter of the ∗ messianic pretender David Reuveni (d. 1538), Benvenida had close ties with Eleanor of Toledo, who became the wife of Cosimo the Great of the Medici family. The Abravanel family’s contemporary descendants live on several continents and many proudly identify with the family motto: “Basta mi nombre que es Abravanel” (It is enough that my name is Abravanel).

E RIC L AWEE\n\nAbraham ibn Daud [ben David] (ca. 1110–1180) was\n\na philosopher, historian, and astrologer in ∗ Spain; he was probably born in Cordova and is said to have died as a martyr in Toledo. The first of three scholars known by the acronym Rabad, he is sometimes designated as Rabad I. Strongly influenced by the Muslim Aristotelians, alFarabi and Avicenna, Ibn Daud was the first to introduce the Aristotelian system and form into Jewish philosophy in Ha-Emunah ha-Ramah (The Exalted Faith, trans. with commentary, N. M. Samuelson [1986]), written in Arabic around 1160. The original text is no longer extant, but two fourteenth-century Hebrew translations survive. Ibn Daud’s philosophical impact was overshadowed by ∗ Maimonides’ Guide of the Perplexed, which appeared a few decades later. Ibn Daud’s important Hebrew chronicle, Sefer ha-Kabbalah (Book of Tradition, trans. with commentary, G. D. Cohen [1967]), is a defense of the chain of rabbinic tradition against the ∗ Karaites. This work, which has messianic undertones, includes the story of the “Four Captives,” ∗ Babylonian sages who established centers of learning in Spain, ∗ North Africa, and ∗ Egypt. See also THOUGHT, MEDIEVAL. K ATE F RIEDMAN\n\nAbulafia, Abraham (1240–ca. 1291) was one of the great-\n\nest mystics among medieval Jewish ∗ kabbalists. He developed an intensely individual type of mystical contemplation based on a mystical attitude toward language. Born in ∗ Spain, Abulafia wandered in several countries, reaching Acre in 1260; he lived and taught in ∗ Sicily, ∗ Greece, and ∗ Italy. Gershom ∗ Scholem characterized his work as “ecstatic” or “prophetic” ∗ kabbalah; indeed, Abulafia sometimes described himself as a “prophet,” and the aim of his mystical contemplation was the achievement of ∗ prophecy. Abulafia rejected the prevalent kabbalistic set of symbols describing the ten divine attributes, the ∗ sefirot, as personalized elements of the divine pleroma. To assist in achieving perception of the divine, he developed mystical methodologies, including some physical exercises, a rare element among Jewish mystics. Abulafia was versed in rationalistic philosophy, but in Sitrei Torah (The Secrets of the Torah), a commentary he wrote on ∗ Maimonides’ Guide of the Perplexed, he attributes kabbalistic ideas to Maimonides. He wrote more than a score of treatises, among them a commentary on the divine name of seventy-two letters, Sefer ha-Shem (The Book of the Name); commentaries on the ancient ∗ Sefer Yetzirah (Book of Creation); and polemical works against his opponents (who\n\nAbravanel (also Abarbanel) Family. Despite their claim to ∗ Davidic descent, members of the Abravanel family first appear in history as eminent figures at a number of medieval courts in ∗ Spain. In additional to prominent financierpoliticians and Jewish communal leaders, the family produced two illustrious scholars, Isaac (1437–1509) and his eldest son Judah (ca. 1460–c. 1521), although only the former had a significant impact on later Jewish thought and literature. ISAAC ABRAVANEL, born in Lisbon in 1437, spent most of his life in ∗ Portugal; he moved to Spain in 1483, nine years before Spanish Jewry’s 1492 expulsion. A leader of Spanish Jewry at the time, he chose departure from Spain over conversion to Christianity and lived the rest of his life in ∗ Italy. Abravanel was one of late medieval and early modern Judaism’s most prolific and versatile Hebrew scholars. His premier work is his commentary on the ∗ Torah; he interpreted prophetic literature and the book of ∗ Daniel as well. Abravanel’s other writings are theological tomes, although they also often took the form of commentaries. His commentary on the ∗ Passover haggadah is the best known example. 3\n\nAbulafia, Abraham\n\nAdoption\n\nincluded Solomon ben Adret). In 1280 Abulafia was sentenced to death in Rome after he attempted to meet the Pope, Nicholas III, to convince him to be more tolerant toward the Jews; he was saved by the Pope’s death. Messianic elements became dominant in his activities in his last years, and he was accused of pretending to be the ∗ Messiah. Abulafia’s writings influenced some of the Christian kabbalists of the late fifteenth and early sixteenth centuries, especially Pico della Mirandola and Johannes Reuchlin. Some of the ∗ Safed kabbalists of the sixteenth century made use of his works, and several later Jewish mystics derived ideas from his writings. For further reading, see G.

AJR’s flexible scheduling allows part-time extended study and attracts many mature and second-career students. AJR was founded in 1956 as an independent rabbinical seminary after the nondenominational Jewish Institute of Religion merged with Hebrew Union College (Reform). AJR pioneered in promoting a pluralistic and spiritual view of Judaism, while its curriculum remained grounded in text and tradition. A cantorial school was added in 1992. In 2002, a campus was opened in Los Angeles, which currently operates independently of the New York campus while maintaining the same ethos.

I RA R OBINSON\n\nAdam is the name of the first human being in the Eden narrative of Genesis 2–3. Because the Hebrew word ’adam can be a collective noun meaning a generic “human being” (as in Gen 1:26–28), its use in Genesis 2:7 to describe the first human can be understood as denoting a genderless or androgynous being. When God divides the first human being by removing one “side” (rather than “rib”), both “woman” (’ishah) and “man” (’ish) are created as gendered beings (Gen 2:23). Throughout the narrative (except Gen 2:5) until the divine surgery, ’adam is used with the definite article and should be understood as “the human.” The proper name Adam appears unambiguously in 3:17, when Adam is told that he must undertake difficult labor to grow crops. Adam names his wife ∗ Eve in 3:20; she gives birth to three sons, ∗ Cain and Abel (Gen: 4:1-2), and Seth (Gen 4:25). The hard life of Israelite farmers, as well as the reunion of male and female in ∗ marriage, is explained in this etiological narrative. C AROL M EYERS\n\nAdoption. Historically, there has been no process of adoption in Jewish law because identity in the traditional Jewish community is determined by lineage and bloodlines. A male whose birth father is of priestly descent is also a ∗ priest, regardless of the status of the adoptive father; an adopted son cannot become a priest even if his adoptive father is of priestly descent. The status of the birth mother is also crucial: A child born of a Jewish mother is a Jew. However, a child born from an illicit sexual relationship such as incest or ∗ adultery (i.e., the mother’s husband is not the father of her child) is a ∗ mamzer (“illegitimate”) and is permanently limited in his or her standing and marital options in the traditional Jewish community. An individual may be appointed a guardian (apotropos) who assumes permanent responsibility for a child’s wellbeing, undertaking all obligations that natural parents have toward their offspring. Jewish tradition teaches that a person who raises an orphan is equivalent to a natural parent (BT Sanhedrin 19b and BT Megillah 13a). Legal sources addressing\n\nAdam Kadmon (literally “primordial man,” anthropos) is a\n\nkabbalistic term that came to represent, in the ∗ Kabbalah of the thirteenth century and later, the concept of the uppermost, hidden essence of the totality of divine powers – the pleroma – when it is conceived in anthropomorphic terms. It is a counterpart to the ancient term shiur komah, which expresses the concept of divinity in hekhalot ∗ mysticism (both terms coexisted within the Kabbalah). The term became a potent mystical symbol in the ∗ Zohar, and especially in the ∗ Lurianic myth of the late sixteenth century, in 4\n\nAdoption\n\nAesthetics\n\nthe guardian include BT Ketubbot 101b; ∗ Maimonides, Mishneh Torah, Ishut 23:17–18; and ∗ Karo, Shulh.an Arukh, Even Ha-Ezer 114 and H . oshen Mishpat 60:2–5; 207:20–21. In contemporary Jewish life, adoption of children according to the laws of the country of residence occurs frequently; perhaps 3% of contemporary Jewish families are formed by adoption. Halakhic concerns focus on the child’s Jewish status, because any uncertainty may affect the child’s ability to marry into the traditional Jewish community. Adoptive parents are often advised to obtain documentation on the natural parents’ backgrounds and marital status. Proof of the birth mother’s Jewish status is also necessary should the child move to Israel and/or wish to be married there; it is also important to know if a Jewish father was of priestly descent. To avoid many of these complexities, potential adoptive parents may choose to adopt a Gentile infant who can then be formally converted to Judaism, although conversions of adopted children may also raise halakhic questions. Until 1998, all adoptions in ∗ Israel were handled by the Adoption Service of Israel’s Ministry of Labor and Social Affairs and had to be approved by both secular and rabbinical courts. Court-sanctioned adoptions remove all family ties with the natural parents and create family ties with the adoptive parents equivalent to those between natural parents and their child. In recognition of halakhah, however, adoption does not affect the consequences of the blood relationship between the adoptee and his or her birth parents: Prohibitions and permissions regarding marriage and divorce based on the child’s bloodlines continue to apply. Only Israeli citizens may adopt Israeli infants and the process is difficult. Few healthy Jewish infants are available and adoption requirements are stringent. Israeli legislation as of 1998 allows adoptions from other countries if arranged by private, licensed, nonprofit agencies. Foreign adoptees need not have Jewish parentage or be converted to Judaism after adoption. For further reading, see M. Gold, And Hannah Wept: Infertility, Adoption, and the Jewish Couple (1988); and S. K. Rosenberg, Adoption and the Jewish Family (1998). J UDITH R. B ASKIN\n\n(Book of the Pious), are preoccupied with illicit encounters, whether real or imagined, in which Jewish men have sexual contact with single and married Jewish women (both minors and adults), Jewish and Christian maidservants, and other Christian women. These encounters are presented as temptations of everyday life, and the pietistic response is to set up as many barriers as possible to men’s contacts with women, including women of their own families. The ∗ responsa of R. ∗ Meir of Rothenburg (d. 1293) contains a number of queries in which men accuse their wives of adultery, sometimes with Jews and sometimes with Gentiles; in at least one case a wife admits adultery. In almost every instance, R. Meir rejects the veracity of the evidence and rules against the right of the husband to divorce his wife without returning her ∗ ketubbah (contracted financial settlement), even in a case where a woman bore a child twelve months after her husband’s departure on a business trip. R. Meir’s evident motivations were to preserve the public sanctity of the family, to deter men from making false accusations in order to rid themselves of unloved wives without significant expense, and to discourage women from engaging in or pretending to engage in adulterous behavior to instigate a divorce to escape an unhappy marriage. In ∗ Spain and ∗ Italy, sexual mores, particularly among wealthy acculturated Jews, were often far from halakhic ideals; archival records indicate that both men and women were involved in adulterous relationships. Accusations of adultery also figure in divorce cases in early modern and modern Eastern Europe, although here, too, they may have reflected other family tensions and anxieties (Freeze, 182). The theme of adultery appears frequently in modern Jewish literature, often symbolizing social and historical crises affecting individuals and communities. Examples include I. J. Singer’s Yoshe Kalb (Yiddish, 1932), set in a H . asidic court; I. B. Singer’s short stories and novels; S. Y. Agnon’s novel Shira (Hebrew, 1971), set in 1930s Palestine; the late-twentieth-century American novels of Saul Bellow and Philip Roth; and novels of Israeli writers Amos Oz (My Michael) and A. B. Yehoshua (The Lover), among others. For further reading see Y. Assis, “Sexual Behaviour in Mediaeval Hispano-Jewish Society,” in Jewish History: Essays in Honour of Chimen Abramsky (1988) 25–59; J.

In Judaism, adultery refers to sexual relations between a man, married or single, and a married woman (or a woman bound in some other way by ∗ halakhah to a particular man). A married man’s sexual involvement with a single woman, Jewish or Gentile, although morally problematic, is not adulterous. This gender inequity reflects the patriarchal contexts of biblical and rabbinic Judaism, as well as the importance placed on purity of lineage; a man wanted to be sure that his wife’s children were also his own. Fear of adultery led to rabbinic strictures on women’s free movement beyond the home, the expectation that modest women would be veiled outside the house, and efforts to restrict women’s contacts with men beyond the family circle. In medieval Muslim environments Jewish religious and community ideals continued to dictate that women should remain at home. Although ∗ marriages were often unhappy and ∗ divorce was not uncommon, accusations of adultery against wives rarely appear in sources from this milieu. In Germany and elsewhere in Northern Europe, where women were far less sequestered than in the Muslim world, concern with adultery was more frequent.
