        "text": "In different cultures and different times, change and progress are guaranteed to plant the seeds of family conflict.\n\nAs children grow, they play out time-tested scripts of rebellion and defiance that manage to seem fresh and raw, even as they repeat through every generation. Parents forbid progressive attitudes and unapproved behaviors, while children find parents stifling and resist their influence. Stories of intergenerational growing pains are so universal that they can veer dangerously toward triteness.\n\nSavyon Liebrecht’s award-winning script, “Apples from the Desert,” isn’t the first to tell a story like this from a Jewish perspective, but Liebrecht has crafted the story artfully.\n\nIn “Apples,” Reuven (Albert Banker) embodies patriarchal tradition by tightly clenching his fists and his family’s purse strings. His wife, Victoria (Carol Bloom), and her sister Sarah (Pamela Vanderpool) are able to sidestep his threatening presence, but his daughter Rivka (Megan Hatch) is not as easily subdued.\n\nRivka’s involvement with the progressive influences of a secular male friend (Michael Boyer) pushes the tension in the family to its breaking point. As she attempts to escape her father’s unbending reign, the whole family discovers what love and change have to do with strength and tradition.\n\nWhat might set this telling of these well-worn themes apart from others is that “Apples from the Desert” focuses on the transformation of the parents as much, if not more, than the transformation of the child. The unexpected changes that follow the challenges endured by Reuven and Victoria make the story more lasting than one of successful teenage rebellion.\n\nAnother strength of the story, enforced by the casting choices made by Theater Or in this production, is the unique, underground support structure that the women provide for one another.\n\nThis strength is inspiring, and most apparent in Pamela Vanderpool’s performance as the sharply independent Sarah, who despite a hunched physical presence, has the most commendable backbone of the three.\n\nVanderpool’s comic timing is impeccable and uncontrived, and she confidently delivers the most natural performance of the bunch. Carol Bloom’s wise, warm and timid Victoria achieves a simplicity that makes easy sense of a complex character, torn by allegiance to her husband and love for her daughter.\n\nAs the rebellious Rivka, Megan Hatch is more convincing when she is alight with joy and freedom than when she is afire with rage and defiance, but her performance is ultimately convincing.\n\nMichael Boyer brings a goofy and lovable spirit to the sincere and dedicated Dooby, who leads Rivka toward the future while demonstrating respect for her family’s values. His mild nature is countered by the stern and domineering Reuven, played with puzzling incoherence by Albert Banker.\n\nBanker’s forceful, staccato line delivery lends an unnatural force to the character that reads as discomfort rather than anger or authority. The effects of his rage, which are necessary to drive the plot forward, are more aptly demonstrated by the reactions of the women onstage than by the authenticity of his outbursts.\n\nThe design team at Theater Or wisely exercised restraint in bringing this metaphor-laden piece to life, employing an efficient, dust-colored set with bright red accents, designed by Tina Anderson. The other design elements are attractive and appropriate to the storytelling, and fit well into the intimate space in the Pluss Theater.\n\n“Apples from the Desert” might not break new ground, but it has deep, relatable roots. The play’s sensitive handling, especially by the women in capable company, make it a warm, worthwhile offering from Theater Or.\n\nKateri McRae, an assistant professor at the University of Denver, is the “she” half of the “He Said/She Said Critiques,” which can be found at milehighcritics.wordpress.com.
