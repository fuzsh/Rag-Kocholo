As soon as today is over. Quickly, in our time. Not dreams of a far-oﬀ future or the Kingdom of Heaven at the end of a dark tunnel. It would all be right here, tomorrow. This little acre. This mule. This child. The redemption will come here and now and not in a generation that is all saints or all sinners or on the day that the tears of Jacob and Esau cease. —Nathan Shaham The impossibility of utopia is less a demonstration of the failure of conviviality than an ongoing proof of our determination to keep on trying. —Alberto Manguel\n\nEven more than two decades after leaving the kibbutz, I need only close my eyes for a moment or two for its rich textures and sensations to rush back in almost unbidden with startling intensity: the growling rumbles of tractors bearing wagons of sun-scorched and sweat-drenched laborers up the dusty road from our ﬁelds and orchards, the furnace heat under white desert summer skies, the gentle bubbling and hissing of the drip irrigation, the pungent aromas of rotting orange peels and manure in the cowshed. The dining hall’s incessant scraping of moving chairs, small talk, excited debates, anarchic herds of roaming children, wicked jokes, and explosive laughter, all of it reverberating and ﬁlling the humming air, the bountiful refuse of eggshells, cucumber peels, olive pits, and globs of sour runny yogurt topped oﬀ with cigarette butts all stewing in the aluminum kolboinik atop each table. Then, at night, the drowsy and companionable silences of those sipping Wissotzky tea after being reluctantly roused for the early milking shift. The exhausting work—how ever did we summon the energy for those passionate arguments in the late nights of the members’ assembly? Those seemingly endless days all came and went in a\n\n18679-Omer-Sherman_Imagining.indd 1\n\n3/13/15 4:59 PM\n\n2\n\nimagining the kibbutz\n\nrapid stream, yet now they pause and linger because neither heart nor mind ever wishes to relinquish any of it. In today’s virtual community, however, idealists (academic or otherwise) increasingly inhabit their own hermetic worlds, and it has not been my good fortune to know very many (aside from a few aging red-diaper babies and veterans of the Civil Rights Movement) who have really lived their social vision consciously, day in, day out. To a great extent, this study is inspired by the many extraordinary years I was fortunate to share with some remarkable people, a few of them gone now, who actually acted on a fairly radical political vision. Although they could be as petty, scandalous, or annoying as just about anyone else, to a striking degree, they were also tireless and often even truly selﬂess. Sharing a preternatural utopian impulse, they were perfectly willing to spend their lives laboring on 110-degree days within the conﬁnes of an isolated settlement of homely prefabricated dwellings and sparse greenery, patiently rotating jobs and working unseemly hours whenever that was required of them, in plain view of the modest cemetery they ﬁgured to one day inhabit. There is no other way to put it: we came to the kibbutz with a sense of joyful purpose. As if intuitively attracted to the kind of place where, to borrow from Frederick Buechner’s spiritual imperative, “your deep gladness and the world’s deep hunger meet” (95), we eagerly and, yes, so naively plunged into what is surely one of the more strangely optimistic but ultimately successful ventures in the history of human societies, for decades the most productive socialist system in the world (well outlasting the Communist regimes of the Eastern Bloc). It was world making at its purest, unhindered by nostalgia or our immediate pasts, every choice consciously, painstakingly made. Like many others, during my kibbutz years, I often felt a sense of euphoria but sometimes also disaﬀection and withdrawal. As I gradually began to discover during that sojourn, there is a signiﬁcant body of extraordinary literature brimming with a heady mix of ardent idealism and lonely alienation, richly illuminating the complex responses many of us have experienced. Over time, many of those works became intensely meaningful companions for me in periods of both faith and disaﬀection. First and foremost, there were the works of Amos Oz (a veteran of more than thirty years of collective living), his early kibbutz stories often written in the collective persona, an ironic voice leaving delicately veiled traces of malaise in its wake that, back in those days, struggling at times to hold onto my idealistic ardor, left me shaken. That curiously supercilious tone immediately distinguishes the language of Oz’s ﬁrst novel, Makom aher (Elsewhere, Perhaps; 1966), guiding us on our ﬁrst steps into the unfamiliar world and fraught psychological mineﬁelds of the\n\n18679-Omer-Sherman_Imagining.indd 2\n\n3/13/15 4:59 PM\n\nintroduction\n\n3\n\nﬁctional Kibbutz Metsudat Ram. Here we are made to understand the collective’s symbolic place in the surrounding topography, the exacting but attractive surfaces of utopian engineering (a notable contrast to this frontier settlement’s threatening existential situation in the ominous pre–1967 War period and to the inner torments of the souls within), and ﬁnally its unapologetic elitism: [Our] buildings are laid out in strict symmetry at one end of the green valley. The tangled foliage of the trees does not break up the settlement’s severe lines, but merely softens them, and adds a dimension of weightiness. The buildings are whitewashed, and most of them are topped with bright red roofs. This color scheme contrasts sharply with that of the mountain range . . . at the foot of which the kibbutz lies spread. . . . Along the lower terraces on the slope stretches the border between our land and that of her enemies. . . . . . . There is a kind of enmity between the valley, with its neat, geometrical patchwork of ﬁelds[,] and the savage bleakness of the mountains. . . . The houses, as we have said, are brightly painted. They are laid out at regular intervals. Their windows all face northwest, since the architects tried to adapt the building to the climate. Here there is no agglomeration of buildings clustering or ramifying haphazardly down the ages, nor blocks of dwellings enclosing secret courtyards, for the kibbutz does not have family homes. There is no question of separate quarters for diﬀerent crafts; the poor are not relegated to the outskirts nor is the center reserved for the wealthy. The straight lines, the clean shapes, the neatly ruled concrete paths and rectangular lawns are the product of a vigorous view of the world. That was what we meant when we stated that our village was built in a spirit of optimism. Anyone who draws the shallow inference that our village is stark and lacking in charm and beauty merely reveals his own prejudice. The object of the kibbutz is not to satisfy the sentimental expectations of town dwellers. Our village is not lacking in charm and beauty, but its beauty is vigorous and virile and its charm conveys a message. Yes, it does. (Elsewhere, Perhaps 3–5) Notwithstanding the scattered hints of dread toward the internal human disorders and external hazards that invariably transgress the community’s prudent geometrical designs (which do not altogether distract from the mischievous\n\n18679-Omer-Sherman_Imagining.indd 3\n\n3/13/15 4:59 PM\n\n4\n\nimagining the kibbutz\n\nfun Oz perpetrates with this aﬀectedly portentous voice), there is no mistaking his palpable reverence for its essence, the nobility of the historical mission underlying it all. Today, it deeply impresses that, as an “outsider” still in his twenties, Oz’s mastery of literary art could achieve such equipoise. Forsaking the familiarity of his father’s Jerusalem home to rush wholeheartedly into the alien life of the kibbutz, he yet remained enough of an individual to poke fun at that insular society’s exasperating self-seriousness even as he so aptly captured its condition of anxious vulnerability: “The huts bestow a pioneering character on the whole picture, the air of a border settlement ready to turn a resolute face to impending disasters. So does the sloping fence that surrounds the kibbutz on all sides. Let us pause here for a moment to evoke your admiration” (Elsewhere, Perhaps 6). Yet, in spite of that light note of mockery, such “admiration” ﬂowed forth from all over the world at the very moment Oz was writing—and for many years to come. Attractive portrayals abound in the ﬁction and memoirs of even those writers most critical of the kibbutz, perhaps in acknowledgment of our intrinsic human yearning for utopia (sometimes even after we are disillusioned). For who can resist warming to this classic snapshot of the kibbutz’s indisputable pastoral allure, as seen through the eyes of Inspector Michael Ohayon of Batya Gur’s famous mystery novels? Largely indiﬀerent, if not altogether hostile, to the kibbutz as an institution that he ﬁnds markedly unwelcoming to Mizrahi Jews like himself, Ohayon is nevertheless charmed by its attractive spaces and alluring rhythm of life: Michael sensed the contradiction between the tempo of his movements and the surrounding serenity. Children rode bicycles on the paths, and three toddlers were being pushed in a mobile playpen. . . . The young man pushing it and the toddlers sitting inside were tanned and serene. . . . On the lawns . . . parents sat with their children. . . . Again Michael took in the cultivated landscape around him, the pruned, thick-trunked trees, the sign saying ‘Six-hundred-year-old sycamore’ on one of the massive trunks, the greenness of the lawns, the merrily dancing sprinklers. Once or twice old women in golf carts forced them to step oﬀ the path onto the lawn. [He] passed the culture center, the sports hall, and the spacious playing ﬁeld, from which they could hear cheering and a thudding ball; [he] passed playgrounds with jungle gyms and slides. People in bathing suits were returning from the pool on their bicycles. (Murder on a Kibbutz 214–15)\n\n18679-Omer-Sherman_Imagining.indd 4\n\n3/13/15 4:59 PM\n\nintroduction\n\n5\n\nSimilarly, Avraham Balaban’s memoir Shiv’ah (Mourning a Father Lost; 2000), though often a caustic and wounded account of childhood deprivation, aﬀectionately conjures up the enthralling epic of labor and pioneering in the upper Galilee in language that washes over the reader in breathless ebullience: Imagine a group of people in a not very big house, who have committed themselves to sleeping together, eating together, bathing together, and toiling on the land together. . . . The ancestral land yields wheat and olives and milk. You can’t know what it feels like to return home in the evening, sit on the shadowed concrete steps, and pull oﬀ your work boots, knowing that you’ve picked a quarter-tonne of apples, and the picking movements linger in the weary body . . . like a mild intoxication. The work does not give [the pioneers] a new heart, but it does sometimes produce a countryman’s contentment, a countryman’s joy and honest sleep. On feast days there is such rejoicing that the heart seems to melt, and even on working days, after supper . . . there is laughter and idle chat in the corners of the dining hall. An old comradeship envelops the inhabitants. (Mourning 34) You would have to be completely obtuse not to be entranced by Balaban’s language, so knowingly does his empathic portrayal of the zeal of the past rekindle the dream that once inﬂamed so many. Even the late Tony Judt, more famously known for his sharp criticism of Israel, was at ﬁrst enraptured by the kibbutz experiment, toiling three long summers as a young volunteer during the 1960s. Judt’s “Kibbutz” memoir recalls his early days, “proselytizing Labour Zionism as an unpaid oﬃcial of one of its youth movements.” Years later, like most anyone who sojourned on kibbutzim at some point during their youth, he simply cannot suppress his early romantic ardor, his giddy sense of adventure: For the neophyte ﬁfteen-year-old Londoner encountering the kibbutz for the ﬁrst time, the eﬀect was exhilarating. Here was “Muscular Judaism” in its most seductive guise: health, exercise, productivity, collective purpose, self-suﬃciency, and proud separatism—not to mention the charms of kibbutz children of one’s own generation, apparently free of all the complexes and inhibitions of their European peers (free, too, of most of their cultural baggage—though this did not trouble me until later). I adored it. Eight hours of strenuous, intellectually undemanding labor in steamy banana plantations by the shores of the Sea of Galilee,\n\n18679-Omer-Sherman_Imagining.indd 5\n\n3/13/15 4:59 PM\n\n6\n\nimagining the kibbutz\n\ninterspersed with songs, hikes, lengthy doctrinal discussions (carefully stage-managed so as to reduce the risk of adolescent rejection while maximizing the appeal of shared objectives), and the ever-present suggestion of guilt-free sex. Fond kibbutz coming-of-age reminiscences by North American or British Jewish writers who, like Judt, became brieﬂy acquainted with kibbutz life (whether or not they enjoyed amorous adventures in the volunteer quarters or orchards) are not all that uncommon. The American-born immigrant Yossi Klein Halevi launches his masterful historical study of the unraveling of national unity in the years after the 1967 War with this empathic scene, in which an Israeli paratrooper seems to ﬁnd his greatest happiness toiling in his kibbutz’s citrus harvest: In the orange orchards of Kibbutz Ein Shemer, Avital Geva, barefoot and shirtless in the early-morning sun, was frying eggs in a blackened pan. Turkish coﬀee was boiling in the aluminum pot, and his friends were laying out plates of tomatoes and cucumbers and olives, white cheese and jam. “Ya Allah, what a feast!” exclaimed Avital, as if encountering for the ﬁrst time the food he had eaten for breakfast every day since childhood. It was mid-May 1967. Avital and his crew had been working since dawn, to outwit the heat of the day. Rather than return to the communal dining room for breakfast, the young men allowed themselves the privilege of eating together beneath the corrugated roof they’d erected for just that purpose. Could there be greater joy, thought Avital, than working the ﬁelds with one’s closest friends and sharing food grown by their kibbutz? One could almost forget about the crisis on the Egyptian border. (3) Here is the primal scene that allured so many other young people: the warm camaraderie in simple labor certainly, perhaps even the appealing hint of danger that was never entirely absent. Yet, more strikingly, we encounter the same kind of appealing utopian simplicity in the evocative imagery of a writer from a strikingly diﬀerent background, Atallah Mansour (b. 1934), a young Arab journalist and native of Palestine who wrote one of the least known yet utterly remarkable works in the literary history of the kibbutz. Indeed, B’or hadash (In a New Light; 1966) was the very ﬁrst Hebrew novel published by a Palestinian Arab and, though ﬁlled with its Arab protagonist’s anguished struggle to belong, it is generously openhearted in setting the scene: “The sand is white and so are the houses. The red-tile roofs, abetted by the small vegetable\n\n18679-Omer-Sherman_Imagining.indd 6\n\n3/13/15 4:59 PM\n\nintroduction\n\n7\n\ngardens, turn the landscape into a naïve kindergarten drawing” (In a New Light 20). Whether or not they ever experienced the life of a kibbutz, those who read the novels of Gur and Mansour or the memoirs of Balaban and Judt will likely succumb to the warm tug of their alluring renderings of bucolic community life—that is, until things take a more dystopian turn, as they often do in the disenchanted nuances of many kibbutz narratives. For such writers (self-critical insiders and outsiders alike), writing honestly about kibbutz life demands keeping at least two central contraries in mind at once—the absolute necessity of euphoric dreaming and the mellowing inevitability of disillusionment. These brief vignettes serve to illustrate that, for almost all who doubt whether they harbor a secret attraction to communal life, such uncertainty vanishes upon their ﬁrst visit to a kibbutz, if only for a brief glimpse. What they perceive there will likely strike a deeply resonant chord even when they cannot imagine themselves actually living in such a place. Such encounters often elicit the sense of wonder and even wistful daydreams of alternative lives sometimes associated with visits to monasteries. After all, people since antiquity have sought ways to opt out of mainstream society to launch schemes of utopian communities (think of the Essenes, the late pagan Athenians, and other communities that formed in the ancient Mediterranean world), a trend that only intensiﬁed in the modern age (witness Samuel Taylor Coleridge’s unrealized dream of a Pantisocracy on the banks of the Susquehanna and the actual proliferation of nineteenth-century communes in the United States). Yet important distinctions between the self-understanding of these short-lived experimental antecedents—or even contemporary American exemplars such as the Twin Oaks Community, East Wind, and The Farm (whose members numbered 1,500 in the late 1970s)—and the kibbutz must be acknowledged. As journalist Daniel Gavron points out: “Where other communes rejected society and retreated from it, the kibbutz embraced society and sought to lead it. The symbiosis between the kibbutz and the surrounding community is what gave it its strength and inﬂuence” (3–4). Still, like any other human institution, the kibbutz in its fullest realization evolved in some ways and devolved in others, adapting to the internal and external forces severely buﬀeting it over a century of transformation. The study before you examines some of the most provocative narratives (created mostly by insiders but occasionally by outsiders), to imaginatively portray that ensuing struggle over generations. And, to be candid, I wrote Imagining the Kibbutz in part out of a sense of dismay and even a degree of anger at how rapidly the kibbutz’s extraordinary achievements are fading into mythic irrelevance. I share the sentiments of Yossi\n\n18679-Omer-Sherman_Imagining.indd 7\n\n3/13/15 4:59 PM\n\n8\n\nimagining the kibbutz\n\nKlein Halevi, who, in an interview that often stresses his roots in the Betar Movement and his onetime loyalties to Revisionist Zionism, paused to passionately aﬃrm the extraordinary legacy of the kibbutz: “Did Zionism really produce this mass movement of egalitarian communes? What a story. How have we allowed this movement to fade away, without at the very least saying thank you. We are a society of ingrates. We owe our existence to the kibbutzim” (Green). Most kibbutz historians categorize the movement’s development in relation to three social paradigms. In the early kibbutzim of the 1910s to 1920s, an intensely communal aspect prevailed; in the next two decades, with the rise of national and political aspirations, the kibbutz sought a role in the surrounding society; and in the 1950s, entrepreneurial ambitions competed with, and eventually overshadowed, the kibbutz’s communal and political tendencies to culminate in the late twentieth-century hafrata or privatization model of our own time. Whereas many have charted the atrophying eﬀects of political events (in particular, the 1977 election of Menachem Begin as prime minister after three decades of supportive Labor rule) and economic stresses (the abrupt loss of subsidies, tax breaks, and other forms of government support), few have highlighted the acute psychological stresses these inﬂicted on kibbutzniks, who had once proudly considered themselves an aristocracy of pioneers (as already glimpsed in the passage from Oz’s Elsewhere, Perhaps). What followed was a debilitating blow to that pride. As historian Anita Shapira notes: The kibbutz was the crown jewel of the labor movement’s social creativity. It combined a vision of equality, devotion to society, and recruitment for national missions. The values prized by the kibbutz were physical labor, a simple lifestyle, a culture of low-key restraint, and making do with little. There was no other sector in Israeli society whose values so opposed those of Begin and the culture he represented. Begin realized that if he wished to change the narrative of the state, he would have to undermine the status of the kibbutz as the most important creation of Zionism. (Israel 386–87) It is not hard to imagine the sense of siege, the magnitude of estrangement that kibbutz veterans felt in the toxic atmosphere unleashed by what Shapira dubs Begin’s “deadly criticism” (386) following so many decades of their service to the state’s needs on so many vital fronts. They were bewildered to ﬁnd themselves accused of living “oﬀ the fat of the land . . . their wealth originat[ing] in\n\n18679-Omer-Sherman_Imagining.indd 8\n\n3/13/15 4:59 PM\n\nintroduction\n\n9\n\n. . . resources that had been kept from the development towns” (386). Shapira acknowledges “a grain of truth” in the stereotype: “but no more than a grain.” With considerable justiﬁcation, she argues that the kibbutzim “earned their relative ﬁnancial robustness with hard work, and for many years had endured harsh conditions” (386). The new stereotypes that rapidly gained currency owed much to the fact that “their pastoral appearance highlighted the contrast between them and the development towns,” which had indeed suﬀered years of neglect (a story we will encounter in chapter 3). As Shapira shows, it was inevitable that Begin’s discordant language “fell on willing ears” (387), the issue becoming only more complicated with the Left’s initially unpopular protests against the 1982 Lebanon War since the kibbutzim remained “bastions of the leftist elite.” Sadly, “the fact that the number of kibbutz members among the combat troops exceeded by far their relative proportion in the population did not prevent the incitement against them” (387). But, as early as the 1960s, even before the Likud’s crafty manipulation of the disenfranchised Mizrahim through its grotesque viliﬁcation of the kibbutz and Begin’s distortion of historical memory, a severe internal shift in attitudes toward the individual and the collective had caused unprecedented turmoil within the kibbutz. And that interior metamorphosis bore unanticipated consequences, which later proved explosive in the drastically changed conditions of privatization that the surrounding society imposed. Attentive readers of my study may conclude with some justiﬁcation that, in the earliest kibbutz narratives, the individual is tested, whereas, in later decades, the collective itself seems to bear the burden of demonstrating its capacity to accommodate individual aspirations and even human weaknesses. By the 1960s, that shift seems to reﬂect the growing restlessness that swept through the movement. In his eminently worthy study of the post-1950s kibbutz, historian Alon Gan uncovers “the ideological roots that prepared the ground for the radical changes we are witnessing today” (43). Hence, amid the plethora of critical external transformations and pressures described by many kibbutz economists and sociologists, there also emerged the sharply divergent sensibility of the young kibbutzniks themselves. At a kibbutz youth conference held by the Ihud Movement in 1971, a member from Kibbutz Rosh Hanikra spoke of the need to satisfy the aspirations of members of a new generation no longer content to spend their entire lives working in a cowshed: “Until now it was customary to adapt the wishes of the people to the needs of the kibbutz, and they were dominant. This was usually accepted without opposition. But now the younger generation is promoting a new approach, calling for changes in the kibbutz structure that would provide more opportunities for the realization of\n\n18679-Omer-Sherman_Imagining.indd 9\n\n3/13/15 4:59 PM\n\n10\n\nimagining the kibbutz\n\na greater variety of aspirations in the occupational domain” (Gan 43). Writing in 1985 from the perspective of a much earlier generation, Zerubavel Gilead, who arrived at Kibbutz Ein Harod as an eleven-year-old in 1924, decries the worldwide skepticism of the younger generation about the validity of traditional idealistic values, and the worldwide permissiveness that springs from the skepticism. Although the kibbutzim, and indeed the country as a whole, have generally been free of the conﬂ icts between the generations that have aﬄicted most of the world since the 1960s and beyond, the spirit of rebellion against accepted values has expressed itself among our young in a new tendency to insist on what they call selfrealization—meaning the realization of what they deem to be good for them individually, without much reference to what may be good for the community as a whole. . . . This drive toward self-realization . . . has led to a signiﬁcant increase in the number of azivot (departures). (Gilead and Krook 279) Whether or not one bemoans the degradation of the traditional kibbutz, this critical shift clearly laid the foundation for the radical processes of privatization that followed the economic crisis of later years. In his elegantly succinct formulation of what ensued, Gan argues that “the idea of self-realization created an upheaval in kibbutz perceptions and discourse, diverting the focus from the individual as a means to the realization of the aims of society to society as a means to the realization of the individual’s potential” (43). As we will see in chapter 1, intimations of this monumental swing—from the primacy of the collective to the primacy of the individual—surface as a source of anxiety in some of the earliest literary narratives by kibbutz writers. Gan’s exposition of the critical fundamentals underlying that notable shift is compelling: The kibbutz movement preserved the collectivist ethos as its formative and guiding principle. While opposition to this ethos was already in the air in Israel, the kibbutz movement fought against this “destructive tendency.” The principles of the collectivist ethos were laid down by the pioneer generation. The 1948 generation made its own contribution by adopting the “culture of we,” consolidated as the [Palmach] soldiers . . . gathered around the bonﬁre. The kibbutz made the collective tasks a top priority and demanded that the members comply—that they sacriﬁce their private desires and aspirations to the needs and demands of the\n\n18679-Omer-Sherman_Imagining.indd 10\n\n3/13/15 4:59 PM\n\nintroduction\n\n11\n\nsociety. From the early sixties on, however, we can discern a growing tendency to divert the emphasis from “we” to “me.” (38–39) Gan captures the individualistic departures from classic values, precedents leading to the subsequent dismantling of collectivization, in the starkest terms: “From the kibbutz as a meaningful way of life to the kibbutz as a home; from ‘exclamation marks’ to ‘question marks’; from ideological discourse to psychological parlance; from ‘we’ to ‘me’; from the collective to the self-realization ethos” (33–34). Whereas the founders conceived of their lives as a bold alternative to the debasing eﬀects of capitalism, those born in the kibbutz regarded themselves as simply at “home,” a natural way of being that did not demand “any ideological justiﬁcations” (34). And that diﬀerence gave rise to all the questioning by kibbutz writers, culminating in the critical narratives of doubt and recrimination addressed in the later pages of this study. Self-consciously, the earlier writers recognized that if the kibbutz was somehow intended to be a permanent departure from or a radical discontinuity with recent Jewish history, that grandiose revolution failed (and as we will discover in chapter 1, sobering misgivings emerged even in portrayals by writers who were among the most fervent ideologues). Yet such was the mythic power of that revolution that its allure persists for many. Imagining the Kibbutz aspires to fulﬁll what I have long felt to be an urgent need—to provide an altogether diﬀerent perspective from that aﬀorded by the long tradition of kibbutz research amassed by social scientists and other investigators of various spheres of kibbutz life (industry, agriculture, education, economics). Inevitably, such investigations have neglected the individual, that precious and intimate realm to which the writer’s imagination is invariably dedicated. Some of the most compelling works I address exhibit distinctly extranarrative lives that deeply resonate with their authors’ very personal entanglements with the history of the kibbutz, lives that ensure the humanizing provenance of their art. The relationship between literature, the rise of the kibbutz, and the individual is a fascinating story, one whose beginning Iris Milner astutely recounts: The ﬁrst decades of the kibbutz were marked by a consistent rise in its status as a leading, indispensable factor in the Israeli social and political milieu. Literature’s commitment to the support and reinforcement of this status is apparent not only in its treatment of the kibbutz setting . . . but also in the dramatic narratives that it presents. This is particularly\n\n18679-Omer-Sherman_Imagining.indd 11\n\n3/13/15 4:59 PM\n\n12\n\nimagining the kibbutz\n\nevident in the historical novels that follow the development of speciﬁc kibbutzim through their initial stages. The chain of events these novels commonly recount starts from the very ﬁrst steps of the communal group and leads to its successful establishment. The overt message thus relayed clearly relates to the advantages of kibbutz ideology and practices in “conquering” the land of Israel and in accomplishing the desired metamorphosis of the allegedly sick diasporic “Jewish” body into a vital, manly, cured Israeli one. (164) Decades later, even though the kibbutz no longer held the lofty, commanding position Milner describes, I found myself as profoundly stirred by its values as countless other youths had been before me. So many of us were utterly enthralled by the kibbutz’s revolutionary aura: “Egalitarianism and equality . . . presented not only as just and moral social causes, but as crucial conditions for the realization of national, Zionist aspirations” (Milner 165). Accordingly, in the 1970s, I leaped at the opportunity to help establish a young kibbutz, Yahel, in the southern Arava Desert with other young people from Israel as well as the United States. And though every day seemed to present daunting challenges, both agricultural and social, in those halcyon and endless days, it seemed to many of us that everything was possible. Some of us felt that we had found fulﬁllment beyond anything we had ever thought possible, and we could not imagine ever leaving, whereas others were soon discomﬁted by the lack of privacy for individuals or families or by the diﬃculty of adjusting to a life so far removed from urban pleasures. Years after moving away with his growing family, Ellis Shuman, a close friend with whom I once worked in the kibbutz cowshed and who had served for a time as kibbutz secretary, published a dozen stories in English examining the struggles of a variety of kibbutz members adapting to “new realities.” Today, his collection The Virtual Kibbutz: Stories from a Changing Society (2003) strikes me as a profoundly perceptive portrayal of new developments, one that also grapples with the themes that have long preoccupied the literary witnesses to the rise and perpetual transformation (or deterioration) of the kibbutz. Since my friend is both a genuine autodidact and a natural optimist, it is hardly surprising that his stories are largely hopeful. Even as they range across the sharp vicissitudes faced by ordinary individuals (the turmoil of youth, the crisis of aging) as well as society (relations between Arabs and Jews, the wrenching shift from socialism to capitalism), more often than not, they conclude on notes of reconciliation or gentle open-endedness, tending to aﬃrm the kibbutz’s extraordinary ability to adapt. Yet, after experiencing thirteen years of communal life, I ﬁ nd\n\n18679-Omer-Sherman_Imagining.indd 12\n\n3/13/15 4:59 PM\n\nintroduction\n\n13\n\nmyself more drawn to the few stories in his collection that are decidedly darker, more ambivalent in tone. These feature veteran kibbutzniks dreading changes that threaten the values they have spent lifetimes defending or former kibbutzniks looking in from the outside. In a story representative of the sanguine majority, “The Kibbutz at the End of the Universe,” Avi, a wealthy developer, tries to coax a kibbutz into converting its low-proﬁt agricultural lands into a commercial center. This soured businessman bitterly dwells on how a kibbutz accident had drastically changed his life—he lost several ﬁngers to the blades of a harvest machine. Now, years later, a reunion of his old Nahal comrades tempts him with the delicious prospect of ﬂaunting the extraordinary success he has achieved since those distant days of dreams, sweat, and toil. Yet the mere sight of verdant ﬁelds and hothouses in Israel’s desert unexpectedly rekindles his long-extinguished idealism. Gradually, the desire to ﬂaunt his success before old comrades wanes, and Avi comes to the happy realization that “business was not on the agenda . . . but friendship was” (Virtual Kibbutz 120). Along with the character’s sentimental epiphany, this story highlights the remarkable vigor and bold experimentation of Israel’s desert settlements. In marked contrast to that story’s sunny mood and its protagonist’s redemption, Shuman’s epistolary story “The Receding Shoreline” strikes a distinctly elegiac, even melancholy tone, as the narrator, one of the founding generation of pioneers (now reduced to a “few powerless idealists”), witnesses the death of his kibbutz. Based on the shores of the Kinneret (Sea of Galilee), it once withstood Syrian shelling, only to succumb to capitalism as it is woefully transformed into villas for rich outsiders (perhaps by the wealthy developer Avi?). At his brother’s gravesite (a man who had sacriﬁced his life in a gruesome agricultural accident), the narrator contemplates the stark fact that “there is no younger generation to replace us” (137). In a similar mode, Genya, the ailing founder of “Requiem for a Dream,” shudders at the construction project that will bring about the ruin of her world by selling oﬀ lots to outsiders eager to escape Israel’s congested urban areas but not remotely inclined to join the social fabric of the kibbutz community: “The kibbutz was dead, of this Genya was certain. She had no need to look further than out of her kitchen window to see the most recent proof of the kibbutz’s demise. There, barely a hundred meters from her home, was the construction site. The walls of the new houses were rising daily. Sweat-drenched foreign workers struggled with heavy bags of cement and pounded nails into wooden frames” (159). Of course (and perhaps even its author overlooked this irony), the fact that Genya’s house even includes a kitchen from which to bemoan the demise of the kibbutz would itself have\n\n18679-Omer-Sherman_Imagining.indd 13\n\n3/13/15 4:59 PM\n\n14\n\nimagining the kibbutz\n\nbeen cause for anguish in an earlier generation, a reminder to purists that, confronting one change or another, the kibbutz has always been in crisis. Beyond his spot-on portrayal of the social upheavals still corroding the kibbutz movement, what Ellis Shuman most successfully captures is the plight of disenfranchised individuals like Genya, who, lonely, frustrated, and aggrieved that, after a vigorous life of labor amid like-minded comrades, she must now rely on a walker to get around, dreads what is to come: “She held on to the metal bars of the walker, looking out at buildings that would serve their residents as nothing more than a physical place to sleep. These people, her future neighbors, would have no part of the kibbutz, its democratic institutions or its joint, collective future. They were purchasing the positive elements of life in her community—her home—while assuming none of the obligations” (159). In her anguished state, the dwellings under construction appear like “tombstones in a cement covered cemetery” (160). Shuman bookends the story with scenes of Genya hospitalized after a bitter ideological battle with her own daughter— whom she calls a traitor for “leading this anti-kibbutz revolution” (183)—leaves her broken in spirit. Slowly recovering, she recalls her late husband’s advice ﬁfty years earlier, to accept the fact that “a kibbutz is a living organism. Its members adapt and change. . . . You have to learn to embrace changes. . . . Changes are a part of going forward. Don’t be afraid to allow changes to be part of your life” (190), an ethos that eventually guides Genya to reconcile with her daughter. And that would seem to be Shuman’s own determined perspective on the way forward for the kibbutz were it not for the ﬁnal story in the collection, judiciously titled “A Balanced Picture.” Here a researcher for a television documentary ﬁnds himself inspired by the strategies with which many traditional kibbutzim staunchly resist the sweeping economic processes that might endanger their collectivist and egalitarian values, especially the wellbeing of their more vulnerable members. It intrigues me that Shuman ﬁrst conceived the idea for this collection long after he left the kibbutz. Writing my own book has led me to share his belated understanding (and apparently also that of many artists, ﬁlmmakers, researchers, and bloggers) that the kibbutz is never quite done with us, not even many years after we think we have moved on. We both consider ourselves fortunate to have participated in such an exuberant adventure. For so many of us, being former kibbutzniks remains an important part of how we identify ourselves later in life and of the values we try to uphold, no matter how much our paths eventually diverge. Nevertheless, my friend Ellis wrote his stories in the wake of the transformative 1990s, by which time the kibbutz was the last surviving, nearly anachronistic institutional remnant of Israel’s once-vital socialism, and,\n\n18679-Omer-Sherman_Imagining.indd 14\n\n3/13/15 4:59 PM\n\nintroduction\n\n15\n\nafter the degradations wrought by privatization, many had come to view it as little more than a lifeless fossil. The kibbutz writers inaugurated some of the ﬁrst antiheroes in the Hebrew literature of the Yishuv and the early years of the Israeli state. Perhaps because of their often conﬂicted views on the kibbutz’s social complexity, their narratives express a bold mixture of moods and modes of storytelling—exuberant and sour, conﬁdent and gloomily foreboding, blunt and sly, satirical and sincere. A great deal of their strength resides in choosing not to stack the deck— even in the most contentious ideological battles of the day, every camp makes its case, so that we must make our own choices as readers. And always we feel the ferment and urgency of acute social pressures, the sense that it all matters terribly. Even now, the raw power and urgency of their works sternly rouses us from our complacency and detachment. Not surprisingly, kibbutz ﬁction runs the gamut of styles distinguishing Modern Hebrew literature (social realism, psychological realism, mythic epic, magical realism, allegory, to name a few) and of its broadest thematic preoccupations (questions of identity and place, tensions between religious tradition and socialist secularization, the sacriﬁce of young lives, rifts between Diaspora and national homeland). Most memorably of all, its writers have contributed some of the most exciting perspectives on Israeli literature’s enduring and troubled preoccupation with the fate of the individual protagonist, bearing the burden of collective obligations that sometimes put him or her in mortal peril. In that regard, their kibbutz narratives encode what Omri Herzog cannily identiﬁes as the “deep structure” of Israeli literature, namely, the clash between individual desires and unyielding national imperatives, which forms the connective tissue of many of the works explored in the chapters to come. At times, these writers shrewdly measure the surprising distances, secrets, and lies between individuals in their claustrophobic society, raising the question of the authentic self. Complications they present to us with great ﬁdelity include protagonists who struggle with the stigma of some form of outsider status (ethnic or otherwise) deemed suspect by the insular elite or whose questioning of the collective mission or the national heroic ethos to which they are harnessed can prove self-alienating. Such urgent literary interventions are hardly surprising, given the extraordinary sacriﬁces the kibbutz has made in wartime, as well as its once potent role in the political sphere. And by placing some of the less familiar, antecedent works of writers such as Arthur Koestler, Meyer Levin, and David Maletz in conversation with more recent works by Eli Amir, Batya Gur, and Amos Oz, we can better gauge the extremely varied and\n\n18679-Omer-Sherman_Imagining.indd 15\n\n3/13/15 4:59 PM\n\n16\n\nimagining the kibbutz\n\nsometimes surprising nature of the responses to the challenges and contingencies addressed in the kibbutz literary imagination over a span of more than eighty years. Though by no means pretending to be exhaustive, Imagining the Kibbutz is the ﬁrst sustained study of imaginative portrayals of the kibbutz from its earliest decades to the present. Addressing both narratives by kibbutz “insiders” (including those born and raised there, as well as those who joined the kibbutz as immigrants or migrants from the city) and “outsiders” for whom the kibbutz is a crucial microcosm for understanding Israeli values and identity, this diachronic study addresses highly representative novels, short ﬁction, memoirs, and cinematic portrayals of the kibbutz in documentaries and in art as well as mainstream Israeli ﬁlms. Wherever possible, I based my study on narratives that are the product of direct experience and observation and were written quite close to the time portrayed. Above all, I sought to underscore the strikingly recurrent themes that resound from the 1930s to the contemporary era, especially the many conﬂicts between individualism and the collective ideal, which often present us with a microcosm of the anxieties at the heart of Israeli society. These are works for which those of us interested in the idea and reality of kibbutz (no matter what our disciplinary perspective) should be profoundly grateful, for they sift through the historical, emotional, and familial layers that have enriched it over time. In some narratives, ideological compromise gets a bad name, and in others, it proves redemptive. Yet there is also a kind of release in the fact that the messy jangle of kibbutz life and its processes is rarely idealized: kibbutz writers transcend the possibility of purity and remind us to acknowledge the inherent imperfection of the very best intentions even as we strive to achieve something greater. We see what is painful and shocking but also the undeniable blessings of collective living. And so often, in their most reverberating and morally imaginative moments, kibbutz narratives explore the urgent question of what individuals owe their society and what society owes them. Chapter 1 launches this study of richly conﬂicted literature by tracing the earliest literary portrayals of the kibbutz and related developments from the late 1930s to the early 1950s, beginning with a discussion of Meyer Levin’s 1931 novel Yehuda (the ﬁrst American account of Zionist communal life) as well as S. Yizhar’s very ﬁrst story, the novella Ephraim chozer le-asfeset (Ephraim Goes Back to Alfalfa; 1938). Here Yizhar (still one of Israel’s most revered writers) presents a romanticized view of a Negev kibbutz, leavened by a satirical edge that establishes the great theme that would grip later generations of writers: the conﬂict between exuberant, instinctual individuals and their virtuous, demand-\n\n18679-Omer-Sherman_Imagining.indd 16\n\n3/13/15 4:59 PM\n\nintroduction\n\n17\n\ning egalitarian society. Or, in David Aberbach’s memorable formulation, just “how does one become an individual while being ideologically bound, often painfully and nauseatingly, to strangers in a closed world from which there is little chance of escape?” From Yehuda and “Ephraim,” we turn to the secondearliest (and arguably most provocative) novel in the history of literature written in English about the kibbutz, the prickly semiautobiographical novel Thieves in the Night (1946) by Hungarian-British author Arthur Koestler. Set in the ﬁnal troubled years of the British Mandate, the novel juxtaposes the fervor of Jewish socialists with the increasing anger of the native Arab population of Palestine, creating a troubling connection between the dream of utopia and romanticized violence. This was the pioneering era of the “tower and stockade” settlements established in vulnerable territory, when the ever-mercurial Koestler was persuaded that Zionism should aspire to supplant rather than fulﬁll Judaism. In another novel of the 1940s, David Maletz’s Ma’agalot (Young Hearts; 1945), an altogether more reﬂective, even meditative work, the author weighs in with a diﬀerent perspective on the fate of Jewish continuity by raising the concern that the successful reestablishment of the Jew in the rhythms of agrarian life might bring about the demise of Jewish education and of selfdevelopment in other crucial realms. Maletz also sensitively explores the domination of the individual by the demanding pioneering society. Though written in the same period of rapidly escalating tensions as Koestler’s nearmartial manifesto, Young Hearts focuses our attention instead on the complexities of daily life within a total ideological system. Thus, chapter 1 not only highlights the crucial role of the frontier kibbutzim and the individual farmersoldier ideal in the Israeli imagination and public consciousness of the 1950s; it also draws critical attention to how some writers were more preoccupied by the struggle to create a life of meaning in the transition from traditional religious life to a thoroughly secular one during the rise of the political and cultural hegemony of the Labor Movement. Yet, above all, we come to appreciate the consolidation of the proud ethos, memorably captured by historian Zeev Drory: “The fundamental values of the kibbutz movement, on which its education methods were founded for many years, were socialism, the collective egalitarian way of life, work, volunteering, pioneering, and bearing the burden of national and societal missions. Security and defense have always been at the very heart of its ideology and endeavors. The dual symbols of the sickle and the sword have been intertwined since the founders’ generation” (186). Chapter 2 is devoted to the critical visions of Amos Oz, Nathan Shaham, and Avraham Balaban. Oz and Balaban are nearly of the same generation and are both former members of Kibbutz Hulda, whereas Shaham continues to live\n\n18679-Omer-Sherman_Imagining.indd 17\n\n3/13/15 4:59 PM\n\n18\n\nimagining the kibbutz\n\nin Kibbutz Beit Alfa, his home since 1945. Until a son’s severe asthma required relocating to the desert town of Arad in 1986, Oz thrived at Hulda, reportedly once telling his friend Balaban, who has a very diﬀerent take on his early years, that “for you the kibbutz was a nightmare, for me it was redemption” (qtd. in Lori). Oz’s short stories, essays, and novels from those years (Where the Jackals Howl; Elsewhere, Perhaps; A Perfect Peace) artfully probe the realization of egalitarian values amid the frail lives of maladjusted individuals and the idiosyncrasies of kibbutz society. In his later, post-kibbutz career, Oz’s critically acclaimed memoir, Sipur al ahava ve-hosheh (A Tale of Love and Darkness; 2002), partially illuminates his ﬂight at the age of ﬁfteen from his father’s home in Jerusalem to Kibbutz Hulda, diﬃculty adjusting as an outsider with an artist’s sensibility, and a recent collection of interconnected kibbutz stories, Be’in haverim (Between Friends; 2012), represents a signiﬁcant return to his earlier wellspring of inspiration (though where the pervasive tone in the earlier works was pugnaciously acerbic, this late work is gently melancholic in spirit). A recipient of the Israel Prize for Hebrew Literature and Poetry, Shaham served three terms as kibbutz secretary, and his Kirot etz dakim (The Other Side of the Wall; 1977) exhibits a deep and lively insider’s knowledge of myriad aspects of kibbutz life from the Palmach era to the present. Shaham also oﬀers us a rare glimpse of a kibbutznik struggling to cope when fate plunges him into an unexpectedly prolonged and unpleasant immersion in American capitalism (and the inner demons it arouses). The ﬁnal work addressed in chapter 2, Balaban’s Shiv’ah (Mourning a Father Lost: A Kibbutz Childhood Remembered; 2000), castigates the communal child-rearing system in which he was raised for having created adults who “evince the selﬁshness of people who never got enough protection and security.” Later chapters turn to “outsider” works by Atallah Mansour (In A New Light), Eli Amir (Scapegoat), Batya Gur (Murder on a Kibbutz), and Savyon Liebrecht (“Kibbutz”), none of whom lived for periods of signiﬁcant duration in the kibbutz yet whose probing works nonetheless oﬀer exceptionally penetrating and empathic considerations of both the trauma of childhood and the marginalization and mistreatment of outsiders. In chapter 3, we encounter contentious issues of ethnicity and national identity still festering in Israel today. One would think that Mansour’s B’or hadash (In a New Light; 1966) would be of exceptional interest as the ﬁrst novel written in Hebrew by an Arab citizen of Israel, but today it is largely forgotten. Born and raised in Palestine, Mansour lived on Kibbutz Sha’ar Ha’amakin, in northern Israel, from 1951 to 1952, and his vibrant novel, characterized by rich use of Hebrew slang (in those days still comparatively rare in Hebrew literature), vividly captures\n\n18679-Omer-Sherman_Imagining.indd 18\n\n3/13/15 4:59 PM\n\nintroduction\n\n19\n\nthe fervent ideological debates that raged within the kibbutz as well as its role in national politics, all through the ironic gaze of an Arab “passing” as a native Jewish Israeli. Israel is, of course, a nation built on waves of immigrants, but only rarely has that history been examined in relation to the kibbutz movement, which is one reason to be grateful for Eli Amir’s Tarnegol kaparot (Scapegoat; 1983). A best seller in Israel, adapted for the stage as well as Israeli television, the novel is little known elsewhere in spite of its availability in a lively English translation. And that is regrettable because Scapegoat is one of the most heartfelt, thoroughly compelling, and often quite hilarious coming-of-age stories in the entire Israeli literary canon. With great psychological depth and insight, this picaresque novel provides a fascinating window into the cultural upheaval experienced by immigrant youngsters from Iraq and North Africa as they struggled to adapt to kibbutz socialism, leaving their parents behind in the ma’abarot, or immigrant transit camps. The chapter’s analysis centers on how Amir’s protagonist and his friends, hailing from traditional societies in Arab countries, are torn between traditional family frameworks and the demands that they conform to communal lifestyles that seem wholly aberrant to them. We also glimpse how their families were utterly dismayed by what they regarded as a condescending secular community’s relentless hostility to faith and tradition, by the opposition to private ownership, and by the degrading life of manual laborers, which their sons and daughters were supposed to embrace. Poignantly, both Mansour’s and Amir’s novels conclude with their beleaguered protagonists still struggling to straddle two worlds, eyeing their futures warily. Chapter 4 considers the breakdown of values in the traditional kibbutz as portrayed in two deeply empathic works by two of Israel’s most popular women writers (intriguingly, both were born to Holocaust survivors around the time of Israel’s own birth). Though perhaps never previously considered alongside one another, the two narratives of Savyon Liebrecht (b. 1948) and Batya Gur (1947–2005) are both highly attuned to Israel’s political, social, and economic problems, especially to the marginalized and vulnerable in Israeli society, those struggling against ethnic discrimination, poverty, unemployment, and disability. Aside from these congruencies, both of these probing works (Gur’s detective novel Murder on a Kibbutz and Liebrecht’s psychological suspense story “Kibbutz”) happen to feature strong female characters and to sensitively delineate the travails of new immigrants. Chapter 5 considers classics of Israeli cinema such as Yitzhak Yeshurun’s Noa bat sheva-esrei (Noa at Seventeen; 1982), Akiva Tevet’s Atalia (1984), and Dror\n\n18679-Omer-Sherman_Imagining.indd 19\n\n3/13/15 4:59 PM\n\n20\n\nimagining the kibbutz\n\nShaul’s highly controversial and semiautobiographical Adama meshuga’at (Sweet Mud; 2006), a production that presents a starkly unsentimental view (as Gur and Liebrecht do) of kibbutz childhood and the collective’s sometimes callous treatment of vulnerable individuals. The chapter goes on to explore exemplars drawn from personal documentary ﬁlm and video art. Portraying important moments of crisis in individual lives and kibbutzim, they also mirror larger concerns and trends in Israeli society. For instance, set in 1951, Noa at Seventeen is both a gripping story of a young girl’s adolescent disillusionment with the unquestioning collectivism of her friends and an incisive chronicle of the young state’s ideological struggles, indelibly portraying the wrenching and sometimes violent conﬂict between the individual and the collective that was such a critical dynamic in the early years of the state, often forgotten today. The tense atmosphere Yeshurun creates is a faithful portrayal of the crisis of Israeli socialism in response to the Soviet Union’s aggression and brutality on the eve of the Korean War, which ultimately shattered families and led to the breakup of a number of kibbutzim. Because Russia was both the ideological inspiration and country of origin of numerous kibbutzniks, they found it painful to relinquish their loyalty to the Soviet cause (many were still inspired by the heroic Red Army’s struggle against Hitler and revered the Soviet Union as their “second homeland”), long after others became disillusioned by its social and economic failures. Noa, the ﬁlm’s heroine, wakes up to her own prickly individuality exactly when those around her demand unﬂinching loyalty to their cause. In contrast to Yeshurun’s reconsideration of the ideological wars of Israel’s early years, Jonathan Paz’s ﬁlm Eskimosim ba Galil (The Galilee Eskimos; 2006; screenplay by Joshua Sobol) examines the decay of socialism in the contemporary kibbutz through a more nostalgic lens. A popular commercial movie that played at ﬁlm festivals across the globe, it depicts a band of senior citizens who, wakening one day to ﬁnd that the younger generation have sold the home they pioneered in the Galilee to a group of businessmen, struggle to rebuild their community and to defend their values against a greedy capitalist society that dismisses them as wholly anachronistic. Juxtaposing humorous and elegiac incidents, Paz makes a surprisingly resonant statement about the fate of ideology, while compassionately preserving the dignity and humanity of the nearly forgotten veterans who make a last, quixotic stand to preserve their dream. Paz’s warm and evocative portrayal memorializes the culmination of a historical process pithily summarized by Anita Shapira: “The bond to the kibbutz was no longer preserved by ideology, which had collapsed, but by inertia and a sense of belonging [only] to place and family” (“Kibbutz and the State”). After\n\n18679-Omer-Sherman_Imagining.indd 20\n\n3/13/15 4:59 PM\n\nintroduction\n\n21\n\nconsidering the recent outpouring of critically acclaimed documentaries that reexamine the kibbutz movement in the light of new controversies over the much-vaunted institution of “children’s houses” (or “children’s homes”) as well as the recent trauma of privatization, chapter 5 concludes with an appreciation of the melancholic vision permeating the poetic art videos of Oded Hirsch, a native son of Kibbutz Aﬁkim. Sadly, though their works continue to alert us to alternative ways of being, when it comes to the sense of literary vocation and purpose of kibbutz writers themselves, they felt their status within the community markedly deteriorate under the onslaught of unprecedented economic stresses and social transformations as early as 1987, when even prestigious kibbutz writers such as Nathan Shaham began to speak nostalgically of the past and uneasily about current trends: “There was a time when kibbutz society believed that literature was a sort of service to the society. It was thought that writers had an extraordinary capacity to beneﬁt the society, and they had a hard time because of this exaggerated demand. Today, there is a certain indiﬀerence to the ability of literature to make a mark or to change anything in kibbutz society” (Rosenfeld 168). Shaham came from a generation of ﬁerce dedication, for whom anything less meant living inauthentically in the world. Also responding to queries from Shdemot, writer Aliza Amir-Zohar spoke even more pessimistically about the ground shifting beneath her amid the fading values caused by economic duress and idealistic exhaustion: When matters of spirit and creativity, art and culture, held higher priority, every kibbutz was blessed with people who were creative in this area. It wasn’t a question of whether or not they were given days [to practice their art] but rather that the society attached great signiﬁcance to these things. Today—I don’t know. There is no doubt that the order of priorities, the scale of values in the kibbutz, has been reversed. . . . Today you can ﬁnd kibbutzim whose ﬁrst step in dealing with the adversity is to abolish the poets’ and the artists’ and the writers’ work days, because these things are perceived as superﬂuous when people are struggling for their existence. I say this in anger, with regret, and can no longer say that kibbutz society appreciates its writers and artists. I am very fearful of this process. (Rosenfeld 169) In retrospect, Amir-Zohar’s misgivings now seem prophetic. For, in spite of many who once viewed commitment to a life in the kibbutz as almost monastic-\n\n18679-Omer-Sherman_Imagining.indd 21\n\n3/13/15 4:59 PM\n\n22\n\nimagining the kibbutz\n\nlike in its demanding rigor (most notably, other literary writers addressed in this study), its ideological tenets have collapsed under deteriorating economic conditions. As researchers Richard Sosis and Bradley Ruﬄe pointed out in 2004: “Until a decade ago many kibbutz members would have considered the Marxist proposition ‘From each according to his ability, to each according to his need’ to be ‘sacred,’ in other words, beyond question. However, . . . as the economic situation on the kibbutzim has worsened, many kibbutzniks have challenged and ultimately rejected this fundamental proposition of kibbutz life, as evidenced by their decision to privatize their kibbutzim” (112). In place of the old communal and egalitarian forms of economic and social governance, privatization (hafrata) led to the rapid (and some might say hasty) reclassiﬁcation of the kibbutz, to kibbutzim that are today little more than suburbs where the members receive diﬀerential salaries and to a number that retain the old communal forms, with some variations. Perhaps the most regrettable aspect of privatization is that, even though a degree of economic support is provided to those struggling within the new kibbutz economy, this is now understood as a form of charity rather than the mutual social welfare that once encompassed everyone and won the admiration of the world. It is no exaggeration to say that for many of us, the once unthinkable has come to pass. And yet hope remains. Accordingly, my afterword turns to how many of the anxieties embodied in kibbutz narratives anticipate the present moment of a crisis that continues to fuel heated debates within the kibbutz movement in the aftermath of hafrata. In what amounts to a coda to the earlier chapters, the afterword considers these debates as examined both by novelists and poets and by kibbutz sociologists, taking heed of their arguments to present the fate of the kibbutz as an open, enduring, and urgent inquiry into the meaning of both collective and individual responsibility, of what has already transpired and what might yet be.\n\n18679-Omer-Sherman_Imagining.indd 22\n\n3/13/15 4:59 PM\n\n1 Trepidation and Exultation in Early Kibbutz Fiction\n\nFor Meir Avrahami the movement is all. Without it he ceases to exist. He is prepared to put up with anything, be it work that is not to his liking or the company of people he does not respect, as long as it helps to ﬁll the ranks. His tastes are simple and his clothes look neglected and he does not pay attention to mealtimes, and the resigned smile of a beatiﬁc monk spreads over his face as they tell him that the boiler has exploded and there is no hot water in the shower. —Nathan Shaham Such is kibbutz: pretentious, obstinate, exposed and revealing, of variegated designs and textures, of special and original human relationships, of expectations and disappointments, pleasure and pain, rejoicing and sadness, togetherness and aloneness, liberty and conﬁnement. . . . Come, let’s examine what truly lies behind all this. —Dan Shavit\n\nGiven the imposing inﬂuence of the kibbutz in the fashioning of Israeli identity, it should come as little surprise that it has also been a pervasive and provocative presence in the formation of Israel’s literary and, more recently, cinematic culture. As Jo-Ann Mort and Gary Brenner observe: “Until the end of the 1970s, most Israelis knew someone on a kibbutz. If you weren’t a kibbutznik yourself, you had family on a kibbutz that you visited on holidays; or maybe your parents sent you to spend the summer holiday with the kibbutz cousins. And young people in the city were sent to the youth movements with the possibility of going through the IDF [Israel Defense Forces] Nahal (agricultural settlement corps) and eventually becoming a kibbutz member” (14). Yet strikingly little attention has been paid to the fact that so many of Israel’s\n\n18679-Omer-Sherman_Imagining.indd 23\n\n3/13/15 4:59 PM\n\n24\n\nimagining the kibbutz\n\nfounding writers were raised or otherwise spent a signiﬁcant number of their formative years on a kibbutz. Though two decades transpired from the founding of the earliest communal settlements to the publication of the ﬁrst kibbutz novels, the independent and often skeptical voices of writers have been an energetic presence in Israeli literature. Many of their works are notable for their moral seriousness, intellectual depth, and exciting candor about the gains and losses incurred by one of the most genuinely revolutionary achievements of the Zionist Movement. Still, why should the fact that the kibbutz inevitably entered the Israeli literary imagination really matter, no matter how robust its presence? It matters precisely because reading the literature of the kibbutz can bring us profound insights into how ideology responded to historical contingency in diﬀerent periods of Israel’s history, to the tensions between the aspirations of the individual and the collective and between the Zionist socialist revolution and the Jewish Diaspora. To cite Bernard Horn, this phenomenon “would not matter much if Israeli literature were an ‘art for art’s sake’ sort of literature in which society is either irrelevant or viewed exclusively as an impediment to the full realization of an individual’s potential. But the contrary is the case for Israeli literature, which began and for the most part continues to be an engaged literature, a literature of allegory and advocacy in which the Jewish vicissitudes of Jewish identity in the Diaspora and Israel play an important role” (190). More than most other modern literatures, Hebrew ﬁction is tightly entwined with national and historical developments, and the pivotal role of the kibbutz within that realm merits far greater attention. Indeed, Hebrew literature has much to reveal about the ideological construction of a new society, for, as historian Derek Penslar remarks, the kibbutz “has been one of the hallmarks of the Zionist project, and although it appears to have reached its end as a generative and innovative force within Israeli society, the kibbutz’s historical grandeur and signiﬁcance remain unquestionable” (7). Nor does the literature of the kibbutz show any sign of waning. This study addresses how some of its major themes (national identity, the clash between collectivism and individuality, otherness and discrimination, estrangement and alienation) have endured with surprising force as the steadfast concerns of the conscientious kibbutz writer. This is a literature of values, but one that has also reﬂected the troubled psyches of ﬂawed strivers, the blemishes of the human condition as a whole. For anyone who wonders just how a pastoral community like the kibbutz could contain the dramatic or even tragic ingredients that might instill the dark vision of life that many believe is essential to great literature, one need only look more closely at the extraordinary human costs and sacriﬁces involved\n\n18679-Omer-Sherman_Imagining.indd 24\n\n3/13/15 4:59 PM\n\ntrepidation and exultation\n\n25\n\nin the kibbutz’s birth, growth, and decay. Assaf Inbari (b. 1968; raised on Kibbutz Aﬁkim) astutely describes the scale of that tumultuously epic history: Those who describe the pioneering period, or the early years of the state, under the leadership of Ben-Gurion, as a time of conﬁdence and rejoicing simply ignore its terrible aspects. Internal and external conﬂicts, resounding failures, longing for parents or country of origin, waves of emigration, suicides, and the death of youth and children from all kinds of diseases always accompanied the activities of settlement and creation. The pogroms of the early twentieth century were among the childhood memories of many of the pioneers. Many veteran kibbutz members were, and still are, Holocaust survivors. About three thousand kibbutzniks fell in the wars and left, on every kibbutz, numerous bereaved parents and siblings, widows and orphans. The schism of the United Kibbutz Movement in the early 1950s was a terrible crisis in the lives of thousands of kibbutzniks and their children. The division of the labor movement in the 1960s, as a result of the furious abdication of Ben-Gurion, and the establishment of Raﬁ; the downfall of the Labor Party in the 1970s following the Yom Kippur War, until its defeat in 1977; the collapse of the stock exchange in the 1980s, which caused the economic breakdown of many kibbutzim and the consequent “kibbutzim settlement,” which led to the privatization agonies of most kibbutzim during the last twenty years—all these painful events and processes have been no less central and critical in the lives of the kibbutzniks than the joyous ones of settlement, building, and growth. (“Kibbutz Novel” 143) Inbari’s own gripping novel, Ha-baita (Home; 2009), which draws with great skill from memoirs, letters, minutes of meetings, and other ephemera to relate the rise and fall of a kibbutz, was published to rapturous critical acclaim and spent ten months on the Israeli best-seller list. For the most part, the narratives I address, though resolutely avoiding the distortions of nostalgic sentiment, evince a profound regard for the kibbutz’s extraordinary achievements and daring in wartime sacriﬁce, communal innovation, cultural creativity and resilience, agricultural achievement, and what Yehudah Mirsky rightly hails as its “sheer stubborn life force.” Indeed, although one might suppose that the kibbutz writer’s frame of reference and themes would necessarily be quite provincial, Elisha Porat (poet, novelist, and founder of Kibbutz Ein Hahoresh) seems representative of many of his contemporaries in delineating how:\n\n18679-Omer-Sherman_Imagining.indd 25\n\n3/13/15 4:59 PM\n\n26\n\nimagining the kibbutz\n\nin the kibbutz there is a little of everything. It can be seen as a drop in the ocean, and it can be seen as a small universe, and I see it as a completely unlimited arena for all possible human events. I consider it above all as my birthplace: I was born here; I know every plot of land, every local story, every bit of its history. To me, the important thing is that it is a small village with which I am very familiar, which by way of artistic association can be turned into an arena for all the struggles in the world. (Rosenfeld 166) An “arena for all the struggles in the world” seems altogether apt, for who didn’t long to join a kibbutz in its glory days? Even the young centaur, the fantastical protagonist of Moacyr Scliar’s 1980 Portuguese masterpiece O centauro no jardim (The Centaur in the Garden), longs to live that life, if he isn’t ﬁrst killed in heroic battle ﬁghting for Israel’s independence. We overhear him musing in 1947 (still the golden age of kibbutz socialism) that “I would be very useful there. I who knew farm life so well. I would be a dedicated worker, and the other members of the kibbutz would end up accepting me; in a new society there is room for everyone, even someone with horse’s hooves” (Centaur 45). Alongside Scliar’s improbable hero, whose condition brilliantly embodies the modern human vicissitudes of alienation and an impossible duality, it is worth noting that even B’or hadash (In a New Light; 1966) by Atallah Mansour (b. 1934), the very ﬁrst Hebrew novel written by a Palestinian Israeli, memorably scrutinizes the kibbutz’s willingness to live by its own values through the eyes of a lonely outsider. In the mid-1980s, novelist Dan Shavit (b. 1944, Kibbutz Kfar Szold), contemplating the value of the growing literary canon of the kibbutz, seemed to ﬁnd the greatest merit in that body’s capacity to assess the distance between reality and the piety of ideology: Such is kibbutz: pretentious, obstinate, exposed and revealing, of variegated designs and textures, of special and original human relationships, of expectations and disappointments, pleasure and pain, rejoicing and sadness, togetherness and alone-ness, liberty and conﬁnement. . . . The average person tends to be attached to somewhat shallow formulas, superﬁciality, false beliefs, and the author responds stubbornly: Come, let’s examine what truly lies behind all this. Has, indeed, reality caught up with the dream, or does it, perhaps, lag behind permitting a “critical distance” for the ﬂourishing of the counterfeit, the hypocritical, the admis-\n\n18679-Omer-Sherman_Imagining.indd 26\n\n3/13/15 4:59 PM\n\ntrepidation and exultation\n\n27\n\nsible falsehood. If this is the mission of the writer everywhere, then even more so in the kibbutz because of its pretentions to values and ethics. (4) Although the canon of kibbutz literature and art has always been one of sharp contrasts stubbornly aﬃrming the perseverance of ethics and communal solidarity, today most artistic accounts of the kibbutz vision and the fate of kibbutz values are far from sanguine. For instance, critically acclaimed Israeli video artist Oded Hirsch insists that “it’s a little trite to keep talking about the shattering of the kibbutz dream. . . . I see it as a dream that was solidiﬁed in the early part of the last century. The update it is currently receiving won’t last. The kibbutzim have become construction sites. Retirees take mortgages and expand their apartments, but their children live in New York or Tel Aviv and won’t come back” (Karpel). How did we arrive at this juncture? In very recent years, there have been numerous obituaries and “postlapsarian” descriptions of the kibbutz’s declining position in Israeli consciousness. Karen Grumberg succinctly and lucidly highlights just what has transpired: “The morally upstanding image of the kibbutz has been tarnished . . . by revelations of systematic gender and ethnic discrimination, by disillusioned exkibbutzniks who remember with horror such experiences as the collective children’s house, and by the economic disintegration of the kibbutz institution itself” (Place and Ideology 38). Alongside Grumberg’s recent assessment (shared by many others), when we examine the entire trajectory of the kibbutz narrative closely, we uncover an early skepticism, directed toward even that most hallowed of collective institutions, the children’s house. For instance, in David Maletz’s novel Ma’agalot (Young Hearts; 1945), the omniscient narrator strikes a circumspect tone in describing the unintentionally competitive dynamics of collective child rearing, even in the infants’ home: The infant brought to a collective home has an entirely diﬀerent set of experiences from the child born into a family. For one thing, he does not come alone. Another infant has come just before him and still another is brought in the following day. His crib stands in a line of identical cribs. From his very ﬁrst day he is in “society” and runs into social competition. To his parents he may seem the acme of perfection, but here in the home his personality is not outstanding. He is surrounded by other little personalities. . . . So far as the staﬀ . . . is concerned, he is only one of many and he must win his place in life either by his unusual character or simply by force of arms and legs. (Young Hearts 226)\n\n18679-Omer-Sherman_Imagining.indd 27\n\n3/13/15 4:59 PM\n\n28\n\nimagining the kibbutz\n\nThat hint of anxiety about the inherent aggression in the most innocent forms of collective life may surprise many who might imagine that, from the beginning, it was a sacred tenet of kibbutz society that was never challenged from within, at least not in the early years. Nevertheless, a sense of caution and uncertainty about utopia’s hubris is palpable in Maletz’s language. Though the kibbutz commitment to strict equality through the socialization of its children in communal education may now seem to many a peculiar excess of twentieth-century socialism, that process might also with considerable justiﬁcation be considered the fulﬁllment of a far more ancient dream of humanity that Joshua Muravchik notes can be traced back to Plato’s imaginary republic. For Plato, the “Guardians” could overcome selﬁsh inclinations by raising their children in common, in ignorance of who was biologically one’s own (166); the children so raised, Muravchik tells us, “will not rend the community asunder by each applying that word ‘mine’ to diﬀerent things and dragging oﬀ whatever he can get for himself into a private home, where he will have his separate family, forming a centre of exclusive joys and sorrows. Rather they will all, so far as may be, feel together and aim at the same ends, because they are convinced that all their interests are identical. . . . They will be free of those quarrels that arise from ownership of property and from having family ties” (331). As explained by Muravchik, Plato’s hope is echoed in the rhetoric of the kibbutz movement’s own guiding prophets. In bearing the burden of that ancient hope, however, “despite optimal conditions” that endured “seventy years,” even those raised in socialism were somehow insufﬁciently “imbued with communal and egalitarian values” (D. Gavron 158). The kibbutz system began to collapse in the 1970s when a small number of kibbutzim began to make the transition to family sleeping. That ripple eventually became a tidal wave. Signiﬁcantly, there is an emergent critical discourse that, according to Rachel Elboim-Dror, expresses “a new and important dimension: the subjective and ﬁrst-hand experiences of utopia’s children, as viewed from their present, mature and adult perspective” (Review 158). Indeed, a number of narratives exemplify this transformative trend. Salient examples from the ﬁrst decade of the new century include Avraham Balaban’s wrenching memoir Mourning a Father Lost: A Kibbutz Childhood Remembered, the quasi-autobiographical ﬁlm Sweet Mud, and Ran Tal’s documentary ﬁlm Children of the Sun; each embodies this late and frequently pessimistic inquiry. Yet these later works are not really radical departures from the creative engagements of the past at all. Indeed, a chief goal of this book is to demonstrate that the literature of the kibbutz, even\n\n18679-Omer-Sherman_Imagining.indd 28\n\n3/13/15 4:59 PM\n\ntrepidation and exultation\n\n29\n\nin its relatively early years, sought not to reinforce collective kibbutz values but rather to raise complex and challenging questions, perhaps even to play an unexpectedly subversive role. But, most crucially, what emerges even in the more dystopian portrayals of the kibbutz is at least a grudging respect for what was attempted. Yehudah Mirsky argues that, “though the classical kibbutz foundered on the laws of economics, in both its successes and its failures it bequeathed a larger and richer sense of human possibility. And while its arrangements ran counter to certain basic human needs, they did answer to another need—the need, as Martin Buber put it, ‘of man to feel his own house as a room in some greater, all-embracing structure in which he is at home, to feel that the other inhabitants of it with whom he lives and works are all acknowledging and conﬁrming his individual existence.’” The writers who themselves participated in enacting that visionary “all-embracing structure” have witnessed its achievement and eventual decline, often in gripping language and extraordinary storytelling endowed with undeniable verisimilitude. It beﬁts us to note, however, that literature, like the other arts, was not initially encouraged in the kibbutzim. Reﬂecting that earlier historical reality, in Nathan Shaham’s novella “Kirot etz dakim” (“The Other Side of the Wall,” the title story of the 1977 collection by that name, set in the early 1940s), the kibbutznik Theo is outraged by what he ﬁnds in a book of poetry, even though it is published by his movement’s own publishing house: “Th is decadent poetry . . . has no connection with the lives of working people . . . bears no relationship to the values of Labor Israel. . . . These bourgeois diversions are published by a house that exists oﬀ the savings of people who are breaking their backs and living on bread and water. There is something wrong here” (Other Side 163). He condemns the tropes of literary language—“metaphors, analogies, personiﬁcations” are “wasteful, confusing games”; they distract from the urgent reality of the collective mission: “To bring forth bread with honor; to rule over nature; to create clear, unambiguous, linear, perpendicular, cut-anddried linguistic tools. To build anew that tower that was destroyed. To take the building stones and lay them out, each in its place. To grab people by the scruﬀ of the neck and say here is electricity, here is manpower, horsepower, productivity, seeds, nails, ideas” (164). In her admirable study of the movement’s formative years, Shula Keshet identiﬁes the cause for literature’s near-absence in the ﬁrst two decades of the new utopia; the terms of her analysis are strikingly similar to the rhetoric of Shaham’s ﬁctional character. Keshet recalls how A. D. Gordon, the movement’s most illustrious ideologue, heartily advocated against literary expression throughout the entire Yishuv:\n\n18679-Omer-Sherman_Imagining.indd 29\n\n3/13/15 4:59 PM\n\n30\n\nimagining the kibbutz\n\nIn its ﬁrst steps, the settlement enterprise swept up the kibbutz members and imbued them, ﬁrst and foremost, with endeavor, hard physical labor, mainly on the land. Literary-artistic writing written by professional writers was rejected and halted. . . . The opinion became rooted in Hebrew critique that the Eretz Yisrael reality did not yet possess permanence and typiﬁcation, and thus could not serve as a model for literary writing. . . . A. D. Gordon’s demand from writers was . . . stringent: he thought that the transition to “right living,” undetached from the land, from nature, demanded man’s all and that only when individuals redeem themselves and become whole people, their work would in any case become living work. Gordon accused the Hebrew writers who did not physically take part in the new life of pioneering of having a sterile “aesthetic” approach and demanded that they ﬁrst of all invest all their eﬀorts in creating life itself. In his view, even Bialik’s work did not pass the test. “If Bialik were here,” Gordon dared to say, “working and living a life of labor and nature and seeing life purely as a life of work . . . and sing us the song of labor and the life of labor, then I would now give all his poems for that.” (“Freedom” 196) In the days when the devotees of the religion of labor sought to create the New Hebrew, the writer was associated with the enervated Diaspora. This prevailing ethos “drove kibbutz writers into silence, or at best to writing in secret, in stolen hours, just before dawn before going out to work in the ﬁelds. . . . Only after many years of paralysis of their creative power and their voluntary inhibition did some dare to critically address the early days” (“Freedom” 197). Even in Maletz’s inﬂuential novel of 1945, Ma’agalot (Young Hearts), there are long swaths of prose in which the author seems to aspire to prove himself a Gordonian acolyte. Thus the protagonist, Menahem, on a wagon ride with his companions home from the ﬁelds, drifts in his reveries between love of community, Eros, and, most important, a feverish ardor for the countryside, all of which blurs and coheres in a glorious whole, emanating from the miracle of collective life and agrarian labor: Silently they watched the peaceful rain descending over the entire landscape. Someone began to sing, but the rest merely listened. Menahem sat wedged between the others. He felt that the warm rain was softening the people as well as the soil, softening and fusing them together. The rain touching them spread a pleasant sense of comfort and contentment through their bodies. Menahem became aware of invis-\n\n18679-Omer-Sherman_Imagining.indd 30\n\n3/13/15 4:59 PM\n\ntrepidation and exultation\n\n31\n\nible but nonetheless powerful bonds uniting the people who together toiled on this land; his heart overﬂowed with great tenderness for all of them. As during his ﬁrst days with Hannah [his wife] he felt an urge to declare his love to everyone and to the entire landscape. “And I have betrothed thee forever.” . . . He realized that he had struck deep roots into this soil and this society. The knowledge ﬁ lled him with gladness. (Young Hearts 164) For the halutzim, working the land symbolized the rebirth of both the individual and an entire people. As Donna Rosenthal points out, the halutzim found special signiﬁcance in the fact that “the Hebrew word for man, adam, is derived from adama, Hebrew for land. They took Hebrew names like Barak (lightning), Tamir (towering), and Oz (strength) or agricultural names like Karmi (of the vineyard) and Dagan (corn); the new names were symbols of a personal and collective rebirth” (103). Still, even in their most rhapsodic portrayals, what Maletz and other early writers seemed to recognize (whether driven into silence or not) was that, no matter how noble the kibbutz’s mission, it would never be more than an imperfect veneer for the human frailties that composed its secret life. Nonetheless, the writers struggled mightily to aﬃrm the kibbutz’s positive aspects, often siding with the collective against the disgruntled individual. By and large, the literature of the early period steadfastly served to uphold the polemical goals of both Zionism and socialism, forging an indissoluble link between them. In her brief survey of kibbutz narratives from that time, Iris Milner describes how these strategically establish the kibbutz as a place of a total realization of the Zionist agenda of fostering the collective over the private sphere, which is a crucial move in the formation of the collective, national identity and a crucial aspect of Socialist Zionism. Indeed, the constitution of a “collective family” in place of the private one—a change which this literature is deeply committed to portraying—represents the twofold ideological rebellion of Socialist Zionism against both Capitalism (represented by the traditional bourgeois family) and Diasporic Judaism (represented by the traditional religious Jewish family). (161) Though, in our own time, we have witnessed the nearly complete transformation of Israeli society by the economic forces of neoliberal capitalism and privatization and by the overpowering demographic and political dominance\n\n18679-Omer-Sherman_Imagining.indd 31\n\n3/13/15 4:59 PM\n\n32\n\nimagining the kibbutz\n\nof the Haredi (ultra-Orthodox), kibbutz ideology once shaped Israel’s national structures as well as its symbolic and mythic systems in myriad ways. Beginning in the 1920s, Milner identiﬁes “a wide corpus of prose ﬁction in which kibbutz life and ideology were a central issue. . . . These works accompanied the formation of the idea of communal life in the land of Israel, observed its initial practical applications, and testiﬁed to its growing role in the Israeli nation-building process.” Yet, from the very beginning, this imaginative literature immediately “also gave voice to some problematic aspects of this revolutionary ideology and explored its limits. . . . Literary representations became an important virtual site where critical reﬂections on the beneﬁts of the Zionist ethos, particularly in its [dominant] socialist version . . . were expressed” (159). Milner regards the earliest kibbutz narrators as already anticipating the “turbulent struggle for more pluralistic and democratic approaches to collective interests and goals” that beset the movement in its later years of development (161). Moreover, whereas skepticism rarely surfaced in the portrayals of communal life found in the visual arts of the 1920s and 1930s, Milner ﬁnds strong evidence of critical doubt and questioning in literary narratives of the time. At a 1986 symposium of kibbutz writers held by the Kibbutz Artzi Movement, the movement reported having found 222 creative writer members, 370 members occupied with “documentary, scientiﬁc, philosophical literature,” and roughly a thousand other members active as musicians, dancers, choreographers, stage directors, as well as a range of visual and other artists in its ranks (Ring 150). Yet, at the same gathering, poet Mira Meir (b. 1932) of Kibbutz Nachshon, alluding to an entire generation of “technologists, economists, computer operators,” warned that very few of the children raised on the kibbutz had any viable connection to the humanities (Ring 161). It is easy to see how such a utilitarian identity had taken hold. Indeed, as Grumberg argues, it would be hard to exaggerate the essential role that kibbutz society played in the Zionist drama of settlement, the self-realization of the Jewish laborer, and the birth of an enduring myth that remains popular in spite of the atrophy of later days: As the fertile breeding ground of Israel’s mythical native sons, the Sabras, the kibbutz holds a special place in the national consciousness. Promoting idealism, brotherhood, collectivity, and social justice, the kibbutz founders and residents (called haverim, or comrades) oversaw the creation of settlements that were as self-reliant as possible. . . . The mythical value attached to the kibbutz remains forceful in Israel. . . . Part of the reason for this is that the idea of the kibbutz precedes the creation of the state by\n\n18679-Omer-Sherman_Imagining.indd 32\n\n3/13/15 4:59 PM\n\ntrepidation and exultation\n\n33\n\nalmost half a century, and is thus associated strongly with the roughhewn ethos of the halutzim, pioneers, who established the ﬁrst kibbutzim in harsh conditions. This pioneering ethic constituted the initial expression of the desire to be close to the land, and to exorcise the studious and religious “Old Jew.” . . . The kibbutz became a greenhouse for the cultivation of the New Jew and indeed of Israeli identity, the exemplar of the Jewish State that was being shaped, which would be characterized by a self-suﬃcient, principled collective existence. (Place and Ideology 37–38) The inside testimony of generations of kibbutz artists lends even greater depth and complexity to that historical record. Given the circumstances Grumberg outlines, it is not surprising that, even when literature gained a modicum of respect within the kibbutz movement, it was invariably assigned a highly restricted pedagogical mission, one that excluded ambivalence, skepticism, interiority, or just about any of the psychological dynamics most of us would associate with modern literature. The imagination was to be placed in service to Jewish destiny. The famous Holocaust writer Jakov Lind spent four unhappy years in Palestine immediately after the war. In his autobiography, Lind wrote scornfully of the diminished role for literature and the visual arts that he found in the life of the pioneer, who “was a culture consumer (at its best). The aims of his culture and its achievements seemed very provincial to me. ‘For the decorations of the dining hall, for this we need a painter?[,’ he would say. ‘]Or to write a poem for the next anniversary of the founding of the kibbutz, for this one needs a poet, chaver?’ The entire ‘cultural air,’ like in all small countries, in all provinces, was to entertain and to decorate only” (139). In compelling detail, Keshet explains how narrative art in the society that Lind despaired of was to have only one mission, “the mission of inﬂuencing and shaping the life of the entire generation, of becoming a lever for the greater needs of Eretz Yisrael reality, and contending with shaping the image of a new societal type . . . a unique synthesis of intellectual and farmer. . . . This ideological-didactical demand . . . called upon writers to keep any conﬂict quiet, ignore the psychological schism, and focus on ‘externalized’ descriptions of the wilderness” (“Freedom” 200). Even the unpleasant realities of their heroic struggle— “malaria . . . poverty . . . hard physical labor under the burning sun” (201)— were beyond the scope of this austere mission. Rather than celebrate the individual voice of the writer’s struggle with oppressive circumstances, “the total identiﬁcation of the individual with the aims of the community” was to be stressed (201). It helps to brieﬂy consider the didactic nature of the earliest\n\n18679-Omer-Sherman_Imagining.indd 33\n\n3/13/15 4:59 PM\n\n34\n\nimagining the kibbutz\n\nforays of the kibbutz narrative, a genre unique to its time, which Keshet argues sought to “heal the rift between the Jew and the world” (“Freedom” 201). For example, Shlomo Reichenstein’s novel Raishit (Beginnings; 1943), one of only three kibbutz novels written in Hebrew in the 1940s, is wholly devoted to the conquest of the land and the rhythms of agricultural life; its plot culminates in the “big ceremony” of the kibbutz’s ﬁrst harvest festival. The main theme of Beginnings, the sanctiﬁcation of labor, is craftily embodied in the title: “the re-creation of the world out of chaos, the creation of paradise on earth. . . . The secular pioneer has become a god on earth, and his deeds are praised in religious language” (Keshet, “Freedom” 202). In later years, the unbroken harmony of the New Hebrew taking root in the soil would be parodied to memorable eﬀect by writers such as Amos Oz, whose young Sabra warrior-farmer in Menuhah nehonah (A Perfect Peace; 1982) spends much of the novel dreaming of being elsewhere, and whose earliest stories included a protagonist gruesomely sacriﬁced by his demanding kibbutz father. Obviously critical to this mission of forming the New Jew was the ﬁrst generation; in that context, Yael Darr oﬀers a fascinating account of the literature on which these children were nurtured, in picture books usually written by educators who were members of the Kibbutz Education Committee (representing the major kibbutz movements): The children’s story as told by the founding generation usually revolved around the gloriﬁcation of the kibbutz way of life, depicting kibbutz childhood as the embodiment of heaven on earth. When a city-dwelling child appeared in these stories, his strong yearning for the kibbutz life or at least to the kibbutz was emphasized. The stories were based on collective adventures from the children’s home and the children’s society. Parents and their “room” were most often absent from the plots. Readers were often addressed by the plural “you,” referring to the generational collective of the peer group. (131) The ardent ideology expressed in the lives of the fathers and mothers of those raised on such narratives is vividly captured in an amusing scene in Moshe Shamir’s novel Hu halach ba-sadot (He Walked Through the Fields; 1947) and the 1959 drama by the same name, set during the British Mandate, in which the young men and women in the kibbutz shower stalls squabble over the few unbroken sets of “shower sandals,” which, like everything else, were communal property in the rareﬁed days when kibbutz socialism was at its height. In later years, kibbutz writers grew increasingly attuned to the critical demands of\n\n18679-Omer-Sherman_Imagining.indd 34\n\n3/13/15 4:59 PM\n\ntrepidation and exultation\n\n35\n\nreﬂecting the tensions rising between the individual (and nuclear family life) and the pervasive power of what Edna Barromi Perlman calls the “mythologies of collectivity” (102). It is these rifts which Imagining the Kibbutz investigates, in a range of popular as well as lesser-known literary narratives, each of which serves as a stirringly poignant portrait of a unique time and place whose norms and values may now seem utterly alien. Meyer Levin’s novel Yehuda (1931), set in a ﬁctional “farm commune” identiﬁed as “Carmel,” provides the very ﬁrst extended ﬁctional treatment of kibbutz life in either Hebrew or English (it is such an early work that an expla"
