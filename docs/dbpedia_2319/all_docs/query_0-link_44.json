Focusing on central social, religious and political developments among Jews from the final partition of Poland (1795) up to the post-Communist era, the chapter is designed to provide background to students and other readers interested in the topic and the period. Volume 8 of The Cambridge History of Judaism: The Modern World, was edited by Mitchell B. Hart and Tony Michels.\n\nA short information is presented, with many self-explanatory figures for the better understanding of contributions in the volumes of the \"Proceedings of the 19th International Phytogeographic Excursion (IPE), 1989, through Poland\"."
