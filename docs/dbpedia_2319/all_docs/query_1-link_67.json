        "text": "\"A controversial, award-winning story about the passionate but untenable affair between an Israeli woman and a Palestinian man, from one of Israel's most acclaimed novelists. When Liat meets Hilmi on a blustery autumn afternoon in Greenwich Village, she finds herself unwillingly drawn to him. Charismatic and handsome, Hilmi is a talented young artist from Palestine. Liat, an aspiring translation student, plans to return to Israel the following summer. Despite knowing that their love can be only temporary, that it can exist only away from their conflicted homeland, Liat lets herself be enraptured by Hilmi: by his lively imagination, by his beautiful hands and wise eyes, by his sweetness and devotion. Together they explore the city, sharing laughs and fantasies and pangs of homesickness. But the unfettered joy they awaken in each other cannot overcome the guilt Liat feels for hiding him from her family in Israel and her Jewish friends in New York. As her departure date looms and her love for Hilmi deepens, Liat must decide whether she is willing to risk alienating her family, her community, and her sense of self for the love of one man. Banned from classrooms by Israel's Ministry of Education, Dorit Rabinyan's remarkable novel contains multitudes. A bold portrayal of the strains -- and delights -- of a forbidden relationship, All the Rivers (published in Israel as Borderlife) is a love story and a war story, a New York story and a Middle East story, an unflinching foray into the forces that bind us and divide us. \"The land is the same land,\" Hilmi reminds Liat. \"In the end all the rivers flow into the same sea.\" International praise for All the Rivers : \"I'm with Dorit Rabinyan. Love, not hate, will save us. Hatred sows hatred, but love can break down barriers.\"--Svetlana Alexievich, winner of the Nobel Prize for Literature \"Even the (asymmetrical) tragedy of the two peoples does not overwhelm this precise and elegant love story, drawn with the finest of lines. There are many astonishing things about this book.\"--Amos Oz \"Rabinyan is a generous writer who puts her characters first. Rabinyan's writing reflects the honesty and modesty of a true artisan.\"--Ha'aretz \"Rabinyan juggles cultures, languages, art forms, places, times, and seasons. Because the novel strikes the right balance between the personal and the political, and because of her ability to tell a suspenseful and satisfying story, we decided to award Dorit Rabinyan's [All the Rivers] the 2015 Bernstein Prize.\"--the 2015 Bernstein Prize judges' decision \"[All the Rivers] ought to be read like J.M. Coetzee or Toni Morrison -- from a distance in order to get close. We might be born Montague or Capulet, but we can choose not to be part of the tragedy.\"--Walla! \"Beautiful and sensitive, a human tale of rapprochement and separation. a noteworthy human and literary achievement.\"--Makor Rishon \"A captivating (and heartbreaking) gem, written in a spectacular style, with a rich, flowing, colorful and addictive language.\"--Motke \"Rabinyan's ability to create a rich realism alongside a firm, clear and convincing flow of emotional fluctuations. gives the work a literary momentum and makes the reading both compelling and enjoyable.\"--Ynet \"A great novel of love and peace.\"--La Stampa \"A novel that truly speaks to the heart.\"--Corriere della Sera\"-- \"One day, in the cold of early New York winter, a chance encounter brings two strangers together: Hilmi, a Palestinian born in Hebron, and an Israeli woman called Liat. A promising young translator, Liat plans to study in New York for six months and then return home to Tel Aviv. Immediately drawn to the charismatic, passionate, and kind Hilmi, Liat decides that their connection will be -- can only be -- an affair, a short-lived but intense memento of her frozen winter away from home. But their passionate fling deepens into love, and Liat and Hilmi find themselves caught between their desire for each other and their duties to their families; between the possibility of creating a life together and the fear that Israelis and Palestinians are supposed to be enemies. And as the weeks and days slip by, Liat and Hilmi must decide whether their love is worth risking the disapproval of their families, their friends and even their government. Written by one of Israel's most acclaimed contemporary authors, All The Rivers is a powerful, deeply intimate Romeo and Juliet story for our times\"--… (more)\n\nLibraryThing member ashergabbay\n\nThe new book by Israeli author Dorit Rabinyan, \"Boderlife\" (original Hebrew title \"גדר חיה\"), became a bestseller in Israel almost instantly. But not thanks to Rabinyan's reputation or to good reviews.\n\nThe novel catapulted to the top of the bestseller lists because the Ministry of Education\n\nShow More\n\nbanned the book from inclusion in high school curricula. The reason? It is a story of an intimate relationship between a Jewish Israeli woman and a Muslim Palestinian man. Such a relationship was deemed inappropriate for teenager consumption, lest it endanger the separate identities of the two peoples and encourage assimilation. Following the public outcry, the Ministry clarified that the book is not banned, just \"not included\" in the recommended reading list.\n\nThe plot in short. A young Israeli woman, Liat, meets a young Palestinian man, Hilmi, in New York. They are both there temporarily. They fall in love and have a relationship that lasts a few months, during the winter of 2003. In the spring, they both return home - she to Tel Aviv, he to his village in the West Bank - and the relationship ends. They don't meet in Israel/Palestine. Their short-lived relationship is a common love story, except of course in the background is the fact that they come from two sides of a bitter national conflict. Sometimes they argue, but mostly the book focuses on the woman's thoughts (it's written in the first female form) about this impossible love.\n\nRabinyan writes well, in beautiful Hebrew prose, just as she did in her previous two award-winning novels. But truth be told, the story itself is quite banal. I doubt whether this book would have been such a success had the authorities - in a typically short-sighted decision - not made it famous by declaring it \"liber non grata\".\n\nIn my opinion, the Jewish-Muslim love story is not the problem of this book. Besides the banality of the love story, what is much more annoying is the way Rabinyan depicts the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. This is not a political novel (maybe it is?), but Rabinyan manages to subtly convey her opinion about who's the good guy and who's the bad guy in this conflict.\n\nA few examples:\n\n- Hilmi comes from an educated family, who readily accepts his Jewish girlfriend. In contrast, Liat goes through painstaking efforts to hide her relationship, lest her family \"hang her in public\".\n\n- Hilmi comes from a family that was deported from Israel in 1948, and when he was a teenager he was jailed for 4 months for writing graffiti. The soldiers in the military prison are described as minor sadists, who derive pleasure from making the Palestinian prisoners sing Israeli songs against their will.\n\n- Liat constantly thinks about how her lover sees their relationship through the prism of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. She is constantly on the defensive, imagining his pains. Hilmi, on the other hand, is carefree and a free spirit (he is a painter).\n\n- The Israelis Liat and Hilmi bump into in New York are described as loud, rude and selfish. On the other hand, Hilmi's brothers and friends are described as beautiful, smart and gentle.\n\nAnd so it goes, on and on. Frankly, this is tiring. It is so typical of the prevailing zeitgeist among certain Israeli left-wing writers that it borders on the pathetic. My views of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict are well known to the readers of this blog, and yet I find such one-sided depictions of \"who's good and who's bad\" in this conflict truly despicable. I couldn't enjoy this well-written book because of this annoyingly self-deprecating, perhaps even self-hating, subtext. Shame really.\n\nSo maybe, after all, the Ministry of Education's decision, although misguided in its intention, is a blessing in disguise. Israeli teenagers are blessed not to be exposed to such dribble about the conflict they grew up into. They deserve better.\n\nShow Less\n\nLibraryThing member bayleaf\n\nA year after 9/11 Liat, an Israeli translator, and Hilmi, a Palestinian artist, meet in NYC and immediately fall deeply and tragically in love. What follows is a chronicle not only of their story, but one of far wider scope, the political divide between Israel and Palestine.\n\nI was reminded of an\n\nShow More\n\nadulterous relationship where one is often the more realistic of the two. Hilmi is a romantic. As an artist, he sees things in colors and lives more in the moment than Liat. Liat, in the United States on a six-month visa, has an expiration date not only for her time in the country, but one for the relationship. The conflict between their cultures is never far from her mind. She sees evidence of their differences everywhere and works very hard at keeping their romance private and secret from her family in Israel. Hilmi, in his idealistic way, introduces Liat to visiting family members at a restaurant dinner with drastic results. In the end each return to their side of the great divide, Liat permanently and Hilmi for the summer, yet they continue to sporadically keep in contact. The conclusion is both tragic and expected.\n\nBanned in Israeli schools as inappropriate because of its depiction of an Israeli-Arab romantic relationship, All the Rivers is more than a romance; it’s political in scope. Yes, the novel depicts how individual lives are influenced by public and political events, but I also see it as a look at multinational vs. two-state responses to a solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. Hilmi is romantic and idealistic, but is his view of a multinational state also such? Is Ms. Rabinyan’s novel more sympathetic towards his character than Liat’s or is her portrayal of Liat simply more objective? I found myself looking for a political bent to this book, but will leave it up to the reader to decide. Either way All the Rivers is a good example of one very personal consequence to this divisive and alienating struggle and a look at two of the possible options for peace in the continuous Middle East conflict.\n\nShow Less\n\nLibraryThing member GrandmaCootie\n\nAll the Rivers: A Novel by Dorit Rabinyan is a very powerful story, but also very hard to relate to or understand, and very eye-opening, if you are a Midwestern America, like me. Liat and Hilmi seem to be irresistibly drawn to each other, but at least in Liat’s case, very reluctantly. Is it all a\n\nShow More\n\nphysical attraction? Certainly Liat is attracted by his hair and his ears and his hands and the way he moves. She describes his body and his clothes over and over. He is charming and seems taken with her as well.\n\nI saw this story referred to as a modern-day Romeo & Juliet, but it is not like that. These are not 14-year olds in wide-eyed young love, directly controlled by their parents. These are 30-year old adults, world travelers, with jobs and friends and previous experiences in life. The book description is also misleading. I don’t believe Liat ever considered having to make a decision, to choose, to “risk alienating her family, her community, and her sense of self for the love of one man.” This relationship was always temporary, on and off at that whenever they ventured into political discussions and arguments, and her sense of self was never at risk. They never came close to seeing the other’s point of view or entertaining the idea of looking for a way to remain together. They could have stayed in New York, but they never even considered that. The plan was always for Liat to return home, they were both close to family and homesick, and too molded by politics and history to consider change.\n\nRightly or wrongly, family and homeland came first. But Liat allowed herself to become angry and hurt when Hilmi did not stand up for her to his brother, while thinking nothing of wanting him to cease existing in her world when she was talking to her family. At times she was just a little too dramatic, and his absent-minded artist persona was hard to take at times.\n\nThe writing is strong and beautiful and the story is enticing. Descriptions of the food make you hungry, and descriptions of New York and Israel and Palestine are so vivid you feel like you are there.\n\nUltimately Liat and Hilmi’s relationship was not a doomed love story to me, but more a fling, an interlude, something that is never meant to be more than temporary: the summer love before you go back to work, the forbidden office affair, or perhaps more close to the royal and the commoner, where duty wins out. But as a story of how cultural rules and history can prevent love from ever really starting, about the pull of family and tradition and how politics and hatred shape lives and the future it was compelling and unforgettable.\n\nShow Less\n\nLibraryThing member lilibrarian\n\nLiat is in New York City for several months, working as a translator and apartment sitting for friends. It is a nice change from her home in Tel Aviv. Then she meets Hilmi, a Palestinian from Ramallah. They have more in common than she ever expected, and she falls in love, knowing it can never last.\n\nLibraryThing member RidgewayGirl\n\nAll the Rivers is the title given to the English translation of a novel by Israeli author Dorit Rabinyan which was banned from Israeli schools. It's the story of a relationship that forms between an Israeli translator working in New York on a temporary basis and a Palestinian artist. The story is\n\nShow More\n\ninteresting, but unremarkable except for their heritages. Liat reacts by hiding the relationship from her family and living under a fear of being seen by someone from back home whenever they are together in public, a fear that extends to being seen by anyone from Israel. Hilmi is unafraid of their relationship and his frustration comes from being sent out of the room when her parents call, even as his insistence in including Liat in an evening meal when his brother visits from Ramallah results in an uncomfortable evening for everyone.\n\nThis book did give me an insight into how intractable the division between the Israelis and the Palestinians is, even as Hilmi remains optimistic about the future. They both live with the damage the long conflict has done to them, creating areas where they can't communicate. This isn't a trite story of love conquering all, and even when they are together in New York, their relationship is a very real one. In the end, Rabinyan fails to stick the landing, writing an ending that carefully skirts around any hard decisions on the part of Hilmi and Liat, and one that also avoids making any sort of meaningful comment on Israeli-Palestinian relations. I'm left wondering if this careful circling around of the issues still resulted in All the Rivers being viewed as controversial, what would have happened had Rabinyan refused to allow her characters an easy way out?\n\nShow Less\n\nLibraryThing member annbury\n\nThis story of a doomed love affair between an Israeli girl and a Palestinian man is moving and well written. The affair is possible because both are temporarily in New York. It is doomed, however, because both are too tied to their families, their homelands, and their political beliefs to consider\n\nShow More\n\nworking out a relationship that could last. The ending is profoundly sad, but not surprising. One strength of the book is the vividness with which is shows the political passion of the two protagonists. To some degree, this is also a weakness -- a love story in which there is no possibility of an ongoing relationship (forget happily ever after) lacks a certain suspense. Still and all, well worth reading.\n\nShow Less\n\nLibraryThing member arosoff\n\nIsraeli Liat and Palestinian Hilmi meet in New York, neutral ground, in 2001 and fall in love. Writing a political novel is a tricky balancing act, especially one in which the main characters are, in some sense, a personification of the political. Characters in fiction must also be people, not\n\nShow More\n\nrepresentations that exist to give speeches. Although there are a couple of explicit conversations about the conflict, most of the politics here are delicately drawn. Everything in their lives is political, from Liat's army service, to food, to the very languages they speak (they communicate in English; some of Hilmi's Arabic is rendered as it would have been in the Hebrew original, translated in footnotes).\n\nThere is no great resolution here, no grand statements. Their relationship is both wonderful and incredibly, impossibly sad. Rabinyan doesn't stake out a position on the conflict; she does, however, try to shrink it to a complex miniature.\n\nShow Less"
