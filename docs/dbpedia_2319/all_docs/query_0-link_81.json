It could not have been written without the collaboration and friendship of the narrators, Orna Ben Dor, Naomi Ben Natan, Rivka Keren, Batia Gur, Tania Hadar, Karmit Gai, Lea Aini, Savyon Liebrecht, and in particular, Nava Semel, who has accompanied the project since its inception. Their stories, poems, and films inspired me to begin this work, and helped me to persevere. Special thanks to Dr Barbara Bradby of the Department of Sociology, Trinity College Dublin, who midwived the doctoral dissertation which forms the basis for this book rigourously, yet kindly, and who has become a close friend in the process. Thanks to the Departmental Research Fund and to Trinity Foundation for their financial support. Many people in Israel assisted me. Zvi Dror of kibbutz Lochamei Hagetaot kindly shared his experiences of collecting testimonies. Professor Dan Bar On of Ben Gurion University illuminated a dark corner in relation to my ‘split subjectivity’. Dina Wardi, Dr Yitzhak Mendelsohn, and Billie Laniado shared their experiences with me, as did Helen Epstein, whose book was the first of its kind. Liz Stanley’s work on auto/biography was a crucial methodological inspiration. Reading Ruth Linden’s Making Stories, Making Selves was a turning point. Liz and Ruth have been extremely supportive and have become my friends. Joan Ringelheim’s work on Shoah and gender was another turning point. She kindly shared her work with me, which I in turn share with my students. Their influence is evident in this book. As ever, deepest love and thanks to Louis, Alana, and Miki who were always supportive, loving and encouraging. Alana gave me\n\nLentin-00-Prelims 8/21/00 11:02 AM Page x\n\nx\n\nAcknowledgements\n\ninvaluable editorial support in the final stages of writing. Thanks too to my cousin Lior Shieber. Finally, to my dear mother Lia, who has been sending me Shoah-related books for more years than I care to remember. Her stories about ‘there’ and her love and strength have inspired me and kept me going throughout my life and work.\n\nLentin-00-Prelims 8/21/00 11:02 AM Page xi\n\nPROLOGUE IF I FORGET THEE …\n\n1 Only when the bus chugs up the hill, the evening light, across the dusty bus window, beyond the layers of recycled air-conditioned air, touching and not touching my warm cheek, do I become homesick. Homesick at home, only at home, in the Jerusalem of my youth. Absurd? Every time I leave, the craving stops. The craving for the home I left twenty-seven years ago for the land from which one emigrates, to which so few immigrate. I was one of those few. In a file marked ‘personal papers’ I have a carbon copy of my post-nuptial naturalisation papers, together with one Eva MacAonghusa, another post-nuptial blow-in. In my parents’ home, a book, in Hebrew, by one Efraim Schwartzman, dark green cover – what else? – The Irish War of Independence. Black and white photographs of the founding fathers (plus one Constance Markievicz) of the Irish state, the state I was not to know would one day be home. Think of it: heym and home the meaning the same of course exactly but the shift in vowel was the ocean in which I drowned (Klepfisz, 1990c: 228).\n\nLentin-00-Prelims 8/21/00 11:02 AM Page xii\n\nxii\n\nPrologue: If I forget thee …\n\n2 The evening light. Nothing like it in the world. Despite the fact that the Jerusalem of my youth has long become the domain of the ultra-orthodox, the domain of the extreme rightwing. Despite the furious building, covering every hilltop with apartment blocks, despite the fact that every inch of ‘nature’ has been reclaimed. In the spring, the desert air blows into town, bringing with it memories of mountains. Nothing like it in the world. Walking the streets which have changed since I was living here, yet retain the fervour of youth. 1967: postwar revolution in the air, painting slogans against the occupation on the walls, conspiring in smoky rooms to overturn (our) Jewish homeland. Now it all sounds so passé, almost banal. Yet not much remains of our wet dreams of home to Palestinians, and home to Jews, in a (secular democratic) together which has soured, like a carton of old milk.\n\n3 On the way to the Palestinian National Authority, many homes were demolished. Homes of parents whose children, yes, children, were soldiers and were killed defending the indefensible. Parents whose grief never ends. Homes of parents whose children, yes, children, threw stones and rebelled among the olivegroves on the hills of the West Bank. Homes blown up in retaliation against parents whose children. Women left screaming on the rubble that was once home, television cameras picking up their grief-stricken faces. And then moving onto the next story, next trouble spot. But the rubble remains. And olive trees are uprooted and replanted in the (Jewish) settlement on the next hilltop. All in the name of home. National home. Homeland. Homeland in Hebrew – moledet – from the same root as laledet – giving birth. Mother-land. The violent homebirth of nation-states.\n\n4 Jerusalem was later. My childhood passed on Mount Carmel, where Lia, my mother, still lives. Lia, my significant (m)other. Plucked from their affluent home in northern Romania, Lia and her parents left on the last week it was possible to do so.

Lia’s birthplace, Vatra Dornei, a spa town in the Carpathians, along quiet streams. Another home. I journeyed there, to research a book, my life. Their house on a street called after the family name. Wealthy Jews, bankers, sawmill owners. Long gone from a town where only a handful of Jews remain. Their house, called Villa Lia, to celebrate Mother’s birth, now home to four or five Romanian families. Leaving Vatra Dornei feels like leaving home, like death. There are demons there which inhabited my soul, stealthily, refusing to be exorcised. Mother cannot understand the pull. When she left, she left that world behind. She has no other home, is never homesick, because she never leaves home, has never left home since that time, in the middle of that war. I, her eldest child, re-enacted the diasporic experience, voluntarily migrating from my violent mother-land, my violent national home. Home-leave. Layers upon layers of home-leaves.\n\n5 Dia-spora. I was a member of ‘the (Israeli) first generation to redemption’, coached to despise those ‘dia-spora Jews’, for having allegedly gone passively to their death during the Shoah, ‘like lambs to the slaughter’. Israel was the place where Jews would be proud again, would take up arms to fight their ‘enemies’, would never again ‘go to their death like lambs to the slaughter’. I was also a member of a family of Shoah survivors. An act of naming I was only able to engage in while researching this book. Up until then, I ‘knew and did not know’ at the same time. But I did not acknowledge I had a stake in that big slaughter. Lia’s family, those who did not get away on that fateful week, were deported to Transnistria, a camp in Northern Romania. Her grandfather, her favourite uncle, another uncle, a cousin – a little girl – all died, lost in the snow, sent on a labour detail, starved to death. The others arrived, broken, ill, in the uncomprehending Israel of the 1950s. Their new home. Where I and my generation refused to hear their stories, constructing instead our own stories of armed struggles for independence. Now I know. Not only that in constructing itself as a ‘new Jewish entity’ did Israel construct itself as masculine thereby ‘feminising’ diaspora Jewry and the Shoah.\n\nLentin-00-Prelims 8/21/00 11:02 AM Page xiv\n\nxiv\n\nPrologue: If I forget thee …\n\nBut also that hero and non-hero, Israeli and Jew - we are all the same. All (wo)men together. In re-enacting the dia-sporic experience, in re-exiling myself from my mother-land, I am a Jew again. The epitome of strangerhood, homeless in my adopted Irish home.\n\n6 The evening light of Jerusalem. Nothing like it in the world. Not even the orange sky over Connemara. Or the caramelised watery reflection over the Ha’penny Bridge. Nothing like it in the world. Home is the late-night intimacies one can only have in one’s (m)other-tongue. Jerusalem – the only place in the world where I can breathe freely. Night. Jerusalem. Yerushalayim. Jerusalem. If I forget thee Oh Jerusalem Jerusalem Hebron Ramallah Nablus Qattana if I forget thee oh Jerusalem Oh Hebron may I forget my own past my pain the depth of my sorrows. (Klepfisz, 1990b: 240).\n\nI do not forget. Not only because, as Klepfisz vows, forgetting the injustices of the present obliterates the depth of past sorrows. Nor because, by adding a Jewish past to my ‘new Hebrew’ Israeli past, I still have not found home in the dia-spora of my own making. Or because in the Ireland of my dia-sporic adult choice I’ll forever be a (m)otherless-’other’, whose memories play a different tune. But, perhaps, because you can only be homesick at home. In that tragic, magic, Jerusalem evening light.\n\nLentin-01 8/21/00 11:02 AM Page 1\n\nCHAPTER 1\n\nINTRODUCTION: THE TERRITORIES OF SILENCE\n\nIntroduction The destruction of a third of Europe’s Jews by Nazism is unquestionably the worst catastrophe in the history of contemporary Judaism and a formative event in the history of Zionism and the state of Israel. Understandably therefore, the Shoah, written about, analysed and given various political interpretations, is a shaping public discourse in the history of the state of Israel. As one of the pre-state Israeli generation, the Shoah and its public commemoration played a central role in my own formation. My preoccupation with Shoah victimhood stood in sharp contrast to dominant discourses which, resulting from the construction of a stereotypical ‘new Hebrew’ active subjectivity, taught me and my generation to reject diaspora Jewry and its alleged passivity in the face of catastrophe. This book is a culmination of years of preoccupation with the meaning of the Shoah for me, an Israeli woman, some of whose family were victims, but whose close relatives fled the fire by emigrating ‘in time’ to the promise of Zion. It is a culmination of my need to break the silence about the Shoah in a society which constructed itself as the Israeli antithesis to the diaspora Jew, and to excavate a ‘truth’ from underneath the mountain of Zionist nation-building myths and silences. These myths and silences not only had deep implications for the formation of my generation, but also a profound impact on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. This book is a personal act of reckoning, and of mourning the loss of life that was the Shoah, and the inability, or unwillingness, to mourn that very loss by an Israeli society absorbed in acts of survival.\n\nLentin-01 8/21/00 11:02 AM Page 2\n\n2\n\nIsrael & the Daughters of the Shoah\n\nThere is a close link between Israeli-Zionist discursive representations and Israel’s sociopolitical reality. Zionist political leaders, many of whom were also intellectuals and writers, not only played a role in making history, they also wrote history, thus influencing how history was perceived and remembered. Their interpretations of the history they made became general ‘truths’ and accepted myths (Zertal, 1996a: 15). Similarly, Israeli cultural and literary discourses, due to the central societal role played by poets and novelists, have always been instrumental in shaping both the perceptions of reality and reality itself (Gover, 1996: 28–9). There are few cultures where the word ‘state’ replaces so readily the word ‘country’. Indeed, Laor argues, a large proportion of Israeli terms and images have been dictated from above: ‘people were brought here and settled and given names and identification numbers, and a past and, of course, a future’ (Laor, 1995: 10). In this volume I aim to make visible the contradiction between Zionist myths of the Shoah as a catastrophe which happened not to ‘us’ Israelis, but to a diaspora Jewish ‘other’, and the post-Shoah Israeli reality which discursively employed the Shoah to justify the occupation of Palestinian lands and people, and its excesses. These myths of the supposed passivity, weakness, pathology, and non-virility of that Jewish ‘other’ contradicted the reality that the survivors, despite their suffering and despite being stigmatised in Israeli society, proved to be as active, strong, psychologically sound and ‘virile’ as the next Israeli. They also contradicted the fact that no Israeli fitted the simplistic heroic mould which Zionism constructed. Field research for this book was conducted between 1992 and 1996, the four years of the Rabin-Peres government which ended after the assassination of Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin in November 1995, with the election, in May 1996, of the right-wing government of Binyamin Netanyahu. Netanyahu was replaced, in May 1999, by Ehud Barak, leader of the One Israel Party (formerly the Labour party), seen as the successor of Rabin’s political way. Informed by a reflexive feminist auto/biographical research methodology, Israel and the Daughters of the Shoah centres on the personal narratives of nine Israeli writers and film-makers who are daughters of Shoah survivors. In their life and work, these women have excavated the meanings of being daughters of survivors in Israeli society. The narratives were elicited through open-ended in-depth interviews in autumn 1992, a short time after Rabin acceded to power. For the narrators, it was a time of transformation and hope, personal and political: they, and I, were hopeful about the possibility of a shift in the employment of Shoah discourses to justify the excesses of the Israeli occupation, although I did not share their optimism about the peace process itself.1\n\nLentin-01 8/21/00 11:02 AM Page 3\n\nIntroduction: the territories of silence\n\n3\n\nThe research process had a profound transformatory effect on me in naming myself, for the first time, a daughter of a family of survivors. Similarly, their ‘research’ processes (which resulted in their books, poems, and films) had a transformatory effect on the narrators. In offering the nine narrators a forum to break the silences of their Israeli Shoah daughterhood, I seek to bridge the ‘memory gap’ (Grunfeld, 1995) between the traumatic legacy of the Shoah and the discourses available to represent it. ‘Stories’, or personal narratives, are the only means at our disposal to close the gap between ontology2 and representation. As well as their own transformation, I argue that the narrators’ works were instrumental in assisting in the shift in Israeli attitudes to the Shoah and its meanings. In making our ‘stories’ we not only make our selves (Linden, 1993), we also ‘make’ and help to shape societal discourses and perceptions by breaking the silences about un-named traumatic experiences such as the Shoah. Before discussing the three main ‘territories of silence’ which this book aims to re-occupy, I will address four semantic-thematic issues: the use of the term ‘Shoah’; a tentative definition of Israeli Shoah survivors and their children; the centrality of the terms ‘territories’ and ‘occupation’ of the sub-title in the Israeli context; and finally, the centrality of silence to the ‘story’ of Israel and the Shoah. Firstly, I use the Hebrew word ‘Shoah’ meaning catastrophe, cataclysm, disaster, to describe the annihilation of a third of the Jewish people by the Nazis before and during the Second World War, rather than the English language term ‘Holocaust’. Naming the catastrophe and the metaphorical process of that naming have profound political meanings, particularly in the Israeli context (as will be discussed in chapter 4). The Jewish lexicon had already contained a set of precedents and terms by which to understand the catastrophe and the appropriate ritual days of mourning by which to commemorate all past and present disasters. The term khurban (destruction in Hebrew), denoting the destruction of the first and second temples, suggested itself to Jewish writers to describe the unfolding massacre of Europe’s Jews. However, khurban, with its attendant religious connotations, did not appeal to the Zionist leadership in Palestine. The term ‘Shoah’ was deliberately sought by Zionism to allow for new, Erez Israeli,3 rather than Jewish-diasporic meanings. Although I oppose the appropriation and ‘Zionisation’ of the Shoah by political Zionism, which discursively rejected the alleged passivity of Europe’s Jews, I prefer the term ‘Shoah’ to the term ‘Holocaust’. ‘Holocaust’ derives from the Greek holocauston, meaning ‘whole burnt’, referring in Septuagint to sacrifice by fire as distinct from the Hebrew term for sacrificial offering, olah. Many Jews, aware of the Christian notion of a Jewish calvary and sacrifice, reject the term (Young, 1990: 87).4\n\nLentin-01 8/21/00 11:02 AM Page 4\n\n4\n\nIsrael & the Daughters of the Shoah\n\nSecondly, the word ‘survivor’ is problematic because, as Lagerwey reminds us (1998: 18), some say that no one really survived the Shoah. Indeed, in Hebrew the word is ‘nitzolim’ – ‘those who were saved’ – echoing Fania Fenelon’s (1981: 117) description of people who were physically alive after liberation as having ‘come out with their lives’. In the debate as to who is an Israeli Shoah survivor, some say that only those who lived under the Nazi occupation or were subject to the ‘Final Solution’ are entitled to call themselves Shoah survivors. About 100,000 people who were children during the Shoah live in Israel today, most are aged between 50 and 65 (Porian, 1996: B6). In the Shoah Encyclopaedia (Gutman, 1990) there is no definition under ‘survivors’. Legally and historically, it is possible to define as ‘Shoah survivor’ a person who lived under Nazi rule during the Second World War and who was subject to the policy of the ‘Final Solution’ and remained alive. Bar On (1994) problematises this definition and broadens it to allow for self-definition. Self-definition, however, is fraught with hierarchies and contradictions. Some survivors of rescue operations such as the Kästner train,5 for instance, found it hard to relate to what happened to them, because it was not considered ‘real’ suffering in comparison to the suffering of camp or ghetto survivors. According to Bar On (1994: 27), objective and subjective definitions of survivorship relate to one’s self-legitimisation and to the legitimisation of one’s close group regarding one’s experiences during the Shoah. Survivors sometimes tend to self-grade themselves and create hierarchies between those who were deported to concentration camps and who have a tattooed number on their forearms, those who lived in ghettos and were not deported to concentration or extermination camps, those coming from ‘mixed’ ChristianJewish families, and those who had emigrated to Palestine prior to the War, but whose families were exterminated. There is also a hierarchy between members of resistance organisations and members of the Jewish police, or the Judenräte, the Jewish councils. Rather than enter into the debate over the classification of ‘real’ and ‘less real’ Shoah survivors, I prefer to allow for self-definition in the definition of ‘Israeli Shoah survivors’. ‘Survivor’ is a socially constructed identity, yet the term tends to reify Jews’ experience under Nazi occupation. Survivors construct their diverse identities as survivors, yet they share both commonalties and differences, which need to be explored empirically (Linden, 1993: 87–8). Equally complex is the definition of Israeli ‘children of Shoah survivors’, termed both in the literature and popularly ‘the second-generation’. This is a contested term, since some (e.g., Ravnitsky, 1986; Hazan, 1987) believe either that children of survivors have no characteristics distinguishing them from other Israelis, or that they do not\n\nLentin-01 8/21/00 11:02 AM Page 5\n\nIntroduction: the territories of silence\n\n5\n\nhave the same entitlements as do their survivor-parents (Dror, 1992). Despite the temptations of ‘certain postmodernisms’ (Linden, 1996: 11) to include all Jews born after the Shoah in the broad definition of ‘children of survivors’, a ‘reality’ specific to Israelis whose parents did experience the Shoah, diverse, problematic and complex as it may be, does indeed exist. Self-definition is again a central criterion and in some cases, self-definition as a child of survivors is an act of ‘naming’ and of ‘making the self ’ as we ‘make our stories’. Thirdly, the terms ‘territories’ and ‘occupation’ of the subtitle are, I argue, central to any study of contemporary Israel, impossible in isolation from the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. The conflict, despite its profound effect on Israeli social formation, has historically been neglected and marginalised in Israeli sociology, blinded by the hegemonic conception of the conflict, part of the Israeli political consensus, in which sociology has played a central role (Ehrlich, 1993: 253, 259). The 1977 elections, which broke the thirty-year political hegemony of socialist Zionism (in the shape of the Labour-Mapai party) and brought Menachem Begin’s right-wing Likud party to power, signalled a shift in the sociological discourse from identification with the establishment to a more autonomous position. But only in recent years has Israeli sociology taken up a critical position vis-à-vis Israeli society (Ram, 1993b: 17). One strand in the critical Israeli sociology of the 1980s and 1990s, along with élite theory, Marxism, pluralism, and feminism, is the analysis of Israeli society as a settler-colonial society. Because this was the most critical perspective towards Zionism, Israel’s fundamental ethos, it has been kept out of the Israeli sociological agenda until relatively recently. Prior to becoming an academic perspective, the colonisatory perspective had been theorised by Israeli-Jewish marginal radical political groupings, such as Matspen (Schnall, 1979; Wigoder and Wigoder, 1999), to which I belonged in the late 1960s. The controversy provoked by the 1967 war and the ensuing occupation of Palestinian territories allowed this perspective to be gradually incorporated into the Israeli sociological discourse (Ram, 1993b: 29). According to the colonisatory perspective, the major force in shaping Israeli society was the process of colonising an already inhabited land. This perspective views Israel being a settler-colonial society as the decisive factor in Israeli social formation (Kimmerling, 1983; Shafir, 1989; Ram, 1993; Abdo and Yuval-Davis, 1995). Post-colonial theories have rarely been employed to theorise the position of Jews, rather than Palestinians in settler-colonial analyses of Zionism. But, as Boyarin argues (1997a: 279), Herzlian Zionism as well as being seen as the solution to the ‘Jewish question’, was based on European Jews giving up their ‘primitive’ distinctiveness, showing\n\nLentin-01 8/21/00 11:02 AM Page 6\n\n6\n\nIsrael & the Daughters of the Shoah\n\n‘manly’ virtues and becoming as ‘civilised’ as their Aryan neighbours (as argued below in chapter 6). Zionism can thus be seen as both a decolonisation process (Jews freeing themselves from the Euro-Aryan yoke) and a re-colonisation process (in relation to the land of Israel and the indigenous Palestinians). However, this call on post-coloniality does not sit comfortably with theories of diaspora: we must ask, in relation to the negation of the Jewish diaspora implied in narratives of the newly constructed Israeli nation, where does homeland begin and diaspora end. Following Nandy’s reading of colonisation as the feminisation of the colonised (1983), occupation and territories, as well as masculinity and militarism, are as central to Israeli social formation as they are to the link between statehood and gender. Simona Sharoni (1992) argues that the Israeli-Palestinian conflict has had a deep impact on women’s lives and on the social construction of gender relations in Israel. The social construction of manhood in Israel has its roots in a particular historical context, especially in relation to the Shoah and the creation of the Jewish State. I concur with Sharoni’s argument that the state of Israel can be seen as ‘a reassertion of masculinity, justified by the need to end a history of weakness and suffering by creating an image of an Israeli man who is exceedingly masculine, pragmatic, protective, assertive and emotionally tough’ (Sharoni, 1992: 457). Resulting from the ongoing occupation, Zionist ideology has made ‘national security’ a top priority, offering Israeli men a privileged status and legitimising national, ethnic and gender inequalities. Linking occupation and gender relations, Sharoni argues that ‘in a context where every man is a soldier, every woman becomes an occupied territory’ (ibid.: 459). Finally, silence, and silencing, are central to my argument. In order to consolidate the Israeli Zionist narrative, silences had to be constructed. Survivors were tutored in self-silencing during the Shoah, which was an event which ‘had no witness’, because the Nazis did all they could to wipe out not only the Jews, but also their memory. They were also silenced by pre-state and early state Zionist narratives that privileged heroic myths constructed around the partisans and around Erez Israeli youth. There is a link between silencing the survivors and silencing the truth about the dispossession of the Palestinians. Laor (1995: 115–70) argues that the silence about the dispossession of the Palestinians and the atrocities involved during and after the 1948 war, initiated by Israel’s first Prime Minister David Ben Gurion, became the silence of the state, academia, and the media. ‘Ben Gurion believed in silence because he believed in the power of words to be remembered, to be studied, to become “truth”. Therefore he did not speak about the expulsions’ (Laor, 1995: 125).\n\nLentin-01 8/21/00 11:02 AM Page 7\n\nIntroduction: the territories of silence\n\n7\n\nThis silence, which shaped the childhood of my generation, and the fictions of the Palestinians leaving their homes and their lands of their own free will, must be linked to silencing the survivors. Indeed, traumatic events are often dealt with by banishing them from consciousness: survivors of trauma, political or personal, often silence themselves and are silenced by society. This has been typical of Shoah survivors, many of whom remained silent for several decades. According to Funkenstein (1993: 22), the memory of Shoah survivors is fragmented. Although many camp survivors wanted to remember, they had been robbed of their identity by the Nazis. The Israeli writer Aharon Appelfeld, who survived as a lone child in the ghetto and the forest, writes this about the delicate balance between language and silence: Speaking is hard for me, not surprisingly: during the war people did not speak. Every disaster states again: what is there to say, there is nothing to say. Anyone who was in the ghetto, in the camps and in the forests is familiar with this silence, bodily … Only after the war did the words return. People began asking and wondering, and people who were not there asked for explanations … (But) words cannot deal with large catastrophes: they are poor, wretched vehicles, which soon become false … We often surround big catastrophes with words in order to defend ourselves. My first written words were sort of desperate attempts to find the silence which surrounded me during the war and to return me to myself. With my blind senses I understood that within this silence rests my soul. (Appelfeld, 1999: 95–6)\n\nIsrael and the Daughters of the Shoah is primarily concerned with reoccupying the territories of silence. The following section lists three conceptual silences which I attempt to re-occupy metaphorically in this book: the silence about the Shoah in sociology (including Israeli sociology); the silence about the link between gender and the Shoah; and the silence about social scientists’ auto/biographical involvement in their research process.\n\nThe territories of silence Sociology and the Shoah The ongoing debate as to the possibility of speech, or discourse, about the Shoah was inspired by Adorno’s famous claim that ‘after Auschwitz it is no longer possible to write poems’ (1949) and fuelled by survivors such as Elie Wiesel, who insisted that only survivors were entitled to speak about the Shoah (Wiesel, 1984). On the one side of the debate are those who argue that the best response to the Shoah is\n\nLentin-01 8/21/00 11:02 AM Page 8\n\n8\n\nIsrael & the Daughters of the Shoah\n\nsilence (Steiner, 1969: 165). Studying the Shoah includes the temptation to succumb to a Foucauldian ‘archaeology of silence’ (Foucault, 1967: xi). We must ask, however, whether such archaeology of silence is in itself not an order, an organised language, a project, a syntax, a work (Derrida, 1978: 25–6). I side with those (e.g., Celan, 1968; Langer, 1975), who argue, as Adorno himself did later (1962), that surrendering to silence would be a surrender to cynicism and by implication, to the very forces that created Auschwitz in the first place. An archaeology of silence is not sufficient, nor is it ultimately possible, despite the understandable tendency to regard the Shoah as ‘unspeakable’ and respond to it with silence. The Shoah must indeed be excavated, studied, compared, analysed and footnoted. The first silence I wish to re-occupy therefore is the silence about the Shoah itself within sociology. Zygmunt Bauman argues for incorporating the Shoah into sociological inquiry, since it ‘has more to say about the state of sociology than sociology in its present shape is able to add to our knowledge of the Holocaust’ (Bauman, 1989: 3). Bauman examines some of the few sociological studies of the Shoah (e.g., Fein, 1979; Tec, 1986) to chart two approaches through which the significance of the Shoah has been marginalised by sociology. One approach presents the Shoah as something which happened exclusively to the Jews; this makes the Shoah unique, uncharacteristic and sociologically inconsequential. This approach presents the Shoah as a consequence of European antisemitism6 (or, as Goldhagen [1995] argues more specifically, German antisemitism), and thus as a one-off episode which does not add to our understanding of modern society’s normal state. The other approach presents the Shoah as a primeval and culturally extinguishable ‘natural’ predisposition of the human species, pre-social and immune to cultural manipulation and as such, of no sociological interest. Against these two approaches, Bauman argues that the Shoah was ‘born and executed in our modern rational society, at the high stage of our civilisation and at the peak of human cultural achievement’ (Bauman, 1989: x). It is therefore relevant to the main themes of sociological inquiry, as ‘an outcome of a unique encounter between factors by themselves quite ordinary and common’. Every ‘ingredient’ of the Shoah – rationality, technology, bureaucracy and state violence – was ‘normal’, in the sense of being fully in line with everything we know about our civilisation. The machinery of destruction, Bauman quotes Shoah historian Raul Hilberg as saying, ‘was structurally no different from organised German society as a whole… (it) was the organised community in one of its special roles’ (Hilberg, 1983: 994). Arguing for using, amongst others, Weberian diagnoses of the tendencies of modern society, Bau-\n\nLentin-01 8/21/00 11:02 AM Page 9\n\nIntroduction: the territories of silence\n\n9\n\nman takes sociology to task for not applying sociological analyses to the study of the Shoah. Since Bauman wrote his book, there have been other orchestrated genocides, for example in Bosnia and Rwanda, to the study of which may be applied the criteria he applies to the study of the Shoah. Bauman’s central argument is that if such genocide could happen on such a massive scale in Nazi Germany, at the heart of European civilisation, then it can happen anywhere where ‘instrumental rationality, and its modern, bureaucratic form of institutionalisation, which had made the Holocaust-style solutions not only possible, but eminently “reasonable” is the ruling spirit’ (Bauman, 1989: 18). Bauman calls for a substantial revision of the orthodox sociology of morality and argues that the assumption that society is essentially a humanising, moralising device and that immoral conduct can be explained only as the malfunctioning of ‘normal’ society, has been disproved. Immorality is socially constructed and society may make immoral conduct more, rather than less, plausible. The social production of distance and the technology of segregation and separation which promote indifference to the plight of the Other, as successfully produced by Nazism, are societal achievements in the management of morality. Bauman concludes with another quote from Hilberg: Remember, again, that the basic question was whether a western nation, a civilised nation, could be capable of such a thing. And then, soon after 1945, we see the query turned around totally as one begins to ask: ‘Is there any western nation that is incapable of it?’ … In 1941 the Holocaust was not expected and that is the very reason for our subsequent anxieties. We no longer dare to exclude the unimaginable. (Hilberg, 1980: 98–9)\n\nThe American-Jewish sociologist Ruth Linden, in a book subtitled Feminist Reflections on the Holocaust (Linden, 1993), also bemoans the sociological silence about the Shoah, and proposes a change of terminology to ‘a phenomenology of surviving’ as the central concern of a sociology of the Shoah. Unlike that of Bauman, her sociology of the Shoah would be ‘empirically based and sensitive to problems of constructing and interpreting personal and historical narratives’. It would explore broad theoretical issues, such as ‘how human agency is exercised under genocide’. Sociologists, she suggests, could collect and analyse survivors’ testimonies, and clarify problems of ‘knowing’ and complicity by analysing personal narratives of perpetrators and bystanders. A sociology of the Shoah must reconcile the pre-determined annihilation of the Jews with the Jews’ refusal to die as individuals and as an ancient culture. The Jews must be viewed as interacting, knowing subjects, reasoning their way from one day to the next (Linden, 1993: 85–6).\n\nLentin-01 8/21/00 11:02 AM Page 10\n\n10\n\nIsrael & the Daughters of the Shoah\n\nThe state of Israel (alongside other Jewish self-appointed spokespersons, who denounced attempts to dissolve the uniquely Jewish character of the Shoah in the misery of an indistinct ‘humanity’) rejected all attempts to draw universal, rather than national, lessons from the Shoah. It employed the Shoah as an instrument of political legitimacy and has resisted attempts to compare the Shoah to contemporary genocides. At the same time, the young Israeli state constructed itself in opposition to the passivity implied in the discourse of Jewish victims allegedly ‘going to their death like lambs to the slaughter’. It met Shoah survivors upon their return from the Nazi hell with silence, and an inability, or unwillingness, to listen to their horrific experiences. Survivors’ experiences and the experiences of their children have, by and large, not been addressed by Israeli sociology. The few sociological studies that have been published (e.g., Boldo, 1983; YuchtmanYa’ar and Menachem, 1989; but with the exception of Kemp and Herzog, 1999, who analyse testimonies by women who were incarcerated in Ravensbrük) do not analyse survivor or ‘second-generation’ testimonies. Sociology is conspicuously absent from Israeli studies of the relationship between Israel and the Shoah by comparison with historical studies (e.g., Segev, 1991; Zuckermann, 1993; Yablonka, 1994; Hacohen, 1994),7 and psychological studies (see Wardi, 1990, for a comprehensive survey). The Shoah, and Israeli discourses about the Shoah, as well as survivors’ accounts, are undoubtedly socially constructed, and must therefore be available for sociological scrutiny. In employing personal narratives of daughters of survivors compelled and able to articulate the transmission of their parents’ Shoah experiences in the face of societal silencing and stigma, I aim to add to the breaking of that particular silence. In so doing, I aim to provide a sociological forum for speaking about the Shoah and about children of Shoah survivors in the Israeli context, and to position an auto/biographical sociological examination of ‘second-generation’ narratives in the context of Israeli discourses of state and nation construction. Shoah and gender Bauman does not bring gender into the equation. Linden’s analysis, on the other hand, is ‘feminist’ in the self-definition sense (see Reinharz, 1992), but also in the insistence that ‘self ’ and ‘other’ are inseparably fused in a dialectic of situated knowing (Linden, 1993: 147; Haraway, 1988: 592–3). The second territory of silence the book aims to reoccupy is therefore the silence about the link between Shoah and gender. According to Hilberg, ‘the final solution was intended … to ensure the annihilation of all Jews. Yet the road to annihilation was marked by events that specifically affected men as men and women as women’\n\nLentin-01 8/21/00 11:02 AM Page 11\n\nIntroduction: the territories of silence\n\n11\n\n(Hilberg, 1992: 126). Although it has been argued that ‘the greatest atrocities at Auschwitz were committed against Jewish women and children’ (Ainsztein, 1974: 788–9), and that ‘the concentration camp is an ultimate expression of the extreme masculinity and misogyny that undergirded Nazi ideology’ (Goldenberg, 1990: 163), gender-specific Shoah research began only in the late 1970s and is still strongly resisted by those who claim that raising questions about women trivialises the Shoah. The American historian and philosopher Joan Ringelheim who pioneered gender-specific Shoah research, argues (1992: 19–23) that regarding the Shoah as uniquely Jewish creates a division between Jewish experiences and those of Roma and Sinti, the disabled, Communists, Socialists, homosexuals, Jehovah’s Witnesses, Poles, Russians, POWs and other ‘asocials’, whose Shoah experiences remain silenced and unnamed (and often, because of different traditions of literacy, unwritten and unpublished). This approach, which differentiates between Jews and ‘others’, arises from the need to prevent the denial of the Jewish tragedy, as practised by neo-Nazi and extreme Muslim anti-Zionist groups and backed up by some historians (Antisemitism World Report, 1995: xviii-xix; see also Lipstadt, 1993).8 This leads to framing the Shoah as a metaphysical evil, removing it beyond human history, speech or rationality. Another approach to the study of the Shoah sees no difference between experiences of Jews, viewing the ‘Jewish experience’ as a univocal monolith. Just as the exclusivity-uniqueness approach ignores the complexities of non-Jewish experiences, the univocal approach ignores the complexities of Jewish experiences. No two Jews experienced the Shoah in the same way, and what happened to the Jews cannot be reduced to a ‘single sharp image of victimisation’ of the concentration camp. The Nazis intended to kill all Jews, but the end, or ‘extermination’, does not describe the process. Shoah studies, mostly conducted by male historians,9 do not take into account the experiences and perceptions of women during the Shoah. These experiences tend to be neutralised into a so-called ‘human’ perspective, which, on examination, turns out to be masculine. But women were killed not only as Jews, but also on account of their ‘biological destiny’, as the producers of the next ‘racially inferior’ Jewish generation. According to Ringelheim: A study of women and the Shoah calls into question some of the claims about the uniqueness of the Holocaust and the sameness of the Jewish experience, and thus even the ways in which the Holocaust is remembered. But there are deeper effects and more difficult tasks: to enlarge our understanding of the event by reclaiming the hidden experiences of women. Even if we assume that women and men suffered equally at the\n\nLentin-01 8/21/00 11:02 AM Page 12\n\n12\n\nIsrael & the Daughters of the Shoah\n\nhands of the Nazis, we find that, in one way or another, to one degree or another, they experienced their circumstances as women and men, and as Jews. (Ringelheim, 1992: 21)\n\nOfer and Weitzman (1998) also argue that questions about gender lead to a richer understanding of the Shoah. More specifically, they focus on four structural sources of gender differences during the Shoah: the culturally defined gender roles of Jewish men and women before the War, which endowed the two sexes with different skills, knowledge and expertise; the Jews’ ‘anticipatory reactions’ to what they believed the Nazis were going to do to Jewish men (but not to Jewish women and children); the differences in the nature and degree of harassment, work requirements, arrests and regulations that the Nazis imposed on Jewish men and women, even though they were all destined for death; and the different reactions of Jewish men and women in the ghettos, in hiding, in the forests and in the camps. Though not arguing that women’s experiences were totally different from those of men, since both women and men were targeted because of Nazi constructions of their ‘race’ rather than their genders, Ofer and Weitzman claim that just like other differences between Shoah victims (countries of origin, age, class), gender must be attended to so that we attempt to make sense of the enormity of the destruction (Ofer and Weitzman, 1998: 1–18). At the early stages of her research Ringelheim recorded women’s experiences during the Shoah, arguing that gender-defined conditions and traditional responses against women made them vulnerable. They were vulnerable to sexual abuse, rape and murder, the necessity of killing their own and other women’s babies, forced abortions and sterilisation, and other forms of sexual exploitation (by Nazis but also by Jewish men) in the ghettos, in the camps and in hiding. There are no gender-specific extermination figures, but Ringelheim’s detailed analysis of deportation figures and displaced persons statistics suggests that women probably make up more than half of the dead. The figures also suggest that, because they were less ‘useful’ to the Nazis as workers, fewer women than men were spared from immediate gassing; and that fewer women than men survived the extermination camps (Hilberg, 1992; Ringelheim, 1993). Ringelheim found that according to claims by survivors, women’s survival resources included forming alternative ‘families’ which became networks for maintenance that might have been related to survival rates, in that they were able to transform their habits of raising children or their experience of nurturing into the care of non-biological families (Ringelheim, 1985, 1993). In 1985, however, reflecting on her earlier research, she took herself to task for adopting\n\nLentin-01 8/21/00 11:02 AM Page 13\n\nIntroduction: the territories of silence\n\n13\n\na ‘cultural feminism’ stance (Alcoff, 1988), thus opting for a cosy ‘happy ending’ through accounts of female friendships and survival. Cultural feminism shares with liberalism a belief in individual solutions and in humanism and addresses a universal ‘woman’ while privileging some women over others, a tendency criticised effectively by majority world feminists in relation to western feminism (e.g., Mohanty et al., 1991; Ahmed, 1982). A cultural feminist stance, which tends to valorise oppression, damages not only our politics, but also our research, according to Ringelheim. Ringelheim argues that the ‘archaeological’ perspective on women’s culture must be re-examined. Indeed, excavating an ‘archaeology of silence’ is not sufficient without contextualising women’s Shoah experiences within Nazi ideological racism and sexism. Furthermore, privileging women’s bonding as a strategy of survival, and valuing, in line with feminist theorists such as Chodorow (1978) and Gilligan (1982), relationship over autonomy and caring over justice, perpetuate the dichotomy of female nurturing and attachment versus male autonomy and individuation (Goldenberg, 1990: 152). Praising some victims for their coping skills (or blaming them for their lack of such skills) also presents a danger, according to Ofer and Weitzman (1998: 15), of shifting the blame away from the Nazis on to the survivors themselves. Judith Baumel, however, disagrees with Ringelheim’s view that stressing women’s communal coping strategies valorises oppression, and argues that women’s survival strategies must be studied as different (rather than better or worse) than men’s in order to realise the depth of communal bond in crisis, and the importance of its gender dimension as a conceptual tool (Baumel, 1999b: 329–47). Similarly, Lagerwey (1998), who analyses published Auschwitz stories by men and women, found evidence ‘of women’s unique experiences, of sexuality, friendship and parenting, their mutual concern and assistance to each other, their emotional capacity, their unselfish and sacrificial sharing and great flexibility – in sum, a moral superiority that even the horrors of Auschwitz could not obliterate’. On the other hand, ‘true to my expectations, I found that the stories written by men told of personal isolation, personal survival at any cost, ruthless competition, and pragmatic allegiances. Male survivors framed their narratives in order and coherence, and often deemphasised emotions’ (ibid.,: 75). However, re-reading the narratives, Lagerwey realised that ‘the stories of Auschwitz are too complex to fit neatly into gender stereotypes’ and that the narratives are ‘not only gendered voices; there are nationalised voices, ethnic voices, ideological voices’ (ibid.,: 104, 108). Ultimately, she writes about what she initially thought of as merely ‘gendered’ narratives, as ‘narratives of chaos’ (ibid.,: 127).\n\nLentin-01 8/21/00 11:02 AM Page 14\n\n14\n\nIsrael & the Daughters of the Shoah\n\nAnother, deeper silence about gender and the Shoah is the silence about women’s experiences of sexual exploitation during the Shoah (Ringelheim, 1997; Lentin, 1997; 1999a). Positing the ‘split memory’ between gender and the Shoah, Ringelheim argues that sex and all experiences connected with sex, rape, abortion, sexual abuse and pregnancy are intimate parts of women’s lives and therefore never easy to talk about. Facing women survivors’ sexual exploitation confronts us with our own sexual vulnerability as women. And for family members: the rape of mothers, grandmothers, sisters, friends, or lovers during the Holocaust is difficult to face. The further possibility that mothers or sisters or lovers ‘voluntarily’ used sex for food or protection is equally difficult to absorb … but to dismiss situations that relate so specifically to women makes it impossible to begin to understand the victimisation of women. It may even make it impossible to really see Jewish women as victims, or visualise their victimisation. (Ringelheim, 1997: 25)\n\nRingelheim further takes herself to task for not being able to ask a survivor-interviewee what had happened when the survivor told her that she had been raped in Auschwitz, and argues that the incident reveals important things about ‘how deeply [researchers] may not want to hear; and about the ways in which we avoid listening no matter how directly a survivor [male or female] may tell us what happened (e.g., cannibalism, hiding in a latrine, killing new-born babies). Sometimes we avoid because we are afraid; sometimes we avoid because we don’t understand the importance of what is being said’ (Ringelheim, 1997: 27). Despite what seems to me a persuasive argument for the study of gender in relation to the Shoah, opposition to this line of work is alive and well. In 1992 Ringelheim wrote about the antagonism her early research aroused in renowned commentators such as Cynthia Ozick. In 1998, after the publication of Ofer and Weitzman’s anthology, Gabriel Schoenfeld (1998a), writing in Commentary magazine, accused feminist scholars of the Shoah of spreading feminist ‘propaganda’ (Lipstadt, 1998: 12). Replying to articles by feminist scholars of the Shoah in Lilith magazine, Schoenfeld attacked Ringelheim, Linden, Ofer and Weitzman, and Lipstadt for revisionism and for ‘the shameful things that feminist scholars have been writing about the Holocaust’ (Schoenfeld, 1998b: 42). The picture in Israel is not much different. Prominent Israeli Shoah historians (most notably Bauer, 1978; 1980; 1982; 1989; 1994a; Friedländer, 1978; 1982; 1988; 1992; Gutman, 1990, among others) do not consider gender. Only in the late 1990s did Israeli scholars (e.g., Dalia Ofer, in Ofer and Weitzman, 1998; Judith Tydor Baumel, 1999a; 1999b; Adriana Kemp and Hanna Herzog, 1999; and Esther Fuchs, 1999) begin to address the gendered aspects of the Shoah.\n\nLentin-01 8/21/00 11:02 AM Page 15\n\nIntroduction: the territories of silence\n\n15\n\nIsraeli historiography has been enriched by several studies (as mentioned above) of the complex relations between Israelis and the Shoah. While Israelis, these studies argue, were reluctant to accept the alleged passivity of the victims, official Israeli discourses and ceremonies privileged the sporadic armed resistance acts over Shoah victimhood. Segev (1991), Yablonka (1994) and Hacohen (1994) document the ways in which Israelis stigmatised the survivors and discriminated against them. Zertal (1996a) charts the exploitation of the survivors to further the political objectives of the future Israeli state. Grodziusky (1998) documents the ‘zionisation’ of the Shoah as expressed by prestate emissaries to the displaced persons camps. However, while Shapira (1992) and Zertal (1996a) refer, marginally, to the gender implications of the Shoah for the early staters, most other studies tend to be gender-blind. Several studies (e.g., Hazelton, 1978; Sharoni, 1992; 1994; Shohat, 1991; Shadmi, 1992; Boyarin, 1997a; 1997b; 1997c; Gluzman, 1997) argue that Zionism, based on constructing a ‘new Jew’, who would differ from ‘his’ Jewish diaspora ancestors, gave men a newly constructed masculinity with which to re-formulate the diaspora Jewish subjectivity and re-invent it as ‘Israeli’, a construction of which they are extremely critical. However, as I am aware of no other study which links this with the silencing and stigmatisation of Shoah survivors in Israeli society, my aim is to make this link and break the silence about Shoah and gender in the Israeli context. There also appear to be no gender-differentiated sociological studies of Israeli children of survivors (although there have been several psychological studies which incorporate a gender dimension, notably Marcus, 1986; and Wardi, 1990). I centred my research on personal narratives of daughters of Shoah survivors against the backcloth of Israeli society in order to break the silence about the link between Shoah and gender in the Israeli context. Israel and the Daughters of the Shoah is an auto/biographical undertaking in that I share with the narrators a gendered Israeli subjectivity, ‘split’ between belonging to a family of survivors on the one hand, and to the first Israeli-born generation, which was brought up to despise Shoah victims and survivors on the other. Researchers’ ‘intellectual auto/biography’ This brings me to the third territory I wish to re-occupy: the silence, often implicit in sociology, about researchers’ auto/biographical involvement with the material they study. There are some research projects, born, as Liz Stanley (1996) argues, out of ‘necessity’, which carry within them transformatory possibilities for the researcher. If indeed feminist researchers carry out particular research because of\n\nLentin-01 8/21/00 11:02 AM Page 16\n\n16\n\nIsrael & the Daughters of the Shoah\n\nthe resonance between the topic or approach and the personal context of the research, and if indeed our ‘intellectual auto/biography’ (Stanley and Wise, 1993) can explicate, beyond a simple narrative of life ‘as it is lived’, the processes by which understandings are reached, then the myth of the detached scientific observer must be done away with. Instead we have an ‘experiencing because knowing subject’, whose ‘ontologically based reasoning provides the claims to knowledge’ (Stanley, 1996: 47). This volume is a testimony to this duality of experiencing and knowing, a duality, moreover, of a ‘split’ or double subjectivity. Because of my membership of the Israeli ‘first generation to redemption’, which was schooled to despise diaspora Jewry and, by extension, Shoah victims and survivors, it was only while researching this book that I was able to ‘name’ myself a member of a survivor family. During the course of researching and writing these two very conflicting subjectivities became intertwined. Positioning my ‘auto/biographical I’ (Stanley, 1992) at the ontological centre of the study, and basing my research on auto/biographical personal narratives of Israeli daughters of survivors, I argue for the centrality of women’s lived experiences as a ‘scientific resource’ (Harding, 1987). The experience of my split subjectivity has been the ‘necessary’ epistemological and ontological focus informing my research. Auto/biographical personal narratives, particularly narratives of trauma, because of their complex and often fragmented nature, rarely offer us possibilities of conventional sociological validation. Personal narratives cannot stand limited definitions of ‘truth’ that admit only one standard at a time for the perception and interpretation of a small segment of a complex reality. Instead, women’s personal narratives offer the plural truths of experience, history and perceptions, amongst other things, of the construction of a gendered self-identity. Ultimately, women’s personal narratives and the knowledge they impart are ‘as true as our lives’ (Personal Narratives Group, 1989: 262–3). However, if researchers are open to it, auto/biography offers endless performative, but also transformative possibilities, in terms of constructing the self, and often also of transforming society. When I began working, I ‘knew’ several things about Israel and the Shoah, if ‘knew’ is the right word for something perceived instinctively but also experientially. I ‘knew’ that Shoah survivors were denigrated by Israelis in subtle and not so subtle ways. I also ‘knew’ that Israeli society was, and is, a masculine construction built, although women have always been active participants in society, on axioms of ongoing ‘no-choice’ military struggle, which, necessarily, privileges male soldiers who share in the dividends of military, political and social power to the detriment of women. My goal was to link the theorisation of\n\nLentin-01 8/21/00 11:02 AM Page 17\n\nIntroduction: the territories of silence\n\n17\n\nIsrael as a masculine construction with the stigmatisation of Shoah survivors. My instinct was to work with Israeli daughters of survivors who were the first members of the ‘second-generation’ to put their experiences of being children of survivors in the public domain, in artistic form. What I did not ‘know’ prior to beginning work on this book, was how deeply implicated I was in all this. My own parents were not, strictly speaking, Shoah survivors, but most members of their families were deported to Transnistria, a series of ghettos in Southern Ukraine, where some of them perished. When the narrators spoke of coming from ‘silent families’ where one ‘knew and did not know’ about the Shoah at the same time, I did not realise to what extent my own family was such a ‘silent family’. My mother’s insistence, until a very short time ago, that she had never needed to speak of her past life, a life she abandoned at the age of 19 to go to Palestine, was beginning to ring hollow. As I began working on the narratives, I realised, on the one hand, how much she did talk about her Romanian-Bukovinian past. On the other hand, and somewhat contradictorily, I realised just how silent my own parents had been about the Shoah despite having lost several members of their families. Because Mother and her family managed to escape on time, they never saw themselves as survivors – the mantle of Shoah survivors was not lightly assumed (as argued above). As I was researching, the signs of that silence became more and more apparent. The whispered stories of Mother’s relatives who congregated in Grandmother’s sitting room, whispers hushed when we, the Israeliborn children, were about. The compulsive attitudes to food, feeding us too much, worrying when we did not eat enough. My parents’ decision not to speak to us in German, their mother tongue, in which they talked to each other. The need to make constant contact, the fear of separation. As well as Grandmother’s grunting and weeping in her sleep, never quite forgiving herself for having left her own mother behind when she journeyed to Palestine. The family trees I was obsessively drawing with Grandfather when I was a young child. And the shamed refusal to admit to my two Yiddish middle names, given after lost relatives, as Yiddish, the Jewish (Ashkenazi) ‘mother tongue’ (Lentin, 1996a) was erased in favour of Hebrew, our virile old-new language. The realisation that I had always been engaged in ‘researching’ my split subjectivity – in my fiction writing (Lentin, 1976; 1978; 1989; 1996b), but also in my obsessive interest in all Shoah accounts from a very young age – meant that in the course of working on this book, it has become auto/biographical, in the sense of constructing my self and my life through my identification with the narrators’ lived experiences. But there was more. From the very early stages I felt compelled to turn inwards. Like Ruth Linden, upon her return from the American\n\nLentin-01 8/21/00 11:02 AM Page 18\n\n18\n\nIsrael & the Daughters of the Shoah\n\nGathering of Holocaust Survivors, where she collected 200 life histories of survivors, I too kept feeling I was still ‘in the field’ long after I returned from field trips to Israel. Indeed, I had never left the field, because I was the field. This was a ‘liminal time when my social boundaries – the membrane between me and the rest of the world – were fragile and fluid’ (Linden, 1993: 4–5). The narratives forced me to confront the dichotomous relations between my membership of the ‘first generation’ and Shoah survivors. At the same time they made me re-examine my membership of that ‘first generation’ which, having rejected European diaspora Judaism, has in recent years started to re-invent its Jewish roots and diaspora connections. One manifestation of this is the re-claiming by many Israeli children of European parents of their families’ Jewish-European surnames, which they had been coerced in the Israeli Defence Forces (IDF) and other Israeli institutions, to Hebraicise. The narratives brought to mind ‘moments of being’ (Woolf, 1978) from my own life. As a Sabra, exhorted to be a stronger Jewish child, I, like other Israeli-born children, was contemptuous towards relatives who had arrived from ‘there’ and who spoke with a ‘diasporic’ accent.10 During the research process, recalling my youthful contempt towards the survivors, I became conscious of another ‘split’. I had a stake in a sense of belonging to a survivor family on the one hand, and in a profound Israeli guilt towards the survivors on the other. This duality is linked to what psychoanalyst Dinora Pines (1993) quotes Freud as describing as ‘disavowal’ or ‘the blindness of the seeing eye in which one knows and does not know a thing at the same time’ (Freud, 1925: 235). Writing about women survivors whom she saw in analysis, Pines confesses to her own ‘survivor guilt’: ‘I have engaged not only in the rediscovery of my patients’ Holocaust history and its impact on their lives, but also … in the rediscovery of my own. Thus I too am deeply affected by the guilt of the survivor. The sense of psychic continuity that is important to us all was brutally broken in my patients’ lives, but also to some degree in my own’ (Pines, 1993: 223). The study of narrative must struggle with the question of how much one needs to know about others to feel that one can understand something about them. Since ‘life history subjects are… actively inscribed by means of narrative strategies’ (Linden, 1993: 136), no matter how meaningful, researchers can never arrive at a ‘complete’ picture. Narrators are amply expert in organising and creating plots from disordered experiences, and narratives do not mirror a world ‘out there’, but are constructed, creatively authored, rhetorical and interpretative. Auto/biography is a social construct comprising both social reality and the subjects’ experiential world, which is why they raise the question of how to proceed from auto/biographical text to life itself (Rosen-\n\nLentin-01 8/21/00 11:02 AM Page 19\n\nIntroduction: the territories of silence\n\n19\n\nthal, 1993: 60). One clue to this dilemma is to consider life and story as part of the same fabric, in that life informs and is formed by stories. The meaning of life cannot be determined outside of the stories told about it; nor can the meaning of a story be determined without reference to human life as it is lived (Widdershoven, 1993: 2–20). Liz Stanley (1993) provides another clue to the relation between the self (auto), life (bio) and text (graphy). Accounts of the past which constitute the major part of our lives, are structured by means of referential assumptions, but they do so because people are well aware that these are historiographical accounts, not history itself. The process of ‘accounting’ that auto/biographies constitute is an important means of making real and present what we all know is actually memory and past. Stanley stresses that ‘all writing derives from, is the product of, helps to construct lives’. Experiential claims are not less, but certainly not more, problematic than other kinds of knowledgeclaims, and both narrative and ‘experience’ are suitable grounds for analytic investigation (ibid.,: 206). Ultimately, she argues, ‘whatever rhetorical means, the experiential basis of knowledge is denied or silenced, nonetheless all knowledge of the world is rooted in the knowledge-production processes, engaged in by inquiring and experiencing therefore knowing subjects’ (ibid.,: 214). One way of illuminating women’s multiple realities is to elicit the narrative realities behind societal patterns. Personal narratives of Israeli daughters of Shoah survivors are one way of re-interpreting the dichotomy between ‘masculine’ Israel and the ‘feminised’ Shoah and of breaking the silence about the stigmatisation of the survivors in Israeli society. Starting from a feminist perspective of a woman (who is also a sociologist and a fiction writer) researching other women (who are fiction writers and film-makers) with whom she has much in common, my research strategy was dialogic. The resulting narratives are therefore the product of the interaction between the narrators and me, gendered situated subjects within the Israeli ‘second-generation’ ontology. As an embodied, located subject, who is herself split between two Israeli subjectivities, that of an Israeli-born and that of a daughter of a Shoah-surviving family, I find myself thinking, and writing, in a multiplicity of voices – those of the sociologist, the writer, the Israeli, the Jewish woman, the exile, the daughter of a survivor family, the feminist, to name but a few. My narrators, some of them similarly ‘split’, also speak in multiple voices: we are all, in important ways, ‘multiple personalities’ (see Scott, 1997). The concerns with auto/biography, Stanley (1992) argues, teaches us that ‘the self ’ is a fabrication. It is not a lie, but a highly complex truth, which relies on cultural conventions and depends on or derives from a particularly socially located viewpoint.\n\nLentin-01 8/21/00 11:02 AM Page 20\n\n20\n\nIsrael & the Daughters of the Shoah\n\nI chose to write about writers and film-makers since in my own fictional writing I have been engaged in ‘researching’ my Israeli split subjectivity just as the narrators have been ‘researching’ their ontology as Israeli daughters of Shoah survivors. The narrators’ stories are ‘stories-within-stories’ and ‘stories-about-stories’, told to me by women who are themselves story-tellers, about their own lives and their parents’ Shoah survival and post-Shoah Israeli stories, enabling them, and me, to ‘make our lives’ as we make our stories. Ultimately the narratives are not only a ‘collection of stories’, dependent on the researcher’s location and identities as knower, but representations of a reality, problematic, partial, mediated, uncertain and ambiguous as it may be, which does indeed exist (Linden, 1996: 12).\n\n‘Breaking the conspiracy of silence’ Israel and the Daughters of the Shoah uses personal narratives and a feminist re-reading of Zionist/Israeli discourses to ask whether, in the context of the gendered construction of nation, we can speak about a ‘masculinisation’ of Israel and, conversely, a resultant ‘feminisation’ of the Shoah and Shoah survivors. The process began with my ‘theory’ of the gendered relationship between Israel and the Shoah. The next stage was to conduct qualitative open-ended interviews with nine Israeli daughters of Shoah survivors who are writers and film-makers. Their ensuing auto/biographical personal narratives largely confirmed my ‘theory’. However, gender was not uppermost in their minds; they were more concerned with being daughters of Shoah survivors in Israeli society. Therefore, another methodological strategy was brought in. A critical feminist re-reading of Zionist and Israeli discourses, official and unofficial, confirmed, at a different discursive level, my theory of the masculinisation of Israel versus the feminisation of the Shoah and its survivors, and further contributed to breaking the silences surrounding the encounter between Israel and Shoah survivors. Structurally, because it is data-driven, the book begins with a presentation of the narratives (chapters 2 and 3). I use two narrative presentation strategies: chapter 2 presents Nava Semel’s narrative in its entirety. I have chosen Semel’s narrative not as an ‘ideal type’ but rather as a ‘key story’ to the interpretation of the other stories. The trajectory it presents, from being a silenced child of Shoah survivors, stigmatised in the new state of Israel, and at the same time a member of the first Israeli generation, to being a writer who is re-interpreting the puzzle of her Shoah daughterhood, resonated most with my own trajectory. I have chosen, with the narrators’ full permission, not to mask their identities. Social scientists often define anonymity and confidentiality\n\nLentin-01 8/21/00 11:02 AM Page 21\n\nIntroduction: the territories of silence\n\n21\n\nas ethical issues employed in order to protect research subjects and guide researchers’ conduct. Anonymity often masks cultural constructions of privacy and power, and negotiating the terms of inscription with our narrators can introduce ‘an unprecedented level of accountability into ethnographic writing’ (Linden, 1993: 111). The narrators, all of whom are prominent writers or film-makers, gave me permission to use their names, and I have chosen to present the nine narratives, in chapter 3, as a combined text, thematically divided for meanings, rather than treat them as individual narratives, precisely because the narratives present a ‘collective story’ (Richardson, 1990), in that their accounts examine the construction of a female subjectivity through their interaction with Israeli society and Israeli historiography of the Shoah. In their work they challenge the cultural dichotomous stereotypes of Israelis versus Shoah survivors, and offer an alternative ‘counter’ narrative. The main themes presented by the narratives are narrators’ experiences of the silencing of Shoah experiences in their families and in Israeli society; their construction as gendered players in the Shoah commemoration trajectory, which stressed acts of resistance above passive victimhoood; the differences between the ways their mothers and their fathers communicated their Shoah experiences; the stigmatisation of their parents and their own stigmatisation in Israeli society; the narrators’ own ‘otherness’ as writers or film-makers and the mixed critical reaction to their work; and the reasons why they chose to put their stories on Israel’s cognitive map and thus ‘break the conspiracy of silence’. As narratives are meaning-making structures, they must be preserved, not fractured, by investigators, who ‘must respect respondents’ ways of constructing meaning and analyse how it is accomplished’ (Riessman, 1993: 4–5). This is not as simple as it sounds, and ethnographers are often tempted to conflate narrators’ words with their own interpretations, by either effacing their own subjectivities, or by concealing the circumstances of text production under a ‘scientific’ mantle. Employing a dialogic approach, I have opted to include ‘verbatim materials … sufficient to allow the reader some direct participation’ (Myerhoff, 1980: 31). I have, however, ‘heavily edited and selected, inevitably’ those verbatim materials, assuming a stance of authority, although there is also dialogism at work, in that all parties involved – writer, reader and informant – participate in the text (Kaminsky, 1992: 7). Ethnography, undoubtedly a text, is also a fiction, to the extent of its production by a social scientist who is also a fiction writer, or as Stanley (1992) suggests, a ‘fabrication’. Because the point of view of the researcher and the researched do not always coincide, I have used several text presentation styles: the narrators speaking in the first person, the text producer speaking in the third person about\n\nLentin-01 8/21/00 11:02 AM Page 22\n\n22\n\nIsrael & the Daughters of the Shoah\n\nthe narrators, and both speaking in the recorded conversation sections. I have translated the narrative text from the Hebrew, my (and most of the narrators’) mother tongue, in which I prefer to ‘speak of intimate things’ (Spivak, 1992: 187). While unable to translate literally, I have attempted to retain the flavour of the Hebrew language, trying to retain the narrators’ sentence structure wherever possible. In the remainder of the volume I use a variety of other strategies to theorise silence and the dichotomous relation between the ‘masculinisation’ of Israel and the ensuing feminisation of the Shoah. In particular, I ground the masculinisation thesis in Zionist and early nation-building texts (e.g., Herzl, 1896; Nordau, 1955 [1909]; Bialik, 1960 [1902]; Ya’ari, 1947 [1918]; Lamdan, 1927) and seek ‘theoretical’ confirmation in theorists such as Goffman (1968) and Bauman (1991) as well as theorists of masculinity such as Boyarin (1997a; 1997b; 1997c), Gluzman (1997) and Mosse (1996). However, because the narratives are my main data, the themes I explore in chapters 4, 5 and 6 have been suggested to me by the narratives and are grounded in and inspired by the narratives. Chapter 4 analyses the history of Shoah commemoration and ‘memorisation’ and links its various stages to my own auto/biography. The trajectory begins with contempt for the survivors for their alleged passivity and my own inability to listen to my relatives’ stories as a child and young person. At the age of forty I travelled to Romania to research those very stories which ended up in my novel Night Train to Mother (Lentin, 1989, 1990), an account of the ‘intimate memory’ which the Israeli Shoah commemoration machinery did not privilege until quite recently. Chapter 5 discusses the pathologisation of the survivors and of the ‘second-generation’ in the literature and in Israeli society and criticises the tendency to silence survivors’ accounts as part of a uniformity self-imposed upon Israeli society which negated the diaspora and mobilised the Shoah to the Zionist cause. Chapter 6 posits a theoretical construction of the feminisation and fem(m)inisation (with double m, after Boyarin 1997a; 1997b, in the sense of the femme in the femme-butch pair) of stigma in the relationship between Israel and the Shoah. Because the stigmatisation of the survivors, and of their children, was a central theme brought up by all the narrators, I draw on Goffman’s theory of stigma as an instrument used by ‘normal’ society for social grading, defining itself in turn (Goffman, 1968), and on Bauman’s argument that stigma is a convenient weapon in the defence against the unwelcome ambiguity of strangers, the ‘ambivalent third’ in the ‘friends’ versus ‘enemies’ binary opposition (Bauman, 1991). I argue that Israeli society, privileging militarism and discourses of ‘national security’, premised on a dominance-ori-\n\nLentin-01 8/21/00 11:02 AM Page 23\n\nIntroduction: the territories of silence\n\n23\n\nented masculine structure (Connell, 1994: 158), constructed itself as ‘friend’ in opposition to the Palestinian ‘enemy’. Negating the Jewish exile, Israel stigmatised Shoah survivors, necessarily cast as ambivalent strangers who did not conform to the stereotypically active, fighting, masculine ‘new Hebrew’ norm, reintroducing instead ‘old’ Jewish values which threatened that new norm. The ‘new Hebrew’ hegemonic masculinity used nation-imagining discourses to silence and stigmatise Shoah survivors, thus contributing to its own dominance and to the survivors’ subordinate position. The Zionist reconstruction of the ‘new Hebrews’ in opposition to diasporic Jewry also resulted, as argued by Ben Dor and Kaplanski (1988), Segev (1991), and Yablonka (1994), in discriminating against them when they first arrived. The more complex argument of the fem(m)inisation of that stigma derives from the internalisation of the ‘masculine’ construction of the ‘new Hebrews’ and the ‘emasculation’ of diaspora Jews. In constructing what it means to be ‘Israeli’, Israeli society, anxious about its own fitness for a role of authority, assumed hegemonic masculine norms and adopted a stigmatising classification system of dominance and subordination. This system divided between the masculine ‘normals’, Israeli-born, or those who could ‘pass’ as Israeli-born, and the feminine stigmatised, newly arrived survivors (and, later, Jewish immigrants from Arab countries).11 To illustrate this fem(m)inisation, I analyse the popular text ‘My sister on the beach’ by the Palmach prestate army commander Yitzhak Sadeh (1945). A story of an encounter between a young female survivor and a group of pre-state soldiers, Sadeh’s account signifies the new Hebrews’ deep terror of diaspora Jewry. According to Zertal (1996a: 490–6), who employs Freud’s Unheimlich thesis, the diaspora returned to haunt the Erez Israeli masculinity not because of its unfamiliarity, but as its repressed, unconscious, feminine ‘other’.\n\nCounter-narratives: auto/biography as an act of reckoning Israel and the Daughters of the Shoah appears to be the first sociological attempt to link the ‘masculinisation’ of the ‘new Hebrews’ with diaspora-negation and the stigmatisation and feminisation of Shoah survivors. Working auto/biographically with personal narratives of daughters of Israeli Shoah survivors (and thus closing the ‘memory gap’ between ontology and representation), as well as re-reading Zionist discourses from a feminist perspective, I am better able to make sense of the history of contemporary Israel and its relationship with the Shoah, as discussed in chapter 6. If the construction of the mas-\n\nLentin-01 8/21/00 11:02 AM Page 24\n\n24\n\nIsrael & the Daughters of the Shoah\n\nculine ‘new Hebrew’ subjectivity discursively stigmatised the survivors and feminised the Shoah, the writings of the narrators may indicate a shift of emphasis towards greater complexity and inclusiveness in the parameters of Israeli ‘normality’. According to Bauman (1991) ambivalence is the only option for modernity; narrator Karmit Gai argues that the present stage is characterised by Israelis realising that ‘otherness’ is a universal Israeli condition ‘because, after all, no one fitted the mould’. It has taken Israel forty years to begin the act of reckoning its complex relationship with the Shoah, in relation not only to the huge loss, but also to the uses made of the Shoah in nation-building and in justifying the ongoing conflict and occupation. Likewise, it has taken many individual Shoah survivors forty years – a generation – to be able to begin to speak of their experiences. The narrators began writing their ‘daughters of survivors’ accounts in the mid-1980s, forty years after the end of the War. Their books and films are auto/biographical enterprises as much as this book is my own auto/biographical project. They are also acts of reckoning which, like all auto/biograpical projects, reinterpret the past, but in important ways, also envision the future. Emphasising the constantly changing and contested nature of the boundaries of the nation and its narratives, Homi Bhabha (1994) posits counter-narratives, emerging from the nation’s margins, from cultural and national hybrids, which slot, albeit none too smoothly, into the ‘inter-national’ space of the stranger, between ‘enemies’ and ‘friends’. The accounts by Israeli children, and particularly daughters of Shoah survivors, which present anti-heroic antagonists to the heroic Zionist narration of nation, are such counter-narratives, as argued in chapter 7. Despite the hurt, despite the stigmatisation and the silencing, daughter-writers speak of their deep need to write, and deal, even unconsciously, with the presence of the Shoah in their lives. The creative works by children of survivors have been described by narrators as ‘breaking the conspiracy of silence’. Nava Semel borrows Shoah imagery when she likens the compulsion to turn her mother’s experiences into stories to ‘forced labour’ (Semel, 1986: 44). The real work of mourning the Shoah has not yet seriously begun in Israeli society, despite the proliferation of public memorials, ceremonies and publications. I do not wish to argue, simplistically, that only women are able to mourn the Shoah without drawing nationalist lessons from the annihilation of Europe’s Jews. But I do argue that through the auto/biographical accounts of my narrators’ post-Shoah experiences, I am able to sustain an argument on the gendered relationship between Israel and the Shoah. My own auto/biographical project, of research and of writing fiction about the experience of being a daughter of a family of Shoah survivors, has enabled me not\n\nLentin-01 8/21/00 11:02 AM Page 25\n\nIntroduction: the territories of silence\n\n25\n\nonly to make my self while telling my story, but also to mourn, by engaging in the auto/biographical act of reckoning. As Stanley (1993) puts it, the process of ‘reckoning’, or ‘accounting’, that auto/biographies constitute, is an important means of making real and present what we all know is memory and past. Perhaps the writing, by the narrators and by me, is the consequence of the shifting boundaries of silence about the Shoah, not the cause. However, I have little doubt that the narrators’ works have been instrumental counter-narratives in re-occupying some territories of silence in relation to the legacy of the Shoah in Israeli society, and therefore in beginning the long process of reckoning and mourning.\n\nNotes 1. Lea Aini has drawn my attention (personal communication, March 2000) that she has progressed away from the anger and despair of her 1992 interview with me. I am certain that other narrators have also moved on, as has Israeli society, although I believe my views as expressed in this volume are still valid, as I hope the narrators would broadly agree. 2. My use of the term ‘ontology’ in this book draws on Stanley and Wise, who define ‘feminist ontology’ as the theory of ‘reality’ or being, which rejects Cartesian binary ways of understanding the relationship between the body, the mind and emotions (Stanley and Wise, 1993: 194–5). 3. Erez Israel, literally ‘the land of Israel’, refers to the pre-state entity in Palestine, governed, between 1919 and 1948, by the British, under a special mandate. 4. I do not italicise the word Shoah, as I do other Hebrew words. When citing other works I have left the term ‘Holocaust’. 5. Dr Rudolf Israel Kästner, the Hungarian Jewish leader, managed, through negotiations with the Nazis, to rescue 1,685 Jews who went on a train to Switzerland. This operation was the subject of a trial in 1954 (see chapter 4). For a discussion of Kästner’s changing image as a testimony to the changing image of the Shoah, see Ofer, 1993 and Weitz, 1993. 6. I follow Helen Fein in using the term ‘antisemitism’ rather than ‘anti-Semitism’. This, according to Fein, implies more than dropping the hyphen; it means taking antisemitism seriously as a thesis without an antithesis, for there is no ‘Semitism’ (Fein, 1987: ix) 7. There are also many historical studies of the relations between the pre-state Erez Israeli Yishuv leadership and the Shoah, e.g., Bet Zvi, 1977; Porat, 1986; Shapira, 1992; Eshkoli, 1994; Weitz, 1994; Zertal, 1996a,; Grodzinski, 1998. 8. Shoah denial plays a role in every organisation and periodical which is overtly or covertly antisemitic and is often used to mask antisemitism. While French and German laws against Shoah denial have some effect, deniers find other means. Thus Ernst Zundel in Canada, against whom legal means were employed to end his Shoah-denial activities, has turned Canada into a major centre for denial material. Using books, newsletters, videotapes, cable and public access television and the internet, his material appears in fifteen languages in forty countries. However, an American-Jewish Committee-funded survey in the US, Germany, Australia and Poland, found that denial has little impact on mainstream opinion and remains the preserve of hardened antisemites (Antisemitism\n\nLentin-01 8/21/00 11:02 AM Page 26\n\n26\n\nIsrael & the Daughters of the Shoah\n\nWorld Report, 1995: xix). For a comprehensive survey of Shoah denial see Lipstadt, 1993. 9. Some notable examples of studies written by male historians and making no gender connections are Arad et al., 1981; Bauer, 1982; Gilbert, 1985; Gutman, 1990; to name but a few. Lucy Dawidowicz’s study (1975) also makes no gender links. However, there have been several studies of women in the Shoah, e.g., Rittner and Roth, 1993; Ofer and Weitzman, 1998; Lagerwey, 1998; Fuchs, 1999; Baumel, 1999a, 1999b. 10. The importance of the ‘right’, that is Sabra Hebrew accent, is developed in chapter 6. See also Almog, 1998. 11. Gluzman, 1997, discusses the parallel between women and Palestinians in early Zionist writings.\n\nLentin-02 8/21/00 11:03 AM Page 27\n\nCHAPTER 2\n\n‘WRITING IS THE CLOSING OF CIRCLES’\n\nIntroduction I met Nava Semel on 25 November, 1992 in the apartment she shares with her husband Noam Semel, director of the Tel Aviv Cameri Theatre, and their three children, Iyar and twins Eal-Eal and Nimdor. Semel was born in 1954 in Tel Aviv. Her father, Itzhak Artzi, a former Knesset member and deputy mayor of Tel Aviv, was born in Bukovina and is not a concentration camp survivor. Her mother, Margalit (Mimi) Artzi (nee Liquornik), also born in Bukovina, is a survivor of several concentration camps, including Auschwitz and Kleineshenau. The twins, born in the United States while Noam Semel served with the Israeli consulate in New York, have U.S. passports. ‘This too is part of my being a daughter of survivors’, Semel explained, ‘at least when the helicopters come to rescue the survivors here, they would be saved’. Semel’s brother, Shlomo Artzi, is a leading Israeli popular singer. Semel is small, short-haired, and very intense. Her use of the Hebrew language is very precise. She had obviously done a lot of thinking about being a daughter of Shoah survivors and has written both fiction and journalism on the subject. Nava Semel describes her childhood as an ‘ordinary Israeli childhood’. She served in the army as a news producer with Galei Tsahal, the army radio channel. She began writing when she had her first child. Her collection of short stories, the first ‘second-generation’ fiction collection published in Israel, Kova Zekhukhit (‘A Hat of Glass’) (1985), met with a wall of silence when it first appeared, but has since been written about extensively. The collection was re-issued in 1998 with\n\nLentin-02 8/21/00 11:03 AM Page 28\n\n28\n\nIsrael & the Daughters of the Shoah\n\nan introduction by the literary critic Nurit Govrin. Several stories have been translated into English, German, Spanish, Turkish and French and translations appeared in Germany and Italy in 2000. In all of the stories there is a ‘child of ’ persona and they are all based on the various stages of learning about and coming to terms with her parents’ survival, as Semel explains in the following narrative. Indeed, in all of her books, the reality is often viewed from a child’s viewpoint. Her one-woman play Hayeled meAchorei Haeinayim (The Child Behind the Eyes) (1987), a monologue of a mother of a Down’s Syndrome child, had many showings in Israel and abroad and several radio broadcasts internationally. In 1996 it won the Austrian radio play of the year award. Her two novels for young people, Gershona Shona (Becoming Gershona) (1988/1990), and Maurice Havivel Melamed Lauf (Flying Lessons) (1991/1995)1 deal with young people living among Shoah survivors in search of an Israeli identity. Both were translated into English. In 1996 Flying Lessons was selected in Germany as one of the thirty best books of the year. The novel Rali Masa Matara (‘Night Games’) (1993) is the story of a group of Israeli forty-something friends playing a treasure hunt on the 1987 Day of Independence, half a year before the Intifada broke out. The novel Isha al Neyar (‘Bride on Paper’) (1996) tells of life in a pre-state Israeli moshava (collective settlement) in the 1930s. Semel also translates plays, mostly on Shoah-related themes. In 1996 Semel won the Prime Minister’s Award, a twelve-month writing scholarship. In 1999 she collaborated with her father in writing his biography (Artzi and Semel, 1999), documenting the story of a young Zionist journeying from Europe to Israel, as well as writing the script for a documentary film on Transnistria, based on her journey to Southern Ukraine in 1998 (Simionovics, 1999). The film was screened by Israel Education Television in 1999. After our initial meeting, which proved seminal to writing this book, Semel and I remained in close contact. I have chosen to present her entire narrative not as an ‘ideal type’, but because it seems to be the ‘key story’ to the interpretation of the other narratives. The narrative encompasses most of the elements highlighted by the other narrators and theorised in later chapters. These include breaking the silence surrounding the Shoah and Shoah survivors, the confrontation between the Jewish Shoah and Israel’s ‘new Hebrews’, ceremonial memory versus intimate memory and the ‘masculinised’ Israeli ‘normality’ versus the stigmatisation of Shoah survivors. Moreover, perhaps because my parents, like her parents, came from Bukovina, the trajectory Semel’s narrative presents, her ‘thematic field’, from the split subjectivity of being a silenced child of survivors, stigmatised in the new state of Israel, and a member of (our) first Sabra generation, to\n\nLentin-02 8/21/00 11:03 AM Page 29\n\n‘Writing is the closing of circles’\n\n29\n\nbeing a writer who is re-interpreting the puzzle of Shoah daughterhood, resonates most with my own trajectory. Semel has been central to my work, not in the sense of being a ‘key informant’, nor in the sense of being a ‘co-author’, but our collaboration raises important issues about voice and authorship. Like the other narrators, Semel has been engaged in ‘researching’ the meaning of being a daughter of Shoah survivors in Israeli society, and, like the other narrators, she is a ‘woman of voice’, who has broken the silence about the Shoah in her own family and in Israeli society by writing herself onto Israel’s cognitive map. The feminist strategy of ‘giving voice’ to voiceless people might seem superfluous, if it were not for Semel’s and the other narrators’ recurring stories about silence. While this book is based on their narratives, ‘it is the researcher who narrates, who “authors” the ethnography’ (Stacey, 1991: 23). The question of authority and authorship is particularly thorny when researchers insist on a collaboration process with their informants, but ultimately produce the research text themselves, no matter how modified or influenced by the narrators. My work with Nava Semel and the other narrators was dialogic, yet the question of ‘giving voice’ remains open. Dialogue as a research strategy employs Myerhoff ’s notion (1992) of the ‘third voice’, born by the virtue of the collusion between researcher – a sociological narrator, embodied, situated and ultimately responsible for her own words, her own ‘multiple selves’ – and narrators. Although (mostly in reply to my questioning) Semel does deal with the gender element of Israeli Shoah metaphors and commemoration, gender is not her prime concern. Her narrative does, however, serve to illustrate the extent to which both the Shoah and Israel are gendered constructs. Furthermore, Semel’s viewpoint is continuously gendered: she refers to herself first as daughter, then as mother and wife. The stages of self-identification as the daughter of a Shoah survivor and the parallel process of writing her first collection of short stories, are closely linked with stereotypical gender roles. She first hears of her mother’s experience in the kitchen, while her mother is ironing: mothers and daughters seem to communicate in a special way in kitchens. The second time is when she brings a boyfriend home, another gendered rite of passage. Semel describes them as ‘guests’ in her mother’s living room, where refreshments are being served and the mother’s Shoah experience is offered to her daughter, through the boyfriend. She first begins to write when she has a baby and is ‘isolated’, in a ‘bubble’ with her new baby, while her husband is busy with a new job. Her writing begins in parallel to the experience of young motherhood and continues in parallel with older, more experienced motherhood, when it is no longer ‘in a bubble’, but part of a routine which includes taking and collecting her young twins from kindergarten and\n\nLentin-02 8/21/00 11:03 AM Page 30\n\n30\n\nIsrael & the Daughters of the Shoah\n\nlater school, feeding them, worrying about her adolescent, and later soldier, son and so on. In imparting her narrative, Semel makes the construction of her gender identity transparent. Theorising it, she positions the masculine state vis-à-vis the individual self, although she seems to ‘buy into’ accepted discursive norms when she rejects my suggestion that fighting women models are essentially masculine models, offering instead a ‘unisex’ fighter-model. Semel’s narrative is clearly organised and channels to one central thematic field, which occupies the final part of the narrative, the trajectory from (a) what Semel describes as ‘the position of the rejected’, the embodiment of the offspring of the diaspora Jew, the survivor, the ‘lamb to the slaughter’; to (b) learning ‘to live in peace with what there is’. In other words, a trajectory from being a silenced child of survivors, living with the secret world of the ‘code word Auschwitz’, in an Israel which internalised, yet repressed, the memory of the Shoah, to an adult writer who is using her writing as the ‘closing of circles’. The process of using her writing as a means of coming to terms with her ‘daughterhood’ begins with writing compulsively, in order to confront the ‘black hole’, the ‘code word’, and to break the silence and close the circle. Only years after ‘A Hat of Glass’, can the daughter-writer write less densely, less compulsively, her writing more integrated into her daily life. The Shoah, however, keeps occupying centre stage even when the writer believes she has written it out of her system. But it is now more casually mentioned, seeping into the plots almost unnoticeably. Parallel to the narrative about writing, is the narrative about self-discovery, a growth narrative beginning with the story of a girl with eating problems, who sees herself as a victim, and developing into the story of a woman, a mother, who learns to accept and ‘live peacefully with what there is’, using her writing as an indispensable aid in this growth process. The narrative presented here is broken into five main sections. The sectioning was self-evident, since Semel ordered her narrative expertly, both chronologically and thematically. All I did was add sub-headings. The first section, ‘An ordinary Israeli childhood’, is Semel’s own presentation of her biography. It begins with an assumption of ordinariness, but what is described as ‘an ordinary Israeli childhood’ transpires to be ‘normal’ only in the sense of a counter-narrative to the hegemonic masculine Israeli ‘normality’ to be described in chapter 6. It is, in fact, the exact opposite of that ‘normality’ and demonstrates that no Israeli actually fitted the hegemonic mould. Very soon after the beginning of Semel’s narrative, we are clearly into secrets, silences, ‘black holes’, ‘code words’; everything that is not a ‘born in Israel’ normality, if such a thing exists. The second section, ‘Writing’, deals with the parallel processes of ‘writing stories’ and ‘making selves’: the processes involve Semel’s self-\n\nLentin-02 8/21/00 11:03 AM Page 31\n\n‘Writing is the closing of circles’\n\n31\n\ndiscovery and identification as a daughter of Shoah survivors through discovering her mother’s Shoah survival ‘stories’, and at the same time making these stories her own by formally writing them as ‘short stories’. This section demonstrates how the process of self-discovery is also the process of distillation and creation. The third section, ‘Ceremonial versus intimate memory’, building on topics highlighted through the narrative-about-narratives (stories), deals with the juxtaposition of ceremonial versus intimate Shoah memory. Here too, the personal weaves in with the public, culminating in the account of the negative critical reception for’A Hat of Glass’ by an Israel which, in 1985, was not yet ready to confront the Shoah. In the fourth section, ‘The process of repression’, which begins with an attempt to generalise from the previous section, Semel focuses on the intimate and personal, and discusses childhood secrets and their implications. Here, again, the painfully personal touches upon the core issues of the contradictions between the conceptual Israel and the conceptual Shoah. The final section, ‘Writing is the closing of circles’, returns to the process of writing and completes the central argument that only through writing was Semel able to complete the trajectory and face the shame and guilt involved in being a daughter of survivors in contemporary Israel, and, using the bricks of her life, to close the circles. The narrative is produced through the interaction between Semel and myself. Throughout the narrative she addresses me and asks me for confirmation: ‘do you understand?’ ‘do you remember?’ ‘think of a home in the 1950s, ‘it’s part of what you called at the beginning of our conversation … the Israeli historiography’, ‘do you know how it feels?’ The direct reference to me is sharpest when Semel refers to a character in a book as coming from Gura Humora, my father’s birthplace. Or when she speaks of her triumph in allowing her children not to eat when they do not feel like it, and throwing food out. We share the same psychic ‘data bank’ relating to memory and to food, and she does not have to elaborate in order for me to understand exactly what she is talking about; our identification is symbiotic. Life stories are indeed not finished products ready to be ‘served up’ on demand, but evolve around a thematic topic, usually established by the interviewer, in a manner judged by the narrator to be of interest to the listener (Rosenthal, 1993: 65). Although I tried to keep the conversation as open-ended as possible, my theoretical focus, that of juxtaposing Israel and the Shoah as gendered, did influence the narratives. Throughout our conversation I commen"
