        "text": "Jews and Judaism in Modern China explores and compares the dynamics at work in two of the oldest – and starkly contrasting – intact civilizations on earth: Jewish and Chinese. The book studies how they interact in modernity and how each views the other, and analyzes areas of cooperation between scholars, activists and politicians. Through evaluation of the respective talents, qualities and social assets that are fused and borrowed in the socioeconomic, intellectual and cultural exchanges, we gain an insight into the social processes underpinning two dissimilar and long-surviving civilizations. Identifying and analyzing some of the emerging current issues, this book suggests that Jewish–Chinese relations may become a growing discipline of importance to the study of religion and comparative identity, and looks at how the significant contrasts in Jewish and Chinese national constructs may serve them well in the quest for a meaningful discourse. Chapters explore identity, integrity of the family unit, minority status, religious freedom, ethics and morality, tradition versus modernity, the environment, and other areas which are undergoing profound transformation. Identifying the intellectual and practical nexus and bifurcation between the two cultures, worldviews and identities, this work is indispensable for students of Chinese Studies, sociology, religion and the Jewish Diaspora, and provides useful reading for Western tourists to China.

The opportunity he provided for me to remain as an honorary professor at the Center, while allowing me the flexibility to travel more frequently and pursue other academic horizons, is greatly appreciated. His leadership of the Center will no doubt be understood by historians as a critical factor in the development of Jewish–Chinese intellectual relations. I am also indebted to my students at Shandong University, who served as a canvas and a sounding board for the many thoughts and theories developed while teaching. As the Talmud says, “from all my students I have studied”; in this case, they afforded a unique opportunity to view and even interrogate the internal dynamics of Chinese intellectual life, in one of the most interesting phases of its development. Thanks to my research assistant and doctoral candidate Tang Maoqin, “Dottie”, for her efforts in sourcing interesting and useful bibliographic material for this book; and to Wang Yan, another doctoral candidate, studying Maimonides’ conception of dogma, whose willingness to share his critical readings of Chinese history and thought afforded me, over long discussions, access to many layers of Chinese life and eclectic Chinese writers and thinkers otherwise inaccessible. Thanks to Mr David Baumel, a resident of Jinan and a frequent guest at my Sabbath table, who read the chapter entitled “Diaspora, identity and relationship with the homeland”, and offered important comments and thoughts. Appreciation goes to Dr Nir Avieli of Ben Gurion University of the Negev, who read through the chapter entitled “Food, identity, Jews and Chinese” and offered important support and comments. Here I would like to extend my thanks and esteem to Professor Irene Eber of Hebrew University for agreeing to review earlier incarnations of some chapters and for offering invaluable suggestions on style and content. I am grateful to her for extending her time and wisdom in other areas of Jewish–Chinese relations for my benefit. Thanks to Dr Saloman Wald of the Jewish People Policy Planning Institute in Jerusalem, who also reviewed some of my work and offered his criticism and thoughts. Life has its winding tracks and trails, and one evening during the writing of this book I received a telephone call out of the blue from a lady who now called herself Lin Jie. She had been living in Wuhan in southern China for five years, and had just moved with her husband to Beijing to take up new employment. Twenty-five years earlier she had been my geography teacher, had taken exceptional interest in my\n\nxii Acknowledgments intellectual development and was, at the time, a source of encouragement to pursue my whims and intellectual fancies. Despite a twenty-five-year hiatus, she was quick to offer her assistance and reviewed a number of chapters of this book for content and style, for which I am indebted and grateful. I had the distinct pleasure of playing host to and/or meeting a number of visiting Jewish scholars and ambassadors to China who provided me with insight and encouragement in my work. They included Israeli ambassadors Ms Ora Namir, Dr Yehoyada Haim and Mr Amos Nadai; Rabbis Selwyn Franklin and Marvin Tokayer; and Professors Elliot Wolfson (New York University), Hanan Eshel (Hebrew University), Adam Ferziger (Bar Ilan), Jay Harris (Harvard), Suzanne Rutland (University of Sydney), Sylvia Barak Fishman (Brandeis), Steven Katz (Boston University), Dan Laor (Tel Aviv University) and Lihi Yariv-Laor (Hebrew University), Nathan Ehrlich (Baltimore Hebrew College), Ghil’ad Zuckerman (University of Queensland), Yom Tov Assis (Hebrew University), Haim Rabinowitch (Rector of Hebrew University) and more. I am grateful to Mr Noam Urbach and his wife Efrat for their hospitality over Sabbaths and festivals I spent at their home in Jinan, over the two years Noam spent at the Center teaching Hebrew. Here I express thanks to Mr Harry Triguboff, AO, of Australia who supported various projects and scholarships and helped me implement a number of initiatives in Chinese Jewish studies. It will be the job of future generations of scholars to understand the impact these efforts have on Jewish–Chinese relations. His foresight is greatly appreciated; and I look forward, with his assistance, to building a fund with deeper pockets to extend the reach of Jewish–Chinese studies. I would like to thank Shiri Rosenbaum, who during the last phase of the completion of this book accompanied me back to China and transformed my precarious life and house into a warm and vibrant Jewish home, especially over Sabbath and festivals when guests often visited. Chinese salaries are somewhat modest, and the ability to understand Chinese life in all its forms, and to take advantage of my time to travel, research, participate in and traverse as many areas, regions, classes and fields of the Chinese experience as possible, required financial means for which I am grateful to my parents, Professor Frederick and Shirley Rose Ehrlich, for steadfastly ensuring I never lacked. It is the largess of their support that allowed me to maximize my time in China and to ensure, when not off the beaten track, an uncompromisingly high quality of life. Their continued interest in my activities, visits to China, travels with me to regions of interest, and steadfast support on matters big and small will be with me as a rock for ever. My brothers and sisters and their partners continue to offer their assistance, places to stay around the world, and support in various ways. Here I would like to thank them: Paul and Lauren, Rachel and Gaby, Simon and Rebecca, Adam and Valli, Miriam and Tzachi. Their growing families of already eighteen souls are a new generation with diverse interests, some even studying Chinese. Perhaps, as the focus of generations of Jews changes, they may find something valuable in these pages, and to them this book is dedicated.\n\nIntroduction to modern Jewish–Chinese relations\n\nAs we shall see in the pages of this book, Jewish–Chinese Relations is an emerging discipline with fascinating facets illuminating inquiries into comparative civilization, philosophy, politics and religion. It was my intention in Jews and Judaism in Modern China to cover the main areas of Jewish–Chinese interaction in modernity, but owing to various arbitrary limitations, and to a multitude of new ideas and fields of relevance which occurred to me as I wrote, it now appears that this goal will take more time and more volumes to achieve. Though touched on by way of introduction, a series of new subjects now present themselves as deserving more thorough investigation. They include the areas where Jewish civilization, Jews and Judaism contribute to and interact with Confucianism, Marxism, and the variety of challenges facing modern China – the integrity of the family unit, human rights, minority status, religious freedom, ethics and morality, the often opposing forces of tradition vs modernity, the environment and other areas that are undergoing profound transformation. Treated within the crucible of Jewish history and thought, but often using polar conceptions and antithetical intellectual techniques for redress, the Jewish perspective can both contribute to and also learn from the Chinese perspective. These perspectives may converge to generate synthesized models and insightful social theory for the twenty-first century. It is towards this end that future volumes and, to some extent, the present volume are directed. The subject of religion in China presents many unique opportunities to understand religious dynamics. Chinese society developed without many of the stimuli and processes common in the West, and without monotheistic or biblical influences; so the opportunity to observe how certain ideas affect Chinese society and how certain combinations and fusions of ideas succeed in dominating the social landscape affords much insight into the study of religion and civilization. Because of its axial status in the formation of Christianity and Islam, and its role within Western cultural development, the dynamics of Judaism can be better understood when compared and contrasted to Chinese models. The reasons why Confucianism in particular precluded the need for typical religious conduct as we know it in the West are of special interest.\n\n2\n\nIntroduction\n\nI have long been fascinated by the role of messianism in the transformation of society and have hypothesized in other works that messianism is commonly used by societies to trigger change and render archaic and obsolete social paradigms open for re-fertilization with new ideas. We remain unsure to what extent messianism previously existed in China, if at all. Certain Chinese religions, cults and ideologies at the fringes of and underlying Chinese social and political life are worthy of comparison with Jewish messianic and social iconoclastic movements, to identify them more closely and compare the dynamics. I have begun a study of religions in China for this purpose, and some discussion herein serves as an entrée. Comparisons between Jewish and Chinese festivals, calendars and rituals also have fascinating dimensions, especially as the Hebrew and Chinese calendars share many of the same intercalating techniques and milestones of the agricultural year marked by concurrent lunar and solar festivals. These suggest parallel development in aspects of the cultural and symbolic worlds of the two societies and point to the existence of similar sentiments, as they respond to events of the lunar and solar cycles. The way that tradition and modernity merge and form a national consensus is fascinating in itself; the availability of two different and polar examples of how tradition is woven into the administering of national and cultural identity presents many insights for the sociologist and philosophers of society. Another area of fascination is the personal stories of Jews who have lived and worked in China over the past decades until the present. A similar subject has been dealt with in a chapter of another volume I edited, entitled The Jewish–Chinese Nexus: A Meeting of Civilizations (Routledge 2008) which relates to Jewish people from former generations. The present generation of Jews in China is equally riveting and includes rabbis, entrepreneurs, business people, professionals, academics, travelers and journalists who have lived in China for years, and have observed and contributed to processes which may only reach maturation in decades to come. Their life-stories are illustrative of the interaction between Jews and Chinese, often telling rare and epic stories. Surveying some of them is a necessary component of the discipline in formation. As the Jewish communities of China grow, Jewish individuals will invariably achieve prominence in a variety of spheres, professions and industries; their observations of these endeavors are insightful, their personal contributions to them often landmark, bringing Western and Jewish perspectives to the fore of Chinese life. Examples include the establishment of major private hospitals in Beijing and Shanghai by long-time Jewish residents (and Jewish community leaders) of Ms Roberta Lipson and Ms Eliza Silverstein, and also the attempt to implement a six-day week and a compulsory weekend (Sabbath) in his factories by Jewish industrialist Harold Lerner. The implementation of a cessation of work on the Sabbath is complicated in the Chinese context and has far-reaching administrative, financial and social implications. Similarly, in Guangzhou, where a sizable Israeli and Jewish contingent live,\n\nIntroduction\n\n3\n\nmany shops and small factories close on festivals and on the Sabbath. Jewish involvement in improving work ethic practices, often to the dismay of Chinese workers who do not understand or identify with the ethic of rest and prefer to receive more wages, is no less than tantalizing and could have implications well into China’s future. I discuss another example of this in the current volume relating to the kosher food industry in China. Another area needing more attention is the relations between Israelis and Chinese. This assumes many forms, including identifying and realizing Israeli and Jewish interests and policies in China, the machinations of the Israeli embassy, consulates, and culture and trade missions, and the formation of the Israeli China Chamber of Commerce and other organizations to represent, lobby and implement Israeli and Jewish interests. Conversely there is the growing phenomenon of Chinese in Israel, working as professionals and as manual laborers. The increasing awareness of each other and of disparate of language and culture is not always edifying as Chinese workers complain of unfair treatment and of women forced into prostitution. The effects of modern Chinese–Jewish relations, the realities and ideals, requires further exploration. Academic, cultural and professional collaboration between Jews and Chinese is growing as scholars and professionals from a broad range of fields – science, engineering, agriculture, archeology, politics, economics, law, cinema and art – increasingly travel back and forth. The intellectual and creative synergy between the two nations is compelling. Another phenomenon of interest and worthy of investigation is the disproportionate numbers of Jews who visit China as tourists, or who return to visit graves or explore their roots, and the general fascination many Jews have for Chinese civilization. There are several salient features of this phenomenon which require explanation. Owing to the influence of some of these tourists, a cultural bridge is in continual formation, with far-reaching implications. The question of the status of foreigners in China is likely to become topical in the coming years as tens of thousands of expatriates who have lived for years, if not decades, in major Chinese cities will come to expect the same fair representation and rights as immigrants in other countries. As their children are born and grow up in China, study in Chinese educational settings and speak Chinese, this issue becomes even more pressing. Jews are inexorably linked to this issue owing to their heightened sensitivity to the struggle for minority rights, and to the Jewish community’s cohesion and experience in representing its special needs vis-à-vis government officials. Because of their diversity, multinational and multicultural representation, and ability to bring the pressure of international networks to bear on Chinese officials, Jews and Jewish groups may find themselves championing the wider interests of the wider expatriate community in China. Of special concern is the question of the legalization of Judaism in China, which has not yet been addressed but seems it cannot continue for much longer without\n\n4\n\nIntroduction\n\nredress. Hence the status of Jews in China continues to accompany many of the major rites of passage of Chinese modernization and integration into the world community. The growing incidence of mixed Jewish–Chinese identities is also of interest. Intermarriage between Jews and Chinese (and the maturing of offspring within Jewish educational settings), significant numbers of Chinese conversions to Judaism (including the high-profile congressional hopeful Hank Eng), large numbers of Chinese girls adopted by Jewish families who are now coming of age, Chinese living in Israel and collaborating with Jews in a range of pursuits, Jews living in China and being immersed in Chinese language and culture have all contributed to a burgeoning Jewish–Chinese identity. The manner in which these phenomena will increasingly inform Jewish Studies in China and the issue of the Jewish descendants of Kaifeng are also of great interest. The rehabilitation of the Jewish community in Kaifeng is a work in progress. Some of the younger members of the old-new community are working hard to develop Hebrew-language skills, deepen their commitment to Jewish tradition, and build ties with Jews in China and around the world. Their efforts to put in motion a recovery plan and take advantage of economic opportunities to extricate themselves from dire poverty may be significant in their re-conjoining with the wider Jewish world. The ability of international Jewish bodies to collaborate with them and assist these efforts opens up vistas for new and far-reaching areas of Jewish–Chinese relations. The question of how Jewish organizations perceive this community – not formally recognized as Jews – is of interest; the question whether to help and how to help is challenging Jewish communal conceptions. The question of whether they will be recognized as Jews for the purpose of emigration to Israel under the Right of Return Act is also fraught with challenges. The above topics, though not dealt with directly, inform the discussion and interests within the chapters and sections of the present volume. The work is divided as follows: “Chinese perceptions of Jews”, which introduces the general impressions Chinese have of Jews; “Food, identity, Jews and Chinese”, which ostensibly deals with a comparison of food and eating habits but actually tries to identify the underlying dynamics of the respective cultures; “The kosher industry in China”, which relates to a growing Jewish industry in some of the distant provinces of China with the potential to overhaul Jewish dynamics there – kosher supervision in factories in countries around the world has mobilized many religious Jews to emigrate, which, if it happened, would change the dynamics of Jewish community life in China; “Jewish Studies in China”, and is a major chapter that discusses the growing phenomenon in its entirety and is a summary of the last four years I have spent teaching Jewish philosophy at Shandong University – there are many factors involved in the subject, and this section lays the groundwork for other cultural and intellectual discourse and relations between the two peoples; and “Diaspora, identity and relationship with the homeland”,\n\nIntroduction\n\n5\n\nwhich discusses another important aspect of Chinese–Jewish collaboration and intellectual exchange and in which two antithetical perspectives of civilization are discussed and synthesized – an important area of research which I hope is duly recognized. Finally, I have included a bibliography of Jewish-related books, articles and blogs in the Chinese language. Frequently requested to furnish book titles and references of Chinese writing about Judaism, I have provided an exhaustive list of books and articles in the Chinese language, intended as a resource and reference for non-Chinese scholars wishing to deepen their understanding of/research into this field. It ranges from the most popular titles to the most academic. I hope it will be useful. I would be pleased to hear from scholars and activists who have information and/or who have dealings in the above-mentioned fields. I look forward to continued collaboration with Jewish and Chinese scholars in the future – a time when, no doubt, the nexus between Jews, Chinese and modernity will have burgeoned and blossomed.\n\n1\n\nChinese perceptions of Jews\n\nRegardless of the venue – in a cab, at a restaurant or bar, at a meeting, in conversation across the spectrum from high-level officials to villagers and farm folk alike – a surprisingly high number of people in China will have heard about “Jews” (Chinese: yutairen). Most will respond that “the Jews” are clever and good at business, and that these attributes are good. Generally, Jewish people are respected. There are few negative things said; and, if anything, it is usually surrounding the Israeli–Arab conflict, with the differences between Jews and Israelis blurred and confused. On occasion, observations that echo Christian/European sentiments are expressed; but, for the most part, the cultural and theological underpinnings of European anti-Semitism are not understood, have no appeal, and do not resonate within Chinese culture.\n\nSnapshot impressions In his 2004 strategy paper on Chinese and Jews, Saloman Wald quotes a survey of Chinese students who responded to questions about the Jewish people.1 The following are some of the responses: “a brave nation”, “Let the friendship of our two nations extend from generation to generation”, “for anyone who shall attack Israel again, let them become pigs! Let their families become pigs”, “The Jewish nation is worthy of our sympathy! Support the Jewish people”. These strong votes of confidence in Israel and the Jews are surprising considering that, a decade earlier, China and Israel did not share diplomatic relations. Either China’s diplomatic overtures were in response to the natural friendship towards the Jews and sympathy to Israel; or, as a result of diplomatic relations, government media have endorsed positive reports. There are also negative views of Jews emanating primarily from Islamic enclaves and motivated by their radicalization, but this subject is beyond the immediate scope of our work.2 Snippets of responses recorded by Wald of students who took an introductory course in Jewish Studies include: “Long history of persecution”, “strong family values”, “education values”, “networks of friends”, “chosen by God”, “[Jews] don’t missionize”, “originators of the Bible”, “an ancient civilization”, “very\n\nChinese perceptions of Jews 7 religious”, “founders of monotheism”, “don’t believe in Jesus”, “do believe in Jesus”, “enemies of other religions”, “many famous people are Jews”, “Einstein, Freud, Marx were Jews”, “Most believe in Islam”, “There is a Jewish version of the Bible”, “very clever” and “very rich”.3 These were recorded in 2004. Since then, dozens or perhaps hundreds of books, articles and documentaries have come out and catalyzed these opinions. In a Washington Post article in April 2007, Ariana Eunjung Cha surveyed some of the superficial perceptions of Jews in popular Chinese literature and the media.4 She listed some of the “self-help” and “make it rich” literature attributed to Jewish wisdom which has given the Jewish communities in China and Jews in general “iconic status in the eyes of the Chinese public”. They include: The Eight Most Valuable Business Secrets of the Jewish, The Legend of Jewish Wealth, Jewish People and Business: The Bible of How to Live Their Lives.5 She notes that “Many of these sell upward of 30,000 copies a year and are thought of in the same inspirational way as many Americans view the ‘Chicken Soup for the Soul’ series”. The interest in “Jewish Fever” as described in more detail in another chapter of this book has extended to the pages of January’s Shanghai and Hong Kong Economy magazine with a front cover with the title “Where does Jewish people’s wisdom come from?” and to Chinese business requests to invite Jewish entrepreneurs to give seminars on how to make money “the Jewish way”. A media outlet even invited a Jewish businessman and his family on to a popular television show, following them around with a camera to see how they ate and how they ran their lives.6 Even in Chinese academic circles, the impressions of Jews continue to be in step with broad and superficial generalizations about race, culture and religion, which is unacceptable in contemporary Western intellectual etiquette, as it is believed that these have sometimes formed the basis for anti-Semitic campaigns in the West.7 In China they are believed to be, at worst, harmless musings about world cultures.\n\nSurvey of impressions To get a better picture of the attitude of Chinese people towards Jewish people, I conducted a number of my own surveys, questionnaires and interviews over several years living in China, and present some of the responses below. The respondents were primarily quite educated people, university students or students at colleges or academies, and hailed from diverse provinces and from both urban and rural locales, geographically far-flung: Yunnan in the south, Shandong in the central eastern area, Beijing in the northeast, Hubei in the center of the country, representing a broad range of views within the still-vague parameters of an emerging middle class, the new face of China comprised of the children of farmers, merchants, professionals and elites – the groups that have come to reap the rewards of the everexpanding cycle of increased economic growth, higher levels of education, greater opportunity and entrepreneurial endeavor, and children of high government officials. The bulk of the data-gathering took place in Shandong\n\n8\n\nJews and Judaism in modern China\n\nProvince, a region where people represent the basic and most deeply entrenched cultural mors of traditional China. Interviewing peasants and farmers, the majority of whom have little or no formal education, is a bit more tricky as their knowledge of world affairs is rudimentary, but what I have generally discovered is that those who do know anything at all invariably have something positive to say – an observation from the simplest and least-informed Chinese person, typically a farmer or villager, will be along the lines of “Jew? The Jews are clever!”. These quite obviously are conclusions drawn without any first-hand knowledge to substantiate them, but they none the less indicate that perceptions of Jews are sufficiently strong to have permeated even the backwaters of a country still in relative ignorance about distant cultures. One of the written surveys I embarked upon in 2005 by way of research for a forthcoming book, A Philosopher’s Observations of Modern China, sought to identify general ethical and cultural predilections amongst young Chinese people aged 18–22, and to understand trends in national and religious identity, discrimination, ethics and attitude to culture. Some of the findings are discussed herein, the most relevant being preferences for some nationalities over others. The assumptions that hatred for Japanese people is very commonplace, and that Chinese people are suspicious but respectful (and perhaps envious) of the United States, appeared to be confirmed in this survey. That they admire the Jews greatly without any vestiges of jealousy or bitterness was also apparent in the replies of large numbers of respondents singing high and free praise. The unreserved respect for Jews juxtaposed against the more restrained, but generally positive, views of Americans raises a number of curious questions which will be discussed below. I hoped to clarify some of these points in a second set of surveys focusing on the attitudes of Chinese students in particular towards Jews. Respondents to these surveys were from a range of institutions and forums: students of philosophy and of religion at Shandong University; graduate students from a number of Chinese universities who participated at a summer school in Jewish Studies in 2005; students chosen randomly from schools around Jinan city; and participants in a Hyde Park Corner type of open discussion arena which took place in Jinan city on Sunday mornings where I would incite debate about identity in a general sense, and would specifically raise issues relating to the Jewish people and to Israel. The following are some of the responses to questions posed to students in a “Jewish people and culture” course I delivered. I asked some questions before the start of the program and others afterwards – questions such as: What do you know about Jews? What do you believe to be the most important elements, beliefs and principles of Judaism? What do you find interesting about the Hebrew Bible and do you think that it has any relevance to Chinese life, religion, language, culture and development? Do you think Jewish ideas and civilization is an important subject to learn about? What topics covered in the course do you consider to be most important?\n\nChinese perceptions of Jews 9 The comments of respondents recorded below fall into two major groups. The first group was comprised of general students and people “in the street” randomly chosen, and their replies represent popular attitudes shaped by the media and the respondents’ own particular biases, values and so forth formed as a result of upbringing, community views, peer influence and so on. The second group was comprised of students whose ideas were formed and/or refined after having attended lectures about Jews and Judaism and after lengthy discussions and inquiry.\n\nObserving them observing you: impressions of Chinese culture via impressions of Jews In many cases the observations noted below were aired in the context of discussion, or were echoed by many people suggesting a distinct group attitude. I have added analysis to the comments so as to observe some features of Chinese culture in response to their observations of Jews. Jews have a very long history, like the Chinese. It is very often the case that any praise afforded to Jews (and others) is self-referential. For example, they may say: “The Jews have an ancient history like the Chinese”, “the Jews are clever like the Chinese”, “the Jews suffered like the Chinese”, “the Jews are good in business like the Chinese”. Only rarely is praise given freely, without the will to share the credit or to reference the praise towards themselves. The conclusions drawn from this observation include the possibility that praise for “the Jews” reflects an image of what the respondents would like to be or what they think they are, with the symbol of the “Jews” merely serving as an image of their hopes and ambitions. Since Judaism and Chinese culture are totally different, we Chinese can learn a lot through comparison. Both Jews and Chinese have made great contributions to our world, they both created many splendid accomplishments in language, customs, culture and many other aspects, they are both part of the treasure of the human psyche. Chinese and Jews have a lot of common ground: the two have a glorious history, defend stubbornly their cultural tradition, industrious endeavors, rich in wisdom, most importantly they have unfortunate and bitter experiences, being pushed aside, discrimination and persecution. These two nationalities make very big contributions to humanity. Although they have many differences they should become friends and not enemies. Empathy and identity and friendship emerge from the sense that there is both similarities and much to learn from the Jews. Before attending class I just knew from books and newspapers that the Jews are very wise and good at business, and that they treasure knowledge. As for Judaism, I knew very little. Today I still believe that the Jews\n\n10\n\nJews and Judaism in modern China are wise and that they like to think. It seems that the principles and laws are of utmost importance because the principles keep the beliefs.\n\nChinese students who study Judaism seem to be particularly struck (not necessarily in a positive way) by the strictness of Jewish religion and the role of law and principles in the management of Jewish life. This reference to “principles” confounds them and suggests fundamentally different axes around which Chinese life and society revolves. I know that the Jews are the people chosen by God long ago. They are very clever. They lived in Israel in ancient times but now they live everywhere. Chinese students commonly speak about God or even refer to God as an entity that should be respected and revered whilst simultaneously saying they are non-believers. Their ability to respect and “give face” to many religious and superstitious traditions is born of the polytheistic culture and plethora of family-based deities, which breeds a liberal, non-exclusive deference to all. This is a cognitive dissonance that some Westerners may have difficulty reconciling. Belief in God has wide-ranging implications for the thought processes and behavior of Westerners. In the West, atheists do not refer to God nonchalantly as the subject animates much of their intellectual machinations. Chinese, however, do not generally refer to God in this way; they have not been brought up with literary and social references to a single monotheistic, biblical God, and it does not serve as an important axiomatic principle in their lives. They treat the subject with equanimity and are apparently not at all perplexed by discussing or referring to it, or even praying or paying ritual respect if convenient to do so. But they do so with casual nonchalance, such as to imply indifference to the exclusive demands of the biblical God. About Israel I know little and don’t want to answer the question. Chinese students are still reluctant to voice criticism, an enduring consequence of the Cultural Revolution and fear of the authorities. As they are also eager to find positive things to say and give honor and “face” to their superiors, they will rarely directly criticize. This student had possibly heard negative things about Israel and did not know how to reconcile it with the request to give honest and, if necessary, critical responses, so he preferred to not answer.8 I have always thought that the Jews are very clever, humorous and strong. In the eyes of most Chinese, the Jews are very smart. They have wit, humor and are good at business. Jewish people are all good at trading so they are rich, both mentality and materially. I think it’s related to their diligence, maybe many of them are born geniuses, I guess.\n\nChinese perceptions of Jews 11 Jewish people are smart. Sometimes they are selfish, they are good at business. Israel, in West of Asia, is their homeland. Studying Judaism can help us understand philosophy and bible. Jews are interesting because they are smart and have good talking skills. Generalizations come easily to Chinese, perhaps related to the pictographic– iconographic nature of the Chinese character system, which depicts an image by its overt features; and, even as time passes and the features depicted are no longer relevant, the characters remain the same and are still recognized. Chinese still view themselves in national not individual terms. They are deeply patriotic and prone to view others, at least at first, in terms of their national characteristics instead of their individual ones. Projecting features and typical behaviors according to national belonging does not seem to them inaccurate or errant. Even the race to become rich, so passionately embraced by so many, is not justified entirely as a personal/individual pursuit. Endorsed by the government as a national service, it has become the nexus between national and personal interests, which may be one of the reasons why the government is tolerated, despite its other flaws. It also may be a reason why they view wealth as a national characteristic. It is said that the world’s money is in the hands of the US, the US money is in the hands of the Jews, therefore like the majority of people, I think that the Jews have economic minds. There are many famous nations in the world, but I think the Jews are the most special. Obviously Jews are the cleverest, the richest and they almost control the economy of America, even of the world, like Rockefeller and Buffet. After WWII Jews escaped to America and it resulted that most scientists awarded the Nobel Prize are American Jews. As it happens, the student was mistaken about Rockefeller and Buffet being Jewish, but none the less it explains a most curious inclination amongst some respondents to explain America’s success as being because of the Jews and not in its own right. This may be a subconscious attempt to alleviate Chinese embarrassment at not being as “successful”. The good things about the Jews are that they are still strong after so many disasters, they do well in business. The bad thing is that they don’t accept other people from different culture. From some books I got an impression of the Jews which was not so good. I thought they were anti-foreign to some extent. They were too close to each other and reject others who try to enter their circle. They separate themselves from people who are not in the same community. However I also thought these people are very clever and good in many fields, such as commerce. They are rich and united but they are exclusive and not for other people. They have great wisdom but don’t want to tell other people about it.\n\n12\n\nJews and Judaism in modern China\n\nThe perception that Jews are exclusive and secretive or protective about their wisdom and spiritual assets, that they are too close-knit and non-accepting of others, is a curious comment. It seems to refer to the non-evangelism policy of Judaism, which while alleviating the fears of the Chinese authorities, who have allowed Jewish communities and Jewish Studies to grow in China, seems paradoxically to offend students who believe that they should be entitled to participate in any group or knowledge base they wish. I questioned the students about this point and asked whether I or any other foreigner could ever become a Chinese citizen. They responded that this would be impossible.9 I pushed the point: what if my Chinese was fluent, if I married a Chinese person, if I lived in China for forty years, if I contributed greatly to China economically and/or socially, and if I knew the customs and habits of Chinese? The entire class responded that it was impossible. Chinese expect to be welcomed to countries throughout the world, expect to get visas and scholarships, and understand that they will be encouraged to integrate. They expect the right to become citizens of other countries eventually, or to adopt Christian, Muslim or Jewish faith, if they wish; but then, seemingly arrogantly, or at least contradictorily, believe that foreigners could not and should not become a Chinese citizen. The apparent double standard begs a more thorough investigation. I believe the Jewish people are one of the greatest nations in the world and they are playing an important role in our world, but I don’t think it’s important to study Hebrew language. Chinese people and the Jews are both ancient peoples, but the differences are large. Chinese people live in the same area, (tend to stay close to their birthplace) whilst Jews are dispersed throughout the world. Chinese people advocate harmony whilst Jews are faced with competition [conflict] most of the time. Moreover the language that the Chinese use and the language of the Jews come from completely different cultural systems. At the start of my class I opened with a series of contrasts between Chinese and Jews; I described how different they were and how they reflect entirely antithetical social dynamics. Some of the students, who had been excited to learn about Jews and Judaism, were noticeably uncomfortable, and for a short period of time seemed less interested in the subject. The Chinese conscientiously try to find similarities and harmony in their relationships and circumstances, and the notion of existing and cooperating with something irreconcilably different is new and somehow threatening. Noting difference is tantamount to turning off the light. However, I persisted with this approach, and the students came to understand my point surprisingly quickly, and they began to appreciate that differences could also be an asset. The Jews haven’t had a real land but a spiritual homeland, China now faces the opposite problem, we have our own land but are gradually losing our spiritual home.\n\nChinese perceptions of Jews 13 There is genuine interest, or perhaps sympathy, with the Jews, who are characterized as being without a homeland. The Chinese are so completely oriented towards the Middle Kingdom that a nation that does not have a homeland astounds them. Even the national minorities of China have a homeland and are entitled to it by Chinese law. The concept of a homeless minority is disarming and confounding to the Chinese sensibilities. I think Jews and Chinese have friendly relations because both are wise enough to understand that good relations will give each other profit in all aspects. Studying about Jews is important because their wisdom shocks the world, Israel is only a small nation, but many scientists, philosophers, and millionaires are Jews. The Jewish bible has influenced the Western world and even the whole world. It amazes me how Jews have kept their customs after being dispersed for many years. I want to understand how Jews teach their children. I know little, it is said they are intelligent and aggressive, maybe related to their education and language. I heard a story about Jewish education, a mother puts honey on a book then let her son lick it, in this way the boy learns books are sweet and he will be interested in reading and studying. I don’t know if this is true but it seems creative and interesting and useful.\n\nJews as worthy of emulation In China there are many people who say the Jews are a very smart people. They are experts in finance, philosophy and most importantly they are especially good in business. The good thing about the Jews is that they are a smart people and do well in many things. The bad thing about the Jews is that they are in war with the Arab world. The war between the Jews and the Arab people has lasted thousands of years. Israel is not a big country but it owns hi technology in science and military. In a word, Israel is a rich country. Jews have helped China a lot like in culture and helped our air force with the J-10 fighter aircraft. Chinese helped the Jews during WWII. There is a friendship between Jewish people and Chinese people. There are many relations between China and the Jews for example in military affairs and cultural affairs. They are both countries with a glorious culture. If we build a relationship between each other, we can progress in many aspects and [engage in] cultural exchange. The Jews can be said to be one of the smartest nations in the world and they are very successful in almost every field. So to study the Jew can make us learn better and get more wisdom. I know very little about Jews, [except] that they have an old history; like China they didn’t have their land until 1945. I hear Jews are very\n\n14\n\nJews and Judaism in modern China clever. In modern times they have done a lot for humanity in many areas. But I know few details and know nothing about Judaism, though I think it is necessary and important to learn. The two cultures and languages are in contrast and I think it is necessary for the two to contact each other. We should learn from the Jewish people who are better than us, and then we can make progress in many ways. Now, Israel is richer than China, so as a Chinese student, I must learn from the Jews and study the Jews, for our country and motherland. We want to grow and become stronger.\n\nOne of the significant differences between the Euro-American and Chinese education systems is the relative values placed on the role and functionality of the subject matter. For Chinese, the subject needs to be useful otherwise it does not warrant study. In Western research universities any subject belonging to the body of knowledge can and should be explored whether or not its usefulness and utility is known or even if the subject may well never again be relevant.10 The students responding to these questions were clearly seeking reasons for their study of the course on Jewish Civilization, and needed reasons to justify contact and friendship between the Chinese and Jewish civilizations. China has, in the past, been deeply isolationist and self-sufficient, the prevailing view being that it needed nothing from the outside world. The selfimposed closure of its ports in the 1800s ultimately led to the outbreak of the Opium Wars. The motivation for study in general and interest in the Jews in particular is invariably linked to national feelings and interest. The willingness to humbly learn from someone else who is perceived to be more intelligent or superior in some other way is a temporary concession until the necessary skills are acquired and this reverence is no longer necessary. There is an interesting similarity between this attitude and that of ultraorthodox Jews who are prepared to associate with non-ultra-orthodox or non-Jews when it comes to matters of necessity, mainly business. None the less the dynamics between the two are different and are discussed in more detail elsewhere. I knew that Jews are the ancient people and they made money by selling jewellery. Jewish intelligence and ability is worthy of Chinese study. Marx was a Jew that deeply affected modern China and was accepted by the Chinese Communist Party who is integrating it with Chinese characteristics. The Jews are the most rational nation in the world and they have the highest synthetical wisdom. The Jewish population accounts for 0.3% of the world population and 11.6% of Nobel Prize winners. Jews are clever, full of wisdom and do well in many fields such as business, philosophy and physics.\n\nChinese perceptions of Jews 15 Most of them are very rich. Their education is very good, they are very clever. Jews are very smart and tough people who have their traditional habits for many thousands of years, with little change. The law is the most important part of being Jewish. After class I felt that the Jewish people are not so hard to get along with and are friendly. It is amazing they have held their traditions and beliefs so firmly.\n\nEvolution of the concept of Jew in Chinese consciousness The Chinese impression of Jews has taken on several incarnations over the centuries. The first may well have been the impact of the thousand-year Jewish presence in Kaifeng. It is said that several Jews achieved prominence in imperial China; they were recognized as a distinct minority, yet the Chinese predilection towards harmony and integration caused their eventual assimilation, so that reference to Jews and Judaism does not refer to China’s ethnic Jews.11 Another impression of Jews came as a result of the translation of the Bible into Chinese by Christian missionaries, resulting in some biblical and Jewish references entering Chinese literary circles and filtering through the language. Several stereotypes of Jews have formed from Christian ideas infiltrating China’s scholarly classes, as discussed in more detail in Chapter 4. The continual flow of foreign literature into China has also informed and misinformed Chinese perceptions of Jews. Shakespeare’s The Merchant of Venice introduced the idea of Jews being mean.12 Despite this, there is surprisingly little doctrinal basis for Chinese impressions, so the misunderstandings and misperceptions are more liquid and responsive to change. It is likely that the Baghdadi Jewish traders in the Far East during the 1900s made a deep impression on the Chinese, especially in Hong Kong and Shanghai where large tracts of property were owned by Jews, and it seems apparent that the censorship, distortions and lack of interest in historical detail in the period leading up to the establishment of the People’s Republic of China only partly inform public opinion of Jews and do not seem to be the primary source for the general perception of Jews. The later arrival of the Russian Jews in Harbin during the 1910s–1920s and the German Jews of Shanghai in the 1940s made an even deeper impression and stimulated important translations of Jewish works into Chinese, which influenced the Chinese intelligentsia. The status assumed by the Chinese as host nation to the Jews, while sharing a common plight from persecution, lent affinities and comradeship to the relationship and perceptions of Jews. A relatively high number of Jews who lived throughout various provinces became heroes and made outstanding contributions to Chinese society over\n\n16\n\nJews and Judaism in modern China\n\na range of endeavors. This has contributed to the complexity of the impressions and to the grassroots popularity of the Jews in China.13 The main thrust of Chinese impressions of Jews seems to have emerged from a more unlikely place. In his book The Fugu Plan, Marvin Tokayer describes how the Japanese became infatuated with the Jews and tried to set up a Jewish enclave in Russian Manchuria (now northern China), in an attempt to use Jewish brains and financial savvy to gain world dominance.14 It is plausible that Japanese impressions of Jews filtered into Chinese consciousness throughout the decades of occupation and influence, and informed some of the present stereotypes Chinese have of Jews. This argument is particularly compelling as the Chinese views seem to mirror closely those of the Japanese. Chinese scholars and students viewed Japan as a source of inspiration and enlightenment; many studied in Japan and translated Japanese literature. The likelihood of this type of influence is arguable on several accounts. Tokayer outlines the development of Japanese perceptions of Jews in two main stages. The vice-governor of the state-owned Bank of Japan, Baron Korekiyo Takahashi, was in London in 1904 trying to raise money for the war against the Russians. In a chance meeting with Mr Jacob Schiff, an American Jewish banker and partner at the large investment bank Kuhn Loeb, they shared their mutual hatred for Tsar Nicholas II, the latter because of the pogroms against Jews in the Russian town of Kishinev. Subsequently Mr Schiff arranged a loan of £5 million for Japan and paved the way for loans up to £200 million to the Japanese military, which secured the Japanese victory over Russia. Jacob Schiff became a national hero in Japan. Newspapers and history textbooks dedicated pages to him, not so much as an American but as a Jew. In this way, the term “Jew” became synonymous with access to and control of vast sums of money. The second stage was in 1919 when Japan fought alongside the White Russian army led by the fervently anti-Jewish general Gregorii Semonov, who handed out copies of the famously anti-Semitic book The Protocols of the Elders of Zion to all his soldiers, along with their guns and other military equipment. Aimed at boosting their morale and their hatred of the Bolsheviks, it influenced the 75,000 Japanese soldiers who until then had never had negative views of Jews. It had a particular impact on a young Japanese soldier, Captain Norihiro Yasue, a Russian-language expert posted to General Semonov’s staff. In 1922, after the war, Yasue translated The Protocols for the Japanese Army Intelligence Bureau and ran a research group focused on Jewish power and its strategic applications. The Protocols of the Elders of Zion was interpreted differently from the way in which it was intended. Instead of hating or despising the Jews, as the anti-Semitic writers had intended, the Japanese developed great respect for the Jews and henceforth harbored a desire to cooperate with them for the purpose of world dominance. The Chinese stereotype of the Jew is somewhat similar, suggesting that the basis of their perceptions of Jews came from Japan and from anti-Semitic literature translated from Japanese into Chinese. Filtered\n\nChinese perceptions of Jews 17 within an Asian context, these perceptions produce not hatred but rather respect and awe. However, grossly distorted stereotypes, devoid of truth or depth, will no doubt change and become further distorted. The building of a perception of a nation on false and deceptive foundations cannot have long-term viability. The perception of Jews in China continues to change and seems to be a matter of public, private, diplomatic and international debate. Even more curious is the liberal attitude of the government in allowing the press and the internet to air views freely on this issue, seemingly serving as a de facto litmus test for the debate surrounding freedom of expression in China. Until 1992, the Chinese press was overtly anti-Israeli and pro-Palestinian. While this does not necessarily indicate an anti-Jewish bias, it indicates that the perceptions were strictly controlled by government forces. Zhang Ping discusses the process in which anti-Israel sentiment in China dramatically changed course and became a strong pro-Israel and pro-Jewish sentiment as the Internet replaced the government-endorsed information media. In this article he demonstrates the power of the internet in China in guiding Chinese popular perceptions and how the debate around Israel and Jews became more complex, international and less stereotypical.15 These days many people, Chinese and otherwise, form their basic impression of Jews from material found on the internet; those who seek more information can turn to a huge range of books. Chinese attitudes towards Jews are also informed by a considerable publishing spree of books relating to Judaism and Jews, as discussed above. Many of these books reinforce superficial stereotypes of Jews and border on the vulgar. Highly superficial, stereotypical descriptions of Jewish subjects written for popular appeal are forcing corrections and debate amongst scholars and the emergence of more academic publications, increasing in volume every year. Jewish Studies departments and units being established in several Chinese universities are working to remedy these stereotypes and inaccuracies, and Chinese students are now more likely to get a more balanced and proportional understanding of Jews and Jewish culture.16 Translated Jewish and Israeli novels are also becoming popular. In many ways the academic interest in Jewish Studies is informed and motivated by the sensationalism surrounding the Jews, and they seem to feed and inform each other. The growth of various charismatic Christian groups in China gives rise to a number of issues regarding the way they depict Jews in their doctrinal systems. Inherent in their doctrine is a mission to raise the profile of and support for the state of Israel, and as a result the depiction of the Jew is becoming more complicated, and this contributes to the growing melting-pot of impressions likely to become a part of a future Chinese assessment of Jews. Islamic influence is also considerable. Until 1992, China was aligned with the Arab bloc and still maintains close ties with most Islamic nations.17 A considerable Islamic community has existed in China for a thousand years over that time and models have been developed for coexistence with other\n\n18\n\nJews and Judaism in modern China\n\nreligions and cultures which served to yield moderate and tolerant ethnic minorities; the ideologies amongst them continue to develop, some steering away from the traditional fusion with Chinese and Confucian culture towards a more Arabic and foreign Islamic character which could stir up rebelliousness and religious zealotry.18 As more Muslims and Arabs move to China and establish communities in Chinese cities, their influence on the local mosque and the views of local Muslims becomes more pronounced. Guangzhou in the south of China has an especially large and growing Arabic community, and Chinese Muslims have been influenced and radicalized to various degrees as a result. The growing Israeli and Jewish community has experienced a sense of unease at these developments, but under a strong government their security and sense of safety is still, at this time, preserved.\n\nAttitudes towards foreigners In many ways China is a nation of fervently proud and patriotic people,19 such that it could be interpreted as hyper-nationalistic. Since Chinese social characteristics do not even closely correlate with Western notions of nationalism, simple comparisons as to the effects of nationalism cannot be easily drawn. However, whatever the basis of the fervor, and however genuine it is, and whatever the outcomes of any comparisons, this style of patriotism is intrinsically connected with a deep-rooted belief in ethnic supremacy and superior intelligence. The Chinese, known for offering a polite “face” to foreign guests, a sign of their sense of restraint – considered to be a characteristic of superiority, and of their cultural, almost patriotic, obligation to exercise it with the greatest courtesy (and inscrutability) – are invariably gracious to visitors. None the less they rarely rush to offer such kind words regarding other foreign nationalities in the way they do for Jews. Europeans, perceived as being a cause of the humiliating Chinese concessions and of the Opium Wars in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, are only now beginning to receive a somewhat warmer reception. Americans, perceived as the modern incarnation of colonialism, are tolerated because of their technology and their economic strength, but not particularly liked. Arabs, who have been trading with China for a thousand years and have seen a resurgence over recent decades, are accepted as a necessity of a growing economy, but their religious proclivities are not appreciated and the radicalization of local Muslims is considered by Chinese intellectuals to be a problem. A worthwhile test of the Chinese attitude to various nationalities can very easily be gauged by taking a taxi and engaging in friendly conversation with the taxi driver. Mentioning that you are Russian, English, American, Iranian or French would not likely elicit a particularly meaningful or enthusiastic reply – probably just a perfunctory courteous (or not-so-courteous) acknowledgment. Saying that you are Jewish invariably brings forth a friendly, interested and supportive response.\n\nChinese perceptions of Jews 19 There is a propensity in China to heavy stereotyping. This is perhaps born of dependence on the heavily controlled, propagandist media, the necessity of learning about the world from secondary and tertiary sources, with virtually no personal exposure to realities outside China in the sense that information is heavily censored and filtered. Perhaps, as mentioned above, it emerges from the learning process via the Chinese character system. Simplistic depiction of other peoples can, in the right political mood, be steered towards denigration and even hatred of foreigners. Foreigners are referred to as “White Devils” and by other disparaging references, which are not intended to insult but, as they settle into the Chinese mind, can be used to delegitimize and denigrate. This is of course not unique to China, and perhaps the Chinese have been able to control xenophobic outbreaks more effectively than Western countries have. In the lead-up to the Beijing Olympic Games, there were definite signs of widespread anti-Western sentiment throughout the country, especially against the backdrop of anti-Chinese, pro-Tibetan demonstrations on the Olympic torch route. The intense and non-censured patriotism shared by 95 percent of Chinese in support of Chinese national unity suggests indifference to the will of some of their minorities and to voices around the world. The near-unanimous belief that they are right and legitimized and even profoundly righteous in their position is still far from being xenophobic, but suggests that some of the seeds for xenophobia and extreme nationalism are waiting in potentia. These feelings could (and in some cases have) fomented open hostility; the media, controlled by government policy, have fueled these sentiments – perhaps in order to show the power of the people’s feelings, and as a warning that the government stands in the middle, managing and withholding the more extreme passions of its population, and finally to warn foreigners off undermining China’s national interests.\n\nOn anti-Semitism, philo-Semitism and stereotypes Clearly, heavy stereotyping and group association of foreigners, including of Jews, exists, but these thought processes are bound to be broken over time. The perception of foreigners as heroes and glitzy, rich and skill-laden, gleaned from movies and electronic media, is already being challenged by the many tens of thousands of English teachers living and working in second-, third- and fourth-tier cities, many of them disenfranchised and relatively uneducated, to present a different face of the stereotypical image of foreigners. As more Chinese travel abroad, learn English and have access to other sources of information, their impressions of foreigners, and of Jews will invariably mature. The perception of foreigners in the large cities of Shanghai, Beijing and Guangzhou has already changed as the meeting of cultures takes its effect. Many Chinese residents of big cities have a negative image of foreigners, who have come to be known as bar-hopping, loud, party-happy, rude and licentious. The perception – some would say fact – that many or even some\n\n20\n\nJews and Judaism in modern China\n\nforeigners take advantage of Chinese women is particularly offensive and has aroused a lot of media attention, particularly in Chinese blogs. Jews have not yet fallen victim to this criticism of and reaction towards foreigners. They have not been categorized in negative terms or associated with the scourge of foreigners entering China. Perhaps the continual praise of the Jew in the media and amongst representative groups of Chinese is indicative of their hope of attracting a respectable, creative and dignified foreigner. A Chinese saying, “Foreigners from afar come for serious purposes”, suggests that those who (historically) made the arduous trip to China would not do so for undignified reasons. As international travel becomes easier, this saying loses its poignancy, but continued distinction of Jews from other foreigners may indicate China’s hope and a welcome attitude to people of different cultures, so long as they are serious and respectable.\n\nJews as a reflection of Chinese ambition They are clever and excellent in every area except physical labor. Perhaps they are too astute and their way of doing business may break moral principles. I think our school should provide more courses on this subject and Chinese culture should learn something useful and very different from Jewish culture. More contact! Before this class I knew little about Jews and Judaism other than they had a good mind for earning money, they are spread all over the world and their country’s name is Israel. A great change occurred from knowing nothing to falling in love with it. There are famous Jews such as Einstein, Freud and so on. They are clever and diligent and make great contributions to the human race. They created a great civilization; they are so different from us because they don’t even have a regular place to live. They have been through a difficult history, driven out of countries, especially during WWII. The cruel slaughter by the Nazis was a huge disaster but they became more strong and united afterwards. I heard it is the Shabbat that kept Jews Jews, I think this is a miracle. Before coming to class I knew little about Jews, but my rough impression was they were highly successful in business and in the domain of science as well as other subjects. I know nothing about Jews accept they are great, many great scientists are Jews. Jews are serious, earnest and pious and proud, Chinese are romantic, warm hearted, atheistic and humble. The differences are interesting and we can learn from each other. Young Chinese are very ambitious. Money and position are very important indicators of success, of honor and of status. Wealth is becoming increasingly\n\nChinese perceptions of Jews 21 equated with the most important traditional Chinese icon – the family, respect (and financial responsibility) for parents, care for children, receiving an expensive education. The Jews are perceived to be deeply committed to the family, intelligent and very rich; achieving this so effectively with what appears to be such little infrastructure seems to have captivated the imagination and respect of Chinese people. The Jews may in many ways represent their ultimate expectation and hopes and projections of what foreigners (and themselves) ought and wish to achieve. Seeking a model and heroes from other cultures, the Jew may represent a popular civilizational icon, which can be adored or talked about with few repercussions for their own lives. The local Chinese inhabitants of Shanghai are often called “the Jews of China” because of their general development, clever disposition, economic prosperity and financial acumen, and perhaps also because of a perception that they are not generous with their money.20 The term “Jew” (yutairen) is used in the context of “tight-fisted” or stingy, in the same way that Jews are derogatively described in Western countries, but also has other connotations referring to being good at business and careful with money, which is viewed positively in China. The most impressive vestiges of great individual wealth not connected to the power of the State are associated with the Jews who settled in Shanghai from the late nineteenth century until around 1950. The Hartoum, Khaddourie and Sassoon families were some of the wealthiest people in Asia in the early part of the twentieth century. They owned large tracts of what is now downtown Shanghai (Puxi). As becoming wealthy is aggrandized, supported by government and legitimized ethically and culturally, the legends of Jews’ wealth in China will also become part of the modern financial narrative of the Chinese.\n\nJews as a non-threat factor It seems that Jews present an easy and non-threatening focus of praise. Perhaps not being intimidating, threatening or in competition for the title of superpower, Chinese feel that they can praise the Jews without it reflecting negatively on them. Praising the Americans would imply that the American culture is superior to the Chinese. Perhaps patronizing the Jews has no risk of giving this impression, as it is palpably and laughably obvious that Jews cannot be in competition with China. Furthermore, Jews were not involved in the humiliation of China by Western powers and, unlike other religions such as Buddhism, Islam and Christianity, do not seek to colonize or make converts, rendering themselves intellectually and culturally non-threatening to Chinese domestic life. Even though Chinese and Jewish scholars and diplomats back-slap each other and express mutual satisfaction that anti-Semitism never reared its head in China, the dynamics of nationalism, ethnic discrimination, ideology and hatred towards minorities encapsulated in anti-Semitism reflect more complex\n\n22\n\nJews and Judaism in modern China\n\nsocietal processes and should not be dismissed as being impossible within the Chinese context. The style of anti-Semitism developed in Europe does not flourish in China because Chinese priorities and sense of group are different. None the less fervent nationalism and a sense of superiority can easily resonate amongst many Chinese, and often does, and the needs and positions of “the other” are not always accommodated. Differences, while accepted, are downplayed in favor of what is common and what is harmonious. The Jewish presence in China can hedge itself as being both “part of, and different from” China. For example, the Kaifeng Jewish community famously described itself on the community’s stone steles in terms of reflecting Confucian thought, and being a part of the greater Chinese culture. The Baghdadi–British-Jewish traders were not entirely associated with the humiliating concessions made to Europe: Jewish families settled down in China over generations and became part of the fabric of Chinese life. As mentioned above, Russian and German Jews collaborated with the Chinese and became heroes of the Chinese people, and were perceived not as aggressors and colonizers but as fellows in imperialistic persecution. One of the frequent remarks Chinese make of Jews is how they have survived outside a homeland. As suggested earlier, the sympathy evoked from this astounding phenomenon may lend itself to a form of patronizing praise of Jews. For Chinese, lack of sovereignty is the source of the deepest humiliation and powerlessness, so to a landless people such as Jews the Chinese can afford to be benevolent and magnanimous, and to extend courteous sympathy and respect. Perhaps the strong criticism of Israel by the Chinese State-controlled media suggests that a landed Jewish group challenges the Chinese image of the Jew. The reaction to Israel and its territorial claims has demonstrated hypocritical double standards on the part of the Chinese government.21 Whilst Taiwan and Tibet are claimed to be undeniably and irrevocably integral elements of the Chinese homeland, Jerusalem, the Jewish people’s sole capital for 2500 years, should, to the Chinese mind, be negotiated with the Arab world, for the sake of peace, civilizational harmony and regional stability. Despite the political tensions and the alliances with Israel’s detractors, the Chinese are determined to nurture relations with Israel and the Jewish people in areas that they feel produce important exchanges: science, technology, innovation and Jewish Studies. It remains a mystery how, despite their similar cultural and intellectual objectives, China continues to entrench strategic alliances with the Arab and Islamic nations, whose religious and cultural ambitions are virtually irreconcilably antithetical and mutually exclusive, over an alliance with Israel and her American allies. While the Chinese interest in the unencumbered flow of oil is the openly declared factor, there may well be intellectual and psychological motives invested in this relationship, relating to the way\n\nChinese perceptions of Jews 23 they view each other and the nature of civilization and national interests, worthy of deeper investigation. Chinese expressions of tolerance for Jews also suggest indirect criticism of Western and other “enlightened” countries that have a history of anti Semitism. Chinese authorities are aware of the public-opinion value of tolerance of and friendship towards Jews, and they make efforts to extol the history of Chinese cities open to Jews during World War II and to allow the airing of philo-Semitism. This is of significant value as Europe and the United States criticize China’s human rights record. Giving and saving “face” in China is common, expected and socially correct, and is a graceful component of Chinese culture. It is freely given by the host to the guest, by the strong to the less strong. However, were the Jews to present any real threat or economic competition to China, it is doubtful that this praise would be as readily forthcoming. Were Jewish communities to put down roots in Chinese soil and function as a religion and ethnicity that celebrates difference as a mark of its identity, while competing for the same resources and opportunities in China’s business climate, it is unclear how the Chinese would respond and in what way the reactions to Jewish people would change.\n\nGenetic or cultural As mentioned in the student surveys above, there is a current of thought suggestive of a view that the Jews are behind the success of American business and intellectual achievements; that it is not the superiority of American culture, democracy, capitalism and free press, but the anomaly of the Jews escaping Europe and settling in America that is behind America’s great success and record of high achievement. This narrative seems to be used by some Chinese strata both to save face and to provide a justification for the relatively embryonic level of innovation and technological ability in China. I explored these themes further in a class of philosophy students and asked them to address the issue of whether Jewish success is genetic or social. I noted the consistency of the view that it is not genetic but social, and the possibility did occur to me that preferring a genetic cause of success would undermine or irritate their sense of national ambition and superiority, and this may have provided a motive for the uniform response that Jewish success was not born of genetic superiority. While not known for diversity of thought, I have observed amongst Chinese students that only the subject of patriotism (with its gamut of inclusions) produces uniformity of opinion to such high degrees. To the question of Taiwan’s status as part of China, no student would offer the slightest doubt about this fact. A subject with the potential to affect the national consciousness is not afforded the luxury of digression, individual musings or intellectual exploration. I of course agree with them that Jewish achievement is not genetic, but due to social conditions, but I am surprised that not one person pondered the possibility that the Jews possessed genetic qualities that bred success, leading me to suspect that their opinions were\n\n24\n\nJews and Judaism in modern China\n\nsubconsciously driven by patriotism and not by intellectual integrity. Asked if they thought Chinese success was genetic, the respondents were divided whether this was due to social or genetic factors. It is certainly fortunate that the stereotypes of Jews have not led to negative destructive repercussions. China’s own ambition for wealth and influence, its apparent ethnic patriotism and sense of exclusivism preclude it from sharing the European anti-Semitic hatred of Jews as elite power clichés. But there is nothing to guarantee that other forms of anti-Semitism will not emerge. Anti-Semitism is a fluid emotion which changes form and format over place and time. Furthermore there is a strong tendency to repudiate other nationalities in China, an inclination towards insularity. These are components which breed intolerance. Fused with totalitarian power and absence of intellectual and ethical checks and balances, the ability to exercise hatred against minorities is not a remote impossibility. It is unlikely that Jews will become a force of significance in China to warrant this reaction, but these emotions may be directed towards others.\n\nGovernment-inspired favor In the European context, the relationship of government and citizenry to its Jewish population was often an indicator of general tolerance levels and openness of society. The Chinese, perhaps aware of this, are careful to ensure that any hatred for Jews is not expressed. It is conceivable that attempts to express anti-Semitic opinions are repressed and internet sites blocked. The near-complete absence of open anti-Semitic material is so abnormal it suggests interference and censorship in the free expression of thought. Perhaps this is a positive step, but it may also suggest the intentional desire to be presented as a society tolerant of others. As to the question whether Chinese could become hostile to Jews in the future, many Jews joke that the reason for the absence of anti-Semitism in China is because there have been no Jews. It is not inconceivable that, as the Jewish community grows and integrates within Chinese life, some hostilities may emerge. If economic downturns threaten the stability of China, a convenient scapegoat may be sought. The history of the Jewish presence in Asia already provides a sufficient narrative to support accusations of these kinds; and the homogeneity of the Chinese public as it relates to patriotism is such that, if a group is perceived to threaten the country, little mercy would be shown. Present anti-Western attitudes expressed in rallies and demonstrations have not related or referred directly or indirectly to Jews, and it seems far from the lexicon of protest. Jews, for better or for worse, are still associated with economic development, and China’s economy shows few signs of faltering for the moment. No doubt the Chinese attitude towards Jews will evolve. As Western peoples, including Jews, build their own communities in China, as personal, cultural, economic and political interaction matures, as literature becomes\n\nChinese perceptions of Jews 25 more freely available, and as more Chinese travel and study abroad, the Chinese conceptions of “the other” and of the Jew will also evolve and perhaps take on enveloped significance within a Chinese context. As Chinese intellectual axes become more diverse and literary, and religious and political horizons expand beyond existing Asian norms, the Chinese attitudes to Jews and Judaism may express this diversity. This is not to say that anti-Semitism is a necessary or predestined outcome; on the contrary, as China increasingly commits itself to tolerance and peace, and as it continues its proactive steps to ensure that its citizenry are well balanced and integrated into the international community, the Jewish icon could become increasingly important and valuable, diversified from its present economic and political associations, and the Chinese history of friendly overtures to the Jews could triumphantly accompany it to become a paradigm of tolerance, and as a “fortunate” consequence shame other nations with less tolerant ethical records.\n\nJewish responses to Chinese perceptions It is indeed flattering to hear some of the comments Chinese express for Jews. Some Jews respond to what they hear with confusion; others are humored. Considering the wounds inflicted by European anti-Semitism, the Chinese philo-Semitic version is understandably a more appealing option. However, even though this is flattering, the majority of Jews hearing such comments are somewhat taken aback by the gross stereotyping and troubling superficiality. Many wonder what small trigger could cause these stereotypes to change and become negative and virile. Hearing superlatives can make people, Jewish or otherwise, feel veritably uncomfortable, and not a little astonished at the unrestrained acceptance and praise. In their respective homelands, being Jewish may be a source of embarrassment, such that Jews often disguise their identities amongst newfound friends, measuring the views and biases of acquaintances and colleagues until they feel more comfortable to admit their ethnicity, or until avoiding the subject is no longer reasonable. In China, this subconscious caution is thrown to the wind. Association as a Jew is an asset, an immediate source of respect where credit is given with nothing required in return, particularly special in a culture built very much on guan xi.22 It comes as a surprising source of empowerment, pride, and an easy way to gain kudos – be it in a taxi, with students, in a business meeting, with government officials, or even as a suitor! Wherever it may be, the response is generally positive. Recognition as a Jew does not come with the associations of killing Christ, drinking Christian blood, having horns, being tight-fisted, or being a saint or a traitor or cheat or any other biblical or medieval historical associations. This presents new emotions and unexpected circumstances for Jews and presents refreshing opportunities for the contemporary Jewish–Asian encounter. For more strongly identifying Jews, in contrast to assimilated Jews, the Chinese display of admiration is received with mixed feelings. On the one\n\n26\n\nJews and Judaism in modern China\n\nhand, it is an affirmation that Jewish culture and tradition has vindicated itself in the eyes of a mighty nation. In many ways the Chinese represent for Jews the ultimate “other”; in a strange way China represents a Jewish alter ego. A reflection of sorts, not of what is, but of what could have been. If the ancient Israelites had remained rooted in their land and had not been decimated and dispersed by the First Exile of 586 BCE, perhaps they may have grown in size and strength like the Chinese. China represents a condition that the Jews had and lost and now could never regain. China’s long history, its large and diverse populations, its isolation over the centuries and its absence from most of Jewish history naturally excludes it from blame for the persecution of Jews. Hence traditional Jews have nothing negative to say about the Chinese. Neither side blames the other for their mutual feelings of oppression. China’s resources and resourcefulness, its might and size, its long and splendid dynasties, and absolute sovereignty are admired by Jews without grudge. China represents one of the most exotic, distant and different lands on earth. Its strength is respected and admired. Its national pride, unity, determination and willingness to sacrifice are considered positive and praiseworthy by religious Jews. Its tremendous rise is a source of excitement and curiosity. David Ben Gurion, Israel’s first prime minister, was very quick to recognize, praise and support China in its earliest and most traumatic years. Many Jews came to China, in numbers disproportionate to other foreigners, throughout the most isolated and desolate periods of modern Chinese history. The sense of being small and in need of a patron comes to mind when Jews consider their future relations with Chinese. When Jews hear the praise offered by Chinese they interpret this as a possible hand of friendship and recognition extended between two civilizations. The sense that mutual cooperation can and should exist is prevalent. Chinese willingness to state that the Jews are a great nation, either like the Chinese, or greater than the Chinese, is a wonderful affirmation for orthodox and secular Jews alike, who often suffer from insecurities on various levels. On the other hand, in the eyes of orthodox Jews, this perception is based on entirely misguided reasoning. Not from money and economic prowess are the Jews the wisest of nations, but because of the Torah and the ethical and legal teachings of the rabbis. In the minds of orthodox Jews, the praise of Jews offered by the Chinese is praise of the Torah – of Jewish law and tradition, perceived as the nation’s guiding light; without land, king, natural resources, and with a fraction of the population, Jews credit the Torah and the guidance of the rabbis with Jewish survival. Though recognition of the nations of the world is expected, when it comes, it is surprising and explained as a matter of long-overdue process. The reply is not gratuitous or pridefilled but taken as something which is necessary, expected, and to be taken seriously and with modesty. The Jewish greatness is finally recognized. For the orthodox Jew, the Chinese are seen as a nation, not as individuals; they are stereotyped in much the same way as the Chinese stereotype the\n\nChinese perceptions of Jews 27 Jews; they are described as people who respect the Jewish people, and whose civilization is beginning to engage with Jewish civilization. The opening of communication with the Chinese is a curious possibility for the religious Jewish imagination, its horizons not yet explored. Over the decades a relatively high number of loosely affiliated Jews, disaffected with their Western or Jewish heritage, have come to China in search of a new identity and cultural horizon, and have embraced Chinese language and thought. Hearing how positively the Chinese view them specifically as Jews seems to leave an impression. A proportionally high number re-embrace Judaism more passionately, a surprising number becoming orthodox.23 This is related to a combination of factors including the positive affirmation of their Jewishness combined with their inability to fully assimilate into Chinese culture and their relentless sense of not belonging despite their determined will to do so. Jewish intellectuals may be offended by the stereotypes and worried by the possibilities that these images founded on error will change and turn into negative stereotypes also founded on error. For others, the generalization of a nation possessing homogeneous characteristics is anachronistic, a throwback to medieval thought, grossly stereotypical, anti-individualistic, archaic, primitive, and is in itself anti-Semitic in nature – presuming to define the Jews with one brushstroke. When Chinese attitudes to Jews are told from mouth to ear in Jewish communities in Israel and around the world, people respond positively to what sounds to them an incredible phenomenon. A place where Jews are actually liked and respected and where opportunities are open and waiting for them describes a Jewish utopia. In an almost knee-jerk reaction, China is viewed as a good country. This response runs contrary to or parallel with other, more universal concerns about China’s international reputation and human rights record. The Chinese attitude to the Jewish people represents to them a human rights standard on its own. Jewish tourists often choose to visit China because of its friendliness to Jews; and stories of cancelled Jewish tours to France, for example, in favor of China are told illustrating the sense of fraternity Jews feel with China and its reception of Jews. Flattered, many emotionally charged Jews feel that they are paradigmatic visitors in China, much like in ancient days, under the millet system of the Ottoman Empire; they see themselves as representatives of two civilizations meeting each other and forging historical ties of friendship. Perhaps more subconsciously than anything else, China’s respect and acceptance of Jews provides an option, in the back of Jewish people’s minds, as an escape route, a place where Jews could flee in times of trouble or persecution. An undetermined percentage of Jews are actualizing this option and coming to China. The ripple seems to be growing larger every year, including Oriental Jews, Russian, French and American Jews, and an increasing flow of Israelis who are seeking residence and business opportunities in China’s trade cities.\n\n28\n\nJews and Judaism in modern China\n\nConclusion No doubt, in response to these circumstances, Jews may discover fertile territory for the expression of new, less guarded attitudes. Some may fall into a false sense of security and even into a sense of self-grandeur as Chinese look at them with curiosity, respect and praise. A fool may think he is more clever; a poor man may think he is richer; a plump suitor may think he is irresistibly attractive. It should be interesting to observe what personalities and ideas emerge from Jewish communities growing up in an environment with pre-conceived positive stereotypes unencumbered by negative and derogatory sentiments. Ideas are never static. Observing how these perceptions change, adapt, and respond to political and economic conditions over the next fifty years of Asian social development is worthy of attention and valuable to many disciplines of research.\n\nNotes 1 See Saloman Wald, China and the Jewish People: Old Civilizations in a New Era (Jerusalem: Jewish People Policy Planning Institute, 2004), pp. 94–103, 110.

Generations of rote learning and mindless adherence to “the party line” has dulled cognitive creativity, intellectual curiosity and the ability to entertain conflicting thought processes. 9 However, it is allowable under the provisions of the Nationality Law of the People’s Republic of China, articles 7 and 8. Perhaps the most pertinent example here is that of the celebrated Polish-Russian Jewish journalist and author Israel Epstein (1915–2005), who became a Chinese citizen in 1957, quite incredibly given the political environment in China at that time. He was one of the few foreign-born non-Chinese to become a member of the Communist Party of China; he served in the politburo and on many high-level committees, had close relationships with Chinese leaders from Mao to Hu, and he remained highly regarded and wielded not a little influence in Chinese politics throughout his lifetime. 10 For a more detailed discussion of this, see Chapter 4. 11 For more information on the Jewish community of Kaife"
