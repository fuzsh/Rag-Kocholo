Love Actually actress Martine McCutcheon has defended the iconic Christmas film following recent criticism.

Some viewers take issue with the 2003 movie's lack of diversity, while the film has also been called sexist. In the storyline involving McCutcheon, her character Natalie, who is the love interest of Hugh Grant's Prime Minister, has her weight joked about multiple times.

Some have described this as "fat-shaming", although McCutcheon herself takes no issue with the jokes. In fact, in a new interview with the Daily Mirror, McCutcheon defended the movie.

"First of all, it's another woman [Annie] that mentions Natalie's weight and Natalie herself. Of course, it's easy to say now: 'We would have done this, we would have done that,' but I also think that the characters weren't being PC," McCutcheon said.

"They weren't perfect humans – they were talking about their insecurities, their affairs. Natalie, bless her, is so innocent in telling the prime minister about her insecurities. I think that's part of what made it so charming and real.

"There are a lot of things that you're not allowed to say now, but I think that in a film that covers so much emotion and so much love, you need a little bit of reality in there – it's not always about ticking all the boxes."

Writer and director Richard Curtis recently addressed some of the controversies around the film's lack of diversity and said that this issue now makes him feel "uncomfortable".

"There are things that you would change, but thank God society is changing," Curtis said.

"My film is bound in some moments to feel out of date. The lack of diversity makes me feel uncomfortable and a bit stupid."
