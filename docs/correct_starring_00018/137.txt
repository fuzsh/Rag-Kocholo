Martine McCutcheon has shared the shock reason she never watches classic Christmas movie Love Actually – despite starring in it. The BBC EastEnders legend spoke out in a new interview.

She said: "I never watch it… I can’t watch myself, but my family adore it and are so proud that I’m a part of it - as am I!" Martine also opened up on her Christmas plans to the Sun newspaper.

She said: "I’ve been so busy, I’m more just excited to spend time with all the family without worrying about anything. I would love some new pyjamas, some silky ones in a dusty blue colour, and obviously every girl loves jewellery!”

It comes after Richard Curtis said that the lack of diversity in Love Actually now makes him feel “a bit stupid”. “There are things that you would change,” said Curtis.

"But thank God society is changing. My film is bound in some moments to feel out of date. The lack of diversity makes me feel uncomfortable and a bit stupid.” Curtis added: “There is such extraordinary love that goes on every minute in so many ways, all the way around the world, and makes me wish my film was better.”

“I do think that the way to think about life is that every day has the potential just to be gorgeous. I think when you get it right, films can act as a reminder of how lovely things can be and how there are all sorts of things which we might pass by, which are in fact the best moments to our lives," he added.

The film stars Keira Knightley, Hugh Grant, Emma Thompson and Alan Rickman, as well as Laura Linney and Thomas Brodie-Sangster. Colin Firth and Liam Neeson too. Martine plays the Prime Minister's assistant in the 2003 classic.
