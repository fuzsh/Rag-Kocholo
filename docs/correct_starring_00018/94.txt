Love Actually star Martine McCutcheon admits she was actually 'in love' with co-star Hugh Grant during the filming of the iconic Christmas movie.

The 44-year-old actress revealed she was very nervous when they started filming as she had always had a crush on him.

"In the first scene we filmed, I had to run and straddle Hugh at the airport. I felt so insecure and petrified I'd knock him over," she told DailyMail.

"Hugh had always been my crush and I was a little bit in love with him.

"He was so gracious, encouraging and kind, and wanted me to shine."

"That was 18 years ago but we're still in touch. He's so happy and content - the happiest that he's ever been."

The mother-of-one says she hates watching the movie back because she is 'always critical' of her performance.

But she's excited for her five-year-old son Rafferty, being old enough to watch the movie this year.

"I'm so proud of this film," she told HELLO! Magazine.

"When Rafferty grows up and has children of his own, I want them all to know its message of love is what I stand for."
