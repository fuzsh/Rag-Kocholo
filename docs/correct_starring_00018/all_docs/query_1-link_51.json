        "text": "Love Actually star Martine McCutcheon has claimed she was rejected by bosses on the genealogy TV show Who Do You Think You Are? as her family was full of “wrong ’uns”.\n\nThe British actress and singer said BBC bosses were initially excited when she said she would take part – until they had a cruel change of a heart, The Sun reports.\n\nCelebrities appearing on Who Do You Think You Are? are given the opportunity to take a trip back in time and trace their family histories – something that Martine says she was robbed of.\n\nAfter finding out about her family past – with some of her ancestors having spent time in prison – Martine said the BBC abruptly rejected her.\n\nThe 45-year-old revealed: “They called me and they were just really disappointed because there’s a load of mud huts and wrong ’uns that they just didn’t talk about.\n\n“They got all excited when they thought I would like to do it and then they called me and went, ‘This isn’t going to work.’”\n\nThe mum-of-one added: “I probably am a typical East End mum. I’m full of praise, full of love and affection, but I’m also like, ‘Enough is enough.’\n\n“Most people are posher than me, that’s not hard.\n\n“I still go back to where I’m from, still see my friends, still see my family.\n\n“When I go back to Bethnal Green they think I speak beautifully. They go, ‘Don’t you speak nice now?’”\n\nThe Sun has contacted the BBC for comment.\n\nThe hit show, which first premiered in 2004, has seen countless famous faces find out where they really come from – one of whom was EastEnders actor Danny Dyer.\n\nWhen the 44-year-old appeared on the show, it was revealed that he was related to Edward III and William the Conqueror.\n\nAfter his stint on the program, Danny told the BBC: “I‘m still in shock at the fact that I’m related to such important people.”"
