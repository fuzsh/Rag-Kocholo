        "text": "As Prime Minister David (AKA Hugh Grant) once said, \"Whenever I get gloomy with the state of the world, I think about the arrivals gate at Heathrow Airport.\" This holiday season, a few lucky travelers will definitely feel the opposite of gloomy when they meet a Love Actually cast member at the onscreen PM's favorite London attraction.\n\nMartine McCutcheon (who played David's love interest, Natalie, in the 2003 film) and a team of airport volunteers kicked off a campaign this week to welcome weary travelers to London with signs, hugs, and treats in the airport's arrivals terminal.\n\nAccording to a Heathrow press release, the scene at the end of Love Actually when Natalie runs and jumps into David's arms at the arrivals gate was found to be the U.K.'s favorite part of the movie. And now, as part of the new campaign, Martine and her fellow volunteers are recreating that beloved scene — sans the ensuing makeout sesh — for some of the one million travelers expected to arrive at Heathrow for the holidays. From now until 7 p.m. local time on Saturday, December 23, those unable to pick up their loved ones from the airport can submit their flight info for a chance to have Martine or another volunteer greet them with a smile at the arrivals.\n\nIn the release, Martine said that she's excited to recreate the scene. \"It was one of my all-time favorite scenes to film and even now I get so excited every time I'm at Heathrow — welcoming someone home is such a great feeling that never gets old!\" she said. \"At Christmas, this is truer than ever. I love that Heathrow is giving everyone the chance to welcome home their loved one, through this amazing team of volunteers who are spreading Christmas joy at the airport and bringing us all a bit closer together this Christmas.\""
