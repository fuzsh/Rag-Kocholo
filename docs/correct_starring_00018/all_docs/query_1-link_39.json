        "text": "One of the more anticipated events leading up to Red Nose Day on Thursday, May 25, is the short reunion film \"Red Nose Day Actually,\" featuring much of the \"Love Actually\" cast. Martine McCutcheon, who played Hugh Grant's love interest \"Natalie\" in the romance classic, spoke about her excitement reuniting with her co-stars and why she believes the film has had an enduring impact.\n\nThe original film came out 13 years ago. Why do you think fans continue to have a fascination with it?\n\n\"It's such a wonderful feeling that something that was so special to you has lasted for so long. For me, it was so exciting and something I knew I was going to treasure for a lifetime. But I didn't know that the public would cherish it for a lifetime. Everyone is saying it's kind of like \"It's a Wonderful Life,\" and part of their Christmas ritual now. We had a dinner recently with (Director Richard Curtis) and he was just blown away too. It was his directing debut and in the grand scheme of things with everything happening with September 11th we hoped our little message would help people for a short time. And here we are 13 years later and this movie has taken on it's own thing.\n\nWhy do you think the film connected with people the way it has and did you get the sense at the time you were creating something special.\n\nFor me the reason why it touched so many people...I mean at the time it got mixed reviews. For some it was like 'Oh, its just emotional stuff. It's romance. It's just a rom-com,' and you forget how clever Richard is in talking about really serious, poignant things as human beings. He's got the most amazing human touch. At the end of the day everyone in the world can identify with the connection of love. We've all lost love or have yearned for love. Its the one thing we all have in common.\n\nWhat was it like for you being reunited with some of your cast members after all these years?\n\nIt was amazing. It was so lovely to see everyone. The only way I can explain it is you have this amazing experience when you go to college and you experience this time in your life that you'll never share with anyone else. When I got back together with those guys it was just so nice to see everyone. As one of the younger people in the cast at the time and one with the least experience they really took care of me. It was quite emotional to see everyone again.\n\nU.S. & World\n\nStories that affect your life across the U.S. and around the world.\n\nThe reunion movie is taking part because of the Red Nose Day charity. Why is that significant?\n\nIt's a fantastic clever link by Richard. At the end of the day it's about people coming together and understanding others struggles and the different curveballs people chuck at you in life. To link \"Love Actually\" with comic relief is such a brilliant teaming of two things.\n\nWould you be interested in full-feature length sequel of the film if the opportunity arose?\n\nAny actress would be crazy not to entertain anything that Richard does. If he does something he does it well. He does it with his full heart he's so passionate about his charity work and comic relief. If he does another film I'd one hundred percent be into it. I'd entertain anything he does. He's too good not to.\n\nCatch the \"Love Actually\" sequel \"Red Nose Day Actually,\" 10 p.m. Thursday on NBC."
