        "text": "Love Actually actress Martine McCutcheon has shared a sombre Instagram post a few days after revealing her younger brother died unexpectedly.\n\nMcCutcheon, who played Natalie, the love interest to Hugh Grant's Prime Minister, shared a photo of her and her seven-year-old-son, Rafferty, who she says \"keeps [her] keeping on\" in her time of grief.\n\n\"This little monkey needs me no matter what…,\" she wrote. \"He keeps me keeping on. We've been busy this week and weekend and it definitely seems to help me when I see the world continuing to spin and life ticking along.\"\n\nREAD MORE: Selena Gomez and Hailey Bieber silence feud rumours\n\nREAD MORE: Rebel Wilson sparks engagement talk\n\nThe actress spoke candidly about how she has been feeling since revealing the news her 31-year-old brother Laurence John, who was nicknamed 'LJ', had died two weeks prior, just a month before he was due to get married.\n\n\"I can't help but look at people and wonder what their story of grief is? Life isn't always easy and I think human beings are so brave… I'm in awe,\" she wrote.\n\n\"I've mostly felt out of my body and on autopilot – I think that's my way of being able to deal with my shock and grief, along with my responsibilities simultaneously.\n\n\"And then suddenly, with no apparent trigger, waves of emotion have come crashing over me\"\n\nIn her announcement last week, McCutcheon said doctors had \"no medical explanation\" for why LJ, who had \"a mild form of special needs\", had passed so suddenly.\n\n\"My heart is forever broken,\" McCutcheon began her post from last week. \"My baby brother, my gentle giant, sadly passed away, suddenly, 2 weeks ago. He was 31 years old.\n\n\"There is no medical explanation as to why we lost him so soon and whilst we investigate further, we are having to accept that nothing will bring our boy back to us. \"\n\nHeartbreakingly, McCutcheon revealed her brother was due to get married next month, and had spent the months before his death preparing for the wedding.\n\n\" LJ fell in love and was due to get married next month… I was asked to be bridesmaid and the last time I saw him, was a few days before he passed,\" she revealed.\n\nFor a daily dose of 9Honey, subscribe to our newsletter here\n\n\"He, Jack [McCutcheon's husband] and his future stepson had been to try on their wedding suits and then they came back to have dinner with his fiancée and the family to see our new home.\"\n\n\"My heart aches for all who have lost him. But my heart breaks for our mum, his dad John & his Step parents. You should never outlive your children.\n\nREAD MORE: Beloved '80s star's death revealed on Facebook\n\n\"I'm scared to live without you LJ but I know you will want us to truly live, laugh and love in your memory. I will try, I promise.\"\n\nMcCutcheon's last acting role to date was in the British feel-good film The Bromley Boys in 2018.\n\nIn 2012 she married Britsh singer-songwriter Jack McManus, and the pair welcomed their son Rafferty in 2015."
