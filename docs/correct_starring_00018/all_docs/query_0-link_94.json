        "text": "MARTINE McCutcheon looks slimmer than ever after revealing the secrets behind her jaw-dropping weight loss.\n\nThere's no denying she looks completely different compared to when she starred as Natalie in the Christmas classic Love Actually back in 2003.\n\nMartine appears alongside Hugh Grant in the flick, and her weight is repeatedly reference throughout. Natalie explains that her boyfriend dumped her, adding: \"Nobody wants a girlfriend with thighs the size of tree trunks.\"\n\nA colleague refers to Natalie as \"the chubby girl\" and comments on her \"sizable arse and huge thighs\". And even Natalie's dad refers to her as \"plumpy\".\n\nAnd, although Martine was clearly far from any of those things at the time of the film, she has slimmed down in recent years.\n\nIn one Instagram snap, showing Martine, 46, posing in her garden, fans couldn't get over her figure.\n\nOne asked: \"How have you got so tiny all of a sudden?\"\n\nAnother said: \"You look the best you've ever looked!\"\n\nAnd a third said: \"You are a beautiful girl and you look amazing.\"\n\nFormer EastEnders actress Martine previously confessed that she was a fan of the Cambridge Weight Plan diet.\n\nShe said: \"I’ve spent so long fighting to feel healthy again, I didn’t want to do anything too drastic that was going to make me feel lousy.\n\n“But after having Rafferty I found it so tough to lose my baby weight and that does start to affect your self-esteem.”\n\nThe Perfect Moment singer, who gave birth to son Rafferty in 2015, also said she found it helpful to have a one-on-one consultant.\n\n\"My loss was a tiny bit slower than the average person but to be honest I expected that as many diets/food plans didn't work for me at all as the lymes disease and m.e can really play havoc with how your system works,\" she told OK! magazine.\n\n\"Plus my consultant Donna stressed that my health is the most important thing so I took things a little more slowly whilst feeling more energised and even with health issues I've still managed to do it!\n\n\"Only 5 and a half weeks and My BMI is in a much healthier range - and on my step of the plan I love that I can still have my green juices, porridge and real food.\"\n\nMartine was diagnosed with ME, otherwise known as Chronic Fatigue Syndrome, in 2011 and later revealed she had been diagnosed with Lyme disease.\n\nShe also suffers from Fibromyalgia, which causes pain all over the body.\n\nOpening up about living with the conditions, Martine told HELLO!: \"I look at it that when I get symptoms or when my body starts clanging, it's a sign for me to pace myself, rest.\n\n\"And I think it gives me that when somebody else would just logically think, 'Oh, I need to just take a rest', mentally, I don't do that, so my body does it for me.\n\n\"So, yeah, I've definitely learned to look at it as a good messenger rather than something that simply gets in the way.\""
