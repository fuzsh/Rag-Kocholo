        "text": "It's been 14 years since Love Actually graced our cinema screens. But, given it's the Christmas period, the compilation of heartwarming, kinda cringey and downright bleak love stories have been on repeat on TV screens across the world.\n\nAside from her four-year tenure as Tiffany Mitchell in Eastenders, Martine McCutcheon is best-known for playing Natalie in the film.\n\nAs she looks to recreate the iconic ending of the film with Heathrow airport this week, she spoke to Cosmopolitan UK about how she feels about the film, after all this time, and reveals some juicy backstage secrets, too.\n\nThe movie was filmed back to front\n\n\"The reunion at Heathrow Airport scene is my favourite. It brings back the happiest memories because it was our first day of filming. It was the first day for everybody and obviously a lot of the cast hadn’t worked together yet.. It was a really lovely start, we got a feel for everybody and the team and film. We were all really excited that we were all working together on our first day rather than it just being me and Hugh [Grant] or Emma [Thompson] and Alan [Rickman]. It was a really lovely start to the film and it was good to shoot it that way because it needed that excitement and sprinkle of fairy dust for the end. We all just genuinely felt the excitement because it was our first day. I’m sure Richard Curtis [the director] planned it all, of course.”\n\nNatalie and David reuniting at Heathrow airport at the end of the film\n\nThe part of Natalie was written especially for me\n\n\"I was really nervous. It was a big cast with huge stars and I felt really out of my depth so just wanted to do a great job and earn my place amongst them, thank god all these years later I think I just about did it.\n\n\"Apparently the part was written for me because Richard had seen me in My Fair Lady and Eastenders, he’d followed my career over the years. Himself and Emma [Freud], his other half, luckily loved what I’d been doing. They had run it by Hugh and he thought I was perfect. I didn’t know any of this until later on down the line so it made me a feel a lot more confident about doing it all, knowing the part was written for me.\"\n\nI requested to do press interviews with Bill Nighy\n\n\"Bill and myself chose to do all the press junkets together because we just both had the naughtiest humour out of everybody. We just had a rip roaring, side-splitting time. With press junkets it’s the same questions over and over so we would just find new ways to find it funny, exciting and silly and have our own little secret jokes. We were in stitches and people didn’t know why but it was great. I’m still in touch with Bill now.\"\n\nI made some great friends with my castmates\n\n\"You made bonds with who you spent the most time with and, for me, that was Hugh. The late great Alan Rickman was also really kind to me and absolutely lovely.\"\n\nMartine McCutcheon and Hugh Grant at a Love Actually premiere\n\nMy favourite line is...\n\n\"'Eight is a lot of legs, David' - there's something about the way she [Joanna Bacon, who played Natalie's Mum] says it, it just tickles your funny bones. She's brilliant, a scene-stealer.'\"\n\nThis is what Natalie's actual job is\n\n\"She was basically Prime Minister David's PA/secretary. From what I can gather and from what Richard said, that was her job.\"\n\nOn Natalie being the subject of major body-shaming\n\n\"For me, it was always the point that she was, according to Richard, a beautiful girl. She turned the prime minister’s head and her issues weren’t real issues. Every woman thinks there’s something wrong with them when in actual fact, as Hugh has said in other films, they are perfect and lovely as they are. She was meant to be the embodiment of that and I think sometimes people have missed that point.\n\n\"All the things she worried about and all the things that her boyfriend said she was because he wasn’t with her anymore... that was the whole point, you’re meant to go: ‘No she’s not, I think she’s lovely!' because that’s how men think about a lot of women who constantly criticise each other and themselves. That was meant to be the message and I think somewhere along the way, people didn’t get that. But that’s why I was happy to do it and play that part.\"\n\nDavid and Natalie would still be together now\n\n\"I think they would have stayed together. Obviously we had the Love Actually comic relief reunion earlier this year. As far as I can see - and who am I to tread on the genius toes of Richard Curtis - they would stay together, had a couple of children. Life, politically, would have had a lot of ups and downs, but she would have been making him laugh every step of the way.\"\n\nKaren discovering the necklace isn't for her is the most heartbreaking scene for me\n\n\"When Emma Thompson's character Karen finds the necklace and tries to just straighten the bed and start doing her silly, normal everyday things when she’s just realised that her world’s been blown apart... that's the most heartbreaking scene for me. She does it so beautifully, she’s just exquisite, just an amazing actress.\"\n\nI have treasured a couple of souvenirs from the set\n\n\"I still have the little gold necklace Natalie wore and some earrings in my jewellery box, they mean the world.\"\n\nThe Love Actually cast at the Paris premiere\n\nI'm still in touch with some of the cast\n\n\"Aside from Bill, there's others I keep in touch with. We’re not on the phone every week but we've stayed in touch. Once you’re involved with something like that and been part of it you never forget. It’s such an intense and exciting thing. It’s become such a massive thing too that, when you bump into each other, you know they had that moment with you and it’s that special time that no one will understand unless they were part of it.\"\n\nMartine at Heathrow airport\n\nMartine McCutcheon was at Heathrow Airport on Tuesday welcoming passengers for Christmas with their own Love Actually moment. Direct message @HeathrowAirport on Twitter this week to arrange for a loved-one to have a personalised welcome from a Heathrow Volunteer as they fly in for Christmas."
