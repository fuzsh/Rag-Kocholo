        "text": "In 2003, an ensemble cast combined for a loosely related set of love stories set against the backdrop of Christmas. Richard Curtis wrote and directed Love Actually (2003), set in London, England to the larger point that love is actually all around us.\n\nSeveral intersecting love stories are shown against the backdrop of the narrated perspective that opens the movie. The arrivals gate at Heathrow Airport and the messages from victims of the September 11th, 2001 attacks show love rather than hate. The movie immediately moves into interconnected stories of love, including that of Natalie and United Kingdom Prime Minister David, as portrayed by Martine McCutcheon and Hugh Grant, respectively. Natalie and David seemingly meet on the prime minister‘s first day in office.\n\nKaren is David’s sister, and a mother to two kids with Harry. Mia, Harry’s secretary as the managing director of a design agency, offers suggestive behavior that leads to at least emotional temptation. The story reveals itself through the movie, with the payoff on the evening before Christmas. Emma Thompson, Alan Rickman and Heike Makatsch portrayed Karen, Harry and Mia, respectively. The music of Joni Mitchell is relevant to this story.\n\nAn early conversation between Daniel and close friend Karen reveals Karen expressing sympathy for the death of Daniel’s wife. In the presence of that grief, Daniel’s stepson Sam expresses his love for Sam has crowded out grief at losing his mother. Sam attends the same school as his love interest, Joanna, plus Bernie and Daisy, the children of Karen and Harry. Drum playing and travel factor into the love story that unravels for Sam and Joanna, with feelings between Carol and Daniel seemingly developing. Liam Neeson, Thomas Brodie-Sangster, Olivia Olson, Claudia Schiffer, William Wadham and Lulu Popplewell portrayed Daniel, Sam, Joanna, Carol, Bernie and Daisy, respectively.\n\nWhile the story of seeking a top hit for the Christmas season navigates its way through much of the Love Actually story, the subtext of an aging rockstar competing against more youthful competition leads in many different directions. The promotional efforts for putting Billy Mack over leaves Joe metaphorically on the outside looking in. Things take unexpected turns for the pair, with the results bearing relevance for them as well as for the love story of Joanna and Sam. Bill Nighy portrayed Billy Mack as Gregor Fisher portrayed Joe.\n\nThe sacrifice of familial love in the face of pursuing romantic love as Harry’s design agency brings about feelings of love. Sarah and Karl have been pining for each other for more than two years when Harry suggests to Sarah that perhaps the time has come to express her feelings to Karl. The agonizing process almost gets there in multiple ways, with the added complication of Sarah’s brother Michael struggling with mental health issues in a hospital. The question of intimacy and boundaries demonstrate interesting complexity for what love can become. Laura Linney, Rodrigo Santoro and Michael Fitzgerald portray Sarah, Karl and Michael, respectively.\n\nA well-contained love triangle of sorts emerges when Peter’s best man at his wedding to Juliet, Mark, films the wedding. An interesting set of surprises give life to this story, from the wedding ceremony itself to the slowly unraveling truths that reveal the truth. That a different take for who knows what when emerges to the story of Karen, Harry and Mia offers a satisfying difference when considered together. Keira Knightley, Chiwetel Ejiofor and Andrew Lincoln portrayed Juliet, Peter and Mark, respectively.\n\nJamie attended Peter and Juliet’s wedding ceremony on his own since his girlfriend, as portrayed by Sienna Guillory, had been ill. Coming home to check on her between the ceremony and the reception, Jamie finds his girlfriend sharing physical intimacy with his brother, as portrayed by Dan Fredenburgh. Distraught, Jamie meets a Portuguese housekeeper named Aurélia where he was staying. That the two didn’t speak the same language didn’t stop that these two might have feelings for one another. Lúcia Moniz portrayed Aurélia. As the movie’s theme played out, the payoff for what comes next arrived on Christmas Eve.\n\nInternational travel offered success in unexpected ways for Colin and Tony, with Colin having multiple unsuccessful attempts to attract English women. Having failed to convince Mia, Juliet and Nancy, the wedding caterer at Peter and Juliet’s wedding, to date him, Colin decides that his English accent will attract women from the United States. Heading to Milwaukee, Wisconsin, Colin makes his own luck with a bit of positive outcomes for himself and Tony. Abdul Salis, Kris Marshall and Julia Davis portrayed Tony, Colin and Nancy, respectively.\n\nThe story of John and Judy, two socially shy body doubles that as characters in Love Actually portray risqué behavior in movies, the two find themselves able to connect emotionally away from the workplace. Portrayed by Martin Freeman and Joanna Page, respectively, John and Judy attend the Christmas pageant that meant so much to Sam and Joanna, Daniel and Carol, David and Natalie, and Daisy. A happy ending for the pair matches a recurring theme for the film, which managed to invoke jewelry salesman Rufus in a pair of key movie moments. Rowan Atkinson portrayed Rufus.\n\nThe movie Love Actually is appreciated to a large extent by Lynn of Matt Lynn Digital very much. There are multiple stories that stick with her, though the Harry, Karen and Mia storyline seems to standout more for her than the others. The romantic comedy aspect of the movie set against the season of Christmas also resonates. I personally give Love Actually as written and directed by Richard Curtis 4.0-stars on a scale of 1-to-5.\n\nMatt – Saturday, December 17, 2022"
