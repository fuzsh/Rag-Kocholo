        "text": "MARTINE McCutcheon was famously branded “the chubby girl” in Love Actually – but behind the scenes, the actress has continued to battle personal demons over her weight.\n\nThis week, the 45-year-old stunned fans with two shots of her svelte body and “endless legs” as she relaxed in her garden with a cool drink.\n\nThe former EastEnders actress and Perfect Moment singer noted she was in her “happy place” as relaxed in a chair with her legs on the table.\n\nBut Martine wasn’t always as happy with her body – after being the target of body shamers online and weight jibes on screen.\n\nHer career began at four years old, when as a child star she featured in adverts for Pears soap and the American drink Kool-Aid.\n\nAfter that, she became a model and briefly toured with the girl band Milan before getting her big break in acting.\n\n'The chubby girl'\n\nMartine played Tiffany in EastEnders for four years until 1999, savoured a short-lived pop career and then was cast as Hugh Grant’s tea lady in Love Actually.\n\nIn the 2003 Richard Curtis film, Martine’s character Natalie was the butt of several jokes about weight.\n\nShe was branded “plumpy” by her father and referred to as “chubby” multiple times in the beloved Christmas rom-com.\n\nIn the final scenes, love interest Hugh – who played the prime minister – also referenced sleights about her size by commenting: “God you weigh a lot!”\n\n“Oh, shut your face,” Martine fired back as the pair smooched on screen.\n\nLove Actually 'misconception'\n\nIn the years that followed, many fumed over the allegedly sizeist comments in Love Actually but the actress defended the film in a 2017 Cosmopolitan interview.\n\nMartine said: “You’re meant to go, ‘No, she’s not [overweight], I think she’s lovely.’”\n\nShe insisted that Natalie was meant to be “a beautiful girl” – highlighted by her being able to “turn the prime minister’s head”.\n\nMartine said the jibes were meant to help other women realise that their “issues” with weight “weren’t real issues”.\n\nShe explained: “Every woman thinks there’s something wrong with them when in actual fact... they are perfect and lovely as they are.\n\n“[Natalie] was meant to be the embodiment of that and I think sometimes people have missed that point.”\n\nFeeling like a \"piece of meat\"\n\nDespite Martine’s call for body positivity, the star revealed she wasn’t always as confident about her physical appearance.\n\nDue to “growing up in the public eye”, she felt “scrutinised” and pressure to maintain a slimmer frame during her younger years.\n\nIn 2016, she said: “I was always conscious of staying as thin as I could be.\n\n“It looked better on camera, meant I could fit into size 8 sample sizes and it was easier and more affordable with stylists.”\n\nWhen asked how many hurtful comments affected her, she admitted “there were hundreds” and said she body shamed “loads of times”.\n\n“People spoke about me like I was a piece of meat and I can’t believe that’s still going on in this day and age,” Martine added.\n\n'Dangerous' snubs she started to ignore\n\nMartine began to find contentment after marrying singer-songwriter Jack McManus in 2012. After having son Rafferty three years later, she realised her priority should be “being healthy”.\n\nMartine revealed it “took a long time” to learn not to “care what people think” and find happiness from within.\n\n“It’s water off a duck’s back because I have an anchor within myself but it’s so dangerous when you are younger,” she said.\n\nAfter having a C-section for her son, she gradually started exercising again but maintains she “didn’t put any pressure” on herself like she did in her younger years.\n\nMartine said: “I am who I want to be and, most importantly, the weight I want to be when I want to be it.\n\n“If I choose to be a size 10 or a size 16, it’s my choice. Women’s weight fluctuates, and the constant comments on size is boring.”\n\nAt the time, Martine was at a size 12 and felt she was in a “nice place” where she was less obsessed with her appearance.\n\nShe continued: “I’m not fighting anything either way.”\n\n‘Squidgy’ stomach she learned to love\n\nBut like many mothers, Martine did have difficulties trying to shift pregnancy weight and the effects it had on her body.\n\nShe said: “One thing I cannot change though is that my stomach has become soft.\n\n“No matter how curvy I was in the past I always had a flat stomach but now it’s squidgy.”\n\nHowever, Martine felt the change to her body shape was “worth it” whenever she looked at her son and added: “What can you do?”\n\nA year later, she explained that having a “curvy body” was better – but she did miss the days when she was slimmer.\n\nIn 2017, she told the Daily Mail: “I hate the fact that I am not skinny… I am 5ft 7in and I've big boobs and hips and a little waist.\n\n“I actually prefer a curvy body, but for ease every day, it would be lovely to be straight up and down – then you can throw on anything and it will hang nicely.”\n\nLosing weight and feeling great\n\nMartine managed to lose one stone and 21 inches from her body thanks to following the Cambridge Weight Plan.\n\nShe said her journey was “a tiny bit slower than the average person” because of health battles with Lyme Disease, chronic fatigue syndrome ME and Fibromyalgia.\n\nOn Instagram, the star wrote: “I took things a little more slowly whilst feeling more energised and even with health issues I've still managed to do it!”\n\nMartine revealed her body mass index (BMI) was “in a much healthier range” after five weeks on the weight loss plan and she’s continued to tone-up since.\n\nMartine told HELLO! magazine motherhood helped to change how she felt about being famous and her appearance.\n\nShe said: “It sounds like such a cliché but having Rafferty really did put everything into perspective.\n\n“All those things I’d worried about all my life – the career, the weight – all seemed trivial in comparison to this little person we had created.\n\n“Once I’d got that perspective, the rest seemed to fall into place.’\n\n‘Health and wealth’\n\nMartine carried on with her self-improvement journey and this year seems positive about the future and her figure.\n\nLast month, she told The Sun on Sunday she felt \"more fulfilled, confident and sexy\" than she did in her twenties.\n\nMartine added: \"People always thought I was really confident, but it was a good act. Genuine confidence took time for me.\"\n\nIn April, she was signed to Elite Model World – a feat she described as “a dream come true” that she was “SO excited” about.\n\nThe following month in an Instagram post to mark her birthday, the star wrote: “Ready to walk into the next 45 years with health, wealth, family, friends, fun & style!”\n\nYesterday, she shared a sultry snap of herself relaxing in the garden, which received more than 37,600 likes and reams of positive comments.\n\nThey included Saturdays star Frankie Bridge, who wrote “those legs!” alongside the fire emoji and singer Pixie Lott who posted heart-eyed emojis.\n\nNadine Coyle commented that Martine looked “absolutely stunning!!!!!”.\n\nLouise Redknapp posted several applause emojis along with the comment: “Yes babe.”"
