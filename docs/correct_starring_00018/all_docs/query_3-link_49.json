        "text": "Welcome to Metro.co.uk‘s The Big Questions, where we ask, well, the big questions (and the smaller ones too), and this week, we’re diving deep with Martine McCutcheon.\n\nMartine is a total all-rounder, having found success in the acting and music industry and performed in everything from West End shows to musicals, soaps, films and more.\n\nFinding fame as a teenager with her role as firecracker Tiffany in EastEnders, Martine now graces our screens every Christmas as Natalie in Love Actually, one of the most beloved festive films of the 21st century.\n\nNow the mum-of-one has teamed up with Vodafone 5G to help a woman who lost her voice box to cancer to sing again using an extraordinary piece of technology.\n\nMetro.co.uk sat down with Martine to speak about the emotional campaign, her own singing career, EastEnders, acting and – of course – Love Actually, as we ring in the festive season.\n\nYou’ve been an actor and a musician – which are you most comfortable in?\n\nIt’s two very different joys – the joy of the standing ovation and the energy of people, but also this feeling of being part of this magic team where you’re stood on set and you hear the whirr of the camera going, where you feel “I’m home.” I love being on set.\n\nI trained at the Italia Conti, and they taught you – whether you loved it or not – to be able to act, sing and dance to a certain level, purely because they wanted you to be employed. If you couldn’t act but you could dance and sing, or couldn’t dance but, you know, you had more of a chance of getting jobs.\n\nFor me, my favourite scenario which hasn’t happened yet actually, would be to do a musical film. I’ve done musicals, I’ve done music, I’ve done film and TV, but I’ve never put it all together. It’s full on when you’re filming, it’s 17-hour days and sometimes you’re only used for an hour of that day. I’ve got a young son, and I love what I’m doing because I can be more flexible and be there for him.\n\nRight now I like doing little cameo roles and TV stuff and bits of presenting and loads of branding work has happened since lockdown which I found really exciting, that’s been amazing. But when I put it all together that’s when I sort of come alive, when I’m singing, dancing, acting and you’re catching it on camera as well.\n\nDo you watch Love Actually at Christmas?\n\nI have never, ever been able to watch myself back on anything! When I’m on set and I’m looking at the monitor I can be objective then and get my actress head on and know what I need to do differently… but once it’s done and it’s in the can, there’s something so weird about seeing yourself on the TV or a huge cinema screen.\n\nI’m not the only one, a lot of actors I speak to, even though they love the process, watching it back is really odd. My family love the film, but I’m like “Oh God, I’m gonna go and make dessert” or whatever it is when it comes on.\n\nI’m blown away that all these years later it’s this phenomenon and such a part of people’s Christmas and people have it in their hearts and love it so much, I think it’s a real honour, I think it’s lovely.\n\nHow do you feel the movie has aged over the last 20 years? There are a few comments about your character’s weight…\n\nFrom another woman! From another woman! I know!\n\nI mean obviously it was 20 years ago it was made, and if [Richard Curtis] were to make it now so much has changed, so much is better. But I also think that when you’re telling a story about complicated love and human beings and their vulnerability, there’s also something to be said for that part, and the Emma Thompson part, and Andrew Lincoln being in love with his best friend’s wife.\n\nThere’s a lot of things that happen in it that aren’t PC, that aren’t perfect, that aren’t something you should want ideally. But they are real human emotions, and human beings aren’t always perfect. And there’s something about Natalie’s vulnerability, and I think Richard wanted a character who didn’t realise what she had.\n\nShe didn’t realise that actually it was her boyfriend who was the idiot and there was nothing wrong with her at all, she was lovely as she was. The fact she was so open to the most powerful man in the country about her little vulnerability about herself was a very human thing. I think that’s part of what makes it human, and the fact it’s very real.\n\nBecause, sadly, women are hard on themselves, and we’re hard on each other, still. The main comments are from Natalie herself and from another woman in that film. Definitely times have changed, things have got better, but I think some of those things about being imperfect are also what makes you go “Aw, I can’t believe she feels like that, I felt like that.”‘\n\nWould you like to see Love Actually come back with a sequel?\n\nThat would be a question or Richard as he came up with the whole thing and he was thinking about all different types of love – it’s forbidden, you had it, you yearn for it, you lost it, the sacrifices we make, the compromises we make, at a time when just out of the 90s where it used to be really uncool.\n\nHe’s a genuinely bright, obscenely bright man who genuinely wants to make his mark on the world to make it a better place. His main passion is his charity work, and I think if there was something he could do movie-wise that could help that then he would.\n\nBut there’s also something about Love Actually that’s like… I don’t know if we should touch it! I don’t know if it should be touched.\n\nIt was lovely to do the reunion for Comic Relief – you saw the Prime Minister and Natalie were still together and that he was still doing his silly dance – that was really cute and that was all for a really good cause so it ticked the boxes for everyone.\n\nAnother firecracker character you played is Tiffany on EastEnders… do you ever wish you could go back and revisit the character?\n\nNo! Because I feel like I had such an amazing time and phase of the show. It was at that time where I think its peak viewing figure was like 22 million viewers – we had like five channels.\n\nIt’s still to this day the hardest thing I’ve ever done. Shows, West End, concerts, toured the world – you name it, I’ve done it. And EastEnders was the hardest thing I’ve ever done. People don’t give the actors the credit, you do like 22 scenes in one day, you always end up doing six days a week, they change things and give you rewrites all the time so you’re constantly on your toes.\n\nBut I have to say it was such an exciting time to be there because it was the norm that say, Bono would walk in the door at Elstree where you would be after you finish filming EastEnders and they were filming Top of the Pops.\n\nAnd so would Diana Ross and Cher and Liam Gallagher – and a lot of them knew you! That was when you’d realise. Like when Liam Gallagher was like “oh my God, we love your show, we love it,” you’d just think like “oh my God, Britpop royalty knows who I am.”\n\nIt was such an exciting, lovely time to be so young and enjoying that mixture of TV in its prime. It was the closest thing really to reality TV then because people felt like they were growing up with you. There wasn’t a million other things to watch. There were so many people united watching your journey.\n\nIt was really funny, I could really feel the shift – there was a certain fame I had when I was playing Tiffany, then when I did the pop music it felt different. People were more unsure if they could go over to you [if they recognised you in the street] – but with Tiffany they were really familiar. And again it was different when I did the movies. It changes. Fame’s a really transient, flippant thing.\n\nIs there anything you wish you could tell your younger self that you know now?\n\nI would say you can’t be all things to all people, even though you’re an actress! And that’s okay.\n\nWhen you’re younger, you walk into a room and worry if everyone will like you, but you’ll get to a point in your life where you walk into a room and decide who you like.\n\nThere’s something really powerful and lovely about that as a woman – you’re not as worried about what people will think anymore. And it’s okay if nobody likes you – you decide who you will like.\n\nWhat drew you to the Vodafone campaign where you lent your voice to allow cancer survivor Tanja to sing for her sister after losing her voice box?\n\nThey said Tanja and her sister Mia were huge Love Actually fans and Tanja said she loved my voice and would love to sing with me, and when I saw video footage of her and her journey, I just had to get involved.\n\nI couldn’t believe how clever the technology was until I got into the room and we had a practice in the recording studio. She’s a northerner and I’m a southerner when we heard back our voices blended together in our different ways for the first time we were like “Oh my God,what is that?” It didn’t sound like me completely and it’s not what Tanja sounded like but she said “it’s the closest I’ve come to singing.’ It was so emotive, she used to be a performer, she used to be a singer. She grieved being able to express herself and the part of her that’s in her DNA, the performer in her.’\n\nAs a musician yourself, did Tanja’s story hit you harder at the idea of not being able to use your voice?\n\nI know that release you get – even my friends who can’t sing, who sing their hearts out, that feeling.\n\nNot being able to do that when you used to do it professionally and it’s part of who you’ve been for your whole life. It’s like, “who am I now?” It’s one of the most emotional campaigns I’ve been involved with. I had to be really careful not to lose it emotionally as she was using my vocals, to keep it together to be one voice.\n\nThe minute her sister started to well up I was just like “you have to pull yourself together here!” I had to look at it and then I had to look away. It was so brave. Their journey was so turbulent and so scary and the love between them is so real.\n\nI love a warrior and I love someone who doesn’t just survive, they thrive. I’m a little fighter as well and I really identified with Tanja’s spirit and I’m in absolute awe of her.\n\nTechnology, as we know, it can be a great thing and a not-so-great thing, but seeing what it did for Tanja you see the huge possibilities of where we can go from here.\n\nMartine McCutcheon helps to deliver a first-of-its-kind magical Christmas carol thanks to Vodafone 5G in the Christmas Carol #TogetherWeCan\n\nMORE : Martine McCutcheon addresses EastEnders exit as Tiffany Mitchell and if she’d return"
