Yes, I said Love Actually—that 2003 blockbuster Christmas movie starring nearly every internationally known British actor at the time, including Hugh Grant, Emma Thompson, Keira Knightly, Alan Rickman, Colin Firth, Rowan Atkinson, and Liam Neeson (who is technically from Northern Ireland). I don't know about you, but when it starts to get cold out and when the Christmas spirit seizes me, all I want to do is put Love Actually on repeat. And one of my favorite things in the movie? Martine McCutcheon's wardrobe. She plays Natalie, the prime minister's hapless-ish assistant whose boyfriend dumped her because he said her thighs were too big. I love Natalie. And I love her wardrobe—because everything she wore was so figure-flattering and so, just, pretty. Here are three looks I'm still obsessing over today: 1. The frilly black top she wears when she first meets the prime minister. I love the gently rounded V-neckline, the frilly polka-dot trim at the collar and cuffs, and how it's feminine and sweet",

Yes, I said Love Actually—that 2003 blockbuster Christmas movie starring nearly every internationally known British actor at the time, including Hugh Grant, Emma Thompson, Keira Knightly, Alan Rickman, Colin Firth, Rowan Atkinson, and Liam Neeson (who is technically from Northern Ireland).\n\nI don't know about you, but when it starts to get cold out and when the Christmas spirit seizes me, all I want to do is put Love Actually on repeat. And one of my favorite things in the movie? Martine McCutcheon's wardrobe. She plays Natalie, the prime minister's hapless-ish assistant whose boyfriend dumped her because he said her thighs were too big. I love Natalie. And I love her wardrobe—because everything she wore was so figure-flattering and so, just,\n\npretty\n\n.\n\nHere are three looks I'm still obsessing over today:\n\n1. The frilly black top she wears when she first meets the prime minister. I love the gently rounded V-neckline, the frilly polka-dot trim at the collar and cuffs, and how it's feminine and sweet without looking too cartoon-y or precious.\n\nHere's a closer look at her top:\n\nIn a whole decade, I've never been able to figure out where this top came from, but I suspect the look wouldn't be too hard to replicate by layering your favorite silk polka-dot blouse underneath a deep-V-neck black cashmere sweater.\n\n2. Natalie's embroidered cream cardigan.\n\nI've quite literally been obsessing, periodically and perennially, over this particular cream-and-black cardigan for a decade. In the film, she wears the embellished sweater with a simple dark pencil skirt—and the look is just perfect, so flattering yet really conservative and flirtatious all at the same time.\n\nYears and years ago, I think I found a vaguely similar cardi at Jaeger, but I couldn't afford it, so I never picked it up. This season, my search has continued to be pretty futile, but I think the trick to achieving the same mood as Natalie's look is having a super-fitted cardigan with some sort of surprising feminine detail—like this one from ASOS, which has adorable 3/4 sleeves and a skinny belt.\n\n3. And then there's the red-on-red Christmas play outfit.\n\nIn the scene where Natalie FINALLY gets to make out with the Hugh Grant prime minister, she's wearing a gorgeous, tailored lipstick-red coat over a bright red off-the-shoulder snowflake-print sweater.\n\nShe pairs these bright items with jeans—and it's all topped off with a belt that has a huge gold floral-leaf-type buckle. Boom.\n\nWant the same festive-but-casual kiss-the-prime-minister look that Natalie had in this scene? BCBG has a gorgeous off-the-shoulder red knit on sale right now for $53, and there are plenty of bright red coats to choose from this season (I like this one from Topshop at Nordstrom for $100.\n\nAre you as obsessed with Love Actually as I am? Tell me what your favorite parts are—and if there are any outfits or looks from the movie that you can't stop thinking about too!"
