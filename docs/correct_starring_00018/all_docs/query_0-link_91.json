        "text": "Get ready to feel really old as Love Actually turns EIGHTEEN this year, having been released many moons ago now back in 2003.\n\nRichard Curtis, the man who previously gave us Four Weddings and A Funeral and Bridget Jones, assembled a star-studded cast to give us a movie which very swiftly established itself as a Christmas classic.\n\nAnd for many people, it still wouldn't be Christmas without at least one watch of Love Actually before Santa comes, usually when tying to wrap presents or clutching a glass of Baileys.\n\nREAD MORE: Iconic Christmas TV moments from EastEnders to Vicar of Dibley\n\nLove Actually had everything from a Prime Minister the country loved (let's not go there right now!) to a youngster with a huge crush on 'the hottest girl' in school while trying to get over his mum's death and an ageing rocker intent on landing the Christmas number 1 - enter a young looking Ant and Dec to conduct a very awkward TV interview!\n\nAs we all get set to give it another watch, we look at what has happened to the cast, minus a few of the biggest stars ,in an article that is tinged with sadness.\n\nAlan Rickman\n\nAlready an acting great well before Love Actually, thanks to roles in Die Hard (yes it IS a Christmas film!) and Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves, Alan became the man we all loved to hate as his character Harry dared to have his head turned by secretary Mia in the run up to Christmas.\n\nNone of us will ever forget the moment, Harry's wife Karen opened a Christmas present fully expecting it to be a beautiful necklace, only for it to be a Joni Mitchell CD, with the camera the cutting to Mia wearing said necklace.\n\nOne of this country's finest actors, Alan sadly passed away in 2016 at the age of 69 after a battle with pancreatic cancer.\n\nWhile we'll always hate Harry, Alan is a legend that will never be forgotten.\n\nOlivia Olson\n\nGet ready for this - the young actress who played little Sam's love interest Joanna is now a 29-year-old!\n\nOlivia stunned British TV viewers when she appeared on screens 16 years after Love Actually as a contestant on X Factor Celebrity in 2019.\n\nReacting to her being on the show, another reacted \"Now I feel really really old. Yes that is the girl from Love Actually\" and another commenting \" if Love Actually girl doesn't sing All I Want For Christmas in a few weeks, I'll cry.\"\n\nSadly for Olivia, her stint on The X Factor didn't last long as she was voted off instead of Martin Bashir, despite him forgetting his words.\n\nShe struggled to hide her shock and upset at the result, with the outcome seeing Simon Cowell face the wrath of many ITV viewers.\n\nThomas Sangster\n\nWithout a doubt THE most lovable character from the film, Sam gave Thomas his breakout role in 2003.\n\nHis relationship with on-screen dad Liam Neeson gave us some moving and hilarious scenes and then came Sam's famous airport dash to get to Joanna before she go on her flight to America.\n\nWhile other child stars try and shed their past projects, Thomas, now THIRTY ONE years old, has admitted he loves being known as 'the little boy from Love Actually.'\n\nSince its release, Thomas has continued to work in the industry appearing in Nanny McPhee, Death of Superhero and Nowhere Boy, in which he played Beatles icon Paul McCartney.\n\nIn 2020 he was nominated for an Emmy Award for his role in hit Netflix series The Queen's Gambit.\n\nMartine McCutcheon\n\nMartine landed the role of Downing Street staff member Natalie, five years on from making a tragic exit from EastEnders, after her character Tiffany was ran over by Frank Butcher on New Year's Eve 1998 as she chased after Grant Mitchell.\n\nAfter leaving the soap, Martine scored a huge number 1 with Perfect Moment, with hits like I've Got You and I'm Over You following in its footsteps.\n\nShe made a music comeback in 2017 with album Lost and Found, before releasing a Christmas EP last year.\n\nAnd, at the star of 2021, Martine was unmasked as the Swan on hit ITV show The Masked Singer, with many viewers gutted she left the competition so early.\n\nEmma Thompson\n\nLike her on-screen husband Alan Rickman, Emma was already a well established star before Richard Curtis came calling for Love Actually, thanks to roles in hit films like Sense & Sensibility.\n\nTwo years on from her emotionally charged star turn as Karen, Emma joined forces with Thomas Sangster to take the lead in Nanny McPhee.\n\nAnd she was clearly bitten by the Christmas movie bug after Love Actually as Emma also had a part in 2019's Last Christmas.\n\nAfter supporting husband
