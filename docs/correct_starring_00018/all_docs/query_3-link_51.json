        "text": "Virgin Radio\n\n1 Dec 2022, 15:05\n\nCredit: Getty / Rex\n\nMartine McCutcheon says joining her Love Actually co-stars for the 20 year reunion special was a real “honour”.\n\nThe actress played lovable Natalie in the 2003 Richard Curtis classic, falling for handsome Prime Minister David, played by Hugh Grant.\n\nOn Tuesday (29th November) the likes of Emma Thompson, Thomas Brodie-Sangster and Bill Nighy sat down with host Diane Sawyer for The Laughter & Secrets of Love Actually: 20 Years Later in the US, to celebrate the movie two decades on from its release, with Martine being interviewed from her home.\n\nTaking part in the reunion, even while still in the UK, was a treat for Martine, who exclusively told virginradio.co.uk how it felt to be a part of the highly-anticipated telly special.\n\n“I was really honoured to be asked,” Martine explained. “I'm a massive fan of Diane Sawyer. I could not believe that I was doing an interview from home, like a Zoom interview. I can't believe it's been 20 years, I can't believe that it's flown by for me, it feels like it was done about eight to 10 years ago, and it's double that time.”\n\nLove Actually still holds a special place in the former EastEnders star’s heart, with it being her very first major film role, and she believes there’s a good reason it’s a constant favourite during the Christmas season.\n\nShe continued: “I just feel so proud of the joy and the love that it's brought to people year after year after year, and obviously what our world has gone through since we made the movie…since then, the ups and downs in the world and the pandemic and lockdown. I think people keep coming back to it because it's a very real take on love, but it's also hopeful.\n\n“I think people want that mixture of something that's relatable, that's real, that's funny, that's not perfect. But ultimately, it gives you comfort and hope. I think that no one does that better than Richard Curtis, so I think that's why it's carried on. It's thanks to him.”\n\nNow the festive season is in full swing, Martine has joined forces with One4all for their Christmas campaign, aimed at making life easier during the holidays and avoiding the family drama that can sometimes bring the fun to a halt.\n\nResearch by One4all found the most common disagreement comes from who is cooking Christmas dinner, with things like buying the wrong presents and what to watch on the telly also making the list of annoyances.\n\nOn the new study and collaboration, Martine explained: “What we're trying to do is limit the disappointment, and the arguments about presents and how much you're going to spend and all that kind of thing. [My sister and I have] decided that we're going to get each other one this year, and go for a glass of pink champagne, go shopping together. She can buy what she wants to buy, I can buy what I want to buy, and we still make an experience out of it with an element of surprise to it.”\n\n“Ultimately, it's all about how you make people feel, and making them feel special. It's a couple of days of a whole year and letting stuff go. When things are helpful like this and this campaign, I was like 'that is a no brainer.'”"
