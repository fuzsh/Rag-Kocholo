        "text": "It's been part of the Christmas line-up of go-to movies for the best part of two decades, but it looks like love actually still is everywhere for Love Actually.\n\nThe romantic festive film from writer-director Richard Curtis features multiple plot threads intersecting and features an all-star cast.\n\nWhether it is Hugh Grant as the Prime Minister romancing his potty-mouthed assistant played by Martine McCutcheon, Alan Rickman as a cheating husband and Emma Thompson as his devastated wife crying to Joni Mitchell, or Bill Nighy as a washed-up rock star, we all have our favourite stories and characters.\n\nHowever, there are some bits of information you may not know about the beloved film.\n\nThankfully, in recent years we had creator Richard Curtis' wife, Emma Freud, give us some surprising facts you might not have known about the romantic Christmas movie classic.\n\nHere's a set of unexpected pieces of trivia about one of the nation's favourites Christmas films, Love Actually.\n\nLove Actually film facts and secrets\n\n1. Casting was a family (and friends) affair.\n\nThe absolute best one though, is mini Curtis as a lobster. Yes the lobster.\n\nHer son was there too. LOOK.\n\nLOOK CLOSER.\n\n2. The cast and crew were given the chance to buy and wear the clothes, because who doesn't want a turtle neck?\n\n3. A lot of filming happened at night to avoid crowds. This would be a great idea when approaching Christmas shopping...if the shops were actually open.\n\n4. In case you wondered, yes, Rowan Atkinson's character was on our side.\n\n5. No, no-one got naked.\n\n6. January Jones wrote most of her own lines (and was rumoured to date Colin Firth later on...the key word here is rumoured)\n\n7. It took Emma seven takes to do that horribly heartbreaking scene.\n\n“That scene where my character is standing by the bed crying is so well known because it’s something everyone’s been through,” she revealed previously.\n\nShe also drew on her own experience, after now ex-husband Kenneth Branagh's alleged affair with Helena Bonham Carter.\n\n“I had my heart very badly broken by Ken,” she said. “So I knew what it was like to find the necklace that wasn’t meant for me. Well it wasn’t exactly that, but we’ve all been through it.”\n\n10. Emma's favourite line...\n\n9. Some little digs at the family made it in. Harsh.\n\n10. Second favourite?\n\n11. Harry's affair - we now know the TRUTH (No YOU are crying)\n\nAt a screening for the film, when asked if the affair had actually happened Emma said: “Definitely had an affair. I begged Richard just to make it a flirtation, but no. The whole way.”\n\n11. Emma is behind Colin's romantic moves.\n\n100% her idea.\n\nBUT it isn't all down to Emma...here's a couple more facts about Love Actually.\n\n13. Love Actually was never supposed to be a Christmas movie.\n\n14. One of the other axed love stories involved an African couple supporting each other through famine.\n\n15. Richard Curtis always planned on Hugh Grant and Emma Thompson playing the PM and his sister.\n\n16. There was a lesbian storyline cut from the film.\n\nActually the original movie had 14 live stories planned. Two of them were cut before filming and the other two ended up on the cutting room floor.\n\nThe scenes were added to the DVD's bonus material. Curtis has also said he regrets scrapping the scene at the last minute as it removed one of his main points - that everyone has their own complicated love story to tell.\n\n17. Claudia Schiffer was never supposed to be in the movie. Curtis wanted someone who looked like her, but struggled to find someone... so she got offered the role.\n\n18. Brodie-Sangster was taught to play the drums by his dad just for the movie.\n\n19. Martine McCutcheon’s role was written for her, after Curtis saw her in EastEnders. Yes, he adored Tiffany Mitchell.\n\nHe actually wrote it specifically for her, even calling her Martine - before changing the character's name to Natalie in the audition so she wouldn't clock he'd already given her the job.\n\n20. Hugh Grant and Brodie-Sangster are actually second cousins.\n\n21. Andrew Lincoln's famous giant cards scene was inspired by Bob Dylan's video for Subterranean Homesick Blues.\n\n22. Curtis wrote five versions of the cards scene and then read them to women in his office just to check they weren't too mushy.\n\n23. Hugh Grant was NOT a fan of his dance sequence\n\nHe apparently \"kept putting it off\". Grant has since said: “I kept saying to Richard: ‘OK, look. I’ve got the radio on in my room, my bedroom. And I’m dancing, fine. But then I start to dance through the whole of 10 Downing Street. Where’s the music coming from? And how does it cut off at the end?”\n\nThough Grant wasn't actually dancing around No 10. The Crew did try and get permission, but they were told no.\n\n24. A famous scene was stolen from Four Weddings and a Funeral\n\nYep When Colin insults the caterer's food while trying to flirt was written for Grant's character in Four Weddings and a Funeral.\n\nIt was cut in the final stages of editing so Curtis just recycled it.\n\n25. Emma Thompson is wearing a fat suit!\n\n26. Her crying in THAT Joni Mitchell scene was unscripted. Emma came up with the bawling her eyes out.\n\n27. Liam Neeson's character, Daniel, has a love story with Carol...who he later calls Karen. That's Emma's character's name just in case you were wondering... (dies happy)\n\n28. Liam Neeson's toothpick? He had just quit smoking and needed something to replace the cigarettes.\n\n29. The film was originally two separate movies.\n\nOne story was for Hugh Grant, one for Colin Firth. “I’d worked out whole films on those subjects, and then I thought, ‘Oh, I don’t want to do these because they are just turning out to be a shape I know,’” Curtis told Vulture.\n\n30. Andrew Lincoln wrote his 'To Me, You Are Perfect' signs himself because he thought his \"handwriting was really good\".\n\n31. Joanna's amazing All I Want For Christmas Is You was too good! Curtis made her re-do it to make it sound more like a child singing.\n\n32. Actually is actually said 23 times in the film. 22 by the characters in the film, once in the monologue from Hugh Grant.\n\n33. Those Barbies that Emma Thompson holds up? Ken dolls in drag. Yep really.\n\n34. Andrew Lincoln's character is the closest character to himself that Richard has ever written - according to his wife.\n\n35. In the UK version we hear the Sugababes Too Lost in You, the US got Kelly Clarkson's The Trouble With Love Is.\n\n36. The wedding scene where the band play All You Need is Love was inspired by The Muppets legend Jim Henson's funeral. Cheerful.\n\n37. The PM character said to be based on Edward Heath who was well known as a bachelor during his time in office.\n\nFor even more behind the scenes secrets, see Comic Relief's The Ultimate Love Actually Christmas Quiz here."
