        "text": "Since bursting into theaters in 2003, \"Love Actually\" has become a Christmas movie staple. The festive season is not complete without seeing those opening hugs at Heathrow airport, hearing Hugh Grant utter the line, \"Love actually is all around,\" and, of course, getting cozy with the stellar \"Love Actually\" cast and their intertwining storylines.\n\nThe Richard Curtis movie, which celebrates its 20th anniversary this year, brought with it a collection of A-list stars that needed no introduction. Theater, film, and TV icons like Emma Thompson, Colin Firth, and Grant were cast in lead roles, while the film also helped to catapult the careers of Thomas Brodie-Sangster and Olivia Olson, whose sweet childhood romance pulled on the hearts of many.\n\nWhile the movie has arguably aged badly and is not without its troubles (Natalie getting dumped for being \"fat,\" Mark's creepy wedding video, and many of the women characters being passive), it continues to be viewed with fondness for many Christmas lovers. So in the two decades since it first premiered, where's the cast of \"Love Actually\" now?\n\nKeep scrolling to find out how the last two decades have been for the beloved Christmas characters.\n\n03\n\nAlan Rickman\n\nPlaying Thompson's husband, Harry, in \"Love Actually\" Rickman was arguably considered the villain of the movie after his head was turned by his secretary, Mia.\n\nThe actor continued to play the role of Severus Snape in all of the Harry Potter movies, as well as directing and starring in the 2014 film \"A Little Chaos.\" Rickman passed away in January 2016 from pancreatic cancer.\n\n04\n\nHeike Makatsch\n\nGerman actor Makatsch played meddling Mia, Harry's secretary, in \"Love Actually,\" who used her sexuality to turn her boss's head away from his wife.\n\nShe played the role of Lisa Addison in \"Resident Evil\" prior to the Christmas rom-com and was in a relationship with Daniel Craig for seven years. Now, the 52-year-old is a mom of three and resides in Berlin.\n\n05\n\nRowan Atkinson\n\nWhile not a lead character in the Christmas film, Atkinson certainly made an impression as the perfectionist Selfridges shop assistant, helping Harry buy a necklace for his mistress.\n\nAlready a household name thanks to TV series \"Mr. Bean\" and \"Blackadder,\" Atkinson's comedic style continued following \"Love Actually\" with TV and films including the Johnny English film series. He is also set to star in the 2023 prequel, \"Wonka,\" alongside Grant. The 68-year-old began an affair with comedian Louise Ford in 2018, who was 26 years his junior. He separated from his wife and Ford ended her relationship with comedian James Acaster so they could be together. They went on to have a child together, Atkinson's third.\n\n06\n\nHugh Grant\n\nWhen it comes to memorable \"Love Actually\" scenes, Grant playing the Prime Minister and dancing to Girls Aloud has to be up there, before his character falls in love with Natalie.\n\nFrom playing Firth's love-rival in the Bridget Jones franchise to Phoenix Buchanan in \"Paddington 2,\" Grant's movie roles have cemented him as a British icon. The dad of four is set to star as an Oompa Loompa in the upcoming remake of \"Wonka,\" premiering in December, and we can't wait.\n\n07\n\nMartine McCutcheon\n\nFormer \"Eastenders\" star McCutcheon took her career to new heights when she played a new member of staff at No.10 Downing Street. Playing Natalie, who was dumped for being \"fat\" – jokes Curtis has since admitted he regrets including in the film – she falls for the Prime Minister.\n\nSince the film, McCutcheon starred in TV shows \"Spooks\" and \"Echo Beach.\" She got married and became a mom in 2015.
