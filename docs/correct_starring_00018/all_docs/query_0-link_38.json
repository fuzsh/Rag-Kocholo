        "text": "Martine McCutcheon spilled the beans on what it was like to kiss ‘posh boy’ Hugh Grant.\n\nMartine starred opposite Hugh in Richard Curtis’ 2003 rom-com Love Actually.\n\nShe played Natalie, a junior member of household staff who falls for Grant’s newly-elected Prime-Minister David.\n\nAfter skirting around each other, the pair share a kiss backstage at a Christmas play just before the curtain rises on them, revealing their romantic moment to everyone watching.\n\nIt’s one of the film’s most iconic moments, and Martine confessed she had a lot of fun filming it.\n\nAppearing as a guest panelist on Loose Women, she was asked what it was like to lock lips with Hugh.\n\nShe said: ‘I won’t be mysterious he was fabulous. I’m not gonna lie.\n\n‘At first he was very polite and I thought “Posh boys aren’t very good kissers. Maybe they’re not very good kissers these posh boys,” but then when Richard Curtis said to him “Go for it” – ooh, did he!’\n\nHer co-panelist, actress Sherrie Hewson, quipped: ‘This is fantastic for me because it’s been a long time!’\n\nMartine continued: ‘And I kept getting [the kiss] wrong of course so we had to do it again. And then another take, and then another take…’\n\nHost Andrea McLean added: ‘I like Hugh because he looks like he’s a little bit filthy.’\n\nMartine agreed saying: ‘He is filthy but he is fabulous. Fabulously filthy.’\n\nMORE : Martin Freeman has something to say to anyone turned on by the porn scene in Love Actually\n\nMORE : This is what happened to Love Actually’s Harry and Karen after his affair comes out"
