        "text": "Love Actually is one of those beloved film that we just can't resist watching Christmas after Christmas.\n\nThe classic movie features a whole host of stars including Emma Thompson, Hugh Grant, Keira Knightley and Colin Firth.\n\nAnd of course, London's very own Martine McCutheon.\n\nREAD MORE: ITV Lorraine Kelly shares photo of her rarely seen cameraman husband as she picks up huge award\n\nShe played the role of Natalie in the 2003 film.\n\nBut, Love Actually is just one part of the 45-year-old's extensive career, from child acting to soap operas to music.\n\nMartine started her career at a young age, featuring in various TV adverts.\n\nThe Hackney-born actress made her acting debut in a children's TV drama, Bluebirds, in 1989 alongside the legendary Barbara Windsor\n\nShe also took to the stage in Stop the World – I Want to Get Off. Playing the role of Susan, she was the sister of Denise Van Outen's character.\n\nMartine's lovable performance as tea-lady Natalie in Love Actually is her only major movie role.\n\nHer role saw her as the love-interest of the British Prime Minister, played by the unstoppable Hugh Grant.\n\nFor this, she won the Empire Award for Best Newcomer and an MTV Movie Award for Best Trans-Atlantic Breakthrough Performer in 2004.\n\nOf course, she is arguably best known outside of the hit Christmas film for her iconic role in EastEnders.\n\nPlaying Tiffany Mitchell between 1995 and 1998, she became a household name. In 1997, she won a National Television Award for Most Popular Actress.\n\nAround 22 million viewers tuned in for her final episode, where she was killed after being hit by Frank Butcher's car on New Year's Eve.\n\nThe actress was written out of the soap in order to allow her to pursue her music career.\n\nHaving earlier been in a pop group named Milan, she debuted as a solo artist in 1999 and had a number one with 'Perfect Moment'. The star has had four albums, with Lost and Found released in 2017.\n\nEarlier this year, Martine shared an Instagram post describing 'migraines from hell' during a flare-up of her ongoing health conditions.\n\nIn 2011, the actress was diagnosed with ME, also known as chronic fatigue syndrome. Then, in 2017, she was also diagnosed with Lyme disease.\n\nHer flare-ups can cause her pains that she describes as being 'hit on the head by a mallet!'\n\nMartine regularly shares her health with her fans, also talking about bouts of depression and anxiety.\n\nThe star has also had other struggles in the past including being declared bankrupt in 2013 after filing for insolvency at a London court, The Mirror reports.\n\nFollowing her health struggles the star was unable to work and was declared bankrupt before having her £25,000 engagement ring from husband Jack McManus seized by bailiffs.\n\n“I just thought my health, money, career have all been taken from me, and now even my engagement ring - the one thing that represents what is solid in my life - has gone,\" she said in 2016.\n\nWith her impressive career and supportive following online, she will also be known for her lovable part in the classic Christmas film.\n\nLove Actually is on ITV2 tonight (Friday 10 December) at 9pm.\n\nDo you have a story you think we should be covering?
