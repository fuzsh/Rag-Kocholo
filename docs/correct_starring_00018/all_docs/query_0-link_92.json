        "text": "Synopsis\n\nThe director of \"Love Actually\" says he still feels a little cringey about his film's lack of diversity, but many people still like it and keep telling the creator in their messages.\n\n‘Love Actually’, starring Emma Thompson, Hugh Grant, Liam Neeson, Bill Nighy, Martine McCutcheon, Rowan Atkinson, and others, was a smashing box office hit when released in November 2003. A film with a budget of $45 million made $246 million worldwide. The film was a Christmas release in those days; sure enough, it found more acceptance with the audience than the critics.\n\nABC recently had an interview on its channel for the film with Richard Curtis, director of \"Love Actually,\" in the spotlight. The programme was titled \"The Laughter and Secrets of Love Actually: 20 Hours Later. \"\n\nOn launch day, some stars made it for the program and had Hugh Grant, Dame Emma Thompson, Bill Nighy, Laura Linney and Thomas Brodie Sangster. Curtis was asked if there were some parts of the film he felt he would change, to which he replied he would certainly change a few, but society changes too. The lack of diversity makes him want to bring more people on board, and he wishes he had made a better film. He wishes he had made a documentary to assure himself he has seen it all. A well-done movie, Curtis felt, could always help recall how things can be better and also, there would be moments that would later be recalled as the best moments ever.\n\n‘Love Actually’ is about a few romantic stories interwoven into a single tale of love creating a love feast that the audience still consumes. There are plenty of critics of the film who still find it unacceptable. Critics at that time had panned the film and said there was nothing much to it other than mushy romance. One even suggested that the film be called \"Lust Actually.\"\n\nCurtis is a man with a golden heart, according to Dame Emma Thompson. Hugh Grant says the script in Love Actually is an extension of Richard Curtis on steroids. Bill Nighy had won a Bafta, for his role as a supporting actor in the film, says that he has people telling him that they got through some of their worst moments watching and remembering this film.\n\nHugh Grant, who was made to dance in the film, said it was a crazy thing to have done. An Englishman in his right mind would not have danced at 8 AM in a sober mood. But he did do it, and some people loved it.\n\nFAQs:\n\nWhat Award did Martine McCutcheon receive for the film ‘Love Actually’?\n\nBest Newcomer Award -Empire\n\nWho won the Best Actress award from Business Standard for ‘Love Actually’?\n\nEmma Thomson\n\n(You can now subscribe to our Economic Times WhatsApp channel)\n\nDisclaimer Statement: This content is authored by an external agency.
