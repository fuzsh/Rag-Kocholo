        "text": "Love Actually has earned its place as one of the most iconic romantic comedy movies in existence, and chances are that you can probably remember most of its biggest scenes.\n\nThe movie's sweet final scene features many of the lead characters coming together at Heathrow Airport for some reunions, with one moment in the scene seeing Natalie (Martine McCutcheon) running to greet her boyfriend – and Prime Minister – David (Hugh Grant), before jumping into his arms.\n\nThe romantic moment might have been a treat for fans but it turns out that actress McCutcheon was very nervous about filming that scene, as she has joked that she thought she was going to \"kill\" her co-star.\n\nRelated: Love Actually's 'lost' storyline could have solved a major criticism\n\nAppearing on The One Show on Friday (April 23), the actress told hosts Alex Jones and Clara Amfo that the scene in question was actually filmed on the very first day of filming.\n\n\"It was like Dirty Dancing – you know when she runs and then she stops, and then she runs and then she stops? And the whole crew were there, and I had to do that, and I'm like, 'I'm going to kill him! I'm going to knock him over and I'm going to kill him!'\" she said.\n\n\"The last scene was the first scene we filmed so everybody was watching and I kept getting so embarrassed,\" she added, revealing that Grant had reassured her before filming that it would all go well. \"And in the end we managed it – but what a thing, you've got to jump up on Hugh Grant and straddle him, first day!\"\n\nShe also spoke about her admiration for Grant, saying: \"I fell in love with him when I saw him in Four Weddings and a Funeral, and my dream was to work with him and Richard Curtis... so once I had done this, I thought, I am done, there is nothing left to do.\"\n\nRelated: Love Actually's Hugh Grant almost played Black Mirror Prime Minister\n\nAs for Grant, despite the fact that his famous dance to The Pointer Sisters' 'Jump' in the movie has gone down in movie history, he actually doesn't remember the 2003 film all that well.\n\nAsked recently about whether he would take part in a sequel to Love Actually, he said: \"I've never thought about that... I can't even remember what happens in the film. It's so long since I've seen it. You'd have to remind me.\"\n\nIt sounds like somebody is in need of a rewatch next festive season...\n\nDigital Spy's digital magazine is back!
