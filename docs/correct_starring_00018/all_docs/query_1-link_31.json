        "text": "Love Actually star Martine McCutcheon has spoken out in defence of the most infamous scene from the Christmas romcom — Andrew Lincoln and his placards.\n\nThe scene features Lincoln’s character, Mark, silently expressing his love for Juliet (Keira Knightley), despite the fact she has just married his best friend Peter (Chiwetel Ejiofor).\n\nJuliet reward Mark with a kiss, though the scene raises many questions about how this friendship will continue now that Mark has just dropped a massive bombshell right into the middle of it.\n\nRead more: McCutcheon worried about knocking out Hugh Grant\n\nIn the years since Love Actually first hit screens, the scene has been repeatedly criticised for its apparent condoning of stalker-like behaviour — but one of the film’s stars doesn’t think that’s fair.\n\n\"I don't think it's creepy at all,\" McCutcheon told Digital Spy. \"I think people do crazy things when they are in love with people.”\n\nWatch: Martine McCutcheon recreates Love Actually scene for Christmas ad\n\nThe 44-year-old star said she feels Lincoln’s character had to say something, as Juliet had already seen the wedding video he had made in which the camera barely left her face.\n\nShe added: \"He had his moment where he thought 'enough now, I've told her how I feel, I love my friend too but I had to get it off my chest in the right way'.\n\n\"She'd already seen the video, and I think it was his way of making things explained and comfortable.\"\n\nRead more: Love Actually child star says film has aged badly\n\nMcCutcheon has recreated the placard scene in an advert for NOW TV to promote their new Greetings Gram service.\n\nThe scheme will allow customers to send messengers to the door of their loved ones to deliver personalised messages, given many will not be able to visit family and friends this Christmas.\n\nLove Actually, meanwhile, remains one of the most popular Christmas movies of the 21st century and has previously topped lists of Britain’s favourite festive films.\n\nThe movie was also a huge financial success and earned $245m (£182m) at the global box office.\n\n\"It's a really human take on love and shows all it's different complexities,\" McCutcheon said.\n\n\"It shows that it isn't always perfect and people have their struggles and insecurities. It shows a vulnerability that we are united in our vulnerability.\"\n\nRead more: Hugh Grant discusses “excruciating” Love Actually scene\n\nOriginal director and writer Richard Curtis made a short follow-up in 2017, entitled Red Nose Day Actually, which revisited many of the central characters 14 years later.\n\nBut none of that continued success is going to stop people speculating about how creepy Andrew Lincoln is. Sorry Martine."
