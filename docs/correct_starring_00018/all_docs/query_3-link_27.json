        "text": "The only one I like is the hot guy who Laura Linney should have stayed with\n\nWorst - canâ€™t stand the boy or Martine M\n\nNot sure how I watched it twice looking back, itâ€™s pretty bad\n\nThat film I how I discovered the song 'Songbird' which is beautiful in the scene where Karl (the hot one) goes back to the flat of the Laura Linney character.\n\nK.Knightley looks stunning in this.\n\nI like the film silly as it is.\n\nI had Colin Firth up there as well but thought I couldn't pick too many, I like the porno ones because of the awkwardness\n\nBest - Emma Thompson, Liam Neeson, Rowan Atkinson (heâ€™s only in it for one scene but itâ€™s so funny!), Martine Mccutcheon (canâ€™t spell it)\n\nWorst- Colin Firth + Aurelia, the one who goes to America\n\nKiera Knightleyâ€™s husband doesnâ€™t play much of a role but he is very handsome! I do find it weird now I know Kiera Knightley was only 18 when it was filmed- sheâ€™s closer in age to the little boy than most of the adult cast\n\nI find the porn-actor pair very tedious; the twee juxtaposition of the relentless faux-sex with their tiresome shy/demure/awkward interactions make my eyes want to roll right out of my head in annoyance.\n\nriotlady Â· 24/12/2022 18:55\n\nBest - Emma Thompson, Liam Neeson, Rowan Atkinson (heâ€™s only in it for one scene but itâ€™s so funny!), Martine Mccutcheon (canâ€™t spell it)\n\nWorst- Colin Firth + Aurelia, the one who goes to America\n\nKiera Knightleyâ€™s husband doesnâ€™t play much of a role but he is very handsome! I do find it weird now I know Kiera Knightley was only 18 when it was filmed- sheâ€™s closer in age to the little boy than most of the adult cast\n\nRowan is in two scenes!\n\nHe's also at Heathrow Airport - he holds up the guy checking passports/boarding passes so Sam can get through to Joanna.\n\nThe woman who the necklace is bought for... the secretary (forgotten name!) Only because when she wears the turtleneck jumper it makes her neck look so long she looks like a cluedo (boardgame) figure!\n\nThe boy. He's meant to be 10 or 11 and we are supposed to believe he is in love. And the girl he likes looks about 14 and really would not go for him ðŸ˜‚if it was real!\n\nBest - his dad.\n\nI love Laura Linney's character, I like to think that she and Karl would get together eventually.\n\nCan't stand Kris Marshall and the American girls.\n\n@riotlady Rosen Atkinson is in two scenes. One where he wraps the gift. One where he uses his coat as a shield so the little boy can slip through airport security. He was supposed to be in a scene with all 9 of the couples, but it got cut.\n\nColin Firth is the best character. I shout at the telly at Laura Linney character Sarah, sheâ€™s such a wet lettuce.\n\nOne of my favourite Christmas films.\n\nI can't watch it since I realised all the successful couples are middle aged man/ young nubile woman. As far as I remember the middle aged women are either cheated on, lonely or, er, dead....\n\nI first saw the film abroad where they must have cut the porn actors. I've not seen a version since which has them in, so didn't even know Martin Freeman is in the film!"
