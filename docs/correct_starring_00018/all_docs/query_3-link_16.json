        "text": "Virgin Radio\n\n5 Dec 2023, 10:56\n\nPic: Getty and Rex\n\nLove Actually star Martine McCutcheon has made fans very happy with hints of something big coming to celebrate the film.\n\nIt's that festive time of year, so that can only mean one thing for many: an annual rewatch of Love Actually.\n\nThe star posted on her social media with an exciting update.\n\nMartine began: \"Hello everybody, I have just been filming something for the delightful Richard Curtis.\"\n\n\"He is doing something that is going to be celebrating Love Actually big time, and he asked me to be involved and I was very honoured and flattered and of course said I would,\" she enthused.\n\nClearly not wanting to give too much away, Martine continued: \"I wish I could’ve done more than I have, Richard, but hopefully my tiny contribution will be a nice little part.\"\n\n\"I will keep you guys posted about what it is but I think it’s going be a really lovely feel good thing to go and enjoy. Lots of love.\"\n\nThe star then elaborated in the caption: \"Filming done! Who would have known all these years later, Love Actually would still be such a huge part of people’s lives, especially at Christmas.\"\n\n\"I was blown away by the reach of my last insta post and the amount of beautiful comments about the film and my involvement. For me, being a part of such a huge project that explored so many different kinds of love was the ultimate dream…\n\nMartine had posted a selection of photos of her with co-star Hugh Grant on December 1st, to celebrate the film.\n\nShe continued: \"For me it’s what life is truly all about - So career wise there is nothing that would or could match it. The message of Love Actually has reached so many and continues to touch new generations. Wow! Powerful stuff!\"\n\nMartine finished off the post by writing: \"I’m so proud to be a small part of that message and I hope like in the movie, you show kindness and love to those who need it this Christmas and always.\"\n\nShe had written elsewhere: \"After all these years, I STILL can’t believe my ultimate dream of working with Hugh and Richard came true.\"\n\nFans replied excitedly about the news: \"I put it to you, that even in THAT cast. It's you that makes the movie\" wrote one.\n\n\"I've watched it a thousand times and will watch it a thousand more Love, LOVE ACTUALLY\" added another.\n\n\"One of my favourite films! Saw it at the cinema when it was first released and have watched it a million times since!\""
