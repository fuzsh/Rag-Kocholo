He's so happy and content – the happiest that he's ever been.\"\n\nWhile the movie is a Christmas classic for many, Martine hates watching it back.\n\nShe said: \"My mum loves it but I'm always critical of my performance.\"\n\nBut the 44-year-old star is looking forward to her five-year-old son Rafferty – who she has with husband Jack McManus – being old enough to watch the movie and understand its messages.\n\nShe told Britain's HELLO! Magazine: \"I'm so proud of this film. When Rafferty grows up and has children of his own, I want them all to know its message of love is what I stand for.\"\n\nMeanwhile, Martine recorded a festive EP, 'Home for Christmas', in her husband's home studio during lockdown and she admitted it helped lift her family's spirits.\n\nShe said: \"It cheered us up and brought hope. We also involved other musicians who have been out of work for months because of lockdown.\n\n\"It's important to keep your mojo going and help others feel good."
