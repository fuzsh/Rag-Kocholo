        "text": "Love Actually fans will be thrilled to see that Hugh Grant and Martine McCutcheon have finally reunited. Taking to Twitter on Sunday, the sequelâ€™s screenwriter Emma Freud shared a picture from the filming set - showing the Prime Minister and his love interest Natalie are still very much an item. Posing with the director Richard Curtis, the British stars looked delighted to be back as their famous characters. Alongside the snap, Emma announced: \"The PM, his wife and the writer who never worked out a good camera face. #rednosedayactually.\"\n\nHugh Grant and Martine McCutcheon have reunited after 14 years on Love Actually set\n\nGALLERY: Love Actually stars then and now\n\nOver the past few weeks, the writer has been teasing fans with cryptic posts and pictures as production for upcoming ten-minute Comic Relief special, dubbed Red Nose Day Actually, continues. She also noted: \"Our pm is still married. And she's still lovely. #rednosedayactually.\" Earlier this year, Martine revealed she hopes the \"magic\" will still be there between her and her old friend Hugh . Opening up about her part in the special, the 40-year-old said: \"I'm hoping me and Hugh are still together because we're filming together. I haven't been sent a script, I've just been in wardrobe. I really hope they've had a couple of kids and he's still doing his silly dancing. I'm hoping the magic of it all comes back for something so lovely.\"\n\nThere was more to Martine and Hugh's kiss than we knew!\n\nMartine, who was speaking on Loose Women, and her co-star Hugh have stayed in touch since working on the comedy in 2003. \"We have this banter,\" she said. \"We're so different, from such different backgrounds, but it's why we work. He has a go at me, I have a go at him. He's lovely, we still DM and text, but I'm so excited to work with him again. I wouldn't feel right doing it without Hugh.\" Martine and Hugh are so close that the actress said she would have only considered doing the sequel if Hugh was on board too. \"When they asked me if I was doing it, I said 'Is Hugh doing it?' and apparently, he said, 'Is Martine doing it?' But I know he would have done it without me,\" said the star."
