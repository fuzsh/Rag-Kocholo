        "text": "The Lao-China Railway (the Project) is a new 422 kilometer-long railway line in Lao PDR extending from the border with China near Boten to Vientiane capital city near the border with Thailand. This Project is actually only one section of a larger plan to link Kunming in China to Singapore by modern high-speed rail lines.\n\nThe Project is a major achievement for the government of Lao PDR. The Project was promoted, designed and largely financed by the People's Republic of China as part of its Belt and Road Initiative. The project is managed by The Laos-China Railway Company Ltd. (the Company). Total cost was projected at just under US $6 billion.\n\nThe Project is planned to have 33 railway stations in total of which 20 or 21 will be operational in the first phase with 12 to be placed into service later. In normal operation passenger trains will operate in daytime while freight trains will run at night. The Project has designated 5 stations as major stations - at Boten, Muang Xai (Oudom Xay), Luang Prabang, Vang Vieng and Vientiane. When fully operational there will be 10 stations where passengers can board and disembark - in Vientiane, Phonhong, Vang Vieng, Kasi, Luang Prabang, Muang Nga, Muang Xay (Oudom Xay), Namor, Natuey and Boten.\n\nFast trains operate at a maximum speed of 160 km per hour with the trip between Vientiane and Vang Vieng taking 40 minutes.\n\nFast Trains have 9 carriages - the control car, a dining car, a first class car with 56 seats and 6 second class coaches. There are 720 air conditioned seats total. Each seat has an electrical power outlet for use by passengers and all signage and displays are in 3 languages - Chinese, Lao & English.\n\n1st Class car interiors on left below and 2nd Class on right with happy passengers, nice drop-town tables and good leg room:\n\nLaos Train Map\n\nTIMETABLES / SCHEDULE OF TRAINS IN LAOS\n\nGood news in April 2022 that ordinary train service has been added to the schedule. The ordinary train will travel slower at maximum 120 km per hour and can carry 732 passengers in air conditioned carriages - 590 chair seats, 106 wide chair seats and 36 seat/sleeper beds.\n\nFor this service tickets may be sold for same-day travel and immediate departure so passengers may be pretty sure to a get a ticket and a seat if they arrive early and won't need to purchase tickets the day before. Fares will range from 38,000 kip up to 238,000 kip depending on distance which is lower than fares for the high-speed trains. Passengers will be allowed to carry more baggage with them on these ordinary trains than the 20 kilogram limit per passenger on the fast trains.\n\nThe railway stations and ticket offices are only open for times around when trains are scheduled to arrive or depart. At most train stations advance tickets can be purchased up to 3 days before the departure date and payment must be in cash. Passengers may still not able to purchase tickets for return travel at the same time as purchasing tickets for the first part of a round trip.\n\nTicket sales offices away from the train stations are also now open in central Luang Prabang and on the ground floor of Vientiane Center in central Vientiane. These offices are open from 10:00 am to 12:00 noon and from 12:30 pm to 15:30 pm every day. Each person may only purchase 2 tickets. Purchaser must show valid ID and vaccination certificate (green card). Payment can only be made by UnionPay card or by QR Code (OnePay, UnionPay, Alipay and Wechat) at POS machine. Currently not accepting cash payment. A service fee of 20,000 kip per ticket will be charged.\n\nPassengers beware that there is a rule that passengers must show their tickets as they leave the destination station or face a fine of the maximum ticket price or even prosecution for theft.\n\nFast train, Freight train & Ordinary train images below all near Vang Vieng in 2022.\n\nPassengers must carry photo identification and a fully-vaccinated Covid-19 certificate issued at least 3 days before departure.\n\nPassengers should arrive at the station at least one hour before departure time and remain in the waiting area for inspection of tickets and documents. All passengers need to wear protective masks and observe social distancing recommendations. Temperature checks will be carried out and anyone with a temperature higher than 37.3 Centigrade will not be allowed to enter the station.\n\nPassengers without tickets should arrive at least two hours before departure time since you need to queue for ticket purchase and again for entry to the station and then go through security checks. Things can be a little chaotic.\n\nThe main railway station interiors are only open a little before and after scheduled train departure times and no toilets or other services such as food or drinks or seats are available outside the stations. Not a good place to wait for very long and not much shade.\n\nDue to the pandemic, no food or beverage service are available at the stations or in the railway carriages. Passengers should bring their own food and drinks.\n\nLaos Train fares chart below:\n\nAllowed and Not Allowed Items on Train\n\nOnly 20 kilograms of carry-on baggage is allowed for each passenger on the high-speed trains.\n\nItems prohibited from being carried by passengers into the stations or on trains are:\n\n1) Weapons and ammunition of any kind such as pistols, rifles, sports rifles and other modified guns. (The rule does not apply to civil servants, police officers and soldiers.\n\n2) All kinds of explosives such as fireworks and rocket-propelled grenades.\n\n3) Chemicals, including hydrogen, methane, ethane, butane, ethylene, propylene, acetylene, carbon monoxide, liquefied petroleum gas, fluoride, oxygen (except for medical purposes), gasoline, diesel and kerosene.\n\n4) Drugs of all kinds, including heroin, ephedrine, crystal meth, cocaine and marijuana.\n\n5) Sharp objects such as knives, axes, cutters, etc. that can cause injury or death.\n\n6) Animals, both alive and dead, including cats and dogs."
