        "text": "Lao-China Railway Info by Hobo Maps - - - HOME\n\nSee our other web pages for Lao-China Railway Construction , Lao-China Railway Schedules and Lao-ChinaRailway Maps\n\nAlso see our Facebook page with similar info HERE\n\nNew international train D85/D86 between Luang Prabang and Sipsong Panna (Jinghong) 4 times a week - Fri., Sat., Sun. & Mon.\n\nRailway Timetable Schedule below:\n\nLCR = Lao-China Railway - Passenger line entirely powered by rainfall\n\nAt most train stations advance tickets can be purchased up to 3 days before the departure date and payment must be in cash. Passengers are not able to purchase tickets for return travel at the same time as purchasing tickets for the first part of a round trip.\n\nTicket sales offices away from the train stations are also now open in central Luang Prabang and on the ground floor of Vientiane Center in central Vientiane. Purchaser must show valid ID with passenger name. You can buy a maximum of two tickets per person and you can pay with cash. The ticket office also accepts payments with POS (UnionPay) card swipe machine and QR code (OnePay). No VISA or Mastercard is accepted (yet). A service fee of 20,000 kip per ticket is charged.\n\nA photocopy of a passengers identity card is sufficient to purchase the ticket but the original identity card must be used by the passenger on the day of travel.\n\nOnline Advance Railway Ticket Sales are now possible using Google Play app \"LCR ticket\" on a smart phone based in Laos, Thailand or China. Can download app now in Android or iOS but many foreigners are having trouble using the app - may be able to pay by UnionPay\\Alipay\\WeChat VISA and Mastercard.\n\nCharts below show ticket costs for trains departing from Vientiane & Luang Prabang in January 2024 & after. Excludes agent fees and extra 20,000 kip charged when using App or buying at ticket offices not at railway station. See our other web page for more fares charts HERE.\n\nTickets With Names - People who purchase train tickets must now show passenger identification documents and passenger names will be printed on the tickets. Passengers must keep their ticket with them at all times on the train trip and show it when leaving the arrival station or face a fine. People are allowed to buy tickets for other people - just need to show a copy of their passport or national ID card.\n\nPassengers should arrive at the station at least one hour before departure time and remain in the waiting area for inspection of tickets and documents. Passengers without tickets should arrive at least 1.5 hours before departure time since you need to queue for ticket purchase and again for entry to the station and then go through security checks.\n\nNew Lao-China Railway (LCR) ticket sales office is now open at Khamsavath Railway Station in Vientiane. Khamsavath is a new station and not part of LCR but part of the Lao-Thai Railway system. We are waiting for details of hours open and payment options.\n\nVientiane Center ticket sales (see image below) is located on our Vientiane Central Map between Talat Sao market and Parkson's dept. store.\n\nA ticket sales office is now open in central Luang Prabang - see location of Luang Prabang ticket sales office on our Luang Prabang Central Map.\n\nPassengers are advised to bring their own food and drinks.\n\nPassenger check-in procedure images below:\n\nOnly 20 kilograms of carry-on baggage is officially allowed for each passenger on the high-speed EMS trains but we never see anyone checking. Ordinary trains supposedly allow more carry-on baggage. Wheelchairs for disabled passengers are allowed and some stations have elevator access.\n\nVientiane Station Parking - Fees are now being charged for vehicle parking at Vientiane Train Station - 5,000 kip for motorbikes and 10,000 kip for passenger vehicles. Overnight parking for cars is 80,000 kip. Vehicles no longer have to pay a fee to pick up or drop off passengers if their vehicles stay less than 10 minutes.\n\nVang Vieng railway statation is also charging fees for vehicles to enter the station parking area - 3,000 kip for motorbikes & 20,000 kip for cars. There is a free drop-off place 100 meters before the station entrance so most vehicles stop there and passengers walk in free.\n\nLuang Prabang station allows free vehicle entry for a stay of less than 10 minutes but has a fee for longer stay.\n\nE-cigarettes and vaping are not legal in Laos and these items may be confiscated by train station security staff. Separate police action is possible with fines or prosecution.\n\nItems prohibited from being carried by passengers into the stations or on trains are:\n\n1) Weapons and ammunition of any kind such as pistols, rifles, sports rifles and other modified guns. (The rule does not apply to civil servants, police officers and soldiers.\n\n2) All kinds of explosives such as fireworks and rocket-propelled grenades.\n\n3) Chemicals, including hydrogen, methane, ethane, butane, ethylene, propylene, acetylene, carbon monoxide, liquefied petroleum gas, fluoride, oxygen (except for medical purposes), gasoline, diesel and kerosene.\n\n4) Drugs of all kinds, including heroin, ephedrine, crystal meth, cocaine and marijuana.\n\n5) Sharp objects such as knives, axes, cutters, etc. that can cause injury or death.\n\n6) Animals, both alive and dead, including cats and dogs.\n\n7) Food that smells bad or watery food that can cause uncleanliness and dirty the surroundings of the train or stations.\n\n8) Aerosol cans\n\nPower banks (battery backups) seem to be allowed on trains with no restrictions.\n\nSnacks cart images below on ordinary train in 2023.\n\nThe Railway Project was promoted, designed and largely financed by the People's Republic of China as part of its Belt and Road Initiative. The project is managed by The Laos-China Railway Company Ltd. Total cost was around US $6 billion.\n\nThe Project is planned to eventually have 33 railway stations in total of which 20 or 21 will be operational in the first phase with 12 to be placed into service later. The Project has 5 major stations in Laos - at Boten, Muang Xai (Oudom Xay), Luang Prabang, Vang Vieng and Vientiane and 4 major stations in Yunnan China - Mohon, Jinghong, Pu'er & Kunmingan.

Fares are lower than fares for the high-speed trains. Passengers will be allowed to carry more baggage on ordinary trains than the 20 kilogram limit per passenger on the fast trains.\n\nOrdinary Train images below:\n\nLuang Prabang Railway Station image below:\n\nMinivan transport from Luang Prabang Railway Station to central town signs below in June 2023. Very reasonable prices for drop-off at destination that passenger chooses.\n\nThe railway Project is often referred to as the Laos-China Railway by foreigners while Lao people often say Lao-China instead of Laos-China.

Other names include the Vientiane-Boten Railway and Boten-Vientiane Railway\n\nRailway distance chart below:\n\nThe Lao-China Railway is a 1,037 kilometer-long railway line in northern Lao PDR and Yunnan China. 996 km of this is now operating for passeng travel between Vientiane station and Kunming South station.
