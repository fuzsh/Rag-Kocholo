        "text": "A visit to Westport, Klang in Malaysia. Ports play a major role in the economic and social development of countries. Port Klang - the 12th largest port in the world and the 2nd largest in Southeast Asia in terms of TEU (Twenty-foot Equivalent Unit). Malaysia is truly blessed with its strategic location along the Malacca Straits, one of the most important and busiest shipping lanes in the world for global trade. An estimated one-third of the world's containerized cargo passes through the Strait each year. Ports often spur the growth of industrial development and the establishment of free trade zones in their vicinity. These developments benefit from proximity to the port, reducing transportation costs and improving supply chain efficiency. #industrial\n\nMediterranean Shipping Company (MSC) is expanding its service offerings in the Philippines, introducing three new weekly calls in Manila North Harbor and launching an inaugural service to Davao. The new service offerings support the expansion of local businesses by directly connecting the Philippines with major global trade centers through reliable services at competitive transit times, the company said in a statement. The New Origami, Kaguya and Lang Co services now provide three new weekly calls in Manila North Harbor, increasing coverage by directly connecting Manila with Southeast Asia and South China.

Or that it is home to the largest roundabout in the world? These facts were new to me until the COREX Logistics team and I started actively planning projects there. In our exploration of potential logistical options, we discovered some fascinating aspects: Malaysia has well-developed transport links in the western part (Peninsular Malaysia). However, the eastern part (East Malaysia – Sabah and Sarawak) features several hard-to-reach areas. Nonetheless, this does not deter COREX; we are fully capable of reaching these locations. Furthermore, we are equipped to offer cargo delivery under various temperature conditions to any area within this extraordinary country. To be honest, I was already familiar with a few facts about this wonderful country from my travels there several years ago. For example, the renowned shoe designer Jimmy Choo hails from Malaysia.
