        "text": "We are not a ticketing agent and provide the information below for your convenience only. See China-Laos Railway Company for current information.\n\nThe bullet train, named Lane Xang, opened on 2 Dec 2021. The streamlined “China-standard” bullet train, or the Electric Multiple Unit (EMU) train, designed and built by Chinese companies, can run at 160 km/hour. It is operated by the Laos-China Railway Company. The express train is named Lane Xang and is equipped with snack and beverage bars, facilities for people with disabilities and information services in Lao, Chinese and English. It has 9 carriages – a control car, a dining car, a first-class car with 56 seats and 6 second-class coaches. There are 720 air-conditioned seats in total. Each seat has an electrical power outlet.\n\nTicket Offices and Purchasing Train Tickets\n\nThe railway station ticket offices are open around when trains are scheduled to arrive or depart. At most train stations advance tickets can be purchased up to 3 days before the departure date and payment must be in cash. People who purchase train tickets must now show passenger identification documents and passenger names will be printed on the tickets. Passengers must keep their ticket with them at all times on the train trip and show it when leaving the arrival station or face a fine. People are allowed to buy tickets for other people – just need to show a copy of their passport or national ID card.\n\nNon-railway ticket offices are open in central Luang Prabang (Near Vietnamese Embassy) and on the ground floor of Vientiane Center in central Vientiane. Hours are 10:00 am to 12:00 noon and from 12:30 pm to 15:30 pm each day (note these can vary). Each person may only purchase 2 tickets. You must show valid ID (passport for foreigners or Family Book/ID for Lao Nationals) and a COVID-19 vaccination certificate. Payment can only be made by UnionPay card or by QR Code (OnePay, UnionPay, Alipay and Wechat) at a POS machine. Cash is not accepted. Essentially tourists cannot pay for a ticket without a local with a Lao Bank Account. A service fee of 20,000 kip per ticket is charged.\n\nYou must show your tickets as you leave the destination station or face a fine of the maximum ticket price.\n\nIf you don’t have a ticket, you should arrive at least two hours before departure time since you need to queue for ticket purchase and again for entry to the station and then go through security checks.\n\nThe main railway station interiors are only open a little before and after scheduled train departure times and no toilets or other services such as food or drinks or seats are available outside the stations. Not a good place to wait for very long and not much shade, be prepared to wait a few hours. From October 2022, outside toilets are provided by a 3rd party and can use used for a small fee.\n\nLimited beverages and snacks are available onboard the trains.\n\nYou should arrive at the station at least one hour before departure time and remain in the waiting area for the inspection of tickets and documents. All passengers need to wear protective masks and observe social distancing recommendations. Temperature checks will be carried out and anyone with a temperature higher than 37.3 Centigrade will not be allowed to enter the station.\n\nTo check tick availability see posts at https://www.facebook.com/LaosChinaRailway\n\nLuggage\n\nPassengers will be allowed to carry more baggage with them on K11/K12 slow trains. The express train has a 20-kilogram limit per passenger.\n\nThere are 32 stations along the Laos-China Railway line. These are the 20 main stations, including 10 passenger stations and 10 cargo stations.\n\nTrain Fares as at Jan 2024\n\nTrain Timetable (from 22 Jan 2024)\n\nLaos-China Railway stations\n\nInformation on the Laos-China Railway\n\nThe railway is 422.4 km long.\n\nPassenger trains operate during the day and freight trains at night.\n\nThe railway was officially opened on 2 Dec 2021, Lao National Day (1 year ahead of schedule).\n\nConstruction began in December 2016. In the north, the line will be connected to the Chinese rail system in Mohan, through the Yuxi–Mohan Railway. In the south, it meets the existing metre-gauge railway in Thanaleng, linking it via Nong Khai in Thailand to Bangkok. A high-speed, standard gauge extension to Bangkok is also under construction – and scheduled for completion in 2028. When finished, the Boten–Vientiane Railway will form an important part of the Kunming–Singapore Railway.\n\nVideo of Fast Train – Ordinary Train – Freight Train captured by hobo Maps at Vang Vien in April 2022."
