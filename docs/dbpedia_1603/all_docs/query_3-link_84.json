Services at this station are limited to only two departures per day, as it is much more convenient to take a bus from Vientaine into Thailand direct rather than ride 20km to this station which is actually situated in the middle of nowhere, ride the train 10min. across the Friendship Bridge and the switch to another Thai train or bus from there. Be that as it may, a lot seems to be hanging on the completion of China's ambitious Kunming (China) to Singapore train line via Laos. And although this will effective bankrupt Laos and put the country eternally in China's clutches, almost everyone I spoke to in Laos had high hopes for this high speed railway. The track bed and ground work for this China- Singapore line already seems to be in place, if the levelled ground at the far end (the one with the truck on it) is any indication.
