        "text": "From Kunming to Nanning with a length of 707km and speed of 250km/h, bringing journey times from Kunming to Nanning down to four hours, and to Guangzhou to seven hours.\n\nThis “sky railway” is representative of China’s high-speed railway in mountainous areas with complicated geological hazards. It required an all-weather, high-efficiency and high quality field survey in difficult and dangerous mountain areas and implemented a “quickly identify risks, avoid major risks, prevent and control general risks, and monitor potential risks” disaster reduction approach.\n\nThe developed swelling soil subgrade deformation control technology is internationally advanced. The Nanpanjiang Super Large Bridge with a main span of 416m is the world’s largest span concrete arch bridge for mixed passenger and freight railway.\n\nThe project stretched boundaries with comprehensive treatment of tunnel karst and control of large extrusion deformation, and 12 long and high-risk tunnels above 10km.\n\nKunming South Railway Station is also the largest comprehensive transportation terminal in Southwest China."
