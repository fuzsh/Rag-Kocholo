        "text": "The idea of ​​the age of speed is no longer a sole objective for China, but has become an urgent necessity to keep pace with the accelerating development of the world, reduce distances, and save time, effort, and money.\n\nImagine traveling nearly 2,000 miles from southwest China to reach Singapore – less than 30 hours later!\n\nThis is the scenario China envisions for Southeast Asia as part of its Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), a vast overseas infrastructure development program launched more than a decade ago.\n\nIn 2021, the Laos-China semi-high-speed passenger railway opened, linking southwest China’s commercial center of Kunming with the Laotian capital Vientiane – a journey that took about 10 hours and spanned about 1,000 kilometers (621 miles). This journey saved time and stimulated tourist traffic and economic.\n\nAlso with China’s help, Southeast Asia’s first high-speed train began operating in Indonesia in October 2023. This train connected the capital, Jakarta, to Bandung in West Java, one of the country’s largest cities and an important center for arts and culture.\n\nMeanwhile, a second high-speed rail project is underway in Thailand, which aims to connect the Laos-China Railway to Bangkok – but is now facing further delays and rising construction costs. Rolling out in phases, the Thai government currently expects the full line to be operational by 2028. The Chinese government has not provided timeline details.\n\nThe project, considered a “financial trap” by some analysts, has been a source of debate in Thailand, where the government has agreed to bear the full construction cost of $5 billion (179 billion baht) for the first construction phase, Reuters reported. The Chinese side will be responsible for the systems installation, design and purchase of the trains.\n\nWhen this line is finally completed, the plan is to expand into northern Malaysia, where it will connect to the capital, Kuala Lumpur, before finally terminating 350 kilometers (218 miles) south in Singapore.\n\nIn January, bids were submitted from local and international consortia for the lucrative project. But Japanese companies, including East Japan Railway Co, reportedly pulled out after deciding it would be too risky without formal financial support from the Malaysian government.\n\n“China already boasts the world’s largest high-speed rail network, and Chinese companies have long been looking to sell and export their infrastructure technology to countries,” says travel and consumer trends analyst Gary Bowerman, founder of Check-in Asia, a tourism-focused company.\n\nBowerman added that Southeast Asia is the “obvious” choice because of its “proximity to China.”\n\nConnecting mainland cities by train directly to Laos and other Southeast Asian countries (down the line) will make it easy and beneficial for Chinese travelers – many of whom are not looking to travel long distances, for long periods of time.\n\nAttraction of Southeast Asia\n\n“China sees Southeast Asia as a major export market as well as a key region for security, and I believe it ultimately wants to see Southeast Asian countries within its geopolitical sphere of influence.”\n\n“Interestingly, the large Chinese diaspora in the region is another big draw,” experts add.\n\n“Cities like Penang and Malacca in Malaysia and Phuket Old Town, with their temples and architecture, were built by Chinese immigrants and are very popular with Chinese tourists because of their historical and cultural connections,” Bowerman says.\n\nBowerman added that the other reason is the rising popularity of rail travel – especially among younger Chinese tourists, many of whom are committed to sustainable travel and are looking for a new sense of adventure.\n\nPan Wenbo, a 30-year-old security practitioner from Beijing, told CNN that taking an epic train journey across Southeast Asia from his country, rather than flying, should be cheap and offer plenty of scenic views along the way. Ban has visited Thailand, Singapore, Vietnam and the Philippines in the past five years and says he is keen to explore other countries in the region.\n\nOthers like college student Mei Wei took travel tips and inspiration from popular influencers on Chinese social media apps like Douyin — the Chinese version of TikTok — and Youku, the Chinese YouTube.\n\nInauguration of First High-speed Train in China’s “Belt and Road” Initiative\n\nIndonesian President Joko Widodo took a test ride on Southeast Asia’s first high-speed rail train, one of the key projects under China’s Belt and Road infrastructure initiative.\n\nThe $7.3 billion railway project, much of which was funded by China, links the capital, Jakarta, and Bandung, the capital of the densely populated province of West Java. The new line is scheduled to begin commercial operations on October 1, and will reduce travel time between the two cities. From three hours currently to about 40 minutes.\n\nThe 142.3-kilometre-long railway was built by PT Kerita Sibat Indonesia-China, a joint venture between an Indonesian consortium of four state-owned enterprises and China Railway International Corporation, according to the Associated Press.\n\nChallenges, disagreements\n\nMany of these projects, such as the China-Laos Railway, were designed with economic interests in mind, experts say. According to Chinese state media, the China-Laos Railway cumulatively transported 4.22 million tons of freight in 2023, an increase of 94.91% year on year.\n\nPolitical economist Suvannasinghe, who boarded the train months after passenger services launched in April 2023, said it was “very clear, even close to full construction and inauguration” of a freight-carrying project, with China and Thailand being the main nodes for trade and Laos being left on top of the bill for the project.\n\n“I think Beijing ultimately wants to see Southeast Asian countries within its geopolitical sphere of influence. These projects have always been in Beijing’s strategic and geopolitical interest,” says Suvanasinghe, who highlighted the financial burden placed on Laos after the Chinese-financed railway project in billions of dollars.\n\nMoney lent to the Lao government through Chinese sovereign lending must be repaid and soon. The direct impact of this external debt on Laos is evident in the recurring pressures and financial crisis, and the consequences for Lao society as a whole are quite clear.\n\nIn Malaysia, where a high-speed rail link with neighboring Singapore is planned, many experts have consistently expressed strong opposition and exercised caution about sovereignty. Some have drawn parallels with Hong Kong‘s West Kowloon Railway Station which opened to much fanfare and controversy in 2018.\n\nThe $10.75 billion infrastructure investment connects Hong Kong to 44 mainland Chinese destinations, including major cities such as Beijing and Shanghai. But it also allows mainland Chinese law to apply to part of Hong Kong Terminal, a controversial arrangement that has drawn heated public criticism for undermining the city’s autonomy.\n\nWong stressed that while there are “definite advantages” to high-speed trains, the decision to build and launch one must be balanced with costs and benefits.\n\n“In the example of a high-speed rail line between Malaysia and Singapore, Singapore would probably only have one station — Malaysia would have more,” Wong told CNN. “But who will have the final say?\n\n“For now at least, there is no need for a high-speed rail link between Malaysia and Singapore, especially when there are already efficient trains and rail flights of less than three hours. The costs are very high and it will be very difficult to do this.”\n\nRelated Topics :\n\nChina, U.S Emerge as Top Contributors in Saudi Investment\n\nTHE FUTURE OF BLOCKCHAIN\n\nCEO of Aramco: Aramco Look Forward to Invest in China"
