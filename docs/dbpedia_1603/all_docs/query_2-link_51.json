Around this time last year, work began on a high-speed railway to link the capital of China’s Yunnan province with the Laotian capital of Vientiane, and eventually with Singapore. Last month, Kunming’s Deputy Mayor Ruan Fengbin took a road trip to Singapore, telling people and governments on the way that Yunnan, China’s emerging economic powerhouse, is within everyone’s easy reach. Later this June, a spanking new international airport will formally open for business in Kunming, vastly expanding its air links with Asia, and the world.",
