        "text": "The Bangkok–Nong Khai high-speed railway is a planned railway that will connect Bangkok to Nong Khai in northeast Thailand on the Laos border. It will then be connected to the Laos-China Railway, providing a railway connection from Bangkok to Vientiane, and onwards to Kunming in China. This new railway is a double-track standard-gauge line that follows the same route as the current Northeastern line.\n\nThe project is also referred to as the China-Thailand Railway project, in reference to being built in partnership with Chinese companies (China Railway International and China Railway Design Corp).\n\nThe new railway was first proposed in 2010 alongside four other proposed high-speed railways from Bangkok. After years of delays due to terms of the arrangement with China and the 2014 coup, work officially began in 2017 before being delayed again. The project is now back on track, and the first stage between Bangkok and Nakhon Ratchasima is scheduled to open in 2023.\n\nPhase 1 of construction is for the 253km section between Bangkok and Nakhon Ratchasima, at a cost of Bt50.63-billion ($1.67 billion USD). Stations in this section include Bang Sue, Don Muang, Ayutthaya, Saraburi, Pak Chong, and Nakhon Ratchasima.\n\nPhase 2 of the 354.5km section from Nakhon Ratchasima to Nong Khai is still in draft. The stations will include Nakhon Ratchasima, Bua Yai, Ban Phai, Khon Kaen, Udon Thani, and Nong Khai.\n\nA new bridge will be built on the Thailand-Laos border for the railway.\n\nThe total length will be 607.5 km long with an operating speed of 250 km/h. By comparison, the current Bangkok–Nong Khai railway is a length of 647.5 km and takes 9 hours and 25 minutes (an average speed of 68 km/h).\n\nThe new railway will be able to travel between Bangkok and Vientiane in under 3 hours, making it a competitive alternative to flying. Bangkokians will have the opportunity to take weekend trips to Luang Prabang by rail. It will turn Ayuthaya into a viable Bangkok commuter city, and it will put the Isaan cities of Nakhon Ratchasima, Khon Kaen, and Udon Thani within a day trip to Bangkok.\n\nThe current Bangkok–Nong Khai railway is a single-track metre-gauge railway. It is currently being double-tracked, and the line will be retained for local and freight services. There will be new stations built for the high-speed line, and in Bangkok the railway will depart from Bang Sue Grand Station.\n\nThe Laos-China Railway was completed at the end of 2021, so by the time the Bangkok–Nong Khai project is finished, it will be ready to travel to Vientiane and the rest of Laos.\n\nBangkok–Nong Khai High-Speed Railway Map\n\n[Map of Bangkok–Nong Khai high-speed railway.]\n\nLinks and resources\n\nhighspeedrail-thai-china.com: The Cooperation between the Government of the Kingdom of Thailand and the Government of the People’s Republic of China on Bangkok–Nong Khai HSR Development for Regional Connectivity.\n\nNews Archive\n\n2024\n\nGovt ‘keen’ to expedite Korat link – [26/06/24]\n\n“The construction of the 250.77-kilometre high-speed rail link between Bangkok and Nakhon Ratchasima is expected to conclude sometime in 2028.”\n\nSRT demolishes buildings in Nakhon Ratchasima for high-speed rail – [31/05/24]\n\nSuriya: Thai-Chinese high-speed railway on track to open in 2030 – [09/05/24]\n\nE-bidding for 2nd phase of Thai-Chinese high-speed railway to be held next year – [22/04/24]\n\n“The State Railway of Thailand (SRT) will next year launch electronic bidding for 13 contacts of the second phase of the 341-billion-baht Thai-Chinese high-speed railway project.”\n\n2nd phase of Thai-China rail gets nod – [22/04/24]\n\n“The State Railway of Thailand (SRT) board has approved the second phase of the Thai-Chinese high-speed train project from Nakhon Ratchasima to Nong Khai with a total investment of 341.35 billion baht.”\n\nFinal high-speed rail contracts to be signed soon – [18/04/24]\n\n“Progress expected on long-delayed first phase from Bangkok to Nakhon Ratchasima.”\n\nThai-China link can boost both economies, says envoy – [25/03/24]\n\n“Cooperation between Thailand and China will get a further boost when the new high-speed rail project is completed, Chinese ambassador Han Zhiqiang said.”\n\nConstruction of the high-speed train station in Ayutthaya to begin in March – [01/03/24]\n\nNortheast Thailand – new economic hub coinciding with China-Laos high-speed rail project – [01/03/24]\n\n“Krungthai COMPASS Research Center views the China-Laos high-speed rail project and the development of the Northeast as pivotal for transforming the region into an economic center of the Greater Mekong Subregion.”\n\nSino-Thai rail link set for 2-year, B4bn delay – [27/02/24]\n\n“The construction of the Thai-Chinese high-speed train project is likely to face a delay of two years and about 4 billion baht more in funding to change a section of track in Nakhon Ratchasima”.\n\nSRT agrees changes to design of Thai-Chinese high-speed train project – [26/02/24]\n\n“The State Railway of Thailand (SRT) has agreed to adjust the design of a section of the Thai-Chinese high-speed train project, in response to complaints from people in Nakhon Ratchasima province.
