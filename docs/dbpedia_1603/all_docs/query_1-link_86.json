        "text": "InÂ recent years a myriadÂ of huge China train stations have been built to complement the development of China's new high speed rail network.\n\nWhilst much of the focus goes on theÂ newly opened lines and their train speeds, it is often overlooked that aÂ huge number of impressive railway stations have been constructed and refurbished, from single line commuter stationsÂ to cavernous city terminals.\n\nIn this article we introduce the largestÂ China train stations whichÂ can be found across this vast nation.\n\nDevelopment of China Train Stations\n\nChina has had a substantial railwayÂ network for many years, but it is only with the development of high speed rail in the last decade that their massive stadium-sized train stations haveÂ emerged.\n\nTo complement theÂ astonishingÂ 22,000km of high speed rail lines built,Â vast numbers of purpose built train stations have been constructed. Many of these train stations are so large that it makes more sense to compare them to airports, such is their scale.\n\nRemarkably, each of the 20 largestÂ China train stations have either been comprehensively refurbished or newly built in the last ten years.\n\nWhere the Largest China Train Stations areÂ Located\n\nAs you'd expect, some of China's largest stations are located in the big cities such as Beijing, Shanghai and Guangzhou, but there are also a surprising number of stations in less well-known cities that have made this list.\n\nThese are distributed widely across the country as can be seen from this map:\n\n20 Largest China Train Stations\n\nBefore we could prepare this article we first had to decide how to define \"largest\". Many of these stations are really new so it was difficult to find data on the number of passengers or total station area.\n\nWhat we were able to determine though was the number of platforms at each station, and using this measure the largest China train stationÂ is Xi'an North which hasÂ 34!\n\nHere are the 20 largest China train stations in order of number of platforms:\n\n1. Xi'an North Railway Station\n\nNo. of Platforms: 34\n\nChinese name: è¥¿å®åç« (XÄ« Än BÄi ZhÃ n)\n\nProvince: Shaanxi\n\nOpened in: 2011\n\nConnects with: Xi'an Metro Line 2\n\nHistorically the eastern starting point of the Silk Road, perhaps it is only appropriate that in the age of 'One Road, One Belt' Xi'an plays home to China's largest train station.\n\n2. Zhengzhou East Railway Station\n\nNo. of Platforms: 32\n\nChinese name: éå·ä¸ç« (ZhÃ¨ng ZhÅu DÅng ZhÃ n)\n\nProvince: Henan\n\nOpened in: 2012\n\nConnects with: Zhengzhou Metro Line 1\n\nIn July 2008 when I travelled from Shanghai to Zhengzhou the only option was an overnight sleeper train. That same journey today can be done in just 4 hours.\n\n3= Shanghai Hongqiao Railway Station\n\nNo. of Platforms: 30\n\nChinese name: ä¸æµ·è¹æ¡¥ç« (ShÃ ng HÇi HÃ³ng QiÃ¡o ZhÃ n)\n\nProvince: Shanghai City\n\nOpened in: 2010\n\nConnects with: Shanghai Metro Line 2 & Line 10 and Shanghai Hongqiao International Airport\n\nConnected to one of China's most useful airports, Shanghai's Hongqiao train station is a massive facility with services to all over the country.\n\nI have regularly visited the station for many years and it's sheer size never fails to impress.Â TheÂ photo above was taken in 2015 whilst waiting for my train in the station's upstairs food court, which can be a good place to wait to get away from the crowds.\n\n3=Â Kunming South Railway Station\n\nNo. of Platforms: 30\n\nChinese name: ææåç« (KÅ«n MÃ­ng NÃ¡n ZhÃ n)\n\nProvince: Yunnan\n\nOpened in: 2016\n\nConnects with: Kunming Metro Line 1\n\nKunming is the capital of South West China's Yunnan province and is considered the gateway for southern neighboursÂ Vietnam, Laos & Myanmar.\n\nWith construction underway on multipleÂ sections of the proposed Kunming-Singapore railway it is hoped that one day a train trip between the cities might take just 10 hours.\n\n5= Guangzhou South Railway Station\n\nNo. of Platforms: 28\n\nChinese name: å¹¿å·åç« (GuÇng ZhÅu NÃ¡n ZhÃ n)\n\nProvince: Guangdong\n\nOpened in: 2010\n\nConnects with: Guangzhou Metro Line 2 & Line 7\n\nThe largest of Guangzhou's four main train stations, Guangzhou South Station serves lines to both Hong Kong and Beijing.\n\n5= Nanjing South Railway Station\n\nNo. of Platforms: 28\n\nChinese name: åäº¬åç« (NÃ¡n JÄ«ng NÃ¡n ZhÃ n)\n\nProvince: Jiangsu\n\nOpened in: 2011\n\nConnects with: Nanjing Metro Line 1 & Line 3 & Line S1\n\nI travelled to Nanjing South Railway station in 2015 whilst visiting Nanjing for an auditÂ and took the above photo.

With pink neon lighting throughout both its interior and exterior this station certainly made an impression!\n\n5= Guiyang North Railway Station\n\nNo. of Platforms: 28\n\nChinese name: è´µé³åç« (GuÃ¬ YÃ¡ng BÄi ZhÃ n)\n\nProvince: Guizhou\n\nOpened in: 2014\n\nConnects with: Guiyang BRT\n\nLocated in one of China's less developed and remote provinces I was a little surprised to see Guiyang's North station make this list, but this 2014 built station houses an incredible 28 platforms.\n\n9= Chengdu East Railway Station\n\nNo. of Platforms: 26\n\nChinese name: æé½ä¸ç« (ChÃ©ng DÅ« DÅng ZhÃ n)\n\nProvince: Sichuan\n\nOpened in: 2011\n\nConnects with: Chengdu Metro Line 2\n\nHome of the Panda and China's spiciest hotpot Chengdu is a fantastic city for tourism.
