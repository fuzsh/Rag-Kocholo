        "text": "The War During 1940\n\nEarly in April Germany invaded Denmark and Norway. Denmark accepted the “protection” that Germany offered the two countries. Norway, however, declared war.\n\nBritish troops landed in Norway, but they were unable to stop the German advance. In May the British forces were evacuated. On June 9 Norway fell. King Haakon VII escaped and set up a government in exile in London.\n\nInvasion of the Low Countries\n\nOn May 10 German forces invaded Belgium, the Netherlands, and Luxembourg. Luxembourg was occupied without resistance. Belgium and the Netherlands declared war.\n\nWinston Churchill now replaced Neville Chamberlain as prime minister of Great Britain. The Allies sent troops into the Low Countries, but by May 14 the Dutch army had to give up the fight. The Netherlands was quickly brought under the rule of German occupation forces. Queen Wilhelmina fled to London, where she formed a government in exile.\n\nDunkirk evacuation; Italy enters war\n\nOn May 13 German armored forces, in a surprise move, broke through the lightly defended Ardennes Forest area north of the Maginot Line. Their columns drove through to the English Channel, cutting off British and French troops in northern France and Belgium.\n\nKing Leopold of Belgium surrendered his army on May 28. The Allies had no choice but to attempt an escape by sea. From May 29 to June 4 the Allies evacuated 360,000 soldiers from Dunkirk. Their equipment was left behind.\n\nThe battle of France began on June 5. The Germans attacked along a 100-mile (160-kilometer) front from near Laon to the English Channel. They smashed through the French forces and headed for Paris. The French army fell apart. At this point Italy declared war on Britain and France.\n\nFall of France\n\nThe French government moved to Tours on June 11 and later to Bordeaux. The Germans occupied Paris on June 14. The French cabinet, defeatist and deeply divided, asked for an armistice. Marshal Philippe Pétain, the 84-year-old hero of World War I, became premier.\n\nThe Franco-German armistice was signed on June 22 in the forest of Compiègne. It was signed in the same railway car in which France had dictated its terms to a beaten Germany 22 years before. The Franco-Italian armistice was signed on June 24. More than half of France was now occupied by German troops. This included France’s entire Atlantic coast and its northern area from Geneva almost to Tours.\n\nVichy government and Free French\n\nMarshal Pétain built a fascist state with headquarters at Vichy in the unoccupied part of France. The Vichy government worked with the Germans. This was called collaboration.\n\nSome of the French fighting forces escaped to Britain. Called the Free French, they carried on the fight against Germany under the leadership of the French general Charles de Gaulle. Loyal Frenchmen called partisans, also known as the Resistance, secretly supported the Free French in France.\n\nA number of French ships joined the British, and others were interned in British harbors. Ships that resisted were destroyed by the British fleet. The official French government then broke off diplomatic relations with Britain.\n\nThe battle of Britain\n\nHitler expected that the fall of France would cause Britain to surrender. In July he urged Britain to make peace with Germany. Churchill refused.\n\nAt the start of the war Hitler had threatened mass air attacks against England. His threat was finally carried out in August 1940. Almost daily hundreds of German planes swarmed across the English Channel from bases in occupied France to bomb England. At first the attacks targeted British ports, airfields, and radar stations. In early September, however, Hitler ordered the Luftwaffe to shift its attacks to London and other cities. These relentless bombing raids are known as the Blitz.\n\nThe German air attack was to be followed by an invasion of England. Hermann Göring, World War I air ace and commander of the German Luftwaffe, had told Hitler his planes could drive the Royal Air Force (RAF) out of the skies. The Luftwaffe failed. The greatly outnumbered RAF destroyed the German bombers at a crippling rate. The battle of Britain, as the RAF defense of the country was called, was one of the most important battles in the history of the world. Never after October 1940 did Hitler seriously consider invading Britain.\n\nJapan threatens in Far East\n\nJapan was an industrialized country, but it had few natural resources. The United States was its principal supplier of raw materials prior to 1939, but the Japanese had already begun to look elsewhere.\n\nJapanese expansion began in 1931–32 with the seizure of Manchuria, in northeastern China. In the following years Japan seized more territory bordering on Manchuria. By 1937 the Japanese had secured most of northeastern China, including Beijing, Shanghai, and Nanjing. The atrocities committed against civilians by the Japanese in their seizure of Nanjing were some of the most terrible of the war. The Chinese Nationalists under Chiang Kai-shek and the Communists under Mao Zedong put aside their civil war to oppose the Japanese, but to little avail.\n\nGermany’s conquest of the Netherlands and France left undefended the rich Netherlands Indies and French Indochina. In September Japan threatened to invade French Indochina. By this threat it got air bases there to use in its war against China. The Chinese were isolated by Japan’s seizure of their ports, roads, and railroads.\n\nOn September 27 Japan signed the Tripartite, or Axis, Pact with Germany and Italy. The pact joined the three nations in an effort to create a new world order. Their alliance would become known as the Rome-Berlin-Tokyo Axis, or the Axis powers. Under the agreement Germany and Italy would control Europe and Japan would control eastern Asia.\n\nTo check Japanese expansion the United States kept its fleet in the Pacific. It also placed economic restraints, or sanctions, on Japan, which depended on the United States for scrap iron, oil, cotton, and metals. In September 1940 the United States banned shipments of many of these materials to Japan. It also threatened to stop giving foreign credits, which Japan used to trade abroad.\n\nBritain also helped to control Japan in the Far East because Britain held strategically located Singapore. This was the key to power in southeastern Asia. However, most of the British fleet was soon sent home to protect the British Isles.\n\nHow the United States helped the Allies\n\nThe fall of France left Britain and its empire fighting alone. On September 3 the United States transferred 50 old destroyers to Britain. In return the United States got 99-year leases on sites for air and naval bases in the British possessions of Newfoundland, Bermuda, British Guiana, and the British West Indies.\n\nThe United States also went to work speeding up its rearmament. A two-ocean navy was planned. An air force of 50,000 airplanes was started. In October the nation adopted peacetime compulsory military service for the first time in its history.\n\nThe war in the Mediterranean and Near East\n\nIn the winter of 1940–41 Germany and Italy started a campaign against British power in the Mediterranean region. The British position in the Mediterranean was based on control of the two bottleneck passages to the sea—Gilbraltar at the western end and the Suez Canal in the east.\n\nThe Axis campaign was launched against Suez. An Italian attack in North Africa was coupled with a German drive through southeastern Europe. The object was to drive the British from the eastern Mediterranean. The Italian offensive was a failure. By early 1941 almost all Mussolini’s East African empire was in British hands.\n\nGermany, however, had more success in the Balkans. It overran Romania, Hungary, Bulgaria, Yugoslavia, and Greece. It was then able to come to Italy’s aid. The British forces were driven out of Libya.\n\nThe War During 1941\n\nEarly in 1941 Britain announced that it soon would be unable to pay for the war materials it had been buying from the United States. The United States Congress gave the president authority to lend or lease arms and supplies to countries whose defense he thought important to the security of the United States. Under the Lend-Lease Act a steady stream of planes, tanks, guns, and other war goods rolled off American assembly lines to be sent to Britain and other Allied nations. The United States became known as the Arsenal of Democracy.\n\nUnited States Lend-Lease Act Lend-lease aid British Empire $31,390,000,000 Soviet Union 11,100,000,000 France 3,230,000,000 China 1,557,399,993 American republics 495,410,240 Netherlands 230,127,717 Greece 75,475,880 Belgium 148,394,457 Norway 51,524,124 Turkey 26,026,355 Yugoslavia 32,026,355 Other countries 24,787,879 Aid not charged to foreign governments 2,578,827,000 Total $50,940,000,000 Reverse lend-lease aid United Kingdom $5,072,102,000 Australia 835,004,000 New Zealand 204,566,000 India 639,443,000 Union of South Africa 885,000 France 795,471,000 French Africa 70,358,000 French New Caledonia 1,171,000 Belgium 191,033,983 Belgian Congo 182,000 Netherlands 1,450,699 Dutch Curaçao and Suriname 917,000 China 3,672,000 Soviet Union 2,210,000 Total $7,818,465,682\n\nGetting these supplies across the Atlantic into the hands of British soldiers became a major problem. United States President Franklin D. Roosevelt announced he would take any measures necessary to ensure their delivery. On April 9 the United States took Greenland under its protection for the rest of the war. In July American troops replaced the British forces in Iceland.\n\nOn August 9, 1941, Roosevelt met with Winston Churchill on a battleship off the coast of Newfoundland. After five days of talks they issued the Atlantic Charter. Although the United States was not yet officially in the war, this document outlined the Allies’ war aims and called for the “final destruction of Nazi tyranny.” American and British military staffs had already agreed that in the event of a war against both Japan and Germany, the Allies would concentrate on the defeat of Germany first.\n\nGermany invades the Soviet Union\n\nBoth Germany and the Soviet Union thought of their nonaggression pact of 1939 as temporary. It gave the Soviets time to build defenses against German attack. It gave Germany peace along its eastern frontiers during the war in the west. Throughout the spring of 1941, however, there were signs that the pact might be broken.\n\nOn June 22 Germany invaded the Soviet Union. Other nations quickly took sides in the ensuing conflict. Italy, Hungary, Finland, and Romania declared war on the Soviet Union. Britain pledged aid to the Soviet Union, and the United States promised war goods.\n\nThe new conflict\n\nGermany’s war on the Soviet Union locked in battle the two largest armies in the world. The front extended for 2,000 miles (3,200 kilometers) from the White Sea to the Black Sea. Germany struck its heaviest blows on three sectors of this long front: (1) from East Prussia through the Baltic states toward Leningrad (now St. Petersburg); (2) from the northern part of German Poland through White Russia toward Moscow; and (3) from the southern part of German Poland through Ukraine toward Kyiv (Kiev).\n\nThe Germans drove rapidly forward, cutting off entire Soviet armies. Despite these tremendous losses, strong resistance by the Red Army and guerrilla warfare behind the German lines slowed the German drive. In addition, as the Soviets retreated they destroyed crops, factories, railways, utility plants, and everything else that would be of value to the advancing Nazis. This was known as a “scorched earth” policy.\n\nGerman advance in the Soviet Union stopped\n\nBy the end of November the German assault on the Soviet Union had passed its peak of effectiveness. By December snow and cold weather had stopped the German offensive for the winter. The Soviets launched counteroffensives that drove the Germans back from the outskirts of Moscow and Leningrad.\n\nWhile Germany was attacking the Soviet Union, British armies in Egypt struck at the Axis forces in Libya. The attack drove the Axis from Benghazi on December 25, Christmas Day. The British, on orders from Churchill, then ceased pressing their advantage and sent many of their forces to Greece to oppose the German invasion there. The British were defeated in Greece and withdrew to the island of Crete, which was later captured by German paratroopers.\n\nJapan moves toward war\n\nThe German attack on the Soviets had led the Japanese to believe that German victory was certain. They immediately tried to profit by it. In July 1941 the Vichy government in France gave Japan bases in southern French Indochina. Japan moved in and massed troops against Thailand (Siam).\n\nOther aggressive moves by Japan brought strong protests from the United States and Britain. The Japanese declared that they wanted peace, but they continued their warlike acts. In late July the United States, Britain, and the refugee Dutch government in London placed embargoes on the shipment of oil to Japan.\n\nGeneral Tojo Hideki became premier of Japan in October. In November he sent a special envoy to seek peace with the United States. This was a trick to throw the United States off guard. Japan was playing for time in which to get its armed forces into position for attack, for the Japanese had already decided on war. Their lack of natural resources meant they had to win quickly or lose to the United States, whose potential power was overwhelming. Japanese leaders were also convinced that once the Americans were involved in the European war, they would be willing to negotiate a peace in the Pacific.\n\nOn November 26 American Secretary of State Cordell Hull announced that the United States would give full economic cooperation to Japan. In return, however, he asked that Japan withdraw from China and stop collaborating with the Axis. On December 6 President Roosevelt appealed directly to the Japanese emperor, Hirohito, to work for peace.\n\nThe attack on Pearl Harbor\n\nEarly the following afternoon the Japanese ambassador presented Japan’s reply to the American proposal. It accused the United States of standing in the way of the “new order in East Asia.” It ended by saying that further negotiations were useless. Even as he spoke Japanese forces were attacking Americans in Hawaii, in the Philippines, and elsewhere in the Pacific Ocean area.\n\nThe Japanese attacked Pearl Harbor, Hawaii, on Sunday, December 7, 1941. The attack came without warning very early in the morning. It was made by Japanese submarines and carrier-launched aircraft. The United States Navy and Army forces were completely surprised.\n\nMore than 2,300 Americans were killed in the two-hour attack. Eight battleships were sunk or damaged. Many cruisers and destroyers were hit. Most of the United States planes were destroyed on the ground. Japanese losses were 129 men, several submarines, and 29 of the more than 350 airplanes that had made the attack.\n\nDeclaration of war\n\nTwo and a half hours after the surprise attack at Pearl Harbor the Japanese officially declared war on the United States and Britain. Britain declared war on December 8. The United States Congress declared that a state of war had existed since December 7.\n\nOn December 9 China issued a formal war declaration against Japan, Germany, and Italy. On December 11 Germany and Italy declared war on the United States, and the United States Congress voted declarations in return. During the same week nine Latin American nations entered the war against the Axis powers—Costa Rica, Cuba, the Dominican Republic, El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, Haiti, Nicaragua, and Panama.\n\nBolivia declared war against Japan. Most other Latin American nations either broke off diplomatic relations with the Axis countries or supported the United States. Bulgaria, Hungary, and Romania declared war on the United States. Japan and the Soviet Union carefully avoided war with one another.\n\nOn January 1, 1942, the 26 nations then at war with the Axis powers joined in a declaration in which they pledged united efforts and no separate peace until victory was gained. Signed in Washington, D.C., this was called the Declaration by United Nations.\n\nThe War During 1942\n\nAt the beginning of 1942 the Allies were on the defensive in all the theaters of war. German submarine attacks continued to sink Allied ships and their cargo more quickly than the Allies could replace them. U-boat operations had spread from the area of the British Isles into the eastern Atlantic and then into the central and western Atlantic. This part of the war was called the battle of the Atlantic.\n\nIn the Pacific, Guam and Wake islands had fallen to the Japanese in December 1941. The Japanese had also taken Hong Kong from the British, and much of the American fleet lay in ruins at Pearl Harbor.\n\nBattle of the Atlantic Comes to the United States\n\nWith the entry of the United States into the war, German U-boats soon began operating off the coast of the United States. Although few in number they had great success, sinking Allied ships off the East coast from New York to Florida, off the Gulf coast, and in the Caribbean. Allied shipping losses were up to 10,000 tons a day and threatened the entire war effort. Not until a convoy system was implemented did the losses begin to decrease.\n\nJapanese Expansion\n\nThe Japanese continued to take new territory in the first half of 1942. In the Philippines there were heroic defensive stands by Filipinos and Americans at Bataan and Corregidor. But the Philippines fell in May. Also by May Singapore, the Dutch East Indies, Burma (Myanmar), and parts of New Britain and New Guinea were in Japanese hands. Australia was seriously threatened. Darwin in northern Australia was heavily bombed.\n\nAgainst all these advances American and British forces fought desperately. In Burma a small American volunteer group of fliers, the Flying Tigers, shot down hundreds of enemy planes. On April 18, 1942, a small group of carrier-launched Army aircraft bombed Tokyo. Although the attack accomplished little at the time, this was a preview of things to come for the Japanese.\n\nIn April the Pacific theater of operations was divided into the Southwest Pacific Area under United States General Douglas MacArthur and the Pacific Ocean Areas under United States Admiral Chester Nimitz. The Southwest Pacific Area included the Dutch East Indies (less Sumatra), the Philippines, Australia, the Bismarck Archipelago, and the Solomon Islands. The Pacific Ocean Areas comprised virtually every area not under MacArthur.\n\nBattle of Midway Island\n\nIn June a strong invasion force of Japanese moved directly against the Hawaiian Islands. American ships, Navy planes, and Army planes from Midway Island fought a four-day battle against the invaders. The Americans lost a carrier, a destroyer, and 150 planes. The invaders, however, were completely defeated. They lost four aircraft carriers, two heavy cruisers, three destroyers, and 330 planes. Meanwhile a Japanese force occupied several of the Aleutian Islands.\n\nThe battle of Midway ended serious Japanese expansion and is considered the turning point in the Pacific. Within two months Allied counterattacks began. United States Marines and Army forces attacked the Solomon Islands in August. A month later American and Australian forces started to drive the Japanese out of New Guinea.\n\nThe battle for Egypt\n\nIn the Mediterranean area the Axis forces had almost complete control of the sea. Supplies for the British forces in Egypt, the Near East, and India had to be shipped around Africa. In January 1942 the German general Erwin Rommel and his Afrika Korps started a new drive to seize the Suez Canal.\n\nAfter losing Benghazi in January the British held the Axis forces in check until May. Then a powerful attack engulfed most of the British tank force and moved into Egypt. In July the British were finally able to stop the drive at El Alamein.\n\nIn August General Bernard L. Montgomery was named field commander of British forces in Egypt. On October 23 the British started a devastating attack from El Alamein. Rommel’s tank force was routed. By November 6 the British had driven the Axis forces from Egypt. El Alamein is considered the turning point of the war in North Africa.\n\nNorth Africa invasion\n\nAmerican and British forces under the command of United States General Dwight D. Eisenhower landed in French North Africa on November 8, 1942. They captured the strategic points in Algeria and Morocco in a few days.\n\nThe Vichy government denounced the attack, and the Nazis occupied all France. French navy officers, however, kept the French fleet at Toulon from German use by scuttling it. The French in Africa soon ended all resistance.\n\nThe Russian Front in 1942\n\nBy the spring of 1942 the Soviet Union had regained one sixth of the territory it had lost in 1941. Then warm weather brought a new German assault. Sevastopol fell to the Germans in July. They also advanced to within 100 miles (160 kilometers) of the Caspian Sea and the important oil fields near the city of Baku. In August the Germans attacked Stalingrad (now Volgograd). The Red Army in Stalingrad was determined to fight to the last man. This bloody resistance stopped the German attack. This was the turning point of the war in Europe. In November the Soviets counterattacked and began to drive the Germans back.\n\nBurma and India\n\nBy May 1942 the British had withdrawn from Burma and focused on the defense of India. The Japanese had achieved their objective of cutting off supplies to the Chinese. The Allies continued to build up forces in India and look for ways to supply the Chinese. Lord Louis Mountbatten was appointed as Southeast Asian commander for the Allies.\n\nThe War During 1944\n\nIn February 1944 Admiral Nimitz’s forces advanced more than 2,000 miles (3,200 kilometers) from Hawaii to seize Kwajalein atoll and Enewetak in the Marshall Islands. The next advance was some 1,200 miles (1,900 kilometers) to the Marianas. By mid-August Saipan, Tinian, and Guam had fallen to the Allies. New, long-range Superfortress planes (B-29s) were used to bomb Japan. Plans were made to seize the Philippines as a base for the invasion of Japan.\n\nIn October General MacArthur’s forces invaded the Philippines at the island of Leyte. After savage fighting by land, sea, and air forces the conquest of Leyte was complete about Christmas Day 1944.\n\nIn China, Chiang Kai-shek’s forces continued to be on the defensive. A Japanese attack toward Changsha, begun on May 27, won control not only of a stretch of the Beijing-Hankou railroad but also of several of the airfields from which the Americans had been bombing the Japanese.\n\nSoviet advances\n\nThroughout the early months of 1944 the main pressure upon the Germans was caused by Soviet attacks. One drive carried the Soviet armies to the Baltic states by spring. In the southwest they also drove deep into Ukraine.\n\nOther drives neutralized Finland, took Minsk and Pinsk in Poland, and forced Romania to ask for peace. The Soviet Union also forced Romania to declare war on Germany on August 24. When the Soviets invaded Bulgaria in September that country also declared war on Germany. The Soviets next plunged into Yugoslavia to unite with Yugoslav partisan forces under Marshal Tito. The Yugoslav capital, Belgrade, was captured on October 20. The year ended on the Eastern Front with the Germans driven back to their own borders.\n\nThe Italian campaign\n\nIn late 1943, following a meeting in Tehran between Roosevelt, Churchill, and Stalin, General Eisenhower was named supreme Allied commander in western Europe. Britain’s General Alexander was made commander of the Allied forces in Italy.\n\nAn invasion force was landed at Anzio in January. Allied forces were pinned down on the beachhead, and by spring the attack looked hopeless. In May, however, a heavy attack broke through south of Cassino. The attackers joined the forces at Anzio and swept on to take Rome in June.\n\nThe Allies now invaded France, and the Italian campaign became a containing operation. Allied troop strength there was kept low, but the forces were charged with keeping German troops diverted from the main theater of war in France.\n\nThe Normandy invasion\n\nEarly on the morning of June 6 an invasion fleet of some 7,000 ships landed American, British, and Canadian divisions on Normandy beaches. Airborne divisions dropped behind the German lines. In the air Allies had complete command. This invasion was decisive and the outcome of the war in Europe depended upon its success.\n\nIn the first week the Allies established beachheads between Cherbourg and the city of Caen along a 60-mile- (97-kilometer-) wide strip. Within a week they drove about 20 miles (32 kilometers) inland. Casualties for the landing were about 15,000 out of some 150,000 engaged. The Germans never managed to mount a serious counterattack.\n\nThe British captured Caen on July 9. The Americans broke out of their beachhead positions on July 25. Armored columns headed inland, and Paris fell to the Allies on August 25. Victory seemed to be at hand, but soon the Allies outran their supply lines and German resistance increased.\n\nThe final German defense efforts\n\nThe Germans began to use new weapons against England: flying robotic bombs, called V-1s, launched from bases in France, and ballistic missiles, called V-2s, launched from the Netherlands. The V-bombs injured and killed many English civilians and caused great damage but had no effect on the outcome of the war (see guided missiles). East of the Rhine the Germans battled grimly to keep the Allies from entering Germany. In September, however, Allied troops crossed the German border east of Aachen.\n\nAs the cold, wet season advanced the Allied drive slowed down. Aided by the bad weather, the Germans launched a surprise counterattack on December 16. The main attack came south of Aachen in the Ardennes. The battle of the Bulge, as this attack was called, ended in final German defeat in this region. The year ended with the Allied forces in the west and east ready to throw their weight into the drive that would crush Nazi power.\n\nEurope and North Africa\n\nBattle of Poland; early stalemate\n\nOn September 1, 1939, the German Luftwaffe crossed the Polish frontier. Poland’s air force was destroyed on the ground. On the same day swift-moving German Panzer divisions smashed into Poland from three directions. The Polish army was the fifth largest in Europe. It was not equipped, however, to meet the up-to-date mechanized units of the Nazis. The Germans crushed organized opposition in 16 days. The Soviet Union attacked Poland from the east on September 17. Warsaw surrendered on September 27. From September 1, 1939, until May 10, 1940, there was no major action along the Western Front. French troops did not want to attack the strong German Siegfried Line. The Germans did not want to make an assault on the so-called “impregnable” French Maginot Line. Meanwhile the Russo-Finnish war (November 30, 1939–March 12, 1940) gave the Soviet Union important parts of Finnish territory.\n\nConquest of Norway; battle of Flanders\n\nOn April 9, 1940, the Nazis occupied Denmark without opposition. On the same day they attacked Norway. Landing airborne infantry, parachute troops, and amphibious forces at many points, the Germans gained a solid foothold the first day of the attack. A group of Norwegian traitors led by Maj. Vidkun Quisling assisted the invaders. British troops landed on April 15 to aid the Norwegian forces, but the swift German advance forced them to flee central Norway May 1–3 and evacuate Narvik on June 9. This ended Allied resistance in Norway.\n\nThe Germans started an offensive against France on May 10, 1940. To protect their right flank the Germans roared into the Netherlands and Belgium. The same day German forces, led by Erwin Rommel’s 7th Panzer Division, struck at the weak extension of the Maginot Line in the Ardennes Forest. Both attacks met quick success. Dutch resistance was crushed in four days, while to the south Nazi armored spearheads drove 220 miles (350 kilometers) to reach the French coast at Abbeville on May 21. The maneuver trapped the entire left wing of the Allied armies in a small pocket on the English Channel. Under heavy fire from German aircraft and artillery a hastily assembled fleet evacuated more than 360,000 Allied troops from Dunkirk to England between May 29 and June 4, 1940, leaving all their heavy equipment and artillery on the beach.\n\nBattle of France; battle of Britain\n\nThe defeat in the battle of Flanders left the French helpless to halt the next German blow. On June 5, 1940, the Germans attacked along a 100-mile (160-kilometer) front. One armored spearhead raced south along the French coast closing the Channel ports to possible British aid. In the center the Germans knifed through the Somme and Aisne river lines and smashed toward Paris from east and west. Another column turned to the left after breaking through at Sedan and took the Maginot Line from the flank and rear. Paris fell to the Germans on June 14, and the French asked for surrender terms on June 17. Meanwhile Italy declared war on France on June 10 but engaged in no major action.\n\nLate in 1940 Germany lost its first battle of the war when Britain fought off a savage air campaign. On August 8, 1940, Hitler launched the air assault on England to soften the British Isles for invasion and gain the necessary air superiority. Huge formations of German bombers crossed the English Channel almost daily to blast seaports, industrial cities, and airfields.\n\nDespite this steady rain of bombs the British stood firm. Possessing the most advanced radar system in the world, the RAF had early warning of the raids and was able to mount devastating counterattacks. By mid-September the RAF had demonstrated that the Luftwaffe could not dominate the skies over Britain. British fighters were shooting down German bombers faster than German industry could produce them. The Battle of Britain was thus won, and Hitler indefinitely postponed the invasion of England. The British had lost more than 900 fighters but had shot down about 1,700 German aircraft.\n\nDuring the following winter the Luftwaffe maintained a bombing offensive, carrying out night-bombing attacks on Britain’s industrial cities. The Blitz, as these raids came to be called, spread terror and destruction, especially in London, but had little military value. By February 1941 the offensive had declined, but in March and April there was a revival, and nearly 10,000 sorties were flown, with heavy attacks made on London. Thereafter German air operations over England withered.\n\nGerman drive through the Balkans; battle of the Atlantic\n\nOn April 6, 1941, the Nazi war machine drove into Yugoslavia and Greece to complete Hitler’s plans for the conquest of the Balkans and the domination of the Mediterranean. Yugoslavia was overrun by April 17. Greece surrendered on April 30. Of the 74,000 British troops in Greece only about 44,000 escaped. Many of these fled to Crete, which was a refueling stop and support base for the fighting in Greece. These troops were captured or killed when German airborne troops took that island between May 20 and June 1, 1941. Although the German campaign in the Balkans was successful, it delayed an invasion of the Soviet Union for several crucial months.\n\nEarly in the war Germany blockaded Europe by attacking Allied ships with land-based planes and submarines. The Allies struck back by convoying ships with destroyers and planes from escort carriers. They were helped immeasurably by the fact that the British had broken the top-secret German code “Enigma,” used to direct submarine operations, and by improvements in radar and sonar. These defenses brought the submarine and air attacks under control by 1942. The Germans also tried to use surface raiders to interfere with Allied shipping, but this threat ended with the sinking of the German battleship Bismarck in May 1941.\n\nBattles of El Alamein and Stalingrad\n\nItalian forces and Rommel’s Afrika Korps entered Egypt in a drive for the Suez Canal in June 1942. The British 8th Army held fast at El Alamein, about 60 miles (97 kilometers) southwest of Alexandria. On October 23 British infantry cut through the Axis lines in a bayonet charge that opened the way for an armored breakthrough. The attack forced the Axis back 1,300 miles (2,100 kilometers) across the desert.\n\nThe Germans attacked Stalingrad (now Volgograd) on August 24, 1942. The Soviets resisted street by street and house by house. Control of Stalingrad became a personal goal for both Stalin and Hitler. The powerful German 6th Army under General Friedrich von Paulus spent itself in a futile effort to dislodge the Soviet forces. The Soviets, led by Marshal Georgi Zhukov, counterattacked on November 19, and by February 2, 1943, they had killed or captured 330,000 Germans and other Axis soldiers in one of the costliest battles of the war.\n\nInvasion of North Africa; battle of Tunisia\n\nBritish and Americans troops landed at Algiers, Oran, and Casablanca in French North Africa on November 8, 1942. This was called Operation Torch. The invaders met little resistance and quickly drove inland. On November 15 the French in Africa joined the Allies.\n\nAmerican forces met their first defeat at the hands of the Germans in the battle of Kasserine Pass (February 14–25, 1943). They rallied, however, to push through Tunisia. On April 7 United States troops met the British 8th Army as it advanced from the east. The Allies forced 250,000 Germans and Italians to surrender near Cape Bon on May 12.\n\nBattle of Sicily; bombing of Ploesti\n\nOn July 10, 1943, the British and the Americans launched Operation Husky, the invasion of Sicily. The British 8th Army landed at Cape Passero, and the United States 7th Army led by General George S. Patton won a beachhead at Gela. The Americans cut through the center of the island and swept up the western coast while the British, under Montgomery, went up the eastern coast. The Americans ended the campaign by capturing Messina on August 17.\n\nOn August 1, 1943, 178 American B-24 (Liberator) bombers flew a 2,400-mile (3,900-kilometer) round trip from Libya to bomb Ploesti, Romania. The low-level attack did severe damage to the chief oil center of Hitler’s Europe, but the United States 9th Air Force lost 54 planes in the raid. A year later the Ploesti target was knocked out in a savage three-day assault that cost 2,277 American airmen and 270 planes.\n\nBattles of Salerno and Cassino\n\nThe British 8th Army invaded Italy at the toe of the boot on September 3, 1943 (Operation Avalanche). Six days later the American 5th Army landed at Salerno, south of Naples. For six days German armor attacked savagely, but naval gunfire and close air support helped the invaders to break out of the beachhead September 15. The next day they joined the 8th Army coming from the south. The capture of Naples on October 1 rounded out this campaign and opened the way for a bitter winter struggle at Monte Cassino.\n\nBy December 1943 the 5th Army advance in Italy was stopped at the Gustav Line based on Cassino. Despite bombardment by air and artillery the Germans clung to their defenses. On January 22, 1944, Allied troops landed behind the Gustav Line at Anzio but failed to break the stalemate. Finally, on May 18, the Allies overran Cassino. A week later the Cassino troops linked up with the Anzio forces. They then advanced 75 miles (120 kilometers) to take Rome on June 4.\n\nInvasion of Normandy; battle of the hedgerows\n\nThe long-awaited invasion of Europe from the west came in June 1944. For almost three years bombers had pounded the French and German coasts. Then on June 6, 1944—known as D-Day—the Allies stormed ashore at Normandy from a fleet of about 4,000 ships. This was called Operation Overlord. United States General Dwight D. Eisenhower was in overall command.\n\nFrom the Normandy beaches the Allies thrust inland. They faced stiff German resistance at every hedgerow. Relentless attacks slowly forced the Germans back. American infantry captured Cherbourg on June 27.\n\nBreakthrough at St.-Lô\n\nOn July 18, 1944, the United States 1st Army fought its way into St.-Lô where formidable German defenses blocked the advance. But after Allied planes delivered a crushing air bombardment, the 1st Army smashed through the German lines and broke out of the beachhead on July 25. Racing through the gap General Patton’s 3rd Army captured Avranches on July 31. Four days later a daring attack by American tanks cut off the Brittany Peninsula. Meanwhile on July 18 the British and Canadians crossed the Orne River at Caen and struck south.\n\nOn the left flank of the 3rd Army the XV Corps pushed east to capture Le Mans on August 9 and then moved north to Argentan. Meanwhile the Canadian 1st Army advanced south to Falaise. By August 17 these two Allied thrusts had trapped the German 7th Army in a pocket between Argentan and Falaise. Five days later the Allies had captured 100,000 prisoners and killed many others who tried to escape.\n\nCapture of Paris; invasion of southern France\n\nThe defeat of Falaise-Argentan broke the back of the German defenses in France. The 3rd Army then knifed across France. By August 20 the French capital was surrounded. The German garrison surrendered on August 25, and General de Gaulle and his Free French forces were able to enter the city without fighting.\n\nThe American 7th Army invaded southern France in Operation Anvil on August 15, 1944. American infantry divisions from Italy made the attack. They were aided by American paratroops and British and French units. Overcoming weak German defenses, the 7th Army raced up the Rhone Valley to join the 3rd Army near Dijon on September 11, 1944.\n\nBattle of Aachen\n\nAachen was the first large German city to be taken. On October 11, 1944, the veteran 1st Infantry Division of the United States 1st Army entered the outskirts of Aachen. The German defenders fought back savagely under Hitler’s order to resist to the last man. They were not driven out until October 21. The city lay in ruins. Meanwhile divisions of the 1st Allied Airborne Army had crossed the Rhine in the Nijmegen-Arnhem area on September 20 but were driven back five days later.\n\nBattle of the Bulge\n\nOn December 16, 1944, the Germans launched a furious counterattack in the Ardennes. Twenty-four German divisions drove a bulge 60 miles (97 kilometers) wide and 45 miles (72 kilometers) deep into the American lines. They had been able to achieve complete surprise due to bad weather, which grounded Allied planes, excellent deception measures, and the failure of Allied intelligence.\n\nThe heroic resistance of Allied units, however, finally halted the Germans. The United States 1st, 2nd, 4th, and 99th Infantry divisions held the shoulders of the bulge at Monschau and Echternach. Other brave stands were made at St. Vith by the 7th Armored Division and at Bastogne by the 101st Airborne Division and Combat Command B of the 10th Armored Division. On December 26 the 4th Armored Division relieved encircled Bastogne, ending the crisis. The 1st and 3rd armies eliminated the bulge during January. The Germans lost 220,000 soldiers and 1,400 tanks and assault guns. Allied casualties totaled 40,000.\n\nAttacking Germany from the air\n\nThe Allies had carried out a strategic bombing campaign against Germany. This had two goals: to destroy the German war industry and to break the morale of German civilians. When the Allies plunged into Germany they found firsthand evidence of the terrible destruction caused by the American and British saturation bombing raids. Industrial centers were crushed by a steady storm of bombs. Bridges were blown, railroad yards smashed, and harbors filled with the debris of sunken ships.\n\nMost of this destruction took place in the later stages of the war. Of the 2,697,473 tons of bombs dropped on Nazi-held Europe less than one fifth fell before 1944 and less than one third before July 1944. In these attacks Allied planners had picked their targets carefully. Of the entire bomb tonnage 32.1 percent was dropped on transportation targets and 9.3 percent on oil, chemical, and rubber centers. Other vital targets had included ball-bearing factories, optical factories, and aircraft and steel industries. Meanwhile the Luftwaffe had been all but swept from the skies by Allied fighter planes.\n\nCrossing the Rhine; the drive through Germany\n\nOn February 10, 1945, a long, grinding drive by U.S. forces through the Hürtgen Forest took dams on the upper Roer River and ended danger of flooding the troops below. The 1st Army attacked and reached the Rhine at Cologne on March 7. The same day the United States 9th Armored Division captured the Ludendorff bridge at Remagen intact. This action breached the last natural German defensive position. In the meantime Patton’s 3rd Army swept the Germans from the Saar and the Palatinate and unexpectedly crossed the Rhine near Oppenheim. By March 31 all seven Allied armies were advancing deep into Germany.\n\nAfter crossing the Rhine the Americans sprang a trap on the defending Germans. North of the Ruhr the 9th Army drove straight east while the 1st Army broke out of their Remagen bridgehead and struck east and north. The two columns joined at Paderborn on April 1, cutting off German forces in the Ruhr. While the 15th Army held the west face of the pocket along the Rhine, units from the 1st and 9th armies drove in to crush the Germans. They took more than 300,000 prisoners.\n\nThe Canadian 1st Army routed the Germans in the Netherlands, and the British, Americans, and French swept through Germany. On April 25 United States and Soviet forces met at Torgau on the Elbe River. This sealed the fate of Germany. Meanwhile the 3rd and 7th armies plunged into Czechoslovakia and Austria.\n\nFinal attack in Italy\n\nFighting their way northward the Allies won campaigns in the Rome-Arno region (January 22–September 9, 1944) and in the north Apennines (September 10, 1944–April 4, 1945). On April 9 they launched Operation Grapeshot, a mass assault designed to smash the Germans in northern Italy. The American 5th and the British 8th armies broke through German defenses and drove them across the Po River on April 23.\n\nThe Allies accepted the surrender of all German forces in Italy on April 29. The day before, Mussolini had been captured and killed by Italian partisans. Total Axis losses in Italy were 86,000 soldiers killed, 15,000 permanently disabled, and about 357,000 captured.\n\nFall of Berlin\n\nThe Soviet counteroffensive launched at Stalingrad slowly threw back the Germans along the entire front from Leningrad to Sevastopol. During the autumn of 1944 the crushing Soviet advance forced the Germans to withdraw from the Balkans. In January 1945 the Soviets pushed across the German frontier.\n\nOn April 21 the Red Army attacked Berlin. Here the Nazis offered their last bitter resistance, defending the city with all their dying strength. But on May 2 the Soviet forces completed the conquest of the burned and battered German capital in the final decisive action in the European theater. Hitler committed suicide on April 30, and German forces surrendered on May 7.\n\nThe Pacific and Far East\n\nTimes and dates for the Pacific theater of war are given as of the time zone where the action took place.\n\nThe attack on Pearl Harbor\n\nIn a surprise attack the Japanese struck at the United States Pacific Fleet at Pearl Harbor on December 7, 1941. The Japanese had used a similar surprise attack to start the Russo-Japanese War in 1904. The Japanese force was made up of some 350 planes from six carriers. Several submarines also joined in the two-hour attack. The attack, planned by Admiral Yamamoto Isoroku, commander of the Japanese navy, sank the battleships Arizona and Oklahoma and severely damaged six other battleships. Some 190 Army and Navy airplanes were destroyed on the ground. Japanese losses were 129 men, several submarines, and 29 planes. More than 2,300 Americans were killed. Fortunately for the Americans, none of their aircraft carriers was present, because carriers would change the way war was fought at sea.\n\nBattle of Wake Island\n\nThe Japanese immediately followed up the advantage gained with the success of Pearl Harbor. Their goal was to win the Pacific before the Allies could regroup. On December 8, 1941, the Japanese struck at Wake Island, a tiny American outpost 2,000 miles (3,200 kilometers) west of Honolulu, which was forced to surrender on December 23. Guam, the first American possession lost, had already fallen on December 11, 1941.\n\nMalaya and Singapore\n\nThe Japanese 25th army, under General Yamashita Tomoyuki, invaded Malaya on December 8, 1941, and overran the peninsula in an eight-week campaign. Their experience in jungle fighting and ability to make amphibious landings behind the British forces were key to their success. When the British battleship Prince of Wales and the battle cruiser Repulse tried to intercept Japanese troop convoys, Japanese aircraft sank them. This ended British naval efforts in the area.\n\nOn February 2, 1942, the Japanese attacked the British naval base on Singapore. The island was prepared to resist assault from the sea but not from the skies or the jungles in the rear. Singapore surrendered on February 15, exposing the East Indies and the Indian Ocean to the Japanese advance.\n\nSiege of Bataan\n\nJapanese forces under General Homma Masaharu landed on northern and southern Luzon in the Philippines during December 10–24, 1941. To avoid encirclement General MacArthur abandoned Manila and withdrew his troops to the rugged peninsula of Bataan on January 2, 1942. Here about 25,000 American and Filipino regulars and several thousand reservists held out until April 9. Then more than 35,000 exhausted defenders surrendered the peninsula. Later up to 10,000 of these prisoners died on an infamous “death march” to prison camps. United States General Jonathan M. Wainwright and others escaped to Corregidor and continued their delaying action there, but on May 6 the Japanese overran the island and captured an additional 15,000 Americans and Filipinos. In March President Roosevelt had ordered MacArthur to Australia to take over defenses there.\n\nBattle of the Coral Sea\n\nOn May 4–8, 1942, an American naval task force battled a Japanese invasion fleet in the Coral Sea, northeast of Australia. Surface ships did not exchange a shot. Action was confined to long-range attacks by carrier planes. American planes were based on the Lexington and the Yorktown. The Japanese withdrew on May 8. This was the first Japanese setback of the war. American losses included the Lexington, one destroyer, one tanker, 74 planes, and 543 men.\n\nThe decisive battle of Midway\n\nOn June 3–6, 1942, two American naval task forces and land-based planes from Midway Island intercepted 160 Japanese ships west of Midway. In a pitched air-sea battle the Japanese were repulsed, losing four carriers, two heavy cruisers, three destroyers, and 330 planes. This decisive defeat stopped the Japanese eastward advance in the Pacific. It is considered the turning point of the war in that theater. American losses included the carrier Yorktown, one destroyer, 150 planes, and 307 men.\n\nSolomon Islands campaign; battle of Papua\n\nOn August 7, 1942, the 1st Marine Division landed on Guadalcanal and seized Henderson Field. An additional Marine division and two Army divisions later reinforced them. After six months of bloody jungle warfare the Americans wiped out the last Japanese units on February 8, 1943. New Georgia was taken on August 6, 1943, by U.S. Army forces. Bougainville was invaded on November 1, 1943, by the Marines, later reinforced by three Army infantry divisions.\n\nIn a series of five naval engagements between August and November, the U.S. Navy protected the Solomon Islands from invasion. A large portion of the Japanese fleet was destroyed but at a heavy cost in American ships. In the battle of Savo Island (August 8–9), a Japanese night attack was repulsed, but the United States lost three cruisers. In the battle of the Eastern Solomons (August 23–25), American carrier planes forced the Japanese fleet to withdraw. The battle of Cape Esperance (October 11–12) was an American night attack that again drove off the Japanese. In the battle of Santa Cruz Island (October 26), American and Japanese carriers exchanged blows; two Japanese carriers were sunk and about 100 planes shot down at a cost of the U.S. carrier Hornet and 74 planes. In the battle of Guadalcanal (November 13–15), Japanese attacks were repulsed with heavy losses on both sides, including two American cruisers; another American cruiser was sunk two weeks later off Lunga Point.\n\nThe Japanese attack in New Guinea had carried to within 30 miles (48 kilometers) of the Allied base of Port Moresby by September 12, 1942. But American and Australian troops then drove the Japanese back over the Kokoda Trail through the Owen Stanley Mountains. Fighting in jungles and swamps, the Allies took Buna (December 14, 1942) and Sanananda (January 22, 1943) in Papua.\n\nBattle of the Aleutians; New Guinea campaign\n\nOn June 4–6, 1942, the Japanese occupied the Aleutian Islands in the farthest point of their drive toward Alaska. Almost a year later, on May 11, 1943, the United States 7th Infantry Division bypassed Kiska and stormed ashore on Attu. In bitter, hand-to-hand fighting they wiped out the entire Japanese garrison by May 31. Kiska was retaken without opposition on August 15, 1943.\n\nFrom June 1943 to July 1944 the United States 6th Army, led by General Walter Krueger, leapfrogged along the northern shore of New Guinea with amphibious, airborne, and overland attacks. This advance pushed 1,300 miles (2,100 kilometers) closer to Japan and bypassed 135,000 enemy troops.\n\nBattles of the Gilberts and Marshalls\n\nThe seizing of the Gilberts (Operation Galvanic) opened the American advance in the central Pacific. Marines invaded Tarawa on November 21, 1943, in the face of murderous crossfire from heavily fortified pillboxes. The island was conquered in four days at a cost of 913 Marine dead and 2,000 wounded.\n\nThe invasion of the Marshall Islands (Operation Flintlock) marked the first conquest of Japanese territory. Despite bitter enemy resistance the Marines took Namur, Roi, Kwajalein, and Enewetak between January 31 and February 22, 1944.\n\nBattle of the Marianas\n\nSupported by the United States 3rd Fleet, American ground troops assaulted the Mariana Islands. On June 15, 1944, Army and Marine divisions invaded Saipan. The Japanese resisted savagely with machine guns, small arms, and light mortars emplaced in caves and concrete pillboxes. The last desperate banzai charge was smashed on July 7 and all organized opposition ceased two days later.\n\nArmy and Marine divisions landed on Guam on July 21 and overran the island by August 10. Tinian was taken by the Marines (July 24–August 1). On November 24, 1944, B-29 Superfortresses delivered their first major strike against Japan from bases on Guam and Saipan.\n\nBattle of the Philippine Sea\n\nThe United States invasion of Saipan provoked the Japanese navy to counterattack, but the resulting battle of the Philippine Sea effectively eliminated Japanese carrier power. On June 19, American planes from 15 carriers of Task Force 58 destroyed 402 Japanese aircraft. Four United States ships suffered minor damage and 17 planes were lost. The following day American carrier planes located the Japanese fleet farther to the west. They destroyed about 300 more Japanese planes and sank two carriers, two destroyers, and one tanker and crippled 11 other vessels. Japanese antiaircraft fire and fighter planes shot down 16 American aircraft.\n\nBattles of Burma, the Palaus\n\nThe 1942 Japanese conquest of Burma cut the Allied ground route to China. It ran by rail from Rangoon to Lashio and then over the Burma Road to Kunming. In the fall of 1943 the Allies launched Operation Capital to reopen a road into China.\n\nAdvancing from Assam, India, two American-trained Chinese divisions drove down the Hukawng Valley in northern Burma during October 1943. Behind the attacking Chinese, American engineers blasted out the new Ledo Road. Merrill’s Marauders, a specially selected American combat team landed by parachutes and gliders, reinforced the Chinese in February 1944. A similar British force, known as Chindits or Wingate’s Raiders, protected the southern flank of the advance. On August 3, 1944, the veteran Allied jungle fighters captured Myitkyina. They cleared the way to Mongyu by January 1945.\n\nOn September 15, 1944, U.S. Marines secured a beachhead on Peleliu Island in the Palau group. Army units reinforced the Marines on September 22. Japanese forces held out until mid-October.\n\nBattle of China\n\nThe Japanese attack on China, begun in 1937, was intensified late in 1944 in an effort to wipe out forward bases of the United States 14th Air Force. From September 8 to November 26, 1944, the Japanese overran seven large air bases.\n\nLess than a month later enemy columns had split unoccupied China, opening up a Japanese-dominated route from Malaya north to Korea. In the spring of 1945 the Chinese began a counteroffensive that regained much of the territory lost the previous year. Important elements in this drive were 35 divisions that United States General Joseph Stilwell had helped to train and equip. Air support was provided by the 14th Air Force, based at Kunming, and the 10th Air Force, brought from India to Luichow.\n\nBattles of Leyte and Leyte Gulf\n\nThe United States 6th Army invaded the east coast of Leyte on October 20, 1944. Enemy resistance ended on December 26, 1944, but mopping-up operations continued for many weeks. Japanese naval forces challenged the Leyte landings in a series of three engagements on October 23–26, 1944. The United States 3rd and 7th fleets and a task force led by Admiral Marc A. Mitscher defeated the Japanese in all three engagements. Japan no longer had an effective navy. By this time, U.S. submarines had also effectively blockaded the home islands.\n\nBattle of Luzon\n\nOn January 9, 1945, General Krueger’s 6th Army landed at Lingayen Gulf. The 8th Army, led by General Robert L. Eichelberger, landed at Subic Bay on January 29 and at Batangas two days later. These attacks trapped the Japanese in a giant pincers, but they fought back fiercely in Manila, at Balete Pass, and in the Cagayan Valley.\n\nOrganized Japanese resistance ended on June 28, but large pockets of the enemy held out for many months. American prisoners were freed at Santo Tomás, Cabanatuan, Los Baños, and Baguio.\n\nBattles of Iwo Jima and Okinawa\n\nU.S. Marines invaded Iwo Jima on February 19, 1945. It was conquered after desperate fighting on March 16. United States losses were 4,189 killed, 15,308 wounded, and 441 missing. Japanese losses were 22,000 killed and captured.\n\nGeneral Simon Buckner’s 10th Army landed along the western coast of Okinawa on April 1, 1945. This Army-Marine force fought for 79 days, during which time they advanced only 14 miles (23 kilometers). Enemy resistance finally ended on June 21. Japanese losses were 109,629 killed and 7,871 captured. American casualties totaled 39,000, including 10,000 naval personnel of the supporting 5th Fleet. This fleet had been attacked by Japanese kamikaze planes. Twenty-six American ships were sunk and 168 were damaged.\n\nAtomic bombs hit Japan\n\nDuring July 1945, B-29 Superfortresses from the Marianas flew 1,200 sorties a week against the Japanese homeland. Other planes flew from recently captured Okinawa and Iwo Jima to join in the aerial assault. Meanwhile the 3rd Fleet sailed boldly into Japanese coastal waters and hammered targets with its guns and planes. The American intent was to make the Japanese believe that a general invasion was imminent.\n\nThe assault never happened. Fanatical Japanese resistance on Luzon, Iwo Jima, and Okinawa convinced American military planners that an invasion of the Japanese homeland would result in hundreds of thousands of Allied and Japanese casualties. To avoid these enormous losses, another, more devastating, means was found to end the war. On August 6 a B-29 named Enola Gay dropped an atomic bomb on Hiroshima, at the southern end of Honshu. The explosion vaporized everything in the immediate vicinity, completely burned about 4.4 square miles (11.4 square kilometers) of the city, and killed between 70,000 and 80,000 people. About 70,000 more were wounded. With an American victory seemingly assured, the Soviet Union declared war on Japan two days later.\n\nThe Japanese still would not surrender. On August 9 a second atomic bomb was dropped, this time on Nagasaki. It killed about 40,000 people and injured a similar number. The next day Hirohito, the Japanese emperor, ordered his government to ask for peace. Japan agreed to the terms of surrender on August 15 (the 14th in the United States), which is remembered as V-J (Victory over Japan) Day. The formal surrender was signed on September 2.\n\nThe Peace Treaties\n\nDelegates from 21 member countries of the United Nations met in Paris on July 29, 1946, to draft treaties with Italy, Hungary, Bulgaria, Romania, and Finland. Representatives of the United States, Britain, the Soviet Union, and France signed the treaties in Paris on February 10, 1947. Each treaty provided that border fortifications were to be limited to those needed to keep internal security. Guarantees were given against racial discrimination and the rebirth of fascist governments. The Balkan treaties provided for free navigation of the Danube.\n\nThe treaty with Italy\n\nTerritorial: Loss of colonies in Africa (Eritrea, Somaliland, and Libya); final disposition to be decided by the United States, Britain, the Soviet Union, and France within a year, with the possibility of United Nations control. The port of Trieste to be internationalized under United Nations control. The city of Fiume, most of the peninsula of Venezia Giulia, the commune of Zara, and the islands of Lagosta and Pelagosa ceded to Yugoslavia; the Dodecanese Islands to Greece, the Tenda and Briga valleys, and other small frontier areas, to France. Italy recognized the independence of Albania and Ethiopia.\n\nReparations: 360 million dollars: 100 million to the Soviet Union, 125 million to Yugoslavia, 105 million to Greece, 25 million to Ethiopia, 5 million to Albania.\n\nArmaments: Combined strength of army, navy, air force, and police, 300,000 personnel. Allowed 200 tanks, 67,500 tons of warships, 200 fighter planes, and 150 noncombat planes; long-range artillery and aircraft carriers prohibited. Warships in excess of the 67,500-ton limitation to be distributed among the United States, Britain, the Soviet Union, and France.\n\nThe treaty with Bulgaria\n\nTerritorial: Parts of Macedonia and Thrace returned to Yugoslavia and Greece.\n\nReparations: 45 million dollars to Greece, 25 million to Yugoslavia.\n\nArmaments: Army, navy, and air force limited to 65,500 personnel. Allowed 7,250 tons of warships, 70 combat planes, 20 noncombat planes.\n\nThe treaty with Hungary\n\nTerritorial: 1938 frontiers reestablished; restoration of part of Slovakia to Czechoslovakia, Ruthenia to the Soviet Union, Transylvania to Romania, and territory taken from Yugoslavia in 1941.\n\nReparations: 200 million dollars to the Soviet Union, 50 million to Yugoslavia, 50 million to Czechoslovakia.\n\nArmaments: Army and air force limited to 70,000 personnel. Allowed 70 combat planes, 20 noncombat planes.\n\nThe treaty with Romania\n\nTerritorial: Southern Dobruja given to Bulgaria, northern Bucovina and Bessarabia given to the Soviet Union.\n\nReparations: 300 million dollars to the Soviet Union.\n\nArmaments: Army, navy, and air force limited to 138,000 personnel. Allowed 15,000 tons of warships, 100 combat planes, and 50 noncombat planes.\n\nThe treaty with Finland\n\nTerritorial: Petsamo, Salla, and Karelia ceded to the Soviet Union; Porkkala Peninsula leased to the Soviet Union for 50 years; Aland Islands demilitarized.\n\nReparations: 300 million dollars to the Soviet Union.\n\nArmaments: Army, navy, and air force limited to 41,900 personnel. Allowed 10,000 tons of warships and 60 planes.\n\nThe problem of Germany\n\nAt Potsdam in 1945 Allied leaders set up a temporary administration for Germany. The country was divided into American, British, French, and Soviet occupation zones. The American, British, and French zones together made up the western two thirds of Germany, while the Soviet zone comprised the eastern third. Control of Berlin, in the Soviet zone, was divided between the Soviet Union and the Western powers. Later, in 1961, the city would be physically partitioned by a concrete and barbed-wire wall.\n\nThe victors were determined that Germany should not regain the industrial strength necessary for war. Wiping out all German industry, however, would have been disastrous. Western Europe depended on Germany for coal and heavy metal products. In return Germany normally bought huge quantities of foodstuffs from its neighbors.\n\nThe Allied powers also had to settle on a form of German government. The United States and Britain favored a federal type, with most matters entrusted to German states (Länder) and a federal government to deal with national matters such as currency. The Soviet Union preferred a strong central government with political parties directly represented so that Communists could dominate. France wanted a very loose federation, with international control of the Ruhr.\n\nRepresentatives of the four powers convened in Moscow in 1947 to discuss treaties for Germany and Austria. Because of the postwar weakness of Britain and France, the conference was chiefly a contest between the United States and the Soviet Union.\n\nThe Soviet Union demanded 10 billion dollars in reparations from Germany in 20 years. The United States rejected this proposal on the grounds that the money could be made available only if the United States supplied an equivalent sum to support the Germans. If the reparations were to be paid without such support, it would greatly hamper Germany’s economic recovery. The conference ended with no agreement. Later meetings also failed. Then, in June 1948, the Soviet Union blockaded the roads and railways to Berlin in an attempt to force the United States, Britain, and France out of the city.\n\nThe Western powers responded by supplying western Berlin with food, fuel, and medicine from outside by air. This airlift kept life going in western Berlin for 11 months, until the Soviet Union lifted the blockade in May 1949. In that same month the Western powers organized their occupation zones into a new nation called the Federal Republic of Germany, commonly known as West Germany. The Soviet Union then established its zone as the German Democratic Republic, or East Germany. When the Soviet Union continued to block a German peace treaty the United States in 1952 ratified a “peace contract” with West Germany. Germany would not be reunited as a nation until 1990.\n\nThe problems of Austria and Trieste\n\nThe postwar split between the Soviet Union and the West was also illustrated in Austria. After the war Austria was divided into four areas of occupation—American, British, French, and Soviet—with Vienna under the control of all four powers. In 1955, after repeated disagreements about terms, a peace treaty was signed in Vienna. Soviet and Allied occupation forces were withdrawn.\n\nAnother postwar trouble spot in Europe was Trieste. In 1945 the city and surrounding territory were divided into two zones—Zone A (including Trieste) was occupied by British and United States forces, Zone B by the Yugoslavs. The Italian peace treaty of 1947 established the Free Territory of Trieste under the jurisdiction of the United Nations. Conflicts between Yugoslavia and Italy over their claims to the territory continued, however. In an agreement signed by the two countries in 1954, Trieste and most of Zone A were given to Italy while Yugoslavia received Zone B and some added territory.\n\nMeanwhile the increased threat of Communism in Europe led to the formation of new pacts among the free nations. In 1949 ten nations of western Europe joined with the United States and Canada in establishing the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO). Three years later the European Defense Community was founded. This group received NATO support. (See also Cold War.)\n\nPostwar problems in Asia\n\nIn the East Asia Communist military aggression created a new balance of power before the World War II peace treaty with Japan could be signed. On the Asia mainland Chinese Communist forces routed the armies of Nationalist China (1946–49). Mao Zedong, the Chinese Communist leader, proclaimed the People’s Republic of China and allied it with the Soviet Union. This made China the strongest military power in the Far East. The defeated Nationalist forces, headed by Chiang Kai-shek, fled to the island of Taiwan.\n\nThe successful Communist revolution in China set the pattern for Communist revolts in other Asian countries. In what would become Malaysia and in the Philippines rebels waged campaigns of terrorism that lasted for a number of years. In Indochina Communist forces attacked French-supported Vietnam. They forced the French to partition Vietnam.\n\nAfter World War II Korea was occupied in the north by the Soviet Union and in the south by the United States. When the Republic of Korea was established in the south, most of the United States forces withdrew. In 1950 Communist forces from North Korea and China invaded the new republic. Thus the increasing tensions in eastern Asia had finally exploded into warfare.\n\nPeace treaty with Japan\n\nJapan struggled to rebuild itself after its crushing defeat. During this time all efforts by the Allies to frame a peace treaty were blocked by the Soviet Union’s disagreements with the United States. Finally, in 1951, the United States sponsored a treaty that was endorsed by Japan and 48 other nations. The Soviet Union refused to sign. The Chinese signatory—the Nationalist government—signed in 1952. The chief provisions of the peace treaty were as follows:\n\nTerritorial: The independence of Korea was to be recognized; all claims to Taiwan, the Pescadores, the southern part of Sakhalin, and the Pacific islands that were formerly under Japanese mandate were to be surrendered.\n\nReparations: Because of limited economic capacity Japan was made to pay victimized nations only in goods manufactured in Japan from raw materials supplied by those nations.\n\nArmaments: No limitations. Japan, however, agreed to abide by the antiaggression provisions contained in the charter of the United Nations. In addition, Article Nine of the new Japanese constitution prohibited all warfare except in defense. Negotiations between Japan and the Soviet Union continued until 1956, when a peace treaty was finally signed.\n\nDirect cost of the two World Wars Country World War I to 19191 World War II to V-J Day United States and Allied Powers United States $27,729,000,000 $317,600,000,000 Soviet Union (Russia) 22,593,950,000 192,000,000,0002 British Empire Great Britain 44,029,012,000 120,000,000,000 Canada 1,665,576,000 15,680,000,000 Australia 1,437,419,000 6,500,000,000 New Zealand 378,750,000 165,000,000 South Africa 300,000,000 3 India 601,279,000 2,145,000,0004 France 25,812,783,000 97,940,000,000 Belgium 1,154,467,000 3,250,000,000 Serbia 399,400,000 see Yugoslavia below Yugoslavia see Serbia above 220,000,000 Greece 27,000,000 220,000,000 China 3 3 Italy 12,313,998,000 Axis (see below) Japan 40,000,000 Axis (see below) Romania 1,600,000,000 Axis (see below) Netherlands not engaged 1,000,000,000 Norway not engaged 93,000,000 Poland not a nation 2,000,000,000 Czechoslovakia not a nation 1,500,000,000 South American nations not engaged 9,278,000,000 Total $140,325,634,000 $676,079,400,000 Germany and Associated Powers Germany $37,775,000,000 $272,900,000,000 Austria-Hungary 20,622,960,000 3 Bulgaria 815,000,000 3 Italy Allied (see above) 94,000,000,000 Japan Allied (see above) 56,000,000,000 Romania Allied (see above) 3 Turkey 1,430,000,000 not engaged Total $60,642,960,000 $422,900,000,000 Grand Total $200,968,594,000 $1,192,491,000,000\n\n1Congressional Record, April 14, 1932. 2Russia estimated cost at $485,000,000,000. 3No authoritative figures available. 4Through 1943 only."
