        "text": "China has vowed to build a high-speed railway network that spans across Southeast Asia, and if successful, travelling between Yunnan and Singapore will take a mere 10 hours. The construction of a high-speed rail linking Kunming, China and Vientiane, Laos, commenced in 2011 and is scheduled to be completed in five years. According to China Railway Corp, the construction of the Kunming-Singapore line will be broken down into four stages. Apart from the Kunming-Vientiane and the Vientiane-Bangkok sections, the other stages include Bangkok to Kuala Lumpur, and Kuala Lumpur to Singapore.\n\nhttp://www.themalaymailonline.com\n\nShare on:"
