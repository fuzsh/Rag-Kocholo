        "text": "Re: Indonesia. Jakarta – Semarang – Surabaya is currently the fastest route, having been upgraded in 2014. The “Argo Anggrek” limited-stop trains that you mentioned have a top speed of not more than 120 km/h so averaging 81 km/h isn’t bad for the route. Just 2 years ago the mainline was largely single-tracked and most trains took 12 or 13 hours from Jakarta to Surabaya. The current 8.5 hour time was a big improvement. The other main line from Jakarta to Yogyakarta and Surakarta is slower.\n\nThere is little freight on this line during the day; heavy freight between provinces can go by ship and low labor costs keep trucking cheap, though there are plans to encourage more freight rail service.\n\nMuch of the route is straight and all of it is very flat, suggesting the potential to upgrade max speeds to 200 km/hr with moderate amount of investment in the existing tracks. These three cities are the national capital and the capital cities of Central and East Java provinces (the 5th and 2nd largest cities), and all are urbanizing rapidly. Trip times of 2 hr 30 min (averaging 140 kmh) from Jakarta to Semarang would be faster than flying and operations would be profitable at least. The Semarang to Surabaya route could get down to 2 hours easily, again beating flying on the route. It would take a new, high-speed alignment to get the Jakarta to Surabaya time down under 4.5 hours (potentially to as little as 2.5 hours at 280 kmh average with a new 700 km alignment).\n\nIndonesia lacks a plan for a full high speed rail route from Jakarta to Surabaya. But Japan and China have both offered loans to construct a 150 km high speed rail route from Jakarta to Bandung, the capital city of West Java. President Jokowi announced that a decision would be made soon; I have seen an estimated price of $US 4.4 to 5.5 Billion, or $US 35 to 45 million per kilometer: http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2015/08/14/japan-leaves-out-state-funding-match-china-s-high-speed-rail-proposal.html\n\nThe current rail route twists through the mountains north of Bandung and takes 3.5 hour to go those 150 km. Even the trip on the new toll expressway takes 2 hours 15 minutes without traffic per Google (and there is always traffic getting out of or into Jakarta); a high speed train should be successful, especially since Bandung is the provincial capital for all the growing suburban (but densely populated) cities south and east of Jakarta. Bandung has a city population of 2.5 million and the metro are is 7.5 million; central Jakarta has 11 million inhabitants with 30 million in the greater metro area.\n\nThe relatively low income of Indonesia will lead to lower HSR ridership than comparable Western cities. Today GDP per capita of $3500 is half that of China (though twice as high as India), and the median household income is $4000 per year. On the other hand, the top 20% of households make $8000 per year or more, and the top 10% is over $20,000; millions of people in Jakarta are at these levels where flights and high speed rail are worth the time savings over cheap buses.\n\nI haven’t found figure for domestic flights, but Jakarta (JKT) has 62 million passengers a year total, Surabaya airport gets 30 million passengers a year including International flights, Semarang 3.3 million/year (mainly domestic), But with 4 to 5% a year GDP growth and even faster urbanization, Indonesia will have increasing demand for intercity travel. China and Japan are both betting that they can drum up future business by offering a good deal for this first line. http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2015/08/22/race-indonesia-s-high-speed-railway-part-a-big-game.html\n\nExcuse me if this is slightly off-topic:\n\nReminds me of my first tramp around Asia 36 years ago. I caught the train from Singapore up the west coast of Malaysia, via KL to Butterworth where I stopped for a few days (ie. to visit Georgetown-Penang). Because the train to Bangkok only went every 3 or 4 days and my timing didn’t match, I shared a taxi with a French couple (who convinced me to accompany them to the then barely-known Koh Samui; this was amazingly reminiscent of the opening scenes of DiCaprio’s movie The Beach!) across the border which includes passing thru the “no man’s land” or DMZ of the restless Muslim area of southern Thailand (whom some think may be responsible for the temple bombing in Bangkok last week). It is safe on the train but there is a slight frisson driving thru it because there were occasional holdups! One could catch up with the train at the next Thai town. This was probably because it stopped for many hours (maybe even a day?) and not just because the train was so slow. One gets off the train at Surat Thani at midnight to catch the midnight ferry across to Koh Samui (which didn’t have an airport back then).\n\nI also took the train from Bangkok to Chiang Mai and back. The train stops at both of the ancient ruined cities of Sukhothai and Ayutthaya. I still vividly remember getting off the train right at dawn and walking into the city ruins.\n\nThese trains may be slow but they are a terrific experience, certainly compared to bus or car, or air.\n\nI have long wanted to do the Saigon/HCMCity to Hanoi train journey. But it was to be part of a bigger journey that included Hanoi to Kunming (then into the heart of Yunnan, Dali, LiJiang & Zhongdian then into Sichuan eventually looping back to either Shanghai or HK). The original 1910 French-built railway up the mountains has long been closed but the Chinese claimed to have a plan to rebuild it. …. Ok, I just checked and the Kunming-Mengzi–Hekou railway opened in Dec 2014 (or was due to)! Hekou is on the VN border next to the famous hilltown resort Lào Cai on the VN side. Max speed 120 kph. Apparently some heroic engineering to remove the steep grades of the original line. I think the Chinese will be doing deals with the Vietnamese to upgrade the line from Lào Cai to Hanoi to the port at Haiphong.\n\nHmm. I might make this part of my next trip to Europe. Singapore to Paris. by train. (There’s only one little segment thru Laos that needs a bus.) Of course the Trans-Siberian from China; this too has a low average speed but considering the extreme winters, the semi-marshland quasi-permafrost and sheer distance, it is remarkable it exists at all. I did the west-east journey about 15 years ago."
