The SKRL is a\n\nflagship project of the ASEAN-Mekong Basin\n\nDevelopment Cooperation (AMBDC).\n\nTowards Seamless Regional Rail Transport\n\nAn SKRL feasibility study examining six\n\nalternative routes to link Singapore to Kunming,\n\nChina, was completed in August 1999. All six\n\nroutes have a common sector from Singapore\n\nto Bangkok via Kuala Lumpur.\n\nProposed SKRL Route Alternatives\n\nStudy\n\nRoute\n\nCost\n\n(US$ bn)\n\nLength\n\n(km)\n\nMissing\n\nLinks\n\nCountries\n\nInvolved\n\n1 1.8 5,382 431\n\nCambodia,\n\nLao PDR,\n\nViet Nam\n\n2 6.0 4,559 1,127\n\nMyanmar,\n\nThailand,\n\nChina\n\n3 1.1 4,259 531\n\nLao PDR,\n\nChina\n\n4 5.7 4,164 1,300\n\nLao PDR,\n\nChina\n\n5 1.1 4,481 616\n\nLao PDR, Viet\n\nNam, Thailand\n\n6 1.1 4,225 589 Lao PDR, Viet\n\nNam, Thailand\n\nRoute 1 which connects Cambodia, Lao PDR,\n\nViet Nam and China, was selected by the\n\nASEAN Transport Ministers for its high social\n\nand economic impact. It will cost an estimated\n\nUS$1.8 billion to construct. Its 5,382 km length\n\nincludes the missing links from Poipet to\n\nSisophon, and from Phnom Penh to Loc Ninh\n\nand Ho Chi Minh City, as well as the spur lines\n\nfrom Ho Chi Minh City to Vung Tau and from\n\nVientiane to Vung Anh. Routes 2 to 6 will be\n\nconsidered for implementation in national rail\n\nplans or other railway network projects, such\n\nas the Trans-Asian Railway.\n\nLatest Developments\n\nThe SKRL project has seen steady progress:\n\nâ¢ Cambodiaâs construction of the missing\n\nlinks, guided by the Inter-Ministerial\n\nCommittee for SKRL, is on schedule.\n\nâ¢ Viet Nam completed a feasibility study on\n\nthe Ho Chi Minh CityâLoc Ninh missing link\n\nand is negotiating with Cambodia for the\n\nlocation of rail connection points. A\n\nfeasibility study for a spur link from Vung\n\nAng to Tan Ap-Mu Gia for further linking\n\nwith Vientiane is also being undertaken.\n\nâ¢ In December 2006, the ADB approved a\n\nUS$60 million loan to Viet Nam to assist in\n\nthe rehabilitation of the HanoiâLao Cai\n\nsection and a US$42 million loan to\n\nCambodia to assist in the rehabilitation of\n\nCambodia railways that include sections of\n\nthe SKRL route. The ADB is also\n\nundertaking a detailed design study on the\n\nPhnom PenhâLoc Ninh sector with\n\nfinancing from China.\n\nâ¢ China has made progress on the Chinese\n\nsectors of the SKRL, including the Yuxi-\n\nHekou route (Eastern portion), the Yuxi-\n\nMohan (Middle portion) and the Dali-Ruili\n\n(Western portion). Construction of the Yuxi-\n\nMengzi railway is scheduled to be\n\ncompleted in 2009. The feasibility study of\n\nthe Dali-Ruili railway has been completed.\n\nâ¢ The Republic of Korea has completed a\n\nUS$1.2 million feasibility study on the\n\nSKRL portion linking Bangkok to Yangon.â\n\nFor more information on the Singapore-Kunming\n\nRail Link project, contact Mr. Gary Krishnan\n\n(garykrishnan@aseansec.org) of the Bureau for\n\nExternal Relations & Coordination of the ASEAN\n\nSecretariat.\n\nPlease visit www.aseansec.org for more information"
