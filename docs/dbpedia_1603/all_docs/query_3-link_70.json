You take an intercity train from HK to Guangzhou, the overnight sleeper train from Guangzhou to Nanning, a connecting train to Pinxiang then a bus to the border and on the Hanoi. For details of how to do this, see the Train travel in Vietnam page.\n\nBeijing ► Lhasa (Tibet) ► Kathmandu (Nepal)\n\nThere's no railway from Tibet through the Himalayas to Nepal, at least not yet, but the Lhasa to Kathmandu journey can be done using various 7-day organised bus tours.\n\nWeekly Lhasa-Kathmandu bus service? The internet is full of reports of a Lhasa to Kathmandu bus service starting, then being withdrawn, then starting again. However, the most reliable information suggests that there is currently NO such bus, as all attempts to keep it going have so far failed. So if you want to travel from Lhasa to Kathmandu, you'll need to sign up to one of the organised tours, see below.\n\nOrganised tours between Tibet & Nepal: Currently, the only way foreigners are legally permitted to travel between Lhasa & Kathmandu is with an organised tour. The cheapest tours take 8 days (7 nights) for the 955 km journey and cost about $400. Try www.heiantreks.com, who normally run Lhasa-Kathmandu overland tours twice a week, www.trekkingtibet.com (recommended by one seat61 correspondent), www.visitnepal.com/getaway (weekly, $450) or www.richatours.com or do a Google search for other agencies. In 2005, there were reports of a new twice-weekly bus service from Kathmandu to Lhasa but apparently this service folded soon after it started. If you have any feedback or recommendations, please email me!\n\nFor onward travel from Kathmandu to Delhi or Varanasi in India by a combination of bus & train, see the Nepal page.\n\nBeijing ► India\n\nThe direct route from China to India is not particularly practical. Most if not all border crossings are officially closed to foreigners, and you need some serious permits to be in those border regions. You can, however, go from Beijing to Lhasa in Tibet by train (see here), then take regular organised tours from Lhasa to Kathmandu, see the Nepal page. You can then get by regular scheduled bus and train to Delhi or Varanasi in India, also see the Nepal page.\n\nBeijing ► Bangkok (Thailand), Kuala Lumpur (Malaysia) and Singapore\n\nStart by taking the twice-weekly Beijing to Hanoi train, details on the Vietnam page. You can then either go to Saigon and across Cambodia to Bangkok, then by train to Malaysia and Singapore, or take a 24 hour bus ride from Hanoi to Vientiane in Laos, then by overnight train to Bangkok. See this interactive route map and click each part of the route you want for details.\n\nBack to top\n\nFerries from China to Japan\n\nThere were two ferry companies each sailing weekly year-round from Shanghai to either Kobe or Osaka in Japan. However, in 2021 the Shanghai Ferry Co. ceased trading and sold its vessel to its competitor, www.shinganjin.com. Feedback if you use this ferry is appreciated!\n\nJapan-China International Ferry Company\n\nThe Japan-China International Ferry Company, www.shinganjin.com, sails weekly from Shanghai to Japan, going alternately to Kobe or Osaka.\n\nImportant update 2024: This ferry has been suspended since the pandemic, but they hope to resume in September 2024 with a new ship.\n\n* Ship sails to Osaka & Kobe alternately, see www.shinganjin.com for fares & schedules, for English, change JP to EN top right.\n\nFares start at 20,000 Japanese Yen or RMB 1,300 (£140 or $195) one way for a berth in a shared Japanese-style room accommodating 8-15 passengers or 25,000 Yen / RMB 1,600 for a berth in a western-style 4-berth cabin. There's a 10% discount for students, children 6-11 half fare. A range of cabins is available on board, with restaurants, cafe, etc.\n\nYou can book via their online application form less than 2 months but no less than 7 days before departure at www.shinganjin.com.\n\nAlternatively, for sailings from China, the telephone number for the Shanghai branch is +86 2165 957 988. There is someone who can speak English and the only information you need to give is your name, date of birth, class of travel and passport number. They will then make a reservation and you can buy the ticket at the port. The telephone number for people travelling from Japan to China is +81 3 5489 4800. This is their Tokyo branch, as unfortunately nobody can speak English at their Osaka office.\n\nThe following photos show the former Shanghai Ferry Co vessel, now sold to the Japan-China International Ferry Co.\n\nTraveller's reports\n\nTraveller Mark Cundall used the Japan-China International Ferry Company: \"The ship was first class, clean and absolutely no problem. If anyone wants to get from China to Japan, I'd recommend this company. One key point is that when you get dropped in Osaka you need a bus to get to the metro, costing 300 yen, although there are no money exchange facilities at the port. Also, all vending machines on the ship use Japanese yen, although Chinese RMB are accepted in the gift shop, cafe and so on. So change some money into yen before you board the ship!\"\n\nTrain travel within Japan\n\nFor information about train travel in Japan, see the Japan page.

It's location is perfect, it's just a few minutes walk along the main road to Tiananmen Square and the entrance to the Forbidden City, 3 minutes walk from Wanfujing Metro Station. Service is excellent and the colonial-style rooms spacious. An excellent and extensive breakfast buffet is served in the modern extension behind the main building. The hotel was originally Block B of the Beijing Hotel, Block C next door dating from 1954 is now the Beijing Grand Hotel and Block D dating from 1974 retains the name Beijing Hotel and is a state-run hotel. There's more on the history of this hotel at en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beijing_Hotel. Tip: The hotel's rooms are both in the original 1917 block and the modern block behind, ask for a room in the original 1917 building.\n\nA cheaper option, still with good reviews and location, try the Pentahotel Beijing. It's informal, comfortable, and walking distance from Beijing Railway station - although a taxi is better if you've luggage. There's a bar and noodle bar downstairs.\n\nIn Shanghai\n\nThe Fairmont Peace Hotel is the place if you want 5-star comfort as well as history & grandeur, it starts at around 190 for a double. It's right in the centre of the Bund in a building dating from 1929. As the Cathay Hotel, pre-1949 it was regarded as Shanghai's most prestigious hotel, see en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peace_Hotel.\n\nBack to top\n\nTours of China by train\n\nTrain travel specialists Railbookers offer several tours of China by train, with hotels, tours, train tickets organised for you as a package. They can also arrange flights if you need them. Check out their Beijing to Shanghai and China's History & Panda Trail itineraries.\n\nIn the UK call 0207 864 4600, www.railbookers.co.uk.\n\nIn the USA call free 1-888-829-4775, www.railbookers.com.\n\nIn Canada call free 1-855-882-2910, www.railbookers.com.\n\nIn Australia call toll-free 1300 971 526, www.railbookers.com.au.\n\nIn New Zealand call toll-free 0800 000 554 or see website.\n\nBack to top\n\nFlights to China\n\nOverland travel around China by train is an essential part of the experience, so once there, don't cheat and fly, stay on the ground! But if a long-haul flight is unavoidable to reach China in the first place, try Virgin Atlantic who fly direct from London to Beijing, Shanghai or Hong Kong, a sound choice for both price and service.\n\n1) Check flight prices at Opodo, www.opodo.com\n\n2) Use Skyscanner to compare flight prices & routes worldwide across 600 airlines.\n\n3) Lounge passes\n\nMake the airport experience a little more bearable with a VIP lounge pass, it's not as expensive as you think, see www.loungepass.com\n\nBack to top\n\nI strongly recommend investing in a decent guidebook. It may seem an unnecessary expense, but it's a tiny fraction of what you're spending on your whole trip. You will see so much more, and know so much more about what you're looking at, if you have a decent guidebook. For independent travel I'd recommend either the Lonely Planet or the Rough Guide, both provide an excellent level of practical information and historical and political background. You definitely won't regret buying one! Seat61 gets a small commission if you buy through these links.\n\nBuy at Amazon.co.uk or Amazon.com\n\nAlternatively, you can download just the chapters you need in .PDF format from the Lonely Planet Website, from around £2.99 or US$4.95 a chapter.\n\nBack to top\n\nTravel insurance & other tips\n\nAlways take out travel insurance\n\nNever travel overseas without travel insurance from a reliable insurer, with at least £1m or preferably £5m medical cover. It should also cover cancellation and loss of cash and belongings, up to a sensible limit. An annual multi-trip policy is usually cheaper than several single-trip policies even for just 2 or 3 trips a year, I have an annual policy with Staysure.co.uk myself. Here are some suggested insurers. Seat61 gets a small commission if you buy through these links.\n\nwww.staysure.co.uk offers enhanced Covid-19 protection & gets 4.7 out of 5 on Trustpilot.\n\nwww.columbusdirect.com is also a well-know brand.\n\nIf you live in the USA try Travel Guard USA.\n\nGet an eSIM with mobile data package\n\nDon't rely on WiFi, download an eSIM with a mobile data package for the country you're visiting and stay connected. Most newer mobile phones can download a virtual SIM card so you don't need to buy a physical SIM, including iPhone 11 & later, see device compatibility list. Maya.net is a reliable eSIM data retailer with a 4.5 out of 5 Trustpilot rating and a range of packages including unlimited data.\n\nGet a Curve card for foreign travel\n\nMost banks give you a poor exchange rate, then add a foreign transaction fee on top. A Curve MasterCard means no foreign transaction fees and gives you the mid-market exchange rate, at least up to a certain limit, £500 per month at time of writing. The money you spend on your Curve card goes straight onto one of your existing debit or credit cards.\n\nHow it works: 1. Download the Curve app for iPhone or Android. 2. Enter your details & they'll send you a Curve MasterCard - they send to the UK and most European addresses. 3. Link your existing credit & debit cards to the app, you can link up to two cards with the free version of Curve, I link my normal debit card and my normal credit card. 4. Now use the Curve MasterCard to buy things online or in person or take cash from ATMs, exactly like a normal MasterCard. Curve does the currency conversion and puts the balance in your own currency onto whichever debit or credit card is currently selected in the Curve app. You can even change your mind about which card it goes onto, within 14 days of the transaction.\n\nI have a Curve Blue card myself, it means I can buy a coffee on a foreign station on a card without being stung by fees and lousy exchange rates, just by tapping the Curve card on their card reader. The money goes through Curve to my normal debit card and is taken directly from my account (in fact I have the Curve card set up as payment card on Apple Pay on my iPhone, so can double-click my phone, let it do Face ID then tap the reader with the phone - even easier than digging a card out). I get a little commission if you sign up to Curve, but I recommend it here because I think it's great. See details, download the app and get a Curve card, they'll give you £5 cashback through that link.\n\nGet a VPN for safe browsing. Why you need a VPN\n\nWhen you're travelling you often use free WiFi in public places which may not be secure. A VPN encrypts your connection so it's always secure, even on unsecured WiFi. It also means you can select the geographic location of the IP address you browse with, to get around geoblocking which a surprising number of websites apply. See VPNs & why you need one explained. ExpressVPN is a best buy with a 4.7 out of 5 Trustpilot ranking which I use myself - I've signed up as an ExpressVPN affiliate, and if you go with expressvpn.com using the links on this page, you should see a special deal, 3 months free with an annual subscription. I get a small commission to help support this site.\n\nCarry an Anker powerbank\n\nTickets, reservations, vaccination records and Interrail or Eurail passes are often held digitally on your mobile phone, so it's vital to keep it charged. I always carry an Anker powerbank which can recharge my phone several times over if I can't get to a power outlet. Buy from Amazon.co.uk or from buy from Amazon.com."
