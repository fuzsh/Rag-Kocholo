The Singapore-Kunming Rail Link (SKRL)

project was proposed at the Fifth ASEAN

Summit in December 1995. The SKRL is a

flagship project of the ASEAN-Mekong Basin

Development Cooperation (AMBDC).

Towards Seamless Regional Rail Transport

An SKRL feasibility study examining six

alternative routes to link Singapore to Kunming,

China, was completed in August 1999. All six

routes have a common sector from Singapore

to Bangkok via Kuala Lumpur.

Route 1 which connects Cambodia, Lao PDR,

Viet Nam and China, was selected by the

ASEAN Transport Ministers for its high social

and economic impact. It will cost an estimated

US$1.8 billion to construct. Its 5,382 km length

includes the missing links from Poipet to

Sisophon, and from Phnom Penh to Loc Ninh

and Ho Chi Minh City, as well as the spur lines

from Ho Chi Minh City to Vung Tau and from

Vientiane to Vung Anh. Routes 2 to 6 will be

considered for implementation in national rail

plans or other railway network projects, such

as the Trans-Asian Railway.

Latest Developments

The SKRL project has seen steady progress:

â¢ Cambodiaâs construction of the missing

links, guided by the Inter-Ministerial

Committee for SKRL, is on schedule.

â¢ Viet Nam completed a feasibility study on

the Ho Chi Minh CityâLoc Ninh missing link

and is negotiating with Cambodia for the

location of rail connection points. A

feasibility study for a spur link from Vung

Ang to Tan Ap-Mu Gia for further linking

with Vientiane is also being undertaken.

â¢ In December 2006, the ADB approved a

US$60 million loan to Viet Nam to assist in

the rehabilitation of the HanoiâLao Cai

section and a US$42 million loan to

Cambodia to assist in the rehabilitation of

Cambodia railways that include sections of

the SKRL route. The ADB is also

undertaking a detailed design study on the

Phnom PenhâLoc Ninh sector with

financing from China.

â¢ China has made progress on the Chinese

sectors of the SKRL, including the Yuxi-

Hekou route (Eastern portion), the Yuxi-

Mohan (Middle portion) and the Dali-Ruili

(Western portion). Construction of the Yuxi-

Mengzi railway is scheduled to be

completed in 2009. The feasibility study of

the Dali-Ruili railway has been completed.

â¢ The Republic of Korea has completed a

US$1.2 million feasibility study on the

SKRL portion linking Bangkok to Yangon.â
