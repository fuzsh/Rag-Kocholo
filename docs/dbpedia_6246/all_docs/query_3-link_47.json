        "text": "A previously unreported motion illusion is described. Oblique lines that drift smoothly on the retina in a vertical direction appear to be displaced laterally. The effect occurs both for moving lines under fixation and for stationary lines under ocular tracking of an external target. Orientation, length, and homogeneity of the obliques affect the magnitude of illusory displacement. We propose that this illusion is associated with a misregistration of the direction of displacement occurring, in lines slanted relative to the axis of their motion, because of the aperture problem.\n\nThe motion of objects that are both translating and rotating can be decomposed into an infinite number of translational and rotational combinations. How, then, do such stimuli routinely elicit specific percepts and behavioral responses that are usually appropriate? A possible answer is that motion percepts are fully determined by the probability distributions of all the possible correspondences and differences in the stimulus sequence. To test the merits of this conceptual framework, we investigated the perceived motion elicited by a line that is both translating and rotating behind an aperture. When stimuli are presented such that a particular sequence of appearance and disappearance occurs at the aperture boundary, subjects report that the line is rotating only; furthermore, the perceived centers of rotation appear to describe a cycloidal trajectory, even when one aperture shape is replaced by another. These and other perceptual effects elicited by translating and rotating stimuli..."
