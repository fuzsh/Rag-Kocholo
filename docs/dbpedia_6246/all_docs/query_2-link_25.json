        "text": "Blurb:\n\nNot good enough for heaven but not bad enough to burn, Kylie has a slight problem. She’s dead and trapped between the realms.\n\nLeft with no options, she follows Detective Liam Stone on the hunt for her killer. Death has left Kylie invisible but does nothing to dampen her desire for the sexy detective. Instead, it gives her the freedom to do as she pleases with his body, and what a delicious body it is.\n\nLiam’s determined to solve Kylie’s case but as the clues uncover an underground world of demonic torture and pacts, Liam must face his own secrets or the flames of passion won’t be the only ones the couple will have to face.\n\nInside Scoop: Parts of this tale are graphically violent, but other parts might leave you drooling for a ghost or a demon of your own. Look out for the brief but hot F/F scenes in the bedroom and the shower.\n\nA Romantica® horror erotic romance from Ellora’s Cave\n\n~\n\nExcerpt:\n\nShe died on this corner. It seemed strange it would be right here where she caught the bus each morning and evening. She couldn’t recall why she had been there at that exact time but it didn’t change the outcome. She was dead.\n\nShe had been brought up to believe things would be different when this day came. There would be light, trumpets…peace. Kylie had none of those things. Instead, she stood looking down at her lifeless body in shock. Maybe this is what happens when you’re murdered. That thought lingered on the outer rim of her disbelief.\n\n“At least my nails still look good,” she said tilting her head to get a better look at the rounded pink tips she’d gotten done the day before. At her statement, the man hovering over her empty shell lifted her hand from the ground and inspected her nails.\n\n“It doesn’t look as if she tried to defend herself.”\n\nNo shit Sherlock, she thought with a roll of her eyes. She craned her neck attempting to get a better look at the man’s face. He was big and rugged looking, as if he hadn’t shaved in at least a week. The beginnings of a dark beard covered his chin but in a harsh contrast to his dark hair, his eyes were a light blue almost exactly the same shade as the sky. He was a sexy one she realized with a pang of regret for the life she had lost.\n\n“Thank God I wore my good panties.”\n\nHe lifted her skirt. “Underwear’s still in place. She doesn’t appear to have been raped.”\n\n“Put that down you dirty little bastard. Sheesh! Who is this guy?” He dropped the material and smoothed it down over her knees. It was a sad day when a girl ended up murdered on a street corner and couldn’t even hold onto her modesty afterward. Damn, why hadn’t someone as sexy as him wanted to check out her girly bits while she’d still been able to enjoy it? Typical.\n\n~\n\nAuthor bios:\n\nCharity Parkerson is an award winning and multi-published author with Ellora’s Cave Publishing, Midnight Books, and Punk & Sissy Publications.

Why is there such an interest in these contests? Because deep down, everyone has a story to tell —a memoir, romance, science fiction tale of other worlds or alternate civilizations, or even a how-to manual—everyone has a story. I am no different except for the fact that I don’t have the time to do NaNo or SYTYCW.\n\nWhat I do have time for is researching different trends and changes that affect my clients. Lots of research, lots of reading and lots of time assimilating that information into bite-size morsels for my clients and followers. Some of this information I have included in a book that I have coming out January 13, 2014.\n\nYou are probably thinking “Why would I care that you are publishing a book?” The answer is simple, maybe you won’t care, but if you are considering jumping into the indie world of publishing you should care. Now you probably are thinking “Who are you?” Me, I am just someone who grew up surrounded by those in the publishing industry, I have done work for authors and publishers directly —everything from just transcribing manuscripts to promotion to the formatting of digital e-books. I read voraciously, I review sporadically and I host two podcasts about authors, reading, writing and publishing.\n\nYeah, I know a little something about e-publishing in today’s world but I don’t pretend to have all the answers and I won’t try to come off as a know it all like some of those people that state their opinion as fact. In short, I am not a stuffed-shirt, puffed up with my own self-importance. BUT, chances are if you are or have ever thought about publishing something independently and read something about it, or are on Twitter you have seen some of my handy-work.\n\nSo, if you are serious about publishing your own work, or just kicking the idea around, be on the look out for my book, Navigating The World Of E-Book Publishing, available January 13, exclusively on Amazon. My contact methods are below, feel free to stalk me that way or even join my mailing list for a special announcement and sale opportunities.\n\nWho I Am\n\nE-BookBuilders is the online alias of Deena Rae. I was born and raised in Texas — home of bluebonnets, boots, beef and big hair — into a family that was in the printing and publishing industries. My father was a computer programmer for major newspapers when the equipment took up whole rooms and my mother has been a publisher for almost 30 years — trying, unsuccessfully, to bring me into the family business. I have been told I am a second-generation genetically perfected super-nerd.\n\nI was happily living my life, having three third-generation genetically perfected super-nerds myself, but then through a series of events (unfortunate and fortunate), I officially joined The Book Connection — my mother’s publishing and packaging company — as the Digital Director, to create the e-publishing division in 2011. My computer skills, willingness to help authors, love of literature, no-nonsense attitude and quick wit has helped shepherd many authors through the maze of digital publishing.\n\nThrough my work with E-BookBuilders, I have been able to meet authors and writers from all over the world and in every genre imaginable. My wit, obscure sense of humor, awareness of the absurd, and a love of literature all which led to the creation of Bluebonnets, Bagpipes and Books, the NSFW publishing discussion podcast I produce and host with Janet Wrenn and Peter Burnett. My no-nonsense attitude makes for some hilarious discussions and plenty of “Oh my God, did she really just say that?” moments. Sometimes it is as if there is no filter between my brain and mouth. But if I like you I try to be nice — sometimes. I also have a safe-for-everyone author interview show, B3‘s Bookworm. You can find me most hours of everyday attached to my computer either researching, tweeting on the 6 accounts I maintain, posting on my different Facebook timelines and pages, coding e-books for my fabulous friends/clients or with my nose buried in my Kindle reading.\n\nSo, if you are serious about publishing your own work, or just kicking the idea around, be on the look out for my book, Navigating the World of E-Book Publishing, available January 13, exclusively on Amazon. My contact methods are below, feel free to stalk me that way or even join my mailing list for a special announcement and sale opportunites.\n\nIf you would like to add the book to your Goodread’s shelf – just click the button!"
