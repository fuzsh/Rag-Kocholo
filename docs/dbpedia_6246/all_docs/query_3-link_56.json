CONCLUSIONS\n\nResistive and laser ignition methods were tested with ADN based propellants. No clear ignition was observed with both methods. On the other hand, previous studies conducted at FOI demonstrated the possibility to ignite an ADN based propellant through resistive heating [4] and thermally, by injecting it in a preheated chamber [10].\n\nTherefore, even if ignition was not observed with the configurations used, further tests on thermal ignition should conducted.\n\n.\n\n________________________________________________________________________\n\n.\n\nAug 13 2016\n\nSpeaking about that ECAPS not has achieved the performance objectives.\n\n(See http://sscspace.com/$2/file/1606-interim-report-english.pdf )\n\n.\n\nCheck the link https://directory.eoportal.org/web/eoportal/satellite-missions/s/skysat\n\n.\n\nScroll until the heading Propulsion subsystems for the SkySat constellation (about the last third part) appears.\n\n.\n\nA variety of images with (image credit: ECAPS / SSC) become visible.\n\n.\n\nIn the text just above https://directory.eoportal.org/web/eoportal/satellite-missions/s/skysat#mission-status you will see the next launch opportunities and the image:\n\n.\n\n.\n\nSubcontractors to both NanoSpace and ECAPS do malfunction, according to the results report.\n\n.\n\nOne wonders what it is that really malfunctions?!\n\n.\n\n________________________________________________________________________\n\n.\n\nManager, Technical Programs at ECAPS Inc.\n\nhttps://www.linkedin.com/pub/shea-ferring/10/183/274\n\nShea Ferring is the Manager of Technical Programs at ECAPS Inc., helping deliver a game changing High Performance Green Propulsion (HPGP) system to the industry.

Development of a cold-start capable ignition system to replace hydrazine in the whole operational area.\n\n3. Verification of the technology within thruster demonstrator(s) to reach a Technology Readiness Level of 5.\n\n4.

The Aerospace Engineering department of the FHWN will investigate new, advanced propellants for the space industry and design, manufacture and test new propulsion systems. The project will run for three years.\n\nThe FHWN cooperates with following partners:\n\no Airbus\n\no CNRS\n\no DLR (consortium lead), Germany\n\no ECAPS, Sweden\n\no FOI, Sweden\n\no FOTEC, Austria\n\no Lithoz, Austria\n\no University of Poitiers, France\n\nPublications\n\nReplacement of Hydrazine: Overview and First Results of the H2020 Project Rheform (pdf)\n\nECAPS has been awarded a contract by Skybox to supply 12 complete HPGP propulsion system modules for the SkySat constellation. The HPGP modules are to be delivered in 2015 and 2016.\n\nThe HPGP systems are manufactured by ECAPS in Sweden, but the propulsion systems use tanks from ATK, valves from Moog and thrust chambers from Plasma Processes.\n\nTherefore, the flagship of Europe will be based on components that are manufactured in the US and restricted under the export control laws of International Traffic in Arms Regulations (ITAR) or the Export Administration Regulations (EAR).\n\nGoals\n\nThe goal of Rheform is the replacement of hydrazine by ADN-based liquid propellants for orbital and launcher propulsion systems.\n\nThe two baseline propellants for the project are LMP-103S and FLP-106.\n\nAs mentioned in section 2, these propellants require a combustion chamber made of special materials that are currently ITAR restricted.\n\nIn the project, new propellants compositions will be developed and tested aiming at reducing the combustion temperature such that ITAR-free materials can be used for catalysts and combustion chambers.\n\nAnother focus of the project is to improve the cold start capabilities and thus reduce the need for pre-heating of the system. In order to achieve these goals two different paths will be followed.\n\nOn one side the catalytic ignition system will be improved. On the other side thermal ignition systems will experimentally be assessed. Here conventional systems,\n\nsuch as torch igniters, as well as advanced systems, such as laser ignition systems, will be considered. If necessary a combination of catalytic and thermal ignition will be considered.\n\nThe propellant blend and ignition method will be verified with one or two demonstrator(s), equivalent to a TRL of 5.\n\nIn the project existing numerical models will be adapted to describe the processes in the propulsion system. Possibilities for the optimization of the production process of ADN will be studied as well in order to reduce the cost of producing this fuel.\n\n——————————————————————————————————————-\n\n.\n\n30 jun 2016\n\n.\n\nNo new comments on sscspace,com about the launch of Skysat?!

Other Operational Limitations\n\n.\n\nBoth green propellants have operational restrictions that do not exist for hydrazine propulsion systems.\n\n.\n\nThe main operational restriction for both systems, is that the thruster must be preheated.\n\n.\n\nThere is no cold start capability for either type of thruster.\n\n.\n\nThis is a significant restriction, since a common contingency requirement for hydrazine thrusters is to be able to detumble a spacecraft when it comes off the launch vehicle, and the thrusters often cannot be preheated to meet this requirement.\n\n…….\n\nBut became all commanded HPGP ”thrust-pulses” on Prisma-Mango, performed as ”thrust”?\n\nIn published Prisma-Mango, HPGP reports, has nothing about ”sticky” HPGP valves been noted?\n\nThe Swedish nuclear power plant operator, ”Vattenfall”, admit that they have problems with valves sticking, see:\n\nExamine material problems related to valves sticking in nuclear power plants – 2012-01-17 – Text in Swedish\n\n.\n\n________________________________________________________________________\n\n.\n\nMay 15, 2015\n\n.\n\nTwo new patent applications from ECAPS have recently been published by the US patent authorities\n\n.\n\nSo called hard starts, and the relatively high preheat energy (time and power) for water based monopropellant is no success when one wants to persuade NASA to leave hydrazine as their standard monopropellant fuel\n\n.\n\nUnited States Patent Application-20150121843 (pdf published May 7, 2015 )\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\nUnited States Patent Application-20150128563 (pdf published May 14, 2015 )\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n________________________________________________________________________\n\n.\n\n.\n\nFound a patent application from ECAPS published November 13, 2013, Publication No. WO2013169193 A1\n\n.\n\n.\n\nBACKGROUND ART\n\n.\n\nThe present inventors have found that, when operating a thruster as described in WO 02/095207 in certain pulse modes, hard starts are encountered. A hard start implies an overpressure condition during the ignition of the propellant in the thruster. In the worst cases, this takes the form of an explosion. A single hard start is obviously detrimental to the engine, and in worst case even fatal. The problem of hard starts has been observed for thrusters of 5N, 22 N and 200 N when operating the thruster on a liquid, ADN-based monopropellant.\n\n.\n\nDETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION\n\n.\n\nThe present inventors have established that the hard starts observed during pulsed mode firing are due to undue cooling of the heat bed. Hard starts have been observed in the medium to high duty region in combination with relatively short pulses, such e.g. a duty factor of at least about 5%, and a duration of the pulse of from about 100 ms to a few seconds. Duty factor, given as a percentage, is defined herein as 100 * Ton / (Ton + Toff)\n\n.\n\nBefore firing the thruster, the reactor is pre-heated to a sufficient temperature, typically 300°C to 400°C (depending on bed load and specific monopropellant). The reaction will start already with a heat bed temperature above 200°C, but in order to obtain a nominal start 350°C is preferred. During a long pulse or steady state firing, heat generated in the catalytic bed and in the combustion chamber will be sufficient to continuously heat monopropellant being injected into the thruster, so that the monopropellant is essentially in the gaseous state when entering the catalyst bed. If liquid phase monopropellant enters the catalyst bed, disintegration of the porous catalyst bodies may result due to the high vapour pressure formed within the porous bodies when exposed to heat from the combustion downstream. Also, a hard start will typically occur when liquid phase monopropellant fills a significant part of the heat bed due to ignition delay.\n\n.\n\nDuring pulsed mode firing, depending on the specific duty, and the duration of the pulses, the heat generated in the catalyst bed and in the combustion chamber may not be transferred fast enough to reheat the heat bed, resulting in the heat bed being cooled down to a temperature well below the required pre-heating temperature. For example, for a 22 N thruster hard starts tend to occur at a duty of at least about 10% and a duration of the pulse of from about 100 ms to a few seconds. Pulsed mode firing is also typically associated with a higher bed load, i.e. a larger mass of propellant flowing through a given cross section of the catalytic bed per unit of time, than e.g. during steady state firing.\n\n.\n\nThe present inventors have found the problem of hard starts during pulsed mode firings to be even more pronounced with the newly developed monopropellants described in WO 2012/166046, such as e.g. the monopropellant designated 1127-3, having a lower energy content and higher cooling effect than e.g. LMP-103S. (More water in the admixture than LMP-103S / uppsagd)\n\n.\n\n——————————————————————————————————————-\n\n——————————————————————————————————————-——————————————————————————————————————-\n\nRead first this document: Green Propellants Based on Ammonium Dinitramide (ADN)\n\nwritten by: Anders Larsson and Niklas Wingborg FOI – Swedish Defence Research Agency, Sweden\n\n——————————————————————————————————————-\n\nSpeaking of FOI, Wingborg, ADN, patent & ECAPS\n\n.\n\nFrom FTFs journal ”Bevingad” (translate: ”Winged”) 2006-3\n\n.\n\nGoogle translate:\n\nToday’s satellites and spacecraft are powered by liquid propellant hydrazine.\n\nHydrazine is however highly toxic, volatile, corrosive and carcinogenic. The handling of hydrazine is therefore very costly.\n\n.\n\n1997 turned SSC to FOI to inquire about possible alternatives to hydrazine.\n\n.\n\nFOI then suggested that salt ADN dissolved in a water-fuel mixture could be a\n\nsuitable replacement.\n\n.\n\nFOI helped SSC with documentation for a project proposal to seek funding from ESA and the following year could the experimental work started at FOI.\n\n——————————————————————————————————————-\n\n.\n\nSpeaking of ADN, please see AmmoniumDiNitramide_News_Oct_2004_EURENCO\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\nAmmonium Dinitramide, ADN, is a strong oxidizer and an explosive. It is an ionic compound with the formula, NH4+ N(NO2)2-.\n\nThe existence of stable dinitramides was first published in 1991 in two patent applications filed by the US Research stablishment, SRI.\n\nThe anion, N (NO2)2-, was then named dinitramide for the first time. However, it is indisputable that a large effort on synthesizing and using ADN was done in the Soviet Union.\n\nDue to its high strategic military impact it was never published until SRI published the patents and Soviet Union was no longer.\n\nIt was not until FOI in 1996 invented a new onestep process for making ADN that things started to happen. With this efficient method EURENCO Bofors could start a pilot production the year after.\n\n.\n\n——————————————————————————————————————\n\n.\n\n.\n\nDecember 2014\n\n.\n\nAccording to information from the PRISMA project of OHB-Sweden, the inspection phase of the Picard experiment was cancelled.\n\n.\n\nDuring the rendezvous phase in August 2014, there was a problem with one of the propulsion systems on PRISMA and the PRISMA project couldn’t catch the opportunity to execute the inspection before the fly-by of Picard.

Kapen November 16, 2014\n\n.\n\nHow did a startup succeed in creating a real-time Google-Earth? Skybox Imaging CEO Tom Ingersoll asked the audience, “Have you looked at your house on Google Earth? Disappointed it was two years old?”\n\n.\n\nBecause satellites are so expensive to build and launch, most of the pictures that we see are of poor quality and years out of date. Until now. Skybox knew that real-time satellite imaging would require dozens of satellites, a prohibitively expensive endeavor with the cost of a single satellite being around $850 million. So Skybox needed to find a way to build satellites for a fraction of that, and created a lightweight, nimble satellite in-house for about $10 million.\n\n.\n\nIngersoll insisted that the key to Skybox’s success is in execution, and evoked the line mostly attributed to Thomas Edison (also a favorite of Steve Jobs): “Vision without execution is hallucination”. Ingersoll said that another key to Skybox’s success is that it has had a patient board of directors, which enabled Skybox to say “no” to Google twice, before finally agreeing to be acquired earlier this year.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n——————————————————————————————————————\n\n.\n\n.\n\n10 jun 2014\n\n.\n\nAccording to the web, Google is willing to pay $ 500 million for Skybox Imaging.\n\n.\n\n.\n\nI.e. Tom Ingersoll didn´t succeed get financing without ”help” of Google!\n\n.\n\nI wonder if Google knows what they are buying? See excerpts from the WSJ:\n\n.\n\nThe Skybox acquisition adds to several airborne Google initiatives. For one of those, Google is spending more than $1 billion to put hundreds of satellites in orbit to extend Internet access, people familiar with the matter said recently.\n\n.\n\nSkybox’s satellites are unlikely to replace Google’s internal satellite initiative because it would be difficult to change the Skybox design to add Internet connectivity to its image-collection capabilities, according to Mr. Farrar of TMF.\n\n.\n\nBut he said Skybox’s knowhow would be useful on the Google project, since both involve small, light satellites that don’t need much power and can carry Internet-related or image-collection equipment.\n\n.\n\nAfter launching its first satellite, Skybox is ramping up production of more satellites and exploring low-cost launch options, Mr. Farrar said.\n\n.\n\n……………………………………….\n\n.\n\nAt Skybox website they say among other things following:\n\n.\n\nWe should point out that our agreement with Google, which is subject to customary approvals and closing conditions, hasn’t closed yet. So in the short term, it will continue to be business as usual at Skybox.\n\n.\n\n——————————————————————————————————————\n\n.\n\n.\n\nTechcrunch June 2, 2014\n\n.\n\n.\n\nWe wrote the other day about Google’s interest in SkyBox for better mapping data, and when you think about this and the latest developments on Google eyeing up ways of developing broadband access via satellites, it speaks to the breadth of possibilities of where Google could go here.\n\n.\n\n.\n\nSpaceNews May 26, 2014\n\n.\n\n.\n\nWhat appealed to Ingersoll was the company’s grand vision. Skybox’s founders, who conceived the idea as graduate students at Stanford University, planned to raise hundreds of million of dollars, build satellites in-house and write their own imaging processing algorithms.\n\n.\n\n“At the time, I had opportunities to join other startups that were less risky but also less exciting,” Ingersoll said. “There are not many businesses that could have such an important impact on the way we see the world and the way we make resource allocation decisions. Skybox is going to be transformational.”\n\n.\n\nBefore joining Skybox, Ingersoll co-founded Universal Space Network, a global firm specializing in spacecraft telemetry, tracking and control that was acquired in 2009 by Swedish Space Corp. Ingersoll also served as a senior manager at McDonnell Douglas Corp.’s Phantom Works before the organization known for developing advanced military technology was acquired in 1997 by Boeing Co. Ingersoll spoke recently with SpaceNews correspondent Debra Werner.\n\n.\n\n.\n\nTechcrunch May 23, 2014\n\n.\n\n.\n\n(See below: “Think of that June date as a kind of deadline for Skybox,” one source told us. “Either for an exit, or getting that financing round in place.”)\n\n.\n\nWe’ve heard from two different sources that the company, which has raised $91 million to date from a number of investors that include Khosla Ventures and Bessemer Venture Partners (disclosure: CrunchFund, founded by TechCrunch founder Michael Arrington, is also an investor), will need to raise more money soon if it doesn’t make an exit.\n\nThat’s because building and launching satellites — even the small satellites that Skybox bases its business around — is a pricey game, with the cost to make one device potentially running into the millions, without operational and launch costs for that bird factored in. (Relatively speaking, these are small numbers in the satellite industry, with the types of devices made by the likes of BlackBridge, Skybox and Planet Labs often referred to as “low cost”.)\n\nJP Morgan is among the financiers that we’ve heard mentioned in the context of raising another round. Spreading reports that the company is in play with Google could be advantageous both to current investors looking for a good valuation for the company, as well as for the company as it looks for new backers.\n\nAnd it turns out that the satellite game is not only pricey, but dicey, too.\n\nSkybox’s existing data comes from the single bird that it currently has in orbit.\n\nIt recently put in an order for some 13 more devices to be built by Space Systems/Loral, set for a launch in 2015/2016, but more immediately it has plans to launch its second satellite by the end of June. “Think of that June date as a kind of deadline for Skybox,” one source told us. “Either for an exit, or getting that financing round in place.”\n\nSatellite launches typically take place as “secondary passengers” on larger spacecraft, with many of launches of larger spacecraft getting partly or fully funded by the government.\n\nIn the case of Skybox, its plan had been to send its second satellite up piggybacking on the launch of a Soyuz vehicle scheduled to go out from the Baikonur Cosmodrome, which is in Kazakhstan but is fully controlled by the Russian government.\n\nIn the wake of sanctions between the U.S. and Russia over tensions in Ukraine – the U.S. State Department on April 28 said it would bar exports, possibly even retroactively, of satellites to Russia if they “contribute to Russia’s military capabilities” – there have been a lot of question marks over how launches from Baikonur would be affected.\n\nSpaceNews reported earlier this month that a Canadian satellite, which was supposed to piggyback on the same Soyuz launch as Skybox’s bird, was barred by the Canadian government from doing so, citing the Ukrainian situation.\n\nSkybox declined to comment to SpaceNews about the impact of the political tension between the U.S. and Russia. Skybox’s are commercial satellites, but even so, the U.S. government has included commercial launches in past restrictions, such as in the case of launches from China.\n\nThe launch situation is complicated, but not insurmountable. “India has a very successful launch program, and there are commercial options in the US such as with SpaceX,” notes Soenen from Blackbridge. “So there are a handful of other options for a low-cost satellite launch.”\n\nThe one satellite that Skybox has up “doesn’t give them much capacity,” as Soenen puts it. “They wouldn’t be able to do that until they have their full constellation up there.” But nevertheless it is producing some interesting data already. “Beautiful, just beautiful,” is how another industry source described it to me.\n\nIn other words, if Google does end up buying any satellite business, it will be but one high step, and a long-term bet, into a more data-rich, map-filled future.\n\n.\n\n——————————————————————————————————————\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\nSvenska Ecaps har fått en mångmiljonorder på raketbränsle.

The 12 HPGP system modules included in this new contract are to be delivered during 2015 and 2016.\n\n.\n\nAn additional key aspect of the agreement is that ECAPS will be able to offer the existing propulsion system module design, or derivatives thereof, as a “drop-in”/off-the-shelf solution for other small satellites requiring high performance propulsion at a reduced life-cycle cost.\n\n.\n\n——————————————————————————————————————\n\n.\n\nAbout delayed projects within ECAPS and the circumstance that Skybox granted SSL an exclusive license to the satellite design\n\n.\n\nFebruary 17, 2014 – SSC year end report 2013\n\n.\n\nEven the results in the Technology division declined. This was a consequence of low orders in Airborne Systems and delayed projects within ECAPS and NanoSpace activities.\n\n.\n\n.\n\nSSL will build 13 small LEO satellites, each about 60 x 60 x 95 centimeters and weighing roughly 120 kilograms, to be launched in 2015 and 2016. These satellites, based on a Skybox design, will capture sub-meter color imagery and up to 90-second clips of HD video with 30 frames per second. Once the 13 satellites are launched, Skybox will be able to revisit any point on earth three times per day.\n\n“With the successful launch of SkySat-1 in November 2013, we validated our high-performance imaging satellite design and economics,” said Michael Trela, vice president of satellite systems, Skybox Imaging. “By partnering with SSL, we can leverage their unique production capabilities to scale with greater cost-efficiency and speed while allowing us to focus on prototyping next generation systems to better serve our customers.”\n\n“The contract award from Skybox is tangible evidence of our success in working with MDA to expand into new markets,” said John Celli, president of SSL. “Based on SSL’s unique strengths as a satellite manufacturer and MDA’s heritage, we are developing new capabilities that will enable us to pursue other earth observation and LEO satellite opportunities in the U.S. and abroad.”\n\nAs part of the agreement, Skybox granted SSL an exclusive license to the satellite design. This provides SSL with a unique platform to address the growing demand for small satellites and related services.\n\n——————————————————————————————————————\n\n.\n\nFrom 27th Annual AIAA/USU Conference on Small Satellites. Conference Small Satellite 2013\n\n.\n\n.\n\nLink to corresponding ”paper” (see below): Hydrocarbon-Seeded Ignition System for Small Spacecraft Thrusters Using Ionic Liquid Propellants\n\n.\n\nECAPS has developed a proprietary catalyst bed for decomposing the LMP-103S monopropellant, and this catalyst bed (catbed) has been demonstrated to be capable of surviving more than 30 minutes of collected burn time and multiple restarts.\n\n.\n\nA major disadvantage of the ECAPS design is the requirement to preheat the catbed to at least 350 C before ignition can occur.\n\n.\n\nFor the Prisma flight the Maximum load during the catalyst pre-heating is 9.25 Watts, and 8.3 Watts during the thruster firing. Mean power consumption during firing is 7.3 watts.\n\n.\n\nA 10-Watt heater was installed in the Prisma spacecraft. Depending on the relative sun angle the duty cycle of the heater varies from 67 to 93%. The time required for 9.25 W catbed preheating to 340 C in flight varied from 600 s to 720 s. Operationally preheating time is set conservatively to 30 minutes before enabling the thruster for firing.\n\n.\n\nBecause of the potential for freezing the water component of HPGP, the average temperature of the propellant tank was maintained at an operating temperature near 20 C.\n\n.\n\nEach ignition preheat cycle consumed as much as 25 kJ of energy. It is highly unlikely that a NanoSat-scale spacecraft could provide this sustained energy input.\n\n.\n\nSimilarly, Zube and Wucherer32 have developed a temperature resistant, Iridium-based catalyst for high performing HAN-mixtures that included HAN269MEO, and a HAN, aminoethylamine-trinitrate (TRN3), water mixture.\n\n.\n\nOf primary interest in this effort was the development of the catalyst-support material to which a active Iridium catalyst is affixed. Two ceramics, zirconium diboride (ZrB2) and zirconium carbide (ZrC), were found to be sufficiently robust to extend the test time to a point where the catalyst material was no longer the time limiting factor. These tests allowed significant burn times, greater than 5 minutes, and a large number of starts, greater than 20.\n\n.\n\nThus, for the first time, HAN thruster performance above 250 s measured Isp was achieved on a repeated basis without the handicap of frequent catalyst change.\n\n.\n\nUnfortunately, like the ECAPS catbed, the Iridium/zirconate catalysts still required a significant preheat, up to 400 C to achieve stable and smooth combustion.\n\n.\n\n——————————————————————————————————————\n\nNovember 2013\n\n.\n\nNews about ECAPS partner ATK\n\n.\n\nSteve Beckel, previously ATK and ”responsibility for hypersonic propulsion and green liquid rocket engine market strategy and discretionary investment.”\n\n.\n\nNow President, Beckel Engineering LLC see Steve Beckel at Linkedin.\n\n……………………………………………………….\n\n.\n\nA new Patent Application Publication by Nicolas Pelletier, CNES,\n\n.\n\nSee, Patent Application Publication (10) Pub.

It made its debut in 2010 aboard PRISMA, a Swedish satellite meant to demonstrate the fuel in precision flying with small thrusters. For comparison, the mission also carried hydrazine. It took 3 people 7 days to load the green propellant on the launch pad, and 5 people and 14 days to load the hydrazine.\n\n.\n\nECAPS is now seeking general approval from the European Space Agency for the propellant. France’s space agency, CNES, is considering it for a new line of small satellites, and the company Skybox Imaging of Mountain View, California, will begin using the fuel when it launches the third of its 24-craft Earth-imaging constellation in 2015. “We really believe this is going to be the future, especially for small spacecraft,” says Jonny Dyer, Skybox’s chief engineer.\n\n—\n\nIt was not only for comparsion.

The lower combustion temperature may enable the usage of less expensive materials for the\n\nthrust chamber assembly as compared with the baseline design for HPGP thrusters\n\n.\n\n.\n\nThe benefits of solid rockets are their storability, compactness and simplicity. No propellant delivery system is required which enables a huge improvement in reliability and cost. However, current solid rockets suffer from two major drawbacks; once ignited the thrust cannot be altered and their specific impulse is low.\n\n.\n\nThe HISP project (http://www.foi.se/en/Customer–Partners/Projects/HISP/HISP/) of the European Commission’s Seventh Framework\n\nProgram addresses the latter by developing high performance solid propellants using the high energy density oxidizer ammonium dinitramide (ADN), glycidyl azide polymer (GAP) and high energy density fuels such as aluminium hydride (AlH3), micron- and nano-aluminum and activated aluminum.\n\n.\n\n——————————————————————————————————————\n\n.\n\nSSC / ECAPS doesn´t release an own pressrelease about the of the important Astrium-ECAPS green propellant co-operation.

Furthermore, this landmark initiative supports Astrium’s intention to be an environmental-friendly company.\n\n.\n\nThe cooperation sees long-term research, marketing and production collaboration between the two entities in order to further advance their cutting edge propulsion capacities. Under the new agreement Astrium will bring in its expertise and experience in manufacturing, integration and provision of satellite platforms and propulsion systems while ECAPS will provide its expertise in the development and qualification of Ammonium Dinitramide based technologies, in particular thrusters and propellant.\n\n.\n\nDr. Andreas Rohne, Director of Astrium’s Propulsion and Equipment said: “This agreement is the result of intense discussions following several years of cooperation between Astrium and ECAPS. Astrium is to pursue this long-term strategic partnership for the sake of both parties and the space industry in general”.\n\n.\n\nThe signing of this agreement marks the beginning of a long-term partnership between Astrium and ECAPS for the development of propulsion systems for future satellite propulsion systems, roll control systems for launch vehicles and many other propulsion applications yet to come.\n\n.\n\nUr Rymdstyrelsens Diarium\n\n.\n\nDiarienr: RS2010-75\n\n.\n\nAvsändare: ECAPS, Ecological Advanced Propulsion Systems\n\n.\n\nÄrendemening: HPGP för Ariane 5 ME\n\n.\n\nÄrende-status: Öppet\n\n.\n\nRegistreringsdatum: 2010-05-18\n\n.\n\n…….\n\n.\n\nDiarienr: RS2012-267\n\n.\n\nAvsändare: Astrium GmbH\n\n.\n\nÄrendemening: Astrium GmbH Non disclosure agreement (sekretessavtal)\n\n.\n\nÄrende-status: Avslutad\n\n.\n\nRegistreringsdatum: 2012-11-23\n\n.\n\n……….\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n——————————————————————————————————————\n\n.\n\nFrom the swedish annual report ECAPS_Aktiebolag_2012_12m (scanned paper in pdf)\n\n.\n\n( ANNUAL REPORT FISCAL YEAR 2012 ECAPS AB Google translate & without figures)\n\n.\n\nUndertecknad styrelseledamot i ECAPS AB intygar härmed dels att denna kopia av årsredovisningen överensstämmer med originalet, dels att resultat- och balansräkningen samt förslaget till vinstdisposition fastställts av stämman den 3 juni 2013.\n\nSolna, den 1 juli 2013\n\nJenny Klefström\n\nÅRSREDOVISNING RÄKENSKAPSÅRET 2012 FÖRVALTNINGSBERÄTTELSE\n\nECAPS AKTIEBOLAG Org nr 556602-7446 Styrelsens säte: Solna\n\nÄgarförhållanden\n\nECAPS AB är sedan den 1 juli 2006 helägt dotterbolag till Svenska rymdaktiebolaget, (org nr 556166-5836, säte i Kiruna).\n\nBolagets verksamhet\n\nMålet med verksamheten är att utveckla raketmotorer och framdrivningssystem för miljövänligt, flytande och lagringsbart drivmedel baserat på Ammonium Dinitramide (ADN). Denna teknik benämns High Performance Green Propulsion (HPGP) och sedan 2010 har denna framgångsrikt demonstrerats under missionen för den svenska satelliten PRISMA i omloppsbana runt jorden. Drivmedlet som används på PRISMA heter LMP-103S och det används tillsammans med 1 Newton (1N) raketmotorer som också är framtagna av ECAPS. Resultaten från användningen av PRISMAs framdrivningssystem med drivmedel LMP-103S och 1N raketmotorer, verifierar att prestandan för HPGP är högre än med ett konventionellt hydrazin-baserat framdrivningssystem. Bolagets framgångar med HPGP har rönt stor uppmärksamhet inom branschen och resultaten efter två års missionstid har presenterats på ett stort antal internationella konferenser och föreläsningar under verksamhetsåret. PRISMA-missionen är förlängd med ytterligare ett år och intresset från marknaden är stort. Inte minst sedan ECHA (den europeiska kemikaliemyndigheten) fört in hydrazin i kandidatförteckningen (som är en del av kemikalieförordningen REACH) över ämnen som kan ha allvarliga effekter på människors hälsa eller för miljön. så kallade “Substances of Very High Concern” eller SVHC. Den europeiska rymdorganisationen ESA och europeisk rymdindustri betraktar drivmedlet LMP-103S från ECAPS som det främsta alternativet till att ersatta hydrazin inom rimlig tid i fall ett förbud för (eller begränsning i användandet av) hydrazin träder i kraft.\n\nECAPS har förberett för serieproduktion av 1N raketmotorer och utvecklingsarbetet av större motorer i storlekar 5N, 22N och 200N har pågått under året med lyckade resultat. En 5N raketmotor och LMP-103S levererades till USA där inbjudna gäster från NASA och amerikansk rymdindustri bevittnade framgångsrika motorprov. Arbetet med att ta fram en demonstrationsmotor med 200N dragkraft för övre steget på Ariane 5 ME, avslutades med framgångsrika motorprov hos Astrium i Tyskland. Detta är första året som ECAPS raketmotorer testas utanför Sveriges gränser.\n\nArbete med materialkompatibilitet mellan LMP-103S och systemkomponenter har fortgått och dessutom har ytterligare karaktärisering av ECAPS ADN-baserade bränslen\n\nSid 2\n\ngenomförts. LMP-103S kan flygtransporteras genom transportklassning UN 1.4S och DOT 1.4S, vilket har demonstrerats genom flygtransporter inom Europa, till USA och till Japan under året. Produktionen av LMP-103S har framgångsrikt skalats upp för att kunna möta marknadens framtida behov.\n\nEtt flertal offerter har under året lämnats till både europeiska och amerikanska bolag.Skybox Imaging är den första kommersiella kunden som tecknat avtal med ECAPS rörande ett framdrivningssystem till deras tredje SkySat satellit med 1N motorer, drivmedel LMP-103S och tankning av satelliten vid uppskjutningsbasen, med option på framdrivningssystem till efterföljande SkySat satelliter. Ett antal länder undersöker möjligheterna till fördjupat samarbete med Sverige. Rymdstyrelsen och ECAPS.Under året har ett avtal tecknats mellan Rymdstyrelsen och CNES gällande samarbete rörande HPGP för satellitplattformen Myriade Evolutions.\n\nECAPS har sedan ett antal år partnerskap med två amerikanska företag för marknadsföring på den amerikanska marknaden av ECAPS produkter. Under året har ECAPS också tecknat ett liknande partneravtal med ett europeiskt företag.\n\nKommersiella beställningar av både motorer och bränsle från kunder i USA har erhållits under verksamhetsåret. ECAPS har ökat fokus på amerikanska marknaden genom att upprätta ett kontor i USA. med fokus på partnerstöd i frågor rörande försäljning, marknadsföring och affärsutveckling.\n\nPatent och skyddande av immateriella rättigheter är en viktig fråga för ECAPS och även under 2012 har ECAPS vidgat och preciserat de patent som söktes och tillfördes bolaget under tidigare år.

The Tango spacecraft was shut down permanently and a series of optimized orbit maneuvers were commanded to the Mango spacecraft in order to initiate the drift towards the new object. The rendezvous is expected in the second half of 2014 and will demonstrate optical relative navigation technologies and the characterization of the rendezvous object and its motion with the use of the on-board video system. The rendezvous strategy within IRIDES includes a series of collision free drift maneuvers past the rendezvous object gradually reducing the closest relative distance. IRIDES aims at demonstrating rendezvous and inspection of an uncooperative rendezvous target. The demonstrated technologies for this rendezvous are believed to play an important role in the future developments associated with space debris mitigation.\n\n.\n\nThe mission phase started with the decommissioning of Tango by permanently shutting down all systems on-board the spacecraft. This was a necessary step since Tango does not have any direct ground communication capability and only is possible to command via the intersatellite link from Mango.\n\n.\n\nThe transfer start orbit was then executed in a series of delta-V maneuvers from May 13 to June 20, 2013. The total amount of delta-V was 32 m/s. Initially, the transfer start was planned to be performed by lowering the perigee only. This could be achieved by selecting the time for the maneuver when the perigee occurs on the equators. The advantage of this approach was that the lowering of the perigee introduces some additional drag which then is possible to utilize as additional delta-V. Unfortunately, the thruster pulse firing period took longer time than expected. The main reasons were to allow for proper performance evaluation of the propulsion systems as well as the assessment of feasibility to increase the duration of each thrust pulse. As a result, there was a period in the middle of the transfer start during which no thruster pulses were fired.\n\n.\n\n——————————————————————————————————————\n\n.\n\nAbout the Green propellant AF-M315E and the Green Infusion Mission\n\n.\n\n.\n\nEcological Advanced Propulsion Systems (Ecaps), a unit of the Swedish Space Corp., has tested a different green propellant—based on ammonium dinitramide—in space. The fuel was used in tandem with a hydrazine system on the Prisma mission’s Mango satellite to maneuver in formation with a smaller spacecraft\n\n.\n\nSwedish space officials say they were able to fuel the green system on Prisma in one day, meeting Russian safety requirements for their launch on a Dnepr-1 rocket without wearing hazmat suits. During the formation-flying operations, the Mango satellite fired thrusters using hydrazine and the LMP-103S green propellant interchangeably (AW&ST Nov. 1, 2010, p. 69).\n\n.\n\nBall’s GPIM spacecraft will use all five Aerojet Rocketdyne thrusters simultaneously to demonstrate attitude control, spacecraft point and hold, orbit lowering and inclination change. It will also characterize the thruster performance in space for future improvements, which could include shipping fueled spacecraft instead of fueling them at the launch site.\n\n.\n\n“We’re looking to demonstrate about 7 kg (15 lb.) of fuel out of the entire propulsion system. That really is just for a very small spacecraft. However, as part of the overall program that we’re doing, we’re not just testing the engines and the flight engines during the overall qualification program to those levels of fuel. We’re actually testing them to 30 kg of throughput, especially on the 22N, so that we will demonstrate its compatibility with longer-life missions.”\n\n.\n\n…………\n\n.\n\nMore links to NASA – Ball Aerospace Green Infusion Mission and the 22N-thruster which now has managed ”11 hours of continuous firing”\n\n.\n\n.\n\nEcological Advanced Propulsion Systems (Ecaps), a unit of the Swedish Space Corporation, has tested a different green propellant — based on ammonium dinitramide — in space.

The company, founded in 2009 by four Stanford grad students, has raised $91 million from Khosla Ventures, Bessemer Venture Partners and others.\n\nSkybox co-founder Dan Berkenstock says that is enough to launch two satellites, the first of which it will deploy next year. He says the company aims to offer ”frequent monitoring as a service,” adding that insurance companies, farmers and Fortune 500 businesses have expressed interest in data gleaned from taking frequent shots of places like harbors or commercial centers.\n\nThese ventures are nascent, and it is unclear which, if any, of the new entrants will turn into successful businesses or even have successful launches. The companies must secure licenses from the Federal Communications Commission and, if they are taking images of Earth, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. The U.S. government limits the resolution that photos can be taken at to protect national security.\n\nWhile the components needed to make a satellite are relatively inexpensive, communication technologies can be challenging, as can securing partnerships with space companies to launch them.\n\nAug 23, 2011: Skybox Imaging Founder Honored for Innovation in Satellite Imagery\n\nDec 5, 2011: Skybox Imaging’s Dan Berkenstock Uses Satellites To Make Sense Of The World\n\nApril 17, 2012: Skybox Imaging Raises $70 Million in New Financing\n\nNov 29, 2012: Skybox Imaging Completes Significant Testing Milestone Preceding Its First Satellite and Product Launch\n\nDec 7, 2012: 40u40: Dan Berkenstock\n\nLinks from Stanford University´s Entrepreneurship Corner\n\nDan Berkenstock\n\n…………………………………………………………..\n\n.\n\nInside the Box: 66 satellite flight boards have been built in our electrical lab. pic.twitter.com/Ocfgk9oR\n\n.\n\nClean room?\n\n.\n\nBaby Chase (among others) is in awe of the spacecraft development in our clean room. pic.twitter.com/bd5FfUGq\n\n.\n\n.\n\n——————————————————————————————————————\n\n.\n\nECAPS will design and manufacture a complete High Performance Green Propulsion (HPGP) system for Skybox’s third Earth observation satellite, according to Skybox\n\n.\n\nIn the U.S., a startup company called Skybox Imaging, also plans to develop a constellation of smallsats for imagery.

Samma bränsle är också av intresse för de länder som utvecklar missiler för annat än civila ändamål.\n\nUtvecklingen av detta mera effektiva och miljövänliga framdrivningssystem är ett exempel på en utveckling av en helt ny produkt som ersätter en gammal.\n\nESA har uppmärksammat utvecklingen i Sverige, som är klart världsledande, och de har inkluderat den i den pågående harmoniseringen. Utvecklingen inkluderar också forskning vid Chalmers och KTH för framtagning av nya material och tester görs vid FOI:s anläggningar.\n\nUtvecklingen av hela framdrivningssystemet sker i ett bolag, Ecaps, som tidigare var samägt av Volvo Aero Corporation och Rymdbolaget.\n\nVolvo Aero har lämnat projektet av strategiska skäl och Rymdstyrelsen ser fördelar\n\nmed att Rymdbolaget hittar en internationell partner för att sprida framtida utvecklingskostnader på fler händer trots att det riskerar att delar av teknikutvecklingen och därmed framtida arbete hamnar utomlands.\n\nRymdstyrelsens anslag räcker inte till för att ensamt stödja nästa steg av utvecklingen.\n\n——————————————————————————————————————-\n\nPrinceton hjälper SSC med att marknadsföra HPGP på den amerikanska ”rymdmarknaden” genom sin Space Rapid Transit (SRT) dvs ett försök att sälja in transporter till ISS\n\nSRT is a class of horizontally-launched, horizontally landing fully reusable two-stage to orbit vehicles. This concept is not new and was the basis for the German Saenger and NASA Beta concepts. SRT-M is designed to bring 425 kg payloads to the International Space Station. The SRT-C is a larger vehicle designed to bring 6 astronauts and 1000 kg to the ISS.\n\nDual fuel permits the Ferry Stage to easily move the SRT between airfields. Stage separation occurs and a liquid oxygen/liquid hydrogen rocket engine, the Pratt & Whitney RL 10B-2 for the SRT-M and the SSME for the SRT-C, takes the Upper Stage into earth orbit. The reaction control system on the Upper Stage would use the Swedish Space Corporation’s HPGP Thruster which use a green propellant. This would simplify ground operations.\n\n——————————————————————————————————————-\n\nhttp://smsc.cnes.fr/MYRIADE-EVOLUTIONS/PDF/Papier_Portoroz.pdf\n\nMYRIADE EVOLUTIONS PROGRAM\n\nThe program aims to develop and qualify a platform product available for the period 2015-2025.\n\nThis platform product line will offer a platform for scientific, defense and industrial applications.\n\nAs per for the fist generation, low cost, adaptability, short planning are the main drivers of the Myriade Evolutions program.\n\nThe flight domain has been redefined in order to cope with the probable missions over this period :\n\nEarth observation and monitoring, sun and space observation (from LEO), defense program. These led to specify a range of 500 – 800 km altitude, SSO orbits for all LTAN. The specified in orbit lifetime is 5 years, with extended qualification to 7 years when possible.\n\nThe program shall produce a satellite design, a selection of off the shelf product, the specification and qualification of specific products, and mathematical models in order to make easier the design, development and qualification of application missions. Myriade Evolutions program will be compliant with CNES ISIS Standard, in order to ensure the satellite operability by the ISIS Command and Control Center, whose development is starting in 2012.\n\nThe development of necessary simulators and databases are part of the program and will be available for application missions.\n\nFor EEE parts selection , the approach is to compliant with ECSS class 3 policy. This approach is compatible with COTS components when associated to specific test campaign for radiation aspects and packaging.\n\nThe satellite design will be optimized for internal and external positions of Soyuz, VEGA and will be compatible with Dniepr, Rockot and PSLV.\n\n.\n\nExcept thrusters, all the propulsion sub-system elements are compatible of the ADN green propellant.\n\nThe impacts (electrical, thermal…) of replacing the hydrazine by green propellant are under study.\n\nThe final baseline for propellant choice will be chosen in 2012 depending on REACH final decisions and accommodation studies.\n\n——————————————————————————————————————-\n\nANNEX XV – IDENTIFICATION OF HYDRAZINE AS SVHC\n\nADN-based monopropellants (two different formulations developed in Sweden) have already found some practical experimental use.\n\nThe PRISMA mission was recently launched on ADN-based fuel and results so far appear to be satisfactory.\n\nADN-based formulations are less hazardous than anhydrous hydrazine, are claimed by their developers to have good compatibility with materials currently used in commercially available thrusters and can deliver a significant (up to 30%) increase in density-specific impulse over anhydrous hydrazine.\n\nHowever, they do require product re-design for thrusters with a thrust level above 1 N.\n\nIn addition, ignition needs to be further explored; hydrazine propellants use catalytic ignition, which is simple and reliable.\n\nTo replace hydrazine, an ADN-based monopropellant must be as easy to ignite. The high combustion chamber temperature is a matter of concern since it might deteriorate a catalyst bed.\n\nThe European Space Agency but also leading organisations and companies involved in Europe’s space programme have voiced strong concerns on the readiness of ADN-based propellants to replace hydrazine even in the longer term, whilst the use of hydrazine is based on extensive research and experience over the last 50-60 years.\n\nThe Agency in particular has expressed the opinion that no alternative to hydrazine in propulsion is available in the long-term and emphasised that the secured supply of hydrazine is vital for the current and future success of the European space programme.\n\nExperience with the performance of a propellant on a geostationary satellite is a prerequisite before it is considered a feasible alternative and such testing would require at least 15 years. Issues of the autonomy, strategic position and competitiveness of the European aerospace industry should also be taken into account.\n\nAdditional comments on the potential shortcomings of ADN-based alternatives are provided in Confidential Annex 4.\n\n——————————————————————————————————————-\n\nTime and Space Resolved Measurements from Rocket Engines\n\nEn examensarbete av Erik Fors (Nedan Foto Ecaps AB)\n\n——————————————————————————————————————-\n\nDen svenska staten utvecklar 2 bränslen ADN-baserade gröna raketbränslen, LMP-103S genom SSC & FLP-106 genom det svenska försvaret.\n\nLäs dokumenten om ADN – gröna raketbränslen och varför ingen? vill använda HPGP, inte ens det svenska försvaret (SSCs patent)\n\nSe also: Part_from_Initial-development-of-a-labratory-rocket-thruster-for-ADN-based-liquid-monopropellants\n\nFLP-106 (one page) Characterization of the ADN-based liquid monopropellant FLP-106\n\n3 documents about ADN-based propellants type FLP-106 ( & LMP-103S)\n\nADN-based (+ FLP-106 versus LMP-103S )\n\nInTech-Green_propellants_based_on_ammonium_dinitramide_adn\n\nADN-based (but not LMP-103S)\n\nFormulation-and-characterization-of-ADN-based-liquid-monopropellants\n\nElectrical ignition of new environmental friendly propellants for rockets and spacecrafts More from FOI about ADN propellants\n\nEU & DLR test green propellants i.e. FLP-106 but not LMP-103S\n\nEU: General_GRASP Presentation\n\nDLR: Institute of Space Propulsion_Status_Report_Teil_1\n\n——————————————————————————————————————-\n\n8 dec 2012\n\nLauncher Propulsion, Programm Wintersemester 2012/2013\n\nTechnische Universität München – Fakultät Maschinenwesen\n\nBoltzmannstr. 15, 85748 Garching\n\nMontags, 15:45 Uhr – 17:15 Uhr, Raum 1639\n\n17.12.2012 Green Satellite Propulsion\n\nMathias Persson, ECAPS, Stockholm\n\n——————————————————————————————————————-\n\n28 november 2012\n\nRobert Cumming, Popast, intervjuar Anna & Mathias på ECAPS om framtidsutsikterna för HPGP\n\nNASA ratade gröna bränslet – men svenska ECAPS ger inte upp\n\nDet såg ljust ut. I somras levererades en uppskalad version av motorn som testades på Prismasatelliterna. Motorn har också visats upp för flera underleverantörer till NASA.\n\nMen i oktober meddelades att uppdraget istället gått till amerikanska Ball Industries och deras samarbetspartner Aerojet. Mathias Persson, vd för ECAPS, är sammanbiten.\n\n– Alla hade trott att det skulle vara fler än en som skulle väljas. Men man valde en amerikansk lösning som har utvecklats under 20 år av USA:s flygvapen, säger han.\n\n——————————————————————————————————————-\n\nEngineers at Cleveland’s NASA Glenn Research Center prepare to test safer ‘green’ space propellant\n\nThe new propellant, AF-M315E, seems to have some clear advantages over hydrazine.\n\nThe green propellant’s vapor pressure is lower than hydrazine’s. That means that it doesn’t boil or explosively expand when exposed to the atmosphere and that extra-thick tank walls aren’t needed to contain it.\n\nAF-M315E also is denser than hydrazine, so its fuel tank can be as much as 40 percent smaller. That frees up precious room on a satellite or spacecraft for additional science gear or other payloads.\n\nFinally, the green propellant is more efficient than its hydrazine counterpart. Rocket fuels are judged by something called specific impulse. It’s a measure of the amount of fuel needed to achieve a certain momentum — basically, a propellant’s pushing power.\n\nAF-M315E has a higher specific impulse than hydrazine, so less of it is needed to do the same amount of pushing work. Less fuel means less weight, another key consideration when every additional ounce costs more money to boost into orbit.\n\nPotential downside: Not a simple swap\n\nWith all those benefits, AF-M315E seems like a slam-dunk. But it has a potential downside: it burns much hotter than hydrazine. So satellite and spacecraft makers can’t just swap one propellant for the other.\n\nAF-M315E isn’t a simple ”drop-in” replacement fuel, like ethanol for gasoline. The catalyst material that ignites the green propellant, and the engine housings where the combustion occurs, have to be upgraded to withstand the higher temperature.\n\nWe have answers for all of these but . . . you have to replace them all and make sure they’re able to be changed,” said Matthew Deans, an aerospace engineer with NASA Glenn’s propulsion and propellants branch who’s on the green propellant team. In ground tests, engineers from the Air Force and satellite maker Aerojet Corp. have run a prototype high-heat green propellant thruster for as much as 11 hours — far longer than the few-second pulses that engines typically fire when correcting a satellite’s position.\n\nBut the prototype thruster has to be slimmed down for flight aboard the demonstration mission’s spacecraft, which is only about the size of a two-drawer file cabinet. The team must verify that the lighter engine can still handle the heat.\n\nBecause of NASA Glenn’s decades of experience with space propulsion, and its work with the Air Force on hydrazine alternatives, the center’s engineers will oversee development of the new propulsion system.\n\n——————————————————————————————————————-\n\nECAPS @ Small Satellite Conferance Aug 2012.\n\nAaron Dinardi´s presentation och motsvarande “paper”.\n\nKuriosa i sammanhanget är att det framgår av “the paper” att ECAPS “holds a numerous worldwide patents” samt att HPGP-4 föregick launchen av Prisma.\n\nAtt vi (jag) på SSC-DHS som designade elektroniken som kontrollerade HPGP / Hydrazine systemen inte fick någon som helst feedback från körningarna i rymden, kan kanske också kallas kuriosa (om man är snäll)\n\n————————————————————————————————————\n\nAugusti 2012: HPGP är nu ett varumärke ägt av ECAPS Aktiebolag\n\nBrann AB är ECAPS ombud i denna fråga om immateriella rättigheter.\n\nEcaps Aktiebolags Trademark HPGP\n\nDokument från US patent Office\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n………………………………………………………………………………………………….\n\n15 augusti 2012 – NASA RELEASE : 12-281\n\nWASHINGTON — NASA has selected a team led by Ball Aerospace & Technologies Corporation of Boulder, Colo., for a technology demonstration of a high performance ”green” propellant alternative to the highly toxic fuel hydrazine.

One project was a ‘green’ propulsion system that was developed by ATK alongside ECAPS, a Swedish space company. This technology is an environmentally friendly system that gives satellites and spacecraft the ability to move.\n\n………………………………………………………………………………………………….\n\nFrån Federal Business Opportunities\n\nH–HIGH PERFORMANCE GREEN PROPULSIOIN TESTING\n\nSynopsis:\n\nAdded: Sep 13, 2012 2:54 pm\n\nNASA/GSFC has a requirement to test a 5 Newton (1-lbf) High Performance Green Propulsion (HPGP) thruster. NASA/GSFC intends to procure services from ATK. It is our understanding that ATK is the only vendor that can provide the HPGP thruster test article and the LMP-103s propellant that is required for thruster operation and testing. Questions regarding this acquisition must be directed to the attention of Antwan G. Reid via e-mail at Antwan.G.Reid.at.nasa.gov or via facsimile at (301) 286-8371 by 3:00pm EST, September 24, 2012.\n\nA determination by the Government not to compete this proposed effort on a full and open competition basis, based upon responses to this notice, is solely within the discretion of the Government.\n\n………………………………………………………………………………………………….\n\nJuli – augusti 2012\n\n99–22N THRUSTER AND AMMONIUM DINITRIMIDE PROPELLANT BLEND LMP-103S\n\nOm sidan ovan är otillgänglig se pdf nedan.\n\n99–22N THRUSTER AND AMMONIUM DINITRIMIDE PROPELLANT BLEND LMP-103S – NNM12441217Q – Federal Business Opportunities_ Opportunities\n\nNASAs officiella dokument (i pdf) se nedan\n\nStatement of Work LMP-152538-OTHER-001-001\n\n&\n\nTerms and Conditions LMP-152538-OTHER-001-002\n\n………………………………………………………………………………………………….\n\nNASA-TechTransferNews-Winter12\n\nOpportunities in Propulsion Systems, VOLUME 10, NUMBER 1 | WINTER 2012\n\nDEVELOPING GREENER PROPULSION\n\nAs a result, NASA Goddard is focused on using propellants other than hydrazine. One possible alternative is a propellant called LMP-103S, which is significantly less toxic than hydrazine. Developed in Sweden, LMP-103S is a blended monopropellant which contains ammonium dinitramide (ADN). It also offers more stability and lower storage cost. According to Dr. Driscoll, this technology has an advantage over other potential propellants in that it has already demonstrated its effectiveness in space. “LMP-103S is currently flying on PRISMA, a Swedish National Space Board funded mission. And so far, it’s working fine.”\n\nOther propellants being considered for NASA Goddard propulsion systems include NOFBX, a nitrous oxide blended monopropellant from Firestar Technologies, and AF-M315E, a blended monopropellant being developed by the U.S. Air Force. “NASA Goddard doesn’t develop propellants in-house,” notes Dr. Driscoll. “But we can play an important role in their development. For example, we can help provide in-flight qualification.”\n\nNedan.
