Sadly, this precious source of data has largely been inaccessible until the 2010s: while cameras were getting better and better, computers still couldn’t understand the content of images. All of this changed when a new class of AI algorithms came on the scene. Deep Learning is a family of algorithms with unsurpassed (for now) learning power that can reach human-level accuracy in important tasks like detecting objects and faces in images. These abilities make it possible for businesses to supercharge their existing products with magical abilities, like automatically creating photo albums based on the content of images, or automate industrial processes.\n\n4.1 Using computer vision to spruce up the real estate marketplace\n\n4.1.1 The challenges of computer vision\n\n4.2 AI for image classification: What is Deep Learning?\n\n4.3 State of the art performance with small datasets: Transfer Learning.\n\n4.4 Face recognition: teaching computers to recognize people\n\n4.5 Content generation and Style Transfer\n\n4.6 What to watch out for\n\n4.7 AI for audio\n\n4.8 Case study: optimizing agriculture with Deep Learning\n\n4.8.1 Case questions\n\n4.8.2 Case Discussion"
