        "text": "History\n\nThe station got its Federal Communications Commission (FCC) construction permit in 2003 as WGGT. On October 28, 2005, the still unbuilt station changed its call sign to WPBI, and signed on the air in 2006.[2] Owned by Intermart Broadcasting of Southwest Florida, the original power was 1,200 watts by day, 250 watts at night.\n\nThe call letters were changed to WSVU on October 1, 2006;[3] carrying an adult standards music format and featuring news updates from CBS Radio News, the station was owned by North Palm Beach Broadcasting, Inc. On May 14, 2014, North Palm Beach Broadcasting announced that it had sold WSVU and its translators to JVC Media, pending FCC approval.[4] The sale closed effective September 8, 2014, at a purchase price of $850,000.\n\nOn October 6, 2014, WSVU and its FM translator at 95.9 MHz changed their format to soft adult contemporary, branded as \"95.9 The Palm\".[5]\n\nOn August 15, 2017, the oldies format of WBGF moved to WSVU.[6] The station used the syndicated network known as The True Oldies Channel.\n\nBy November 2017, JVC Media co-founder Vic Canales, in a deal worth $450,000, sold his ownership position in the company. Canales, better known by his on-air name \"Vic Latino,\" stuck a deal to swap his stake in the nine-year old company for 960 WSVU in West Palm Beach. Canales exchanged his shares worth a combined $450,000 for WSVU and two translators: the North Palm Beach-licensed translator W240CI at 95.9 FM and the Jupiter-licensed translator W295BJ at 106.9 FM. Together the three signals were branded as \"True Oldies Channel 95.9-106.9.\" The transaction was consummated on January 29, 2018. Once the deal closed, JVC Media of South Florida continued to own and operate WSWN 900 AM.[7]\n\nWSVU dropped the \"True Oldies\" format on November 1, 2019 (which continues on W240CI and W295BJ; instead relaying WIRK's HD3 digital subchannel) and stunted with Christmas music during the holiday season as \"Rudolph's Radio 92.7/101.7\";[8] the stunt gave way to classic rock branded \"The Surf 92.5/101.7\" that December 25.[9]"
