Fosse’s film took far more Oscars (8) than The Godfather (3) in 1972, including one for Liza and one for Fosse himself.\n\nbest performance: It is Cabaret one and New York, New York two again in this category for Liza. In Cabaret, Liza plays Sally Bowles – an absolute livewire. Liza’s obvious talent are abundantly evident from the outset. She is confident and her energy is contagious. This is a performance that ranks among the greatest ever in a musical.\n\nstylistic innovations/traits: Liza Minnelli was a massive star in the 1970s after Cabaret (1972). Her persona and genius as a musical performer seem to a perfect fit for the Sally Bowles character. Liza is also the daughter of Vincent Minnelli and Judy Garland of course. Like her mother Garland and Liza’s contemporary Barbara Streisand, Liza was a musician, touring as much or more than she was a film actor. Liza has only had maybe fifteen (15) to sixteen (16) film credits and her archiveable filmography is not lengthy . Still, she gives one of the best film performances of the 1970s and her work in New York, New York gives her a backup performance on her resume that separates her from the one-hit wonders.\n\n.\n\ndirectors worked with: Bob Fosse (1), Martin Scorsese (1)\n\ntop five performances:\n\nCabaret\n\nNew York, New York\n\nArthur\n\narchiveable films"
