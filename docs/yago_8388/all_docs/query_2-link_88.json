        "text": "1973 was a memorable year. That year can be seen as the start of a social awareness about the demise of the earth (‘Limits to growth’ in 1972) and the vulnerability of fossil fuels (Oil crisis in 1973). In France this was therefore called the end of the Trente Glorieuses, the peaceful recovery period from 1945 to 1973, with growth in prosperity, employment, a higher average education and the rise of the service economy.\n\nThe film La Grande Bouffe is a cynical indictment of the unforeseen negative consequences of the Trente Glorieuses, a period without war, but also without tradition or meaning. In the film, four highly educated, rich white men eat themselves to death. They don’t do much more than that and they do it without apparent reasons or a preconceived purpose. It simply arises from a decadent boredom that naturally accelerates and can only be stopped by death. Freed from norms and traditions, the four men appear unable to cope with the resulting meaninglessness. Boundless hedonism may initially seem like heaven, but in reality turns out to be hell. There are reasons why the film is still watchable after 50 years.\n\nMarco Ferreri\n\nIt all starts with director Marco Ferreri. La Grande Bouffe is based on his own experience during an orgy meal. Ferreri himself was a compulsive eater and once even went to a Swiss clinic to get help for his eating disorder. One night Ferreri had dinner with an abundance of food and invited prostitutes. What was supposed to be a hedonistically pleasant evening (drinks, food and hot women!) turned out to be a nauseating event. “If we had continued eating, we would have died,” Ferreri said. And with that, both the theme for his next film and the collaborating partners were found. His table companions were Philippe & Alain Sarde, Ugo Tognazzi and Bernard Tavernier: Alain became the producer, Philippe made the music and Ugo played the cook.\n\nDuring its production, the film was consciously profiled as a scandalous and shocking film and at its presentation at the Cannes festival, the chairman of the jury, Ingrid Bergman, thought the film was ‘the dirtiest and most vulgar film of the festival’. Philippe Noirot, one of the four actors, says in an interview in L’Express that his mother never wanted to see the film. And actress Andréa Ferréol says: “For months, restaurateurs told us that they refused to serve us. One evening I was at an Italian restaurant with a friend. A few customers stood up and the man came over and said, “Since you’re here, ma’am, I’m leaving!”” It is not surprising: the film shows many taboos: waste, excess, shit, vomit, boredom, nudity and whores.\n\nThe characters\n\nThe characters all have their own arc.\n\nThe film starts with chef Ugo. Ugo Tognazzi is a real culinary actor with his own cookbook and wears his own chef’s jacket in the film. Ugo is the most supportive of the four characters: he is the professional who provides everyone with delicious food and works towards his pièce de resistance: the dome with pate. He only dies on his own kitchen table after the others can no longer handle his food, the ultimate goal or humiliation of a chef. It’s just how you look at it.\n\nMarcello (Mastroianni) is a pilot. He cannot live without women and needs sex every day. But when he cannot perform on the last day — because he really ate too much — he is frustrated. He kicks the toilet and gets shit all over him, after which he flees in a Bugatti that he found in the garage. Sitting in the car, he freezes in the winter cold: the pilot-driver died in the harness, killed because he could not practice his great hobby — sex, not food.\n\nMichel (Piccoli) is a TV director, a repressed gay man and a hygiene fetishist as is evident from the opening scene in which he takes pleasure in assessing new cleaning supplies.. His mother never allowed him to pass gas, which caused him to suffer from constipation and flatulence. In one scene he lies on the bed and his intestines are massaged by Marcello until a long wind escapes. Wearing orange gloves, he tries to get through the meals as hygienically as possible. But to no avail, as the ultimate irony he dies after a major diarrhea attack.\n\nPhilip (Noiret) is probably the most important man of note: a judge in everyday life. We are the only one who sees him not in his profession, but at home in bed as a whining, helpless man. His landlady is a mother figure who feeds him and also satisfies his sexual needs. It is no coincidence that Philip falls for the plump Andréa, who is, after all, the same mother type as his landlady. Philip’s death is the last: he comes and goes in the bosom of a woman.\n\nThe women in the film come off a bit shabby: they are three whores and a mother figure: Andréa. She is a teacher and turns out to be a gourmet and caretaker of the four gentlemen. Andréa Ferréol was an unknown actress. This was her debut film and she had to gain 50 pounds for the role. She was paid for every extra kilo she gained, under medical supervision, and after the film she was given weight-loss treatment. Ferréol later played for many famous directors.\n\nThe set\n\nAlmost the entire film takes place in a classic Parisian villa with an equally classic garden. That style continues in the old Bugatti in the garage, the solid kitchen including a cold room, copper pans and workbenches. In the living room there are paintings, stuffed animals and an aquarium, old nude photos are projected and Latin is quoted: it constantly exudes a classic bourgeoisie. But upon arrival the atmosphere is musty, old-fashioned and in a state of decay. And as the film progresses, the characters become completely absorbed in the setting.\n\nLa Grande Bouffe and The Menu\n\nThe abundance of food was delivered daily by the luxury caterer Fauchon in Paris with Giuseppe Maffioli as culinary director, an actor and gastronome who also wrote cookbooks. Each day’s call sheet consisted of ¾ the order with Fauchon and ¼ instructions for the actors. At 6 o’clock in the morning the chef of the day came and cooked the dishes that were eaten in that day’s scenes for at least 2 hours. In the beginning, the actors were looking forward to the food when they smelled the smells from the kitchen, but after a few weeks of shooting that actually turned into nausea and horror. Not only because they had to eat a lot every day, but the heat from the film lamps caused the food to spoil quickly. If the food really had to be eaten, it was filmed in the morning, because that was no longer possible at the end of the day. What was still edible was taken by friends in the evening and the animals in the area also quickly found the set.\n\nIf La Grande Bouffe were to be shot now, it would become a film like The Menu by Mike Mylod. In The Menu we no longer cook ourselves, but we hand ourselves over to a star chef and his cooking brigade. In The Menu, all the food is real and made by no fewer than three star chefs. We no longer eat it in an old villa, but we want a unique experience on an isolated island in a hypermodern restaurant. The food itself is also modern and certainly not traditionally French, and it is far too little rather than far too much. The characters in The Menu are just as bourgeois as in La Grande Bouffe: an actor, critic, foodie and members of the mafia. They represent the perversion of the current culinary network and, just like in La Grande Bouffe, their limitless hedonism ends there, with eating dessert. 50 years after La Grande Bouffe, the pointlessness and aimlessness are the same, only the way has changed.\n\nThe complete menu of La Grande Bouffe\n\nAn orange\n\nA Boudin\n\nA Marrow tube\n\nOysters\n\nBreakfast with omelette and hot chocolate\n\nKidney bordelaise\n\nRaw chicory\n\nQuail on skull skewers\n\nSuckling pig with mint cream and peaches\n\nCassoulet, with sausage and duck leg\n\nThree-layer cake\n\nSuckling Pig\n\nPissaladière provencale\n\nMashed potatoes\n\nGreen tagliatelle ‘Andrea’\n\nBuccatini with meat sauce\n\nTortellini with mushroom cream sauce\n\nCrepes suzette\n\nTagliatelle with white sauce\n\nTurkey leg\n\nApple sauce, Parmesan cheese and chestnut puree\n\nBortsch\n\nPolenta with tomato sauce\n\nTarte Andrea with green and red fruit\n\nBrioche in milk\n\nDome with three types of pate: goose, chicken and duck\n\nBlancmanger of two tits"
