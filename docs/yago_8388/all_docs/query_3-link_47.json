        "text": "AKA Liza May Minnelli\n\nBorn: 12-Mar-1946\n\nBirthplace: Los Angeles, CA\n\nGender: Female\n\nRace or Ethnicity: White\n\nOccupation: Singer, Actor\n\nNationality: United States\n\nExecutive summary: Cabaret\n\nThe daughter of Judy Garland and Vincente Minnelli, and the goddaughter of Ira Gershwin, Minnelli was raised on sets and in studios, and made her film debut at age 2½, in her mother's In the Good Old Summertime. She was five when her parents divorced, and shuttled between them for the rest of her childhood. She was 18 when her aunt (Garland's sister) committed suicide, and 23 when her mother overdosed on barbiturates.\n\nMinnelli sang on stage with her mother as a teen in London, and their album Live at the London Palladium is a double-nova star turn with both singers at their best. She made her Broadway debut at 19 in Flora, The Red Menace, and won a Tony for her performance. Minnelli later starred in the Broadway runs of Chicago and Victor/Victoria. She has gone on to win three Tonys, including a special award in 1974 \"for adding luster to the Broadway season\". In films, Minelli is probably best known as Dudley Moore's long-suffering girlfriend and wife in Arthur and Arthur 2: On the Rocks. She won an Oscar in 1972 as Best Actress for Caberet, and won an Emmy in 1973 for her Bob Fosse-produced special, Liza with a 'Z'. She is the only Oscar-winner whose parents were also both Oscar winners.\n\nIn addition to her lengthy list of performing accomplishments, Minnelli is also perceived as one of the strangest celebrities of our time. She hung out at Andy Warhol's studio, did cocaine and other recreational drugs, and has battled alcoholism for decades.\n\nHer mother introduced Minnelli to Broadway and pop songwriter Peter Allen, who became Minnelli's first husband. He was already widely rumored to be gay when they married, and reportedly spent their wedding night with a boyfriend. Minnelli & Allen eventually divorced, but remained friends until his death from AIDS. Her second husband, Jack Haley, Jr., was the son of the actor who played The Tin Man in her mother's The Wizard of Oz. Her third husband was Mark Gero, whose father had been the stage manager for her Broadway debut years earlier.\n\nHer fourth husband, concert producer David Gest, collects Shirley Temple memorabilia, and Tito and Michael Jackson shared best man duties at their wedding. While Gest and Minnelli were married, VH1 planned to air a reality show set in their reality, but the show was scuttled before its debut. According to VH1's lawsuit, Gest's behavior went \"far beyond the acceptable bounds of show business eccentricity\" -- he demanded that VH1 pay for his wardrobe, would not allow crew members to sit on the furniture, and repeatedly disrupted filming when he felt he did not look his best. During their divorce, Gest accused Minnelli of repeatedly beating him while they were married, while she claimed he had stolen $2 million.\n\nIn 2002, Minnelli was sued by Vincente Minnelli's widow, Lee Anderson Minnelli, for elder abuse, refusing to pay housekeeping or utility bills, and allowing her stepmother's Sunset Boulevard house to fall into disrepair. In 2004, Minnelli was sued by M'hammed Soumayah, her former bodyguard and chauffeur, who alleged that he was forced to have sex with Minnelli as a condition for keeping his job. He also alleged that Minnelli repeatedly beat him.\n\nMinnelli is almost as much a gay icon as her mother was, and there have long been whispers that she may be bisexual. She provided the voice of Dorothy for the 1974 animated sequel Journey Back to Oz, with Garland's long-time co-star Mickey Rooney as the Scarecrow, and Margaret Hamilton -- the original Wicked Witch of the West -- as Aunt Em.\n\nMinnelli has had at least two hip replacement surgeries, surgery to repair vocal cord damage, and several surgeries to repair dance-induced knee injuries.\n\nFather: Vincente Minnelli (film director)\n\nMother: Judy Garland (actress)\n\nFather: Sidney Luft (stepfather, producer, married to Garland 1952-65)\n\nSister: Lorna Luft (Broadway performer, half-sister, b. 21-Nov-1952 to Garland & Luft)\n\nBrother: Joey Luft (half-brother, b. 29-Mar-1955 to Garland & Luft)\n\nFather: Mark Herron (stepfather, actor, married to Garland 1965-66)\n\nFather: Mickey Devinko (stepfather, \"Mickey Deans\", disco promoter, married Garland 15-Mar-1969)\n\nMother: Georgette Magnani (stepmother, married to V.
