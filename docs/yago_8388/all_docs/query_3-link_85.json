        "text": "Liza Minnelli is here to settle scores. The Oscar-winning icon is putting out a memoir, per People, in spring 2026. Why bother now? Well, this gal’s got some scores to settle, and we’re not even talking about the popular Twitter account that implies she should be dead by now. According to Minnelli, she was not planning to write a memoir, until you lot ruined her legacy, basically. She lists a few things that recently disturbed her enough to correct the record: “a sabotaged appearance at the Oscars” (Lady Gaga, watch out), “a film with twisted half-truths” (Renée Zellweger, be cautious), and “a recent miniseries that just didn’t get it right” (Krysta Rodriguez, sleep with one eye open). Minnelli further notes that these mistakes were “all made by people who didn’t know my family and don’t really know me.”\n\nMinnelli is documenting the true story of her life alongside writers Heidi Evans and Josh Getlin with the help of her friend Michael Feinstein. Feinstein notably referred to his friend as “sabotaged” after the 2022 Oscars, the same language Minnelli apparently uses in statements now. Honestly, we get why you need four people to write this particular memoir — one person to remember that she sang a disco version of “Losing My Mind” and three to process it."
