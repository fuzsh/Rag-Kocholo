Sam and Josh make a deal that ensures there will be no Congressional hearing about Leo's drug problem. Sam terminates the woman responsible for exposing Leo's personnel file, but Leo quickly rehires her.\n\nHell Hath No Fury\n\nThe team tries to help a millionaire's son who has been accused of rape; when Olivia takes on Amanda Tanner as a client, her first request is a meeting with the president."
