        "text": "One of the most anticipated documentaries premiering at the Tribeca Film Festival this year is about Liza Minnelli. The daughter of legend Judy Garland, Minnelli has forged a successful career of her own. The documentary by Bruce David Klein titled Liza: A Truly Terrific Absolutely True Story shares the tale of her life and career through interviews and previously unseen footage.\n\nWhile festival founder Robert De Niro reportedly asked her to attend the screening, Minnelli is too unwell to attend. She is currently 78 years old and dealing with health issues after years of alcoholism and prescription drug addiction, hip replacements, a knee-cap replacement, polyps on her vocal cords and viral encephalitis, which causes inflammation of the brain that can lead to seizures, confusion and problems with movement, hearing and sight. She was last seen earlier this year in a wheelchair, looking quite frail.\n\nDespite being unable to travel and missing the event, Minnelli has been teasing some new projects on social media. She has hinted at new music and even shared her excitement about the new documentary. About two months ago, she shared a throwback photo of herself and wrote, “Hi Kids! Sit down, because this is a long story! People always wonder what I’m up to… when will I make another film? I already have! Last week, I told you: I’m having fun, doing great things and you’ll learn about them here. Ta Da! This is one of my many new projects. I’ve been working quietly with a brilliant director, Bruce David Klein and @atlasmediacorp to bring the real story of how my career in films and more began.”\n\nShe continued, “And I’m not talking about my baby debut at MGM with Mama… that was pure nepotism. You’re gonna see me telling it all in “LIZA: A Truly Terrific Absolutely True Story” — a fabulous documentary featuring footage of me today and from my archives. Our movie is getting a big screen premiere at the incredible #TribecaFestival in June. I’m so excited! I can’t stand it! Stay tuned babies…there’s so much more to share! Thank you for always loving me. I absolutely love each of you.”\n\nHopefully, the film will be available for fans very soon!"
