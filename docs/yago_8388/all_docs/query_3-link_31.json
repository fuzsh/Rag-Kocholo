        "text": "\"The Film-Make-Her\": The Documentary on the Life and Films of Lisa Azuelos\n\ndirected and produced by David Serero\n\n​\n\nLisa Azuelos (LOL, Comme t'y es belle, Dalida) is the subject of the new documentary by David Serero. Following his documentary on fashion designer Elie Tahari, David Serero turns his attention to filmmaker, screenwriter, and producer Lisa Azuelos. This film retraces her journey from her origins to the present day, including a masterclass by Lisa Azuelos, where she shares her secrets.\n\n​\n\nThe film features a stellar cast, including François Cluzet, Michèle Laroque, Alexandra Lamy, Sveva Alviti, and Djanis Bouzyani. Notable figures such as interior decorator Sarah Poniatowski and Pathé Films president Mr. Jérôme Seydoux are also involved. American actor Amir Arison is part of the cast as well. The film is shot in both English and French.\n\n\"The Film-Make-Her\" explores Lisa Azuelos' Sephardic origins and her childhood growing up between two cultures, with her French mother, Marie Laforet, and her Moroccan father, paying tribute to her daughters Carmen and Thais Alessandrin. The film also delves into Lisa Azuelos' activism, including the contribution of Diata N'Diaye. Mr. Jérôme Seydoux, President of Pathé, is also featured in the movie as he has produced several films by Lisa Azuelos.\n\nLisa Azuelos' films have been box office hits and have become classics in France. She is best known in the United States for LOL, starring Miley Cyrus and Demi Moore. In her French films, she has directed some of the biggest names in French cinema, from Sophie Marceau to François Cluzet.\n\n\"Lisa Azuelos is my mentor. She is a dazzling woman with exceptional talent, leaving her signature on the global cinematic landscape. We are discussing the film 'à la Azuelos,' a perpetual celebration of life. By delving into her life, we embark on the unique journey of this filmmaker, mother, and director who has transformed the French cinema landscape with her distinct approach, placing women at the center of her stories and bringing her experiences to the screen. The choice of the title 'The Film-Make-Her' (cinéaste) is particularly relevant,\" shared David Serero.\n\nLisa Azuelos: Born on November 6, 1965, in Neuilly-sur-Seine, Lisa Azuelos is the daughter of actress Marie Laforêt and Judas Azuelos, a Moroccan businessman. Her parents separated when she was only two years old. While her mother had custody, Lisa was sent to a boarding school in Switzerland, where her father retrieved her at twelve. After completing her baccalaureate, Lisa pursued studies in management. In 1987, amidst the stock market crash, she turned her back on the business world and embarked on a career in cinema. She worked as an assistant, wrote scripts, and met her future husband, director Patrick Alessandrin, from whom she divorced after eleven years of marriage. In 1995, she co-wrote her first screenplay, Ainsi soient-ils, with him, and in 2001, she wrote the comedy 15 août on her own. Her success took off from there. In 2006, she wrote and directed Comme t'y es belle, followed by LOL in 2008, starring Sophie Marceau, which attracted over three million viewers. 2014 she directed the film Une Rencontre, again with Sophie Marceau. In 2017, after two years of dedicated work under the watchful eye of Orlando, she likely released her most ambitious film, Dalida, a biopic about the beloved singer who tragically took her own life in 1987. In 2018, she returned to dramatic comedy with My Baby, which earned her the Grand Prix at the Alpe d'Huez Festival. In 2022, she made a brief detour with Prime Video for I Love America, starring Sophie Marceau. This year, she returns to the big screen with La Chambre des Merveilles, directed by the team behind La Famille Bélier.\n\nDavid Serero: Baryton and actor David Serero is an internationally renowned artist.
