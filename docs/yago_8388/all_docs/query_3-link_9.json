        "text": "Singer, actress and daughter of the famous Judy Garland, Liza Minnelli is now getting the documentary treatment. Minnelli has been working with filmmaker and director Bruce David Klein for about two years and has given her blessing to share the story of her life on the big screen. The film is titled LIZA: A Truly Terrific Absolutely True Story and is set to premiere at the Tribeca Film Festival in New York in June 2024.\n\nIf you’re a fan of Minnelli, you probably already know that the title is a reference to her 1972 concert in New York. She said the phrase as she introduced her song and dance routine for “Ring Them Bells.” While the film is set to premiere at the film festival, a premiere date for movie theaters and streaming services is currently unknown.\n\nLiza, now 78 years old, shared on social media about the project, “I’ve been working quietly with a brilliant director, Bruce David Klein and Atlas Media to bring the real story of how my career in films and more began. And I’m not talking about my baby debut at MGM with Mama…. that was pure nepotism.. You’re gonna see me telling it all in LIZA: A Truly Terrific Absolutely True Story — a fabulous documentary featuring footage of me today and from my archives.”\n\nThe documentary will reportedly showcase her entire career, including her childhood as the daughter of Garland and director Vincente Minnelli. As she grew up, she appeared in both off-Broadway and Broadway shows, films, and had a robust singing career. Minnelli’s younger singer Lorna Luft and many of her former co-stars are set to appear in the film.\n\nAs of now, there is no trailer but we will keep you posted on any new details as they come out! Will you watch the film about Minnelli’s life and career?"
