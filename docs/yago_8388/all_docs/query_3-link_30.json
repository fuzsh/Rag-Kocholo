Meanwhile, Charlotte gets so carried away preparing her first Sabbath dinner for Harry that she drops the (matzoh) ball; Miranda is liberated by Berger's perspective on dating and men; and Samantha revels in role-playing fantasies with Jerry.\n\nBurned\n\nIn this powerful episode directed by Eriq LaSalle, the Sennet couple will stop at nothing to get custody of their daughter Tessa (guest star Tiffany Evans). Dets. Stabler (Chris Meloni) and Benson (Mariska Hargitay) are given the difficult assignment of sorting through the lies and deception in a classic \"he said, she said\" case that ends up leaving one of the parents in a grave medical state. The episode reunited Eriq LaSalle with former ER castmate Michael Michele. Dann Florek, Richard Belzer, Diane Neal, B.D. Wong, and Tamara Tunie also star.\n\nDependent\n\nMob lawyer (guest star Cary Elwes) and his family are brutally attacked leaving a young boy as the sole witness -- Mob lawyer Sidney Truex and his wife are brutally attacked, leaving his young son emotionally scarred. When the Detectives have to locate the Truexs' daughter, Charlotte (guest star Emily VanCamp), to notify her about the attack on her parents, Detectives Olivia Benson and Elliot Stabler find Charlotte at her boyfriend Ryan's apartment. Through an exhaustive interview process, the Detectives must sort through the web of lies Charlotte has told in order to piece together a night of drinking and drugs leaving Charlotte unable to recall details of the evening. However, her father comes out of surgery and is able to vividly remember his daughter at the crime scene. The disturbing case takes another turn as Stabler is brought up on charges of excessive force after getting into a very serious altercation with Ryan."
