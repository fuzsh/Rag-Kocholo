        "text": "YEP — TRULY TERRIFIC\n\n“It’s Liza with a “Z” not Lisa with an “S” cause Lisa with an “S” goes…” If you know the remainder of that lyric, you’re definitely a fan of Miss Liza Minnelli. What you may not know are the multiple mentors needed to turn the precocious daughter of silver screen icons Judy Garland and Vincent Minnelli into Liza with a Z. In this truly terrific documentary appropriately titled LIZA: A Truly Terrific Absolutely True Story, director Bruce David Klein expertly weaves rare archival footage with present day interviews with an eye to the underpinnings of Minnelli’s decades long career in the entertainment industry. This engrossing mix, including conversations with Liza herself (still fab in her late-seventies), illuminates worldwide celebrity along with the hard work and dedication required of the performing life. While Minnelli was clearly born into Hollywood royalty and given an incredible leg-up at the start of her career, she still had to work hard to prove herself a talent in her own right – and work she did.\n\nJudy Garland with teenage daughter Liza Minnelli at event circa 1965.

From MGM force of nature Kaye Thompson (Minnelli’s godmother) to Broadway composer Fred Ebb (“He invented me!”) to her career-long make-up person (the first female member of the make-up artists union due to Minnelli’s clout) to Halston — the select list goes on. And Minnelli’s strength, loyalty and work ethic are evident throughout. Of course, there’s also a personal side to her story including her marriages, her mother and her stint in rehab. However, the included aspects of her off-stage life are presented in an insightful and compelling way, not as regurgitated tabloid snark. Though life-long friend (they met in pre-school) Mia Farrow’s hilariously disapproving reaction to the mention of Minnelli’s marriage to David Guest is alone worth the price of admission. And Ben Vereen simply saying about Minnelli, “…that’s my baby” is a heartbreaker. Perhaps now mostly relegated to campy impersonations, LIZA: A Truly Terrific Absolutely True Story reminds the world of what a powerful, impactful, influential, hard-working, famous, vulnerable, smart and hilarious star Liza Minnelli is. Truly Terrific.\n\nLIZA: A Truly Terrific Absolutely True Story\n\nAtlas Media\n\npart of Tribeca Film Festival\n\ndocumentary feature | 104 minutes | English | U.S.\n\nreviewed at Village East by Angelika on June 13, 2024\n\nfor more info, visit Tribeca"
