        "text": "Edmonton Oilers, Canadian professional ice hockey team based in Edmonton, Alberta, that plays in the Western Conference in the National Hockey League (NHL). Although a relatively new team, the Oilers have experienced much success, mostly because of Hall of Fame center Wayne Gretzky, viewed by many as the greatest hockey player of all time. The Oilers have won five Stanley Cups and eight conference championships.\n\nThe Oilers were founded in 1972 as one of the original franchises of the World Hockey Association (WHA), a North American professional hockey league that was established as a competitor of the NHL. In 1978 the Oilers acquired Gretzky from the financially struggling Indianapolis Racers, laying the foundation for the Oilers’ dominance in the 1980s. The Oilers were one of four WHA teams that joined the NHL in 1979 when the WHA folded. Edmonton quickly made an impact, qualifying for the playoffs in its first year in the NHL. The Oilers advanced to the Stanley Cup finals in the 1982–83 season behind the play of Gretzky and a stacked team that featured future Hall of Fame members Mark Messier, Glenn Anderson, Jari Kurri, and Paul Coffey. They won their first Stanley Cup the following season and repeated the feat in the 1984–85 season. Edmonton won back-to-back Stanley Cups again in 1986–87 and 1987–88. At the close of the 1987–88 season, the Oilers shocked the hockey world by trading national icon Gretzky to the Los Angeles Kings.\n\nBritannica Quiz\n\nGreat Moments in Sports Quiz\n\nThe 1989–90 season saw Messier lead the Oilers to one more Stanley Cup, proving the team could be great without Gretzky. The champion Oilers squad was disassembled over the next few seasons, notably with Messier being traded to the New York Rangers in 1991. Edmonton experienced failure mixed with success throughout the 1990s and was unable to reestablish itself as an elite team. In the 2005–06 postseason, the Oilers—who entered the playoffs as the eighth and lowest seed in the Western Conference—won in a series of upsets and advanced to the Stanley Cup finals before losing to the Carolina Hurricanes in a dramatic seventh game. The Oilers then entered into a prolonged period of futility that saw the team finish in either last or second to last place in its division in each season of a playoff drought that extended to a club-record five years in 2010–11. A silver lining of that downturn was that the club earned three consecutive first overall picks in the NHL draft from 2010 to 2012, but the infusion of young talent had little immediate impact on Edmonton, as the team continued its streak of missing the postseason through the 2015–16 season."
