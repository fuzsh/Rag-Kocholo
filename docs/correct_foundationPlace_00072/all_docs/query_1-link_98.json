We believe in a fully inclusive and collaborative community of members, professionals, and entrepreneurs working together to make a positive impact in our local communities and the world.\n\nConnect with me here - onehundredmillionstrong.com Adrian Bohach Mahone Bay, Nova Scotia English I have had the privilege of being a pioneer of the Social Enterprise movement in Canada, and elsewhere in the world, for the last almost 35 years. I would like to see the good work that WISIR has done for Social Acquisition up to now continue and grow into new and exciting vistas. Peter Frampton The Learning Enrichment Foundation Toronto English As a 30 year employee of LEF (15 as Executive Director) I have worked in a community that is completely transforming due to a major transit hub. As a founding agency of The Canadian CED Network, I have spent most of my career in this space. Social Acquisitions are an ESSENTIAL component of local economic renewal, and I am happy to share what I know to ensure this resource continues and grows in its impact. Meg Ronson CoopZone Toronto, ON English, French I am a 31-year-old woman leader in economic development, social enterprise and co-op development who has built and led the social acquisition movement over the last three years thanks to the hard work of fellow team members and the support and confidence of many friends and mentors. I am adept at speaking many different kinds of value propositions in this space and am a skilled market developer. I look forward to forming a professional collective of forward-thinking leaders who will be willing and able to take the social acquisition opportunity to new heights to help our small businesses transition into a more sustainable future and all Canadian and Indigenous communities access equity. David Upton Comon Good Solutions CIC Kingsport, Halifax and Cape Breton Regional Mun, Nova Scotia English I am an older white man, my two sons, son-in-law and two of my grandsons are Nunavut Beneficiaries. I have been through a social acquisition process. I deeply understand finance and commercial lending and have worked most of my professional life in rural settings. My hope is that we can help purchasers focus on the key metrics required to finance a takeover, have SA become a regular part of succession planning, and promote the its value in rural cummunities. Yasser Ghazi Ottawa, ON English Yasser Ghazi, 33 years old, Director of Commercial Services at Meridian Credit Union and have been leading the diversified commercial banking growth in Ottawa for Meridian Credit Union.\n\nCurrently, I also sit on the board of directors for the Ottawa Board of Trade and Young Professional Advisory Board for Cornerstone Housing for Women.\n\nI first heard of the social acquisition movement as well as the work of Innovation Lab at Waterloo University through Meg Ronson at the NACCA event at Ottawa. As success and growth through resilience during these economic times is something I've been working on with the city as well as through my organizations, I've taken a passion towards this item as well.\n\nI've had discussions with Ottawa city members on municiple buyout/take over projects and ideas in the past and would love to continue this work through collaboration with the board of the social acquisition community and see a social net positive growth in our communities. Mark Shields Edmonton, AB English I am excited to submit this application to join the executive board of the Social Acquisition Institute. The advancement of social acquisitions is certainly something I see as crucial to Canada's economic sustainability, and equally full of potential for community economic development.\n\nA bit about me, I am currently working as the Program Manager for the Edmonton Regional Innovation Network, my role is to bring cohesion and provide administration to a network of 80+ members all in some way assisting the development of innovative and technological businesses in our city. I lead new initiatives, facilitate member meetings, provide support to programs and advocate for the innovation sector in the community. The ERIN is a collective decision-making body, with an elected steering committee and subcommittees which regularly make decisions by consensus.\n\nAs the holder of a history degree with a lifelong interest in social organization I have a fascination with co-operative models, particularly in business. I actively participate in many co-operatives. I am familiar with the notion of social enterprise and have spent several years as a business strategist working directly with entrepreneurs in developing visions, values and plans for their businesses.\n\nI developed my love of community building as a volunteer member of, and later Program Director for CJSW Radio in Calgary, one of Canada' most successful community radio stations in terms of fundraising and with a membership of over 200. Identifying primarily as a white male, working within this fantastically diverse community has helped me see the place of listening and space-holding that I occupy among my peers of all different identities and types, how diversity weaves a powerful fabric among individuals, and how different people can cohere around a shared goal.\n\nI recognize that taking the amazing work done by the L3 community will face challenges - the need to ensure the necessary resources are obtained to sustain its activities, to create an appropriate and effective governance structure - but two things give me full confidence this will come to fruition. The palpable excitement that comes from the foundation of something truly new, and the powerful impression the work already done by WISIR has left on people like me, who participated along the way and recognized the impact, both potential and real.\n\nI would be honoured to contribute to these next steps at the board level, to have the opportunity to share my thoughts and viewpoints, and even more so to have the opportunity to listen to and consider the viewpoints of the other esteemed members that this initiative will certainly draw.\n\nFor that reason and all I've stated above, I humbly submit this application. And regardless of my selection I very much look forward to the development of the Social Acquisition Institute, and the impact it is sure to make in the Canadian economy.\n\nSincerely,\n\nMark Shields Daphne March ShaMaSha St. John’s English Age: 57 years young, female, Indigenous… I been part of the community from the beginning. Did two interview with students that was working with the project and attendance of meeting. I am interested because I am learning so much, and Community & leadership is so welcoming. This is great work and love to part of it to bring more awareness to my community and partners in Canada. Erin Morgan Ontario Co-operative Association Inc. Guelph, Ontario English Thank you for considering my application to sit on the board of directors.\n\nMy name is Erin Morgan and I have been the executive director of the Ontario Co-operative Association since 2016. I will bring my strengths in team leadership, collaboration, government relations, strategic planning, people management and co-operation to my role on the board if elected.\n\nI have had many years of experience in co-operation and collective decision making, beginning in 2001 when I held my first job as Member Relations Manager with an organic farmers’ co-operative that produced the Organic Meadow line of products. After more than 15 years working in communications, government relations and public relations with various member-based organizations in Ontario’s agricultural sector, I came back to the co-operative movement to lead the team at OCA.\n\nOver the last five years, the team at the Ontario Co-operative Association has doubled OCA’s membership, worked with government to make key updates to the Co-operative Corporations Act, created new experiential learning opportunities for school aged youth, diversified the income of the organization and elevated the organization’s online presence. We are now working with our many member co-operatives to collaboratively address opportunities in Ontario to do better through affordable housing, new approaches to care, and new ideas to build wealth in marginalized communities.\n\nI hope to participate on the board to keep the OCA connected to the innovative ideas that come from this community and bring the opportunities and resources from the co-operative movement to the board. Carla Leon The United Church of Canada Toronto ON English Social acquisitions are at the tip of iceberg in organizations' understanding of what is possible. This mechanism is going to see a surge over the next decade as community wealth building and new models for social enterprise are explored. This is a critical ecosystem that needs to be supported and grown that I would be passionate about being part of. As the Director of Innovation for The United Church of Canada over the last 10 years, we have focused on supporting social innovations from concept to seed funding to growth to sustainability. We have created a for-profit development corporation and now are creating a social purpose holding company. The United Church of Canada is a consensus-based governance structure which is committed to self-determination. Community organizing and putting people first is fundamental in how we work with and see each other. By being on the board, I would hope to bring this lens of a national, grassroots organization. Stephanie Goertz Wilmot, ontario English I am a 39-year-old caucasian female. I am currently on the board/executive/decision-making team for 50by30 Waterloo Region, Nith Valley Eco Boosters (policy lead and advisor for the NVEB youth advocates), Ecumencial working group for Indigenous and Settler Relationships, Food System Roundtable of Waterloo Region, Citizens for Safe Ground Water, Wilmot Horticultural Society (as well as policy lead and programs lead), Waterloo Region Health Coalition. previous board member in 2021 of Gravel Watch Ontario. I am also an ambassador for Climate Reality Project Canada and Climate interactive. I have been working in the area of community and economic development for the past 9 years. I have also run 2 co-working spaces focused on collective action. I am interested in being on the board because I strongly believe more support is needed for rural municipalities and that social acquisition could be used to not only help businesses become more successful but act as a catalyst for community engagement/social capital. My hope would be that this board could leverage key community stakeholders such as municipalities, boards of trades, and other business support organizations to make an impact in our communities. Kevin Harding Vancouver, BC English, French As a white male settler living on the unceded and stolen territories of the Coast Salish peoples including the Squamish, Musqueam, and Tseleil-Watuth in what is called Vancouver, British Columbia, I was honoured to be referred to this opportunity by a friend and colleague. The potential for a social acquisition institute to act as a community catalyst in building socially responsible, community responsive, impact-oriented and driving organizations is immense, and I would be pleased to bring my experience to the board.\n\nI bring a combination of experiences to the table as someone who could contribute to the board. I have worked extensively in the cooperative sector supporting worker co-ops, credit unions, and other cooperative organizations develop their plans and expand their impact. I am currently a PhD student at the Johnson Shoyama Graduate School of Public Policy studying the potential for cooperatives as social enterprises to make impacts in their communities. I have worked with innovative cooperatives in British Columbia, including the development of the first community investment cooperative in BC, a new model that is making waves in localizing impact investment.\n\nIn my professional life, I am a senior policy analyst for a provincial agency in British Columbia where I regularly advance legislative and regulatory proposals to advance the public interest in my policy domain. I serve on the board of a nonprofit community organization in Vancouver dedicated to ocean sports. I have organized and served on boards of multiple cooperative organizations.\n\nI am particularly influenced by the potential of a Social Acquisition Institute to help promote community assets and community investments through cooperative models. As the first \"social enterprise\" model, cooperatives have had tremendous impacts across Canada - in English, in French, and in communities large and small. As we enter complex economic times with business owners looking to transition to retirement and community businesses looking for ways to continue their work, \"exit to community\" is a pathway that deserves serious consideration - and should honestly be a default move.\n\nI would be pleased to contribute to this project. Ken Lewenza Collective Innovation - Public Interest Economic & Social Purpose Development Cooperative Windsor Ontario English Please note that I am looking forward to really taking the time to assemble information here that can help organizers or core stakeholders make a more informed decision about what I can potentially contribute to this board in way that makes sense for everyone involved. So I will assume for now that I can submit something more formal and capacity oriented in the very near future - your support and consideration in this area would be greatly appreciated. Greg Elliott Co-operators Guelph, Ontario English I believe we are at an opportune moment in time to leverage the benefits of social purpose organizations, including the co-operative model, to address business continuity challenges that exist, while simultaneously seeking to address complex societal challenges to enhance community resilience.\n\nI am interested to be part of the Board overseeing a social acquisition ‘institute’, striving to establish a network that enables social acquisitions to flourish on a larger scale. I think it is essential that the Board be comprised of individuals with diverse skill-sets and backgrounds, in order to ensure a range of perspectives are represented.\n\nI have worked at Co-operators for 25 years and in my current role as Senior Advisor, Citizenship, work closely with the Board of Directors of Co-operators Community Funds, which is dedicated to supporting community economic development initiatives that lead to enhanced employability outcomes for marginalized individuals. I also manage our Co-operative Development Program, supporting the growth of emerging and existing co-operatives that are responding to the collective needs of Canadians. I firmly believe that social finance is an important tool for mobilizing capital in a manner that benefits society.\n\nVolunteer opportunities have furthered my leadership and collective decision-making experience. For the past eight years, I have served on the Board of Directors of the Downtown Guelph Business Association, and prior to this served on the Board of the Guelph Chamber of Commerce.\n\nRacial/gender identity: White male Victor Beausoleil SETSI (Social Economy Through Social Inclusion) Toronto, Ontario English 38 years old, male, African Canadian,\n\nInterested in advancing succession and social acquisitions in Canada especially in BIPOC communities.\n\nBio\n\nAt the age of 24 Victor Beausoleil Co-Founded Redemption Reintegration Services one of the largest youth-led, youth justice agencies in Canada.

Anastasia Mourogova Millin Dark Matter Labs Montreal QC English, French Age: 41; Gender: female (she/ her); racial identity: white Caucasian (first generation Canadian immigrant);\n\nProfessional background: corporate banking, impact banking, sustainable finance, impact investing, global capital innovation.\n\nExperience with leadership and collective decision-making: At Dark Matter Labs (Dm), we do not believe in hierarchies nor forced roles & identities nor attribution of value based on ones' pay. As such, being a strong female leader in Dm means much more than just relying on a title and industry experience. Rather, it invokes my inherent abilities to deliver informed recommendations and create pathways for Dm colleagues to contribute their inputs, so that together we could reach necessary agreements and proceed with decisions. At Dm, I regard myself as capital & real estate missions holder - in service of other missions, external partnerships and solutions that ideally address the challenges faced by our world. This requires me to ensure that every project under the missions attracts diverse voices and expertise, both within the organization as well as amongst wider eco-system.\n\nExperience with social acquisitions: in my role as Director of Lending and Market Development at Vancity Community Investment Bank (VCIB) - first schedule A impact bank in Canada, I have structured $250-million in loans to impact businesses; an example of impact deal would be a loan to finance the launching of operations for the first bio gas producer in Ontario; a not-for-profit acquiring a real estate asset; an energy co-op; and a BCorp looking to invest into internal ESOP structure. I have a thorough understanding of needed due diligence for both debt and equity investments into businesses as well as real estate assets.\n\nReasons for being interested in being on the board:\n\n1. Respect for WISIR mission and vision;\n\n2. Agreement with Social Acquisition Initiative;\n\n3.

Bringing a diverse voice, depth of experience, and global knowledge to the board.\n\n3. Creating pathways for scale, through understanding of risks and manifestation of returns and positive spillover values.\n\n4. Sharing best practices with the community as well as learning from fellow board members. Liz MacRae Village Wellth Calgary, AB English I am a 36 year old, caucasian woman from Atlantic Canada, living in Alberta. My background is in marketing, non-profit, entrepreneurship, transaction services and tech.\n\nI am passionate about connecting acquisition & succession resources and services with patrons who need them from across the country. Sharing knowledge and tools can help create efficiencies in the acquisition ecosystem so that more ownership transitions can be completed successfully.\n\nSocial Acquisitions are fascinating to me. As a certified Exit Planner I teach the various exit strategies available. Social acquisition is an underrepresented exit option. It interests me to be a part of the social acquisition movement as it evolves and finds a home in existing knowledge centres.\n\nBridging the gap between business owners and succession solutions is a daily focus for me as Head of Partnerships at Village Wellth.\n\nAs a member of the board I would hope to see a communal resource strategy that is available across the country, bridging the provincial divides and inconsistent access to services & programming. As well, ongoing awareness to the advisor ecosystem of the strategies available for social acquisition.
