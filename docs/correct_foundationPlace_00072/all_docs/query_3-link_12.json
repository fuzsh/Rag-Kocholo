        "text": "In conjunction with Black History Month, Crowe LLP and Intuit Inc. announced their collaboration on a new Crowe Beacon small business advancement initiative that will source funding commitments from several key financial institutions and sponsors.\n\nThe pilot initiative is focused on helping Black, Indigenous, People of Color (BIPOC); women; and veteran-owned small businesses grow, enhance financial maturity, and become more capital-ready. It will give an initial 1,000 qualifying U.S. small businesses access to the QuickBooks financial technology platform along with much needed accounting and consulting services from Crowe that will better position them to manage and capitalize their businesses to drive sustainable growth.\n\nAccording to the latest U.S. Census Bureau’s Annual Business Survey, nearly 20% of small businesses are minority-owned, and for Black small business owners, 30% have relied on credit cards to fund investments in their business’s future growth, according to the 2024 Intuit QuickBooks Black History Month Survey.\n\nThe Crowe Beacon small business advancement initiative is tailored to serve the needs of high-performing businesses that may historically be underserved and under-resourced–with a specific focus on BIPOC businesses with annual revenues below $5 million. Crowe Beacon provides all the traditional accounting and consulting services of Crowe on an affordable managed service platform that can help enterprises develop, mature, and evolve their financial and business planning capabilities in a way that better positions them to leverage financial and capital mechanisms.\n\nQuickBooks will serve as the exclusive small business technology partner for the Crowe Beacon initiative, providing participating small businesses with access to the QuickBooks Online platform, a connected suite of tools that create efficiencies and deliver insights to help businesses at every stage of growth manage their finances end-to-end, and provide transparency to capital and procurement readiness. QuickBooks will also provide onboarding, training, and technical support to help small business owners realize the benefits of using the integrated QuickBooks platform.\n\nLeveraging the QuickBooks platform, Crowe will provide the critical accounting guidance, and coaching, and access to a portfolio of its leading consulting and advisory services. This includes tax planning and preparation, cash flow planning, forecasting, invoicing and many more - the result will be small businesses with better accounting and financial practices that will enable them to unlock their true potential and help them scale and grow.\n\nSeveral articles published on the Firm of the Future blog to honor Black History Month include the following:"
