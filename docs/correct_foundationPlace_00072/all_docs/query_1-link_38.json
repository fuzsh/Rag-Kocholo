        "text": "The NBA’s Los Angeles Clippers have teamed up with hospitality partner Levy to launch the innovative 310 Provisions F&B platform at the team’s Intuit Dome home arena, which is scheduled to open this summer.\n\nThe tech-heavy, sustainability-focused 310 Provisions F&B program is built to eliminate wait times and deliver the highest quality food experience, Levy said.\n\nFood Management said the new venue has a culinary back of house which includes a 14,000+ square foot main kitchen, which is nearly twice the size of the industry average, and multiple commissaries strategically located throughout the building to support distribution.\n\nThere are a dozen exhibition kitchens in premium spaces, and energy-efficient kitchens in 65% of fan locations to continually offer fresh-cooked menus.\n\nOn the general concourses, 100% of the food locations are frictionless, compared to 15% at other arenas around the world.\n\nThe multi-year planning process and focus on what’s best for the fan experience influenced the infrastructure that will ensure the food and beverage vision for Intuit Dome can be delivered for all events.\n\nOpening summer 2024, Intuit Dome was built with a clear vision to optimize the food and beverage experience for fans, a goal which has guided the work since the initial arena design process began.\n\nIntuit Dome will host hundreds of sporting events and concerts each year. Located in Inglewood, Calif., Intuit Dome is built different — it will redefine fans’ expectations for live experiences and change the music landscape in Los Angeles.\n\nIt will be the first arena with 100% frictionless hospitality, enabled by technology to serve fresh, ‘craveable’ foods of the highest quality with no wait times.\n\nGillian Zucker, LA Clippers and Intuit Dome President, said, “Fans care about food. We are eager for our guests to enjoy the food and beverage experience, which we have obsessed over for nearly five years.\n\n“Along with AECOM, we worked with Levy to facilitate the operational design for the next generation arena, leveraging Levy’s experience and talent with one goal in mind – to provide high quality, sustainably sourced food that fans crave, delivering it where and when guests want it, all cooked to perfection. 310 Provisions has been created to deliver on that promise.”\n\nAndy Lansing, Levy CEO, added, “To have partnered with such a visionary team as the LA Clippers over the past five years and plan this next generation arena before a shovel even touched the ground has been the most amazing collaboration. Together we’ve created the touchstone for future hospitality experiences in sports and music. It is rare to be able to be part of such a truly transformational moment, and what we have created at Intuit Dome marks one of those moments.\n\n“We had the amazing opportunity to imagine the ideal scenario and what next generation food and beverage could be. The Clippers brought it all together and made an uncommon investment in fans by setting the vision, pushing the design process, and providing the space, equipment, and technology to create what will be a one-of-a kind food and beverage experience at Intuit Dome.”\n\nThe disruptor in defining the sports and entertainment hospitality experience, Levy is recognized as the market leader and most critically acclaimed hospitality company in its industry.\n\nLevy’s diverse portfolio includes award-winning restaurants; iconic sports and entertainment venues, zoos and cultural institutions, theaters and music festivals, and convention centers; as well as the Super Bowl, Grammy Awards, US Open Tennis Tournament, Kentucky Derby, Coachella and Stagecoach Music Festivals, and NHL, MLB, NBA, NFL, and MLS All-Star Games.\n\nContinue to follow Coliseum for latest updates on venues business news.
