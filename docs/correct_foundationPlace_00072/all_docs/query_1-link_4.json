        "text": "Edmonton is situated on a relatively flat prairie landscape distinguished by the meandering North Saskatchewan River. The river and its tributaries that flow into the city dissect the urban landscape with steep ravines. The presence of these ravine systems inspired the construction of many miles of linear parks that invite both summer and winter recreation. North of the river lies the central business district, with its many high-rise office and condominium buildings. Two distinctive structures that transformed the skyline in the early 21st century are the 28-story EPCOR Tower (2011) and, a short distance away, the low-rise curvilinear steel-and-glass Art Gallery of Alberta (2010). The architecture of the downtown core is not entirely modern, however; the Alberta Legislature Building (1912) is notable for its Beaux Arts style. South of the river, the historic neighbourhood of Old Strathcona has retained its 19th-century brick buildings.\n\nHistorically, waves of immigrants have made Edmonton their home, creating a multicultural city. Some of the earliest groups came from eastern Europe (such as Ukrainian, Russian, and Polish) in the late 19th century. After them came the Chinese, who arrived to work on constructing the railways. Newcomers from many other countries (including Italy, Germany, Vietnam, and others) followed, attracted by the many employment and business opportunities that the booming northern metropolitan centre had to offer. Today a number of ethnic neighbourhoods reflect this diverse heritage, including Chinatown, Little Italy, and the Vietnamese district. To the north of the downtown core is the “Avenue of Nations,” an area with many stores and restaurants of different cultures and cuisines.\n\nEdmonton is located within the “Fertile Belt” of the Canadian prairies, a region with optimal soil and sufficient moisture for growing grain. Also important are lumbering, flour milling, meatpacking, tanning, and dairying.\n\nThe dominant factor in Edmonton’s economy (as in that of Alberta as a whole) has long been the production of oil. Its industrial base includes oil refining (including synthetic fuels) and the production of many other petrochemicals, plastics, and fertilizers. The host of industries and services related to oil and gas production include engineering, equipment manufacturing, transportation, finance, insurance, and accounting. Other services, such as those associated with coal, agriculture, tourism, education, and public administration, are also important. Edmonton has diversified into other areas as well, notably high technology and software development. Oil and gas pipelines radiate from the city, and its international airport, major rail lines, and highways support its role as the wholesale, retail, and distribution centre of northwestern Canada.\n\nStreetcars were introduced in 1908 to meet the growing population’s need for public transportation. Today the city is served by a network of buses and a light-rail transit system. There are also hundreds of miles of walking paths, bike lanes, and trails.\n\nEdmonton is the location of a number of colleges and universities, including the University of Alberta (1908), the Northern Alberta Institute of Technology (1960), and Athabasca University (an “open university” founded in 1970). Among the city’s cultural institutions are the Royal Alberta Museum, which specializes in exhibits on the province’s history, natural history, and geology; the Art Gallery of Alberta, with collections of Canadian and international fine arts; and the Edmonton Valley Zoo. Fort Edmonton Park, a large park with history-themed attractions southwest of the city centre on the North Saskatchewan River, features a replica of the original Hudson’s Bay Company trading post. Edmonton has a symphony orchestra and is host to many festivals year-round, the best known of which is Capital EX (formerly known as Klondike Days), a 10-day exhibition (generally in July) that attracts many visitors to the city. In August is the Edmonton International Fringe Theatre Festival—the oldest, and one of the largest, fringe festivals in North America. Professional sports teams include the Oilers (National Hockey League) and the Elks (Canadian Football League). Edmonton has one of the world’s largest shopping malls, the West Edmonton Mall, containing a large selection of retail outlets (more than 800 stores), theme parks, hotels, theatres, and many other attractions."
