Here is some advice she recently shared with emerging women engineers and aspiring leaders: 🚪 Embrace opportunities: “Go through the door when it opens for you.” The fear of failure shouldn't hold you back. Every challenge is a stepping stone to greater learning and success. 🥇 Build trust and respect: Your team members are humans too. Adopt a “help me, help you\" mindset to cultivate a culture of trust and deliver better results as a team. 🌐 Find mentors and sponsors: Mentors and sponsors provide guidance, advocate on your behalf, and help you navigate the complexities of your career path. Make your work stand out and give others ample reason to support you. 👐 Lead with authenticity: Be bold, ask for help when needed, and don’t be afraid to show vulnerability. Authentic leadership inspires and attracts others to want to work with you. To read Krithika’s full story, visit the Intuit Blog. #INWED24\n\nOur Intuit IDEAS program is now in Atlanta, Los Angeles, and Philadelphia. Intuit is providing small business owners with new financial technology and expert advice. At the end of the program, we'll also give each business owner $5,000 to help them grow. Applications are now open and interested businesses can apply with Urban League of Greater Atl, Los Angeles Urban League, and Urban League of Philadelphia."
