All ratings are determined solely by our editorial team.\n\nBest for Zoho Users\n\nZoho Books\n\n4.5\n\nOur ratings take into account a product's cost, features, ease of use, customer service and other category-specific attributes.

If you’re already using Zoho products to manage projects, teams or support, there’s even more reason to opt for Zoho Books for your accounting needs: seamless integration.\n\nThe free plan is packed with features that are helpful for a solo operation. You can manage up to 1,000 invoices per year, set up recurring invoices and track expenses. There are features to help you manage 1099 contractors and take payments. If you want to add on payroll, you’ll need to upgrade to a paid plan, which starts at $15 per month (paid annually) and allows up to three users.\n\nAs you scale up your business, you can scale up your Zoho Books plan to better suit your needs. Each plan comes with fewer limitations, more advanced features and better support options (free users only get email support).\n\nLearn more: Read our full Zoho Books review.\n\nWho should use it:\n\nZoho Books is best for those who are already using Zoho products to manage their businesses. However, it’s also a good option for freelancers who need feature-rich accounting software to send invoices and manage expenses.\n\nPros & Cons\n\nFree plan available\n\nCustomization and automation on paid plans\n\nLots of features beyond accounting and billing\n\nIntegrates with Zoho ecosystem for comprehensive work OS\n\nComplicated ecosystem\n\nLots of limitations on free plan\n\nMaximum of 15 users\n\nBest for Freelancers\n\nFreshBooks\n\n4.4\n\nOur ratings take into account a product's cost, features, ease of use, customer service and other category-specific attributes.

It’s designed for single users to send and manage invoices for a handful of clients. You aren’t limited by the number of invoices you send on any plan, but lower-priced plans limit the clients you can bill and manage.\n\nThe Lite plan costs $19 per month and limits you to five clients, but it includes essential features to allow you to invoice and charge those clients. You can also send estimates and payment reminders, take payments and track time and expenses. Upgrading to higher tiers grants you access to advanced features, such as double-entry accounting and bank reconciliation.\n\nLearn more: Read our full FreshBooks review.\n\nWho should use it:\n\nFreshBooks was built with the freelancer in mind with its single-user access. You can add more users to your account, but it costs $10 per user, per month, at which point FreshBooks loses considerable value.\n\nPros & Cons\n\nAffordable plans and low introductory pricing\n\nFree 30-day trial\n\nIntuitive and user-friendly interface\n\nUnlimited invoices\n\nScalable for small businesses\n\nSeveral support options (phone, live chat, email)\n\nLimited clients on low tiers\n\nAdditional team member $10 per month\n\nNo free version\n\nBest for Established Businesses\n\nXero\n\n4.4\n\nOur ratings take into account a product's cost, features, ease of use, customer service and other category-specific attributes.

You get essential features that you would expect of a full-featured accounting software including unlimited customizable quotes and invoices, bill payment and bank reconciliation.\n\nXero also offers an easy way to add receipts and track expenses via Hubdoc, a proprietary system that lets you add photos, emails, documents and scans to capture data automatically. It’s also at this plan level that you can track projects, including time tracking on those projects. There’s also a section for expenses, so you can track expenses, submit and approve reimbursement claims and view expense analytics.\n\nAdditionally, the highest tier lets you create invoices and accept payments in multiple currencies, so this is a viable option for international businesses. The lowest tier is affordable, but the invoice limits are too limiting—your count applies to sending and approving invoices.\n\nLearn more: Read our full Xero review.\n\nWho should use it:\n\nXero is one of the best QuickBooks alternatives because it’s rich with features established businesses need to manage finances and projects.\n\nPros & Cons\n\nAffordable plans\n\nFree 30-day trial\n\nFeature-rich high-tier plan\n\nIntegrates with Gusto for payroll\n\nTime and project tracking on highest tier\n\n160-plus currencies for highest tier\n\nMost value on highest tier\n\nNo time tracking on low-tier plans\n\nInvoice limit applies to sending and approving invoices\n\nBest for Accounting Departments\n\nQuickBooks Online\n\n4.3\n\nOur ratings take into account a product's cost, features, ease of use, customer service and other category-specific attributes.

As we’ve pointed out, QuickBooks is the most popular accounting software, and its cloud-based subscription service offers helpful features at different plan levels. All the plans are extremely expensive compared to other options, though.\n\nFull accounting departments are likely to appreciate the comprehensive features of QuickBooks Online. You can track income and expenses, send invoices and accept payments, handle tax deductions and track receipts and mileage, which are all available on all plans. Other plans include advanced features, such as bill management and time tracking, advanced analytics and workflow automations.\n\nLearn more: Read our full QuickBooks Online review.\n\nWho should use it:\n\nGiven how expensive QuickBooks Online is, it may be best for larger businesses with full accounting departments.\n\nPros & Cons\n\nEasy to use\n\nFree 30-day trial\n\nPopular with accountants and bookkeepers\n\nFully featured at higher tiers\n\nAccept payments via QuickBooks Payments\n\nNot the most competitively priced\n\nPayroll is expensive\n\nSupport is limited\n\nBest for Managing Expenses\n\nQuicken\n\n4.1\n\nOur ratings take into account a product's cost, features, ease of use, customer service and other category-specific attributes. All ratings are determined solely by our editorial team.\n\nPricing\n\n$3.99 to $10.99 per month\n\n(billed monthly; $2.99 to $6.59 per month for the first year under current promotion)\n\nPayroll\n\nNot available\n\nTime tracking\n\nNone\n\nLearn More\n\nOn Quicken's Website\n\n$3.99 to $10.99 per month\n\n(billed monthly; $2.99 to $6.59 per month for the first year under current promotion)\n\nNot available\n\nNone\n\nEditor's Take\n\nQuicken is a great alternative to QuickBooks if you’re looking for a way to track spending. You won’t find standard business management features, such as payroll and time tracking, however. There are multiple subscription plans available starting at $3.99 per month (if paid annually), but the best option for microbusinesses is the Classic Business & Personal plan at $10.99 per month (paid annually). All of these options are available at discounts of up to 50 percent discount thanks to a current promotion available from Quicken.\n\nWith Quicken, you can create budgets, track goals and set up “what-if” scenarios for planning. Tracking expenses is easy and you can separate expenses and bills, which is helpful if you handle both your home and business expenses at the same time. This is great accounting software for those who manage rental properties.\n\nLearn more: Read our full Quicken review.\n\nWho should use it:\n\nQuicken is more for home use than business use, but it can be helpful for tracking expenses, especially when your expenses are mixed, such as for those who own and manage rental properties.\n\nPros & Cons\n\nAffordable plans starting at $3.99 per month\n\nEasy to use\n\nTrack multiple types of expenses\n\nIncludes real estate features\n\nHome & Business only for Windows users\n\nNo way to accept payments\n\nMore suitable for home expenses than business\n\nBest for Automating Accounting\n\nNetSuite\n\n4.1\n\nOur ratings take into account a product's cost, features, ease of use, customer service and other category-specific attributes. All ratings are determined solely by our editorial team.\n\nPricing\n\nBy quote only\n\n(reportedly starts at $99 per month)\n\nPayroll\n\nPaid app integration\n\nTime tracking\n\nPaid app integration\n\nLearn More\n\nRead Forbes' Review\n\nBy quote only\n\n(reportedly starts at $99 per month)\n\nPaid app integration\n\nPaid app integration\n\nEditor's Take\n\nIn a way, NetSuite is similar to Zoho in that it offers an ecosystem of apps that connect seamlessly to let you manage your finances and operations easily. The best reason to use NetSuite for accounting is to automate your processes to save you time and effort. Create an invoice and set up NetSuite to send it and collect payment automatically.\n\nTechnically, NetSuite competes more with enterprise resource planning (ERP) tools than QuickBooks. In addition to automatic invoicing and collection, you can set up automatic bill payments. There are also features to help you manage tax codes, journal entries and fixed assets.\n\nLearn more: Read our full NetSuite review.\n\nWho should use it:\n\nNetSuite is more suited for large businesses that can make use of all of its features, but most importantly, it’s a great solution for automating everything from bill payment to collecting payments from clients.\n\nPros & Cons\n\nHighly customizable\n\nAutomated features to reduce manual tasks\n\nSuitable for midsized businesses and enterprises\n\nLacks transparent pricing\n\nAdditional setup fee\n\nMay be too complex for small businesses\n\nBest for Simple Accounting\n\nSage Business Cloud Accounting\n\n4.0\n\nOur ratings take into account a product's cost, features, ease of use, customer service and other category-specific attributes. All ratings are determined solely by our editorial team.\n\nPricing\n\n$10 to $25 per month\n\n(billed monthly; pay only $7.50 for the first six months for Sage Accounting, then $25 per month afterward)\n\nPayroll\n\nPaid add-on\n\nTime tracking\n\nPaid add-on\n\nLearn More\n\nOn Sage's Website\n\n$10 to $25 per month\n\n(billed monthly; pay only $7.50 for the first six months for Sage Accounting, then $25 per month afterward)\n\nPaid add-on\n\nPaid add-on\n\nEditor's Take\n\nSage Business Cloud Accounting is a stripped-down set of accounting tools for small businesses that need an affordable and simple solution. You won’t find project- or time-tracking tools and there aren’t advanced analytics or automated workflows—for those features, you’ll need to find apps to integrate.\n\nWhat you can do with Sage Business Cloud Accounting is create and send invoices and track your payments. You can set up automatic bank reconciliation and record receipts with AutoEntry (though this is a paid add-on after your first three months). The plans are affordable for individuals and small businesses—the lowest-priced plan is $10 per month, but you’re limited to one user; the advanced plan costs $25 per month and allows unlimited users.\n\nLearn more: Read our full Sage Business Cloud Accounting review.\n\nWho should use it:\n\nSage Business Cloud Accounting is best for those who only need accounting software for simple needs, such as for invoicing and bank reconciliations.\n\nPros & Cons\n\nAffordable plans starting at $10 per month (for one user)\n\nFree one-month trial\n\nEasy to use\n\nAutomatic bank reconciliation\n\nSupports multiple currencies\n\nLacking advanced features\n\nRequires paid add-ons for time tracking\n\nCompare QuickBooks Alternatives\n\nAlternatives for QuickBooks Invoicing\n\nQuickBooks is a great option for small businesses that want full-featured accounting software but, if you’re just using it for invoicing purposes, you may want to consider an alternative. There are plenty of invoicing apps that can fill your needs at a lower cost and are less complex overall. Here are the top three alternatives to QuickBooks Invoicing:\n\nSquare Invoices\n\n4.7\n\nOur ratings take into account a product's cost, features, ease of use, customer service and other category-specific attributes. All ratings are determined solely by our editorial team.\n\nPricing\n\n$0 to $20 per month\n\nTransaction cost\n\n2.6% to 3.5% + 10 to 30 cents\n\nper transaction\n\nTime tracking\n\nFree add-on\n\n$0 to $20 per month\n\n2.6% to 3.5% + 10 to 30 cents\n\nper transaction\n\nFree add-on\n\nEditor's Take\n\nSquare Invoices is an affordable alternative to QuickBooks that gives you precisely what you need for payment processing. There’s also Square’s team management app that you can add on for free to track time for invoicing. The cloud-based solution lets you run your business wherever you are, as long as you have an internet connection.\n\nWith the paid plan, you can create custom invoices for clients and then save them as templates to access later. Square Invoices lets you create invoices for milestone payments or in full, and then you simply process the payment according to the schedule you create. Processing rates are standard for Square: 2.9% plus 30 cents for each online card payment and 2.6% plus 10 cents for card-present transactions. Online ACH payments cost 1% of the total, with a minimum of a $1 fee per transaction.\n\nSquare Invoices doesn’t limit the number of invoices you send or the number of customers or users you have on your system. If you have a team working for you, track their hours worked for invoicing purposes using Square’s free team management add-on. The only caveat with using Square Invoices is that you’ll have to pay the monthly fee to create custom invoices, save templates and set up milestone-based pay schedules.\n\nWho should use it:\n\nSquare Invoices is a great choice for almost any small business—from freelancers to small teams that need time cards to track hours.\n\nPros & Cons\n\nFree and low-priced plan\n\nFree trial available\n\nLow ACH payment cost\n\nFlat processing fees\n\nAccept payments online or in person\n\nUnlimited invoices\n\nFree time-tracking option\n\nCustomization, milestone payment and save invoice templates on paid plan only\n\nFreshBooks\n\n4.7\n\nOur ratings take into account a product's cost, features, ease of use, customer service and other category-specific attributes. All ratings are determined solely by our editorial team.\n\nPricing\n\n$19 to $60 per month\n\n(billed monthly; $7.60 to $24 per month for the first six months under current promotion)\n\nTransaction cost\n\n2.9% to 3.5% + 30 cents\n\nper transaction\n\nTime tracking\n\nAll plans\n\nLearn More\n\nOn FreshBooks’s website\n\n$19 to $60 per month\n\n(billed monthly; $7.60 to $24 per month for the first six months under current promotion)\n\n2.9% to 3.5% + 30 cents\n\nper transaction\n\nAll plans\n\nEditor's Take\n\nOne of the top reasons to pick FreshBooks as a QuickBooks alternative is its user-friendly interface. It’s intuitive and lacks the accounting industry terms you may not know as a business owner. FreshBooks doesn’t limit the number of invoices you can send, so even the low-tier plan is a viable and affordable option.\n\nPlans range from $19 to $60 per month (minus an introductory discount for the first several months), and if you accept bank transfers for payment, you’re only charged a 1% ACH fee. There’s a free trial available, so you can test FreshBooks before you commit to an annual subscription for the app. It’s also a good choice for businesses with employees who need to track billable hours—it includes time tracking on all plans.\n\nThere are some features missing from FreshBooks that you might want, such as inventory tracking and line-item accounting. Plus, the lower-priced plans limit you on the number of clients you can invoice, so for growing companies, you’ll have to choose one of the costlier plans.\n\nWho should use it:\n\nNew or small businesses would do well to pick FreshBooks for billing and tracking expenses. It’s a simple program that lets you create an unlimited number of invoices, including recurring invoices, at an affordable price.\n\nPros & Cons\n\nFree trial available\n\nRecurring invoices on all plans\n\nUnlimited invoices\n\nCustomize invoices\n\nTime tracking on all plans\n\nBuilt-in client portal\n\nLimited clients on low-priced plans\n\nRemove FreshBooks branding only on high-priced plan\n\nNo inventory tracking\n\nZoho Invoice\n\n4.6\n\nOur ratings take into account a product's cost, features, ease of use, customer service and other category-specific attributes. All ratings are determined solely by our editorial team.\n\nPricing\n\nFree\n\nTransaction cost\n\nN/A\n\n(third-party payment gateways)\n\nTime tracking\n\nIncluded\n\nLearn More\n\nRead Forbes' Review\n\nFree\n\nN/A\n\n(third-party payment gateways)\n\nIncluded\n\nEditor's Take\n\nZoho Invoice makes it easy for small businesses to go from estimate to project to invoice to payment without having to pay for the software to make it possible. Zoho Invoice is 100% free to use. The only cost to you is for transaction fees when a client pays you, and that cost comes from whichever payment processor you choose to integrate with Zoho Invoice.\n\nThe client portal makes it easy for you to communicate with your customers about custom estimates, timesheets and invoices you create. You can also set up recurring invoices for regular work or even retainer invoices for ongoing work on long-term projects. Time tracking is an included feature in Zoho Invoice, and you can turn billable hours on a project into an invoice. Perhaps the biggest downside to using this free product is that it isn’t scalable on its own. You’re limited to one user on the software and five clients total.\n\nWho should use it:\n\nZoho Invoice is most suitable for freelancers and small service-based businesses, mostly because it doesn’t include inventory tracking or full accounting features. For example, there are no balance sheets or bank reconciliation features.\n\nPros & Cons\n\nFree plan\n\nCustomize invoices\n\nSend estimates to clients for approval\n\nCreate recurring invoices\n\nSet up retainer invoices\n\nTrack expenses\n\nBuilt-in client portal\n\nChoose a payment gateway you prefer\n\nNo inventory tracking\n\nLimited to one user and five clients\n\nCompare Alternatives for QuickBooks Invoicing\n\nIs QuickBooks the Best Accounting Software?\n\nQuickBooks Pros\n\nEasy to use\n\nPopular with accountants\n\nFully featured\n\nScalable plans\n\nQuickBooks Cons\n\nAdvanced functions may be too complex for new users\n\nLimited help options\n\nWhen To Choose a Competitor Over QuickBooks\n\nEven at the lowest tier, QuickBooks Desktop and QuickBooks Online can be pricey choices compared to alternatives. QuickBooks also doesn’t provide adequate support for new users on the lower-priced plans. If your budget is low, you don’t need all the features of a full accounting program and you want more avenues for support, you may be better off choosing a QuickBooks competitor.\n\nHow To Choose Accounting Software\n\nWhether you think QuickBooks is the best choice for your small business or you think a QuickBooks alternative is better, you should make a checklist of your needs. Aside from the obvious features, such as double entry and time tracking, you should look for software that offers payroll, bill payment and is affordable for your budget.\n\nEssential Features\n\nDouble entry: Most accounting software includes an automatic double entry feature so you can record a transaction that will show as a debit and credit in the correct accounts.\n\nInvoicing: You should be able to easily create an invoice within the system that you can email to clients. Accounting software usually keeps these invoices in the system for your records.\n\nBill payment: In addition to collecting payment, you should be able to track bills and pay them from your account software for a seamless financial setup. Some apps allow users to add receipts for expenses, as well.\n\nExpense tracking: You should be able to track expenses in your accounting software so you can reimburse employees, record those debits and balance your accounts easily.\n\nBank reconciliation: Part of the reason you want accounting software is to eliminate manual work, so accounting apps often let you connect your bank accounts to the software. You can easily reconcile financial transactions from a single dashboard.\n\nTime tracking: Having time tracking within your accounting software makes it easier to run payroll (which is often also included in accounting software) for employees.\n\nPayroll: Not all accounting software includes payroll, and those that do often charge a separate fee for the feature and service. It’s helpful to have an all-in-one financial software, but even if payroll isn’t included, you should at least choose accounting software that integrates with payroll apps.\n\nIntegrations: Other than connecting your bank accounts to your accounting software, it could be helpful to integrate additional tools, such as customer relationship management (CRM) software, email marketing apps and e-commerce and inventory management software.\n\nMobile app: Some would consider a mobile accounting app a must-have feature, while others view it as a nice-to-have bonus. If you’re often working away from your office, a mobile app could be helpful—especially if you want to provide a client with an invoice on the fly or to take a payment in person.\n\nPricing\n\nOf course, you can find some free accounting software options out there, but fully featured accounting software usually comes at a cost. Accounting apps will usually set you back about $20 per month for the low tier of cloud-based solutions. Legacy software is harder to find, and even QuickBooks Desktop has moved to a subscription-based solution.\n\nCloud-based software is far more popular today and with that comes tiers for different types or sizes of businesses. So, you’re likely to find a free plan, which would be suitable for an individual, but you’ll have limits on the number of invoices you can send or you may have no access to advanced features.\n\nThe great thing about tiered subscriptions is that they scale with your business as you grow. So, you may be able to start with the lowest tier around $20 per month, but when you need to set up recurring bills or purchase orders, you could justify subscribing to a higher cost for those features. Top-tier plans can cost as much as $200 per month, but at this level, you get uncommon features, such as workflow automation, advanced analytics and dedicated customer support.\n\nFeatured Partners\n\nAdvertisement\n\n1\n\nXero\n\nStarting price\n\nReg.

At Forbes Advisor, we break down the cost, features available and the value of each software to ensure they’re best suited for small businesses. We also look at less tangible benefits, such as customer support quality and ease of use. Finally, we consider reviews from users of each platform to see how customers view the pros and cons of each accounting software.\n\nPricing\n\nFor pricing, our primary concern for an alternative software option to QuickBooks was its starting price. Those that were less expensive or comparably priced to QuickBooks fared better than those with a higher entry-level cost. Many providers are offering discounts for the first few months when purchasing an annual plan, which we also found attractive. The range of prices between plan tiers was also a consideration as was whether a provider offered a free plan or free trial of its software. Pricing accounted for 5% of our weighted scoring.\n\nFeatures\n\nAccounting software needs to be feature-laden for it to be useful for a small business, and that’s what we looked for when considering QuickBooks alternatives. For general features, which are those that we expected each software company to offer, we put an emphasis those that offered double-entry bookkeeping, payroll, time tracking, a customer portal and a mobile app as part of its plan, deducting from those providers who only offered these features as an add-on or, worse yet, not at all.\n\nThen, we looked for unique features that not every provider might offer but that we considered to be nice-to-have options for accounting software. These included multicurrency support, invoicing, bill payment, document management and offering training for the software use. Again, these were judged by whether they were included automatically in the plan, as a paid add-on or not at all. We weighted features at 55% of our total score.\n\nThird-party Reviews\n\nWe wanted to gauge the opinions of real users of these QuickBooks alternatives and turned to third-party websites to get a gauge of how these customers felt about their experiences with them. Using information gleaned from Capterra, G2 and Trustpilot, we looked for highly scored reviews (those received that were at least 3.5 out of 5) from real users to give us the fullest picture of these providers. These reviews accounted for 5% of the final score.\n\nExpert Analysis\n\nAfter looking at all of the data we gathered, our experts ranked additional criteria from customer reviews by looking at key factors that included ease of use, stand-out features, popularity and value for the money to come up with a final rating. These criteria made up 35% of the total score."
