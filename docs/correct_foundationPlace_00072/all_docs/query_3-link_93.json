        "text": "Intuit provides card and other payment processing services (“MerchantPayment Services”), which will enable you to collect payment from your customers. When we enable you to collect payments from your customers, we act as your agent pursuant to this Part F to collect the funds from your customers on your behalf. When we collect payments from your customer on your behalf, your customer's obligation to pay you is satisfied and we agree to remit the funds received by us on your behalf, pursuant to this Part F. When transferring funds Intuit receives from one of your customers to you for the Merchant Payment Services, Intuit’s obligation with respect to such funds shall be deemed satisfied when your bank actually credits your account with the funds received from your customer.\n\nIf you use the Merchant Payment Services, the following additional terms in this Part F apply, including the terms incorporated by reference (the “Merchant Payment Terms”):\n\nF.1 Eligibility. The Merchant Payment Services are available only in Canada. To be eligible to use the Merchant Payment Services, you: must not be domiciled, reside, or have a principal place of business outside Canada; must not be engaged in any illegal activity or any activity reasonably likely to cause notoriety, harm, or damage to the reputation of Intuit, our sponsor banks, or card or payment networks (such as VISA, MasterCard, Discover, Payments Canada, and Apple Pay); must not be listed on a VISA Terminated Merchant File, MasterCard MATCH, or any other third party or governmental prohibited merchant or individual lists; and must comply with our Acceptable Use Policy. If previously identified by VISA risk programs, you must self-disclose when the identification occurred and under what specific programs. You may only use the Merchant Payment Services for the business and purpose described by you in your Merchant Application (see Section F.5 below).\n\nF.2 Your Personal Guarantee. Intuit requires that a principal or owner of the business (the “Guarantor”) accept this Agreement, including the Merchant Payment Terms, and personally guarantee all obligations of the business under this Agreement, including the Merchant Payment Terms. You are confirming that you are either a principal or owner of your business and/or are authorized to act on the business’ and the Guarantor’s behalf. You agree that the Guarantor is providing a personal guarantee under this Agreement, including the Merchant Payment Terms. This personal guarantee is a general, continuing, absolute, and irrevocable guarantee for payment of monies owed by the business to Intuit. You agree and understand we may proceed directly against the Guarantor without first exhausting our remedies against the business entity. Intuit’s decision to enter into the Merchant Payment Terms and provide the Merchant Payment Services is conditioned on the Guarantor's personal financial stability, and the Guarantor hereby authorizes us to conduct any necessary identity and credit checks at any time, be it during the application process or throughout the term of this Agreement for Merchant Payment Services, to determine the Guarantor’s creditworthiness. Late payments, missed payments, non-payments, and other defaults on your Merchant Account will be reflected in your business’ credit report and/or the Guarantor’s personal or individual credit report. Intuit may, in its sole discretion, accept another form of guarantee, such as a bank letter of credit, in lieu of the personal guarantee specified above.\n\nF.3 Verification; Credit Checks. You agree and authorize us (directly or through third parties) to make any inquiries we consider necessary to verify your identity and account information, or to determine your current and ongoing creditworthiness. This may include asking you to confirm your email address, mobile/phone numbers, or bank accounts, or by verifying your information against third-party databases (including by obtaining your individual and business credit report, personal profile, or other information from one or more third-party databases). If you are a QuickBooks merchant, you agree that we may access and use your QuickBooks account information for underwriting, identity verification, or fraud analysis purposes, including information that relates to your credit confirmation, and if applicable, your financial statements, information regarding beneficial ownership and verification from the applicable governmental authorities of your corporation’s legal existence. Additionally, you agree that your bank and the consumer reporting agencies may release any and all individual and business credit and financial information to us at our request. You further authorize us to disclose any information obtained from any source (including credit reports) to any governmental, administrative, or regulatory entity, our respective vendors and affiliates, within or outside of Canada, for fraud or verification purposes, any third party to the extent such parties provide Merchant Payment Services to you or us, or to comply with applicable laws or investigation, including, without limitation, the Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act, Canada’s Anti-Spam Legislation (CASL), and USA PATRIOT Act. You acknowledge and agree that we may request that you provide additional information at any time, for the purposes of verifying your identity or current or ongoing credit worthiness including but not limited to: a copy of a government-issued ID (such as a passport or driver's license); your business license; taxpayer ID number; financial or bank statements; or your personal or business tax returns.\n\nF.4 Participating Sponsor Banks; Commercial Entity Agreements. You acknowledge and agree that these Merchant Payment Terms are between you and Intuit, not with any other third party (including, but not limited to, any card or payment network such as MasterCard, VISA, Discover, Payments Canada, Apple Pay, or any of our sponsor banks), however, these third parties are third-party beneficiaries of this Agreement with respect to the Merchant Payment Services. In order to provide you with payment processing services, we have entered into agreements with card networks, processors and acquiring banks, as well as third party payment service providers (including nanopay) in order to facilitate the processing of payment through electronic funds transfer, credit and debit (each, a “third party provider”). We may require that you enter into separate and direct agreements (a “Commercial Entity Agreement”) with one or more of our sponsor banks or card networks if your processing volume exceeds certain threshold amounts. A copy of the Commercial Entity Agreement can be found in our Legal Documents page which shall be in effect, and considered accepted by you, upon your exceeding such threshold amounts. In certain circumstances, new pricing terms, including but not limited to card processing rates and fees, may apply. You agree that our sponsor bank and all parties to a Commercial Entity Agreement may rely on the information you provided in your Merchant Application for approval and underwriting of your Commercial Entity Agreement. Terms of the Commercial Entity Agreement will govern your use of the specific services contemplated under the Commercial Entity Agreement. Intuit retains the right to suspend or terminate your account if you fail to agree to enter an applicable Commercial Entity Agreement.\n\nF.5 Merchant Application; Updating Your Information. You must complete a payment processing services application (“Merchant Application”) and be approved by our underwriting system prior to your use of the Merchant Services. Once approved, you will be issued a Merchant Account (see Section F.10 below). You agree that the information you provided in the Merchant Application (or otherwise requested by Intuit as part of an application or investigation process) is true, accurate, and complete. You agree to update us on an ongoing basis with: a list of principals, owners, or officers for your business including their home addresses, personal and business telephone numbers, and email addresses; all “Doing Business As” (DBA) names used by you; your business address and telephone number; the URL (web address) for your business; and a complete description of goods and services provided by your business. If the scope or nature of your business, or the type of products or services you offer changes, you agree to notify us prior to such change. You are liable to us for all losses and expenses incurred by us arising out of your failure to report any changes to us. You consent to us updating your information from time to time based on information provided by your bank or other third party providers. Intuit reserves the right to immediately terminate the Agreement or suspend your access to the Merchant Payment Services in the event of any unreported change in information you previously provided to us or if we reasonably determine that the information previously provided is no longer current.\n\nF.6 Pricing and Payment. For a list of rates and fees, see the Pricing Schedule. In the event of any conflict between the terms of these Merchant Payment Terms and the Pricing Schedule, these Merchant Payment Terms shall control. All rates and fees are in Canadian dollars and subject to change. Where you may become subject to any (a) increase in rates or fees related to credit or debit card transactions, (b) introduction of a new fee related to credit or debit card transactions, or (c) a reduction in applicable interchange rates, we will provide at least ninety (90) days’ advance notice in writing. We will provide ninety (90) days’ advance notice for all other increases in rates and fees. If you do not consent to the increase in rates or fees or if applicable interchange rates are decreased and such reduced rates are not passed on to you, you are entitled to terminate this Agreement without penalty. If you are a Quebec Consumer, the Changes provision of Section 24 in Section A applies to you. For all changes, we may provide you notice by posting updated pricing or terms on our website or sending you email communication. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the Section A Terms, price changes are effective on the date indicated on our notice or posted terms. By continuing to access and use the Merchant Payment Services after we have provided you any price changes, you are agreeing to such changes. All fees due in connection with the Merchant Payment Service are non-refundable, whether such fees are set-up fees, transaction fees, monthly subscription fees, or other fees. You may incur price increases should you request changes to Merchant Payment Services offerings, including, without limitation, moving Merchant Payment Services from QuickBooks Online to QuickBooks Desktop, and notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the Section A Terms, you agree to pay the increased fee starting on the date of confirmation of your Merchant Payment Services offering change. You agree to immediately pay us all fees set forth in your Merchant Application, the Pricing Schedule, and/or in other provisions of these Merchant Payment Terms. You agree that you will also be responsible for any Chargebacks and any fees, fines, or penalties assessed to us or to you by any card or payment network as a consequence of your use or misuse of the Merchant Payment Services or your card processing activities. You agree that we may collect fees and other amounts owed under these Merchant Payment Terms by different means, including but not limited to netting against the proceeds of your processing activity; debiting your Bank Account, Reserve Account, or any other account you may have at any financial institution; or exercising any other legal rights and remedies we may have under law or equity. You agree, unless you are a Quebec Consumer, that we may collect reasonable fees (including attorney’s fees) arising out of, or related to, our efforts to collect fees or other amounts from you. If you wish to dispute payment to, or collection by Intuit of any fee, you must provide written notice of such dispute within forty-five (45) days after you received a statement containing the fee, as described in Section F.14 below.\n\nF.7 Limits. We may establish processing limits and assign a maximum dollar amount per transaction and/or an aggregate maximum dollar amount per calendar month (or any other time period we designate) that you may process using the Merchant Payment Services. You may request an increase in your per transaction limit or your aggregate processing volume by submitting a request to us. Any increase shall be at our sole discretion, and we reserve the right to reverse and decrease any maximum amounts previously authorized. Any increase granted by us may be conditional upon and require the establishment of a Reserve Account (defined in Section F.12 below). You agree that your activity will remain consistent with approved processing limits. Intuit or an applicable third party provider may require additional documentation if you exceed your approved processing limits and you agree to promptly provide such documentation upon request. You agree that Intuit or a third party provider, as applicable, may, in its sole discretion, elect not to process transactions over your approved aggregate processing volume or per-transactions limits, and/or to suspend or terminate your Merchant Account in the event of over-limit transactions.\n\nF.8 Settlement of Transactions. Intuit will accept all valid transactions processed by you under these Merchant Payment Terms and shall present the same to the appropriate financial institution for collection against your customer's or payor's account. Settlement of all transactions is subject to these Merchant Payment Terms and applicable Rules. Intuit may provisionally credit to you the value of a processed transaction but reserves the right to adjust amounts credited to you to reflect the value of Chargebacks, fees, penalties, the difference in currency exchange if the Chargeback amount is greater than the original sale, issuer claims, and items for which Intuit did not receive final payment for any reason. We may refuse to accept any transaction or revoke our prior acceptance or settlement of a transaction in the following circumstances: (a) the transaction resulting in a receipt that was not made in compliance with all the terms and conditions of these Merchant Payment Terms; (b) a customer or payor disputes their liability for any reason, including but not limited to those Chargeback rights provided in the applicable Rules; (c) a transaction resulting in a receipt that was not directly between you and a cardholder or payor; or (d) a transaction that is outside the parameters indicated on the Merchant Application. You agree to pay for any amount previously credited to you and not accepted or later revoked by Intuit. Intuit will not be liable for any claims or damages arising from your use of any third parties, including service providers who submit your transactions to us on your behalf. Intuit does not recommend or endorse any third parties even if such provider is using our API's (Application Programming Interface) to access your information or deliver you services. You authorize Intuit to share your information with nanopay and acknowledge that you will be subject to the nanopay Terms of Service and privacy policy, and Intuit will not be able to control their use of your data. You acknowledge that in some circumstances an applicable third party provider, including nanopay, can contact you directly in connection with the Merchant Payment Services. Additionally, the third party provider's operations, service performance, or restrictions may impact the Merchant Payment Services. You acknowledge that Intuit is not responsible for acts of any third party, including any delays, security breaches, or any failure to settle transactions with you due to reasons not within our control, such as inaccurate information or fraud.\n\nF.9 Payment Instrument; Business PAD Agreement. You will need to establish and maintain a debit-enabled account (“Payment Instrument”) at a Canadian depository financial institution of your choice to facilitate payment of fees to Intuit and the transfer of amounts due to you from your Merchant Account. You irrevocably authorize Intuit, our sponsor banks and any other applicable third party provider to immediately debit your Payment Instrument for any and all fraudulent transactions, any negative balance in your Merchant Account, for current and past due fees, payment equipment rentals/purchases, fines, penalties, or any amounts you owe us under these Merchant Payment Terms. You agree that Intuit shall not incur any liability for any loss, costs, or fees incurred by you that are the result of such debits by us. We may, for our purposes or on behalf of a third party provider take reasonable steps to verify your Payment Instrument information, for example, by requiring you to provide us a cancelled check or by debiting and crediting micro-deposits into your Payment Instrument, including on a recurring basis. You agree that you will not change your Payment Instrument without our prior consent, which will not be unreasonably withheld. If you do not obtain such prior consent, Intuit may immediately terminate this Agreement.\n\nBy putting your Payment Instrument on file with Intuit Canada ULC, you agree to this pre-authorized debit agreement (“PAD Agreement”). This PAD Agreement is an electronic pre-authorized debit agreement that you are entering into for business purposes to allow us to debit your designated bank account, and is subject to the rules of Payments Canada. Filling out the fields with your personal information is your consent for its use as an electronic signature, only for this PAD Agreement.\n\nYou authorize us, nanopay X-Border Corporation, and your financial institution, to debit your Payment Instrument for any amounts arising from your use of our Merchant Payment Services, including daily for recurring, variable transaction fees (as incurred) and from time to time for any other fee, chargeback, refund or any other fine, penalty or other amount that may be owing by you pursuant to these Merchant Payment Terms (such as NSF fees and other fees listed in Table 3 above). These amounts will change depending on the Merchant Payment Services provided to you. You acknowledge and agree that payments made under this PAD Agreement may be for different amounts and on various dates and that when any amounts become due by you under these Merchant Payment Terms, you instruct and authorize us, nanopay X-Border Corporation and your financial institution to debit your designated bank account for such amounts on such due date, or if such date is on a weekend or statutory holiday, on the next business day. We may provide you with notice prior to charging you but, to the extent possible under applicable law, YOU WAIVE ANY RIGHT TO RECEIVE ADVANCE NOTICE OF EACH PREAUTHORIZED CHARGE.\n\nIf payment using this Payment Instrument fails for any reason, you authorize us to charge other payment instruments you may have on file with Intuit under the terms of this PAD Agreement. You can change your Payment Instrument in your account settings. We may amend this PAD Agreement on notice of at least 30 days and your continued use of Merchant Payment Services constitutes your acceptance of amended terms.\n\nThe authorization in this PAD Agreement will remain in place as long as you use our Merchant Payment Services, cancel this PAD Agreement by contacting us, or revoke your PAD Authorization on written notice of at least 30 days at 8 Spadina Ave. Suite 1900, Toronto, ON M5V 0S8, Canada Attn: Customer Care. By cancelling this PAD Agreement, you agree to cancel your use of our Merchant Payment Services. We may also cancel this PAD Agreement at any time upon notice to you. Cancellation is not effective until we, as well as the provider of your Payment Instrument, reasonably can act on it. Cancellation of this PAD Agreement does not relieve you of your obligation to pay us for all owed amounts. You may obtain a sample cancellation form, or further information on your right to cancel a PAD Agreement, at your financial institution or by visiting www.payments.ca.\n\nYou have certain recourse rights if any debit does not comply with this agreement. For example, you have the right to receive reimbursement for a debit that is not authorized or is not consistent with this PAD Agreement. To obtain more information on your recourse rights, you may contact your financial institution or visit www.payments.ca. The choice of law and dispute resolution provisions set forth in Section A of the Agreement govern.\n\nF.10 Your Merchant Account. Following approval of your Merchant Application, you must open a merchant service account with us (“Merchant Account”) to use the Merchant Payment Services. The proceeds from your card and other payment transactions processed using the Merchant Payment Services (“Settlement Funds”) will be recorded in your Merchant Account before we transfer funds to your Bank Account. Settlement Funds do not constitute a deposit you have with us, will bear no interest, and are not eligible for insurance with the Canada Deposit Insurance Corporation (the “CDIC”).\n\nF.11 Intuit Security Interest. These Merchant Payment Terms will constitute a security agreement under the relevant Personal Property Security Act in the province in which you reside, and if you reside in the Province of Québec, these Merchant Payment Terms will constitute a hypothec and pledge under the Civil Code of Québec. If you owe a debt to us, either now or in the future, you grant a security interest in (and, for the purposes of the laws of the Province of Québec, you hypothecate and pledge) all of your various accounts (standing in the name of Merchant and Guarantor alone or in a joint account, including any affiliated companies of Merchant and Guarantor, whether established or maintained pursuant to these Merchant Payment Terms or not), including all funds credited thereto and all monetary claims relating to such funds, to us to secure any such debt. You agree that we may use funds in any of your accounts to pay all or part of any debt you owe to us. You irrevocably consent to Intuit using any means available to locate any such accounts until such time all amounts due have been paid. You grant to us a security interest in and lien upon (and, for the purposes of the laws of the Province of Québec, a hypothec and pledge on): (a) all funds representing amounts owing to you at any time under these Merchant Payment Terms or any other agreement between us from your Merchant Account, regardless of the source of such funds, and all monetary claims relating to such funds; (b) all funds at any time in the Reserve Account, regardless of the source of such funds, and all monetary claims relating to such funds; (c) present and future card or other payment transactions; (d) all funds at any time in your Bank Account, regardless of the source of such funds, and all monetary claims relating to such funds; (e) your electronic terminal, printer, imprinter and imprinter plate; and (f) any amounts that may be due to you, or that may become due to you, under this these Merchant Payment Terms or any other agreement between us, including, without limitation all rights to receive any payments or credits under these Merchant Payment Terms and all monetary claims and other claims relating to such amounts (collectively (a) – (f), the “Secured Assets”). Upon our request, you agree to provide additional security interests, hypothecs, pledges and liens so required to secure your obligations under these Merchant Payment Terms. These security interests, hypothecs, pledges and liens granted hereby will secure all of your obligations under these Merchant Payment Terms and any other agreements now existing or later entered into between you and us, including but not limited to, your obligation to pay any amounts due and owing to us. We may exercise and enforce these security interests, hypothecs, pledges and liens without notice or demand of any kind to you, including but not limited to, by making immediate withdrawals from, or freezing of, your Secured Assets. Upon our request, you agree to execute one or more financing statements or other documents as applicable to evidence our security interests, hypothecs, pledges and liens, and agree that we may file or record any such financing statements or related or similar documents as may be applicable. You represent and warrant that no other person or entity has any security interest in and you have not hypothecated and pledged any of the Secured Assets. With respect to our security interests, hypothecs, pledge and liens, we will have all rights afforded under the applicable personal property security act (and for the purposes of the laws of the Province of Québec, the Civil Code of Québec), other applicable law or in equity. You must obtain written consent from us prior to granting a security interest of any kind in or a hypothec or pledge on any of the Secured Assets to any third party. You authorize and appoint us as your attorney-in-fact (and in the Province of Québec, as your mandatary) to sign your name to any financing statements or other documents used in connection with any security interests, hypothecs, pledge and liens granted hereunder. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in these Merchant Payment Terms, the laws of the Province of Québec will apply to the grant of the hypothec and pledge herein. The hypothec and pledge granted by you to us above are granted for an amount of CAD$100,000. The foregoing amount of the hypothec is set herein to satisfy the requirements of the law in Québec and may not always reflect the actual amount of your obligations to us. You further consent that all funds held in the Reserve Account, any monetary claim related to such funds and any other monetary claim that you have against us shall secure all of your obligations under these Merchant Payment Terms and any other agreements now existing or later entered into between you and us, including but not limited to, your obligation to pay any amounts due and owing to us.\n\nF.12 Reserve Account. Upon our request and for the purpose of providing a source of funds to pay us for amounts you owe, you agree that we may place in an account, maintained and solely controlled by us, initially or at any time in the future, sums sufficient to satisfy your current and/or future obligations (“Reserve Account”). You agree that we shall have the right to hold funds in such Reserve Account as long as we deem necessary. We may, at any time, require that the amount on deposit in the Reserve Account be increased, and we shall have sole discretion as to the amount needed in the Reserve Account. Your obligation to maintain a Reserve Account shall survive termination of this Agreement for a minimum period of two hundred and seventy (270) days or longer after the termination date or after the date of your last transaction, depending on your product and business practices. After such time, any balance that remains in the Reserve Account will be returned to you unless the funds are subject to an investigation related to potential fraudulent transactions, or if such funds are subject to lien demands related to the applicable personal property security act, tax levies, enforcement of judgment proceedings, restraining notices, or other legal process or demands made or known to us. Unless expressly agreed in writing, the Reserve Account will not bear interest. Intuit shall have the right to debit funds in the Merchant Account, Bank Account, or any other deposit account maintained by you (Merchant or Guarantor) to establish, increase, or maintain funds in the Reserve Account. We may deposit into the Reserve Account funds we otherwise would be obligated to pay you, for the purpose of establishing, increasing, or maintaining the Reserve Account in accordance with this Section F.12, if we determine such action is reasonably necessary to protect our interests. You understand and agree that if you are required to establish a Reserve Account, you have an obligation under these Merchant Payment Terms to maintain at all times a balance in the Reserve Account determined by us that is sufficient to protect us against any actual or potential losses resulting from any payment transactions initiated by you, from any claims asserted against you, your Merchant Account, or your Reserve Account, and from any claims asserted against us, or any relevant third parties, based on your conduct related to these Merchant Payment Terms. We may, without notice to you, apply funds deposited in your Reserve Account against any outstanding amounts you owe to us under these Merchant Payment Terms or under any other agreement between you and us. Also, we may debit your Reserve Account to exercise our rights under these Merchant Payment Terms to collect any amounts due to us, including without limitation, rights of recoupment and set-off.\n\nF.13 Intuit Right of Recoupment and Set-off. To the extent permitted by law, Intuit shall have the right of recoupment and set-off under these Merchant Payment Terms. This means that we may offset any outstanding or uncollected amounts owed to us from: (a) any amounts owed to you that we otherwise would be obligated to deposit into your Merchant Account; (b) any other amounts we may owe you under these Merchant Payment Terms or any other agreement; (c) the Bank Account which you may have associated with your Merchant Account; and (d) the Reserve Account. You acknowledge that in the event of a bankruptcy, insolvency or any other liquidation, conservatorship, assignment for the benefit of creditors, moratorium, receivership, arrangement or other similar proceeding, in order to preserve or substitute value where pre-existing security is diminished by the granting of prior ranking charges to secure debtor-in-possession or interim financing, court ordered administration or other charges, or where pre-existing security is otherwise diminished, you must create, maintain, or increase the amounts in a Reserve Account as required by us, and we will have the right to offset and recoup against the Reserve Account for any and all obligations which you may owe to us, without regard to whether the obligations relate to payment transactions initiated or created before or after the filing of the bankruptcy petition, to the fullest extent permitted by law.\n\nF.14 Billing Errors; Your Right to Request Investigation. If you suspect an error in your payment transaction statement or history, you must notify us in writing. You must include in your written request for investigation: (a) your name; (b) business name; (c) Bank Account number; (d) the dollar amount of the asserted error; (e) a description of the asserted error; and (f) an explanation of why you believe an error exists and the cause of it, if known. Intuit must receive your written notice within forty-five (45) days after you received a statement containing the asserted error. If you fail to notify us within forty-five (45) days, you will be deemed to have accepted the fees and charges as set forth in the applicable statement and we will have no obligation to investigate the error or refund any such amounts to you. We will advise you of the results of our investigation if we conduct one, and if we have made an error, we will correct it promptly. If we determine that there was no error, we will send you an explanation of the determination. You may ask for copies of the documents that we used in our investigation.\n\nF.15 Chargebacks. Customers may dispute transactions, which may lead to a payment transaction being reversed or returned, otherwise known as a “Chargeback.” Intuit does not decide what transactions are charged back and Intuit does not determine the ultimate resolution of a Chargeback. Your customers may be able to successfully charge back a transaction even though you have provided your goods or services to the customer. You are responsible for all Chargebacks and will be liable to us for the total amount of any sale for which a customer disputes the validity of the sale, plus any applicable Chargeback fees imposed by us or a third party provider, including VISA and MasterCard chargeback arbitration fees. You authorize us to offset from incoming transactions and to debit your Merchant Account, Bank Account, and/or the Reserve Account to recover any Chargebacks plus any applicable Chargeback fees imposed by us or a third party provider, including VISA and MasterCard chargeback arbitration fees. You agree to fully cooperate with us in complying with the Rules (as said term is defined in Section F.19 below) regarding Chargebacks, including any request for documentation. We may suspend the Merchant Payment Services and stop releasing funds until you reimburse us for all unpaid Chargebacks. You must not re-enter or reprocess any payment transaction that has been charged back.\n\nF.16 Excessive Chargebacks. Excessive Chargebacks are a breach of these Merchant Payment Terms and this Agreement and cause for immediate termination of the Merchant Payment Services, as well as additional excess Chargeback fees that might be imposed by our sponsor banks and card or payment network. “Excessive Chargebacks” means chargebacks during any monthly period and for any one of your terminal identification numbers or merchant identification numbers, including: (a) Chargebacks and/or retrieval requests in excess of 1% of the average monthly dollar amount of transactions; (b) processing a transaction conducted in the ordinary course of business above the processing limits or amount approved by us. You authorize us, upon the occurrence of Excessive Chargebacks, to take additional actions we may deem necessary, including, but not limited to, suspension of the Merchant Payment Services or creation or maintenance of a Reserve Account in accordance with these Merchant Payment Terms. You acknowledge and agree that Intuit may be required to report your name to law enforcement and any other third party including but not limited to the card or payment networks, such as for inclusion into VISA Terminated Merchant File, MasterCard MATCH, or any other prohibited merchant list in the event of fraud, counterfeit, unauthorized transactions, highly suspect activity, Chargebacks, Excessive Chargebacks, or if we terminate your access to the Merchant Payment Services. You agree to such reporting and waive any claims against Intuit as a result of such reporting.\n\nF.17 Unusual Activity; Holds; Risk Reviews.

Unusual activity includes, but is not limited to: (a) changes in your average transaction amount or processing pattern; (b) monthly percentage of different transaction types; or (c) Excessive Chargebacks. We may, in our sole discretion, place holds on your transactions or Merchant Account to otherwise protect against potential risk or fraud.

You understand and agree that our evaluation of risk may result in your ineligibility for certain Merchant Payment Services, such as those enabling faster funding than standard deposit timing. We will notify you in the event that you do not qualify for these Merchant Payment Services and/or if you later become eligible. Intuit or an applicable third party provider reserves the right, in its sole discretion, to review and either clear or cancel the transaction. If a transaction is cleared, Intuit will provide notice to you. Otherwise, Intuit will cancel the transaction and Settlement Funds may be returned. Intuit or any applicable third party provider will have no liability for any losses, either direct or indirect, which you may attribute to any hold, review, or other delay or suspension of fund disbursement. If we or a third party provider hold or review a batch transaction, you acknowledge that the customer's product or service must be delivered just as if you have been paid. Further, if a batch or a transaction is subject to a hold or review, you acknowledge that fees associated with the transactions will be charged.\n\nF.18 Acceptable Use Policy; Other Intuit Policies.

If you accept payment by web (“IO”), phone (“TO”), mail (“MO”), or pre-authorized (“PO”) order, a transaction receipt may be completed without the cardholder's or payor’s signature or an imprint, but in such case, you agree to create a receipt containing the card number, expiration date, transaction date, an authorization number, the sale amount, and the letters \"IO\",\"TO\", \"MO\", or \"PO\" as appropriate. Your name and the city and province of your business must also be included. Receiving an electronic authorization shall not relieve you of liability for Chargebacks on any transaction for which you did not obtain an imprint and the cardholder's signature. You agree to use reasonable procedures to mitigate payment card and identity fraud. If a product is being shipped, your customer must be given the shipping date of the product once the sale is processed.

When accepting a credit or debit card, you agree to: (a) determine whether the card is valid; (b) obtain an electronic approval or authorization (see Section F.26 below) before completing a sale, or obtain an imprint of the card (including cardholder's signature) unless a receipt is electronically generated from a swiped transaction or is the result of a web, phone, mail, or preauthorized order; (c) have reasonable practices in place to verify the cardholder's or payor's identity; (d) deliver a copy of the customer receipt to the cardholder or payor at the time of delivery of the goods or performance of the services or point of sale; and (e) be able to reproduce without alteration a legible receipt containing the cardholder's name, account number, expiration date, and your business name and location. You may establish a minimum transaction amount for accepting credit card transactions so long as such amount does not exceed CAD $10.00, or other amount established by law, and such minimum transaction size requirement does not discriminate between card networks. You may not require a minimum transaction amount for debit card transactions. You may offer discounts or in-kind incentives for payment by the use of cash, checks, debit cards, or credit cards, and the terms of the discount or in-kind incentives may differentiate on the basis of the issuer of the card or payment network. Any discounts must be clearly marked at the point-of-sale. You shall not accept a card as payment (other than for a mail order, telephone order, or preauthorized sale to the extent permitted under these Merchant Payment Terms) if the cardholder seeking to use the card does not present the card to permit you to examine it and obtain an imprint or otherwise use the physical card to complete the transaction.\n\nF.25 Your Return Policy; Adjustments, Credit Vouchers.

Disclosures must be made on all receipt copies in letters approximately 1/4\" high in close proximity to the space provided for the customer's or payor's signature on the sales or transaction receipt, and issued at the time of sale. If you do not make these disclosures, a full refund in the form of a credit to the customer's or payor's account must be given. You agree not to refund cash to a customer or payor who paid for the item by card. You must provide a credit to the same card on which the original transaction was processed. If you accept any goods for return or terminate or cancel any services, in conjunction with each such transaction, you agree to have sufficient funds in your Merchant, Reserve, or Bank Accounts to which we have access to cover the amount of the transaction and any related fees.\n\nF.26 Proper Electronic and Customer Authorization; Customer Receipts with Respect to Credit, Debit and Electronic Funds Transfer. You must obtain electronic authorization for all electronic funds transfer, credit and debit card transactions. If you cannot, for any reason, obtain an electronic authorization, you must request a voice authorization from a designated authorization center, and legibly print the authorization number on the customer receipt and on your copy of the receipt. You may not attempt to obtain an electronic authorization on a closed bank account and/or an expired credit or debit card. All transactions using an expired or otherwise invalid card may not be processed and the transaction will be deemed invalid. You agree to use reasonable efforts to retain or recover a card when receiving instructions upon making a request for an electronic authorization to retain a customer's card. In carrying out such obligation, you agree not to breach the peace or cause any injury to any account holder, cardholder, person, or property. You must also obtain a customer's or payor's authorization via methods acceptable to us or third parties and in accordance with the Rules prior to completing any card or payment transaction. You must follow any instructions received during the authorization process. Upon receipt of authorization, you may consummate only the transaction authorized. Where authorization is obtained, you will be deemed to have warranted the true identity of the customer as the account holder, cardholder, check writer, or payor. Transactions will be deemed invalid on cards that are expired whether or not an authorization has been obtained. Authorizations are not a guarantee of acceptance or payment of a transaction and do not waive any provision of these Merchant Payment Terms or otherwise validate a fraudulent transaction or a transaction involving the use of an expired card or other payment instrument. We or an applicable third party provider may refuse to authorize any transaction, and we and such third party provider are not liable to you if authorization for a transaction is not given. You will not have any claim against, or right to receive payment from an account holder, cardholder, payor, or customer in any payment transaction if we or an applicable third party provider refuse to authorize the transaction for any reason. You further agree to deliver to a customer, cardholder, account holder or payor at the time of the transaction a complete and legible receipt from a payment transaction or refund. You must retain the merchant copy of the receipt and/or confirmation in accordance with the applicable Rules and information security and confidentiality requirements for at least three (3) years following the date of completion of a card or other payment transaction (or a longer period if the Rules require).\n\nF.27 Records; Requests for Copies. You must retain a copy of all customer receipts and/or confirmations and return/credit receipts and/or confirmations for at least three (3) years after the date of a payment transaction. Within three (3) business days of your receipt of any written or verbal request by our sponsor bank, our card or payment network, any of our third party providers or us, you agree to provide a copy of any requested transaction receipt. Your failure to deliver the requested documentation in the required timeframe may result in the transaction in question being charged back or us refusing to process said transaction.\n\nF.28 Policy Violations; Action Upon Termination for Cause. If Intuit incurs any damages because you violate our policies, these Merchant Payment Terms, the Rules, any applicable laws, or otherwise cause Intuit to incur any expenses, we may terminate this Agreement and: (a) hold your funds up to two hundred and seventy (270) days; (b) fine you for each such violation; and (c) take legal action against you to recover additional losses, investigation costs, fines, or legal fees we may incur. Unless you are a Quebec Consumer, you acknowledge and agree that a fine of CAD $2,500.00 (“Set Damages”) for violations of these Merchant Payment Terms is presently a reasonable minimum estimate of Intuit's damages. This Set Damages amount is only applicable where Intuit is not fined or charged a penalty or fine by a third party for your violations; where Intuit is fined or charged a penalty or fine by a third party, Intuit may pass on those fines or penalties to you plus an administrative fee of CAD $500 per fine or penalty. Intuit may deduct the Set Damages and any fines, penalties, and fees directly from any existing balance in any account, including your Merchant Account, Bank Account, or Reserve Account.\n\nF.29 Data Security (PCI Compliance); Payor/Cardholder Personal Information. The card networks (such as VISA and MasterCard) and the payment networks (such as Payments Canada) have similar standards for protecting sensitive payment information and cardholder or payor data. For example, the Payment Cards Industry Data Security Standards (“PCI DSS”) define the requirements that all entities that store, process, or transmit payment card data must comply with. You must ensure you have data security policies and processes in place to protect cardholder and payor payment and personal data in compliance with PCI DSS and Payments Canada security requirements. You must keep all systems and media containing account, customer, or transaction information (physical or electronic, including but not limited to account numbers and card imprints) in a secure manner to prevent access by or disclosure to anyone other than your authorized personnel. You must destroy in a manner that will render the data unreadable all such media that you no longer deem necessary or appropriate to store (except for receipts maintained in accordance with this Agreement (including these Merchant Payment Terms), laws, Rules, and policies). Further, you must take all steps reasonably necessary to ensure cardholder or payor payment information is not disclosed or otherwise misused. You may not require a cardholder to complete a postcard or similar document that includes the cardholder’s account number, card expiration date, signature, or any other cardholder account data in plain view when mailed. You may not retain or store magnetic stripe or CVV2, CVC2, or CID data after authorization. You agree that in the event of a breach, unauthorized access or compromise of payor or cardholder data, you will immediately notify us and provide us with detailed information relating to the breach or compromise. You may not request or use a cardholder or payor account number for any purpose other than as payment for its good or services rendered. You may not require cardholders to provide any personal information as a condition of honoring a card unless such information is required for delivery of the goods or services, or you have reason to believe that the person presenting a card may not be the actual cardholder. You agree that any service providers you may use for accessing, storing, transmitting, and processing cardholder data on behalf of Intuit in accordance with the record keeping requirements of this Agreement (including these Merchant Payment Terms), or any service provider you may use that controls or could impact the security of cardholder data, must be registered as authorized agents and Intuit must be notified of them. Furthermore, all agents must acknowledge compliance with PCI DSS.\n\nAdditionally, if you receive a user identification name or password from us to access our database or use the Merchant Payment Services (the “Account Access Password”), you will: (a) keep the Account Access Password confidential; (b) not allow any other entity or person to use the Account Access Password or gain access to our database; (c) be liable for all action taken by any user of the Account Access Password; and (d) promptly notify us if you believe the Account Access Password has been used inappropriately, or the confidentiality of the information made available through such use has been compromised.\n\nYou agree that any loss incurred as a result of any party gaining access to your Bank Account or Merchant Account or our website using information which that party was not authorized to obtain or using such information in a manner not permitted by these Merchant Payment Terms (including but not limited to improper or unauthorized use of the Account Access Password) shall be your responsibility.\n\nF.30 Your Insolvency; Bankruptcy. You must immediately notify us of your insolvency or of any bankruptcy, receivership, assignment for the benefit of creditors, or similar action or proceeding initiated by or against you, whether or not such action or proceeding is under court supervision. Unless prohibited by applicable law, we have the right to terminate this Agreement upon the commencement of any such of these actions or proceedings, or upon your insolvency. You will include us on the list and matrix of creditors as filed with the Bankruptcy Court or as filed or submitted in any other insolvency-related action or proceeding, whether or not a claim by us may exist at the time of filing or commencement of such proceeding; failure to do so will also be cause for immediate termination of this Agreement or for any other action available to us under this Agreement, under applicable Rules, or under applicable law. You acknowledge that this Agreement constitutes an executory contract to make a loan, or extend other debt financing or financial accommodations to or for the benefit of you, and, as such, cannot be assumed or assigned in the event of your bankruptcy or any other insolvency-related proceeding or otherwise, without our expressed written consent.\n\nF.31 Taxes. You are responsible for all taxes and other charges imposed by any governmental authority in connection with your use of the Merchant Payment Services. You are solely responsible for determining any and all taxes assessed or required to be collected, and/or paid by you in connection with your use of our Merchant Payment Services. Intuit may be required by law to report certain transactions that meet certain Canada Revenue Agency (“CRA”) requirements.\n\nF.32 Your Consent to Electronic Communication; Code Complaint. As part of the Merchant Payment Services, or as required by law, Intuit may send communications to you that pertain to the Merchant Payment Services. You agree that Intuit and others who may administer such Merchant Payment Services (as applicable) may send communications to you via SMS/text, and email, and/or may make communications available to you by posting them at one or more of our websites.

If you have consented to receive electronic communications but also wish to receive paper copies of any communication, you may request such copies, which will be sent via mail. If you have a complaint regarding Intuit’s compliance with the Code of Conduct for the Credit and Debit Card Industry in Canada you can submit a Code Complaint per the process detailed at: https://forms.gle/C8cJUWmg2dQ6fvE88. Intuit will respond to all Code Complaints in accordance with our Complaint Handling Procedures, a summary of which we have provided to you.\n\nF.33 Intuit’s Use of Your Information. You agree that Intuit may maintain and use your information in accordance with the Intuit Global Privacy Statement. Intuit, at its sole discretion, may report information about you and your account to credit reporting agencies, fraud monitoring services, and other third-party vendors to the extent necessary to provide the Merchant Payment Services or to manage our risk.

Failure to present any transaction for clearing and settlement, or failure to add funds or access funds in your Merchant Account, for (a) the applicable time period as mandated or allowed by provincial law, or (b) twenty-four (24) months, whichever is less, may result in your Merchant Account being terminated and your funds remitted to your province of residency. At our sole discretion, we may suspend your access to the Merchant Payment Services in the event your Merchant Account has been inactive for six (6) months.\n\nF.35 Your Representation and Warranties. Without limiting any other warranties under this Agreement, you represent and warrant that: (a) you have the right, power, and ability to enter into these Merchant Payment Terms on your behalf and the business entity on whose behalf you are acting; (b) that all information you provide to us is current and accurate; (c) all transactions submitted by you are bona fide transactions and in compliance with the Rules, these Merchant Payment Terms, and applicable law; (d) you will fulfill all your obligations to your customers and will resolve any customer disputes or complaints directly; (e) you will not use the Merchant Payment Services, directly or indirectly, for any fraudulent undertaking or in any manner so as to interfere with the operation of the Merchant Payment Services; and (f) your use of the Merchant Payment Services is in compliance with these Merchant Payment Terms.

You agree that any reversal of a transaction initiated by you represents a bona fide refund or adjustment on a payment transaction.\n\nF.36 Termination, Effect of Termination; Fee Changes; Payment Card Network Rate Reductions. Intuit may immediately, in its sole discretion and without notice, terminate the Agreement or suspend the Merchant Payment Services with or without cause. If you are a Quebec Consumer, termination or suspension without cause will be effective after sixty (60) days’ prior written notice; please refer to Section 24 of Section A of the Agreement. Additionally, VISA or other card or payment networks or other third parties, as applicable, may suspend or terminate their Merchant Payment Services to you under the Agreement with or without notice. Upon termination by Intuit for any reason, you must immediately stop using the Merchant Payment Services. That means, for example, that you must cease requesting electronic authorizations, transmitting transaction receipts to Intuit, and using all card or payment network signage. Upon termination, any outstanding payments will become due. Any termination of the Agreement shall not affect Intuit's rights to any payments due. All Sections of these Merchant Payment Terms that by their nature should survive termination or expiration will remain in effect, even if this Agreement is terminated.
