        "text": "A: Yeah, I totally feel the vibes there back then. It's more digital nowadays, but back then I would say you need to move your body and physically move to the place to find out and search for new inspirations and new works. And I can see the progress of the collage and animation and film that you just accumulate to each other and then have this amazing breakthroughs nowadays.\n\nKS: And it's also after going through COVID, right, when everything was just like, yes, you actually had an access to so many things, all these online screenings, but it's wonderful to be back when you get to go to a place. I'm so excited to come to Boston. And it's so much about having this very singular experience about how does this program of films work and what kind of conversations can grow out.\n\nA: There are various things on Internet, but you're coming out and physically doing things like searching for the things and seeing touching and having all of the interactions. Truly amazing. And also, speak of the background, academic background. And now you're a mentor at the University of Colorado. And I'm just wondering how was the teaching influenced your work and do your students inspired new ideas to you?\n\nKS: That's a great question. I've been at Colorado for almost ten years now, and I had done teaching before that and I think right now I'm in a place where I try to bring as much of my creative brain to my students. I don't want to present that there's just one way to think through something, but I like to kind of open up my brain and talk about how I build connections. When I'm really in my studio and really excited about the work, all of that energy comes through me to my students. And I teach a combination of core production classes, but also electives. So, like, I'll teach the introduction to moving image or the BFA capstone class, but I have electives where I get to teach experimental digital animation or experimental narrative. And that's the place where know the things that I'm really ingesting and thinking about and experimenting with comes through into the classroom, into these bigger questions that we ask. And I really always try to build a question around some sort of thing we're going to explore through animation, some readings we're doing, some screenings we're doing, and try to build these little clusters about how we think through producing an image or a landscape or a body and what we want any of those to contain going forward. In terms of my students being inspiring, there's so many I'm in great connection with, and there's some students who come back to visit their parents in this area, and they'll come over for a coffee. There's one student who is a former student in my animation class, Dana Crawford, who ran with collage animation, and she made the most incredible collage animation music video. So I actually bring her as a guest to my mental digital animation class. And the students just think it's so wild. The videos is great, and they're so inspired. Like, oh, you took this class and then you made this video. And so it's a really great way to think about not me and that class is once one moment in time, but how that can evolve in time. And so I'm teaching that class next semester, and I will definitely be inviting Dana Crawford back to present her work.\n\nA: Sounds amazing, because in the portfolio, I saw the film study videos from 2015 to 2019. As I can assess those videos that you uploaded to the website, it was a quite raw and newness and that kind of complexity inside of the video, it is such a fresh air for me. And I wonder if you have a key advice for the aspiring new students that is following you or following the animation or experimental film process.\n\n3\n\nKS: I think when I work with students, especially over multiple years, I'm teaching our first production class now, and I'm also teaching our BFA capstone class. And I'm really interested in students finding their own individual filmmaking form, their own individual questions that they're asking. And kind of when you see a piece, you can see them in it. And I really try to encourage them to find a practice that really comes from them. And at the end of my moving Image foundations class this semester, it was so great because I could see, Ori, that film is such an ori film. Or, hey, Finn, that is, know all these things, like the way you work with camera, the way your frame looks, or the way you work with questions about genders and home movies and memoirs. I see that in your work. And so I really try to create a space where students can realize what their own vision is. And especially when they're coming in new, their exposure has been kind of like, what are your kind of commodity media products, like what's on Netflix, and where things actually feel really homogeneous in a lot of ways, in terms of storytelling, in terms of aesthetics. And so I think in all my classes, I really want them to understand that there's no one way that their work needs to look. And for them to really ask questions like, well, what does my work need to look like? And what is really inspiring to me to create a practice that's going to always be playful and curious and inquisitive, and having me seek more and dig.\n\nThematic Evolution and Societal Commentary\n\nA: Looking through your work, I think the theme or the style of your work is really a kaleidoscope. Are there any unique rituals or serendipitous moments that you have behind the creative process? For example, in the tropical depression, the Miss Universe contest, and then the hurricane. How are those coming together?\n\nKS: That's a great question as well. And I think that's kind of one of the collage impulses is not just how the frame is built, but some of the histories or stories that are going into the frame and the film that you referenced. Tropical depression. I was living on the island of Galveston, and I was at an artist residency called the Galveston Artist residency. And there was a final show for the residency. And while I was living in Texas, and I'd moved there before for a fellowship called the Corps program at the Museum of Fine Arts in Houston. At that point, I was invited to make a film from the Texas archive of the moving image for a show at the contemporary art museum. And I had made a film called the Rancher with materials of Johnson, who I just looked through the archive and just saw three newsreels and took those and made kind of like an alternate subconscious, nightmare dream reel of an unnamed president. And then I made that while I was living in Galveston. But then for the show in Galveston, I thought I'd like to work with other images of Texas. And so I went back to the Texas archive of the moving image. And it's always know, I think in that body of work I was looking for, I'm like, what film's going to grab my attention? And how can I recast the figure in know? And I think there's, like, a long trend of me recasting figures to perform other narratives in my work. And I came across a newsreel from the pageant of pulchritude, which is an earlier name for the Miss Universe contest that used to be held in Galveston. And I just found this image of the woman who won it, who was 17 years old, and she had taken a boat over from Belgium. And it was like this moment of she wins this huge contest, but she doesn't speak English. She's been on a boat for so long, and she's kind of really disoriented and exhausted. And I felt like there was something really vulnerable about that. And the artist residency that I was doing came about as a response to Hurricane Ike, which had, like, wiped out a ton of the island. And, like, Galveston, history of hurricanes, and one of the most deadly hurricanes in American history happened in Galveston, like, 1899. And this residency, after disasters, there's always, in some form, some predatory environment of people coming in and profiting off of a place that's been destroyed that's very vulnerable. And so I started thinking about this layers of Galveston and thinking about this early Miss Universe pageant and this more recent hurricane kind of being these layers of vulnerability and precariousness that had happened there. And so I worked with this newsreel and then found imagery of Hurricane Ike coming in and kind of thinking about this as building those two together and this kind of abstract portrait that's like part newsreel but maybe part landscape as.\n\n4\n\nA: I think it's a new experience but a new way to attract people to look back into the histories. And that's really amazing for me. And then also in the pattern for survival or buddy besieged and maybe the applied pleasure there is a captivating interplay between, for example, motion and stillness or like rhythmic repetition or sometimes chaotic. How do you strike that balance? And is there any underlying messages that if there is any. Can you expose those kind of processes behind the choices that you have?\n\nKS: Yeah. So that was the body besieged pattern for survival and applied pressure. I love talking about time as something that you get to build in each piece. And what is a rhythm of time that you're building? And what pulse does it have? Is the time space one that's like a fluttering pulse that's produced from anxiety or fear? Is it something that is a little more watchful and waiting? And I think just in terms of thinking about how many frames you hold in a cycle, you can create these rhythms in cycles that you can hopefully connect with the people who are watching the film. And I think so much about watching something that moves through space and time is about a somatic connection. And where can I, as I'm animating a person who's watching it or even myself, like I have a heartbeat, I have a heart rate. And it's not always the same thing. So those three works have different intentions, I believe, where body besieged is created from exercise books and wellness books. And I was thinking about what if there was a darker force behind the wellness? And the way that I. And it came about this way is that it was one of the earliest kind of Muybridge-esque animations I made where these workout books, they're instructional books right. And they have sequential imagery in them to show you how to do a move. And I scanned in all these sequential images and then just animated them. And they didn't have as many representative gestures in the sequence. So when I animated them, I thought about, well, what does it look like when the body's moving using these four frames that I'm looping? And I thought, oh, they look possessed. And so I went about to think about these kind of. And they all have smiles on their face, every frame. And so it's like, kind of these frenetic, overly positive images that red is like these women's bodies that have been possessed by this wellness drive. And so that was like, how can I work with animation to have them kind of carry that feeling? And I'll contrast that with a piece applied pressure, which also uses sequential images, but this time from body workbooks, i n massage books, and that film kind of took a while to come about. And whenever, if I'm out in a used bookstore or a thrift store or a yard sale and I look through books, I love a sequential image book because I'm like, there's an animation in there somewhere. And I remember finding a massage book and purchasing it and then having it be on the bookshelf in my studio, but it wasn't ready for it to be activated. And then during the wave of accusations that were coming against Harvey Weinstein about women, that he asked to come to his hotel room and then under the guise of massage, would sexually assault them. All of a sudden, I thought, oh, this book has a new lens on it. And thinking about massage not as something that's therapeutic, but something that can be traumatic. And not long after that, all the kind of assault allegations against Larry Nasser, the US gymnast team, came about, too. And so it was a way of not only just talking about those two moments, but kind of thinking about how a larger cultural discourse of sexual assault was playing out, and also women's experiences of sexual assault, where it's not always clear, it can kind of be a slow move across something that seems innocent to something that's assault. And I think a lot of women are, like, in that space, don't know what's really happening and aren't sure what's happening until it's already happened. And so with that, I was like, I wanted to bring that all out and applied pressure and working very much with how the hands on the women's bodies can go into a space that reads as innocuous, but then starts to veer into a gray zone into this touch feels dangerous. And so it was all about finding specific gestures of hands on women's bodies holding too long and really sculpting the time of. What does that space before an assault actually happens feel like? And how does time feel like in that moment?\n\n5\n\nReturn to top\n\nA: I heard that visuals are the most important things for you to create new things. And then the sound or the other elements come after that to support the visual satisfaction that you have in your films. And then how is that? Is it still the way that you create the new works, or did that change in any ways?\n\nKS: I now make sound along with the visual, and because I feel like the visual is just like one form of the idea moving through space and time, and I'll make a shot and I'm like, what does that world sound like? What does that feel like in there? And I had to start experimenting with the sound as I go along. So now they kind of start evolving. And it was great because on the last film, the last season that Adam Wade did the sound, I built out the entire. Then is it by live recording? What's that?\n\nA: Is it by live recording that you made on the spot?\n\nKS: No, it was like finding everything from wind sounds to mechanical rewind sounds to a song I wanted in there. And I built out the whole soundtrack, and I brought it to Adam, and I'm like, I don't know what our collaboration is going to look like, because before, I just went with a piece that had voice and image, and Adam built the sound, but this time I'm like, I think with the sound to help me figure out the piece at this point. And I brought the soundtrack, and he rebuilt it so much better than I imagined it. He's like, okay, it's really helpful to see what you're thinking about here, but let's actually build this out. And so was so happy working with him, and it was funny because he would make a sound, and I'm like, that's not what it sounds like. He's like, well, what does it sound like? And we'd have to, like, he had me write out emotionally what you wanted someone to feel at every single point in every single shot in the film. And some of the shots are just, like 2 seconds long. So it was just like, I really had to think about what needed to happen in there. And Adam was amazing translating that and making it happen and taking the soundtrack with, like, 20 tracks of sound and then building a new soundtrack. 20 tracks of sound. And it was great.\n\nA: I think, as we get closer to the end of our conversation, in a way, I see a lot of your works has the implication, or those really opposed, official kind of rebellion in your work. RPM film festival stands for revolution per minute. And then is there the final message would you like to share with RPM festival and as an experimental film artist, what revolution mean to you?\n\nWow, that's a great question. The work is questioning procedure, official narratives, kind of authoritarian positions. And I think so much of that is so coded into how we see how the world is imaged, what images circulate, how we circulate, and taking a deeper look at something that could be images of the space race and tying that to larger kind of imperial and nationalistic gestures, or thinking about how gender power dynamics are coded and looking at that through kind of massage books and these examples of touch, I think it's important for us to look at moments that open up into larger gestures of resistance and larger ways of speaking back to what is the official word? Because that's not always these ideas of what's official. What is the idea of progress. It's not universal, and it's always usually to the advantage of some people. So what are the spaces? If you kind of roll back that claim of the official, the authoritative, and then you start to leave room for other stories that push back against those narratives, I think that's something I try to do across all the work.\n\n13\n\nReturn to top"
