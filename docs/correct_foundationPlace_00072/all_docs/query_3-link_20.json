If you attend the first day of class and it doesn't meet your expectations, just email us at [email protected] by the end of the first day. Please note that we don't provide refunds if you miss the class or reschedule past 60 days from purchase. However, we'll keep your credit so that you can attend another class in the future. If you have to miss the class, chat with a training advisor to reschedule.\n\nComplete Training and Live Help Membership To refund your membership, please send an email to [email protected] before the 30th day of purchase, and you'll receive a full refund. Please note if you use any of the included QuickBooks Certification vouchers, we have to deduct the cost of the vouchers ($125 each) from your refund. After 30+ days, we'll stop your monthly subscription for live services (this includes daily instructor-led classes and Live QuickBooks Help sessions). Still, you can keep your access to the entire learning library (including all updates to those courses)."
