        "text": "MOUNTAIN VIEW, Calif.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Intuit (Nasdaq: INTU), the global financial technology platform that makes TurboTax, Credit Karma, QuickBooks, and Mailchimp, together with the Suh Family Foundation, co-founded by Ndamukong and Katya Suh, today announced a partnership to bring financial literacy education to high school students in some of the nationâs largest school districts in Dallas, Los Angeles, and Oakland.\n\nThe program follows a successful pilot serving students in the Portland Public Schools through a partnership with Self Enhancement, Inc., where Intuit and the Suh Family Foundation provided workshops and training to staff to deliver personal finance education to students. Through the program expansion, Intuit will equip teachers with a financial literacy curriculum and skills-building resources, providing students across the country with a stronger financial foundation.\n\nAcross classrooms, thereâs a growing need to teach personal finance skills. Greater financial literacy tends to translate into higher financial well-being â yet 28% of adults say theyâve never participated in a financial education program.1 Those with a stronger understanding of personal finance topics are more likely to spend less than their income, have emergency funds set aside, and take steps to plan for their long-term financial future.2\n\nIntuit will pair its expertise on essential personal finance topics, including taxes, savings, and budgeting with expertise from the Suh Family Foundation in wealth building, credit management and investing.\n\nâIntuit believes every student should have the opportunity to prosper, regardless of zip code. Our partnership with the Suh Family Foundation helps us scale our personal finance programming across Intuitâs Prosperity Hub School Districts,â said David Zasada, VP Corporate Responsibility at Intuit. âWe aim to instill confidence for teachers who are tasked with teaching core finance topics, and help build confidence for students as they take this financial education into the real world upon graduation.â\n\nThe Suh Family Foundation supplies individuals and communities with resources across three pillars that were distinctly pivotal to the Suhâs own success: education, health and wellness, and empowerment. Now together with Intuit, the programming is designed to empower and prepare students for their financial future as they build smarter money habits around budgeting, taxes, maintaining credit, and understanding debt.\n\nâFinancial literacy education is a pillar of the Suh Family Foundation, as a strong understanding of finances is key to personal success,â said Ndamukong and Katya Suh, co-founders of the Suh Family Foundation. âWe are thrilled to partner with Intuit, a company that shares our dedication to powering individual growth and prosperity throughout an individualâs life, and that starts with a foundation in topics like investing, wealth building and credit management at a young age.â\n\nTo start, Intuit and the Suh Family Foundation will bring hands-on workshops, resources and ongoing support to select schools within Intuitâs Prosperity Hub School District Program, including Los Angeles Unified School District (LAUSD), Inglewood Unified School District and Compton Unified School District in the LA area, Oakland Unified School District (OUSD) in the San Francisco Bay Area, and Dallas Independent School District (DISD) in Dallas, Texas.\n\nFor teachers living outside of school districts where live workshops will be available, Intuit has made its financial literacy curriculum publicly available at no cost at: www.intuit.com/financialbasics\n\nAbout Intuit\n\nIntuit is the global financial technology platform that powers prosperity for the people and communities we serve. With more than 100 million customers worldwide using TurboTax, Credit Karma, QuickBooks, and Mailchimp, we believe that everyone should have the opportunity to prosper. We never stop working to find new, innovative ways to make that possible.
