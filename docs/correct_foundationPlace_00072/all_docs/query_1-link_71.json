        "text": "Background\n\nThe Macdonald-Laurier Institute for Public Policy (MLI) is an Atlas Network partner based in Ottawa, Ontario, Canada.\n\nMLI describes itself as “Canada’s only truly national public policy think tank” and claims to be “rigorously independent and non-partisan.”\n\nSourceWatch describes the Atlas Network (formerly the Atlas Economic Research Foundation) as “The Johnny Appleseed of antiregulation groups […] on a mission to populate the world with new ‘free market’ voices.”“Atlas Economic Research Foundation,” SourceWatch profile.\n\nMLI was founded in 2010 by Brian Lee Crowley, who is currently the institute’s managing director. Crowley is a Canadian economist and the founder of the Atlantic Institute for Market Studies, a right-wing think tank that later merged with the Fraser Institute.\n\nSince its early days, MLI has promoted its policy positions by publishing “major” reports as well as “op-eds placed in local and national outlets, media appearances, speaking opportunities, and by directly engaging Aboriginal organizations and government officials. “\n\nThe Aboriginal Canada and the Natural Resource Economy Project\n\nIn 2013, MLI founded its ongoing “Aboriginal Canada and Natural Resource Economy” project. This project describes itself as facilitating collaboration between “the two sides” of historical colonial and post-colonial antagonism and conflict, “First Nations and business,” in order to “work together to ensure our development of natural resources is safe, stable and reliable.“\n\nThe project’s early goals included recruitment of “an individual who is knowledgeable about, and trusted by, Canada’s Indigenous population to lead the project.” That individual was Ken Coates, whom MLI described as “a respected thought leader and historian of Canada’s Aboriginals with connections into Indigenous communities across the country.” Coates is currently a senior fellow and director of the Macdonald-Laurier Institute’s “Indigenous Affairs Program.”\n\nCoates has actively promoted First Nations involvement in resource development.\n\nCurrently, Coates is the Canada Research Chair in Regional Innovation in the Johnson-Shoyama Graduate School of Public Policy at the University of Saskatchewan.\n\nLed by Coates, the Natural Resource Economy project drew from MLI’s “team of economists, legal scholars, and Coates’ connections to Aboriginal leaders to produce a series of policy papers … [that] explored the biggest obstacles to resource development.” Published in the spring of 2013, they included “New Beginnings: How Canada’s natural resource wealth could re-shape relations with Aboriginal people,” “The Way Out: New thinking about Aboriginal engagement and energy infrastructure to the West Coast,” and “Canada and the First Nations: Cooperation or conflict?”\n\nA 2018 report co-produced by MLI would go on to note that the organization’s leadership knew it might “face feelings of distrust from the Indigenous community. MLI knew that no matter how sound its research and recommendations were, its credibility would be questioned if the Institute did not build a team made up of leaders within the Aboriginal community.”\n\nIn February 2018, the Atlas Network released a “Think Tank Impact Case Study” highlighting the Macdonald-Laurier Institute, titled “Aboriginal Canada and the Natural Resource Economy Project.”\n\nThe study outlined MLI’s efforts over the previous five years to engage Indigenous groups, termed “non-traditional allies,” to “create free-market change.” The Atlas-MLI study portrayed oil and gas development as a way for First Nations communities to detach from “state dependency and a lack of opportunity.”\n\n“I am immensely proud that MLI has put unlocking prosperity for the Indigenous people of Canada at the forefront of its work,” said Brian Lee Crowley, managing director of MLI, in an Atlas Network article promoting the study. “For too long Aboriginal people have been forced by government policy to live outside the institutions that confer opportunity on everyone else. Our Aboriginal Canada and the Natural Resource Economy Project aims instead to bring Aboriginal communities into the economic mainstream while giving them more power and authority over their own lives and ensuring that development takes place in a way that is respectful of the environment and Indigenous priorities.”\n\nAccording to the case study, “The fundamental inequalities facing Canada’s Aboriginal population are deeply engrained.” However, “fostering economic activity through the development and cultivation of Canada’s natural resources offers a rare opportunity to incorporate these historically neglected and disadvantaged communities into the economic mainstream.”\n\nThe case study outlined how MLI “began its work on the Aboriginal Canada and the Natural Resource Economy project at the behest of the Assembly of First Nations (AFN), a governing body made up of chiefs from Canada’s Aboriginal tribes and modeled after the United Nations General Assembly.”\n\n“The AFN saw potential in the natural resource economy as a major driver of transformation in Indigenous opportunity, and the Assembly knew of MLI’s commitment to market-oriented approaches to solve the social and economic issues plaguing Canada,” the case study stated.\n\nA “Shield Against Opponents”\n\nThe Atlas case study outlined how MLI had developed a 12-person advisory committee, overseen by Coates, composed of reform-minded Aboriginal economists, business leaders, lawyers, public policy analysts, and scholars.\n\n“Since the beginning, this Committee lent credibility to MLI’s work throughout the Aboriginal community, and has provided a shield against opponents that is hard to undermine.” (Emphasis added.)\n\nCoates and the committee defined “the narrative they wanted to pursue upfront,” a vision involving “self-sufficiency for the Aboriginal population based on resource development, and strong economic partnerships.” (Emphasis added.)\n\nThe committee declared that “government was never and cannot be the solution to the problems facing Aboriginal groups.” Rather, the case study concluded that it would be better to “encourage policies that allow Canada’s Indigenous population to benefit from mining and energy development by promoting their usage and development of natural resources such as gas, potash, uranium, and oil located on their lands.”\n\nIn “Cooperation or Conflict,” co-written by Coates and MLI managing director Brian Lee Crowley, it was stated that “the Aboriginal Canada and the Natural Resource Economy project (of which this paper is a part) seeks to attract the attention of policy makers, Aboriginal Canadians, community leaders, opinion leaders, and others to some of the policy challenges that must be overcome if Canadians, Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal alike, are to realise the full value of the potential of the natural resource economy.”\n\nAs the project progressed, “MLI published major papers on average every 3-4 months increasingly using Aboriginal authors for its publications,” the Atlas case study noted.\n\nMLI’s promotion strategy to “overcome the barriers to engaging in resource development” involved traveling to remote Aboriginal communities. “MLI promoted its work through op-eds placed in local and national outlets, media appearances, speaking opportunities, and by directly engaging Aboriginal organizations and government officials.\n\n“The organization also took a direct role in bringing people together to pursue public policy that works for all parties. MLI worked tirelessly to involve unlikely partners including chambers of commerce, government offices, and Indigenous associations.\n\n“Leaders for this project travelled to remote Aboriginal communities to promote the solutions found in natural resources and to help the communities overcome the barriers to engaging in resource development. The Advisory Committee has been instrumental in establishing connections within these communities.”\n\nThe Atlas Network case study suggested the Natural Resource Economy Project helped the Macdonald-Laurier Institute fundraise “roughly Can $500,000 more than they would have without the project mostly through foundation support” during the project’s first five years of operation.\n\nThe Atlas-MLI case study also noted how MKI’s relationships could be used to political advantage:\n\n“Due to the extremely divisive nature of this topic in Canada, many elected officials now depend on the relationship that MLI has built with the Aboriginal community. This connection provides credibility and support needed to battle opponents.”(Emphasis added.)\n\nMLI has apparently had some success on this front. In November 2016, then-Justice Minister Jody Wilson-Raybould “offered her support to MLI’s view.” MLI celebrated Wilson-Raybould as its “Policy-Maker of the Year” in December 2017.\n\nIn December 2016, the Atlas case study boasted, the Canadian Senate issued a report “which drew extensively from MLI’s testimony and several of its top recommendations.” This report was most likely an Interim Report of the Standing Senate Committee on Transport and Communications titled “Pipelines for Oil: Protecting Our Economy, Respecting our Environment,” The report mentioned Ken Coates in a section titled “Sharing the benefits of pipelines with indigenous peoples.\n\n“Ken Coates, Senior Fellow in Aboriginal and Northern Canadian Issues at the Macdonald-Laurier Institute noted that Canada’s Indigenous Peoples have often not received their fair share of benefits from resource development,” the report suggested. “Many witnesses spoke about the importance of engaging Indigenous peoples as partners in natural resource development. The Committee believes that engaging Indigenous peoples as partners who share in the benefits of pipeline projects – ideally, as some witnesses pointed out, through equity shares in projects – is critical to the success of a crude oil transport strategy.”\n\nIn 2017, the Canadian Council for Aboriginal Business gave Ken Coates its Award for Excellence in Aboriginal Relations.\n\nCriticism of the Environmental Movement\n\nMLI fellows and staff, including Coates, are critical of the environmental movement for opposing oil and gas development.\n\n“The current state of Indigenous engagement in the oil and gas industry presents a formidable challenge to environmentalists and those opposed to the further development of the energy sector,” Coates wrote in a December 2020 issue of the MLI’s Inside Policy magazine.\n\n“These environmental movements have repeatedly declared their commitment to Indigenous peoples, but the opaqueness of this stance has been exposed.\n\n“Based on existing patterns, it seems clear that the environmentalists support Indigenous peoples only when the First Nations and Métis adopt strong environmentalist positions. Will they back down when Indigenous communities support the projects? If not, they must stop presenting themselves as stalwart defenders of Indigenous rights.”\n\n[…]\n\n“Canada’s oil and gas industry had been put on a different course through Indigenous engagement. The sector now shares, with mining, some of the most positive Indigenous relationships in the Canadian economy. The transformation over the past generation has been truly impressive. And the sector’s future is surely a bright one, relying substantially on continued Indigenous engagement, mutually beneficial arrangements, and a shared effort to overcome the sustained criticism of the industry,” Coates concluded.\n\nCoates also co-authored a report for MLI in 2019, titled “Breaking the Pipeline Logjam,” with MLI program manager Joseph Quesnel. Quesnel has long written on resource development as a path for reconciliation. For more than 10 years he worked as a policy analyst with the Frontier Centre for Public Policy – another Atlas Network partner – “where he specialized in Indigenous policy, but also property rights and water market issues.”\n\n“Joseph has appeared as an expert witness on Aboriginal legislation in both House and Senate committees,” his archived profile at MLI noted, and “worked on Indigenous issues alongside Dr. Tom Flanagan.” He was formerly listed as a program manager with the Aboriginal Canada and the Natural Resource Economy project.\n\nQuesnel was a research associate with the Atlantic Institute for Market Studies (AIMS). AIMS has since merged with the Fraser Institute, where he is listed as a senior fellow.\n\nOpposition to Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples\n\nIn the mid-2010s, MLI’s Natural Resource Economy Project began an opposition campaign to Canadian adoption of the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples. This effort was funded at least in part by the Atlas Network.\n\n“The passage of the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous People (UNDRIP) concerned the team at MLI due the provision of ‘free, prior, and informed consent’ (FPIC),” a 2018 Atlas Network-MLI case study noted.”\n\n“This provision, while well-intended, would have allowed even the most fringe groups to veto improvement projects at the expense of whole communities. The consequences would have been detrimental to the market-based progress that Canada’s Aboriginal population are making. It is difficult to overstate the legal and economic disruptions that may have followed from such a step.”\n\nThe MLI position on free, prior and informed consent is also the view adopted by many Conservative politicians, who argued that UNDRIP would make it impossible to build new oil pipelines or resource extraction projects.\n\nBut First Nations legal scholars have pushed back against that framing. “We have to do away with this fear regarding free, prior and informed consent, that it will mean a veto and no developments will go ahead. This is always the first question that news reporters and politicians raise when they hear about UNDRIP being implemented,” wrote Judith Sayers of the Hupacasath First Nation in 2020.\n\nMLI took credit for working actively to pressure the Canadian government to oppose UNDRIP:\n\n“To educate the public on the risks associated with Canada joining UNDRIP, MLI published two research reports, cowritten by Ken Coates and Blaine Favel (a leading Indigenous resource lawyer) in May 2016. The team followed the release of these papers with a sophisticated communications and outreach strategy to persuade the government, businesses, and Aboriginal communities on the dangers involved with fully adopting UNDRIP, including FPIC.\n\n“This communications and outreach strategy pressured the government to reverse its support of UNDRIP and educated businesses and Aboriginal communities about the full implications of adopting UNDRIP.” (Emphasis added).\n\n[…]\n\n“In addition, Canada’s Senate frequently consulted MLI during its hearings, eventually issuing a report in December 2016 which drew extensively from MLI’s testimony and several of its top recommendations. Ultimately, the Canadian government decided to reverse a plan to sign onto UNDRIP. The decision, which carried some political cost to government leaders who were criticized for breaking a promise to join the scheme, is a triumph of good ideas, market reform, and economic opportunity for Canada’s Aboriginal communities.”\n\nThe Atlas Network also highlighted how Dwight Newman, an MLI senior fellow, testified before the Senate Standing Committee in 2019 “to discuss the unintended consequences of the proposed legislation”:\n\n“Bill C-262 would have implemented the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous People in Canada which, as an international law, is not specific enough for Canada and its extensive Indigenous groups to guarantee their protection.\n\n“Newmann [sic] explained that, although the bill was intended to provide harmony between Indigenous people and the government, it would have led to massive uncertainty in the Canadian legal system since it was an international act that didn’t consider local priorities or the local economy.\n\n“The bill was ultimately defeated,” The Atlas Network wrote. The article includes a disclaimer that “Atlas Network supported this initiative with a Poverty & Freedom grant.”\n\nNewman has also been listed as a contributor at the Federalist Society. This organization is a Koch-funded “group of conservatives and libertarians interested in the current state of the legal order”” Some have suggested that the Federalist Society has been the driving force behind a “right-wing takeover of the judiciary” in the United States.\n\nThe Federalist Society notes that listed contributors have “spoken or otherwise participated in Federalist Society events, publications, or multimedia presentations.” However there may not be a direct “endorsement or relationship between the person and the Federalist Society.”\n\nWhen Newman testified in opposition to UNDRIP before the Canadian Senate in 2019, he suggested the section on free, prior and informed consent or FPIC could “have enormous implications for Canada”:\n\n“While Canada is certainly fortunate to have a judicial system of high quality, on the present text of Bill C-262 and the presence of many different interpretations possible for FPIC in UNDRIP, the Court’s interpretation of FPIC is nonetheless subject to uncertainties that have enormous implications for Canada” [sic].\n\nConservative Senator Neil Plett referenced MLI’s work in opposing UNDRIP in May 2019:\n\n“Blaine Favel and Ken Coates, with the Macdonald-Laurier Institute, wrote the following in their publication ‘Understanding UNDRIP,'” Plett said in a debate on the second reading of the legislation to adopt the U.N. Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples. He quoted Coates and Favel, saying:\n\n“But there has been significant confusion and uncertainty about what it means to implement the Declaration. There is particular concern about the compatibility of certain elements of UNDRIP with Canada’s legal, political, and constitutional architecture. This poses a major challenge for the government as it seeks to meet such heightened expectations.\n\n“To be frank with you, I find it somewhat difficult and quite concerning that people both inside and outside of this chamber are trying to goad senators into pushing this bill through before its implications have been fully examined and properly understood.”\n\nAPTN News reported on the death of Bill C-262, and noted Senator Plett had said that “no one seems to know” the implications of UNDRIP being legislated, “because there is no agreement on whether consent means a veto.”\n\n“It’s a false dichotomy though, Independent Senator Murray Sinclair, [Former NDP Member of Parliament Romeo Saganash] and others have repeatedly told C-262’s critics,” APTN News reported.\n\n“‘Free, prior and informed consent is a very simple concept,’ Sinclair told APTN in May. ‘And that is, before you affect my land, you need to talk to me, and you need to have my permission.\n\n“‘That doesn’t mean that we’re vetoing it. It doesn’t mean that First Nations people, or Indigenous people outside of Indian reserves, are vetoing anything. Just because they say you can’t run a pipeline across my land doesn’t mean you can’t run it somewhere else.’\n\nCoates and Blaine Favel also co-authored a May 2016 MLI publication on “Understanding UNDRIP.”\n\n“Implementing UNDRIP in full – that is, enshrining every provision in Canadian law and policy – would\n\nnot only be impractical, it could undermine recent progress towards greater economic opportunity\n\nand self-sufficiency for Canada’s Indigenous peoples,” they concluded.\n\nUNDRIP Made Law as Bill C-15\n\nAccording to Ken Coates’s resume, the Assembly of First Nations (AFN) prompted MLI’s “Aboriginal People and Natural Resources research and policy program.” AFN later published a “discussion guide” on both Bill C-262, which stalled before a final vote could be held in the Senate, and the replacement legislation federal Bill C-15. “AFN supported Bill C-262,” the group claimed in the guide.\n\nBill C-15, which according to AFN “strengthened the wording and focus” of Bill C-262, became law in mid-2021.\n\nStance on Climate Change\n\nMarch 2022\n\n“Many other countries that do not have sufficient domestic energy supplies or suitable conditions for renewable energy are concluding that the uncertain impacts of aggressive climate change policies are less threatening than the known consequences of a chaotic energy transition. Canada’s response should acknowledge this reality. We ignore an energy crisis in favour of the climate crisis at our peril,” Jeff Kucharski and Heather Exner-Pirot wrote in an MLI publication titled “Reimagining Canada’s Role in Global Energy Security.“\n\nDecember 2021\n\n“One can take seriously the undeniable threat posed by climate change while also asking whether some of the theatrics and hyperbole surrounding climate summits only serve to trivialize the process,” MLI senior fellow Jeff Kucharski wrote in a December 2021 issue of the MLI publication Inside Policy.\n\n“It is fair to ask why emissions caps are needed at all when Canada already has a price on carbon which will be ratcheted up over time,”Kucharski wrote.\n\nOctober 2021\n\n“Targeting greenhouse gas emissions without weighing their economic impact invites destructive environmental policies that harm the economy,” a MLI report by Philip Cross on “Doubling GDP by 2050” suggested.\n\n“In the long-term, technological innovation is the only viable solution for lowering emissions while maintaining real income growth. However, our society apparently distrusts or discounts technology as the solution to climate change despite having the confidence to trust our lives to other technologies.”\n\nThe report cited an Obama administration official, Steve Koonin, on geoengineering:\n\n“Obama’s science advisor Steven Koonin experienced first-hand how ‘any mention of geoengineering to governments or NGOs was met with tight-lipped silence, if not actual hostility.'”\n\nIt also cited Ross McKitrick:\n\n“University of Guelph Professor Ross McKitrick (2016) outlined the difficulty of reducing emissions in a growing society.”\n\n“Setting unrealistic climate goals risks making poor policy choices that lead to unwanted outcomes for both the economy and the environment,” Cross suggested.\n\n“As 2030 approaches and Canada inevitably is falling well short of its climate goals, the temptation will mount to lower population or GDP growth as a short-cut to reach emission targets. Such a strategy facilitates reaching our climate goals but would compromise Canada’s well-being in other important ways.”\n\nJune 2021\n\n“Politicians and others who warn of an impending climate ‘catastrophe,’ ‘cataclysm’ or ’emergency’ are being unnecessarily alarmist, thereby raising unrealistic expectations that justify extreme measures,” MLI senior fellow Jeff Kucharski wrote in an issue of the Macdonald-Laurier Institute’s magazine Inside Policy.\n\nMarch 2021\n\nMLI senior fellow Chris Sankey, wrote in MLI’s Inside Policy magazine criticizing environmental activists:\n\n“Our communities worked with the brightest minds in academia and industry to develop a First Nations-centred solution that accommodates both climate change realities and appropriate resource development, which will bring much needed opportunities to our people.\n\n“What have the boisterous, assertive, and agenda-driven activists accomplished? I will tell you what they accomplished.\n\n“Families have been torn apart. The country has forfeited billions of dollars in lost opportunities and tens of thousands of jobs. Our communities have been gripped with grief, anger, and resentment. Money has been taken out of the hands of our people, undermining the ability of communities to be independent. Immense divisions now divide our communities across the country.\n\n“The consequences are real and serious. By ignoring Indigenous requests – and by listening to only those community members who share their preservationist worldview – the environmentalist agenda has stripped away our capacity to pay for necessary infrastructure such as housing, roads and commercial buildings. They stole opportunities for us to fund the advancement of our arts, culture, and language. Far too many communities remain welfare dependent, relying on the government to pay for our basic needs.\n\n“This is both unnecessary and destructive to Indigenous communities.”\n\nSankey is a member of the Coast Tsimshian community of Lax Kw’Alaams near Prince Rupert, British Columbia and heads Blackfish Industries, a heavy civil construction company.\n\nMay 2020\n\n“The only realistic path forward is to recognize the [sic] Canadian-produced oil and gas will remain a major part of Canada’s energy supply and that the energy sector is an integral part of the climate change planning process, not opponents of the search for an effective transition to a more sustainable economy,” MLI senior fellow Ken Coates wrote in MLI’s Inside Policy magazine.\n\n[…]\n\n“The Liberal government is politically devoted to its climate change agenda, even though current plans will have little impact on the global carbon footnote [sic] and will get little notice outside of Canada. Even Greta Thunberg will not be overly impressed,” Coates added. “Seldom, if ever, in Canadian history has so much been risked economically for such a limited return.”\n\nMarch 2020\n\nIn an opinion column for the Financial Post, MLI senior fellow Jeff Kucharski claimed there was a “humanitarian case” for exporting Canadian resources:\n\n“There is also a humanitarian case to be made for exporting our resources. As economies develop, they need energy resources like oil, natural gas, uranium, and rare earth elements. These are strategic resources: they are relatively scarce, are located only in certain regions, and are vital for economies to grow and thrive.\n\n“Canadian strategic energy resources can help: address energy poverty; reduce the global impact of climate change (by replacing supplies from authoritarian regimes with much lower ethical and environmental standards); lower GHG emissions by replacing coal with cleaner natural gas; and provide a stable source of the rare earth elements that are essential to producing cutting-edge clean energy technologies.\n\n“For these reasons, in addition to the obvious and more often mentioned economic case for Canadian energy exports, our governments, both federal and provincial, need to focus more intensively on how to make our resource exports available to an area of the world whose recent growth has been so impressive and whose growth potential remains substantial.”\n\nFunding\n\nThe following information is compiled from publicly available nonprofit disclosures in the U.S. and Canada.\n\nView the attached spreadsheet for a breakdown of the Macdonald-Laurier Institute’s funding by year (.xlsx).\n\nNote that private corporations are not required to publicly disclose the amounts of their donations . Also, some U.S. foundations do not disclose the identities of funding recipients in other countries.\n\nMLI stopped listing donors as of its 2021 annual report.\n\nIn addition to the funding information DeSmog compiled, above, MLI also listed its sponsors and donors in annual reports, but did not list the dollar values of donations:\n\nDonors\n\nSponsors\n\nMLI Donor Network Map\n\n990 Forms\n\nKey Documents\n\nKey People\n\nBoard of Directors\n\nResearch Advisory Board\n\nAdvisory Council\n\nExperts & Fellows\n\nStaff\n\nActions\n\nMay 17, 2022\n\nMLI featured Matt Ridley on a webinar panel “on the theme of innovation.” The panelists discuss climate change at 23:56. Ridley commented:\n\n“I think if we try to solve climate change with today’s existing technology, we will end up replacing a pretty efficient energy system based on fossil fuels with a somewhat inefficient one based on renewable energy, which uses huge quantities of landscape again.\n\n“You know, it’s back to the medieval idea that you need the landscape. Because you know, wind and sun and so on are very, very dilute. Very non-concentrated forms of energy so you need large areas of land to make energy out of them. And they’re not making much inroads. I mean, we’re about 85% dependent on fossil fuels for our energy still, which is roughly where we were 20 years ago.”\n\nMarch 28, 2022\n\nMLI senior fellow Ken Coates moderated a webinar panel on “Mining, Indigenous communities, and our resource-dependent future.”\n\nIn the first webinar, Coates mentioned the Newmont Corporation’s new Global Center for Indigenous Community Relations, directed by Catherine Tegelberg:\n\n“The Center will work across all of Newmont’s jurisdictions around the world and will be a resource for the Company, as well as the mining industry, to promote awareness, education and engagement between the industry and Indigenous Peoples. It will also provide expertise and, networking opportunities, and will share best practices within the mining industry,” Newmont wrote when the center was launched in February 2021.\n\nMLI went on to hold a second webinar with the same title on May 6, 2022.\n\nApril 25, 2022\n\nMLI Senior Policy Analyst Heather Exner-Pirot wrote an op-ed in the Ottawa Citizen advocating for use of nuclear power in Canada.\n\n“The high cost and intermittency of wind and solar, and the energy crisis it provoked in the Fall, helped push nuclear back to the forefront after years in the wilderness,” Exner-Pirot wrote of Europe’s search for fossil fuel alternatives.\n\n“The safety concerns of nuclear-hesitant environmentalists have never been grounded in reality,” she claimed. “Indeed, nuclear power is much like air travel: the fear of accidents is not tied to the sterling safety record of the industry overall.”\n\n“Few nations stand to gain as much strategically, economically and environmentally from a nuclear renaissance as Canada,” she concluded. “The government’s messaging needs to start reflecting this.”\n\nMarch 16, 2022\n\nMLI released a paper claiming that electric vehicle subsidies were “costly, inefficient, and regressive.”\n\nJanuary 2022\n\nThe Macdonald-Laurier Institute “workshopped a project to improve opportunities for native populations in Canada and elsewhere” at the Antigua Forum, an event the Atlas Network promoted as an “invitation-only event” to “[gather] project leads from freedom-minded organizations, many of them Atlas Network partners.”\n\nDecember 10, 2021\n\nIn an op-ed forthe Financial Post, Joseph Quesnel wrote that “real Indigenous reconciliation will come from ensuring that Indigenous peoples have real economic opportunity instead of being trapped by lousy policy as the poorest people in their own communities. This means the province must enable mining developments with attractive tax and regulatory policies. First Nations can be real players and active partners in that sector.” Joseph Quesnel has been a program manager with MLI’s Aboriginal Canada and the Natural Resource Economy project, and a senior research associate with the Frontier Center for Public Policy.\n\nDecember 8, 2021\n\nMLI senior fellow JP Gladu , a board member of both Noront Resources and Suncor, wrote an op-ed in The Globe and Mail accusing groups that oppose natural resource development of “using Indigenous peoples as political pawns. MLI shared the op-ed as well.\n\n“I do want to make sure the Canadian public appreciates the unintended consequences that constant and systematic protesting against resource development in Indigenous territories has on all of us,” Gladu wrote.\n\n“It’s my opinion – based on the work I have done with my own nation, as the former president and CEO of the Canadian Council for Aboriginal Business, the executive director of the Indigenous Resource Network and as a board member of both Indigenous owned and public companies – that resource development, from forestry to mining to oil and gas to fishing, is often the best, and for many nations, the only, transformative economic opportunity that can allow us to be self-determining again.”\n\nGladu has been an advisory member of the Canadian Association of Petroleum Producers, and an executive director of the Indigenous Resource Network. She was more recently listed as a “special advisor“ to the network.\n\nJune 2021\n\nIn the cover article of the June 2021 issue of Inside Policy, the MLI in-house magazine, Ken Coates wrote an article positioned as an analysis of Canadian government relations with Indigenous peoples. Titled “Finding a new path forward driven by Indigenous people,” the article opened by describing the “discovery of the locations where hundreds of [Indigenous] children were buried around abandoned residential school grounds,” then pivoted to describing how “Indigenous communities should be empowered to engage (or not engage) in the natural resource economy.”\n\n“Ultimately, Ottawa must step back – way back – permitting the re-empowerment of Indigenous peoples and ensuring the systematic and rapid dismantling of state-driven control over Indigenous lives. This theme can carry to all elements of policy-making, whether that be education, resource development, health care, housing, and more,” Coates wrote.\n\n“If these graves symbolize anything, it is the abject failure of decades of government policy. Find a new path forward driven by Indigenous people. Do it now. Instead of letting the memories of what happened to those Indigenous children haunt the country for years to come, let the discovery of the hundreds of bodies bodies be the launching point,” Coates concluded.\n\nJune 14, 2021\n\nIn an article for iPolitics, John Desjarlais Jr. and MLI senior fellow Heather Exner-Pirot cited a poll commissioned by the pro-resource-development Indigenous Resource Network that claimed a majority of Indigenous Canadians supported fossil fuel development.\n\nFebruary 5, 2021\n\nIn an MLI-sponsored event, Karen Ogen-Toews, CEO of the First Nations LNG Alliance, joined MLI senior fellow Ken Coates to “discuss the critical role the oil and gas sector plays in Indigenous reconciliation and economic independence.”\n\nNovember 2020\n\nKaren Ogen-Toews, CEO of the First Nations LNG Alliance, appeared on an episode of MLI’s Straight Talk with MLI senior fellow Ken Coates.\n\nIn the episode, Coates asked Ogen-Toews, “How do you deal with the situation now in British Columbia, where particularly people who aren’t from your First Nation and who aren’t even from your region are protesting against the decision of a First Nation community in the north to support the pipeline?”\n\nKaren Ogen-Toews responded:\n\n“I think in a lot of ways these groups have perpetuated the division and the fracturing of our Wet’suwet’en people. […] I don’t have a lot of good things to say about these groups because we are the people that have to live within our communities and work for our communities and these nongovernment organizations are out of the picture now. It was well-funded. They put on a good show but at the end of the day it’s our people that are left having to make a way forward for ourselves.”\n\nCoates commented, “That’s a very evocative way of describing it. I think the country as a whole really needs to understand that that’s the kind of impact these external interventions have on the community.”\n\nRegarding the U.N. Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples, or UNDRIP, Ogen-Toews commented:\n\n“I think that a lot of people use the term UNDRIP very loosely. What does it mean to us? I guess there is a couple of things. A lot of people learned what UNDRIP means and what it means to us. But I think there were a lot of people who jumped on the bandwagon not knowing the full issues on why there was such controversy with UNDRIP. […]”\n\nMay 2020\n\nWriting for MLI’s Inside Policy magazine, Ken Coates claimed there was an “assault on the Alberta oil sands.”\n\n“All told, the cost of the Liberal government’s climate agenda fell disproportionately on Western Canada, on the energy industry and on rural businesses,” Coates wrote.\n\n“Singling out the Alberta energy sector while ignoring offshore oil production in Newfoundland, cement plants in Quebec, or the energy footprint of massive urban developments is disingenuous at best and mean-spirited at worst. Moreover, it leaves the impression that the country’s climate change aspirations can be met solely through an assault on the Alberta oil sands, which is not remotely true,” he added.\n\n“The Liberal government is politically devoted to its climate change agenda, even though current plans will have little impact on the global carbon footnote and will get little notice outside of Canada. Even Greta Thunberg will not be overly impressed.”\n\nCanada requires a climate change agenda, just not the one that it is currently following. There will be no immediate transition to a renewables-based economy, however much proponents of the so-called Green Economy might like it.”\n\nDecember 3, 2019\n\nJoseph Quesnel, identified as MLI’s “program manager of the Macdonald-Laurier Institute’s Aboriginal Canada and the Natural Resource Economy (ACNRE) project,” wrote an article in the Hill Times calling “Indigenous participation in energy sector an exercise in Indigenous self-determination, economic development.”\n\nQuesnel highlighted a statement by the pro-resource-development Indian Resource Council, criticizing a climate strike by Climate Justice Edmonton.\n\n“[T]hey might not have expected a stern reminder from a group called the Indian Resource Council. After all, climate activists believe they are the ones who speak for First Nations’ interests,” Quesnel wrote.\n\n“Some environmentalist groups act as ‘fair weather friends’ with Indigenous communities, if the communities oppose what they oppose. But Indigenous people are realists and pragmatists, realizing that in the remote regions they occupy, sometimes the resource sector is the only game in town. So, they work with that reality.”\n\nQuesnel concluded: “Politicians and activists need to understand how hardline positions on resource development will affect their professed commitments to improving Indigenous well-being. When politicians say they want to keep our resources in the ground, and then say in the next breath they want to improve conditions of First Nation communities, someone needs to call them out on the contradiction. That is what many Indigenous people would do, if they were included in this election debate rather than being left on the periphery.”\n\nQuesnel previously worked for more than 10 years with the Frontier Center for Public Policy, “where he specialized in Indigenous policy, but also property rights and water market issues.” He has also been a senior fellow at the Fraser Institute.\n\n2019\n\nThe Atlas Network funded MLI’s work to “tirelessly to educate policymakers on upcoming legislation.” Plans included “generating four research papers, two policy panels, and offering research-backed recommendations to specific bills that affect the Indigenous community” such as Bill C-262 regarding Canadian adoption of the U.N. Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples.\n\nThe Atlas Networked noted that MLI senior fellow Dwight Newman testified before the Senate Standing Committee in 2019 on “unintended consequences” of the legislation:\n\n“Newmann [sic] explained that, although the bill was intended to provide harmony between Indigenous people and the government, it would have led to massive uncertainty in the Canadian legal system since it was an international act that didn’t consider local priorities or the local economy. The bill was ultimately defeated.”\n\nJune 17, 2019\n\nMLI released a report titled “Breaking the Pipeline Logjam.” The document’s co-authors were Joseph Quesnel, MLI’s “program manager of the Macdonald-Laurier Institute’s Aboriginal Canada and the Natural Resource Economy (ACNRE) project” , and Ken Coates.\n\n“In this study, Quesnel and Coates identify the costs of a lack of pipeline capacity, in terms of Canadian jobs, our international competitiveness, and even our federation,” stated an MLI promotional release.\n\nThe study was part of the MLI’s “Mandate for Canada” series “examining key election issues.”\n\n“Canadians are beginning to understand what is at stake with the current pipeline logjam. They need to see how this issue affects more than just workers and economies in the West. Delayed and stalled pipelines affect us all. With this paper we aim to provide some guidance to all federal parties grappling with these issues,” Quesnel and Coates wrote in the study.\n\n“Focusing blame and the national climate change response on resource producers increases the costs on the companies that want to build additional pipelines. The debate has somehow left the impression that Alberta oil is ‘dirtier’ than other sources and less worthy of foreign export. Prejudice and misunderstanding surrounding Alberta’s oil sands has distorted the policy discussion and misdirected legislators to take a negative view of additional pipelines,” Coates and Quesnel wrote.\n\nListed under “Challenges to getting pipelines built,” the study claimed that “foreign-funded environmentalist campaigns” were key in the opposition to pipeline development in Canada, highlighting work on the topic by Canadian blogger Vivian Krause.\n\n“Those who intensely oppose the energy sector and additional pipeline capacity are a very small minority, albeit a very loud one. Many of these elements are funded by foreign foundations, largely from the United States. Many are motivated solely by authentic concern for the planet and the environment. However, some of this foundation support is suspect.\n\n“Independent researcher Vivian Krause has highlighted how some groups have adopted a clear strategy of land-locking the ‘tar sands’ to ensure that Alberta crude cannot reach the international market (Krause 2018). They use inflammatory and erroneous slogans such as ‘Tars sands oil is blood oil’ to motivate donors and activists to their cause. Government must inform the public about the realities of our energy sector and shine a large spotlight on these foreign-funded environmentalist campaigns.”\n\nThe report went on to highlight First Nations groups that have worked closely with MLI’s Aboriginal Canada and the Natural Resource Economy project, headed by Coates himself:\n\n“A growing number of pro-development Indigenous organizations, including the Indian Resource Council (IRC), First Nations Major Project Coalition, the First Nations LNG Alliance, and many individual communities, have become alarmed at the tone of the discussion. Unfortunately, the media is drawn to conflict and controversy.\n\n“This has resulted in a disproportionate focus on pipeline opponents. First Nation blockades make for more interesting headlines than formal collaborations. The media have started to give some attention to the Indigenous side that is supportive of pipelines and the energy sector. But pipeline opponents still often get far more public attention than pipeline supporters.”\n\nAccording to the report, “Stephen Buffalo, CEO of the IRC, has described the activity of environmental activists in Indigenous communities as a form of ‘environmental colonialism,’ in the sense that these environmentalist non-governmental organizations are trying to control First Nations communities and impose an anti-development agenda on them.”\n\nCoates and Quesnel claimed Indigenous communities generally were in favor of pipelines:\n\n“Indigenous communities are not the problem when it comes to delayed pipelines. First Nations, by and large, are supportive of the projects, as mentioned above. Indigenous opposition is largely, though not exclusively, focused on the BC coast.”\n\nThe report went on to outline MLI’s work in opposing certain elements of the U.N. Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples because of their potential impacts on pipelines:\n\n“Much of the controversy in the Indigenous world surrounds the legality and constitutionality of the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples (UNDRIP), particularly the articles dealing with a “free, prior, and informed consent” for resource development (the so-called FPIC section). The federal government deserves a large portion of the blame for the continuing confusion. When the Trudeau government declared its strong support for UNDRIP, many First Nation leaders and activists began to interpret this to mean that FPIC granted First Nations\n\na virtual legal veto over projects they did not support. However, legal and constitutional experts – including MLI’s own Dwight Newman – have stated clearly that the duty to consult does not equal a veto or a requirement for full consent or unanimity (Newman 2017).\n\n[…]\n\n“The federal government (and the provinces and territories) need to clarify the policies related to duty to consult so that project proponents know exactly what meaningful consultation means. If the proponents (the companies involved) have clear guidelines they can follow, there is less chance for legal action later on, which would greatly enhance the chance for timely pipeline approval.”\n\nThe report also criticized Bill-C69, legislation in the House of Commons designed to put a greater focus on the impacts of pipeline projects on Indigenous populations, as well as revising the list of activities that would trigger an impact assessment:\n\n“Bill C-69 has been almost universally opposed by pipeline interests as being unnecessarily obstructionist and adding potential delays,” Coates and Quesnel wrote, going on to say:\n\n“Indigenous groups – especially those involved in the oil and gas sector – are becoming increasingly vocal about the bill’s problematic aspects (Quesnel 2019). For example, the removal of a ‘standing test’ enables outside interests, potentially far removed geographically from the project, to participate and unnecessarily prolong assessment hearings. The bill mentions UNDRIP in the preamble without defining any limits to it or adopting any qualifying language. Also, the addition of gender, health, and climate change to the assessment criteria would make the approval process much more onerous. Many of the areas included in the bill are nebulous and difficult to measure. As well, it could be argued that carbon policies do not belong in an individual project assessment process but belong with wider regulatory and fiscal issues.”\n\nThey concluded in the report that the federal government “needs to recognize that most Canadians support the oil and gas industry and understand that the delays have created a national crisis.”\n\nOther recommendations included:\n\n“The federal government must delay Bill C-69 for at least three years to allow for improvements to\n\nthe legislation and to permit the industry to rebound from current difficulties. The government\n\nmust also scrap Bill C-48,” proposed legislation regarding regulation of marine oil transportation on the north coast of British Columbia.\n\n“Canadian supporters of the energy sector must make sure that Canadians understand the forces that are influencing national debates and conversations. The federal government needs to take an active role in exposing the foreign-funded groups that are undermining our economic interests. At one extreme, supporters might determine if there are legal means of preventing foreign-funded foundations and environmental organizations from undermining Canada’s pipeline projects, while ensuring that all actions are consistent with Charter protections on freedom of expression. […] On a national scale, the federal government could consider creating a parliamentary inquiry committee to investigate these matters as quickly as possible.”\n\nMarch 1, 2019\n\nJoseph Quesnel, identified as the program manager for the Macdonald-Laurier Institute’s Aboriginal Canada and the Natural Resource Economy project, wrote an opinion piece for the Financial Post opposing Bill C-69, in particular regarding additional impact assessments for pipeline projects.\n\n“Many industry observers have been spotlighting the growing evidence that foreign-funded environmental foundations are seeking to undermine our economic interests and keep oil and gas in the ground. First Nations and Métis communities are rightfully concerned that this more open standing test in Bill C-69 would allow foreign-funded environmentalists to hold up and prolong assessment hearings,” Quesnel claimed in the op-ed.\n\n“Also, mentioning the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples (UNDRIP) in the bill’s main preamble may please Indigenous academics and environmental activists, but it adds uncertainty to the process because UNDRIP includes controversial provisions that imply Indigenous communities have a veto over resource projects. This is important because preambles in legislation are used in courts and in interpreting statutes,” Quesnel wrote.\n\nDecember 2018\n\nMLI’s Inside Policy magazine . republished an op-ed opposing Bill C-69 by Stephen Buffalo, who represented the pro-resource development Indian Resource Council. The piece had originally run in the Financial Post.\n\n“Bill C-69 is being rushed through by a government that does not seem to understand its obligations to consult comprehensively with Indigenous peoples,” said Buffalo.\n\n“Far from being uniformly opposed to resource development, many Indigenous nations understand that careful engagement and effective partnerships will provide us with a once-in-a-century opportunity to share in Canada’s prosperity,” he added.\n\n“Our nations reject the permanent poverty that generations of government policies have imposed on us. And while many Indigenous peoples share some of the values and perspective of some members of the environmental movement, we resent the assumption that non-Indigenous environmentalists speak for us. We can speak for ourselves – and we insist on the right to do so.\n\n“The Indian Resource Council, the organization I represent, calls on the government of Canada to pull Bill C-69 from its legislative calendar and to revisit its consultations with Indigenous peoples and organizations.”\n\n2017\n\nAccording to MLI’s 2017 annual report, MLI senior fellow Ken Coates was “asked to advise the First Nations LNG Alliance in discussions with the BC government on LNG development” and “has also been advising the First Nations Major Projects Coalition.”\n\nMLI noted that Coates’ work was also used in a textbook titled Indigenous Peoples and Resource Development in Canada. “With this textbook, MLI’s thought leadership on Indigenous issues will spread to students in classrooms across the country,” MLI noted.\n\nThe annual report described MLI as effective at promoting pro-resource development policies:\n\n“We also remain influential with government. The federal government’s planned sweeping changes to major project assessments have heeded the advice of Coates and MLI author Bram Noble and included requirements for early and effective engagement with Indigenous communities,” MLI noted, adding:\n\n“Other aspects of the changes are more problematic, and MLI will be prominent in commenting on the legislation, encouraging fair, efficient and effective environmental assessments.”\n\nMLI also discussed its ties to federal Justice Minister Jody Wilson-Raybould:\n\n“Finally, MLI has deepened its ties to the federal Justice Minister, Jody Wilson Raybould, by naming her our Inside Policy Policy-Maker of the Year for her leadership on Indigenous issues. Coates was interviewed on APTN to discuss the issue and Wilson Raybould’s overall record. This relationship is important. Coates has on multiple occasions been invited to consult Wilson Raybould on Indigenous reconciliation and she has been very encouraging about MLI’s work.”\n\nJune 23, 2015\n\nMLI partnered with eco-pragmatist.com to bring Alex Epstein to Ottawa to discuss his book, The\n\nMoral Case for Fossil Fuels.\n\nAccording to MLI’s 2015 annual report, “The goal of the event was to help Canadians better appreciate the complexities of fossil fuel use and the climate change debate.”\n\n2015\n\nMLI’s 2015 annual report noted that it had partnered with the British Columbia Chamber of Commerce (BCCC) and the office of the Saskatchewan Treaty Commissioner to hold “a series of round tables across northern British Columbia and Saskatchewan from Prince Albert to Kitimat.” The events were intended to “create momentum for moving toward real agreements with respect to the resource economy.”\n\nThe roundtable series was part of MLI’s Aboriginal Canada and the Natural Resource Economy (ACNRE) project.\n\n“Attendance at the roundtables included the Haisla Chief, a Nisga’a leader, the Prince Rupert Port Authority CEO and a national representative from Seven Generations Energy, as well as members of the Treaty 8 First Nations, and the Northern Gateway Community Advisory Board,” MLI noted.\n\nJune 2014\n\nFraser Institute senior fellow Ross McKitrick co-authored an MLI paper on biofuels, titled “Money to Burn,” with fellow University of Guelph economics professor Douglas Auld.\n\n“[A]ny reduction in GHG achieved by blending ethanol and gasoline continues to yield negative net social benefits,” Auld and McKitrick wrote.\n\nThey concluded: “The most obvious recommendation to emerge from this analysis is the need to phase out the major components of current transportation biofuel policy on the grounds that the costs far exceed the social benefits and there are no realistic prospects for this situation to change.”\n\nOctober 2014\n\nRobert P. Murphy, an economist associated with Koch- and Exxon-funded U.S. think tanks including the Pacific Research Institute and the Institute for Energy Research (IER), wrote a MLI study critical of the carbon tax in Canada.\n\n“All in all, conservative supporters of the market economy must think very hard before endorsing a carbon tax – even if promised with other tax cuts. Even in theory, it is unlikely that such a policy would be “good for the economy,” and in practice it would be very inefficient,” Murphy concluded.\n\nMLI noted in its annual report that Murphy’s “point was emphasized by MLI Senior Fellow Philip Cross in National Post columns, on the Business News Network, and in a debate on CBC’s The 180.”\n\nRelated Organizations\n\nAtlas Network — Member.\n\nIndian Resource Council — “By working directly with groups such as the Indian Resource Council and the First Nations Major Project Coalition, MLI has made it a point of emphasis to include their perspectives in their research and advocacy,” MLI wrote.\n\nFirst Nations Major Projects Coalition — Has worked “directly with” MLI.\n\nFirst Nations LNG Alliance — Ken Coates of MLI “has long been a friend of the Alliance.\n\nIndigenous Resource Network — MLI senior fellow Heather Exner-Pirot is also a research advisor to the Indigenous Resource Network.
