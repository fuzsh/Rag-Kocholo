        "text": "TurboTax to Match up to $1 Million to Help Veterans, Military Families Facing Financial Hardship\n\nSAN DIEGO & ROCKVILLE, Md.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- America's servicemen and women face hardships at home as well as overseas. The car breaks down. An unexpected expense cuts into rent money. A medical bill means there is less to put toward food or utilities.\n\nTo help veterans and active duty military win the financial battle at home, TurboTax® and Operation Homefront have launched Mission2Match (www.mission2match.com), a cooperative fundraising effort to support troops and their families facing money emergencies. TurboTax is the nation's leading tax software and Operation Homefront is a charitable organization that provides emergency financial support and assistance to America's servicemen and women.\n\nIntuit Inc. (NAS: INTU) , maker of TurboTax and the Intuit Financial Freedom Foundation will match up to $1 million for donations made now through April 15, 2013.\n\n\"Tax time is when many Americans are most focused on their charitable giving, and we're grateful that TurboTax has taken an innovative approach to provide significant and meaningful assistance to military families,\" said Jim Knotts, president and chief executive officer of Operation Homefront. \"We've found that many people want to support our service members, but don't always know how. By combining their technology and huge public reach, TurboTax is giving their customers the opportunity to provide that support exactly when it is most on their minds.\n\nHow to give\n\nTurboTax Online customers will be given the opportunity to donate from within the product after they've completed their taxes. Donations also will be accepted at www.mission2match.com. Only donations made through the Mission2Match campaign are eligible for matching. Donations will be matched a second time when donors tweet (#mission2match) via Twitter and share the opportunity to give with their social network.\n\n\"We're proud to support our troops,\" said Dan Maurer, senior vice president and general manager of Intuit's Consumer Group. \"TurboTax has a long history of supporting the military and many of our employees have served our country. We're asking our customers to join us and give generously to support U.S. servicemen and women and their families.\"\n\nFree Tax Filing for Junior Enlisted\n\nTurboTax has also released a new product to further support U.S. troops. TurboTax Military Edition is personalized to the specific needs of military filers and was created by active, reserve and retired military personnel and military spouses to address the specific challenges that come with being a military tax filer.\n\nWith step-by-step guidance to help them claim every deduction and credit they're entitled to, TurboTax Military Edition guides customers through everything from state of residency and filing in multiple states to combat pay as well as tax deductions for uniforms, relocation, PCS and special provisions for the earned income tax credit - helping them keep more of what's theirs.
