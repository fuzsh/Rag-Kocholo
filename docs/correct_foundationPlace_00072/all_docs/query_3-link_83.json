        "text": "Our commitment to corporate inclusion and DEI is foundational to our company and explicit in our values as we do our part to improve diversity in tech statistics in 2023 and work to create an environment where employees can do the best work of their lives. Our value of Stronger Together emphasizes the importance of diverse voices to deliver incredible results for our customers and fulfill our mission of powering prosperity for all.\n\nDiversity, equity, and inclusion has become even more important given the extraordinary challenges we’ve been facing as a society—from public displays of systemic racism to the inequalities exacerbated by the current state of the world. While corporate inclusion and diversity has been a core principle of our business since its founding, these recent events have accelerated our efforts to ensure we’re delivering on our commitment to diversity. We’ve established new leadership roles and resources, created new listening forums, and invested in building new capabilities to support our employees, customers, and communities.\n\nDiversity, equity, inclusion, and belonging (DEIB)\n\nWe’d also like to recognize diversity, equity, inclusion, and belonging (DEIB) as an emerging variation of DEI that we support. The addition of B for belonging represents when employees feel included and accepted as a result of successful DEI initiatives at an organization. We strive for all our employees to feel a sense of belonging and don’t believe DEI initiatives are successful without it.\n\nRepresentation is a key step in creating an inclusive and equitable environment where all employees can do the best work of their lives. Without representation, we cannot deliver for customers and achieve our mission. We have invested in programs and initiatives to foster DEI within our company. We declared True North Goals related to employee representation focused on increasing the percentage of women in technology roles as well as the percentage of our total U.S.-based workforce composed of underrepresented racial groups. These aspirational goals are part of our long-term desire to have a workforce that reflects the diversity of our customers. We don’t set quotas or make employment decisions based on an individual’s identity.\n\nData and goals do not include Credit Karma, which maintains separate record-keeping systems.\n\nIn FY23, we increased the representation of women in technology reaching 34 percent of the technology organization. We set a goal to increase the representation of women in technology roles at Intuit to 38 percent globally by FY25.*\n\n*Data and goals do not include Credit Karma, which maintains separate record-keeping systems\n\nWe've made progress in improving representation, but know we must do more. We set a goal to increase representation of underrepresented groups—those who identify as Black/African American, Hispanic/Latino and Native American, Native Alaskan and Native Hawaiian—to 19 percent of our U.S.-based workforce by FY25.*\n\n*Data and goals do not include Credit Karma, which maintains separate record-keeping systems.\n\nPay equity is fundamental to our corporate inclusion and diversity strategy. We're committed to pay equity and work to conduct an in-depth global analysis twice a year. Our HR team makes the necessary adjustments and shares the results to hold us accountable, while ensuring continuous improvement. This includes a review of all job codes in which we have enough employees for analysis, and those employees have the same or similar job duties and compensation mix.\n\nAs of August 1, 2023, none of the identified job codes had statistically significant differences in pay between employees of different gender or between race/ethnicity in the U.S.\n\nOne of our proudest contributions to corporate diversity and inclusion is our continued progress in increasing women's representation in technology.\n\nThis is largely due to the supportive structure we’ve cultivated through Tech Women @ Intuit. It’s a strategic initiative that offers women in technology roles the programs and initiatives that support their success throughout their career lifecycle, from just starting out to excelling in their craft.\n\nThe Racial Equity Advancement Leadership (REAL) Team was created in 2020 to understand the nuance of the Black employee experience and provide meaningful counsel to the company’s strategy, the team’s evolution will continue to inspire change. We recently expanded the team to include Hispanic/Latino and Indigenous employees to ensure the voices of underrepresented employees are heard.\n\nIn partnership with the REAL Team, our Talent Acquisition Team, people managers and with input from our 14 Employee Resource Groups, we've reexamined our hiring, retention, promotion and pay policies and practices to continue to attract talent from underrepresented communities and foster more positive employee experiences, community and belonging once they are part of the Intuit family. This work is well underway. While we have increased representation of underrepresented communities at all levels, we know we have more work to do.\n\nIntuit strives for the best in website accessibility to ensure our products and experiences are open to everyone–regardless of education level, physical, sensory, or cognitive ability, gender, or other attributes. When we create accessible products, we make things better for everyone–with increased access, reduced friction, and smoother experiences for the greatest number of people.\n\nWe currently have 14 employee-led ERGs across six countries, with 23% of our full-time employees belonging to at least one ERG. These groups, and their diverse members, add richness to our workplace culture. They offer community and the opportunity to learn from role models, experts, and peers. Our ERGs are open to all and they invite our employees to bring their whole selves to work. They also actively volunteer in their communities, which is an important part of their charters.\n\nFollowing a three-month pilot in 2022, we launched Intuit’s ERG-sponsored mentorship program, open to all ERG members. It supports career growth, builds inclusive communities, and provides meaningful connections. Mentees and mentors are matched based on what they’d like to learn and what they have to offer.\n\nTo make meaningful strides in representation, we’re increasing the aperture for recruiting to ensure we’re employing diverse talent across every level of the organization. We’ve expanded our external talent acquisition network to include more than 40 universities and student organizations, key annual conferences, partner associations and more to gain access to top underrepresented community talent for all functions and levels of roles. We’re proud to partner with the following organizations."
