Deciding which accounting software is best can be daunting, with dozens of options available. Do you choose QuickBooks or Sage? In this Sage vs. QuickBooks guide, we’ll compare these two popular accounting software options to help you determine which is best for your business.\n\nFeatured Partners\n\nAdvertisement\n\n1\n\nXero\n\nStarting price\n\nReg.

It offers features such as expense tracking, cash flow management, invoicing, automation, Mac compatibility and reporting. Sage does not offer transparent pricing on its website. You must fill out a form to get a quote.\n\nIntuit QuickBooks offers both Desktop and Online versions, with a variety of plans under each option. It provides features such as a mobile app, invoicing, income tracking, cash flow management, management of 1099 contractors, mileage tracking and app integrations. Chances are, whether you outsource your accounting or keep it in-house, your accountant or bookkeeper knows how to use it. This is because it’s one of the most popular accounting platforms available.\n\nQuickBooks plans start at $30 per month for its Self-Employed version and its Enterprise Desktop plans go up to $4,668 per year. None of its Desktop plans can be paid annually and to pay annually with its Online plans, you make the switch in the settings after signing up for a monthly plan.\n\nSage\n\n4.1\n\nOur ratings take into account a product's cost, features, ease of use, customer service and other category-specific attributes.

The software is easy to use and provides a variety of features to help businesses track their income and expenses, create invoices and estimates, and manage their cash flow. It’s a comprehensive solution for small business accounting needs.\n\nA key feature of Sage is the ability to automate workflows in your business. This means you can auto-invoice, auto-expense and auto-pay right from your connected accounts. It integrates with Stripe, which means you get paid quickly when a customer clicks on the “pay now” button on your invoices. Another attractive feature is it works from the cloud, so you can collaborate in real time on the go, no matter the device.\n\nPlus, get 24/7 chat support and speak with an expert Monday through Friday during business hours for a live Q&A session with a Sage Success Coach. With phone support, its hours are limited to 9:30 a.m. to 5:30 p.m. ET Monday through Friday. If you need assistance outside business hours, check out the step-by-step guides, online community and instructor-led courses. There are also prerecorded webinars and video guides to assist you.\n\nPros & Cons\n\nAutomate essential tasks\n\nHas a mobile app\n\nFree 30-day trial\n\nPayroll is additional\n\nAutoEntry costs extra\n\nNo transparent pricing\n\nQuickBooks\n\n4.3\n\nOur ratings take into account a product's cost, features, ease of use, customer service and other category-specific attributes.

There are two versions available, each with multiple plans. QuickBooks Online is a cloud-based software that allows users to access their accounts from anywhere, as long as they have an internet connection.\n\nWith QuickBooks Desktop, the software is installed locally and isn’t reliant on internet connectivity. QuickBooks Online is cloud-based, so you can access it from anywhere you have an internet connection. It’s important to understand if you pay for both versions, you cannot sync between the two—they’re separate products. However, you can collaborate with other users, provided your plan comes with multiple users.\n\nFor Desktop, you pay an annual fee starting at $1,922 and get features such as sales tax tracking, invoicing, up to three users (although they must pay for their own accounts), time tracking, inventory, reports, unlimited customer support and accounts payable.\n\nOnline is available with a monthly fee starting at $30 and includes self-employed features, such as Schedule C deductions, mileage tracking and automatic calculation of quarterly estimated taxes. Starting at $55 per month, invest in one of its small business plans and send invoices, accept payments, manage cash flow, track mileage, send estimates, manage 1099 contractors and take advantage of its robust mobile app. Discounts of 50 percent off for the first three months of each plan are often available.\n\nPros & Cons\n\nEasy to use\n\nMost bookkeepers and accountants know how to use it\n\nPay 1099 contractors\n\nSome plans require all users to pay for their own accounts\n\nLimited amount of users for every plan\n\nNo monthly billing for Desktop\n\nHow the Products Stack Up\n\nSage QuickBooks\n\nPrices Start At\n\nPricing by request\n\n$30 per month\n\nMaximum Users\n\nYes\n\nNo\n\nPayroll\n\nFor a fee\n\nFor a fee\n\nMileage Tracking\n\nNo\n\nYes\n\nInvoicing\n\nYes\n\nYes\n\nForecasting\n\nYes\n\nYes\n\nSage Intacct is intended for small to mid-sized businesses with 20 or more employees. QuickBooks has a plan called Self-Employed and starts at $15 per month. QuickBooks’ other plans start at $25 per month and go up to $1,340 per year, depending on if you need Enterprise solutions or something simple.\n\nQuickBooks limits the number of users who can access an account, and with some plans, even requires those additional users to pay for their own account. Meanwhile, Sage includes unlimited users, making it ideal for small and medium offices.\n\nBoth providers charge a fee for payroll services. Bundle your payroll and bookkeeping plans with QuickBooks to save money, otherwise, payroll-only plans start at $45 per month. Sage HRMS Payroll is available as a stand-alone or bundled with your plan, but you need to contact Sage for a custom quote for this.\n\nFeatured Partners\n\nAdvertisement\n\n1\n\nBookkeeper360\n\nPrice\n\nStarting at $49 per month\n\nBookkeeping, Tax, Back-Office, Payroll, Advisory\n\nYes\n\nMonthly commitment & 100% US-Based\n\nYes\n\n1\n\nBookkeeper360\n\nLearn More\n\nOn Bookkeeper360's Website\n\n2\n\n1-800Accountant\n\nStarting Price\n\nStarting from $179 per month\n\nKey Features\n\nDedicated bookkeeper, tax preparation, tax advisory, payroll\n\nFree Consultation\n\nYes\n\n2\n\n1-800Accountant\n\nLearn More\n\nOn 1-800Accountant's Website\n\n3\n\nQuickBooks\n\nStarting price\n\n$15 per month (for the first 3-months, then $30 per month)\n\nFree Trial\n\n30 days\n\nKey Features\n\nExpert help, Invoicing, maximize tax deductions, track mileage\n\n3\n\nQuickBooks\n\nLearn More\n\nOn QuickBooks' Website\n\nWhile Sage has an option to reimburse employees for gas purchases, there’s no real mileage-tracking feature such as what QuickBooks has with its plans. Depending on which plan you choose with QuickBooks and Sage, you can forecast your cash flow. Invoicing is also a standard feature with both providers.\n\nBottom Line\n\nSage and QuickBooks are strong contenders. Both of these solutions include mobile apps, an easy-to-use interface, reports, invoicing and payroll options. Depending on which plan you choose, they can also be comparable in price. However, a few things set these products apart.\n\nChoose Sage if you need unlimited users and automated tasks. QuickBooks is ideal for small businesses that need advanced features, such as 1099 contractor management and mileage tracking.
