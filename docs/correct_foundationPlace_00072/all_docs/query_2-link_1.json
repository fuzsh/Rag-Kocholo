        "text": "So proud of our very own Chris Kallinis for winning the Bill Campbell Coach Award announced at our State of the Company by Intuit CEO, Sasan Goodarzi! This annual award recognizes 3 Intuit employees that exemplify the qualities that made Bill Campbell - our former Intuit CEO and Chairman of the Board - such an incredible advisor to some of tech’s greatest, including our very own Brad Smith. While today, he was recognized for his exceptional contributions to the mentorship and growth of our employees - he's also an incredible champion of diversity and inclusion as an executive coach for our Pride and African Ancestry employee resource groups. In his role as Site Leader for Intuit Toronto, Chris has strengthened our community as a whole, and is leading the way as we prepare for the opening of our new talent hub in downtown Toronto this summer. Chris - thank you for your passion for our people, and all that you do to make Intuit such a special place to work! “People are the foundation of any company’s success…great people flourish in an environment that liberates and amplifies that energy.” Bill Campbell, “The Coach”"
