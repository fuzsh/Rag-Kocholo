        "text": "The under-construction Intuit Dome in Los Angeles has been chosen to host the NBA All-Star 2026 game.\n\nThe Washington Post said that Intuit Dome, which is set to open in August in Inglewood, California, will host All-Star Weekend in 2026.\n\nThe NBA’s Los Angeles Clippers are set to relocate from downtown Crypto.com Arena for the 2024-25 season.\n\nIntuit Dome sits near Kia Forum, previously home to the Los Angeles Lakers, and across the street from SoFi Stadium, home to the NFL’s Rams and Chargers.\n\nThe oval-shaped arena, which boasts a distinct honeycomb exterior design, is about 10 miles southwest of Crypto.com Arena, which opened in 1999 and hosted All-Star Weekend in 2004, 2011 and 2018.\n\nNBA Commissioner Adam Silver made the All-Star announcement during a press conference at Intuit Dome, where he was joined by Clippers Chairman Steve Ballmer, Clippers President of Business Operations Gillian Zucker, Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass and Inglewood Mayor James T. Butts Jr.\n\nSilver said, “The Intuit Dome promises to present a unique and innovative live basketball experience which will be an extraordinary venue for the NBA All-Star Game in 2026. Thanks again to Steve Ballmer, Gillian Zucker, and the Clippers organization for their commitment to delivering a world-class showcase of the very best of our sport.”\n\nBallmer added, “We are building Intuit Dome to house and showcase the best basketball players in the world, and we are honored they will all be under our roof for NBA All-Star. Along with Inglewood and Los Angeles, we thank the NBA for bringing the league’s marquee event to Intuit Dome in 2026.”\n\nSilver also announced that Intuit Dome will be the basketball venue for the 2028 Summer Olympics in Los Angeles, hailing the building as a “fantastic showcase for global basketball.”\n\nThe Washington Post further stated that Intuit Dome is slated to feature a 44,000-square-foot scoreboard, the widest seats in the NBA, automated and cashier-less concession areas and 51 uninterrupted rows of baseline seats known as “The Wall,” which is intended to house the Clippers’ loudest fans.\n\nRather than highlighting luxury boxes and suites, the arena was designed to retain noise and was outfitted with technology capable of tracking fan behavior in hopes of creating a competitive advantage for the Clippers, who have never won an NBA title.\n\nThe 75th NBA All-Star Game will take place on Sunday, Feb. 15, 2026.\n\nThis will mark the record seventh NBA All-Star in Los Angeles, and the first time the Intuit Dome will host the annual midseason showcase reaching fans in more than 200 countries and territories in more than 50 languages.\n\nThe LA Clippers worked in collaboration with the Los Angeles Sports & Entertainment Commission to bring NBA All-Star 2026 to Los Angeles.\n\nNBA All-Star on-court events will tip off on Friday, Feb. 13 at Intuit Dome with NBA Rising Stars, an annual showcase for top rookies and second-year NBA players. On Feb. 14, State Farm All-Star Saturday Night will feature the Kia Skills Challenge, the Starry 3-Point Challenge and AT&T Slam Dunk. NBA All-Star 2026 will culminate with the NBA All-Star Game on Sunday, Feb. 15.\n\nThe NBA will host several events for fans of all ages at venues throughout Los Angeles and Inglewood, including at Kia Forum and the Los Angeles Convention Center. These events, including NBA All-Star Practice presented by AT&T, the Ruffles NBA All-Star Celebrity Game and an NBA All-Star fan fest, will feature basketball programming and entertainment for fans as well as up-close access to NBA players, legends and celebrities.\n\nThe league will also continue to celebrate its commitment to social responsibility with a full schedule of NBA Cares events during NBA All-Star 2026. Through partnerships with schools, local and national nonprofit organizations, the league will reach thousands of children and families in Los Angeles, Inglewood and the surrounding areas and provide critical resources to community-based programs.\n\nThis will mark the record seventh NBA All-Star in the Los Angeles area, which hosted the event in 2018, 2011, 2004, 1983, 1972 and 1963.\n\nThe NBA will hold 2024 All-Star Weekend at Indianapolis’s Gainbridge Fieldhouse in February and the 2025 event at San Francisco’s Chase Center.\n\nContinue to follow Coliseum for latest updates on venues business news.
