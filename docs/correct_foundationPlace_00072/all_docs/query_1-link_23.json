        "text": "For organizations of any size in Edmonton Alberta, Progent offers easy, fast, and affordable contact with Cisco CCIE-Premier network experts. CCIEs are top-level network professionals who earn this elite certification only after rigorous examinations by Cisco. CCIE-qualified engineers can tackle the most complex issues surrounding network integration, troubleshooting, and configuration. Progent's CCIE-certified support specialists operate closely with Cisco's internal engineers in analyzing anomalies with Cisco IOS or Cisco NX-OS software and developing temporary alternatives or receiving software updates to fix problems. A Cisco CCIE knows how to detect the source of network difficulties stemming from hardware or applications.\n\nProgent offers fast remote access to a CCIE specialist so you can receive high-level assistance for complicated network issues that are impacting productivity but are beyond the experience of your ordinary network maintenance organization. Progent's CCIE-Certified support professionals can access your network using advanced remote support tools that allow them to provide fast and low-cost analysis and repair of critical network problems.\n\nProgent's CCIE Support Services\n\nThe vast majority of CCIEs are employed by large corporations or nationwide ISPs, and consequently their services are not readily accessible to smaller organizations.
