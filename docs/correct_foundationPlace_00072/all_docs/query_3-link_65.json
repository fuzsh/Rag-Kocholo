The premier innovative growth company casts wide nets to find the best people with the best skills to hire and then supports their employees well being through exceptional programs. The result of this dedication was acknowledged with the company being named as one of Canada's Best Diversity Employers for 2008. \"Diversity is central to the Canadian mosaic and Intuit's culture,\" says Yves Millette, President & CEO, Intuit Canada. \"We want our employees to bring their whole self to work, to grow both professionally and personally, and to learn from each other along the way.
