The word Inuit means \"the people\" in the Inuit language of Inuktut. The singular of Inuit is Inuk.\n\nAccording to the 2021 Census, there are 69,7051Footnote 1 Inuit in Canada.\n\nMany Inuit in Canada live in Inuit Nunangat, which means \"the place where Inuit live.\"\n\nInuit Nunangat is comprised of 4 regions:\n\nInuvialuit (Northwest Territories and Yukon)\n\nNunavik (Northern Quebec)\n\nNunatsiavut (Labrador)\n\nNunavut\n\nFind out more\n\nInuit: Indigenous Peoples Atlas of Canada\n\nInuit health: Selected findings from the 2012 Aboriginal Peoples Survey\n\nTungasuvvingat Inuit: Inuit community centre\n\nOttawa Inuit Children's Centre\n\nManitoba Inuit Association\n\nInuktut\n\nInuktut is spoken throughout Inuit Nunangat, and each region has its own dialects. There are two written styles of Inuktut, syllabics and roman orthography.\n\nSyllabics use symbols to represent sounds rather than letters. Roman orthography uses the English alphabet to sound out the words in Inuktut.\n\nNanilavut: Let's find them\n\nTuberculosis in Canada was at epidemic proportions in the early 20th century and peaked between the 1940s and 1960s. A significant number of Inuit were affected and sent away from their communities to undergo treatment.\n\nMany patients were treated and returned home. Others succumbed to the illness and were buried in cemeteries near the treatment facilities.\n\nTo right historical wrongs, in 2010 the Government of Canada established a working group at the request of Nunavut Tunngavik Inc., which includes:\n\nall Inuit land claim holders\n\nInuit Tapiriit Kanatami\n\nPauktuutit\n\nthe Government of Nunavut\n\nthe Government of the Northwest Territories\n\nthe Government of Canada\n\nThis group is called Nanilavut, which means \"let's find them\" in Inuktut.\n\nThrough the guidance of the Nanilavut working group, comprehensive research was undertaken on finding Inuit lost loved ones from the past tuberculosis epidemic, and a database was created containing records of those that were sent away for medical treatment during the epidemic. The Government of Canada is working in partnership with Inuit leadership on the Nanilavut initiative in order to properly address this historical wrong.\n\nIn February 2017, the Prime Minister signed a declaration to create the Inuit-Crown Partnership Committee (ICPC), which advances the shared priorities of Inuit and the Government of Canada. Canada is working through the ICPC to finalize the federal response to Nanilavut to help bring closure and begin the healing process for families and communities.\n\nFind out more\n\nThe Nanilavut Initiative\n\nBuilding Inuit economic success, including art\n\nAccording to the 2021 Census, the Inuit population is young, with a median age of 25.2. The Government of Canada has several programs and initiatives to help young Inuit fully participate in the Canadian economy.\n\nThe First Nations and Inuit Youth Employment Strategy supports initiatives that provide Inuit and First Nations youth with work experience, information about career options and opportunities to develop skills that help them gain employment and develop careers.\n\nThe Federal Framework for Aboriginal Economic Development was launched in 2009 to guide federal actions towards increasing the participation of Inuit, First Nations and Métis in the Canadian economy. This was followed by the Strategic Partnerships Initiative in 2010, which helps to increase Indigenous participation in complex economic opportunities.\n\nAs well, Inuit in Nunavut participated in the construction of the Canadian High Arctic Research Station. The station's design was developed through the Inuit Quajimajatuqangit approach, which articulates the pillars of traditional Inuit knowledge.\n\nInuit art\n\nThe arts are a vital element of Inuit culture and traditions. Cape Dorset in Nunavut is known as the \"Capital of Inuit Art\" and 1 out of 5 workers here are employed in the arts.\n\nFor decades, Inuit art has played an integral role in the northern economy and contributed millions of dollars to the regional economy.\n\nIn July 2017, the Government of Canada officially transferred the responsibility for the management of the Igloo Tag trademark to the Inuit Art Foundation (IAF). This decision was taken after extensive consultations with members of the Inuit art industry. The objective of this transfer is to increase the Inuit art community's ability to regulate art in a way that benefit Inuit artists and help preserve the values of Inuit cultural heritage for generations to come.\n\nThe IAF supports Inuit artists and the development and appreciation of Inuit art and promotes Inuit artists from all four northern regions (Inuvialuit, Nunavut, Nunavik and Nunatsiavut) in Canada and internationally.\n\nCIRNAC has developed a comprehensive analysis of the Inuit arts economy, such as fine arts, music, film, theatre and other forms. The study includes a full economic analysis of the Inuit arts economy in each of the four Inuit regions, as well as southern Canada. It will inform policy development to better support Inuit arts and artists in Canada.\n\nFind out more\n\nImpact of the Inuit arts economy\n\nThe education and employment experiences of Inuit: Aboriginal Peoples Survey, 2012\n\nSustainable Development Working Group of the Arctic Council\n\nDevolution and land claims agreements in Inuit Nunangat\n\nNorthern governance and placing more control into the hands of Northerners are major parts of Canada's Arctic and Northern Policy.\n\nYukon devolution\n\nNorthwest Territories devolution\n\nNunavut devolution\n\nInuit land claims agreements have been signed in all 4 Inuit regions:\n\nThe James Bay and Northern Quebec Agreement in Nunavik in 1975\n\nThe Western Arctic (Inuvialuit) Claims Settlement Act in Inuvialuit in 1984\n\nThe Nunavut Land Claims Agreement Act in Nunavut in 1993\n\nThe Land Claims Agreement between the Inuit of Labrador and Her Majesty the Queen in Right of Newfoundland and Labrador and Her Majesty the Queen in Right of Canada in Nunatsiavut in 2005\n\nUnder their respective land claims agreements, Inuit were granted title to certain blocks of land. The four land claims regions cover about 40 per cent of Canada's land mass.\n\nUnder the Western Arctic (Inuvialuit) Claims Settlement Act, Inuvialuit of the Inuvialuit Settlement Region, have title to approximately 91,000 square kilometres of land.\n\nUnder the Nunavut Land Claims Agreement Act, Inuit in Nunavut have title to 352,191 square kilometres of land.\n\nInuit of Nunavik have title to 8,152 square kilometres of land and exercise some rights over 992,307.58 square kilometres of land. They also have title to approximately 5,100 square kilometres of land on the islands in the Nunavik marine region.\n\nUnder the Land Claims Agreement between the Inuit of Labrador and Her Majesty the Queen in Right of Newfoundland and Labrador and Her Majesty the Queen in Right Canada, Inuit of Nunatsiavut have title to approximately 15,800 square kilometres of land within the Labrador Inuit Settlement Area and rights over 72,520 square kilometres of land in northern Labrador.\n\nGovernment of Canada's apology for the Inuit High Arctic relocation\n\nIn August 2010, the former Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development and Federal Interlocutor for Métis and Non-Status Indians apologized to Inuit families who were relocated in the 1950s to the High Arctic. During these relocations, Inuit families from Port Harrison (Inukjuak) in Northern Québec and Pond Inlet in Nunavut were moved to the High Arctic communities of Resolute Bay and Grise Fiord (Craig Harbour) in Nunavut.\n\nInuit who were relocated had to adapt to colder climates and longer periods of total light or darkness. Inuit were separated from home communities and extended family were not provided with adequate shelter or supplies, and were not properly informed of where they would be located or for how long.\n\nThe 2010 apology helped Inuit affected by the relocation continue to move towards healing and reconciliation.\n\nFind out more\n\nReconciliation\n\nHighlights from the Report of the Royal Commission on Aboriginal Peoples\n\nThe department's role\n\nCIRNAC negotiates and implements Acts, agreements, treaties and land claims on behalf of the Government of Canada. The department is also responsible for fulfilling obligations in historic treaties. Strong partnerships among Indigenous peoples, governments and the private sector continue to emerge as we address outstanding land claims and treaty issues and work toward self-government.\n\nCIRNAC works with Inuit organizations, and territorial and provincial governments to build social well-being, economic prosperity and healthy communities for the Inuit of Nunatsiavut, Nunavik, Nunavut and the Inuvialuit Settlement Region. This includes support for the Nunavik Housing Policy and coordinating the Nunatsiavut Housing Needs Assessment. Issues that are outside of negotiated land claims agreements and are not covered through on-reserve housing policies and programs.\n\nCIRNAC promotes circumpolar cooperation and plays a role in the Arctic Council.\n\nInuit organizations\n\nCIRNAC partners with many Inuit organizations, including:\n\nAvataq Cultural Institute\n\nInuit Circumpolar Council\n\nInuit Tapiriit Kanatami\n\nInuvialuit Regional Corporation\n\nMakivik Corporation\n\nNunatsiavut Government\n\nNunavut Tunngavik Incorporated\n\nPauktuutit — Inuit Women of Canada"
