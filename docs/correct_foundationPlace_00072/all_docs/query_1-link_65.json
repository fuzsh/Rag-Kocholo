Research has been the core of Prosci’s business since our inception in 1994.\n\nBy studying what change leaders are doing that works well and what doesn’t, and how to implement change most effectively, we can derive best practices and create repeatable, scalable ways to manage the people side of change. We’re here to help you build your change capabilities.\n\nnull"
