        "text": "When much of human activity moved online during the height of the pandemic, tech companies were thriving. Call it the COVID tech bubble. Now we’ve hit the COVID tech bust.\n\nBy the second half of 2022, tech companies had initiated significant layoffs -- something that had followed an extended period of frenzied tech hiring and attention to employee experience. Standard explanations for the cuts were that companies hired too many during the pandemic and they were looking at the specter of a recession in the months ahead. It sounds a lot like the dot-com boom and bust of yore. Not all companies are impacted equally. It’s the ones that hired at an accelerated rate during the boom that seem to be hitting the brakes right now.\n\nAt the same time, IT pros with cybersecurity, cloud, and data analytics/machine learning skills have remained in high demand so far.\n\nIn this space, InformationWeek will document some of the more significant layoffs, updated regularly. Be sure to check back.\n\nHere's a look at the biggest tech layoffs so far:\n\nJuly 2024 Tech Layoffs\n\nMagic Leap, July 19, 2024 announcement. Layoff of 75 people.\n\nThe augmented reality startup laid off about 75 employees on Thursday, which included its entire sales and marketing teams, according to Bloomberg. The move appears to be a crushing blow for a company that had so much promise. “Magic Leap has been evolving our go-to-market approach to better align with market dynamics and emerging opportunities, optimizing how we support our customers and our ecosystem,” a Magic Leap spokesperson told Bloomberg regarding the cuts. However, there may be a silver lining for Magic Leap despite the shift in business strategy, as it may reportedly seek to license its technology to Google. The two companies announced a “strategic technology partnership” last month, which is focused on the augmented reality market.\n\nMercari U.S., July 19, 2024 announcement. Layoff of 50% of workforce.\n\nAmid struggles with falling sales and competition from low-price Chinese e-commerce rivals like Temu, Japanese online marketplace Mercari has laid off nearly half of the employees from its US subsidiary, according to Nikkei. Though Mercari reportedly has no plans to withdraw from the US, “a decision was made to ensure a sustainable business structure.” As a result of the cuts, the company employs just over 100 people.\n\nAqua Security, July 16, 2024 announcement. Layoff of 50 people, 10% of workforce.\n\nThe cyber company is laying off 50 employees, or 10% of its workforce amid a restructuring effort, according to Calcalist. Most of the impacted employees are reportedly not based in Israel. Aqua Security's headquarters are located in Boston and Ramat Gan, and it employs 500 people. “Aqua has carried out an organizational streamlining move to focus the company and its resources to address the most pressing needs of our customers, protecting the critical applications they develop and manage in the cloud. The move is global and also affects our employees in Israel, proportionally to the rest of the world,” the company said in statement obtained by Calcalist.\n\nON, July 16, 2024 announcement. Layoff of entire workforce.\n\nThe enterprise AI startup formerly known as GameOnTechnology, laid off its entire 60-person staff after reportedly discovering that $11 million in cash was missing, according to VentureBeat. CEO Alex Beckman resigned, allegedly under pressure from ON's board according to a letter that was sent to all shareholders from other company officers. In addition, the officers alleged they discovered that only 37 cents was left in an account that was supposed to have $11 million. After Beckman's exit, the board reportedly conducted an investigation and discovered many of his representations about ON's finances and operations turned out to “be abjectly false.” Operations have been paused as a result of the cuts.\n\nKaspersky, July 16, 2024 announcement. Layoff of entire U.S. workforce.\n\nThe Russian cybersecurity company is laying off dozens of employees and leave the US market in response to a US government order in June, which banned the sale of Kaspersky's software due to security risks, according to TechCrunch. In addition, Kaspersky will reportedly “gradually wind down” stateside operations when the ban goes into effect on July 20. According to the report, the company's US business is “no longer viable” and will impact less than 50 employees. The ban was the first of its kind when announced by the U.S. Commerce Department.\n\nSolarEdge Technologies, July 15, 2024 announcement. Layoff of 400 people.\n\nIn an attempt to restore profitability and ensure financial stability, SolarEdge announced layoffs on Monday in a memo to staff that will impact 400 employees, which includes 200 employees in Israel, according to Reuters. The restructuring move is set to take place across every department and includes a reduction in discretionary spending. SolarEdge reportedly initiated the move in response to a downturn in the market at the end of 2023 and beginning of this year, which led to excess inventory and a current downturn in the solar industry, particularly in Europe. Monday's news arrives just 6 months after the company said it would layoff about 16% of its global workforce, which was part of a plan to reduce operating costs at the time.\n\nSalesforce, July 15, 2024 announcement. Layoff of 300 people.\n\nAfter laying off 700 employees in January, Salesforce has reportedly cut 300 more roles amid an ongoing restructuring effort to streamline operations, according to Bloomberg. “Like any healthy business, we continuously assess whether we have the right structure in place to best serve our customers and fuel growth areas. In some cases that leads to roles being eliminated,” a Salesforce spokesperson told Bloomberg without detailing the number of layoffs.\n\nIntuit, July 10, 2024 announcement. Layoff of 1,800 people, 10% of workforce.\n\nIn an effort to sharpen its focus on products that utilize AI, Intuit is laying off 10% of its global workforce, or 1,800 employees, according to Bloomberg. As part of the move, the company is reportedly exchanging low performers and executives with news hires to achieve its goal, according to a memo sent to employees by CEO Sasan Goodarzi on Wednesday. Goodarzi plans to re-hire the same number of employees, which will primarily be in its engineering, product, and sales divisions. Intuit expects to accelerate its expansion in Canada, the UK, and Australia, and will also attempt to hire more fintech talent for its Credit Karma business. Though the restructuring is not a cost cutting move, offices in Edmonton, Canada and Boise, Idaho will reportedly be closed, while some tech roles will be consolidated to larger hubs.\n\nAccording to Goodarzi, over 1,000 of the employees being laid off “are not meeting expectations.” In addition, Intuit is reportedly reducing the number of executives by about 10% to increase its “velocity of decision making.” “The changes we are making today enable us to allocate additional investments to our most critical areas to support our customers and drive growth,” Goodarzi said in the memo to staff.\n\nCyberProof, July 10, 2024 announcement. Layoff of 7.5% of workforce.\n\nThe international cloud security solutions provider is laying off 7.5% of its global workforce, which could affect 20 out of its 85 Israeli employees, according to Calcalist. As a subsidiary of India's UST, CyberProof's cloud and IT infrastructure managers will reportedly be affected most, as those roles will be shifted to the company's offices in India, while cyber experts will not be affected. CyberProof operates offices and security operation centers in Israel, India, Spain, Singapore, and the US.\n\nUiPath, July 9, 2024 announcement. Layoff of 420 people, 10% of workforce.\n\nAs part of a major restructuring effort, UiPath is laying off 10% of its workforce, or 420 employees, according to CNBC. The cuts were announced in a filing with the SEC on Tuesday. The majority of the layoffs are set to be completed by the end of the first quarter of fiscal 2026, which ends next April. In addition, UiPath announced in May that CEO Rob Enslin was resigning effective June 1, and would be succeeded by co-founder Daniel Dines, who had stepped down as co-CEO in January, according to the report. “These changes reflect efforts to reshape the organization by streamlining the Company’s structure, particularly in operational and corporate functions, better prioritizing our go-to-market investments and focusing our research and development investments on artificial intelligence and driving innovation across our platform,” UiPath said in Tuesday’s statement.\n\nMicrosoft, July 3, 2024 announcement. Layoff total TBA.\n\nMicrosoft initiated another round of layoffs that affected several teams and geographies, though the company refused to provide a total headcount, according to GeekWire. However, impacted employees reportedly offered subtle insight to the units that were impacted via posts on LinkedIn, which suggest that employees in product and program management roles roles were let go. “Organizational and workforce adjustments are a necessary and regular part of managing our business,” a company spokesperson said in a statement obtained by GeekWire. “We will continue to prioritize and invest in strategic growth areas for our future and in support of our customers and partners.” Microsoft has parted with nearly 3,000 employees since January in various departments including its gaming and Azure cloud units and HoloLens mixed-reality organization.\n\nUKG, July 3, 2024 announcement. Layoff of 2,200 people, 14% of workforce.\n\nTo get ahead of rampant speculation, CEO Chris Todd announced mass layoffs in an email to employees on Wednesday that will impact 14% of UKG's workforce, according to the Boston Herald. News of the cuts that will affect nearly 2,200 UKG employees was reportedly set to arrive next week, though the plan is now in motion. “We are announcing a number of organizational changes that will allow us to aggressively focus on critical areas of growth and to provide flexibility to actively invest in important new areas,” Todd reportedly wrote in his email to staff. This is the second round of cuts in just over a year at the company, as it parted with 260 employees in March 2023.\n\nOpenText, July 3, 2024 announcement. Layoff of 1,200 people, 2% of workforce.\n\nAmid its “business optimization plan,” OpenText will be laying off 1,200 employees and adding 800 positions to support its “growth and innovation plans,” according to CRN. The company is looking to strategically align its workforce since filing with the US Securities and Exchange Commission on July 3 announcing the cuts, which will impact 2% of its employees. New roles will reportedly be added in sales, professional services, and engineering. OpenText's “Business Optimization Plan focuses on placing the right roles in global locations most appropriate for the business,” said a company spokesperson in an email to CRN.\n\nUnacademy, July 2, 2024 announcement. Layoff of 250 people.\n\nIn its latest round of layoffs, the Indian edtech company is laying off about 250 employees, according to TechCrunch. The move appears to be part of an ongoing restructuring effort at Unacademy in response to schools continuing to reopen after pandemic lockdowns. Since the second half of 2022, the company has laid off nearly 2,000 employees. According to the report, the cuts will impact 100 employees in marketing, business and product, and about 150 in sales, which will keep Unacademy on track toward its goal of reaching profitability.\n\nKoo, July 2, 2024 announcement. Layoff of entire workforce.\n\nOriginally designed to be a competitor of X, the Indian social media platform is winding down business operations after its acquisition negotiations with Dailyhunt stalled amid a last-ditch effort, according to TechCrunch. Koo experienced major hurdles as it attempted to expand its user base and generate revenue over the past two years, despite securing more than $60 million in funding from major investors, including Accel and Tiger Global. “Most of them didn’t want to deal with user generated content and the wild nature of a social media company,” Koo founders Aprameya Radhakrishna and Mayank Bidawatka wrote in a LinkedIn post. As an alternative to X, Koo reportedly planned to secure users in India by creating a compliant platform where they could express themselves in multiple local languages, while pledging to adhere to local regulations. The company's usage surged during a period when X (known as Twitter at the time) challenged the Indian government's blurred requests for content removal. The total number of impacted employees has yet to be confirmed.\n\nLightricks, July 1, 2024 announcement. Layoff of 70 people, 12% of workforce\n\nLightricks is laying off 70 employees that will primarily affect its consumer applications (B2C) division, as it shifts its focus to generative AI (GenAI) products for enterprises, according to Calcalist. The restructuring effort will account for 12% of its workforce, which features 600 employees in the US, Israel, China, and the UK. However, in addition to these cuts, Lightricks is planning to recruit dozens of new AI experts, with an emphasis on hiring in Israel.\n\nJune 2024 Tech Layoffs\n\nRealPage, June 27, 2024 announcement. Layoff of 260 people, 4% of workforce.\n\nThe real estate technology company is laying off 4% of its workforce as it grapples with a major class-action lawsuit, though a spokesperson insisted that the restructuring is part of its plan to promote growth, according to Bisnow. The cuts will impact at least 260 employees.\n\nPlanet, June 26, 2024 announcement. Layoff of 180 people, 17% of workforce.\n\nIn an effort to reduce operating costs, the earth observation company is laying off about 180 employees, or 17% of its workforce, according to SpaceNews. “This action was taken consistent with the Company’s ongoing focus on aligning the Company’s resources to the market opportunity, improving operational efficiency, and supporting the long-term growth and profitability of the business,” Planet stated in a filing with the US Securities and Exchange Commission announcing the cuts. The company has yet to confirm any details regarding the layoffs, including the affected roles or locations. This is Planet's second round of mass layoffs in less than a year, as it laid off 117 employees in July 2023, which accounted for 10% of its workforce at the time.\n\nMoxion Power, June 26, 2024 announcement. Layoff of 101 people.\n\nThe California-based battery manufacturer Moxion Power announced it is laying off 101 employees in a WARN filing on Friday, according to SFGate. The news is reportedly surprising since the company has raised more than $110 million in funding and recently unveiled plans for a major expansion in its home city of Richmond. According to the filing, 34 battery associates will be laid off, in addition to several warehouse associates and corporate staffers, from human resources and recruiting to business development and engineering. All of the impacted employees work at Moxion Power’s headquarters at 1414 Harbour Way South in Richmond. The cuts are slated to begin on August 20. CEO Paul Huelskamp told SFGate in a statement Wednesday that the layoffs are meant to align the company’s workforce with “core business objectives and current growth forecasts.”\n\nGinkgo Bioworks, June 24, 2024 announcement. Layoff of 35% of workforce.\n\nIn an effort to combat revenue declines by cutting costs, the Boston life sciences firm said in a filing Monday with the US Securities and Exchange Commission it would layoff 35% of its workforce of about 1,200 employees, according to the Boston Globe. Though Ginkgo Bioworks has yet to confirm the total number of impacted employees, it appears that at least 400 employees will be laid off. The filing reportedly arrives just one week after the company initiated 158 layoffs. After its founding in 2008 by five scientists from MIT, Bill Gates and other luminaries invested in the firm, a synthetic biology foundry that tinkered with the genes in microorganisms to produce new proteins, scents, antibiotics, and cannabinoids.\n\nEmma Sleep, June 19, 2024 announcement. Layoff of 200 employees, 18% of workforce.\n\nThe German mattress manufacturing company laid off 200 employees, which will account for 18% of its global workforce, according to WirtschaftsWoche. CEO Dennis Schmoltzi confirmed the cuts in an interview with WirtschaftsWoche, attributing the restructuring to unstable e-commerce and residential sectors. “In view of these factors, we have adjusted our plans and are not planning for any growth for the year as a whole. As a result, we must also align our organizational structure with this strategy,” Schmoltzi said.\n\nWex, June 18, 2024 announcement.

After successfully piloting its new model in Late February with 100 Revel drivers, the company has since decided to hire 100 more. “The reason we ran this pilot in the first place was just increasing feedback from our driver pool, as well as in our recruitment efforts,” Haley Rubinson, vice president of corporate affairs at Revel, said in a statement to TechCrunch. “The leading reason people didn’t want to join Revel was the lack of flexibility. Now there really is the opportunity to serve more of the city’s for-hire vehicle population.”\n\nThe updated model will reportedly take effect after September 12, which gives the current drivers on Revel’s payroll the option of staying on with the company as independent contractors moving forward. According to TechCrunch, drivers can sign up to rent from Revel’s fleet of Teslas for $10 per hour, which includes auto liability insurance, vehicle cleaning and maintenance and a full day of battery charging.

At the time of the deal, its acquisition to Prudential was one of the largest in Seattle tech history, and the largest insurance tech exit in history, according to Financial Technology Partners.\n\nApril 2024 Tech Layoffs\n\nTesla, April 30, 2024 announcement. Layoff of 500 people.\n\nJust weeks after parting with 14,000 employees, or 10% of its global workforce, Tesla announced that it will layoff 500 more employees and several executives, according to The Information. The cuts will directly impact the majority its Supercharging team, including the departure of Rebecca Tinucci, Tesla’s senior director of EV charging, who oversaw the 500-person team. According to The Verge, Tinucci led the rollout of Tesla’s Supercharger network during her six-year tenure, which included efforts to get other companies to adopt to adopt the North American Charging Standard (NACS) developed by Tesla. In pursuit of taking over the EV charging space, Tesla announced that is was opening up its more reliable Supercharger stations and network to other automakers in November 2022. Ford, GM, Volkswagen Group, BMW, and several others were reportedly part of the roster set to adopt Tesla’s charging standard for their future EVs. However, that strategy appears to be taking a serious hit as a result of the layoffs.\n\nTesla's layoffs reportedly included Daniel Ho, a ten-year Tesla veteran who served as director of vehicle programs and new product initiatives, and as program manager for the Model S, 3, and Y vehicles. The team Ho led is also being cut as a result of the restructure. In addition these departures, most of the public policy team led by former head of policy and business development Rohan Patel (who left the company during the previous wave of layoffs) are also being let go, according to The Verge. In a post on X, CEO Elon Musk addressed the company's EV charging strategy, insisting that Tesla remains committed to EV charging, but installations would slow down as an immediate effect of the layoffs.\n\nGoogle, April 30, 2024 announcement. Layoff of total TBA.\n\nJust two weeks away from Google's I/O developer conference in May, the tech giant has laid off staff across key teams like Flutter, Dart, Python and others, according to reports hared on social media by the impacted employees viewed by TechCrunch. Though Google did confirm the cuts to TechCrunch, it did not specify the teams, roles, or how many employees were impacted as a result of the move. This is the second round of layoffs in April that were initiated, and neither announcement arrived with a specific total of impacted employees. On April 17, Reuters reported cuts at Google that were made in an effort to trim costs.\n\nPrioritizing investments that can enable Google to capitalize on future opportunities appears to be the crux of the moves. “To best position us for these opportunities, throughout the second half of 2023 and into 2024, a number of our teams made changes to become more efficient and work better, remove layers, and align their resources to their biggest product priorities. Through this, we’re simplifying our structures to give employees more opportunity to work on our most innovative and important advances and our biggest company priorities, while reducing bureaucracy and layers,” said Google spokesperson Alex García-Kummert.\n\nReorganizations are part of Google's normal business model, but the company did confirm that the layoffs were not company-wide. According to TechCrunch, some of the layoffs at Google seem to have been confirmed in a WARN notice filed on April 24. WARN, or the California Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act, requires employers with more than 100 employees to provide a 60-day notice in advance of layoffs. In the filing, Google reportedly said it was laying off a total of 50 employees across three locations in Sunnyvale. Stay tuned.\n\nGetir, April 29, 2024 announcement. Layoff of over 6,000 people.\n\nThe instant delivery company announced that it would shut down its operations the U.S., the U.K. and Europe to focus solely on its home market of Turkey, according to TechCrunch. Though Getir made aggressive expansion deals to acquire struggling competitors in a bid to position itself the market leader, the company is now pivoting from that strategy. The closures will reportedly impact nearly 6,000 employees across those markets, while only impacting 7% of Getir's revenues. While several official headcount details remain scarce, Getir did confirm 1,500 layoffs in the U.K. in an announcement shared with journalists. The layoffs will reportedly impact at least 1,100 employees in Germany, but that number could potentially settle closer to 1,800 cuts. In November 2023, Getir picked up 2,300 employees after it acquired FreshDirect in the U.S., but this number could also grow given Getir's activity in the U.S. prior to that acquisition. Stay tuned.\n\nOla, April 29, 2024 announcement. Layoff of 180 people, 10% of workforce.\n\nThe Indian ride-hailing startup announced layoffs that will impact 180 employees, or 10% of its workforce, according to TechCrunch. Ola also let go of CEO Hemant Bakshi, just four months after appointing him to the post in hopes to improve profitability. Earlier this month, Ola ended business operations in the U.K., Australia, and New Zealand. Significant investments in AI and technology reportedly drove the restructure decision. “In line with our vision to serve 1 Billion Indians, and our commitment to drive sustainable growth and enhance efficiency across the organization, we are undergoing a restructuring exercise aimed at improving profitability and preparing ourselves for the next phase of growth,” wrote Founder and Chairman Bhavish Aggarwal in an email to employees.\n\nFisker, April 29, 2024 announcement. Layoff total TBA.\n\nAfter laying off 15% of its workforce in February, the EV startup initiated another round of layoffs in an effort to save cash, one week after warning investors of pending cuts to avoid bankruptcy, according to TechCrunch. In an internal email viewed by TechCrunch, Founder and CEO Henrik Fisker told employees Monday morning that Fisker is “continuing to evaluate all viable options for our business, including a potential transaction, and we are committed to identifying potential buyers and pathways to infuse capital into the business.” Though the total layoff headcount remains unconfirmed, Fisker reportedly employed 1,135 people as of April 19. Last week, the company announced it hired a chief restructuring officer who is now in charge of approving Fisker's budget, which includes the decision-making process for any sale of the business.\n\nHealthify, April 27, 2024 announcement. Layoff of 150 people, 27% of workforce.\n\nThe Bengaluru-based healthtech startup laid off 150 employees, or 27% of its workforce amid a restructure effort according to Inc42. Healthify's cuts will mainly impact sales and product teams according to the report. “In the next three-four months, our India business will turn EBITDA profitable and this restructuring was an unfortunate but an important step in line with achieving this. We also have to make sure we have enough resource allocation for the global expansion,” said Co-Founder and CEO Tushar Vashist in a statement to Inc42.\n\nFreenome, April 24, 2024 announcement. Layoff of 20% of workforce.\n\nIn an effort to continue to build its early cancer detection platform, the private bio tech company is laying off 20% of its workforce across multiple functions, according to a public LinkedIn post from its corporate page. Freenome's move arrives amid a push towards optimizing its structure and resources, which includes the goal to advance the best portfolio of blood-based tests to meet the needs of patients. While a total headcount remains unconfirmed, Freenome's LinkedIn page claims between 501 and 1,000 employees.\n\nThe Good Glamm Group, April 18, 2024 announcement. Layoff of 150 people, 15% of workforce.\n\nThe content-to-commerce platform is laying off 150 employees, or 15% of its workforce to streamline operations, according to the Economic Times. “This strategic initiative marks the culmination of the company's final phase of team integration with a steadfast aim to be a profitable company in FY25,” the company said in a statement obtained by the Economic Times. In addition, the Mumbai-based firm elevated some of its senior executives. The Good Glamm Group appointed Manan Jain as group chief operating officer, Kartik Rao as group chief people officer and senior vice president of initiatives, and Ashish Jadhav as group head of product.\n\nGoogle, April 17, 2024 announcement. Layoff total unconfirmed.\n\nIn an ongoing effort to cut costs, the technology giant is laying off an unspecified number of employees according to Reuters. A Google spokesperson reportedly said the layoffs are not company-wide and that affected employees will be able to apply for internal roles, though a headcount including the impacted teams was not confirmed. “Throughout the second half of 2023 and into 2024, a number of our teams made changes to become more efficient and work better, remove layers and align their resources to their biggest product priorities,” the spokesperson added. According to Reuters, there will be a small percentage of the impacted roles relocated to hubs that Google is investing in, including India, Chicago, Atlanta and Dublin.\n\nWithin the restructure, several teams across Google's finance and real estate units have been impacted. Those departments reportedly include Google's Treasury, Business Services, and Revenue Cash Operations teams, according to Business Insider. In addition, Google's CFO, Ruth Porat, sent an email to staff saying the restructuring includes expanding growth to Bangalore, Mexico City, and Dublin, according to Business Insider.\n\nTake-Two, April 16, 2024 announcement. Layoff of 579 people, 5% of workforce.\n\nThe GTA 6 publisher is cancelling several projects in addition to laying off 579 employees, or 5% of its workforce according to IGN. The move arrives amid an effort to streamline its organizational structure despite claims from CEO Strauss Zelnick that Take-Two had “no plans” to initiate layoffs. Take-Two reportedly expects to incur between $160 and $200 million in total charges, with $120 million to $140 million related to title cancellations. While the company appeared to be gearing up for growth driven by its upcoming release of GTA 6 in 2025, those ambitions appear to be cooling off at this time. However, there is a silver lining to the announcement based on Take-Two's recent acquisition of Gearbox from the Embracer Group, which signals a forthcoming confirmation of a new Borderlands game in development.\n\nTesla, April 15, 2024 announcement. Layoff of 14,000 people, 10% of workforce.\n\nIn an effort to cut costs amid increasing competition and declining sales, the electric car company is laying off 14,000 employees, or 10% of its workforce according to The New York Times. “As we prepare the company for the next phase of growth, it is extremely important to look at every aspect of the company for cost reductions and increasing productivity,” wrote CEO Elon Musk in an email to employees, obtained by The New York Times. Senior Vice President, Drew Baglino, also announced his resignation after an 18-year tenure with Tesla in a shocking announcement via X. Tesla's plan to drastically reduce prices during 2023 did increase demand, though it reduced the profit made on each car sale.\n\nHowever, the strategy isn't as potent today since being introduced. Earlier this month, the EV giant reported a decline in sales that alarmed investors, as its 387,000 global deliveries in the first quarter was down 8.5% from the prior year. Surprisingly, this was the first time Tesla’s quarterly sales have fallen on a year over year basis since the start of the pandemic in 2020.\n\nTikTok, April 11, 2024 announcement. Layoff of over 250 people.\n\nThe short-form video hosting platform is laying off more 250 employees in Ireland according to The Journal. TikTok announced an Ireland-based restructure plan back in February that would be a “redesign of our Training and Quality team that will enable us to further enhance our quality assurance processes.” At the time, TikTok said that it would expect the majority of impacted employees to remain in the company, but that doesn't appear to be the case. The Journal has spoken to several impacted employees who have applied for other roles without success, with some citing “insensitive” means of communication regarding the cuts. The move will reportedly impact more than 250 but less than 300 employees according to The Journal.\n\nHinge Health, April 11, 2024 announcement. Layoff of 10% of workforce.\n\nThe virtual physical health company that offers a digital solution to treat chronic musculoskeletal (MSK) conditions is laying off 10% of its workforce, according to TechCrunch.

Layoff of 20% of workforce.\n\nThe stomach health startup is making a move to reduce costs and will layoff 20% of its workforce, according to Sifted. “We have over-expanded our team in a way that’s unsustainable until we have a larger member base,” wrote CEO and Co-Founder Jonathan Wolf in a LinkedIn post. Zoe's corporate LinkedIn page suggests that it has 201-500 current employees, which could mean at least 100 roles would be affected by the cuts. In addition to the cuts, Zoe is “stopping its London office search, will not enhance its US warehouse, and will significantly reduce contract costs,” Wolf added in his announcement.\n\nScaler, April 10, 2024 announcement. Layoff of 150 people.\n\nTo enable long-term growth and sustainability, the tech startup focused on upskilling college students and tech professionals is laying off 150 employees, according to Entrackr. “It is imperative that we look at how we operate for long-term growth and sustainability.

Founded in 2014, Checkr has reportedly raised $679 million in funding during that time. TechCrunch broke the initial restructure news by Checkr on Wednesday.\n\nApple, April 4, 2024 announcement. Layoff of 614 people.\n\nBack on February 27, we reported that the tech giant is ending its extensive, but secretive autonomous EV project that included hundreds of layoffs, according to Bloomberg. While the total count was unconfirmed at that time, we're now getting a fuller picture of the restructure move and its impact. Apple reportedly laid off more than 600 employees in California as part of the decisions to end its car and smartwatch display projects, according to filings with the California Employment Development Department. Bloomberg broke the story last night, which included smartwatch projects as new wrinkle in the restructure.\n\nIts EV project was canned because of indecision among executives about budgeting and overall direction, while the display project ended due to engineering, supplier and financial hurdles. 371 employees were reportedly released at Apple’s main car-related office in Santa Clara, California, which included dozens more at several satellite offices. However, an Apple spokeswoman declined to comment on the number of employees affected by the job cuts.\n\nLightspeed Commerce, April 3, 2024 announcement. Layoff of 280 people, 10% of workforce.\n\nThe Montreal-based technology company is laying off 280 employees, or 10% of its workforce, while founder Dax Dasilva returns as CEO according to BNN Bloomberg.

In addition, its physical stores technology teams will be impacted by the move. According to the report, Amazon said it’s shifting its focus to self-serve digital training and training programs run by external partners. “The changes we are making are preparing the organization for the future, aligning with our strategy and priorities, and reducing duplication and inefficiency,” wrote SVP Matt Garman in a statement obtained by GeekWire. While the cuts will impact global operations, the heaviest concentration of AWS roles reside in Amazon’s hometown, which means that the decision is likely to have a disproportionate impact on the company’s Seattle workforce.\n\nGhost Autonomy, April 3, 2024 announcement.

Layoff of 500 people, 3% of workforce.\n\nThe edtech giant is restructuring its business amid funding struggles and laying off 500 employees, or 3% of its workforce according to the Business Standard. Byju's is reportedly battling investors and lenders, and is also experiencing a markdown in its valuation. The cuts will impact sales, marketing, and teaching roles at the company, though the overall restructuring of Byju's started last year to let go of about 4,500 employees.

As a result, the EV startup is actively sourcing ways to raise money as it transitions from direct sales to a dealership model.
