Lucian Michael Freud, a prominent British painter and portraitist, was born in Berlin in 1922. His artistic talent was inherited from his father Ernst L. Freud, a Jewish architect, and his grandfather Sigmund Freud. Lucian specialized in figurative art that focused on portraiture and painting throughout his career.

He developed a highly individualistic painting style characterized by impasto – the thick application of paint onto the canvas – that showcased his masterful use of color and texture. In 1933, as Nazism rose to power in Germany, he fled with his family to England where he later became a British citizen.

Lucian is known for creating portraits that were intensely intimate and personal while simultaneously conveying psychological depths through unique expressions and poses. He often chose family members, friends, colleagues, acquaintances or even himself as subjects in his paintings.

As one of the major figurative painters of the 20th century, Lucian’s confrontational style has gained widespread recognition within art circles worldwide. Despite passing away in 2011 at age 88 , he left behind an incredible body of work that continues to influence modern-day artists today.
