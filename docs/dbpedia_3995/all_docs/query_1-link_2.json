        "text": "Lucian Freud (born December 8, 1922, Berlin, Germany—died July 20, 2011, London, England) was a British artist known for his work in portraiture and the nude. Sometimes called a realist, he painted in a highly individual style, which in his later years was characterized by impasto.\n\nThe son of the architect Ernst Freud and a grandson of Sigmund Freud, he immigrated with his family to England in 1933, becoming a naturalized citizen in 1939. He was trained at the Central School of Art in London, where he was as much known for his unconventional behaviour as for his drawing talent, and at the East Anglian School of Painting and Drawing in Dedham. Freud turned to painting full-time after World War II. His Interior at Paddington (1951) exhibits many of his lifelong concerns—the human figure rendered in a realist manner and imbued with a stark and evocative psychological intensity. Freud’s many portraits of his friends and associates and of members of the British gentry extended a grand English tradition. His series of paintings and drawings of his mother, begun in 1970 and continuing until the day after her death in 1989, are particularly frank and dramatic studies of intimate life passages.\n\nBritannica Quiz\n\nWho Painted the Most Expensive Paintings in the World?"
