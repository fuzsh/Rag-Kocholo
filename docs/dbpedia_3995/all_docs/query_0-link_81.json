        "text": "With any portrait there is an unstated trade-off, whereby the sitters offer themselves up to be immortalised but on terms strictly controlled by the artist (taken to extremes in Picasso’s portrait of Gertrude Stein, in which he gave her the features of an Iberian mask – now become more familiar than her real face). Freud’s dispassionate observation of the human form, regarding it as no different in kind from a vase of buttercups or a kitchen sink, takes this Faustian pact to extremes. This is particularly noticeable in his minuscule portrait of the Queen (2000–01). The banknote curlicues of her hairdo and the crown that seems to hover above them mean that the subject is instantly identifiable, if not recognisable: the face, however, is that of a pugilist, puffy and with a hint of five o’clock shadow. As with his portrait of a pregnant Kate Moss (2002), her head resembling a deflated rugby ball, it feels as if Freud made a misstep in taking for his subject a woman whose features were so instantly familiar, so endlessly photographed, that the stubborn refusal to produce anything approaching a likeness is more marked than ever. By contrast, the performance artist Leigh Bowery, whose features were habitually mediated by layers of face paint, proved an ideal sitter: flopping about on a daybed in Schiele-like contortions, he was unrecognisable from his public persona, willing and ready to be rendered by Freud as a series of flesh-toned rockeries. His presence lent the artist’s work a Cool Britannia cachet without distracting the viewer with concerns about whether or not the representation was true to life."
