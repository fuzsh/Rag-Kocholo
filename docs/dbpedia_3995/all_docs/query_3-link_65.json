        "text": "The Freud Museum‘s latest offering is an exhibition marking 100 years since the birth of artist Lucian Freud. In Sigmund Freud’s London home connections between grandson and grandfather are under the spotlight as family photos of the Freud family take centre stage in ‘Lucian Freud: The Painter and his Family’.\n\nThe small exhibition focuses on Lucian Freud’s childhood and his family relationships with rarely seen works, many from private collections.\n\nCurator and art critic for the Spectator, Martin Gayford has picked up on adolescent Lucian’s love of reading and horses by displaying books from the artist’s personal collection alongside ‘Three Legged Horse (1937), his sole surviving sculpture.\n\nThere is a poignancy to positioning a number of artworks in grandfather, Sigmund Freud’s study. Above his famous psychoanalytical couch sits a portrait of Lucian’s mother and a painting of Egyptian history books mirror books found in Sigmund’s own library.\n\nYou can’t help but compare the lens of scrutiny that both Freuds possessed, one for the inner workings of the mind and the other for the unflinching observations of the outer shell.\n\nI certainly got more of an insight into family life at the press view by listening to Lucian’s son, Alex Boyt, being interviewed. A portrait of Alex sits on the far wall of the exhibition, contextualised by Boyt in a family-focussed exhibition by emphasising Lucian “wasn’t a family man” and “painting was his priority”.\n\nHe quoted a comment that Deborah Mitford, a long time friend to his father whom he painted in 1956/7 – “Before your father was famous for being a painter, he was famous for being a man…”.\n\nRead into that what you will…\n\nFrom childhood drawings to book illustrations and family photos the exhibition offers a wider sense of Lucian as a young creative soul destined to become one of the 20th century’s most famous painters.\n\nThere is something about the setting of this exhibition in a family home that lends itself to a more intimate experience, certainly more affecting that if it was experienced in a neutral gallery space.\n\nIt is an intriguing last exhibition for Freud Museum director, Carol Seigel, as she retires after 13 years in charge. I look forward to the next steps with new director, Giuseppe Albano, as the remarkable Freud family continue to intrigue visitors when they visit this atmospheric suburban family home.\n\nxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx"
