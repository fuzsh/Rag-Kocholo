        "text": "Investigating the Authenticity and Attribution of Paintings and Drawings believed to be by or attributed to;\n\nLéon de Smet\n\n1881-1966\n\nBelgian Impressionist & Modern painter.\n\nLéon de Smet was born in Ghent into a family of artists. Known for his decorative florals, figures and landscapes.\n\nEasily emulated and faked, there must be many works misattributed, either mistakenly or deliberately to Léon de Smet's hand and with the inclusion of an initialled monogram which he did use, or a copied signature placed on a work of a similar type or subject, one applied to a previously unsigned work, perhaps where the original signature has been deleted. It is no wonder that question marks can and do often arise.\n\nWe are international fine art consultants, specializing in conducting full investigations into the authenticity of works of art created by artists in all categories, from all regions and historical eras, alongside scrutinizing their provenance.\n\nConfidentially serving both private individuals and corporate clients from around the world for over 45 years, we can assist and advise you in all fine art related matters, particularly issues of authenticity, legitimacy and the attribution of old and modern master works of art. Including the works of Leon de Smet, his circle, or any paintings or works of art that you are unsure about.\n\nSome examples of de Smet's works and those signed with that name, appear below.\n\nThough both the duration and direction of any attribution or authenticity investigation will naturally vary from project to project, there are well defined responsibilities, areas of scrutiny and professional formalities that we can assist you with including:\n\nAuthentication: Conducting and directing comprehensive investigations and in depth research, with a view to establishing a correct, full and formally recognised certification of a work of art. One absolutely upheld by the appropriate, legally acknowledged and internationally sanctioned authority, body or expert on that given artist.\n\nDirecting detailed and complicated inquiries with multilingual, international academic research and any forensic applications.\n\nAttribution: Identifying and confirming the identity of a previously anonymous artist, studio or workshop from which a work of art most likely originated. Including the re-examination and investigation of a previous attribution which may be incorrect, or the scrutiny of an attribution that has been formally questioned or doubted.\n\nConfirmation: Undertaking research and investigations into the legitimacy of the provenance, history and prior ownership of a work of art and establishing its own accuracy.\n\nScrutiny: Identifying fake works of art and forgeries, including any false supportive accompanying documentation and determining works of art which may be studio or later copies, or previous incorrect attributions.\n\nProsecution: Investigating alleged art fraud and forgery and assisting and advising those who are , or may be considering litigating or prosecuting the fact. This includes legal professionals and private clients.\n\nAttention: Conducting all fine art related due diligence and duty of care inquiries. Including safe prepurchase or sale related audits and assisting clients in consolidating a well balanced future family distribution.\n\nAppraisal: Valuations, quality and condition reports.\n\nStep one in the Art Authentication and Attribution process.\n\nThe Pre-Authentication Assessment\n\nBefore you begin any art authenticity, legitimacy, or any artist attribution investigation, it is more than wise to have an impartial preliminary assessment of the viability of the project conducted first. One made to independently and rationally balance any negative issues there may be against the positive elements. Treat it as your safety net.\n\nWe will be happy to professionally undertake that study for you as a primary safety net, based upon good quality images that you supply and all the known facts regarding its acquisition, the history and provenance of the work as is known to you.\n\nYou will then have a far better understanding of the prospects and pitfalls that could lie ahead.\n\nSee our FAQ's for details of the process\n\nCONTACT US\n\nWe will respond to you promptly.\n\nAvant d'entreprendre une enquête sur l'authenticité d'une œuvre d'art ou l'attribution d'un artiste, il est plus que prudent de procéder à une évaluation impartiale de sa faisabilité. Ceci est fait pour équilibrer indépendamment tous les problèmes négatifs qui peuvent exister contre le positif.\n\nNous serons heureux d'entreprendre cette étude d'une manière professionnelle pour vous que nous considérons comme votre principal filet de sécurité.\n\nIl sera basé sur les images que vous fournissez et tous les faits connus concernant votre acquisition, son passé et la provenance de l'œuvre telle que vous la connaissez. Vous aurez alors une meilleure compréhension des perspectives et des difficultés éventuelles à venir, avant de prendre une décision.\n\nAntes de embarcarse en cualquier investigación de autenticidad artística o atribución de artista, es más que prudente realizar primero una evaluación imparcial de su viabilidad. Esto se hace para equilibrar independientemente cualquier problema negativo que pueda haber contra el positivo.\n\nNos complace emprender profesionalmente ese estudio para usted, que consideramos su red de seguridad. Se basará en las imágenes que usted suministre y todos los hechos conocidos con respecto a su adquisición, historia pasada y procedencia del trabajo tal como lo conoce.\n\nEntonces tendrá una mejor comprensión.\n\nABOUT PAINTING DESCRIPTORS AND TERMINOLOGY\n\nIt is important to understand the auction terms used in any published descriptor and to be cautious of works that may just be painted in the style or manner of the artist, or even stylized would be copies of his works which happen to bear a signature or monogram.\n\nIn this case Léon de Smet.\n\nIf Léon de Smet, is given with the first name/s and surname of the artist, then in their opinion it is the genuine and authentic item, one painted by the artist himself.\n\nBut if Leon de Smet; is described as “Attributed to Leon de Smet….” Then in their opinion it is 'probably' a work by the artist, at least in part. But no guarantee. It's only an opinion.\n\nLeon de Smet; “Studio of ….” or “Workshop of” or \"attelier\" Means in their opinion it is a work executed in the studio of the artist. Possibly by an apprentice or a pupil under the principal artists supervision.\n\nBut if the term Leon de Smet, or “Circle of Leon de Smet ” is used, then in their opinion, it is a work of the period of the artist and showing his influence, or closely associated with the artist BUT not necessarily by his pupil or student.\n\nLeon de Smet; Painted in the “Style of ….” or “Follower of Leon de Smet” Means that in their opinion it is a work of art executed only in the artist’s style, but not necessarily by a pupil. But it may be contemporary, or nearly contemporary.\n\nLeon de Smet ;in the “Manner of, is used….” In their opinion it's a work painted in the style of the artist but of a later date and definitely not by the artist.\n\nLeon de Smet; “After, then ….” In their opinion it is a copy (made at any date) of an authentic and original work by the artist.\n\nLeon de Smet; “Signed…”, “Dated….” or “Inscribed” In their opinion the work has been signed/dated/or inscribed by that specific artist. The addition of a question mark however, indicates an element of doubt.\n\nThe term Leon de Smet is followed by the words; \"With signature ….”, or “With date ….” or “With inscription….” or “Bears the signature Leon de Smet /date/inscription” Then in their opinion, the signature / date / or inscription is spurious, forged or has been added by someone else other than the artist.\n\nWe can assist and advise you in all fine art related matters."
