        "text": "The 11th Duke of Beaufort, who has died aged 89, was a landowner, a dashing sportsman, a connoisseur and a glamorous figure on the London art scene.\n\nTall, elegant and always impeccably dressed (he was described by his friend, the politician and journalist Woodrow Wyatt, as “the great woman slayer”) he inherited his family’s traditional love of the countryside and their equestrian interests. But he made his career – and a considerable additional fortune – in the art world, becoming chairman of the Marlborough Fine Art Gallery, in Albemarle Street, Mayfair.\n\nFounded in 1946, Marlborough Fine Art is one of the world’s leading galleries of contemporary art. David Somerset, as he then was, began working at the gallery in 1950, aged 22, and became chairman in 1977, seeing the company through some of its most successful years and the staging of exhibitions by such artists as Frank Auerbach, Lucian Freud, Barbara Hepworth and R B Kitaj, among many others.\n\nThe dukedom of Beaufort is one of the most important in Britain. Sons descended from John of Gaunt and Katherine Swynford, born out of wedlock but later legitimised by the Pope, were given the surname of Beaufort; but it was the Beauforts’ devotion to the monarchy that earned them their titles.\n\nDuring the Civil War, Henry Beaufort (then 5th Earl of Worcester) supported Charles I financially with support of more than £1 million pounds and held Raglan Castle against the Parliamentarians for nearly four years, surrendering only when it had been reduced to ruin.\n\nAfter the Restoration, Charles II created the Beaufort dukedom in 1682. It was the 1st Duke who built Badminton, Gloucestershire, a large Palladian house with 40 bedrooms, and one of the great country houses of England.\n\nLater generations of the family turned their backs on politics, contenting themselves with their horses and hounds on their 52,000-acre Badminton estate. The green-coated Beaufort is now one of the few remaining private packs, though it is mostly financed by subscription.\n\nDavid Somerset’s cousin, the 10th Duke, known as “Master”, was the doyen of the equestrian world and a legendary figure in the hunting field. A Knight of the Garter, he was Master of the Horse to the Queen as well as Master of the Beaufort Hunt. He also founded the Badminton Horse Trials, an event which now attracts as many spectators as the Derby.\n\nDavid Somerset became heir to the dukedom in 1965 on the death of his father in a yachting accident off the island of Rhodes. He succeeded to the title in 1984 on the death of the 10th Duke.\n\nAs a young man, David had been taken under Master’s wing. In 1950, at St Peter’s, Eaton Square, in the presence of many members of the Royal family, he married Lady Caroline Thynne, daughter of the 6th Marquess of Bath. For some years they lived with the childless 10th Duke and his Duchess at Badminton. Master and his heir were united by a strong mutual respect and fondness and by a love of Badminton and of the countryside.\n\nAn accomplished horseman, in 1959 David Somerset rode Countryman into second place in the Horse Trials at Badminton, but later limited his riding to hunting.\n\nHe was also something of an international figure, flying his own aeroplane (which he would land on an airstrip built on the edge of the family estate) and mixing in the raffish set of Lord Lambton and Gianni Agnelli, with whom he shared a love of beautiful women and gossip.\n\nAs their young family grew, the Somersets moved into “The Cottage”, a misleadingly named house nearby. An unlikely neighbour was James Lees-Milne, the writer and expert on country houses, with his wife, Alvilde. They lived at Essex House, soon nicknamed “Bisex House”.\n\nThe 10th Duke could not understand him at all: “Doesn’t hunt, doesn’t shoot, what does he do?” But Lees-Milne appealed to David and Caroline Somerset and the couple make frequent appearances in his waspish diaries of the period.\n\n“One can talk about anything with David,” he records; he was “an intelligent as well as an amusing man”, “a fascinating subject for study”, “so wise when he talks seriously, always funny in that deadpan manner” and “ruthless yet charming”. Caroline, meanwhile, had “the sweetness of a wild deer”.\n\nWhen the new Beauforts moved into Badminton in 1984, the house was much in need of repair, and over the succeeding years the new Duke and Duchess presided over its restoration with great good humour, with the Duchess personally taking parties of visitors on spirited tours of the rooms. For three years, Master’s widow still lived on in the house, an unaccountable presence suffering from dementia.\n\nThe new Duke took his place as Master of the Beaufort, and at the next meet after the 10th Duke’s death, there occurred one of the best runs in years, causing the Duchess to exclaim: “Master has inhabited the fox!”\n\nLess than a year later, he had to live through a macabre ordeal when members of the “Hunt Retribution Squad”, an extreme anti-hunting group, attempted to dig up the grave of the 10th Duke on the Badminton estate. They had intended to deliver the head to Princess Anne. Following this incident a substantial tomb was placed over Master’s grave.\n\nHandsome and athletic into old age, he was as charming to his tenants and his staff at Badminton as he was to his smart friends and acquaintances. As he became less socially and physically active, he derived great pleasure from the presence at Badminton of his children and grandchildren.\n\nCaroline Beaufort died in 1995. In 2000 he married Miranda Morley, daughter of Brigadier-General Michael Morley. A talented gardener and horsewoman, she supported him valiantly both in his work at Badminton and in his declining years.\n\nIn 1988 David Beaufort was nominated to the International Best Dressed List Hall of Fame.\n\nThe Duke of Beaufort also held the titles of Marquess of Worcester (1642), Earl of Worcester (1514) and Baron Herbert of Raglan, Chepstow, and Gower (1506).\n\nHe is survived by his wife and three sons and a daughter (the historian, Anne Somerset) from his first marriage. The eldest son, Henry (often known as “Bunter”), Marquess of Worcester, who was born in 1952, inherits the Beaufort titles and the estate."
