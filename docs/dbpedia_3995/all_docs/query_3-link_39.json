        "text": "Realist painter Lucian Freud, one of Britain's most distinguished and highly regarded artists, has died aged 88.\n\nNew York dealer William Acquavella said Freud had died at his London home on Wednesday after an unspecified illness.\n\nFreud, a grandson of the psycho-analyst Sigmund Freud, was born in Berlin in 1922 and fled to Britain with his Jewish family in 1933, when he was 10.\n\nFreud - particularly known for his paintings of nudes - became a British citizen in 1939.\n\nMr Acquavella described Freud \"as one of the great painters of the 20th Century\".\n\n\"In company he was exciting, humble, warm and witty. He lived to paint and painted until the day he died, far removed from the noise of the art world.\"\n\nNicholas Serota, director of the Tate gallery, said: \"The vitality of [Freud's] nudes, the intensity of the still life paintings and the presence of his portraits of family and friends guarantee Lucian Freud a unique place in the pantheon of late 20th Century art.\n\n\"His early paintings redefined British art and his later works stand comparison with the great figurative painters of any period.\"\n\nFormer Observer art critic William Feaver, who knew Freud for more than 40 years, said Freud was someone who had \"restored portraiture to its proper place\", by focusing on all types of people, not just successful businessmen and their wives.\n\n\"He said everything he did was autobiographical and a self portrait. He was a witty, impulsive artist but generous with it.\"\n\nMr Feaver said Freud had left several unfinished paintings.\n\nHe said: \"He always liked to keep a couple of paintings on the go in case he dropped off the twig and I know he's done that.\"\n\nFormer muse Sue Tilley, who sat for the nude Benefits Supervisor Sleeping, said she had \"fantastic experiences\" while posing for the portrait.\n\n\"I found out last night on Twitter, bizarrely, and I did start crying,\" she told BBC Breakfast.\n\n\"I haven't seen him for a long time and he's not really a close friend now but it's a part of my life that's kind of gone.\""
