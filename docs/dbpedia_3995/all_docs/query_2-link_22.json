        "text": "For an art student, can there be any greater shadow to live under than that of arguably the nation’s greatest living artist? Lucy Freud, daughter of Lucian Freud, knows the answer all too well. Today, however, sitting in the canteen of Wimbledon Art College, where she has spent the afternoon hanging her degree show, she is entirely unfazed by her surname and all its connotations, perhaps because for most of her life, she has not used it.\n\nLike many lesser-known members of the Freud dynasty, Lucy, 49, and her three siblings, Jane, Paul and David, were once dubbed the “forgotten Freuds”, under the radar and not feted publicly as Freud’s children, unlike their well-known (half) siblings, the fashion designer Bella and novelist Esther.\n\nFreud’s legacy as an artist is matched by his notorious reputation as a Lothario, a reputation that Lucy’s mother, the artist Katherine McAdam, took many years to uncover.\n\n“Apparently he used to go there [St Martins] to look for students he fancied, so the story goes,” says Lucy, rolling her eyes. “Mum had been a babysitter for Lucian’s children with Kitty [Garman, daughter of the sculptor Jacob Epstein, who Freud married in 1948 and divorced in 1952 and with whom he had two daughters, Annie and Annabel].”\n\nLater, while Freud and McAdam were still seeing each other, Lucy describes her mother as being “quite annoyed” when she opened the morning paper one day and discovered that the artist was engaged to someone else.\n\nFreud’s subsequent marriage to the socialite and novelist Lady Caroline Blackwood, in 1953, ended five years later, whereupon he took up again with McAdam.\n\nThey had four children together, but Lucy tells me Freud was more often than not absent from their home in Paddington, and unbeknown to McAdam, entangled with several other women.\n\n“She was very naive, she’d been to a convent school until she was 18, but she was livid when she discovered there were other women and children, and again only found out when she read it in the papers.”\n\nIt was years later that Lucy discovered just how far her father’s network of “other children” extended, as McAdam had protected her young children from the truth of Freud’s infidelities. Together with his two children by Garman and four by McAdam, he has Bella and Esther, his daughters by the writer and gardener Bernardine Coverley, four children, Ali, Rose, Isobel and Susie, from another mistress Suzy Boyt, his former pupil at the Slade School of Fine Art, and a son, Frank, with the painter Celia Paul.\n\n“There are 13 children that we know of,” says Lucy. “And three of those – myself, Bella and Ibby [Isobel] – were all born in 1961.\n\n“It was Mum that he wanted the relationship with. He only ever came to see her, not us. He wasn’t really a father.”\n\nOne day, when Lucy was five, McAdam had finally had enough of sharing Freud with a string of mistresses. “We were at Saturday morning pictures, and there was an announcement saying ‘could Jane, Paul and Lucy come to the front’, and there was Mum with baby David in a van with all of our things.”\n\nWithout telling Freud, or their children, of her plans, McAdam upped sticks and moved the family to a council estate in Roehampton. Lucy and her siblings never saw Freud again as children.\n\n“I think he was livid when he turned up at Paddington and Mum wasn’t there, but then again, he never tried to find us,” says Lucy, the first note of sadness creeping into her voice. “She wanted to get away from him because she didn’t want any more children. Being a single mum wasn’t really done in the Sixties, so we were looked upon as a very odd family. Everyone on the estate said we spoke like the Queen,” adds Lucy, who these days has a trace of cockney in her voice.\n\nAfter this, Lucy’s mother rarely spoke of Freud, though his art books were occasionally to be found around the house. “She might point to a book and say ‘that was your father’, and I’d say ‘where is he, then?’ And she’d say ‘he’s at work’. She wasn’t a conversationalist. I remember being out in the park sitting on a bench and looking at men walking by, saying ‘could he be my Dad?’”\n\nOne day, in her late teens, the A-level art student was at a party. A friend had just introduced her to someone, adding that her father was “quite a famous artist, Lucian Freud”.\n\n“[This guy] said, ‘I met one of your sisters the other day, about the same age as you.’ That was my first realisation that I might have other siblings. But because it was painful for Mum, we didn’t ask any more questions.”\n\nSeveral years later, Lucy’s brother David attended a fund-raising event, where he was introduced to someone called “Emma Freud” [their cousin]. “He told her he thought he might be related to her,” says Lucy. “And she said: ‘Oh, you must be one of Lucian’s then.’”\n\nFacilitated by Emma, Lucy and her brothers soon met Esther, Bella and the Boyts. “Their mothers had kept in contact with Lucian, so they did OK financially. If they needed anything he’d sort them out,” Lucy says. “Whereas Mum never asked for anything.”\n\nHaving last seen her father as a five-year-old, Lucy, in her early twenties, with lines of communication opened through Esther, met him once again, over lunch.\n\n“We each had lunch with him individually,” says Lucy. “I think his intention was to see Mum again, but she wasn’t having any of it. I remember thinking I wouldn’t know what to say – that I’d rather have watched like a fly on the wall than have actually been there.\n\n“I was nervous and excited, it was all a bit surreal. He seemed quite friendly and warm and I thought, great, this might be the start of a relationship, but it wasn’t.”\n\nLucy recalls that “a bit of communication” followed in the form of the occasional postcard, but “soon filtered into nothing”. They have not met since. “I do go and see his work when it’s on. It’s a bit sad because it would be lovely to have a relationship with him, especially as he’s getting older. But the ball’s totally in his court.”\n\nDespite Freud’s woeful performance as a father, Lucy never appears angry or bitter, and I wonder whether she actually minds all that much that her half-sisters enjoy a closer relationship with Freud, now 88, who has painted them on several occasions? “Yes,” she says emphatically. “It would have been nice to have known your father. Everyone else had one, but I didn’t.\n\n“If there’s a function, I still invite him. I invited him to my wedding because I thought, he’s a father, even though he wasn’t a Dad, and it would be nice if he made the effort. I just wanted him to know that I was getting married. Not that I ever thought he would come.” Freud neither came nor responded to the invitation, and has never met his grandsons, Peter, 25, and James, 23.\n\nLucy, who got married young, aged 22 –something she attributes to her yearning to “have a family, be a proper family” – was divorced from Peter Everett, a plumber, several years ago. The couple remain on good terms and live close to each other in Chessington, Surrey, where Lucy paints in the studio at the end of her garden.\n\nAlways a gifted artist, winning competitions from age 10, Lucy felt sure she would follow in her absent father’s footsteps until it actually came to enrolling in art school, when she dithered.\n\n“I dropped out of doing a foundation course twice when I was younger,” she admits. “I think I just wasn’t ready to embrace it all then.” But she kept her hand in with sketching and life-drawing classes, and after marriage and children, enrolled on the two-year foundation course at Wimbledon, which she followed up with the six-year degree course from which she is graduating this month.\n\nLucy applied, and was accepted to, Wimbledon under her married name of Everett, unwilling to let on that her father’s paintings were hung in the world’s most prestigious galleries, and sold for millions, lest fellow students and tutors assume that she had sailed into art school on his coat tails. When lecturers wrongly spelt “Lucien” in their notes, she bit her tongue.\n\nIt was during her foundation course that two things happened which led to Lucy’s epiphany moment – changing her name to Freud. The first was when her son James told a friend’s mother, also an artist, that his grandfather was Lucian Freud. “She told him, ‘Oh, no, he isn’t, I know and read everything about Lucian Freud and I’ve never heard of your lot’,” recalls Lucy.\n\n“I thought that’s so awful, nothing’s ever been written about us, so nobody ever knew about us and we were all kind of in denial about it too. I didn’t want the children to have their heritage denied.”\n\nThen the foundation course students were set a project about “identity”. “I started thinking about acknowledging my real identity and having to deal with it,” says Lucy, who shares the same piercing, almond-shaped blue/green eyes as her father.\n\n“But I was very worried about being judged in comparison to him. Then I thought, well Lucian always had that – Sigmund was his grandfather – and he’s had to live with that. So on two big sheets of perspex, I painted Sigmund at the back, then his son Ernst, my grandfather, Lucian in front, my mum in front of him, then me, almost as a silhouette, at the front.\n\n“I turned the lights out, and lit it from behind. Then we had a crit, where I told the group about this being a hard journey to take, connecting with this side of myself I had been not acknowledging. I told them ‘Sigmund’s my great grandfather, Lucian is my father, and I wanted to share that with you.’ The lights came on and my tutor said ‘Any questions?’ I looked around and people’s jaws were on the floor.”\n\nAfter “coming out” as Lucian’s daughter, though still married, Lucy changed her name by deed poll to Freud. A few years later, in 2008, she embarked on another cathartic project – a commission by the Royal Academy to paint a portrait of her father, from a photograph, of course. The result, Father, 2008, is a touching and remarkable likeness of her father, trademark scarf draped around his neck, the brushwork bearing a striking similarity to her father’s.\n\n“I did send him the pamphlet with his portrait, but I didn’t get any response,” says Lucy. “When I did that portrait of him, quite a few people said, ‘Oh, you really paint in a similar style to him’, and I thought, ‘Oh, no’. I paint easily in that style, but am I doing that because I know it’s his style?”\n\nThough Lucy describes her father’s talent as “amazing”, to avoid comparisons and paint “more freely and expressively”, she has since moved away from portraits and figurative painting, towards more abstract work. Monoprints, installation and performance art also feature in her portfolio.\n\nNeedless to say, galleries have been snapping at her heels to sign the latest Freud to emerge from the clan. I wonder if it is a help or a hindrance sharing a name with our greatest living artist? “It’s both,” she says, aware that the Freud name can open doors in the art world; her sister, a sculptress, goes by the name of Jane McAdam Freud.\n\n“It’s a hindrance in the fact that you’re never going to know if someone really likes your work, or they just think they do because of the name. But it is what I am and I can’t help that.”"
