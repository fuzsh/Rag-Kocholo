        "text": "Annie Freud lives on a smallholding in Dorset with a dog, sheep, chickens and her second husband Dave, a retired electrical engineer she met on the internet, who took her on a first date to Hackney City Farm in east London.\n\nThe author of three collections of poetry, the first published in 2007 and the newest, The Remains, this month, Freud’s is a story of literary achievement late in life, after some false starts, disappointments and two previous careers – one as an embroiderer and another in local government. Last year she was by far the oldest of the latest batch of Next Generation Poets, selected from writers who have published their debut collection in the previous 10 years.\n\n“Sometimes I beat myself up, and say, ‘Why didn’t you start earlier?’” she tells me over a glass of prosecco she hopes will help her relax for her first big newspaper books interview. “But it took me a long, long time to think of myself as somebody who could make work other people might look at. I’m one of those people who used to write a flurry of poems if I had a breakup, or lost a job or was really sad about something. Partly to do with the family I come from, I’ve tried to make art of some sort my whole life.”\n\nFreud’s poems are autobiographical, full of pleasing sounds and unusual words (lingams, yonis, cabazeo), food, artistic references, glamorous places and French phrases (“Les Sauces, Le Ballet, Les Actrices”, dedicated to her daughter May, is a list of French words that belong in the three categories of sauces, ballet and actresses – from béchamel to Binoche).\n\nOften witty and light-hearted, sometimes worried and sad, Freud’s poems are highly evocative of the complicated life she has led. The new book, which includes her own colour illustrations of landscapes, plants and fish, was inspired in part by objects dug up in her garden, but also reflects on recent bereavements: starting in May 2010 Freud lost her stepfather, mother and father within 16 months.\n\nShe says she has relished her emergence on the poetry scene. “It was almost, just slightly, like being the Beatles,” she says, “because people really liked my work. I got invited to do gigs and festivals and things like that.” Three books in, she tries out new forms confidently and finds it an “absolute thrill” to overcome difficulties. “When you suddenly get a chance to rhyme, and rhyme well, it’s like being able to skate or jive,” she says, before breaking off to quote a snatch of “The Ballad of Hunnington Herbert”, which rhymes “Kensington Gore” with “the late Charles Clore”.\n\nHer favourite poem in the new book, “The Room That Isn’t There”, is “a villanelle-ish kind of poem – repetitive, obsessional”, she says. “Any time I use a formal thing in a poem I think, ‘Ooh, I’m in the great tradition!’ It’s something that happens a bit organically for me, though there’s nothing wrong with sitting down to write Alexandrine couplets – I might do that in my next book.”\n\nHalfway through our interview Freud thanks me for not having begun with a million questions about her family. But her famous relatives, their personalities and reputations and our curiosity about them, are inescapable – as all families are, to some extent, but in her case more so. She is the eldest child of the painter Lucian Freud and his first wife Kitty Godley, nee Epstein (daughter of the sculptor Jacob and his lover Kathleen Garman). Born in London in 1948, nine years after her great-grandfather Sigmund Freud’s death, she spent the first few years of her life in grand bohemian circles in Kensington, often on the top floor of her maternal grandmother’s home with her sister Annabel and a cousin.\n\nFor 10 years she went to the French lycée, then as fashionable as it was strait-laced, where she was taught to memorise chunks of the Encyclopaedia Britannica. At Cobham Hall, her next school, there was no science and lots of ballroom dancing, but she made it to Warwick University to study literature, and met her first husband while hitchhiking around France on her own.\n\n“I was brought up in the tradition of Elizabeth David,” Freud says, “my mother’s view of France was incredibly lunettes de rose”. Provincial, north-eastern France in the early 1970s did not live up to its romantic billing. The young couple returned to London, had a daughter, fell out and broke up.\n\nAfter her parents’ divorce, Freud’s mother married the economist Wynne Godley, while her father married Lady Caroline Blackwood. Blackwood’s cookery book Darling, You Shouldn’t Have Gone to So Much Trouble included a few recipes by stepdaughter Annie, who was “terribly proud” of them. But neither parent offered to support her financially, and after training as a teacher and giving up in terror, Freud took a job as a secretary for a publisher.\n\nFamously her father painted Annie nude when she was 14. Naked Child Laughing is more tender and modest than many of his later paintings: the teenager’s pubis is hidden by her folded thighs, her nipples by her arms and hair, while her chin rests heavily in one hand. She inherited her father’s strong facial features, and says he was “very in favour of me”, though she found his sparring with her stepfather “absolutely terrifying”. When she was small he would throw her all over the place – “I think he wanted me to be an acrobat” – and later pushed her towards acting, drawing the poster for one student play.\n\nBut Freud got scared of being on stage, and was more concerned about having a partner and family, which “meant sort of hiding my light under a bushel, letting someone else try to shine and not me”. Kitty, who had dropped her own painting to become her husband’s muse, had set the example and was not encouraging: “She used to say things like, ‘Why aren’t you designing the sets at Covent Garden?’ I used to find it so hard.” Her discovery in her 20s that the existence of a clutch of half-siblings had been kept from her came as a shock. Her father was furious when she refused to let her daughter May pose.\n\nFreud became what she calls a “corporate woman”, wearing shoulder-pads and working for the Greater London Council and London boroughs. But the creative aspirations did not go away and she carried on with her self-taught needlework and was sometimes paid for private commissions. On one wall of her house is a tapestry of her mother, pregnant, that took two years. Upstairs she shows me an unfinished piece of embroidery – clematis flowers on a white cotton scarf – begun as a present for the painter Francis Bacon’s sister but never finished.\n\nShe wrote a “rubbishy” novel, which a publisher rejected, but won praise for a set of screenplays adapted from EM Forster’s short stories. Realising that any prospect of their being made into films was faint, and hungry for an audience, in 1999 she signed up for poetry classes. Her first tutor, Michael Donaghy, changed her life: “He opened your eyes to all sorts of thing you might have adored when you were younger but forgotten about, or pushed away as dull or unmodern. He introduced us to all sorts of marvellous people we hadn’t heard of. I hadn’t even heard of him.” She made new friends, started going to several poetry readings a week and rediscovered her own pleasure in performing.\n\nAn older, well-off cousin began arranging outings; when they saw the poet Anne Carson it made a huge impression: “I had had a lot of very complicated and unhappy erotic relationships,” Freud says. Carson’s work was “so raw, full of the sort of emotional violence I was familiar with. I found her completely uncompromising.” The title poem of Freud’s first collection, The Best Man That Ever Was, is in the arch voice of a masochist recalling “the man who thrashed me, fed me, adored me”.\n\nFragile mental health and dissatisfaction led her to a psychoanalyst she saw several times a week for years, and who her helped her fashion the “new self” they agreed she needed. When he told her she was a good storyteller and then refused to elaborate, it made her so furious she didn’t go back for a week: “I had to deal with being told I was good at something I thought I was playing at. It was amazing, the anger I felt. He made me profoundly uncomfortable about my lack of seriousness about my talent.”\n\nAs a child at the lycée she had been punished for refusing to say her full name out loud, already self-conscious about its associations. Unhappy and humiliated after her first marriage ended, she began calling herself Annie Robinson until her mother told her to stop. Today Freud has embraced her name – and has fun mimicking the gasps and exclamations it elicits – and confirms she was one of the beneficiaries of her father’s peculiar will, which left an estate worth millions of pounds to one of his other daughters and his solicitor, in order that they might share it out among those on a secret list.\n\nLast year she, along with several of her siblings, read at the ceremony at Golders Green cemetery where their great-grandfather’s ashes were reinterred following an attempted theft that left the original third-century Greek urn in pieces. “We’re not going to sit down as a family and say, ‘How does being descendants of Siggy change us?’” she says, “but we all had a little glint in our eyes, you know?” She calls the extended family “amazingly harmonious – we’ve worked on ourselves, if you know what I mean”.\n\nShe joins in village life enthusiastically and teaches a poetry group in the pub. She and Dave are building a new studio for her to write and paint in. “I’m a lot more contented in myself for lots of reasons,” she says. “I’m able to give my concentration much more than I used to be able to, partly because I’m less anxious. I can get to a point where I hate my subject matter – you look and you look and this bastard won’t come to heel – but it’s a fruitful hatred.”\n\nThe Remains by Annie Freud is published by Picador.
