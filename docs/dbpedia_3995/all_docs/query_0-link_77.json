        "text": "Freudian slip-up: Why the founder of psychoanalysis was not as sex- obsessed as people think\n\nExpert claims mistranslations in psychoanalyst’s work gave people wrong impression of his views and personality\n\nLucian Freud’s daughter on posing naked for him at 19: ‘I was shocked when I saw the canvas’\n\nIn an exclusive extract from her new memoir, Rose Boyt recalls how sitting for a portrait by her father laid bare their complex relationship\n\n‘Admiring oneself is such a waste of energy’: British art’s great survivor Frank Auerbach\n\nThe feted artist on losing his family in the war, his reluctant turn to self-portraits, and why he paints as though he might die tomorrow\n\nThe portraits that turned Queen Elizabeth II into a cultural icon\n\nFrom Andy Warhol to Lucian Freud, the roll-call of Queen portraitists is long and illustrious. But what makes a truly great Royal image?\n\nThe Lucian Freud paintings you’ve (probably) never heard of\n\nThough renowned for his nudes and self-portraits, it was plantlife the artist turned to in tough times\n\nLucian Freud: The Painter and His Family: a tiny but delightfully domestic show\n\nIts eye more on biography as opposed just the arts, the Freud Museum’s latest is a last hurrah for the gossipy school of art history\n\nNew letters reveal Lucian Freud's secret language to friend 'Cragss'\n\nThe discovery is said to be among the most important group of letters written by the British painter\n\n'Exquisite, robust and also faintly dangerous': the colourful history of the Benton End art colony\n\nAn exhibition at Firstsite explores how a house in the Suffolk countryside became a hothouse for artists including Lucian Freud"
