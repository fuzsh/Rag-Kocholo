        "text": "'A model of intelligent design … The raw spontaneity and energy of each illustrated page conveys Freud’s moods and preoccupations in a way that no biographer can match. Altogether, this is as vivid a Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man as we shall ever have, and compelling reading for Freud aficionados and amateur psychologists alike'\n\nThe Spectator\n\n'Handsome and enthralling … LOVE LUCIAN is unique, a sort of biographical tapestry woven around a set of missives reproduced in facsimile that are at once skimpy, slapdash, funny and, in many cases, idiosyncratically but beautifully illustrated works of pictorial art'\n\nGuardian\n\n'Playful, gossipy and charming – unpublished letters by a young Lucian Freud show the great artist in a new light'\n\nDaily Telegraph\n\n'Charming … reveals a new side of [Freud’s] character'\n\nThe Art Newspaper\n\n'Witty and irreverent'\n\nHarper's Bazaar\n\n'Sheds light on the internal voice and ponderings of one of the greatest painters of the 20th century ... a revelation'\n\nLuxury London\n\n'Offer[s] the artist's correspondence in facsimile, the better to appreciate his doodles and drawings ... [A] sumptuous, illustrated collage of the artist's development'\n\nVogue Inc\n\n'A lively and entertaining read'\n\nartbookreview.com\n\n'An inviting portrait of the artist as a young man through facsimiles of his handwritten, often lavishly embellished personal correspondence ... Richly illustrated'\n\nNPR\n\n'Love Lucian is beautifully presented, and contextualized with wit and an expert’s discernment. It doesn’t hurt that Freud was one of the century’s great talkers, rogues, and talents'\n\nAir Mail\n\n'Compelling and subtly captivating … That the letters are reproduced in full colour adds much to the book’s charm and gives a great sense of intimacy … Alongside the letters is a sensitively written account of the progress of Lucian’s contemporary life as well as a generous selection of superb reproductions of his work, providing plenty of context … an intimate and affectionate, curated portrait of a great man in his own words'\n\nHenry Malt, The Artist"
