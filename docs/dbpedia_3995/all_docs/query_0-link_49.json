        "text": "He was the most interesting man in London, conventional wisdom had it. I don’t think I ever met anyone more remarkable.\n\nFor years Lucian Freud maintained a conspicuous privacy, fueling the rumors about women and gambling and models, which in the end really had little or nothing to do with his work. Even close friends didn’t have his phone number. They would have to reach him through his solicitor or, later, his assistant. In time he became a little more accessible to journalists and filmmakers and biographers.\n\nBut he always understood the uses of mystery, for aiding his reputation and saving it. His private life remained his private life, and he kept it private so he could work. It was all about the work in the end.\n\nWe met nearly 20 years ago through Lady Caroline Blackwood, the dark-witted novelist to whom he was married briefly during the 1950s. She’s the one in those doleful portraits of a beautiful, big-eyed, tousle-haired blonde. He and I saw each other on and off after that. We sometimes met for dinner at the Wolseley, where he always commanded the most conspicuous table in the room, although, having chosen to be the center of attention, he abhorred interlopers. Lucian didn’t do small talk.\n\nOccasionally he would telephone me at some odd hour, to talk about what he was painting or an exhibition he had seen. He went straight to the point, but then the conversation would drift, and he would recall something appalling about Picasso or something clever Giacometti had told him or something about his grandfather Sigmund, whom he remembered fondly, or his aunt Anna, whom he detested.\n\nMostly we met in his studio or at home. Slowly he would present each work in progress. Half-finished, his pictures often looked ungainly to me. I didn’t always know what to say. I only knew that the last thing to say to Lucian would be anything polite or conventional.\n\nHe loathed gentility and social convention. To him they smacked of fakery, like the various artistic symbolisms, Surrealism among them, that modern painting had contrived. The real world, stripped bare, already presented unfathomable strangeness and fascination. An artistic life should exhaust itself trying to unpack it.\n\nDifficult and unpredictable in his prime, Lucian was also famously funny, as eulogists are recalling after his death this week at 88. He was incapable of saying or doing anything routine. It occurs to me now how curious this observation might sound, considering that in his art he stuck almost entirely to portraiture, and his life was completely subordinated to unwavering studio routines. He rarely even left London during the last half-century.\n\nWhen we talked recently about visiting the Prado in Madrid, he remarked that it had been nearly 60 years since he had last gone there. A show of his work at the Pompidou Center last year became the first occasion in decades for him to return to Paris, which he once knew well. He made noises about returning to Berlin, where he was born, and where I live, but he had too much work to do, he said. There was always the work.\n\nSometimes he succeeded at it, sometimes not. That’s the fate of every great artist and any good one. I’ve always thought that his landscape etchings, those dense, complex, angular views of the little, wild garden behind his house, and of other odd corners of London, trump many of the portraits as finely, lovingly seen and felt.\n\nBut the best of the portraits take their place in the history of painting. A few American critics, addicted to anything new, have moaned that his sullen and fleshy figures put him out of step with where contemporary taste was headed. Never mind that tastes changed over his long career so that he went in and out of fashion, and finally in again, the art market eventually making him a very rich man. That he sometimes squandered those riches at the track was his business. A commission could always set him straight.\n\nMostly, though, he declined commissions, painting only friends and family and those he chose himself. Models had to spend weeks, months, years sitting for him. The process entailed painstaking relationships. Doubters surmised that Lucian returned sitters’ patience and generosity by flaying them alive in paint.\n\nBut this view misinterprets the humanity of his work and the pleasure of his company. The painter Frank Auerbach, one of his oldest friends, recently recalled for me how years ago Lucian asked George Dyer, Francis Bacon’s long-suffering lover, to sit for him when Dyer was suicidal and had no place else to turn. Lucian framed it as a favor, avoiding the appearance of pity.\n\nYears ago, he picked me up in the middle of the night in his Bentley, which he always drove very fast and very badly. He parked within walking distance of a curb near Trafalgar Square, then shepherded me into the National Gallery, where he had arranged late-night access for us. He wanted to see Chardin’s portrait of a young schoolmistress.\n\nWe stood in the yawning silence, blinking.\n\n“I’ve looked at this picture very often but I’d never really noticed this shadow before,” he suddenly said, pointing to a patch of burnt umber near the elbow. “It is in the nature of his work that you don’t question it,” he added about Chardin, “any more than you notice the vocal timbre of someone who is telling you something that is very important.” His voice echoed in the vast, empty room.\n\nBefore his death, he occupied his days with a big portrait of David Dawson, his devoted assistant and frequent model. It sat on his easel by the window overlooking the garden. For months David sat curled up naked on the floor beneath the easel, with his dog. Months turned into years. There was the vague hope that the picture might be done before a retrospective of Lucian’s work next year at the National Portrait Gallery. But after a while it became apparent that finishing the picture was never really the point.\n\nLucian seemed content. I last saw him a couple of months ago over breakfast in the pretty restaurant near his house where he and David often started the workday, at a solitary corner table, guarded by the restaurant’s owner. A friend of David’s, an artist from the neighborhood whom Lucian clearly had long known but could no longer seem to recognize, stopped by to ask after Lucian’s health. In the old days he would have snapped at the intrusion. Now he nodded absently.\n\n“Fine,” he offered.\n\n“I love you,” she then said, out of the blue, touching his shoulder and kissing him gently on the forehead before leaving.\n\nShe isn’t alone. Having led a life in full, Lucian has earned a bounty of affection.\n\nI glanced over at him as the woman departed. He looked sheepish but pleased."
