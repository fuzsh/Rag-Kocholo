        "text": "Written by an art critic William Feaver, The Lives of Lucian Freud: Fame 1968 – 2011 features a series of conversations the author had with Lucian Freud, as well as Freud's private papers, letters, and interviews Feaver did with the artist’s friends and family to explore the intimate life of Freud. The period between 1968 and 2011 was very fruitful for the artist since he painted fiercely and was getting international recognition.\n\nThis book charts his dramatic affair with Jacquetta Eliot and the start of two important friendships with Jane Willoughby and Susanna Chancellor. During that time, Lucian Freud's friendship with Francis Bacon came to an end and he developed a new friendship with Frank Auerbach. From the nineties through the 2000s, he portrayed iconic figures such as performance artist Leigh Bowery, Kate Moss, Jerry Hall, his longtime assistant, David Dawson, his own children, and, in 2001, Queen Elizabeth. By unraveling new insights surrounding his life and his career, this book created a dazzling portrait of one of the most interesting artists of the 20th century.\n\nFeatured image: William Feaver, The Lives of Lucian Freud: Fame 1968 – 2011 book cover.

The author’s remembrance of their daily encounters, compiled in a book simply titled Lucian Freud, offers the reader a chance to plunge into the artist’s studio, his most private place, and to understand better the process of this modern master. Gayford imagined this book around a series of close-ups of the artist at work and in conversation in public space and in his studio. The book features many of Lucian Freud’s works, photographs taken by David Dawson of Freud in his studio, and images by prolific painters such as van Gogh and Titian, whom Freud and Gayford discuss.\n\nFeatured image: Man with a Blue Scarf: On Sitting for a Portrait by Lucian Freud book cover.

The private life of Lucian Freud is chronologically analyzed, starting from his childhood snapshots to rarely seen photographs made in his studio in the last weeks of his life. In addition, the artist’s life is illuminated through family photos, images of him in his studio in the presence of some of his most celebrated sitters, and portraits by his peers.\n\nFeatured image: Mark Holborn, David Dawson - Lucian Freud: A Life book cover.

Accompanied by insightful commentary, it offers an intimate insight into the artist’s personality and practice.\n\nThanks to the Freud estate, Freud’s early letters have been gathered from private collections and public archives. These manuscripts include Freud’s schoolboy notes to his parents as well as his early recognition as a professional artist, revealing the complexity of Freud’s personality. These illustrated letters are reproduced in facsimiles alongside the reproductions of Freud’s works of this period.\n\nFeatured image: David Dawson, Martin Gayford, Love Lucian: The Letters of Lucian Freud, 1939 – 1954 book cover.

Lucian Freud is widely recognized for his portraits, which are highly regarded for their remarkable level of detail and piercing intensity. However, despite approaching his depictions of flowers and plants with the same meticulous approach, these great paintings have largely remained obscure and unknown to many. While Freud's floral pieces may not be as famous as his portraits, they are just as noteworthy for their precision and depth of observation. Therefore, this publication casts a new light on the way Freud has been working with plants and, as such, significantly contributes to his legacy.\n\nFeatured image: Giovanni Aloi, Lucian Freud Herbarium book cover.

Freud was very protective of his privacy, and only a few people had access to his intimacy, such as the late Bruce Bernard, who made several portraits of the artist. However, David Dawson was the privileged one in front of whom Freud felt comfortable and allowed him to be photographed while working in the studio. A Painter’s Progress is yet another fascinating document centered on one of our most important and influential painters.\n\nFeatured image: David Dawson, A Painter's Progress: A Portrait of Lucian Freud book cover.
