        "text": "On the occasion of the centenary of Lucian Freud's birth, this book seeks to broaden our understanding of the artist and his working method through a variety of original essays and interviews with contemporary painters. Featuring artworks spanning the entirety of Freud's 70-year career, New Perspectives offers fresh insights into one of the 20th century's most renowned artists.\n\nLucian Freud. New Perspectives is published on the occasion of the exhibition jointly organised by the National Gallery, London, and the Museo Nacional Thyssen-Bornemisza, Madrid, marking the centenary of Lucian Freud's birth in 1922. By the time of his death in 2011, at the age of 88, Freud had become a powerful, incisive and sometimes controversial presence on the international art scene for more than six decades. Born in Berlin, Freud was the son of an architect father and a mother who had studied philology and art history; his grandfather was the founder of psychoanalysis, Sigmund Freud. In 1933, when Hitler came to power in Germany, Lucian Freud's family moved to London, so his career as a painter was spent in England. Once he had decided on his path as an artist, his commitment to painting and figuration was unwavering. This is the first retrospective of Freud's painting to be shown in two historic art museums and situates the artist both physically and conceptually within a narrative of painting and the representation of the human form that has evolved over the centuries. Freud's place within and contribution to this history is undoubtedly significant.\n\nAuthors: Daniel F. Herrmann with texts by Paloma Alarcó, David Dawson, Tracey Emin, Chantal Joffe, Christina Kennedy, Jutha Koether, Catherine Lampert, Maria H. Loh, Nicholas Penny, Gregory Salter, Jasper Sharp and Andrew Wilson.\n\nCurators: Paloma Alarcó and Daniel F. Herrmann\n\nPublished by the Museo Nacional Thyssen-Bornemisza in collaboration with National Gallery Global.\n\nISBN: 9788417173715\n\nDimensions: 24 x 29 cm (W x H) 224 pages. Hardcover\n\nLanguage: Spanish."
