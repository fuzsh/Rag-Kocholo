        "text": "An American hip-hop duo from New York City that was popular in the late 1980s and early 1990s. The duo was composed of Christopher Reid (\"Kid\") and Christopher Martin (\"Play\")\n\nThey met while performing in rival high school groups The Turnout Brothers and The Super Lovers, and initially formed their duo under the name The Fresh Force Crew. In 1986 She's a Skeezer and Rock Me were recorded. By 1987 they had changed their name to Kid 'n Play.\n\nIn 1992\n\nKid 'n Play recorded three albums together between 1988 and 1991: 2 Hype (1988), Kid 'n Play's Funhouse (1990), and Face the Nation (1991). All three albums focused upon positive lyrics backed by pop-friendly instrumental tracks.\n\nAmong the group's most successful singles were 1989's \"Rollin' with Kid 'n Play\" (#11 on the Billboard R&B singles chart), 1990s \"Funhouse\" (#1 on the Billboard rap singles chart), and \"Ain't Gonna Hurt Nobody\" (another #1 rap hit).\n\nKid 'n Play were also notable for their dance known as the Kid n' Play Kickstep, first seen in their video \"Do This My Way,\" and described in the song \"Do the Kid n' Play Kickstep,\" from their first album, 2 Hype. Also affectionately known as the \"Funky Charleston,\" the Kid n' Play Kickstep featured the new jack swing-aerobic dance moves typical of late 1980s urban street dancing. Unlike the original 1920s Charleston, The Kid N' Play Kickstep requires two participants instead of one. This dance also was made quite popular in Kid N' Play's feature film House Party."
