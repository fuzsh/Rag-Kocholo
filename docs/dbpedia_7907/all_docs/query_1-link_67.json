        "text": "Saturday night I attended a classical house show in Brighton, MA. The event was put on by Groupmuse, a service that pairs classical performances with audiences keen to hear good music in a low-pressure situation (e.g. somebody’s house).\n\nGroupmuse organized the event. Hosts volunteer their house or workspace for a performance. Musicians sign up to play, and once a program is agreed upon an event is created.\n\nGroupmuse users (Groupmusers?) can then agree to attend, although nothing is confirmed until you get this guy:\n\nSetting aside how we feel about emoticons, this email is sure to send a frisson of excitement up your spine. You’re in the club.\n\nAfter procuring alcoholic beverages and snacks, we drove to Brighton, parked semi-legally, and were greeted at the door by this sign.\n\nWe navigated a perilously icy driveway, got inside and mingled a bit before the show.\n\nThe two musicians on the evening were violist Mathilde Geismar and bass player Kevin Garcon.\n\nThey were unafraid of having their photos taken.\n\nHost Ben Ginsburg offered a few words of introduction, as beers were cracked and phones silenced.\n\nThen we were off. The program started with some Bach from his Fifth Cello Suite. It was a deep, brooding c minor situation. Garcon started it off before it morphed into a duo.\n\nWe were also treated to J.M. Sperger’s “Romanze” for viola and doublebass, Sándor Veress’s “Memento,” György Kurtág’s “Signs, Games and Messages” transcribed for bass, and a movement of György Ligeti’s “Sonata for viola” played exclusively on the C string.\n\nThe audience dug it.\n\nAnd the performers seemed pleased themselves.\n\nGroupmuse is a non-threatening dose of classical best enjoyed with a (double-)cup of cheer. Right now, the service is only available in Boston and New York. I have a feeling it will expand rapidly as the many imitators crop up."
