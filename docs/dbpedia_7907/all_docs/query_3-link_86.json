        "text": "When you hear the name Kid N’ Play, you most likely think about the 1990 film, House Party. That’s right the cult classic starring Christopher “Kid” Reid, Christopher “Play” Martin, Martin Lawrence, Tisha Campbell, A.J. Johnson, Full Force, and John Witherspoon hit movie theaters a quarter of a century ago.\n\nHowever, Christopher “Kid” Reid and Christopher “Play” Martin are more than just the two funny guys who wanted to throw a party when their parents were out of town. Since the release of their 1988 album, 2 Hype, which went gold, Kid N’ Play have been entertaining hip-hop lovers all over the world with their upbeat sounds, good energy and iconic dance moves.\n\nReid was born in The Bronx, New York City, to a Jamaican father and an Irish mother. He graduated from the Bronx High School of Science in 1982. He also graduated from Lehman College in the Bronx after attending Miles College.\n\nReid says now that he’s older, “Kid N’ Play can now be called ‘Grown N’ Worked’ Ha!”\n\nReid has lived “full life” in his words.\n\n“When I was growing up I had an afro and these real thick glasses and Play was this dude that always dressed fly, he had guns. So I was like this guy is cool!”\n\nCLICK HERE to read story"
