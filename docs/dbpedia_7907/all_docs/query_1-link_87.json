        "text": "Reid was taken into custody by traffic cops on a DUI suspended license warrant, LAPD spokeswoman Officer Rosario Herrera tells E! News. Per his booking sheet, bail was set at $26,000 and he is currently still in custody.\n\nReid, 47, was \"very cooperative\" with officers, according to TMZ, which first reported the bust.\n\nThe warrant for the Class Act star's arrest was issued last month after he missed a court date pertaining to the license violation. He pleaded no contest to driving under the influence in 2010 and was sentenced to three years' probation, ordered to attend 10 AA meetings and an alcohol-education program, and fined more than $1,400.\n\nThe hip-hopster's talent agent tells E! News that \"we are aware of what's going on,\" but declined to comment further.\n\nReid and fellow MC Christopher Martin made up the group Kid 'n Play, which was better known for the hit House Party movie comedies—of which they starred in three—than their music.\n\nWhen he's not making TV guest appearances, Reid also tours as a stand-up comedian."
