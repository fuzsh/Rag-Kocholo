        "text": "I dont think Keanu was Jesus. Nor is he immortal. My neighbor played in the Replacements with him...I see pic all ova his house of him and Keanu. Keanu is a strange name tho...My neighbor said that yo is cool and I think if he was a vampire he would of said **** takin pics with this extra who means nothing to me instead he took time out to spend with an extra on the set. Unless hes some good guy vamp!!\n\nHe has stories of when he met Charles Barkley lets say Keanu is peaches & cream compared to Mr. Barkley. I kno this dont mean nothing much just because he kiked with my neighbor for a few he still could be something, I dont trust nobody personally I was just giving my share of a person that met and shared behind the scenes involvement with him. U feel Me!"
