Actor and Comedian, Christopher Reid who is best known as "Kid" from the hit rap duo Kid 'n Play, is in Rochester and is performing July 27- 29 at the Comedy @ the Carlson.

Reid was notable for his exaggerated hi-top fade haircut and starring in the House Party movies as well as television programs, including Martin and Sister, Sister.

This morning on GDR, he visited us in the studio to tell us more about his transition from singing to acting and now to his latest venture, comedy.
