        "text": "Patricia Gallinek, RN, Global Healing Photograph Collection\n\nPatricia Gallinek, RN, donated a collection of approximately 500 photographs documenting her experiences as a volunteer for organizations involved in healthcare around the world. She embarked on a career of photojournalism in 1990 after 30 years in the nursing profession. The subject matter includes physicians at work, nurses, technicians, and patients. Capturing intensely emotional scenes of despair, her images thoughtfully and respectfully evoke the sense of humanity, perseverance, and friendship that she found in the communities she visited. All images were photographed and printed by Ms. Gallinek.\n\nRead More on Circulating Now\n\nCharles R.
