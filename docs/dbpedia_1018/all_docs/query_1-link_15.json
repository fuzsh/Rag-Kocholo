It means you are supporting a yearlong mission to Remember the fallen, Honor those who serve and Teach the next generation the value of freedom. Your sponsorship will support the new and existing programs developed to share the mission. A wreath will be placed to honor an American hero at one of more than 3,700 participating locations this year on National Wreaths Across America Day.\n\nWe can’t do that without your support, though. Your sponsorship will ensure that a wreath is hand-crafted of all-American balsam and hand-tied with a red velvet bow here in Columbia Falls, Maine. It will then be sent to one of our participating locations, where a volunteer will place it on the marker of a hero. That volunteer will then “say their name” to ensure that the legacy of duty, service and sacrifice is never forgotten.\n\nSo, what does it mean to sponsor a wreath? It means you have the opportunity to join a grateful nation in saying “thank you” to those who stepped up to serve.\n\n*Please Note: Specific locations designated as \"ceremonial-only\" accept a limited number of sponsorships. Any additional sponsorships received beyond those used for the ceremony will be distributed to other locations.\n\nDid you know that Wreaths Across America now offers recurring sponsorships?
