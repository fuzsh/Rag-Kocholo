        "text": "What to Include in a Military Care Package\n\nSome of the best care packages deployed personnel receive are the ones that have practical items in them. On military bases, there isn't a whole lot of room for clutter, so sometimes the things that are most important are the most useful things that help service members do their job.\n\nImportant Tip: Don't forget to seal everything in plastic zip-lock bags. This protects your care package from the elements and the soldier from receiving snacks that taste like soap.\n\nPersonal and Practical Items\n\nService members are on their feet a lot when deployed, so some of the best items are those that help keep them dry, clean and comfortable. These may include the following:\n\nHigh-quality socks (This is first because some high-quality socks will make the toughest soldier smile with delight)\n\nSoap (shampoo, body wash, face wash, etc.)\n\nToothpaste, toothbrush and floss\n\nDeodorant (travel size/non-aerosol)\n\nLip balm\n\nFoot powder\n\nBaby wipes\n\nSunscreen\n\nHand sanitizer\n\nPain-relieving topical cream (not a necessity, but can be a real luxury)\n\nVicks VapoRub\n\nHand Warmers\n\nSewing kits\n\nLens cleaning cloths and glass cleaner for goggles\n\nDowntime Activities\n\nMany service members have plenty of downtime as well. However, they do not have unlimited access to smartphones or the Internet, so they have to be creative to keep themselves occupied or have fun.\n\nSome helpful items to consider include:\n\nReading material (magazines, books or an e-reader like a Kindle)\n\nHandheld video games\n\nBoard games\n\nDecks of cards\n\niPod or thumb drives with movies, music and pictures\n\nPuzzles\n\nPlastic model kits\n\nBaseball gloves/baseballs\n\nBatteries (AAs and AAAs)\n\nPencils\n\n3M wall hooks to decorate\n\nReally anything that could help decompress from a stressful day and focus on something else.\n\nFood and Snacks\n\nThe best way to anyone's heart is through their stomach, and deployed service members are no different.\n\nWhile there's enough food to go around on base, much of it can be a little bland and the variety is lacking. Try including some of the following:\n\nHot sauce (a great commodity to have around, and the convenience of Taco Bell sauce packets are great to have in the field)\n\nWater flavoring packets (many deployment areas are very hot, and service members need to constantly remain hydrated)\n\nBeef jerky\n\nSlim Jims\n\nProtein bars\n\nGum\n\nSunflower seeds\n\nAs with anything you send, it needs to be non-perishable. Sending homemade cookies or soft candies halfway around the world just won't cut it. Please don't send food in the same package as you do shampoo or other toiletriesâ€”there's nothing worse than getting some treats from home covered in soap.\n\nSentimental Things\n\nWhile all of the above are great, sometimes we just need an extra boost of confidence from home. While emails are convenient, they don't have the same poignancy and convey the same emotion as a hand-written letter.\n\nRemember to take videos of everything: baby's first steps, parties, family get-togethers and even just lounging around the house. You can even put some of those on a USB drive and send it, too.\n\nWhat Not to Send in a Military Care Package\n\nNot everything is suitable for a care package. Here are a few things to avoid:\n\nAdult entertainment, alcohol or drugs (these items are illegal and can get the soldier in trouble)\n\nAerosols or pressurized products\n\nFirearms or ammunition (this is illegal)\n\nPerishable foods\n\nAn entire box of the same thing unless requested (variety is a good thing)\n\nOverall, keep in mind that whatever you send may not make it in the condition you expect. Along the way, things might get wet, break, freeze or be in shipping containers for a period of time. Make sure to check the USPS shipping restrictions list beforehand.\n\nWhere to Send Your Care Package"
