For further information on open days and times, events or tours, please call 317-232-7615.\n\nThe Indiana War Memorial Plaza Historic District includes the 30,000 square foot IWM Museum complete with military equipment and artifacts, three parks, four fountains, and 25 acres of monuments, statues, and sculptures in the heart of downtown Indianapolis. The IWM's properties include the Indiana War Memorial, the Soldiers and Sailors Monument, the Indiana World War II, Korean War, and Vietnam War Memorials, the USS Indianapolis (CA-35) Memorial, the Medal of Honor Memorial, the 9/11 Memorial, and the Indiana Gold Star Families Memorial. No state has a city with more monuments dedicated to veterans than Indiana's capital, and no city in the country maintains more acreage honoring veterans than Indianapolis. It is also home to the American Legion National Headquarters, which is the largest veterans' organization in the world. The IWM Commission operates these facilities in pursuit of its primary mission: to commemorate the valor and sacrifice of the United States Armed Forces and to honor Hoosier veterans and Indiana's role in the nation's conflicts.\n\nPlease note: Due to recent construction and reorganization of exhibit and storage spaces, the Indiana War Memorial Museum is no longer accepting loans of objects. Donations of objects are still accepted on a case-by-case basis. For more information, please contact Collections at 317-233-8505 or dscharfenberg@iwm.in.gov. Thank you.\n\nFor more information about the Indiana War Memorials, please visit the Indiana War Memorials Foundation.\n\nMessage from the Executive Director\n\nIWM Historic District interview with Brigadier General Stewart Goodwin, Executive Director IWM\n\nLeadership Interview with Brigadier General Stewart Goodwin, Executive Director IWM\n\nHours of Operation\n\nThe Indiana War Memorial Museum is open Wednesday-Sunday from 9:00 AM to 5:00 PM.\n\nThe IWM Business Office is open Monday-Friday from 8:00 AM to 4:00 PM.\n\nThe Soldiers & Sailors Monument and Gift Shop are open Thursday-Sunday from 10:30 AM to 5:30 PM.\n\nThe War Memorials are closed on all National and State holidays except Memorial Day and Veterans Day.\n\nThe Indiana War Memorial will be closed Thursday July 4 due to the fireworks display.\n\nBricks of Honor\n\nThe Indiana War Memorials Foundation commemorates veterans with \"Bricks of Honor\".

You can order a brick for $125 tax-deductible charitable donation. You may also request the location of your brick and schedule a ceremony to have it installed with the veteran and family present. Bricks of Honor are prepared and installed on a quarterly basis as weather permits. For more information, please visit IWMF's Bricks of Honor page, or download the brochure.\n\nGirl Scouts for Old Glory\n\nThe Indiana War Memorials has collaborated with the Girl Scouts of Central Indiana to collect US Flags that should be retired. The purpose of the collection is to provide a proper way of retiring the flags, which will take place at the Girl Scouts summer camps where the scouts will learn the history and meaning of flag retirement. Flags will be collected at the Indiana War Memorial throughout the year. US Flags that are structurally damaged or faded should be respectfully retired. This program provides for proper retirement and presents a learning opportunity for the Girl Scouts. Click here to listen to an interview about the program on WFYI's \"No Limits\".\n\nLatest News"
