        "text": "Soldiers and Sailors Monument\n\nRecognized as one of the world's outstanding monuments, the structure has come to symbolize both the City of Indianapolis and the state of Indiana. The Soldiers & Sailors Monument is Indiana's official memorial to the Hoosiers that served in the Revolutionary War, the War of 1812, the Mexican War, the Civil War, the Frontier Wars and the Spanish-American War.\n\nThe Limestone used for the monument is gray oolitic limestone from the Romona quarries of Owen County. It stands 284 feet, 6 inches high, only 15 feet shorter than the Statue of Liberty. It cost $598,318 in 1902.\n\nThe commission for the monument construction requested architects to submit design proposals. Of the seventy proposals turned in, two finalists were chosen. From those two, Bruno Schmitz of Berlin, Germany, received the appointment.\n\nThere are a number of art works either built into the Monument, or placed throughout the grounds. Bruno Schmitz brought with him Rudolf Schwarz. Schwarz was sculptor for the statuary groups \"War\" and \"Peace\", \"The Dying Soldier\", \"The Homefront\" and the four statues at the corners of the Monument that represents the Infantry, Cavalry, Artillery, and Navy. The Monument is crowned with a statue of Victory, holding a sword in her right hand and a torch in her left. For more information, please see:\n\nView the Art and Architecture of the Monument\n\nStory of the Monument's Limestone Sculptures\n\nHistory of the Victory Sculpture\n\nVictory Repair and Restoration Project\n\nVictory Project Photos\n\nGift Shop and Observation Tower\n\nThe Soldiers & Sailors Monument houses a Gift Shop and Observatory.
