        "text": "The Normandy American Cemetery and Memorial in France is located in Colleville-sur-Mer, on the site of the temporary American St. Laurent Cemetery, established by the U.S. First Army on June 8, 1944 as the first American cemetery on European soil in World War II. The cemetery site, at the north end of its half mile access road, covers 172.5 acres and contains the graves of 9,389 of our military dead, most of whom lost their lives in the D-Day landings and ensuing operations. On the Walls of the Missing, in a semicircular garden on the east side of the memorial, are inscribed 1,557 names. Rosettes mark the names of those since recovered and identified.\n\nThe memorial consists of a semicircular colonnade with a loggia at each end containing large maps and narratives of the military operations; at the center is the bronze statue, “Spirit of American Youth Rising from the Waves.” An orientation table overlooking the beach depicts the landings in Normandy. Facing west at the memorial, one sees in the foreground the reflecting pool; beyond is the burial area with a circular chapel and, at the far end, granite statues representing the United States and France.\n\nIn 2007, the Normandy Visitor Center opened. The $30 million visitor center was dedicated by the American Battle Monuments Commission (ABMC) on June 6, 2007 during the commemoration of the 63rd Anniversary of D-Day. The center is sited in a wooded area of the cemetery approximately 100 meters east of the Garden of the Missing.\n\nLearn more about the architecture, exhibits, inscriptions, and the project team.\n\nNormandy is ABMC's most visited cemetery, receiving more than one million visitors each year. To plan a site visit, a visit to a relative's grave, request a group visit, special tour, or wreath laying ceremony, please contact NormandyVisits@abmc.gov.\n\nDue to security concerns, the pathway from Normandy American Cemetery to the beach was closed to the public in 2016. However, public beach access is available nearby.\n\nThe flag lowering ceremony is held one hour before the cemetery closes to the public.\n\nFor questions, please contact us at NormandyVisits@abmc.gov.\n\nGPS Coordinates: 49° 20' 55\" N , 0° 51' 17\" W\n\nNormandy American Cemetery sits on a cliff overlooking Omaha Beach and the English Channel, east of St. Laurent-sur-Mer and northwest of Bayeux in Colleville-sur-Mer.\n\nTravel via Car\n\nTravel via highway A-13 towards Caen. Continue on N-13 to Bayeux and Formigny. Continue on D-517 towards St. Laurent-sur-Mer and D-514 to Colleville-sur-Mer. Signs mark the entrance to the cemetery.\n\nTravel via Train\n\nThere is rail service between Paris (Gare St. Lazare) and Bayeux, where taxis and tour bus service is available. Travel by rail takes three hours.\n\nTravel via Airplane\n\nParis is approximately 170 miles east of the cemetery.\n\nLodging\n\nHotels are available in Bayeux and Port-en-Bessin.\n\nDogs\n\nDogs are not permitted in the cemetery, unless it is a service animal.\n\nAccess to Omaha Beach:\n\nDue to security concerns, the pathway from Normandy American Cemetery to the beach was closed to the public in 2016. However, public beach access is available nearby.\n\nOmaha Beach can be accessed by taking D514 west from the cemetery to St Laurent sur Mer. Take the first exit at the traffic circle. This road will take you to the beach, where there is plenty of parking.\n\nOmaha Beach can also be accessed by taking D514 east from the cemetery to Colleville sur Mer.
