        "text": "2. Campaign and service medal categories\n\n2.1 What are campaign medals?\n\nCampaign or war medals were awarded to members of the armed services and eligible civilians, for taking part in a campaign or for service in time of war. Awards for service in a particular battle within a war often took the shape of clasps attached to medal ribbons.\n\n2.2 What are long service and good conduct medals?\n\nThese medals were awarded to warrant officers, non-commissioned officers and other ranks. They were not dependent on having seen action.\n\n2.3 What are commemorative medals?\n\nCommemorative medals are not awarded for military service and are not worn on service uniforms. Instead, they are awarded for attendance at a particular event or for service in a non-military operation.\n\n3. Campaign and service medal records\n\n3.1 Medal rolls\n\nInformation about the award of campaign medals is recorded on medal rolls. These are usually arranged by regiment/battalion (for the Army) or by ship (for the Royal Navy), then by rank, then name. Medal rolls are lists of men entitled to a particular medal, they do not give detailed information about individuals, recording only:\n\nthe recipients’ regimental/service number\n\na note of the clasps to which he or she was entitled\n\nwhether the medal was received or not (a tick against the name indicates it was received; a cross against the name indicates that the delivery of the medal failed or that it was returned)\n\n3.2 Medal index cards\n\nMedal index cards were used for recording First World War campaign medals issued to individuals. They contain more detail than the medal roll. Unlike the long lists which make up the medal rolls, for which these cards provided the index, each medal index card is unique to the soldier for whom it was completed.\n\nTypically each card contains:\n\nregiment or other unit (but not battalion)\n\nservice number\n\nrank\n\nlist of medals awarded\n\na reference to the medal roll\n\nLess consistently, cards may also contain:\n\nthe date the soldier first entered a theatre of war\n\nthe theatre of war in which the soldier served\n\nIn the space on the card headed ‘Remarks’ the following information is sometimes recorded:\n\ndate of death\n\nif the soldier was taken prisoner\n\ncause of discharge (usually indicated by a code reference to the King’s Regulations)\n\n4. How to find records of campaign medals\n\n4.1 Before 1914\n\nFor records of medals awarded for service before 1914, search by name on the Ancestry (£) website. There are separate search pages for the Army (sourced from WO 100) and for the Royal Navy and Royal Marines (sourced from ADM 171).\n\n4.2 First World War, 1914-1918\n\nAll servicemen, some women, and some civilians, were eligible for one or more campaign medals if they served abroad. These records are the nearest we have to a full ‘roll-call’ for the First World War. The medal rolls are variously arranged and accessed for each service. Details of what each medal was awarded for can be found in Appendix 1 below.\n\na. Army and Royal Flying Corps\n\nFor the Army and the Royal Flying Corps there are medal index cards as well as medal rolls. There are medal index cards for over 5.5 million men who served abroad in the First World War. Army officers were not automatically issued campaign medals, they had to apply for them, so there may not be a card for an officer. Each card should contain the soldier’s name, corps (regiment), rank, regimental number, perhaps the first theatre of war served in and the date of entry to it, as well as other remarks and of course the medals awarded. The cards are in document series WO 372 but copies can be viewed online and are name-searchable. Each card also provides a reference number which refers to an entry on the medal rolls (WO 329). These medal rolls are available online via Ancestry (£) and you can search them by name and regimental number. The only additional information sometimes available on the rolls is the soldier’s battalion number, which you will need if you want to find the battalion war diary: see British Army operations in the First World War.\n\nb. Royal Navy, Royal Marines and Royal Naval Air Service\n\nSearch for an individual by name on the Ancestry (£) website. The original medal rolls are in series ADM 171, split into several sequences as detailed in the table below. Entries in the medal rolls are in alphabetical order, so there is no need for an index. Explanations of the abbreviations used in some of the medal rolls can be found in Appendix 2 below.\n\nService and rank Series reference Royal Navy: Officers ADM 171/89, ADM 171/90 and ADM 171/91 Royal Navy: Ratings ADM 171/94-119 Royal Marines: Officers ADM 171/92 and ADM 171/93 Royal Marines: NCOs and Men ADM 171/167 Royal Naval Reserve: Officers ADM 171/92 and ADM 171/93 Royal Naval Volunteer Reserve: Ratings ADM 171/125 Mercantile Marine Reserve: Ratings ADM 171/130 Miscellaneous: e.g. WRNS, canteen staff ADM 171/133\n\nc. Royal Air Force\n\nThough RAF airmen did receive campaign medals, there are no medal rolls in The National Archives for men who joined after the formation of the RAF in April 1918, only for those who had already served with the Royal Flying Corps and went on to serve in the RAF. See the Royal Air Force personnel research guide for more information.\n\n4.3 Inter-war period, 1920-1939\n\nArmy medal rolls for the inter-war period can be searched by name on the Ancestry (£) website. The original documents are available in WO 100/411-493. A number of other campaign medal rolls for the Army up to 1939 can be found in WO 100/398-410, including medal rolls for operations in Iraq, Africa and India. Royal Naval and Royal Air Force campaign medal rolls for the inter-war period are not kept at The National Archives. Write to the relevant Medal Offices at the addresses given in section 7 below.\n\n4.4 Second World War, 1939–1945, and later\n\nCampaign medal rolls for the Second World War are not kept at The National Archives. Write to the Armed Services Medal Office at the address given in section 7 below.\n\n5. How to find records of long service and good conduct medals\n\nThese medals were awarded to warrant officers, non-commissioned officers and other ranks. They were not dependent on having seen action.\n\n5.1 Army\n\nUse Discovery (£), our catalogue to browse record series WO 101 and WO 102 and to search WO 32, using ‘code 50’ as your keyword.\n\n5.2 Royal Navy and Royal Marines\n\nSee ADM 171, ADM 1 and ADM 201.\n\n5.3 RAF\n\nSearch the Air Ministry Orders in series AIR 72 for Long Sevice and Good Conduct Medal, George V.\n\n6. How to find records of commemorative medals\n\nFor recipients of the Jubilee Medal 1897; the Royal Victorian Medal 1901 (for taking part in Queen Victoria’s funeral); the Coronation Medals 1901 and 1911; and the Delhi Durbar Medals 1903 and 1911, see WO 100, WO 330 and ADM 171.\n\nRolls for the 1935 Jubilee are in QLIB 4 and for the 1937 Coronation in QLIB 5.\n\nThe 1953 Coronation and 1977 Jubilee rolls are available in The National Archives’ Library.\n\nMedals have been awarded for service in the Arctic between 1818 and 1855 and 1875 and 1876. Service between these dates included the search for the North West Passage and the searches for Sir John Franklin. The Polar Medal was introduced for Arctic and Antarctic exploration from 1904.\n\nThe National Archives’ Library has a copy of The Polar Medal Roll (1902-1999), which includes alphabetical and chronological lists of awards, with National Archives references to the main sources in ADM 1, ADM 171 and the London Gazette (online and in ZJ 1).\n\n7. Replacing and claiming medals\n\nRefer to the Ministry of Defence Medal Office for details of medals and eligibility.\n\n8.
