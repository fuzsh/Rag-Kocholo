        "text": "PHOTO INFORMATION\n\nGold Star Mothers\n\nPHOTO INFORMATION\n\nStaff Sgt. Clayton Bowen\n\nGold Star Mothers remember loved ones\n\nBy Staff Sgt. Corey Baltos ARNORTH Public Affairs\n\nOur nation has powerful words for when one loses a loved one, such as \"widow\" and \"orphan.\"\n\nAlthough accurate, how do people refer to parents who go through the tumultuous emotions involved when they lose a child during war? For the Army, they are recognized as Gold Star Mothers and Families.\n\nDebbie Agnew and Reesa Doebbler are both Gold Star Mothers. Both said they remember the day when military men in uniform informed them that their sons had been killed in action in Afghanistan.\n\nLosing a child is a tragedy - and it's the mission of the Army's Survivor Outreach Services to help the Gold Star Mothers and Families through the difficult process.\n\nBoth women said participating in the Alamo Area Gold Star Mothers Group also helped immeasurably.\n\nFor Agnew, now a retired elementary school teacher, that day was Feb. 13, 2006. The time was 2 p. m.\n\n\"I was in the classroom teaching third grade in Pleasanton, Texas, when the assistant principal came into my classroom and asked me to come to the office,\" said Agnew, adding that she initially thought it was to discuss an incident that happened in her class the week before.\n\n\"I thought I was going to meet with an irate parent,\" she said.\n\nAs the two women were walking down the hall, the assistant principal told Agnew that there were two men waiting to speak to her.\n\nAgnew stopped and said, \"It's Clint, isn't it? He is dead.\" Clint was Staff Sgt. Clinton Newman, Agnew's 26-year-old son.\n\nA member of the 321st Civil Affairs Brigade at Joint Base San Antonio-Fort Sam Houston, Newman died Feb. 13, 2006, when a makeshift bomb detonated by his Humvee near Deh Rawod, Afghanistan. He was nine months into a 12-month tour.\n\n\"I didn't want Clint to join the Army,\" Agnew said. \"I wanted him to go to college.\"\n\nBut the 17-year-old knew there was no money for college, so he decided to join for a few years to get the Post-9/11 GI-Bill.\n\n\"He joined the infantry and was sent to Germany,\" Agnew said. \"He was only going to do a two-year enlistment and then go to college, but he fell in love with the Army.\"\n\nAfter his enlistment was up, Newman returned home to San Antonio with a girlfriend. Not wanting to give up the military completely, he joined the 321st Civil Affairs Brigade.\n\n\"Clint met Julia while stationed in Germany,\" Agnew said. \"He would have liked to stay on active duty, but Julia wanted to go to college in San Antonio, so he came home. He didn't want to join the National Guard and couldn't find a Reserve infantry unit in San Antonio, so he switched to civil affairs.\n\n\"Clint liked being in civil affairs,\" Agnew said. \"He got along well with the Afghan people. He was diplomatic enough to be around them and they loved him. Whenever their convoy would arrive in the village, the Afghans would ask, 'Where is Sgt. Clint?'\"\n\nWhat Agnew remembers most about her son was his modesty and compassion.\n\n\"He was named the Army Reserve Soldier of the Year in 2000,\" Agnew said. \"But he didn't brag about it. His fellow Soldiers didn't even know until they looked through his records and asked him how a specialist had been awarded the Meritorious Service Medal.\n\n\"He was an easy kid. He was smart, made good grades, and always did his work,\" Agnew said. \"He always wanted to help people. That's one of the reasons he joined the Army.\"\n\nFor Doebbler, it was 10 p.m. on Aug. 18, 2009, when she got the \"knock\" that changed her life.\n\n\"Instead of a knock on the door, I got a knock on the gate,\" Doebbler said.\n\n\"We lived on five acres, and I saw a car sitting outside my front gate. My husband went out to see what they wanted, so he was told first.\n\n\"He came back to the house and told me to put my robe on. It was then I knew what had happened. My life changed forever that night.\"\n\nLike Newman, Staff Sgt. Clayton Bowen also joined the Army at 17.\n\nThe 12-year Army veteran served as a drill sergeant and a shooting instructor before deploying to Afghanistan in February 2009 with the 1st Battalion, 501st Parachute Infantry Regiment, 4th Brigade Combat Team (Airborne), 25th Infantry Division.\n\nBowen was riding in a Humvee with four fellow \"Spartan Brigade\" Soldiers, on his way to provide security for Afghanistan's presidential election, when the vehicle hit an IED.\n\nDoebbler had spoken to her son the night before, as he prepared to go on the mission.\n\n\"Clay called me around midnight to tell me I wouldn't hear from him for a few days,\" she said. As she later learned, \"the mission was to travel to the voting precincts so the Afghans could vote in the presidential election.\"\n\nBowen joined the Army after high school, and after infantry basic and advanced individual training, he was sent to the 82nd Airborne Division.\n\n\"Clay wanted to 'be all you can be,'\" Doebbler said. \"He loved jumping out of perfectly good airplanes.\"\n\nDoebbler knew her son would go far in the Army when, at his graduation from basic, he was the Soldier leading his platoon and carrying the guidon.\n\n\"His drill sergeants voted for him to lead the platoon, because he had earned it,\" she said.\n\nBowen was also a very good singer.\n\n\"He was asked to try out for the 82nd Airborne All-American Chorus,\" Doebbler said. \"He passed the audition. I got to see him perform two or three times a year when the group came to San Antonio.\"\n\nAfter leaving the 82nd, Bowen became a drill sergeant and then a drill sergeant instructor.\n\n\"A book about how to survive basic combat training was written and Clay was selected as the role model - he's on the front and back covers.\"\n\nIn December 2008, Bowen got orders for the 501st Infantry Regiment, based out of Fort Richardson, Alaska. The group deployed to Afghanistan three months later.\n\n\"He was a mortar platoon sergeant,\" Doebbler said. \"He and about 100 other Soldiers were sent to an outpost in the middle of Paktika Province.\"\n\nWhile in Afghanistan, Clay asked his parents to send him tools and other things to make their lives more bearable.\n\n\"I called the campaign 'Tools for Troops,'\" Doebbler said. \"We sent him supplies to make his and his Soldiers lives better.\"\n\nHis parents put an article in their newspaper, Construction News, asking for donations. Donations poured in, including cordless power tools, two big-screen TVs and gaming systems.\n\n\"Clay loved the military,\" Doebbler said. \"He was proud of what he was doing. His goal was to be a command sergeant major.\"\n\nWithin 24 hours of being notified of their son's deaths, both women were visited by casualty assistance officers. The CAOs were Soldiers that would spend the next several weeks assisting the family with everything they needed, from helping them get ready for the funeral, to inventorying their personal possessions to making sure the survivors got all their benefits.\n\n\"First Sgt. Lionel Schneegans did a great job,\" Agnew said. \"He was with us every day until the end of May.\" Schneegans was the rear-detachment first sergeant in Newman's unit.\n\nDoebbler also was very happy with the quality of support she got from her CAO.\n\n\"My casualty officer, Capt. Kelly Wilhelm, came here the next morning,\" she said. \"He was absolutely wonderful and took care of everything; he really helped out when I couldn't think.\"\n\nWilhelm was assigned to Brooke Army Medical Center at the time he served as a CAO.\n\nLike many mothers who lose a child, Agnew went through several stages of grief.\n\n\"In the beginning it was minute by minute,\" she said. \"I sometimes felt like I was hanging by my finger nails.\"\n\nTalking about her feelings and being around others who had lost a loved one helped Agnew work through the pain.\n\n\"About six weeks after Clint's death, I started attending a grief support group here in Pleasanton,\" Agnew said. \"They helped me get through the pain. If I wanted to talk, they let me talk. If I wanted to cry, they let me cry.\"\n\nIn late May 2006, while Agnew and her husband were visiting Fort Bragg to attend a memorial service for Newman and other civil affairs Soldiers killed that year, a military chaplain told the family members that the reason the Army has so many memorial services for the fallen is because it helps the survivors deal with the reality of the situation and begin the healing process.\n\nThe organization that helped Agnew work through her grief the most was the Alamo Area Gold Star Mothers group.\n\n\"It is all women. We all lost a child in war,\" Agnew said. \"We understand each other.\"\n\nAs part of the Gold Star Mothers group, Agnew also helps teach the JBSA-Fort Sam Houston CNO/CAO class and served at Survivor Outreach Services. Doebbler has also found healing through the Alamo Area Gold Star Mothers group.\n\n\"It has been wonderful,\" said Doebbler, who also serves as the secretary for the group. \"They are the only people I can be around who know exactly where I am coming from. It is good to have others around; we all help each other and have good times together too.\"\n\nThe best thing to help in the healing process is to find people you can talk to.\n\n\"I know what it is like in the beginning,\" Doebbler said. \"At first you get bombarded, you can't keep things straight, you are afraid to go out because you can see something that will break you down.\n\n\"I started going to TAPS (Tragedy Assistance Program for Survivors) at six months and also started seeing a grief counselor,\" she said. \"The earlier you get assistance, the better you heal. It is difficult to convince a mother of this, but they will show up and be glad they did.\"\n\nJBSA-Fort Sam Houston will honor Gold Star Mothers and Families Sept. 29, conducting a ribbon-cutting ceremony for the new Survivor Outreach Center."
