        "text": "Just went a few rounds with Star Soldier R, Hudson's version of the classic space shooter franchise that launched today with WiiWare.\n\nStar Soldier R isn't a traditional entry in the series. Rather, it's a smallish game based around racking up high scores in small periods of time. In the two-minute mode, you'll play through one brief stage and try to shoot down as many enemies and collect as many items as you can for a big score. The five-minute mode is similar, but features two levels with two boss encounters at the end of each.\n\nIn the screenshot above, you can see that the levels are dotted with things that you can blow up. The glowy yellow ones release chips that add to your score, and the glowy other-colored ones release weapon upgrades. Keep adding weapons to your ship and you'll soon be shooting more bullets and in more directions -- crucial for racking up bigger combos.\n\nWhen you begin the game, you'll first select the area of Japan in which you live. This way, you can upload your scores to Wi-Fi Connection and see how you rank in the leaderboards among others in Japan, across the whole world, or just in your area. (I don't mean to brag, but I am currently the 12th best Star Soldier R player in all of Hokkaido.)\n\nYou can play using the nunchuk or Classic controller, but why bother when you can just turn the Wiimote on its side instead?\n\nThe graphics are really pretty, the 80's-style soundtrack is rocking, and the action feels awesome. But at 800 points or $8, I don't know if Star Soldier R is worth it for anyone who isn't a hardcore competitive shooter player. It's the sort of thing you'd play at a competition, not the kind of thing you'd spend money for at home. I can see it getting very old very fast for casual players, as there are only the two stages.\n\nWell, there's one more mode.\n\n\"Fast Shot\" mode times your button presses. For 13 seconds, you wail on the A button for as long as you possibly can, and the game tells you how many hits per second you managed. I put my best Mario Party index finger tapping skills to the test and got an 8.9, and nearly hurt myself.\n\nHudson's Takahashi-Meijin? Well, he can do 16.\n\nImage courtesy Nintendo\n\nThe 30 Best Shows on Apple TV+ Right Now\n\nSunny, Constellation, and Bad Monkey are among the best shows on Apple TV+ this month.\n\nBlack Myth: Wukong Devs Told Streamers to Avoid Politics in Their Playthroughs. It Backfired\n\nThe Chinese studio granted early access on the condition that topics like “feminist propaganda” and “Covid-19” go unmentioned. What followed is the Streisand effect in full force.\n\nThe 21 Best Movies on Apple TV+ Right Now\n\nFancy Dance, The Velvet Underground, and The World’s a Little Blurry are just a few of the movies you should be watching on Apple TV+ this month.\n\nThe 36 Best Shows on Amazon Prime Right Now\n\nThe Boys, Batman: Caped Crusader, and Fallout are just a few of the shows you should be watching on Amazon Prime Video this week.\n\nThe 30 Best Movies on Max (aka HBO Max) Right Now\n\nLove Lies Bleeding, Dune: Part Two, and Beetlejuice are just a few of the movies you should be watching on Max this month.\n\nThe 40 Best Shows on Max (aka HBO Max) Right Now\n\nHouse of the Dragon, The Sopranos, and Industry are just a few of the shows you need to be watching on Max this month.\n\nThe 51 Best Movies on Netflix Right Now\n\nWicked Little Letters, Lumberjack the Monster, and Godzilla Minus One are just a few of the movies you should watch on Netflix this month.\n\nThe 55 Best Shows on Netflix Right Now\n\nThe Boyfriend, The Decameron, and Kleo are just a few of the shows you need to watch on Netflix this month."
