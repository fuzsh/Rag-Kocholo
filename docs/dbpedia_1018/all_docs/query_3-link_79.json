Gamers will have one month to vie for the high score in Star Soldier R’s “5-Minute Mode” where the top players on the ranking leaderboards have the chance to win prizes. Two rounds of tournament prizes will be awarded based on players' scores. To sign up, players must register on the tournament registration page, located at ( http://hudsonentertainment.com/tournament_register.php?tournament_id=2).\n\nThe first place winners will receive Hudson's Top 5 Wii Games along with 16,000 Wii Points™, 10th place winners will receive 10,000 Wii Points, and the players in 16th place will win 4,000 Wii Points. For the sweepstakes, 10 users will be picked in one random drawing to win prizes. For more information about the contests please visit the registration page.\n\nPublished by Hudson Entertainment, Star Soldier R is a 2-level game that features a tournament-style approach in its gameplay which challenges players to achieve a high score with either a 2-Minute or 5-Minute Mode. Each mode offers quick and exciting gameplay and gives players just enough time to play through each mode. The 2-Minute Mode features one stage where gamers have 2 minutes to battle through one action-packed level while fighting against one giant boss. In the 5-Minute Mode, players have five minutes to work their way through to fight and defeat another boss through a second level. Though both modes are time-limited, the added competitive and replay value for players comes after they earn their scores, which they can post to the in-game leaderboards and then check out how they compare with other players in the region, nation, or even the world. The goal is for players to replay the game over and over again to beat their high score, improve their ranking, and discover different strategies in order to earn bonus points in the 2-Minute and 5-Minute Modes. If they can collect them all, they might have the honor of boasting the top score in the world!\n\nThe Entertainment Software Rating Board has rated Star Soldier R E for Everybody, Fantasy Violence.\n\nFor the latest info and artwork, please visit: http://press.hudsonent.com/\n\n###\n\nAbout Hudson Entertainment, Inc.\n\nHudson Entertainment is the North American publishing arm of Hudson Soft, an international provider of games and entertainment content founded in 1973.
