Star Soldier R [Edit] [Talk]

Star Soldier R is a WiiWare launch title and the seventh installment in Hudson's Star Soldier series. It combines the classic shooter gameplay with 3D graphics.

Gameplay[]

The game retains the vertical scrolling nature of the previous entries. The player can choose the ship among 3 different speeds and score bonuses for 50 and 80 thousand points. However, the main game consists of time attack challenges in Caravan mode in two or five minute sessions. There is also only two levels. There is also a side mode called Fast Shot to see how fast the player can press the shoot button.

The power-up system is divided between two types; the Red and the Blue. Red enhance the player's offensive ability upgrading to a five spread shot. Blue enhances the shield protecting the ship which can be upgraded to separate and attack enemies.
