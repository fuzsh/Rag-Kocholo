        "text": "Barbara Rush, the Golden Globe-winning actress known for her work on Peyton's Place and in Magnificent Obsession, has died. She was 97.\n\nRush's daughter, Claudia Cowan, confirmed that her mother died on Sunday evening.\n\n\"My wonderful mother passed away peacefully at 5:28 this evening,\" the Fox News correspondent confirmed to Fox News Digital. \"I was with her this morning and know she was waiting for me to return home safely to transition. It's fitting she chose to leave on Easter as it was one of her favorite holidays and now, of course, Easter will have a deeper significance for me and my family.\"\n\nNo cause of death was shared.\n\nRush was known for her work in film and television, and acted alongside some of Hollywood's most classic stars, including Frank Sinatra, Rock Hudson, and Jane Wyman. At the start of her career in the 1950's, Rush starred in big studio productions such as Bigger Than Life, The Young Philadelphians, and The Young Lions.\n\nIn 1954, Rush received the Golden Globe for her performance in It Came From Outer Space.\n\nRush's career continued to blossom in the 1960s, when she starred for 75 episodes on the daytime soap opera, Peyton's Place, as Marsha Russell. In 1992, she made her return to the world of soap operas with her role as Nora Orsini on All My Children.\n\nRush's other TV credits include 7th Heaven -- on which she starred as Ruth Camden -- as well as Fantasy Island, Magnum P.I., and more.\n\nRush was first wed actor Jeffrey Hunter (1950-1955), with whom she welcomed her firstborn son, Christopher. She was later married to famed publicist Warren Cowan (1959-1969), and gave birth to her daughter, Claudia. Her third and final marriage was to actor and sculptor James Gruzalski (1970-1973).\n\nRush is survived by her two children.\n\nRELATED CONTENT:\n\nLouis Gossett Jr., 'An Officer and a Gentleman' Star, Dead at 87\n\nM.
