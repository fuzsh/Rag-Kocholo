        "text": "Funeral services were pending Monday for Golden Globe-winning actress Barbara Rush, who appeared on the big screen opposite Hollywood luminaries including Paul Newman, Marlon Brando and Frank Sinatra then starred on TV shows including “All My Children” and “7th Heaven.”\n\nRush died Sunday at age 97, according to her daughter, Fox News correspondent Claudia Cowan. Cowan wrote on Instagram that her mother “was called to heaven on Easter of all days — a nod to the transition and resilience and joy we celebrate on this happy holiday — and I know she will stay alive in our hearts through cherished memories and movie reruns.”\n\n“She was elegant and (a) classic actress and the best mom in the world. Among the last of Old Hollywood Royalty. I will always be your biggest fan,” she wrote.\n\nRush won a Golden Globe in 1954 as most promising female newcomer following her performance in “It Came from Outer Space.” She appeared opposite James Mason in “Bigger Than Life,” and alongside Brando and Dean Martin in “The Young Lions.” She shared the screen with Sinatra in “Come Blow Your Horn” and “Robin and the 7 Hoods.”\n\nShe later transitioned to primarily television roles, with regular roles in “Peyton Place,” “All My Children,” “7th Heaven” and “The Bionic Woman.”\n\nRush was married three times — to actor Jeffrey Hunter, publicist Warren Cowan and sculptor Jim Gruzalski. She had two children, Cowan and son Christopher Hunter."
