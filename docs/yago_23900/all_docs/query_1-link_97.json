        "text": "\"I can't forget the loneliness when I was looking for someone like Dusty,\" Jeff <strong>Hunter</strong> says <strong>to</strong>day. \"Or how awful it was when I thought we were being <strong>to</strong>rn apart from one another.\" Watching the family <strong>to</strong>gether—Dusty, one-year-old Scott, Jeff, four-year-old Todd and ten-year-old Steele—it's hard <strong>to</strong> believe that all this happiness came so close <strong>to</strong> not happening. Mr. and Mrs. Jeff <strong>Hunter</strong> <strong>THE</strong> <strong>MARRIAGE</strong> <strong>THAT</strong> <strong>ALMOST</strong> <strong>WASN'T</strong> The star of \"Temple Hous<strong>to</strong>n\" treasures his happy matrimonial ending more than most men—perhaps because he still remembers how close he came <strong>to</strong> not even having a beginning! \"We'd dated for a year and had talked all around marriage,\" he recalls. \"Then, when it was almost time for me <strong>to</strong> go <strong>to</strong> London for a movie, Dusty asked me outright what my intentions were. \"Well, that caused a big quarrel. I got scared and <strong>to</strong>ld her it was all off between us. I <strong>to</strong>ok a quick trip <strong>to</strong> Mexico for a week by myself—and I did a lot of thinking.

But their two personalities were <strong>to</strong>o strong, their two careers <strong>to</strong>o competitive, their separations <strong>to</strong>o long and <strong>to</strong>o frequent. Finally, Barbara finished a film in Ireland and flew <strong>to</strong> where Jeff was working. She <strong>to</strong>ld him she wanted a divorce. It was a severe jolt. Yet when Jeff was cast in a picture with her, a year after their split was legally final, he felt no resentment. He'd remained a devoted father <strong>to</strong> their son Chris<strong>to</strong>pher, and he had learned he just had <strong>to</strong> wait for his true mate. Meanwhile, Dusty had faced a defeat in love, <strong>to</strong>o.
