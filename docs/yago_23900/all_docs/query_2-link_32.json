I was with her this morning and know she was waiting for me to return home safely to transition.”\n\nShe added, “It’s fitting she chose to leave on Easter as it was one of her favorite holidays and now, of course, Easter will have a deeper significance for me and my family.”\n\nEven though the actress has passed away, Hollywood will forever remember her contributions. Let’s take a look at the lavish life she lived during the epitome of her career.\n\nKey Takeaways\n\nBarbara Rush earned a significant sum from her movies.\n\nRush owned a property in Beverly Hills.\n\nBarbara Never Lacked Movie Offers And Earned Fortunes\n\nBarbara started her acting career in the university’s theatre and later started performing at the Lobero Theatre and the Pasadena Playhouse.\n\nShe made her screen debut in The Goldbergs in 1950 and starred in the classic Sci-fi film When Worlds Collide.\n\nRush earned nationwide recognition after winning the Golden Globe Award for “Most Promising Newcomer—Female” for her performance in It Came from Outer Space.\n\nFollowing this, her demand in Hollywood skyrocketed as she worked on numerous projects, one after another.\n\nAs she started working in different, starring opposite top actors, her earnings also saw an exponential rise.\n\nIn the 1964 drama Peyton Place, Barbara, who played Marsha Russell, was reportedly charged $1000 per episode.\n\nBarbara amassed a substantial sum from her acting career, which was evident from her ability to afford three lavish marriages.\n\nHer second marriage with PR kingpin Cowan took place at the Beverly Hills home of Tony Curtis and Janet Leigh, which must have cost them a substantial sum.\n\nBesides, Barbara Rush reportedly had a net worth of around $60 million when she passed away at 97.\n\nRush Owned A House In Beverly Hills\n\nThe late actress owned a mansion in the Benedict Canyon section of Beverly Hills, California.\n\nThe property consisted of a three-story French-Italian Renaissance home, swimming pool, and extensive garden, and was named Greenacres by its former owner, Harold Lloyd.\n\nLater, following Lloyd’s passing, an Iranian businessman purchased the mansion for $1.6 million and divided it into approximately 15 lots.\n\nThe home, preserved on a smaller 5-acre, had two other owners before Barbara Rush occupied it. The mansion was estimated to be worth $50-$60 million.\n\nHowever, for her final days, Barbara lived at a memory care center in West Village, California.\n\nFAQs\n\nWhat Health Issue Did Barbara Rush Have?\n\nBarbara Rush had been battling dementia for an extended period until her passing on March 31, 2024."
