        "text": "<strong>JEFFREY</strong> <strong>HUNTER</strong> <strong>HOLLYWOOD'S</strong> <strong>MOST</strong> <strong>HANDSOME</strong> <strong>ALL</strong>-ROUND ACTOR By Gregor Hauser In the year 1925 many future Hollywood stars were born: Paul Newman, Rock Hudson, Tony Curtis, Jack Lemmon and Jeffrey Hunter. Even though Jeff probably was as talented as Jack, better looking than Rock, with brighter blue eyes than Paul's, got his first leading role earlier than Tony and had the best qualifications of all, he remained by far the most unknown and most undervalued actor of the five. The following strives to substantiate how unfair that is. Jeffrey, born on November 25, was the son of a well off engineer. It was customary in the family to carry over the name of the father to the son. So the offspring also was christened Henry Herman McKinnies (Jr). The family moved four years after his birth from New Orleans to Milwaukee, Wisconsin, a big city near Chicago. Ever since his schooldays Henry took an interest in Theatre and Radio and engaged in both fields during the summer months. Henry must have been a committed and popular student, because he was chosen as class spokesman and later as head boy. Moreover, he was a talented football player and co-captain of his team. After he finished Highschool he was pulled out of this intimate environment when he was inducted. There is nothing known of Jeffrey's war experiences, except that he joined the Navy in 1945 and was discharged in 1946. With a scholarship in his pocket he resumed his studies and graduated from the Northwestern University in Illinois. Shortly after he enrolled at the University of Los Angeles. At both Universities he indulged his hobby: acting. While in a Fraternity production of 'Julius Caesar', interestingly enough he met Charlton Heston - two years his senior. Hollywood-reality in the early stages of the 50s: look good, be interested in acting, hang out in the vicinity of Hollywood - and the movie contract is yours. Sounds tacky but is a fact. Henry was courted by Paramount but went under contract with 20th Century Fox. In contrast to training at Universal, where it took years to build gently the potential young talent. Fox didn't have any special training programme for coming young actors. They fit him with a more melodious sounding name and in no time Jeffrey Hunter was big business. In his first active year, 1951, with rapid strides he appeared in four productions and was from the very beginning a favorite of the young female audience who sent sacks full of fanmail to the Studio. That was also the case with the popular movie magazines that saw in Hunter from the very outset a newly favored star. Well bred, intelligent, a clean image with dark, parted hair, the blue eyes and the 6' tall, slender figure, he became instantly the idol for both, teens and their mothers. Immediately after his arrival in Hollywood, he met the enchanting Barbara Rush, whom he married right away in 1950. Barbara was two years younger than Jeffrey and made her debut in the year other marriage, a small part in 'Molly' (The Goldbergs). Unfortunately, the couple never appeared together in a film until after they were divorced, because Barbara had a contract with another Studio, Universal. Jeffrey Hunter's debut on screen was 'Call me Mister', a well performed and -directed musical, in which Hunter is listed 7th in the credits as \"The Kid'. Nevertheless, his next movie made substantially more headlines. 'Fourteen Hours' is a thriller by Henry Hathaway, showing various events around the true story of a young man who wants to throw himself from a multistory building. Jeffrey and Debra Paget play a young couple, who meet amidst the mass of onlookers. Not only is it the first time that Jeff is presented to the audience as a juvenile lead, it is also his first meeting with Debra, with whom he got teamed up five times until 1955. By the way, 'Fourteen Hours' made history as Grace Kelly's screen-debut. His next appearance marks also the beginning of a partnership. In 'Frogmen' he not only meets the big star of the Studio, Richard Widmark, but also Robert Wagner, who - besides being Jeffrey's healthy competition within Fox - also has several joint appearances with him (seven in total). It is remarkable that this is their only movie in which Jeffs name comes before"
