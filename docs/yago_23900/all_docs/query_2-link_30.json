        "text": "biography\n\nBorn on January 4, 1927, in Denver, Colorado, beautiful Barbara Rush was a natural for films. Upon finishing high school, Rush enrolled at the University of California and later honed her craft at the Pasadena Playhouse. Spotted by a talent agent while appearing in a play, she signed with Paramount in 1950. The studio's first assignment for the pretty young actress was a role in the comedy The Goldbergs (1950; with Gertrude Berg). A few months before the release of the film, Rush met the handsome young actor Jeffrey Hunter, whom she married in December 1950. Marriage didn't slow Rush's career, as she was soon cast in a starring role in Paramount's science fiction thriller When Worlds Collide (1951; with Richard Derr). After the birth of her son Christopher in 1952, Rush left Paramount and signed with Universal-International. This studio also cast the actress in a cult-classic science fiction film, It Came from Outer Space (1953; with Richard Carlson). After a couple of years at Universal, Rush moved on to bigger and better roles. At the same time, her marriage to Jeffrey Hunter collapsed, ending with the couple's divorce in 1955.\n\nLEFT: Barbara Rush with first husband Jeffrey Hunter in the early 1950s. RIGHT: Rush holds a photo of Gregg Palmer in this early 1950s Universal still\n\nIn the late 1950s, Rush remarried, and along with the change, transitioned to A pictures, including The Young Philadelphians (1959; with Paul Newman and Alexis Smith), Strangers When We Meet (1960; with Kirk Douglas and Kim Novak), and Robin and the 7 Hoods (1964; with Frank Sinatra and Dean Martin). Into the 1960s and 1970s, Rush began doing a lot of guest appearances on television series, including Ben Casey and The Outer Limits, and acted in several made-for-television movies such as the crime drama Cutter (1972; with Cameron Mitchell), the horror feature Moon of the Wolf (1972; with David Janssen and Bradford Dillman), and the crime thriller The Eyes of Charles Sand (1972; with Peter Haskell and Joan Bennett). And she made a return to theaters in the musical Can't Stop the Music (1980; with Valerie Perrine).\n\nfilmography\n\nFILM\n\nWidow's Kiss (1996) with Beverly D'Angelo, Mackenzie Astin, and Bruce Davison\n\nWeb of Deceit (1991) with Linda Purl\n\nSummer Lovers (1982) with Peter Gallagher, Daryl Hannah, and Carole Cook\n\nThe Night the Bridge Fell Down (1980) with Desi Arnaz Jr., James MacArthur, Leslie Nielsen, Larry Pennell, Eve Plumb, Francine York, and Gregory Sierra\n\nCan't Stop the Music (1980) with the Village People, Valerie Perrine, Bruce Jenner, Steve Guttenberg, Paul Sand, Tammy Grimes, June Havoc, and Altovise Davis\n\nFlamingo Road (1980) with Mason Adams, John Beck, Howard Duff, Morgan Fairchild, Mark Harmon, Kevin McCarthy, Melba Moore, and Stella Stevens\n\nThe Seekers (1979) with Hugh O'Brian, Robert Reed, Martin Milner, Stuart Whitman, and John Carradine\n\nDeath Car on the Freeway (1979) with Shelley Hack, Peter Graves, Dinah Shore, George Hamilton, Frank Gorshin, Sid Haig, and Harriet Nelson\n\nThe Last Day (1975) with Richard Widmark, Robert Conrad, Tim Matheson, Tom Skerritt, and Loretta Swit\n\nSuperdad (1974) with Bob Crane, Kurt Russell, Ed Begley Jr., and Dick Van Patten\n\nCrime Club (1973) with Lloyd Bridges, Victor Buono, Paul Burke, William Devane, Cloris Leachman, and Martin Sheen\n\nMoon of the Wolf (1972) with David Janssen, Bradford Dillman, John Beradino, and Geoffrey Lewis\n\nThe Man (1972) with James Earl Jones, Martin Balsam, Burgess Meredith, Lew Ayres, and William Windom\n\nThe Eyes of Charles Sand (1972) with Peter Haskell, Joan Bennett, Bradford Dillman, Adam West, Gary Clarke, and Don 'Red' Barry\n\nCutter (1972)\n\nSuddenly Single (1971) with Hal Holbrook, Margot Kidder, Agnes Moorehead, Michael Constantine, Harvey Korman, and Cloris Leachman\n\nStrategy of Terror (1969) with Hugh O'Brian and Neil Hamilton\n\nHombre (1967) with Paul Newman, Fredric March, Richard Boone, Cameron Mitchell, Martin Balsam, and David Canary\n\nThe Unknown (1964) with Cedric Hardwicke, David McCallum, and Vera Miles\n\nRobin and the 7 Hoods (1964) with Frank Sinatra, Dean Martin, Sammy Davis Jr., Bing Crosby, Peter Falk, and Victor Buono\n\nCome Blow Your Horn (1963) with Frank Sinatra, Lee J.
