        "text": "Jeffrey Hunter and Barbara Rush at a 1954 movie premiereĭid the studio have any issues with you two dating? I think he was at Fox when you were at Paramount, right? I thought a lot more than that! (Laughs.) It was more like “Wow!” And “Look at those blue eyes!” So I invited him to the Studio Club for dinner and the lady who was in charge got us tickets to a show, I think it was at the Shrine. He was doing a screen test on the lot and I happened to run into him.Īnd you thought, “Oh, look at that handsome young actor, he’s cute?” We had a very pretty dining room and you could invite a male guest which I used to do a lot because I had just met (first husband) Jeffrey Hunter. I had such a wonderful time at the Studio Club. Renata was just great but her parents made her quit, I wonder whatever happened to her. We had a little stage at the Studio Club and people would get up and perform, it was really fun. Yes, very much so! I remember being close this wonderful girl named Renata that was being trained by the famous opera singer Lotte Lehman. It was really fun, like being in a sorority! There were so many great people there, I remember being good friends with Peggy Dow, remember her? And Marilyn Monroe was there for a while. But when I started at Paramount they moved me over to the Studio Club with a bunch of other actresses which was just wonderful. I was probably making about $15 a week at the Pasadena Playhouse so it was a good living arrangement where I not only didn’t have to pay rent, they paid me a little bit. The father was a doctor and I think the mother was part of the Gamble family which was pretty famous in Pasadena. Well, I moved! I had been living with this couple in Pasadena and taking care of their child. I was just happy whenever it seemed that I knew what I was doing!ĭid being under contract immediately change your life in a big way?\n\nI never thought too much about my appearance, to be honest. You never had issues with the way you looked on screen? Of course you were always so gorgeous, why would you? I know some actors don’t like to see themselves in that way but I always found it helpful. I remember Laurence Olivier came to talk to us once at Paramount and he told us it was very important for actors to watch the rushes to see what you liked and what you didn’t like. I really don’t, but I used to go to the rushes whenever I got the chance. Right, Debby, the shiksa girlfriend, I love that movie! Do you remember the first time you saw yourself up on the big screen? They put me right away into the movie version of the long-running radio and TV show The Goldbergs which starred Gertrude Berg. How long between signing the contract and getting your first film? So I did the test and, to my utter surprise, they liked it and put me under contract. Were you reluctant in any way to do that? Did you have your heart set on working in the theater?Īre you kidding, Danny? I said, “I get to go to Paramount? Thank you! What time should I be there?” (Laughs.) I honestly couldn’t believe they were interested in me. Movie scouts used to come to see us from time to time and one day one of these people approached me and asked me if I wanted to do a screen test at Paramount. We’d do different scenes and it was fun because I got to do all of the women’s parts. I was just happy to have a job! I was working at the Pasadena Playhouse with a bunch of former GIs after the war. Well, you are one, whether you like it or not!\n\nI’m just a movie actress, sweetheart, I’ve never even had a passing thought that I’m a star! We’ve talked about your films and co-stars a lot, but today I just wanted to chat for a bit about what it was like being a “star” back when you first made a splash in Hollywood.Ī star? Oh goodness, I don’t think I’ve ever used that word in my life. She had appeared in ‘Harry Black’ a feature on which I did recently Danny Miller with Barbara Rush at the TCM Classic Film Festival (Photo: Bob Vodick)īarbara Rush: Oh, thank you, Danny!
