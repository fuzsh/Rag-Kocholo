        "text": "Barbara Rush, the veteran Hollywood performer best remembered for her part in 1953's iconic sci-fi film It Came from Outer Space, died at the age of 97.\n\nHer daughter, Claudia Cowan, confirmed her death on Sunday, March 31st, as reported by Fox News, stating, \"My wonderful mother passed away peacefully at 5:28 this evening. I was with her this morning and knew she was waiting for me to return home safely to transition.\"\n\nShe said, \"It's fitting she chose to leave on Easter as it was one of her favorite holidays, and now, of course, Easter will have a deeper significance for me and my family.\"\n\nRush made her film debut in The Goldbergs in 1950 and got the Golden Globe for Most Promising Female Newcomer for her performance in the film It Came from Outer Space.\n\nThroughout her career, Rush appeared in a variety of films, including Douglas Sirk's Magnificent Obsession (1954) and Robin and the Seven Hoods (1964), which starred Frank Sinatra, Dean Martin, Sammy Davis Jr., and Bing Crosby, among others.\n\nIn 1968, she played Nora Clavicle in the television film Batman.\n\nShe departed from 7th Heaven in 2007 after ten episodes and made one final cameo in the comic short Bleeding Hearts: The Arteries of Glenda Bryant, co-starring with her niece, Carolyn Hennesy.\n\nRush married three times, but all of them ended in divorce. She has two children: Christopher Hunter, whom she has with the late actor Jeffrey Hunter, and Claudia Cowan, whom she shares with publicist Warren Cowan."
