biography

Born on January 4, 1927, in Denver, Colorado, beautiful Barbara Rush was a natural for films. Upon finishing high school, Rush enrolled at the University of California and later honed her craft at the Pasadena Playhouse. Spotted by a talent agent while appearing in a play, she signed with Paramount in 1950. The studio's first assignment for the pretty young actress was a role in the comedy The Goldbergs (1950; with Gertrude Berg). A few months before the release of the film, Rush met the handsome young actor Jeffrey Hunter, whom she married in December 1950. Marriage didn't slow Rush's career, as she was soon cast in a starring role in Paramount's science fiction thriller When Worlds Collide (1951; with Richard Derr). After the birth of her son Christopher in 1952, Rush left Paramount and signed with Universal-International. This studio also cast the actress in a cult-classic science fiction film, It Came from Outer Space (1953; with Richard Carlson). After a couple of years at Universal, Rush moved on to bigger and better roles. At the same time, her marriage to Jeffrey Hunter collapsed, ending with the couple's divorce in 1955.

In the late 1950s, Rush remarried, and along with the change, transitioned to A pictures, including The Young Philadelphians (1959; with Paul Newman and Alexis Smith), Strangers When We Meet (1960; with Kirk Douglas and Kim Novak), and Robin and the 7 Hoods (1964; with Frank Sinatra and Dean Martin). Into the 1960s and 1970s, Rush began doing a lot of guest appearances on television series, including Ben Casey and The Outer Limits, and acted in several made-for-television movies such as the crime drama Cutter (1972; with Cameron Mitchell), the horror feature Moon of the Wolf (1972; with David Janssen and Bradford Dillman), and the crime thriller The Eyes of Charles Sand (1972; with Peter Haskell and Joan Bennett). And she made a return to theaters in the musical Can't Stop the Music (1980; with Valerie Perrine).
