        "text": "(1804–1873), physician, ethnographer, and writer. Born in 1804 in the Czech city of Přeštice (Prestitz), Leopold Weisel devoted much of his literary career to the recovery of the oral traditions of Bohemian Jews. The son of a traveling cloth merchant, Weisel—whose original name was Joachim Löbl Weisel—spent his youth in Přeštice before moving to Prague to further his education. He lived as a medical student in Prague’s Jewish Town (Cz., Židovské město; Ger., Judenstadt) and supported himself as a private tutor for a number of Jewish families. During the 1830s and 1840s Weisel devoted most of his literary efforts to the collection and dissemination of Jewish folk tales from Prague, a project in which he collaborated with the non-Jewish folklorist Franz Klutschak (1814–1886), publishing some of his earliest efforts alongside those of Klutschak in the journal Panorama des Universums. Weisel was openly conscious of his status as a Jew who was losing contact with the world of traditional Jewish culture and he devoted this part of his career to capturing and preserving the rich folk traditions of the ghetto, which he accomplished by interviewing older residents of the Jewish quarter and recording their stories.\n\nWeisel’s “Die Pinchasgasse: Eine jüdische Volkssage” appeared in Panorama des Universums in 1838. The story was reprinted, along with four other tales by Weisel, as “Sagen der Prager Juden” and included in the popular collection Sippurim: Eine Sammlung jüdischer Volkssagen, published in 1847 (and in numerous editions thereafter) by Wolf Pascheles. Other early works by Weisel include the short story “Meine erste Praxis” (My First Practice) in the journal Bohemia (1836); “Die Schnorrer oder jüdischen Bettler” (Schnorrer, or Jewish Peddlers; 1844); “Die Jeschiboth oder jüdischen Hochschulen” (Yeshivas, or Jewish University; 1845); and “Die Prager Juden, wie sie leben” (How Do the Prague Jews Live?; 1850), a longer work rich in descriptions of Jewish merchants, tradesmen, artists, and others.\n\nIn 1840 Weisel settled in the western Bohemian town of Všeruby (Neumark), where he worked as an obstetrician as well as a writer. It was in Všeruby that he met and married Ann Pavlovská, a Catholic woman, for whom he converted to Catholicism in 1843 (thereafter going by the name Georg Leopold Weisel). In light of Weisel’s conversion, it is interesting to note that his works often touch on the love between a Jew and a Christian. In the legend of Rabbi Amnon, a story from 1843, the main character puts a terrible curse on one such convert, and in “Friedhöfe” (Graveyards) and “Lusienheil” (Loisa’s Cure), the narrator disapproves of a mixed marriage. Weisel’s unpublished manuscripts include “Rabbi Jontev [Yom Tov] Purim,” the article “Suspicion,” and “Jajin Kidusch, oder die falsche Beschuldigung” (Yayin Kiddush, or False Accusation), written in 1858, which describes an accusation involving a ritual murder."
