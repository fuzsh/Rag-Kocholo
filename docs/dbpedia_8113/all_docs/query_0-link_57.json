        "text": "See Czech opera in the Prague National Theatre\n\nIn Czech, surtitles in Czech, English\n\nThe story of Zdeněk Fibich’s Šárka depicts the Maidens’ War, an uprising that broke out after the death of the mythical Princess Libuše, with the women striving to regain the privileges they enjoyed during her reign.\n\nThe legend can be found in a variety of literary sources, from Cosmas of Prague’s 12th–century Chronica Boemorum to Alois Jirásek’s ever-popular Old Czech Legends, first published in 1894. During the 19th-century National Revival, Bohemian mythology inspired a number of artists, influenced in part by the fake Manuscript of Dvůr Králové and Manuscript of Zelená Hora, motifs of which even appear in the decorations of Prague’s National Theatre. Besides Libuše and Šárka, the legend of the women’s uprising reflects in Smetana’s cycle My Country (the tone poems Vyšehrad and Šárka), as well as in Otakar Ostrčil’s opera The Death of Vlasta. Fibich evidently closely worked on Šárka with the librettist Anežka Schulzová, a pupil of the prominent Czech author Jaroslav Vrchlický, with their amorous relationship having had a positive impact on their endeavours.\n\nThe opera premiered on 28 December 1897 at the National Theatre in Prague, conducted by Adolf Čech. The production, directed by Adolf Krössing, featured scenery by Robert Holzer and Mikoláš Aleš, with the latter’s visual style becoming a traditional model for the costumes in the majority of the adaptations that followed. The first to portray Šárka was the outstanding 28-year-old soprano Růžena Maturová (also the first to perform Antonín Dvořák’s Rusalka).\n\nThe National Theatre's new production will be presented more than four decades after the most recent performance of Šárka at the National Theatre. It will be conducted by Robert Jindra, music director of the National Theatre Opera, who has invited the German stage director Kay Link.\n\nPerforming:\n\nNational Theatre Chorus\n\nNational Theatre Orchestra\n\nNational Theatre Opera Ballet\n\nSoloists\n\nImportant:\n\nThe purchased tickets cannot be returned or exchanged\n\nNo discounts are provided\n\nTheatre is a cultural institution. Please respect the common principles of appropriate behaviour and clothing\n\nThe program may be subject to change\n\nThe price includes service fee of 3,7 € (100,- CZK)\n\nConcerts in the Municipal House - Smetana Hall\n\nThe National Theatre is the most important and representative theatre of the Czech Republic\n\nThe Prague National Theatre was built from the desire of the Czech people for national independence. Its building was financed from the collections on which participated broad masses of people as well as important donators (including the nobility and the emperor himself). The theatre foundation ceremonial on 16th May 1868 became a national celebration.\n\nThe theatre was opened in 1881. In the same year the theatre burned down, and this tragic event caused a huge wave of new collections to support the restoration of the theatre. The Prague National Theatre was re-opened in 1883 by the opera Libuše by Bedřich Smetana and since then it has been serving as a place of Czech national identity and as a flagship of the Czech culture to these days.\n\nHow to get there:\n\nAccessibility by Prague public transport:\n\nmetro B (yellow line) - Národni třída station\n\ntram Nos. 2, 9, 17, 18, 22, 23 - Národní divadlo stop\n\nNearest car parking:\n\nThe underground car park of the National Theatre\n\nTICKETS WERE ADDED TO CART\n\nPlease have your credit card and personal information ready for payment to avoid expiration of the order time.\n\nYou have 10 minutes to finalize your order and proceed to payment.\n\nWhen this time runs out, your reservation is cancelled.\n\nIf you have selected a discounted ticket price (student / senior), you may be asked at the venue entrance to present your ID or any other document proving that you are entitled to obtain the discount."
