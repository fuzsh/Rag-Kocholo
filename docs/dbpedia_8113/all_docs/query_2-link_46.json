        "text": "Lommel, Arle. 2008. ‘The Hungarian Duda and Contra-Chanter Bagpipes of the Carpathian Basin.’ Galpin Society Journal 61:305–21. The Carpathian Basin region of Europe is a center of bagpipe diversity, with a group of instruments characterized by multiple chanter bores with at least one serving the function of a ‘kontra’, a variable drone that sounds the tonic or the dominant below the tonic. The paper argues that contra-chanter bagpipes are historically derived from parallel double-chanter bagpipes of the Balkans. It presents a typology of contra-chanter bagpipes, with further information on Hungarian types and discusses the playing technique, musical repertoire, traditional usage, and post-1970 revival.\n\nThe author describes the traditional music of Podhale, focusing primarily on its twentieth-century history. He also refers to the contemporary changes in this kind of music. The author shows both the relationship between music and identity, highlanders’ customs, as well as the influence of the music on the works of professional artists. Referring to the ethno-musicological methodology, on the examples of certain compositions, the author analyses types of musical forms from the Podhale region, their characteristics and styles. He compares the music of Podhale with the compositions of other ethnic groups. * * * Autor opisuje tradycyjną muzyke Podhala, skupiając sie przede wszystkim na jej dwudziestowiecznej historii. Odnosi sie takze do jej wspolczesnych przemian. Pokazuje zarowno relacje miedzy muzyką a tozsamością, zwyczajami Gorali, jak tez sygnalizuje wplywy tej muzyki na tworczośc artystow profesjonalnych. Odwolując sie do metodologii etnomuzykologicznej, na przykladzie konkretny...\n\nIn the case of the Podhale region (the Polish Tatra mountains) we have historical records describing the musical culture reaching the first half of the nineteenth century. This puts the ethnomusicologist in a convenient situation, allowing the reconstruction of historical processes of changing traditions. From the perspective of contemporary research it is interesting to trace the evolution of opinions about tradition expressed by the representatives of the Podhale communities as well as the intelligentsia visiting the region in crowds. This allows us to show how the opinions were formed and what their vision is for the continuation of tradition. Meanwhile, this tradition, located on the Polish-Slovak border (Orava, Spis, Liptov) and influenced by other social groups (intelligentsia, Jews, Gypsies), has undergone numerous changes in the past and nowadays. The person of Bartek Obrochta (1850-1926), the great musical innovator whose legend still forms the social vision of the Podhale musical tradition, will be the case study for discussing the issues described below."
