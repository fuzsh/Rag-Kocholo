        "text": "The people mourn the death of Pater Bohemus, who brought them to the land under the mountain Říp. They reminisce their flight from the fighting in their original homeland and their exhausting journey. In their new homeland, they cut down forests, cultivate fields, celebrate the harvest, hunt wild animals and fish. They live in fear of the powerful gods, especially the thundering Perun, to whom they offer sacrifices. But when lightning sets the village on fire, they must help themselves. They choose a name after their duke: The Bohemians. – The dead duke's body is burned. – After his death, Krok, who had Vyšehrad built and who had three daughters (Kazi, Teta and Libuše) takes over. Libuše is the one who becomes the ruler of the tribe after her father's death. – According to the blind elder man, a dangerous wild boar threatens the people near the castle. The strong man Bivoj encounters it when he goes into the forest in the snow. He brings him to the castle hall where there is a large gathering. Here he kills the wild boar in battle with a spear. The young man amazes Kazi and he is also attracted to her. – Libuše rules wisely. But during a dispute between the brothers, one of them confronts her. Vladyka complains that women can and does rule men. Alone in the sacred grove, Libuše sees the future. She sends three elders, whom the old man leads to Stadice to see Přemysl. The ploughman in his bast shoes plants a seed into the ground, which later grows into a tree. The messengers bring him to Vyšehrad and Libuše gives him Bohemus' cane. Everyone recognizes the new ruler. – However, Libuše's companion does not approve of the transfer of power. They leave Vyšehrad and establish the fortress of Děvín on the opposite hill. – During the midsummer, the women trick Ctirad and his guide into taking possession of the tree when the young man wants to help Šárka, who is intentionally tied to the tree. The captives are thrown into a dark cave at Děvín. But Šárka and Ctirad fall in love. – A young boy who saw Ctirad's captivity informs the men. – The women of the castle see smoke signals, and dancing warriors appear in their vision. The men secretly infiltrate Děvín. Šárka frees Ctirad and his companion. The leader of the women, Vlasta, refuses to accept the defeat. She aims her spear at Ctirad but Šárka gets in the way. The other women join her, and they start to dance with the warriors. Eventually the lonely Vlasta leaves. – After Přemysl, other dukes (Nezamysl, Mnata, Vojen and Mnislav) ruled before Duke Křesomysl took over. At that time, people began to dig for gold and other metals and overlooked wokrking their fields because of this. Some people did not like this. Their leader was Horymír of Neumětely, who unsuccessfully complained to Křesomysl about the metal diggers. The smiths, outraged by his lawsuit, attacks Neumětely. Horymír then destroys their Březové Mountains. The metalworkers sue him before the duke, and the ruler sentences Horymír to death. The noble asks the duke to let him ride his horse Šemík once more before the execution. The rider circles around the Vyšehrad courtyard several times, then jumps over the walls with his horse, swims across the Vltava River and disappears. – The fearsome Neklan inherits the reign of Křesomysl. Then the tribe of Lucians, led by the fierce Vlastislav, invades the country. They cause great destruction. The indecisive Neklan must finally listen to the complaints of his servants. But instead of himself, he secretly makes his fearless aid Čestmír the leader of the army. – The Lucians send swarms of ravens and packs of dogs against the Bohemians. However, the warriors resist the birds, animals, and enemy soldiers. In a duel, Čestmír kills Vlastislav, but is himself killed by Lucian archers. – The warriors bury the hero. – The blind old man sings about the Czechs, that they will live on free in the songs of the old men. And their country flourishes..."
