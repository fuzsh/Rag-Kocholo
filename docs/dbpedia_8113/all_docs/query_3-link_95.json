        "text": "Detail from The Garden of Earthly Delights by Hyeronymus Bosch.\n\nGoogle has just announced a new layer in Google Earth. When this new layer is activated, you can browse a selection of famous paintings from the Prado Museum in Madrid, Spain. Once you’ve chosen a painting, you can take a very close look at it, which I had a blast doing. The screenshots give you a good feel of how good the quality of image is.\n\nThe Museum’s building has also been modeled in 3D by Google, reminding me that I should browse Google Earth more often. If you don’t want to turn Google Earth on, you can just take a look at the presentation video at the end of this post or by seeing it in Google Maps. Anyway I’m very excited by this new feature and looking forward to see more museums and paintings in Google Earth.\n\nAnother detail from Bosch’s painting, where people logically gather around a giant strawberry.\n\nYet another detail from Bosch’s painting, because it’s so amazing.\n\nDetail of Artemis by Rembrandt, funny to see how the artist integrated his name.\n\nDetail of the Descent from the cross by Francisco de Goya.\n\nDetail from Las Meninas by Diego Velazquez."
