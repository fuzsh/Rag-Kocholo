        "text": "While at the present time the percentage of illiterates in Bohemia is half of one percent, the fact remains that of those who came to our state in the early days but few had more than the most rudimentary schooling. This is but natural, for immigration was drawn from the poorer classes, for which a better livelihood was the main consideration and the law regarding compulsory attendance of school in Bohemia did not become effective until 1869. Besides, under Austrian despotism and caste system the peasants were repressed in intellectual matters. Many learned to read from Czech newspapers in this country and as far as Nebraska is concerned, the Pokrok Zapadu, for years the only newspaper here, played an important role in that respect, as well as that of attracting settlers. Mr. Thomas Capek, in his \"Fifty Years of Czech Letters in America\", says of Czech papers in this country:\n\n\"The influence of newspapers was everywhere deep and of creative tendency. It was the newspapers that taught a neglected people to think independently. It was the newspapers that tried to liberate them from the domination of darkness and fear. Our younger generation can have no idea of the power wielded by Czech printing on immigrants who came between 1860 and 1875. People came by the tens of thousands, they were in need of wise counsellors, selfless leaders. The wide, unsettled, western plains beckoned to experienced farmers; the industries of the eastern cities, impoverished by the Civil War, began to awaken and need artisans and laborers. Who was to advise the immigrant? This office, honorable and sometimes replete with ingratitude, fell to the Czech editor. He was the vanguard, around which new settlements sprung. It is not true that newspapers always followed settlers. They did come into existence in some colonies already established, but the Pokrok Zapadu in Omaha always led. Nebraska contains the highest percentage of Czech people of the first generation, of all our agricultural states in the Union, and does anyone think that it comes about purely by accident?\" --Mr. Capek proceeds further to show how hard and thorny was the path of those early journals and their editors, how they led their people in matters not only practical, but also social and cultural, and how they realized that not only the body but the mind and soul too must be fed, even in pioneer times. In these days, when the majority of that first generation has gone to its eternal rest, it is hard for their successors to appreciate the value of a medium that gave newcomers, in their own language, various information so needed by them, -- not only about lands, but about current events, our laws, politics, civic affairs, etc.\n\nThe Pokrok Zapadu holds the record in Nebraska, for it was published unceasingly for fifty-one years. The next is the farm paper Hospodar, now in its thirty-sixth year and as flourishing as ever, for it has a national circulation, many copies being sent to Canada and Bohemia too. Emigration to the middle west ceased when the government and railroad lands were gone and this had a stultifying effect on the foreign-language papers. That is why those restricted to the midwestern territory cannot last. The Hospodar, having a larger scope, can maintain its position for years to come.\n\nOf the many publications listed in this chapter, all but the two just mentioned ceased to struggle after comparatively short careers. This is the fate of many small papers, but in this instance two factors especially played their parts. First, the large Czech dailies in Chicago publish semi-weeklies, using matter from their dailies, so that they can put out a larger paper at nominal cost, thus providing serious competition. The other, a more deadly and insidious factor is that the second and following generations, with but small exceptions, do not read Czech. When we add that of late immigration has been restricted and probably in the future always will be, it is easy to realize that the days of foreign-language papers in this country are gradually being numbered. At the present time the only other Czech paper published in Nebraska is the weekly Narodni Pokrok (National Progress) in Omaha, and it is more than probable that it is the last of its kind. Thirty-five Czech papers have been published in Nebraska, and in less than two generations they have dwindled down to the last but one. That alone tells the story.\n\n1871--POKROK ZAPADU (PROGRESS OF THE WEST) OMAHA:\n\nFounded by Edward Rosewater, who published it until 1877, when John Rosicky bought it. For a more detailed account of the beginings of this paper see the Introduction. Editors under Mr. Rosewater: V. L. Vodicka, Joseph Michal, Mr. Prazak, Vaclav Snajdr, F. B. Zdrubek, Joseph Novinsky and John Rosicky. Under Mr. Rosicky: V. A. Jung, Thomas Capek, R. V. Miskovsky, J. A. Oliverius, Rev. E. A. Bouska, J. R. Jicinsky, F. J. Kutak, J. V. Masek, John Cerny, J. K. Mazac, Joseph Bunata. After August, 1900, when Mr. Rosicky sold the paper to the Pokrok Publishing Company: F. J. Pribyl, Otakar Charvat, A. J. Havranek, Fr. Hais, J. J. Rezabek, Emil Tuma and Mrs. V. Bures. From August 1, 1871, the paper bore the name Pokrok Zapadu, from 1872 to 1873 Pokrok Zapadu a Amerikan (Progress of The West And American), the paper Amerikan having been bought from the Slavie, Racine, Wisconsin, and consolidated with it) then it was changed to Pokrok Zapadu again. From 1877 to August, 1889, it was published by John Rosicky, at which latter date he established the Pokrok Zapadu Printing Company, which in 1899 was changed to the National Printing Company, that is in name only. In 1892 the paper was made a semi-weekly. When the Pokrok Publishing Company (R. V. Miskovsky, President, Vaclav Bures Secretary, and Charles Steiger, Treasurer) took it over in August, 1900, within a short time it began to publish local editions for various Bohemian localities, as follow: Cretesky Pokrok (Crete Progress) and Wilbersky Tydennik (Wilber Weekly) for Saline County; Dakotsky Pokrok (Dakota Progress) for South Dakota; Iowsky Pokrok (Iowa Progress) for Iowa; Kansasky Pokrok (Kansas Progress) for Kansas and Minnesotsky Pokrok (Minnesota Progress) for Minnesota. After 1902 Mr. Vaclav Bures directed the affairs of the company, later acquiring sole ownership, and on November 1, 1915 made it into a daily. In 1920 he sold it to the weekly Hlasatel of Chicago, Illinois, and thus passed out, after fifty-one years of continuous existence, the first and for a few years the only Bohemian paper in Nebraska.\n\n1874--SALINE COUNTY POST, CRETE--Hoyt and Wells, publishers, printed one page in Bohemian, Cenek Duras was editor and compositor.\n\nJuly 1877-BESEDA (THE CIRCLE), WILBER--A weekly.

Jung contributed original verse and very good translations from Longfellow and Tennyson.
