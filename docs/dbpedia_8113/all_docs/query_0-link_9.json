        "text": "Alois Jirásek (1851-1930) was a Czech writer and playwright who is considered one of the most important figures in Czech literature. He wrote historical novels, plays, and short stories that focused on the history and culture of his native Bohemia. His works often featured strong female characters and explored themes of patriotism, justice, and morality. He was also a prominent advocate for Czech independence from Austria-Hungary. His most famous works include Ancient Bohemian Legends (1894), Lantern (1905), Against All (1893), Darkness (1913), and F.L. Century (1888). He was awarded the Order of the White Lion in 1929 for his contributions to Czech literature."
