        "text": "Another cold day in Prague. I took the bus to visit Žižkov, one of the Prague quarters, just a little (North/West) part of it. In fact I went there to look for shoes :-).\n\nI took a bus, it needs just 5 minutes from city center and I am here at Tachovske náměstí with some street art.\n\nDetails on the buidling connected with Hussites (and Žižka) history.\n\nI look at the tunnel, but today I am not going there. I am even not going South and Up, where one of the most visible Prague landmarks is, Žižkov Tower, you can read about it in one of my previous posts about Prague towers here.\n\nAnother famous landmark of Prague in Žižkov is one of the biggest equestrian statues of Jan Žižka. But today I also wanted to make a picture of another equestrian status, of Jaroslav Hašek. Reading his book of Good Soldier Švejk (happening during the first world war) you can learn about Czech character and sense of humor, we even use the word “švejkovani” (švejking) after the main character, meaning something like: pretending being stupid to get something I want and not to get something I don’t want (like punishment for what I have done or something):-). The statue is quite interesting as well.\n\nMy goal is a visit to the shop with men’s fashion (I love them :-)) to look at their new shoes for my husband. I visit the place for the first time and it is quite nice with lot of interesting design supplements. The name of the shop is Gentleman Store.\n\nThe next place I really want to visit here is unique cubist Bethlehem chapel hidden at the backyard. The chapel is in use and unfortunately is closed now, as there is not any ceremony at the moment. But even from outside it is nice.\n\nSome details of the exterior.\n\nEven today it is really really cold and I just need to go home, therefore I climb up the streets for a tram. During the walk I meet Czech writer Karel Havlíček Borovský in the middle of the square with some of his quotation written on the street.\n\nThe text bellow:\n\nThe honest one suffers from hunger\n\nThieves are at risk of gallows\n\nThe Czech writer has more troubles\n\nHe is at risk of hunger and gallows\n\nNo one there to listen to him. No one wants to freeze :-)-\n\nSome of the buildings at Žižkov are uninhabited, empty.\n\nAnother street art piece on the wall.\n\nAnd quite new picturesque colorful building.\n\nCouple of colorful windows.\n\nAnd finally just under the tram stop, a memorial to Jaroslav Seifert, Czech author, who won Nobel price.\n\nI have decided to invite you to my world of cafes in Prague. There is so many of them and the tradition of good coffee is really strong (despite the fact that during communistic regime it was only “turkish” coffee available).\n\nI will show you my favorite places, tell you something small about their history and ask baristas couple of questions, which are:\n\n1. why you are at this place, this cafe?\n\n2. what would you get being a client in this cafe\n\n3. your favorite place or recommendation what to see and where to go in Prague\n\n4. nice story from the cafe\n\nLet’s start with Cafe No.3., you have had a chance to see this cafe in my post about the Yards of the Old Town here. Cafe was opened in July 2015 at Jakubska street at the city center. The owners are Zbyšek and Pierre and very often you can also meet Duyen.\n\nWhy this place:\n\nZbyšek: I fall in love with the green blind on the door (seen when the cafe is closed) immediately\n\nPierre: after moving to the Old Town (which was my dream) I had a problem to find a cafe nearby where I would like to go. We decided to open cafe of our own in our style and by a chance this place was available.\n\nDuyen: I like it because it is small, cozy and friendly\n\nWhat would you order from the menu:\n\nZbyšek: homemade soda (ginger and strawberry), beze\n\nPierre: capuccino and beze\n\nDuyen: homemade soda and pancakes\n\nKaty (me): Štrudl pro Marušku non alcoholic version (hot apple juice with cloves and cinnamon and raisins and whipped cream), beze\n\n“Beze” means type of dessert in Czech, full of whipped cream made with pecano nuts (in this case), the chocolate version is also available, but the “white” version is better, look at the picture.\n\nYou recommendation what to see or where to go in Prague:\n\nZbyšek: I recommend visiting Glass Gallery in Moser factory shop at the Old Town Square in the cellar of the shop.\n\nGallery (click on a picture to make it bigger):\n\nPierre: I would recommend to very tourist to have a chance to get lost in Prague for some time and just enjoy its streets and corners, let it surprise you with something only for you.\n\nDuyen: Visit the neo-rennaisance building of Czech Saving Bank in Rytirska street, its nicely decorated and looks like a palace. It is not possible to make pictures inside, but you can go in, walk through the doors guarded by beasts and left up the stairs. Up there is an expat bank center as well.\n\nGallery (click on a picture to make it bigger, the quality is poor as the pictures were stolen on the phone not to be seen):\n\nNice story from the cafe:\n\nSome people (like me) fall in love with the cafe, for its friendly atmosphere, creativity (check the pictures on the walls, mainly done by Pierre) and we keep coming back. And two of Cafe No. 3 clients created a mystery, as they are sending postcards to the cafe signing them Circle Foxes. Once Zbyšek was cleaning the table after clients and he found a chocolate and another postcard, which were left there by Circle Foxes. See in the gallery.\n\nReally good time for a visit is Christmas, because we all (Zbyšek, Pierre, Duyen and me) are big lovers of Christmas tree and for Advent and Christmas time there is really beautiful tree installed and decorated, see the picture and gallery bellow:\n\nSee also collection of my watercolors made based on the photos of my drinks taken at the cafe.\n\nIf you have made it to the end of the post, you can send a postcard to the cafe; the address:\n\nCzech Republic\n\nIt was quite difficult to chose my favorite place for Weekly Photo Challenge, as I love almost every place I had a chance to visit, but finally I decided for one that really touched my heart.\n\nI was there in October 2015 for the first time and I have been there for 4 weeks, not surprisingly I have chosen the place also for our holiday in summer 2017. Where is it? It is just a little suburb of Brighton in the UK called Shoreham-by-Sea.\n\nIn the first gallery pictures from early autumn morning walks to school around River Adur with typical houseboat colony.\n\nI also got a chance to find nice friends in Shoreham / Lancing and it is also thank to them that I love the place so much.\n\nFor our visit in summer 2017 we found an accommodation right in the river in a houseboat in a shape of firetruck. The stay there was really pleasant and I fell in love with the place even more.\n\nBeautiful view from the boat across the river to the city center during the day.\n\nAnd at night.\n\nThe Shoreham Fort at the mouth of the river.\n\nGallery\n\nAnd my try to get the city atmosphere on a picture.\n\nThere is a lot of museums in Prague, some of them I like and visit, some of them are traditional. I will visit couple of them for you and I do not follow any special key, like the most famous one, the newest one or any other. I will choose just as the idea would cross my mind. As today morning, I’ve seen a picture of DOX museum somewhere on internet, and almost immediately I decided to visit it now. The museum is on my plan quite long time, but today was THE day.\n\nTo read more information about DOX museum follow this link. I will share more my feelings about the museum :-). To be honest, my main goal was the visit of Gulliver Airship and the cafe and the design shop. I did all three, but then I decided to visit the exhibitions as well (mainly because you have to pay the entrance fee for the Airship which includes the exhibitions, and then there was no reason to skip them).\n\nI started with the shop and then the cafe. I love Czech design and Czech designers, therefore I enjoyed the shop a lot. I have seen a lot of familiar names and pieces, but also some new ones.\n\nThen came the coffee (and pink wine) time.\n\nAs you can see there were a lot of books at the cafe. Old books. For sale. 10 Czech crown per one, what is something less then 50 cents! How many do you think I purchased? 5! And two more at the other part of the museum!\n\nBut they all were quite nice famous books, 5 of the 7 bought books were criminal stories for my husband, Graham Greene, Mika Waltari, just 2 were for me, one my favorite childhood book (I know I have it somewhere but I can’t find it) and a first part of Skalholt books by Gudmundur Kamban (the second one I just got from similar book shelf at the train station). They also had a lot of Czech classis bookf, for example from popular writer Alois Jirásek, but these are too big and heavy to carry.\n\nAfter the coffee (and wine) we went to see the Airship on the roof of the former factory. As it is cold, there is no special action happening there, but from April through the warmer months you can go there for lecture or performance. I have loved it :-).\n\nThere were currently three exhibitions on program, and you will see some installation lower, but I really enjoyed the overall space of the museum, the technical style of it.\n\nFrom three exhibition I am choosing one author from them for this picture. You wouldn’t believe what it is. Take a olook ant think. The name of the author is Luboš Plný and he is (wait for it) certified Academic model! As he didn’t made to the Art school, he attended the lectures as a model for students, even made a thesis and finally he got the title.\n\nHard to write: the author took everything that grew up in his “umbilical whole in the navel” (I am not able to find the translation of this one, the left picture) and put it on the scheme (the middle picture) and wrote the notes, what he wore that day and other information, what can influence “the product” (right picture). Creepy. isn’t it?\n\nPictures form the current installations here:\n\nFound on WordPress:\n\nhttps://openartdoors.wordpress.com/2018/03/05/lubos-plny-viva-lubos-plny-dox-centre-for-contemporary-art-prague/\n\nToday it was so cold that I decided to walk only around our place, have a coffee and and back home.\n\nFirst are the buildings on our street, like the newly reconstructed Lanna palace (sorry, link only in Czech).\n\nOr Cafe Arco (soory link in Czeck again, but you can read there the list of people who were regulars to the cafe), where Franz Kafka used to come (but not regularly, but would not find the doors opened today, as the cafe is not in use.\n\nNot talking about touristic highlight of the Powder Gate / Tower at the end of the street.\n\nSome other buildings on our street.\n\nWhere is also nice Podzemní antikvariát (Underground bookshop) – shop selling old books, print etc.\n\nAnd at the same building you will find this beautiful “detail”.\n\nThe oldest train station in Prague Masarykovo nádraží, on the opposite side of the street.\n\nMy goal today is to visit another one of my favored cafes Kavárna Pražírna Voznice at YMCA palace. At the palace I will also show you something quite unique.\n\nBut still we have couple of steps to get there around Hilton Old Town with beautiful mosaic and through the shortcut to Na Poříčí street.\n\nAnd we are there, at YMCA palace.\n\nAND NOW the surprise. YMCA palace is one of the places in Prague where you can see and actually use the pater noster lift. That’ the one with lot of cabins permanently moving around and you jump in and out, when you want to use it. Even more adrenaline you drive at the top (or bottom) of the lift, but be careful as this is forbidden (the sign VYSTUPTE means EXIT NOW).\n\nFind my reportage from the ride bellow, I was playing a little with time-lapse, so please survive my “creativity”.\n\nOr you can just use the stairs in YMCA palace :-).\n\nI think I have deserved the delicious cafe then :-).\n\nBefore you leave its good to use this one (specially when it is so cold outside).\n\nOutside from the palace, and you can take tram, subway, go shopping to Palladium or just simply walk home in this cold.\n\nThe list of pater nosters in Prague here (some of them closed = zrušené).\n\nAnd now I go on with my walk through the yards of the Old Town, and its after dark. The previous part you can find here. We ended the previous post at Cathedral Cafe, and we are not leaving yet, as its courtyard is really nice as well.\n\nAnd the next picture is really interesting, look at the white chairs and table, what they are standing at?\n\nYes! It is an old well, older then the buildings, so when the buildings and courtyards were built, people just put halves of the well to the different yards. Let’s look at it from the other side.\n\nAnd a little closer look.\n\nCourtyards of the Old Town and House by a Stone Bell.\n\nBeautiful blue light at the yards of the Tynska street.\n\nHouse by a Stone Bell stands on the Old Town Square and not long time age it had Renaissance facade. When I watch movies from 1970 and there are shots from this place, I wait to see it in its Renaissance version. But at late 70s they reconstructed the building and gave it the original Gothic appearance by taking down the Renaissance “dress”.\n\nFrom Old Town Square I went through my favorite spot the Tyn yard to finish the evening at lovely Cafe No.3.\n\nCafe no.3 is fortunately (for me) empty at his time of the day and year, as it s cozy but small place with just a few seats and I am happy when I can have a chat with the owners Pierre and Zbyšek about life, taste Zbyšek’s delicious dessert (the pecan one, but others are great to). Sometimes I have just espresso, but mostly I get “štrudl” (hot apple juice with whipped cream and cinnamon), or London fog and white hot wine, that is just great as well.\n\nThis post can be either in Night Walks or Winter, as I went out at the evening and it was freeezing :-). But still it was very beautiful to visit hidden yards and places just around the Old Town Square. Finally I decided to split the photos to before and after dark. And this post is about the before-sunset one :-).\n\nI was happy to have a chance to visit the premises of the Monastery of Minor Brothers next to the Saint James Church at the Old Town. Its best years were in 14 century, when the weeding dinner of Czech King John of Luxembourg and his bride Elisabeth from Royal Czech Premyslid family (parents of Czech King and Roman Emperor Charles IV)) took place, next wedding celebration was the one of John and his second wife Beatrix. You can rent this place even now :-).\n\nWith its beautiful courtyard:\n\nAnd even better pictures at the gallery:\n\nAfter the visit of the monastery I have just wandered around the area, where originally meat and fish markets used to be, so the names of the streets will not surprise you – Masná (Meet st) or Rybná (Fish st) – and also the house signs reminds you of this business.\n\nFrom Týnská street is also nice view to the spires of the Church Our Lady in front of the Tyn (Ungelt), or as we call it shortly Tyn or Ungelt, even thought the Tyn (or Ungelt, which is the same but in German and we historically use both names as synonyms) is in fact the courtyard behind the church.\n\nFrom Týnská street you can visit hidden courtyards.\n\nAnd as the dark is coming, you can also see the ceilings through the windows in enlightened interiors.\n\nAnd finally some warming up in my favorite Cathedral Cafe.\n\nLook through to its courtyard."
