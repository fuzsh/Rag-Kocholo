        "text": "In This Article\n\nOrigin, Meaning, And History Of Alois\n\nThe masculine name Alois is a German and Czech transliteration of the English name Aloysius, a Latinized variation of Aloys, an Old Occitan variation of Louis. According to etymologists, Louis is a French cognate of Ludovicus, the Latinized variation of the Old German name Ludwig.\n\nLudwig comes from the Germanic name Hludwig, which comes from the root elements hlut, meaning ‘famous’ or ‘loud,’ and wig, meaning ‘war’ or ‘battle.’ As a result, the name Alois refers to a ‘famous warrior.’ Alternatively, Alois might have derived from the German name Alwis, a combination of Old High German elements al, which means ‘all,’ and wîsi, meaning ‘wise.’ Hence, the name translates to ‘all wise’ or ‘very wise.’\n\nAlois is pronounced A-lois in the international phonetic alphabet. However, its pronunciation across languages can vary. Moreover, this given name exhibits numerous variations in different languages, including Aloïs, Alaois, Alojz, Alojzije, Aloisio, Alajos, Alvise, and Alojzy. Some adorable nicknames for Alois can be Al, Alis, Alo, Loi, Lou, and Lois.\n\nIn addition to the real world, this elegant name has left a strong impression on the fictional world. For instance, the fictional character Alois Nebel is a storyteller in Jaroslav Rudiš and Jaromír 99’s comic-book trilogy Bílý Potok (White Brook), Hlavní nádraží (Main Station), and Zlaté Hory (Golden Hills). Later, in 2011, Tomáš Luňák adapted this trilogy into the Czech animated drama movie Alois Nebel. In this movie, the Czech actor Miroslav Krobot portrays the titular character, Alois Nebel.\n\nAnother prominent character is Earl Alois Trancy, also known as Menino Aranha, the head of the Trancy family in Yana Toboso’s Japanese anime series Black Butler. Additionally, this moniker serves as the title of two children’s books, namely the 2015 German children’s picture book Alois by Max Bolliger and the 2010 children’s literature Alois by María Ángeles Sánchez-Ostiz, which creatively educates young readers about Alzheimer’s disease.\n\nHow To Pronounce Alois?\n\n‘Alois’ In QR Code\n\nNotable People Named Alois\n\nThis section covers people who have made the name Alois famous with their contributions in various fields.

Starting from the sun’s position at the March equinox, the chart goes anti-clockwise from Aries, followed by Taurus, Gemini, Cancer, Leo, Virgo, Libra, Scorpio, Sagittarius, Capricorn, Aquarius, and Pisces. These signs are ruled by planetary bodies - Mars, Venus, Mercury, Moon, Sun, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune.
