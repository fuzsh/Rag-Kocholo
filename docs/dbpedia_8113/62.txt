Jirasek, Alois.

Jirasek, Alois (b. Aug. 23, 1851, Hronov, Bohemia, Austrian Empire [now in Czech Republic]--d. March 12, 1930, Prague)

The most important Czech novelist in the period before World War I, as well as a great national figure.

Jirasek was a secondary-school teacher until his retirement in 1909. He wrote a series of historical novels imbued with faith in his nation and in progress toward freedom and justice. He was particularly attracted by the Hussite period of Bohemian history (15th century), to which he devoted his most famous work, the trilogy Mezi proudy (1891; "Between the Currents"), Proti vsem (1894; "Against All the World"), and Bratrstvo (1899-1908; "Brotherhood"). Perhaps of greater artistic significance is his portrayal of the 19th-century Czech national revival in F.L. Vek (1888-1906). His best work is probably his last major novel, Temno (1915; "Darkness"), in which he painted a vivid picture of Bohemia in the grip of the Counter-Reformation.

His literary output also included plays and short stories.
