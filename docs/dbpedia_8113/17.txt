Old Bohemian legends accompany each Czech from chidhood. Tales, myths and legends are not backed by historical evidence, but they survived to the present day in folk stories and legends recorded by chroniclers Kosmas, Dalimil and Václav Hájek of Libočany, as well as in Ancient Bohemian Legends written by renowned Czech 19th century writer Alois Jirásek. They tell stories about the oldest period of the Czech history – approximately between 6th and 10th century, up to the period of duke Bořivoj, the first documented Přemyslid ruler.

Lingvists assume that the legend about Bivoj from Ancient Bohemian Legends probably has Celtic roots – judging by the Celtic word bivó which meant strong.

A certain resemblance with this tale can be traced in Celtic traditions, for example in Ireland. According to the legend, Bivoj overpowered a boar with his bare hands and carried him on his back to the Libušín fortress where he killed him with a spear in the presence of on-looking people and rulers. This show of strength earned him the heart and hand of Kazi, sister of duchess Libuše.

The obverse side features a centrally placed figure of the tough guy Bivoj carrying a boar on his back, the text in partial circumscription reads “Dukát České republiky“ and an excerpt from the Legend of Bivoj as recorded in Ancient Bohemian Legends –“Bohové Ti, i Tvé síle žehnali“ (Gods blessed You and Your Strength).

All reverse sides of the ducat series comprise motifs of five- pointed stars and three emblems of the Czech lands, but they are arranged differently on each of the ducats. The three emblems and the composition of five-pointed stars commemorate the integration of the Czech Republic in the family of European nations.

On one-ducat medal the stars are arranged around the rim while the three emblems are placed in the centre –each in a rectangular field – next to the year of issue 2011.
