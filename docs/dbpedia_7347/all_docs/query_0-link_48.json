        "text": "Charles Darwin and his contemporary philosopher Herbert Spencer may not have had much to say about modernity, but they certainly had a lot to contribute to it. Charles Robert Darwin (1809–1882) was a British naturalist and geologist who is widely credited — along with his fellow naturalist Alfred Russel Wallace — with discovering the primary mechanism by which life has evolved on Earth, namely evolution by natural selection. Eleven years junior of Darwin, Herbert Spencer (1820–1903) was a British philosopher and sociologist who was a vocal proponent of evolutionary theory and is perhaps most closely associated with the “social Darwinist” school of thought today.\n\nAlthough Darwin and Spencer are names that more or less go hand in hand in contemporary literature, it is imperative to note the fundamental differences between their intellectual crafts — that is, the modes of inquiry in which they engaged. Darwin was a scientist, and hence was primarily concerned with the empirical study of the natural world. “But we are not here concerned with hopes or fears,” he wrote in his 1871 book The Descent of Man, “only with the truth as far as our reason allows us to discover it.” This is not to say that Darwin was a scientist and a scientist only; quite to the contrary, he is regarded as one of the most influential philosophers of all time, as he was in the best position to philosophize about his own scientific work.\n\nHerbert Spencer, on the other hand, inclined as he was toward philosophy and the humanities, was chiefly interested in the meanings and implications of the work done by the likes of Darwin. He contemplated questions such as, “What does this piece of information mean on a metaphysical level?,” “How do we utilize it for good?,” “How should we proceed from here?” In short, he took the additional step of wondering what ought to be, and not merely what is. As much as Darwin’s writings were descriptive, Spencer’s were prescriptive.\n\nThis brings us to a crucial difference between Darwin and Spencer, namely the manner in which they employed the phrase “survival of the fittest” — one much more frequently than the other, as we shall see. Darwin very much preferred the term “natural selection” as a designation for the mechanism of evolution — indeed, not only did he coin the term, but he used it in the title of his groundbreaking book on the subject, On the Origin of Species by Means of Natural Selection, or Preservation of Favoured Races in the Struggle for Life (1859). “Survival of the fittest” appears perhaps no more than once in Darwin’s book, and only in passing: “This principle of preservation, or the survival of the fittest, I have called Natural Selection.”\n\nFor Darwin, “survival of the fittest” represented a purely descriptive observation as to the nature of evolutionary processes. Those organisms, he reasoned, who display the most fitness — or adaptation to their respective environments — have the highest chance of survival and thus reproduction. This is, in essence, a process of selection, but one that is naturally occurring and does not entail a selecting agent — hence the phrase “natural selection.”\n\nSpencer, however, was nowhere near satisfied with the limited, descriptive power of this Darwinian principle, and went further — excessively further, I must say — to derive a full-fledged moral prescription from it. He viewed “survival of the fittest” not only as the way the world is, but also as the way it ought to be. In his 1884 book The Man Versus the State, Spencer wrote the following: “If . . . multiplication of the inferior was furthered, and multiplication of the superior hindered, progressive degradation would result; and eventually the degenerate species would fail to hold its ground in presence of antagonistic species and competing species.”\n\nRather unabashedly, Spencer viewed the poor and disadvantaged to be intrinsically inferior to the rest of society — indeed, he characterized them as the “degenerate species” and “innately unworthy.” And yet nowhere in his writings, I must note, did he provide the slightest justification for this outrageous view of humanity. Extrapolating from his peculiar interpretation of Darwinian principles, Spencer essentially sought to redefine morality as the preservation of the relatively well-off members of society, and, remarkably, expected his intellectual peers to simply take his extraordinary assertions at face value.\n\nSpencer even took it upon himself to construct a strawman argument, writing a rather simplistic passage and conveniently describing it as the “kind of response which I expect to be made by nine out of ten.” Below is the protestation by the strawman, a sensational hypocrite in Spencer’s telling:\n\nYes, truly; your principle is derived from the lives of brutes, and is a brutal principle. You will not persuade me that men are to be under the discipline which animals are under. I care nothing for your natural-history arguments. My conscience shows me that the feeble and the suffering must be helped; and, if selfish people won’t help them, they must be forced by law to help them. Don’t tell me that the milk of human kindness is to be reserved for the relations between individuals, and that governments must be the administrators of nothing but hard justice. Every man with sympathy in him must feel that hunger and pain and squalor must be prevented, and that, if private agencies do not suffice, then public agencies must be established.\n\nThe late journalist Christopher Hitchens was fond of saying, “That which could be asserted without evidence could also be dismissed without evidence.” This axiom, in my view, suffices as a grounds on which to reject the entirety of Spencer’s moral philosophy. There is not an iota of evidence that there are any moral dimensions to the natural order of the universe, and hence any effort to derive moral principles solely from the workings of nature is futile. Morality, I submit, is too consequential an enterprise to be delegated to the blind, mechanical being that is nature."
