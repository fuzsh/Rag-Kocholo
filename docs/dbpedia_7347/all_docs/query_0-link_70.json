        "text": "Dear Spencer\n\nI daresay you will think me a foolish fellow, but I cannot resist the wish to express my unbounded admiration of your article in answer to Mr Martineau. It is indeed admirable, & hardly less so your second article on Sociology (which however I have not yet finished): I never believed in the reigning influence of great men on the world’s progress; but if asked why I did not believe, I shd. have been sorely perplexed to have given a good answer. Everyone with eyes to see & ears to hear (the number, I fear, are not many) ought to bow their knee to you, as I for one do.—\n\nBelieve me | yours most sincerely | Ch. Darwin\n\nWe have come here to my son’s house for 10 days’ rest; as I have just finished & sent my M.S. on “Expression of the Emotions in Man & the lower animals” to the Printers.—\n\nDo not think of wasting your time by acknowledging this scrap.—"
