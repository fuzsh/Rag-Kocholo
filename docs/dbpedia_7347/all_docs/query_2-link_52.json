        "text": "The British philosopher Herbert Spencer was immensely popular in the late 19th century among academics, contributing to a wide range of subjects including sociology, political theory, anthropology, literature and biology. He developed an all embracing concept of evolution which he applied to the development and growth of society.\n\nHerbert Spencer\n\nSpencer wrote that society progresses over time, and that this progression is accomplished through competition among the individuals within society through a natural selection that affects social as well as biological phenomenon. He traced everything in the world back through causal chains to two fundamental factors, matter and motionâ€”two aspects of force. Societal growth which progresses through evolution from simplicity to complexity, from homogeneous to heterogeneous, from chaos to order, from generalization to specialization, and from flexibility to organization. Spencer organized societies according to their evolutionary phases.\n\nSimple Societies\n\nSpencer described Simple Societies as those without a regulatory center for public ends that operate with occasional leadership or unstable leadership. These societies were predominantly small, nomadic, and lacking in stable relationship structure. They had low degrees of differentiation, specialization, and integration.\n\nCompound Societies\n\nWhen two or more Simple Societies are unified, either through peaceful or warlike means, Compound Societies come into existence. These societies are mainly agricultural in nature and have some basic divisions of labor along with permanent residences. They tend to be characterized by a division of four or five social strata and an organized priestly group. They are also characterized by industrial structures that show in advancing division of labor, general and local.\n\nDoubly Compound Societies\n\nWhen political organizations become more intricate, rigid and complex, with a single head and a formal legal system, then the next form is reached as Doubly Compound Societies. These societies have more definite political structure, a religious hierarchy, a more or less rigid caste system and more complex division of labor. Towns and roads have become general, and considerable progress in knowledge and the arts has taken place.\n\nTrebly Compound Societies\n\nSpencer describes the great civilized nations as Trebly Compound Societies where shared dependence and complicated structures are evident.\n\nAccording to Spencer, all societies advance through this compound evolution process of structural complexity, though organizational purposes vary. He divided societies into two distinct categories, Militant Societies and Industrial Societies.\n\nMilitant Societies\n\nThe militant societies have only one commanding center and are characterized by 'compulsion' or 'compulsory cooperation. All of the organizations are public and the state has a centralized structure. Individuals live for the benefit of the State and are loyal and dependent on the State's authority.\n\nThe psychological traits distinctive to the individuals in a militant society include conformism, obedience, loyalty, acceptance of routine, lack of initiative, dependency on authority. They believe that prevailing conditions are usual and the only possible conditions.\n\nIndustrial Societies\n\nSpencer defines industrial societies as economies where private organization exist and the State remains decentralized. Society is based on 'voluntary cooperation' where the will of the citizens is supreme and government exists to merely carry out the citizen's will.\n\nIn these economies, private organizations exist and the structure of the state remains decentralized. Rather than economic autonomy of the state, free trade is encouraged. There exists a plasticity and openness of rank and occupation.\n\nSpencer anticipated that societies would develop and progress into the ultimate from of industrial state where societies would be \"based on contracts between individuals pursuing their respective interests.\" With minimal or no state intervention that would lead to regression to earlier forms of tyrannical and militant social order.\n\nThe ultimate society completes its evolution when the ultimate man is \"one whose private requirements coincide with public ones. He will be that manner of man who, in spontaneously fulfilling his own nature, identically performs the functions of the social unit.\" These 'ultimate men' would be considered the 'fittest', and natural selection would rapidly rid the system of the unfit so long as the individuals are permitted to work for their own interests without interference from the state. Evolution would, according to Spencer, craft a new social order with absolute harmony in the society when the state is restricted to guarding individual rights and defending against outside hostility.\n\nSpencer's ideas were influential to the work of William Sumner, John Fiske, John Burgess, Andrew Carnegie and to writers Jack London and H G Wells, among others. Interest in Spencer's ideas fell significantly late in his life. Criticism centered on his ethnocentric beliefs that Western Civilization was the most valuable; the assumptions that all cultures follow the same path or progression and have the same goals; and that civilization was equated with material culture.\n\nSome of Herbert Spencer's ideas are associated with \"Social Darwinism,\" a concept that Spencer divorced himself from later in life. The evolutionary thoughts derived from Charles Darwin's On the Origin of Species introduced evolutionary theory as an explanation for the development of plants and animals influenced Spencer's speculations on society itself, and he had earlier in Social Statics come to believe that competition in human society also led to social advancement.\n\nSpencer's theory in its most basic form led some to believe that natural selection, when applied to societies and government, meant that there was a natural dominance in the world that allowed certain races (principally European Protestants), individuals, and nations to dominate because they were superior in the natural order. In political and economic terms, competition and self-interest advanced the social order. Competition could cure social ills without the need for government social programs or intervention. In society, a liberal economic laissez-faire approach was best.\n\nThe embrace of Social Darwinism helped to justify the \"might makes right\" conquests and colonization of Western powers during the 1800s. The \"logical\" extension of Spencer's ideas for the imperialists who embraced them was that a nation (or an empire) is strong because it is the fittest in the struggle for survival and has made the necessary adaptations to become superior.\n\nSpencer's works gained popularity outside of Britain and had a great influence in the United States. Often Spencer's ideas were simplified to the point of absurdity and, much like Darwin, he was summarized and not read. He influenced many American industrialists, the wealthy and the powerful because Social Darwinism justified and defended their elite status."
