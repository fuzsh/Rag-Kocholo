Darwin’s “Origin of Species” is the idea of the race who continuously dominates over others in competition is the race that shall survive on top, natural selection. This ideology was helped by artistic movements such as those seen in Gauguin's work in which he depicts Polynesian women as naked, that feel nothing as a European man gazes at them (Doc 5).

This ideology was assisted by artistic movements such as Gaugin’s work in which he depicts Polynesian women naked, that feel nothing as an odd looking European man stares at them (Doc 5). This pointed out the European belief that non-Europeans were uncivilized due to their own lack of preservation and that because of this they were also vulnerable. As nationalism took over European nations, these opinions gained even more popularity and prominence.

The idea of Social Darwinism spread which was originally introduced by Charles Darwin. However, Europeans interpreted his theory of natural selection as an idea that they had to civilize the uncivilized, which turned out to be Africa and Asia. They formed three types of governing bodies in different areas, colonies, protectorates, and spheres of influence, each doing something slightly different but all with the same idea, civilize the uncivilized. In Africa, it was viewed that the natives were uncivilized people; how they ate and spoke were signs to the Europeans that the African people were uneducated.\n\nSocial Darwinism is the application of Darwinism to the study of human society, specifically a theory in sociology that individual or groups achieve advantage over others as the result of genetic/biological superiority. Social Darwinism was introduced by Herbert Spencer, a british philosopher. He wrote about how certain traits certain groups of humans had made them better than other groups. He used that as a reason why the French, Spanish, and British had the right to go into “savage” countries and “take care” of the “biologically inferior”.

He formalized the distinction among the continental populations of the world and his work helped characterize the concept of race” (“Early Classification of Nature, RACE).\n\nRacism During The Enlightenment Essay\n\n1007 Words | 5 Pages\n\nDuring the Enlightenment period, any scientific knowledge eventually leads to the episteme associated with the Western society, empowering them to be justified for any relentless dominance toward their colonist. Regardless, it is easy to confuse the enlightenment itself with the racist thoughts brought up during enlightenment times. One of the biggest ideas that lead to racism during the Enlightenment time is the misuse of Charles Darwin’s theory of evolution. Darwin simply suggested “In the struggle for survival, the fittest win out at the expense of their rivals because they succeed in adapting themselves best to their environment” (Origin of Species, 1859)\n\nWorst Effects Of Socialization\n\n769 Words | 4 Pages\n\nWhat, according to Rousseau, were the worst effects of socialisation? Jeans-Jacques Rousseau’s Discourse on the Origin and Basis of Inequality Among Men is a defence of the original man in a state of nature and an attack on the corrupt and elitist European society of his day. Rousseau sought to ‘go back to an earlier point and try to piece together[… the] slow succession of events’ in order to pinpoint where humanity degenerated from the state of nature to today’s “civilised” society. In this sense, Rousseau seems to be attributing the process of socialisation to ‘all the evils’ in the world.\n\nAnti-Semitism In The Holocaust\n\n1400 Words | 6 Pages\n\nBut no theories where as popular with the Nazis as Hebert Spencer’s Social Darwinism theory and Sir Francis Galton’s Eugenics theory.

This theory was adapted by Herbert Spencer and resulted in the ideology that is known today as Social Darwinism. The latter is based on Darwin’s theory but instead of being based on animal behaviour it is applied to humans. It implied that certain races were superior to others because of their technological advancements. This lead people to believe that certain races, such as white/European people, were the “fittest” of all the races.\n\nIntroduction The theory of evolution has been discussed, evaluated, and researched many times since the theory was first brought to light. Darwin’s theory of evolution is said to be divided into two parts, common decent and natural selection (Bouzat, 2014). Many research papers agreeing with Darwin’s theory comment on the diversity of a species and how they have descended from one common ancestor. Natural selection is a process in which species that are better adapted to the environment tend to survive and reproduce (Dictonary.com)."
