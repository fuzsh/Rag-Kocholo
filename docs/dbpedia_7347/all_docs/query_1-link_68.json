        "text": "The other philosopher is Baron d'Holbach born in 1723 and died in 1789. D'Holbach was German by birth and education, but French by fortune (he inherited his uncle's money, estate and title). His estate was a meeting place for the leading French radical thinkers of the late 18th century. He also became a member of a group of notable thinkers and literary men including the Diderot, Helvétius, Condorcet, and Rousseau. He was an atheist, a determinist, and a materialist. He was an opponent of absolute monarchy, state religions and feudal privilege. It is fair to describe him as one of the most radical intellectuals of his time. His most famous works are The System of Nature, Good (or Common) Sense, or Natural Ideas vs. Supernatural Ideas.\n\nWhat helped shape and create society today? Four Philosophers, John Locke, Voltaire, Adam Smith, and Mary Wollstonecraft, during the late 1600’s through the late 1700’s all had at least had one similarity. That was that they believed in to change one’s perspective on the rights and freedom on different race, gender, or class. All of the philosophers ideas benefit the society and helped build courage for individuals.\n\nBradford work was religious freedom, he felt everyone should be intitled to what they believed in. Even though people change he stood up for what he believed in and went with it. I feel like Bradford worked more with social reform and freedom, while Smith was encouraging people to work hard for what they deserve.\n\nCharles Darwin developed a theory of biological evolution that stated all species evolved from other species through natural selection. Herbert Spencer followed up with this theory by coining the phrase ‘survival of the fittest’ as a way to describe natural selection. This theory grew among scientist, but the Fundamentalist Christians opposed Darwinism because it goes against their core beliefs. Some used it as a way to justify classifying some people as second-rate and how they treated those people. Darwinism also played a major role in America’s immigration policy and furthermore is one of the main reason for the start of World War I.\n\nHerbet Spencer and Edward Bellamy had differences and some similarities as they both went away from state power. We see this in Spencer when he says, “to these beginnings he ascribed his lifelong maniacal hatred of state power.” Bellamy thought differently about the state when we read, “In this utopian world, loyalty to the solidarity of the state holds the society together.” They both had different upbringings which would lead to their views being different. Each of them had a view which led to them creating their ideal societies.\n\nOne famous influential philosopher was John Locke. Locke was born in England in the mid 17th century and lived through both the English Civil War and the Glorious Revolution. He strongly believed in equality for all men. In his book Second Treatise on Civil Government, he says that “creatures of the same species and rank…should be equal amongst another without subordination or\n\nThe human race is very complex and sometimes simple to explained. We are created with basic tools that help us understand the world, agree and disagree. Two human whose ideas influenced and still influence people today are Socrates and Thoreau. Their ideas might influence many but do they both agree with each other principle's and premises, or disagree. Socrates and Thoreau both were men that believed in their beliefs, once their mind were made up.\n\nHerbert Spencer was the most important Social Darwinist of the 19th Century. He was the first to begin thinking about evolutionist long before Darwin came out with his book on the \"Origins of Species\". He had many theories such as that everything evolves from one basic creature and then breaks off into more diverse species (Haberman (Hab.), 171). His theory was that social, political, and intellectual movements were caused by the development from the homogeneous to the heterogeneous. Spencer once stated, \"If the advance of man towards greater heterogeneity is traceable to the production of many effects by one cause, still more clearly may the advance of society towards greater heterogeneity be\n\nSocial Darwinism is a quasi-philosophical, quasi-religious, quasi-sociological view that came from the mind of Herbert Spencer, an English philosopher in the 19th century. It did not achieve wide acceptance in England or Europe, but flourished in this country, as is true of many ideologies, religions, and philosophies. A good summary of Social Darwinism is by Johnson:\n\nJohn Stuart Mill and Immanuel Kant in my opinion was two great scholars with two great but very different views, on morality. John Stuart strong beliefs was named Utilitarianism. Simply stated Utilitarianism is the belief in doing what is good specifically for the greater good of the masses/everyone not just someone.\n\nThe first advocate of the social Darwinism theory had a major impact on the American society as a whole, starting from economic bases, to the big business minds of the time. In the United States, Spencer gained considerable support among intellectuals and some businessmen, including steel manufacturer Andrew Carnegie, who served as Spencer’s host during his visit to the United States in 1883. The most prominent American social Darwinist of the 1880s was William Graham Sumner, who on several occasions told audiences that there was no alternative to the “survival of the fittest” theory. Critics of social Darwinism seized on these comments to argue that Sumner advocated a “dog-eat-dog” philosophy of human behavior that justified oppressive social policies. Some later historians have argued that Sumner’s critics took his statements out of context and misrepresented his views."
