        "text": "Herbert Spencer: Social Darwinism in Education Herbert Spencer (1820-1903) was known as one of the leading Social Darwinists of the 19th century. An English philosopher, Spencer declined an offer to attend Cambridge University and instead gained much of his higher education through reading. As a Social Darwinist, Spencer helped gain acceptance of the theory of evolution which also became the basis for most of his books and teachings. The principle of evolution believed in the process whereby all things change from the simplest of forms to the most complex. It was Herbert Spencer who actually coined the phrase \"survival of the fittest\" which depicted a constant struggle amongst the species. As a result of this continual struggle, the stronger species survived and multiplied while the weaker species perished. His work \"Synthetic Philosophy\" applied this evolutionary process to all branches of knowledge specifically biology, psychology, sociology and ethics. Spencer was an agnostic who believed that the only way to gain knowledge was through a scientific approach. He felt that religion was a futile attempt to gain knowledge of the unknown. Spencer wanted to replace the theological systems of the Middle Ages with his philosophical system which stated that all knowledge could be placed within the framework of modern science. Science was the only way to gain \"useful\" knowledge. It was through this \"scientific\" knowledge that people learned to live in society. Spenser perceived society to be a progression of small homogeneous groups evolving into large complex groups over an extended period of time. This theory was proven true through the Industrial Revolution. Industry rose dramatically during this time accompanied by specialized professions. People uprooted from their small towns and farmlands and moved to these industrial areas to find work. This migration eventually led to the emergence of large cities. Spencer used his Social Darwinism in all aspects of society - social, political, economic, and education. Spencer was a noted non-conformist who detested authority and strongly emphasized individualism. In Spencer's work \"Social Status\", he stated that individual freedom was extremely important and that the government should play a limited role in society especially in the schools. He did not believe in the public school system. His major criticism of the school system was that it did not prepare children to live in society. Instead, Spencer believed in the private school system which competed for the brightest students. Because of his belief in competition, conflict and struggle, Spencer felt that the most exemplary schools would eventually acquire the best teachers and students. Spencer, not surprisingly, stressed the importance of the sciences in the schools. Learning should be a sensory experience where a student interacts within his/her environment; a slow, gradual, and inductive process. Children should be encouraged to explore and discover which would allow them to acquire knowledge naturally. Education should also be a pleasant experience for children with the least restrictions possible. Rote memorization and recitation were strongly opposed. A student should only engage in those activities that would ultimately allow him/her to survive in society. Special emphasis was placed on the physical, biological, and social sciences while English grammar and literature were believed to be outdated. Spencer became one of the major proponents of modern curriculum theory. He created quite an uproar in England with his curriculum theory because the major focus of education continued to be the Latin and Greek languages and literature. In his work \"What Knowledge is of Most Worth?\" Spencer stated that this question needed to be answered before any curriculum was chosen or any instruction commenced. Once this question was answered, it should be made certain that the curriculum aid in advancing survival and progress. To achieve this advancement Spencer believed that there were five activities necessary in curriculum. These activities assisted in self preservation, performance of occupations, child-rearing, social and political participation, and recreation and leisure. Once again, the main goal was to teach subjects that would contribute to successful living. Spencer's ideas concerning curriculum were widely accepted in the United States where change was not resisted. Education today continues to be influenced by Spencer's Social Darwinist theories. In fact, his curriculum activities based on human needs are still being implemented in one form or another. His influences are still felt as education continues to discuss voucher systems for private schools, the smaller role of government in education, and in the stressing of teaching skills that will assist students in becoming individuals who contribute to the good of society. Several of Spencer's works are being utilized in today's most prestigious universities. His \"Principles of Biology\" is a text at Oxford University. His \"Principles of Psychology\" text can be found at Harvard. The \"Study of Sociology\" is Spencer's work used not only as a textbook at Yale, but was the textbook used for the first course in Sociology in the United States. Sociology became a discipline in the United States because of Spencer's impressive work. References: Foundations of Education, Ornstein & Levine Educational Philosophy, Edward J.
