        "text": "the name Social Darwinism was used for the first time in 1887 by Herbert Spencer, an elitist philosopher.He maintained(=sosteneva) that strong members of society will survive while the weak ones perish. Spencer’s work borrowed from Charles Darwin’s theory of evolution.\n\nSocial Darwinism applies Charles Darwin’s theories on nature to society, declaring that the strong and powerful will eventually outlive the weak. Spencer believed that it was wrong to help anyone weaker than yourself, as this would aid the survival of people that the laws of nature state should die.\n\nHis theory had important effects on society:\n\nColonialism and Imperialism\n\nThe theory of Social Darwinism was used to justify acts such as colonialism, where the people of one territory will claim the territory of others, suppressing the indigenous people. It also excused the similar act of imperialism, in which one country extends control and power over another, not necessarily through settlement. For many Social Darwinists, if the natives of a country could not fend off the military of another, then they were unfit to survive. Even the Holocaust was defended by the ideas of Social Darwinism. Adolf Hitler justified the mass murder of the Jewish people during World War II as purging inferior genetics.\n\nConfusion\n\nHerbert Spencer’s thoughts on Social Darwinism began before Charles Darwin’s book, “The Origin of Species,” was even published. But when Darwin’s theories were made public, Spencer adapted his own ideas to those of natural selection. Darwin believed that the strong survive and will outlive the weak. Spencer took these ideas further, claiming that human beings with financial, technological and physical power will live on, while others are inferior and will die out. As the theories have many similarities, not least in their names, it can cause confusion on where Darwin’s theories end and Spencer’s begin. Despite Spencer applying Darwin’s thoughts to the human race, Charles Darwin only theorized on nature, not society.\n\nCondividi:\n\nMi piace Caricamento..."
