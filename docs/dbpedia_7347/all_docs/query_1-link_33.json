        "text": "History has not been kind to Herbert Spencer. If he is remembered at all today, it is probably for his steadfast allegiance to laissez-faire economics and the associated doctrine of Social Darwinism (Hofstadter 1955). For that, he is not only recalled but also derided. In a recent book, for example, Peter Bowler (2003:301) cannot resist reminding his readers that Spencer's ideas \"were welcomed with enthusiasm by the robber barons who masterminded the development of American industry in the late nineteenth century.\"\n\nBut while Spencer cannot reasonably be held responsible for the uses to which his outmoded doctrines were put, neither can it be denied that he adhered to them. However, he has also been branded with charges of which he can be absolved. One often reads, for example, that Spencer was a typical Victorian. Just what that means is not always spelled out, but in general, calling someone a \"Victorian\" implies that he stood foursquare behind Queen and country, regardless of the circumstances. But as we shall see, Spencer resoundingly cleared himself of these charges.\n\nDuring Victorian times, England was at the height of its colonial expansion, a practice toward which Spencer was unalterably opposed. Indeed, he repeatedly offered stinging indictments of colonialism, as when he railed against \"the aggressive tendencies displayed by [the British] all over the world—sending, as pioneers, missionaries of 'the religion of love,' and then picking quarrels with native races and taking possession of their lands\" (Spencer 1926, vol. 2:375). Again, in a letter to Algernon Swinburne, he called for a \"scathing exposure of the contrast between our Christian creed and pagan doings, our professed philanthropy and our actual savagery\" (Duncan 1908b, vol. 1:293).\n\nPointing specifically at British colonial adventures in Africa, Spencer lamented \"the cowardly conquests of bullet and shell over arrow and assegai, which demoralizes one side while slaughtering the other\" (Spencer 1893:193). And finally, Britain's instigation of the Boer War at the [End Page 246] close of the 19th century greatly saddened Spencer and led him to declare, more than once, \"I am ashamed of my country\" (Duncan 1908a:449).\n\nAnother supposed attribute of \"Victorianism\" was the belief that England during Queen Victoria's reign was the culminating stage toward which cultural evolution had been pointing and, once reached, no further advance could be expected. Even anthropologists, who might well have delved more deeply into Spencer's writings before leveling such a charge, generally failed to do so. Thus, with Spencer primarily in mind, Julian Steward (1956:69) wrote that \"the 19th-century school of cultural evolutionists—mainly British—reasoned that man had progressed from a condition of simple, amoral savagery to a civilized state whose ultimate achievement was the Victorian Englishman.\" And, according to Ralph Linton (1936:314), \"since the actual history of most cultures was unknown,\" the British evolutionists \"assumed that the institutions characteristic of Victorian England . . . represented the last evolutionary stage.\" Adding to this chorus, Anthony Leeds (1974:464) affirmed that for Spencer, \"social conditions, like those of Victorian England, represent the ultimate in human achievement.\"\n\nThe facts, however, show otherwise. Writing in The Study of Sociology, Spencer (1891) made it abundantly clear that by no means did he consider Victorian England to be the pinnacle of civilization, never to be surpassed:\n\nThe social states toward which our race is being carried, are probably as little conceivable by us as our present social state was conceivable by a Norse pirate.\n\n[1891:120]\n\nThe changes which have brought social arrangements to a form so different from past forms, will in future carry them on to forms as different from those now existing.\n\n[1891:122]\n\nAnd again Spencer affirmed: \"After observing how the processes that have brought things to their present stage are still going on, not with a decreasing rapidity indicating approach to cessation, but with an increasing rapidity that implies long continuance and immense transformations; there follows the conviction that the remote future has in store, forms of social life higher than any we have imagined\" (1891:399–400).\n\nErroneous allegations about Spencer thus continue to abound..."
