        "text": "Social Darwinism is the belief that only strong social groups would survive, while weaker social groups would eventually disappear. This ideology was tied up in some extremely racist arguments, and was actually used by Nazis during WWII to justify their murderous behaviors.\n\nIs Social Darwinism a logical application of Darwin's theory or an outrageous perversion of it?\n\nSocial Darwinism is considered an outrageous perversion of Darwin's theory of evolution. While Darwin's theory describes how species evolve through natural selection, Social Darwinism applies these concepts to human societies, arguing that competition and survival of the fittest should dictate social policies. This ideology has been widely discredited as it ignores the complexity of human society and ethics.\n\nWhat year did Social Darwinism start?\n\nSocial Darwinism emerged in the late 19th century, gaining popularity in the 1870s and 1880s. It was influenced by Charles Darwin's theory of natural selection and was used to justify various social, political, and economic ideologies.\n\nWas social darwinism studied by Emile Durkheim?\n\nNo, Emile Durkheim did not specifically study social Darwinism. He is known for his work in sociology, focusing on topics such as social integration, religion, and suicide. Social Darwinism was a theory that applied Darwin's principles of natural selection to society, which was more commonly associated with thinkers like Herbert Spencer.\n\nAccording to the theory of social Darwinism the government should?\n\nAccording to the theory of social Darwinism, the government should not intervene in the natural selection process of society. This theory suggests that only the strongest and most capable individuals should survive and thrive, without government interference."
