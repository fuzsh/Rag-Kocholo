        "text": "Darwinism’s and evolutionary theory’s encroachments into politics have been, generally, infelicitous. Darwin’s own thinking bears the imprint of the high colonial era he inhabited and his intellectual trajectory was marked not only by its ideational conceits, but its material practices, as much of its scientific travel—including Darwin’s stint aboard the Beagle—contributed more or less directly to European expansionism.Footnote 1 This colonial context inflected not only his perorations on evolutionism and human civilization, in The Descent of Man, but also worked its way back into the theory of natural selection. “The practices of colonialism that Darwin encountered as a young man,” Tony Barta observes, “were embedded in the vocabulary of his most influential work and its reception” (Reference Barta2005, 119).Footnote 2 Darwin’s ideas spilled across colonial borders in another way: between colonizing societies and colonized subjects. If he spent little time thinking about India, the same cannot be said about the converse. Indians grappled extensively with the evolutionism that Darwin and Herbert Spencer raised to prominence in the mid-late nineteenth century, integrating it into the rising tide of the nationalist movement.\n\nThis article considers just this: the surprisingly rich conceptual language that Darwinism and evolutionism furnished for Indian anticolonialism at the turn of the twentieth century. I examine how Darwinism traversed cultural, geographical, and philosophical space to become transmuted into political arguments set against colonial rule in the subcontinent. In exposing evolutionism’s uptake in India, I investigate how, as David Scott puts it, certain western logics both shaped the political horizons of the colonized and were exploited by them. Where Scott’s investigation of the “political rationality of forms of power” (Reference Scott1999, 23) weighs “the practices, modalities, and projects” (26) sustaining colonial governance, I focus here on their ambivalences and openings, weaponized by colonial subjects to contest it.\n\nThis might seem an improbable argument, for a few reasons. First, Darwin’s evolutionary theory, in On the Origin of Species (1859), most directly addressed natural sciences. Second, social Darwinism is commonly associated with invidious race-thinking more likely to buttress imperialist chauvinisms than to resist them. Third, Darwinism—natural and social—is often framed as a Euro-American concern with little exposure in non-western contexts.\n\nThere’s some truth to all of these, but none is entirely right. Darwinism traveled far, wide, and fast, as Origin was translated and spread across the globe almost immediately following its publication, reshaping a wide range of nineteenth and twentieth century fields of knowledge within the humanities and social sciences, from late Victorian fiction (Beer Reference Beer2000; Amigoni Reference Amigoni2007), to nascent social theory and sociology (Burrow Reference Burrow1966; Gough et al. Reference Gough, Runciman, Mace, Hodgson and Rustin2008), to religious and theological doctrine (Brown Reference Brown2010; Ruse Reference Ruse2012), to liberal, utopian, socialist, anarchist, and positivist political thought (Ramnath Reference Ramnath2011; Ball Reference Ball1979; Masters Reference Masters1990; Richards Reference Richards2009). Darwinism’s currency reached well beyond the west as evolutionary theory was integrated into scientific, religious, humanistic, and social-scientific discourses in China (Pusey Reference Pusey1983), Russia (Adams Reference Adams2016), the Middle East (Elshakry Reference Elshakry2013), and India (Brown Reference Brown2012; Fischer-Tiné Reference Fischer-Tiné2014; Killingley Reference Killingley, Amigoni and Wallace1995). Finally—as I argue here—evolutionism and Darwinism served explicitly anticolonial ends in the Indian context, offering a generative theoretical lexicon to subvert the civilizational hierarchies subtending the British empire.\n\nWhile nationalists across the political spectrum drew on Darwinism and evolutionism, I focus here on Indian liberalism. This isn’t because non-liberals didn’t address it—evolutionism pervades the writings of Aurobindo Ghose, Swami Vivekananda, and others—but because I want to consider evolutionism’s impacts on liberal notions of social progress underwriting nineteenth-century imperialism.Footnote 3 My interest lies in tracking how anticolonialists marshaled Darwinism and evolutionary theory to challenge, alter, or extend the terms of liberal historicism, upending the gradualism implicit in the ever-receding horizon of Indian self-government. Darwinism and evolutionism, I argue, were made to respond to a particular decolonial dilemma: the dilemma of developmentalism, the notion of unilinear historical time rationalizing Indian political subjection (Chakrabarty Reference Chakrabarty2000; McCarthy Reference McCarthy2009; Nandy Reference Nandy1994; Pitts Reference Pitts2005; Mehta Reference Mehta1999). Historians of colonialism have documented how nationalists invoked science’s authority to address other decolonial pressures—notably, the intractable problem of grounding and consolidating a postcolonial national identity (Prakash Reference Prakash1999; Nanda Reference Nanda and Jacobsen2020). Evolutionism, I suggest, served a different (if related) purpose, deconstructing the historicism that sustained the deferral of Indian sovereignty and figured Indian development as mirroring that of the west. Drawing on Darwinism and evolutionary theory, nationalists contested imperialism’s parameters and reconceptualized progress in entirely novel, anticolonial terms.Footnote 4\n\nWhile I focus on India, the dilemma that evolutionism was pressed into resolving was not unique to it. It was, rather, a shared condition across the colonial world as anti-imperialists faced the obdurate paradox of charting a course for postcolonial independence outside the Eurocentrist terms upholding despotic rule. In the subcontinent, Darwinism and evolutionism offered a conceptual language to do just this. And as with other nationalist invocations of science, the appeal to evolutionism was profoundly ambivalent—a tool of anticolonial resistance that generated its own exclusions, tensions, and failures. This is, for Partha Chatterjee, the inescapable consequence of seeking to “open up that framework of knowledge which presumes to dominate it, to displace that framework, to subvert its authority, to challenge its morality” (Reference Chatterjee1986, 42). Darwin’s travel to India thus exposes a distinctive decolonial quandary, its syncretic negotiation in Indian anticolonialism, and the intractability of the colonial contradictions it had no choice but to confront.\n\nOf course, the problem of developmentalism has received considerable critical scrutiny in political theory’s turn to empire, as scholars have exposed the stage-based schemas – particularly in late-modern liberalism—depicting Europeans as at the apex of a universal historical-developmental trajectory (for now-classic studies, see Pitts Reference Pitts2005; Mehta Reference Mehta1999; McCarthy Reference McCarthy2009; for more recent entrants, see Williams Reference Williams2021; Beaumont and Li Reference Beaumont and Li2022; Lederman Reference Lederman2022). Generative as it has been, however, much of this literature remains within a strictly western orbit in terms of the thinkers it addresses (Locke, Smith, Burke, Kant, the Mills, Tocqueville, Bentham, Hobhouse), its theoretical concerns (liberalism, utilitarianism, conjectural or philosophical histories), and its contemporary upshot (developmentalism’s continuing entanglements with liberalism, Marxism, and critical theory).\n\nThe western emphasis has two problematic implications. First, as David Myer Temin has recently argued, taking developmentalist schemas as implicitly European “reifies a domain of contestable vocabularies as Eurocentric that actors at the peripheries reworked for their own purposes” (Reference Temin2022, 2, emphasis in original). Developmentalism’s seemingly intractable Eurocentrism is, to some extent, a product of its near-exclusive treatment in western theory; its anticolonial uptake reveals its mutability and critical potential. Second, the western focus occludes the array of non-western critiques, analyses, and responses to these exact dilemmas, by those subject to them. Indian anticolonialists developed rich theorizations of their political past, present, and future in navigating the paradoxes of anticolonial sovereignty (Sultan Reference Sultan2020) and envisioning political futures ranging from various federalisms (Mantena Reference Mantena, Bourke and Skinner2016; Sultan Reference Sultan2021; Parasher Reference Parasher2022), to autonomy within an imperial confederacy (Bayly Reference Bayly2011; Mantena Reference Mantena, Bourke and Skinner2016), to militant culturalisms (Chaturvedi Reference Chaturvedi2022; Kapila Reference Kapila2021), to communist radicalism (Kaviraj Reference Kaviraj, Roy, Pantham and Deutsch1986; Manjapra Reference Manjapra2010). Each in its own way wrestled with the dilemma of developmentalism in conceptualizing India’s progress beyond the limits of European modernity.\n\nThis article has three related purposes. First, rather than rehearsing now well-worn critiques of developmentalism’s Eurocentrism, I show how Indian nationalists negotiated the dilemma of development by denaturalizing western notions of progress, recomposing the colonial order’s temporal coordinates, and advancing their own constructive visions of independence. Treating developmentalism from the other side of the colonial divide, I argue, illuminates its protean nature and its transfiguration into the grammar of anticolonial politics. Second, I aim to contribute to scholarship on the political theory of anticolonialism attending to the specificities of colonial problematics and treating anticolonial thought as neither replicating European ideals nor merely critiquing them, but as conceptual interventions in their own right—as “political innovations and articulation[s] of alternative universalisms” not reducible to western normative languages (Getachew Reference Getachew2016, 839; see also Getachew Reference Getachew2019; Idris Reference Idris2022; Kohn and McBride Reference Kohn and McBride2011; Getachew and Mantena Reference Getachew and Mantena2021; Kapila Reference Kapila2021; Wilder Reference Wilder2015). Darwinism and evolutionism, I contend, grounded not only critiques of Eurocentrist chauvinisms, but also the (re)constructive ambitions of Indian nationalists. Finally, while South Asian intellectual history has episodically touched on Darwinism’s traces in turn-of-century nationalisms (Dalton Reference Dalton1982; Kapila Reference Kapila2007a; Sartori Reference Sartori2003; Sultan Reference Sultan2021; Bayly Reference Bayly2011; Klausen Reference Klausen2014), it has not, to my knowledge, delved into the distinctive ways that evolutionist paradigms inflected subcontinental anticolonialism, as I endeavor to do here."
