        "text": "If you want to learn more about the differences between traditional media vs. new media, you’re in the right place! We’re comparing the main differences between new media and old media here, so keep reading!\n\nHere’s everything we’ll cover:\n\nWhat is traditional media?\n\nTraditional media examples\n\nWhat is new media?\n\nNew media examples\n\nTraditional media vs. new media: What’s the difference?\n\nTraditional media vs. new media: Which is more beneficial for my business?\n\nLet’s dive in!\n\nWhat is traditional media?\n\nTraditional media, or old media, is mostly non-digital advertising and marketing methods. These are marketing methods that businesses have relied on for years. Up until very recently, these marketing and advertising styles were very effective and helped businesses just like yours make a profit.\n\nHowever, as the needs and expectations of consumers evolve, marketing has no choice but to evolve as well. This is what has led to the rise of new media and digital marketing methods — and the decrease in popularity of some traditional methods you know well.\n\nIt’s also led to the debate between traditional vs. digital media.\n\nTraditional media examples\n\nSome examples of traditional media include:\n\nTelevision advertisements\n\nRadio advertising\n\nPrint advertising\n\nDirect mail advertisements\n\nBillboards and off-site signs\n\nCold calling\n\nDoor-to-door sales\n\nBanner ads\n\nWhat is new media?\n\nNew media, also called digital media, consists of methods that are mostly online or involve the Internet in some sense. It usually involves digital channels that gained popularity in the last decade or so.\n\nNew media examples\n\nThese methods include:\n\nSearch engine optimization (SEO)\n\nPay-per-click advertising\n\nContent marketing\n\nSocial media\n\nEmail marketing\n\nMany of these methods have been around for several years but have only gained prominence recently. So when the topic of traditional media vs. emerging media is discussed, it’s somewhat misleading to call these methods “emerging” as very few of them are new.\n\nHaving said that, these marketing methods continue to change as time goes on. Best practices for these methods are currently dependent on their sources, as opposed to depending on the attitudes of consumers. But over time, we may see another shift as consumer feelings change toward these methods.\n\nLearn More About Digital Transformation Here!\n\nTraditional media vs. new media: What’s the difference?\n\nNow that you know the definitions of new media and traditional media, let’s compare the two terms a bit more and dive into some of their key differences.\n\nHere are five differences between new media vs. traditional media:\n\n1. Distribution and access\n\nNew and traditional media differ in how companies and individuals distribute and access them. Traditional media is usually distributed and accessed through channels like television, radio, or print.\n\nOn the other hand, new media is distributed and accessed through digital channels, like social media, search engines like Google, or email.\n\n2. Cost\n\nNew media is known for its cost-effective marketing methods. Many digital media advertisements cost less than traditional methods. Not only will you pay less for your advertisements through digital media channels, but you’ll also pay less to acquire new leads and customers.\n\n3. Audience interaction and communication\n\nAnother key difference between traditional media vs. digital media is audience interaction and communication.\n\nWith traditional media methods, it’s challenging to understand how your audience interacts with your ads and message since your ads will run on their TV or in their newspaper. Audiences can’t really communicate with your brand through your ads either. They’ll need to contact your company to be able to speak with you.\n\nHowever, new media channels make it extremely easy for your audience to interact and communicate with your brand. For example, users can click on your social media ads to navigate to the product pages on your website. They can also comment on your social media ad or reply to your email to instantly get in touch with your brand and ask questions.\n\n4. Results tracking\n\nTracking the results of your advertising and marketing campaigns also differs between new media vs. traditional media.\n\nTraditional media methods are difficult to track and see which ads and messages drive the most leads, sales, and revenue for your company since they use a non-digital channel, like print or radio.\n\nOn the other hand, new media methods are incredibly easy to track the results of your campaigns. You can view detailed information like how many people clicked on or viewed your ad, bought one of your products after viewing your ad, or called your company after receiving your email.\n\nAs a result, you can easily understand which strategies bring the most revenue to your business.\n\n5. Targeting capabilities\n\nAnother difference between digital media vs. traditional media is targeting capabilities. One of the biggest benefits of using online media channels is that you take advantage of powerful audience-targeting features.\n\nFor example, you can target your ads to users based on their age, location, interests, company industry, and more. That means you can ensure your messages and ads reach the people most likely to buy from your company.\n\nWhen it comes to traditional media, it’s much harder to target your ads to your intended audience. For example, when you promote your brand on the radio, you’ll reach multiple people listening to that channel who may or may not be your target audience.\n\nThat means you could promote your products or services to people who have no interest in them and will likely not become customers.\n\nTraditional media vs. new media: Which is more beneficial for my business?\n\nNo one can tell you which marketing methods are and aren’t worth your time and money. Since your business and audience are both unique, it’s impossible to say that something will or won’t work for you — and that applies to new media, too.\n\nAs we mentioned, many marketers are finding that traditional and outbound marketing methods are losing their effectiveness over time.\n\nIf you’ve noticed lower returns on your advertising or outbound marketing, this is likely a symptom of that decreased effectiveness. So it would be a good idea to slowly phase those methods out in favor of new ones.\n\nMany companies have found that one or two traditional media methods still work very well for them.\n\nFor example, billboards, while expensive, may help businesses gain awareness in local operating areas. And print advertising can help some companies reach markets that include those who still read books or magazines regularly.\n\nWhile often positioned against one another, traditional media and new media can offer immense value when combined with one another.\n\nThere’s no harm in continuing your current marketing methods if they are still working for you. It’s entirely possible to invest in both new and traditional media! However, with all of your marketing methods, you should pay attention to their performance and do frequent evaluations so that you can scale up or down your spending appropriately.\n\nImplement new media marketing strategies with WebFX\n\nWebFX is a full-service digital marketing agency specializing in implementing new media strategies that reach your target audience and encourage them to purchase.\n\nOur new media methods give you access to highly-targeted ad campaigns and marketing messages that reach the people most likely to purchase your products or services.
