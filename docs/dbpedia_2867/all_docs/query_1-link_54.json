        "text": "During the Great War, morale became a significant military factor and propaganda emerged as an instrument of control over public opinion and an essential weapon in the national arsenal. Covering an array of international perspectives with material from the US, Great Britain, Germany, France, Belgium and more, this digital collection provides an essential insight into propaganda and recruitment throughout this turbulent period.\n\nProfessor David Welch\n\nUniversity of Kent\n\nIntroduction\n\nRich in primary source content from world-class libraries and archives, The First World War: Propaganda and Recruitment provides an essential insight into propaganda and recruitment throughout the Great War.\n\nPropaganda, in its written and visual form, is an effective tool that employs multiple basic techniques: to exploit existing beliefs; establish authority; create fear; use humour; appeal to patriotism; to be selective and create a ‘version’ of the truth; to name but a few. The study of propaganda during the First World War becomes at once a study of the relationship between the government, the press and the public. The government’s control over the mass media and the entire propaganda machine were deemed vital in demanding the national support needed for ultimate victory. Such victory was only attainable by sustaining allied soldiers and civilians, so recruitment propaganda, appealing to the patriotic hearts and minds of many, was crucial at the very outbreak of war.\n\nThe vast and varied range of material in this resource, from aerial leaflets and atrocity propaganda to international posters, postcards, cartoons and political pamphlets, showcases the methods exploited in wartime propaganda and their paths of dissemination. Themes of recruitment, training and morale are also examined through items such as tribunal case files, Kitchener's papers, recruitment listings, training manuals and minute books of both parliamentary and local recruiting committees.\n\nThe selection of primary sources covers important themes:\n\nRecruitment and training\n\nMorale at home and on the front line\n\nDevelopment of different forms of propaganda\n\nEfforts to control public opinion through censorship\n\nPotential impact of mutinies and revolution\n\nDissension\n\nA fascinating array of document types include:\n\nPosters\n\nPostcards\n\nDiaries\n\nCartoons\n\nPhotographs\n\nLeaflets and pamphlets\n\nInstructions for the distribution of propaganda\n\nMilitary instructions\n\nExtracts from local newspapers\n\nPrinted reports\n\nMinute books\n\nPapers of the Ministry of Information\n\nPapers of the Kriegspresseamt\n\nNewsletters\n\nTribunal case files\n\nInternational Perspectives\n\nThe First World War: Propaganda and Recruitment features a wealth of foreign language material, providing an essential international dimension and promoting in-depth, comparative research.
