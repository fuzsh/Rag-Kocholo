        "text": "Jump To:\n\nModule I\n\nModule II\n\nModule III\n\nModule IV\n\nModule V\n\nThe Selection of Material for Eighteenth Century Journals\n\nModule I\n\nThe journals collected together in Eighteenth Century Journals I are illustrative of the wide range of print options available to the periodical reader of the age, and the variety of subjects covered by such works. From the ephemeral to the long-running; from the political controversies of the day to the latest gossip from London society; from the works of Coleridge in his Watchman to the anonymous offering of a never-to-be known poet: these journals provide an invaluable insight into the eighteenth-century world. The views represented within these texts are often in opposition to those of the government or other established bodies; indeed, they are often in opposition with one another. They are not homogenous, and they are, therefore, a testament to the vibrancy and variety of their time.\n\nJournals written for and by women are strongly represented in Eighteenth Century Journals I. The Female Tatler appeared in 1709 in the wake of Richard Steele’s success with the Tatler (also included here). Its content is notably less ‘improving’ than many of the later ‘conduct’ periodicals aimed at women. A scandal sheet, it contains gossip and humorous anecdotes, often at the expense of well-known London figures. Purportedly written by ‘Mrs Crackenthorpe, a Lady that knows Everything’, its racy content has suggested authorship by well-known gossip Mary Delariviere Manley. Other important female periodicals include Eliza Haywood’s Female Spectator (1744-1746), included here in its entirety. One of the first journals both by and for women, it proved immensely popular and influential. Haywood wrote articles on education, marriage and children under four pseudonyms: Mira, Euphrosine, Widow of Quality and The Female Spectator. ‘Mira’ was also the nom-de-plume under which she composed the Wife, essentially an advice manual and guide for marriage. It contains articles on such universal topics as ‘Well bearing the passions and little petulancies of a Husband’, ‘Sleeping in different Beds’ and ‘the danger of living in the same house with any Relation of the Husband’s’. Haywood, a prolific writer and editor, is also credited with authorship of the Parrot (1746), a political paper which addressed some of the more contentious issues of the day, including the ‘Forty-five’ rebellion and the cause of the Young Pretender. Her views on this issue would eventually see Haywood arrested and held in custody for seditious libel.\n\nNo less than 19 titles in Eighteenth Century Journals I deal with eighteenth-century drama. The Theatre (1720) represents Sir Richard Steele’s last venture in print journalism. It appeared two years after the revocation of his patent for the Theatre Royal, Drury Lane, after a political difference with the Duke of Newcastle. It was, as Steele admitted, intended to win him support in the dispute with Newcastle, which centered on Steele’s claims that the Duke had interfered with his management of Drury Lane in his role as Lord Chamberlain. The opposing side was not without advocates, however: in the Anti-Theatre, ‘Sir John Falstaffe’ presents strong arguments in favour of the Lord Chamberlain’s intervention in Drury Lane’s internal affairs. The Prompter, which had a short-lived daily run from October to December 1789, offers “the historical account, plot, and character of all the dramatic pieces that appear”, and in its Preface states the need for critical analysis of the theatre: “a spectator may assist at our theatrical amusements…by laying before him, with the strictest impartiality, the merits as well as the demerits of the author and the actor.” Other theatrical journals include the Rhapsodist, the Theatrical Monitor and the Actor.\n\nMany of these journals provide fascinating insights into London life – both high and low – during the period. The Covent Garden Journal (1752), edited by Henry Fielding under the pseudonym Sir Alexander Drawcansir, contains much information about city news, under subtitles such as ‘Modern History’ (a record of fashionable gatherings and gossip); ‘Proceedings at the Court of Censorial Enquiry’ (reviews of books and theatrical matters); and ‘Covent Garden’, a summary of crime news from the magistrate’s court. This latter echoed Fielding’s efforts, and those of his brother John, in establishing London’s first professional police force, the Bow Street Runners, and the ‘Police Gazette’ which circulated details of criminal activity.\n\nMany journals are a useful source for assessing attitudes towards contemporary events in a time of frequent political and religious turmoil. A number of these periodicals were written in direct response to an action of government. The Crisis and the American Crisis both refer to the American Revolution. The American Crisis is a series of pamphlets written by Thomas Paine, decrying the actions of the British and Loyalists. No. 2 starts with the famous declaration:\n\nThese are the times that try men’s souls. The Summer soldier and the sunshine patriot will, in this crisis, shrink from the service of his country; but he that stands it now, deserves the thanks of men and women. Tyranny, like hell, is not easily conquered; yet we have this consolation with us, that the harder the conflict, the more glorious the triumph.\n\nOther political controversies prompted opposing sides to iterate their arguments in print. The Plebeian and the Old Whig see Sir Richard Steele and Joseph Addison (respectively) pitted against each other in a political quarrel. In the Plebeian Steele attacked the Earl of Sunderland’s proposed Peerage Bill, which had divided the Whig party; the Old Whig offers Addison’s counter-attack on Steele, whom he termed ‘Little Dicky, whose trade it was to write pamphlets.’ The Director is written in advocacy of the South Sea scheme while Cato’s Letters (1720-1723) was written initially as a call for public justice on the managers of the South Sea Bubble and printed in the London Journal. However, Cato’s Letters was continued over three years to cover a wide range of subjects, always advocating freedom of speech and freedom from tyranny and advancing the concepts developed by John Locke. These letters proved highly popular and influential, and were reprinted as a journal in their own right many times. A generation later they were an inspiration to the American Colonists (half of the private libraries in America were said to hold a copy). This is both a testament to the power of the period’s press, and to the ongoing value of these journals as a means for contemporary understanding of eighteenth-century political and cultural life.\n\nList of Module I Journals by Subject Area (links to first volume)\n\nLiterary Journals\n\n(See also Theatrical Journals)\n\nThe Adventurer 1753\n\nThe Attic Miscellany 1789\n\nThe Bee Reviv'd 1750\n\nCato's Letters 1720-23\n\nThe Centinel 1757\n\nThe Critick 1718\n\nThe Devil 1786-87\n\nThe Eaton Chronicle 1788\n\nThe Entertainer 1718\n\nThe Flapper 1796-97\n\nThe Fool 1746-47\n\nThe Free-Thinker 1718-21\n\nThe Genius 1762\n\nGenius of Kent 1792-93\n\nThe Gentleman 1775\n\nHog's Wash 1793-95\n\nThe Humourist 1720\n\nThe Kapelion 1750-51\n\nThe London Mercury 1780\n\nThe Microcosm 1786-87\n\nThe Phoenix 1797\n\nThe Rhapsodist 1757\n\nThe Speculator 1790\n\nTerrae Filius 1763\n\nThe Tribune 1729\n\nVariety 1788\n\nThe Watchman 1796\n\nThe World 1753-56\n\nMoral and Satirical Journals\n\nThe Attic Miscellany 1789\n\nThe Busy Body 1787\n\nThe Country Gentleman 1726\n\nThe Covent-Garden Journal 1752\n\nThe Devil 1755\n\nThe Doctor 1718\n\nThe Eaton Chronicle 1788\n\nThe Flapper 1796-97\n\nThe Fool 1746-47\n\nThe Humourist 1720\n\nThe New Spectator 1784-86\n\nThe Quiz 1796-97\n\nThe Royal Female Magazine 1760\n\nThe Spy at Oxford & Cambridge 1744\n\nThe Trifler 1795-96\n\nThe World 1753-56\n\nPolitical Journals\n\nThe American Crisis 1776-80\n\nThe Anti-Union 1798-9\n\nThe Budget 1764\n\nCato's Letters 1720-23\n\nThe Controller 1714\n\nThe Country Gentleman 1726\n\nThe Covent-Garden Journal 1752\n\nThe Crisis 1775-76\n\nThe Crisis 1792-93\n\nThe Daily Benefactor 1715\n\nThe Director 1720-21\n\nThe English Freeholder 1791\n\nThe Entertainer 1754\n\nThe Fall of Britain 1776-1777\n\nThe Fish-Pool 1718\n\nThe Fool 1746-47\n\nThe Free Briton 1729-35\n\nThe Free-Thinker 1718-21\n\nGenius of Kent 1792-93\n\nHog's Wash 1793-95\n\nA Letter from J-n W-s 1764\n\nThe London Mercury 1780\n\nThe Microcosm 1786-87\n\nThe National Journal 1746\n\nThe New Spectator 1784-86\n\nThe North Briton 1764\n\nThe Old Whig 1719\n\nPig's Meat 1794\n\nThe Plebeian 1719\n\nThe Political Herald & Review 1785\n\nThe Protestant Packet 1780-81\n\nThe Scots Spy 1776\n\nThe Spinster 1719\n\nTown Talk 1715\n\nThe Tribune 1729\n\nThe Tribune 1795-96\n\nThe Wallet 1764\n\nWilkes & Liberty 1764\n\nThe World 1753-56\n\nReligious Journals\n\nThe Comedian 1732\n\nThe Christian's Amusement 1740-41\n\nThe Daily Benefactor 1715\n\nThe Entertainer 1754\n\nThe Free-Thinker 1718-21\n\nGenius of Kent 1792-93\n\nHog's Wash 1793-95\n\nThe Protestant Packet 1780-81\n\nThe Weekly History 1741-42\n\nTheatrical Journals\n\nThe Adventurer 1753\n\nThe Anti-Theatre 1720\n\nThe Attic Miscellany 1789\n\nThe Centinel 1757\n\nThe Comedian 1732\n\nThe Covent Garden Chronicle 1768\n\nThe Crisis 1792-93\n\nThe Devil 1786-87\n\nThe Genius 1762\n\nThe Gentleman 1775\n\nThe Kapelion 1750-51\n\nThe New Spectator 1784-86\n\nThe Prompter 1789\n\nThe Rhapsodist 1757\n\nThe Speculator 1790\n\nThe Theatre 1720\n\nThe Theatrical Monitor 1767\n\nThe World 1753-56\n\nBack to the Top\n\nModule II\n\nA number of titles are devoted exclusively to politics. One of the most prominent of these is Joseph Addison’s Freeholder, a paper established in 1715 to further the interests of the Whigs, then enjoying a fresh dominance in government which was to last until 1760. Although the paper was criticised by many of Addison’s contemporaries, including his collaborator Richard Steele, it was fondly remembered by Samuel Johnson in his Life of Addison, in which he commented that “his humour was singular and matchless”, while Thomas Babington Macaulay declared that “none of Addison's works exhibit stronger marks of his genius than the Freeholder”. In contrast to the Freeholder’s support of established politics, the Political Register, founded by John Almon, was an influential dissenting periodical. Almon was a prominent Piccadilly bookseller and close ally of John Wilkes who had a reputation for frequently causing offence to the government: in 1770, three years after the first volume of the Political Register had appeared, he was arrested for reprinting a letter from the anonymous dissident writer ‘Junius’ to the King. Perhaps his greatest anti-establishment act was to force the government to allow publishers to reprint parliamentary debates. Also included is the Weekly Remarks and Political Reflections, published by Isaac Dalton: in its proceedings, the Old Bailey records that Dalton was brought to trial on 12th July 1716 for “seditious libel…in Printing and Publishing a Libel, call'd Weekly Remarks, &c. in which are contain'd several Expressions, highly reflecting on his present Majesty and Government”. Dalton was acquitted, but the episode illustrates well the dangers of political journalism in this age. Other journals in this collection devoted to politics include Mercurius Politicus, an official publication edited on behalf of the ministry by Daniel Defoe and the Political Magazine and Parliamentary, Naval, Military, and Literary Journal. Many of the weekly journals and newspapers report on parliamentary proceedings: see the New London Magazine and the Morning Post and Fashionable World among others.\n\nWhile politics was of great concern to the relatively confined readership of ‘free-holders’, or eligible voters, other topics were of more general interest. Current affairs, both foreign and domestic, play a strong part in many of these journals, especially the newspapers and evening posts. The French Revolution, slavery, the freedom of the press, and American independence are all discussed; the multiples wars and skirmishes in which Britain was involved over the century are reported in detail.\n\nA number of the journals in this collection aim to propagate the immense accumulation of knowledge that was taking place in every field of learning during the Enlightenment. The Bee, Or Literary Weekly Intelligencer observed that “numerous facts, and important observations, have been published many years, without ever having come to the knowledge of those classes of men who are engaged in the active pursuit of business” and attempted to rectify this situation by presenting news of the latest scientific discoveries, philosophical treatises, and “literary essays of ingenious men”. Furthermore, it also recognised the increasing interest in foreign cultures and the cosmopolitanism that characterised Enlightenment thinking: “Nor does the editor confine his views to Britain alone….By means of the universal intercourse which trade occasions, and the general utility of this language, he hopes to be able to establish a mutual interchange of knowledge, and to effect a friendly literary intercourse among all nations.” Other such “miscellanies” included in this collection also reflect a burgeoning interest in foreign lands, particularly regarding exotic flora and fauna (for example, the New London Magazine’s account of an expedition to Botany Bay, illustrated with a kangaroo). Anthropology was an intensely popular subject, as can be seen in the Botany Bay article, the Universal Museum (“Account of the Natives of Canada and Louisiana”) and many others of these magazines.\n\nAs the success of these miscellanies suggests, there was a widening demand for knowledge in this period: an increasing number of men and women of the middle-class and aristocracy had begun to read more widely by the eighteenth-century, owing to improved printing methods and the proliferation of circulating libraries. Integral to this was the huge appetite for literature – this was of course the age in which the novel was born. Coffee houses – those famous repositories of intellectual discussion and journal readership – often kept a substantial number of the latest books for their customers’ perusal. The links between journalism and literary authorship were close: many professional novel-writers began their career in Grub Street. This collection is particularly informative in illuminating the role of literature in eighteenth-century journals, and vice versa. Several of the titles included in this collection devote themselves to summarising, excerpting and reviewing all the latest published books. Such journals as the History of the Works of the Learned and the Present State of the Republick of Letters review some of the best-known literary works of the day as well as more obscure works; revealing contemporary perceptions of literature that has now entered the established canon, and illuminating works that were valued by their contemporaries but have now been all but forgotten. As well as providing criticism, periodicals were a valuable platform for new writing. One example of a journal devoted to new writing is the Muses Mercury, which contains “Poems, Prologues, Songs, Sonnets, Translations, and other Curious Pieces, Never before Printed”, by various authors, including the Poets Laureate John Dryden and Nahum Tate, and Aphra Behn.\n\nOther important elements of eighteenth-century cultural life can be analysed through study of the journals included in this collection, including the role of drama and music. The enormous interest in the theatre is evident, with many journals devoting articles to news of the latest plays and gossip from the ‘patent’ theatres that had been granted official licences by Charles II after the banning of public entertainments during Commonwealth rule. For example, the Muses Mercury includes a summary of news “of the Opera’s and Plays now Preparing for the two Theatres, in Drury-Lane and the Hay-market.” Such articles provide a fascinating insight into the day-to-day running of such theatres, particularly with regard to the financial problems and management scandals that frequently beset these institutions. The New London Magazine is a goldmine of information about the capital’s cultural pursuits, including as it does regular “Theatrical Intelligence” as well as reprinting the latest entertainments from Vauxhall Pleasure Gardens, and reporting on the precarious opening night of the Royal Circus theatre, during which “some part of the galleries appeared to give way.” Songs and poetry set to music are also a popular inclusion in the magazines and miscellanies; one title, the Vocal Magazine, boasts of “Containing all the English, Scotch, and Irish songs, catches, cantatas, airs, glees, ballads, &c deemed any way worthy of being transmitted to posterity”.\n\nThe study of these titles offers a valuable insight into the role women played in the reading public. The Ladies Diary is clearly intended exclusively for female readership, while the Universal Museum declares itself a “Gentlemen’s and Ladies Polite Magazine”; the British Magazine is a “Monthly Repository for Gentlemen and Ladies”. However, other journals with apparently masculine interests reveal an awareness of a female audience. For example, despite the disenfranchisement of women, the Freeholder devotes eight numbers to the role of women in politics. In an article entitled “Artifices of the malecontents to draw the women into their party”, Addison warns that “it is now…become necessary to treat our women as members of the body politick…They will judge for themselves; look into the state of the nation with their own eyes; and be no longer led blindfold by a male legislature.” However, this increasing political independence is met by scepticism in the same article, as Addison complains that “when errors and prejudices are…spread among the Sex, it is the hardest thing in the world to root them out. Arguments, which are the only proper means for it, are of little use.”\n\nThis collection also offers us a rare glimpse of the more ephemeral aspects of the period. Almanacs such as Culpepper Reviv’d, and Rose’s Almanack for the Year from the Nativity…1712 provide catalogues of the year’s fairs and notable dates, while Merlinus Redivivus specialises in an astrological interpretation of the calendar. The Oeconomist advises gentlemen on the smooth regulation of household affairs and agriculture management, offering information on leases, tithes and “making Ox-head soup”. From accounts of “Country Beauties Spoilt by London Fashions” (Universal Museum) to “Curious Remarks on the Customary Time of Eating” (New London Magazine), these journals vivify the daily minutiae of 18th century life.\n\nList of Module II Journals by Subject Area (links to first volume)\n\nPolitics\n\nMercurius Politicus\n\nOld Common Sense; Or, the Englishman’s Journal\n\nThe Champion\n\nThe Con-Test\n\nThe Free-Holder\n\nThe Grumbler\n\nThe Monitor\n\nThe Political Magazine and Parliamentary, Naval, Military and Literary Journal\n\nThe Political Register\n\nWeekly Remarks and Political Reflections\n\nTheatre and Arts\n\nThe Vocal Magazine\n\nThe New London Magazine\n\nThe British Magazine\n\nThe Universal Museum\n\nMercantile and Trading\n\nB Berington’s Evening Post\n\nThe British Merchant; Or, Commerce Preserv’d\n\nNewspapers/ Current Affairs\n\nB Berington’s Evening Post\n\nOld Common Sense; Or, the Englishman’s Journal\n\nParker’s Penny Post\n\nPax, Pax, Pax; Or, A Pacifick Post-Boy\n\nSt. James’ Evening Post\n\nSt. James’ Post\n\nThe Dublin Evening Post\n\nThe Edinburgh Gazette\n\nThe Flying Post\n\nThe London Journal\n\nThe London Packet; Or, New Lloyd’s Evening Post\n\nThe Morning Advertiser\n\nThe Morning Post and Fashionable World\n\nThe Northampton Mercury\n\nThe Original Weekly Journal\n\nThe Plain Dealer\n\nThe Post Angel\n\nThe Whitehall Evening Post\n\nThe York Chronicle\n\nThe York Courant\n\nMagazines and Miscellanies\n\nThe Bee; Or Literary Weekly Intelligencer\n\nThe British Magazine\n\nThe New London Magazine\n\nA Pacquet from Parnassus\n\nThe Lay-Monk\n\nThe Medley\n\nThe Museum; Or, the Literary and Historical Register\n\nThe Oeconomist\n\nThe Post Angel\n\nThe Royal Magazine; Or, Quarterly Bee\n\nThe Universal Museum\n\nLiterature\n\nThe British Magazine\n\nCensura Temporum\n\nA Pacquet from Parnassus\n\nThe Bee; Or Literary Weekly Intelligencer\n\nThe Muses Mercury\n\nThe Museum; Or, the Literary and Historical Register\n\nThe New London Magazine\n\nThe History of the Works of the Learned\n\nThe Political Magazine and Parliamentary, Naval, Military and Literary Journal\n\nThe Present State of the Republick of Letters\n\nThe Universal Museum\n\nBack to the Top\n\nModule III\n\nEighteenth Century Journals III, like previous sections, celebrates the variety and diversity of eighteenth century publishing with a range of newspapers and magazines covering all sorts of subjects. This section, however, focuses largely on material published outside of London, including newspapers from across the British Empire, Ireland, Scotland and provincial England. This essay outlines the context of some of the colonial newspapers to help users begin their research. A subject list and a brief guide to some of the other highlights of the collection are also included.\n\nColonial newspapers were aimed at the British population across the globe and focused on current affairs, offering both local news and the ‘latest’ news from Britain and Europe, acquired through the frequent arrivals of ships from home and frequently nine or ten months out of date. They are an invaluable source of information about the political dealings, practical struggles and military skirmishes which were undertaken by the British in their efforts to control their imperial holdings in the Caribbean, India and North America.\n\nThere are four titles from Kingston, Jamaica (the Jamaica Mercury and Kingston Weekly Advertiser, later the Royal Gazette; the Daily Advertiser; and the Kingston Journal), reflecting the importance of Caribbean settlements to the British Empire in the eighteenth century. Jamaica, siezed from Spain in 1655, benefited greatly from the sugar boom in the late 1700s which ensured that it generated one of the highest incomes of any British colony. As with all the colonial newspapers included in this collection, the advertisements featured in these Jamaican titles offer fascinating insights into daily life in Britain’s colonies. Central to Jamaica’s plantation system was slave labour, and the importance of slaves to the white planters is evidenced by the high number of advertisements for runaway slaves in local periodicals.\n\nNewspapers from India include the weekly Hickey's Bengal Gazette; or, the Calcutta General Advertiser which was the first printed newspaper published in the Indian sub-continent, based in Calcutta, the East India Company's capital. The foundation of the newspaper by Irishman James Augustus Hicky is described in William Hickey’s Memoirs:\n\nIt occurred to Hicky that great benefit might arise from setting on foot a public newspaper, nothing of that kind ever having appeared…. As a novelty every person read it, and was delighted. Possessing a fund of low wit, his paper abounded with proof of that talent. He had also a happy knack at applying appropriate nicknames and relating satirical anecdotes.\n\nHicky’s personal attacks on Warren Hastings, the Governor-General, saw him indicted for libel and jailed. His incendiary views were not easily silenced, however, and the Bengal Gazette continued to be written from prison. Calcutta’s second English-language newspaper, the India Gazette, or Calcutta Public Advertiser, contains an account of Hicky’s trial (Volume 01 - 1780-1781 - Issue 33). Hicky’s attacks on Hastings, and the India Gazette’s counter-criticisms, are an interesting proof that freedom of the press was a controversial issue even within a small expatriot community governed by a monopoly:\n\nI am shocked to observe the constant endeavours of malecontents to effect a total subversion of peace and harmony amongst us. We are now at war with five or six different Powers, each of which possesses a tract of Country many degrees larger than our own, and is infinitely more populous; under these circumstances, unanimity alone can enable us to resist the torrent of destruction that has long threatened to burst on our heads. That there are in Bengal, some who are ill-affected to the true interests of their country, is, I think, evident from the many inflammatory letters and Paragraphs that have appeared in the Bengal Gazette, which seem to breathe a strong spirit of discontent. (India Gazette, or, Calcutta Public Advertiser, Volume 1, Issue 12)\n\nPrinted newspapers in Canada started life in 1752 in the British colony of Nova Scotia with the publication of the single-sheet newsletter The Halifax Gazette – in 1766 this became the four-page Nova Scotia Gazette, printed here. The newspaper continues to be printed in Halifax today under the name The Royal Gazette. The emergence of a dominant Anglo-protestant culture in Nova Scotia between the 1750s and 1780s, beginning with the Great Explusion of Acadians and continuing with the arrival of United Empire Loyalists after American Independence, is charted in the rise of English-language newpapers in Nova Scotia during this period. For example, the Royal American Gazette was first published in New York in 1777 by the Robertson brothers, but was moved to Shelburne, Nova Scotia in 1783, due to the brothers’ loyalist views, and continued publication there.\n\nIn addition to newspapers, Eighteenth Century Journals III also contains a number of journals or magazines from the UK which offered satire, poetry and opinion. This includes the long-running Spirit of the Public Journals. Described as ‘an impartial selection of the most exquisite essays and jeux d’espirits’ of the age, the Spirit of the Public Journals includes periodicals aimed at both male and female readers and published in a variety of places. It is especially strong on literature, with major Romantic authors such as James Macpherson, Wordsworth, Sir Walter Scott and Lord Byron well represented. In addition, Spirit of the Public Journals opens up a huge body of writing including plays and poetry by lesser-known and anonymous writers, helping place the well-known verse of leading writers in a broader context. The journal also offers invaluable insight into contemporary opinion towards such Romantic writers. A robust tradition of literary criticism is revealed through satire and parody: the principles of Gothic Novels are expertly satirised in such belles-lettres as ‘Modern Novels. Inscribed to the author of The Monk’, which complains that ‘a novel now…is nothing more than an old castle – and a creaking door…. Old armour – and a phantom all in white…’\n\nList of Module III Journals by Subject Area (links to first available volume)\n\nIndia\n\nHircarrah\n\nAsiatic Mirror, and Commercial Advertiser\n\nBengal Lottery\n\nCalcutta Chronicle; and General Advertiser\n\nCalcutta Morning Post Extraordinary\n\nCalcutta Friday Morning Post and General Advertiser\n\nHicky’s Bengal Gazette, or Calcutta General Advertiser\n\nIndia Gazette, or Calcutta Public Advertiser\n\nWorld\n\nMadras Gazette\n\nBombay Courier\n\nBombay Gazette\n\nCalcutta Gazette; or Oriental Advertiser\n\nIreland\n\nSligo Journal and Weekly Advertiser\n\nWestmeath Journal\n\nLimerick Journal\n\nMunster Journal\n\nWeekly Amusement; or, Universal Magazine\n\nDrogheda Journal; or, Meath and Louth Advertiser\n\nClare Journal\n\nHibernian Journal: or, Chronicle of liberty\n\nStrabane journal.

In order to explore this subtle shifting of power away from London and to follow on from Eighteenth Century Journals III, which also focuses on material published outside of London, Eighteenth Century Journals IV contains key material published in Manchester during this time of rapid industrial change and political turmoil. This essay aims to provide a contextual background to some of the newspapers included in this section. Selected highlights from the collection and a subject list are also provided.\n\nEarly eighteenth century newspapers were predominantly published in and circulated around London and were only accessible to a minority who could afford them. But, as the century progressed, a number of developments led to a dramatic increase in newspaper circulation and readership: better transport networks led to a growth in the number of provincial papers, a rising middle class benefiting from industrial progress could increasingly afford to buy newspapers and the rise in popularity of coffee houses meant that more of the lower classes had access to free newspapers. By the end of the eighteenth century, Great Britain had over three hundred different newspapers. While many of these were still published in London or contained details of London affairs, such as Bell’s Weekly Messenger, The British Critic and Memoirs of Literature, which are just a few of the London titles included in Eighteenth Century Journals IV, many newspapers covered local news in the more provincial regions of Britain. In Manchester, the rapid expansion of the newspaper press paralleled Manchester’s rise to become the first industrialized city. The majority of the newspapers contained in Section IV were published in Manchester during the period c.1750-1820. Many scholars argue that this period precluded the real industrial age that began in earnest from the mid-nineteenth century onwards. Others argue that this period was crucial in its own right because it laid the foundations and prepared the way for the height of the industrial revolution that was to come. Either way, Manchester underwent massive changes during this time, and the newspapers of the day provide a fascinating insight into how this change affected all aspects of society.\n\nThe market for cotton rapidly expanded during the eighteenth century and Manchester was well-placed to take full advantage of this. Indeed, many factors combined to make Manchester one of the world’s central marketplaces for the sale and manufacture of cotton products. Manchester was at the centre of a growing network of roads, canals, and navigable waterways which transported raw cotton and coal to and from other towns and ports like Liverpool. In conjunction with this, a long history of investment in warehouses led to burgeoning districts that provided commercial premises, such as Oswald Mosley’s Cotton Exchange built in 1729, from which to store, display and trade goods. Towards the end of the eighteenth century, the production of cotton benefited from technological innovations in engineering and machine making and, as a result, it became increasingly mechanized and factory based. This all led to a dramatic increase in urban and economic growth: population figures grew as Manchester’s wealth creation potential attracted both workers and merchants and the commerce and finance sector became as important to Manchester’s economic status as the manufacturing industries. By the end of the eighteenth century Manchester had become a town of national significance.\n\nDespite all of this growth and success, Manchester, like many other growing industrial towns, had no representation in Parliament during the eighteenth century. As a result of this, newspapers played an important role in representing and shaping public opinion and they increasingly had the power to influence political and public matters. Newspapers were the only reputable source of information about parliamentary proceedings, news and debates until parliamentary official records (Hansard) became available. With the rise in number of provincial newspapers, people were more informed about parliamentary matters than ever before, even though many were unable to vote. Thus the newspapers became a major force behind the political reform movement that took place in Manchester between 1715 and 1830, which saw increasing numbers of disenfranchised people trying to influence parliament via petitions.\n\nIn the late eighteenth century an anti-slavery movement led by the Society for the Abolition of the Slave Trade swept Britain. In 1788, a mass-petitioning campaign was initiated in Manchester in an attempt to end the slave trade. Hundreds of towns followed Manchester’s lead and it became the largest nationwide mobilisation of campaigners ever organized. That same year the first legislation was passed to regulate the slave trade. Another campaign was then undertaken in 1792 with a record number of petitions being presented to the House of Commons. An article in the Manchester Herald on the abolition of the slave trade from 1792 conveys, using strong rhetoric, the campaign’s hopes for victory:\n\nThough the triumph of reason and humanity has been deferred, we have reason to think it will not longer be delayed. A cause which concerns all mankind, by resting on the principles of universal benevolence, and which daily requires strength and numbers, cannot fail of obtaining a speedy victory, over the unfeeling avarice which wishes to conceal, and the timid ignorance which dreads to unfold the true interests of humanity. (Manchester Herald, Issue 1)\n\nPost-1850 other cities and industries gradually caught up with Manchester and its comparative economic and industrial importance declined. Newspapers, on the other hand, were firmly established in Manchester and many other provincial areas and their numbers and influence continued to rise throughout the nineteenth century.\n\nList of Module IV Journals by Subject Area (links to first available volume)\n\nManchester\n\nBritish Volunteer, and Manchester Weekly Express\n\nCowdroy's Manchester Gazette\n\nHarrop's Manchester Mercury\n\nManchester Chronicle: or Anderton's Universal Advertiser\n\nManchester Herald\n\nManchester Journal\n\nManchester Telegraph\n\nPatriot\n\nPrescott's Manchester Journal\n\nPr[oposed?] new Manc[hester weekly?] W.

The Ladies Museum was launched in 1798 as The Lady’s Monthly Museum, the first two volumes of which are also included in this section.\n\nThe Lady’s Magazine was issued monthly and is significant for its longevity in a market - the periodical press - where publications were largely short-lived. Its longevity and ability to survive and endure beyond a number of its rivals in a competitive market is not its only remarkable feature. In the intellectual climate of the coffee house and the largely male dominated literary society it produced, and in the face of a print culture, which, for the most part, delivered newspapers, periodicals and journals for a male readership, The Lady’s Magazine is a forerunner of the emergence of not only a targeted female readership but also provides a platform for women, as both contributors and consumers, to engage in the literary discourse of the eighteenth century.\n\nThe Lady’s Magazine, as suggested by its title, marketed itself directly to a middle-class female readership. The magazine’s primary objective was to provide a regular periodical that contained material designed for the entertainment and improvement of women in a manner accessible to the \"house-wife as well as the peeress\" (The Lady’s Magazine, August 1770). It covered a wide range of topics and genres: fashions, poetry, remarks on society, biographies of prominent men and women, culture, travel writing, moralising essays, short stories, serials, translations, advice, recipes, medicinal receipts, theatrical and literary reviews, domestic and foreign news, births, deaths and marriages. The textual content was often complemented with elegant engravings, music sheets, embroidery patterns, and later, colour fashion plates.\n\nAlthough the title of the magazine suggests a specific gendered readership, men also read and contributed to the magazine. Indeed, it was launched by John Coote and the bookseller John Wheble in 1770. Much to Wheble's displeasure, Coote sold his share in the magazine to George Robinson and Josh Robertson within months of the launch. This proved quite the controversy and in July 1771, the matter was brought to trial. You can read the fascinating account of the trial in the July 1771 issue. Whilst it is widely accepted that the editors of the magazine were men, it is certain that women regularly contributed and did comprise a proportion of the readership.\n\nOne of the unique aspects of the Lady’s Magazine is its heavy reliance on its readers for content. Men and women alike contributed essays, serials, poetry, short stories, moralising tales, travel writing and other forms of written content, free of charge. This gave women a platform for recognition and an outlet for their literary creativity. The opportunity to engage in this created reader-writer community also enabled women to enter the male dominated world of print and to engage in a wider community that was separate from their daily sphere of domesticity; a feminised space in an otherwise male-dominated genre, had been created.\n\nWomen thus became active consumers and producers, readers and writers of the magazine. Journalism had yet to establish itself as a profession which enabled amateur writers, of both sexes, to see their work in print. The heavy reliance on contributions perhaps also helped to create a magazine that offered a variety of authorial voices and diverse content; it was a miscellany in the truest sense of the word. Heavy reliance on contributions for the majority of content did, however, have some drawbacks. Editors were often frustrated by unfinished serials or low quality authorship. They vented their frustration in the “To our Correspondents” column which appeared in the opening pages of each issue. The following chastisement appears in the February 1780 issue:\n\nThe translator of Rousseau’s Emilia will excuse us for repeating the complaints of a numerous groupe of correspondents, on account of the intermission of her translation; and as we cannot much longer bear the clamours of our friends on that account, she will excuse us if we snatch the inactive pen out of her ink-stand, and employ it in completing what she is in honour bound to complete.\n\nThe words “honour” and “obligation” were often used against writers who ceased their contributions, leaving serials unfinished and editors and readers alike, frustrated.\n\nOver the course of its sixty-two year run, readers of the magazine today can trace shifts in public opinion, taste, culture and political climate, making the Lady’s Magazine an insightful and enlightening source for the study of eighteenth and early nineteenth century social and cultural history. The magazine also provides research opportunities for students and scholars interested in eighteenth century print for women and the role that women played, as contributors and consumers, in the literary marketplace.\n\nWhilst the Lady’s Magazine offered a diverse cross-section of subjects for its readers to eagerly consume, it cannot be said that its scope was all-inclusive or specialised; it was a miscellany after all. Thus, other magazines that were more specialist in their approach, and directed to either an exclusively female readership or to readers of both sexes, also had a place in the periodical market. Alongside The Lady’s Magazine, we have also included such titles as The Lady’s Philosopher and The Gentleman and Lady’s Palladium. These are more specifically mathematical and scientific in their approach and contain enigmas, tables showing planetary motions, challenging mathematical exercises and scientific news.\n\nRepresentative of the periodicals available for specifically literary and artistic preferences are the Poetical Entertainer, the Poetical Magazine, The New Novelist’s Magazine and the Artist’s Repository and Drawing Magazine. The literary periodicals contain short stories, biographies, comedies, tragedies and poetry whilst the Artist’s Repository is a fascinating insight into the instruction available to amateur artists and the methods employed and materials used to develop artistic skill.\n\nTaken together, Eighteenth Century Journals V offers the perfect guide to the sensibilities of both genders in the age of Jane Austen, and is an invaluable source for the study of eighteenth and early nineteenth century society and culture.\n\nBack to the Top\n\nThe Selection of Material for Eighteenth Century Journals\n\nThe purpose of Eighteenth Century Journals is to make available digitally for the first time unique or extremely rare eighteenth century periodicals. The primary aim is to promote a truly broad representation of the culture of print journalism in the eighteenth century. Therefore, there was no selection of titles on the basis of subject matter or theme; or by how well-known a title was, either by contemporary readers or scholars of today. Instead, the periodicals included in this project have been carefully chosen to convey the eclectic nature and evolution of the publishing world between 1685 and 1835.\n\nModule I provides digital versions of content originally in Adam Matthew Publication’s microfilm project Eighteenth Century Journals, from the Hope Collection at the Bodleian Library, Oxford. We have enriched the original content with a further nineteen titles requested by scholars, also taken from the Hope Collection.\n\nModule II continues the series and is based on the holdings of the Harry Ransom Humanities Research Center at the University of Texas, Austin, which contains one of the finest collections of rare 17th and 18th century British periodicals in the world. The starting point for selection was British Newspapers and Periodicals 1632-1800, a descriptive catalogue of the early periodical holdings at the University of Texas, compiled by Powell Stewart in 1950. The selection process was then widened to include additional titles accessioned after Powell Stewart’s original inventory, and items from the Queen Anne list of serials at the Center.\n\nIn response to the encouragement of scholars and librarians, Module III focuses on journals published outside of London. A group of titles were selected from Canada, the Caribbean and India from British Library Newspapers at Colindale. Further journals were then added from Cambridge University Library which has a large number of rare titles published in many cities and towns around Ireland. A number of important journals produced in Edinburgh, Canterbury and Cambridge were also included from the Cambridge holdings.\n\nThis commitment to publishing unique and rare newspapers and periodicals from outside of London continues with Module IV. Key material was selected from Chetham’s Library in Manchester and focuses predominantly on Manchester as an emerging city during a time of momentous change and growth. To supplement this, selected periodicals, including some European journals, were sourced from the Brotherton Library at the University of Leeds.\n\nIn Module V we have included the full run of The Lady’s Magazine (1770-1832) in response to encouragement from scholars. As no single library holds a complete set, we have pieced together the entire run from three libraries, the British Library, Birmingham Central Library and Cambridge University Library, and one private collection. The Lady’s Magazine is an insightful and enlightening source for the study of eighteenth and early nineteenth century social and cultural history and a major source for scholars of gender, social and literary studies. To complement the Lady’s Magazine, we have also included a selection of periodicals that are social, cultural and literary in scope from Cambridge University Library and Liverpool John Moores University Library.\n\nAll of the titles in this portal have been carefully screened against other eighteenth century academic resources to ensure that there is minimal overlap. Resources checked include: Primary Source Media’s microfilm collection Early English Newspapers; Chadwyck-Healey’s Early English Books Online (EEBO); Gale’s 19th Century British Library Newspapers, Eighteenth Century Collections Online (ECCO) and The Burney Collection; and Proquest’s British Periodicals."
