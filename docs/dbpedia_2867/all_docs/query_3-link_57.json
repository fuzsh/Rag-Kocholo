        "text": "Digital channels are online platforms and digital communication tools used to distribute information or provide services. Not only are they used as a tool to communicate and interact with customers, but they can also help businesses promote and sell goods and services. In addition, digital channels are a valuable source of data that can be collected and analyzed to improve business processes.\n\nIn this article, we’ll discuss the different types of digital channels, as well as the advantages and disadvantages of the most popular ones.\n\nCategories of digital channels\n\nPaid media\n\nThere are four groups according to the PESO model (Paid, Earned, Shared, Owned).\n\nPaid advertising on search engines, social networks, affiliate platforms, and other digital platforms. For example, paid advertising on Google.\n\nEarned media\n\nAll online mentions of a brand, whether in reviews, articles, comments, or social media streams, are earned media. For example, the Netpeak Journal features customer case studies with brand mentions.\n\nShared media\n\nThis is a separate category of shared media. It includes any content about your brand that is published by other brands or users on social media.\n\nOwned media\n\nThis includes all of the brand’s own digital assets: websites, blogs, social media accounts, podcasts, online radio, and digital television. For example, the Netpeak site.\n\nCheck out our list of digital marketing terms. You can then read Netpeak Journal articles with confidence and ease.\n\nTypes of digital marketing channels\n\nLet’s take a look at eight of the most common digital marketing channels.\n\nSEO (Search Engine Optimization)\n\nSEO is a set of activities that aim to improve the visibility of a website in search results. For example, SEO may aim to rank a website higher in Google search results, which receives 81.95% of all user queries.\n\nAccording to Profitworks, the average SEO campaign has an ROI of 275%. In other words, for every dollar spent on SEO, you can expect a return of $2.75.\n\nSEO campaigns have certain pros and cons.\n\nPPC (pay-per-click)\n\nThis type of search engine advertising involves paying for each click on an ad.\n\nPPC advertising\n\nPPC is a type of search engine advertising where an advertiser pays when users click on ads. There are two types: search and topical.\n\nFor search ads, the user will see the \"Sponsored\" icon in the corner of the ad.\n\nTopical advertising displays ads on multiple websites that have advertising partnerships. For example, when a user searches for car information on a popular site, they will see an ad at the same time.\n\nThe PPC advertising channel has its advantages and disadvantages.\n\nTargeted social media advertising\n\nYou can highly customize your ads for Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, LinkedIn, TikTok, and YouTube. How effective is targeted social media advertising?\n\nDespite its popularity, this advertising channel has its positive and negative aspects:\n\nSMM (social media marketing)\n\nSMM is the use of social media platforms, such as Facebook, Instagram, TikTok, Twitter, and LinkedIn, to create and promote content to achieve marketing goals.\n\nCurrently, the total number of social media accounts is almost equal to the total number of Internet users in the world.\n\nEmail marketing\n\nServices and products can be promoted through manual and automated (triggered) mailings, such as emails, SMS, and push notifications.\n\nOptinmonster research confirms that marketing emails influence the purchase decisions of 59% of customers. According to Campaign Monitor, every dollar invested in effective email marketing returns $38 to the company.Here are its pros and cons.\n\nContent marketing\n\nCreate and distribute useful audio, video, and text materials to attract potential customers and retain the loyalty of existing ones.\n\nThis type of digital marketing is useful for companies whose audience is end-users (B2C), as well as those who create services and products for other companies (B2B).\n\nMobile marketing\n\nMobile marketing activities are aimed at selling goods and services via mobile phones, smartphones, and tablets.\n\nMobile e-commerce is a huge market, and it accounts for more than $3.4 trillion of retail e-commerce sales.\n\nDigital TV\n\nDigital TV differs from analog television in the high quality of the digital signal and personalized settings for each viewer. This includes advertising settings.\n\nInfluencer marketing\n\nThis is a form of social media marketing involving endorsements and product placement from opinion leaders (influencers).\n\nChoosing the right digital channel\n\nIf your business is in an active growth and development phase, SEO website development and PPC are usually effective ways to quickly generate sales and return on investment. Social networks like Instagram and TikTok also work well for certain types of businesses, for instance, beauty salons.\n\nNext, you need to analyze your competitors. Research which online platforms they are present on and where they attract the target audience the most. Then, you can test these channels, see how effective they are for achieving your KPIs, and analyze the costs. Also, pay attention to platforms where your competitors are absent — there is a certain probability of finding opportunities for growth.\n\nHow to measure the effectiveness of digital channels\n\nTo measure the results of your advertising efforts, you have to analyze KPIs and costs.Here are some metrics for measuring results.\n\nSite traffic: unique visitors, page views, time spent on site, etc.\n\nConversions: the number of users who performed the desired action (purchase, subscription, form submission, etc.).\n\nROI (return on investment): the ratio of profit to marketing costs.\n\nCAC (cost per acquisition): the marketing cost to acquire a customer.\n\nCR (conversion rate): the percentage of total visitors who convert.\n\nROAS (return on advertising spend), which is important for measuring the effectiveness of advertising campaigns.\n\nCosts can be analyzed in the following categories.\n\nAdvertising: the cost of an advertising campaign in each digital channel.\n\nContent: the cost of creating content for digital channels, including text, images, video, and audio.\n\nTechnical infrastructure: costs of hosting, software, mobile application development, etc.\n\nPersonnel: salaries for employees, freelancers, or digital agency services.\n\nConclusions\n\nDigital channels are online platforms and digital communication tools used to distribute information or provide services. There are four types of digital channels:\n\nPaid mediaPaid advertising on search engines, social media, affiliate platforms, and other digital platforms.\n\nEarned media.
