        "text": "The Texas entrepreneurial spirit has always attracted the most innovative minds of the forward-thinking Digital Media production industries. Since the early 1980s, with groundbreaking companies like Texas Instruments and id Software, Texas has played a major role in the technology and video game industries and continues to grow as a hub for all types of Digital Media production including: animation, VFX (visual effects), video games, and XR (extended reality).\n\nNot only do these industries support and augment each another, they continually converge with traditional TV and film in new and exciting ways such as virtual production—the real-time integration of live action filming and virtual backgrounds using the same software used to create detailed video gaming worlds. The Texas Film Commission has long understood the fundamental importance of Digital Media to Texas’ moving image industries as a whole. Take a deeper dive into these individual industries and explore our Digital Media resources below.\n\nTable of Contents:\n\nDigital Media Industries\n\nAnimation\n\nVFX (Visual Effects)\n\nVideo Games\n\nXR (Extended Reality)\n\nDigital Media Resources\n\nCommunity, Networking & Employment\n\nTexas Creators\n\nFinancial Incentives & Grants\n\nAnimation\n\nAnimation refers to a broad range of filmmaking techniques in which images are manipulated in order to create motion—whether that be with hand-drawn techniques, CGI (computer-generated imagery), or stop motion just to name a few.\n\nTexas is home to countless animation studios spanning the state that produce both award-winning and popular content that is seen by audiences around the globe. Be sure to check out our filmography, which contains many of the innovative projects created by Texas-based animators.\n\nVFX (Visual Effects)\n\nVFX refers to the process by which live action footage is integrated with generated imagery (digital or optical effects) to create people, places, or things that look realistic, but would be dangerous, expensive, impractical, time-consuming, or impossible to capture on film.\n\nTexas has a long history of groundbreaking filmmakers looking to bend, break, and create their own cinematic rules using these technologies to create the impossible. Films like Spy Kids, and Alita: Battle Angel utilize trailblazing VFX techniques to blend the real and unreal, while projects like A Scanner Darkly and Waking Life use rotoscope animation to create alternative worlds, showing film off in whole new ways.\n\nVideo Games\n\nVideo Games refer to any software-based game that involves a user controlling and manipulating imagery on a screen. From there, video games vary wildly in terms of style, mode, and user input. These can be anything from classic standalone/arcade-style games, to PCs and consoles, to mobile phones—and anything in between.\n\nSince the 1980s, Texas has played a major role in both the video game and greater technology industries. Some of the earliest blockbuster computer games—Doom, Age of Empires, Wolfenstein 3D, Duke Nukem 3D—were produced in North Texas along with one of the first viral smartphone games, Words with Friends. The video game industry, whether AAA or indie projects, continues to thrive across the state. To see a list of Texas-made games, visit our Gameography.\n\nXR (Extended Reality)\n\nXR (Extended Reality) is an umbrella term that encompasses three different technologies: Augmented Reality (AR), Mixed Reality (MR), and Virtual Reality (VR), all of which alter a user’s vision by adding varying degrees of digital elements to their physical environment. AR simply overlays digital elements into a user’s vision, thereby “augmenting” it. MR takes it a step further and allows for digital elements to actually interact with physical ones; for instance, a digital ball could simulate bouncing off of a real table onto the floor. VR is the most immersive as it completely blocks out a user’s physical reality with a virtual one. Typically, head and hand movements are tracked using either internal or external sensors to simulate moving and interacting with the completely digital space.\n\nThe technology that powers XR experiences continues to evolve and expand, just like the projects being developed here in Texas. While many XR projects created in Texas are gaming-oriented, use cases for XR are expanding rapidly beyond entertainment. In healthcare, doctors are using XR to view fully 3D-representations of scanning imagery, while architects are using it to digitally build and even “step inside” future plans of buildings that used to be only blueprints. In education, teachers are using XR to not only help students learn complex STEM subjects, but they’re also using it for virtual field trips.\n\nTexas Film Commission Digital Media Resources\n\nCommunity, Networking & Employment\n\nDigital Media Friendly Texas (New!) — A new program designed for Texas communities to attract Digital Media business opportunities.\n\nDigital Media Newsletter (New!) — Sign up for Digital Media news, resources, jobs, and events straight to your inbox!\n\nDigital Media Events Calendar (New!) — Stay up to date on statewide Digital Media events ranging from gaming tournaments to technology summits to educational workshops.\n\nDigital Media Job Hotline (Updated!) — A list of open video game, animation, XR, and VFX positions in Texas.\n\nIndustry Organizations — Want to get involved?
