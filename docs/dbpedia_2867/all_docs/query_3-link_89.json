        "text": "As a millennial marketer, I can tell you quite a bit about the internet—we practically grew up together!\n\nNowadays, the internet and marketing go hand in hand, so you need to know what digital marketing is and how to use it if you want to meet your audiences where they're at—online!\n\nIn 2024, there are 2.71 billion online shoppers, a third of the world's population—underscoring the need for a strong digital presence. With that in mind, I'm here to discuss all things digital marketing. Keep reading to learn more.\n\nWhat is digital marketing?\n\nWhy is digital marketing important?\n\nTypes of Digital Marketing\n\nWhat does a digital marketer do?\n\nInbound Marketing vs. Digital Marketing: Which is it?\n\nDoes digital marketing work for all businesses?\n\nHow to Do Digital Marketing\n\nDigital Marketing Examples\n\nHow does a business define digital marketing?\n\nDigital marketing is vital for your business and brand awareness. It seems like every other brand has a website, and if they don't, they at least have a social media presence or digital ad strategy.\n\nOur 2024 State of Marketing Survey found that Social media is the highest-return marketing channel and will see the most growth in 2024.\n\nOverall, digital marketing is defined as using numerous digital tactics and channels to connect with customers where they spend much of their time: online.\n\nThe best digital marketers have a clear picture of how each digital marketing campaign supports their overarching goals.\n\nDepending on the goals of their marketing strategy, marketers can support a larger campaign through the free and paid channels they have available.\n\nA content marketer, for example, could create a series of blog posts that generate leads from an ebook.\n\nA social media marketer might help promote those blogs through paid and organic posts on the business's social media accounts, and the email marketer could create an email campaign to send those who download the ebook more information on the company.\n\nThere are a few major benefits of digital marketing:\n\n1. You can focus your efforts on only the prospects most likely to purchase your product or service.\n\nDigital marketing allows you to identify and target a highly-specific audience with personalized and high-converting marketing messages.\n\nFor instance, you might use social media targeting to show ads to a certain audience based on variables like age, gender, location, interests, networks, or behaviors.\n\nAlternatively, you might use PPC or SEO strategies to serve ads to users who've shown interest in or searched for specific keywords related to your product, service, or industry.\n\nUltimately, digital marketing helps you conduct the research necessary to identify your buyer personas and refine your strategy to ensure you’re reaching prospects most likely to buy.\n\n2. It's more cost-effective than outbound marketing methods.\n\nDigital marketing helps you track campaign performance day to day, so you know which channels are performing well and which aren’t. This information helps you optimize your campaign budgets for high ROI.\n\nA digital marketing strategy allows you to pivot continuously, ensuring you never waste money on channels that don't perform well.\n\nFor instance, if you work for a small business with a limited budget, you might try investing in social media, blogging, or SEO – three strategies that can give you high ROI even with minimal spending.\n\n3. Online marketing evens the playing field within your industry and allows you to compete with bigger brands.\n\nIf you work for a small business, it's likely difficult for you to compete with the major brands in your industry, many of which have millions of dollars to invest in campaigns.\n\nFortunately, there are plenty of opportunities to outrank the big players through strategic digital marketing initiatives.\n\nFor instance, you might use long-tail keywords to create high-quality content that ranks on search engines. Search engines don’t care which brand is the biggest, but it does care about prioritizing content that resonates best with target audiences.\n\n4. Digital marketing is measurable.\n\nOne of the biggest benefits of digital marketing is that it gives a start-to-finish view of all the metrics that matter to your company — including impressions, shares, views, clicks, and time on the page.\n\nUnlike most offline marketing efforts, digital marketing allows marketers to see accurate results in real time.\n\nIf you've ever put an advertisement in a newspaper, you'll know how difficult it is to estimate how many people flipped to that page and paid attention to it. There's no surefire way to know if that ad was responsible for any sales at all.\n\nOn the other hand, with digital marketing, you can measure the ROI of pretty much any aspect of your marketing efforts.\n\nHere are some examples:\n\nWebsite Traffic\n\nWith digital marketing, you can see the exact number of people who have viewed your website's homepage in real time by using digital analytics software available in marketing platforms like HubSpot.\n\nYou can also see how many pages they visited, what device they were using, and where they came from, amongst other digital analytics data.\n\nThis intelligence helps you prioritize which marketing channels to spend more or less time on based on the number of people those channels drive to your website.\n\nWith digital marketing, you can identify trends and patterns in people's behavior before they've reached the final stage in their buyer's journey, meaning you can make more informed decisions about how to attract them to your website right at the top of the marketing funnel.\n\nContent Performance and Lead Generation\n\nImagine you've created a product brochure and posted it through people's letterboxes — that brochure is a form of offline content. Unfortunately, you have no idea how many people opened your brochure or threw it straight into the trash.\n\nIf you have that brochure on your website, you can measure how many people viewed the page it’s on, and you can use a form to collect the contact information of those who downloaded it.\n\nIt’s twofold: you measure how many people engage with your content and generate qualified leads when people download it.\n\nAttribution Modeling\n\nAn effective digital marketing strategy combined with the right tools and technologies allows you to trace all of your sales back to a customer's first digital touchpoint with your business.\n\nWe call this attribution modeling.\n\nIt allows you to identify trends in the way people research and buy your product, helping you to make more informed decisions about which parts of your marketing strategy deserve more attention and which parts of your sales cycle need refining.\n\n5. It’s easier to adapt and change an online marketing strategy.\n\nA great benefit of digital marketing is the ease with which you can change your strategy. Adapting a digital marketing strategy is much easier than other, more traditional forms of marketing, like mailers or billboard advertising.\n\nFor instance, if an online ad isn’t delivering as expected, you can quickly adjust it or pause it to yield better results.\n\n6. Online marketing can improve your conversion rate and the quality of your leads.\n\nAs digital marketing makes it simpler to measure your marketing efforts, this makes improving your conversion rate simpler as well. Being able to measure the effectiveness of each tactic helps you develop better strategies.\n\nContinuously refining your methods improves your conversion rate. Investing in online marketing ensures that everything is optimized for the highest amount of conversions.\n\nAdditionally, not all leads offer the same value for your business. Digital marketing allows you to target a specific audience, which will yield higher-quality leads that are more likely to become customers.\n\nConnecting your business with the most valuable leads will directly improve your conversion rate.\n\n7. You can engage audiences at every stage with digital marketing.\n\nEngaging your audience as early as possible is essential. Making a connection at the first stage of the buyer’s journey helps push the lead through the customer funnel.\n\nUsing digital marketing allows you to accomplish that from start to finish and at every point in between.\n\nOnline channels allow you to follow the entire buying journey of your customers. Understanding and analyzing how customers are move and operate is important for converting leads.\n\nDigital marketing allows you to track them through that process. And, even if they don’t convert in the early stages, it at least helps ensure they have made a connection with your business.\n\nHere's a quick rundown of some of the most common digital marketing tactics and the channels involved in each one.\n\n1. Search Engine Optimization (SEO)\n\nThis is the process of optimizing your website to \"rank\" higher in search engine results pages, thereby increasing the amount of organic (or free) traffic your website receives.\n\nThe channels that benefit from SEO include websites, blogs, and infographics.\n\nThere are a number of ways to approach SEO in order to generate qualified traffic to your website. These include:\n\nOn-page SEO: This type of SEO focuses on all of the content that exists \"on the page\" when looking at a website. By researching keywords for their search volume and intent (or meaning), you can answer questions for readers and rank higher on the search engine results pages (SERPs) those questions produce.\n\nOff page SEO: This type of SEO focuses on all of the activity that takes place \"off the page\" when looking to optimize your website. \"What activity not on my own website could affect my ranking?\" You might ask. The answer is inbound links, also known as backlinks. The number of publishers that link to you, and the relative \"authority\" of those publishers, affect how highly you rank for the keywords you care about. By networking with other publishers, writing guest posts on these websites (and linking back to your website), and generating external attention, you can earn the backlinks you need to move your website up on all the right SERPs.\n\nTechnical SEO: This type of SEO focuses on the backend of your website, and how your pages are coded. Image compression, structured data, and CSS file optimization are all forms of technical SEO that can increase your website's loading speed — an important ranking factor in the eyes of search engines like Google.\n\nFor a real-life example on how to successfully implement SEO into your digital marketing strategy, check out our case study on Canva here:\n\n2. Content Marketing\n\nThis term denotes the creation and promotion of content assets for the purpose of generating brand awareness, traffic growth, lead generation, and customers.\n\nWant to learn and apply content marketing to your business? Check out HubSpot Academy's free content marketing training resource page.\n\nThe channels that can play a part in your content marketing strategy include:\n\nBlog posts: Writing and publishing articles on a company blog helps you demonstrate your industry expertise and generates organic search traffic for your business. This ultimately gives you more opportunities to convert website visitors into leads for your sales team.\n\nEbooks and whitepapers: Ebooks, whitepapers, and similar long-form content helps further educate website visitors. It also allows you to exchange content for a reader's contact information, generating leads for your company and moving people through the buyer's journey.\n\nInfographics: Sometimes, readers want you to show, not tell. Infographics are a form of visual content that helps website visitors visualize a concept you want to help them learn.\n\nAudio or visual content: Television and radio are popular channels for digital marketing. Creating content that can be shared online as a video or heard on the radio by listeners can greatly broaden your potential audience.\n\nStumped?

Social Media Marketing\n\nThis practice promotes your brand and your content on social media channels to increase brand awareness, drive traffic, and generate leads for your business.\n\nIf you're new to social platforms, you can use tools like HubSpot to connect channels like LinkedIn and Facebook in one place.\n\nThis way, you can easily schedule content for multiple channels at once and monitor analytics from the platform as well.\n\nOn top of connecting social accounts for posting purposes, you can also integrate your social media inboxes into HubSpot, so you can get your direct messages in one place.\n\nThe channels you can use in social media marketing include:\n\nFacebook\n\nX\n\nLinkedIn\n\nInstagram\n\nSnapchat\n\nPinterest\n\nMany marketers use these social media platforms to create viral campaigns. Partnering with a popular content creator or participating in a trend that resonates with a wide audience is a viral marketing strategy.\n\nThe purpose is to create something shareworthy in the hopes that it will organically spread across a social media channel.\n\nDon't know how to get started with social media marketing?

Pay Per Click (PPC)\n\nPPC drives traffic to your website by paying a publisher every time your ad is clicked.\n\nOne of the most common types of PPC is Google Ads, which allows you to pay for top slots on Google's search engine results pages at a price \"per click\" of the links you place. Other channels where you can use PPC include:\n\nPaid ads on Facebook: Here, users can pay to customize a video, image post, or slideshow, which Facebook will publish to the news feeds of people who match your business's audience.\n\nX Ads campaigns: Here, users can pay to place a series of posts or profile badges to the news feeds of a specific audience, all dedicated to accomplishing a specific goal for your business. This goal can be website traffic, more X followers, tweet engagement, or even app downloads.\n\nSponsored Messages on LinkedIn: Here, users can pay to send messages directly to specific LinkedIn users based on their industry and background.\n\nPPC can be hard to grasp at first, so we've created a beginner-friendly guide to get you started. Download it below:\n\nDownload This Guide\n\n5. Affiliate Marketing\n\nThis is a type of performance-based advertising where you receive a commission for promoting someone else's products or services on your website. Affiliate marketing channels include:\n\nHosting video ads through the YouTube Partner Program.\n\nPosting affiliate links from your social media accounts.\n\nThis is part of the relatively new wave of influencer marketing. Creating a campaign using influencers can be a highly effective form of affiliate marketing. Finding the right content creators can take your digital campaign to the next level.\n\n6. Native Advertising\n\nNative advertising refers to advertisements that are primarily content-led and featured on a platform alongside other, non-paid content.\n\nBuzzFeed-sponsored posts are a good example, but many people also consider social media advertising to be \"native\" — Facebook advertising and Instagram advertising, for example.\n\n7. Marketing Automation\n\nMarketing automation refers to the software that automates your basic marketing operations. Many marketing departments can automate repetitive tasks they would otherwise do manually, such as:\n\nEmail newsletters: Email automation doesn't just allow you to automatically send emails to your subscribers. It can also help you shrink and expand your contact list as needed so your newsletters are only going to the people who want to see them in their inboxes.\n\nSocial media post scheduling: If you want to grow your organization's presence on a social network, you need to post frequently. This makes manual posting a bit of an unruly process. Social media scheduling tools push your content to your social media channels for you, so you can spend more time focusing on content strategy.\n\nLead-nurturing workflows: Generating leads, and converting those leads into customers, can be a long process.You can automate that process by sending leads specific emails and content once they fit certain criteria, such as when they download and open an ebook.\n\nCampaign tracking and reporting: Marketing campaigns can include a ton of different people, emails, content, webpages, phone calls, and more. Marketing automation can help you sort everything you work on by the campaign it's serving and then track the performance of that campaign based on the progress all of these components make over time.\n\n8. Email Marketing\n\nCompanies use email marketing as a way of communicating with their audiences. Email is often used to promote content, discounts and events, as well as to direct people toward the business's website.\n\nThe types of emails you might send in an email marketing campaign include:\n\nBlog subscription newsletters.\n\nFollow-up emails to website visitors who downloaded something.\n\nCustomer welcome emails.\n\nHoliday promotions to loyalty program members.\n\nTips or similar series emails for customer nurturing.\n\nLearn more about email marketing with our free guide:\n\nDownload This Guide\n\n9. Online PR\n\nOnline PR is the practice of securing earned online coverage with digital publications, blogs, and other content-based websites. It's much like traditional PR but in the online space.\n\nThe channels you can use to maximize your PR efforts include:\n\nReporter outreach via social media: Talking to journalists on X, for example, is a great way to develop a relationship with the press that produces earned media opportunities for your company.\n\nEngaging online reviews of your company: When someone reviews your company online, whether that review is good or bad, your instinct might be not to touch it. On the contrary, engaging company reviews helps you humanize your brand and deliver powerful messaging that protects your reputation.\n\nEngaging comments on your personal website or blog: Similar to how you'd respond to reviews of your company, responding to the people reading your content is the best way to generate productive conversation around your industry.\n\nIf you don't have a dedicated PR team, it can be hard to get started. Luckily, we've got you covered. Download our free PR kit below:\n\nDownload This Guide\n\n10. Inbound Marketing\n\nInbound marketing refers to a marketing methodology wherein you attract, engage, and delight customers at every stage of the buyer's journey.\n\nYou can use every digital marketing tactic listed above throughout an inbound marketing strategy to create a customer experience that works with the customer, not against them.\n\nHere are some classic examples of inbound marketing versus traditional marketing:\n\nBlogging vs. pop-up ads\n\nVideo marketing vs. commercial advertising\n\nEmail contact lists vs. email spam\n\n11. Sponsored Content\n\nWith sponsored content, you, as a brand, pay another company or entity to create and promote content that discusses your brand or service in some way.\n\nOne popular type of sponsored content is influencer marketing. With this type of sponsored content, a brand sponsors an influencer in its industry to publish posts or videos related to the company on social media.\n\nAnother type of sponsored content could be a blog post or article highlighting a topic, service, or brand.\n\n12. Search Engine Marketing (SEM)\n\nWhen a potential lead is searching for a product or business related to yours, it’s a great opportunity for a promotion. Paid advertising and SEO are two great strategies for promoting your business to capitalize on those future leads.\n\nSearch engine marketing is another way to increase website traffic by placing paid ads on search engines. The two most popular SEM services are Bing Ads and Google Ads.\n\nThese paid ads fit seamlessly on the top of search engine results pages, giving instant visibility. This is also an example of effective native advertising.\n\n13. Instant Messaging Marketing\n\nMarketing your products through messaging platforms is a fast way to reach potential leads, even for those who haven’t offered up their cell phone number.\n\nFor example, you can send messages directly to a mobile phone via text or on platforms like Facebook Messenger or WhatsApp. It’s a simple way to let your audience know about flash sales, new products, or updates about their orders.\n\nIf your customers have questions or need more information, it’s also a convenient way for them to connect to customer service. You should also consider implementing live chat on your website here.\n\nThis way, first-time website visitors will have a quick and easy way to reach out in case they have any questions about your products or services, while you get to promptly offer the details necessary to solve the visitor’s query — details which may lead to an on-the-spot conversion.\n\nThe digital marketer focuses on each channel's key performance indicators (KPIs) to properly measure performance. For example, a digital marketer in charge of SEO might measure their website's organic traffic.\n\nAt small companies, one person might own many digital channels and tactics described above, while larger companies typically have a specialist focused on one or two brand channels.\n\nHere are some examples of these specialists:\n\nSEO Manager\n\nMain KPIs: Organic traffic\n\nSEO managers work to rank a business on Google SERPs.\n\nUsing various SEO strategies, this person might work directly with content creators to ensure the content is high-quality and up to Google’s standards, even if the company also posts this content on social media.\n\nContent Marketing Specialist\n\nMain KPIs: Time on page, overall blog traffic, YouTube channel subscribers\n\nContent marketing specialists are digital content creators. They might keep track of a blogging calendar, or develop a content strategy that includes video.\n\nThey often work with people in other departments to ensure products and campaigns are supported by promotional content on all digital channels.\n\nSocial Media Manager\n\nMain KPIs: Follows, Impressions, Shares\n\nA social media manager's role depends on each company and industry. But above all, social media managers manage social media by establishing a posting schedule for the company’s written and visual content.\n\nThey might also work with a content marketing specialist to develop a strategy for which content to share on social media.\n\n(Note: Per the KPIs above, \"impressions\" refers to the number of times a business's posts appear on the newsfeed of a user.)\n\nMarketing Automation Coordinator\n\nMain KPIs: Email open rate, campaign click-through rate, lead-generation (conversion) rate\n\nA marketing automation coordinator helps choose and manage the software a marketing team uses to understand customer behavior and measure business growth.\n\nMany of the marketing operations described above might be executed separately, so it’s important for there to be someone who can group these activities into individual campaigns and track performance.\n\nInbound Marketing vs. Digital Marketing: Which Is It?\n\nInbound marketing is a methodology that uses digital marketing assets to attract, engage, and delight customers online.\n\nDigital marketing, on the other hand, is simply an umbrella term to describe online marketing tactics of any kind, regardless of whether they're considered inbound or outbound.\n\nDigital marketing is often compared to inbound marketing, but it doesn’t differentiate between ‘inbound’ and ‘outbound’ methods.\n\nIt’s more of an umbrella term for all marketing that involves digital communication, while inbound marketing is more of a strategy.\n\nDigital outbound tactics put a marketing message in front of as many people as possible online — regardless of whether it's relevant or welcomed.\n\nFor example, the garish banner ads you see on websites that push a product or promotion to people who aren’t necessarily ready to receive it.\n\nMarketers who employ digital inbound tactics use online content to attract their target customers by providing assets that are helpful to them.\n\nOne of the simplest yet most powerful inbound digital marketing assets is a blog, which allows your website to capitalize on the terms which your ideal customers are searching for.\n\nDoes online marketing work for all businesses?\n\nDigital marketing can work for any business in any industry. Regardless of what your company sells, digital marketing still involves building buyer personas to identify your audience's needs, and creating valuable online content.\n\nHowever, that's not to say all businesses should implement a digital marketing strategy in the same way.\n\nB2B Digital Marketing\n\nIf your company is business-to-business (B2B), your digital marketing efforts are likely centered around online lead generation, with the end goal being for someone to speak to a salesperson.\n\nThe goal of your marketing strategy might be to attract and convert the highest quality leads for your salespeople via your website and to support digital channels.\n\nBeyond your website, you'll probably choose to focus your efforts on business-focused channels like LinkedIn, where your demographic is spending their time online.\n\nB2C Digital Marketing\n\nIf your company is business-to-consumer (B2C), depending on the price point of your products, it's likely that the goal of your digital marketing efforts is to attract people to your website and have them become customers without ever needing to speak to a salesperson.\n\nYou're probably less likely to focus on ‘leads' in their traditional sense and more likely to build an accelerated buyer's journey from when someone lands on your website to when they make a purchase.\n\nThis can mean that your product features are higher up in the marketing funnel than it might be for a B2B business, and you might need to use stronger calls-to-action to inspire purchases.\n\nFor B2C companies, channels like Instagram and Pinterest are often more valuable than business-focused platforms like LinkedIn.\n\nWhat types of digital content should I create?\n\nThe kind of content you create depends on your audience's needs at different stages in the buyer's journey.\n\nYou should start by creating buyer personas (use these free templates, or try makemypersona.com) to identify what your audience's goals and challenges are in relation to your business.\n\nOn a basic level, your online content should aim to help them meet these goals, and overcome their challenges.\n\nThen, you'll need to consider when they're most likely to be ready to consume this content in line with their stage in the buyer's journey. We call this content mapping.\n\nWith content mapping, the goal is to target content according to:\n\nThe characteristics of the person who will be consuming it (that's where buyer personas come in).\n\nHow close that person is to making a purchase (i.e., their lifecycle stage).\n\nIn terms of the format of your content, there are a lot of different things to try. Here are some options we'd recommend using at each stage of the buyer's journey:\n\nAwareness Stage\n\nBlog posts. Great for increasing your organic traffic when paired with a strong SEO and keyword strategy. (You can plug your search terms into our blog topic generator to get content ideas and generate readily optimized outlines.)\n\nInfographics. Very shareable, meaning they increase your chances of being found via social media when others share your content. (Check out these free infographic templates to get you started.)\n\nShort videos. Again, these are very shareable and can help your brand get found by new audiences by hosting them on platforms like YouTube.\n\nConsideration Stage\n\nEbooks. Great for lead generation as they're generally more comprehensive than a blog post or infographic, meaning someone is more likely to exchange their contact information to receive it.\n\nResearch reports. Again, this high-value content type is great for lead generation. Research reports and new data for your industry can also work for the awareness stage, though, as they're often picked up by the media or industry press.\n\nWebinars. As they're a more detailed, interactive form of video content, webinars are an effective consideration stage content format as they offer more comprehensive content than a blog post or short video.\n\nDecision Stage\n\nCase studies. Having detailed case studies on your website can be an effective form of content for those ready to make a purchasing decision, as it helps you positively influence their decision.\n\nTestimonials. If case studies aren't a good fit for your business, having short testimonials around your website is a good alternative. For B2C brands, think of testimonials a little more loosely. If you're a clothing brand, these might take the form of photos of how other people styled a shirt or dress, pulled from a branded hashtag where people can contribute.\n\n1. Define your goals.\n\nWhen you get started with digital marketing, it's critical to identify and define your goals since you’ll craft your strategy with them.\n\nFor instance, if your goal is to increase brand awareness, you might want to focus on reaching new audiences via social media.\n\nOr maybe you want to increase sales on a specific product — if that's the case, it's more important you focus on SEO and optimizing content to get potential buyers on your website in the first place.\n\nAdditionally, if sales are your goal, you might test out PPC campaigns to drive traffic through paid ads.\n\nWhatever the case, it's easiest to shape a digital marketing strategy after you've determined your company's biggest goals.\n\n2. Identify your target audience.\n\nWe've mentioned this before, but one of the biggest benefits of digital marketing is the opportunity to target specific audiences – however, you can't take advantage of that benefit if you haven't first identified your target audience.\n\nOf course, it's important to note your target audience might vary depending on the channel or goal(s) you have for a specific product or campaign.\n\nFor instance, perhaps you've noticed most of your Instagram audience is younger and prefers funny memes and quick videos — but your LinkedIn audience is older professionals looking for more tactical advice.\n\nIn any case, having a thorough understanding of how users react to your content across different marketing channels is a must. You'll want to vary your content to appeal to each specific audience for maximized results.\n\nThis is where data becomes all the more important. You can use platforms like Google Analytics to monitor website visitor behavior or native social media analytics tools to see how your followers engage with your social posts, for example.\n\nHowever, it’s best to access all this data within the same place — it helps spot any similarities or discrepancies between audiences and see how each strategy contributes to your overall marketing goals.\n\nThis is where dedicated marketing analytics platforms, like HubSpot, come in handy. These solutions offer the tools necessary to see what content works best for each channel, examine how users move from one marketing channel to the other, as well as compare your marketing strategies’ results side-by-side.\n\nIf you're starting from scratch, however, feel free to take a look at How to Find Your Target Audience.\n\n3. Establish a budget for each digital channel.\n\nYour budget will depend on the elements of digital marketing you use.\n\nIf you're focusing on inbound techniques like SEO, social media, and content creation for a pre-existing website, the good news is you don't need a big budget at all.\n\nYou can aim to create high-quality content your audience will want to consume, where the only investment you’ll need is your time.\n\nYou can get started by hosting a website and creating content using HubSpot's CMS.\n\nFor those on a tight budget, you can get started using WordPress hosted on WP Engine, using a simple theme from StudioPress, and building your site without code using the Elementor Website Builder for WordPress.\n\nWith outbound techniques like online advertising and purchasing email lists, there is undoubtedly some expense. What it costs comes down to what kind of visibility you want to receive as a result of the advertising.\n\nFor example, to implement PPC using Google AdWords, you'll bid against other companies in your industry to appear at the top of Google's search results for keywords associated with your business.\n\nDepending on the keyword's competitiveness, this can be reasonably affordable or extremely expensive, which is why it's a good idea to focus on building your organic reach too.\n\n4. Strike a good balance between paid and free digital strategies.\n\nA digital marketing strategy likely needs both paid and free aspects to truly be effective.\n\nFor instance, spending time building comprehensive buyer personas to identify your audience’s needs and creating high-quality online content that converts them, you’ll likely see strong results despite minimal ad spend.\n\nHowever, if paid advertising is part of your digital strategy, then the results might come even quicker.\n\nUltimately, aim to build your organic (or 'free') reach using content, SEO, and social media for more long-term, sustainable success.\n\nWhen in doubt, try both, and iterate on your process as you learn which channels — paid or free – perform best for your brand.\n\n5. Create engaging content.\n\nOnce you know your audience and have a budget, it's time to start creating content for the various channels you will use.\n\nThis content can be social media posts, blog posts, PPC ads, sponsored content, email marketing newsletters, and more.\n\nTo create conversion-focused content consider using Content Marketing Software. With this software, you can utilize an AI-powered content writing tool, repurpose blog posts into content for other channels, and improve your content quality by optimizing it with built-in SEO recommendations.\n\n6. Optimize your digital assets for mobile.\n\nAnother key component of digital marketing is mobile marketing.\n\nIn fact, smartphone usage as a whole accounts for 69% of time spent consuming digital media in the U.S., while desktop-based digital media consumption makes up less than half — and the U.S. still isn't mobile's biggest fan compared to other countries.\n\nThis means optimize your digital ads, web pages, social media images, and other digital assets for mobile devices is essential.\n\nIf your company has a mobile app that enables users to engage with your brand or shop for your products, your app falls under the digital marketing umbrella, too.\n\nThose engaging with your company ovia mobile devices need to have the same positive experience as they would on a desktop. This means implementing a mobile-friendly or responsive website design to make browsing user-friendly on mobile devices.\n\nIt might also mean reducing the length of your lead generation forms to create a hassle-free experience for people downloading your content on the go.\n\nAs for your social media images, it's important to always have a mobile user in mind when creating them, as image dimensions are smaller on mobile devices and text can be cut-off.\n\nThere are lots of ways you can optimize your digital marketing assets for mobile users, and when implementing any digital marketing strategy, it's hugely important to consider how the experience will translate on mobile devices.\n\nBy ensuring this is always front-of-mind, you'll be creating digital experiences that work for your audience, and consequently achieve the results you're hoping for.\n\n7. Conduct keyword research.\n\nDigital marketing is all about reaching targeted audiences through personalized content — all of which can't happen without effective keyword research.\n\nConducting keyword research is critical for optimizing your website and content for SEO and ensuring people can find your business through search engines.\n\nAdditionally, social media keyword research can also help market your products or services on various social channels.\n\nYou'll still want to conduct keyword research even if you don't have a full-time SEO strategist. Try creating a list of high-performing keywords related to your products or services, and consider long-tail variations for added opportunities.\n\n8. Iterate based on the analytics you measure.\n\nFinally, to create an effective digital marketing strategy for the long term, it's vital your team learn how to pivot based on analytics.\n\nFor instance, perhaps after a couple of months you find your audience isn't as interested in your content on Instagram anymore — but they love what you're creating on X.\n\nSure, this might be an opportunity to re-examine your Instagram strategy as a whole, but it might also be a sign that your audience prefers a different channel to consume branded content.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps you find an older web page isn't getting the traffic it used to. You might consider updating the page or getting rid of it entirely to ensure visitors are finding the freshest, most relevant content for their needs.\n\nIn any case, having access to all of this data in the same place through platforms like HubSpot analytics can be a godsend. You can track performance across multiple channels within easy-to-digest dashboards, compare their results side-by-side, and get all the data necessary to quickly spot new opportunities and adjust your strategy.\n\nDigital marketing provides businesses with incredibly flexible opportunities for continuous growth — but it's up to you to take advantage of them.\n\nI'm ready to try online marketing. Now what?\n\nIf you're already doing digital marketing, you're likely reaching some segments of your audience online. No doubt you can think of some areas of your strategy that could use a little improvement, though.\n\nThat's why we created a step-by-step guide to help you build a digital marketing strategy that's truly effective, whether you're a complete beginner or have a little more experience.\n\nNext, let’s look at some examples of digital marketing that will be sure to inspire you.\n\n1. Lego's Rebuild the World Campaign\n\nImage Source\n\nThis is a great example of a digital marketing campaign because it says something about the brand. In this campaign, Lego takes a stance on important global issues as a way to connect with its audience.\n\nNowadays, it's becoming increasingly important for companies to discuss global issues and show alignment with their customers in that way. The major play of this campaign is to help share the brand's story and messaging.\n\nGiven that 82% of customers shop from brands that share their values, this was a good move for the toy brand.\n\nPro-Tip: Consider a cause or concern important to your target audience. Then find a way to incorporate your stance on the matter in your marketing to show viewers that you share in their values.\n\n2. Dove's Reverse Selfie Campaign\n\nImage Source\n\nAs we continue to learn how social media affects children, especially young girls, Dove decided to send a message. The Reverse Selfie campaign shows the reverse of what a teen girl did to prepare for a selfie and photoshop the picture.\n\nThe purpose is to increase awareness of how social media can negatively impact self-esteem.\n\nThis is an excellent example of what marketing content can look like when you know your audience intimately.\n\nBy knowing its audience of real women, many of them parents, Dove was able to bring light to an often overlooked consequence of the growth of social media.\n\nWhat I Like: Dove's campaign shows the importance of knowing your audience to create relatable, understandable, and compelling content.\n\n3. Jennifer Lopez's #InTheMorningChallenge\n\nImage Source\n\nIn this social media campaign, Jennifer Lopez created a dance challenge to promote her new song. With this challenge, fans would do the same dance in their pajamas and in dress up clothes.\n\nThis was a successful social media campaign as the video had over 16 million views and over 5,000 posts.\n\nUsing social media is a great way to engage your audience and get them to participate with your brand one-on-one.\n\nWhat I Like: The #InTheMorningChallenge is a great example of a challenge that is fun and simple enough for fans to participate in on their own. When creating a challenge or trend to promote your brand, remember K.I.S.S. (Keep It Simple Sweetheart).\n\n4. Always' #DayoftheGirl Campaign\n\nImage Source\n\nThis is another digital campaign focused on emotional marketing. With this campaign, Always asked their own employees what tips they would give to girls. T\n\nhe women offer their valuable insight in a way meant to inspire everyone for International Day of the Girl, an international holiday that occurs annually in October.\n\nAgain, this isn't a campaign where the product is mentioned much, but that isn't the point. The point of this digital campaign was to inspire its audience.\n\nWhat I Like: With that message, they could reach even more people, increase brand awareness, and show their audience that the brand aligns with their values.\n\n5. Topicals - Email Marketing\n\nTopicals, a skincare company, uses email marketing as part of a digital marketing strategy. The image below displays a marketing email that advertises a subscribe and save deal, where people get 20% off refills if they choose to subscribe.\n\nImage Source\n\nPro-Tip: Notice how Topicals uses bold letters and colors to emphasize their deals and CTA button. Make sure to do the same in your own emails.\n\n6. Ashley White - Affiliate Marketing\n\nAshley White is an esthetician who uses affiliate marketing. In her X profile, she includes a link to a personal Linktree page where she shares referral codes and discounts for people that shop with her codes and links.\n\nImage Source\n\nWhat I Like: As she markets herself as an ambassador for these companies, the businesses generate brand awareness as someone visiting her Linktree might be inspired to try a new brand (and an influencer recommendation can make this inspiration even more powerful).\n\n7. Samsonite - Search Engine Marketing\n\nSearch engine marketing is a great example of digital marketing, where brands bid on keywords and showcase ads for their products in SERPs when someone queries a related keyword.\n\nThe image below is an example from Samsonite, where a query for the word “luggage” surfaces various luggage options from known brands that have created ads to feature their products front and center in search results.\n\nImage Source\n\n8. Yes Williamsburg - Sponsored Ad\n\nYes Williamsburg uses native advertising within its Instagram feed to share a paid sponsorship with a local Brooklyn business.\n\nThe Reel is tagged as a paid partnership, but it appears organically in a users feed like a standard post. The ad is also in line with Yes Williamsbug’s usual content of sharing information about unique local businesses for people to try.\n\nPro-Tip: Today's audiences (especially Gen-Z) do not like to be blatantly advertised to, so creating content that feels organic and natural is more helpful than content that feels like an advertisement.\n\n9. HubSpot Blog - Content Offers\n\nContent offers are a form of digital marketing where businesses share helpful content with site visitors that it knows will benefit them.\n\nFor example, the HubSpot Blog often features content offers and learning material for people to learn more about the blog topic.\n\nFor its blog post 11 Marketing Strategies for Black Owned Businesses, readers that want to know more about developing a marketing strategy can download an ebook for further learning.\n\nImage Source\n\n10. For Keeps Bookstore - Local Business SEO\n\nA search engine optimization strategy for many local businesses is an optimized Google My Business profile to appear in local search results when people look for products or services related to what you offer.\n\nFor Keeps Bookstore, a local bookstore in Atlanta, GA, has optimized its Google My Business profile for local SEO so it appears in queries for “atlanta bookstore.”\n\nImage Source\n\nIntegrate Digital Marketing Into Your Strategy\n\nAny opportunity where you can connect to your audience is an opportunity to convert a lead or acquire a customer.\n\nDigital marketing creates so many more of those opportunities by allowing you to reach prospective buyers through a wide variety of channels.\n\nWhether it’s social media platforms, websites, text messages, or any online medium, it’s an invaluable way to promote your business, service, or product.\n\nEditor's Note: This blog post was originally published in September 2019, but was updated for comprehensiveness."
