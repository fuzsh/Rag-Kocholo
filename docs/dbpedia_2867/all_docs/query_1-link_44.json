        "text": "A collection from Washington University in St. Louis, ‘I’ll Make Me a World: African American Artists in the 20th Century’, explores the development of arts and culture during the 1900s. The Henry Hampton collection includes interviews of African American artists, writers, dancers, actors and musicians, investigating the evolution of jazz music, the development of ‘black art’, as well as the inspiration behind the conception of innovative literature, such as Alice Walker’s ‘The Color Purple’. An interview with Alice Walker, where she discusses the processes involved in writing the Pulitzer Prize-winning novel, features within the resource. A key event that recurs throughout the interviews is the Harlem Renaissance. Between the end of the First World War and the mid-1930s, Harlem became a cultural centre, bursting with artistic, cultural and social development. Often considered as the ‘rebirth’ of African American arts, Harlem became a hub for artists, musicians and authors, and all had a story to tell in the form of art, music and literature. Many of the interviewees discuss how the Harlem Renaissance contributed to the creation of a new identity, particularly Kara Walker, who discusses ‘Black art’ and the emergence of a united racial identity."
