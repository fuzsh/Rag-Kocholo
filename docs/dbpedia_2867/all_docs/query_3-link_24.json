Earned media is often considered to be the most valuable type of digital media, as it is seen as a sign of trust and credibility.\n\nThe specific types of digital media that a business or individual uses will depend on their target audience, budget, and goals. For example, a business that is targeting a younger audience may focus more on social media marketing, while a business that is targeting a more affluent audience may focus more on paid advertising.\n\nIt is important to note that the three types of digital media are not mutually exclusive. In fact, it is often most effective to use a combination of all three types to create a comprehensive marketing strategy. For example, a business may use owned media to build brand awareness, earned media to generate positive mentions, and paid media to reach a wider audience."
