        "text": "Digital Media Facilitates Social Interaction\n\nThe digital age connects people in ways that were never possible before. Because 7 out of 10 Americans are on social media, individuals may maintain friendships across different time zones, regardless of the distance between them. 50% share life milestones with their friends and family on social media.\n\nFacebook actually encourages this interaction, boosting words like “congratulations”. This helps provide users with a more engaging feed!\n\nWhat does this have to do with your business, though?\n\nSpecial moments share one thing in common: they’re all highly emotional.\n\nWhile all brands may not have a product or service that naturally lends itself to this narrative, all businesses can find a way to create a space for themselves within these special shared moments.\n\nThe goal is to have your brand shared with these milestones. This is a good way to slingshot your social media presence, thus boosting brand recognition.\n\nSocial Media and Brand Recognition\n\nSome of the motivation can stem from incentives, such as discounts. But, some of your customers may choose to share your brand because it aligns with his or her specific beliefs, allowing them to take a more public stance on values and issues.\n\nFurthermore, when consumers mention a brand in their social media posts about life milestones:\n\n45% want the brand to engage in return by liking or commenting on their content,\n\n45% hope for a discount, and\n\n30% want the brand to share his or her post.\n\nConsumers realize that brands often encourage and share content from their customers, and having your post shared by a brand is an exciting motivation to mention a brand, especially when experiencing a milestone or other significant event.\n\nAs social media’s role in our day-to-day life continues to grow, so do the opportunities for businesses to connect to consumers. Whether it’s asking their peers for recommendations, or praising one of their “holy grail” products, this generation has already started the bandwagon for recognizing and sharing the role that their favorite brands play in their lives, including major life milestones.\n\nIf your business can assess and tap into the emotions behind your audience’s behavior, you’ll better your chance of connecting and turning your audience into not only lifelong customers but also advocates for your brand.\n\nDigital Media Levels the Playing Field for Small Business\n\nWe’ve all seen it happen. A huge company comes into town and wipes out all of the small specialty shops. The only online equivalent to this is Amazon. It’s hard to compete with big-name recognition or millions of marketing dollars spent by larger companies.\n\nDigital media helps marketing for small, local stores, both in physical locations and for online selling sites. Smaller businesses can actually hold a top-ranking position using digital media and marketing tactics.\n\nWho’s to know whether the professional-looking website with provocative pictures and compelling content comes from a three-person operation or a multi-million dollar company?\n\nYou could be two blocks away or 2,000 miles away. You may not want it as a small business owner, but a global customer base is there for the taking with digital media marketing.\n\nAs we mentioned earlier, social media effectiveness boils down to engagement. This gives the small business owner a leg up on the larger competition. If a business doesn’t actively engage with its customers, it won’t have successful social media marketing.\n\nThe use of digital media platforms to promote a brand helps receive feedback from customers. And, when managed correctly using preset digital metrics, using digital media to promote your business can be an effective and cost-efficient form of online advertising.\n\nWhat Is the Difference Between Digital Media and Digital Marketing?\n\nThe difference between digital media and digital marketing is that digital marketing is the act of placing content to reach the most valuable customers. Whereas digital media is assets or content. Media refers to the digital platforms such as your website, emails, and social media channels by which you are able to convey your digital marketing.\n\nDigital marketing content can include several options, including Facebook posts, banner ads, paid search ads, etc.\n\nDigital marketing refers to getting specific information about products or services and target audiences so that ads can be placed in the most efficient and effective way for maximum profitability and ROI.\n\nDigital marketing is marketing with the help of digital media platforms and digital media. The two go hand in hand.\n\nDigital Media Marketing for Business\n\nBecause more consumers turn to technology for their shopping needs, as a business, you need to use digital marketing to reach those customers. In order to thrive, businesses must have a digital presence, whether that be on a website, using social media platforms, SEO, or, ideally, a combination of these.\n\nUsing digital marketing, you can reach a larger audience in a way that is both measurable and cost-effective. Analytics-driven digital media provides the opportunity to reach more consumers for less money than traditional marketing methods while getting to know your customer base, thus increasing brand loyalty.\n\nMost businesses that effectively use digital marketing and digital marketing services increase sales and revenue, which is ultimately what business is all about. Isn’t it?\n\nWith digital media, you can hone your marketing and target your best consumer. By employing cookies and online tracking tools, we can help you better understand what your customer wants and get them to begin positively engaging with your brand. To put it simply, digital media will boost your current marketing campaign.\n\nIf you’d like to see the health of your current website, Digital Logic offers a free SEO audit service. Digital Logic is a nationally-recognized SEO company that offers affordable SEO services."
