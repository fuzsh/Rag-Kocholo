        "text": "TRANSCRIPT\n\nLINDA O'BRIEN-ROTHE: I'm Linda O'Brien-Rothe and before I was married, Linda O'Brien. I studied ethnomusicology at UCLA in the days of Mantle Hood in the '70s, and I was interested in learning how to study, how to approach, music which I had found in Guatemala. And I was already a musician, but I did not know how to write down music that didn't conform to the five lines of the pentagram.\n\nWhat prompted you to study the music of the Tzutuhil-Maya Indians in Guatemala, Santiago Atitla’n?\n\nWell, I was working in Guatemala, at the time in Guatemala City, and I met a pastor at a meeting. I met a pastor who said, I wish I could find someone who could tell me whether my people have any songs, or have any vocal music. Because in church, they don't want to sing the Mexican music that is now coming out in the vernacular. It was just when the church went from Latin to the vernacular. And I said, that looks like a job for me, and so I went out there and looked specifically for vocal music, and that's how it all began.\n\nWhy do you think it is important for people to study this particular musical tradition?\n\nActually, this is the only study in depth that has been done of a Highland Maya group. There were two preceding investigations by musicologists. One was by Henrietta Yurchenco in the '40s and the other by Lisa Paret-Limardo de Vela in the '60s, but they are both brief and in a different area of Guatemala from the one I studied.\n\nThe town that I studied is the largest town of Maya people, period. It is mostly Mayan. They were, when I was there, about 14,000 Maya and 500 mestizo, who in Guatemala are called Ladinos-- mestizo people, Ladino people. So it is an important tradition, because it is unique. No one found-- none of the other studies found any songs. In fact, they say, what's in writing so far, is - are - 'Indians' don't have any vocal music.\n\nHow were your first weeks in the field?\n\nWell, I was there for a long time. I was there over a period of 10 years, and I got really interested when I found out that there were songs. And that nobody wanted to admit there were songs for the first several weeks, when I was asking about it. And so I knew they were esoteric and not connected with the Catholic religion, and I was really interested in finding out what these songs were.\n\nWhat did you find in the songs?\n\nWhat I found in the songs were texts that belong to a kind of-- or a literature, written literature, of the Highland Maya which is codified mostly in what is called the Popol Vuh. It's the origin story of the K'iche' Maya, another group, a very closely-related group, of Highland Maya. Poetic forms used in the Popol Vuh in a written document are still being used, improvised, by the singers that I recorded in Atitlán. I should say \"were.\" I think they are almost gone now, maybe completely. So we have a very early form of survival of pre-Colombian, probably, times of a way of inventing song texts.\n\nAnd then the guitar that they accompany themselves on is a guitar that went out of style in Spain between 1580 and 1610, and the tunes are related to the sarabande which also was popular at that time in Spain. So it turned out to be a very interesting historical study, these songs, and then the songs are the vehicle by which these Maya, the Tzutuhil-Maya transmit their culture to the next generation. They are pedagogical. They teach what the beliefs are and what the customs are. And how you conduct yourself and what you do at each liminal moment of life.\n\nWhy do you think people were hesitant to tell you about the song tradition when you first began to ask?\n\nBecause I was working in the Catholic church, and the Catholic community was taught that they had to abandon all their old ways. And so they didn't want to say-- which they finally did say-- well, there is this man who lives next door to me who does sing some songs, but I'm sure it's not what you want. And I said, yes, it is what I want. But it was because they were afraid to admit that they knew anything about it, because they had committed to leaving all that behind in order to become Catholics.\n\nDoes this tradition still exist today?\n\nWhen I was there in I think 2012 was the last time I visited, I found one singer who could still improvise and who was the brother of the main one that I recorded in the '70s. I recorded others, but their texts were not improvised. The tradition is almost dead.\n\nWhat is your motivation for preserving this tradition?\n\nI'm interested in repatriation. I think the motivation, the strongest motivation I have in preserving this tradition, is that I think that one day the people will want it back. But also, it's because I think it is a vehicle-- which is kind of a complete vehicle which I recorded, was able to capture-- of the way a people interprets and passes on the wisdom of their people and how they relate to the world. And that's what the songs and the other recordings of the shamanic prayers really communicate.\n\nWhat led to your success in compiling this collection?\n\nI think that I was welcomed. I think that I was successful in collecting this pretty esoteric tradition, because I was there working with the church for the first two years, and they had established a relationship of trust. They knew I wasn't a person who was going to harm them or whatever.\n\nThey already knew me, and when I came down from UCLA, after I had left my association with the church, and was working as an independent researcher, the main shaman befriended me. We were already friends, but I said, I want to know your traditions. I want to record your music, and he welcomed me, and I said, why would you do this? You know I used to be with the church, and sometimes the church has not been entirely friendly to your old ways. And he said, oh, because the truth has two parts. One part is the word of Jesus Christa which is what Jesus has become for them, slightly different from Jesus Christ now, in these years of adaptation. And the other part is the word of our ancestors, and you had the first one, and you've come for the other. I'll give it to you.\n\nCan you tell us about the Tzutuhil and Santiago Atitla'n?\n\nThe Tzutuhils are very tough people. They have been since anything was recorded about them. When there were in there were wars between the groups of Maya people, they were always the ones that won the-- I should say, when conquistadores came, the Tzutuhils were the ones that survived and kind of threw them out. And in the '80s, when the military tried to occupy Atitlán, the Tzutuhil people threw them out. They did not have military encampments in their town.\n\nIn the Guatemalan highlands, most Maya towns are quite small, and they're agriculturalists. Santiago Atitlán is a town of merchants. Their history is to go down to the coast and bring back coastal fruits and crops and sell it in the highlands.\n\nThey're a very cohesive group. They did not feel the need to escape the persecution during the war, the civil war of the '80s and '90s. They didn't need to escape to Los Angeles or wherever. They stayed in Atitlán and defended themselves.\n\nWhat was the experience of the Maya during the Civil War?\n\nMost of the people, when I worked in the church, we wanted to prepare the Maya for the coming disaster, which we understood was coming, the Civil War, and we wanted to give them professions. So we trained photographers. We trained teachers. We trained other people in different professions. We established a radio school, and every one of them was the first that they killed. Did experience the terror of the revolution and suffered many losses among their people. One of the priests who was at the mission when I was there-- they were all Americans from Oklahoma-- stayed after everyone else went home and was still there when I was doing my research. And he was murdered, in 1985, by the Guatemalan military backed up by the US forces that were working there. And last year, the pope declared him a saint, a martyr and a saint.\n\nWhat material features in the collection?\n\nThe collection includes the songs called Songs of the Face of the Earth usually-- they have several names-- which I was most interested in collecting as much of that as I could get. But there was also a lot of music that was public. That's pretty private music, but the public music were the marimbas that came out almost every Sunday, at every fiesta, every celebration of any kind, or party. There were always marimbas, and there were brass. There was a brass band that was quite unique and wonderful called the San Lucas Band.\n\nThere were shamanic prayers, prayers for that a shaman would say for anyone who needed a healing or a special petition, and I also recorded some Catholic church music. It was actually music that the Maya had retained since the priests left there, in the late 17th century. And it's in Latin and related to chant and in pretty old form."
