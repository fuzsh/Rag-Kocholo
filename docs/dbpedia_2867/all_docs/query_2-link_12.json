Aside from regular updates based on Adam Matthew Digital title lists, the content of the Adam Matthew Digital databases will remain the same.\n\nThe 360 KB URL changes for databases under provider Adam Matthew Digital (provider code: PRVDHG) are estimated to be completed by the end of 2022, but please keep in mind that, for consortia-specific databases, we rely on consortia to send updated title lists on various schedules, so these updates may take longer.\n\nThese database and title URL changes will begin taking effect in September 2022, with an estimated completion date of the end of December 2022:\n\nBefore September 21, 2022: http://www.[provider_database_code].amdigital.co.uk\n\nAfter September 21, 2022: https://www.[provider_database_code].amdigital.co.uk\n\nList of affected Adam Matthew Digital databases is here.\n\nActions you may need to take:"
