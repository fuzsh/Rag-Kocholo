Using digital marketing, a business can cost-effectively target an enormous audience. What’s more? The results are easily measurable. This article aims to explain various types of digital marketing and to understand how a business defines digital marketing.\n\nThose of you who understand digital marketing well, also know that the field is extremely volatile and dynamic.

What worked a few months ago, might not be relevant anymore.\n\nWhat does Digital Marketing mean for a Business?\n\n10 Types of Digital Marketing\n\nWhat does Digital Marketing mean for a Business?\n\nDigital marketing encompasses all marketing tactics and channels that use the Internet as a medium to connect to clients. Your business website, social media accounts (Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, YouTube, Snapchat), emails, blogs, and newsletters are some of the most popular means to connect to customers. They all fall under the purview of Digital Marketing.\n\nDigital marketing offers equal opportunity for growth to all businesses – big or small. It offers your business multiple ways to directly engage with clients, and also target new ones. It is the bread and butter of modern businesses, offering great returns in place of very little investment.\n\nLet’s discuss the various types of digital marketing trends that will be extremely important for the growth of businesses in the coming times. You can also take up a digital marketing strategy course free and enhance your knowledge.\n\n10 Types of Digital Marketing\n\nSearch Engine Optimisation (SEO)\n\nPay Per Click Advertising (PPC)\n\nContent Marketing\n\nSearch Engine Marketing (SEM)\n\nSocial Media Marketing\n\nInfluencer Marketing\n\nEmail Marketing\n\nMobile Marketing\n\nAffiliate Marketing\n\nAugmented Reality and Virtual Reality Marketing\n\nTop 10 Digital Marketing 2023 – Explained\n\n1. Search Engine Optimisation (SEO)\n\nSearch Engine Optimization or SEO is among the most important types of digital marketing for your business. It is the art of ensuring that your web pages or articles feature at the top of the search results of search engines like Google and Bing. The process typically involves emphasizing certain keywords or phrases within your content that align with the popular search trends on Google and Bing. The channels that benefit from SEO include websites, blogs, and infographics.\n\nFor example, if you sell chocolates and want to use SEO to target new clients, then the text on your webpage should repeatedly use words like “buy chocolate”, “buy chocolate online”, “homemade chocolate”, or “delicious chocolate online”. The frequency of these keywords and the quality of your content determine where your website/blog ranks on the Search Engine Results Pages (SERPs). The higher the ranking, the better it is for your business.\n\nHowever, it is also important that one does not go overboard with these keywords. Forcing keywords can make the copy seem unnatural, causing the overall quality of your content to drop. It is necessary to maintain the quality of your content at all times for SEO to be helpful.\n\nIt is estimated that approximately 81% of shoppers conduct online research before making any sort of purchase. If you want to reach people online and boost your sales, you need to ensure that SEO is a business priority.\n\n2. Pay Per Click Advertising (PPC)\n\nPay Per Click or PPC is the method of driving traffic to your website by paying the publisher, every time your ad is clicked. PPC is like the paid version of SEO. One of the most common types of PPC is Google Ads. It allows you to pay for top slots on Google’s SERPs. Other mediums include paid ads on Facebook, Twitter ad campaigns, and sponsored messages on LinkedIn.\n\nPPC is quite similar to Search Engine Marketing (SEM), but can also include display advertising and affiliate advertising.\n\n3. Content Marketing\n\nContent Marketing is a type of digital marketing that focuses on creating and promoting different types of content, to generate leads and sales. The content can be in the form of a blog, social media posts, videos, infographics, podcasts, etc. The content is SEO heavy and user-friendly and organically attracts new clients.\n\nYou must keep your target audience in mind if you want your content marketing to work well. Quality content not only helps boost sales, but also builds brand reputation, trust, and loyalty. All channels of digital marketing are heavily dependent on the content. SEO SEM, social media marketing, email marketing, and PPC cannot exist if one does not have business-specific content.\n\nAlso Read: Use Design Thinking to transform your workplace.\n\n4. Search Engine Marketing (SEM)\n\nAs mentioned above, Search Engine Marketing or SEM is the paid version of SEO. With the help of SEM, a company can purchase advertising space that appears on the SERPs. Creating a link between SEO and PPC is an integral part of Search Engine Marketing.\n\nIt is easy to recognize paid search results on Google. A little “Ad” sign appears at the beginning of the URL, and the search giant also puts these pages first in the search results.\n\nBy maintaining a combination of SEO and SEM, you can boost traffic to your website and increase your Click Through Rate (CTR).\n\n5. Social Media Marketing\n\nSocial media is a crucial part of the digital marketing strategy of every organization. By promoting your brand on various social media channels, you boost traffic to your website and social media pages, generate leads, and also increase brand awareness.\n\nSocial media marketing overlaps with various other forms of digital marketing such as SEO, SEM, PPC, and Content Marketing.\n\nThe channels to use for social media marketing are as follows:\n\nFacebook\n\nTwitter\n\nInstagram\n\nYouTube\n\nLinkedIn\n\nSnapchat\n\nPinterest\n\nRead also: Top 10 tools for executing your social media marketing strategy\n\n6. Influencer Marketing\n\nInfluencer marketing is one of the upcoming forms of digital marketing. It makes use of people with an enormous following on their social media accounts. Businesses can hire these influencers to promote their products/websites.\n\nThe influencer serves as your brand ambassador. He/she can post photos, videos, or feature your product on their blog or website to create brand awareness about your business. For example, before getting married to Nick Jonas, global icon Priyanka Chopra tweeted out an Amazon registry worth $14,000. She said that she had a lot of fun building a wedding registry guide with Amazon and asked her followers to take a look at her guide for inspiration. Meanwhile, Amazon pledged to donate $1,00,000 to UNICEF under Priyanka Chopra’s name.\n\nHowever, one does not need to specifically hire celebrities for influencer marketing, although a lot of big brands do it these days. If you’re a smaller brand, a popular person on social media with a few thousand loyal followers can also be used. When done right, the scope of influencer marketing is huge.\n\nAlso read: Top Career Opportunities for a Digital Marketer\n\n7. Email Marketing\n\nEmail marketing pertains to sending emails to your client base to promote the business. One way to build on email marketing is to use a newsletter. You can ask people to sign up for the newsletter when they come to your website. You could then use this platform to send them regular updates about your products and services.\n\nThe best email marketing campaigns involve a list of subscribers earned by your content, and not paid for by the company. Understand that the users who subscribe on their own, are most likely to engage with your brand, and it is them you should target properly. Email marketing can be used to create brand awareness, build a loyal clientele, and take honest feedback from your customers.\n\n8. Mobile Marketing\n\nIn the present day, people use their smartphones more than any other gadget. Their mobiles are a one-stop platform that offers all the convenience required. So, why not make use of this to target a potential client base?\n\nMobile marketing can be done through an app or SMS. Apps are increasingly popular among mobile phone users and can serve the same purpose as your website. More people might engage with your app than they do with the website. It is thus important to create a simple, user-friendly, and intuitive app. You can also send regular push notifications through the app. This will keep them engaged with your product. Meanwhile, SMS can be used to make people aware of special offers and coupons. It can also be used to target people who don’t own a smartphone.\n\nAlso Read: Mobile Marketing Guide\n\n9. Affiliate Marketing\n\nAffiliate marketing is a type of digital marketing wherein a business partners up with another business and promotes it on their website/app. Essentially, affiliate marketers sell other people’s products and receive a commission when a lead is generated.\n\nWorking with affiliates can help you to expand your reach. It can also make your marketing efforts seem more organic. For example, the Indian travel company MakeMyTrip has been running an affiliate program as part of its digital marketing strategy for years. Those interested can partner easily with the company and earn revenue whenever they help convert a lead.\n\nAlso, If you want to learn the basics of affiliate marketing, then enrol in this Affiliate Marketing Course\n\n10. Augmented Reality and Virtual Reality Marketing\n\nAugmented Reality (AR) and Virtual Reality (VR) marketing is another upcoming form of digital marketing. It involves making use of these hot fields of technology to attract clients. AR and VR marketing is expensive at the moment and one should only go for it if they have the budget and also something extraordinary to offer. For example, IKEA makes use of AR marketing and allows its customers to see how different furniture looks in their homes.\n\nAs we continue to head towards digitization, the scope of digital marketing will only go up. Most types of digital marketing techniques are interrelated and codependent on each other. A business needs to understand which one suits its long-term goal best and strategize accordingly.\n\nIf you find this article ” types of digital marketing” helpful and wish to learn more about this domain, upskill with a postgraduate degree in digital marketing today!"
