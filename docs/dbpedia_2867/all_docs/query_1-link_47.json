        "text": "Matthew Judon's social media activity makes it very clear he's unhappy with his contract situation.\n\nJust 24 hours ago, Judon posted \"Know ya worth\" after it was reported Miami Dolphins wide receiver Tyreek Hill received an extension. And that was after Judon posted \"Don't believe the lies\" when The Athletic's Dianna Russini reported the Patriots extended a contract offer to the star defender.\n\nWhen speaking to reporters at Gillette Stadium on Monday, doing so for the first time since he walked off the practice field last week, Judon had no interest in talking about his social media accounts. He shut down a specific question about Russini's report.\n\n\"We're not gonna talk about no social media,\" Judon told reporters.\n\nJudon said two weeks ago he doesn't run his social media accounts. The fact his accounts have frequently (and humorously) been used in NFL free agency makes it a bit difficult to believe, though. Nevertheless, Judon wasn't interested in the topic."
