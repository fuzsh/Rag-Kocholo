Media has always been part of our society, even when people used paintings and writings to share information.\n\nIndrė Jankutė-Carmaciu\n\nOct 23 2019 ● 7 min read\n\nTable of Contents\n\nDifferent Types of Media\n\nPrint Media\n\nBroadcasting Media\n\nInternet Media\n\nConclusion\n\nAs time passed, people came up with different modes to provide news to the public. Based on the type of medium, their role may be different, but they all exist to communicate to the audience and affect their perceptions.

For the generations of the 80s and 90s, print media was the only media of entertain. People relied on newspapers and magazines to learn everything, from recipes and entertainment news to important information about the country or the world. Print media includes:\n\nNewspapers – printed and distributed on a daily or weekly basis.

Their goal is to attract people passing by.\n\nBrochures – a type of booklet that includes everything about one company – its products, services, terms and conditions, contact details, address, etc. These online brochures are either distributed with the newspapers or hand over to people.\n\nFlyers – used mostly by small companies due to the low cost of advertising. They contain the basic information about a company, their name, logo, service or product, and contact information, and they are distributed in public areas.\n\nBroadcasting Media\n\nBroadcasting media includes videos, audios, or written content that provides important or entertaining information shared by different methods:\n\nTelevision – in the past, there were a few channels sharing various types of content, whereas now we have hundreds of TV channels to choose from. Each channel delivers a different type of content, so you have a separate channel for news, drama, movies, sports, animation, nature, travel, politics, cartoon, and religion. It’s the number one broadcasting media due to its reach to the audience.\n\nRadio – uses radio waves to transmit entertaining, informative, and educative content to the public. Due to its high reach to the audience, radio is widely used for advertising products and services. Radio is one of the oldest means of entertainment, and today people often hear it to find out the weather and traffic while commuting.\n\nMovies – film, motion picture, screenplay, moving picture, or movie has world-wide reachability. It’s the best type of mass media to promote cultures and spread social awareness. Movies have always played a huge part in the entertainment world.\n\nInternet Media\n\nNowadays, we are relying on the Internet to get the news a lot more often than traditional news sources. Websites provide information in the form of video, text, and audio. We can even choose the way we want to receive the news. Types of Internet media include:\n\nSocial networks or websites – including Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, YouTube, Tumblr, LinkedIn, Snapchat, Quora, Reddit, Pinterest, etc. They are user-friendly and widely used by people around the world. Although we can find any news here, they may be misleading because of the lack of regulations on the content shared.\n\nOnline forums - an online place where we can comment, message, or discuss a particular topic. Forums allow us to share knowledge with other people with the same interest. That’s why it’s regarded as the best platform to seek support and assistance.\n\nPodcast – a series of audios focused on a particular topic or theme. We can listen to them on a computer or a mobile phone. It’s a platform that allows anyone to share their knowledge and communicate with the world. You can browse some podcast hosting sites to see what fits your needs best.\n\nAI content – the rise of AI-generated content has disrupted the content creation and online media landscape. Plenty of blogs, videos, and more have been relying on different AI tools like ChatGPT, text to speech generators, AI art generators, content writers, and more.\n\nConclusion\n\nWe use different types of media to find out news, learn new things, and entertain ourselves. With the advance in technology, we can choose the type of media we want to use, no matter the time or place.\n\nSo, we can hear the radio while driving to work, we can watch our favorite show on our phone, and we can find out any information and news on our laptop or mobile device, thanks to the Internet. Who knows where technology can lead us in the future.\n\nPublished on Oct 23 2019\n\nWRITTEN BY\n\nIndrė Jankutė-Carmaciu\n\nIndrė is a copywriter at Whatagraph with extensive experience in search engine optimization and public relations.
