The traditional media include the print and broadcast formats, while the new media include the ever-changing digital formats, such as blogs and podcasts.\n\nNot so long ago there existed a clear distinction between the two categories. Today, they are evolving closer together. Traditional media have begun to embrace the interactive, adaptable, and social nature of new media, while new media are boosting their reputation as outlets for hard news. In fact, journalists often break new stories on Twitter before they appear on television or in a newspaper. As technology advances, traditional media and new media will resemble each other even further.\n\nExplore the graphic below to better understand the types of media.\n\nTypes of Media\n\n247\n\nMedium: What are the strengths and\n\nweaknesses of the media format?\n\nEach media format has inherent strengths and weaknesses. Social media messages, for example, are quick and efficient but prone to inaccuracies. In general, newspapers provide depth and accuracy but lack the sensory appeal of television, the interactive feature of a blog, and the rapid delivery of radio.\n\nFinally, consider the graphic below that compares various media by plotting the general reliability of the information against delivery speed."
