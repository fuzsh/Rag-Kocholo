        "text": "Research question 1—research characteristics and features\n\nYear-publication, language, and type of documents distribution\n\nFigure 1 shows the year publication distribution of digital comic, animation, and digital cartoon research. Over the last decade, this research has fluctuated with no extreme decline. The average publication was 26 documents, and five years received publications above the average. The most recent publication year of digital comics, animation, and digital cartoon research was 2022, with 38 documents (see Fig. 1). The second-largest distribution, with 36 documents, occurs in 2020. There was a rapid spike in publications - doubling - in the first year of the pandemic, namely 2019 and 2020. The percentage of total documents (%TD) and total citations (%TC) is also illustrated in Fig. 1. In 2020, the world experienced the COVID-19 pandemic, and there was a change in the learning system to online distance learning. Several institutions and grades use digital visual media and technology to support learning activities (Irfan et al. 2020).\n\nAnimation is an adequate distance teaching method and increases student motivation and participation (Azlan et al. 2020; Inangil et al. 2022). Digital comics are a popular source of reading history and science subject material that can increase students’ reading skills and motivation (Damopolii et al. 2021). Digital cartoons become increasingly popular during the pandemic, and several researchers use cartoons for their ADHD children (Jena and Devi, 2020). In addition, 2018 and 2020 were the top cited years. Citation on publication documents from 2021 to 2023 has the lowest percentage and declines yearly. Therefore, this research requires an increase in quantitative publications. Through the trends discussed above, future research can focus on digital technology that can be combined with visual media to measure student skills.\n\nEnglish is the most common language, accounting for 270 documents or 93.75%. Chinese was used in digital-visual media research with five documents and a percentage of 1.74%. Each document in French, Russian, and Turkish gets three documents published. Dutch, Italian, and Spanish were used in a small percentage of the document (less than 1%) (see Fig. 2). Many sources and publishers used English as their standard international language. For example, Springer and Taylor & Francis Ltd published their English document. However, many sources-publisher used another language to publish their research document: Chinese-Editorial and Publishing Board of JIG, Italian-Universita degli Studi di Milano, Turkish-AVES, Portuguese-Research Centre in Education, Russian-Russian Psychological Society, Spanish-Fundacion para la Investigacion Social Avanzada, and Dutch-Nederlands tijdschrift voor geneeskunde.\n\nThere are 288 digital comic, animation, and digital cartoon research documents, including 159 articles, 82 conference papers, 18 book chapters, 12 books, six conference reviews and reviews, and five documents of other types (see Fig. 3). The research documents were published from several sources (see Fig. 3). All articles and ten conference papers were published in the journal, and 61 were published in conference papers, books, and book series. Two documents were published in the trade journal.\n\nThe source publishing and subject area of digital comics, animation, and digital cartoons\n\n40% of the top sources in visual media education research are journals and conference papers (see Table 1). The remaining 20% is published through a book series with Springer Verlag as publisher. Top cited documents in journal sources have the highest number of citations: ACM Transaction on Graphics (21 citations) and Multimedia Tools and Applications (14 citations). Two journals have many scopes of research that represent the implementation of digital visual media education (see Fig. 4). In this journal, researchers discuss several topics like distance and interactive learning (Guo et al. 2020) and implementing multimedia in learning activities (Li and Lu, 2023). However, the top cited authors in this source are not included among the top authors list (see the following subsection).\n\nFigure 5 represents several subject areas in digital visual media research related to computer science. Computer science is the subject area in top sources (89 documents) and top author (see following sub-section). Other research has concreated in social sciences (66 documents), engineering (40 documents), art & humanities (31 documents), and other subject areas: medicine, mathematics, decision sciences, psychology, BMA, physics-astronomy. The development of digital visual learning media has a significant impact on education. Research has impacted science, engineering, artificial intelligence, and other fields. Computer science is more closely related to mathematics, engineering, and science than many scientific fields. While social computing investigates the relationship between social behavior and computational systems, computational social science applies computer science theory to the social sciences.\n\nThe productive author, affiliation, and countries of digital comics, animation, and digital cartoons research\n\nThe top ten authors with publications in digital comics, animation, and digital cartoons are listed in Table 2. China and Hong Kong are all research-intensive countries with many publications. China has over 4600 animation industries and creates several scientific films, promoting scientific knowledge and ideological statements with animation effects and cartoons (Zhuang, 2023). Four Chinese researchers and three Hong Kong researchers from different affiliations participated in digital visual media education research. Li, D. from China has published more than other researchers (3 documents). Yu, Y from Hong Kong got the top citation and the highest h-index, and Wang W. from the US got the first rank for his publication documents. Several researchers got their gold publication years in the last decade. 2022 is the top publication year; two authors from China and the last one from the US participated (see the previous sub-section). In addition, 80% of affiliations’ top authors are included in the top ten affiliations. The University of Tokyo ranks second in top affiliations (see Table 3).\n\nFurthermore, there are three cluster co-authorships in this scope of research: Xu’s cluster (blue), Wu’s cluster (red), and Zhang’s cluster (green) (see Fig. 6). The largest cluster (red and green) contributed are related to the smallest cluster (blue). China-Hong Kong authors dominated three clusters. Xu and Wu researched computer graphics and deep learning.\n\nThere are four affiliations and three top authors are listed in Table 3. In addition, China’s affiliation dominated this scope of research. On the other hand, Duke University and the University of Southern California have the top citations. Based on the discussion in this sub-section, the four biggest countries contributed to digital cartoons, animation, and digital comics: the US, China, Hong Kong, and Japan. The US and Japan are the top animation, cartoon, and comics industry makers. Many products from these countries were imported to China and Hong Kong.\n\nFigure 7 shows the distribution research worldwide. The dominant countries are China (48 docs) and the US (47 docs), which have top authors. In addition, The University of Tokyo and Zhejiang University contributed 23% to this scope of research. 8.64% of each document is from Hong Kong, the US, the Netherlands, and the UK. Based on Fig. 7, it is known that research on comics, animation, and cartoons still needs to be improved. For example, in the Asian region, East Asia has significantly contributed to research - South Korea, Japan, Hong Kong, China, and Taiwan. In the Southeast Asia region, only three countries participated, namely Malaysia, Indonesia, and Thailand, with each publication having six documents. In addition, the only South Asian region is India, with 15 published documents.\n\nResearch Question 2- The visualization of co-occurrence-keywords of digital comics, animation, and digital cartoons\n\nThe first top-cited document from the United Kingdom (the Queen Mary University of London and the University of Edinburgh) is about sketch images, DG methods, and deep learning. Five top-cited documents discuss various points of view and studies regarding visual media (see Table 4). Two papers discuss how to make digital visual media, such as DG methods and auto-painter. According to Li et al. (2017), implementing DG (Domain generalization) methods with photos, sketches, cartoons, and paintings presents a significant challenge for future research. Besides, Bleiker (2018) uses the cGAN model and Wasserstein distance to overcome model collapse and outperforms other image-to-image methods on various sketch datasets. Other research discusses another function of visual media, especially in politics, medicine, and disaster. Visual global politics has the function of visualizing and exploring several international events and politics as a resource to enhance students, scholars, and practitioners’ understanding (Liu et al. 2018). Bossu et al. (2018) conducted EMSC websites or the LastQuake app to reduce anxiety by providing timely information and services to eyewitnesses, potentially contributing to immediate global seismic risk reduction. The study conducted by Volante et al. (2016) suggests that virtual human appearance can affect critical emotional reactions and users’ perceptions of the virtual interlocutors. In other words, there are several clusters in visual media learning research.\n\nIn Fig. 8, six related clusters are visualized, while Fig. 9 presents the distribution of keywords used in research over the last ten years. In short, the latest research on visual media still needs to discuss more research regarding the implementation of digital technology to help create visual media and its benefits for students (changes in skills and measurement of knowledge) as users of visual learning media.\n\n1.\n\nHow to Create Visual Media (Red)\n\nCurrently, the animation is created using a computer. The animation looks more modern and has more volume (three-dimensional), high accuracy, and natural character element visualization thanks to interactive computer graphics (Wiana et al. 2018). As multimedia, text, audio, graphs, visual effects, sound effects, image texture, and interaction are all included in the animation, by the time the animation is produced, the shareability of co-participants experiences has already been established (Cantarutti, 2022). Interactive multimedia has the potential to accommodate users with a variety of learning styles and internet-based education.\n\nFigure 10 illustrates one method of creating motion graphics in visual media and e-learning (Wiana et al. 2018). 3D modeling software (Pillen and Matthews, 2022), MappleSim Software (Tsegay et al. 2022), Blender (De Vries et al. 2022), 3D printers, Sketchfab (Aristov et al. 2022), and other applications and software are frequently used to create digital cartoons, digital comics, and animation. In the previous discussion, we explained several examples of methods used by world researchers in creating their visual media. Factor and method animation, such as textures, decomposition, compression, and color, were part of the red cluster (Ding and Xie, 2020). The digital cartoons, animation, and digital comics are all types of images that require an algorithm and application or software to create (Wiana et al. 2018; Pillen and Matthews, 2022; Tsegay et al. 2022; De Vries et al. 2022; Aristov et al. 2022).\n\n2.\n\nCharacteristics of Research Sample (Green)\n\nThis cluster is focused on research sample characteristics such as adult, female, child, and male keywords. Visual media learning was used in behavior research and social science-humanities (see Fig. 11). For example, Volante et al. (2016) examines the interrelationship between visual media and social-emotional variables. The findings show that while harmful affect levels were much lower in the visually realistic condition, male participants showed higher arousal levels in all circumstances. Participants had varying responses regarding social-emotional variables such as shyness, presence, perceived personality, and enjoyment-joy. In addition, research focused on children, females, adults, and other characteristics around 2020. This cluster is also related to technology implementation and education in the next cluster.\n\n3.\n\nTechnologies to support research (Dark Blue)\n\nIn 2020, research focused on factors that go into creating digital multimedia, such as animation, cartoons, digital devices, AI and VR (see Fig. 12). Both can combine real-time and interactive visualization concepts (Chen et al. 2019; Prahani et al. 2022). Virtual reality can be applied to visualization and e-learning (Pangaribuan and Zulkarnain, 2021). Animation, comics, and cartoons are linked to deep learning, human-computer interaction, and education (see Figs. 13 and 14). As a type of multimedia digital learning, they have enabled students to use digital learning to learn anywhere and at any time (Cantarutti, 2022).\n\n4.\n\nType of research (Blue) and learning systems (Green)\n\nStudents’ participation, activity, and understanding can increase using digital visual media such as digital comics, animation, or digital cartoons (Suprapto et al. 2021; Yanuarti and Suprapto, 2021). That is related to the current condition in which devices and human activity users are integrated into technology (Prahani et al. 2022). There is currently game-based learning or gamification (Sukstrienwong, 2018). Digital visual media is also related to behavioral integrated surveys (see Fig. 15). Behavioral surveys are self-reported, subjective accounts of individual actions affecting well-being (Moss et al. 2023). They are crucial for identifying community issues, improving public awareness, and identifying potential solutions.\n\n5.\n\nAnother function animation (Purple)\n\nDigital comics, animation, and digital cartoons are most used in education research. It has recently been used as visual-digital media that increased multiple intelligence and literacy (Utomo and Ahsanah, 2020; Febriani et al. 2021; Kumar et al. 2019; Martzoukou, 2020). When learning combined with visual media, learners enjoy and are interested in watching digital media (digital cartoons, animation, or digital comics) so learners directly provide factual knowledge (Kühl, 2021). Implementing of digital media, such as digital comics, animation, and digital cartoons, is becoming more widespread (Ding and Xie, 2020). Digital comics are made in several stages to produce high-quality and compact comics. Bold colors can express more information and enhance the human visual experience (Chen et al. 2019; Chen et al. 2022). Liu et al. (2018) use visual media to improve the knowledge and awareness of students, academics, and practitioners of international events and politics."
