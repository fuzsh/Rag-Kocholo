        "text": "What are you passionate about? Running a small business or a personal brand? Are you trying to connect others with your website or design portfolio?\n\nAttention seems to be in short supply these days. Every search in a search engine or newsfeed can feel like a million voices vying for your consideration, all of which can make the prospect of promoting your own work daunting.\n\nIn the digital business landscape, it’s key that your voice cuts through that noise and connects to the people who will share your passion for your work. That’s where digital marketing enters the picture.\n\nDigital marketing describes any marketing effort a company performs on digital channels that can reach consumers on their phone, computer or tablet. Digital marketing happens on search engines, social media pages, app stores and blogs (like the one you’re reading now!).\n\nWe can’t overstate the importance of digital marketing. It’s increasingly critical in the aftermath of the COVID-19 pandemic (which led to an explosion of digital-first delivery and takeout options) and amid the rise of direct-to-consumer (D2C) brands that focus on e-commerce.\n\nBy virtually connecting businesses to customers, digital marketers also can help businesses withstand the slowdown of in-person customers. Brands that thrive sometimes consider digital marketing the rule rather than the exception.\n\nLet’s explore common types of digital marketing and what careers in the field might look like for recent graduates.\n\nWhen you look for something online through search engines, you usually encounter a page filled with links that are relevant to your search. That is the search engine results page (SERP).\n\nSearch engine optimization (SEO) is the practice of making adjustments to a website and pages to claim and secure the top position on the SERP. SEO has many moving parts that are constantly changing (especially with rapid developments in machine learning that are changing how a popular search engine works). The most common parts of any SEO strategy include on-page SEO, off-page SEO and technical SEO:\n\nOn-page SEO is the strategy of optimizing content on a website for search keywords. Search engines “read” the website and determine how well its content relates to search queries. Factors that also influence on-page SEO performance include videos, images, backlinks to other pages and links to other pages on the same site.\n\nOff-page SEO focuses on creating connections outside of a website that leads users back to it. This helps establish authority on given search queries. It often involves reaching out to other websites to connect your content with theirs.\n\nTechnical SEO’s focus is on the actual website infrastructure that hosts content. Because search engines “crawl” a website to gather information, technical SEO makes it easier for those engines to crawl the website efficiently with few errors. SEO specialists who focus on technical SEO usually optimize the website’s directory, clarifying its URL structure.\n\nWhy is SEO so important to digital marketers? Users are much more likely to click on a higher-ranked result than lower ones. In fact, 39.8% of all clicks on Google go to the link in the first position and drastically drop off for the succeeding positions. This drop-off is so extreme that only 1.6% of searchers clicked on something in the 10th position on the SERP.\n\nSEO involves helping a website’s SERP rankings improve organically (for free). Proper SEO implementation drives more traffic to websites by presenting that website as more relatable for search queries.\n\nSearch engine marketing (SEM) involves paying for advertising space on the SERP. As you perform searches, you may notice some links have designations as ads at the top of the SERP. This is part of SEM. Digital marketers pay the search engine (usually Google) to place their domains at the top position. SEM can take two main forms: pay-per-click (PPC) and display ads.\n\nPPC ads involve paying for ad space at the top of the SERP when users search for specific keywords. More valuable keywords with frequent searches are often more expensive. Less frequently searched keywords may cost less.\n\nDisplay ads usually pop up on various websites you visit and are most often hosted on specific ad-generating services like Google Ads. Companies bid for display ads on a basis of cost per thousand impressions. Impressions are the number of times ads appear in front of users. Contrast this with cost-per-click ads, which cost money regardless of whether users click on it.\n\nSocial media marketing is another pillar of digital marketing. It promotes brands through social channels, like Facebook, Instagram, TikTok and X (formerly Twitter), to reach a wider audience than it might in traditional advertising.\n\nAccording to Pew Research Center, 72% of Americans are on some form of social media. Success on these platforms has the potential to expand your brand to millions, and getting started with a social media account is generally free.\n\nThere are two main types of social media marketing: organic and paid.\n\nOrganic social media marketing focuses on free methods to grow an account’s following. This includes following other accounts and creating content that is of interest to others. A digital marketer seeking organic social media traffic might make posts with popular hashtags. This connects that post with others using that hashtag, which makes it more likely that users will visit that account.\n\nA strong social media marketing strategy builds an audience by using multiple accounts on different social media platforms. A popular video on YouTube, for example, can drive user traffic to an Instagram profile or a Facebook page. The result is a stronger brand identity and potentially more customers for your business.\n\nAs with search engines, paid social media marketing allows digital marketers to buy ad space on social media feeds. Scrolling your Facebook newsfeed or “for you” page on Instagram, you’ve likely run across promoted posts. These may relate to your interests or search history and are a way for a brand to reach an audience that may not have found it through organic means.\n\nOn social media platforms, many users have amassed large followings, usually related to a common interest. These users, known as influencers, can leverage their large followings to share a promotion with a large audience.\n\nAs part of influencer marketing, brands will reach out to influencers for promotion. This helps bring a product to a community of people who are likely to be interested in it. Health brands, for example, often work with exercise influencers to promote products or deals.\n\nAffiliate marketing is a similar marketing tactic. Instead of paying influencers to create content that promotes a purchase, companies or brands pay affiliate marketers a commission for referring customers once those customers make a purchase.\n\nEmail marketing is one of the first forms of digital marketing. It involves emailing potential customers with marketing assets to highlight the latest promotions, news, products, etc. These potential customers might have submitted their email addresses to receive updates from a specific business, or a digital marketer may have purchased a list of emails specifically for this purpose.\n\nEmail marketing is an opportunity to connect with the users most likely to be new or returning customers. Often, these users have consciously opted in to receive marketing messages, which usually indicates that they have a particular interest in a brand.\n\nEmail marketing can be beneficial in getting customers who have submitted their emails at checkout to return for another purchase. Though the potential reach is smaller compared with SEO or social media marketing, the email marketing audience is generally more enthusiastic about the brand.\n\nContent marketing focuses on creating and sharing relevant and valuable assets with a brand’s audience. It complements the other types of digital marketing and is a particularly critical aspect of on-page SEO.\n\nContent marketing encompasses everything from blog posts to videos to informative graphics. Its common feature is that the content can be hosted on a website and shared on different channels. Content marketing translates a brand’s identity into assets that can be accessed, understood and shared among an audience.\n\nStrong content marketing consistently produces content that is valuable to potential customers. This might mean doing in-depth research for a blog, creating video content that’s novel and engaging, or developing images that users can share on social media. Content marketing can improve brand awareness across channels, funnel SEO traffic to a website and increase sales.\n\nSome roles in this field include copy editors and copywriters.\n\nMobile marketing is an evolution of SMS marketing, through which companies target advertising to consumers through text messages (SMS means short message service). Mobile marketing can encompass that model as well as push notifications within apps.\n\nMobile marketing allows for instantaneous, simultaneous messaging to many users. This is perfect for time-sensitive promotions like fire sales or reminding users about an upcoming event. Messaging can often be personalized to individuals, which can deepen the connection between a user and the brand.\n\nNo matter which area you specialize in, it’s possible to grow your career in digital marketing in several ways. Marketing manager careers can be a rewarding option for people passionate about digital advertising, either in one area or across all fields.\n\nA career in digital marketing may be a flexible role that allows you to work on multiple projects and brands. Some agencies also allow for remote or hybrid work. If these qualities interest you in a role, this could be a good career for you to consider.\n\nDepending on their specialty, marketing and advertising managers made between $63,580 and $239,200 (with a median wage of $131,870) as of May 2023, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Finally, it’s a dynamic field that sees constant change. It keeps the work challenging and exciting.\n\nSalary ranges are not specific to students or graduates of University of Phoenix. Actual outcomes vary based on multiple factors, including prior work experience, geographic location and other factors specific to the individual. University of Phoenix does not guarantee employment, salary level or career advancement. BLS data is geographically based.
