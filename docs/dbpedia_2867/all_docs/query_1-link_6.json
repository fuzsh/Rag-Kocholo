        "text": "Documents pertaining to media and publishing cover a wide range of products, from magazines and newspapers to books, greetings cards and trade periodicals. Clients included well-known brands such as Esquire and The New York Times, as well as lesser known publications and companies such as Package Engineering and the Doehla Greeting Card Company. Reports such as Esquire and the college market, the automobile market and the egg-head market demonstrate the rise of an educated young adult market in the United States, as well as the beginnings of consumer profiling. Other reports, such as A proposal for a psychological research study on the role of magazines in the American culture seek to gain a more general understanding of the role of media within American society.\n\nSome of the more unusual reports in this industry include Psychological implications of the New York newspaper strike – a report which found that the majority of newspaper readers missed seeing advertisements while the New York strike took place. Another example is the curiously named, The difficulty of selling Christmas cards in August: A psychological analysis. This reports concludes that women do not buy Christmas cards in the summer because to do so makes them feel “guilty of insincerity.”"
