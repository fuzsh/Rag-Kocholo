But all those channels fit into three main categories of digital media which are paid, owned, and earned — and a strong digital strategy takes advantage of all of them.\n\nThis is any form of digital promotion a brand pays to have online. Some examples of paid media include banner ads, video ads, social media ads, shopping ads, and pop-ups. Paid ads can lead directly to purchases, but they can also help drive traffic to a business's owned and earned media channels, as well.\n\nThis refers to all the digital content a brand fully controls. Owned media content can be persuasive, but unlike paid media ads, it doesn't advertise or sell products directly. Instead, it provides value by giving customers what they need in order to make informed decisions. Owned media includes things like website content, blogs, eBooks, and social media content.\n\nThis is any positive digital exposure generated through personal or public recommendations. Companies don't create or own earned media, and they can't pay for it directly. It's generated by customers in response to things like product quality and customer service and successful marketing campaigns. Earned media can take the form of social media mentions, blog posts, written or video reviews, or positive press coverage, like product profiles or best-of lists.\n\nTo be successful online, brands use a combination of paid, owned, and earned media. Paid media is advertising you pay for, like banners or video ads. Owned media is content a brand creates and controls, like website content, blogs, or case studies. Earned media is positive, customer-generated content that raises awareness and enhances a brand's reputation."
