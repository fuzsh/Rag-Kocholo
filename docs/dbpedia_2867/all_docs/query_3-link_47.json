        "text": "What Is Interactive Media?\n\nInteractive media refers to various types of media, usually digital, where the user has the ability to influence the experience, such as the content that they receive. Examples include social media platforms, online quizzes and surveys, many kinds of apps, and video games. The interactivity aspect can involve text, graphics, sound, and video, or any combination of them.\n\nUnderstanding Interactive Media\n\nThe purpose of interactive media is to engage the user in a way non-interactive media was never able to. Traditional forms of media, such as television and radio, require no active participation by the user beyond turning on the set or changing the channel. With these forms of media, the user was simply a passive consumer unable to customize the experience to fit their own needs or interests.\n\nThat began to change with the advent of the internet in the 1990s. As the technology developed, consumers found they had more and more interactive tools available to them when they went online. Increasingly powerful desktop computers and laptops became common household items as well as a necessity in the workplace. Internet connectivity evolved from exasperatingly slow and often unreliable dial-up connections to high-speed wireless access capable of delivering enormous amounts of content seemingly instantaneously. Smartphones made interacting with media easy, convenient, and portable.\n\nElements of Interactive Media\n\nThe interaction in today's interactive media is provided through multiple means, including:\n\nMoving images, including animation\n\nStill graphics\n\nDigital Text\n\nAudio\n\nEffective interactive media strikes a balance among its various elements. As one early (2000) guide to the \"Elements of Good Interactive Media Design\" noted, \"The more interactivity, the greater chance of the viewer getting lost,\" but, \"The less interactivity, the greater chance a viewer will get bored or frustrated.\"\n\nUses and Influences of Interactive Media\n\nInteractive media doesn't just make people more active participants in their media consumption. It also gives them the power to communicate with other people, companies, and organizations with which they might normally have no quick and easy means of contact. At its best and most positive, it allows the free flow and exchange of ideas and information.\n\nInteractive media also has an educational component, making it a potentially powerful learning tool. It allows and encourages students to become more active in their learning experiences, more collaborative, and more in control of what they're learning and the pace at which they master the material. Interactive media is not only in wide use as a learning tool, but it has become a subject of study in its own right at many universities.\n\nIn sum, interactive media has changed the way people approach many personal and professional aspects of their lives, such as searching for a job, taking classes, communicating with friends, or making new ones.\n\nExamples of Interactive Media\n\nPeople are engulfed in interactive media in the digital era. You'll find examples everywhere you look, including:\n\nSocial networking websites, such as Facebook, X (formerly Twitter), Instagram, and TikTok, are among the most prominent examples of interactive media today. They use text, graphics, and increasingly video, allowing users to post and share information, to chat with one another, and to play games.\n\nVideo games are another type of interactive media. Players use controllers to respond to visual and sound cues on the screen, sometimes competing in real time with other players.\n\nThe apps on mobile devices like smartphones typically have an interactive component, letting you tailor the information you receive based on your location and other variables of your choosing. Rather than simply sign up for a general news feed, you can choose your news according to your interests.\n\nVirtual reality (VR) is another form of interactive media. VR gives users an immersive experience, allowing them to delve into a world with its own digital reality.\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nInteractive media has gone from gee-whiz novelty to common, everyday technology in the past several decades. As technology evolves, particularly with the addition of artificial intelligence, it is likely to play an even greater role in our personal and professional lives than it already does."
