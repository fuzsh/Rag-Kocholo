        "text": "Being in Egypt is interesting, not only for watching how a post-revolution society is like, enjoying a warm climate in the winter. But, from a media researcher perspective, the country with more than 23 million internet users, 9 million Facebook users and over 71 million mobile subscribers form an interesting social media case. Last Sunday I came back from Cairo, after spending two weeks in my home city, attending a series of meeting to get a new project starting .\n\nAmong the dilemma over a ‘superpower’ of people’s media proved by the ongoing Arab uprisings, the Interactive Cultures Center is a leading partner in an innovative research project to encourage disseminate citizen reporting in Egypt, by helping citizen journalists to bring their reports to the mainstream media. The center is joining forces with the not-for profit technology company, Meedan and the leaning independent newspaper in Egypt, Al Masry Al Youm.\n\nThe Egypt project is about gathering journalists in a virtual newsroom to report on one specific theme, they would build on each other reports. The theme is the upcoming parliamentary and Shura (Upper House) elections in Egypt, Meedan is building this newsroom, AMAY is publishing it and the professional journalists are their web and social media department staff, citizen journalists are recruited by a local partner and both citizens and professional journalists are to be receiving training workshops on a variety of topics that help them develop their reports.\n\nInteractive Cultures is developing a curriculum for these trainings; so the citizens would learn more about how to make their media production appealing to the mainstream media, and journalists will get closer to the social media sphere, what does it mean that media is becoming social and all of them would learn how to verify the citizen reports.\n\nNevertheless, under the leadership of Prof. Tim Wall, I am monitoring the project and evaluating it .\n\nThe project is going to benefit both types of reporters are benefiting, a traditional way of improving popular journalism is conducting direct training to people on how to use social networks and make media reports, what should not be the case a country that already has a very active citizen journalists, proved by the vibrant networks formed organically by people during and after the revolution to cover the protest news across the most populated country ( 85 million) in the Arab region.\n\nIn other words, quality citizen reports are needed for all societies, but where the good citizen journalism practices are, the priority is to get these reports out of the social networks and make them available for people who do not use the internet. This is the gap the project is expected to cover; to optimize the audience (consumers) rather than the reporters (producers).\n\nNow, I am again booking a new return ticket to Cairo, to attend the international conference of The Faculty of Mass Communication in Cairo University , in collaboration with the University of Westminster and UNESCO, I’ll present a paper about the interaction between social and traditional media, in which, the Egypt project is strongly present.\n\nLast week was a busy week, event-wise, what with the digital publishing seminar, the Pecha Kucha night, and the zine festival. In the middle of all that, several colleagues from the centre attended and presented at the CEMP Media Education Summit .\n\nStudents, scholarship, and our KT work\n\nOliver Carter gave a presentation, on behalf of himself and Faye Davies, entitled Student to scholar: developing vital academic skills on the journey from FE through HE. This paper discusses how, in the School of Media, we start instilling academic research skills from day one of year one. As part of our approach students are now engaged in producing and publishing support materials for our course textbook. The support website is part of a further project managed by Dr. Simon Barber and hosted at Interactive Cultures where we’re trying to rethink what a text book support website should actually do. It’s a nice case study in what we do here, as you can see the clear link between research, knowledge transfer, and teaching and learning, and it all links thematically back to our growing interest in digital publishing.\n\nWeb 2.0 in media education\n\nDave Kane and I gave a paper titled Student led design of Web 2.0 learning and teaching practices in media education. This paper builds upon our previous research into the uses of web 2.0 technologies within teaching and learning. As with our previous work, our hypothesis is that there is often a rush to adopt new technologies, primarily because of their ‘newness’, rather than as a result of a considered analysis of how they assist in the learning and teaching process or with little consideration as to what a learning culture wants to achieve through the use of technology. We looked at a small case study (interviews with students on the MA Social Media at BCU) to understand some of the issues at play in designing e-learning support materials. The work has prompted a number of new directions which we are actively exploring and we look forward to sharing more of this work in the future."
