We think at the Mountain West level she is going to make a huge impact and be a great asset for us in mostly the freestyle and backstroke events. Riley is a determined, hard-working young lady and we expect that to rub off on our young and eager team. I can’t wait to get her on campus!”\n\nCharlotte Berndt (Henderson, Nev. / Foothill HS)\n\nHenderson native Charlotte Berndt will join Nevada’s distance swimming group as she embarks on her collegiate career in 2024-25.

She comes from a great club program at Team Rebel Aquatics and she will slot in right away to make an impact in the distance freestyle events but she can also help our team in the IM and backstroke. She is a wonderful young lady and I know she will have an amazing four years with us.”\n\nNoelle Harvey (Carlsbad, Calif. / Washington State)\n\nNoelle Harvey is among the trio of transfers coming to Nevada for the 2024-25 season.
