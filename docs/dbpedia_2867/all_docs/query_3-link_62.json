        "text": "Digital marketing, or online marketing, is a form of advertising that uses the internet and digital technologies to connect with customers. Rather than traditional media, such as print, radio, or television, digital marketing uses computers, mobile, social media, search engines, and other digital channels to reach consumers wherever they spend the most time.\n\nLearn all you need to know about digital marketing, its methodologies, and how to get started in this career. If you're ready to build skills in this growing field, consider the Google Digital Marketing & E-Commerce Professional Certificate.\n\nWhat is digital marketing?Â\n\nDigital marketing is a form of marketing that leverages the internet and digital technologies to connect with customers. Digital marketing can take on many forms, including videos, long-form content, social media posts, display ads, paid media, or email newsletters. Users can come across these digital marketing forms on computers, laptops, mobile devices, tablets, or mobile apps.\n\nOver 60 percent of the global population is online, and more people are joining them every day [1]. That's why companies are now increasing their digital marketing budgets while traditional marketing gets slashed [2].\n\nMore than running a sponsored Instagram ad to drive sales, digital marketing includes strategies and best practices for interacting with customers at every stage of the buying journey.\n\nData plays a big part in digital marketing. With marketing analytics, marketers can collect valuable information by tracking a customerâs journey in real time and target specific audiences by tailoring content to their preferred digital channels. For example, Starbucks has collected data from their rewards mobile apps to help identify seasonal trends and create tailored promotions [3].Â\n\nWatch this short video from Google's Digital Marketing & E-commerce Professional Certificate on how digital marketing creates value:\n\n7 types of digital marketing (with examples)\n\nDigital marketers connect with potential customers through different channels. The following digital marketing channels, used by small companies and big businesses alike, remain among the most popular and impactful used today.Â\n\n1. Search engine optimization (SEO) and search engine marketing (SEM)\n\nSearch engine optimization (SEO) is a technique that seeks to improve the ranking of online material on search engines such as Google or Bing. If you have ever searched for something on Google, youâve likely noticed that even the simplest search can yield millions of results. Yet, you probably rarely go past the first few suggestions, let alone the next page.Â\n\nIn such a highly crowded space, digital marketers use SEO marketing to ensure that their webpages rank high in Google searches so that potential customers actually find their products or services online. Generally, SEO marketing targets organic search terms, meaning marketers create content that naturally aligns with and ranks for top search terms related to their product. Search engine marketing (SEM) strategies typically incorporate both organic and paid media, such as buying ads on Google.\n\nSome common ways to go about SEO include:\n\nCreating quality content that meets searcher intentÂ\n\nUsing keywords to help search engines identify relevant material\n\nUsing long-tail keywords (specific phrases that searchers use) to help content reach its target audience\n\nEnsuring that content loads quickly and is compatible with mobile devicesÂ\n\nRead more: What Is SEO Marketing? + How to Improve Your SEO\n\n2. Content marketingÂ\n\nContent marketing connects with target audiences through original content, such as blogs, articles, and newsletters. It is often used to raise brand awareness through material that appeals to a particular audience.\n\nContent marketing can take many forms across a range of digital media channels, including:Â\n\nInformative articles and blog postsÂ\n\nOriginal videos\n\nPodcastsÂ\n\nNewsletters (like Substack, Medium, or LinkedIn)\n\nRead more: How to Develop a Content Strategy: Step-by-Step Guide\n\n3. Email marketingÂ\n\nMarketers send out timely emails to large groups of people who have signed up for their contact list to inform potential customers of sales, discounts, and product launches. The impact of email marketing is clear: When used strategically, it can have an average return on investment (ROI) of 4,200 percent for every dollar invested [4].\n\nSome common examples of emailing marketing include:Â\n\nTimed emails that raise brand awareness during holiday seasonsÂ\n\nBlast emails that inform recipients about upcoming sales eventsÂ\n\nTargeted emails that send personalized offers and messages to specific groups on an email listÂ\n\n4. Pay-per-click (PPC) advertising\n\nPay-per-click (PPC) advertising is a digital marketing model that involves an advertiser paying a publisher each time their ads are clicked. Typically, the publisher is a website owner, search engine operator, or social media platforms, such as Facebook or Instagram.\n\nTypical examples of PPC advertising include:Â\n\nBanner ads that flank web content on the sides or top of the pageÂ\n\nSocial media ads that appear in the feeds of targeted audiencesÂ\n\nAds that appear when a specific keyword is searched on a search engine, such as Google\n\n5. Social media marketingÂ\n\nSocial media marketing is a form of digital marketing that uses social networks such as Twitter, Instagram, YouTube, Facebook, and TikTok, to reach customers. It leverages the reach of social media channels with data-driven efforts to reach targeted consumers.Â\n\nWhether through computers, mobile devices, or mobile apps, social media offers the opportunity to reach a wideâand targetedâaudience of possible consumers.Â\n\nExamples of social media marketing include:Â Â\n\nVideos posted onto social media as a part of a larger campaign, such as this 80s-themed music video produced by peanut company Planters for the holidaysÂ\n\nPictures posted on Instagram that reflect a brandâs identity, such as Patagoniaâs nature-filled Instagram accountÂ\n\nWatch this video to get a glimpse at how you can use YouTube to reach audiences.\n\n6. Influencer marketing\n\nInfluencer marketing is when brands partner with popular social media influencers to promote products and services. Influencers use their expertise, experience, and content creation skills to connect with other social media users. Through their authentic and relevant content, influencers can drive traffic to the brands they represent and even inspire their audiences to purchase products and services.\n\nExamples of influencer marketing include:\n\nA fitness apparel brand that partners with fitness experts and coaches on social media to promote a new line of footwear\n\nA cookware brand partners with food bloggers, bakers, and chefs on social media to promote a new kitchen appliance\n\nRead more: What Is Influencer Marketing? How to Develop Your Strategy\n\n7. Affiliate marketing\n\nSimilar to influencer marketing, affiliate marketing refers to when a business rewards third-party affiliates, often influencers or content creators, to promote the business's products and services. Typically, affiliates have used and enjoyed the product or service and create content on digital channels like social media, blogs, and email to tell their audience about their experience and entice them to buy. The affiliates then receive compensation such as a percentage of sales, free products, or other rewards.\n\nExamples of affiliate marketing include:\n\nAmazon Associates program, rewarding affiliates for promoting products sold on Amazon.\n\nHealth and wellness brands that reward affiliates for promoting products like vitamins, supplements, and health foods.\n\nRead more: Affiliate Marketing: What It Is and How to Get Started\n\nDigital marketing salary and job outlookÂ\n\nDigital marketing is an in-demand field with a growing impact because it offers brands the opportunity to reach billions of people using the internet and social media today.Â\n\nOn average, advertising, promotions, and marketing manager roles are projected to grow by 6 percent between 2022 and 2032, according to the US Bureau of Labor Statistics [5].Â Glassdoor estimates that the average annual salary for a digital marketing manager in the United States is $122,999 as of May 2024 [6].\n\nBuilding job-ready skills in an online course can be a great way to increase your earning potential. Consider the Digital Marketing Analyst Professional Certificate from Unilever.\n\nHow to become a digital marketer\n\nDigital marketers need to be familiar with marketing, business, communications, and digital technologies, as well as different types of digital marketing.
