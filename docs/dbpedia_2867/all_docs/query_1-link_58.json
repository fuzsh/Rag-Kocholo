        "text": "Editor's Choice\n\nThe Portuguese \"India Run\"\n\nErin Pearson\n\nIn 1497 Vasco da Gama commanded the First Portuguese India Armada from Lisbon to the west coast of India. Da Gama’s voyage built on Bartolomeu Dias’ expedition of 1487 during which Dias mapped the Cape of Good Hope. Da Gama’s voyage pushed on, rounded the Cape and travelled into the Indian Ocean; into waters that had never before been traversed by Europeans.\n\nDa Gama’s successful journey to India opened up the spice trade and meant that Portuguese, and subsequently other European, traders could gain direct access to the spices and goods from India that for centuries had been traded via merchants from the area, via the Mediterranean. The reduction in cost for these popular spices revolutionised commerce and trade between India and Europe and situated Portugal at the centre of this trade.\n\nThe sailing routes mapped by early explorers such as Dias and da Gama were used by countless subsequent expeditions; centring these trade routes in Portuguese maritime history.\n\nThe Regimento de Pilotos e Roteiro da Índia Oriental contained with Age of Exploration is a Portuguese manuscript guide to be used by navigators sailing from Portugal to India. Written in 1631 it contains instruction, navigational aids, and sailing directions for a number of coastlines and courses across the Pacific.\n\nThe author, D. Antônio de Ataíde, wrote this work over 100 years after Vasco da Gama made his inaugural voyage from Lisbon to India in 1497.\n\nThis document is a key source that compiles together maps and information about these routes and the development of these routes over subsequent voyages after Vasco da Gama’s success. It allows readers access to a fascinating period of history during which European explorers began to search beyond their known boundaries into new frontiers.\n\nWriting for Survival: The Queen’s Illuminated Magazine and North Cornwall Gazette\n\nAmy Hubbard\n\n“[W]e think we may be pardoned for a slight retrospect of our social and domestic economy since that Giant Ice said to us “Thus far shall thou go, and no farther” (The Queen’s Illuminated Magazine and North Cornwall Gazette, January 1853)\n\nThroughout the age of exploration, the Arctic region’s equally treacherous and captivating environs continue to capture the imagination of explorers and the public alike, with such an extreme climate leading to incredible tales of survival, death and discovery. One of the most famous and tragic of Arctic voyages is Sir John Franklin’s failed search for the Northwest Passage in 1845 which itself was the impetus for over 40 search expeditions, each with its own remarkable story to tell. One such search expedition by the British Admiralty was led by Captain Edward Belcher in 1852. With five ships, including Belcher’s HMS Assistance and Sherard Osborn’s HMS Pioneer, the expedition was tasked with exploring various parts of the Arctic in the hope of finding traces of Franklin and his crew.\n\nHowever, as was a common risk for ships in the Arctic’s icy seas, HMS Assistance and Pioneer became trapped in an ice pack at Northumberland Sound in the winter of 1852, and here they would remain until both ships were abandoned in the summer of 1854. It was during this long period of inertia that The Queen’s Illuminated Magazine and North Cornwall Gazette came to fruition. Hand-written and illustrated by the crews of HMS Assistance and Pioneer, this unique manuscript periodical offers an insight into the life (and imagination) of a crew trapped indefinitely in the Arctic’s solitary and uncompromising wilds, in search of entertainment, an alleviation from boredom, and a sense of normalcy."
