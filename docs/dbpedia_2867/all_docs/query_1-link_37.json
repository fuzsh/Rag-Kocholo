        "text": "WASHINGTON, Aug. 1, 2024 – Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack and U.S. Trade Representative Katherine Tai today announced the appointment or reappointment of 55 members to serve on seven agricultural trade advisory committees.\n\nThe advisory committee system was created by Congress to ensure that U.S. agricultural stakeholders have input and insight into U.S. trade policy and negotiating objectives. The Agricultural Policy Advisory Committee is comprised of senior representatives from across the U.S. agricultural community who advise the U.S. Department of Agriculture and the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative on overall trade policy matters, while members of the six Agricultural Technical Advisory Committees provide technical advice and guidance from the perspective of their specific product sectors.\n\nThis group of appointed advisors will serve until 2028. Applications for committee membership are encouraged at any time and will be considered for future appointments.
