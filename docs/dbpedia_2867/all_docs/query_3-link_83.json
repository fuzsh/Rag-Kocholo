        "text": "Content is at the heart of every social strategy. It’s how brands make their first and long-lasting impressions on social media. And it’s with content that brands communicate and connect with new and loyal customers alike.\n\nThat's why it's important to know what to post on each social media platform. So in this article, we’ll share the nine most valuable types of social media content according to marketers and how brands are using these formats to strike a chord with audiences.\n\nThe most engaging types of social media content in 2023\n\nKeeping up with the latest in social media is a difficult task with all the different platforms, features and algorithms. That's why we created The 2023 Content Benchmarks Report to help you identify the most valuable types of social media content.\n\nIn this report, we collected data from 729,000 public social profiles in 2022. Then, we analyzed trends to derive what types of social media content will inspire your audience and make them more likely to engage with your brand. Let’s take a look at which formats are most engaging.\n\n1. Short-form video\n\nShort-form videos are the most captivating type of social media content thanks to their capacity to break down and present information in less than one minute. Plus, the length makes it more shareable and ideal for social media.\n\nYou’re facing an audience that’s busier than ever. People are looking for immediate gratification with fast and entertaining content they can consume on the way. So a 15-minute video seems impractical when a one-minute video can do the job just as well.\n\nWhy short-form video works on social\n\nAbout 66% of consumers find short-form videos the most engaging out of any other social media post types. And before you say it’s because bigger brands have the resources to produce high-end videos, the truth is successful videos don’t require unlimited time, resources or heavy editing.\n\nAccording to our research, consumers find short-form videos 2.5x more engaging than long-form videos. So humor and relatability are enough to draw people to your brand. In fact, The 2023 Sprout Social Index™ found that consumers don't see enough authentic, non-promotional content from brands.\n\nAdditionally, short-form videos are perfect for different types of social media post ideas. From highlighting how to use your product or service to influencer collaborations and behind-the-scenes content.\n\nBest social media platforms for short-form video\n\nThe popularity of TikTok videos, Instagram Reels and YouTube Shorts is evidence of their effectiveness when it comes to short-form video.\n\nBoth TikTok and Instagram have a variety of tools that help create short-form videos for free. You can record a few shots, add a soundtrack, use a filter and follow popular social media trends. Additionally, you can promote your content with native ad campaigns.\n\nEven though YouTube Shorts are a recent feature from YouTube, they have become increasingly popular with 15 billion global daily views.\n\n4 use cases of short-form video from Last Crumb\n\nLast Crumb is a small business born in LA that bakes luxury handmade cookies. This brand stands out for using sassy language and an almost seductive tone to reach its audience.\n\nLast Crumb uses short-form videos on TikTok and Instagram to encourage their audience to crave their cookies with:\n\nContent relating their cookies to popular holiday celebrations. Last Crumb uses their holiday-themed videos to hop on relevant trends and conversations, prompting their audience to share their content with friends and allowing the brand to reach a wider audience.\n\nInfluencer collaborations to taste-test their cookies. In these videos, influencers unbox the luxury package and eat the cookies. This tactic leverages influencers’ loyal followings to generate interest within an untapped audience with \"reviews\" people trust.\n\nLast Crumb's destruction collection, in which the brand destroys their extravagant cookies, merge \"demos\" with entertaining content to show the delicious texture of the cookies to keep people watching and drive engagement.\n\nLast Crumb’s sandwich collection shows how you can make different luxury ice cream sandwiches with their cookies. This helps them stay connected with their customers by sharing recipes they might want to try the next time they order cookies.\n\n2. Images\n\nImages are the second most valuable type of content out of the nine popular social media content categories. They’re also one of the types of social media most frequently posted across social networks.\n\nStatic images are absorbed and appreciated in an instant. The colors, composition, text (or lack of it) and other details give social users an immediate impression of your brand.\n\nWhy images work on social\n\nAmongst the types of social media content, 61% of consumers find images the most engaging type of in-feed social content. I don’t know about you, but I’d rather look at a picture than read a thousand words.\n\nSince mobile devices are equipped with high-definition cameras, and there are many free editing tools, anyone can embrace their inner photographer and graphic designer. This means social media marketers can create images for their content strategy without enlisting a ton of resources.\n\nBest social media platforms for images\n\nInstagram and Pinterest are platforms that naturally lend themselves to images. These social media platforms have unique advantages to leverage your visuals like filters, effects and editing.\n\nInstagram started as an image-sharing platform and even though it has evolved to be much more, its content is still made of 87% images.\n\nWhen consumers go to Pinterest, they’re looking for inspiration and creativity. In fact, 97% of all searches on the platform are unbranded, creating the perfect environment for audiences to discover your brand and spark their interest in a future purchase.\n\nAs a bonus, both platforms have social commerce features that allow you to tag products, transforming images into “shoppable” content.\n\n3 use cases for image posts from Williams Sonoma\n\nWilliams Sonoma is known for its kitchenware, home furnishing and gourmet foods. It maintains a strong following, clear reputable brand identity and “shoppable” feeds across social platforms. They achieve that with sumptuous, vibrant images in the following ways:\n\nWilliams Sonoma uses top Pinterest trends to create Pins and carousels with colorful dishes and recipes. These images catch the eye of their target audience, enticing clicks to learn more about how to make the dish, which drives engagement and traffic to their website.\n\nThey support the full shopping experience on Instagram using eye-candy imagery and product tags. Thanks to these, consumers can get the product they like with a few taps, reducing friction to the final purchase.\n\nAcross platforms, they leverage their organic presence by using captions to enhance their image content and CTAs to their blog or online store to continue the buying journey.\n\n3. Live video\n\nThe ongoing digital transformation has left businesses thinking differently about how they can engage with customers in real time. In 2020, Live video came out as a winner during the pandemic with live video viewers reaching 152.5 million (20.4% more than in 2019).\n\nWhy live video works on social\n\n37% of consumers find live video the most engaging type of social media content. It enables businesses and creators to broadcast conversations, webinars, Q&As or other virtual events. And unlike text or image posts, where you wait for an interaction, live videos give audiences a chance to react in real time.\n\nLive and simultaneous viewing also gives people a sense of community and togetherness. What’s even better is you can repurpose your livestream video to get more value from the content. For example, you could create multiple shorts or text snippets from your livestream for posts on other networks.\n\nBest social media platforms for live video\n\nMany platforms have livestream capabilities, but the best ones are Facebook Live, Instagram Live, YouTube Live and LinkedIn Live.\n\nYouTube, Facebook and LinkedIn Live experienced a boom during the pandemic. YouTube and Facebook Live acted as entertainment for people. While LinkedIn Live allowed brands to reach and communicate with a professional network. On average, LinkedIn live videos get 7x more reactions than native videos.\n\nAccording to Statista, 43% of US social media users aged 18-34 watched Instagram Live in 2021. That’s in part because the platform is designed to better your chances of followers joining you. When you go live on Instagram, your Live content appears at the beginning of Instagram stories.\n\nHow BuzzFeed uses live video to spark interest\n\nBuzzFeed is a news and entertainment company that talks about viral topics. One of its branches, BuzzFeed Video, produces original video content about their articles.\n\nFrom trying viral TikTok products to, home decor andor easy meal preps, BuzzFeed Video attracts a wide audience around pop culture. They use Facebook Live to bring their blog content to life and be part of the conversation on social. Jumping on viral trends or speaking directly to their audience’s interests enables them to stay relevant in real time and be an entertaining source of information that makes you want to come back for more.\n\n4. GIFs/memes\n\nGIFS and memes are a particular type of social media content favored by younger generations. When words can’t describe the mix of gestures and feelings we all relate to at some point, memes can add meaning to these situations.\n\nThese types of social media content assure your audience gets the message and helps your brand relate to your audience through comedic takes on daily life.\n\nWhy GIFs and memes work on social\n\nBesides the fact that they’re shareable and enjoyable, their relatability makes it almost personalized content. Something that 71% of consumers expect companies to deliver.\n\nWhen people see personalized content, their immediate response may be to interact with it and share it with friends. That’s how memes become viral if they’re used with the right audience.\n\nGIFs can have the same effect but are more dynamic due to their animated feature. This makes them an excellent way to start conversations with more than words and still leave an impression.\n\nBest social media platforms for GIFs and memes\n\nInstagram, Facebook, LinkedIn and Twitter are ideal to post memes. But for GIFs, we recommend Facebook, LinkedIn and Twitter. If you post a GIF on Instagram, it will be added as a short video.\n\nMemes drive engagement, that's why Instagram users share over one million memes daily. They also drive traffic, as proved by a study from Social Media Today. They posted memes on Facebook, Twitter and LinkedIn for a month, which increased their website traffic by 12%.\n\nIn the case of GIFs, Facebook, Twitter and LinkedIn have special features for sharing this type of content. Twitter and LinkedIn make it as easy as tapping on the \"GIF\" icon and selecting the GIF you want to share. And Facebook's boomerang feature allows you to capture moments in a loop so you can create your own GIFs.\n\nHow ProWritingAid uses GIFs/memes to connect with their audience\n\nProWritingAid is an AI writing assistant software that corrects your grammar and style with automated suggestions. If you go to their Instagram profile, you’ll notice that their most engaging posts are memes from writers for writers.\n\nThey use memes to convey their audience’s common tasks, like finishing a book outline, the struggles that come with it and wholesome messages. This relatable content builds relationships with their audience by speaking to their pain points, while still providing comedic relief.\n\n5. Text-based posts\n\nIt’s important for businesses to prioritize visual content, but they shouldn’t lose sight of the power of words. What’s more, 32% of consumers say text-based posts are still one of the most engaging types of social media content.\n\nWritten content needs the same attention, consistency and creative elements that you give other content formats. But developing a distinctive brand tone and voice that aligns with your visual identity will help your written content stand out from the crowded social chatter.\n\nWhy text-based posts work on social\n\nAccording to our index, 34% of consumers follow their favorite brands on social to see the brand’s personality. And the most direct way to give that to your customers is with text posts.\n\nShort-form video is reigning and an image is worth a thousand words. But that doesn’t mean text-based content is redundant. And that’s especially true for social media, where text-based content can be valuable for starting conversations that help you get to know your customers better.\n\nBest social media platforms for text-based posts\n\nReddit, Twitter, Threads and LinkedIn are top-of-mind for text-based posts in the social media content categories.\n\nReddit is a great platform to engage in Q&As and get conversational with your fans. While LinkedIn is perfect to share thought leadership, articles and engage with your professional network.\n\nStill, Twitter is by far the most popular platform for text-based posts. It's perfect to share digestible bits of information, ideas and news. That's why it's always buzzing with conversations. And engaging in conversations that interest your audience can help you widen your reach and build a community.\n\n4 use cases of text-based content from McDonald's\n\nMcDonald’s is one of the most successful fast-food chains with millions of customers served each day. On Twitter, the brand uses text posts to communicate with fans in a relatable, casual and humorous voice that brings the brand down to earth. Specifically, they use these types of text posts to define their brand values and start conversations:\n\nAsking their fans questions and encouraging them to engage in fun trends.\n\nUsing Tweets to collect and act on the feedback shared directly from their community.\n\nThey don’t just post, wait for engagement and leave it at that. The brand addresses nearly every response they get.\n\nMcDonald’s cross-promotes their text tweets and repurposes them on other social platforms using graphic elements.\n\nThese examples show how McDonald's uses text-based content as a way of building a community and engaging with them. Plus, this makes customers perceive the brand as approachable which builds trust.\n\n6. User-generated content\n\nUser-generated content (UGC) is content created by fans, consumers or users that brands repurpose for their feed. When consumers create content showcasing your products, they’re essentially giving you social proof and testimonials.\n\nUGC has opened the doors for brands to reach a wider audience as people enjoy being part of a community. Also, UGC shows real-life uses of your products or services, which makes your followers more willing to try them.\n\nWhy user-generated content works on social\n\nOf all the types of social media content, UGC is the most trustworthy. Consumers want to see real customers showing their experiences with your brand.\n\nAccording to our 2023 content benchmark report, around 39% of consumers like to see testimonials or customer demos from the brands they follow on social because that’s the type of content they consider authentic. This creates trust, which ultimately affects the decision of 58% of consumers to pick a brand over a competitor, according to our Index data.\n\nAlso, you can take advantage of UGC to maximize your budget while reaching more consumers. When a user tries your product and posts about it, their followers may want to try it and post about it as well. This creates a chain reaction in which you reach the followers of your followers. Yet, over 93% of marketers aren't using the full power of UGC, so there's a lot of opportunity with this type of content.\n\nBest social media platforms for user-generated content\n\nInstagram and TikTok are the go-to social media platforms to find user-generated content. This is because both are highly effective for visual content, especially short-form videos. And since video content is best for showcasing a product over text or static images, 79% of marketers are willing to invest more in video leveraging authentic content (UGC) in 2023 according to the SOUGC report.\n\nHow L’Oreal Paris USA leverages UGC content with TikTok\n\nL’Oreal Paris is a cosmetic brand that empowers women through beauty. They launched a TikTok contest to win $25,000 in which TikTokers had to upload a 15-second video showcasing their new telescopic lift mascara.\n\nThis tactic generated tons of UGC videos that fueled their brand awareness. Also, their mascara went viral on TikTok, promoting more sales. And they got lots of product demos for future campaigns.\n\n7. Long-form video\n\nLong-form video is the type of social media content you look for when you want educational and informative videos. Even though short-form videos are the most popular type of content, they lack the depth you crave when you’re genuinely interested in a topic.
