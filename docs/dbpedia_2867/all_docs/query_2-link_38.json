Sign up to get it delivered in your inbox every Tuesday and Thursday.\n\nJeff Shuren’s FDA legacy: Bringing stability to device regs\n\nThe news of Jeff Shuren‘s departure from his long-held role as head of the Food and Drug Administration’s Center for Devices and Radiological Health — which my colleague Lizzy Lawrence reported exclusively last month — has left the medical device world stunned and struggling to imagine the agency without him.\n\nadvertisement\n\nShuren has led CDRH since 2009, with key charges of earning the medical device industry and the public’s trust. Experts say he’s been more successful with industry, including by making the regulatory labyrinth for medical devices more predictable, but not as much with the public — especially as risky products continue to slip through the cracks, like the Philips sleep apnea machines recalled in 2021."
