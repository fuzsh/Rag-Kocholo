        "text": "One viewpoint: A bigger family is a mark of godliness. Children are a gift from God. God commands us to have children. God loves children. God places a higher value on kids.\n\nSome question: Will God send me money and resources to raise the children, if I decide to have some, as God loves them?\n\nResist the pressure from God, some add.\n\nWe asked our panel: Is it necessary to have children?\n\nChildren are a blessing\n\nBryan Smith, lead pastor, Summit Christian Church, Sparks\n\nAlthough it’s not necessary as a Christian to have children, we understand that children are a blessing from the Lord (Psalm 127:3-4). We see God’s original design when he tells Adam and Eve, “Be fruitful and multiply and fill the earth” (Genesis 1:28). The marriage union is more than just a relationship born out of convenience or desire. There is intent and that is to produce a family, to multiply and have kids.\n\nThose that choose to not have kids aren’t living in sin, or living in disobedience to God’s command. There is freedom in the Lord. Those that aren’t able to have kids are never seen as less than. They are celebrated and loved. Those that adopt and build a family through an alternative path are celebrated as well. They are welcoming into their family a child born through another and that child is very much theirs.\n\nViews vary\n\nKenneth G. Lucey, philosophy/religion professor emeritus, University of Nevada\n\nThe Bible’s Old Testament in Genesis 1:28 has God telling Adam and Eve to be fruitful, multiply and fill the Earth. According to Islam, Allah determines whether people will have children. It is well-known that there are couples who deeply desire to have children, and that failures in that regard can doom a marriage. Buddhism doesn’t expect people to get married and have children. Some Buddhists may even believe that celibacy is something to strive for. The Catholic Church teaches that marriage is for the purpose of having children and that any form of contraception is a hindrance to a couple’s obligation to procreate. The LDS (Mormon) Church teaches that having children is a commandment from God, and that parents have the privilege and responsibility to bear and nurture children.\n\nI believe couples should just make decisions about children that respect their own values and happiness.\n\nNot having children is not a sin\n\nMuhammed A. Quddus, member, Northern Nevada Muslim Community\n\nThe question of having children is deeply personal, and Islam offers a nuanced perspective on it. While the Quran emphasizes the importance of family and procreation, stating \"He (Allah) created you from one soul, and from it He created his mate, and from them He spread abroad many men and women,” it never mandates parenthood.\n\nIslam teaches that having children is a natural and important part of life, a blessing, and a means of continuing one's legacy. The Quran states, \"And do not kill your children out of poverty. We provide for you and for them.” The Prophet also emphasized the importance of having children.\n\nHowever, Islam recognizes the decision to have children is personal. The Quran states, \"And those who say, 'Our Lord, grant us from among our wives and offspring comfort to our eyes.” Ultimately, Islam encourages having children, but there are no sins in not having them.\n\nChildren are not a requirement\n\nToni King, spiritual leader, Unity Center of Reno\n\nDespite many biblical references exalting the importance of offspring, other than God commanding Adam and Eve to “be fruitful and multiply,” scriptural proclamations from On High that having children is \"necessary\" are lacking. Many religions organize around a practice of increasing the presence of their particular brand of the Word through increasing their offspring. But Spiritually, God already has children: all souls in flesh or spirit.\n\nNot to discount global indigenous regions needing large families to support livelihood, God’s allegorical decree to populate an uninhabited earth has likely outlived itself. At a time in human history when many can choose to have children if conditions are optimal — or not, if that is not one’s calling — more than ever we should focus on another Universal Law: Love. If we love, appreciate, and take care of all who are already born, we can be the cumulative village it takes to raise mankind.\n\nNot necessarily …\n\nDaniel H. Mueggenborg, bishop, Roman Catholic Diocese of Reno\n\nThe first command of God to humanity is “be fruitful and multiply” (Genesis 1:28), and He wasn’t speaking of agriculture and mathematics. God instills in us a primordial impulse for children — children are a blessing and should be viewed as such. Indeed, when Pope Saint Paul VI wrote Humanae Vitae, he stated: “(L)ove is fecund. It is not confined wholly to the loving interchange of husband and wife; it also contrives to go beyond this to bring new life into being” (Humanae Vitae 9). Obviously, children are necessary for the continuation of the humanity.\n\nNevertheless, this is not an absolute command. Jesus says some people “renounce marriage for the sake of the Kingdom” (Matthew 19:12) and St. Paul says those who are unmarried “are concerned about the Lord’s affairs” (1 Corinthians 7:32ff). One could speak of the necessity for spiritual motherhood and fatherhood, but that would be for another topic.\n\nNot necessarily\n\nMatthew T. Fisher, resident priest, Reno Buddhist Center\n\nBuddhist scriptures say it is not “necessary” to have children to lead a good life. They stress cultivation of wisdom, and compassion. A good and meaningful life is achievable, family or not. Laypeople can live ethically by following precepts, engaging in right livelihood, and fulfilling their family responsibilities, while monastics renounce family life to focus on spiritual practice. Both are valid spiritual paths.\n\nThe Sigalovada Sutra is a roadmap for lay people, but does not say that you must have children to live a virtuous life. The Dighajanu Sutra discusses the happiness of lay life, such as economic security and virtuous conduct, but does not say that having children is necessary for happiness. The Kalama Sutra encourages us to follow teachings based on our experience and understanding, promoting a life of ethical conduct and wisdom rather than rigid adherence to specific life choices.\n\nHaving children is essential commandment\n\nMicheal L. Peterson, northwestern Nevada media specialist, The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints\n\nWhen God placed Adam and Eve in the garden of Eden, He commanded them to “ be fruitful, and multiply and replenish the earth” (Genesis 1:28). This commandment has never been repealed and therefore those who wish to follow God’s plan will want to have children if they are able. It is the reason that He created male and female (Genesis 1:27), to bring His spirit children into this mortal world so that they might be able to progress to immortality and eternal life. This commandment is essential and is the source of human happiness. Through the righteous exercise of this creative power, we may come close to our Heavenly Father and experience a fulness of joy.\n\nThe power of procreation is not an incidental part of the plan; it is the plan. God created all things spiritually before they were created physically (Moses 3:7) and more spirit children are waiting.\n\nNot a necessity\n\nNathan A. Bakken, director of congregational life, Unitarian Universalist Fellowship of Northern Nevada\n\nNo, having children is not a necessity. For Unitarian Universalists, it is a personal choice. Rather than a single sacred scripture, we draw from six sources, including \"the words and deeds of prophetic people which challenge us to confront powers and structures of evil with justice, compassion, and the transforming power of love.\" Rev. Dr. Rebecca Parker said, “Our calling is to expand the circle of love.” This can be fulfilled through various paths, including but not limited to parenting.\n\nOur faith, and this question, evoke the wisdom of Reproductive Justice movements. Sister Song, the Women of Color Reproductive Justice Collective, defines Reproductive Justice as \"the human right to maintain personal bodily autonomy, have children, not have children, and parent the children we have in safe and sustainable communities.\" Everyone is encouraged to find their path and contribute to the world in ways that resonate with their personal calling.\n\nOf course not\n\nDawn M. Blundell, lead pastor, Epworth United Methodist Church, Fallon\n\nAs I grow increasingly frustrated with the way certain Christianists are driving our national conversation, let me answer emphatically no.\n\nYes, the world needs children. Yes, the Bible agrees that children are a great gift from God. But God also blesses those who cannot or choose not to marry or have children. In Matthew 19:12, Jesus describes them with honor and respect: “For there are eunuchs who have been so from birth, and there are eunuchs who have been made eunuchs by others, and there are eunuchs who have made themselves eunuchs for the sake of the kingdom of heaven.” In 1 Corinthians 7:8, Paul writes “To the unmarried and the widows I say that it is good for them to remain unmarried as I am.” And although there are fun theories to the contrary, Jesus himself was probably unmarried and without children.\n\nParenthood is wonderful. Not required of anyone.\n\nMany ways to have 'children'\n\nElizaBeth Webb Beyer, Jewish rabbi\n\nJewish tradition regards having children a mitzvah, a religious duty derived from “be fruitful and multiply” (Genesis 1:28). Reform Judaism says it’s required for “those physically and emotionally capable of fulfilling it” (Gates of Mitzvah). Essentially, it’s a personal choice based upon one’s unique experience.\n\nOrthodox Jews often place this mitzvah only on males (Y’vamot 65b). Some say it's because pregnancy places a woman’s life in danger and she should not be required to risk her life. Yet, all is in the “hands of heaven.” The requirement is having one boy and one girl; though many argue that the commandment is continuing to have more children, as one is physically and emotionally able and capable of supporting them.\n\nFor those unable to have physical children, “spiritual” children are derived from teaching students or doing “good deeds.” Every life has a reason and a purpose, with or without children.\n\nOne thing necessary\n\nStephen R. Karcher, presiding priest, Saint Anthony Greek Orthodox Church\n\nHaving children is the happy outcome of human fertility and hopefully a blessed marriage. During our wedding service we pray, “Grant that their life together be with be without spot of sin, and may they be worthy to attain unto a ripe old age, keeping Your commandments in a pure heart.” What’s necessary is having a pure heart.\n\nA secondary result of marriage may be children. Obviously, not all who are married are capable of having children. Some will never marry; others will choose to live monastic lives. But in each of these different lifestyles, the necessary thing is one and the same, that is, to “keep the commandments in a pure heart.”\n\n“One thing is necessary,” the Lord once said, “Mary has chosen the good portion” (Mary sat at the Lord’s feet listening to his teaching). What’s necessary is to hear and respond to God, everything else is secondary.\n\nDepends on the situation\n\nNancy Lee Cecil, Baha’i teacher\n\nBaha’i Writings state unequivocally that within a marriage, every couple should have children if physically able. Our Faith sees the family unit as “the nucleus of human society.” They further state that the main purpose of a marriage is to procreate and raise children, adopted or biological; parents are required to love and nurture their children, and to teach them to know and worship God.\n\nHowever …\n\nIs it necessary for all to have children? Perhaps not, at least in current American society. Many children in foster care have literally been discarded by their procreators! As the adoptive mother of such children, I witnessed many ambivalent parents — with few safety nets available — rejecting their offspring. Having, and caring, for a child should happen ONLY when people are totally ready to assume this awesome responsibility; bearing children should probably not occur without a strong support system. It really does take a village!\n\nNext week’s topic: Does fasting help in achieving religious goals?\n\nFaith Forum is a weekly dialogue on religion produced by religious statesman Rajan Zed.
