        "text": "The world of advertising and how we promote products and services have changed dramatically over the years.\n\nWith this change, everything has taken a turn for the better when interacting with the public. Besides, it also saves time and money. After all, the resources used aren’t the same as they were 20 or 30 years ago.\n\nBut, at the same time, it has also fostered high competition between brands and companies. Today, all of them are trying to gain visibility in digital media. As a result, small brands find it hard to stand out.\n\nBecause of this, creating plans or projects is necessary to gain a following on social media. The goal is to make people follow the brand and seek its products or services. For this, brands must offer high-quality content to attract their attention. Said content should also evoke emotion in them to improve its engagement.\n\nThese plans and projects come together to form what we know as a digital marketing strategy. To be effective, it’s necessary to design it according to the brand’s needs and objectives.\n\nIn short, everything that is part of a digital marketing plan, no matter how simple or small, is digital content.\n\nTo put it better, digital content is all about digitized information. In other words, everything that’s not in physical form (book, magazine) is transmitted through the Internet. We can find it in different formats, such as images, videos, audio, texts, blogs, and applications.\n\nTo better understand how digital content works, let’s learn more about its types.\n\nTypes of digital content\n\nInfographics\n\nAn infographic is a combination of images alluding to the topic with text. Its objective is to make a short story or give information in a short and didactic way to the viewer. It should be pleasing to read as if we were reading a story.\n\nIt’s very useful in social media because it has high popularity and acceptance. We can clearly see this on the Internet due to its amount of traffic. In fact, most users today look for it due to its simplicity and lightness.\n\nNewsletters\n\nThis is a flyer-type format containing precise information or news about a brand or company. Most brands share them through email for the sake of email marketing. After all, it’s the perfect way to let clients know about a new product or service.\n\nIts main advantages are direct communication with customers and the power of precise segmentation. This is because we have the power to carefully choose the people we want to receive the information.\n\nBlogging\n\nIf you’ve come this far, you already know this.\n\nA blog is a diary or writing about a specific topic. Because it’s a non-rigid type of format, it’s fantastic to create relaxed content. After all, we can share valuable information to increase our traffic.\n\nMost people order blog entries chronologically and segment them according to topics. This way, users can easily locate a blog by topic. This makes it the best way to find information. On the other hand, it’s a very light way to get specific material. They are not extensive; the information is precise and easy to read.\n\nBlogs are ideal for:\n\nFor increasing website traffic,\n\nGetting customers hooked by getting subscriptions,\n\nEncouraging direct communication with visitors by allowing comments on posts.\n\nBut remember, you should use a blog to sell, inform, educate, and above all, recreate. From here, it’s that you want to attract a potential client by sharing truthful and useful information.\n\nE-books\n\nAs their name indicates, they are electronic books that contain more information than a blog. Because of this, they tend to go much deeper about a topic. Besides being digital, they’re available for download, this being the anchor point with the public.\n\nNormally, sites that offer e-books request a prior registration. This way, they can easily get the user’s information and add it to a directory of contacts. In other words, you’ll be able to easily make your database grow.\n\nIf the material is good, the person will return for more downloads. If you offer exclusive or very difficult-to-find items, you will get a purchase.\n\nVideo\n\nThe video format is the king of kings in social media. In fact, it will remain to be so for a long time.\n\nThanks to TikTok and its growth like wildfire, Instagram decided to adapt to this type of short videos. As a result, today, it’s the format that offers you the best visibility and positioning on social media.\n\nVideos are a visual option that has always been liked. After all, those who don’t like to read lean to this type of material, the same way you can learn and know about a subject.\n\nWe can find the opposite case of those who are not lovers of videos or excessively long videos. For them, 1-minute videos have been created that can offer quality content without tiring the viewer.\n\nNowadays, all kinds of brands, companies, and sectors have opted for this strategy since it has been proven that it really works. They are video consumers from children to the elderly, so it is an excellent way to reach a large audience.\n\nPodcast\n\nLike the phoenix, the podcast has won ground again in recent years.\n\nThis tool offers us all kinds of content. It’s not long, offers the possibility (depending on the platform) to download the chapters and listen to them later or access them to catch up.\n\nYou only need an internet connection and browsing to find the podcast with the topics that interest you the most.\n\nSuppose the material discussed in the podcast is good. In that case, users will follow you and look for you in other networks or media. Thus, helping your visibility and community growth.\n\nReports\n\nIn some cases, reports are issued from research or scientific work. For example, which can be published and thus offer information verified through studies and, therefore, real and true.\n\nThus, you will be offering valuable material to your audience, increasing your reputation, credibility, and seriousness to the brand or company’s image. All while ensuring the loyalty of those who are your customers or followers.\n\nQuestionnaires\n\nHow many did not succumb to Facebook quizzes in the beginning?\n\nIf you lived through that time and remember them, you will know that this type of tool is quite fun since it offers a moment of leisure and fun to the Internet user while giving you data about it, its tastes, preferences. If it is the in case they have to complete any registration, you will increase your database in the future.\n\nFrequent questions\n\nThis section appears on companies’ pages that offer products or services. This way, they can quickly address the most frequent doubts that users or clients have had.\n\nThe objective of this is to attack the possible doubt of a new user before it arises or to avoid the process of the person having to personally contact someone.\n\nAnd, of course, the goal is to satisfy a need or problem quickly and easily. Thus, saving the public or user time and processes that may be cumbersome, such as communicating with a customer service number.\n\nIt will always be more practical to find the answer to the question without going very far.\n\nKeep in mind that each of these types of content will be to connect with the audience and foster a relationship of loyalty that lasts over time.\n\nAll the resources described here add value and are really excellent. Just opt ​​for the one you consider to be the best for your business and create quality content that pleases and educates everyone."
