        "text": "Dakota Fanning (“Ripley”) and Abby Elliott (“The Bear”) have joined the cast of Peacock’s upcoming suburban-thriller series “All Her Fault,” alongside Sarah Snook, Jake Lacy, Sophia Lillis and Michael Peña.\n\nFanning will play “Jenny” on the series, while Elliott has been tapped as “Lia.” Snook (“Succession”) was previously announced to executive produce and star as “Marissa” on the series, which is being adapted from the best-selling novel of the same name by Andrea Mara. The series revolves around “a plausibly terrifying situation that eventually unearths the deep secrets of a community.”\n\nAlso in the cast, Lacy (“Apples Never Fall”) plays as “Peter,” Lillis (“I Am Not Okay With This”) is “Carrie” and Peña (“Unstoppable”) stars as “Detective McConville.”\n\nMegan Gallagher (“Wolf,” “Suspicion”) is writer, creator and exec producer, while director Minkie Spiro (“3 Body Problem,” “Downton Abbey,” “Dead to Me”) will direct the first episode (and others) and executive produce.\n\nHere’s the full logline: “Marissa Irvine arrives at 14 Arthur Avenue, expecting to pick up her young son Milo from his first playdate with a boy at his new school. But the woman who answers the door isn’t a mother she recognizes. She isn’t the nanny. She doesn’t have Milo. And so begins every parent’s worst nightmare.”\n\nOther executive producers include Nigel Marchant, Gareth Neame and Joanna Strevens for Carnival Films (“The Day of the Jackal,” “Lockerbie,” “Downton Abbey”), Jennifer Gabler Rawlings and Christine Sacani, and producer Terry Gould. Novel author Mara will serve as an associate producer.\n\nCarnival Films produces the show for Universal International Studios, a division of Universal Studio Group, and it’s distribbed by NBCUniversal Global TV Distribution.\n\nFanning is repped by UTA, TFC Management and law firm HJTH."
