        "text": "Today, digital marketing is one of the most important strategic initiatives for businesses. Many people turn to the internet for information on businesses and products as consumers like to be educated about their purchases. Using different digital marketing strategies to promote your business and products digitally will help you reach your audience through the channels that theyâre already engaging with. So before beginning our learning on the types of digital marketing, let us first understand what is digital marketing.\n\nPlanning to upskill and accelerate your digital marketing career? Here's a list of best digital marketing courses that you can take right now!\n\nWhat is Digital Marketing?\n\nDigital marketing refers to any marketing strategy that uses an electronic device that may or may not is connected to the internet. Even radio ads and television commercials are digital marketing strategies, though digital marketing has evolved, and new strategies can be much more effective. Digital marketing is important when it comes to being competitive and relevant within your industry.Â If your business has no web or digital presence, youâre missing out on countless opportunities to reach out to your target audience.\n\n15 Types of Digital Marketing\n\nThere are many types of digital marketing that you can leverage to increase your audience reach. Using multiple digital marketing channels can help you create a well-rounded strategy that will yield the best results.\n\nTo help you determine which digital marketing strategies may work best for your business, here are six of the most effective types of digital marketing:\n\n1. Content Marketing\n\nContent marketingÂ refers to informational, valuable content like blog posts, how-to videos, and other instructional materials. This type of marketing helps you connect with your audience and answer their questions. It can also help to generate leads and close sales.\n\nContent should be published regularly with the target audience in mind. Ideally, your brand would become a trusted voice within the industry by publishing quality, reliable content. You want your audience to come to you first for information on the latest industry trends.\n\nPros:\n\n1. Itâs free of cost.Â\n\n2. Content is a highly versatile option. It allows you to build your brand by educating, entertaining and inspiring the audience.Â\n\n3. It fuels all the other types of digital marketing.\n\nCons:\n\n1. The competition is high, it takes a lot of time to rank organically for target keywords.\n\n2. Consistency and high-quality is vital to be effective. Your content must meet your customers' requirements while branding and achieving your business targets.Â\n\nThe Next Steps\n\nDesigning a simple and effective content strategy is the key to a promising beginning:Â\n\nChoose 4 to 5 core themes considering the customer needs and what your brand wishes to communicate to the masses.Â\n\nDecide the formats: video, audio, articles, or others.Â\n\nFinalize the channels you will use to post each piece of content.Â\n\n2. Search Engine Optimization\n\nSearch engine optimizationÂ (SEO) is the strategy of creating content in such a way that search engines like Google will rank your page high on the search engine results page (SERP).Â\n\nGoogle uses algorithms to decide how relevant your page is to the keywords that the user is searching for. These algorithms update frequently, and SEO strategies must be adjusted just as regularly to remain effective.\n\nWhen done properly, SEO efforts will put your page at the top of the SERP and bring in more organic traffic.\n\nPros:\n\n1. It increases the brand visibility.Â\n\n2. It is cost efficient, compared to PPC.Â\n\nCons:\n\n1. SEO depends on content and tech.Â\n\n2. Google's changing algorithms might come in the way of your efforts.Â\n\n3. It takes time for SEO to work.Â\n\nThe Next Steps\n\nSEO begins with good content. Follow a good content strategy and do keyword research to discover what people search for.\n\nStay updated on Google's recommendations for content.Â\n\nBeginners opt for a plug-in that would assist them in optimizing their site (e.g. Yoast for WordPress).\n\n3. Search Engine Marketing/Pay-per-Click\n\nSearch engine marketing, or SEM, refers to paid advertisements that appear at the top of the SERP. The cost of these ads typically depends on the number of clicks the link receives, hence âpay-per-click.â\n\nWhen you pay for these top SERP slots, the âAdâ label will appear next to your URL. Despite consumer knowledge that these are ads, many still click on these links, and it can be a very effective digital marketing strategy.\n\nPros:\n\n1. It helps attain a top rank quickly.Â\n\n2. It is time efficient.Â\n\nCons:\n\n1. It can often be expensive to target popular keywords.\n\n2. Most people are skeptical of ads in the search results and prefer to trust the natural search results.\n\nThe Next Steps\n\nYou can opt for PPC to generate more leads. Do keyword research and then experiment with different targeting combinations to see what works.Â\n\nBecome a Digital Marketing Professional\n\nPost Graduate Program in Digital Marketing\n\nJoint Purdue-Simplilearn Digital Marketer Certificate\n\nBecome eligible to be part of the Purdue University Alumni Association\n\nprevNext\n\nHere's what learners are saying regarding our programs:\n\nAllan Joaquin\n\nSenior Copywriter , AMI Group\n\nCompleting the PGP in Digital Marketing and gaining knowledge allowed me to service new clients needing consultancy on digital marketing strategies.

Social Media Marketing\n\nWithÂ social media marketingÂ social media platforms are used as a digital marketing channel. Ads can be bought to reach out to a new audience, or you can create a profile for your business on any social media platform and create posts to advertise new products, sales, or freshly published content.\n\nWhich social media platform you will use will depend on the type of audience you want to reach. For example, according toÂ Pew Research, Instagram is best for reaching audiences between the ages of 25 and 29, while those 65+ can be best achieved through Facebook.\n\nPros:\n\n1. It has high conversion rates.Â\n\n2. The efforts multiply quickly as people like, comment, and share your content.Â\n\n3. Facebook/Instagram ads allow you to target specific customer segments and convey your message to the right people.\n\nCons:\n\n1. Social media is challenging. The algorithm changes every now and then. Along with that, new content formats are introduced frequently.Â\n\n2. Although it sounds simple to post on social media, you require strategic planning and dedication of enough time to do it consistently and efficiently.Â\n\nThe Next Steps\n\nMake your social channels a part of your content marketing strategy. Decide your content creation, the format and the channels you would distribute your ideas. This marketing technique requires you to create a calendar wherein you can mark the days for posting on a particular channel and the days for posting on the other. Since social media is an interactive platform, you must also respond to your customers in addition to publishing high-quality content. Real conversations help gain trust and improve brand loyalty.Â\n\n5. Affiliate and Influencer Marketing\n\nWorking with an affiliate or influencer can help increase your audience reach by engaging with their existing audience. For an effective affiliate/influencer relationship, try to work with an individual who is well-known and respected within your industry. They can create content promoting your business or product and share a link to your website. Every time a sale is completed, or a link is clicked, the influencer/affiliate will receive a kickback.Â\n\nPros:Â\n\n1. You get the privilege of the influencer's existing audience. So, you need not wait to build one yourself.Â\n\n2. Associating with a popular personality allows you to earn genuine followers and customers.Â\n\nCons:\n\n1. It is not just about paying a high amount to partner with influencers. You have to decide on the right influencer based on your audience and brand and figure out authentic ways to partner with them.\n\n2. The distrust of influencers is rising, and you need to be careful and transparent about paying them for promotions.Â\n\nThe Next Steps\n\nFinalize what you expect from your influencer marketing campaign. Create a list of possible influencers who seem to be a good match for your brand. Get in touch with them and negotiate your terms considering theirs.]\n\n6. Email Marketing\n\nWhen someone visits your website or business, invite them to join an email subscriber list. With their permission, you can send emails about sales, special events, or product releases. Email marketing is often underestimated, and according toÂ Lyfe Marketing, approximately $40 of revenue is brought in for every dollar spent on email marketing.\n\nThe most important part of this digital marketing channel is that it should provide value to your audience. Offer them exclusives that they would not receive anywhere else, and you can build a mutually beneficial relationship that will increase brand loyalty.\n\nPros:\n\n1. Amongst several types of digital marketing, this one is independent of any changing algorithms.Â\n\n2. Staying constantly in contact with your email list allows you to strengthen relationships, and they are likely to keep you in their minds when they plan to buy.Â\n\nCons:\n\n1. Often customers do not open emails.Â\n\n2. It gets difficult to find ways to add value so that the customers do not unsubscribe.\n\nThe Next Steps\n\nSelect an email software such as ConvertKit, GetResponse, or Mailchimp.Â\n\nCollect your target customer's emails.Â\n\nGive them a reason to opt for your mails, such as offering step-by-step pdf guides and free design templates.Â\n\nPay attention to the regulations.\n\nMaintain consistency and contact your list regularly via the weekly newsletter. Add value to your content rather than just the promotions and sales messages.Â\n\nBecome a Digital Marketing Professional\n\nPost Graduate Program in Digital Marketing\n\nJoint Purdue-Simplilearn Digital Marketer Certificate\n\nBecome eligible to be part of the Purdue University Alumni Association\n\nprevNext\n\nHere's what learners are saying regarding our programs:\n\nAllan Joaquin\n\nSenior Copywriter , AMI Group\n\nCompleting the PGP in Digital Marketing and gaining knowledge allowed me to service new clients needing consultancy on digital marketing strategies.

Mobile Marketing\n\nAs per Google research, 27% of people worldwide use mobile voice search. The mobile consumer journey is on an exponential rise. Digital marketing requires immediacy as much as loyalty, and smartphones are one of the most immediate problem-solving partners anywhere, anytime.\n\nMobile marketing is mandatory for brands who desire to be with their customers, side by side. It requires the marketer to adapt everything he is doing on the desktop to mobile. You must also be efficient in mobile-specific tasks such as in-app advertising, texting, and social messaging apps. It is significantly important for brands that target a younger audience.Â Â\n\nPros\n\n1. Customers spend more time on mobile phones than on their desktops/laptops these days. So, mobile marketing helps in reaching where they spend most of their time.Â\n\n2. It can be super-targeted with geo-fencing or specific audience segments.Â\n\nCons:\n\n1. The space is small as compared to computers.Â\n\n2. Mobile ads have a low click rate.Â\n\n3. People often dislike interruptions by marketing messages when they are communicating.Â Â\n\nThe Next Steps\n\nOptimizing your website and content for mobile is a prerequisite. It must work and look good on all devices. You can create an app, adopt instant messenger marketing, and offer services by geolocalization. Some quick tips for your next step are:\n\nKeep things simple and short.\n\nUse clear text and big buttons.\n\nPut captions on your videos to convey your message to people who have the sound system muted.\n\n8. Video Marketing\n\nIn today's fast-paced scenario, short and quick videos are quicker than texts in attracting customers. Be it educational or entertaining, live or pre-recorded video content is a reliable digital marketing option. Today, over 2 billion people look for something or the other per month on YouTube. It is a promising opportunity to reach new customers, and video marketing strategies drive results throughout the marketing funnel.Â\n\n80% of customers opt for search engines and videos to learn about products and check reviews. 55% of consumers do it before buying.\n\nPros:\n\n1. Videos can create an emotional connection with the masses and effectively spread your message.Â\n\n2. They are more memorable than text or images.Â\n\n3. Facebook, Instagram, and LinkedInâall channels are pushing video content to enhance reach and engagement and thus rank higher in search results.\n\nCons:\n\n1. It gets challenging to grab the viewers' attention in seconds. Users quickly shift to the next content in their feed.\n\n2. Creating high-quality video content consumes time, money, and skill.Â\n\nThe Next Steps\n\nMake video a part of your content marketing strategy. Get specific and decide whether you wish to add inspiration, education, or entertainment. Staying focused on your objectives helps you attain your marketing goals more quickly. Initially, you do not require perfection or high production values. Pay attention to lighting and sound to make your videos clear and professional.\n\n9. Audio Marketing\n\nRadio has been customers' favorite since the Golden Age of commercial broadcasting. From the 1920s till today, a section of people still listen to the radio regularly switching from traditional radios to internet radio. Channels like Spotify help advance audio marketing. Audio marketing is much broader as it includes podcasts and smart home assistants such as Google Home or Amazon Alexa.Â\n\nPodcasts are increasingly consumed, and they take the audience off the radio. People prefer them when working out or doing other mechanics. To ace audio marketing, you must understand the habits of your target audience. Think about the activities they might do while listening to your audios. This way, you can make audio marketing a big sales opportunity for your brand.\n\nPros:\n\n1. Be it radio or podcasts, audio marketing offers a convenient medium for on-demand and on-the-go for a busy audience.\n\n2. It is easier and cheaper to produce audio content than video.Â\n\nCons:\n\n1. Multitasking listeners can get busy and might not take the next step.Â\n\n2. Marketing via smart home assistants is still in the experimental stage, and there is a steep learning curve.Â\n\n3. Lower chances of immediate return on investment.\n\nThe Next Steps\n\nBegin by deciding your goals and preferencesâcreating a radio ad, starting a podcast or opting for smart home assistants. Think about your target audience and where they would spend their time. Select the best channel and focus on the same. You can figure out ways to utilize the content that you already have.\n\n10. Chatbot Marketing\n\nUtilizing chatbots for customer interactions on websites, social media, and messaging apps. Chatbots can assist with customer inquiries, provide information, and guide users through the sales funnel. Chatbot marketing offers several advantages and disadvantages, depending on how well it aligns with your business goals and customer preferences. Here are some pros and cons of chatbot marketing:\n\nPros:\n\n1. 24/7 Availability: Chatbots can provide immediate responses to customer inquiries at any time of day, improving customer satisfaction and engagement even outside of regular business hours.\n\n2. Cost-Effective: Implementing chatbots can be more cost-effective than hiring additional customer support staff. They can handle a high volume of inquiries simultaneously without the need for breaks or overtime.\n\n3. Efficiency and Speed: Chatbots can provide instant answers and solutions, reducing the time customers need to wait for assistance. This can lead to quicker issue resolution and a positive user experience.\n\n4. Consistency: Chatbots deliver consistent responses and information, eliminating the potential for human error in communication. This helps maintain brand consistency and accurate information dissemination.\n\nCons:\n\n1. Lack of Empathy: Chatbots lack the human touch and emotional understanding that a human customer service agent can provide. This can be a drawback in situations that require empathy or understanding of sensitive issues.\n\n2. Learning Curve: Developing and fine-tuning a chatbot requires technical expertise and time. Training the chatbot to handle various scenarios and responses can be complex.\n\n3. Technology Dependence: Chatbot marketing relies on technology, and if the technology experiences issues or malfunctions, it can lead to poor user experiences and frustration.\n\n4. User Preferences: Some users may prefer speaking with a human representative, especially for complex inquiries or when seeking emotional support.\n\n5. Scripted Interactions: Chatbot responses are based on pre-set scripts, which can make interactions feel less authentic and hinder the ability to handle unique situations. They might not understand certain slang, regional dialects, or cultural nuances, which can lead to misunderstandings and misinterpretations.\n\n11. Pay-Per-Click Advertising (PPC)\n\nPay-Per-Click Advertising (PPC) is a digital advertising model where advertisers pay a fee each time their ad is clicked by a user. It's an effective way to drive targeted traffic to websites, as advertisers can bid on keywords and demographics to reach their desired audience. PPC offers measurable results and allows businesses to control their budget, making it a popular choice for online advertising campaigns.\n\n12. Online PR and Reputation Management\n\nThis involves managing a company's online presence and public image. This includes monitoring social media, responding to customer feedback, and proactively building a positive online reputation. A strong online PR strategy can help businesses establish credibility, build trust with customers, and mitigate the impact of negative reviews or incidents.\n\n13. Video Marketing\n\nVideo Marketing has become increasingly popular in recent years as a powerful content marketing tool. It involves creating and sharing video content to engage and connect with audiences. Videos can be used for various purposes, including product demonstrations, testimonials, storytelling, and educational content. With the rise of platforms like YouTube and TikTok, video marketing offers a versatile and engaging way to reach a broad audience.\n\n14.Â Instant Message Marketing\n\nThis type of marketing leverages messaging apps and platforms like WhatsApp, Facebook Messenger, and Slack to connect with customers in real-time. Businesses can use these platforms to provide customer support, send promotional messages, and engage in personalized conversations. Instant message marketing allows for direct and immediate communication with customers, enhancing the customer experience and driving sales.\n\n15. Virtual Reality Marketing\n\nThis type of marketing is an innovative approach that uses virtual reality technology to create immersive and interactive brand experiences. By immersing customers in a virtual environment, businesses can showcase their products or services in a unique and memorable way. Virtual reality marketing is especially effective in industries like gaming, real estate, and tourism, where immersive experiences can significantly impact consumer decision-making.\n\nBecome a Digital Marketing Professional\n\nPost Graduate Program in Digital Marketing\n\nJoint Purdue-Simplilearn Digital Marketer Certificate\n\nBecome eligible to be part of the Purdue University Alumni Association\n\nprevNext\n\nHere's what learners are saying regarding our programs:\n\nAllan Joaquin\n\nSenior Copywriter , AMI Group\n\nCompleting the PGP in Digital Marketing and gaining knowledge allowed me to service new clients needing consultancy on digital marketing strategies.
