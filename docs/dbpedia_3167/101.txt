Introduction

Tweets can be associated with a location, generating a Tweet that has been âgeo-tagged.â Tweet locations can be assigned by using the Twitter user-interface or when posting a Tweet using the API. Tweet locations can be an exact âpointâ location, or a Twitter Place with a âbounding boxâ that describes a larger area ranging from a venue to an entire region.

There are two âroot-levelâ JSON objects used to describe the location associated with a Tweet: coordinates and place.

{ "coordinates": {}, "place": {} }

The place object is always present when a Tweet is geo-tagged, while the coordinates object is only present (non-null) when the Tweet is assigned an exact location. If an exact location is provided, the coordinates object will provide a [long, lat] array with the geographical coordinates, and a Twitter Place that corresponds to that location will be assigned.

Place object

Places are specific, named locations with corresponding geo coordinates. When users decide to assign a location to their Tweet, they are presented with a list of candidate Twitter Places. When using the API to post a Tweet, a Twitter Place can be attached by specifying a place_id when posting the Tweet. Tweets associated with Places are not necessarily issued from that location but could also potentially be about that location.
