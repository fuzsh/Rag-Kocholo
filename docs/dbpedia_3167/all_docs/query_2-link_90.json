        "text": "The University of the Arts Helsinki’s Academy of Fine Arts is accepting new students to its two-year master’s programme. Studies begin in January 2025. New students will start their studies in world-class facilities, specifically designed for studying fine arts.\n\nAs a student at Uniarts Helsinki’s Academy of Fine Arts, you have the flexibility to pursue your own personal aspirations when selecting courses and planning your curriculum. Individual guidance and independent artistic work are integral to the studies. You are encouraged to choose courses from subject areas other than your own and to engage in versatile artistic work using different media. We also encourage cross-disciplinary studies at the other academies of Uniarts Helsinki: the Sibelius Academy and the Theatre Academy.\n\nAs well as first-class facilities and support, every student is provided with a workspace of their own. Students also have excellent opportunities to exhibit their work in public, thanks to the Academy’s own galleries, frequent public art projects and active cooperation with the local and international art scene. In 2021, the Academy moved to a new building designed for studying art, situated in the vibrant, up-and-coming Sörnäinen district in Helsinki.\n\nWe have distinguished artists and experts from various fields of art in our faculty. Students have the opportunity to work closely with our acclaimed teachers across subject areas. Our current faculty includes, to name a few, professors Andrew Best-Dunkley, Marjaana Kella, Daniel Peltz, Tarja Pitkänen-Walter, Sigrid Sandström, Riikka Stewen, Salla Tykkä, and Annu Vertanen.\n\nOur impressive list of visiting artists, professors and lecturers from the past few years includes, to name a few, David Batchelor, Sonia Boyce, Christian Benefiel, Monster Chetwynd, Elmgreen & Dragset, Okwui Enwesor, Omer Fast, Andrea Giunta, Özgü Gündeslioglu, IC-98, Peter MacDonald, James Nisbet, Alex Olson, Ruth Pelzer-Montada, Ciara Phillips, Katarina Pirak Sikku, Josephine Pryde, Martha Rosler, Mira Schor, Adam Szymczyk, Emily Wardill, and Alexandria Smith.\n\nMaster’s programme in fine arts\n\nOur Master’s programme will encourage you to find your own strengths and methods of expression within the field of fine arts. You will acquire skills and knowledge that will enable you to work independently as a visual artist and understand your own work in the context of contemporary art and society where artists may adopt multi-faceted roles and profiles.\n\nAt the Academy of Fine Arts, you can study the subject areas of sculpture, painting, printmaking and time and space arts. Time and space arts allows you to specialise in moving image, photography, or site and situation specific art.\n\nThe primary languages of instruction are Finnish and English, and both languages are used flexibly on the courses. All mandatory studies are offered in both Finnish and English, and it is also possible to complete credits in Swedish. Learn more.\n\nApplying\n\nWe welcome applications between August 7–21, 2024 (ending at 3pm local Finnish time on the last day). We have a three-phase applications process: electronic application and advance assignments, evaluation of the advance assignments, and interview. Admissions guide.\n\nSee also the MFA admissions chat 2024 video recording where students and staff share insights about the application process and studies."
