        "text": "Listed among global consumers’ favorite social media platforms, Twitter (now known as X) is undoubtedly one channel businesses should be marketing on. The latest Twitter statistics also show that there are over 350 million monthly active users, making the micro-blogging site a great platform for brands to increase their reach.\n\nBut how much effort you should dedicate to Twitter will depend on your target market and, more importantly, consumers’ Twitter usage by country.\n\nNumber of Twitter users by country: Table\n\nCountry\n\nNumber of Twitter (X) users\n\n1. United States\n\n106.2 million\n\n2. Japan\n\n69.3 million\n\n3. India\n\n25.5 million\n\n4. Indonesia\n\n24.9 million\n\n5. United Kingdom\n\n24.3 million\n\n6. Brazil\n\n21.5 million\n\n7. Turkey\n\n19.7 million\n\n8. Mexico\n\n17.5 million\n\n9. Saudi Arabia\n\n16.3 million\n\n10. Germany\n\n15.4 million\n\nNumber of Twitter users by country: top 10\n\nAccording to a recent survey studying the number of Twitter users by country, the United States is home to the most users, with at least 106.2 million there. Incidentally, Twitter is also one of the fastest-growing social media platforms in the US.\n\nThis is followed by Japan, with 69.3 million Twitter users. Together, there are over 175 million people in the US and Japan using Twitter on a regular basis.\n\nThird on the list ranking the number of Twitter users by country is India, where there are 25.5 million Twitter users. Despite being third on the list, the number of Twitter users in India is relatively low, considering its population of 1.4 billion. The data on Twitter usage by country shows that Twitter’s reach in India is pretty insignificant. Its potential advertising reach is just 1.9% of the total population. In comparison, Twitter’s reach in the US is 30.9%—nearly around one out of every three people. In Japan, it’s a whopping 59.7%—more than half of the population.\n\nThis is followed by Indonesia, with 24.9 million, and the United Kingdom rounds out the top five, with 24.3 million Twitter users.\n\nBrazil is sixth on this list ranking the number of Twitter users by country. There are 21.5 million users of the microblogging site there. It is followed by Turkey and Mexico, with 19.7 million and 17.5 million, respectively. Saudi Arabia and Germany complete the top 10 list. There are 16.3 million Twitter users in Saudi Arabia and 15.4 million in Germany.\n\nTwitter user demographics 2024: share by region\n\nNorth America: 19.4%\n\nEast Asia: 16.9%\n\nSoutheast Asia:: 11.5%\n\nWest Asia: 8.8%\n\nSouth America: 7.9%\n\nGiven the vast population of Twitter users in the US, it should come as no surprise that North America is the region with the biggest share of Twitter users—19.4% of them are located there.\n\nEast Asia and Southeast Asia follow, with 16.9% and 11.5% of Twitter users, respectively. In total, these three regions are home to nearly half of all Twitter users worldwide.\n\nWant to learn more?"
