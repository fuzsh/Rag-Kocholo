        "text": "Philippe’s “French Dipped Sandwich” is the specialty of the house and consists of either roast beef, roast pork, leg of lamb, turkey, pastrami or ham served on a lightly textured, freshly baked French roll which has been dipped in the natural gravy of the roasts. Swiss, American, Cheddar, Monterey Jack or Blue cheese may be added. To accompany your French Dip sandwich, or sandwiches, we offer a tart, tangy coleslaw, homemade potato and macaroni salads, hard boiled eggs pickled in beet juice and spices, large Kosher style, sour dill or sweet pickles, black olives and hot yellow chili peppers. Philippe’s has been located in Los Angeles, CA since 1908 and at its current location on Alameda since 1951."
