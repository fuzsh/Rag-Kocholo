        "text": "Elon Musk said on Tuesday that he would move the headquarters of two of his businesses, the social media platform X and the rocket manufacturer SpaceX, to Texas, escalating an increasingly contentious fight with California.\n\nMr. Musk blamed a California law, signed on Monday by Gov. Gavin Newsom, a Democrat, that bars school districts from requiring teachers to notify parents if their children change their gender identification. Mr. Musk called the law “the final straw” and said he had warned Mr. Newsom that such legislation would “force families and companies to leave California to protect their children.”\n\nMr. Musk said SpaceX would move its headquarters from Hawthorne, Calif., to its Starbase facility in Boca Chica, Texas. X, which is based in San Francisco, will move to Austin.\n\nSpaceX, X and Mr. Musk did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Mr. Newsom’s office responded by pointing to a Tuesday post on X in which he implied that Mr. Musk was pandering to Donald J. Trump. Mr. Musk endorsed the former president on Saturday.\n\nMr. Musk has long had a love-hate relationship with California, chafing at what he says is overzealous government intervention in the state. He previously moved the headquarters of his electric car company, Tesla, from Palo Alto, Calif., to Austin in the wake of the Bay Area’s coronavirus lockdowns in 2020. Mr. Musk called restrictions that made Tesla’s factory in Fremont, Calif., shut down “fascist.”\n\nHe has also criticized the state for being slow to innovate and delaying civil improvement projects by overregulating. And he has said crime and drug use in San Francisco has made it difficult for him to come and go unencumbered from X’s office. He has sparred with local politicians and said the city has fallen into a “doom loop.”\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
