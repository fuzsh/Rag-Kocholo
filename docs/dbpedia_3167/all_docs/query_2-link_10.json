        "text": "KYLE, TEXAS — At approximately 3:53 AM on Tuesday, August 6, 2024, the Kyle Police Department received a call reporting a possible burglary of multiple vehicles in progress on the 100 block of Bunton Creek Road. Officers quickly responded and located the vehicle associated with the suspects as they were fleeing the scene.\n\nA pursuit ensued when the driver of the vehicle attempted to evade detention. The chase concluded on the Frontage Road of Interstate 35 Northbound at Exit 230 in Austin, where the vehicle crashed into a light pole. The suspects then abandoned the vehicle and fled on foot.\n\nKyle Police Officers successfully detained three of the four suspects; 27-year-old Carlos Moreno-Ramirez, 25-year-old Kevin Moreno-Ramirez, and 31-year-old Edwin Escobar-Alvarez, all of Austin. During the investigation, officers recovered two stolen handguns and narcotics inside the suspect’s vehicle.\n\n\"We commend these officers for their swift response. Their prompt actions have not only taken criminals off the streets, but also helped return stolen property to the victims,” said Dr. Jeff Barnett, Kyle Chief of Police.\n\nThree suspects face several charges including Burglary of a Vehicle, Engaging in Organized Criminal Activity, Theft of a Firearm, and Evading Arrest Detention. Escobar-Alvarez, the driver of the vehicle, was additionally charged with Evading Arrest Detention with a Vehicle and Reckless Driving. Charges for the fourth suspect are currently pending.\n\nPolice are asking anyone that may have any additional information to please contact the Kyle Police Department at 512-268-3232 or, submit a tip anonymously to the Hays County Crime Stoppers at 1-800-324-TIPS (8477), online at callcrimestoppers.com, or by using the P3 Tips app on your smartphone.\n\n###"
