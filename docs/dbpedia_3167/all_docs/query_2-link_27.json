        "text": "Milton, MA–Boston-basedFinegold Alexander Architects announced its selection as the architect for 440 Granite Avenue, a transformative mixed-use project in Milton, Massachusetts.\n\nPartnering with Oranmore Enterprises LLC and Brenco Construction Company, Finegold Alexander will bring its innovative expertise in sustainability to this ground-up development.\n\nThe 62,126 square-foot mixed-use project is set to reshape the landscape at 440 Granite Avenue. Situated in East Milton Square and the Southeast Expressway, this project aims to revitalize the area by transforming a formerly disjointed site into a cohesive and vibrant residential space, poised to become a key gateway to the town. With 24 residential units, three commercial spaces, 35 interior parking spaces, and 48 bicycle spots, 440 Granite Avenue represents a significant step towards Milton’s Housing Product Plan. The project will offer 10% affordable units, supporting diverse housing needs, attracting both empty nesters and young couples seeking quality living spaces.\n\n“We are thrilled to be part of the transformative development at 440 Granite Avenue,” said Ellen Anselone, Principal and Vice President of Finegold Alexander Architects. “This endeavor aligns with our commitment to creating sustainable and innovative designs that enhance communities and promote accessibility.”\n\nThe Finegold Alexander design team conducted a thorough review process with Milton’s Planning Board, Historical Commission and other important stakeholders in the Town. This collaborative approach resulted in thoughtful design moves to break down the scale of the building in relation to its residential neighborhood. These include stepping back the height of the building from the adjacent houses, cutting niches into the facade to create the appearance of three smaller buildings, and expanded sidewalk areas to support a lively pedestrian and retail experience. The subtle color palette and selection of red brick both stay true to beloved examples of Milton’s architectural history.\n\nAt the same time, the design of 440 Granite Avenue reflects a forward-thinking approach to sustainability, incorporating all-electric features such as rooftop-mounted photovoltaics and electric vehicle charging stations. The property prioritizes energy efficiency with a highly insulated thermal envelope and integrates sustainable materials with recycled content, furthering its commitment to environmental responsibility. The project also integrates green infrastructure, including a second-level green roof to mitigate the heat island effect and manage stormwater runoff. As part of its comprehensive approach, the development will provide bicycle storage facilities on the basement level, promoting alternative transportation methods and community wellness.\n\nFinegold Alexander looks forward to collaborating with Oranmore Enterprises LLC and Brenco Construction Company to bring this visionary project to fruition, contributing to Milton’s sustainable and inclusive growth. Finegold Alexander has a demonstrated history of delivering high-quality development projects, most notably Vita at 3531 Washington Street in Jamaica Plain and The Boulevard at 110 Broad Street in Boston, MA.\n\nRelated"
