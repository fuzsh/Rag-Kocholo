        "text": "Initially launched in 2006, Twitter started out as a micro-blogging platform that allowed users to share short, 140-character posts (also known as “tweets”).\n\nIts popularity increased a year later when Twitter usage jumped from 20,000 tweets per day to 60,000 during the South by Southwest conference. Since then, it’s become a go-to place for users to share daily updates, talk about their interests, and to make connections with others from all over the world.\n\nWhile Twitter has since given users the ability to use 280 characters in a single tweet, it still thrives on short and succinct messaging. And it’s become a valuable tool for marketers looking to expand their online presence.\n\nIn this post, we’ve compiled some Twitter statistics regarding its usage, demographics, and more to give you a better understanding of the state of Twitter and whether or not it’s a worthwhile platform to invest in.\n\nTo kick things off, here are a few top Twitter statistics that every marketer should know about the platform and its popularity.\n\nTwitter Ranks as the 12th Most Popular Social Network\n\nRanking in 12th place in terms of the number of users, Twitter falls behind platforms like Facebook, Instagram, TikTok, and Snapchat.\n\n10% of Twitter Users Are Responsible for 92% of Tweets\n\nAs it turns out, most Twitter users aren’t super active when it comes to actually sharing content. In fact, it seems most users only tweet once per month on average. That means most people are visiting Twitter to consume rather than create. Data shows that 10% of Twitter users are responsible for 92% of the tweets from all U.S. users, meaning there’s a particularly active group of users publishing a large chunk of content.\n\n48% of Users Turn to Twitter to Get the Latest News\n\nWe turn to social media for a number of reasons. But how do people primarily use Twitter? In the U.S., it turns out the main reason for using Twitter is to get news. Here’s a full breakdown of how people are using Twitter:\n\n48% to get news\n\n48% to get entertainment\n\n34% to keep in contact with friends and family\n\n33% to follow brands/companies\n\n14% to strengthen their professional network\n\n12% for other purposes\n\nTwitter’s Penetration Rate in the UK Dropped to 18% from 45% in 2020\n\nWhile the penetration rate has dropped to 18% in the UK as of April 2023, it doesn’t seem that Twitter is going anywhere anytime soon. It’s still a popular choice for making connections online.\n\nElon Musk Bought Twitter for $44 Billion\n\nOn October 28, 2022, Elon Musk bought Twitter after a tumultuous negotiation process. On May 13, 2023, he stepped down to Executive Chairman & Chief Technology Officer, and named Linda Yaccarino, former head of advertising at NBCUniversal, new Twitter CEO.\n\nNext, let’s dive into some Twitter usage statistics. Even though Twitter has been around for quite some time, it continues to see growth in its user base. Not only that but there are tons of tweets being posted on a daily basis, ensuring there’s always something interesting being shared.\n\nTwitter Has 335.7 Million Users Globally\n\nWhen looking at its audience worldwide, data shows that Twitter has 335.7 Million users so far in 2024. Although it may fall behind platforms like Facebook and Instagram, which have users in the billions, Twitter still has a loyal audience of those who log in on a regular basis.\n\nIn fact, Elon Musk recently announced that Twitter sees about 259.4 million daily active users, ensuring they’re always coming back to see what others are tweeting about.\n\nIn the UK, Twitter Has 23.15 Million Users\n\nIf we’re just looking at the UK alone, 23.15 million people had Twitter accounts as of January 2023. More than half of those Twitter accounts are owned by males, meaning they mostly dominate the platform gender-wise.\n\nTwitter Statistics in the US\n\nBy comparison, the U.S. has 105.42 million users as of January 2024.\n\nInterestingly, 69% of women in the U.S. have admitted to taking a break from Twitter, whereas only 54% of men have stepped away.\n\nAt Least 500 Million Tweets Are Sent Every Day\n\nTwitter’s users certainly have a lot to share with their followers! The platform has become a place to share daily updates and discuss common interests with other users around the world. At least 500 million tweets are sent on a daily basis, meaning there are plenty of conversations to join.\n\nGen-Z Users Like Twitter\n\nTwitter is gaining popularity 30% more quickly than Instagram within the Gen Z demographic. Brace yourselves: Gen Z actually likes Twitter.\n\nAmericans Spend an Average of 35 Minutes Per Day on Twitter\n\nThere’s no denying that we spend a lot of time on social media every day. It’s so easy to pick up our phones and begin mindlessly scrolling to see what friends, family, and our favourite brands are sharing.\n\nFollowing TikTok, where users spend an average of 38 minutes per day, Twitter comes in as the second-most popular social media platform in terms of daily time spent. In 2021, users spent a record-breaking 35 minutes per day on Twitter. However, it's worth noting that Twitter experienced a decline, losing 300,000 users over the course of the year.\n\nIn the UK, it’s reported that adults only spent around four minutes on Twitter.\n\n96% of Twitter Users in the U.S. Report Using the Platform Monthly\n\nFor many users in the U.S., Twitter isn’t a platform they turn to on a daily basis. 96% of users say they only check Twitter monthly. 84% say they use Twitter weekly and just 52% say they use it daily.\n\nHowever, the time spent on Twitter by Americans paints an interesting picture—they spend 34.1 minutes per day on the platform.\n\nThere Were 162k+ Downloads of the Twitter App on iOS in the UK\n\nIt appears there are slightly more iPhone fans among Twitter users in the UK. There have been over 162,000 downloads of the iOS version of the Twitter app and just 150,000 for the Android app.\n\nA few years ago, it seemed that Twitter’s growth was peaking. However, things changed after 2020 when a global pandemic struck, prompting more people to join the platform. With what appears to be a reignited interest in snappy 280-character tweets, many marketers are wondering if they should invest their time and energy into posting content there. Luckily, there’s Twitter statistics will let you know the demographics of its user base, helping you to determine if your target audience is active there.\n\nThe U.S. Has the Most Twitter Users\n\nThe country with the most Twitter users is the United States with a total of 105.42 million users. The other countries rounding out the top five are Japan, India, United Kingdom and Indonesia. Here’s how they stack up based on the number of active users:\n\nUnited States: 105.42 million active users\n\nJapan: 73.4 million active users\n\nIndia: 26.08 million active users\n\nUnited Kingdom: 25.6 million active users\n\nIndonesia: 24.69 million active users\n\nTwitter is Mostly Male-Dominated, Making Up 60.9% of Their User Base\n\nFor brands that have offerings targeted toward males, Twitter is the place to be. 60.9% of Twitter’s user base identifies as male, while only 39.1% are female. That’s a pretty big gap!\n\nNext, let’s share some Twitter statistics that are tied directly to the platform itself so you have a better understanding of what’s going on behind the scenes.\n\nTwitter’s Global Revenue was Nearly $4.73 Billion in 2022\n\nGenerating $4.73 billion in 2022 was certainly an accomplishment for Twitter. Their revenue has seen a steady increase each year. The only exception was when it dipped slightly from 2016 to 2017. Other than that, the platform has been consistent in bringing in revenue.\n\nThe Platform Recently Generated More Than $4.5 Million in Advertising Revenue\n\nA chunk of Twitter’s revenue comes from the advertising dollars brands spend to market themselves on the platform. In 2021, they made more than $4.5 million in advertising revenue, which was a $1.3 million increase from the previous year.\n\nIn 2021, Twitter Spent $1.17 Billion Dollars on Sales and Marketing\n\nShowing the importance of investing in your success, Twitter is no stranger to putting money into their sales and marketing. In 2021, they spent $1.17 billion dollars on marketing-related expenses.\n\nIf you want to beat the algorithms and get your brand in front of more people, investing in ads is a smart way to go. It can help you generate awareness, engagement, and conversions. These Twitter statistics show just how effective their platform can be for anyone wanting to run ads there.\n\nPeople Spend 26% Longer Viewing Ads on Twitter\n\nAds are on every social media platform these days, but a lot of times users just scroll on past. If you are planning to run video ads anywhere, you need to be able to grab and maintain your viewer’s attention. According to Twitter, people are spending 26% more time viewing ads on Twitter than on any other social media platform. With Twitter ads performing so well, it’s no wonder many brands choose to market their offering there.\n\nTwitter Has Experienced a 35% Year-Over-Year Increase in Global Ad Engagement\n\nEngagement is one of those marketing metrics that are important for brands to track. It shows that users are interested in what you’re sharing, while also communicating to algorithms that your content is relevant to others. Twitter has seen a 35% year-over-year increase in global ad engagement, making it even more enticing for brands to develop Twitter ads.\n\nBrands That Spend More on Twitter Are Seen as More Culturally Relevant\n\nTwitter’s advertising platform may also be a way for brands to boost their relevancy. Twitter’s Agency Playbook states brands that spend more on ads are seen as more culturally relevant. Not only that, but those brands that are more culturally relevant report seeing more revenue.\n\nAnd finally, for those curious how businesses fare on the micro-blogging platform, these Twitter statistics communicate the value the platform can add to their overall social media strategy. Twitter shows promise when it comes to assisting businesses in gaining both awareness and conversions.\n\n82% of B2B Content Marketers Use Twitter\n\nResearch from Content Marketing Institute shows that 82% of B2B (business to business) companies are using Twitter. Many businesses turn to the platform to share their latest content, promote offerings, and connect with their target audience. If you’re a business owner, there’s a good chance your competition is already there and nurturing those relationships.\n\n79% of Twitter Users Follow Brands\n\nDon’t fall into a trap of thinking that Twitter users are only there to follow family and friends. 79% of users follow brands to see their latest updates. The reality is, many brands provide informative and entertaining content and their fans love to support them by following and engaging.\n\nIt’s the Number One Platform for Brand Interaction\n\nGiven that Twitter makes it easy to connect with others in real-time, it should come as no surprise that it’s reportedly the top platform for brand interaction. Many companies are committed to responding to their online community with a short and sweet tweet. In fact, some even have dedicated Twitter accounts for handling customer support inquiries.\n\nTwitter Drives a 40% Greater ROI Than Other Social Channels\n\nWhen it comes to business, you always want to get more bang for your buck. If you’re going to invest time and energy into something, you’ll want to see a return on that investment. Twitter states that its platform drives a 40% greater ROI than the other social channels available today.\n\nBrands Are 2.3x More Likely to Reach KPIs if Marketing Launches on Twitter\n\nIf you have a new product launch on the horizon, Twitter doesn’t want you to neglect its platform. Their data shows brands are 2.3x more likely to reach their KPIs (key performance indicators) when they launch new products on the platform. It’s worth testing to see if that rings true for your business."
