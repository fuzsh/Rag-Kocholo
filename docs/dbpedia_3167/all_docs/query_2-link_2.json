        "text": "Twitter enables users to specify a location for individual Tweets. PowerTrack offers multiple ways to filter for Tweets by Tweet-specific location data through its various operators (see our documentation for Twitter PowerTrack Operators for details). Tweet-specific location information falls into two general categories:\n\nTweets with a specific latitude/longitude âPointâ coordinate\n\nTweets with a Twitter âPlaceâ (see our blog post on Twitter Places: More Context For Your Tweets and our documentation on Twitter geo objects for more information).\n\nTweets with a Point coordinate come from GPS enabled devices, and represent the exact GPS location of the Tweet in question. This type of location does not contain any contextual information about the GPS location being referenced (e.g. associated city, country, etc.), unless the exact location can be associated with a Twitter Place.\n\nTweets with a Twitter âPlaceâ contain a polygon, consisting of 4 lon-lat coordinates that define the general area (the âPlaceâ) from which the user is posting the Tweet. Additionally, the Place will have a display name, type (e.g. city, neighborhood), and country code corresponding to the country where the Place is located, among other fields.\n\nImportant note: Retweets can not have a Place attached to them, so if you use an operator such as has:geo, you will not match any Retweets\n\nplace:\n\nFilter for specific Places by their name or ID. To discover âPlacesâ associated with a specific area, use Twitterâs reverse_geocode endpoint in the REST API. Then use the Place IDs you find with the place: operator to track Tweets that include the specific Place being referenced. If you use the Place name rather than the numeric ID, ensure that you quote any names that include spaces or punctuation.\n\nplace_country:\n\nEach Twitter âPlaceâ comes with a country code, indicating the country in which the Place is located. The country_code: operator allows you to filter on this ISO alpha-2 character code (see HERE for country code references).\n\nhas:geo:\n\nThe has:geo operator matches for the presence of either Point or Place geo information within the Twitter payload. Note that this does not allow you to specify specific locations or types of geo data, it simply requires that results have Tweet-specific location information of some kind.\n\npoint_radius:\n\nThe point_radius: operator allows you to specify a circular geographic area and match Tweets containing Tweet-specific location data that fall within that area. To use, define a central lon-lat coordinate, and then set the radius (up to 25 miles). Any Tweet containing a geo Point that falls within this region will be matched. Addtionally, Tweets containing Twitter Places will match where the geo polygon defined for the Place falls fully within the defined point-radius area. Places whose polygons fall outside the defined point-radius area to any extent will not match.\n\nUsage resembles the following: point_radius:[lon lat radius]\n\nbounding_box:\n\nThe bounding_box: operator allows you to specify a 4-sided geographic area and match Tweets containing Tweet-specific location data that fall within that area. To use, define lon-lat coordinates that represent the opposite corners of the box, such that each side of the box is up to 25 miles in length. Any Tweet containing a geo Point that falls within this region will be matched. Addtionally, Tweets containing Twitter Places will match where the geo polygon defined for the Place falls fully within the defined point-radius area. Places whose polygons fall outside the defined point-radius area to any extent will not match.\n\nUsage resembles the following: bounding_box:[west_long south_lat east_long north_lat]\n\nProfile Geo Operators\n\nThe following Operators are available for building rules if you have the Profile Geo enrichment enabled:\n\nhas:profile_geo\n\nThis filter matches for the presence of Profile Geo enrichment data in a specific Tweet, regardless of the value. This will only match Tweets where the user's \"home\" setting was successfully geo-referenced to at least the country level. For example, a Tweet from a user with an account home set to \"the internet\" will not match this Operator, but a home of 'USA' will.\n\nprofile_country:\n\nMatches Tweets where Gnipâs Profile Geo enrichment data is available, and contains the defined country code. Note: this will only match Tweets where Gnip has been able to provide formal Geography information for the profile location provided by the Twitter user, consistent with the description of the enrichment here.\n\nprofile_region:\n\nMatches Tweets where Gnipâs Profile Geo enrichment data is available, and includes the specified âregion.â Note that profile_region: will perform an exact string match. This will only match Tweets where Gnip has been able to provide formal Geography information for the profile location provided by the Twitter user, consistent with the description of the enrichment here.\n\nprofile_locality:\n\nMatches Tweets where Gnipâs Profile Geo enrichment data is available, and includes the specified âlocality.â Note that profile_locality: will perform an exact string match. This will only match Tweets where Gnip has been able to provide formal Geography information for the profile location provided by the Twitter user, consistent with the description of the enrichment here.\n\nprofile_subregion:\n\nMatches Tweets where Gnipâs Profile Geo enrichment data is available, and includes the âsubRegionâ field from the âaddressâ object. In addition to targeting specific counties, these operators can be helpful to filter on a metro area without defining filters for every city and town within the region.Â This will only match Tweets where Gnip has been able to provide formal Geography information for the profile location provided by the Twitter user, consistent with the description of the enrichment here."
