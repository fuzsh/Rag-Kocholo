        "text": "The California Master Beekeeper Program (CAMBP) is a continuous train-the-trainer effort. The CAMBPâ€™s vision is to certify Honey Bee Ambassador, Apprentice, Journey, and Master level beekeepers so they can effectively communicate the importance of honey bees and other pollinators within their communities, serve as mentors for other beekeepers, and become the informational conduit between the beekeeping communities throughout the state and UCCE staff. Explore the Certifications Page for more information.\n\nWondering if beekeeping is right for you? We recommend to start by asking yourself these 9 Questions to Ask Yourself Before you Start Beekeeping."
