        "text": "Situated in the heart of Appalachia, West Virginia boasts a distinct and unique culture shaped by its location in the vast and ancient Appalachian Mountains. Fairmont State University’s Frank and Jane Gabor Folklife Center is a beacon of Appalachian heritage, enriching the surrounding community through various events, exhibits, and workshops.\n\nOne of the most notable events at the Folklife Center is the Wartz ‘n All Dulcimer Jam, held twice a year. The next jam is scheduled for Saturday, August 24, beginning at 10 a.m. This free event is open to the public, inviting everyone to participate by playing or simply enjoying the music. New players can borrow cardboard dulcimers to join in the fun. The day will wrap-up around 3 p.m.\n\nThe dulcimer, a stringed folk instrument, originated in Appalachia around the 1800s, though its exact date of creation is unknown. The earliest recorded use of the dulcimer dates to 1826 in Pendleton County estate listings. By the end of the century, it had become widely played throughout the region.\n\nWhen the Wartz ‘n All Dulcimer Jam first started, it moved locations several times until jam cofounder and mountain dulcimer player Robert Lackey established it at the Folklife Center. Although Lackey passed away later that year, his friends, including musician Bob Snyder, continue to honor his legacy by keeping the event going. “The Wartz ‘n All gathering brings together many friends, as well as new fans, of traditional old-time music,” says Snyder. “We encourage all players of mountain dulcimers and hammered dulcimers to come and be ready for a fun day of sharing tunes and camaraderie. All acoustic instruments, such as fiddles, guitars, mandolins, autoharps, are invited to join as well.”\n\nJammers can come for the full day or just a few minutes and can drop in at any time to play or watch. Folklife Center Director Dr. Lydia Warren says events like this are what makes the Folklife Center a vibrant community landmark. “Providing space for old-time musicians to gather, swap songs, and try out new tunes is what we are here for,” Warren says. “The event provides an informal, effortless way for musicians to perform together and maintain this music as a living tradition. Facilitating traditions and creating new ones is what we are here for.”"
