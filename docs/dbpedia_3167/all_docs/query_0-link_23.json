        "text": "Move Follows SAFETY Act Being Signed Into Law by Governor\n\nElon Musk, billionaire and CEO of Twitter, Space X, and Tesla, has stated his intention to move Twitter and Space X out of the state of California. The reason he gives is the bill signed into law yesterday by Governor Gavin Newsom.\n\nThe Support Academic Futures & Educators for Today’s Youth (SAFETY) Act prohibits school districts from enacting forced outing policies, providing resources for parents and students to manage conversations about gender and identity privately, protecting teachers and school staff from retaliation if they refuse to forcibly out a student. The legislation protects transgender and other LGBTQ+ students from such policies, and studies have shown that having a school that is gender-affirming and where students feel safe decreases suicide rates among LGBTQ+ youth.\n\nMusk, who has a transgender daughter, Vivian Jenna Wilson, has openly posted anti-trans sentiments on Twitter. Jenna Wilson legally changed her name in 2022 and came out as trans at the age of 16, but did not tell her father. Wilson gave the name change, saying, “I no longer live with or wish to be related to my biological father in any way, shape, or form.” as quoted by Today.com.\n\nMusk has blamed his daughter’s school in Santa Monica, Crossroads, for his daughter’s decisions. According to Walter Isaacson’s biography on the billionaire, Musk said that his daughter’s desire to have a relationship with him changed when her views “went beyond socialism to being a full communist and thinking that anyone rich is evil.” Musk has not only posted anti-trans content but seems intent on expressing the belief that society and Twitter are infected with a “woke mind virus” that is “either defeated or nothing else matters.” Science has not identified a “woke mind virus” to date.\n\nThe CEO sent several messages against the new SAFETY law, including announcing that Space X HQ would leave the state, “This is the final straw. Because of this law and the many others that preceded it, attacking both families and companies, SpaceX will now move its HQ from Hawthorne, California, to Starbase, Texas.” and that Twitter HQwill move to Austin, Texas."
