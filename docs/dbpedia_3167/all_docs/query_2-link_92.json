        "text": "Welcome to Naval Station Rota\n\nWelcome to Naval Station Rota, Spain - the Gateway to the Mediterranean\n\nInstallation Information\n\nNAVSTA Rota plays a crucial role in supporting our nationâ€™s objectives and defense, providing unmatched logistical support and strategic presence to all of our military services and allies. NAVSTA Rota supports Naval Forces Europe Africa Central (EURAFCENT), 6th Fleet and Combatant Commander strategic priorities by providing airfield and port facilities, security, force protection, logistical support, administrative support and emergency services to all U.S. and NATO forces.\n\nSituated on a 6,100-acre Spanish Navy base, NAVSTA Rota provides cargo, fuel and logistics support to units transiting the region, supporting U.S. and NATO ships with three active piers; U.S. Navy and U.S. Air Force aircraft with a 670-acre airfield; and the largest weapons and fuels facilities in Europe, all located within a single, secure fence-line. Under the guidance of the Agreement on Defense Cooperation (ADC), the U.S. and Spanish navies work together and share many facilities.\n\nThe Kingdom of Spain is a very important ally to the United States for projecting military power into the Mediterranean, North Africa, and Middle East. We have significant shared security interests, and Spain has traditionally supported U.S. forces deployments and operations with U.S. forces departing Spain directly into international air and sea space.\n\nThe vision of NAVSTA Rota is to continue to excel as an enduring, strategically-located naval installation, providing operational and logistical support to all tenant commands and transiting warfighters."
