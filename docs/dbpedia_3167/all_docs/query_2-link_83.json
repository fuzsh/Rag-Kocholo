        "text": "One of the country’s largest fast-food chains will return to Jersey City’s Journal Square neighborhood just months after closing a location in the area.\n\nTaco Bell has inked a deal to take up space inside the Journal Square Transportation Center situated above the PATH trains and bus station. The brand operates over 7,000 locations worldwide and has two Jersey City locations, with one situated Downtown and a second in the Twin City Shopping Center near the Bayonne border.\n\nThe restaurant recently closed a location along Kennedy Boulevard just west of their upcoming spot, which will look to focus on commuters in the area. The Taco Bell will be taking up residence next to Starbucks and join Jollibee, Wendy’s, and Tsaocaa as newer tenants in the complex.\n\nThe lease was facilitated by GRID, which has exclusive retail leasing rights for the property. The area around the property is seeing massive growth but still does have space available, most notably the former Emma’s restaurant.\n\nJersey City apparently loves them some Taco Bell, as the company has two other outposts in the works. A location with late night hours was approved by the Planning Board last summer near the Holland Tunnel entrance, while a project along Central Avenue in The Heights with a Taco Bell on the ground floor was greenlit late last year.\n\nThe developer for all three locations is Yum & Chill Restaurant Group, with Emara Ghobrial Architects working on the Journal Square and Central Avenue locations, and Zelta Design is the architect for the Holland Tunnel location."
