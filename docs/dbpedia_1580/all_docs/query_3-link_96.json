The last chapter “20th century: sigillography of struggle” uncovers dramatic events of Ukraine's national liberation competitions in 1917-1920, social transformations in the Soviet period, and the events of the Second World War. Particularly interesting are the seals of Ukrainian emigrants.\n\nThe paper explores gender and sexual dissent in contemporary Ukraine and Russia, turning to the space between feminist art and activism. It focuses on three feminist art projects, Zhinochyi Tsekh (Women's Work Unit, Kyiv, 2012), Feministskii Karandash (Feminist Pencil, Moscow, 2012) and Feministskii Karandash‐II (Feminist Pencil‐II, Moscow, 2013). It is argued that these events mark a shift in contemporary art, where feminist artists and activists engaged in projects that explicitly dissented against patriarchal societal norms and the neo‐traditionalist turn in the state politics of both countries. The paper examines curatorial strategies, the artworks produced and the broader networks of dissent that influenced (and were influenced by) the art projects themselves.\n\nReview on: Katerina Bilokur.

ISBN 978-966-7845-67-4 Kateryna Bilokur (1900–1961) is considered to be one of the most remarkable Ukrainian artists of the 20th century. The number of articles and books (even novels) that have been published about this semi-literate peasant self-taught artist and her elaborately sophisticated works far exceeds those about her well-educated contemporaries in the arts. Her paintings and, in particular her life, are still a subject which elicits contrasting and mixed thoughts and judgments from a host of authors.\n\nThis is the catalogue of exhibition “One Thousand Years of Ukrainian Seal” at the National Museum of Ukrainian History (Kyiv, Ukraine), presenting photos, descriptions and interpretations of 400 seals from the age of Byzantium to the 20th century.

Український модерн у літературно-критичній рецепції Михайла Грушевського Михайло Грушевський зазнав еволюції від соціологічної критики до своєрідного культурологічного естетизму, який полягав у розумінні специфіки художньої літератури як автономної духовної інституції в розгалуженій структурі новітньої національної культури. Не будучи палким прихильником символізму, критик прийшов до стильового плюралізму, визнавши, що цією манерою, як і будь-якою іншою, можна творити гарні мистецькі речі. У пізніших своїх працях він розглядав національне письменство як живий літературний процес, у якому конкурують кілька моделей, що виконують неоднакові функції. Це засвідчує зважену стратегію Грушевського-критика, спрямовану на творчу співпрацю, колегіальне обговорення і порозуміння всіх літературних сил України. КЛЮЧОВІ СЛОВА: утилітаризм, естетизм, реалізм, символізм, імпресіонізм, декаданс. Vasyl BUDNYI. UKRAINIAN MODERN IN THE LITERATURE-CRITICAL RECEPTION OF MYKHAILO HRUSHEVSKYI. Mykhailo Hrushevsky experienced the evolution from the sociological criticism to a peculiar cultural aestheticism, which was to recognize the specifics of fiction as an autonomous spiritual institution in the broadened structure of the modern national culture. The critic was not a passionate supporter of the symbolism. Thus, he came to the stylistic pluralism, admitting that in this manner, as well as any other, one can create beautiful artistic things. In his later writings, Mykhailo Hrushevsky considered national literature as a living literary process, in which there was a competition between several models performing different functions. Thereby, the deliberate strategy of Hrushevsky as a critic was aimed at creative cooperation, collective discussion and understanding of all the literary forces of Ukraine. KEY WORDS: utilitarianism, aestheticism, realism, symbolism, impressionism, decadence.\n\nAlthough women and men participated in nearly equal numbers in Ukraine’s 2013–14 Maidan protests, women were excluded from some of the more dangerous activities and their contributions went largely unrecognized. I examine women’s modes of participation in and their exclusion from the Maidan and the creative responses of feminists to this exclusion, including creation of so-called Women’s Squads. The protests generated important feminist initiatives and discussions about women’s roles in Ukraine’s past and future, which were partially couched in discourses of nationalism and militarism. Examining debates about women’s roles during and after the protests suggests that the Maidan provided Ukraine’s feminists with opportunities to articulate divergent yet reconcilable perspectives on women’s activism, social change, and national sovereignty. Their creative responses to the challenges of the protests have potentially paved the way for broadening the base of Ukrainian feminism, introducing women’s rights principles to segments of the population previously reluctant to embrace feminism.

Kyivan Rus’ hymnography is part of the Eastern Christian clerical literature. The structure of the Kyivan-rusian mines reflects the literary traditions of Syriac, Greek and Bulgarian anthemology. Mineya is represented by the largest number of lists in the literature of Kyivan Rus’ of 11th – 13th centuries among other liturgical books."
