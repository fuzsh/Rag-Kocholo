        "text": "The party said it approved the list based on popularity polls in the\n\nregions, and more popular members were given prominent places in the\n\nlist as a result. Speaking at the party congress on Jul 30, Prime\n\nMinister Mykola Azarov, who also heads the Party of Regions, said\n\nthat his party has to win in a fair and democratic election.\n\n“We\n\nhave returned hope, confidence and self-worth to people,” Azarov\n\nsaid. “The country now has a strong economic foundation, on which\n\nthe new quality of life will be built.”\n\nHe\n\nsaid his party is the first ever political force in independent\n\nUkraine, which started implementing complicated structural reform and\n\nset long-term interests above its political ones.\n\nAzarov\n\nheads the list of psrty candidates. Pop singer Taisiya Povaliy,\n\nDeputy Prime Minister Sergiy Tigipko, Chief of the National Security\n\nCouncil Andriy Klyuev and faction head Oleksandr Yefremov form top\n\nfive of the list. Borys Kolesnikov, another deputy Prime Minister, is\n\nrunning under number 8.\n\nThe\n\nPresident’s son, Viktor Yanukovych, Jr., currently a deputy, landed\n\non the 22th spot of the list. Many officials from the\n\npresident’s administration, including its deputy head Iryna Akimova\n\nand adviser Hanna Herman, will also run for parliament on the party\n\nticket, but not the president’s chief of staff Serhiy Lyovochkin.\n\nNone of the officials from the power group associated with him,\n\nincluding Finance Minister Valeriy Khoroshkovskiy and Energy Minister\n\nYuriy Boiko, are present on the list.\n\nPlenty\n\nof other ministers were given prominent places, though. The\n\ncontroversial Education Minister Dmytro Tabachnyk will run under\n\nnumber 11, Justice Minister Oleksandr Lavrynovych – right after\n\nhim.\n\nYuriy\n\nIvaniuschenko, who is considered to be close to the president, and is\n\noften referred to as a member of the presidential “Family” is\n\nnumber 24 on the list, while the young billionaire Vasyl Khmelnytskiy\n\nis number 37.\n\nHalf\n\nof the 450-seat parliament will be elected through proportional\n\nsystem. The Party of Regions has the strongest support among\n\nUkrainians at the moment, with 28 percent of support, according to\n\nthe June poll of Democratic Initiatives Foundation think tank.\n\n1.\n\nMykola Azarov\n\n2.\n\nTaisiya Povaliy\n\n3.\n\nSergiy Tigipko\n\n4.\n\nAndriy Klyuev\n\n5.\n\nOleksandr Yefremov\n\n6.\n\nIryna Akimova\n\n7.\n\nVolodymyr Boiko\n\n8.\n\nBorys Kolesnikov\n\n9.\n\nLeonid Kozhara\n\n10.\n\nVolodymyr Rybak\n\n11.\n\nDmytro Tabachnyk\n\n12.\n\nOleksandr Lavrynovych\n\n13.\n\nHanna Herman\n\n14.\n\nStanislav Skubashevskiy\n\n15.\n\nAnatoliy Blyzniuk\n\n16.\n\nIgor Sharov\n\n17.\n\nVolodymyr Oliynyk\n\n18.\n\nYan Tabachnyk\n\n19.\n\nVolodymyr Makeenko\n\n20.\n\nElbrus Tadeyev\n\n21.\n\nMykhailo Chechetov\n\n22.\n\nViktor Yanukovych, Jr.\n\n23.\n\nVitaliy Khomutynnyk\n\n24.\n\nYuriy Ivaniushchenko\n\n25.\n\nSvitlana Fabrykant\n\n26.\n\nYuriy Voropayev\n\n27.\n\nNestor Shufrych\n\n28.\n\nVolodymyr Demydko\n\n29.\n\nYevhen Geller\n\n30.\n\nVolodymyr Maltsev\n\n31.\n\nVolodymyr Vecherko\n\n32.\n\nVolodymyr Mkhytarian\n\n33.\n\nSerhiy Kyi\n\n34.\n\nMykola Demyanko\n\n35.\n\nVolodymyr Dudka\n\n36.\n\nTariel Vasadze\n\n37.\n\nVasyl Khmelnytskiy\n\n38.\n\nOleh Zarubinskiy\n\n39.\n\nYuriy Myroshnychenko\n\n40.\n\nViktor Turmanov\n\n41.\n\nAndriy Selivarov\n\n42.\n\nSerhiy Loshak\n\n43.\n\nOleksandr Kuzmuk\n\n44.\n\nOleksandr Yehorov\n\n45.\n\nKateryna Vashchuk\n\n46.\n\nAndriy Varevskiy\n\n47.\n\nOlensa Bondarenko\n\n48.\n\nYevhen Sigal\n\n49.\n\nHryhoriy Smitiukh\n\n50.\n\nYuriy Chertkov\n\n51.\n\nMykola Bagrayev\n\n52.\n\nMyrulislam Arkalayev\n\n53.\n\nAnton Prygodskiy\n\n54.\n\nHennadiy Vasyliev\n\n55.\n\nOleh Shablatovych\n\n56.\n\nVolodymyr Prodyvus\n\n57.\n\nArtem Shcherban\n\n58.\n\nVitaliy Kalyuzhniy\n\n59.\n\nAnatoliy Kinakh\n\n60.\n\nInna Bohoslovska\n\n61.\n\nStanyslav Melnyk\n\n62.\n\nVolomymyr Malyshev\n\n63.\n\nMykhailo Myronenko\n\n64.\n\nOleksandr Volkov\n\n65.\n\nLarysa Melnychuk\n\n66.\n\nPavlo Korzh\n\n67.\n\nVilen Shatvorian\n\n68.\n\nIgor Prasolov\n\n69.\n\nAndriy Pinchuk\n\n70.\n\nAnatoliy Korzhev\n\n71.\n\nOleksandr Dolzhenkov\n\n72.\n\nOleksandr Stoyan\n\n73.\n\nIvan Popesku\n\n74.\n\nIshtvan Gaidash\n\n75.\n\nVasyl Polyakov\n\n76.\n\nYuriy Polyachenko\n\n77.\n\nOleksandr Zats\n\n78.\n\nOleksandr Goroshkevych\n\n79.\n\nPetro Tsiurko\n\n80.\n\nOleksandr Kozub\n\n81.\n\nYuriy Moroko\n\n82.\n\nVladyslav Zabarskiy\n\n83.\n\nYuriy Kolitsei\n\n84.\n\nOleksandr Kasaniuk\n\n85.\n\nYulia Kovalevska\n\n86.\n\nValeriy Smoliy\n\n87.\n\nVolodymyr Zubanov\n\n88.\n\nOleksiy Plotnikov\n\n89.\n\nVolodymyr Lychuk\n\n90.\n\nMykola Komar\n\n91.\n\nAnatoliy Horbatiuk\n\n92.\n\nMykola Romaniuk\n\n93.\n\nIhor Hlushchenko\n\n94.\n\nSerhiy Andros\n\n95.\n\nVasyl Potapov\n\n96.\n\nSerhiy Viter\n\n97.\n\nIvan Vernybudov\n\n98.\n\nVasyl Kyseliov\n\n99.\n\nVasyl Demchyshyn"
