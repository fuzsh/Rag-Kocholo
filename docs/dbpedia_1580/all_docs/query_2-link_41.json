But isn’t the army of a democratic country and a democratic society stronger? An army consisting of citizens who consciously chose to defend their country. After all, what is an ‘army of a democratic country’? And what does democracy mean in the army? The participants of this conversation are Ukrainian servicemen and servicewomen. When we hear the opinion that today “Ukraine is protecting democracy in the world”, what do they say about it? What is the real price of it?

Discussion\n\nThe international security system is showing its inability to save the lives of people who are being killed by crazy dictators. Meanwhile, many Ukrainians believe that by defending their country, they are defending civilization as such. While debates about geopolitics operate with the concept of negative solidarity (‘the enemy of my enemy is my friend’), the values that are talked about so much in speeches and lectures are going through the reality check on the Ukrainian frontline. Is the world able to restore the original meaning to the principles and ideals that we consider fundamental to the survival of humanity?\n\nSupported by the Institut für die Wissenschaften vom Menschen (Vienna, Austria) within the Documenting Ukraine project.\n\nParticipants: Ivan Krastev (political scientist, chairman of the Center for Liberal Strategies in Sofia, and permanent fellow at the Institute of Human Sciences in Vienna), Carl Henrik Fredriksson (literary critic, essayist, founder of the network of European intellectual magazines “Eurozine”), Nataliya Gumenyuk.\n\nModerated by Kate Younger (co-head of the Documenting Ukraine project and head of the program “Ukraine in European Dialogue” at the Institute of Human Sciences in Vienna).\n\nStage #1\n\n16:15 - 17:00\n\n“Poems About Us”.

For centuries, Ukrainians have fought against various prohibitions, and now they give their lives to protect themselves from enslavement. For people who are kept in torture camps, residents of cities and villages who found themselves under occupation, freedom is not an idea, but something perceivable. However, in general, in post-authoritarian societies, people most often talk about ‘freedom from’, and discussions revolve around the choice between freedom and security. But why are these things mutually exclusive and not mutually dependent? Ukraine’s protection of its borders proves that only a safe territory can be a space of freedom. Ukrainian society also shows the practical effectiveness of freedom. Can such an interpretation of it be unifying for the modern world?\n\nStage #1\n\n17:15 - 18:15\n\n“Sci-pop during the war”.

Discussion\n\nIt is inherent in Ukrainians not to trust the authorities because the state has been hostile to its citizens for centuries. Society is used to relying not on institutions, but on individual heroes. And that’s OK. But after February 24, 2022, Ukrainians realized that in conditions of full-scale aggression, only the army can oppose the army, it is impossible to save the victims solely by volunteer efforts, and to have water and electricity, you nedd infrastructure. For the first time, Ukrainians felt that their state could serve them. Meanwhile, the business helps both the government and the civil society. Have we moved to the stage where the state can rely on its citizens, and they can rely on it? Those who were volunteers and activists at different times, but were in power during the great war, are invited to this conversation. What is the difference between these roles, and what is the best interaction?\n\nSupported by the Institut für die Wissenschaften vom Menschen (Vienna, Austria) within the Documenting Ukraine project.\n\nParticipants: Andrii Seletskyi (leader of the Novovorontsovka Territorial Community, Kherson Oblast), Ihor Kukobko (Head of the Iskra Dobra Foundation, Chernihiv), Mykhailyna Skoryk-Shkarivska (deputy mayor of Bucha), Tymofiy Bryk (rector of the University of the Kyiv School of Economics and sociologist), Tamila Tasheva (Permanent Representative of the President of Ukraine in the Autonomous Republic of Crimea).\n\nModerated by Nataliya Gumenyuk.\n\nStage #1\n\n13:00 - 14:00\n\n“Family and War”.

Discussion\n\nUkrainians who went abroad feel guilty that they are outside the country. Those who are far from the war zone think about those who are closer to the frontline. Those who do not serve may feel guilty before those who are in the ranks of the Armed Forces of Ukraine. But also those who serve may feel guilty before their fellow soldiers on the frontline. The latter, in their turn, may feel guilty before those who have already given their lives. To overcome this cycle of guilt, in the fifteenth month of the war of attrition, we ask the question: do we have the right to slow down? To take a breath? Pre-war sociological studies showed that many Ukrainians feel that they have no influence on anything. But the mentioned feeling of guilt can be interpreted as a feeling of subjectivity. You can feel guilty only when you think that you can do something. How can we use this resource? Can we organize the vocabulary of our new experiences?\n\nSupported by the Institut für die Wissenschaften vom Menschen (Vienna, Austria) within the Documenting Ukraine project.\n\nParticipants: Ivanna Skyba-Yakubova (culture manager), Alevtyna Kakhidze (artist), Oleksandr Mykhed (writer), Yaroslava Kravchenko (director of the “Wild Theatre”), Masi Nayyem (founder of “Pryntsyp” Human Rights Center for Military Personnel).\n\nModerated by Khrystyna Havryliuk.\n\nStage #1\n\n18:30 - 20:30\n\nScreen adaptation of Mykola Hohol. “The Eve of Ivan Kupala”.

Discussion\n\nOur conversation is based on the key Russian paradox: “Ukraine does not exist, but it must be destroyed”. Russia bombards Ukrainian cities, creates filtration camps, destroys schools, museums, churches, synagogues, and mosques, and persecutes the Crimean Tatar people. Millions of people of totally different origins consider it necessary to resist together in any available way, to protect their home, Ukraine. But what is Ukraine today? What does its complex, multicultural society look like, and what exactly is the strength of its resistance?\n\nSupported by the Institut für die Wissenschaften vom Menschen (Vienna, Austria) within the Documenting Ukraine project.\n\nParticipants: Akhtem Seitablaiev (actor, director, and military serviceman), Anzhelika Bielova (Roma activist, head of the Roma women’s association “Voice of the Roma”), Oleh Rostovtsev (culturalist, public figure, representative of the Jewish community of Dnipro), Azad Safarov (co-founder of the “Children’s Voices” Foundation, the second director of the film “A House Made of Splinters”).\n\nModerated by Anhelina Kariakina (co-founder of the Public Interest Journalism Lab).\n\nStage #1\n\n12:00 - 12:50\n\n“Contemporary publishing and reading of world classics”.

Discussion\n\nExecutions, torture of prisoners, forcible removal of children, obstruction of evacuation, shelling of civilians, hospitals, and infrastructure... During the 15 months of the war, the army of the Russian Federation committed almost all types of crimes mentioned in the Geneva Conventions. The General Prosecutor’s Office of Ukraine has opened more than 80,000 proceedings related to war crimes. Ukraine demands the creation of a special tribunal for the crime of aggression, which it calls ‘the mother of all crimes’. But what crime is Russia actually committing? What exactly is it trying to destroy, persecuting volunteers, representatives of local self-government, and everyone who does not agree to the occupation? The purpose of this conversation is not to establish the legal qualification of crimes that are prescribed in international conventions but to understand the nature of the great war of the 21st century.\n\nSupported by the Institut für die Wissenschaften vom Menschen (Vienna, Austria) within the Documenting Ukraine project.\n\nParticipants: Peter Pomerantsev (British writer and co-founder of The Reckoning Project), Oleksandra Matviichuk (human rights activist), Jonathan Littell (French writer), Yurii Belousov (Head of the Department for Combating Crimes Committed During Armed Conflict of the Office of the Prosecutor General of Ukraine), Wayne Jordash (international lawyer),\n\nModerated by Victoria Amelina.\n\nStage #1\n\n15:00 - 16:00\n\nPanel discussion of illustrators: challenges and opportunities\n\nTogether with Illustractor community\n\nParticipants: Maksym Palenko, Anna Ivanenko, Oleh Hryshchenko.\n\nModerated by Olesia Drashkaba.\n\nLecture Hall\n\n15:00 - 16:00\n\n“Building audio collections and sound archives”.
