        "text": ".\n\nI received the following letter from Bohdan Stasiuk, a science fiction and fantasy writer from Ukraine who tells me it was created by the Ukrainian science fiction community. It looks to be the real thing. But, as always, you should check the validity of the links before contributing any money. It's easy enough to do.\n\nA letter from Ukrainian artists to world artists!\n\nOn Thursday, February 24, 2022, the Russian Federation started the war against Ukraine and attacked our country. As we write this letter, the army of the aggressor country kills our children, bombs cities and civilians, and already turned more than 1,700,000 Ukrainians into refugees. In an attempt to further occupy our lands, Russia at the same time uses aggressive propaganda to justify its war crimes. Russian citizens are consistently being lied to about what is really happening in Ukraine.\n\nWe believe that not all Russian citizens are fans of Putin’s regime and not all of them justify this war. We know that plenty of Russians feel scared to use their voices and speak up against Putin’s regime. Many believe it is none of their business. Yet, there are also many who believe in the righteousness of Putin and his propaganda.\n\nSo, we plead with you — writers and visual content creators that have big audiences of readers and followers in Russia. To them, your opinion and your words matter. Your stand on the war in Ukraine matters. Please, stand by us as we fight for our values, our democracy, and our freedom. For the right to be Ukrainians and live in Ukraine. Your powerful voices can influence these Russian readers and followers. To encourage them to be brave, connect with their values, and take a stand on ending this ruthless war.\n\nPlease, take this message to your platforms and address your Russian and Ukrainian audiences. The first ones need your encouragement to believe in the power of their voices against Putin’s regime. The second ones are in desperate need of support and kindness.\n\nWe encourage the international community of fans of science fiction & fantasy, writers, artists, editors to boycott the Russian book market until the war in Ukraine ends and the country is free from Russian occupation. Until Putin’s regime is condemned as criminal and Putin and his closest allies are punished. As Ukrainians, we are working on this to happen day and night but there are bureaucratic procedures\n\nthat make the process so much slower in critical times where every second counts and can save Ukrainian lives.\n\nHere are the ways in which you can help our country:\n\n1. Please, reroute the funds received from Russia to either of the Ukrainian charity foundations that take care of refugees and restore what was ruined by Russia:\n\nhttps://eu-ua.com/\n\nhttps://donate.redcrossredcrescent.org/ua/donate/~my-donation?_cv=1 https://ua-aid-centers.com/#features\n\nhttps://tabletochki.org/\n\nhttps://mirco.com.ua/\n\nThe National Bank of Ukraine has opened an account for humanitarian aid to Ukrainians affected by Russian aggression. The account will be used to credit charitable assistance from Ukraine and abroad. The Ministry of Social Policy will use the funds raised to provide support to the citizens of Ukraine who suffer the most from the war. See below.\n\n2. If possible, terminate contracts and collaborations with Russian publishers. Do not let them use the money they earn on publishing your work to fund the war in Ukraine.\n\n3. Publicly denounce any further collaboration with Russia until it stops its aggression.\n\nI will add that the following writers have already supported us by announcing a complete refusal to cooperate with the Russian Federation: Stephen King, Neil Gaiman, Joe Abercrombie, Rebecca Kuang, Michal Cetnarowski, John Crowley, Jakub Cwiek, Piotr Gociek, Piotr Górski, Jaroslaw Grzedowicz, Marcin A. Guzek, Anna Kantoch, Marta Kladz-Kocot, Tomasz Kolodziejczak, Jacek Komuda, Rafal Kosik, Maja Lidia Kossakowska, Marta Barbara Krajewska, Pawel Majka,Tomasz Nizinski, Lukasz Orbitowski, Michal Protasiuk, Adam Przechrzta, Marcin Podlewski, Radek Rak, Magdalena Salik, Arkady Saulski, Wit Szostak, Robert M. Wegner, Cezary Zbierzchowski, Wojciech Zembaty.\n\nIt is of paramount importance for these actions to be made public. This will allow your readers to learn about your stand on the war in Ukraine and help those content creators who are still hesitant about condemning Russia’s aggression to take a stand, too.\n\nIt goes without saying that either of these actions is an act coming out of free will. We are grateful for any support. We are sure that the war that currently unfolds in the middle of Europe is not only Ukraine’s war. This is the war aimed at undermining and destroying the values of free civilizations. In times of peace, we guard these values via our novels, art, songs. Alas, this is not enough in times of war.\n\nIf you are not sure you have enough information to make an informed decision on taking a stand on what is currently happening in Ukraine, please see these resources.\n\nhttps://www.pravda.com.ua/eng/\n\nhttps://kyivindependent.com/\n\nhttps://t.me/ukraine4world\n\nIf you have any questions we are willing to provide you with answers. There can be delays in answering as many of us are often hiding in shelters from active bombing. Others rely on very unstable internet and phone connections while keeping in touch in these days of the war. There can be delays in responses, we apologize in advance.\n\nAlso, it is important to note that neither of us, the authors of this letter need any urgent help. It is our country that is in a state of a humanitarian crisis, desperately seeking support and allies.\n\nWhen taking to your platforms and speaking about Ukraine and war in our country, please use these tags.\n\n#SFaccessdenied\n\n#StopBusinessInrussia\n\n#StopFundTheWar\n\n#StandWithUkraine\n\nThank you for taking the time to read this letter.
