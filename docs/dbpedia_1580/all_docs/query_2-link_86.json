Andrusyshen. Winnipeg: Dominion Executive of the Ukrainian National Youth Federation of Canada, 1949. 32 pages. Port.\n\nExcerpts from two addresses delivered to the Alpha Omega Society at the University of Saskatchewan by the University's Professor of Slavic Languages. The first address, \"Shevchenko - a National and Universal Genius\", appears on pp. 5-18. \"Just as Dante's work is a compendium of all that had been achieved in the Middle Ages,\" says Andrusyshen, \"so does Shevchenko's work embrace all that is evoked by the word 'Ukraine'.\" In the author's view, \"such masterpieces as the 'Neophytes' and 'Maria'\"... \"are perhaps the greatest of his entire literary creation, for they are of genuine universal quality, worthy to be placed among the greatest creative achievements of the human mind.\" These two and selected other poems of Shevchenko are analyzed at some length, with excerpts (- in the original Ukrainian accompanied by literal prose translations) used as illustrations. Shevchenko is characterized as \"a seeker of truth\", \"a man intoxicated with God\", \"a poet of universal liberty\". Shevchenko's unpretentious \"miniature masterpiece\" Sadok vyshnevyi kolo khaty is used as a good example of the poet's artistry and his ability to create an unforgettable picture glowing with life and beauty. The poem, according to Andrusyshen, \"evokes a rustic scene, a scene which for sheer power of concentration surpasses even Grey's [sic] Elegy .\" In concluding his address, Andrusyshen calls Kobzar \"the greatest treasure the Ukrainians possess. What the Bible is to Christendom, that the Kobzar is to the Ukrainian nationhood.\"\n\nThe second address, \"Highlights of Ukrainian Literature\" (pp. 19-32), begins and ends with a folk-song, a widow's lament, which cast a spell over the author in his boyhood and which he uses as a symbol of the entire literature. Ukrainian literature, according to Andrusyshen, is characterized by democratic and humanitarian tendencies and by excessive sentimentality. The author surveys historical songs and dumy, relates, as an aside, the contents of a recently discovered code of good manners from the 17th century Ukraine, and then proceeds to discuss briefly Ivan Vyshens'kyi, Skovoroda, Kotliarevs'kyi, Shevchenko, Shashkevych, Fed'kovych, Franko, Lesia Ukrainka, Kotsiubyns'kyi and Stefanyk. Andrusyshen says of Franko: \"Franko appeared on the scene to find his people a collective hireling, a naymit who plows the field which does not belong to him. Out of this hireling Franko made a pioneer, a kamenyar , instructing him how to pierce his way through the solid mountain of injustice beyond which lies the promised land.\" Andrusyshen considers Kotsiubyns'kyi \"the greatest artist Ukraine has ever produced.\" Kotsiubyns'kyi's story Son is analyzed in considerable detail, as is also Stefanyk's work Syny . Stefanyk's miniature short stories are characterized as \"real, genuine jewels of artistry.\"\n\nThe frontispiece with a caption \"Shevchenko's portrait of himself\" is, in fact, an illustration by an unknown artist which includes among its elements a free rendering of Shevchenko's 1840 self-portrait.\n\nB2. Andrusyshen, Constantine Henry. The Ukrainian Poets, 1189-1962. / Selected and translated into English verse by C.H. Andrusyshen and Watson Kirkconnell. Toronto: Published for the Ukrainian Canadian Committee by University of Toronto Press, 1963. xxx, 500 pages.\n\nThe first comprehensive English language anthology of Ukrainian poetry with a scope extending from the 12th century Slovo o polku Ihorevim and the 16th and 17th century Cossack dumy to present day Ukrainian poets living in Ukraine, United States and Canada. C.H. Andrusyshen's introduction places the development of Ukrainian poetry against the background of Ukrainian literary history; his copious notes provide bio-bibliographical and critical data on each of the poets included.\n\nContents: Preface (pp. v-vi)/ Watson Kirkconnell. -- Introduction (pp. vii-xxii) / C.H.

Port.\n\nLife and work of the Ukrainian poet Mykhailo Drai-Khmara (1889-1939) presented against a broad literary panorama of his times. Drai-Khmara was an accomplished poet and literary scholar and critic, as well as a translator into Ukrainian of French poets. Arrested in 1935 during the Stalinist terror, he was sent to a concentration camp in Kolyma and died there. The study, written by Drai-Khmara's daughter, is based primarily on the poet's unpublished diary and his letters, both of which have survived in the family's archives. The text (especially Chapter 4) is interspersed with excerpts of Drai-Khmara's poetry in English translation (translated, apparently, by the author); the poems Swans (Upon the lake with winds through willows singing) and Second birth (It seemed sufficient honor so to render) are included in their entirety.\n\nContents: Foreword / Padraic Colum. -- Ch. 1.

Dray-Khmara. -- Appendix B: Poems translated by Dray-Khmara in the years 1927-1930. -- Bibliography.\n\nPadraic Colum in his foreword describes Drai-Khmara as one \"who made poems about swans on lakes, about historic cities decaying, about the loneliness of the great steppes\" which was enough to make him \"guilty of ignoring directives.\"\n\nThere are no statements to that effect anywhere in the book, but Chapters 1-4 have been published previously as a series of separate articles in the Ukrainian Quarterly under slightly different titles, e.g., \"A Ukrainian Poet's Fate in the Soviet Union\" [13.2 (June 1957): 127-137]; \"Ukrainian Poet Dray-Khmara on the Ukrainian Literary Life under the Soviets\" [13.3 (September 1957): 255-264]; and \"Dray-Khmara's Poetical Creativeness\" [pt.

(Studies in Russian epic tradition, 2d issue).\n\nIzbornyk Sviatoslava of 1073 (The Sviatoslav Codex), in the author's words, \"one of the few Early Russian manuscripts that is dated,\" contains, among other writings, a treatise on rhetoric by George Choeroboscus, a professor of rhetoric at the University of Constantinople. Whether or not the author of Slovo o polku Ihorevim read this treatise, he made Choeroboscus's tropes and figures the instruments of his composition and he drew upon a tradition of style that had already existed in the 10th century Church Slavonic, says Besharov. \"The Choeroboscus treatise in the Codices...,\" according to the author, \"represents a special esoteric language, an ingenious code, cryptic at first to us, but immediately apprehended by the initiate. The medieval world was where the impossible was possible not only through faith but through magic\" (p. 98) and, in Besharov's view, \"if passages of the Slovo not infrequently appear puzzling or obscure, this is because its tropes and figures are foreign to the literary climate of investigators\" (p. 99). This work was presented originally as a doctoral dissertation in Slavic Languages and Literatures at Harvard University. It is divided into two main parts: \"Tropes and Figures in Byzantino-Slavic Theory\" and \"The Main Tropes and Figures of the Igor' Tale \" and includes the facsimile of the Choeroboscus treatise from the 1073 Sviatoslav Codex, as well as its Greek original and translations into English of the Greek and Church Slavonic version.

Poems and Stories. / Translated by John Weir. Toronto: Ukrainska knyha, 1956. 341 pages. Illus.\n\nA selection issued on the occasion of the 100th anniversary of Franko's birth. As stated in the foreword, selections were made with the aim of exposing the author's social views and the social conditions in western Ukraine during the last half of the 19th and the first decade of the 20th century. This, in the publisher's view, should provide \"an understanding of the problems and forces that led to the re-unification of western and eastern Ukraine in the Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic in our time.\" All translations are by John Weir, except for the story \"The Pencil\" which was translated by Helen Weir. Some of these translations have previously been published in The Ukrainian Canadian, New Frontiers and other publications. The \"Biographical notes\" by John Weir (pp. 15-50) consist of ten separate essays which are polemical in tone and deal primarily with social and political aspects of Franko's life and work. All the prose pieces have brief annotations by the translator. The book has 17 black and white illustrations in text, including 5 Franko portraits and the music by Lysenko to Franko's poem Vichnyi revoliutsioner .\n\nContents: Foreword. -- Translator's notes. -- Biographical notes: 1.

Port.\n\nThe earliest known book of Franko's poetry in the English language. Percival Cundy's essay on \"Franko's Life and Work\" (pp. 3-27) provides many details about the poet's schooling, his arrests and prison experiences, \"the astonishing and indefatigable industry that he displayed all through his life\" and, finally, his last eight years plagued by a grave illness.

Cundy's foreword to the volume relates how \"in the course of his duties as missionary superintendent among New Canadians in Western Canada\" he discovered \"the Ukrainians, with a splendid national heritage behind them\" and how \"he gave himself in his spare time to the study of the history, language, and literature of this great race with the distinct purpose of endeavoring to make this Ukrainian background better known to his fellow-countrymen of English speech....\"\n\nContents: Foreword. -- Franko's life and work. -- Selections from Franko's verse: Earlier poems, 1878-1886: Pioneers (I saw a vision strange.

Folk Songs of the Ukraine: an experiment in recording Ukrainian folk songs by phonograph during a musical ethnological excursion to the province of Poltava in 1903. With an appendix of 18 songs, words and music. Translated from the Russian by Maria Safonoff. Pref. by Alfred J. Swan. Godfrey, Illinois: Monticello College Press, n.d. vii, 48 pages.\n\nAlfred J. Swan's preface dated: 4 January 1958. Harvard University Library copy stamped: November 12, 1958.\n\nThe main part of the volume (pp.1-32) consists of a scholarly report by E. Linieff written in 1904 on her excursions to the \"districts of Mirgorod, Lyubensk, Horolsk and Zolotonoshensk\" in the province of Poltava to attempt - for the first time - to record Ukrainian folk songs \"by a method which is free of all subjective influence, and thus to preserve the songs in their pure form and in all their spontaneous melodic beauty,\" i.e., by phonographic notation. \"According to what I was able to hear and to record, \" writes Linieff, \"the songs that retain most of their originality in text as well as in melody are the ceremonial songs Vesnyanky (songs dedicated to spring), Petrivky (for St. Peter's Day), Kolyadky (Christmas carols) and wedding songs. Next come the meditative songs and spiritual songs of the Kobsary and Lirnyky, blind singers playing their accompaniments on these two musical instruments: kobsa and lyre. Next are the songs of the Chumaky (travelling tradesmen), and the Burlaky (hired laborers), then the Cossack historical songs, and finally the lyric and the jesting songs: Tryndichky (humorous songs sung at village evening parties and others.\" \"In all my excursions for the purpose of collecting folk songs,\" continues Linieff, \"the phonograph helped me to comprehend most accurately the peculiarities of the performances of the people, the structure of Ukrainian songs, and to collect material though small in volume yet rich in interest (120 songs in all). On the basis of these recordings, an important theoretical and practical study of folk songs may be made.\"\n\nPreface by Alfred J. Swan, professor of music at Haverford College, provides some data about E. Linieff. Born in 1854 into a family of Baltic-German origin, Eugenia von Papritz spent her youth in Kiev and was trained for a singer's career. After hearing one day a band of pilgrims sing folk songs and ballads, she decided to devote her life to the collection and preservation of the old folk songs. She married in 1880 the construction engineer Linieff, and for political reasons spent some time in England and America. In 1896, after an amnesty, they returned to Russia and Eugenia continued her work on the folk songs until her death in 1919. \"The fate of her dossier (some 2,000 songs) is as yet unknown,\" writes A.J. Swan. Only 65 of all the innumerable melodies recorded by Eugenia Linieff have been published. The Appendix (pp.33-48) contains the following \"Texts of Songs from the Province of Poltava. Translated from the Ukrainian by Maria Safonoff\" [sic: not as stated on the main title page \"from the Russian\"]: Sleep, lulla, lullaby. -- A playful, little kitten. -- Marynka stood alone in the field. -- Our little Marynka, the bather (Little Marynka, the bather). -- Along the countryside. -- So short is the night - the Petrivochka. -- Up above the blackthorn shrubs. -- The large crane is strutting on the hill. -- Oh, thou forest green. -- See how the falcon's flying. -- At the gates of Jerusalem. -- If your boss's purse is tight. -- Walking down the valley. --\"Our Lord's Passion.\" -- Morosenko. -- Woe to thee, poor sea gull. -- South to Crimea a traveling merchant went this year. -- Wind is blowing. -- O, whose is this cottage.\n\nB35.

Matthews, William Kleesman. Taras Sevcenko: the Man and the Symbol. / by W.K. Matthews. London: Association of Ukrainians in Great Britain, 1951. 16 pages.\n\nW.K Matthews, professor of Russian at the University of London and head of the Department of Language and Literature at the School of Slavonic and East European Studies, was invited by the Association of Ukrainians in Great Britain to deliver an address on the occasion of the 90th anniversary of Shevchenko's death. The address was given at St. Pancras Hall, London, on 11 March 1951. In his address Mathews speaks of Shevchenko's affinity with Ukrainian folk poetry, proving at the same time through his analysis of Shevchenko's versification technique that the poet was not \"a simple imitator of folk-songs.\" In his comparison of Shevchenko with Burns, the author stresses both similarities and differences between the two poets. Matthews feels that \"the transition from Romanticism to Realism\" may \"be followed as plainly in Sevcenko's painting as in his literary work\" and that Shevchenko's \"patriotism plays a highly important part in his poetry and has been rightly chosen by nationally-minded Ukrainians for special emphasis, just as the rather less important social criticism in his work has been emphasized by those intent on proving his revolutionary affiliations.\" The author's \"Note on Transliteration\" appears on p.16.\n\nB43.

Schevchenko, the National Poet of Oukraina : a biographical sketch by L.P. Rastorgoueff. London: Printed by Jordan & Sons, n.d. [1911?]. 12 pages.\n\nThe first separately published essay in English on a topic of Ukrainian literature. Written on the occasion of \"the fiftieth anniversary of the death of the poet-slave, Taras Gregorievitch Schevchenko\" it presents the poet's life against the background of another 50th anniversary \"celebrated\" in Russia a week earlier, namely that of the emancipation of the slaves. Shevchenko is described by Rastorguev as \"equal in genius to the well-known poet Pushkin,\" but at the same time as \"almost unknown in Western Europe.\" Because of enforced Russification and repressive attitudes of the Russian government, says Rastorguev, the poetry of Shevchenko can \"only be appreciated by a comparatively limited number of educated people who, in spite of persecution, have remained loyal to their mother tongue, and still cherishing the memory of their country's past independence, cling to a hope of a future revival of her national character.\"\n\nLev Pavlovich Rastorguev was born in Russia in 1869. After taking part in the 1905 revolution, he fled to France in 1907 and later settled in England. Rastorguev was a lawyer by profession, a member of the Russian Bar and also of the Middle Temple. He was the author of a 91-page pamphlet on Russian corporation law, The Legal Position of English Companies in Russia (London: Jordan & Sons, 1911) and of a number of articles published in English legal journals. On 24 July 1917 he read a paper before the Grotius Society entitled \"The Revolution and the Unity of Russia\" which was published later in Grotius Society's Problems of the War (London: 1918, vol.3, pp.91-98). In it Rastorguev exhibited his thorough familiarity with the history of Ukrainian-Russian relations, his sympathies toward the political aspirations of Ukrainians, as well as his hope that Ukraine would choose to remain as a free member state in a future federated democratic Russia. Rastorguev died in England in 1924.\n\nB54. Rudnyckyj, J.B. Readings in Canadian Slavic Folklore, II : texts in English translation. / Compiled and edited by J.B. Rudnyckyj.
