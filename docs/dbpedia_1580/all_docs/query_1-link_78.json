        "text": "Lenin died, but his business is alive - they said in the USSR.\n\nThen, of course, his business was ratted out. And Komsomol members ratted out it. Like our Tigipko and hundreds of the same. They quickly switched to business. Due to the connections (which they drank during the drunkenness of the Komsomol conferences) - they established business relations, which were broken during the proclamation of Independence.\n\nThey had their own, special corporate spirit. With celebrations in October of the Komsomol Day. With the promotion of their friends to key positions.\n\nIn general, no matter what party these people were in, they were Komsomol members. Not Leninists, but Komsomol members in spirit. That is, with a small set of values and principles.\n\nWe will not generalize. Not everyone was the same.\n\nBut the trend is clear.\n\nThat’s what I’m talking about. We still appoint people here on the same principle. Because Zelensky lacks new faces.\n\nBut the best Komsomol members are those who, in addition to the Komsomol badge, carried KGB shoulder straps in their pockets, and there were portraits of Iron Felix in their purses between dollar bills.\n\nThey are still running in Ukraine. Some have been declassified.\n\nSo what? - you will say - he was cut and imprisoned? - as Vysotsky once sang.\n\nNope, he is free and engaged in personnel policy.\n\nThe name of the Komsomol volunteer is Andriy Derkach, Kuchma’s own godson.\n\nHere’s a short detective.\n\nOnce Andriy Derkach, who managed Energoatom, hired and raised a promising guy Herman Halushchenko for loyalty.\n\nLater even Halushchenko was employed by the Ministry of Justice under Yanukovych. He headed the judicial department there. So he had close ties with Portnov.\n\nAnd now attention!\n\nHalushchenko received a sharp career boost: he was appointed as a Deputy Prime Minister of Energoatom in May 2020.\n\nAnd it was in the spring of 2020 that Andriy Derkach, Herman’s curator, made sharp attacks against Joe Biden.\n\nA coincidence? I do not think so.\n\nAt the same time, Volodymyr Oleksandrovych laughed at Derkach’s tapes and said: Wait for more. Than with childish spontaneity he burned down all office.\n\nThat is, he indirectly proved the connection between Derkach (read: FSB) and the President’s Office.\n\nHence, we make the assumption that they paid off with these positions Derkach, who climbed the embrasure as Sasha Matrosov.\n\nThen the scheme was adjusted:\n\nThus, in September-November Energoatom sold its electricity at 0.68 - 0.85 kopecks per kWh, while the economically reasonable price (at that time) was 1.2 UAH per kWh. Holy shit, right?\n\nAnd who bought these volumes?\n\nRight. Traders of Rinat Leonidovych and Ihor Valeriiovych.\n\nThe amount of the rollback to the President’s Office is unknown. But everyone earned quiet enough.\n\nAnd you and I paid for it.\n\nThat is, so that we understand that by clicking on the light in the kitchen all last year we helped not only Kolomoisky to earn. But for making videos of Zelensky. Well, producers and screenwriters received well enough too.\n\nAnd now the cherry on top.\n\nDerkach was busted in the United States. And his case is alive.\n\nThe Servants of the People, together with their associates from Trust (Dovira) and For the Future and deputies loyal to Akhmetov from OPZZh are going to appoint Herman Hlushchenko as the Minister of Energy.\n\nAnd believe me, there will be enough votes. Because both the President’s Office and the oligarchs’ offices are interested here.\n\nAnd children, in those difficult times, in 2021, President Zelensky began an uncompromising struggle against the oligarchs."
