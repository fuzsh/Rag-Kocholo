Furthermore, the issue of using water tunnels for scientific and training purposes was explained. The technology of 3D printed models for practical tests in a water tunnel was also presented. The experiment included conducting flow visualisation tests for three airfoil models: with the Clark Y 11.7% as the base airfoil and the same airfoil with a slot and a flap. Moreover, a modification to dye injection system was introduced. The presented results of flow visualisation around models with the use of dye, confirmed the effectiveness of the applied methodology. The results and conclusions may be utilized to verify most flow-related issues in hydrodynamic tunnels and can also be used as a training element. water tunnel testing\n\nairfoil\n\nflaps\n\nslots2017124663-7810.2478/TAR-2017-0007Transactions on Aerospace Research Dawid ZaduraImportance of personal data protection law for commercial air transportAir transportationIn the review below the author presents a general overview of the selected contemporary legal issues related to the present growth of the aviation industry and the development of aviation technologies. The review is focused on the questions at the intersection of aviation law and personal data protection law. Massive processing of passenger data (Passenger Name Record, PNR) in IT systems is a daily activity for the contemporary aviation industry. Simultaneously, since the mid- 1990s we can observe the rapid growth of personal data protection law as a very new branch of the law. The importance of this new branch of the law for the aviation industry is however still questionable and unclear. This article includes the summary of the author’s own research conducted between 2011 and 2017, in particular his audits in LOT Polish Airlines (June 2011-April 2013) and Lublin Airport (July - September 2013) and the author’s analyses of public information shared by International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO), International Air Transport Association (IATA), Association of European Airlines (AEA), Civil Aviation Authority (ULC) and (GIODO). The purpose of the author’s research was to determine the applicability of the implementation of technical and organizational measures established by personal data protection law in aviation industry entities. aviation industry\n\naviation law\n\naviation security2017124635-4410.2478/TAR-2017-0004Transactions on Aerospace Research Marcelina Bobrowska, Michał Barcikowski, Radosław RybczyńskiResearch of Dependence of the Damage Area on Tow Width on Filament-Wound Composite TubesAircraft structuresThis paper explores the effect of tow width on the damage area produced by high velocity impacts on glass fiber/epoxy composite structures made by filament winding. The subject of the research were a four-layered composite tubes that have been designed using matrix method. The method was used to select mosaic patterns with different rest of the winding stroke and number of interlaces, which are places of stress concentration and which affect the strength of the composite. The narrowest (5 mm) and the widest (17 mm) tow width available was chosen. Composite filament-wound structures were subjected to a high velocity impact by a 2.0 g spherical hardened steel impactor propelled to a velocity of 140 ÷ 170 m/s using a gas gun.

During the test, the package of sheets was treated as a 3D orthotropic material. The values of Young’s and Kirchhoff’s moduli for a pre-compressed package of sheets, in accordance with the used manufacturing technology of the medium and high power electric motors’ rotors, were detennined. The carried out FEM comparative calculations confirmed that the determined mechanical parameters of the package of sheets as a 3D orthotropic material, i.e. Young’s and Kirchhoff’s moduli, for the compressive stress range of 1.0÷2.5 MPa, are included in the linear range. It was assumed that the determined mechanical properties of the package of sheets are necessary at the design stage for FEM simulation calculations of the electric motors’ vibration and strength properties. As a result of the tests, it was found that they should be repeated in order to determine the properties of other sheets or those coated with different insulating lacquer. asynchronous motor\n\npackage of sheets\n\nFEM\n\nvibration2017124654-6210.2478/TAR-2017-0006Transactions on Aerospace Research Michał SokołowskiProcess of Preparing and Laying Carbon PrepregsCOMPOSITE MATERIALSThis article contains information on the technological process involved in the production of a composite structure with carbon-epoxy prepregs including critical parameters of the process.

Coupons with holes made with standard (drilling and milling) methods showed fastener pull-through resistance higher, on average, by 6.5% than in coupons with holes placed during plate production. Fastener work to rupture was also higher for coupons with milled and drilled holes.

A new type of specimens of variable cross-sectional area measuring part was used for the tests. This provided a continuous distribution of plastic strain in that part of the sample. The proposed method enables to replace a series of specimens by one specimen. The degradation of the material was obtained by static tensile test and the creep test. The permanent deformation that varies along the specimen axis allows for an analysis of damage induced by a plastic deformation. The degradation of the alloy corresponds with the changes of acoustics properties of the material - attenuation of ultrasonic waves. It allows to detennine the degree of damage to the material using a non-invasive - ultrasonic method. Using the damage parameter proposed by Johnson allows to obtain correlation between the non-destructive results and a damage degree of the material. The presented testing method delivers information about changes in the material structure caused by permanent deformation. material degradation\n\nultrasonic wave attenuation factor\n\ndamage parameter\n\nnon-destructive testing20171246104-11610.2478/TAR-2017-0010Transactions on Aerospace Research Wiesław KrzymieńMechanical properties of the package of ferromagnetic sheetsMaterialsThe paper presents the measurement method and results as well as the results of comparative calculations aimed at determination of material data for the package of ferromagnetic sheets insulated with epoxy lacquer.

The role of human capital has been presented in the article, thus the need for training organization has been demonstrated to improve quality of work. The article also describes characteristics of the training market, defining types of projects addressed to representatives of the most often trained groups in the research and development unit, like professionals, managers and research workers. Methods and tools aiding the training system analysis and monitoring have also been introduced in the text with a goal to reflect customer, employer, and trainee satisfaction. A process of raising qualifications of employees was described at the Institute of Aviation. It has been found that internal trainings from the subject matter of “project management” are the best solution for research and development centers. training\n\nproject life cycle\n\nresearch and development unit2017124615-2610.2478/TAR-2017-0002Transactions on Aerospace Research Adam Rosłowicz, Paweł BednarczykAnalysis of heat transfer in a supersonic rocket headROCKET TECHNOLOGYDesign of supersonic H1 rocket by the Rocketry Group of Students’ Space Association (SR SKA) requires an analysis of thermal phenomena occurring in the elements particularly exposed to the high temperature gas. This paper contains a description of the methodology and the results of numerical simulation of heat transfer in the elements of the rocket head. The starting points were the flight conditions (3 characteristic points defined by altitude and Mach number) and independently calculated adiabatic temperature field of the gas. ANSYS Fluent code was used to determine the temperature field on the surface of the rocket. Computed cases were viscous and inviscid flow (for comparison). Based on the results formulated for the viscous case heat transfer boundary conditions, the numerical model and the thermophysical properties of materials were defined. The model was limited to a brass top part of the head and a part of a composite dome. Analytical and empirical method of “intermediate enthalpy” determined distribution of the heat transfer coefficient on the rocket surface. Then the transient heat transfer was calculated with the ANSYS system. It included the range from the rocket launch, moment of maximum Mach number to sufficient structure cooling.

Rapid development and wide availability of mobile devices equipped with powerful processors and with a wide range of modern communication connections suggests their high usability for enterprise IT systems. In the Department of Avionics and Air Armament of the Military University of Technology (WAT) an ERP-class (Enterprise Resource Planning) system, intended to support aircraft maintenance [4] has been designed and developed. The main concept of the system is to store the aircraft related and maintenance information in a central repository, i.e. in databases hosted on a central database server. This solution ensures concurrent availability of the data to a large group of authorized users. The key components of the system include the database server and client applications, which ensure access to centralized information resources, according to assigned user rights. The project involves development of client applications using three technologies: web, desktop and mobile one. Developed client applications have successfully passed integration tests perfomed using sample maintenance data. Currently works on user authorization security and wireless data security are under way. maintenance system\n\nmobile application\n\naircraft201722477-1810.2478/TAR-2017-0011Transactions on Aerospace Research Albert Zajdel, Cezary Szczepański, Mariusz Krawczyk, Jerzy Graffstein, Piotr MasłowskiSelected Aspects of the Low Level Automatic Taxi Control System ConceptAircraft operationsTaxiing of manned and remotely piloted aircraft is still performed by pilots without using a system of automatic control of direction and speed. Several reasons have emerged in recent years that make the automation of taxiing an important design challenge. The reasons are: decreased airport capacity due to the growing number of aircraft, poor ground operation conditions during poor visibility conditions, an increase in workload of pilots and air traffic controllers and the integration of simultaneous ground operations of manned and remotely piloted air vehicles. This paper presents selected aspects of the concept of a Low Level Automatic Taxi Control System. In particular, it emphasizes the means of controlling an aircraft during taxiing, accuracy requirements of the system and proposes control techniques. The resulting controller of the system is adaptable for different aircrafts. The actuators and their mechanical connections to available controls are the aircraft specific part and are designed for the particular type – in this case – a general aviation light airplane. taxi\n\ntaxiing\n\nautomatic taxi\n\ntaxi control system2017224769-7910.2478/TAR-2017-0016Transactions on Aerospace Research Rafał Chatys, Anna Stefańska, Krzysztof Piernik, Konrad StefańskiEstimation of Strength Parameters of Aviation Products Made of Polymer Composites Based on Markov Chain TheoryAircraft structuresThe study investigates the fatigue strength of a component made of a glass composite material with polyester matrix, manufactured using a contact method (I) and by vacuum bagging (II). Modeling was carried out only for composite material II, due to significant spread of the strength of the composite material manufactured by contact lamination I, which means that such a material does not guarantee repeatability of the test results. Estimation of the composite material fatigue strength and residual strength was performed using a mathematical model based on the Markov chain theory.

That system continuously controls the spatial position of the center of body mass. To measure that value directly is a complex metrological task. That is why an equivalent measure is used in tests of standing posture stability, i.e. the position of a projection of the center of mass on a supporting plane. posturography\n\nbody mass center position\n\nbalance system\n\nforce platform2017224745-5610.2478/TAR-2017-0014Transactions on Aerospace Research Jacek Pieniążek, Paulina RybaEddy-Current Sensor for a TachometerAvionicsThe speed of a rotor or rotors of a turbine engine is important information on its operation. Due to the specific conditions, in which the measurement is taken in a turbine engine, which in particular applies to small engines that are becoming increasingly popular in manned and unmanned aviation, the most universal detector is the detector using the phenomenon of eddy currents. This article presents the developed detector system solution. The correct operation of a detector is conditional upon the possibility to detect the presence of a blade in the detection field in a reliable manner, while maintaining the resistance to interference. The developed system is resistant to changes in parameters due to the use of a differential system consisting of two detector coils connected in a bridge circuit, a rectifier circuit with filters acting as a demodulator and a comparator. The system works with a microprocessor performing data processing functions. The executed functional model was tested in a laboratory, which enabled to determine its characteristics in several configurations and to confirm its correct operation. rotational speed\n\neddy currents\n\nmeasurement system2017224757-6810.2478/TAR-2017-0015Transactions on Aerospace Research Bogusław Dołęga, Grzegorz Kopecki, Andrzej TomczykAnalytical Redundancy in Control Systems for Unmanned Aircraft and Optionally Piloted VehiclesAvionicsThe article presents key properties of a module intended to estimate non-measurable state variables of an aircraft (a fixed-wing aircraft).

Several reasons have emerged in recent years that make the automation of taxiing an important design challenge. The reasons are: decreased airport capacity due to the growing number of aircraft, poor ground operation conditions during poor visibility conditions, an increase in workload of pilots and air traffic controllers and the integration of simultaneous ground operations of manned and remotely piloted air vehicles. This paper presents selected aspects of the concept of a Low Level Automatic Taxi Control System. In particular, it emphasizes the means of controlling an aircraft during taxiing, accuracy requirements of the system and proposes control techniques. The resulting controller of the system is adaptable for different aircrafts. The actuators and their mechanical connections to available controls are the aircraft specific part and are designed for the particular type – in this case – a general aviation light airplane. taxi\n\ntaxiing\n\nautomatic taxi\n\ntaxi control system2017224769-7910.2478/TAR-2017-0016Transactions on Aerospace Research Bartosz Brzozowski, Karol Kawka, Krzysztof Kaźmierczak, Zdzisław Rochala, Konrad WojtowiczSupporting the Process of Aircraft Maintenance with Mobile DevicesMaintenanceMaintenance of aircraft is a complex process and therefore, in order to optimize the process, integrated information systems are increasingly used. Rapid development and wide availability of mobile devices equipped with powerful processors and with a wide range of modern communication connections suggests their high usability for enterprise IT systems. In the Department of Avionics and Air Armament of the Military University of Technology (WAT) an ERP-class (Enterprise Resource Planning) system, intended to support aircraft maintenance [4] has been designed and developed. The main concept of the system is to store the aircraft related and maintenance information in a central repository, i.e. in databases hosted on a central database server. This solution ensures concurrent availability of the data to a large group of authorized users. The key components of the system include the database server and client applications, which ensure access to centralized information resources, according to assigned user rights. The project involves development of client applications using three technologies: web, desktop and mobile one. Developed client applications have successfully passed integration tests perfomed using sample maintenance data. Currently works on user authorization security and wireless data security are under way. maintenance system\n\nmobile application\n\naircraft201722477-1810.2478/TAR-2017-0011Transactions on Aerospace Research Wojciech KoniorParticle-in-cell Electrostatic Numerical AlgorithmAerodynamicsExisting global models of interaction between the solar wind (SW) and the local interstellar medium (LISM) describe the heliosphere that arises as a result of this interaction.

Basic assumptions, which such a system has to fulfill in terms of functionality and accuracy, are presented. The concept of the ISAN system is based on the implementation of inertial navigation system which the only one to permit fully autonomous functioning. Measurement sensors of the navigation system with microprocessor board are placed in the rescuer’s shoe. To limit the escalation of the navigation errors value, which in the case of inertial navigation rises exponentially, a procedure of navigation parameters upgrading at every step of the rescuer is introduced to the proposed system. This procedure guarantees the required accuracy of navigation achievement. The article describes a developed and manufactured demonstrator of the technology and presents main results of its research. The research conducted in a building consisted in walking on the same level several hundred meters in less than 10 minutes. A walking test with a change of walking height was also performed in order to estimate the accuracy of the vertical channel. Results of the demonstrator’s tests let us conclude that the error of navigation is below 1% of the travelled distance and the accuracy is linear in respect to time. The achieved accuracy is fully sufficient for a practical IANS application. rescuer navigation system\n\ninertial navigation system\n\nZUPT procedure\n\nIndividual Autonomous Navigation System\n\nIANS2017324884-10610.2478/TAR-2017-0023Transactions on Aerospace Research Jan KindrackiTemperature Measurements in the Detonation Chamber Supplied by Air from Centrifugal Compressor and Gaseous HydrogenPropulsionIn this paper, the experimental results of a detonation chamber fed by air from a centrifugal compressor are presented.

Amicell, a high density lithium polymer battery manufactured by the Israeli Amit Industries ltd., was selected for testing. The test results present characteristics of the batteries tested in different temperatures and allow for designing and trying out proper battery protections against environmental conditions, with the intention to attain continuous and correct operation.

The detection and survivability of helicopters on a battlefield significantly depends on their infrared emissions level, as well as the methods, equipment and systems used by potential enemy. The automatic detection systems, recognition and identification of flying objects use among other the thermo-detection methods, which rely on detecting the infrared radiation emitted by the tracked object. Furthermore, due to low-altitude and relatively low flight speed, today’s combat assets like missile weapons equipped with infrared guidance systems are one of the most important threats to the helicopters performing combat missions. Especially meaningful in a helicopter aviation is infrared emission by exhaust gases, egressed to the surroundings. Due to high temperature, exhaust gases are a major factor in detectability of a helicopter performing air combat operations. In order to increase the combat effectiveness and survivability of military helicopters, several different types of the infrared suppressor (IRS) have been developed. This paper reviews contemporary developments in this discipline, with particular examples of the infrared signature suppression systems. infrared\n\nmilitary helicopter\n\nstealth\n\nradiation suppression2017324863-8310.2478/TAR-2017-0022Transactions on Aerospace Research Wojciech KoniorParticle-in-cell Electrostatic Numerical AlgorithmSpace observationsExisting global models of interaction between the solar wind (SW) and the local interstellar medium (LISM) describe the heliosphere that arises as a result of this interaction.

Increasing of the solid laminate thickness, adding plies and inserting a short resin or adhesive filler into the core tip area lead to significant stress reduction, whereas in the transition point, from tapering to constant thickness sandwich, increasing radius is more efficient than reinforcing plies in regard to reduce stress concentration.

Thanks to its design there is a possibility to attach to it a measuring apparatus, modules like auto-pilot, and weights. It can be also used to test wide range of rotors and other components which makes it very universal research tool. To achieve those goals the whole frame and landing gear has been redesigned using NX 11 CAD/CAM/CAE to achieve desired cargo space and weight distribution. Additionally the tail has been lengthened to allow use of the rotors with bigger diagonal. All the applied changes has been made to increase the machine payload. The designed elements were fabricated and the helicopter has been tested in flight. During the test flights several performance parameters were measured. helicopter\n\nrotor\n\nmodification2017424935-4710.2478/TAR-2017-0027Transactions on Aerospace Research Wieńczysław StalewskiImprovement and Optimisation of Gyroplane PerformanceROTORCRAFT TECHNOLOGYThe aim of this study was to investigate possibilities of improving performance characteristics of light gyroplane, as well to propose new or improved solutions enhancing performance of this type of rotorcraft. The study has been conducted based on computational methods of Computational Fluid Dynamics, Flight Dynamics, Computer Aided Design and Optimisation. Results of the research confirm that using advanced computational methods it is possible to improve significantly the performance characteristics of light gyroplane. It can be achieved both through optimisation of the main rotor design and flight control strategy. An unconventional approach to rotorcraft optimisation has been presented, distinguishing by the fact that the objective was calculated based on computer simulations of selected states of gyroplane flight. One of the optimised main rotors had already been examined during flight tests, which confirmed its good perfonnance-and-exploitation properties and its advantage over classic gyroplane rotors. Developed by the author the family of gyroplane airfoils is a valuable alternative to classic airfoils utilised so far. The same applies to the blades built based on those airfoils. In particular, it concerns the unconventional design of the rotor blade of span-variable: chord and relative thickness. The developed methodology of numerical optimisation of flight-control strategy during the jump takeoff of the gyroplane presents an original approach to those problems and may be valuable tool supporting gyroplane-pilot training. rotorcraft performance\n\ngyroplane\n\njump takeoff\n\nmain rotor\n\ndesign and optimisation20174249103-12210.2478/TAR-2017-0031Transactions on Aerospace Research Joanna Gocłowska-BolekLatin American Space Research as a Regional and Supra-Regional Research Cooperation MechanismScientific co-operationThe interest of Latin American countries in space research has been successfully developing for many decades. It has its roots in the first development programmes for the Brazilian and Argentinian defence industry within the import substitution strategy, and then the export-oriented strategy during the period of the military rule. The endogenous development of space technology was treated in those countries as a priority and served as a way to diffuse technology to other industries, and as a model for the other countries in the region (Peru and Venezuela), which wished to develop outer space programme by developing their own technologies within the chosen range or by partaking in broader cooperation programmes on the Latin American continent [1]. The Latin American space agencies, which already existed in many countries in the 1960s and the 1970s, were carrying out relatively costly research, treating development in this area not only as the achievement of the economic development objectives, but also as an attempt to oppose the dominance of Washington [2]. Despite of the vast funding on endogenous research in the field of space engineering being provided, until the end of the last century only the projects conducted together with the Soviet Union (Cuba) or The United States were accomplished successfully. Currently and in the nearest future, the Latin American countries are still forced to rely on external assistance with satellite launching, expertise, more advanced technologies, etc. It should be noticed that countries conducting advanced and costly space programmes: the United States, Russia, China and the European Union (especially France and – but to a substantially lesser degree – Italy) show a growing interest in cooperation with Latin America and appreciation towards their specialists, high quality research and space technologies.

Many efforts are made to harmonize and optimize the design trying to combine all disciplines together at the same level of detail. Within the ongoing AGILE (Horizon 2020) research, an aircraft MDO (Multidisciplinary Design Optimization) process is setting up connecting several design tools and competences together. Each tool covers a different design discipline such as aerodynamics, structure, propulsion and systems. This paper focuses on the integration of the sub-system design discipline with the others in order to obtain a complete and optimized aircraft preliminary design. All design parameters used to integrate the sub-system branch with the others are discussed as for their redefinition within the different detail level of the design.

The CFD Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) models use a Lagrangian (droplet phase) and Eulerian (fluid phase) procedure to predict the droplet trajectories trough the turbulent aircraft wake. The methods described in the work have the potential to improve current models for aerial spraying and will help in the development of new spraying procedures. In this study, the CFD models are used to describe the phenomenon of sprays released from atomizers mounted on the plane. A parametric study of the aircraft model examines the effects of crosswind on the aircraft’s vortex structures and the resulting droplet trajectories. The study shows, that such influence is underestimated in the current models. A comparison of the present results to AGDISP predictions is provided.

This model was developed in the AVL BOOST software. The ASz-62IR is a nine cylinder, aircraft engine in a radial configuration. It is produced by the Polish company WSK “PZL-Kalisz” S. A. The model is used for calculating parameters of the fuel stream and the air stream in intake system of the engine, as well as for the analyses of the combustion process and the exhaust flow to the external environment. The model is based on the equations describing the isentropic flow. The geometry of the channels and all parts of the model has been mapped on the basis of empirical measurements of the engine elements. The model assumes indirect injection where the gasoline was used as a fuel with the calorific value of 43.5 MJ/kg. The model assumes a mixture of a stoichiometric ratio of 14.5. This model is only part of the overall the ASz-62IR engine model. After the simulation tests on the full model the obtained results confirmed the correctness of the model used to create the mixture. It was found that the AVL BOOST software is good for the implementation of this type of work. aviation propulsion\n\nAVL BOOST\n\nengine model\n\ncharge exchange\n\nmixture formation2018125036-4810.2478/TAR-2018-0004Transactions on Aerospace Research Marek Idzikowski, Wojciech MiksaGround and In-Fligh Testing of Cooling Efficiency of Turboprop Engine CompartmentPropulsionThis article presents selected results of I-31T propulsion tests, obtained in the framework of EU project ESPOSA (Efficient Systems and Propulsion for Small Aircraft).

The three versions of rotor are considered with articulated, elastic and stiff connections of blades and hub. The blades with the same distributions of stiffness, mass and the same aerodynamic characteristics are applied for all rotor cases. The rotor loads are calculated applying Runge-Kutta method to solve the equations of motion of deformable blades. According to the Galerkin method, the parameters of blades motion are treated as combination of considered blade bending and torsion eigen modes. The results of calculations indicate for possibility to generate the greater rotor control moments and to improve helicopter maneuverability in the case of applying the non-changed blade of articulated rotor combined with elastic rotor hub. helicopter\n\nmain rotor\n\nblade deformations20181250119-13610.2478/TAR-2018-0008Transactions on Aerospace Research Krzysztof Szafran, Marcin MichalczykVarious Types of the Rotorcraft Design in the Context of Aerospace Regulations Rotorcraft technologyIn the next article on synthesis of regulations, the authors presented the general legal requirements for rotorcraft, which is limited to US regulations, because the vast majority of world regulations are based on them.

They are used in rescue operations and patrolling difficult areas inaccessible to other means of transport. The Institute of Aviation conducted acoustic measurements inside the cabin of the hovercraft to determine the source of the noise and the sound pressure exerted on the pilot and passengers. Assessment of the sources of noise in the cabin is made using the acoustic beamforming method.

This unsymmetrical, propeller-induced slip-stream produces sideslip [4,5] that needs to be compensated by the pilot using the rudder [6]. In order to relieve the pilot from this additional task, automatic rudder deflection systems are used that compensate for sideslip by trimming the rudder accordingly.
