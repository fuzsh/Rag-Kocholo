        "text": "Ukrainian journalists and human rights groups are calling for the exclusion of hosts who have previously played along with the enemy's rethoric and used to spread kremlin propaganda for many years.\n\nThis is stated in an address to the President of Ukraine and the Minister of Culture and Information Policy of Ukraine regarding the participation of hosts who used to distribute pro-russian propaganda in the \"United News,\" FREEDOM, and other telethons that call themselves \"national.\"\n\nThis is first of all about Vasyl Holovanov, Tigran Martirosyan, Natasha Vlashchenko, Tetyana Honcharova, Nazar Dovhyy, Volodymyr Poluyev, Anna Stepanets, Anastasia Dauhule.\n\nAccording to the address, these hosts have promoted kremlin narratives about Ukraine being ruled externally from the US, \"discrimination\" against the russian language, the \"civil war\" in Donbas, the legitimacy of russia's occupation of Crimea, and more.\n\n\"As none of them have publicly acknowledged the fact that they have been playing along with the enemy for many years, the continued participation of these hosts on air may be used as an indult by them,\" the address says.\n\nThe authors of the address call on the National Council on Television and Radio Broadcasting, the Ministry of Culture and Information Policy of Ukraine, and the owners of TV channels participating in national telethons to exclude these hosts from the air.\n\n\"Now we have the chance to clear out the Ukrainian media space and to set up an institute of reputation to protect Ukraine from repeating the story in the future,\" the statement said.\n\nHere is the full text of the address:\n\nThe address of Ukrainian journalists and public organizations to the President of Ukraine and the Minister of Culture and Information Policy of Ukraine regarding the participation of hosts who used to spread pro-russian propaganda in the \"United News,\" FREEDOM, and other media marathons that call themselves \"national.\"\n\nWith the beginning of the full-scale offensive of the Russian Federation, state, public and private TV channels of Ukraine were able to unite to confront the enemy on the information front. The joint news was a new and unique experience, when during the war, the media has not been subjected to severe censorship, but continued to spread information that is important to the people, from the course of the hostilities to human tragedies and victories.\n\nHowever, the national telethons, including the foreign-language channel FreeDom and other media marathons that call themselves \"national,\" are attended by TV hosts who, until recently, had been working for pro-russian TV channels. The information policy of these channels was based on the promotion of kremlin narratives about US external governance in Ukraine, the \"discrimination\" of the russian language, the \"civil war\" in the Donbas, the legitimacy of russian occupation of Crimea, and more. Various methods have been used for this, from fake US Congress hearings to marathons about \"soroslings\", talks of \"US biolabs\" and even attempts at teleconferences with russia. These hosts are, first of all, Vasyl Holovanov, Tigran Martirosyan, Natasha Vlashchenko, Tetyana Honcharova and Nazar Dovhy, Volodymyr Poluyev, Anna Stepanets, Anastasia Dauhule. We are concerned about the participation of these people in the telethons designed to be a unified information weapon against russian fakes and propaganda.\n\nUkraine has been resisting russian aggression for more than two months. At the same time, the authorities are working out mechanisms for the future restoration of Ukrainian cities and infrastructure. In order not to repeat the mistakes of the post-Maidan period, when some politicians and activists soon felt their own impunity and began to spread pro-russian narratives and outright fakes on TV channels, manipulating the public opinion and the emotions of Ukrainian citizens, we call on the National Council, MCIP, and the national telethons to exclude these hosts from the air, ensure the audit of these people, and, before that, give a public assessment of their participation in the \"United News,\" FREEDOM, and other media marathons that call themselves \"national.\" We propose to contact the monitoring organizations, which are ready to provide the National Council and the MCIP with analytical information on the activities of these TV hosts between 2014 and 2022.\n\nAs none of them have publicly acknowledged the fact that they have been playing along with the enemy for many years, the continued participation of these hosts on air may be used as an indult by them.\n\nWe count on a prompt response from the Ukrainian authorities, first and foremost the President of Ukraine Volodymyr Zelenskyy and the Minister of Culture and Information Policy Oleksandr Tkachenko.\n\nNow we have the chance to clear out the Ukrainian media space and to set up an institute of reputation to protect Ukraine from repeating the story in the future.\n\nSincerely,\n\nNGO
