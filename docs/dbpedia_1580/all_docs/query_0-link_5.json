Eventually, army veterans adapted this coding to everyday language upon their return home. ‘4.5.0’ – “all is well.” Exhibition dates June 2 – July 5, 2018.\n\n03.10.2014 MAIDAN. UKRAINE. ROAD TO FREEDOM. Multi- disciplinary arts exhibition.\n\nPRESS RELEASE >>> New York >>> MAIDAN. UKRAINE. ROAD TO FREEDOM Art created by artists who participated in Ukraine’s uprising against a corrupt regime. The exhibition ‘Maidan. Ukraine. Road to Freedom’ is the artistic expression of Ukrainian artists who participated in Ukraine’s uprising against a corrupt regime. The Ukrainian ‘Maidan’ of 2013-2014 started on November 21, 2013 as a peaceful demonstration and turned into civil unrest on the central square of Kyiv called \"Maidan Nezalezhnosti\" (Independence Square). This peaceful demonstration was initiated by journalists, students, artists, musicians, bloggers and pro-democratic politicians after the government unexpectedly dropped the negotiations with the European Union on an association agreement and instead decided to join Russia’s customs union. Artists were at the center of the demonstrations from very beginning creating protest posters, organizing mass performances and showing their works directly in the square. “Maidan. Ukraine. Road to Freedom” is a multi-disciplinary arts exhibition featuring paintings, photography, original artifacts, strike posters as well as art performance, music and film documentary created by the artists who were active participants of the Maidan events. Matviy Vaisberg created a series of expressive abstract paintings entitled ‘The Wall’ that carries on the spirit of the events. The artist spent every day at demonstrations and painted at night in his studio being emotionally overwhelmed with the ongoing events. Photographs by Igor Gaidai, Oleksandr Glyadyelov, Maksym Dondyuk and Anton Trofymov comprise a series entitled \"Maidan’s Saga\" that is a highly dramatic, psychological, historic and social expression of the peaceful protests that turned into violence. Nothing can compare to the feeling of touching objects used by protesters to defend themselves against brutality of security forces that were part of the corrupt regime. These original artifacts will be presented at the exhibition; wooden and metal shields, cobblestones, burned down pieces of clothes, sticks, helmets, empty Molotov cocktail bottles, firewood logs and a pit fire barrel. Strike posters were an idea of the Facebook community called \"Strike-Plakat\" consisting of eight professional designers and painters who created them and posted them online making it available for everyone to download and use. One poster from this series by Pavel Klubnikin entitled \"I am a drop in the Ocean\" was reproduced by the thousands and became the visual symbol of the peaceful protest. Oleh Denysenko created a commemorative coin dedicated to the Heavenly Hundred. It will be available for sale during the exhibition with all proceeds to go to help volunteers and refugees in Ukraine. Cinema of a civil protest \"#BABYLON’13\" provides a focused lens where the viewer can hear and see what took place inside the Maidan. Finally, the folk-rock band Mandry will perform ‘Music of Maidan.’ The lead musician of the band Foma spent countless days and nights at Maidan’s stage and on barricades: his music is directly inspired by the sound of the Ukrainian Revolution. This exhibition was initially presented on June 5, 2014 at the Checkpoint Charlie Museum in Berlin and later traveled to London where it was on exhibit at the Ukrainian Cultural Center on July 10-13, 2014. The exhibition will open at the Ukrainian Institute of America in New York on October 20, 2014 and will continue through October 27, 2014. An opening reception featuring music and art performance will take place on October 23, 2014 from 6:00 pm to 8:00 pm. A panel discussion with Oleksandr Glyadyelov, Matviy Vaisberg and Serhiy Fomenko to take place on October 24 from 6:00 pm to 7:00 pm.

Kandinsky and Anton Trofymov. All three artists originally lived and studied in Kyiv, Ukraine and moved to Paris (Solomoukha) and New York (Kandinsky and Trofymov). Each artist had to re-define himself in a new city where he lives now. Each artist created a new oeuvre that made him successful in the West. But most importantly, each artist had changed his own image, had come up with a new “self-portrait” that showcases and documents the story of his success. Is such self-portrait a camouflage, a shell behind which the artist remains fragile and vulnerable? Is it the way to show off how adaptive he became? Or is it a self-defining marketing campaign that enhances the artist’s portfolio, making him a supermodel, a ‘face’ of his own art. Without doubt a strong image of the artist will occupy our minds sometimes more than artwork created by him. It will become indivisible from his works. Moreover, only those artists who have redefined themselves via new image in a newly found home will become successful here. The exhibition will open on October 17, 2013 and will continue through October 31.

Contemporary presents BINARY EXISTENCE, a contemporary art exhibition curated by Natasha Ulyanov and Lindsay Sullivan, on view at 506 East 74th Street, July 12th until July 18th, 2012. For BINARY EXISTENCE, Ulyanov and Sullivan have selected a diverse group of emerging artists for a thematic exhibition based on ideas of identity, specifically pondering the duality of reality versus perception. The Upper East Side exhibition features Jess Larson, Anton Kandinsky, Dulce Pinzon, Lee, GanU, Shantell Martin, Yasmine Chatila, and Jin-Seob Yun, all accomplished artists exploring how societal expectations of gender, status, and appearance, as well as historical and current cultural projections, shape public perception and self-identification. Larson`s embroidered \"flash cards\" use imagery from old-fashioned household items paired with text to playfully examine the female role in the household and society. The subject matter and the craft draw from a bygone era where women`s roles were more concretely defined and examine from a contemporary perspective the complexity of the female identity. Kandinsky’s portrait duos are tongue-in-cheek commentaries on the positioning of societal and political celebrities in relation to one another. Beneath their humor, Kandinsky’s paintings highlight a keen perception of the individual’s desire to be someone or something else. Pinzon`s photographs create scenes of Mexican immigrants outfitted as superheroes as they carry out their daily jobs challenging perceptions of significance and status in society. The text included with each photograph includes the amount of money each worker sends home to family each month, suggesting support of family and community may itself be heroic. Using hundreds of handcrafted Korean rubber stamps, Lee, GanU fashions an abstract landscape of characters and symbols that once served as signatures. Each unique stamp personifies the individual, but in the collective, the work resembles an undulating terrain, which symbolize the historic cultural influences on identity. Martin`s stream-of-consciousness black and white drawings scroll along, creating with simple lines scenes of imaginary characters and landscapes that echo the artist`s motto, \"Be More, Do Less.\" In this playful wonderland, Martin allows a freedom to self-reflect on the clutter and noise that obstruct us from existing to the fullest. Jin-Seob Yun`s colorful sculptures examine the role of fashion and appearance as an outward manifestation of identity. Though poised as models on a catwalk, the figures also balance bulbous growths that represent the societal pressures and encumbrances of beauty and physical appearance. Captured through a telescope, Chatila`s haunting photographs expose private moments of individuals through windows around New York City. Examining the subject caught unaware in breaths of repose and vulnerability, these photographs provide a mirror to ask \"Who are you when no one is watching?\" Bringing together stylistically disparate artists rooted in thematic similarity, BINARY EXISTENCE poses no answers, but intends to invite discussion and self-analysis of the pressures, illusions, and preconceptions of identity.

Curated by Kenneth Wayne, Ph.D., the exhibition, The Figure in Modern Sculpture, will include twenty-five works that represent the collective inspiration these artists found in the visual art, music, dance, architecture and machine-age industry of the early twentieth century. In this exhibition, Dr. Wayne posits that, beginning with the second decade of the twentieth century, artists on both sides of the Atlantic broke with academic tradition to depict modern man in original ways, infusing their work with a sense of mystery, mirth and movement, creating a new and dynamic vision of the human figure. The sculpture in the Forum Gallery exhibition begins chronologically with the swirling plaster figure, Kauernde, 1912, by Alexander Archipenko (1887-1964) and includes dancing, standing, kneeling, reclining and performing figures, ending with Chaim Gross’ (1904-1991) Circus Girl of 1957. The Archipenko works are advanced in their modernity, the Gross sculptures are animated forms that crystallize their period, and the curvilinear bronzes of Gaston Lachaise (1882-1935), cubist figures in stone by Jacques Lipchitz (1891-1973), original pieces in five different media by Elie Nadelman (1882-1946), and streamlined interpretations by John Storrs (1885-1956) all collaborate to inform the new vision of their time. Working independently when the Forum Gallery exhibition came into being, Dr. Kenneth Wayne has since been appointed Deputy Director for Curatorial Affairs at The Noguchi Museum in Long Island City. His past positions include being Curator of Modern Art at the Albright-Knox Art Gallery in Buffalo and the Joan Whitney Payson Curator at the Portland Museum of Art in Maine. The Figure in Modern Sculpture is presented by Forum Gallery with the cooperation of the estates or foundations of all six artists, and through the courtesy of private collectors. The Figure in Modern Sculpture is accompanied by a 70-page, fully illustrated catalogue with essay by Dr. Wayne and photography by D. James Dee. # # # An opening reception will be held on Gallery Night on 57th Street, Thursday, May 10, 2012 from 5 p.m. to 8 p.m. Forum Gallery is located at 730 Fifth Avenue at 57th Street, New York.

Borys Kosarev: Modernist Kharkiv, 1915- 1931 includes 82 works on paper by Kosarev, an outsider of the Eastern European Modernist movement and a survivor of Stalin’s intellectual purges in 1930s Ukraine. Borys Kosarev (1897-1994), also known as Boris Kosariev, was a contemporary of prominent Kharkiv, Ukraine artists David Burliuk (1882-1967), Vladimir Tatlin (1885-1953), and Ilya Repin (1844-1930), as well as other celebrated Ukrainian artists such as Kazimir Malevich (1879-1935) and Alexander Archipenko (1887-1964). A master graphic artist, painter, designer, photographer, and book illustrator, Kosarev worked with luminaries such as theater director Les Kurbas (1887-1937), poet Vladimir Mayakovsky (1893-1930), and cinema pioneers Alexander Dovzhenko (1894-1956) and Sergei Eisenstein (1898-1948). One of Kosarev`s closest collaborators in the Kharkiv avant-garde was Volodymyr Bobrytskyi, who emigrated to New York and became a renowned designer, known as Bobri. “Kosarev is barely known in his own country. This first ever exhibition brings to light Kosarev’s prodigious talent and exposes the fundamental relationship between the artist and the site of his creative stimulus, his beloved city, Kharkiv,” said Maria Shust, director of The Ukrainian Museum. “The exhibition will return to Ukraine to be shown at the Kharkiv Museum in 2012. Kosarev’s extensive contribution to Ukrainian Modernism will finally be given its due.” Borys Kosarev’s name will forever be associated with the city of Kharkiv—the place of his birth, death, and a long life devoted to the visual arts. A native son of the fiercely independent Kharkiv territory, which produced some of Ukraine’s most creative cultural personalities, Kosarev epitomizes the spirit of the area and its regional diversity. The contents of the exhibition coincide with the period of Kharkiv’s status as Ukraine’s capital city (1919-1934) and the rise of Constructivism as an ideological aesthetic. It was also the period of Ukrainianization—a government policy that encouraged the revitalization of national culture, only to be quashed through a series of orchestrated purges of its proponents, the Ukrainian intelligentsia, beginning in the 1930s. While it flourished, Ukrainianization brought with it a renaissance of art and culture, serving as an unprecedented gateway into global Modernism through the aesthetic of Constructivism. Sheltered from excessive official scrutiny by working in theater design and as a teacher until his death in 1994, Kosarev survived the Stalin purges and later repressions by intentionally staying “under the radar screen.” Sadly, his own reticence, coupled with the pressures exerted by the political landscape of the times, left Kosarev virtually unknown as a contributor to the Modernist movement. Not unlike Anatol Petrytsky (1895-1964), whose works were called a “serendipitous discovery” by the New York Times (Glueck, Grace. “Ukrainian Modernists, All Alone, Here at Last.” The New York Times, November 4, 2006, B7), Kosarev and his art are yet to be revealed and considered among the important Modernists of the early 20th century. Borys Kosarev: Modernist Kharkiv, 1915-1931 is augmented with several works by his colleagues Vasyl Yermilov (1894-1968) and Maria Syniakova (1890-1984). The exhibition, comprising 88 objects in total, is curated by Myroslava M. Mudrak, Professor of Art History, The Ohio State University. Organized by The Ukrainian Museum (New York), the Kharkiv Art Museum (Ukraine), and Rodovid Gallery (Ukraine), the objects in this exhibition are drawn from the collections of Nadia Kosareva (Kharkiv), the Museum of Theatre, Music and Cinema Arts of Ukraine (Kyiv), the Kharkiv Art Museum, Borys and Tetiana Grynyov (Kharkiv), the VovaTania Gallery (Kharkiv), Dmytro Horbachov (Kyiv), and Oleksander Myzhin (Kharkiv). Borys Kosarev: Modernist Kharkiv, 1915-1931 is accompanied by a catalogue authored by Professor Mudrak with additional essays written by Tetiana Pavlova and Valentyna Chechyk, who co-authored the 2009 monograph Borys Kosarev 1920s: Vid Maliarstva do Tea-Kino-Photo (Borys Kosarev 1920s: From Painting to Thea-Cine-Photo). The exhibition is funded in part by the Stedley Art Foundation (Ukraine) and individual sponsors in the United States.

Anton S. Kandinsky & Ai Weiwei\n\nPress Release >>> China-ism II: Democracy or Economy?>>> Curated by David Rong & Alex Demko September 13, 2011 – October 9, 2011 China has galvanized a powerhouse economy, and its contemporary art is now in a state to deliver a Viagra effect to the contemporary art world at large. When Andy Warhol transformed Mao into a pop art icon through his larger than life portrait, Mao entered the international art scene and became a timeless symbol of what New York-based artist Anton S. Kandinsky calls “China-ism.” “China-ism” is an artistic interpretation of contemporary China – its culture, politics and economy coined by Kandinsky, a non-Asian artist. It also serves as a way for the international art community to reflect on contemporary China via art. The first China-ism exhibition was curated by David Rong and Alex Demko in October of 2009. While China’s economy has changed dramatically over the last twenty years, the state of democracy in the country has not changed at all. Merely an artist seeking and defending his freedom of speech, Ai Weiwei was detained on April 3, 2011 and was held in an unknown location by the Chinese government for 80 days. Just over a month into the artist’s arrest, Alexandra Munroe, Senior Curator of Asian art at the Guggenheim Museum, spoke at the opening of Ai Weiwei’s Circle of Animals/Zodiac Heads in New York City (an opening the artist was formerly scheduled to attend) stating that if there is no freedom of speech, there is no modern art and that the world is not challenging the Chinese government but that the Chinese government is in fact challenging the world. The exhibition, China-ism II: Democracy or Economy?, asks the question: “If China is already changing the world, will the world change China?” The exhibition presents 13 oil paintings by Kandinsky as well as one original photograph, Guard, Seven Frames (1994) and video art I`m walking on the road to Dead Land (2010) by Ai Weiwei. If Wassily Kandinsky’s works are representative of revolutionary change in the early twentieth century, Anton S. Kandinsky has upheld the tradition begun by his forefather. Well known for his “Gemism” paintings, begun in 2004, these works are composed of naturalistic images of gemstones intermingling with flags, ideograms, political figures and celebrities as well as historical and social iconography from China, the former Soviet Union as well as American pop culture. White Box, a 501(c)(3) not-for-profit organization, provides a unique site for curators and artists alike to present exhibitions and explore non-commercial, innovative ideas via projects that range from aesthetically exciting to provocative.

Platform For Cultural Initiatives*in Donetsk. This marks Cai Guo-Qiang’s first solo exhibition in Ukraine and will feature two new site-specific installations by the artist, including a new series of gunpowder drawings produced on the *IZOLYATSIA* campus. The artist will work closely with local painters, miners and volunteers to create the gunpowder drawings on paper. The production process will be open and free to the public, and audience members will be able to witness an artist at work as well as experience first hand the ignition of the gunpowder drawings. The exhibition chronicles Cai’s dialogue with the local community and their history and culture. His work seeks to express the fate of people, specifically the once-glorified laborers of the lower class in a rapidly changing time. The exhibition also reveals new possibilities through contemporary art: by transforming waste into treasure, we inherit and practice the “Socialist ideal” of art for the people and art embedded in life. *Cai Guo-Qiang – 1040M Underground *stems from the artist’s experience in May to the coal and salt mines of the industrial Donbas region. During his visit, Cai descended 1040 meters below ground level and trekked more than 1000 meters in the tunnel, mirroring the same route the coal miners take every day. After his “journey to the center of the earth,” a hike to the top of the *IZOLYATSIA* *terrekon* – as “slag heaps” are known colloquially – unveiled a breathtaking view of the city: white smoke from factory chimneys, a bright orange waterfall of molten steel glistening in the sunset, and statues of coal mining heroes that stand tall all over the city. The first element of the exhibition, *Monuments on Shoulders*, is a gunpowder drawing installation housed in the main gallery. The entire gunpowder drawing making process will take place in front of a live audience. Cai will first lead nine local Socialist Realist painters to sketch 27 mine workers’ portraits in the lobbies of the salt and coal mines. Volunteers will then help carve the images into stencils and Cai will spread different grades and grains of gunpowder onto the canvases according to different effects he wishes to achieve. All 27 portraits will be ignited. The finished gunpowder drawings will be mounted on frames identical to the ones used to hold the portraits of Soviet leaders in propaganda parades, spreading across a mound of coal to the left and a slope of salt to the right in the gallery. The drawings will be lit with mining lamps, hanging from the ceiling like stars. *Nursery Rhymes*, the second component of the exhibition, will be situated in the remnants of a factory building (Shop 2) destroyed by a fire. When visitors enter the space, they will be instantly drawn to the soot-covered interior of the building. Under dim lighting, nine used mining carts line up as if meandering down the track in the tunnel, rocking slowly like cradles. Each “cradle” contains a projection on the canopy: Ukrainian folk songs, Soviet era athletes and other role models, communist propaganda films, documentaries on the glorified lives of miners, and Socialist period art films. Along the sides of the canopy will hang salvaged objects from the days of the factory, such as old musical instruments from the factory club, tiny chess boards from the factory kindergarten, and old workers’ uniforms and tools, all rocking along like a child’s mobile.

The newly formed gallery will open with an inaugural exhibition of paintings by Anatoly Kryvolap at its new exhibition space centrally located at 14 Desyatinna Street in Kyiv. Triptych Gallery was founded in Kyiv in the 1980s with a focus on contemporary Ukrainian art. Dukat Gallery, specializing on secondary market art works, icons, antiques and collectibles has broadened its interests to non-conformism art, Ukrainian art of late 1980s and early 1990s and into contemporary art. Triptych Art Gallery, the newly formed entity will track latest trends of Ukrainian art market by bringing to the public two new exhibitions monthly. The gallery provides art advisory services to institutional and private collectors. The inaugural exhibition of Triptych Art Gallery will feature recent works by Anatoly Kryvolap. The artist was born in the town of Yagotin, Kyiv region in 1946. He graduated from the Painting Department of the Kyiv State Art Institute in 1976. Anatoly Kryvolap is a member of the National Union of Artists of Ukraine. Denis Milhaud, the curator of Augustine Museum, Toulouse wrote: “Anatoly Kryvolap, with his strong personality, embodies the gist of figurative and expressive color by means of which his representativeness and uniqueness shine through – the color reveals itself and its fanciful rampage being more true-to-life and effective than the reality depicted by the artist.” On May 13, 2011 a painting by Anatoliy Kryvolap entitled Steppe, 2009, 140 x 200 cm, lot 310 sold for $98,500 (with an estimate of $30,000) at Phillips de Pury & Co. Contemporary Art Sale in New York. This is the record price paid for an artwork by contemporary Ukrainian artist at a public auction. The exhibition of Anatoliy Kryvolap will run from May 27 through June 9, 2011 at Triptych Art Gallery.

The conference is being presented twenty years after the fall of the Soviet Union, a time of continued uncertainty in Eastern Europe. The conference will focus on political and cultural nonconformism in Ukraine, Russia, and Poland in the 1960s to 80s. It will bring together an international assemblage of scholars studying that period of time as well several noteworthy dissidents and artists. The conference will offer a historical overview of the period and will present the latest research conducted on the subject. Additionally, the conference will provide an analysis of the political and cultural legacies of these movements in today’s Ukraine, Russia, and Poland. Among the questions the conference aims to address are: Where are the dissidents and cultural leaders of the Soviet era underground today? Are they in positions of power? Are they influential political figures or gurus in contemporary culture? Do they represent their people in the world as they once did? What media forums are available for their voices? Do Ukraine, Russia, Poland, and the world need them today? The conference will examine these issues through a series of scholarly panels as well as roundtable discussions featuring prominent Soviet-era dissidents and nonconformist artists. The three-day conference will begin with an evening keynote address by Dr. Myroslav Marynovych, former Ukrainian dissident and prisoner of conscience and, currently, Vice-rector for the University Mission of the Ukrainian Catholic University (L`viv, Ukraine); the address will be followed by a reception. Days two and three will include panels and roundtables followed by cultural programming in the evenings showcasing achievements in nonconformist film, music and literature of this era. \"Nonconformism and Dissent in the Soviet Bloc: Guiding Legacy or Passing Memory?\" will feature presentations by over twenty individuals: Myroslav Marynovych, Pavel Litvinov, Henryk Wujec, Vitaly Komar, Ewa Wójciak, Volodymyr Dibrova, Mykola Riabchuk, Peter Reddaway, Ann Komaromi, Benjamin Nathans, Alexander Motyl, Justyna Beinek, Ksenya Kiebuzinski, Michael Bernhard, Jeri Laber, Mark Andryczyk, Orest Deychakiwsy, Catharine Nepomnyashchy, Anna Procyk, Christina Isajiw, William Risch, Anna Frajlich-Zajac, Yuri Shevchuk, Timothy Frye, Tarik Amar, Frank Sysyn, and Victor Morozov.

Pink Zuckerberg Show\n\nShriftman Media, New York, New York, December 20, 2010 Chair and the Maiden and Fund Art Now are proud to announce the inaugural opening of CATM chelsea to the Chelsea Art community at 500 West 22nd Street, NYC. CATM chelsea will waste no time in bringing intriguing, controversial and timely exhibitions, shaking up the traditionally established Chelsea community with Anton S. Kandinsky`s La Roulette en Rose; the world according to Kandinsky a.k.a. Pink Zuckerberg; all said and done Pop is Simple With the debut of his new genre, Kandinsky evens the scoreboard with the use of monochromatic pinks. Kandinsky equalizes and equates past and present icons in a contradictory and simplistic manner that only underlies its revolutionary qualities. The derivation of the play/act of the roulette was to put faith into a higher power, living life to its fullest and the appreciation of its continuance. It provided knowing of purpose. \"Every Kandinsky jewel is a gleaming joke on human nature...\"- Richard Vine, Editor, Art in America A wry humorist and visual social commentator, Kandinsky has a unique perspective of world politics and theoretical shifts of political mood. Emigrating from the Ukraine has allowed Kandinsky to see the world from outside looking in and what he sees is a general lament for a lost, directionless world. He reflects on past times when men were men of faith and romantic bravado, times of machismo and a time when the world was conquerable. Kandinsky has realized what we lack, living in a world where our \"men of strength\" are the likes of Oprah Winfrey and Mark Zuckerberg, and finds the emasculating technological present short of physical challenge. Not being able to satisfy the natural aggressive urge that nature has burdened man with, man`s purpose has diminished. With a soothsayer`s false optimism, looking through rose colored glasses at a world whose heroes are mere impressions of historic reference, Kandinsky takes charge and confronts the world as painter and master satirist. Kandinsky predicts...

The artist’s hometown is Kherson. The Kherson’s Art Museum has a permanent exposition of works by Tolkunov. The artist is known for his portraits, still life and genre paintings. A separate series of paintings is dedicated to visiting of Svyato-Uspensky Pskov-Pechersk Monastery. Tolkunov visits the monastery every year because one of his sons is a monk there. These works reflect personal experience of the artist and a close attachment to this holy place. The artist keeps very strong work discipline. He says: “If I do not work for even one day, I feel sick and regretful about the day spent in vain”. “To work for my own spirit” is the greatest joy of the artist.\n\n14.11.2010 2010 Budapest Art Fair\n\nNo fewer than 25 galleries from 12 different countries are taking part in the 2010 Budapest Art Fair – in a special new section devoted to the art of Central & Eastern Europe: HEROES CORNER. As well as honouring the pioneering efforts of the region`s artists and galleries, HEROES CORNER refers to the Fair’s venue: the Belle Epoque Mücsarnok (Art Hall) on grandiose Hősök Tere (Heroes` Square), situated at the far end of Andrassy Avenue, the `Champs-Elysées of Central Europe.` HEROES SQUARE has also been adopted as the new name for the Budapest Art Fair – which was founded in 1994 and this year splits into two separate events, with furniture and objets d’art granted their own fair, Antik Enteriőr, at the Ethnography Museum. Meanwhile the rebranded flagship event – Budapest`s Modern & Contemporary Art Fair – remains on… HEROES SQUARE. In total some sixty galleries, half from Hungary, will be exhibiting at HEROES SQUARE Budapest Art Fair. The fair runs November 25-28 (VIP opening November 24). The Budapest Art Fair has a track record in attracting prominent foreign galleries. Prestigious past exhibitors include Pascal Lansberg (Paris), Galerie Hilger (Vienna), Le Minotaure (Paris/Tel Aviv), Knoll (Vienna/Budapest/Moscow), and Gilden’s Arts (London) – to name but a few. Now the Fair aims to exploit Budapest’s position as an international crossroads by filling an existing vacuum: the absence of a flagship contemporary fair for Central & Eastern Europe. Inspired by the Tremplin (Springboard) section at the 2010 Paris Biennale, the new HEROES CORNER section will feature 20 of the most dynamic modern and contemporary art galleries in Central and Eastern Europe, plus five Western galleries specializing in East European art. Each gallery will display a single work on a special stand in the centre of the Fair. Gallery owners will be present throughout the Fair to meet visitors and talk about their artists. The twelve countries represented on HEROES CORNER are Bosnia, Bulgaria, Latvia, Poland, Romania, Russia, Slovakia, Slovenia, Ukraine and, from the West, France, Switzerland and the USA. The geographical sweep on HEROES CORNER ranges from Sarajevo (Duplex/10m²) up to Riga (Alma, Tifāna, Rīgas)… and from New York (Artfira Gallery) across to Ekaterinburg in the Urals (Art-Slovar). The works on offer on HEROES CORNER span a 75-year period, from a 1935 Portrait of a Girl by Pavel Filonov`s student Vladimir Luppian (Na Lenivke, Moscow) to a host of `hot-off-the-press` works produced in 2010, including Sandor Bartha`s In The Park (Ivan Gallery, Bucharest); Ritums Ivanovs` Madonna On Stage (Rīgas Galerija, Riga); and Kandinsky & Melamid`s Russian Sudoku (Art-Fira, New York). Some paintings are overtly Political, like Tara von Neudorf`s Don`t Let Your Dreams Fall Asleep, with its Russian flag and USSR logo (Anaid Art, Bucharest), or Yevgeniy Fiks` Portrait of US Community Party member Esther Moroze (Barbarian, Zurich). Some are more Philosophical, like Łukasz Jastrubcz`s The End (Pies, Poznan) and Valery Chtak`s Why Is This Happening? (Paperworks, Moscow). Others are Geographical, like Vladimir Migachov`s Black Sea (Russkiy Mir, Paris); or Escapist, like Konstantin Batynkov`s tiny Tarzan in a black-and-white jungle (VP-Studio, Moscow). HEROES CORNER will provide a unique, thought-provoking overview of the finest artistic talent to have blossomed since the fall of the Iron Curtain. A strong photography section features six galleries, with startling images like Katya Belkina`s naked self-portrait on horseback, inspired by Petrov-Vodkin`s Bathing the Red Horse (Fotoloft, Moscow); a harrowing depiction of Vladimir Putin by World Press Photo Award-winner Sergey Maximishin (RussianTeaRoom, Paris); and Boštjan Pucelj`s triptych Missing In Action (Fotografija, Ljubljana). Also available on HEROES CORNER will be graphic art, video (Adriana Jebeleanu`s Copy Paste at Little Yellow Studio, Bucharest, Alina Gutkina`s My Mom at GMG of Moscow), and a variety of sculpture – from Paolo Vivian`s iron Bar Code (Bulart, Varna – Bulgaria) and Małgorzata Warlikowska`s six-part ceramic/silkscreen Eat Your Brain Out (Galeria BB, Krakow), to Olaf Brzeski`s porcelain plates (Czarna, Warsaw) and Nazar Bilyk`s tall glass and fibre-glass figure Rain (Black Square, Kiev/New York). One of Eastern Europe`s newest art galleries, Prospekt of Bucharest, will be taking part – and one of the region`s oldest, Slovakia`s Gandy Gallery, founded (in Prague) 18 years ago. `Central Europe deserves a great fair!` enthuses gallery owner Nadine Gandy. To oversee the new section, and develop the Budapest Art Fair’s international profile, the Fair has appointed Simon Hewitt as International Advisor. Mr Hewitt is an Oxford University-trained art historian based in Geneva, and a respected international art critic with many years’ experience writing for Art + Auction and other leading American, British, French and Russian specialist publications. He says: ‘Budapest Art Fair is one of the oldest and most firmly established art fairs in Eastern Europe, and I admire the determination of owners Sandor & Kati Galambos to establish the Fair as the leading event of its kind in Central and Eastern Europe. These are exciting times, and I am thrilled at this opportunity to help bring international artists, gallerists and collectors to HEROES SQUARE.’ for images and further information please contact Viktória Vető +36 20 411 3504 – press@budapestartfair.hu More information online at www.budapestartfair.hu\n\n03.11.2010 Grand Opening of the Museum of Russian Art\n\nGrand Opening of the Museum of Russian Art, featuring two exhibitions: “NO EXIT” ART and THE STORY DOESN’T END THERE Open on Saturday and Sunday, November 13th & 14th, 1:00pm to 6:00pm Reception on Saturday, November 13th, from 3:00pm to 6:00pm at the Museum of Russian Art, 80 Grand St., Jersey City, NJ 07302-4522 The Museum of Russian Art (MoRA) is celebrating its grand opening in its beautifully restored space in Jersey City, just a short train ride from downtown Manhattan. On Saturday, November 13, 2010, MoRA opens with two exhibitions. “No Exit” Art includes over forty works on paper by all of the leading figures of the Nonconformist movement, including Bulatov, Kabakov, Masterkova, Nemukhin, Sitnikov, Sveshnikov, Vassiliev, Yakovlev and Zverev. Also known as “Unofficial Art” or the “Second Avant-Garde,” Nonconformism emerged in the Soviet Union from the cultural void left by Stalinist repressions and World War II. Starting in the mid-1950s, Nonconformists worked in a stunning variety of artistic modes, boldly asserting their participation in the processes of Russian and Western art, from actionism to abstract expressionism, from tachism to pop art. But they were compelled to do this in a situation best described as “internal exile.” It was a two-fold exile. First, although they had second-hand knowledge of the living artistic world outside of the USSR, they had no access to that world. And second, while they were generally permitted to draw, paint and sculpt, they were effectively prohibited from exhibiting or publishing images of their works. The result was to isolate them from the very society in which they lived. It was an artistic life in a bubble, art with no exit. Eventually, a very partial solution was provided by art collectors who smuggled Nonconformist works to the West. But the extraordinarily difficult circumstances under which that art was produced made for one of the most intriguing and best known artistic movements of the 20th century. As the name of the second exhibition indicates, however, The Story Doesn’t End There. This exhibition, too, features artworks on paper, by three of the most talented members of the generation that followed Nonconformism: Leonid Lerman, Elena Sarni and Vasily Kafanov. Many of the Nonconformists eventually found their “exit,” leaving the Soviet Union for Europe and the US. Born in the USSR, Lerman, Sarni and Kafanov left as young artists with the vast majority of their artistic careers still before them. They have lived for years in the West, mostly in New York, and they are as much a part of the local art world here in the West as they are of the continuing life of Russian art. For them, participation in the artistic progress of the outside world is not a forbidden paradise, but a creative life, one for which their background gives them a special appreciation. As a result, their art is more cosmopolitan than that of their predecessors; where Nonconformist aesthetics is always politically attuned, these artists are focused on artistic culture itself. But from the Nonconformists they have inherited a vision of art not as entertainment or decoration, but as a communicative act. Art must convey a kind of “message,” ineffable and intangible though that message may often be. The exhibition will run through the middle of January.

Embodying the Holy: Icons in Eastern Orthodox Christianity and Tibetan Buddhism sheds light on parallels between the Eastern Orthodox Christian and Tibetan Buddhist sacred traditions in function, subject matter, composition, and story telling strategies, pairing some 63 icons from important private collections and The Museum of Russian Icons, Clinton, Massachusetts, with 26 from the Rubin Museum of Art and other collections. A good number of works on view are canonic representations of Christian saints, teachers, and other archetypal figures. Specific to the Russian Orthodox Church is an image of Saint Nil of Stolbensk holding on to his crutches in order to remain upright and in prayer, and a c. 1750 painting of Saint Cyril and Saint Methodius. From October 8 to October 9, the Rubin Museum will host a two-day ICON Conference to coincide with the opening of Embodying the Holy. The conference will bring together leading experts on the power of religious symbolism, including a keynote discussion moderated by Kent dur Russell, Curator, Museum of Russian Icons, Clinton MA and workshops with University Distinguished Professor of Art History Emerita Southern Methodist University, Dallas, TX, Annemarie Weyl Carr; Director, The Walters Art Museum, Baltimore MD, Gary Vikan, Michael S. Flier, Oleksandr Potebnja Professor of Ukrainian Philology at Harvard University, and others. The exhibition will be on view from October 5, 2010 to March 7, 2011. For more information, please visit www.rmanyc.org. The Rubin Museum of Art is located at 150 West 17th Street, New York City.\n\n29.06.2010 National Navy Museum will open in Sevastopol\n\nThe National Navy Museum will open in Sevastopol on July 4th. The opening is dedicated to the Day of the Army Forces of Ukraine. The museum is located in the 19th Century Fort – Mikhailovsky Ravelin. The exposition of the museum will occupy 30 gallery halls with the total area of 2000 square meter (20,000 sq ft). On display will be periods of history of Sevastopol that include World War I, Civil War, tragic exodus of White Army from Crimea, and first years of Soviet government. Rare documents and objects have been preserved to become a part of the exposition. Among others, original drawings by Totleben, personal seal of Admiral Lazarev, original telegrams from Frunze to Wrangel commanding to surrender, documents pertaining to the second defense of Sevastopol, ammunition, navy tunics. A separate room will be dedicated to Kachinsky aviation school that was founded in Sevastopol. The project is supported by a Ukrainian philanthropist and collector, member of the British Historic Society of Crimean War - Alexey Sheremetiev. Mr. Sheremetiev stresses that “This is a truly unique historic fortification that will be preserved down to every little detail. It is our goal to keep the structure, building materials and architectural details intact”.\n\n16.06.2010 The Glory of Ukraine: Sacred Images from the 11th to the 19th Centuries\n\nTREASURES FROM THE CAVES OF UKRAINE >>> MAKE U.S. DEBUT AT THE MUSEUM OF BIBLICAL ART >>> Uniquely Ukrainian Approach to Iconography Featured in The Glory of Ukraine >>> NEW YORK, May 28, 2010—The Museum of Biblical Art presents The Glory of Ukraine: Sacred Images from the 11th to the 19th Centuries, a collection of approximately 60 icons and rare objects from Kyiv’s famed Monastery of the Caves and the Lviv National Museum, from June 18 to September 12, 2010. Seldom seen by the outside world, the collection includes one of the oldest Ukrainian icons in existence together with an 11th century cross as well as textiles, chalices and other liturgical objects. Characterized by vivid hues and shimmering gold leaf, this distinctive school of icon painting persevered for a thousand years, blending Eastern and Western influences while stretching back from the Renaissance and Baroque periods to its early Byzantine roots. Delving into the rich history that forged a united national identity, the exhibition reveals how Ukrainian icon painters maintained their exacting tradition throughout centuries of political and religious strife. The show, organized by the Foundation for International Arts & Education (FIAE), makes its United States debut at MOBIA. “Ukrainian icon painting is striking in its originality,” notes Dr. Ena Heller, Executive Director of the Museum of Biblical Art. “It was nourished by Eastern and Western artistic and religious practices, by themes drawn from the Orthodox and Catholic faiths as well as legends and folklore. We’re excited to be the first venue in the country to offer museum-goers the chance to see these magnificent works which, with one exception, have never been seen in the United States. With the rebirth of political independence, Ukraine’s cultural and religious history takes on added significance.” Greg Guroff, President of the Foundation for International Arts & Education and organizer of the exhibition, commented: “It has been a life-long goal to bring these exquisite works to the United States for audiences to enjoy firsthand. One can simply marvel at the masterpieces....Figures in Ukrainian iconography are more human and more emotional than in the stricter canonical forms of their northern neighbors, especially in facial features where they are less severe and elongated.” >>> Exhibition Background and Highlights >>> Known as the Kyiv-Pechersk Lavra, the Monastery of the Caves is an historic Orthodox Christian monastery located in Kyiv, Ukraine. Founded in 1051 by Saints Anthony and Theodosius, it is the oldest Orthodox monastery in Eastern Europe. Over the years, it attracted thousands of pilgrims from all corners of the Russian Empire. The Monastery’s vast tunneling network of subterranean caves contains living quarters and underground chapels. Only one of these objects from the Monastery of the Caves’ collection, to be displayed at MOBIA, has previously been exhibited in the United States. The dominant feature within Ukrainian icons is the use of three colors: Gold represents the radiance of heaven, bold reds signify divine life, and bright blues symbolize human life. White stands for the essence of the divine and was reserved for exclusive use in depictions of the Resurrection and Transfiguration of Christ. The Glory of Ukraine features one of the oldest existing Ukranian icons, the Mother of God Hodigitria, dated 1370 from the Lviv Region. The half-figure of Mary and the small figure of Christ are highly expressive. Mary is depicted with broad sloping shoulders, wearing a mantle with deep geometric folds, visually anchoring the icon, while the figure of Christ is rendered with freedom and confidence. The elongated bodies are out of proportion with the size of the heads, hands and feet. The faces are painted with great skill and delicacy. Other notable works on display include the Cross of the Holy Monk Mark of the Caves (Encolpion), which has not been on view in the United States since 1997 (The Glory of Byzantium, The Metropolitan Museum of Art). This rare pectoral reliquary cross dates back to the 11th-century founding of the Monastery of the Caves during the pre-Mongol period of Kyivan Rus’. Unusually large, with Greek inscriptions and intersecting bars at right angels, it is considered to be very distinctive and is believed to have belonged to one of the early monks of the Monastery, Mark, who was responsible for burials in the Caves. He died in the late 11th century and is buried in a grave in the Caves that he dug himself. Also of note is a rare icon portraying the Congregation of All the Saints of Pechersk Lavra, (late 18th-early 19th centuries, Kyiv). The icon portrays the numerous saints of The Monastery of the Caves, monks and ascetics whose stories are described in the Kyiv-Pechersk Paterik at the beginning of the 13th century. The icon was created to honor the official canonization of these 118 saints, whose remains are kept in the Caves of the Lavra. A 176-page hard-bound exhibition catalog features full-page illustrations and individual annotations for each of the 77 objects in the exhibition. The Glory of Ukraine: Sacred Images from the 11th to the 19th Centuries features two essays written by Ukrainian scholars that explore the “Ukrainian School of Iconography” along with an historical overview of “The Kyiv-Pechersk National Historical and Cultural Preserve.” Additional information online at www.mobia.org\n\n31.05.2010 ЯКЩО/ ЕСЛИ/ IF Ukrainian Art in Transition\n\nOn May 21, a major exhibition of Ukrainian contemporary art opens at the PERMM Museum of Contemporary Art in Perm, Russia. `ЯКЩО/ЕСЛИ/IF` will be the first large-scale show of Ukrainian art beyond that country`s borders, and is the brainchild of the museum and the Moscow-based curator Ekaterina Degot. The exhibition features art that reflects the distinctive contours of Ukrainian life after the Orange Revolution – an unstable but productive ferment, full of contradictions, promises from politicians, hope for a new post-Communist footing, and disenchantment with neoliberalism. Ukrainian art of that period is one facet of an outpouring of revolutionary and creative energy. The main part of the exhibition showcases around 100 works by 30 artists. They are grouped into 4 sections: `Maidan` focuses on political and public art. `Wonderland` includes critical reflections on nationalism and bureaucratic notions of ethnic identity. `Phantoms` shows visionary painting, and `Dreamers` is for reflections on the social and emotional underpinnings of contemporary Ukraine. Participating artists include Sergei Bratkov, Olexandr Gnylytsky, Arsen Savadov, and younger talents such as Zhanna Kadyrova and the R.E.P. and Soska groups. A special section of the exhibition – `Histories` – explores unofficial Soviet art from the 1980s until the beginning of the 1990s, a formative time for today`s artists. There are Ukrainian paintings from the collection of Marat Guelman, conceptual and naive art from the collection of the Odessa- and Kiev-based artist and curator Alexandr Roytburd, and an exposition of the Kharkov school of underground photography, which gave rise to Boris Mikhailov and Sergei Bratkov. The show opens with lectures and discussions with Ukrainian artists. Some elements of the project will be staged in the city itself, and there will be a catalog in Russian and English.\n\n23.04.2010 Alexander Melamid OH MY GOD\n\nRussian painter and conceptual artist Alexander Melamid is to have a solo exhibition of thirty paintings at Phillips de Pury & Company in London. Including the now renowned series of life-size portraits of hip-hop stars such as Snoop Doggy Dog, 50 Cent and Kanye West, the paintings then shift from ‘fame’ to the ‘mundane’, with a further group of works from 2008 that have so far remained unseen, including portraits of priests and rabbis, Russian oligarchs, sculptures of ancient Roman figures, animals and stones. Melamid himself is the first to point out the incongruity and irony of these more recent portraits, including within the selection a self-portrait of himself as ‘God’: the ‘artist creator of confusion, incomprehension and absurdity’. For Melamid (an artist who whilst still living in the Soviet Union saw his works being bulldozed by the state), the repercussions of the fall of communism became clear only after the collapse of the Russian Communist Empire and were mainly connected to the failure of the officially stated goal of the Soviet regime: the creation of a ‘New Man’. In the twenty years since Perestroika, Marxist philosophy, the teachings of Freud, theories of existentialism and many of the other -isms and ideologies that exerted influence in the post-war world have disintegrated, leaving a void of fragmentation and pluralisms in their place. For many people of Melamid’s generation, this void and lack of belief is accompanied by a sense of guilt, that they had perhaps been the ‘jihadists’ for the wrong cause. In a world where art is judged by how well it reaffirms the preexisting beliefs of its consumers, the role of the artist seems also to be shifting from that of being the ‘messenger’ to being the ‘creator’. Melamid’s portraits speak not only of Shelley’s Ozymandias notion of a previous glory now only existing through its decaying monuments, but also of the processes of growth, change and decay that exist in the world, such as religious and political beliefs, fame, philosophies, beauty, bling and the natural world. In his performance at Phillips de Pury & Company, Melamid will show the tangible benefits of good (actually, great!) art for arts sake - his own included - and furthermore will demonstrate art’s healing power and medicinal properties for the treatment of physical and mental maladies. Melamid begs the question: Should the judgement for the works of Lucien Freud be Are they good for your liver? Alexander Melamid (b. 1945) first became known in the USA when still working as part of the duo Komar & Melamid after their emigration from the Soviet Union in 1977. Together they were known for their creation of Sots Art, a Russian version of pop art that satirized Soviet Socialist Realism and later was used throughout the post-communist countries. During their almost 40 year collaboration, the duo were noted as revolutionaries and, at times, rebels. Their work was often compared to that of Pop artists Andy Warhol and Roy Lichtenstein. Komar and Melamid`s career began in Soviet Russia, where they met during an anatomy drawing class in a morgue. They started working together almost immediately, exhibiting first at the Blue Bird Café in Moscow in 1967. Komar and Melamid often faced government opposition and harassment. In 1974, they exhibited Paradise, a Moscow apartment covered with light fixtures and small sculptural figures in various historical styles and movements; audience members were locked inside and forced to listen to official Soviet radio. The installation was demolished on state order shortly after it opened. Just one year later, they participated in the Bulldozer Show, an outdoor exhibition that was also bulldozed by the government. These and other occurrences resulted in their expulsion from associations such as the youth section of the Moscow Artists Union and the Graphic Artists` Association. In February of 1976, Komar & Melamid`s first U.S. exhibition opened at Ronald Feldman Fine Arts in New York. Biography of Our Contemporary garnered rave reviews and launched the artists into the international spotlight. Following this success, they applied for exit visas to enter the U.S but were twice denied by the Soviet government. In response they declared they had created their own \"state,\" entitled TransState, with a constitution, alphabet, language, passport, currency, and border post. Eventually, they were allowed to emigrate to Israel and moved to New York shortly thereafter. That same year, 1978, their first museum exhibition, Komar & Melamid: Matrix 43, opened at the Wadsworth Atheneum Museum of Art in Hartford, Connecticut. In 1982, they mounted another show at the Feldman gallery Sots Art which resulted in critical success, and within the year The Museum of Modern Art, New York, and The Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York, had acquired their work. Acquisitions by the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum, New York, and The Victoria and Albert Museum, London soon followed and the pair subsequently had more than sixty solo exhibitions worldwide. Among their most famous works together was People’s Choice, a piece of consumer research in the late 1990s where they hired a consumer research company to conduct a poll of seventeen countries to investigate their tastes in art. In 2003, very soon after Komar & Melamid began to work separately, Melamid’s son Dan, introduced him to the world of hip-hop, which included his clients and close friends Whoo Kid and 50 Cent. Melamid was intrigued by hip-hop society because of its rich history and world appeal, and began to paint the portraits in this exhibition. In 2008 Melamid stayed in Rome for eight months and his exposure to the portrait busts and sculptures of Ancient Rome of people so long gone but still ubiquitous became a defining inspiration for the latest portraits. Whilst acknowledging the strength of the beauty of the works, he was also fascinated by the fact that one so rarely knows, or indeed cares, whom they depict.

Over the course of his thirty-five-year career, Brinton wrote more than two hundred articles and organized numerous exhibitions that introduced American audiences to prominent Russian artists, such as David Burliuk, Boris Grigoriev, John Graham (born in Ukraine, Ivan Dabrowsky), and Viktor Palmov. By 1932, when Brinton curated a large exhibition of modern Russian art in Wilmington, Delaware, many progressive artists from the Soviet Union had been forced into exile in the United States for their opposition to Joseph Stalin’s ruthless totalitarian regime. In the exhibition catalogue Brinton claimed that the work of these émigré Russian artists “seldom disassociates itself from nature and from life,” which they sought to “intensify” and “magnify” through their dreamlike paintings. Brinton was attracted to brightly colored, folkloric compositions, which explain why he also championed the work of the Hungarian painter Bela Kadar, the German Expressionist Heinrich Campendonk, and the African American artist Horace Pippin, who painted Brinton’s portrait in 1940.\n\n03.01.2010 Museum of Modern Art of Ukraine\n\nThe first private museum dedicated to modern and contemporary Ukrainian art has opened in Podol district of Kyiv. The Museum of Modern Art of Ukraine was founded by a businessman, the president of Jewelers Association of Ukraine, Serhiy Tsupko in June of 2005. Yet, only now the museum has re-opened in its new building. The new address of the museum is Hlybochytska Street 17. The museum occupies a newly renovated space of 3,500 sq m (approximately 35,000 sq ft). Works by 500 Ukrainian artists are represented in the museum’s collection. The collection reflects upon the artists, art schools and art periods that were active in Ukraine during 20th through early 21st Centuries. In its collection the museum has over 4,500 works of art comprising one of the largest Ukrainian art collection of paintings, works on paper, sculpture and decorative art. It represents the largest private Museum collection in Ukraine that was assembled over the period of 20 years. The museum is actively acquiring new works at the market, from artists and through field research in all regions of Ukraine. The museum is a private, non-commercial entity. Its goal is to research, collect and preserve works by Ukrainian artists in Ukraine and in all other countries where Ukrainian artists lived and worked. On view at the museum’s permanent collection are works by such artists as: V. Khmelko, I. Kavaleridze, I. Pleshynsky, I. Trusz, O. Novakivsky, A. Erdeli, Tatyana and Olena Yablonsky, V. Bernadsky, K.

At the opening reception of the museum there was a “street art” performance done by a young artist from Odessa, Oleksandr Milov – study for the monument of Stepan Bandera made out of scotch tape, wire and water pipes. The museum occupies a three story building. On view on the first floor are works from the project “Art map of Ukraine” by artists from Odessa. Second and third floor galleries are dedicated to the museum’s permanent collection.

The exhibition will be held from November 12 to December 30 at Art Next Gallery, located at 530 West 25th Street, 3rd Floor. Opening reception will be on Thursday, November 12th, from 6-8pm. From Perestroika to Global Financial Crisis, From Berlin Wall to “Great Wall” of China, From Sots Art to Pop Art, and from Socialist Realism to Political Pop Art – the show for the first time brings together works by most distinguished contemporary artists whose artistic careers skyrocketed as a result of the geopolitical changes that occurred over the last 20 years. The show not only focuses on the tangible and visible Berlin Wall that has become a relic of history, but takes a broader viewpoint on historical events of the last few decades. Today one can witness the presence of an invisible wall – as a symbol of brutality, rape, authoritarian regime and human ignorance. It is a wall that deprives our freedom of choice. It had not been easy to dismantle the visible wall but to let the invisible wall go down may be even harder. Events of the last twenty years, after the fall of the Berlin Wall, have changed the way we live and think. The destruction in 2001 of the World Trade Center in New York City and the beginning of the War on Terror, followed by the World Financial Crisis of 2008 are only some of the events that have created boundaries to our freedom and lifestyle. Art, as the most deliberate and complex means of communication, can help nations overcome long histories of reciprocal distrust, insularity and conflict. Featured works in the exhibition visually explore an array of multifaceted political and social events, the leap from communism to capitalism (and back), the political and cultural boundaries that separate unified nations, and the roles of influential political leaders of both the West and the East. The show will feature works by such well-known artists as Alexander Melamid, Ai Weiwei, and for the first time works by world renowned fashion designer Marc Ecko. Overall, seventeen artists from six different countries will be represented in the exhibition, including Alexander Melamid, Anton S. Kandinsky and Marc Ecko (New York), Ilya Chichkan, Alexander Roitburd and Yuri Solomko (Ukraine), Yuriy Balashov and Alexey Salmanov (Russia), Ai Weiwei, Lao Liu, Zheng Lianjie, Zhang Hongtu, Zhang Dali, Ji Shengli and Chen Weiming (China), Lorenz Haarmann (Germany) and Robert Bery (Israel). The show was organized by Art Next Gallery in collaboration with artfira.com. Art Next Gallery is dedicated to creating an East-West discourse by spotlighting the greatest artistic talents ascending across Asia and emerging here in New York. By featuring both emerging and established artists from Beijing, Shanghai, Seoul, Tokyo, and New York, Art Next offers the Chelsea gallery community a unique confluence of cross-cultural vitality, shifting perspectives, and the newest voices of artistic identity. Art Next Gallery, located in the heart of Chelsea, functions as a gallery and event venue for artists, auctions, and various private events.

Dance | Trash | Glamour consists of select works from All God’s Children Can Dance, a project that explores what remains when the material world collapses around us and all that is left is a meaningless pile of debris. All God’s Children Can Dance features two accomplished dancers, the Ukrainian Dancing with the Stars it‐girl Alyona Shoptenko and break dancing star Maxim “Cat”. The subjects are freed from the gloss, glamour and fashion of the magazine cover and are instead surrounded by a destroyed material world. The debris exposes the fragility and impermanence of glamour, and we wonder what, if anything, remains when all of our comforts and possessions are taken away. As the finite nature of the material world becomes evident, personal relationships intensify, and loneliness, intimacy, domination, submission, fear and liberation reveal themselves. The pair’s style and grace conflict with – and persist in spite of – the ruins surrounding them. Human spirit and determination triumph. We soon discover that the subjects are not trapped in the emptiness and decay surrounding them, but rather that they have been freed from the trap of material desires. Although Dance | Trash | Glamour is Alexey Salmanov’s first show in the United States, his work has been exhibited and well received in Russia and Ukraine. In fact, he has recently made the shortlist for the 2009 PinchukArtCentre Prize for contemporary art by young artists. The winner will be announced in October. Alexey was born in Rostov‐on‐Don, Russia in 1976. He currently lives and works in Kiev, Ukraine. The exhibition will continue through October 10, 2009.

Kandinsky, Sophie Matisse, Laurance Rassin and David Noah Burliuk\n\nNEW YORK, June 23, 2009- Art Next Gallery is pleased to announce the first exhibition of The New Blue Riders, a newly formed group, taken from the historic Der Blaue Reiter (The Blue Rider). The exhibition will be held from June 23 to July 18th at Art Next Gallery, located at 530 West 25th Street, 3rd Floor. The New Blue Riders exhibit is a multifaceted and multidisciplinary event, showcasing the works of Anton S. Kandinsky, Sophie Matisse, and David Noah Burliuk and Laurance Rassin, founding members of the group. Displaying inherited styles of artistic expression by Wassily Kandinsky, Henri Matisse, David Burliuk, these four leading New York-based artists merge their talents to create the group, The New Blue Riders. Illustrated in the members’ art work you will see references of impressionism, expressionism, contemporary-expressionism, neo-fauvism and gemism. “Collectively, we anticipate our work to inspire and challenge traditional forms,” said Laurance Rassin, artistic director of the group. “Our purpose is to exhibit new forms of expressionism in a group setting and plan on growing the group, welcoming other artists that have the same goals.” The artists will showcase works including traditional oil paintings, bronze sculpture, photography, ceramics, tapestries, furniture and music.
