        "text": "After investigating a death in Paisley Park, Minnesota, the Associated Press finally confirmed that pop superstar Prince has died. A law-enforcement official has told The Associated Press that tests show Prince died of an opioid overdose.\n\nAs with other popular musicians such as Beyoncé and Jay-Z, Prince has a concentration of Louisiana roots. In fact, all four of his grandparents were born there, according to the Huffington Post.\n\nHis once mostly Louisiana-based family eventually moved to Arkansas, Iowa, Illinois, Minnesota, New Jersey and Tennessee. His maternal grandfather, a Pullman porter named Frank Shaw, went north to Minnesota.\n\nRELATED: Local recalls Prince's party in Lafayette\n\nMORE:Remembering Prince, a prodigy and provocateur\n\nWithin Louisiana, Prince has family connections in Claiborne, Webster, Bienville and Lincoln Parishes. More specifically, his roots are in the towns of Homer, Cotton Valley, Arcadia and Vienna.\n\nSix of Prince’s eight great-grandparents were born into slavery, and one of his great-grandmothers was apparently the daughter of her one-time owner."
