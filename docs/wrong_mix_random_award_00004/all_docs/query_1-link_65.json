The series would be held outdoors, so concert-goers could enjoy the natural beauty of our County. Children could enjoy the music or play in the open areas near the concert area.\n\nA total of five concerts were offered that first year. From the summer of 1977 to the present, people would either bring lawn chairs or blankets to listen to the Thursday night summer concert series. Patrons also brought picnic baskets of snacks or full dinners. The \"Music Under the Stars\" concert series has continued to grow in popularity, attendance, and in the quality of musical acts each year. Additional concerts were added to provide music from the end of June to mid-August.\n\nInitially, the performers lived nearby and were locally known. With assistance from local businesses and with individual donations, regional and nationally known artists were featured at the concert series. Performers included Arlo Guthrie, Roseanne Cash, Janis Ian, and Richie Havens.\n\nIf interested in becoming a featured artist, please contact the Division at 908-782-1158 or email us for information.\n\nWe hope to see you at our Music Under the Stars Concert Series!\n\nHave Fun, Be Safe, and Be Considerate of Others\n\nOur concert series has always been family-oriented. Please be considerate so everyone may enjoy the music and the natural surroundings. If you smoke, make sure the smoke does not bother anyone else. Keep children in sight at all times, so that their safety is assured, and their play will not disturb others. Some guests may be afraid of dogs, so observe our park leash law and control your pet. Please pick up all litter.\n\nAlcoholic Beverages are not permitted.\n\nMade possible with funds from the Hunterdon County Cultural & Heritage Commission, a partner of the New Jersey State Council on the Arts.\n\n2024 Performances 7 PM - 9 PM\n\nJuly 25, 2024 - Jake’s Rockin’ Country Band\n\nJake’s Rockin' Country Band is sure to please country fans of all ages!

With the onslaught of cover bands playing alternative-grunge song lists, the Nerds stuck to their guns playing a little bit of everything that they like, R&B, blues, funk, dance, classic rock, hair band, punk, new wave, pop and Englebert Humperdinck. In the fall of 2000, they were asked to host MTV’s Ultimate Cover Band Contest as the house band. They have shared a stage with Sheryl Crow, Hootie and the Blowfish, Earth Wind and Fire, Train, The Go-Gos, Maroon 5, Southside Johnny, and more. Over the years, Spaz, Biff, Stretch, and Mongo have graced stages from the Jersey Shore to Las Vegas, earning their reputation as “America’s Party Band Fun-omenon” every step of the way.\n\nhttps://www.tedfass.com/artist/the-nerds/\n\nPossible Closures Due to Available Space in Deer Path Park\n\nOur stage is situated in front of a large, open field to accommodate lawn chairs and blankets for our audience. Additional fields will be made available for use as parking lots for each performance. There are evenings when we may need to close Deer Path Park, simply because we might fill lawn seating and/or parking spaces.\n\nConsider carpooling! There are four very good reasons:\n\nYou'll get to visit with your friends;\n\nFewer cars help reduce your time needed for parking before and after the concert, due to traffic;\n\nMore people can enjoy the concert and\n\nIf we all pitch in we can save some fossil fuels and lessen the amount of pollutants entering our air!"
