        "text": "Disclaimer: IRS Collection Financial Standards are intended for use in calculating repayment of delinquent taxes. These Standards are effective on April 22, 2024 for purposes of federal tax administration only. Expense information for use in bankruptcy calculations can be found on the website for the U.S. Trustee Program.\n\nDownload the transportation standards PDF in PDF format for printing. Please note that the standard amounts change, so if you elect to print them, check back periodically to assure you have the latest version.\n\nThe transportation standards for taxpayers with a vehicle consist of two parts: nationwide figures for monthly loan or lease payments referred to as ownership costs, and additional amounts for monthly operating costs. The operating costs include maintenance, repairs, insurance, fuel, registrations, licenses, inspections, parking and tolls (These standard amounts do not include personal property taxes).\n\nOwnership Costs\n\nThe ownership costs, shown in the table below, provide the monthly allowances for the lease or purchase of up to two automobiles. A single taxpayer is normally allowed one automobile. For each automobile, taxpayers will be allowed the lesser of:\n\nthe monthly payment on the lease or car loan, or\n\nthe ownership costs shown in the table below.\n\nIf a taxpayer has no lease or car loan payment, the amount allowed for Ownership Costs will be $0.\n\nOperating Costs\n\nIn addition to Ownership Costs, a taxpayer is allowed Operating Costs, by regional and metropolitan area, as shown in the table below. For each automobile, taxpayers will be allowed the lesser of:\n\nthe amount actually spent monthly for operating costs, or\n\nthe operating costs shown in the table below.\n\nPublic Transportation\n\nThere is a single nationwide allowance for public transportation based on Bureau of Labor Statistics expenditure data for mass transit fares for a train, bus, taxi, ferry, etc. Taxpayers with no vehicle are allowed the standard amount monthly, per household, without questioning the amount actually spent.\n\nIf a taxpayer owns a vehicle and uses public transportation, expenses may be allowed for both, provided they are needed for the health and welfare of the taxpayer or family, or for the production of income. However, the expenses allowed would be actual expenses incurred for ownership costs, operating costs and public transportation, or the standard amounts, whichever is less.\n\nIf the amount claimed for Ownership Costs, Operating Costs or Public Transportation is more than the total allowed by the transportation standards, the taxpayer must provide documentation to substantiate those expenses are necessary living expenses.\n\nPublic Transportation Location Allowed Amount National $215\n\nOwnership Costs Location One Car Two Cars National $619 $1,238\n\nNortheast Region Operating Costs Location One Car Two Cars Northeast Region $285 $570 Boston $310 $620 New York $377 $754 Philadelphia $307 $614\n\nMidwest Region Operating Costs Location One Car Two Cars Midwest Region $239 $478 Chicago $266 $532 Cleveland $239 $478 Detroit $299 $598 Minneapolis-St. Paul $243 $486 St. Louis $220 $440\n\nSouth Region Operating Costs Location One Car Two Cars South Region $260 $520 Atlanta $304 $608 Baltimore $272 $544 Dallas-Ft.

The following table lists the states that comprise each Census Region. Once the taxpayer’s Census Region has been ascertained, to determine if an MSA standard is applicable, use the definitions below to see if the taxpayer lives within an MSA (MSAs are defined by county and city, where applicable). If the taxpayer does not reside in an MSA, use the regional standard.\n\nMSA Definitions by Census Region\n\nNortheast Census Region: Maine, New Hampshire, Vermont, Massachusetts, Rhode Island, Connecticut, Pennsylvania, New York, New Jersey\n\nMSA Counties Boston\n\nMA: Essex, Middlesex, Norfolk, Plymouth, Suffolk\n\nNH: Rockingham, Strafford\n\nNew York\n\nNY: Bronx, Dutchess, Kings, Nassau, New York, Orange, Putnam, Queens, Richmond, Rockland, Suffolk, Westchester\n\nNJ: Bergen, Essex, Hudson, Hunterdon, Middlesex, Monmouth, Morris, Ocean, Passaic, Somerset, Sussex, Union\n\nPA: Pike\n\nPhiladelphia\n\nPA: Bucks, Chester, Delaware, Montgomery, Philadelphia\n\nNJ: Burlington, Camden, Gloucester, Salem\n\nDE: New Castle\n\nMD: Cecil\n\nMidwest Census Region: North Dakota, South Dakota, Nebraska, Kansas, Missouri, Illinois, Indiana, Ohio, Michigan, Wisconsin, Minnesota, Iowa\n\nMSA Counties (unless otherwise specified) Chicago\n\nIL: Cook, DeKalb, DuPage, Grundy, Kane, Kendall, Lake, McHenry, Will\n\nIN: Jasper, Lake, Newton, Porter\n\nWI: Kenosha\n\nCleveland\n\nOH: Ashtabula, Cuyahoga, Geauga, Lake, Lorain, Medina, Portage, Summit\n\nDetroit\n\nMI: Lapeer, Livingston, Macomb, Oakland, St. Clair, Wayne\n\nMinneapolis-St. Paul\n\nMN: Anoka, Carver, Chisago, Dakota, Hennepin, Isanti, Le Sueur, Mille Lacs, Ramsey, Scott, Sherburne, Sibley, Washington, Wright\n\nWI: Pierce, St. Croix\n\nSt. Louis\n\nMO: Franklin, Jefferson, Lincoln, St. Charles, St. Louis county, Warren, St. Louis city\n\nIL: Bond, Calhoun, Clinton, Jersey, Macoupin, Madison, Monroe, St. Clair\n\nSouth Census Region: Texas, Oklahoma, Arkansas, Louisiana, Mississippi, Tennessee, Kentucky, West Virginia, Virginia, Maryland, District of Columbia, Delaware, North Carolina, South Carolina, Georgia, Florida, Alabama\n\nMSA Counties (unless otherwise specified) Atlanta\n\nGA: Barrow, Bartow, Butts, Carroll, Cherokee, Clayton, Cobb, Coweta, Dawson, DeKalb, Douglas, Fayette, Forsyth, Fulton, Gwinnett, Haralson, Heard, Henry, Jasper, Lamar, Meriwether, Morgan, Newton, Paulding, Pickens, Pike, Rockdale, Spalding, Walton\n\nBaltimore\n\nMD: Anne Arundel, Baltimore county, Carroll, Harford, Howard, Queen Anne’s, Baltimore city\n\nDallas-Ft.
