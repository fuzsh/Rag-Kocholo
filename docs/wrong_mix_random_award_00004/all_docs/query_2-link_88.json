        "text": "Tensions had grown between Mexico and the United States in the 1910s and 1920s due to war and business conflicts. Charles Lindbergh had made a goodwill flight from New York City to Mexico City in late 1927 and during a stop on the way had met the young Mexican aviator who idolized him. Captain Emilio Carranza RodrÃ­guez, who was in his early twenties, wished to return the successful diplomatic gesture, which he did with wide public support. He began his American visit by landing in Washington, D.C. on June 12 where he was congratulated by President Calvin Coolidge. He then flew to New York City and was honored by the cityâs mayor. Carranza departed New York on July 12. Shortly after taking off, he encountered thunderstorms while flying over the New Jersey Pinelands.â¯His plane, named the Excelsior, came apart and he crashed into the woods.â¯His body was recovered the next day.\n\nThe monument, installed with funds donated by Mexican schoolchildren, depicts a falling eagle of Aztec design. Every July on the Saturday nearest the anniversary of his crash (second Saturday in July) at 1:00 p.m., he is honored at the monument site by members of the American Legion Mount Holly Post 11 and an entourage from the Mexican consulates in New York City and Philadelphia.\n\nFacilities for People with Disabilities\n\nWe encourage people with disabilities who require special considerations to contact the historic site / park at the phone number listed in the general information on the home page of the historic site / park.
