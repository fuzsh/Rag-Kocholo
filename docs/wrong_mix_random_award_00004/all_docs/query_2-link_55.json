        "text": "How does it feel to be one of the beautiful people?\n\nThat's what the Beatles asked, in 1967. And that's what we asked Paolo Montalban — Prince Charming in the groundbreaking 1997 TV production of \"Cinderella,\" newly back on the radar after Disney Plus made it available on Feb. 12.\n\nOn the basis of this performance, People magazine declared Montalban, from Jersey City, one of the 50 Most Beautiful People of 1998.\n\n\"When I got the phone call, I didn't know what the editors were asking me,\" he said. \"I thought I had won something.\"\n\nHe appeared, on an issue with Leonardo DiCaprio on the cover (this was just after \"Titanic\"), on a double-page spread flanked by Anna Kournikova and Tom Selleck.\n\n\"It was a huge deal for me,\" he said. \"They shot me on a white horse. I guess I was the knight in shining armor who comes in on a white horse. It will always be a feather in my cap, that I can look back and have a laugh at. It didn't do miracles for my love life. I think I would have remembered that.\"\n\nIt was a huge deal to many people. Montalban is a Filipino American. And in 1998, he was taking his place in People magazine, alongside such white-bread heartthrobs as Selleck and DiCaprio.\n\nDid you know?: One of the world's most-streamed shows, 'WandaVision' is set in North Jersey\n\nPaolo Montalban: Benny & Joon at Paper Mill deepens story of love, family\n\n'American Idol': Samantha Sharpe, TikTok-famous NJ singer, gets golden ticket to Hollywood\n\nAs much of a breakthrough, in its way, as his multicultural \"Cinderella,\" starring Brandy as the lady in the slippers and Whitney Houston as her fairy godmother — a game-changer in the way people of color are viewed in traditional roles.\n\n\"If you get the opportunity to watch our 'Cinderella' with a young person, 8 or 9, watch their reaction,\" he said. \"If they can be accepting of the message of diversity and representation and inclusion, why can't we?\"\n\nAlthough the show has been available on DVD for awhile, it's getting renewed attention this month because of Disney Plus. And Montalban, who has only recently become active on social media, is being reminded again of the huge impact it had on kids at the time — now that their kids are starting to watch it.\n\n\"I've done more press for this re-release than I did originally,\" Montalban said. \"Which is very rare. Over the years, there have been articles by people, reminding the public of about how groundbreaking this was — how much it meant.\n\n\"In the first few years, I would be recognized in the street or in the mall, but even in the last 10 years I've been stopped by people who ask me, 'Were you the prince in Brandy's \"Cinderella\"?' Me being in it, being an Asian Filipino prince in this multicultural production, was so inspiring. It allowed them to see themselves in a different light.\"\n\nNot for nothing, \"Cinderella\" is an Asian story: it comes to us by way of 860 A.D. China. It's the white versions that feature experimental casting.\n\nOf all the things Montalban has done in his varied career, this probably had the most impact. And he's done a lot of things.\n\nHe was Kung Lao in the syndicated series \"Mortal Kombat: Conquest,\" appeared in \"Law & Order: Special Victims Unit,\" and has been seen in such films as \"The Great Raid,\" \"American Adabo,\" \"Just Wright,\" and \"The Adjustment Bureau.\"\n\nOn and off-Broadway, he was in \"The King and I,\" \"Pacific Overtures,\" \"Breakfast at Tiffany's,\" and in the Shakespeare in the Park production of \"Two Gentlemen of Verona.\" Locally, you might have seen him in several Paper Mill Playhouse shows, including \"Benny & Joon,\" \"Nine\" and — inevitably — \"The King and I\" (he's been in numerous productions, playing both the young lover Lun Tha and The King).\n\nBut the sheer numbers of people who saw \"Cinderella,\" and — perhaps — first viewed a person of color as the man of their dreams, is very heartening to Montalban. \"First time I saw an Asian-American man and had a crush on him,\" he'd hear.\n\n\"I know for a fact that the producers were not focusing on Asians,\" said Montalban (no relation, by the way, to \"Wrath of Khan's\" Ricardo Montalban). \"They just wanted a person of color to play the prince.\" Wayne Brady, Antonio Sabato, Jr., Marc Anthony and Taye Diggs are among the others who were considered for the role. And indeed, Montalban might have missed it by that much.\n\n\"I was late for my audition,\" he said. \"I was the last to go in. It was around 5 o'clock, 5:15. Afterwards, they told me they had seen 800 actors on both coasts. I'm glad they didn't tell me that when I went in.\"\n\nTaste of Brandy\n\nThis \"Cinderella\" was the brainchild of the late Whitney Houston, who was originally slated to play the title role (she eventually decided she was too mature and gave it to her protégé, Brandy Norwood). Others in the all-star cast included Whoopi Goldberg, Jason Alexander, Bernadette Peters, and Victor Garber.\n\nAt $12 million, it was one of the most expensive and heavily-promoted TV movies ever made. Its success proved that mass audiences were ready for multi-racial reboots of traditional material. This \"Cinderella\" likely prompted Disney, which produced it, to further diversify its stock of princess characters: Mulan, Tiana and Moana were among their later bluebloods of color.\n\n\"The vision of the executive producers Craig Zadan, Neil Meron, Debra Martin Chase and Whitney Houston was that they wanted children of all ethnicities and backgrounds and cultures to be included in the telling of the story,\" Montalban said.\n\nMost especially, it gave non-WASP kids a Cinderella to root for, and aspire to.\n\n\"Brandy was 18 when she shot this,\" he said. \" She has that built-in spunk to her essence, to her personality and belief in herself, that still shines through 24 years later.\"\n\nAll of which made her a rather different Cinderella than Julie Andrews, who had originated the role in 1957, or Leslie Ann Warren, who played it in 1965. \"Cinderella\" was the only Rodgers and Hammerstein musical to be written directly for television. For this 1997 reinvention, additional R&H songs were added to flesh out the score, along with one — \"Falling in Love with Love\" — Rodgers wrote with his earlier collaborator, Lorenz Hart. The orchestrations were updated. So was the script.\n\nFor the feminist Nineties, Cinderella could not be just another pretty face. She had to be independent, spunky. Active rather than passive. And that meant Prince Charming — \"Prince Christopher\" in this version — had to be fleshed out as well.\n\n\"What's really beautiful about the story, for both of these characters, is that they're almost on these parallel tracks,\" he said. \"They're breaking out of the shackles of what's expected of them.\"\n\nThat might also be said of Montalban — who went to college (Rutgers New Brunswick) fulling expecting to become a pediatric cardiologist.\n\nHe was just a year and a half old when he was brought from Manila to Manhattan by his parents, Vivian and Paul Montalban (he credits them, along with his sister Gloria and nieces Isabella and Gabriella, for getting him this far).\n\nHis parents were both research chemists. So it was no surprise that, when he graduated from St. Peter's Prep in Jersey City and attended Rutgers, he set his professional sights on something brainy and distinguished.\n\nBut a senior year appearance at The Cabaret, at the University's Douglass campus, abruptly changed that trajectory. He was in a musical revue called \"Closer than Ever.\" An agent saw him, signed him. And a few months later — September, 1993 — he was in the national tour of \"Man of La Mancha.\"\n\n\"It was like, 'Look mom, I got a job,' \" he said.\n\nEven in the COVID era, he's got irons in the fire: including a second movie musical, \"The Girl Who Left Home,\" which will be debuting at the Seattle Asian American Film Festival starting March 4 (you can stream the movie online).\n\nBut he's not displeased that his old \"Cinderella\" has resurfaced, to give a new generation of kids something to aspire to.\n\n\"When the movie first came out in 1997, we barely had the internet,\" he said. \"There wasn't much of a feedback loop from the public. Now I'm able to connect with fans in a way that I've never connected before. The people who have been reaching out are mostly men and women who saw it when they were younger. And what I'm hearing is, how much of an effect this movie had on them, when they were growing up. I find that incredibly touching.\"\n\nJim Beckerman is an entertainment and culture reporter for NorthJersey.com.
