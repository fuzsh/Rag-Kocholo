        "text": "Prince, the iconic, genre-traversing pop and rock icon, has died, TMZ.com reports. He was 57.\n\nThe website reports the singer's body was discovered at his Paisley Park compound in Minnesota early Thursday morning.\n\nA publicist for the singer born Prince Rogers Nelson confirmed his death.\n\nThe singer had reportedly been battling the flu for two weeks, and his private jet was forced to make an emergency landing due a medical condition last week, TMZ also reported.\n\nBut a day later, he appeared at a Paisley Park concert to show fans he was okay. \"Wait a few days before you waste any prayers,\" he reportedly told the crowd.\n\nThrough more than 35 years of epic, flamboyant performances, genre-bending released and an ever present, lavender-tinged bravado, Prince was a dominant figure in both pop and rock spheres. His mix of influences, which also heavily injected aspects of funk, R&B, jazz and soul, earned him endless praise from critics, and more than 100 million records sold, across 39 studio releases.\n\nHis most recent was December's HITnRUN Phase Two, which led Los Angeles Times to proclaim \"Prince is back -- again.\"\n\nUpon his 2004 induction, Rock and Roll Hall of Fame gushed: \"He rewrote the rulebook, forging a synthesis of black funk and white rock that served as a blueprint for cutting-edge music in the Eighties.\"\n\nHe enjoyed five No. 1 singles across his career, with 1984's smash \"When Doves Cry\" claiming five weeks in the top spot.\n\nHe shredded and sang at Super Bowl XLI in 2007, in a rainstorm that wasn't quite as purple as he might have liked.\n\nPrince was married and divorced twice, to Mayte Garcia (divorced in 1999) and Manuela Testolini (divorced in 2006). His only child, died within a week of birth in 1996."
