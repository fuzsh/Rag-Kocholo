Let's make sure you have everything you need to get on the road.\n\nStep 1: Get a Virginia Driver's License\n\nWhen you move to Virginia, you have 60 days to get a Virginia driver's license to legally drive here. If you currently have a commercial driver's license (CDL), you must get a Virginia CDL within 30 days.\n\nMake It a REAL ID\n\nWhen you apply for your license, consider making it a REAL ID. Beginning May 7, 2025, the federal government will require you to show a REAL ID compliant driver's license or identification card, or another federally approved form of ID, in order to board a domestic flight or enter most secure federal facilities.\n\nSince you'll have all the necessary documents when you apply for your Virginia license, it's the perfect time to upgrade to a REAL ID.\n\nTo get your driver's license, review the items below. When you're ready, you can start your application online before you visit DMV.\n\nEligibility Requirements\n\nApply for a Virginia License\n\nVirginia Driver's Manual\n\nDocument Guide for Licenses and ID Cards\n\nStep 2: Get a Vehicle Safety Inspection Sticker\n\nBefore operating a vehicle in Virginia, it must pass an annual safety inspection and display a valid safety inspection sticker. This helps catch any issues before they can cause harm.\n\nSafety inspections are performed at most repair shops in the state. Contact your preferred location to see if it's offered.\n\nFor more information about safety inspections, or to find safety inspection stations near you, contact Virginia State Police or 804-674-6774.\n\nNote: If you drive your vehicle without an inspection sticker, you may be ticketed. A conviction for violating Virginia inspection laws could result in a fine and be posted to your driving record.\n\nStep 3: Title Your Vehicle in Virginia\n\nBefore you can register your vehicle and get license plates, you must first title your vehicle within 30 days of moving to Virginia. See Title Your Vehicle in Virginia.\n\nStep 4: Pass an Emissions Inspection\n\nIf you're registering your vehicle in Virginia for the first time and it has a current valid emissions certificate from the last 12 months, you can register it WITHOUT a Virginia emissions inspection.\n\nOtherwise, your vehicle must pass an emissions inspection before it can be registered if it is kept in one of the following localities:\n\nThe counties of Arlington, Fairfax, Loudoun, Prince William or Stafford\n\nThe cities of Alexandria, Fairfax, Falls Church, Manassas or Manassas Park\n\nFind an emissions station.\n\nFor more information on emissions inspections, visit the Department of Environmental Quality website, or call them at 703-583-3900 or toll free in Virginia at 1-800-275-3844.\n\nStep 5: Meet Virginia's Vehicle Insurance Requirements\n\nFrom the moment you register your vehicle to the day the registration period expires, you must maintain the minimum amount of liability insurance coverage — even if the vehicle is not working or not being operated.\n\nIf you register your vehicle in Virginia but do not insure it, you face:"
