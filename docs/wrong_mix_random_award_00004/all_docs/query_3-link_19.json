        "text": "This Friday, it will be one year since Prince died, after taking an accidental overdose of painkillers.\n\nHis death robbed the world of a true original: A pocket-sized virtuoso who broke musical rules and defied genres, apparently without breaking a sweat.\n\nPresident Obama called his death a \"remarkable loss\", and revealed he listened to Purple Rain to \"just to get warmed up\" in the morning.\n\nThe star was famously private, rarely giving interviews, and even serving non-disclosure agreements on former bandmates and collaborators.\n\nSince his death, however, fans have been afforded the occasional glimpse into his life - some funny, some enlightening, all of them elevating his status as a visionary, and a musical genius.\n\nHere are 12 things we've learned in the last 12 months.\n\nWith songs like Erotic City and Sexy Dancer, Prince became known as a rampant sex machine - but he was also a devoutly religious vegan, who became a Jehovah's Witness in 2003.\n\nAfter that, he excised swear words from his music (Sexy MF was never played live again) and kept a \"cuss bucket\" in his recording studio.\n\n\"He didn't want to dishonour the faith,\" said his friend James Lundstrom. \"He wasn't joking. You had to pay in cash in the bucket. He would charge you between three and 10 dollars per swear word.\n\n\"Once I bumped my knee and I said, 'damn'. He said, 'What did you say?'\"\n\nOn one occasion, Lundstrom recalled, a foul-mouthed musician stuffed a handful of hundred dollar bills in the swear jar as a down-payment for the rest of the day.\n\nPrince's former art director Steve Parke recently published a book featuring the intimate, behind-the-scenes photographs he took of the star during his time at Paisley Park.\n\nHe also recounts the time Prince invited him to watch a montage of old performances he was preparing for the American Music Awards. When a scene from Purple Rain appeared, the star bellowed, \"Look at that wig!\" and burst out laughing.\n\nParke later asked Prince's hair stylist Earl Jones about the comment. He explained the star had had to reshoot a few scenes after the filming wrapped - but he had already cut his hair and bleached it blond - necessitating the bouffant hairpiece.\n\nJones added that Prince had reacted so badly to the bleach that his hair started breaking off, so he had to let it grow out, and dye it back to black.\n\n\"The hairstyle in Raspberry Beret was literally all I could do with it.\"\n\nIt's no secret that Prince was a perfectionist - but some of the stories that emerged after his death highlighted the star's ruthless attitude towards his bandmates.\n\n\"He did like to push the band with fear,\" said Michael B Nelson, who played trombone for the New Power Generation.\n\nOne night, months into 1993's Act I tour, Nelson missed a high B during his solo on a song called The Flow.\n\n\"The next day, [Prince] came by and said, 'You're gonna play that solo right tonight?'\" he told Rolling Stone, external. \"I said, 'I'll do my best.' And he says, 'Uh, you did your best last night.' And he walks away.\"\n\nThat night, when it came to the solo, Prince walked up to him with his \"golden gun\" microphone (pictured above) and held it to his head.\n\n\"I was like, 'Oh, my God.' And he kept doing it. And it was like a week of him doing this, and I'm freaking out. It wasn't showbiz at that point. It was, 'Don't you ever do that again'.\"\n\nPrince had many aliases as a songwriter - Alexander Nevermind, Joey Coco and Jamie Starr, to name but a few.\n\nBut unsealed court documents show, released earlier this week, show that the star, an intensely private person, travelled under the name Peter Bravestrong to help conceal his identity.\n\nThat name was on a luggage tag he used while travelling to Atlanta for what proved to be his final concert.\n\nThe suitcase was found at Paisley Park after his death, and contained several prescription bottles in the name of Kirk Johnson, a personal friend and employee since the 1980s. (It also contained handwritten lyrics for U Got the Look, according to investigators.)\n\nUS authorities are still investigating how Prince obtained the prescription medications which killed him.\n\nAs bandmates and friends lined up to pay tribute to Prince, they all seemed to have one memory in common: Eggs.\n\n\"Prince did the cooking. Scrambled eggs,\" singer Jill Jones told GQ magazine. \"He put curry and a little bit of cheddar cheese in them. It was really good, actually.\n\n\"You know, he barely ate. I was always starving around him. I was always freaking hungry.\"\n\n\"Prince was never an eater,\" agreed Cat Glover, who joined him on the Sign O The Times and Lovesexy tours. \"He would usually smell his food. Literally. I never really seen Prince eat. I've seen him make pancakes - he made me pancakes, he made me eggs. But he's not the type of person that eats a lot.\n\n\"Yeah, he has made me scrambled eggs,\" said dancer Misty Copeland. \"Breakfast was his forte. He liked to use a lot of seasoning. They were delicious.\"\n\nIt's worth noting that Prince himself did not carry an eggy whiff.\n\n\"Ever since I've known Prince, I've attached a smell to him, which is lavender,\" Madonna once said. \"He reeks of it.\"\n\nShortly after Prince's death, the legendary \"vault\" that contained his archive of concert recordings, unreleased songs and rehearsal tapes was drilled open.\n\nAccording to the singer's former recording engineer Susan Rodgers, who started the vault for Prince during the 1980s, the facility was almost full when she left in 1987, with songs in there that pre-date his legendary Purple Rain album.\n\n\"We used to do two songs a day, and he just put them away,\" added his friend and engineer David Z. In fact, there's so much music waiting to be released, \"it probably won't be tapped out in our lifetime,\" said former Paisley Park employee Scott LeGere.\n\nThe first release came last year, when the 1999-era track Moonbeam Levels was unearthed for the compilation Prince 4Ever.\n\nThis June, an expanded version of Purple Rain is due, containing \"two incredible albums of previously unreleased Prince music and two complete concert films,\" according to Warner Bros Records. A leaked tracklist, external suggests fans will finally get to hear studio versions of the much-bootlegged songs Electric Intercourse and Possessed, amongst others.\n\nPrince's estate has also signed a $30m deal with Universal Music to release non-Warner Bros material - which will hopefully include fan favourites like Extraloveable, Wonderful Ass, Lisa, Train, Rebirth of the Flesh and Big Tall Wall.\n\nThere is some speculation that the star didn't maintain his vault to archival standards, and that some of the tapes may have deteriorated. Furthermore, the process of cataloguing the material hadn't even begun by the start of this year.\n\nOne of the most widely-circulated links after Prince's death was a video of his induction to the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2004, external.\n\nIt sees Prince joining an all-star version of the Beatles' While My Guitar Gently Weeps, backed by Tom Petty, Steve Winwood and George Harrison's son, Dhani. He keeps to the sidelines until the final two minutes, when he steps forward to deliver one of the most breathtaking guitar solos you've ever seen, full of fluttering high notes and ringing harmonics.\n\nAmazingly, Prince never rehearsed this moment with the band. At a run-through the night before it was Jeff Lynne's guitarist, Marc Mann, who took the solo.\n\n\"Prince doesn't say anything, just starts strumming, plays a few leads here and there, but for the most part, nothing memorable,\" recalled Joel Gallen, who directed the ceremony.\n\nBut when the big moment came, Prince stole the show. At one point, he turned to face Petty and Harrison, then fell backwards into the audience - while still playing - before strutting off stage, throwing his guitar into the air before the song ended.\n\n\"You see me nodding at him, to say, 'Go on, go on,'\" Petty told the New York Times, external. \"I remember I leaned out at him at one point and gave him a 'This is going great!' kind of look.\n\n\"He just burned it up. You could feel the electricity of 'something really big's going down here.'\"\n\nPrince later claimed he had never even heard the song before it was sent to him to learn for the performance.\n\nPicturing Prince - An Intimate Portrait by Steve Parke is out now, published by Cassell Illustrated."
