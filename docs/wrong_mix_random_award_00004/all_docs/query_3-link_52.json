        "text": "There’s no denying that the collective “we” is obsessed with our celebrities. Whether it’s their rise to the top or hitting rock bottom, you can guarantee there will be headlines. Similar to a car crash on the freeway, we can't look away.\n\nA major trend we’ve witnessed time and again is the aftermath surrounding superstar deaths. More specifically, stories of A-list celebrities who pass away with poor to non-existent estate plans. We’ve reported on famous examples such as Aretha Franklin and Jimi Hendrix.\n\nOne such example of a celebrity who died intestate (without a Will) is the world-renowned singer, Prince. His Royal Badness passed away back in 2016, but his name resurfaced in headlines more recently after his infamous estate battle finally drew to a close. Keep reading to find out about this long-awaited conclusion and what we can learn from it.\n\nWhy do many celebrities fail to have an estate plan in place?\n\nWhen it comes to estate planning, you'd think the rich and famous would be ahead of the game. However, time and again, we see high-profile celebrities leaving this world without the necessary arrangements, leading to drawn-out legal battles and family disputes.\n\nThere are countless potential reasons for this, and the best we can do is to take some guesses. A feeling of invincibility? Far too removed from performing administrative tasks? Too busy and hectic that they never got to it?\n\nWhile we may never know the reason, the end result remains the same - a chaotic and emotional, not to mention very public, battle for their loved ones that survived them. This recent settlement of the Prince estate battle highlights the importance of timely and organized estate planning, no matter one's status or wealth.\n\nThe status of Prince's estate\n\nAt the time of his death, Prince's estate was estimated to be worth approximately $200 million, making it one of the largest celebrity estates left unsettled. It consisted not only of his properties and monetary assets, but also his master recordings and unreleased music— an enormous treasure trove with vast earning potential for whomever would inherit it.\n\nHowever, Prince died unexpectedly and intestate, leaving no clear directives for how his vast estate should be divided.\n\nWhen an individual dies intestate, meaning without a valid Will in place, their assets are distributed according to the intestacy laws of the state where they resided. In most states, the deceased's spouse and children usually have the first claim. If the deceased was unmarried and childless, the assets could be split among surviving parents, siblings, or other relatives. If no relatives can be found, the estate may even escheat to the state. This process can be time-consuming, stressful, and often results in unintended consequences. An individual's wishes for their assets might not align with the default rules of intestacy, leading to potentially undesirable outcomes.\n\nIn Prince's case, he was survived by six family members: Tyka Nelson, his full sister, and five half-siblings— Sharon Nelson, Norrine Nelson, John R. Nelson, Omar Baker, and Alfred Jackson.\n\nPrince's siblings became the rightful heirs to his estate according to Minnesota intestacy laws. However, since his wishes weren't known regarding how to divide his estate amongst these siblings, a long, convoluted, and very public legal battle over his assets ensued.\n\nA high-profile battle & long-awaited conclusion\n\nThe battle over Prince's estate became a mammoth of a case, lasting over five years, involving multiple law firms, and racking up millions in legal fees. Key issues included determining the value of Prince's estate, which was subject to heavy tax obligations, and managing the release of his unreleased music. The siblings, despite their shared inheritance, found themselves in disagreements about how to manage these important matters.\n\nDuring the course of the legal proceedings, two of Prince's siblings, John R. Nelson and Alfred Jackson, sadly passed away. Their shares of the estate fell to their heirs, adding another layer of complexity to the proceedings. Additionally, the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) contested the initial $82.3 million valuation of Prince's estate, claiming it was undervalued by $80 million and demanding additional tax payments and fines.\n\nIn May 2021, five years later, the public finally learned about the conclusion of the Prince estate saga. Minnesota Judge Kevin Eide decreed that an agreement had been reached among the remaining heirs. The estate, valued at approximately $156.4 million after the IRS adjustments, was divided amongst Prince's siblings. The management of Prince's unreleased music was handed over to a professional music company to ensure proper handling and release. This was a relief for Prince fans, who could now anticipate the release of the late artist's hidden gems.\n\nThe importance of estate planning\n\nThe Prince estate battle serves as an important reminder for individuals to put their own estate plan in place.\n\nWhile it's easy to think that estate planning is only important for the wealthy or famous, it's simply not the case. Having a Will and/or Trust is critical for anyone who wants to make sure that their assets are distributed according to their wishes. Not only that, estate planning allows you take important legal actions such as nominating a Guardian for your pets or children, a Power of Attorney to handle your affairs should you become incapacitated, or make your healthcare wishes known.\n\nDying intestate – without a valid Will in place – can lead to unforeseen complications for your loved ones left behind.\n\nEmotionally charged legal circumstances can create or exacerbate family tensions, leading to strained relationships and potential rifts among family members. Disputes over inheritance are common, creating a bitter battle where resentment could last for generations. By contrast, having a comprehensive estate plan in place can help ensure a smooth transition of your assets upon your demise, giving you peace of mind and sparing your loved ones from unnecessary legal battles and emotional turmoil.\n\nFurther, intestacy can diminish the value of your estate. As shown in the Prince case, with no clear instructions on asset allocation, the probate process can be long and drawn out, accruing significant legal fees that are deducted from the estate's value. The tax implications of intestacy can also erode estate value. Without careful planning, a significant portion of the estate might end up going to the government in taxes rather than to loved ones. Legal disputes among heirs can also result in the sale of valuable assets under unfavorable conditions just to cover legal expenses or to allow for equal distribution among heirs. Forced, hasty sales often result in the estate receiving less than the asset's true worth.\n\nIntestacy: a redundancy, not a solution\n\nIntestacy laws serve a valuable purpose. In the case that an individual dies intestate, their legacy is at least in part protected by state laws that help identify their heirs and the order of succession. However, intestacy should be treated as a redundancy and not a solution.\n\nRedundancies by definition are safety mechanisms that are put into place as fail-safes. Intestacy laws should not be treated as an integral part of an estate strategy.\n\nUnfortunately, as we've seen, it's all too common for individuals to die without an estate plan in place.\n\nTake action: protect your legacy with an estate plan\n\nOur hope at Trust & Will is that our readers internalize these celebrity case studies as cautionary tales that inspire action.\n\nWhile your personal legacy may not look anything like Prince's, it's a valuable and important legacy nonetheless. It's something to be cherished and protected for your loved ones and future generations. A proper estate plan can help ensure that your legacy won't be shrouded in legal strife, which in turn can put a stress on your loved ones' relationship and finances.
