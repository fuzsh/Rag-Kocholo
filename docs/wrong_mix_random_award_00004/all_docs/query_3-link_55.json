I just like Minneapolis a little bit better.\" – Prince\n\nHow can I get a job at Paisley Park?\n\nJoin our team!

The rich narrative that Prince built around Paisley Park positions it as much a concept and myth as it is physical space.\n\nAs a physical venue, Prince built Paisley Park to be an environment where he could create in a free, independent and open manner – realizing any artistic vision, whether it be a song, video, movie, photoshoot, visual art form or any other creative output all under one roof. Decades later, this concept of an all-encompassing, single-location creative haven would become popular, but Paisley Park was the first-of-its-kind in the musical world.\n\nIn concept, Paisley Park is an environment in which one can be truly “free” – uninhibited by history, social, cultural or economic factors; characteristics like ethnicity, race, wealth and education don’t matter at Paisley Park. In his 1985 song “Paisley Park,” Prince sings, “Admission is easy, just say U Believe, and come 2 this Place in your heart, Paisley Park is in your heart.”\n\nWhy did Prince build Paisley Park in Minneapolis?\n\nMinneapolis helped shape Prince into the man and the artist he became.

Maybe you want to launch a business. Maybe you want to turn a hobby into something more. Or maybe you have a creative project to share with the world. Whatever it is, the way you tell your story online can make all the difference.\n\nHow do I buy tickets to Paisley Park?\n\n“Admission is easy, just say U B-lieve.” Tickets are available for purchase online 24/7.

Priority is given to organizations whose philosophy aligns with organizations that Prince supported in the past.

These tours will be planned not to disrupt the existing tour schedule and will only be given out upon request. This type of tour offering is not guaranteed, but if you feel that your group aligns with a cause that Prince supported in the past, email info@paisleypark.com for more information."
