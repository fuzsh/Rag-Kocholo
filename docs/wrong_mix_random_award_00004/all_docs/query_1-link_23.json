        "text": "Reformulated gasoline (RFG) is gasoline blended to burn more cleanly than conventional gasoline and to reduce smog-forming and toxic pollutants in the air we breathe. The RFG program was mandated by Congress in the 1990 Clean Air Act amendments. The first phase of the RFG program began in 1995 and the second (current) phase began in 2000.\n\nRFG is required in cities with high smog levels and is optional elsewhere. RFG is currently used in 17 states and the District of Columbia. About 25 percent of gasoline sold in the U.S. is reformulated.\n\nThe air quality benefits RFG has achieved represent a significant part of the country's smog reduction strategy. The RFG program, combined with other industrial and transportation controls aimed at smog reduction, is contributing to the long-term downward trend in U.S. smog levels. About 75 million people breathe cleaner air because of RFG.\n\nThe Fuel Streamlining rule, which was finalized on December 4, 2020 (See 85 FR 78412.) simplified the RFG summer volatile organic compound (VOC) standards by establishing a 7.4 psi RVP standard for RFG. The final rule also updated the RFG opt-out procedures by eliminating outdated regulatory text and establishing a process that mandatory RFG areas can use to opt-out of the requirement if they meet the specified criteria. More information is available on the Fuels Regulatory Streamlining webpage.\n\nPhase II Reformulated Gasoline: The Next Major Step Toward Cleaner Air (pdf) (152 K, November 1999, EPA-420-F-99-042)\n\nLearn more about RFG federal standards.\n\nThe tables below list the RFG covered areas including the counties and independent cities in each area and descriptions of any partial counties in the RFG area.\n\nThe nine RFG covered areas required by 42 U.S.C. 7545(k)(10)(D) to implement RFG\n\nRFG covered areas based on being reclassified as Severe ozone nonattainment areas under 42 U.S.C. 7511(b)\n\nRFG covered areas based on being classified ozone nonattainment areas at the time that the state requested to opt into RFG under 42 U.S.C. 7545(k)(6)(A)(i)\n\nRFG covered area that is located in the ozone transport region established by 42 U.S.C. 7511c(a) that a state requested to opt into RFG under 42 U.S.C. 7545(k)(6)(B)(i)(I)\n\nA note about federal RFG requirements in California\n\nAreas where EPA has approved a state’s request to “opt-out” of federal RFG\n\nThe nine RFG covered areas required by 42 U.S.C. 7545(k)(10)(D) to implement RFG:\n\nArea Designation\n\nState\n\nCounties\n\nIndependent Cities\n\n1 That portion of San Bernardino County, CA that lies south of latitude 35 degrees, 10 minutes north and west of longitude 115 degrees, 45 minutes west.\n\n2That portion of Riverside County, CA that lies to the west of a line described as follows: beginning at the northeast corner of Section 4, Township 2 South, Range 5 East, a point on the boundary line common to Riverside and San Bernardino Counties; then southerly along section lines to the centerline of the Colorado River Aqueduct; then southeasterly along the centerline of said Colorado River Aqueduct to the southerly line of Section 36, Township 3 South, Range 7 East; then easterly along the township line to the northeast corner of Section 6, Township 4 South, Range 9 East; then southerly along the easterly line of Section 6 to the southeast corner thereof; then easterly along section lines to the northeast corner of Section 10, Township 4 South, Range 9 East; then southerly along section lines to the southeast corner of Section 15, Township 4 South, Range 9 East; then easterly along the section lines to the northeast corner of Section 21, Township 4 South, Range 10 East; then southerly along the easterly line of Section 21 to the southeast corner thereof; then easterly along the northerly line of Section 27 to the northeast corner thereof; then southerly along section lines to the southeast corner of Section 34, Township 4 South, Range 10 East; then easterly along the township line to the northeast corner of Section 2, Township 5 South, Range 10 East; then southerly along the easterly line of Section 2, to the southeast corner thereof; then easterly along the northerly line of Section 12 to the northeast corner thereof; then southerly along the range line to the southwest corner of Section 18, Township 5 South, Range 11 East; then easterly along section lines to the northeast corner of Section 24, Township 5 South, Range 11 East; and then southerly along the range line to the southeast corner of Section 36, Township 8 South, Range 11 East, a point on the boundary line common to Riverside and San Diego Counties.\n\nRFG covered areas based on being reclassified as Severe ozone nonattainment areas under 42 U.S.C. 7511(b):\n\nArea Designation\n\nState or District\n\nCounties\n\nIndependent Cities\n\nNote: On October 7, 2022 (87 FR 60926) EPA reclassified the following areas as Severe for the 2008 ozone NAAQS:\n\nNew York-N.

Collins-Loveland, CO (Denver); and\n\nMorongo Band of Mission Indians, CA\n\nThese reclassifications are effective on November 7, 2022. Clean Air Act section 211(k)(10)(D) requires that the sale of conventional gasoline be prohibited in any ozone nonattainment area that is reclassified as Severe beginning one year after the effective date of the reclassification. The sale of RFG is already required in the New York, Houston and Morongo Band of Mission Indians areas because they are among the original nine areas required to implement RFG as shown above and the sale of RFG will continue in these areas. The Morongo Band of Mission Indians area is within the Los Angeles-Anaheim-Riverside RFG area listed in the first table above.\n\nRFG is already required in four counties in the Dallas area because EPA approved a request from Texas to opt those counties into the RFG program. When the prohibition on the sale of conventional gasoline begins on November 7, 2023, the Dallas RFG covered area will expand from the current four counties to all 10 counties in the 2008 ozone NAAQS nonattainment area. The gasoline sold in all 10 counties in the Dallas area will be required to comply with the summer Reid Vapor Pressure (RVP) standard of 7.4 psi beginning on June 1, 2024 for wholesale purchaser consumers and for all other parties beginning on May 1, 2024.\n\nRFG has not previously been required in the Denver area. The prohibition on the sale of conventional gasoline in the Denver area will begin on November 7, 2023. The gasoline sold in the Denver area will be required to comply with the summer RVP standard of 7.4 psi beginning on June 1, 2024 for wholesale purchaser consumers and for all other parties beginning on May 1, 2024.\n\n1All portions of Placer County except that portion of the County within the drainage area naturally tributary to Lake Tahoe including said Lake, plus that area in the vicinity of the head of the Truckee River described as follows: commencing at the point common to the aforementioned drainage area crestline and the line common to Townships 15 North and 16 North, Mount Diablo Base and Meridian (M.D.B.& M.), and following that line in a westerly direction to the northwest corner of Section 3, Township 15 North, Range 16 East, M.D.B.& M., thence south along the west line of Sections 3 and 10, Township 15 North, Range 16 East, M.D.B.& M., to the intersection with the said drainage area crestline, thence following the said drainage area boundary in a southeasterly, then northeasterly direction to and along the Lake Tahoe Dam, thence following the said drainage area crestline in a northeasterly, then northwesterly direction to the point of beginning.\n\n2That portion of Solano County that lies north and east of a line described as follows: beginning at the intersection of the westerly boundary of Solano County and the 1/4 section line running east and west through the center of Section 34; T. 6 N., R. 2 W., M.D.B.& M.; thence east along said 1/4 section line to the east boundary of Section 36, T. 6 N., R. 2 W.; thence south 1/2 mile and east 2.0 miles, more or less, along the west and south boundary of Los Putos Rancho to the northwest corner of Section 4, T. 5 N., R. 1 W.; thence east along a line common to T. 5 N. and T. 6 N. to the northeast corner of Section 3, T. 5 N., R. 1 E.; thence south along section lines to the southeast corner of Section 10, T. 3 N., R. 1 E.; thence east along section lines to the south 1/4 corner of Section 8, T. 3 N., R. 2 E.; thence east to the boundary between Solano and Sacramento Counties.\n\n3That portion of Sutter County south of a line connecting the northern border of Yolo Co. to the SW tip of Yuba Co. and continuing along the southern Yuba Co. border to Placer Co.\n\n4The western portion of Kern County is included in the San Joaquin Valley area.
