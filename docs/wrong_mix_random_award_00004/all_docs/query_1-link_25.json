        "text": "Covenant House provides safe harbor and supportive services to young people ages 18 to 24 who are facing homelessness, disconnection, and exploitation. The programs and services that we offer can help you get back on track to achieve housing, career, and economic stability.\n\nNo one is ever turned away without support of some kind.\n\nAt one of our emergency overnight shelters, you can get a meal, hot shower, a safe place to sleep, and the chance to wash and dry your clothes.\n\nA standard crisis shelter room includes minimal furniture (bunk beds and secured storage) and a shared bathroom.\n\nOur bedrooms provide a safe space for sleeping, grooming, and storing your belongings. But they are not a hangout space. Instead, we have communal spaces throughout our buildings that are specifically there to build community, encourage healthy relationships, and inspire you to pursue new opportunities. You'll also have access to a closet full of clothes to help you land a job, celebrate a graduation, or prepare for the elements outside.\n\nOur communal spaces include a cafeteria, gym, lounges, and laundry rooms, making our facilities more of a home than a “homeless shelter.”\n\nOur shelters are open 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. You can come to us anytime, day or night. Even if you walk through our doors in the dead of night, we will always have a meal waiting for you.\n\nYou do not need to be referred to us through an official channel.\n\nThe average length of stay at our crisis shelters is under 30 days, but every timeline is different.\n\nYou can leave Covenant House and come back voluntarily, as many times as you need. We know many young people need more than one chance to achieve a future free from homelessness—and that is exactly what we provide. If you choose to stay with our program, we develop individual case plans tailored to your specific needs.\n\nWhile the average length of stay at our crisis shelters is under 30 days, we understand that everyone's journey is unique. At Covenant House, you have the option to leave and return voluntarily as many times as you need. We recognize that many young people require multiple opportunities to secure a future free from homelessness, and we are here to support you throughout that process. If you decide to stay with our program, we will create individualized case plans designed to meet your specific needs."
