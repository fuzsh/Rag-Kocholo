        "text": "Carmine ‘Lilo’ Galante was considered to be working for the Genovese Crime family and as a vicious and ambitious person. But he had been murdered, which is remembered in the Mafia history and among the most memorable of all mob hits until date. His body was noticed to have been filled with lead and sprawled on the back of his tiny Queens restaurant patio, with his trademark cigar that remained between his teeth, tightly clenched.\n\nAbout Carmine\n\nIt was on 21st February 1910 that Camillo was born on Manhattan’s Lower East Side and was the first American- Sicilian generation. He had his name Camillo ditched and was known as Carmine instead. With time, he had his name shortened to ‘Lilo’, while he was popular among his associates as Galante. Initially, he took to petty thefts at the young age of 14 and at 15 dropped from school. He had been to reform school few times and as regarded as ‘incorrigible delinquent’.\n\nHis activities\n\nBetween 1923 and 26, he was employed ostensibly with Lubin Artificial Flower Co., West Broadway and got engaged in lucrative criminal career. He was arrested several times, but got released after having the police officials bribed. But in 1926 December, he got arrested for robbery and second degree assault and sentenced to 5 years. After he got released, he again got back to his usual ways of crime. He got involved in the murder of Officer De Castillia and on 30th August, 1930 got murdered. On 8th January 1931, he got remanded to Ossining’s Sing Sing Prison, New York and transferred to Dannemora’s Clinton Correctional Facility, New York, from where he got released on 1st May, 1939.\n\nWhen in prison, his IQ test found him to be lame, equating to that of 14 years old. He was also diagnosed of having ‘neuropathic psychopathic personality’, while displaying gonorrhea’s early signs.\n\nHe was later inducted into the Bonanno Mafia Family as Made Man during the early 1940s and had performed several hits for his boss Vito Genovese, during the 1930s through 1940s. In 1953, he was sent to the Canadian border to have the drug operation to be supervised for about 3 years. But after getting caught by the police, and not having any evidence for making an arrest, Galante was deported to America, as ‘undesirable alien’.\n\nHowever, the Rastelli and Bonanno family had Galante murdered."
