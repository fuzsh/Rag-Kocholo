        "text": "Baldish, bespectacled and with a bent walk, Carmine Galante hardly resembled the popular image of a powerful underworld figure.\n\nTo passers‐by he looked like a relaxed, retired grandfather as he picked out fruit and vegetables at Balducci's in Greenwich Village or stopped for espresso and cannoli at the Derobertis Pastry Shop on the Lower East Side.\n\nYet he was a roan who had been in serious trouble with the law since the age of 10, a man with an unchallenged underworld reputation for viciousness and a man who openly vowed that he would become the boss of New York's organized crime families.\n\nAt the age of 69, while lunching yesterday in the garden of a quiet restaurant in the rundown Bushwick Section of Brooklyn, Mr. Galante was killed by a blast from an assassin's shotgun.\n\n‘He Was Into Everything’\n\n“He vowed when he got out of prison that he would become a powerhouse,” said Police Lieut. Remo Franceshini, an organized crime expert who followed Mr. Galante's career closely. “He was into everything — narcotics, pornography, loan‐sharking, labor rackets. He was trying to turn all the crime families upside down.”\n\nLieutenant Franceshini, who was the former chief of the Police Department's organized crime squad and who now heads the Queens District Attorney's detective squad, said he believed Mr. Galante was executed most probably on or: ders from a rival underworld figure, Frank (Funzi) Tieri. Law enforcement officials say Mr. Tieri is the leader of a crime faction organized by the late Vito Genovese.\n\nOf Mr. Galante, Lieutenant Franceshini said: “He was trying to cut into the Genovese family and there were rumors Tieri had put out a contract on Galante. Galante was pushing too hard.”\n\nThomas Puccio, the head of the United States Justice Department's Organized Crime Strike Force in Brooklyn, said one reason Mr. Galante may have been slain was that he had attracted too much publicity. “Crime people resented him because he became a media event and generated too much heat on everyone,” Mr. Puccio explained, adding:\n\n“But I don't think he had any real chance of taking over. He was wedded to the old system, loan‐sharking, gambling, narcotics. That's too risky today for the mob. He was out of tune with the cleaner, white collar rackets that the mob now prefers.”\n\nBorn in East Harlem\n\nCarmine Galante was born on Feb. 21, 1910, in an East Harlem tenement. His parents had emigrated from the fishing village of Castellammare del Golfo in Sicily.\n\nBy the age of 10, Carmine Galante was in serious trouble with the law. He was sent to a reform school as an “incorrigible defendant.”\n\nSeven years later, he was convicted of assault and sentenced to Sing Sing Prison. In the 1940's, he reportedly became the head of a gang on the Lower East Side.\n\nLaw enforcement officials said that Mr. Galante's reputation as an underworld figure was enhanced because he was believed to have been involved in the 1943 slaying of Carlo Tresca, the editor of an anarchist newspaper in New York. The killing reportedly was ordered by Vito Genevose to ingratiate himself with Benito Mussolini, Italy's Fascist leader.\n\nBy 1952, according to law enforcement intelligence files, Mr. Galante had become a high‐ranking racketeer in an underworld group led by Joseph Bonnano. In police dossiers, Mr. Galante’ also acquired two nicknames — a symbolic recognition of the importance attached to him by the police. He was known as “Lilo” and “the Cigar.”\n\nSpoke Several Dialects\n\nMr. Galante was one of the first bosses of organized crime to purportedly get deeply involved in narcotics trafficking. Because he spoke several Italian dialects and was fluent in French and Spanish, he was said to have been frequently sent abroad to arrange million‐dollar heroin importing deals.\n\nThe narcotics trafficking led to a 1960 indictment for drug violations. The trial ended in a mistrial after the foreman of the jury broke his back in a fall. Federal officials said they believed that the foreman was deliberately assaulted in order to halt the trial.\n\nBut two years later, Mr. Galante was convicted on the Federal narcotics charge. He served 12 years in a Federal prison and it was during this period that he allegedly told associates that he would take a leading role in organized crime when he emerged from prison. Law enforcement officials said that, based on reports from informers, Mr. Galante became incensed by the policies of the late Carlo Gambino, who was believed lo have been the most powerful underworld leader of the 1960s.\n\nMr. Galante was said to have been upset by Mr. Gambino's discouragement of narcotics deals; his refusal to allow crime families to expand their membership and Mr. Gambino's supposed lack of loyalty to organized crime traditions.\n\nAfter being paroled in 1974, Mr. Galante quickly took over the Bonanno family. Mr. Bonanno had retired while Mr. Galante was in prison and the interim leader, Philip Rastelli, refused to give up control. But, after Mr. Rastelli's son‐inlaw was kilied by gunmen on a Brooklyn street, he stepped aside for Mr. Galante.\n\nFollowing Mr. Gambino's death, of natural causes in 1976, law enforcement officials said Mr. Galante boasted to associates that he would be the next “boss of bosses.”\n\nMr. Galante was returned to prison for a parole violation in 1978 but, after being jailed for 17 months, he was released last March 23 on $50,000 bail for a new parole hearing. “I'm out and it's beautiful to breath the clean air,” Mr. Galante said.\n\nMr. Galante's official residence was at 160 Waverly Place in Greenwich Village. According to law enforcement records, he was married but had lived for 20 years with Ann Acquavella, who was the mother of two of his five children.\n\nTrailed on Jogging Path\n\nLaw enforcement experts maintain that Miss Acquavella was married to a friend of Mr. Galante's, Steven Schwartz, in order to legitimize her two children.\n\nIn recent years, Mr. Galante lived with her at 155 East 38th Street. City and Federal law enforcement agents often trailed the chunky, 5 foot 4 inch Mr. Galante as he jogged along the East River Drive or as he was chauffeured to a business he owned, the L & T Cleaners at 245 Elizabeth Street in Little Italy.\n\nDetectives who followed Mr. Galante on his recent rounds said he walked the streets of the area like an aristocrat. They said that many who knew him would bow slightly or lightly touch his arm."
