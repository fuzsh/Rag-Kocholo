        "text": "The East Harlem Mafia-Linked Purple Gang (And Who Named Them?)\n\nIn November 2013, a low-profile Luchese associate was murdered in the Bronx -- and many stories in the media blitz that followed referenced the Purple Gang, an obscure 1970s street gang with reputed Mafia links.\n\nPolice probe Meldish shooting in the Bronx in 2013.\n\nThe Purple Gang roamed the South Bronx and Harlem where members were involved in the large‐scale distribution of heroin. They also whacked people -- and in many cases, dismembered their victims, of which there reportedly were 17 by December 1977. (Many of the 17 had been active informants for law enforcement when slain.)\n\nPurple Gang members essentially cut their teeth as glorified coffee boys in decade-long apprenticeships. They stepped up their game when the competition was wiped out -- meaning, they filled a huge niche after law enforcement cleared away many local narcotics trafficking rings, including the one known as the French Connection. The Purple Gang entered the contract killing business after it got into drug trafficking.\n\nRemember the \"young Henry\" part of Goodfellas?\n\nA 1977 DEA report asserted that: “The younger (Purple Gang) group, impressed by the antics, violence and wealth of the older traffickers began to emulate them and after a while became . . . uncontrollable . . .”\n\n(While we're on the topic, one of the last remaining drug kingpins attached to the French Connection case, Herbert Sperling -- who was accused of ordering the execution of Vincent Papa, the mobster who masterminded the theft of 400 pounds of French Connection heroin and cocaine from a police vault -- died this past summer, on July 3, at Federal Medical Center-Devens, a long-term care facility about 40 miles west of Boston. He was 79 and had been among the first to be given a federal life sentence for drug trafficking.)\n\nAccording to a 1977 New York Times report: \"In 1973, when a major law enforcement push against wholesale heroin distribution resulted in the convictions of Louis Inglese, the former drug boss of the Pleasant Avenue area, John Campopiano, and Carmine Tramunti, a highranking member of the Luchese crime family, the young members of the Purple Gang—according to the D.E.A.—moved to fill the vacancies in their local narcotics distribution network.\n\n\"Narcotics traffic in New York is controlled by both Italian and black organized crime groups. According to one intelligence report, members of the Purple Gang were supplying the black heroin network of the recently convicted drug dealer Leroy (Nicky) Barnes with heroin for $75,000 a kilogram.”\n\nMost Purple Gang members were raised on Pleasant Avenue between 110th and 117th streets and were related to known Mafia figures or had been allied with local drug traffickers. (Did law enforcement sources in the 1970s see a difference? \"Local drug traffickers\" may refer to black kingpins, i.e., Nicky Barnes.)\n\nThe gang is still mentioned occasionally -- usually when former members kill someone, are elevated in a Mafia family's hierarchy, or are themselves killed.\n\nThe murdered Luchese associate, Michael Meldish -- who was shot in the head in November 2013 -- was referred to in stories about the killing as the former boss of the Purple Gang.\n\nAdding \"color\" to early stories about the Meldish murder was NYPD Detective Sgt. Joseph Coffey, who died in September 2015. \"Publicity Joe\" -- as \"The Westies,\" the Westside Irish mob once allied with the Gambinos, supposedly dubbed Coffey -- recalled Michael Meldish's past affiliation with the gang.\n\nCoffey was among the 1970s-era investigators who originally probed the gang. He was quoted in a 1979 story about how the Purple Gang was suspected of involvement in a wave of unsolved .22 caliber killings -- many of which were allegedly carried out with the same weapon. The killings were spread out geographically in the Northeast, Midwest, and elsewhere. (The murder of Outfit Don Sam Giancana was reportedly among the murders involved in that investigation.) The small .22 was perfect for hits, as stories noted, for many reasons (among them: the pistol can be easily muffled with a silencer).\n\nJoe Coffey investigated the Purple Gang in the 1970s.\n\nThe story of the Purple Gang exploded on the front page in 1977 with the Times story, which was based on “confidential police and Federal agency intelligence reports,” one of which was a December 1976 report by the DEA that spoke “of the Purple Gang’s ‘enormous capacity for’ violence” and “lack of respect for other members of organized crime. \"\n\nLaw enforcement -- all law enforcement, the \"big three\" of FBI, DEA, and NYPD -- was issuing a blood curdling warning about an emerging \"sixth family\" (one of three or four \"emerging sixth families\" we're aware of, historically speaking) that was poised to clash with all five New York families. It looked like bodies were going to start piling up any day.\n\nThen, after a 1979 boost related to the .22 caliber killings, the Purple Gang story seemed to fizzle and die, without resolution.\n\nOne source, a former Bronx resident, told us he had heard of the Purple Gang and knew some of its alleged members. (He was later involved in a plot to murder a one-time Purple Gang member who is today a reputed boss of one of the Five Families.) The source wasn't knowledgeable about much else about the Purple Gang.\n\nBut in comments to previous stories, we've also heard that there was never a \"Purple Gang\" in East Harlem.\n\nThe Color Purple\n\nOne of the earliest East Harlem Purple Gang references (the first, as per our research) was the story New York Gang Reported to Sell Death and Drugs.\n\nWritten by Howard Blum, it appeared on page one of the December 16, 1977, New York Times.\n\n“A Manhattan gang, whose members worked just a decade ago as teen‐age errand boys for major narcotics traffickers, has now emerged as a new and violent force of its own in organized crime in New York,” the story begins.\n\n“The police say the group may attempt to become this region’s sixth organized‐crime family. That effort, the police say, could result in a mob war.”\n\nPolice intelligence authorities theorized that the group was trying to expand its “lucrative heroin distribution network” by moving in on the “Galante family. \"\n\nSources also noted that the Purple Gang seemed to be a kind of broken off faction of Cosa Nostra. The Purple Gang was said to be like the Gallo crew. (That crew twice went to war with the Colombo crime family, the first time when it was still the Profaci family.) The flamboyant Crazy Joe Gallo had been killed five years prior, in April 1972.\n\nLaw enforcement had lots of speculation to consider, and it wasn't looking pretty...\n\nWe recently contacted Howard Blum, the journalist who wrote that Times story, to ask him about how he happened upon the Purple Gang and its nefarious doings. Initially, he couldn't recall. (He replied with: \"1977? That was 14 books and a million articles ago! I'd be eager to help, but for the life of me I have no memories about the Purple Gang!\")\n\nThen, a short while later, after we begged pressed him, he responded again with: \"I went back to my NYT story and it jogged my memory -- a small bit. As best I can remember, someone in the NYPD OC Taskforce handed me the report. And two days later I got it into the paper. I don't recall doing any independent research or speaking with OC sources.\"\n\nSo law enforcement may have handed over to the press the story about the violent mob-affiliated crew. It's not difficult to consider possible reasons why they'd seek out the media. The FBI, DEA, and local police intelligence units had been investigating the gang for at least the previous two years, but, as of December 1977, the probes “ha(d) not resulted in large‐scale arrests.” There were some arrests, for assault and narcotics charges. (Specifically, we are told that members were arrested in Monroe, New York, for assaulting private sanitation employees. They had been hired by Genovese capo Joseph Pagano, who had a record of narcotics arrests and was attempting to control refuse carting in Rockland and Orange counties.)\n\nMichael Meldish\n\nAs for the gang's name: \"The group... calls itself the Purple Gang, after the band of criminals that terrorized Detroit during the Prohibition era...\"\n\nDid they actually name themselves? While it sounds absurd to us here and now, we couldn't presume to know with certainty. It also seems like by using a name, they'd only be hurting themselves by giving law enforcement a \"handle\" with which to approach them. And such a name would almost guarantee media interest -- face it, the Purple Gang beats a story about a bunch of unknown nobodies up in Harlem doing some really bad stuff....\n\nBecause so much time has passed, we doubt anyone will ever reveal anything definitive about where the Purple Gang name truly came from, if not from the members themselves, as law enforcement alleged. (We wish Joe Coffey were still here...)\n\nNevertheless, Jerry Capeci and major news organizations continue to report on the Purple Gang. So will we...\n\nOne source, an insider with extensive knowledge about law enforcement and organized crime activity over the decades, may have put it best when he told us: \"I don’t think there were ever people who called themselves the Purple Gang, but perhaps law enforcement coined that nickname for real people they were investigating.\" (Furthermore, he recalled that there was also a purple gang on TV. We don't recall a purple gang television show, but we're curious about something and are looking into it.)\n\nIn closing, it seems that law enforcement (with visions of recent gangland mayhem in their brain -- a la Joe Gallo in Umberto's in Little Italy; if only they knew what was coming in '79 and '81) went to the Times for help with what they viewed as a growing threat. Unlike today, the mob was not only highly active, it was, with its deep pockets of bribe money, definitively winning its ongoing war with law enforcement. Ultimately, law enforcement may have exaggerated the Purple Gang threat. But at the time, they had no way of knowing that.\n\nMob Wife Ex-Husband Hector Pagan In Brooklyn Halfway House With April 2021 Release Date\n\nBack in 2014, despite the heartfelt pleas of a murdered man's daughter, Brooklyn Federal Judge John Gleeson sentenced Hector (Junior) Pagan to 11 years in prison —and offered a thoughtful comment. James Donovan was killed during a botched robbery in 2010. He said, “We can only hope” that by time Pagan is released “we have prepared him for re-entry into society to mitigate the risk” of what would happen if Pagan returned to a life of crime. How far Judge Gleeson's hope gets us is something we will discover very soon. The former Bonanno associate/Mob Wives bit player is getting out of the can in a few months..... He is currently residing at the Brooklyn RRM (a halfway house where he and other Federal offenders receive \"community-based services that will assist with their reentry needs.\") Pagan's official reentry date is April 18, 2021. Renee Graziano's ex-husband got a reduced sentence in 2014 because he flipped and testified against two cohorts who were involve\n\nHoodwinked: Restaurateur on Ramsay's Kitchen Nightmares Was a Mobster\n\nPeter (Peter Pasta) Pellegrino, formerly of the Babylon, New York restaurant Peter’s Italian Restaurant, really is -- or was -- a gangster. Gordon gives a pep talk. Peter is ready for action..... The once-promising Bonanno crime family member who appeared in Kitchen Nightmares now calls himself a brokester . And the Bonanno crime family, with which he was once affiliated has disowned him. So has the rest of New York's Cosa Nostra, according to FBI documents and Peter Pasta himself. But before all that he appeared on an episode of Kitchen Nightmares in which he acted very much like the mobster he allegedly was trying to become around the time of filming. (See Peter's Italian Restaurant menu here .) Back then Peter Pasta was an up-and-coming Bonanno associate who \"earned\" $15 grand a week from bookmaking. At the time, he also owned two boats that he'd park in a pricey nearby Babylon harbor called Great South Bay. Gang Land News's Jerry Capec\n\nBath Avenue Crew Rose High, Fell Hard\n\nThis story from 2014 is one of the most popular on this site—and we didn't even know it until very recently (for reasons stemming from the fallibility of generalized analytics data.) Members of the Bath Avenue Crew were as young as 8 years old when they began to align themselves with the biggest, baddest gang in America: Cosa Nostra, specifically the Five Families. Bath Avenue Crew founding members. They saw the wiseguys on the street pulling up to the curbs in their big shiny Cadillacs, loafing around social clubs wearing pricey suits and sporting hundred-dollar haircuts and manicured fingernails. But the guys presented more than just a cold, distant image to watch; Mafia members interacted with the kids, joked around with them and showed them there were other ways to make it through life. The wiseguys doled out twenty-dollar bills like they were nothing. The wiseguys patted them on the back, told them they were \"good kids,\" and maybe asked them to watch the cars\n\nDeborah Merlino Certainly Doesn't Exemplify the Stereotypical Mob Wife\n\nThe biggest bombshell in Joseph (Skinny Joey) Merlino's federal racketeering trial in Manhattan arguably had nothing to do with any of the crimes listed in the indictment . We love gossip, especially gossip about extramarital affairs. Skinny Joey with wife Deborah Consider that the main charge facing Merlino is his alleged involvement \"in a scheme targeting providers of health insurance by causing, and causing others to cause, corrupt doctors to issue unnecessary and excessive prescriptions for expensive compound cream that were then billed to the Victim Insurers.\" Who really cares about poor victimized insurance companies? USA Today recently profiled some of the most-reviled companies in the United States, and wouldn't you know: \"Few industries are as widely detested as the insurance industry.\" (FYI, \"American consumers appear to especially dislike health insurance giant Cigna.\") Genovese turncoat John (JR) Rubeo\n\nWho Fat Andy Loved; John Gotti's Other Side: Anthony Ruggiano Junior, Part FOUR\n\nIn the 1960s and 1970s, Anthony (Fat Andy) Ruggiano had one of the biggest crews in the Gambino family, and he wanted to keep it that way. Fat Andy, Fritzy Giovanelli, sitting Lenny DiMaria, far right in gray Sonny Franzese He had had around 70-75 guys in his crew, and out of all of them, Andy wanted to straighten out only one, Nicky Corozzo. Fat Andy \"didn’t want to make anybody his equal at one point,\" said Anthony Junior. \"He had a big crew with him and he liked it that way. He wound up being right.\" Andy and Anthony (Tony Lee) Guerrieri even got into an argument over Fat Andy's reluctance to make any of his guys. Tony Lee had wanted to put Anthony (Tony Pep) Trentacosta up to be straightened out with Nicky. Fat Andy prevailed, however, and they both decided that only Nicky would get made. Once Andy proposed Nicky, Nicky went out of his way to express his gratitude to Ruggiano. \"After my father proposed Nicky, Nicky went to my father\n\nThe Mob's Underground Railroad: How Allie Boy Persico Survived On The Lam For Seven Years\n\nIn 1987, reputed Colombo boss Carmine Persico knew that, short of his lawyers one day cooking up a miracle, he would in all likelihood be spending the rest of his life in prison. He had been convicted in two separate trials: the Mafia Commission trial and a separate racketeering trial involving the Colombo family's operations. (Persico died in 2019 at age 85 after serving 32 years of that 136-year prison sentence following his two convictions.) Allie Boy Persico was on the run for seven years. The cases were separate, but overlapped, the common denominator being FBI surveillance recordings of Colombo soldier Ralph Scopo’s conversations, which alerted the Feds to the initial evidence that would help them build the Commission Case. Scopo was the bagman in a large-scale ongoing racket involving shaking down concrete contractors at major construction projects. As the president of the Cement and Concrete Workers District Council of the Laborers' International Union of North America\n\nWiseguy Jerry Chilli Was a One-Man Crimewave\n\nJerry Chilli* died last Saturday from throat cancer; a private funeral mass will be held in Florida, which is where the Bonanno capo spent the greater part of his adult life. (Especially after New Jersey law enforcement officials, in no uncertain terms, told him to depart New Jersey.) Jerry Chilli, at the top of the game. Chilli was a stone-cold gangster who shunned the limelight, who never \"talked\" and never took a step back, even when he knew there could be a steep price to pay. He was a tough guy with his fists who made his bones with a gun. The younger of two brothers (his brother moved up faster and earned more), Jerry Chilli served lots of prison time, which some chalk up to his involvement with the notorious Costabile \"Gus\" Farace, the mob associate who executed an undercover federal agent on Staten Island in 1989. (A 1991 made-for-television film about Farace is available on DVD featuring several actors who today are high profile, including Sa\n\nNotorious Bonanno Wiseguy Bruno Indelicato Released From Prison\n\nLongtime Bonanno wiseguy Anthony (Bruno) Indelicato, 75, who shot his way into the annals of American organized crime, was released from prison on May 20, 2022, as per the BOP inmate locator website. Bruno Indelicato, left, Frank Lino. The son of the brutally murdered Alphonse (Sonny Red) Indelicato, a capo who led a doomed faction of the Bonanno family, Bruno was in his heyday a feared stone killer with a legendary appetite for cocaine. Indelicato was one of three masked gunmen who walked into Joe & Mary’s restaurant in the Bushwick section of Brooklyn one hot July day in 1979 and blasted Carmine Galante at close range while the volcanic, would-be usurper enjoyed a customary, post-prandial cigar. Indelicato’s efforts to protect the family’s boss paid dividends: Indelicato was among a slew of Bonanno soldiers elevated to capo by a grateful Philip (Rusty) Rastelli in the wake of the Galante hits. But Cosa Nostra being Cosa Nostra, it wasn't long—a couple of years—before Bruno\n\nIf Uncle Joe Retires What Happens in Philadelphia?\n\nJoe Ligambi, who recently got out of prison following two mistrials for what primarily amounted to gambling-related charges, says that he is done, finito, with Cosa Nostra. Ligambi wants to relax, to summer in Longport and winter in Florida. In 1980, violence on the streets of Philadelphia rose sharply following Angelo Bruno's murder. Anyone in Ligambi's position would say the same thing, but the question is, does he really meant it? And if he does, who will step in and take over? Too many wiseguys, if history is taken into consideration.\n\nWhy Was Mob Boss Tommy Eboli Really Killed?\n\nFrom left, Al Pacino, Genovese capo Patsy Eboli and Al Lettieri. I found the following while researching where in Sicily Al Lettieri 's family arrived from. Lettieri, the great character actor of the 1970s, was noticed for his infamous turn in the Godfather ; my next personal favorite Lettieri character after Virgil (The Turk) Sollozzo has to be the villian in the Steve McQueen flick The Getaway (based on the excellent novel of the same name by Jim Thompson, the blackhearted writer of criminal fictional masterpieces .) I couldn't find a reference regarding from where the actor's family hailed, but I did find interesting information about a former Genovese acting boss murdered gangland style in 1972. (His brother disappeared a few years later.) I got the chills after finding a story that seems to substantiate a claim I'd heard from one of my sources. The source is from Manhattan's Greenwich Village and lived about one block away from the Tr"
