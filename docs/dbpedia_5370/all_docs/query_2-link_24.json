        "text": "All eight defendants in a dramatic 10-week racketeering trial were convicted yesterday of operating a ''commission'' that ruled the Mafia throughout the United States.\n\nThe Federal trial in Manhattan attained national significance as the first case to focus on the commission of top crime leaders, portrayed by the prosecution as ''the board of directors'' of the Mafia, or La Cosa Nostra.\n\n''The verdict reached today has resulted in dismantling the ruling council of La Cosa Nostra,'' the United States Attorney, Rudolph W. Giuliani, said in a statement issued by his office in Manhattan.\n\nLaw-enforcement authorities said the verdicts would make it easier to fight racketeering. The Government has recently been making a major assault on the mob, and since last year has brought Mafia cases in Kansas City, Boston, New Jersey and Philadelphia, among other places. [ Page B8. ] A Juror in Tears At 12:20 P.M. in a crowded, tensely quiet courtroom of Federal District Court, the jury announced its verdict on the sixth day of deliberations, convicting all the defendants of all the charges against them.\n\nThree defendants convicted as the bosses of crime families were Anthony (Fat Tony) Salerno of the Genovese group, Anthony (Tony Ducks) Corallo of the Lucchese group and Carmine (Junior) Persico of the Colombo group. Mr. Persico acted as his own lawyer. According to the 22-count indictment, the defendants conducted the affairs of ''the commission of La Cosa Nostra'' in a racketeering pattern that included murders, loan-sharking, labor payoffs and extensive extortion in the concrete industry in New York City.\n\nAs the guilty verdict was being announced, the defendants seemed stoic. But the jury's foreman brushed tears from her eyes after reading the long verdict, which took 20 minutes. Defense lawyers said the convictions would be appealed.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
