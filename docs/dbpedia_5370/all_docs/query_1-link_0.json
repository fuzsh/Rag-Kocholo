        "text": "Utterly ruthless, Carmine \"Lilo\" Galante became best known for masterminding the heroin trade and the grisly gangland execution that ended his reign.\n\nOn February 21, 1910, in an East Harlem tenement, one of the most notorious gangsters of the 20th century was born. Camillo Carmine Galante was the son of Sicilian immigrants from the seaside village of Castellammare del Golfo. He was destined to become a Mafia legend.\n\nCarmine Galante: ‘A Neuropathic, Psychopathic Personality’\n\nBorn Camillo Carmine Galante in East Harlem on February 21, 1910, he exhibited criminal tendencies that at age 10 landed him in reform school. As a teenager, he worked at multiple places including a floral shop, a trucking company, and on the waterfront as a stevedore and fish sorter.\n\nThese were just covers for his true calling as a Mafioso. Among the various charges ascribed to him were bootlegging, assault, robbery, extortion, gambling, and murder.\n\nGalante’s first notable alleged murder occurred on March 15, 1930, for slaying a police officer during a payroll robbery. Galante was not prosecuted for lack of evidence. Then, that Christmas Eve, he and other gang members attempted to hijack a truck and found themselves in a shootout with police. Galante accidentally wounded a six-year-old girl.\n\nCarmine Galante did time at Sing Sing Prison where a psychiatrist evaluated him in 1931. According to his FBI dossier:\n\n“He had a mental age of 14 ½ and an IQ of 90. He…had no knowledge of current events, routine holidays, or other items of common knowledge. He was diagnosed as a neuropathic, psychopathic personality, emotionally dull and indifferent with prognosis as being poor.”\n\nThe examiner also noted that Galante showed early signs of gonorrhea."
