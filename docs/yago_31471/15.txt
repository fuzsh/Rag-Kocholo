Electronic Arts (EA), American developer and manufacturer of video games for personal computers (PCs), video game consoles, and mobile devices. Established in 1982 by William M. (“Trip”) Hawkins, Electronic Arts (EA) has a product line that includes the popular franchises The Sims, EA SPORTS FC, Command & Conquer, Apex Legends, Battlefield, Mass Effect, and Madden NFL. The company is headquartered in Redwood City, California.

Hawkins had been employed by Apple but left in 1982 to found Amazin’ Software, which was renamed Electronic Arts later that year. One of EA’s unique features was the amount of recognition it gave to game designers, placing their names in large type on some game covers, similar to novel or album cover designs.
