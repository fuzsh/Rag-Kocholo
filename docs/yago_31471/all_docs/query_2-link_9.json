However, as of my last update, here are some EA franchises that, based on their current status or lack of recent activity, seem unlikely to receive future installments:\n\nCommand & Conquer\n\nThe franchise experienced a notable cancellation with “Command & Conquer: Generals 2,” which was repurposed into a free-to-play game, “Command & Conquer,” before ultimately being cancelled in 2013.\n\nStar Wars: Battlefront\n\nA third installment in the original “Star Wars: Battlefront” series was in development but got cancelled. EA later revived the franchise with its own version of “Star Wars: Battlefront” in 2015.\n\nSimCity\n\nAfter the problematic launch of “SimCity” in 2013 and the eventual closure of Maxis Emeryville, the future of the “SimCity” franchise became uncertain, with no new titles announced.\n\nProject Ragtag\n\nA Star Wars action-adventure game developed by Visceral Games under the code name “Project Ragtag” was cancelled when EA shut down the studio in 2017.\n\nThe Sims Online\n\nWhile not a complete cancellation of the franchise, “The Sims Online” was a significant departure that ultimately did not succeed, leading to its closure and rebranding as “EA Land,” which also eventually shut down.\n\nMedal of Honor\n\nThe “Medal of Honor” series has been put on indefinite hold following the poor reception of “Medal of Honor: Warfighter,” with no new titles announced, effectively cancelling the continuation of the series.\n\nNBA Live\n\nThe “NBA Live” series has faced multiple cancellations and delays, with several iterations, such as “NBA Live 21,” being cancelled as EA struggled to compete with 2K Sports’ “NBA 2K” series.\n\nIt’s important to note that the video game industry is prone to changes, and dormant franchises can be revived if there is enough interest from both the publisher and the gaming community.\n\nFAQ"
