        "text": "Company\n\nC\n\nElectronic Arts [Edit] [Talk]\n\nElectronic Arts, Inc. (EA) is an American video game developer and publisher. It was founded by Trip Hawkins. They are best known for their hit titles such as the Madden NFL series, The Sims, the Medal of Honor series, the Command & Conquer series, the FIFA series, the Rock Band series, and various other titles.\n\nHawkins recalled that American publishers \"avoided\" the NES.[1] Bing Gordon, a former EA CCO, recalled that Nintendo's original licensing agreement required EA to purchase a development kit for a \"ridiculous price\" and that when a game was finished, Nintendo would decide whether or not the game could be manufactured.[2]\n\nStudios and divisions[]\n\nThe company holds numerous subsidiaries around the world. The following are the console/PC studios:\n\nBioWare\n\nCriterion Games\n\nEA Canada\n\nEA DICE\n\nEA Montreal\n\nEA Motive\n\nEA Tiburon\n\nGhost Games\n\nThe Sims Studio\n\nPopCap Games\n\nRespawn Entertainment\n\nFormer Subsidiaries[]\n\nEA Black Box (Several members would later form Next Level Games)\n\nEA Bright Light (formerly EA UK)\n\nEA Los Angeles (formerly DreamWorks Interactive)\n\nEA Salt Lake\n\nMaxis (Studio folded into the mobile studios)\n\nPandemic Studios\n\nWestwood Studios (former Virgin Interactive, folded into EA Los Angeles)\n\nVisceral Games\n\nEA Sports[]\n\nEA Sports is a brand of EA that is used on their sports video games. This includes the FIFA, the Madden, and the NHL game franchises. EA also used a similar label, EA Sports BIG, for certain sports titles.\n\nEA Partners & EA Originals[]\n\nThe EA Partners program was a co-publishing program where third-party developers would make games that EA would market and publish. Several original games from the mid 2000s to around 2014 would be made under this deal including the Rock Band series. The program ended after several series underperformed.\n\nIn 2016, the EA Originals program initiated after their success with Unravel. This program would publish indie titles\n\nGames[]\n\nThis is a list of games Electronic Arts has published and/or developed for Nintendo platforms.\n\nNES[]\n\nSkate or Die 2: The Search for Double Trouble (1990)\n\nThe Immortal (1990)\n\nGame Boy[]\n\nSkate or Die: Tour de Thrash (1991)\n\nJordan vs Bird: One on One (1992)\n\nSNES[]\n\nBulls vs Blazers and the NBA Playoffs (1992)\n\nDesert Strike: Return to the Gulf (1992)\n\nNHLPA Hockey 93 (1992)\n\nMadden NFL '94 (1993)\n\nNHL '94 (1993)\n\nNHL 95 (1994)\n\nFIFA Soccer 96 (1995)\n\nJungle Strike (1995)\n\nNHL 96 (1995)\n\nFIFA Soccer 97 (1996)\n\nNHL 97 (1996)\n\nFIFA: Road to World Cup 98 (1998)\n\nNintendo 64[]\n\nFIFA Soccer 64 (1997)\n\nFIFA: Road to World Cup 98 (1997)\n\nFIFA 99 (1998)\n\nMadden NFL 99 (1998)\n\nWorld Cup 98 (1998)\n\nBeetle Adventure Racing!
