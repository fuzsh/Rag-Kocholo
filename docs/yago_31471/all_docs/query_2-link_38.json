        "text": "Play to Learn\n\nOur digital learning program, Play to Learn, offers online gaming and engaging simulations for middle and high school students to engage them on a number of STEAM topics and reinforces real-world application while getting students interested and excited in new career fields. Co-designed with educational technology company EVERFI, and delivered in partnership with non-profit Digital Schoolhouse and games industry organization Ukie, the program reached 15,500 students in North America and the UK last year and helped increase their assessment scores by 77%.\n\nEA Madden Scholarship Program\n\nHonoring the legacy of John Madden, we committed $2.5M to The EA Madden Scholarship Program which awards 24 annual, renewable scholarships with Historically Black College and University partners and UNCF, a non-profit that supports underrepresented students in pursuit of a college education. In FY23, scholars also received career readiness counseling, mentoring, access to UNCF conferences, recruiting events, and consideration for internships and new graduate roles at Electronic Arts.\n\nAn additional $2.5 million over 5 years was committed to four non-profit organizations focused on STEAM education as part of the Madden Educational Legacy Fund:\n\nCollege Track\n\nMission Bit\n\nStreetCode Academy\n\nGirls Who Code\n\nOur People Give Back and Create Impact\n\nWe have a bias for action at Electronic Arts, and provide our people with a variety of opportunities to give back to their communities and the organizations that they are passionate about, including:\n\n100% match to any full-time employee’s donation to a charitable organization, up to $5,000 USD (or equivalent.)\n\nEight hours of paid volunteer time off each year to qualified employees.\n\nA $1,000 USD donation to a nonprofit of choice (up to $2,000 every fiscal year), where an employee has logged 40 volunteer hours over the course of the year.\n\nGiving Through Our Games\n\nWe amplify our impact to society through the positive power of play. In partnership with our game influencers, we engage our player communities to give back to important causes. In FY23, the Apex Legends team engaged influencer Post Malone to host “Gaming For Love” a 4-day charity live stream. Over $200K was raised to benefit Human Rights Watch, Trevor Project, United Way and Project Hope."
