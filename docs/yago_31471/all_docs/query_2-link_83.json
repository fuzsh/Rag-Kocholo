        "text": "Amazon is not expected to make an offer to acquire Electronic Arts , sources told CNBC's David Faber on Friday.\n\nEA shares closed up 3.5% on Friday after USA Today reported Amazon would announce Friday that it plans to bid for the video game publisher, which is known for hit titles including FIFA, Madden and Apex Legends.\n\nFaber dismissed the report on CNBC's Squawk Box. \"There's nothing going on,\" he said, citing sources.\n\nAn Amazon spokesperson said the company doesn't comment on rumors or speculation. An EA spokesperson declined to comment.\n\nIf Amazon were to pursue EA in earnest, it could help shore up the retail behemoth's gaming presence. Amazon already owns Twitch, a streaming service popular among gamers, has launched its own cloud gaming service, called Luna, and it offers gaming perks as part of its Prime loyalty program.\n\nAmazon has been busy on the M&A front. Earlier this month, Amazon said it plans to acquire iRobot , best known for its robotic vacuum Roomba, for $1.7 billion. The announcement came just two weeks after it said it would buy boutique primary-care chain One Medical for $3.9 billion."
