        "text": "Former Apple Employee, Trip Hawkins founded EA in 1982. But Trip wasn’t just any employee at Apple, he was the Director of Product Marketing. Originally, the organization was called Amazin’ Software and initially survived due to considerable private investment from outside.\n\nElectronic Arts, or EA, is a video game publishing company known for putting out some of the most well-regarded games in the industry’s history. EA’s legacy stretches back to the early 1980s, but the publisher didn’t truly enter the public conscience until it started the Madden series of football games in 1988 — a series that continues to release new titles to this day.\n\nSince then, EA has been the publisher behind critically acclaimed series like Mass Effect, Dragon Age, Battlefield, and more. And, keeping with its continued release of new Madden NFL games every year, EA publishes other annualized sports titles under its EA Sports brand.\n\nBut lately, it has not been a smooth ride for them. EA is often portrayed as one of gaming’s biggest villains.\n\nIn April 2012, Consumerist awarded EA with the title of “Worst Company in America”. The record-breaking poll drew in more than 250,000 votes and saw EA beating out such regulars as AT&T and Walmart. The final round of voting pitted EA against Bank of America. EA won with 50,575 votes or 64.03%. To make matters worse EA won the infamous title consecutively for the second year.\n\nSo what makes Electronic Arts so hated?\n\n(Side note: This is just an article showcasing facts based on statistics and doesn’t intend any personal agenda)\n\nSome of the key reasons are:\n\nKILLING OF SMALL DEVELOPERS\n\nLarge companies buy smaller ones, and while we may not like it, that’s pure capitalism. Electronic Arts started to acquire other studios back in 1987, but many haven’t survived for long. The problem was always the same, as EA would be pushing them to produce numerous sequels in a short time. That resulted in poor games that sold miserably, so the company had an excuse to shut down studios.\n\nSome of the famous names in the list of companies that fell prey to EA’s jinx are:\n\nBullfrog Productions (1987–2001), famous for their ‘Dungeon Keeper’ series.\n\nWestwood Studios (1985–2003) — ‘Command & Conquer’ series\n\nOrigin Systems (1983–2004) — Ultima series, with Ultima Online being often credited with popularizing and laying the groundwork for massively multiplayer online role-playing games. Ultima Online won eight world records in the Guinness World Records: Gamer’s Edition 2008 including “First MMORPG to reach 100,000 players” and “Longest running MMORPG.”\n\nDreamWorks Interactive (1995–2013) — ‘Medal Of Honor’ series\n\nLOOT CASES\n\nThe company loves micro transactions. Even in popular game franchises such as FIFA, the players need to play in real cash to unlock certain features or players.\n\nBut things went downhill with Star Wars: Battlefront.\n\nEA committed a cardinal sin in the gaming world by working “pay-to-win” elements into these microtransactions, enabling players to spend real-world dollars to get ahead of others. The backlash was swift in the Battlefront community, and the more EA tried to explain its approach, the more angry fans became.\n\nOn top of all that, the loot boxes were randomly generated, and paying for them with real money didn’t guarantee the inclusion of any specific character. Players caught on to EA’s greed, and when the company took to Reddit to defend its monetization system, their explanation became the most downvoted comment in the history of the website.\n\nEXCLUSIVITY\n\nOn June 5, 2008, a lawsuit was filed in Oakland, California alleging Electronic Arts is breaking United States antitrust laws by signing exclusive contracts with the NFL Players Association, the NCAA and Arena Football League, to use players’ names, likenesses and team logos. This keeps other companies from being able to sign the same agreements. The suit further accuses EA of raising the price of games associated with these licenses as a result of this action.\n\nEA also made exclusivity deals with some companies like Porsche, meaning that their models could be featured only in Need For Speed games.\n\nThis ultimately results in a lack of innovation and pointless sequels.\n\nThere are many others too depending upon one’s experience but these tend to be the common-sighted reasons for the hatred.\n\nSO HOW DOES EA MANAGES TO STAY IN BUSINESS:\n\nThe company initially built its reputation through groundbreaking PC games which established its legacy in the gaming community.\n\nEven in recent times, the throne of sports games has EA sitting on it. EA Sports are the makers of FIFA, NHL, Madden and NBA franchises. FIFA 18 alone sold over 24 million units, making it EA’s best-selling title to date.\n\nSports franchises are incredibly popular. They appeal to numerous casual gamers who don’t care about the similarity of the games or the number of microtransactions. Many sports game fans simply want to put on the game, play a few matches, then turn it off and carry on with their lives.\n\nMoreover, the company itself is trying to improve. Their reputation of being too harsh to the employees and setting unrealistic deadlines is slowly fading away.\n\nThe simple secret to EA’s success is in the figures. The EA Sports franchise has over 90 million active players, The Sims has 80 million and Battlefield has 54 million. Those are huge figures and it’s this loyal player base who helps EA continue to grow.\n\nWhile EA owns so many well-designed and popular franchises it will remain firmly towards the top of the games studio pile, currently falling behind only Activision Blizzard in terms of size, scale and sales.\n\nAfter all, ‘It’s In The Game’."
