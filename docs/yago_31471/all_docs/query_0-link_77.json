        "text": "Synopsis\n\nThe founder of Electronic Arts will join as co-founder and security chief of Games for a Living (GFAL).\n\nFormer Apple executive Trip Hawkins, who founded the company behind the best-selling sports videogame franchise \"FIFA\", is joining a Web3 startup, looking to take on top blockchain games like Axie Infinity.\n\nThe founder of Electronic Arts will join as co-founder and security chief of Games for a Living (GFAL), Hawkins told Reuters in an interview.\n\nGFAL publishes titles compatible with blockchain technology across consoles, personal computers and smartphones - commonly called Web3.\n\nInterest for Web3 gaming has risen over the past year as it is touted to attract more cryptocurrency users. Players can own, sell, and trade in-game goods in such games.\n\nHong Kong-based blockchain gaming developer Animoca Brands, which backs popular NFT game Axie Infinity, raised more than $500 million in 2022.\n\n\"Web3 is the bridge to the metaverse,\" Hawkins said on Thursday. \"And if we're going to make a metaverse, the economy of the metaverse has to be more like the real world.\"\n\nDiscover the stories of your interest\n\nBlockchain\n\n5 Stories\n\nCyber-safety\n\n7 Stories\n\nFintech\n\n9 Stories\n\nE-comm\n\n9 Stories\n\nML\n\n8 Stories\n\nEdtech\n\n6 Stories\n\nAlthough there are concerns around security as \"cyberwallets\" are more prone to hacking, developers are also looking to diversify their platforms amid stunted growth and high app-store fees.\n\nFounded in 2021 by former King executive Manel Sort, Barcelona-based GFAL had a post-money valuation of 13.2 million euros ($13.96 million) after its latest funding round last year.\n\nNot TCS. Not HDFC. 3 stocks that beat all benchmarks and peers in the last 20 years.\n\nDid Google fall behind in the AI race because of WFH? Patent filings tell a different story.\n\nThe forces at play slicing India’s big family business conglomerates\n\nIndian car buyers are holding their horses on EVs and buying this instead\n\nChange of heart at RBI? Can banks look forward to new lines of business?\n\nMpox virus is back. Are India’s vaccine makers Serum Institute, Bharat Biotech ready?\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3"
