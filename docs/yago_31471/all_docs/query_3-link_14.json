        "text": "This article is about the video game company often known as \"EA.\".\n\nYou may be looking for Ea, the primary star of the Geonosis system.\n\nElectronic Arts (EA) is an American developer, marketer, publisher, and distributor of computer and video games established in 1982 by Trip Hawkins. EA grew from a home-computing game publisher; in 1987 they began developing games in-house. In the early 1990s, EA began to develop games for consoles. EA has bought various successful developers and since the early 2000s has been one of the largest third-party publishers.\n\nEA is known for various series and labels including EA Sports, Need for Speed, Medal of Honor, Plants vs. Zombies, The Sims, Command & Conquer and the later games in the Burnout series. Many notable and popular games have been published through EA.\n\nHistory[]\n\nOn October 11, 2007, Electronic Arts announced they had purchased BioWare, the developer of Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic, as well as Pandemic Studios, the developer of Star Wars: Battlefront.[4] On May 6, 2013, Disney and EA jointly announced that EA would hold exclusive rights to make Star Wars video games for the next several years.[5] New games would be developed across several of their studios, including Star Wars Battlefront by DICE[3] and Project Ragtag by Visceral Games. Additionally, Star Wars: The Old Republic would be continually maintained under the agreement, with frequent content updates and expansion pack releases.\n\nIn addition to creating original Star Wars games with the license, Electronic Arts has the ability to add Star Wars–themed content to their other products. The first product to include Star Wars–branded content was The Sims 4, releasing costumes of Princess Leia, Yoda, Darth Vader, and a Rebel pilot on October 1, 2014,[6] along with costumes of Aayla Secura, Darth Maul, and Boba Fett on May 4, 2015.\n\nOn January 25, 2022, it was announced that three new EA games were in development under the supervision of Respawn Entertainment: a sequel to Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order titled Star Wars Jedi: Survivor, a strategy game, and a first-person shooter game.[7] On February 28, 2024, it was announced that the first-person shooter project was canceled.[8]\n\nGames[]\n\nYear Title Development studio 2011 Star Wars: The Old Republic BioWare 2013 Star Wars: The Old Republic: Rise of the Hutt Cartel BioWare 2013 Star Wars: The Old Republic: Galactic Starfighter BioWare 2014 Star Wars: The Old Republic: Galactic Strongholds BioWare 2014 Star Wars: The Old Republic: Shadow of Revan BioWare 2015 Star Wars: The Old Republic: Knights of the Fallen Empire BioWare 2015 Star Wars Battlefront DICE 2015 Star Wars: Galaxy of Heroes EA Capital Games 2016 Star Wars: The Old Republic: Knights of the Eternal Throne BioWare 2017 Star Wars Battlefront II DICE, Motive Studios, Criterion Games 2019 Star Wars: The Old Republic: Onslaught BioWare 2019 Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order Respawn Entertainment 2020 The Sims 4 Star Wars: Journey to Batuu Maxis 2020 Star Wars: Squadrons Motive Studios 2022 Star Wars: The Old Republic: Legacy of the Sith BioWare 2023 Star Wars Jedi: Survivor Respawn Entertainment[9] TBA Untitled strategy game Respawn Entertainment, Bit Reactor[7] Status unknown Star Wars: Rise to Power Canceled Project Ragtag Visceral Games, Motive Studios, EA Vancouver Canceled[8] Untitled first-person shooter game Respawn Entertainment[7]\n\nSources[]\n\n\"Launchpad\" — Star Wars Insider 217\n\nNotes and references[]\n\n[]\n\nElectronic Arts on Wikipedia"
