        "text": "Leaders of Games for a Living\n\nAs crypto dominance continues with well-known figures coming from the video game industry, another big name has recently been added to this list - Trip Hawkins, who is the original founder and former CEO of Electronic Arts (EA), a major player in the video game industry.\n\nHawkins has been revealed as the co-founder and chief strategy officer of Games for a Living, a startup that is working on developing games that will use NFTs and blockchain-based tokens. Manel Sort, the former first vice president at King, the developer of Candy Crush Saga, is a co-founder of Games for a Living along with Trip Hawkins. The two industry veterans have worked together in the past at Digital Chocolate, Hawkins' previous mobile gaming startup.\n\nDetails of Games for a Living\n\nTrip Hawkins expressed confidence in blockchain technology and his company's vision to create a new gaming experience that benefits players and enhances game performance. The first game released by Games for a Living, Elemental Raiders, is currently available on Steam without tokenized elements, although promotional Ethereum NFTs related to the game have been launched in the past.\n\nThe company will release an NFT \"battle pass\" in March, along with its GFAL token. An official tournament for Elemental Raiders is scheduled for early March and will offer NFT and token rewards, but this will not be available on the Steam version of the game. Games for a Living has also teased a second game called Diamond Dreams, which is expected to be an NFT-based matching puzzle game.\n\nThe publisher's whitepaper outlines plans to eventually use its own private blockchain for games rather than an open, permissionless network like Ethereum or Solana. The company intends to establish a foundation to oversee the blockchain network and set the rules for other developers who can deploy their own NFT-driven games on the network."
