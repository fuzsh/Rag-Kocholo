        "text": "This article is more than 4 years old.\n\nElectronic Arts generates its revenue from sales of video games and in-game purchases. Its largest segment is Services, which accounted for 68% of total revenues in fiscal 2019. In this note we discuss Electronic Arts’ business model, its revenue segments, sales trends, and forecast. You can look at our interactive dashboard analysis ~ EA Revenues: How Does Electronic Arts Make Money? ~ for more details. In addition, you can see more of our Information Technology data here.\n\nServices Is The Bigger Segment For Electronic Arts\n\nElectronic Arts generates its revenues from two sources ~ Products and Services.\n\nProduct refers to revenue generated from the sale of gaming titles such as FIFA, Madden, and others. The segment accounted for 32% of the company’s total sales in fiscal 2019.\n\nServices represents the revenue from downloadable content, subscriptions, and other services that are generally accessed in-game. The segment’s contribution to the company’s overall revenues was 68% in fiscal 2019.\n\nElectronic Arts Business Model\n\nWhat Need Does Electronic Arts Serve?\n\nElectronic Arts is engaged primarily in developing and distributing games for video game consoles, personal computers, mobile phones, and the Internet.\n\nElectronic Arts creates popular sports games such as FIFA, Madden NFL, and NHL, along with games based on popular movies such as Harry Potter, and games from long-running franchises such as Need for Speed and The Sims, among others.\n\nWho Pays To Electronic Arts?\n\nHardcore as well as casual gamers pay for the games and in-game purchases to Electronic Arts.\n\nWhat Do Customers Care About?\n\nPrice\n\nGameplay\n\nGraphics\n\nStoryline\n\nWho Are Electronic Arts Competitors?\n\nOther gaming publishers such as Activision Blizzard, Take-Two Interactive, and Nintendo.\n\nElectronic Arts Derives More of Its Revenues Outside of America, While In Terms of Platform, Console Accounts For Most of The Sales.\n\nDetails about EA’s Revenue breakdown in terms of Region as well as Platform are available in our interactive dashboard.\n\nElectronic Arts’ Total Revenue Has Grown 10% Between Fiscal 2015 And Fiscal 2019, And It Could Grow By Another 20% By Fiscal 2020.\n\nElectronic Arts’ total revenues grew from $4.5 billion in fiscal 2015 to $5.0 billion in fiscal 2019.\n\nThis represents an average annual growth rate of 2.5%.\n\nWe forecast the revenues to be around $5.9 billion by fiscal 2022, reflecting an average annual growth rate of 5.9%.\n\nElectronic Arts Could See Steady Revenue Growth In The Coming Years, Led By Strong Growth In Services Business, Partly Offset By Continued Declines In Products Business.\n\nThe company has provided revenue guidance of $5.4 billion for fiscal 2020, which is slightly above our estimate of $5.1 billion.\n\nRevenue growth in the coming years will likely be led by its new titles, along with continued growth in e-sports franchises.\n\nApex Legend, which is one of the new games launched by the company, has already reached the milestone of 50 million players. This momentum could continue in the near term.\n\nNote that the $1 billion decline in Product sales in fiscal 2019 was due to the adoption of ASC 606 by the company. Operationally the segment sales were down only $382 million.\n\nWhat’s behind Trefis?
