        "text": "Electronic Arts turned 30 on May 28th, and I thought it would be a good opportunity to check in with its founder, Trip Hawkins, on how he feels about Electronic Arts today. It’s no secret that EA, while a massively successful company, takes a lot of heat from gamers on a number of issues (see this Retro Scan and its comments for more on that).\n\nIn an interview published at Edge Online, Hawkins and I spoke at length about Electronic Arts, including the founding of EA, finding early EA developers, his time at Apple, his friendship with Steve Jobs, and yes, how he feels about Electronic Arts today.\n\nThe resulting interview was so long that Edge decided to split it into five parts. It just published the last part today, so I thought I’d collect all the links here so you can read it.\n\n06/25/2012 “Trip Hawkins: The inspiration for EA” 06/26/2012 “Trip Hawkins on Apple and Steve Jobs” 06/27/2012 “Trip Hawkins: Founding Electronic Arts” 06/28/2012 “Trip Hawkins: The EA Days” 06/29/2012 “Trip Hawkins on the EA of today”\n\nInterestingly, there has been no mention of the company’s 30th anniversary from Electronic Arts itself. Its staff was probably too busy revising its own history to notice.\n\nTags: 1982, anniversaries, Apple, Edge, Electronic Arts, freelance work, interviews, revisionism, Steve Jobs, Trip Hawkins"
