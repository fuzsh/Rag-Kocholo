This time, however, an NFT gaming based company called ‘Games for a Living’.\n\nQuick Takes\n\nTrip Hawkins, who founded EA, has co-founded ‘Games for a Living’, where he will also be the Chief Strategy Officer.\n\n‘Games for a Living’ is focusing on NFT and blockchain-based games in which users can make money.\n\nHawkins has a vast range of experience in the gaming and tech industries, starting his career working at Apple.\n\nAbout Games for a Living\n\nGames for a Living has been co-founded by EA founder, Trip Hawkins, alongside Manel Sort, former VP at King – who produced the hugely popular video game Candy Crush Saga.\n\nThe first game that the new company are releasing is ‘Elemental Raiders’, which is currently available on Steam – although without NFT and blockchain elements. In March, you can expect to see an Elemental Raiders tournament, not on Steam, that will include NFT-related prizes. ‘Diamond Dreams’ is the title of the teased second game.\n\nThe company will mainly have their NFTs, tokens, and other materials on the BNB chain, with a limited amount of them being on Ethereum. Eventually, according to their whitepaper, they will bridge all assets onto their own chain.\n\nOn the whitepaper, they clarified their goals. “Games for a living is revolutionizing the Web3 gaming industry with our innovative approach that resolves the current business model issues. We are aiming to make Web3 gaming the mainstream form of gaming, just like free-to-play games disrupted the video games industry more than a decade ago.”\n\nTrip Hawkins’ Career So Far\n\nTrip Hawkins is an American entrepreneur and a well-known figure in the video game industry. He co-founded video game companies like Electronic Arts (EA) and 3DO, which both initially became prominent in the gaming world during the 1980s and 1990s.\n\nThroughout his career, Hawkins has been instrumental in bringing together technology and entertainment, and his work has contributed significantly to the growth and evolution of the gaming industry. He is known for his innovative ideas and his focus on the potential of interactive media to revolutionize the way people learn, work, and play.\n\nInterestingly, thanks to his input in the industry, Hawkins received a spot in the Video Game Hall of Fame in 2018."
