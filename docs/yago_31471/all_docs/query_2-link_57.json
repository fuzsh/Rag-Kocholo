        "text": "U.S.-based video game giant Electronic Arts (NASDAQ: EA) enters into an agreement to acquire U.S.-based mobile game developer Glu Mobile (NASDAQ: GLUU) for $2.1B in enterprise value and equity value of $2.4B, including a ~$364m net cash on the balance\n\nThe price consists of a 36% premium to Glu Mobile share price of $9.19 on February 5, 2021, which is about $12.5 in cash for each ordinary share\n\nThe total transaction is planned to be financed by EA’s cash on hand\n\nBased on Glu Mobile financial performance (Revenue of $540.5m and EBITDA of $29.5m FY 2020), the transaction multiplies are 3.9x EV/Revenue and 71.2x EV/EBITDA (or 24.2x EV/ adj. EBITDA)\n\nThe acquisition is expected to be finished in the Q2’21\n\nEA further expands into the mobile space with the acquisition of Glu’s diversified portfolio across sports, RPG, lifestyle, casual, and mid-core genres\n\nThough Electronic Arts is primarily known for its PC&console activity, many of its sports titles have their mobile versions. Moreover, EA’s mobile sports games four-year CAGR is 24%, which is notably higher than that of PC&console sports games (13%)\n\nA huge team of 780 employees on board will significantly increase EA’s mobile game development expertise, especially its products scaling capabilities\n\nGlu Mobile’s portfolio seems to perfectly fit EA’s range of lifestyle and sports titles:\n\nSuch games as Design Home, Covet Fashion, and Kim Kardashian: Hollywood will complement The Sims mobile\n\nTap Sports Baseball, Deer Hunter, and Tap Sports Fishing will be a great add-on to EA’s vast portfolio of spots titles, including FIFA, Madden NFL, NHL, NBA, and UFC\n\nRevenue from PC&console premium games publishing is tied closely to the new product releases. That is why the expansion into the mobile F2P space can help EA to stabilize its financials\n\nFounded in 2001, Glu has first made its name as a publisher of mobile premium games, made for old mobile phone models, characterized by the slow network, phone keypad controls, and single-player games\n\nIn 2007, Glu mobile went public and shortly reached $14+ price per share, which remains one of the highest Glu share price levels up to date. After not meeting the market expectations, the price dropped\n\nIn the following years, the market started its shift towards F2P smartphone games, characterized by a different monetization system, multiplayer focus, switch from keyboards to touchscreen and accelerometer, as well as a whole new technical level of games. This led Glu Mobile to search for new ways of doing its business\n\nIn 2011, Glu Mobile laid a foundation for its acquisition strategy, buying Blammo Games, which would later be known for Kim Kardashian: Hollywood casual game. During the next several years, Glu mobile made several deals, acquiring one popular IP Deer Hunter (2012), and three studios, that would become crucial for Glu’s inorganic growth: Pick 6 Studios (2013), PlayFirst (2013), and Crowdstar (2016)\n\nBased on Capital IQ consensus financials forecast, forward multiples are 18.7x EV/EBITDA’21 and 14.4x EV/EBITDA’22 (or 10.2x EV/adj. EBITDA’22)\n\nA few months ago, Electronic Arts announced the acquisition of UK-based racing games developer Codemasters Group (LON: CDM) for a total consideration of $1.2B. This means, in 2021, EA will have to integrate two large businesses into its ecosystem. So there’s a high possibility that it will take some time before the synergy effect will finally take place\n\nIn 2011, EA acquired PopCap Games, a developer behind popular indie title Plants vs Zombies, for up to $1.3B. However, now we can see that neither the franchise nor the company, manage to significantly contribute to EA’s performance"
