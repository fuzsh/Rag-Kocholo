        "text": "Driving the Creative Economy in Interactive Media\n\nRanked nationally as the No. 1 graduate game design program and the No. 14 undergraduate game design program by The Princeton Review and PC Gamer magazine, UCF prepares students for work well before they leave the classroom — teaching the most advanced game-design skills and providing the knowledge top employers look for. And with premier digital media and entertainment companies right in our backyard, UCF graduates are helping reshape the way people consume technology and interact with the world.\n\nThe Future of Gaming is Here\n\nHome to some of the nation’s largest animation, film and gaming companies, Central Florida has become a playground beyond just theme parks. It is now a major player in the multibillion-dollar gaming industry — expected to generate $196 billion in revenue by 2022. People from across the U.S. and globe come here to study at the best schools for video game design or fulfill their dream of working for leaders in the digital arts and entertainment industry. With an expected job growth of four percent through 2028, the demand for animators, filmmakers and visual artists will continue to climb. The rapidly growing market has tech giants pushing boundaries and launching new products to cash in on the billions of gamers worldwide. From smart devices to gaming consoles and desktops, a world of opportunities awaits at your fingertips.\n\nUCF’s digital arts and entertainment programs give students the opportunity to hone their expressive work across web and social platforms, ranging from video games, mobile applications and websites to virtual and augmented reality experiments.\n\nAt the Communication and Media building, students collaborate on innovative projects across 112,000 square feet of high-tech studio and classroom space, including Studio 500, one of the largest motion capture studios and soundstages on the east coast, as well as Oculus Rift dev kits and AR/VR labs to experiment the latest tech. And through UCF’s new MFA in Themed Experiences — among the first of its kind, students can make the most of living in the epicenter of the theme park industry.\n\nOur digital arts and entertainment programs provide a solid foundation in techniques and theory. From character animation to interactive entertainment to film, every student gets hands-on experience with each specialty to help push innovation forward. Their work is where art, storytelling and technology intersect — merging the digital world with the physical one and providing an unparalleled user experience. Going beyond gaming and entertainment, students can tailor their work to a number of industries, including education, advertising, healthcare, and modeling and simulation.\n\nFor FIEA graduates, sometimes the next step after completing their degree is starting something of their own. And to help them launch into their new adventure, FIEA Ventures provides the space needed to to reach the next level. With a place to call home, these new business owners can focus on getting their product or service in front of potential investors and customers.\n\nSpread across 5,000 square feet at the Communication and Media building in downtown Orlando, startups have access to an office and meeting space, a 20-seat theater, the Mocap studio, mentorships, equipment and the latest technology. The creative environment has been used to work on video games, animated film, simulation, and mobile and web products. Providing the tools and expertise necessary to start on the path to success, companies and individuals can call FIEA Ventures home for two years as they work on refining their concepts, market prospects, business plans, as well as establishing relationships with industry partners.\n\nUCF understands the power of working together. By collaborating with partners and affiliates from around the community, we can continue producing top-tier games and interactive media. In 2005, the City of Orlando, the State of Florida, the Economic Development Commission and others joined forces to form the Florida Interactive Entertainment Academy (FIEA) at UCF. Since then, the university has formed relationships with companies across Central Florida — helping grow the regional economy and create a lasting impact for future generations.\n\nToday, in the heart of the city, UCF Downtown is a vibrant campus that will soon be steps away from Electronic Arts, a video game company that plans to relocate its headquarters to downtown Orlando. The move will help provide a pipeline for students interested in internships and career opportunities with a top industry employer."
