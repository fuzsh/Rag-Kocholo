        "text": "Talk to Trip Hawkins for more than a few moments about Digital Chocolate’s efforts on Facebook, and he’ll be sure to tell you that his company has been the fastest-growing social game developer this year. That assertion comes with a few qualifiers — mainly that Digital Chocolate is still far smaller than competitors that started earlier, so it’s easier to have a higher growth rate — but it’s true enough to get the point across.\n\nThe point, of course, is that Hawkins considers Digital Chocolate a viable contender to become one of the top five social gaming companies."
