        "text": "Electronic Arts Square KK (EA Square) was established in May 1998 as the publisher for interactive entertainment titles created by Electronic Arts with exclusive publishing rights in Japan. This was an exchange between EA and Square to promote each other's titles, which were blockbusters at home but had difficulty achieving market penetration abroad. As Square established itself in America and EA found footing in Japan, the partnership dissolved to give each company back its autonomy.\n\nThis was one of the two new joint ventures created between industry leaders Square and Electronic Arts. In North America, Square Electronic Arts LLC (Square EA) was established and based in Coasta Mesa, California.\n\nElectronic Arts Square KK was also responsible for the development of the PS2 title, X-Squad."
