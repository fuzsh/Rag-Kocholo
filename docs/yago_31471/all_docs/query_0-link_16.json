        "text": "Trip played a key role in defining and building two major industries: personal computers and video games. A leading contributor to 4 IPOs, he founded and led the first decade of Electronic Arts, today worth $40 Billion, while driving the creative and product vision for EA Sports. In addition to founding and leading four game companies that raised venture capital, he spent three years working with world leading experts to design and publish an advanced EQ game that teaches children the principles and practices of emotional intelligence.\n\nOften called a legend, Trip is an expert on leadership, strategy, innovation, entrepreneurship, teamwork, company culture and practices in emotional intelligence.\n\nAs a result of defining, establishing and leading in the creative and business practices of entertainment software, Hawkins, his products and companies have won hundreds of awards and he has personally won several Entrepreneur of the Year, Lifetime Achievement and Hall of Fame awards, and is the only business executive enshrined in the game industry hall of fame.\n\nFinding celebrity and business acclaim early, Trip has been featured in every major media outlet. This includes the rare distinction as one of People Magazine’s “50 Most Beautiful People” while also being crowned “King of the Nerds” by The Economist.\n\nI’m a lifelong learner and love helping people that have a growth mindset. I had dozens of students that are legitimate human jewels, and it was an honor to help them polish some of their facets. Many of them said my course was the best one they’d ever had in their lives. Quite a few have stayed in touch with me and I’ve helped them with their careers and businesses. I just bought a few shirts from a fashion e-commerce entrepreneur that moved back home to Costa Rica.\n\nAn expert on leadership, strategy, innovation, entrepreneurship, and practices in emotional intelligence, Trip played a key role in defining and building two major industries: personal computers and video games. Currently, Trip spends much of his time mentoring other entrepreneurs and businesses at start-ups, in addition to his impressive career as an international speaker. He encourages others to disrupt themselves, to innovate for the betterment of the planet and to develop leadership and team management skills.\n\nTo find out more about Trip Hawkins or to book him please contact Steve Cummins.\n\n+376 735 154 | steve@csaspeakers.com"
