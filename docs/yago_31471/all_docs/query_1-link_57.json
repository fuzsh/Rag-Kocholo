        "text": "Game industry legend Trip Hawkins, who founded Electronic Arts and 3DO, will be inagurated into the AIAS Hall of Fame, according to an announcement today by the Academy of Interactive Arts & Sciences.\n\nHawkins joins industry giants such as Yu Suzuki, Peter Molyneaux, John Carmack, Will Wright, Hironobu Sakaguchi, Sid Meier, and Shigeru Miyamoto.\n\nThe AIAS Hall of Fame Award recognizes \"a person that has made a significant impact or contribution to the industry,\" whether in genre innovation, technological achievement, creativity, or influence. This year's award will be presented at the 8th Annual Interactive Achievement Awards ceremony in Las Vegas tomorrow, part of this year's D.I.C.E. Summit.\n\n\"It is an incredible honor to be recognized by my distinguished peers in the industry,\" said Hawkins. \"It is a great privilege to join the industry's greatest luminaries and be one of few to be named an AIAS Hall of Fame inductee. I love this industry and am not finished pushing its boundaries.\"\n\nHawkins started his professional career at Apple, where he helped the company grow from $2 million in revenue to $1 billion in four years. In 1982, Hawkins incorporated Electronic Arts, where he developed some of the first sports video games, and nabbed coach John Madden in a deal which would make game history.\n\nAfter next leading the ill-fated 3DO through the 1990s, Hawkins is now busy with his latest company, Digital Chocolate, which focuses on mobile gaming."
