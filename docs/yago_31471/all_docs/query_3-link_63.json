        "text": "With a price-to-earnings (or \"P/E\") ratio of 31.5x Electronic Arts Inc. ( ) may be sending very bearish signals at the moment, given that almost half of all companies in the United States have P/E ratios under 16x and even P/E's lower than 9x are not unusual. However, the P/E might be quite high for a reason and it requires further investigation to determine if it's justified.\n\nRecent times have been pleasing for Electronic Arts as its earnings have risen in spite of the market's earnings going into reverse. It seems that many are expecting the company to continue defying the broader market adversity, which has increased investorsâ€™ willingness to pay up for the stock. If not, then existing shareholders might be a little nervous about the viability of the share price.\n\nKeen to find out how analysts think Electronic Arts' future stacks up against the industry? In that case, our .\n\nIs There Enough Growth For Electronic Arts?\n\nThe only time you'd be truly comfortable seeing a P/E as steep as Electronic Arts' is when the company's growth is on track to outshine the market decidedly.\n\nRetrospectively, the last year delivered a decent 6.8% gain to the company's bottom line. Although, the latest three year period in total hasn't been as good as it didn't manage to provide any growth at all. Therefore, it's fair to say that earnings growth has been inconsistent recently for the company.\n\nTurning to the outlook, the next three years should generate growth of 15% per year as estimated by the analysts watching the company. Meanwhile, the rest of the market is forecast to only expand by 11% per year, which is noticeably less attractive.\n\nIn light of this, it's understandable that Electronic Arts' P/E sits above the majority of other companies. Apparently shareholders aren't keen to offload something that is potentially eyeing a more prosperous future.\n\nWhat We Can Learn From Electronic Arts' P/E?\n\nIt's argued the price-to-earnings ratio is an inferior measure of value within certain industries, but it can be a powerful business sentiment indicator.\n\nWe've established that Electronic Arts maintains its high P/E on the strength of its forecast growth being higher than the wider market, as expected. Right now shareholders are comfortable with the P/E as they are quite confident future earnings aren't under threat. Unless these conditions change, they will continue to provide strong support to the share price.\n\nMany other vital risk factors can be found on the company's balance sheet. Take a look at our with six simple checks on some of these key factors.\n\nIf you're unsure about the strength of Electronic Arts' business, why not explore for some other companies you may have missed."
