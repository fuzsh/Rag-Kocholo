        "text": "Rensselaer's Ph.D. in Electronic Arts was established in 2007 to satisfy the increasing demand for a practice-based, interdisciplinary arts doctoral degree program within the university. It is designed to appeal to students who wish to pursue innovative research that integrates diverse media, performance, science-based and/or social practices, or curatorial studies into their artwork.\n\nThe Ph.D. in Electronic Arts is conferred for independent investigation representing an original contribution to knowledge, where knowledge is understood to incorporate an integrated combination of creative practice in the arts with theoretical and historical research.\n\nThe core of the curriculum focuses on a student's creative practice, which is informed by coursework, individual engagement with advisors, and culminates in a dissertation that is composed of the dissertation text and practice-based work.\n\nAdmission Considerations\n\nAdmission to the Ph.D. program is highly competitive and is based on the submission of a formal application package.\n\nThe applicant's prior academic records as well as references are examined for evidence of singular ability to meet the graduate standards and degree requirements of Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute.\n\nEvaluation for admission to the program includes not only artistic merit, but also evidence of a creative orientation that is research-based and appropriate for the type of in-depth interdisciplinary scholarly study the Ph.D. program will provide. Thus, the portfolio should be a representative sampling of work that best demonstrates creative practice as research-based and appropriate for an interdisciplinary Ph.D. program.\n\nAcceptable submissions include but are not limited to urls, DVDs, slides, artist books, CD-ROMs, video and audio recordings, music scores, etc. Candidates should anticipate the portfolio review to be completed in approximately 15 minutes and submit appropriately.\n\nRequired Materials:\n\nCompleted graduate application (online application required)\n\nNon-refundable application fee of $75\n\nStatement of Background and Goals\n\nResearch Proposal (up to 3 pages)\n\nPortfolio (online submission or URL preferred)\n\nResume or Curriculum Vitae\n\nScholarly Writing Sample (previous thesis or publication)\n\nOfficial transcripts and evidence of degrees earned, in English, of all post-secondary education\n\nTwo letters of recommendation\n\nOfficial TOEFL or IELTS scores, if applicable\n\nApplicants must submit the requested materials online in addition to sending hard copies of the required supporting credentials NOT submitted in the online application, together in one envelope, to Graduate Admissions (address below) by the application deadline of January 1st for fall entry."
