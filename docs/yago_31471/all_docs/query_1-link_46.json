        "text": "Here are Trip’s comments on his view of 3 big new innovations coming that could be the New High Score:\n\nE-sports\n\nGames as Social Media\n\nCloud Gaming\n\nQ&A With Trip Hawkins on The New High Score:\n\nJK: Trip you’ve been in the industry for a long time, when you look at some of the current innovations and some of the things happening in the market… And let’ say in 20 years or 30 years from now if they were making a New High Score for the current industry, what has the potential to become the next big innovation for the video games market?\n\nTrip:\n\n#1. eSports\n\nI think there’s a few of them. One marketplace that’s already really dynamic and active and growing, it’s certainly by annual business volume of over a billion dollars a year. That’s eSports. And it makes perfect sense to me because I have four children. I’ve watched how they’ve grown up around all of media and their connections with brands and game brands. It’s very different than mine. So when I was a kid, it was pretty easy to fall in love with traditional sports because that’s kind of all we had.\n\nAnd, some of my kids care about certain real sports, but their biggest brands are video games. And it makes perfect sense to me that video game fans would like to see the best players play the games that they love and to watch that kind of elite level of competition. So there’s obviously a huge broadcast audience and broadcast fee for that, led by Twitch and now many others. There’s quite a few conventional broadcasters that are involved. And then you have the audiences for the superstar streamers like Ninja and others like PewDiePie that post a lot of content on YouTube. These guys have like a hundred million or more followers. That’s a really exciting trend.\n\n#2. Games as Social Media\n\nAnd one of the ways I look at games that… Games have become a vertical market for social media platforms. I think that was a big change. Really encouraged more than anything by Fortnite. Basically looking at the shooter genre, where you’re supposed to kill people. And they instead say, well, we’re just going to turn it into a big party and we’re going to do dance moves and have emotes and that attracted, of course, a much larger audience.\n\nIt kind of reminds me when I was a kid, I was a big fan of James Bond and I thought that was what spies really did. I didn’t find out until much later that it’s a parody. And that’s how I think about Fortnite. It’s kind of a parody and everybody is having a lot of fun running around and a 10 foot tall pink bunny outfit or having a weapon that looks like a great white shark. I mean, it’s just they’re having a good time with it and they’re going into these games to meet up with their friends as squads. And again, that plays right into eSports. ESports is long term, it’ll be driven by games that involves squad play and team work and so on. So eSports is a big deal.\n\n#3. Cloud Gaming\n\nThere’s another really big theme that is kind of related because as an overall statement about technology today, the cloud is everything. We’ve already seen it in a number of examples of things that are fundamental services that we use every day that have moved to the cloud. But it’s going to become more and more and more of that and led by the Internet companies that are operating a lot of the back-end cloud services.\n\nAnd it’s a great thing for the game industry, because there are all these value added services now that as a game developer allow you to focus on the creativity around your game idea. And then bring in things like payment, cloud services, and your content data network and all of the other kinds of services… your 3D engine, you can basically outsource a lot of things. And it’s enabling all kinds of players all over the world to have a chance to play games earlier in life, having access to devices and screens, to fall in love with games as something they want to do for the rest of their lives. And for many of them to end up becoming professionals in the game industry or professional athletes in eSports. And that’s all going to get really big.\n\nBut as we talk about things going to the cloud, we are going to get to a point where you can have the hardware in the cloud do all the calculations about the game you’re playing and just have your joystick sending instructions to the cloud, as your opponents are also doing, and basically be cloud streaming the game. And then you don’t actually have to buy customized hardware and you can just basically play your session on a screen that you happen to have your standardized joystick and play against other players.\n\nIt’s sort of a way to get sort of platform independence and even a greater level of convenience. And convenience is a really big theme that has been driving the game industry for a while. We don’t have to go to stores or we don’t have to really wait. Whether going through the wireless cell phone network or you’re in front of a screen that’s attached to the Internet. And we can try things for free. We can try them right now. A lot of things are are designed so that it’s easy for all kinds of people to be into them smoothly and quickly. And the audience is exploding and we’re moving up towards having three billion gamers.\n\nAnd it just goes to show that games are really mainstream now. It’s not the kind of activity that it used to be where you were embarrassed to admit that you played games. and it was something where you’d go down to your basement to play Grand Theft Auto for 50 hours. So it’s exciting to look forward to these kinds of cloud services. It’ll be a little bit like trying to be the Netflix of games. And I think you’re going to end up seeing a big battle between some really big companies fighting over that business model. And it will probably result in some of the biggest acquisitions in the history of the industry.\n\nJK: In terms of cloud gaming do you think it is Google’s Stadia or do you think it will be something else?\n\nTrip: You have to have a back catalog. And in addition to a back catalog, which helps me as a potential subscriber feel like, well, there’s always something to do. So you have to have some studio capacity. You have to have some exclusives and you have to have a depth.\n\nAnd it’s a little bit how Netflix kind of positions with what they have to offer. You turn it on, you start looking at it and realize, well, look at all this stuff. The funny thing is they kind of obscure the fact that they don’t have the new movie releases because as of a few years ago, the movie companies decided they wanted to run their own services and compete with Netflix. So they’re sure as heck not going to just easily give permission to Netflix. And Netflix occasionally gets something for a limited time period by paying a lot to have access to it. But Netflix doesn’t have everything.\n\nNow, they’re kind of the evidence that you can actually be successful without having everything. But you better have something. So Google doesn’t have much of anything at the moment. You know, the guys that have big catalogs are guys like Sony and Microsoft, and they have good first party games for PlayStation and Xbox. But they also have their license agreements with their third party licenses that have made games for their platforms. And basically, if they want to restrict those from going on to say Stadia for X box games or a Google Stadia for PlayStation games, they can easily do that. Well, what’s easier for Google to do and for any developer to do is to put their P.C. version on a service like Google Stadia. But even there, maybe a medium size or larger independent companies like Electronic Arts and Activision, maybe they’d rather run their own service or maybe if they talked to Google Stadia, they’re not satisfied that Google’s offering them enough money. But again, I think this at some point would cause Google to decide whether it should acquire some of these companies."
