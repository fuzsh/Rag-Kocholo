        "text": "Update: Trip Hawkins Responds!\n\nA San Francisco federal judge has rejected the effort of William M. (Trip) Hawkins III to use personal bankruptcy to cancel more than $20 million of federal and California state tax obligations stemming from abusive tax shelters he used to shield vast profits from Electronic Arts, the pioneering video gaming firm he founded nearly three decades ago.\n\nIn a stinging 16-page opinion this week, US. District Judge Jeffrey S. White upheld an earlier bankruptcy-court ruling, saying Hawkins (above right) knew he was insolvent after the Internal Revenue Service disallowed his tax shelters but \"continued to spend money extravagantly with knowledge of his tax liabilities\" to the IRS and the California Franchise Tax Board. \"Hawkins planned to defeat his taxes via bankruptcy and continue living the lifestyle to which he had grown accustomed,\" the judge declared. Cited evidence included purchase of a $70,000 car--the fourth vehicle in a two-driver household.\n\nMessages to Hawkins and his spokesmen requesting comment were not returned.\n\nHawkins, 57, is now chief executive of Digital Chocolate, another prominent Silicon Valley gaming company that he started in 2003 and which has made a splash with games on other social platforms like cellphones and Facebook. Well-known titles include Millionaire City, MMA Pro Fighter, Rollercoaster Rush and Tower Bloxx. Earlier this month , the company announced it had received a $12 million in a venture capital funding round led by Intel Capital and including Sutter Hill Ventures and Bridgescale Partners.\n\nHawkins and his wife quietly filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in 2006. In court filings he listed assets of $5 million and liabilities of $28 million--almost all of it owed to the two tax agencies. The couple obtained a general discharge of their debts. But the two tax agencies successfully avoided the cleansing under a provision of bankruptcy law that prohibits discharge of tax debts if the debtor \"willfully attempted in any manner to evade or defeat such tax.\"\n\nThe ruling seems to mean the bankruptcy filing by Hawkins was largely in vain. The outstanding tax liability is not clear from court filings but appears to be between $20 million and $25 million. In 2006 the IRS rejected Hawkins' proposal of an offer-in-compromise settlement of his tax obligations for $8 million.\n\nThe latest ruling adorns a truly legendary career. After majoring in strategy and applied game theory at Harvard and getting an MBA from Stanford, Hawkins became an early employee of Apple and rose to be its director of strategy in marketing. In 1982 he helped start Electronic Arts and soon scored a hit with John Madden Football. In the early 1990s he went to run 3DO, an EA subsidiary that focused on hardware. By the mid-1990s, according to court records, his net worth was $100 million, almost all of it in EA stock.\n\nIn 1994, Hawkins started selling his EA shares, partly to invest in 3DO. The sales generated large capital gains. According to court records, the accounting firm KPMG convinced Hawkins that he could avoid taxes by employing exotic strategies to create the appearance of large capital losses without the real risk of loss. The ploys, known as the FLIP and OPIS shelters, involved use of offshore corporations, options and investments in offshore companies like UBS AG to artificially generate a high tax basis.\n\nFrom 1996 to 2000 Hawkins claimed $56 million in capital losses. In 2001 the IRS challenged the legitimacy of so-called basis-shifting tax shelters in general. The move affected hundreds of well-heeled entrepreneurs who found even the greatly reduced capital gains tax too high.\n\nThat same year, the IRS began an audit of Hawkins. The handwriting was on the wall. The tax threat came amid growing problems at 3DO, which went bankrupt in 2003.\n\nHawkins used his deteriorating financial situation to seek a reduction in child support he owed his first wife. In a January 2004 family court filing, he admitted he was insolvent, and in that court he openly discussed the possibility of using bankruptcy to reduce his tax liability.\n\nAnd there, from the perspective of later judges, was the rub. Although he sold real estate, including his home in tony Atherton, and made some tax payments, Hawkins \"continued to make unnecessary and unreasonable expenditures despite this knowledge of his finances,\" Judge White wrote. He cited records putting Hawkins' monthly expenses in 2005 at $94,900. This included $4,500 for \"child/dependent care\" even though his wife was a stay-at-home mom, and $40,550 in \"other expenses.\"\n\nThe judge also cited the monthly $1,208 payment on that fourth car, a Cadillac Escalade. Hawkins and his wife bought the vehicle for $69,974 in October 2004, \"ten months after Hawkins had acknowledged his tax liability and insolvency,\" the opinion noted pointedly.\n\nHawkins argued in court that tax debts could be denied discharge only upon a showing of fraud. The judge rejected that, saying it was sufficient that Hawkins knew he had tax problems and still made \"large discretionary expenditures.\" This is hardly the first time a judge has come down hard on the spending of someone with a tax problem.\n\nThat Hawkins ended up in the exact same tax-shelter trouble as so many other entrepreneurs clashes with the business philosophy he outlined to Forbes in September 2004 as the financial storms were gathering. \"I hate the dog-eat-dog aspect of business and copying what everyone else does,\" he said. \"I want to invent something truly new.\""
