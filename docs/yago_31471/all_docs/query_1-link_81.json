        "text": "n any case, your reviewer blew it on this one. And we are re-evaluating our relationship with GamePro as a result.\n\n=\n\n“You gave us a bad score, we might not send you free stuff now :(”\n\nYour reviewers have no idea how to make a great game. None of them have ever made one. But they sure have fun telling us in a nasty tone how inferior we are to them.\n\nHA HA HA!\n\nI’m going to stop reading there. This guy is a twit.\n\nI agree with some of what you said kraz, but the thing is, Myst was reviewed very highly.\n\nI don’t think you’re giving reviewers enough credibility. On almost all the major game review sites (gamespot, gamespy, sometimes even IGN) the reviewers look at all games objectively for what they are trying to accomplish, who they are accomplishing it for, and how well they accomplish it. Take a look at the Korsun Pocket review. This game appeals to a minor fraction of the hardcore gaming market, yet it was judged on that level. And very highly as well.\n\nTrip was, quite simply, totally delusional in his letter. The problem with Portal Runner (and the vast majority of 3DO’s internal projects) was that it was fundamentally flawed. It doesn’t matter if the game was targeted at children, teenagers or the elderly. The game was simply trash. Complete and utter trash.\n\nThe most alarming bit of this letter were the threats made by him:\n\n“I make trash. You say the trash is good, or you’re going out of buisness”.\n\nI wonder if this is a constant cloud over every game magazine/site’s editor’s head.\n\nMyst sucked for casual gamers. They couldn’t get past the puzzles.\n\nI was actually agreeing with some of his early points. There are a more than a few jaded writers out there who pretty much hate almost everything and have lost enthusiasm for gaming. (Same goes for lots of enthusiast mags – car mags, etc. If it’s not h4rdc0r3, it suxx0rz.) I’ve edited more than one hatchet job where a decent game was slammed because it didn’t have one feature a writer wanted, or because the writer had a fun idea for an approach to a negative review.\n\nThen Trip destroys it by tying the editorial to advertising. I only know of one publisher in the gaming industry where that worked, and I’m not even sure that they’re still around (mid-90s console publisher, name eludes me). It sure as hell doesn’t work at Ziff, CGM, or PCG – just pisses the editors off. If magazines don’t serve the best interests of their readers (who are the customers, even though advertisers pay the bills), the magazines will fail.\n\nI played Portal Runner, and it blew chunks… I think I reviewed it as well, but that was quite awhile ago.\n\nWhat I think really happens in these situations is that the publisher buys advertising in the magazine and spends a big chunk of change to do so. Building hype about the title and what not. Then they give a press release copy to the mag, and they are assuming the mag will rate it highly. Not just so people will run out and buy it, but more so they can put…\n\n***** - Game Pro Magazine\n\nGreatest Game Ever Made - EGM\n\netc…\n\nSo they spend all this money, send them prerelease code, schmooze the hell out of them, and then they get a negative review and then feel jaded about it.\n\nBut really… Portal Runner was horrible… If Trip couldn’t see that back then, it’s no wonder 3DO died the mean death.\n\nK"
