        "text": "Game builds are clearly Electronic Arts' most critical digital asset. The builds must be readily accessible to those who should be working with them — and no one else. By integrating with EA’s existing game builds servers, their content management application offers a highly efficient, scalable solution that provides secure and reliable game build access and delivery throughout the entire game life cycle.\n\nReliable, secure delivery\n\nEA is a global leader in digital interactive entertainment, providing blockbuster video games, content and online services for game consoles, PCs and mobile devices. To satisfy the constant demand for new games from over 300 million registered players around the world, EA developers must work around the clock. At any given moment, about 70 different global teams will be hard at work on multiple game builds in various stages of the development cycle.\n\n“With the latest generation of game consoles, our games are have become much more complex, and so have our challenges of providing secure, reliable access to game builds,\" said Steve Scivally, the director of EA’s release and preservation management (RPM) team.\n\nEA’s custom-built internal application for secure game build delivery had become outdated and was unable to scale any further.\n\nAgile tracking of video game builds\n\nThe RPM team concluded that Hyland's Nuxeo Platform went above and beyond other evaluated solutions to provide some critical benefits, including:\n\nSupport for an agile development and release model that is capable of keeping up with EA’s fast-moving, concurrent development activities\n\nAccelerating development while reducing required time and resources. With Nuxeo Platform, Scivally and his team don't have to build basic components. Nuxeo Studio, part of Nuxeo Online Services, maximizes application configuration while minimizing the need for custom coding, greatly reducing time and resource requirements.\n\nFreely defining “content” to match the business context. Document management tools typically have rigidly defined electronic documents, folders and cabinets. In contrast, the Nuxeo Platform provides a schema-flexible content model that allows developers to define virtually limitless custom content objects, with flexible metadata and complex fields, to match the organization’s needs.\n\nThe RPM group’s first Nuxeo Platform-powered application, Shift, was named after its goal to simplify the shifting of content around EA.\n\nMaximizing game security\n\nShift is currently in production and actively used by 600 to 800 unique users per day, from EA’s development, certification and release management, QA and testing teams around the world.\n\nBy integrating with EA’s existing game builds servers, Shift offers a highly efficient, scalable solution that provides secure and reliable game build access and delivery throughout the entire game life cycle.\n\nCreating a new game build and access controls\n\nWhen a new game build is done, it's submitted automatically into Shift using an automation tool. For example, when EA’s Stockholm location creates a new build for Battlefield, custom metadata fields are automatically populated in Shift, including information relating to access controls and the locations of the build content: source code, artwork and audio assets.\n\nUpon validation, Nuxeo Platform retains the information provided in a custom document type (content object) for that build, with a life cycle status indicating it is available for access. Notifications are then automatically sent to everyone involved in the process.\n\nBuilds are categorized by title (e.g., Battlefield), game system platform (PlayStation, Xbox, PC), content type and language.\n\nA full audit history for each game build is maintained, logging all user activity, such as when a build was checked in or out and by whom, and any modification of permissions.\n\n“We also extended the Nuxeo Platform audit service to also capture every aspect of each event, including key custom elements to identify any new values created and what previous values were replaced,\" Scivally said.\n\nShift fully utilizes Nuxeo Platform’s out-of-the-box access control resources, as well as some custom security policies. For example, “only QA teams can update the life cycle state of a game build from alpha to beta, preproduction and, eventually, final release of the game,\" Scivally said. \"Nuxeo Platform allows our Shift application to have fine-grained security, by business role, down to the metadata level.”\n\nOf course, there are always valid exceptions to security policy. Shift utilizes approval workflows to enable workers to submit a request to access a game build not allowed by their access permissions. The submission, including an explanation from the requester, is routed to the content owner defined in Shift. The owner will approve or deny the request.\n\n“Shift ensures the approval request process is as efficient and responsive as possible, while fully documenting who approved special access, where and when,\" Scivally said. \"Our Shift application provides fast, reliable and responsive access to game builds with complete security, while also helping expedite our time-to-market for new games.”\n\nInnovations by EA\n\nSince the Shift application’s original launch using the Nuxeo Platform Document Management module, EA has since upgraded to the Nuxeo LTS 6.0 release with Elasticsearch, utilizing more of the full Nuxeo Platform and enabling more robust workflows.\n\nIn addition, the development team has built management of the Shift application within Nuxeo Platform, using another custom document type called site, which is structured to hold metadata about the technology infrastructure. Now, operators use the same application to manage the infrastructure inventory worldwide. Today, all 26 of EA’s key physical and virtual sites are managed worldwide by the Shift application.\n\nTracking and repurposing archived games\n\nThe EA RPM group recently deployed a second Nuxeo Platform-powered application, Vintage, for managing released game titles archived for preservation."
