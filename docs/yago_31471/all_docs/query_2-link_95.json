        "text": "Defend C&C4. Go. I want to see you get out of that one :p\n\nI haven't played it, so can't really defend it one way or the other. Something people need to understand though, and I hate to toss any fellow devs under any sort of bus, but if a game is no good, it's not necessairly EA cutting costs or whatever, sometimes it's just a team of devs with the wrong guy in a creative seat, or one wrong idea that gets expanded upon.\n\n1: How do you sleep at night when you work for such scumbags? 2: How does it feel to work for the worst company in America? 3: Why do I have to install your garbage \"origin\" in order to play a game I paid $60 for? there was no mention of this garbage when I handed over my cash.\n\n1. I sleep very well thank you. I don't feel like everybody I work for is a scumbag, though I understand the perception. 2. I don't, I work for Electronic Arts. We make video games. 3. I think boxes do have a \"origin required\" thing on them. If they don't, they definitely should. I'm not fan of having to be online to play a single player game, but I do believe it's an anti piracy tactic.\n\nHow does someone get into the games industry? What's the work like?\n\nIt's not easy. On one of my first days in college, my professor told the entire class to \"not seek this line of work, because 99% of you will not make it\". It was a pretty harsh truth, but in the end, if you have a passion, drive and talent you'll probably do ok. You need to be very good at something that a development studio needs. You need to be able to show that you're good at it. That's enough for many, but it helps if you're professional, can communicate well and are not a *** head. The work is awesome, but can be tough and stressful at times. I wouldn't trade it for almost anything though.\n\nWhat do you feel makes large scale development teams at EA different than smaller scale companies, such as Minecraft? (I'm writing a management paper comparing the 2, so go all out if you want)\n\nIt's pretty simple really. The less people, the smaller the chain of command. I'm not sure how big Mojang is, but let's say 10 people. EA has probably over 5000 scattered around the globe. Now, as an EA dev I want to make x change to the game.It has to get run upstairs and into several different departments for approval (though not always), it goes through legal, marketing, etc. So say it runs by 20 different people before coming back to me. At Mojang you'd turn around in your seat and ask Jeb/Notch/Whoever if it was ok to do. Not only that, but the less people, the more it will feel like a family. You see everybody every day, and know everybody very well. At larger places such as EA, you can go a week or more without seeing your close friends in the studio because you're too busy. Passing by in the hallways (not including formal meetings), i've seen our upper management (CEO, CFO, etc.) maybe two or three times in seven years.\n\nWhat's the chain of command like for you? To specify, do YOU personally have room to grow in your career in EA and make a larger salary than what you currently do?\n\nTons of room to grow, but as I've mentioned in other posts, the competition in the industry can be insane. EA is not prone to hire within over hiring from outside or vice versa, they simply hire the best person for the job. If you're the best person for the job and EA is aware that you exist and want that job, you're probably going to get it.\n\nI have an aunt that worked as an accountant for EA and quit because she said the working conditions were hostile and the company treated their employees poorly. Have you ever experienced this?\n\nI have definitely not had this experience, but EA is so huge I'm sure you can find the entire spectrum within it if you look long enough. I've seen people treated hostiley (Is that... a word?) before, but in my opinion it was brought on themselves. It may be different for me because I'm on a development team, and not just taking care of the books.\n\nHow many companies have you worked in before EA? How does EA compare to previous jobs? Also mind sharing some info about how things are run, projects are managed or some general info from the inside?\n\nI've worked for one company other than EA, so can't give first hand comparisons to many other companies. I do know many people in the industry though, and from many other companies. From word of mouth, many studios are far worse than EA, while others are far better. I find that, with a few exceptions, the larger a company the more likely you're treated as just an employee number by upper management. It's not always about upper management though. I've found what makes a studio great to work in, is the people you work with, not the people you work for... mostly.\n\nhow do you feel about EA acquiring companies who are known for their well made games...then giving them unrealistic deadlines which pushes out crap products *cough bioware cough*\n\nIt's really ***. I firmly believe that a game should be released when it's ready to be released, not when there's a \"perfect release window\". eg. right before the holiday season. Valve does this well, and Blizzard used to (and maybe still does, but we'll see). Keep in mind though that to the decision makers in the company, it's all about money. Will they make more money if they release a semi unpolished/rushed product right before christmas? Or will they get more sales and profit if they extend the deadline until further down the road? Also keep in mind that a rushed game isn't always due to a suit telling the developers to get it done by a certain date, but can sometimes be the developers saying they can get it done on that date, and then much too late realizing that something has come up or the inital estimate was off. At times like that it can very much be a \"release then or cancel project and fire team\" type of scenario\n\nI've heard that EA is the absolute worst game company to work for. Is this true in your experience?\n\nI had thought so when I was working there. Compared to an independent developer though, at least you'd have job stability and benefits. I realized over time though that what it comes down to is having thick skin with regards to dealing with people and their demands / criticisms, and setting your own limits so that 60 hour work weeks would only happen during imposed crunch times."
