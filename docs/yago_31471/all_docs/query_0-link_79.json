        "text": "William Murray “Trip” Hawkins III, who founded gaming giant Electronic Arts, has made the jump from Web2 to Web3, taking on the role of Chief Strategy Officer for Barcelona-based gaming startup Games for a living.\n\nHawkins, who will also take a role on the company’s board, aims to help the company with their goals of mass adoption and to tackle “understanding and adoption of Web3 games overall,” the company said in a press release shared with CoinDesk.\n\n“I’m excited to begin my journey with Games for a living, leveraging new and emerging technologies to enhance performance and create exciting, immersive experiences for gamers,” Hawkins said in a press release. Hawkins added that he expects blockchain to be used more by content creators and that the company plans “to do it in a way that helps enhance game performance and value for players while keeping things fun.”\n\nHawkins has previously worked with the Games for a living CEO, Manel Sort, at Digital Chocolate. Sort also has a berth of Web2 gaming experience, with previous roles at Activision Blizzard and advising on games such as Candy Crush.\n\nHiring and investments into Web3 gaming continue to grow despite the broader crypto market downturn, with Pantera recently investing $10 million in Metaverse Game Worldwide Webb and gaming platform Ajuna raising $5 million in new financing this month. Square Enix, the company behind hits such as Final Fantasy, recently announced a partnership with Polygon to create an NFT art project."
