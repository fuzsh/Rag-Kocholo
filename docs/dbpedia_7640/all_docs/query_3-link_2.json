        "text": "Once Zack and Cody Martin left the Tipton Hotel, they took their antics to the sea! Following the success of the Suite Life of Zack & Cody, twins Dylan and Cole Sprouse reprised their roles for the spinoff series Suite Life on Deck.\n\nThe show premiered in September 2008 and followed Zack (Dylan) and Cody (Cole) as they join hotel heiress London Tipton (Brenda Song) aboard the S.S. Tipton. While on the ship, the boys travel around the world alongside Mr. Moseby (Phill Lewis) and their new friend Bailey Pickett (Debby Ryan). The Suite Life on Deck aired on Disney Channel for three seasons until coming to an end in May 2011.\n\n“I was a freshman when I moved out for Suite Life and now my best friend has her graduation ceremony a week after [my] graduation episode so it’s kind of bizarre,” Debby told TVGuide at the time. “Filming the finale, in addition to crying and hugging each other, we were talking about what’s next in our lives. We’re all so happy to see what we’re all going to go out and do.”\n\nThe actress recalled her last day on set, revealing how close the cast was in real life.\n\n“All the tears in the goodbye scene, those were real,” Debby shared. “It was the last scene we filmed. You see not only how much the characters are going to miss each other, but how much as actors we’re going to miss each other.”\n\nShe, alongside the rest of the cast, went on to continue their successful acting careers.\n\n“Suite Life was my high school experience,” the Disney Channel alum explained at the time. “Now it’s time to take what we’ve learned and apply it somewhere else — for me that’s going to be Jessie.”\n\nWhile Debby went on to star in another TV show, Dylan and Cole took a brief break from acting to attend New York University. They’ve since stepped foot back into the spotlight, but have no plans to reboot the Suite Life series any time soon.\n\n“Reboots are a tricky thing, you know? The original shows, when they become successful, sit within this golden little plate of nostalgia, and when you modernize it and go back to it, it has the potential to really disenfranchise the original fan base. So it’s a very, very touchy thing,” Cole shared on The Drew Barrymore Show in January 2021. “I’m asked all the time if Dylan and I are going to do a Suite Life reboot, and I go, ‘No, absolutely not.’”\n\nWhile the Suite Life may have come to an end, their careers haven’t!
