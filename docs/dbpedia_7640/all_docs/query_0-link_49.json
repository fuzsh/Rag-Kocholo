        "text": "VIDEO Exclusive: Mitchel Musso Makes His Pair of Kings Musical Debut\n\nIn addition to his roles on Hannah Montana and Pair of Kings, 19-year-old Mitchel Musso is known for his music (he's recorded two albums). On an upcoming episode of his Disney XD series, he'll get to show off his skills. Pair of Kings star Kelsey Chow never hesitated about attending college\n\nDisney's Pair of Kings Takes Viewers on a Magic Ride\n\nImagine a world where you could have a twin of another race, date a mermaid, and be a king as a teenager. That's what life is like on Disney's latest action-adventure series Pair of Kings. Starring Doc Shaw (The Suite Life on Deck) and Mitchel Musso (Hannah Montana), Kings will premiere on Disney, then moves over to Disney XD, the company's more male-oriented station. But co-star Kelsey Chow (One Tree Hill) says girls have a reason to tune in as well. \"We've got a lot of cute boys and (my character) Mikayla is a good role model for girls,\" she told TVGuide.com on a recent visit to the set. Shaw also tells us what's so special about the island of Kinkow and why being a king isn't all it's cracked up to be."
