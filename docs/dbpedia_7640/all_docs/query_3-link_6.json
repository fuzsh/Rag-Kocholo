        "text": "The Suite Life on Deck is a sequel/spin-off series of the Disney Channel Original Series The Suite Life of Zack & Cody. The series follows twin brothers Zack and Cody Martin and hotel heiress London Tipton in a new setting, the SS Tipton, where they attend classes at \"Seven Seas High\" and meet Bailey Pickett while Mr. Moseby manages the ship. The ship travels around the world to countries, such as Italy, Greece, India, Morocco, the United Kingdom, and many more, where the characters experience different cultures and adventures and where Zack and Cody usually get in trouble.\n\nThe series' pilot aired in the UK on September 19, 2008, and in US markets on September 26, 2008. The series premiere on the Disney Channel in the US drew 5.7 million viewers, and it became the most-watched series premiere in Canada on the Family channel. The show was also TV's No. 1 scripted series in Kids 6-11 and Tweens 9-14 in 2008, outpacing veteran series Hannah Montana and Wizards of Waverly Place in the ratings.\n\nThe show was created by Danny Kallis and Jim Geoghan, and developed by Kallis and Pamela Eells O'Connell. Returning stars for the series are Cole Sprouse, Dylan Sprouse, Brenda Song, and Phill Lewis. Newcomers for the series include Debby Ryan (as a regular cast member), Matthew Timmons (as a recurring guest star), and Erin Cardillo (as a recurring guest star). Doc Shaw joined the cast in season two.\n\nThe series has been broadcast in more than 30 countries worldwide, and is shot at Hollywood Center Studios in Los Angeles. The pilot was available as a free download on the American iTunes store starting on September 9, 2008, but was later moved to the regular price of $1.99. The series was taped in front of a live studio audience.\n\nProduction[]\n\nDevelopment[]\n\nOn February 4, 2008, it was announced that the Disney Channel was developing a new contemporary spin-off of The Suite Life of Zack & Cody. The announcement was made by Gary Marsh, the President of the Disney Channel. He stated, \"Our audience has shown us that after 88 episodes, 'The Suite Life of Zack & Cody' remains one of their favorite sitcoms ever, we decided to find a new way for Zack, Cody, London and Mr. Moseby to live 'The Suite Life' in a whole new setting -- this time aboard a luxury cruise liner.\"\n\nThe series original creator, Danny Kallis was announced to be involved with the project. The elements from the original series remain the same though the setting is completely different. The series main concepts were created by Kallis and Pamela Eells O'Connell. Kallis, O'Connell, Jim Geoghan and Irene Dreayer are the executive producers. The series was produced by It's a Laugh Productions and Danny Kallis Productions.\n\nIn December 2008, it was reported that the Disney Channel had renewed the series for a thirteen episode second season. On May 11, 2009, Disney issued a press release stating that the second season had been extended to include a larger number of episodes than the original thirteen. Gary Marsh, the president of Disney Channels Worldwide said: \"With this second-season extension, the cast of ‘The Suite Life’ makes Disney Channel history by becoming the longest running continuous characters on our air - 138 half-hour episodes. We are thrilled for them, and for the brilliant, inspired production team that made this extraordinary run possible.\" With the second season extension, the characters played by Cole Sprouse, Dylan Sprouse, Brenda Song, and Phill Lewis will become the longest running continuous characters in Disney Channel history with 138 episodes.\n\nAfter three full seasons, the Suite Life on Deck ended on May 6, 2011. There are no plans to produce another \"Suite Life\" series and no cast member has mentioned any involvement whatsoever.\n\nSettings[]\n\nAccording to show creators and producers, the choice of setting was made to appeal to an international audience with different ports-of-call, such as India, Greece, and Italy. An on-board theater serves as an \"organic\" set-up for musical numbers. Most of the action in the series occurs on board the \"SS Tipton.\" However, the ship travels to places such as India, Greece, Italy, and \"Parrot Island,\" which are unfamiliar places to both Zack and Cody Martin.\n\nSS Tipton[]\n\nThe SS Tipton is a cruise ship belonging to London Tipton's father. Unlike most cruise ships it also includes a school, \"Seven Seas High School,\" which is a common setting on the ship, as are The Sky Deck, the lobby, and the students' cabins. There are also various areas on the SS Tipton that are mentioned, but never seen, including the Lido Deck, the Fiesta Deck, the Promenade Deck, and the ship's Putt-Putt Golf Course, where the captain spends most of his time. In the crossover episode of Wizards of Waverly Place, \"Cast-Away (To Another Show)\", the boat itself was revealed to weigh at least 87,000 tons.\n\nOther settings[]\n\nGreece - The SS Tipton visits Athens, Greece in the episode \"It's All Greek to Me.\" The students visit the museum of Greek Antiquities.\n\nIndia - In the episode \"The Mommy and the Swami,\" the SS Tipton docks somewhere along the coast of India. The only place shown in India is the Swami Temple on top of a tall mountain, where Zack and Cody arrive after a long climb.\n\nLinchtenstamp - The SS Tipton visits this fictional country in the episode \"Maddie on Deck.\" The only place ever shown in the country is the Royal Palace. It is a parody of Liechenstein.\n\nParrot Island - The SS Tipton makes a special trip to Parrot Island in order to rescue London in the episode \"Parrot Island\". Places on Parrot Island where the characters visit include the jail and the market.\n\nRome - The SS Tipton docks in Rome during the episode \"When In Rome...\" The only places seen in Rome are Gigi's Restaurant and the courtyard outside.\n\nHawaii - In the \"Wizards on Deck with Hannah Montana\" crossover, the SS Tipton docks in Honolulu.\n\nCast and characters[]\n\nCast[]\n\nActor Character Main cast\n\nseasons Recurring cast\n\nseasons Cole Sprouse Cody Martin 1-3 Dylan Sprouse Zack Martin 1-3 Brenda Song London Tipton 1-3 Debby Ryan Bailey Pickett 1-3 Phill Lewis Marion Moseby 1-3 Doc Shaw Marcus Little 2-3 Matthew Timmons Woody Fink 1-3 Erin Cardillo Emma Tutweiller 1-3\n\nMain characters[]\n\nZack and Cody Martin[]\n\nMain article: Zack Martin\n\nMain article: Cody Martin\n\nZack and Cody Martin (Dylan and Cole Sprouse) are identical twins living in the luxury passenger cruise liner, the SS Tipton. The Martin twins attend classes at Seven Seas High, which is an SS Tipton school program. Zack Martin (Dylan Sprouse) is typically the non-studious, outgoing, and immature twin. He works in the juice bar on the ship as a result of using up both Cody's and his money for the semester. Cody was forced to obtain the job as a towel boy. Zack does not perform particularly well academically, but he manages to perform well physically and enjoys physical sports especially basketball. Zack acts aggressive at times. Zack seems to care about his brother, but at times he does not show this. His brother, Cody Martin (Cole Sprouse), is the erudite, mature, intelligent, wise and sensitive twin. Cody performs well academically, he is a straight A+ student and has shown to have a great interest in academics. Cody does not perform well in sports. Cody has been noted to be several minutes younger than Zack and also often plays along with Zack's crazy schemes. In the beginning of the second episode in the first season, Zack and Cody were both fighting over the new Seven Seas High student, Bailey Pickett (Debby Ryan) since they both seemed to have a crush on her. But in the end, when they found out more about Bailey's life and her ex-boyfriend, Zack decides to lose interest in Bailey letting Cody have her. Cody attempts several times to attract Bailey, but is, thus far in the series, unsuccessful as Bailey seems oblivious to his advances. In \"International Dateline,\" he gets really close, but finally succeeds in \"Wizards On Deck With Hannah Montana\" by impressing Bailey by getting concert tickets, back stage passes, and after party tickets from Hannah Montana. Bailey considers this a date and plants a kiss on Cody's lips, thus starting their relationship. Zack usually picks on his little brother, but becomes very protective of him when someone else picks on him.\n\nLondon Tipton[]\n\nMain article: London Tipton\n\nLondon Tipton (Brenda Song) is the socialite of the four main teen characters (Zack, Cody, Bailey, and London). She is the daughter of Wilfred Tipton, a multibillionaire who is the owner of the Tipton Hotel chains, including the Boston Tipton Hotel and the SS Tipton. She is described as a \"dim-witted, spoiled, gullible, and an often airheaded teenager\". When she is happy, she usually claps her hands repeatedly jumps up and down, while saying her catchphrase, \"Yay me!\" Mr. Moseby fools London into thinking that she is on the SS Tipton for a vacation, to get her on the ship. London gets enrolled at the Seven Seas High school program because her father wants her to live in the real world. London does not live in a first class suite at the SS Tipton, she resides in a small cabin. London reluctantly agreed to accept Bailey Pickett (Debby Ryan) as her new roommate, although she did so after unsuccessfully trying to bribe Bailey into leaving as she did with her previous roommate. The two later become good friends. In the beginning of the Suite Life series, when London resided at the Boston Tipton Hotel, it seemed she was living in her own bubble. On the SS Tipton, London has become more aware of the real world and has faced several difficulties. London also has a pet dog named Ivana.\n\nBailey Pickett[]\n\nBailey Pickett (Debby Ryan) is a fifteen-year-old teenage girl from the fictional town of Kettlecorn, Kansas. She is seemingly the perfect girl next door and has been described as a \"small town, down-to-earth girl.\" She shares a room with the wealthy socialite London Tipton, in which the two later form a close friendship together and end up becoming best friends. Bailey is a student at Seven Seas High and attends classes with her new friends Zack, Cody, London, and Woody. She came on the ship to leave Kettlecorn, where she lived on a farm, because she hated the fact that the town is so small. She pretends to be a boy in the pilot in order to get a room on the SS Tipton because the girls' cabins were filled. Eventually, she moves in with London when people find out she is a girl. London tries to bribe her not to move in but Bailey refuses. In the beginning of the second episode in the first season, Zack and Cody were both fighting over Bailey since they both seemed to have a crush on her. But in the end, when they knew more about Bailey's life and her ex-boyfriend, Zack lets Cody have Bailey claiming that Bailey was carrying too much baggage and that he liked girls with just carry-ons. Cody tries several times to attract Bailey, but is, thus far in the series, unsuccessful as Bailey seems oblivious to his advances, though in one episode when Cody apologized to Bailey for lying to Cody's ex-girlfriend, Barbara, she acted like she would if Cody would have asked her to pretend to be his girlfriend, which ended in a kiss on the cheek. In the crossover episode \"Wizards on Deck with Hannah Montana\", she plants a kiss on Cody's lips, resulting in them starting a relationship.\n\nEpisodes in which Bailey Pickett was absent on season 1:\n\n\"The Mommy and the Swami\" - Episode 12\n\n\"Mom and Dad on Deck\" - Episode 16\n\n\"The Wrong Stuff\" - Episode 17\n\n\"Splash & Trash\" - Episode 18\n\n\"Cruisin' for a Bruisin'\" - Episode 20\n\nEpisodes in which Bailey Pickett was absent on season 2:\n\n\"Any Given Fantasy\" - Episode 37 (Episode 16 of season 2)\n\nEpisodes in which Bailey Pickett was absent on season 3:\n\n\"My Oh Maya\" - Episode 53 (Episode 4 of season 3)\n\n\"Das Boots\" - Episode 54 (Episode 5 of season 3)\n\n\"Computer Date\" - Episode 56 (Episode 7 of season 3)\n\nMr. Moseby[]\n\nMarion Moseby (Phill Lewis) is the uptight and serious former manager of the Tipton Hotel in The Suite Life of Zack and Cody, Moseby is now the chaperon and manager of the SS Tipton. He speaks with a wide vocabulary and an urbane vernacular, and is often annoyed by Zack and Cody's schemes. His repeated catch phrase, \"Good Luck with That\" has become his trademark. Though he acts as though he does not care about the boys, he actually has a great deal of affection for them. He's constantly running from stem to stern keeping the Martin twins and London out of trouble. Moseby is a father figure in London's life, because of London's father absence in the series he looks after her. Moseby reportedly tricked London in order for her to be enrolled in the Seven Seas High school program.
