        "text": "(Photo Courtesy: Disney Dreamers Academy)\n\nDoc Shaw didn’t always have a “suite life”. He wasn’t born a “king” or a Disney star. As a matter of fact, his dream wasn’t just to be on TV–it was to take care of his mom who was widowed. When Doc was only two-years-old, his father died in a car crash. But the dream Doc’s dad instilled in him, when he signed his son up to be a model, lived on. You see, Doc was in the car and survived the accident. A few years later at the tender age of six, he said, “Mom I was left here for a reason. The word was spoken on my life, and I have unfinished work to do. I want to continue my career, so please find me an agent.” So she did, and she later became his manager. Ironically, he landed a role in a sitcom called “House of Pain”. But his pain was lessening, and his comedy–and his mother–kept a smile on his face.\n\nDiary of a First Time Mom caught up with the Shaw’s at the Disney Dreamers Academy to find out how their dream of living a joyous life came true.\n\nDoc: The good thing about a dream, and the good thing about faith is that, everything happens for a reason. God has a path for everyone…I knew God had a path for me. I just had to keep believing and keep praying. Something was going to work out….For every dream, there is a nightmare. But you can’t let those nightmares consume you. You can’t go home and cry and forget about your dreams just because someone has laid a little bump on the road. You have to have perseverance and determination to get over that hill and accomplish that dream.\n\nTammie: You have to surround yourself with people going in the same direction. We as parents–we have to back our kids. They’re going to go to the left sometimes, but with God and faith–faith of a mustard seed, you accomplish everything.\n\nDoc: When I was cast in House of Pain, I was able to finally take care of my mom the way she needed to be–to provide for her the way she provided for me for years and sheltered me. So my dream has been satisfied. From “House of Pain,” to “Suite Life on Deck” and “Pair of Kings.” I can honestly look at my mom everyday and say, ‘I’m doing this for you. My dream is to wake up every morning and make sure that smile is still on your face.\n\nTammie: Surround yourself with good people, people who are going to help you. People who see things as you see them. I believe in God and I have faith, so I stepped back and let God work. And when God moves, can’t nobody else mess with me. I wanted to show my son that we can do this. We can do this, and we’re going to be paid in the end. So single moms, keep the faith. Invest in your child’s future.\n\nTammie Shaw is getting back what she invested–not just in the form of money rather love. Right now, Doc is filming his next project–a Planet of the Apes sequel."
