        "text": "Even though this episode story basically mirrored an episode of the Suite Life of Zack & Cody, I enjoyed \"Maddie On Deck\". It was great to have Maddie reunited with the gang. I just hope that if she comes back again the writers will have a better storyline for her .\n\nIn the Disney world, there will never be a good storyline for any of the characters. I mean most of the actors/actresses have to act mean-spirited, lazy, shallow, and dumb. The shame of it is that we're supposed to be somewhat familiar with them based on how we act in the real world and how they act in the show.\n\nIf Maddie returns, I hope that she'll keep her promise, for those who remember what I'm referring to from season one, to Zach if there's a prom during the end of the 'Semester at Sea' program since, and even though it was played for laughs, maybe Maddie and Zach might be a couple. A boy can dream can't he?\n\nYou gotta admit, the crossover seems exciting.\n\nI don't know about this. First think about Selena's presence in this. won't Zack, Cody, Lilly, and Miley get her confused with the characters that she played in both Suite Life of Zack and Cody AND Hannah Montana? Now that I think about it, this crossover, the Sonny With A Chance episode guest starring Selena...it all makes sense. Disney's trying to make Selena bigger than anyone on the network. And all of this leads up to the premiere of the new DCOM Princess Protection Program. Talk about devotion.\n\nAs for me, count me out for crossover mania part tres. Why do we even need another one is anyone's guess? Well besides the guess being an apology letter for the Wish Gone Amiss episodes that didn't even have the characters interact with one another but just had a shooting star in each one.\n\nI didn't care for the Wish Gone Amiss episodes. They weren't even really *in continuity* (for whatever these shows have of it, anyway), they were all just dream sequences that Zack, Cory, and Miley had after wishing on the star.\n\nThen the 'That's So Suite Life of Hannah Montana' crossover was barely even that. Raven comes to the Tipton for two episodes is the only part that should have really counted. The only role Hannah Montana played was maybe a three second cameo from Ashley Tisdale, with the HM ep standing on it's own. It's like Suite Life and Raven were only going to crossover until some exec decided to shove Hannah Montana into things just for the hell of it when they realized it'd pull in the ratings.\n\nIf they wanted to do a real crossover, they should do them as DCOM's. They already proved they can do it by having various stars from HM, Wizards, etc. teaming up in Hatching Pete, Dadnapped, etc.\n\nSo why not have a movie Lily, Oliver, Newt, Max, London, you know, all the second/third bananas on their respective shows get together for an adventure?\n\nIf they wanted to do a real crossover, they should do them as DCOM's.

It would have to be something that no one would've expected the DCOS to do.\n\nAs for the films, no. I can't really see the whole DCOS meet DCOM. Zack and Cody think that HSM was just a movie and with Emily Osment seeing double, her as Lilly and her as her character from Dadnapped, that including the many other actors/actresses who would be seeing double such as Jason Earles Selena Gomez, Demi Lovato, and Mitchel Musso among others with their DCOS and DCOM counterparts would really just confuse people new to the shows and the hardcore fans."
