        "text": "Disney XD is going royal with a series order for the live-action comedy pilot “Pair of Kings.”\n\nThe series, which will start production in March for a fall premiere, stars “Hannah Montana” veteran Mitchel Musso and “House of Payne” regular Doc Shaw as 16-year-old fraternal twins (one white and one black). They are typical teenagers in Chicago raised by their aunt and uncle until they find out that they are heirs to the throne of the island of Kinkou; they relocate there to become kings.\n\nRounding out the cast are Geno Segers as the Royal Secretary, Kelsey Chow as his daughter and Ryan Ochoa as their disgruntled cousin and wannabe king.\n\n“Kings” was created by Dan Cross and Dave Hoge of the Disney XD flagship series “Aaron Stone.” The two will executive produce with Matt Wickline (“The Hughleys”).\n\nDon Beck serves as co-executive producer and Leo Clarke as producer.\n\nDoctors estimate the odds for a White and a Black fraternal twins to one in a million, with a couple of reports about such births in Europe making headlines last year.\n\nMusso, who is signed by Walt Disney Records, was a regular on “Hannah Montana” and might appear on the show’s upcoming fourth season, reprising his role as Oliver. He also voices a character on Disney Channel’s “Phineas and Ferb.”\n\nIn addition to his co-starring role on “Payne,” Shaw is a regular on Disney Channel’s “The Suite Life on Deck.”"
