        "text": "About the Show\n\nZack and Cody Martin and London Tipton checked out of their Boston hotel to embark on a new adventure -- a semester-at-sea aboard a luxurious cruise liner, the SS Tipton, with friend and classmate Bailey Pickett from Kettlecorn, Kansas. More often than not, their antics make cruise director Mr. Moseby want to walk the plank, in the \"The Suite Life on Deck,\" a spin-off of the hit Emmy-nominated series \"The Suite Life of Zack & Cody.\"\n\nIn the series, Zack and Cody set sail to cruise the world on the SS Tipton. In their midst are vacationers and students of Seven Seas High, the one school that London's dad thinks will make his spoiled daughter a better student. While out to sea, Zack and Cody have their compass pointed towards mischief as they take excursions to exciting locales including Greece, India, Italy and \"Licthenstamp\" and travel through the Bermuda Triangle.\n\nMeanwhile, hotel heiress London is living a \"fabu-less\" life when she realizes she's actually not on vacation aboard her daddy's ship, and instead must go to school and share a small stateroom. Her roommate, Bailey Pickett, is a sweet southern girl from Kettlecorn, Kansas, who's looking to expand her horizons but with her new friends, she winds up with more than she bargained for.\n\nMr. Moseby is expected to batten down the hatches as he navigates the growing pains and antics of Zack, Cody, London and Bailey. Whether it's teaching the boys a lesson for wasting their allowance or keeping them out of trouble on the ship's Skydeck where the tourists lounge, he's in for a long bumpy ride. Recurring characters are Ms. Tutweiller, the scrupulous school teacher, Woody, the quirky boy who befriends Zack and Cody, and Kirby, the upbeat ship security guard.\n\n\"The Suite Life on Deck\" stars Dylan Sprouse as Zack Martin, Cole Sprouse as Cody Martin, Brenda Song as London Tipton, Debby Ryan as Bailey Pickett and Phill Lewis as Mr. Moseby. Recurring cast members are Erin Cardillo as Ms. Tutweiller, Matthew Timmons as Woody and Windell Middlebrooks as Kirby.\n\nThe series is executive-produced by Pamela Eells O'Connell (\"Family Matters\") and Irene Dreayer (\"Sister, Sister,\" \"Smart Guy\"). \"The Suite Life on Deck\" is produced by It's A Laugh Productions for Disney Channel. It carries a TV-G parental guideline.\n\nList All Shows\n\nThe Suite Life on Deck Message Board\n\nWelcome to the \"The Suite Life on Deck\" Message Board - the place to discuss anything and everything about \"The Suite Life on Deck.\"\n\nFeel free to discuss the show in general, the individual episodes, the cast and characters, and any other aspect of the show.
