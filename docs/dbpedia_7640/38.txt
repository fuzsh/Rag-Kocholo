Dylan Sprouse greets his new roommate and new cast member Doc Shaw in this new still from The Suite Life on Deck.

In the upcoming episode “Roomies,” Zack’s (Sprouse) new roommate, Marcus (Shaw), moves in and there’s something mysterious about him. When the gang discovers that Marcus was a famous child singer, Zack takes the opportunity to show him what he missed as a “normal” kid growing up, and together they wreak havoc around the ship, forming a strong bond.

Meanwhile, when Cody (Cole Sprouse) and Bailey (Debby Ryan) engage in a friendly sports competition, it becomes obvious that Bailey rules the court.

“Roomies” premieres on Friday, October 16 @ 8PM ET/PT on Disney Channel.
