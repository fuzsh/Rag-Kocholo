        "text": "Description\n\nLeather Binding\n\nComplete in ten volumes. This work is a thorough biography looking at the life of the great Sir Walter Scott. Sir Walter Scott is best known today for his novels and poetry, including 'Ivanhoe' and 'The Lady of the Lake'. He wrote a lot about his birthplace of Scotland, though with his experiments in historical fiction, he expanded to writing about various places in England and Europe. Scott was also involved in re-discovering the Scottish crown jewels, after having been missing for over a hundred years. The regalia were rediscovered in 1818, when George IV, whilst he was still Regent, issued a warrant authorising Walter Scott to break down a wall in the Crown Room to try and find the regalia. They were discovered, and have been on display ever since. Written by J. G. Lockhart. Lockhart was the son-in-law of Scott, having married his eldest daughter. He is best known for this biography, which has been highly praised as the second best biography written in the English language, second of to James Boswell's 'Life of Johnson'. Volume I with a frontispiece, and Volumes II to X with a frontispiece and illustrated title page Folding plate to Volume VI, showing a facsimile of a page of the original manuscript of 'Ivanhoe'.\n\nCondition\n\nIn a half calf binding with marbled paper to the boards. Externally, smart. Light rubbing to the paper to the boards and to the extremities. A little loss of leather to the extremities, being a little heavier to Volumes VI, and VII. Volume X is lacking the bottom spine label, with slight loss boards, being significantly heavier to the front board. A little fading to the spines. Front hinge of Volume X is tender. Internally, firmly bound. Pages are bright with the odd scattered spot, heavier to the first and last few pages. Frontispiece Volume X working loose. Large tidemark to the first few pages of Volume X.\n\nOverall: Very Good"
