        "text": "But Scott did not just write about the Palace of Holyroodhouse and its royal connections in the past. He had royal connections of his own. In 1815 he was invited to supper at Carlton House with the Prince Regent, the future George IV. The two men shared a profound love of storytelling and would become lifelong friends and correspondents. Scott would appeal to the Prince Regent to grant permission to open a strong room in Edinburgh Castle in 1818, leading to the rediscovery of the Scottish Regalia – activities for which he received a baronetcy in 1820. The pair also shared a love of spectacle. In 1822, George IV visited the city of Edinburgh – the first visit to Scotland by a reigning monarch for nearly 200 years. Scott was chosen to organise the celebrations, and the visit was a tremendous assortment of ceremonies and processions. At the Palace of Holyroodhouse, the king took part in the ceremony of the keys. In David Wilkie’s painting of the occasion on the forecourt of the Palace, the Hereditary Keeper, Alexander, 10th Duke of Hamilton, is depicted presenting George IV with the keys to the city of Edinburgh, whilst Scott watches keenly from the far-left of the painting. The painting now hangs beneath the Great Stair at the Palace.\n\nSeveral further receptions and levees took place at the Palace of Holyroodhouse during the royal visit. Scott had encouraged members of the public to wear tartan during the festivities, and the king himself followed these instructions, wearing full Highland dress to his first levee at the Palace on 17 August 1822. George’s ensemble included the royal Stuart tartan for the jacket, shoulder plaid and kilt, a baldrick, a pair of Highland pistols, a Highland dirk, purse, and powder-horn. Supplied by George Hunter of Princes Street, the outfit cost £1,354.18s. A painting of the king in his Highland dress hangs in the Dining Room at the Palace today.\n\nDuring the course of this 250th anniversary year, we will explore Scott’s work, his royal connections, and his exploration of the history of the Palace of Holyroodhouse in short talks, activities and more. Check this page and follow us on social media to keep up to date as we explore this fascinating figure, the courtly characters represented in his works and his royal readership."
