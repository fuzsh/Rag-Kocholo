Shaw, 1996.\n\n* * *\n\nSir Walter Scott's stories are a by-product of his novels. He used them as a way of presenting materials of recollection or oral history that the novels had not required. Thus in the stories he is often closer to his actual sources than he is in longer works. Especially after his final revelation as \"the author of Waverley \" in February 1827, when he no longer had need to cover his tracks, he was willing to admit his sources and name his informants. The result was Chronicles of the Canongate, in which most of his notable stories are found (except for \"Wandering Willie's Tale\" in Redgauntlet).\n\nBut the end of anonymity did not mean the end of invented mouthpieces. He devotes considerable space to the delineation of the imaginary editor, Chrystal Croftangry, and the narrator, Mrs. Bethune Baliol, who was based on Mrs. Murray Keith (of whom he supplies a long genealogy). J. G. Lockhart, Scott's biographer, however, believed that features of Scott's own mother were intermingled with those of Mrs. Baliol.\n\nHere the frame (the depiction of the narrator's character) is as important as the story she tells. Her sharp meditations on class conceptions of honor reflect on the heroic and aristocratic world about which Scott wrote so much. Her Jacobitism is wavering and eclectic, part sentiment and part sober judgment, perhaps like the author himself.\n\nThe first story in Chronicles, \"The Highland Widow,\" is one of Scott's finest, memorably encapsulating the clash of cultures that is also the theme of the best of the novels. A chain of memories and family connections take us back to the rebellion of 1745. Elspat MacTavish is a demented solitary with a long brooding memory of a dead husband and son. The husband had lived the life of a cattle-raider; the son has to earn his living in the new Hanoverian world, and he unwillingly enlists as a soldier. The idea of being flogged for discipline is more terrible both to mother and son than the idea of execution. The latter can be endured with dignity; the former seems to reduce a man to the level of a dog. His mother taunts him with \"Hanover's Yoke,\" betrayal of the Stuarts, and even with the terrible tradition of the massacre of Glencoe, of whose perpetrators she considers his new masters the heirs. The mother's view of honor is simple; the son's, because he is a man of two worlds, is ambiguous. He partly shares his mother's view, but he is troubled also by his promise to serve the king as a soldier.\n\nThe climax comes when a party of soldiers arrests him for desertion, and, prompted by his mother, he fires and kills the sergeant who had befriended him. It is characteristic of Scott that the reader's dominant impression is not of these moments of drama but of the dreary aftermath, of the long years in which the widow is left to brood on the past and to remain as a living anachronism. In \"My Aunt Margaret's Mirror\" a woman, tormented by fears about her absent husband, goes to a sorcerer who shows her an image of her husband in a bigamous marriage ceremony abroad. After the deserted wife's death her sister is confronted with the erring husband in disguise, begging for forgiveness, which is refused after an inner struggle. Thus a moral issue invades a story of the marvelous. A deeper, meditative note also is introduced in the conflict between religion and superstition in Aunt Margaret's mind.\n\n\"The Tapestried Chamber\" is the least remarkable of these stories, because it lacks the element of suspense. A visitor is put to sleep in a long-disused room in a great house; he is troubled by a vision of a ferocious hag, whose face he later recognizes in his host's picture gallery, and he hears the history of the ancestress guilty of incest and murder. By making the terrified visitor a general and brave soldier, Scott enforces the idea that spiritual terrors are far less bearable than earthly ones.\n\nScott, perhaps deliberately, sacrificed that formal tautness of the storyteller's art, as we find in craftsmen like Kipling, for the realistic atmosphere of a story actually told, hence his great stress on the memories and personality of the storyteller and on the questions and inner sensations of the listener. And by linking stories together, employing the same narrators again and again, he contrives to give an impression of a great store of oral tradition from which he is selecting specimens. The stories are meant to supplement each other and coalesce to give a picture of manners, traditions, and superstitions in a society that was passing away. And as such, they form a valuable pendant to his major works.\n\n—A. O. J. Cockshut"
