        "text": "The first novel called ' Waverley\" was signed, dedicated and inscribed to the original owner Mrs Sarah Phyn in 1830 and a hand written letter also signed by Sir Walter Scott from Abbotsford 29th October 1830 accompanied the treasure. This book is special because it was the precursor to literary change in the world. In one fell swoop, Walter Scott had invented a brand new style which was to become the archetype of the historical novel throughout the world.\n\nThis series of books was to influence generations of writers and earned Walter Scott his well earned reputation as the founder of the historical novel.\n\n*Best known works amongst this series. You will know them: Ivanhoe, Rob Roy, Keniworth, the Pirate, the Abbot, Tales of the Crusaders\n\nBiography of Sir Walter Scott:\n\nBorn the son of an Edinburgh lawyer, Walter Scott was born in College Wynd, Edinburgh at the top of Guthrie Street and was raised at 25 George Square, where the family lived until the death of Walter Scott, Senior.\n\nThe young Walter Scott attended the Royal High School and the University of Edinburgh and was called to the bar in 1792.\n\nWalter Scott married Charlotte Mary Carpenter in 1797 and moved to a house in Castle Street, Edinburgh before moving to Ashestiel on the Tweed in 1804.\n\n< Abbotsford on the Tweed, which became Sir Walter Scotts country home was purchased in 1812.\n\nWalter Scott continued his legal career, at the same time making his name as a collector and editor of ballads ( Minstrelsy of the Scottish Border ), 3 vols 1802-1803) and a poet ( Lay of the Last Minstrel , 1805, etc.); he was a lifelong friend and collaborator of James Hogg ('The Ettrick Shepherd') and of Professor John Wilson ('Christopher North').\n\nIn 1812 Walter Scott became a partner in James Ballantyne's printing business in 1809 and purchased the house, Abbotsford on the Tweed.\n\nIn 1829,at Abbotsford on the Tweed, Sir Walter Scott wrote the general preface to the Waverley Novels as part of the 'Magnum Opus,' the definitive version of the Waverley Novels.\n\nSir Walter Scott remains one of Scotland's greatest men of letters. His influence was as far reaching as his works were commercially successful - His poetry earned him an offer of the laureateship, which he refused and was considered totally original in style among the Romantics\n\nWalter Scotts first novels (\"Waverley\", 1814, etc.) were published anonymously, but he had to use the security of his copyrights, as well as the publication of the later novels, to meet the debts incurred as a result of the failure in 1826 of 'Constable and Ballantyne,' his publisher as well as his business partner.\n\nWalter Scott masterminded the visit to Edinburgh in 1822 of King George IV and did much to create the historically romantic image of Scotland enjoyed by the Victorians and later generations.\n\nJohn BALLANTYNE (1774-1821), was the printer of the Waverley novels\n\nNovels By Sir Walter Scott\n\nThe Eve of St. John (1800)\n\nMinstrelsy of the Scottish Border (1803)\n\nThe Lay of the Last Minstrel (1805)\n\nMarmion (1808)\n\nThe Lady in the Lake (1810)\n\nThe Bridal of Triermain (1813)\n\nRokeby (1813)\n\nHalidon Hill (1822)\n\nChronicles of the Canongate (1827)\n\nCastle Dangerous (1831)\n\nCollections: By Sir Walter Scott\n\nBallads and Lyrical Pieces (1806)\n\nSelected Poems (poems) (1972)\n\nThe Supernatural Stories of Sir Walter Scott (1977)\n\nNon fiction: By Sir Walter Scott\n\nThe Life of Napoleon Buonaparte, Emperor of the\n\nFrench (1827)\n\nWaverley Anecdotes: Illustrating some of the Popular Characters, Scenes and Incidents in the Novels and Romances of Sir Walter Scott (1890)\n\nAnthologies containing stories by Sir Walter Scott\n\nA Century of Thrillers: From Poe to Arlen (1934)\n\nThe Mystery Book (1934)\n\nThe Great Book of Thrillers (1935)\n\nA Century of Ghost Stories (1936)\n\nGreat British Tales of Terror: Gothic Stories of Horror\n\nand Romance 1765-1840 (1972)\n\nThe 12th Fontana Book of Great Ghost Stories (1976)\n\nThe Penguin Book of Ghost Stories (1984)\n\nGreat Short Stories of the World (1986)\n\nThe World's Library of Best Books Volume Two (1989)\n\nThe Open Door: And Other Ghost Stories (1990)\n\nFantastic Tales: Visionary and Everyday (1993)\n\nVampires, Wine and Roses (1997)\n\n100 Twisted Little Tales of Torment (1998)\n\nSubjective books about Sir Walter Scott\n\nThe Laird of Abbotsford: A View of Sir Walter Scott (1980) by A N Wilson\n\nThe Civilized Imagination: A Study of Ann Radcliffe, Jane Austen, and Sir Walter Scott (1985) by Daniel Cottom"
