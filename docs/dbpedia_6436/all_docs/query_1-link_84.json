A spat between wealthy, young Isabel Amberson and her beau, the brash inventor, Eugene Morgan, launches a chain of events that will haunt two families for generations in Orson Welles classic The Magnificent Ambersons. After quarreling with Eugene (Joseph Cotton), Isabel (Dolores Costello) marries a man she does not love and devotes her life to her son, George (Tim Holt). Over the years, Eugene becomes a millionaire in the new automobile industry; George grows into an insufferable young man; and Eugene and Isabel, both widowed, resume their relationship. Eugene proposes to Isabel, but George, who has never had to work, disdains the self-made Eugene. He bars his mother from seeing the one man she has ever loved. Yet, even though George has prevented Eugene from ever marrying Isabel, Eugene rescues George when tragedy strikes the Amberson family.",

        "text": "Despite its faults, The Magnificent Ambersons stands tall as an example of great filmmaking. The performances, Wellesâ€™s direction, and the production design make this picture worth your viewing.\n\nFebruary 20, 2024\n\nAfter the neorealistic revolution of Citizen Kane's cinematographic achievement, then, The Magnificent Ambersons becomes the consecration, in some sort of stripped-down and ultimately classical way, of a new mode of screen narration.\n\nDecember 8, 2021\n\nThe Magnificent Ambersons is a deliciously photographed time capsule, with Albert S. D'Agostino's impressive set designs belying the craftsmanship and detail which went into recreating turn-of-the-century Indianapolis.\n\nAugust 18, 2020\n\nWelles has a knack for heart-rending stories rife with comeuppance, tragedy, remembrance, doomed romance, and, most superbly, the pleasures of forgiveness and closure.\n\nAugust 13, 2020\n\nTrue, there are wonderful authentic period touches, excellent dramatic photographic work and fine direction of a wonderful cast. Welles has employed so much subtlety, however... that the resultant effect is vague and even meaninglessly depressing.\n\nJuly 24, 2020\n\nFilm snobs like to say that this, the second feature from Orson Welles, is even better than Citizen Kane. That's a stretch, but it's certainly exquisitely beautiful film-making - there are frames in there to die for.\n\nDecember 13, 2019\n\nOrson Welles continues to be incredible, super original, and an unsurpassable artist from the beginning to the end of the movie. [Full Review in Spanish]\n\nSeptember 17, 2019\n\nIn trying so feverishly to be realistic, Welles has drained the life pretty much out of the Indiana family of whom Tarkington once wrote so straight-forwardly that he won a Pulitzer prize for his efforts.\n\nAugust 9, 2019\n\nThe Magnificent Ambersons may not coalesce into a fully-realized masterwork ... but it doesn't need to be when it appropriately becomes about far more than its narrative.\n\nApril 23, 2019"
