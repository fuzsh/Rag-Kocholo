        "text": "HAPPY BIRTHDAY, ORSON! Film Festival\n\nBUY TICKETS NOW\n\nThe Modern Art Museum of Fort Worth joins with the Lone Star Film Society in celebrating the one hundredth birthday of American film legend Orson Welles. His first film, Citizen Kane, which he co-wrote, produced, directed, and starred in when he was only twenty-five years old, continues to be hailed as a masterpiece and is considered by many to be the best film ever made. Well known for his baritone voice, Welles was an award-winning actor in radio and film and a celebrated Shakespearean stage actor. In 2002, he was voted the greatest film director of all time in two British Film Institute polls among directors and critics, and a wide survey of critical consensus, best-of lists, and historical retrospectives call him the most acclaimed director of all time.\n\nScreenings will be held in the Modern’s auditorium. Tickets are $9, $7 for Modern members, and $6 for Modern Reel People and Lone Star members. Tickets may be purchased online here and in person at the Modern's information desk.\n\nSPECIAL GUESTS:\n\nDr. Joan McGettigan will introduce several of the films and host a Q&A after the screening of Citizen Kane. She is an Associate Professor in TCU’s Bob Schieffer College of Communication, teaching courses in film history and critical film studies.\n\nDr. Rick Worland, Professor of Film & Media Arts at the Meadows School of the Arts, Southern Methodist University will introduce The Lady From Shanghai.\n\nDr. Robert Jack Anderson worked in various capacities in Hollywood primarily at Twentieth Century Fox and Tri-Star Pictures producing ENID IS SLEEPING and ANOTHER YOU. He is currently an assistant professor at Tarleton State University focusing on the art of the moving image. This summer he spent 33 days in Italy filming the Tarleton Honors Study Abroad program in Urbino, Italy. This was the fifth European study abroad documentary for the University.\n\nSCHEDULE:\n\nThursday, September 3; 6 pm\n\nOpening Reception (cash bar)\n\nThursday, September 3; 7 pm\n\nCITIZEN KANE, 1941\n\nThis epic tale of a publishing tycoon's rise and fall is a landmark achievement considered by many to be the greatest film ever made.\n\nIntroduction by Dr. Joan McGettigan, with Q&A to follow.\n\n119 minutes; PG\n\nFriday, September 4; 6 pm\n\nTHE MAGNIFICENT AMBERSONS, 1942\n\nNominated for four Academy Awards, including Best Picture, Welles wrote, directed, and narrated this tale of the spoiled young heir to the decaying Amberson fortune who comes between his widowed mother and the man she has always loved.
