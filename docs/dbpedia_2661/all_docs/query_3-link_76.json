        "text": "\"I said, 'Listen baby, I’m not interested in the most beautiful woman and all the glamour; I want somebody real and I want somebody messy, kind of on the edge,'\" the director-producer recalled. \"I wanted to see another side of her.\"\n\nHis unusual approach worked, and 44-year-old Lopez, who was going through a divorce from husband Marc Anthony and having a difficult time emotionally, signed on to co-star with Jason Statham.\n\n\"She could have said, 'Well, thanks, Taylor, so long,' but she didn’t,\" said the 68-year-old director. \"I think it was because I said I didn’t want her beauty, I wanted something else, that she did the movie.\"\n\nParker is the first crime thriller in Hackford’s vastly diverse oeuvre, although, he says, he has been a fan of the genre for many years, dating back to Point Blank, which starred Lee Marvin and was the first of many movies based on the Parker books.\n\n\"The wonderful thing about Parker is that he is completely unapologetic about what he does. He’s a thief, he’s capable of extreme violence but he’s not a psychopath. He only steals from people who can afford the loss.\"\n\nWe met at a poolside party in Beverly Hills and talked a few days later in a hotel suite in Los Angeles. The bearded, courtly Hackford sipped from a cup of tea and talked eloquently of filmmaking, music and his life with his Oscar-winning wife Helen Mirren.\n\nHis promotional duties for Parker were keeping him in California while Mirren was in London rehearsing for Peter Morgan’s play The Audience (opening next week), in which she again plays the Queen.\n\nThey met in 1985, when he cast her in his movie White Nights, and were married on New Year’s Eve 1997 in Scotland. The couple divide their time between a home in Los Angeles and a Georgian house by the Thames in Wapping.\n\nTheir work schedules often keep them apart, and Hackford’s duties as president of the Directors' Guild of America mean he has to spend a certain amount of time in California.\n\n\"Helen is just a fantastic partner for me and I was very lucky in finding my true mate in life,\" he said.\n\n\"She’s the real deal. She’s very witty and can use her humour and so on but she’s a serious artist. You get a clarity and an honesty from Helen which is only more real when you live with her. The great thing about her is that she’s defied Hollywood, which is tyranny for actresses. When they’re young and beautiful they have a career, and as they get older, it gets less. With my wife it’s been different. She’s continued to blossom and be celebrated, which is fantastic.\"\n\nSince his documentary Bukowski earned him acclaim in 1973 and his Teenage Father won an Oscar for best short film in 1978, Hackford has produced and directed feature films exploring a wide variety of subjects, including the sudsy An Officer and a Gentleman, an adaptation of Stephen King’s novel Dolores Claiborne, and the Satanic-influenced The Devil’s Advocate.\n\nBut he has fared best with musical biographies based on the lives of rock and roll pioneers such as Ritchie Valens in La Bamba, Chuck Berry in Hail! Hail! Rock’n’ Roll and Ray Charles in Ray, which was 15 years in the making and earned him an Oscar nomination.\n\nAll his movies have at least one thing in common: \"I make films about working-class people because that’s where I come from,\" he said. “My code as a filmmaker is to always do something I’m passionate about, not do something just because it’s offered. And that’s hard in this business because there are trends, and if you don’t want to go with the trend you may not be working. An actor does maybe three films a year but when a director does a film it takes two years if you’re lucky, so if you get on that train, you’d better love it and you’d better have something to say.\n\n\"Only one thing attracts me to a project and that’s the script. I read the script for Parker and I was sold. It’s an intelligent action picture full of intrigue and strong characterisations. I saw an opportunity to try my hand at doing a tough crime piece and the thing I loved about Parker was that he has a set of rules he follows and he has a certain integrity.\"\n\nFor his next project he is hoping to return to the field of musical biographies and is talking with Aretha Franklin, who was at her peak in the 1960s and early Seventies, about producing and directing a movie based on her life.\n\n\"Music defines us in so many ways, and the period when I came of age in the Sixties was a very fertile time. It's when America and society changed and I don’t believe that time period is replicated today.\n\n\"Yes, there’s popular music and there are very talented people, but in terms of music really affecting our lives in social ways, I think that time period of the late Fifties, Sixties and Seventies is kind of crucial.\""
