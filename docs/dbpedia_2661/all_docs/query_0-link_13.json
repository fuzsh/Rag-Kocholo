        "text": "Biographers are notorious for falling out of love with their subjects as they spend weeks, months, years, researching every small detail of their lives, only to discover that the person they once idolised was as prone to human frailties as the rest of us. You couldn't blame Taylor Hackford, director of Ray, if he ended up feeling the same, having spent a good part of the last 15 years trying to get the life story of Ray Charles onto the big screen.\n\nBut Hackford already knew all about the dark side of Charles's life before he started the project; his 20-year heroin addiction, serial womanising and the stories of his mistreatment of colleagues, friends and fellow musicians are well known. And anyway, Charles's life was so extraordinary, and his talents so beguiling, that he could easily be forgiven a few lapses in his personal life. Charles's last album before his death in 2004, Genius Loves Company, was pretty apt - he certainly did enjoy company, not all of it good.\n\nDespite the obvious appeal of the narrative arc of Charles's life - from grinding poverty in the Deep South to international superstardom, with blindness, drugs and plenty of sex thrown in - studio executives weren't overly keen on the idea of a biopic. As Hackford says: \"You have to understand I heard everything, from 'nobody remembers Ray Charles,' to 'young people aren't interested,' 'African-American films don't sell overseas,' and 'biopics belong on television'.\" The director has every reason to feel a little smug about his perseverance: \"After having been told no, and having all these people say it wouldn't work, Ray is now the third-highest DVD in sales in the US this year.\" Given that the two films ahead of it, The Incredibles and Shark Tale, are both children's movies, which traditionally do well on DVD, the success of Ray is all the more impressive.\n\nThe making of the film is almost as intriguing as the story itself. Having thought that he would have to give up entirely, a saviour appeared from the unlikeliest of sources. Billionaire Philip Anschutz, a long-time fan of Ray Charles's music, offered to fund the project, with just a few conditions: as a religious conservative he didn't want any sex or swearing. Hackford initially said no, reasoning, \"you can make PG-13 films on any subject, but this is a man who was a heroin addict for 20 years and slept with a different women every night. It's the wrong subject\".\n\n\"I walked away from the project not once but twice,\" adds Hackford, \"because he [Anschutz] now had the rights and he was determined to make sure that it couldn't be an R-rated movie. I make R-rated movies, so I left.\n\n\"The person who made me come back was Ray Charles. He said, 'Taylor, you're a fool. You struggled for 13 years and I stayed with you and now you're walking away from this film? This guy wants to make the film ... and, hey man, I never said fuck in the 50s. I do now. I didn't then'.\"\n\nHackford convinced himself that artists \"have been censored for centuries and still were able to communicate sex and everything else,\" and decided to take Anschutz's money. He delivered a film that expresses the highs and lows of Charles's heroin use, his womanising and the rough-and-ready feel of the clubs where he learned his trade, but without graphic sex scenes or Pulp Fiction-style drug-taking.\n\n\"It is ironic that a film like this should have been funded by a moral conservative. But, he was straight about his beliefs and, once we agreed, he left me alone. That's much better than having somebody who believes they've got an artistic point of view, who tries to meddle with you,\" says Hackford. And, in the end, \"it's a sexy film and a tough film\".\n\nThat's not to say the film hasn't had its critics. When it was released in the cinema last year, David Ritz, co-author of Charles's autobiography, accused Hackford and his writer James L White of sentimentalising the story and ignoring some of the more unsavoury aspects of his life. It's not an accusation that bothers the director, though he suggests that some of the scenes, which are available on the DVD, should have been in the cinema: \"I think this is more of a definitive version. The additional scenes are darker, more complex explorations of the character of Ray Charles.\"\n\nAnd, of course, there's the film's real draw: Jamie Foxx's Oscar-winning performance as the main man. Here, Hackford struck gold; Foxx doesn't just capture the musician's rolling gait and vocal mannerisms, he really seems to be Ray Charles. And, luckily for Hackford, Foxx was classically trained as a pianist, so you have none of those awful cut-away shots so typical of musical biopics, where you know the hands playing the piano don't belong to the actor. Indeed, Hackford seems to relish showing that Foxx is actually playing the right notes, even if the music is taken from old recordings. So good is Foxx as Ray Charles that you can be forgiven for thinking you're watching a documentary.\n\nThis is less surprising when you consider Hackford's own career. Best known for blockbuster thrillers The Devil's Advocate and Proof of Life, Hackford began as a documentary-maker for public TV in Los Angeles. This grounding in factual film-making has informed his work in the movies. \"Because of where I started and because of what I care about, when I'm making a film I take a huge amount of effort to [get the details right] ... whether the audience knows the difference or not, I know the difference. And, to me, one of the things I'm most proud of in Ray is those early club scenes. I looked at old photographs and visited some of the clubs.\n\n\"This wasn't a concert hall where you appreciated the art. You had to get people out of their seats dancing. They had to work out their demons, they had to sweat and have a great time because they had to get up to these bone-crushing jobs the next day.\" To get the feel of these clubs, \"the people, the extras, the costumes, the look, the dancing had as much to do with it as the music because you understand how the music works by seeing the people moving and I think those were things that ... give a great deal of credence to what the scenes are about.\"\n\nHackford was sensitive to the fact that he had to get this right, because of the potential pitfalls when a white man directs the life story of a black hero. \"Jamie was my partner on this. I had an entirely African-American cast and I chose an African-American writer. I wrote the story, but Jimmy White wrote the dialogue and the script. I listened to those people and tried to capture the African-American ethos. That was really important to me.\n\n\"I know, because the film was really embraced by the black audience, that we succeeded. That was my goal - I wanted the general audience to see it, but mostly I was looking to have the African-American audience to embrace this as a true evocation of the black experience.\"\n\nNow that his mission to bring Ray Charles to the big screen is well and truly past him, Hackford is lining up his next project. \"I'm working on a contemporary adaptation of Carmen,\" he says. \"Not the Bizet opera, but a contemporary thing in the Latino barrios of New York and Puerto Rico.\" I ask him what stage it's at. \"Well, it took 15 years to do Ray, so ... but I've got a script I've turned in, and I'm hoping they say yes.\" Perhaps there's a certain moral conservative he might end up receiving a call from."
