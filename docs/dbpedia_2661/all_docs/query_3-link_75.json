        "text": "Rihanna may not have come out with any new music, but she is thinking about her legacy. While attending her Fenty Hair launch earlier this week, the beauty mogul was asked by E! News who she would like love to see play her in a biopic.\n\nWhich Actress Does Rihanna Want to Play Her in a Biopic?\n\nThe mother of two (and soon-to-be three) tells the publication she would love Canadian actress Taylor Russell to “pretend to be me.” Russell, who is known for her starring role in BONES AND ALL opposite Timothee Chalamet, possesses all the attributes the “Bitch Better Have My Money” singer seeks.\n\nAs for what qualities Rih-Rih specifically likes about Russell starring as her in a biopic is simple: “Because she’s got a nice forehead and she’s fly and I feel like I want to be her, so I want her to pretend to be me.” Rihanna adds that she wants people to perceive her in “that light” that Russell’s beauty exudes.\n\nRELATED: Rihanna Sparks Music Retirement Rumors\n\n29-year-old Russell also has experience singing. In an interview with W magazine last year, she recalled singing a Destiny’s Child song when she was 13 years old. “I don’t know why I decided to do that because it was really embarrassing. I wasn’t into it at that moment, I would do it now, though.”\n\nWatch the interview below:\n\nMeanwhile, Rihanna’s hair care brand, Fenty Hair, launched Thursday (June 13). As Rih-Rih stepped out at her launch event in her natural hair and with the promotional photo of her wig getting washed, fans couldn’t help but mock her for her latest Fenty venture on social media.\n\nOne TikTok creator made fun of Rihanna’s haircare line in a viral video earlier this month. She stated: “Rih-Rih, I love you — I really do. But I’m not buying no haircare products from a bitch who got two scoops of hair.” She adds that she’s never seen a “curl on your scalp.”\n\nIn a follow-up video, the same TikToker admitted that Fenty Hair is probably going to do great, but she isn’t going to buy them. She joked she wouldn’t even steal them either after seeing Rihanna rock her natural hair, “That’s how you know it might not even be worth all that. I’m not even about to steal it.”\n\nLaila Abuelhawa is the Top 40 and Hip-Hop pop culture writer for Beasley Media Group.
