        "text": "ENJOY THE MOVIES\n\nKevin's Review: Zack and Miri Make a Porno - In a Way, Just Like Real Porn\n\nAnalyzing Kevin Smith's Zack and Miri Make a Porno feels remarkably similar to what it must be like to review an actual porno. The film has baseline appeal, so the only question is whether it's really good or really bad. The film has a built-in draw since Smith mated his universe with Judd Apatow's, creating a cast and context that definitely gets you excited. But like most adult films, Zack and Miri serves a solitary purpose of providing a good time. Smith hits this low bar pretty easily, delivering punching, raunchy lines the likes of a headboard rapping against a wall. But for all the raucous obscenities and those fan-favorites delivering them, Zack and Miri is an adult film that delivers pretty much what's on the box.\n\nJoaquin Phoenix Retiring from Acting Completely?!\n\nAt a benefit for Paul Newman this past Monday, 34-year-old actor Joaquin Phoenix told the show \"Extra\" that he's retiring from acting to focus on music. I don't know about you, but this is a real bummer in my mind. From To Die For to Buffalo Soldiers to Walk the Line to Reservation Road (even 8MM), I've always enjoyed the guy and thought he was pretty damn talented. He also seems to have a knack for music, however, too. His work on the soundtrack to Walk the Line won him a Grammy. And presently, he's recording an album with Tim Burgess, lead singer of The Charlatans. If time proves this to be true - but you probably shouldn't question him on the veracity of his statement - let's hope he sticks around in the public eye, and doesn't pursue music like other actor-turned-musician hacks. I won't name names.\n\nRumor: Ridley Scott Acquires Werewolf Script?\n\nIs Ridley Scott going to apply his cinematic sensibilities to the subject of werewolves? The news is oddly timely considering that Halloween is right around the corner, but that's just what Blood Disgusting is reporting. And even though we chase news from time to time, following the legendary director's movements like a stalker is just something we have to do, even if the development is big on surprise and light on details. Apparently Death Sentence scribe Ian Jeffers, who also rewrote the script for the upcoming adaptation of Castlevania, has sold an original story to Scott surrounding everyone's favorite full-moon critters. The first question we need to ask: Will Scott direct or produce the rumored project?\n\nKevin's Review: Changeling - Not The Film You Think\n\nI think it's safe to say that most expect Clint Eastwood's Changeling to be the next Million Dollar Baby. After all, Eastwood directed both, and instead of Hilary Swank front and center, it's now Angelina Jolie as single mother Christine Collins. Both films maintain a studied focus on the lead heroine and the events that surround her, but that's where the similarities end. While Baby was a delicate, heart-breaking gem made rich by a simple story and amazing performances, Changeling is quite the opposite - sprawling in its scale, with drama that is derived from the story's details, which are largely based on true events. While Changeling can wear the badge of \"stranger than fiction\" proudly, it's definitely no Million Dollar Baby.\n\nCheck This Out: David Goyer's The Unborn Official Poster\n\n\"It wants to be born. Now!\" Well, more like January 9th of next year, when Dark Knight-scribe David Goyer's new horror film The Unborn hits theaters. And ahead of that release we now have the official poster (in addition to the trailer that surfaced a few weeks back) thanks to our friends at Bloody Disgusting. As we've mentioned before, The Unborn is about a soul that is attempting to inhabit another body. Goyer twists that a bit in that this spirit is a pretty malevolent one - the stillborn twin of lead character Casey (Odette Yustman). The poster is a solid one, and holds up to the excitement from the trailer pretty well.\n\nQuarantine Duo Tapped for Shyamalan's Night Chronicles\n\nWhile the man definitely incites raucous opinion of his work, M. Night Shyamalan will probably find a happy consensus around news that his trio of thrillers titled Night Chronicles are officially off and running. Shortly after The Happening hit theaters, it was announced that his next project would be a series of movies for which he would create the central premise, and then pass the idea off to suitable writers and directors; that news probably couldn't have come at a better time, considering the vitriol that surrounded The Happening (18% on Rotten Tomatoes). Word from Bloody Disgusting is that they've found adoptive parents for the first film - the guys behind the recently released Quarantine, John and Drew Dowdle.\n\nTaylor Hackford Tries to Find Love Ranch a Home\n\nIt seems odd that director Taylor Hackford would be peddling his latest project to studios like a door-to-door salesmen. The guy was behind Ray, after all, which garnered Jamie Foxx an Oscar for Best Actor; he also helmed Proof of Life, Devil's Advocate and Dolores Claiborne. In short, he seems a pretty bankable guy. So will a studio swoop in and pick up distribution rights to his indie drama Love Ranch and make this article outdated before it's published? Maybe. Hackford actually took this same approach for Ray, completing the film himself before approaching studios. We'll see if it works this time around.\n\nUnman Remake - The 'Next Disturbia' on the Way?\n\nDisturbia was a surprisingly successful thriller that is probably my favorite Shia LaBeouf film to date (there aren't many). Instead of making a sequel - a path we all know profitable properties like to travel - director D.J. Caruso and LaBeouf went on to make Eagle Eye. And while a rumor has surfaced today via Bloody Disgusting that DreamWorks is eying their \"next Disturbia,\" the potential project is by no means a sequel. Instead, the studio apparently wants to remake the 1971 Austrian thriller Unman, Wittering and Zigo. The film surrounds a 9th grade prep school class whose teacher is murdered. The new teacher that is brought in as a result begins to discover the class' secret - they were behind the murder.\n\nTwilight is Officially Getting a Sequel - Are You Worried?\n\nI should have seen this coming had I been paying attention to the Twilight madness, which is bordering on an epic frenzy in anticipation of the film. Deadline Hollywood is telling us that Summit Entertainment has already lined up a sequel (presumably titled New Moon after the second book in the series), which actually surfaced as a rumor much earlier this year. This should really come as no surprise, considering Twilight has a following that is surprising (if not scary) to most. I'm certainly not cheering at this news, but not for the reason you might think. Twilight is certainly not my bag. Nevertheless, it's always a bit sad when you see a creative property hooked up to the corporate machine and bled dry. So while most fans will see this announcement of a sequel as the second-coming, I say you should be a bit worried. Here's why.\n\nKevin's Review: Body of Lies - Probably the Best Thriller of Its Kind\n\nPost-9/11 thrillers have come and gone over the years, but none have ever really gotten the recipe right. The Kingdom is too heavy on action; Traitor tries to be too smart; and there's just no redeeming Rendition. It's easy to say that Ridley Scott's Body of Lies is a bit tardy, but I'd prefer to describe the film's entrance into this growing genre as fashionably late. With Scott at the helm, and Leonardo DiCaprio and Russell Crowe as leads, Body of Lies is a blockbuster both on paper and in execution. The truth is, it's taken a visionary like Ridley Scott to combine the right ingredients in such a way as to create the only truly compelling film of its kind that, despite dealing with combustible topics, manages not to destroy itself.\n\nMust Watch: David Goyer's The Unborn Trailer!\n\nThe Unborn, written and directed by Dark Knight-scribe David S. Goyer, has been given a damn impressive first trailer. If you recall, Goyer spoke at length about his \"old school horror movie,\" which is, in part, based on a bit of Jewish folklore. The film surrounds a girl that must fight off a spirit that attempts to inhabit her body, lest that spirit be reborn causing the living girl to wander the netherworld in its place. The plot seems approachable enough, and with Gary Oldman involved as a spiritual advisor, I'm totally on board. Don't let Michael Bay's name scare you off as this might actually be a hit for Platinum Dunes - some of these scenes and effects look top-notch. Check out the trailer and let me know what you think!\n\nJamie Foxx Joining Gerard Butler in Law Abiding Citizen\n\nDirector Frank Darabont's next project, Law Abiding Citizen, could have Gerard Butler and Jamie Foxx going head-to-head. We learned earlier this year that Butler would play one of the leads - a successful D.A. targeted by a grief-stricken husband out for revenge following a plea deal that set one of the killers of his daughter and wife free. Foxx will play the vigilante husband. If you're a fan of \"Law and Order\" you know that going after the lawyer is rarely a smart (or effective) move. Being that Foxx's character is set to cross conventional vigilante lines, Law Abiding Citizen certainly has an air of intrigue."
