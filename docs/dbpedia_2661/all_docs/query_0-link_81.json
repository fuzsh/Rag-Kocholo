Cocking his head sideways, walking and talking in cadences familiar to anyone who ever saw the man in concert or on television, Foxx is uncanny. It's a performance that goes well beyond mimicry. It's lived-in. It's empathic. It's practically telepathic. The guy who engraves those Oscar statuettes can get a jump on things right now, if he wants to.\n\nSo it's a shame about \"Ray,\" because Foxx is trapped in a movie that takes the music icon's unique story and turns it into cheesy, sentimental American Dream cliches.\n\nDirector Taylor Hackford, who worked with the jazz/R&B/country/pop star for 15 years in an effort to get his story on film, might have been too close to his subject. Charles' heroin addiction and womanizing aren't downplayed, exactly, but they become genericized. Yeah, he popped needles into his veins and sired a mess of illegitimate children, but that's just life on the road, right?\n\nThat's what's so wrong with \"Ray\" - that Hackford, who produced the similarly templated 1987 Richie Valens biopic, \"La Bamba,\" does nothing writing-wise nor stylistically to bring sophistication and nuance to the telling of the tale.\n\nThe amazing plot points of Charles' biography (and they are amazing) get muted by less than extraordinary narrative devices, and less than extraordinary casting. (Those guys playing Atlantic Records music execs Ahmet Ertegun and Jerry Wexler - you've got to be kidding!)\n\nCharles' determination in the face of daunting obstacles was, indeed, awe-inspiring. But it would have been nice to have less awe from the filmmakers.\n\nThe performer - who died four months ago at age 73 - was born in poverty, in rural Georgia. He witnessed the freak drowning of his brother and was tortured with guilt because of it. He lost his sight shortly thereafter, when he was 7, and was sent to a state-run school for the blind by a hard-toiling mother (Sharon Warren) who could have written the handbook on tough love.\n\nBy 17, he was touring the chitlin circuit as pianist in Lowell Fulson's band, enduring the indignities of racism, learning to fend for himself when it came to money (he insisted on being paid in $1 bills, so he couldn't be cheated) and women. He crosses paths with a scrappy Quincy Jones and comes into his own in the 1950s, thanks to his young wife, Della Bea (Kerry Washington), who urged him to jettison his chameleonlike vocal skills (he could mimic any of the day's hitmakers) and develop his own inimitable sound.\n\nA savvy businessman and a sorry excuse for a parent and spouse, Charles broke down both racial and musical barriers in his decades-spanning, stellar career.\n\nThere's something else, apart from Foxx's portrayal, that saves the film from utter mediocrity: the music. Using Charles' original recordings - some familiar, others newly unearthed - \"Ray\" boasts a glorious songbook of rhythm-and-blues, bop, boogie, jazz, country and pure pop.\n\nIt's the soundtrack of a life, quite literally.\n\n___\n\nRAY\n\n2 stars\n\nProduced by Howard Baldwin, Karen Baldwin, Taylor Hackford and Stuart Benjamin, directed by Hackford, written by James L. White, photography by Pawel Edelman, music by Ray Charles and various artists, distributed by Universal Pictures.\n\nRunning time: 2 hours, 33 mins.\n\nRay Charles/Jamie Foxx\n\nDella Bea/Kerry Washington\n\nMargie Hendricks/Regina King\n\nJeff Brown/Clifton Powell\n\nParent's guide: PG-13 (profanity, sexual content, drugs, adult themes)\n\n(c) 2004, The Philadelphia Inquirer.\n\nWhen this story was posted in October 2004, this was on the front page of PCOL:\n\nKerry reaches out to Returned Volunteers\n\nThe Kerry campaign wants the RPCV vote. Read our interview with Dave Magnani, Massachusetts State Senator and Founder of \"RPCVs for Kerry,\" and his answers to our questions about Kerry's plan to triple the size of the Peace Corps, should the next PC Director be an RPCV, and Safety and Security issues. Then read the \"RPCVs for Kerry\" statement of support and statements by Dr. Robert Pastor, Ambassador Parker Borg, and Paul Oostburg Sanz made at the \"RPCVs for Kerry\" Press Conference.\n\nRPCV Carl Pope says the key to winning this election is not swaying undecided voters, but persuading those already willing to vote for your candidate to actually go to the polls.\n\nTake our poll and tell us what you are doing to support your candidate.\n\nFinally read our wrap-up of the eight RPCVs in Senate and House races around the country and where the candidates are in their races. Director Gaddi Vasquez: The PCOL Interview\n\nPCOL sits down for an extended interview with Peace Corps Director Gaddi Vasquez. Read the entire interview from start to finish and we promise you will learn something about the Peace Corps you didn't know before.\n\nPlus the debate continues over Safety and Security. Schwarzenegger praises PC at Convention\n\nGovernor Schwarzenegger praised the Peace Corps at the Republican National Convention: \"We're the America that sends out Peace Corps volunteers to teach village children.\" Schwarzenegger has previously acknowledged his debt to his father-in-law, Peace Corps Founding Director Sargent Shriver, for teaching him \"the joy of public service\" and Arnold is encouraging volunteerism by creating California Service Corps and tapping his wife, Maria Shriver, to lead it. Leave your comments and who can come up with the best Current Events Funny? Peace Corps: One of the Best Faces of America\n\nTeresa Heinz Kerry celebrates the Peace Corps Volunteer as one of the best faces America has ever projected in a speech to the Democratic Convention. The National Review disagreed and said that Heinz's celebration of the PCV was \"truly offensive.\" What's your opinion and can you come up with a Political Funny?\n\nRead the stories and leave your comments.\n\nSome postings on Peace Corps Online are provided to the individual members of this group without permission of the copyright owner for the non-profit purposes of criticism, comment, education, scholarship, and research under the \"Fair Use\" provisions of U.S. Government copyright laws and they may not be distributed further without permission of the copyright owner.
