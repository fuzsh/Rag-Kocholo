The Miracle

Back Sleeve

2004 Japan CD

After the success of The Magic Tour, Queen took an extended hiatus. Freddie found success with The Great Pretender single and his hit collaboration with Montserrat Caball√©, Barcelona. Roger started a side project in the form of a new band, The Cross. Brian stayed busy working with other artists such as Anita Dobson, Bad News and Meatloaf to name a few. Finally, Queen triumphantly reunified to release their thirteenth studio album, The Miracle. Unlike previous albums, every track was credited to the band, not the individual author; this helped ease the tensions of creative conflicts and royalties. The Miracle was released on May 22, 1989 by Parlophone in the UK, charting at #1 and going Platinum. After a disappointing outing with A Kind Of Magic, Queen rebounded somewhat in the US; the album went to #24 and sold enough copies to be certified Gold.

Five singles in all were released to support the album. A single version of I Want It All, backed with Hang On In There, came out in May 1989, reaching #3 in the UK. Breakthru, backed with the non-album track Stealin', followed in June, giving the band their second top ten hit of the year, which reached #7 in the UK. An extended version of Breakthru was made available on 12" vinyl and CD single. The Invisible Man followed in August, reaching #12. Another non-album track, Hijack My Heart, accompanied the single, which featured an extended mix on both the 12" vinyl and CD single. Scandal was released in October, reaching #25. Like the previous two singles, Scandal was extended for the 12" and CD single. All Scandal singles included the non-album track My Life Has Been Saved, which was later reworked for 1995's Made In Heaven album. The title track reached #21 and was the fifth and final single. For the B-side two live tracks, Stone Cold Crazy from The Rainbow Theatre 1974 and My Melancholy Blues from Houston 1977, were featured to promote the Rare Live VHS tape.

The Miracle sessions were a very productive period for the band. Freddie stated during a 1989 interview with Mike Read that they recorded thirty songs while working on the album. Some tracks became B-sides, while Chinese Torture and Hang On In There were used as bonus tracks for the original CD release. Tracks such as Dog With A Bone, A New Life Is Born, I Guess We're Falling Out and Face It Alone remain unreleased.

Party (The Teaser Tape Edit) 2:23

Written by Queen

Appears on: The Teaser Tape

Surprisingly, this is almost the entire track, with only two edits: opening music is gone, with the track starting with Freddie singing, and the second edit is in the "..come back and play" portion. The track ends the same way as the album, cutting off where the next track, Khashoggi's Ship, starts.

Party (Work-In-Progress Preview Mix) 1:46

Written by Queen

Appears on: 13 Track Preview cassette for Capitol Records

In late 1988, a 13 track cassette was sent by Queen to executives at Capitol Records in the USA. The cassette served as avpreview to their new, as of yet unnamed album. The cassette had excerpts of work-in-progress song versions to satisfy the curiosities of Capitol Records. Five of those tracks have leaked freely amongst traders (Scandal, Too Much Love Will Kill You, The Invisible Man, I Want It All, and The Miracle). The tape is currently owned by Queen collector John S. Stuart. Party, from this cassette, seems to be an edited version of the performance used on the album version. The song starts with vocals instead of the full instrumental intro. Lots of Brian's guitar and instrumental bits have been omitted.

Party (Rough Mix) 2:24

Written by Queen

Appears on: Capitol Records "Rough Mixes" cassette tape

In early 1989, Queen sent Capitol Records an 11 track cassette tape with full-length rough mixes of the proposed tracklisting for The Miracle. The rough mix of Party features the same performance that appears on the final album version. Any differences between the two are strictly in the mix of the song (instrumental volume levels, stereo effects, etc).

Party (The eYe Version) 2:26

Written by Queen

Appears on: Queen: The eYe (Non-English Versions), The Art Of Queen: The eYe

This rare instrumental remix of Party is featured on the non-English versions of The eYe videogame and on the CD from The Art Of Queen: The eYe book. This remix, like all of The eYe remixes was done by former member of The Cross, Joshua J. Macrae.

Party (Stand-Alone Version)

Written by Queen

This track premiered at the 16th International Fan Club Convention in Prestatyn. This is a complete stand-alone version that does not segue into Khashoggi's Ship.

Khashoggi's Ship (Deep Cuts Version) 2:54

Appears on: UK Deep Cuts 3 (1984-1985)

Instead of the beginning segueing from Party, this completely stand alone version of Khashoggi's Ship starts with a simple drum beat and cymbal crash.

Khashoggi's Ship (The Teaser Tape Edit) 2:07

Written by Queen

Appears on: The Teaser Tape

Like the album, this starts with the segue from Party, continues through the first verse, then jumps to Freddie's scat in the middle and continuing to the end of the song. It is actually a fairly seamless edit.

Appears on: Unreleased

This track premiered at the 16th International Fan Club Convention in Prestatyn. This was recorded in Olympic Studios, November 1988. This version has Freddie Mercury's guide vocals. Three to four different vocal takes are on this mix to give a flavor of the different versions recorded. Lyrics include, "This big bad fucker - I said go get laid" (instead of "I said uh huh babe").

The Miracle (Album Version) 5:01

The Miracle (Greatest Hits II CD Edit) 4:54

Written by Queen

Appears on: Greatest Hits II CD

The same as the album version, just fading out sooner. The closing lyrics "the time will come, one day you'll see, when we can all be friends" is repeated one less time. The edit was made by David Richards to fit this track onto the Greatest Hits II CD.

The Miracle (Classic Queen Edit) 4:24

Written by Queen

Appears on: Classic Queen

This is a major edit of the album version. The instrumental section near the end (which starts with the brief bass solo) is completely cut out. The song goes from the lyrics "Peace on Earth and end to war..." right into the closing chorus parts.

The Miracle (Forever Cross-Fade Version) 4:57

Written by Queen

Appears on: Forever Deluxe Edition

The Deluxe Edition of the 2014 compilation album "Forever" features a minor cross-fade from the ending of "The Miracle" into the beginning of "Is This The World We Created".

Appears on: Greatest Video Hits 2, Greatest Flix II

Again, same as the album version, except the closing lyrics "the time will come, one day you'll see, when we can all be friends" is repeated one more time.

A new 96/24 DTS 5.1 surround mix of The Miracle was made for the 2003 Greatest Video Hits 2 DVD. The new mixes on this DVD were produced by Justin Shriley-Smith. Engineered by Justin Shirley-Smith and Kris Fredriksson. Pro Tools HD by Kris Fredriksson. The mixes were done at Sphere Studios, London. A few seconds of silence are added to the beginning of the track for the video title card on the DVD.

The Miracle (The Teaser Tape Edit) 1:56

Written by Queen

Appears on: The Teaser Tape

Here's almost the first two minutes of the song, uncut. It fades out before the "If every leaf..." verse comes in. Again, it is a sampler edit, so on that level, it works just fine.

Brian throws in some different guitar bits here and there. The lyrics here are not that different from the album version.

This is a great sounding instrumental version. The outro is longer by repeating a few lines. No click track at the beginning.

The Miracle (Kevin Cohen and Femi Jiya Mix) 4:55

Appears on: Queen - The Unauthorized Club Record 10 track promo CD-R

The Kevin Cohen and Femi Jiya mix of The Miracle is another in a long line of Hollywood BASIC remixes. This appeared on a 10 track promo CD-R from Hollywood called Queen: The Unauthorized Club Record. Cohen and Jiya are known for some of their production work with Prince. Keith Cohen also remixed the Living In A Box song, Blow The House Down (which featured Brian May).

I Want It All (Album Version) 4:41

Written by Queen

Appears on: The Miracle, Track 4

The definitive album version, which differs from the later 1991 US remaster. The first chorus has no backing vocals, lead vocals are double tracked, synth is more prominent, and there is no lead guitar. The first chorus repeat has backing vocals and lead guitar.

I Want It All (Hollywood Records Album Version) 4:33

Written by Queen

Appears on: The Miracle Hollywood Remaster (1991)

Appearing only on the 1991 Hollywood Records remaster of The Miracle. At 1:14 into the track, the chorus that repeats the lyrics "I Want It All" is missing completely. Additionally, there are added backing vocals in the track. The first chorus has no backing vocals, lead vocal has more obvious multitracking, less prominent synth, more rhythm guitar, and lead guitar. There is no first chorus repeat. How did this mistake happen? Quite simply when Hollywood Records was remastering the album, Queen Productions provided the incorrect album master tape to Hollywood Records. The I Want It All mix that appears on the Hollywood release was added to the album master on March 15, 1989.

I Want It All (Single Version) 4:00

Written by Queen

Appears on: I Want It All 7" vinyl, I Want It All 12" vinyl, I Want It All CD single, Greatest Hits II, Jewels II, UK The Single Collection Volume 3, UK 2011 The Miracle Deluxe CD

A great single mix that improves on the album version. The opening features a chorus starting out the song singing "I Want It All" three times. Some of Brian's guitar is edited out but it isn't missed all that much. Recommended over the album version. The I Want It All single reached #3 in the UK chart.

I Want It All (Argentinia Single Edit) 4:10

Written by Queen

Appears on: Argeninia I Want It All 7" vinyl

The same as the UK album version except at 2:57 there is a large edit of the instrumental section that is painfully obvious.

I Want It All (Rocks Mix) 4:30

Written by Queen

Appears on: Queen Rocks

A great remix that basically combines the album and single versions. This mix starts out like the single mix with the chorus vocal and goes into the rest of the album version. Brian's guitar solo is unedited. This is the best mix of the song in my opinion.

I Want It All (Greatest Video Hits 2 Surround Mix) 4:09

I Want It All (The Teaser Tape Edit) 1:40

Written by Queen

Appears on: The Teaser Tape

This edit starts abruptly part way through the opening music and then edits into the "Listen all you people..." verse. It then continues until Brian's middle eight verse, taking a rather long fade out over it, ending just before the guitar solo. Unlike the first three edits on the tape, this sounds a bit more choppy.

I Want It All (Work-In-Progress Preview Mix) 1:26

Five of those tracks have leaked freely amongst traders (Scandal, Too Much Love Will Kill You, The Invisible Man, I Want It All, and The Miracle). The tape is currently owned by Queen collector John S. Stuart. The guitar performance has some differences from the final version. Brian's "Pete Townshend" vocal bit is incomplete with unfinished lyrics. Freddie's line "listen all you people" is from a different take as well.

I Want It All (Rough Mix) 4:38

Written by Queen

Appears on: Capitol Records "Rough Mixes" cassette tape

In early 1989, Queen sent Capitol Records an 11 track cassette tape with full-length rough mixes of the proposed tracklisting for The Miracle. The rough mix of I Want It All has the same structure as the 1991 Hollywood Records album version (see above), as opposed to the proper album mix. The rough mix ending is longer than the Hollywood album version; the droning synth sound at the end is extended, adding a few seconds to the track.

I Want It All (Karaoke Version) 4:03

Written by Queen

Appears on: Greatest Karaoke Hits

An instrumental of the single version, which still retains the beginning chorus vocals. Starts with a click track.

I Want It All (Instrumental Demo) 3:38

Written by Queen

Appears on: Unreleased

A very long instrumental demo. Sounds very good, but a little uninteresting without the vocals. Similar to the final backing track, with some minor changes here and there. Ends with some parts of Chinese Torture.

I Want It All (The eYe Version 1) 4:43

Written by Queen

Appears on: Queen: The eYe

From the Electronic Arts videogame, Queen: The eYe. An almost full instrumental version of the album track, starting about halfway through the opening guitar chord.

I Want It All (The eYe Version 2) 4:53

Written by Queen

Appears on: Queen: The eYe

From the Electronic Arts videogame, Queen: The eYe. Another full instrumental version, again starting just a second late into the track. The first 10 or so seconds is looped a second time with a synthesizer effect added to blend them together.

Written by Queen

Appears on: UK The Invisible Man 12" vinyl, UK The Invisible Man CD single, UK The Miracle, US Capitol Records The Miracle, The Miracle Hollywood Remaster (1991), UK 2011 The Miracle Deluxe CD

Remixed by David Richards, The Invisible Man extended version is a fairly major departure from the album version. At over a minute longer, this version is a very different mix. The track opens differently with electronic whistling sound effects. The band member introductions are no longer there. The backing track is remixed, with more instrumental sections. The ending has also been changed with Roger singing the lyrics "I'm the invisible man." Worth a listen just to hear the differences, but probably not as good as the album version.

The Invisible Man (Video Version) 4:16

Written by Queen

Appears on: Greatest Video Hits 2, Greatest Flix II

A really good version that would have made a nice single remix. The track starts with sound effects that are in the beginning of the Extended Version up to Roger singing his invisible man lyric, then it goes right into the normal album version.

The intro is cut down, the first verse survives, then it jumps to the middle part of the song, then repeats the intro, cutting off right after "..see right through me!" Unlike the other edits on the tape, which at least tried to maintain the overall structure of the original track, this is the only one to change that around by closing with the intro part. Obviously, if you know the album version, this is a surprising change.

The Invisible Man (Early Version with Guide Vocal, August 1988) 5:03

Written by Queen

Appears on: 2011 UK The Miracle Deluxe CD

Originating from Roger Taylor, this demo of The Invisible Man features him, not Freddie on lead vocals. Freddie, however, does appear on vocals in the middle section singing "was it shyness in my soul that made me lonely just like you? No one noticed I was there, when I walked into the room." This middle vocal section also appeared on another, unreleased, early version of the track that is listed above. This is a great version of the song. Roger's vocals and his drumming performance really suit this track well.

A very good extended mix that starts out very differently from the album version. Instead of the multitracked intro, this version starts out with Freddie simply singing "Breakthru... Breakthru...." a few times. There are some neat stereo sound effects going between the left and right channels. The rest of the backing track has been remixed as well, with lots of added percussion.

The rough mix of Scandal is very similar to the final mix of the song, however the intro is more abrupt and does not fade-in like the album version. The album version has a line at approximately 3:39, "yes you're on and on and on again", that is missing from this rough mix. The performance appears to be the same one used in the final album version.

Written by Queen

Appears on: Unreleased

The demo version of My Baby Does Me. Not much has changed from the demo to the final version. The songs backing track is mostly unchanged. Many of the lyrics are not completed, so some filler is there from Freddie.

Was It All Worth It (The Teaser Tape Edit) 1:56

Appears on: The Teaser Tape

This starts partway through Freddie's vocal bit, then jumps a few times through the instrumental intro, then jumps into the "Put down our money..." verse, then cuts to the last chorus and finally jumps to the finale, before fading out early. This is a bit more brutal an edit compared the others on the tape.

Was It All Worth It (Work-In-Progress Preview Mix) 1:31

Written by Queen

Appears on: 13 Track Preview cassette for Capitol Records

In late 1988, a 13 track cassette was sent by Queen to executives at Capitol Records in the USA. The cassette served as a preview to their new, as of yet unnamed album. The cassette had excerpts of work-in-progress song versions to satisfy the curiosities of Capitol Records. Five of those tracks have leaked freely amongst traders (Scandal, Too Much Love Will Kill You, The Invisible Man, I Want It All, and The Miracle). The tape is currently owned by Queen collector John S. Stuart. This sounds like it is an edit of the final album performance.

Was It All Worth It (Rough Mix) 5:48

Written by Queen

Appears on: Capitol Records "Rough Mixes" cassette tape

In early 1989, Queen sent Capitol Records an 11 track cassette tape with full-length rough mixes of the proposed tracklisting for The Miracle. The rough mix of Was It All Worth It features the same performance that appears on the final album version. Any differences between the two are strictly in the mix of the song (instrumental volume levels, stereo effects, etc).

Was It All Worth It (The eYe Version 2) 1:53

Written by Queen

Appears on: Queen: The eYe

From the Electronic Arts videogame, Queen: The eYe. This is a continuation of an instrumental version of the album version, picking up where The eYe Version 1 leaves off. The song ends with a guitar note (which would be around 2:24 of the full album version).

Chinese Torture 1:45

Written by Queen

Appears on: UK The Miracle CD, US Capitol Records The Miracle CD, The Miracle Hollywood Remaster (1991), UK 2011 The Miracle Deluxe CD

Originating from Brian's guitar solos at the end part of The Magic Tour, Chinese Torture is a really fun, heavy instrumental song. Chinese Torture was released only as a bonus track on The Miracle CD. This is a really fun guitar extravaganza and works well as a bonus track.

Hang On In There 3:46

Written by Queen

Appears on: UK The Miracle CD, US Capitol Records The Miracle CD, The Miracle Hollywood Remaster (1991), UK The Single Collection Volume 3, UK 2011 The Miracle Deluxe CD

A very good CD bonus track and the B-side to I Want It All, Hang On In There has the feeling of a jam session. It leans towards the heavy side and is worth getting. Lead vocals by Freddie, and a nice instrumental jam at the end.

Hang On In There (Single Edit) 3:43

Written by Queen

Appears on: I Want It All 7" vinyl, I Want It All 12" vinyl, I Want It All CD single

A little known edit, probably because no one bothered to listen for it. The entire track is the same as the album version, except for the last few seconds. The single edit version fades out slightly earlier and is missing a final guitar chord.

Hang On In There (Demo) 2:58

An instrumental demo with Freddie doing some vocals bits here and there. A bit rougher and heavier than the proper version, and still interesting to listen to.

Stealin' 3:58

Written by Queen

Appears on: UK Breakthru 7" vinyl, UK Breakthru 12" vinyl, UK Breakthru CD single, UK The Single Collection Volume 3, UK 2011 The Miracle Deluxe CD

The B-side to Breakthru, Stealin' is another great non-album track from the Miracle sessions. Freddie is featured on lead vocals this time. The song has an easygoing tempo, until the end where it becomes insanely fast. This would have fit well on the album. Judging from the demo, this track may have stemmed from Freddie.

Stealin' (Demo) 11:43

Written by Queen

Appears on: Unreleased

A very long demo version. Starts with some studio banter from Freddie and then goes into the song. Freddie provides the only vocals and multitracks himself multiple times throughout the song. Has a few long instrumental sections, but this is mostly a vocal showcase for Freddie.

Hijack My Heart 4:11

The B-side to The Invisible Man, Hijack My Heart stems from Roger Taylor. Most of the instrumentation and the lead vocals come from Roger as well. Hard hitting drums, and Roger's electronic-rock sound are throughout the track. This would have sounded right at home on any one of Roger's solo efforts.

Hijack My Heart (Demo) 3:25

Written by Queen

Appears on: Unreleased

This is one of the more recent demos previewed at the recent Queen conventions. Again, Roger is on lead vocals. At times the instruments seem to overpower his vocals, suggesting that this is a guide vocal from Roger. Instrumentally, the song is basically the same, except there are what sound like maracas in the background for the entire song, which fairly well (although are mixed to high in this demo). Brian's guitar is more present and heavier. Lyrics for the most part are the same, with a few missing pieces here and there. The ending features a piano outro, which comes as a very big surprise. Very neat sounding demo, just for the fact it sounds different.

My Life Has Been Saved (Original 1989 Version) 3:17

Written by Queen

Appears on: UK Scandal 7" vinyl, UK Scandal 12" vinyl, UK Scandal CD single, UK 2011 Made In Heaven Deluxe CD

Stemming from John Deacon, this B-side to Scandal was later reworked into an album cut for the posthumous Made In Heaven album. This original version is a bit fuller and heavier, but still sounds similar to the Made In Heaven version. Freddie's vocals have a slightly processed sound to them. The ending has some spoken parts by Freddie.

My Life Has Been Saved (Made In Heaven Version) 3:15

Written by Queen

Appears on: Made In Heaven, Track 5

Reworked from the B-side version from 1989 for the Made In Heaven album, this version features the keyboard much more prominently and has a lighter sound from the added synth effects. Freddie's vocal track is much clearer, louder, and doesn't seem to be as processed. It is arguable whether this version or the original is better. Regardless, the reworking of this song made it fit in well with the Made In Heaven album.

I Guess We're Falling Out (Demo) 2:35

Written by Queen

Appears on: Unreleased

This track seems to segue from My Baby Loves Me. A really good start to an unfinished song. Lead vocals and piano by Freddie. Lyrics are off to a good start but are unfinished. A shame this couldn't have been completed. This track segues into the Hang On In There demo.

A New Life Is Born (Demo) 1:22

Written by Queen

Appears on: Unreleased

This one certainly is interesting. This track is actually the beginning chorus part of Breakthru. Right when you expect the "Now!" part, the song continues into a ballad. Seems to be just Freddie on vocals and piano for this one. Vocals and lyrics are incomplete, but still are very good and interesting.

Dog With A Bone (Demo) 4:37

Written by Queen

Appears on: Unreleased

A fun jam session song, done in a Muddy Waters style. Lead vocals are shared by Freddie and Roger. This one seems to be done just for fun, and the energy certainly comes through.

For the 1988 Queen Convention in the UK, Queen presented a pre-recorded message. The message was the unreleased track Dog With A Bone with some recorded messages from the band inserted into the middle of the track. Freddie sings his part of the message.

Face It Alone (Full Studio Demo) 5:17

Written by Queen

Appears on: Unreleased

Face It Alone is a touching and haunting unfinished song by Queen which was worked on during The Miracle sessions. This demo starts with some studio banter from Freddie. Brian's wailing guitar is the foundation of the song. Freddie's vocal verses overlap each other as they work out the structure of the song. The final 3 minutes are instrumental (keyboard, drums, and guitar).

Face It Alone (Instrumental Guitar Demo) 3:58

This demo features Brian working out the guitar melody of the song, which is in line with the Full Studio Demo. The end section features faster, more frenetic guitar performance.

Face It Alone (Demo Excerpts)

This track premired at the 16th International Fan Club Convention in Prestatyn. Three different excerpts from of the song from The Miracle sessions, Olympic Studios, November 1988. Freddie Mercury on breathtaking vocals singing about "Looking after yourself first - you've only one life". Lots of heartfelt wailing guitar work by Brian May.
