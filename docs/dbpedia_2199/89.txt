“The Miracle” is about waiting on something you want desperately. It is inspired by the book The Year of Jubilee and is a song from the protagonist’s voice, Grace and the boy healer Golden, who she falls in love with. They are both searching for miracles, but skeptical of finding it. It has a lot of their angst and first love tension in the lyric and in the music.
