        "text": "Global dance music icon Calvin Harris has released his new single ‘Miracle’ featuring Ellie Goulding – their first single together in nine years.\n\nIt’s the third time the two have collaborated, previously teaming up on hit singles ‘I Need Your Love’ and ‘Outside’.\n\nAfter sharing recently that they were back in the studio together, Calvin and Ellie started sharing teasers of ‘Miracle’ including this post by Ellie who said this one of the highest choruses she’s ever done in her career.\n\nThe anthem totally takes it back to the 90’s with the rave-like drop as well as the uplifting piano chords. Calvin Harris is known for his underground old-school sound with his Love Regenerator alias, this seems like a mix of that and a more commercial sound. Goulding’s vocal is the perfect touch to create an epic old-school electronic piece.\n\nIt’s always a good day when Calvin Harris releases a dance record!"
