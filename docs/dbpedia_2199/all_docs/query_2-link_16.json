        "text": "The summer has been very good for viral UK band Tors. In June, they went on a successful sold out headline tour in the UK before playing a sold out headline show at New York’s Rockwood Music Hall in July. In the middle of this, their single “Amsterdam” became BBC Radio One’s Introducing Track of the Week, making one of their dreams come true. They also made it onto BBC Radio 2’s playlist and slid into the top 100 airplay in Germany – not too shabby! In a few days, the indie pop trio will join Lime Cordiale on a UK and EU run, where they will most likely perform their new single “Miracle.”\n\nAlready receiving millions of views for the a cappella renditions on social media, “Miracle” is a sensational way to close out the summer. Containing a full pop-rock production with infectious piano, drums, and the bittersweet optimism of a Coldplay song, “Miracle” lives up to its inspiring name. Lyrically, it focuses on chasing after a dream, hoping that the efforts to attain it are not a waste. We hear, “I’m not gonna slow down / Till I see my hometown / Reflected in the mirror like a light in the sky,” sending us on a mission with them. You can check it out below.\n\nAbout “Miracle,” Tors shares,\n\n“‘Miracle’ is a song about chasing your dreams headfirst and without compromise even when all the odds feel stacked against you. It’s not that you won’t quit but rather you don’t know how; something in your DNA keeps pushing you forward to the light at the end of the tunnel. It’s based on our own experiences being a band and fighting tooth and nail to keep our heads above the water, knowing that our own miracle was coming.”\n\nYou can find “Miracle” on platforms like Apple Music and Spotify.\n\nGrab tickets to see Tors on tour with Lime Cordiale here."
