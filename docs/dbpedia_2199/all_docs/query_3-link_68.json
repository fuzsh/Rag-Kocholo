        "text": "Overview\n\nNo longer a live band, Queen took their first genuine year off (1983 was only a semester off as they were soon back in the studios for The Works) and then got together in January 1988 with David Richards to work on a new album. They'd alternate between England and Switzerland and have a new rule where external performers wouldn't be used, except for two long-serving crew members who assisted with MIDI programming.\n\nThe album had been initially scheduled for a Xmas 1988 release and the working title was Invisible Men. It was also meant to dial down on synthesisers (a decision which they clearly reversed later on) and to credit all four members equally regardless of who'd actually penned each song. A lot of the sessions only featured part of the band as they were all splitting their time between Queen and other commitments: Frederick was doing his duet album, Brian was working on his solo record, Roger had a parallel band (where he was the lead singer and rhythm guitarist instead of the drummer) and John was intermittently leaving for holidays.\n\nThe Miracle was largely (though not entirely) digitally recorded and made use of 48-track technology via having two 24-track recorders synchronised (as master and slave). Computers and automation were also heavily used for mixing. Despite all the reliance on modern technology, some backing tracks were at least partly live including 'Was It All Worth It'.\n\nAvailable Sources\n\nSome photographs of the band in the studios were put on Fan Club magazines at the time, but otherwise they worked in almost absolute secrecy. Most information about synthesisers has been obtained thanks to correspondence with experts and enthusiasts all over the place, some of who have even recreated the actual timbres (many of which come from presets anyway) using digital keyboards of the time.\n\nDavid Richards was interviewed by Sound on Sound and the subsequent article, published in August 1989, includes in-depth commentary about some of the equipment employed and a bit of what was done where. Interestingly enough, David confirmed backing vocals were usually recorded having all three founding members gathering 'round the same mic, it wasn't just a gimmick for the videos.\n\nThere are stems for 'I Want It All' available as the song was included in Rock Band as downloadable content from Tuesdy the 20th of October 2009.\n\nDocumented Timeline\n\n1986:\n\nFriday 1st August: Whilst playing the Mini-Stadium in Barcelona, Brian plays a working version of 'Chinese Torture' as part of his guitar solo. He keeps doing it for the remainder of the tour (i.e. one more week).\n\n1987:\n\nLate: Frederick writes a letter to the Fan Club and announces the band had a meeting and are scheduled to start recording in January 1988.\n\n1988:\n\nJanuary: All four band members get together in London and start working on the album.\n\nFebruary: Recording sessions continue in London.\n\nFriday 19th: The Cross kicks off their first tour at the University in Leeds, West Yorkshire. Brian, John and Frederick continue recording without him.\n\nMarch:\n\nRoger's still touring Britain, and the remaining members take a break as well. Brian records 'Back to the Light' (the song) in London and then flies to LA, John goes to France and Malta, and Frederick works on 'Guide Me Home', 'How Can I Go On' and 'Ensueño' for his duet album. The Cross take some weeks off but then start rehearsing the German leg of their tour.\n\nA posterior Fan Club magazine issue (Summer) confirms Brian had been writing songs with Frank Musker and Elizabeth Lamers in LA during this period. That may have been the genesis of 'Too Much Love Will Kill You'.\n\nJohn writes a letter to the Fan Club confirming the early sessions were quite productive and announcing they'd reunite again in April to continue working on the album. At that point, it was expected that the record would be released at the end of the year.\n\nApril: The four of them reunite in Switzerland and continue working on the album.\n\nMonday 11th: The Cross begin their twelve-date tour across West Germany. Brian, John and Frederick continue recording without Roger.\n\nFriday 22nd: Frederick attends a gala in Madrid honouring Montserrat Caballé's 25th anniversary in opera.\n\nMonday 25th: As the Shove It tour is over, Roger soon re-joins the rest of the band in Switzerland to continue working on the album.\n\nMay:\n\nFrederick goes to Barcelona to promote the yet-unreleased name-sake record. The rest of the band continue working without him.\n\nRoger writes a letter to the Fan Club announcing they'll take a break from recordings in June and that the album is scheduled to be finished before the end of the year.\n\nJune - July: Summer break - Frederick goes to Spain, Roger works with The Cross (rehearsals? videos? No idea), John goes to France and Brian to LA.\n\nAugust: Still on break, John remains in France whilst Brian works on his solo album, Frederick keeps coordinating Barcelona's upcoming release and Roger's still with The Cross (though not recording or touring - apparently mostly writing and rehearsing).\n\nSeptember:\n\nThursday 8th: Brian writes a letter to the Fan Club, complaining about the press and mentioning both the Queen album and his own solo record were about halfway done. He also comments on Roger splitting his time between Queen and The Cross and John being on holidays in Biarritz at the moment.\n\nMonday 12th: Queen reunite to continue working on the album. It's confirmed that the album's release has been postponed until Spring 1989.\n\nOctober: Another break - Frederick releases the duet album with Montserrat Caballé, Brian works on his solo effort, John goes to France for holidays and Roger... probably works with The Cross, or takes a holiday as well, or both.\n\nNovember: Roger, John and Frederick work on the Queen record, Brian's still mostly occupied with his solo album.\n\nDecember: Holidays.\n\nThe Fan Club magazine announces plans for the album, at this point still untitled, to be finished at the end of January and four titles are revealed: 'Scandal', 'Rain Must Fall', 'Invisible Man' and 'Was It All Worth It'. A letter from Frederick in that same issue confirms plans for a Spring release.\n\n1989:\n\nJanuary - February: The four of them work on the album in London, finishing it and mixing it together.\n\nFebruary:\n\nFan Club Magazine:\n\nJohn writes a letter from Olympic Studios in London, where he informs they're finishing off the album. He teases a 'strong and unusual image for the front cover', mentions they haven't yet decided on what the lead single will be and confirms they won't be touring.\n\nBrian answers a questionnaire sent to him, and claims the new Queen album to be his favourite (was he really pleased with it or was it PR? Hard to tell!).\n\nElsewhere, the Fan Club magazine confirms the album title and what the cover will be like (it doesn't show it, though - it just describes it). The video for the single is planned for March.\n\nWednesday 22nd March: Album mastered from the final Olympic mixes, which at the time included 'Too Much Love Will Kill You' (but there's also a note on the master clarifying it won't be on the final version).\n\nApril: The band shoot the video for 'I Want It All', directed by David Mallet.\n\nMay:\n\nMonday 1st: 'I Want It All' / 'Hang On in There' released in Britain.\n\nMonday 22nd: Album released in Britain.\n\nThursday 25th: Only three days after having been issued, The Miracle is simultaneously certified Silver, Gold and Platinum in the UK for having sold 60,000, 100,000 and 300,000 copies, respectively.\n\nJune:\n\nSaturday 3rd: The Official Charts company reveals The Miracle to have been the best-selling album of the week in the UK, having temporarily knocked out Jason Donovan's Ten Good Reasons.\n\nThat week, Roger writes a letter to the Fan Club announcing 'Breakthru' will be the second single and describing what's being planned for the video.\n\nTuesday 6th: The album is released in the USA.\n\nFriday 9th: The album is released in Japan.\n\nMonday 12th:\n\nThe album is released in Australia.\n\nQueen shoot the video for 'Breakthru' at the Nene Valley Railway in Cambridgeshire, England, directed by the Torpedo Twins.

He also asks the fans not to badger Frederick asking him to go on the road.\n\nSeptember:\n\nWednesday 27th: Queen shoot the video for 'Scandal' at Pinewood Studios in London, directed by the Torpedo Twins.\n\nOctober:\n\nMonday 9th: 'Scandal' / 'My Life Has Been Saved' is released as the album's fourth single in Britain.\n\nNovember:\n\nThursday 23rd: Queen shoot the video for 'The Miracle' at Elstree Studios, directed by the Torpedo Twins.\n\nMonday 27th: 'The Miracle' / 'Stone Cold Crazy' is released as the album's fifth single in Britain.\n\nDocumented Recording Venues\n\nMountain Studios in the Casino Barrière on 9 Theatre Road, Montreux, Vaud 1820, Swiss Confederation.\n\nOlympic Sound Studios on 117 Church Road, Barnes, Richmond-upon-Thames, Greater London SW13, England.\n\nThe Town House on 150 Goldhawk Road, Shepherd's Bush, Royal Borough of Hammersmith & Fulham, Greater London W12 8EN, England.\n\nDocumented Personnel\n\nPerformers:\n\nThe band:\n\nJohn Deacon: Electric bass, electric guitars, digital synthesisers, drum computer, MIDI programming.\n\nBrian May: Lead and backing vocals, electric guitars, digital synthesisers, drum computer, MIDI programming.\n\nFrederick Mercury: Lead and backing vocals, acoustic piano, digital synthesisers, drum computer, MIDI programming.\n\nRoger Taylor: Backing vocals, acoustic drums, digital synthesisers, drum computer, MIDI programming.\n\nGuest musicians:\n\nDavid Richards: Digital synthesisers, drum computer, MIDI programming.\n\nBrian Zellis: MIDI programming.\n\nStudio Crew:\n\nJohn Brough: Assistant engineer (Town House).\n\nDavid Richards: Deputy producer, chief engineer.\n\nJustin Smith: Assistant engineer (Mountain).\n\nTechnical Crew:\n\nMartin Groves: Equipment supervision.\n\nBrian Zellis: Equipment supervision.\n\nDocumented Instruments\n\nAcoustic Pianos:\n\nBösendorfer (Unknown Model): Town House.\n\nSteinway B 6' 10\": Mountain.\n\nSteinway (Unknown Model): Olympic and Town House.\n\nElectric Basses:\n\nFender Precisions:\n\n1955 Masterbuilt: Possibly a spare, but perhaps used somewhere.\n\n196?: John had two (black and natural), which may have been his main ones.\n\n1981 Special: Possibly a spare, but perhaps used somewhere.\n\n1983 Elite: Possibly used alongside the main ones.\n\nNon-Fenders:\n\nGiffin Bespoke: Possibly a spare, but perhaps used somewhere.\n\nKramer DMZ: Most likely merely a spare, but could've also been used somewhere.\n\nMusic Man Stingray: Possibly a spare, but perhaps used somewhere.\n\nWarwick Buzzard: Possibly a spare, but perhaps used somewhere.\n\nElectric Guitars:\n\nBHM Bespoke: Brian's main.\n\nFender Telecaster: Possibly used by John here and there.\n\nGibson Chet Atkins CE: 'I Want It All' (alongside the BHM, of course).\n\nGuild Bespoke: Brian's spare.\n\nSynthesisers:\n\nE-mu Emulator II+: Used frequently, for instance for 'Was It All Worth It''s orchestra.\n\nRoland D-50: Main synth on the album.
