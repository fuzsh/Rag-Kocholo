        "text": "Singer/songwriter Nik Day published 24 songs last year — all about faith.\n\n“I do a lot of writing,” he said in an interview with the Deseret News.\n\nThe 28-year-old works for The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, writing musical albums to go along with the youth mutual theme and working with teenagers to produce the songs. In addition, he also writes songs for the Especially for Youth albums. He also wrote and sang seven of his own songs for his debut Christian album, “Miracle” (Shadow Mountain Records, $7.99) which was released earlier this month.\n\nThose are just the songs he has published — not including additional unpublished ones that he writes on the side.\n\nDay started writing songs on the piano when he was about 7 years old. He began adding lyrics when he was about 12.\n\n“They weren’t very good,” he said, “but thankfully, I’ve gotten better throughout the years.”\n\nHe has published over 50 songs, according to information from Shadow Mountain Records.\n\nDay started writing music for the LDS Church in 2011, and his first EFY song was feature on the 2013 album. He graduated from Brigham Young University in 2012 with a degree in media music studies. He moved to Nashville to pursue music, but he said he felt like he should move back to Salt Lake.\n\nAt his current position, he works with youths who sing his songs for the mutual theme albums. Many of them have never been in a recording studio, he said, so it’s fun for him to coach the singers and help them through the process.\n\n“I’ve met a lot of awesome kids, super talented,” he said.\n\nRecently, Day traveled to Mexico City, where he served an LDS mission, for his job. During his time there, he conducted a songwriting workshop and worked with local youths to record the mutual theme songs in Spanish.\n\nDay said a lot of the youths recognized him and knew his music.\n\n“It just showed me how much of an impact it was making,” he said.\n\nDay has been writing music for the LDS Church for several years and decided he “might as well create some more” for an album of his own, he said.\n\n“I’m just doing it because I think there should be more good LDS music and good LDS artists,” he said.\n\nHe hopes that he can also represent the LDS Church not only to an LDS audience, but also to a general Christian audience.\n\nDay said he didn’t include any “overtly LDS doctrines” in the seven original songs for “Miracle.”\n\n“I wanted to write something that everyone who believes in God can related to,” he said.\n\nThe songs on his new album are about creating a connection with God, he said.\n\n“Everyone is a child of God and they can have a personal relationship with him,” Day said. “They don’t have to be perfect. He doesn’t expect us to be perfect. But we can feel his love. … It’s there, we just have to accept it. And allow ourselves to feel it.”\n\nDay listens to Christian music on the radio, which he said helps him create a different sound than what is usually done in the LDS music scene.\n\n“I think the gospel is exciting and I wanted to have that come across in my music,” Day said.\n\nThe songs are uplifting, catchy and happy. While most of the songs are exciting and upbeat, there are some that are slower and thought-provoking lyrics. The songs feature a variety of different instruments, and Day sings all of them.\n\nSince he writes so many songs, Day said sometimes it is a struggle to come up with something different and something that matters to his audience.\n\nThrough his process, though, he said his testimony in the gospel strengthens. “And I think that it’s helping other people come closer to Christ.”\n\nDay’s album is available at Deseret Book and on iTunes and Amazon.\n\n\"Miracle\" by Nik Day"
