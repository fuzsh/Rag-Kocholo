        "text": "A former finalist from the popular television show, The Voice released has released her debut single.\n\nThe song, 'Miracle Story' serves as a reminder that God is always ahead of us, creating and orchestrating miracles that we can't see yet.\n\n“My hope for this song is that it will be a reminder that no matter what you’re facing, God has already gone before us to make a way where there seems to be no way and write a miracle story as only He can,” Brown shares. \"For every person still in the waiting, don’t lose heart. He’s not finished yet and is taking all things from broken to beautiful.”\n\n'Miracle Story' is a beautiful blend of Brown's deep roots in traditional country and Gospel music and her deep faith in God.\n\nBrown has been singing since she was nine and when she was 14 years old, Brown made it to the top 5 on The Voice. Brown also does voiceover work, landing her first role at age 11 in the Emmy award-winning Disney series 'Sofia the First.' She is also currently voicing the lead role of Leyla on the Netflix animated series \"Dragon: Rescue Riders,\" where she also sings on the show.\n\nShe will continue to release new music this spring and summer with an EP slated for this fall."
