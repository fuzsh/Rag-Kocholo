        "text": "It's a banger!\n\nAfter weeks of teasing a new song with Ellie Goulding, Calvin Harris dropped his latest collaboration, 'Miracle' on 10th March. The song sees Calvin returning to his dance roots with what is already a huge hit with his fans. üôå\n\nThe DJ previously worked with Ellie on 'I Need Your Love' (2013) and 'Outside' (2014) and told us in an interview that there are: \"Three good things about working with somebody,\" going on to explain she has: \"A spectacular unique voice and delivery that can carry a song emotionally, and you‚Äôre a laugh!\"\n\nIs there a music video for 'Miracle'?\n\nYes, there is a music video for 'Miracle', the video features both Ellie and Calvin along with some dancers.

Calvin announced on 6th March that 'Miracle' will be released on 10th March.

The content, the mystery, the history of you two. This will go down in the history books as the song that changed consciousness.'\n\nWhat does the new song sound like?\n\nBefore sharing the clips above, Calvin posted a short video on social media, leaving fans very excited. In the clip Ellie can be heard singing: \"When you hold me, there's a place I go, it's a different high, oh no, when you touch me, I get vulnerable in a different life, oh no.\"\n\nAfter posting this video fans were left very excited to hear the full song. Ellie commented on the video with heart-eye emojis saying: 'üòçüòçüòç', to which a fan replied: 'can‚Äôt waitttt üî•üî•üî•' (sic) and another said: 'the duo is back! üî•'.\n\nFollowing the acoustic preview inside a 900-year-old church, Calvin played the song at a gig in Argentina and sent fans wild when the beat came in. He also shared the video on Instagram telling his fans: 'Feels so good to play Miracle! It‚Äôs coming very soon! @elliegoulding'.\n\nWhat is the BPM of the new song?\n\nCalvin and Ellie's new song is a banger! The song's BPM (beats per minute) is 143 according to the clip Calvin shared, which means it's very fast, but we love it.\n\nHow did Calvin announce his new song?\n\nBack in January, Calvin shared a photo showing himself with Ellie, dressed in black, holding some headphones and smiling at the camera. He captioned his photo: 'Back in studio!! It‚Äôs time for the third installment of our banging song trilogy'.
