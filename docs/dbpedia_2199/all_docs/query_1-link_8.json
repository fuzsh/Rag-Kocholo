        "text": "You’re my life’s one miracle\n\nEverything I’ve done that’s good\n\nAnd you break my heart with tenderness\n\nAnd I confess it’s true\n\nI never knew a love like this ’til you\n\nYou’re the reason I was born\n\nNow I finally know for sure\n\nAnd I’m overwhelmed with happiness\n\nSo blessed to hold you close\n\nThe one that I love most\n\nThough the future has so much for you in store\n\nWho could ever love you more?\n\nThe nearest thing to heaven\n\nYou’re my angel from above\n\nOnly God creates such perfect love\n\nWhen you smile at me, I cry\n\nAnd to save your life I’d die\n\nWith a romance that is pure in heart\n\nYou are my dearest part\n\nWhatever it requires\n\nI live for your desires\n\nForget my own, your needs will come before\n\nWho could ever love you more?\n\nThere is nothing you could ever do\n\nTo make me stop loving you\n\nAnd every breath I take\n\nIs always for your sake\n\nYou sleep inside my dreams and know for sure\n\nWho could ever love you more?\n\n(Steve Dorff / Linda Thompson)\n\nIf I could\n\nI’d protect you from the sadness in your eyes\n\nGive you courage in a world of compromise\n\nYes, I would\n\nIf I could\n\nI would teach you all the things I’ve never learned\n\nAnd I’d help you cross the bridges that I’ve burned\n\nYes, I would\n\nIf I could\n\nI would try to shield your innocence from time\n\nBut the part of life I gave you isn’t mine\n\nI’ve watched you grow\n\nSo I could let you go\n\nIf I could\n\nI would help you make it through the hungry years\n\nBut I know that I could never cry your tears\n\nBut I would\n\nIf I could\n\nYes, if I live\n\nIn a time and place where you don’t want to be\n\nYou don’t have to walk along this road with me\n\nMy yesterday won’t have to be your way\n\nIf I knew\n\nI would try to change the world I brought you to\n\nAnd there isn’t very much that I could do\n\nBut I would\n\nIf I could\n\nOh baby\n\nI just want to protect you\n\nAnd help my baby through the hungry years\n\n’Cause you’re part of me\n\nAnd if you ever ever ever need\n\nI said a shoulder to cry on\n\nOr just someone to talk to\n\nI’ll be there, I’ll be there\n\nI didn’t change your world\n\nBut I would\n\nIf I could\n\n(Ron Miller / Ken Hirsch / Marti Sharron)\n\nNow hush\n\nMy little one\n\nDon’t be afraid\n\nYour daddy’s right here\n\nIt’s just\n\nA little dream\n\nAnd now it’s gone\n\nThere’s nothing to fear\n\nSo close your eyes\n\nI’ll sing a sweet lullaby\n\nLay your head close to my heart\n\n(chorus)\n\nAnd sleep tight the angels hover over you\n\nThey spread their wings to keep you safe and warm\n\nThe starlight in the heavens high above you\n\nWill light a path to find your way back home\n\nSleep tight\n\nAnd now my sleepy head your carriage waits\n\nTo take you off to bed\n\nLet go your tiny hands and drift away to a bright enchanted land\n\nI promise you, your sweetest dreams will come true\n\nNow leave this weary world behind\n\n(chorus)\n\nSo close your eyes and wish upon the brightest star\n\n’Cause when you dream, tt doesn’t matter where you are\n\nNear to me or very far, I’ll always be with you\n\n(whispered)\n\nSleep tight\n\nSleep tight\n\nSleep tight\n\n(chorus)\n\nYeah I’ll keep you safe\n\nSafe and warm\n\n(Richard Page / Jon Lind / John Lang)\n\nI see trees of green, red roses too\n\nI see them bloom for me and you\n\nAnd I think to myself, what a wonderful world\n\nI see skies of blue and clouds of white\n\nThe bright blessed day, dark sacred night\n\nAnd I think to myself, what a wonderful world\n\nThe colors of the rainbow, so pretty in the sky\n\nAre also on the faces of people going by\n\nI see friends shaking hands, saying “how do you do?”\n\nThey’re really saying “I love you”\n\nI hear babies crying, I watch them grow\n\nThey’ll learn much more than I’ll ever know\n\nAnd I think to myself, what a wonderful world\n\nYes, I think to myself, what a wonderful world\n\nI see trees of green, red roses too\n\nI see them bloom for me and you\n\nAnd I think to myself, what a wonderful world\n\n(George Weiss / Robert Thiele)\n\nMy precious one, my tiny one\n\nLay down your pretty head\n\nMy dearest one, my sleepy one\n\nIt’s time to go to bed\n\nMy precious one, my darling one\n\nDon’t let your lashes weep\n\nMy cherished one, my weary one\n\nIt’s time to go to sleep\n\nJust bow your head And give your cares to me\n\nJust close your eyes and fall into the sweetest dream, cause in my loving arms\n\nYou’re safe as you will ever be so hush my dear and sleep\n\nAnd in your dreams you’ll ride on angels’ wings\n\nDance with the stars and touch the face of god\n\nAnd if you should awake\n\nMy precious one, my tiny one\n\nI’ll kiss your little cheek\n\nAnd underneath the smiling moon\n\nI’ll sing you back to sleep\n\n(Peer Astrom / Stephanie Bentley)\n\nI pray you'll be my eyes\n\nAnd watch her where she goes\n\nAnd help her to be wise\n\nHelp me to let go\n\nEvery mother's prayer\n\nEvery child knows\n\nLead her to a place\n\nGuide her with your grace\n\nTo a place where she'll be safe\n\nI pray she finds your light\n\nAnd holds it in her heart\n\nAs darkness falls each night\n\nRemind her where you are\n\nEvery mother's prayer\n\nEvery child knows\n\nNeed to find a place\n\nGuide her with your grace\n\nGive her faith so she'll be safe\n\nLead her to a place\n\nGuide her with your grace\n\nTo a place where she'll be safe\n\n(David Foster / Carole Bayer Sager)\n\nThe first time ever I saw your face\n\nI thought the sun rose in your eyes\n\nAnd the moon and the stars were the gifts you gave\n\nTo the dark and the endless skies my love\n\nThe first time ever I kissed your mouth\n\nI felt the earth move through my hand\n\nLike the trembling heart of a captive bird\n\nThat was there at my command my love\n\nThe first time ever I lay with you\n\nAnd felt your heart so close to mine\n\nThe first time ever I saw your face\n\nYour face, your face, your face\n\n(Ewan MacColl)\n\nSun is creeping down behind the hill\n\nEverything is calm, everything is still\n\nSo baby close your eyes and rest your weary mind\n\nLet me hold you close, I’ll sing you this lullaby\n\nLet your worries go, you fall asleep\n\nThink of nothing more, memories will keep\n\nYour dreams will turn to gold and you will wake and find\n\nThat you hold a smile all day from this lullaby\n\nMaybe somewhere in the silence\n\nYou may wake and you’re all alone\n\nJust call and I’ll be there\n\neven when I’m gone, each day will end\n\nso I’ll say good night, till we meet again\n\nNow baby close your eyes and rest your weary mind\n\nI’ll let you know the joy you bring\n\nEvery time you hear me sing you this lullaby\n\n(Carol Welsman / Romano Musumarra)\n\nI will always love you\n\nMo matter what\n\nNo matter where you go\n\nOr what you do knowing you\n\nYou gonna have to do things your own way\n\nAnd that’s okay\n\nSo be free, spread your wings\n\nAnd promise me just one thing\n\n(chorus)\n\nIf you ever need a place to cry\n\nBaby come to me\n\nCome to me\n\nI’ve always known that you were born to fly\n\nBut you can come to me\n\nIf the world breaks your heart\n\nNo matter where on earth you are\n\nYou can come to me\n\nDon’t walk around with the world on your shoulders\n\nAnd your highest hopes laying on the ground\n\nI know you think you’ve gotta try to be my hero\n\nBut don’t you know the stars you wish upon they fall that’s true\n\nBut I still believe in you\n\n(chorus)\n\nAnd those seven seas you sail\n\nOr the winding road you roam\n\nLeave you lost and feeling all alone\n\nLet my heart be your beacon home\n\n(Beverley Mahood / Thomas Wade)\n\nClose your eyes,\n\nHave no fear,\n\nThe monster’s gone,\n\nHe’s on the run and your mommy’s here,\n\n(chorus)\n\nBeautiful, beautiful, beautiful, beautiful boy\n\nBeautiful, beautiful, beautiful, beautiful boy\n\nBefore you go to sleep,\n\nSay a little prayer,\n\nEvery day in every way,\n\nIt’s getting better and better,\n\n(chorus)\n\nOut on the ocean sailing away,\n\nI can hardly wait,\n\nTo see you come of age,\n\nBut I guess we’ll both just have to be patient,\n\nCuz it’s a long way to go,\n\nA hard row to hoe\n\nYes it’s a long way to go but in the meantime,\n\nBefore you cross the street,\n\nTake my hand,\n\nLife is what happens to you,\n\nWhile you’re busy making other plans,\n\n(chorus)\n\nBefore you go to sleep, say a little prayer,\n\nEvery day, in ev’ry way\n\nOt’s getting better and better.\n\n(chorus)\n\n(John Lennon)\n\nThere's a tree\n\nStanding there\n\nIn such an ordinary way\n\nBut as I look around\n\nEverything keeps changing\n\nThere's a leaf\n\nOn that tree\n\nAnd it floats into a stream\n\nAnd like everything\n\nIt gets carried away\n\nto the sea...\n\n(chorus)\n\nBut if we give a little of our love away\n\nMaybe meet in the middle\n\nEvery night and day\n\nIf we could hear just a whisper\n\nOf what the heart needs to say\n\nIt could sure make a difference\n\nIn some small...\n\nIn some small way\n\nIn your heart lies the key\n\nThat unlocks your destiny\n\nLook within and we'll find\n\nEverything we're longing for\n\n(chorus)\n\nOh...\n\nMay you cherish each moment you live\n\nAnd know all the love that you give\n\nWill go on and on and on...\n\nThere's a sky vast and blue\n\nAnd it lies deep inside of you\n\nBreathe it in\n\nLet it out\n\nBreathe it in again...\n\n(chorus)\n\n(Richard Page / David Tyson)"
