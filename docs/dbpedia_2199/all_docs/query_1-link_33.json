        "text": "EASTER COLLECTION\n\nThe Miracle | Recomposed\n\n“The Miracle: Recomposed” is, as my good friend calls it, “the grown-up version” of the song. Yes, I want to do all I can to help children come to know that Jesus died for them. But as life progresses, we need to remember that He will walk beside us and heal our wounds at any age. To depict this truth, I added a new 3rd verse (see below).\n\nLyrics\n\n*New 3rd Verse*\n\nI know he will walk beside me\n\nAnd heal my wounds and calm my troubled heart.\n\nAlways there to bless and guide me.\n\nMy psalm at night my bright and morning star.\n\nHis love and grace will never end,\n\nEach day they start anew.\n\nMy name is graven on His hands,\n\nAnd yours is too.\n\nYouTube Comments\n\nMy Doctor says l don't have much time left and listening to your songs warms my heart. l don't know much about God but I do thank you for your songs. l really needed to hear something great.\n\n- Alan Clark\n\nYour songs are mine and my kids' favorites! We play them in the car & on the piano and get so excited when a new one comes out. My 3-year-old son with Autism belts out entire verses (with actions) of the song \"I will shine\" and it's about the sweetest thing I've ever seen. The song The Miracle is my 6-year-old's favorite and the song that introduced us to your music!\n\nThank you again for blessing us all with your talents.\n\n-Michelle Glaittli\n\nAbsolutely Beautiful and heavenly. Very beautiful voices. I love your songs, Shawna. You are so talented. This is my favorite song. It makes me shiver. I love it.\n\n-Naomi Dobrescu"
