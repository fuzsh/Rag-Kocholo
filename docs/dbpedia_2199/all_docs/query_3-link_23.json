It was released on Bandcamp on December 22, 2020 and on Youtube on December 31, 2020.\n\nLyrics[]\n\nIt's been a long year\n\nI know you're tired and you're blue\n\nYou've been breathing smoke inside this trial of fire\n\nBut you got through\n\nAnd I know the world's gone wrong\n\nBut you're still present, you're still strong\n\nHold on\n\nThrough all your pain and all your tears\n\nYou're still resolute\n\nAnd you're still here\n\nIt's been a long year\n\nIt's been so heavy on your soul\n\nAnd though your scars have hardened and have turned to armor\n\nIt took its toll\n\nAnd I know the world's gone wrong\n\nBut you're still present, you're still strong\n\nHold on\n\nThrough all your pain and all your tears\n\nYou're still resolute\n\nAnd you're still here\n\nIt's been a long, long year\n\nBut you're still here\n\nIt's been a long, long year\n\nMeaning[]\n\nThe song was inspired by the many difficulties surrounding the year 2020, calling on the listeners to keep hanging on. In the words of Gavin Dunne, “I dedicate it to all of you who struggled or lost someone or something this year. I hope it brings you a little comfort and I wish you all a peaceful & brighter 2021.”\n\nOfficial Video[]\n\n(…)\n\nReferences[]\n\nYoutube link\n\nBandcamp link"
