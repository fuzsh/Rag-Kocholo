        "text": "WATCH OFFICIAL MUSIC VIDEO HERE\n\nNASHVILLE, TN – Today, multi-talented artist and one of People Magazine’s Emerging Artists Riley Clemmons has released her latest song “Miracle.” Co-written with Paul Duncan (Lauren Daigle, Leslie Odom, JR) and produced by Jeff Pardo (Lady A, CAIN), the pair have painted a picture of everyday miracles backed by delicate piano and strings which further highlight Riley’s powerful vocals. In addition to the debut of the song, Riley has shared an official music video for “Miracle.” The video was filmed at the romantic Two Rivers Mansion in Nashville, TN and directed by Mika Matinazad (Natalie Hemby, Ingrid Andress). Listen to “Miracle” and watch the video HERE.\n\n“It’s all too easy to get so busy and distracted that we forget to notice and appreciate the everyday miracles we get to experience in this lifetime,” shares Riley. “After sharing a snippet of the song on social media, I was moved by the ‘miracle’ stories being shared in love stories, miracle babies, family members, friends… the list goes on. I’m truly excited to watch a song that was born from such a sacred and personal season of my life continue to be welcomed into the lives of people all over the world.”"
