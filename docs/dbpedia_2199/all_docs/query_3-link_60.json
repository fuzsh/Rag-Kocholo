        "text": "Baku is back in the game! We were expecting good things from Samra, but Azerbaijan seem to have gone one step further. They’ve just released “Miracle”, along with its video — and it’s an absolute pop belter.\n\nOnce again, Azerbaijan have turned to Sweden for some help with their Eurovision song. The team behind the song has some real firepower too: Henrik Wikstrom has produced, amongst others, “Constellation Prize“, “Hope and Glory” and “Evighet“. He’s joined by Amir Aly and T.I. Jakke, so it’s clear that Azerbaijan have definitely put some resources behind Samra.\n\nSamra — “Miracle”\n\nThis is channelling some Safura-2010 realness, but Samra seems to add something a little bit more. We know that she has a killer voice from her performances on the Voice of Azerbaijan. She also certainly knows how to work the camera and looks stunning throughout the video. It’s simple now, but you get the feeling that Azerbaijan will really step up the staging when we get to Stockholm.\n\nAfter experimenting with “Start a Fire” and “Hour of the Wolf” in the past two years, it’s also good to see Azerbaijan going back to the traditional pop song that they’ve succeeded with in the past. “Miracle” has some real sassyness to it, with an empowerment message within the song to boot. The bridge in particular seems to be one of the strongest of the year. Y’all, this could be just what Azerbaijan needed to re-establish themselves at Eurovision.\n\nWhat do you think of “Miracle”? Is this the song that Azerbaijan need to return to the top ten? Let us know in the comments section below as well as via our Twitter page!"
