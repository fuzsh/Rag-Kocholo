        "text": "It is very easy to keep “In the Light of the Miracle” on loop. Like Arthur Russell, it contains multitudes and like Arthur Russell, it is full of life. I have no clue when he conceived this record, it was released in 1994 but given his death in 1992, the archival recording could have taken place any time after he moved to New York. It’s most likely that Russell wrote it whilst in his peak Dinosaur L days, rather than the later, more experimental years, but that’s the beauty of Arthur Russell; “In the Light of Miracle” and its birthdate could have been in any time period of Arthur. His genius never contained itself into genre. He was a vast force of brilliance, and this song is his crown jewel.\n\nIt is also strange to designate a descriptor for “In the Light of the Miracle”. Most websites use disco or garage house as a marker, but that doesn’t suit its majesty. There is an elegance found in few songs that stays ever-present here. Like a whisper that grows louder and louder but stays a whisper, you feel let in on something. The percussive element is unbelievable — constantly shifting and full of vigor. Russell creates a living breathing world through his composition, one that feels natural, like he manifested a scenic view into an instrumental.\n\nFew songs ever made have such an effervescent energy. One of the most admirable qualities of Russell was his deep empathy, and “In the Light of the Miracle” is the pinnacle of what he represented. His infusion of pathos throughout the track cannot be understated — it’s not only spoken to the listener but also in his collaborators, legends like Julius Eastman and Elodie Lauten. Russell, and by extension, “In the Light of the Miracle”, was communal, giving rather taking, and prizing the ideas of others that felt involved instead of predatory.\n\nVoltaire is attributed the old adage “If God didn’t exist it would be necessary to invent him”, but I’m grateful for Arthur Russell because we couldn’t have invented him. The work he produced is littered with unbridled magnetism, and “In the Light of the Miracle” is as much of a perfect encapsulation of Russell’s enormous brain as we could have ever hoped for. We don’t get to hear many perfect songs in this lifetime. At 13 minutes long, there’s a healthy time to savor the moment."
