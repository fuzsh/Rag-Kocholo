        "text": "Post by Juan Carlos on\n\n\"Miracle\"\n\nWritten by Adam Richard Wiles, Elena Jane Goulding, Matthew James Burns, deleted Bowman and Peter Rycroft\n\nProduced by Calvin Harris and BURNS\n\nNew single from Calvin Harris called \"Miracle\", which is collaboration with Ellie Goulding. The track was released on March 10.\n\nPost by TyðŸ¥¥ on\n\nPerched.\n\nHer last couple of DJ collaborations didn't impress me. But with Calvin I'm confident they'll provide some heat!\n\nPost by bat1990 on\n\nIt's time for the third installment of our banging song trilogy\n\nWhat I would be doing with Mr. Harris, given the opportunity\n\nPost by thezatch on\n\nIâ€™m ready for this to slay. Me thinks itâ€™s probably why her album was pushed back a little (just speculation on my part).\n\nPost by HamedM1 ðŸ’” on\n\nGod I'd kill for another song to devour me like I Need Your Love, still one of my favorite 2010s songs.\n\nPost by mccloud on\n\nKinda worried considering all the high profile features on Calvins flop singles from his latest album but remaining positive none the less.\n\nPost by Au$tin on\n\nI Need Your Love has quietly grown to become one of my all time favorite songs, but Outside I couldn't care less about, so I'm torn lol.\n\nPost by Juan Carlos on\n\nPreviewed by Ellie on TikTok Live. This is the trance banger I didn't know I needed.\n\nPost by die Lotterie on\n\nI didn't expect my favorite song of 2023 to be dropping this early into the year. Let's go!\n\nPost by Juan Carlos on\n\nIt's called Miracle and probably out March 10\n\nI'm kind of sure the release date was revealed by a reliable source, while the title is mentioned on his latest post in Instagram. Anyway, I was hoping he was going to release it as soon as this Friday to coincide with his concert in Peru, but I guess this won't be happening. Sigh!\n\nhttps://www.instagram.com/p/Co2hy-2pA-Y\n\nPost by Juan Carlos on\n\nPerformed for the very first time as the encore in his show in Lima, Peru tonight. It's very different from his previous songs because it's a trance/progressive dance track as previously mentioned. The verses are the same, which reminds me to \"Feel So Close\".\n\nPost by calvinharrisfan on\n\nPerformed for the very first time as the encore in his show in Lima, Peru tonight.

I mean, if Adam comes to my country, which was the second time since 2010 (!), it's a must to see him to perfom. Anyway, regarding your question, I assume there should be already a couple of videos floating around because there were many people who were recording it.\n\nPost by Juan Carlos on\n\nThis is the performance of \"Miracle\" that Adam did on his concert in Lima, Peru yesterday.\n\nPost by Juan Carlos on\n\nAvailable to pre-save and pre-add on streaming platforms here. Also, this is the artwork. Simple, but effective.\n\nPost by Juan Carlos on\n\nUntil we wait for the confirmation of the release date of the track, a minute version of the song has been uploaded to his YouTube official channel, which you could listen to it here. This is also the one which is used as a sound on TikTok. The track was written by Adam Richard Wiles, Elena Jane Goulding, deleted Bowman, Peter Rycroft and Matthew James Burns and it was produced by Calvin Harris and BURNS."
