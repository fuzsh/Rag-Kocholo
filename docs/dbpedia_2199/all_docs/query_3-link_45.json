        "text": "Brandon Lake has released one of his most personal songs to date! In \"MIRACLE CHILD,\" Lake delivers a powerful testimony of resurrection and redemption. The song narrates a journey from the brink to a life miraculously resurrected, echoing Jesus' triumphant power of death.\n\nRELATED CONTENT: ‘Gratitude’ Co-Writers Benjamin William Hastings & Brandon Lake Reunite For ‘Abandoned’\n\nThe lyrics to \"MIRACLE CHILD\" paint a vivid picture of a life once buried six feet under, with no hope in sight. Yet, we are armed with God's grace, and it is because of Him that we have protection from death. The chorus boldly challenges death itself, proclaiming, \"Death, where is your sting? My savior's word is final. I am resurrected, blood protected. I am a miracle child.\"\n\nRELATED CONTENT: Brandon Lake Releases Title Track \"COAT OF MANY COLORS\"\n\nThe song becomes an anthem of hope, extending a message to those facing daunting odds. It reassures that no life is too broken, no wounds too deep for the miracle-working God. The bridge magnifies the glory of the living, breathing God and the transformative power of miracle intervention.\n\n\"MIRACLE CHILD\" stands as Lake's poignant testimony of faith, redemption, and the miraculous power of a God who transforms the darkest chapters into stories of triumph.\n\nYou can hear \"MIRACLE CHILD\" playing on Air1 Radio Now!"
