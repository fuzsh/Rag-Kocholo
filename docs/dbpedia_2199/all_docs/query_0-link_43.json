        "text": "An uplifting movie usually owes a large amount of thanks to a similarly uplifting soundtrack. This is especially true in sports movies.\n\nThe right music matched with images of competition can elevate a scene to greatness, give us chills and stick in our heads forever, kept in the memory bank to be replayed whenever we accomplish something special in our own lives.\n\nMORE: Best sports movies | The inside story of how 'This Week in Baseball' got its iconic theme\n\nGood sports-movie music can also pump us up and inspire us. The inspiration might help us push through a workout, challenge us to be great at what we do, or just give us a boost to get through the day.\n\nHere are the 10 most inspiring sports-movie soundtracks of all time, ranked.\n\n10. 'Rocky IV' (Vince DiCola, 1985)\n\nFor the fourth “Rocky” installment, director Sylvester Stallone wanted a different musical sound and opted for composer Vince DiCola over franchise staple Bill Conti. The result was a quintessential ‘80s blend of synthesizers and drum machines that created the ideal accompaniment for Cold War-inspired training montages. Despite the dated approach, the music is still a fun listen. Standout tracks are “Training Montage” and “War.” Note: Some people believe that Europe’s now-ubiquitous “The Final Countdown” is from “Rocky IV,” but this is wrong. The instrumentation somewhat resembles DiCola’s “Training Montage” cue, though they are definitely very different.\n\n9. 'Tin Cup' (William Ross, 1996)\n\nWilliam Ross’ score to the Ron Shelton-directed golf dramedy is an eclectic mix of musical styles, but during the film’s final act the music gives the action a boost with old-fashioned orchestral bombast. Brass fanfares lead the way and help provide momentum as the finale plays out. The standout piece is “Master of the Game,” which scores Roy McAvoy’s historic final hole in dramatic and uplifting fashion.\n\n8. 'Remember the Titans' (Trevor Rabin, 2000)\n\nThe inspired-by-a-true-story football drama remains a favorite among many sports fans 15 years after its release. A big reason is composer Trevor Rabin’s orchestral-rock score that adds to the film’s emotional resonance. Rabin’s music is high on energy, which adds to the uplifting nature of the film. The score is also noteworthy for its inclusion in Barack Obama’s 2008 presidential campaign. Rabin’s one contribution to the CD soundtrack is the cut “Titans Spirit,” which is actually a suite of his music culled from various points in the film, but the seven-minute piece hits all the right highlights.\n\n7. 'Miracle' (Mark Isham, 2004)\n\nMark Isham’s music for the 2004 Hollywoodization of the 1980 Miracle on Ice is a slow build, but offers a big payoff. The score is heavy on warmth but not overly manipulative, and even the large orchestral climax seems a bit restrained for the genre. But the full unveiling of the main theme in the track “The Miracle” is enough to give you the chills. Interestingly, Isham’s “Miracle” music was also used to score the alternate ending to “Rocky Balboa” found on that film’s DVD.\n\n6. 'Chariots of Fire' (Vangelis, 1981)\n\nThough Vangelis’ Oscar-winning score is almost always used as parody these days, it was a groundbreaker in 1981 and the iconic, piano-led main theme remains quite an inspiring piece. Apart from the famous main theme, though, Vangelis’ other themes for the film are moving as well and offer evidence of the emotional range electronic music can provide. The electronic approach to a period sports drama was, and still is, the antithesis of convention. It not only works, but it has transcended the film to register in the greater conscience of pop culture, still inspiring would-be runners 34 years later.\n\n5. 'Hoosiers' (Jerry Goldsmith, 1986)\n\nThe beloved 1986 period basketball drama offered a prime opportunity for a composer to enhance the Americana through music, and Jerry Goldsmith pulls it off through an usual but effective mix of warm orchestral arrangements and electronic supplements — including the sampled sound of a bouncing basketball as a percussion component. Goldsmith’s main trumpet theme for the town of Hickory is both nostalgic and hopeful, while his scoring of the basketball sequences mirrors the energy and intensity of competition. The score builds to the stirring and triumphant cue “The Finals,” in which all themes are heard in their full, goosebump-inducing glory. Despite its sometimes dated sound (a product of the 1980s synthesizers), Goldsmith’s Oscar-nominated score still offers plenty of appeal.\n\n\"Hoosiers” bonus: Check out this video of Indiana’s buzzer beater against Kentucky from 2011, with Goldsmith’s music added. Pretty cool.\n\n4. 'Rocky' (Bill Conti, 1976)\n\nBill Conti’s iconic score to the 1976 Best Picture winner still feels omnipresent even after nearly 40 years. From the famous opening brass fanfare to the ‘70s-heavy “Gonna Fly Now,” the music has endured an inspired athletes and wannabe athletes for decades. Conti’s themes have made the rounds in recent weeks in commercials for Best Buy. Pro tip: Though “Gonna Fly Now” is the signature piece from the soundtrack, the cue “Going the Distance” is the best. You might know it without realizing it, as it’s been sampled in hip-hop music several times and was once featured prominently on the underrated and short-lived TV drama “Men of a Certain Age.”\n\n3. 'Field of Dreams' (James Horner, 1989)\n\n“Field of Dreams” as a movie is quite the psychological and emotional ride: mystery, nostalgia, longing, sadness, joy. Likewise, James Horner’s Oscar-nominated score is the perfect match. Ethereal soundscapes give way to eclectic, tender orchestrations and melancholy themes, and finally reward us with a full emotional payoff. It’s certainly not a traditional sports-movie soundtrack. There are no pulse-pounding themes to give a feel-good boost to winning montages, but the value of Horner’s music is in the deeper emotions it underscores. It’s a good listen for a rainy day. Standout tracks: “The Cornfield,” “Night Mists” and “The Place Where Dreams Come True.”\n\n2. 'The Natural' (Randy Newman, 1984)\n\nLike “Chariots of Fire,” the music of “The Natural” has transcended its film and established itself as a standalone piece of pop culture that has endured across three decades. Randy Newman’s Oscar-nominated score is indispensable within the film and is an inspiring piece of Americana outside it. The familiar six-note “home run call” in the brass was a staple of sports montages in the ‘80s and ‘90s, while other portions of the score have been featured in commercials and TV shows, including the series finale of the popular “The Wonder Years.” The music has also been parodied on “The Simpsons” on multiple occasions. As a whole, the score captures the beauty and majesty of baseball in musical form.\n\n1. 'Rudy' (Jerry Goldsmith, 1993)\n\nThe 1993 real life-ish football drama is at times heavy-handed, corny and forced, but Jerry Goldsmith’s fantastic score makes up for all that as it delivers the emotional goods. The score is a great listen apart from the movie, as it runs the gamut from tender to sweeping to power-football music. In other words, it’ll pump you up and give you the chills. Goldsmith’s score has been featured in countless sports montages and movie trailers during the past 22 years and endures as one of the best scores of the ‘90s from any genre. As a listening experience, the nearly 37-minute CD is perfect in its cue selection and sequencing. Standout tracks include “Tryouts,” “Take Us Out” and “The Final Game.”\n\nHonorable mentions\n\n'The Mighty Ducks' (David Newman, 1992)\n\nThough David Newman’s score for the 1992 Disney hockey film is at times quite derivative (likely because producers insisted that Newman mimic existing music from other films), there’s enough original material to warrant a mention on this list. Newman’s main theme for the Ducks is a catchy tune that he adapts well during the hockey sequences while also giving other action-oriented scenes an appropriate and effective emotional boost.\n\n'Angels in the Outfield' (Randy Edelman, 1994)"
