        "text": "26 January 2024 – Nashville, TN\n\nAs the home to many of today’s biggest artists, songs, and songwriters, Provident Entertainment/Sony Music continues to grow its roster by announcing the newest member to its family, Lizzie Morgan. With her first solo single out now, “Maybe The Miracle,” a music video accompanies the song and can be viewed below.\n\n“Releasing ‘Maybe the Miracle’ holds a profound significance for me—it goes beyond being just a song; it stands as concrete evidence of God’s unwavering sovereignty and redemption,” Morgan shares. “This song is a testament that even in the midst of devastation, miracles can unfold, underscoring the truth that we are never forgotten. I am deeply grateful for the valuable lesson my Grandparents imparted—to always maintain faith in the unfailing commitment of God! My earnest prayer is that this song becomes a source of hope for the despairing, faith for the doubting, and light for those who find themselves unable to see a way out.”\n\nLizzie Morgan’s professional music career quickly launched in 2017 when she began singing background vocals for multi-GRAMMY Award® winner Lauren Daigle. It was between tours that Morgan began honing in on her musical skills, performing with and writing for a variety of artists and projects including Matt Maher, Maverick City Music, Seasons Collective, Red Worship, and WILDER, a duo she formed with songwriter Stefan Cashwell. Their song, “Heaven’s Secrets,” achieved over 1M cumulative streams in its first year of release.\n\nYet it was growing up in Tennessee and being part of the church her grandparents started, Celebration of Life outside of Nashville, where Lizzie Morgan learned to sing and lead worship. Today, she continues to lead worship there while also splitting her time in San Jose, CA as part of the worship team at Redemption Church, the home of Red Worship."
