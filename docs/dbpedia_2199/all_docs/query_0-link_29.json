        "text": "“Padam Padam” further cemented its juggernaut status Sunday (Feb. 4), winning the new best pop dance recording Grammy during the 2024 Grammys Premiere Ceremony in Los Angeles.\n\nThis year is the first time the category has been included in the awards, with “Padam Padam” now the category’s first-ever winner.\n\nThe song beat Calvin Harris and Ellie Goulding’s “Miracle”; David Guetta, Anne-Marie and Coi Leray’s “Baby Don’t Hurt Me”; Troye Sivan’s “Rush”; and Bebe Rexha and David Guetta’s “One in a Million.”\n\nMinogue was not on hand, but “Padam Padam” co-writer Peter Rycroft (who produced the song as LostBoy) hit the stage to accept the award. “This is very surreal,” Rycroft said. “I just want to say thank you to the icon that is Kylie for believing in this record. It started in a tiny little studio in north London and she’s taken it around the world and I just want to give a big shout-out to Ina Wroldsen that I made the record with, means a lot. Thank you.”\n\nBackstage at the Premiere Ceremony, Rycroft told Billboard that the weirdest place he’s heard the wildly popular song was at a funeral. “It’s quite dark… [It’s the kind of setting where if] you’re not laughing, you’re crying,” he said.\n\nSpeaking to Billboard at the MusiCares 2024 Person of the Year gala earlier this weekend, Minogue said that for her, “There’s pre-‘Padam’ and post-‘Padam’ … two different parts of my life. Who knew? We didn’t know it would become a viral sensation, and it reconnects me with a lot of people, but also a different generation, so they’ve put ‘Padam’ with ‘Can’t Get You Out of My Head,’ 20 years apart but [they] kind of live together.”"
