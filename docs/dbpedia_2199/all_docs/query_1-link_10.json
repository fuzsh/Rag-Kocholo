Here is a special live performance of the song, \"Miracle Power\".\n\nWATCH: The song that started it all for We The Kingdom - \"Holy Water\"\n\n“As the opening line says, ‘This one’s for the lost and lonely.’ It’s a song for everyone because at the end of the day, we’ve all felt that way at some point in our lives,” We The Kingdom shares. “Miracles have a beautiful way of restoring childlike wonder back into the hearts of all of us....With ‘Miracle Power,’ our hope is that each ear that hears this song will let faith rise up and these lyrics sink in a bit deeper with each listen.”\n\nWe The Kingdom, who was named Contemporary Christian Artist of the Year at the 2021 Dove Awards, is comprised of brothers Ed Cash and Scott Cash, Ed's children Franni Rae Cash Cain and Martin Cash, and close family friend Andrew Bergthold, who all came together as musicians during a life-changing Young Life experience.\n\nWATCH: We The Kingdom's anthem of praise, \"God So Loved\""
