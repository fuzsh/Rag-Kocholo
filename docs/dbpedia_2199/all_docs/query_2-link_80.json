        "text": "The versatile band’s August 16 performance at The Bur Oak will be their last local performance for the foreseeable future.\n\nVanishing Kids’ Miracle Of Death came out last October and immediately registered as a high point in a discography that has traveled from eclectic post-punk to gorgeously mournful doom-metal. They’ve been busy since that album’s release, playing a handful of shows in Madison and embarking on a pair of national tours to promote Miracle Of Death. The second and final tour stretch concluded on July 27 at Reggies in Chicago. Vanishing Kids will play one more show and then, well, vanish. But only temporarily.\n\nOn Friday, August 16, the band will perform at The Bur Oak. In a series of email exchanges with Tone Madison, vocalist and keys player Nikki Drohomyreky confirms that it would be the band’s “last local performance for quite some time.” For the show, Vanishing Kids’ lineup will incorporate string player Gavin Epperson, who contributed both violin and viola work to Miracle Of Death. Epperson’s appearance will mark a “unique opportunity / special experience to see those songs with strings,” writes Drohomyreky.\n\nMiracle of Death by V A N I S H I N G K I D S"
