        "text": "Singer-songwriter Brennley Brown releases her newest single, “Miracle Story,” today (Provident Entertainment/Sony Music). Produced by GRAMMY Award winner Luke Wooten (Dierks Bentley, Brad Paisley, The SteelDrivers), click HERE to listen to the track.\n\nCo-writing the song along with noted songwriters Mia Fieldes and Mitch Wong, “Miracle Story” is a powerful and inspirational reminder that God is always ahead of us, crafting pages of glory and orchestrating miracles we can’t see yet.\n\n“My hope for this song is that it will be a reminder that no matter what you’re facing, God has already gone before us to make a way where there seems to be no way and write a miracle story as only He can,” Brown shares. “For every person still in the waiting, don’t lose heart. He’s not finished yet and is taking all things from broken to beautiful.”\n\nRaised on a ranch in Apple Valley, California, Brown has deep roots in traditional country and Gospel music woven within her deep faith in God, and “Miracle Story” is a beautiful blend of the two. Committed to her craft since she was only nine years old, audiences may already be familiar with Brown from her tenure on season 12 of NBC’s Emmy Award-winning show, “The Voice.” Making it to the top five when she was 14, People Magazine hailed her as a standout performer and Blake Shelton shared she was an “inspiration for young people.”\n\nBrennley Brown has also made a name for herself in the voice-over world, landing her first role at age 11 in the Emmy award-winning Disney series “Sofia the First.” She currently voices the lead role of Leyla on the Netflix animated series “Dragon: Rescue Riders,” where she also sings on the show.\n\nStorytelling – the hallmark of country music and genre artists like Emmylou Harris, Willie Nelson, Kris Kristofferson, and Waylon Jennings, plus the voices of Linda Ronstadt and Patty Griffin – are all foundational to Brown. Combined with her unwavering faith, these musical icons have influenced her to be an artist who brings a new, unique sound to Country Christian music. Now residing in Nashville, she signed with Provident Entertainment/Sony Music, her label home that shares in her sincere love of Jesus, her gift for creating songs with a hopeful message, and an authentic intention to bring a pure, honest spirit to a wide audience.\n\nShe will continue to release new music this spring and summer with an EP slated for this fall. On June 9, she will make her fourth appearance at CMA Music Fest on the Hard Rock Stage in Nashville, TN."
