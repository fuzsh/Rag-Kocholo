        "text": "Brad Paisley knows how to mark his wedding anniversary.\n\nMonday, four days before his 16th anniversary with his wife, actress Kimberly Williams-Paisley, the country singer released his new single “My Miracle,” which is all about his wife.\n\n“There’s a long list of men who became much better people because of a woman, who found their faith, who found who they were supposed to be, whose lives were saved because of the woman in their lives,” Paisley said on social media. “I feel like I’m one of those men, and that’s what this song is about.”\n\nLyrics include: \"My miracle is 5’5”/ No doubt in my mind, she’s the reason I’m alive/ I wasn’t always spiritual/ Oh, but one thing’s for sure/ How could I not have faith in the God that created her?\"\n\nPaisley co-wrote the love song with Gary Nicholson. “My Miracle” was produced by Dann Huff and Luke Wooten and executive produced by Kendal Marcy.\n\n“I can be a little ornery when it comes to writing love songs,” Paisley said. “I don’t typically put it all out there, but in this one I did. This is the most powerful statement I think I can make. The one I wrote it for, she is my worst critic typically, but in this case I think I got it right.”\n\n“My Miracle” is on country radio and available at digital retailers."
