        "text": "I′ve heard all the stories hundreds of times\n\nThe light and the glory, the wonders and signs\n\nI never imagined or dared to believe\n\nThat something so holy could happen for me\n\nBut standing here with you\n\nNo way I could deny\n\nThe God who walked on waves\n\nSent you to change my life\n\nI used to think miracles had to be\n\nWater turned to wine or the parting of a sea\n\nBut when I look in your eyes, I see heaven break through\n\nAnd it's making me believe my miracle is You\n\nMy words can′t explain it, but my heart knows it's real\n\n'Cause my broken pieces have started to heal\n\nLike truth for a doubter, like sight for the blind\n\nYour love shows me power from something divine\n\nI used to think miracles had to be\n\nWater turned to wine or the parting of a sea\n\nBut when I look in your eyes, I see heaven break through\n\nAnd it′s making me believe my miracle is You\n\nOoh-ooh, it′s You\n\nOoh-ooh\n\nSomehow you were the answer to all the prayers I prayed\n\nI guess that's what they meant by mysterious ways\n\nI used to think miracles had to be\n\nWater turned to wine or the parting of a sea\n\nBut when I look in your eyes, I see heaven break through\n\nAnd it′s making me believe my miracle is You\n\nYeah, it's easy to believe\n\nMy miracle is you\n\nOoh-ooh-ooh, it′s you\n\nWriter(s): Paul T.
