        "text": "If you thought I sounded like a \"get off my lawn\" kind of guy in my article about getting idiots out of the pits, hold onto your seat.\n\nFor those that didn't read my article, let me recap. Your kids are ruining the Mississippi Valley Fair concerts. Dang, I thought that was going to take longer.\n\nWell, to be a little more specific, people throwing beers, acting stupid, and fighting each other are really making it hard to enjoy the awesome concerts at the fair, especially this year.\n\nWhat's the solution? Getting these childish \"adults\" and stupid, underage kids away from people having a good time. Sure, that's a pretty impossible task but one can only hope for a Christmas miracle.\n\nAlready looking ahead to the 2025 Mississippi Valley Fair, the fair board and its general manager are already thinking of ways to pick out those bad apples and never see them again. Before we get to one of those ways to pull these morons off my lawn... I mean out of the pit, let's recap why this is even a conversation.\n\nT-Pain Goes Off On Mississippi Valley Fair Crowd\n\nIn the middle of his set on the grandstand stage at the Mississippi Valley Fair on Thursday night, T-Pain stopped the show to tell the crowd something they might not know. He can leave if he wants, especially if he's feeling disrespected, and he definitely was.\n\nHe was feeling disrespected because people were throwing things in the crowd and eventually on stage. This beer which got thrown at him on the stage is what set him off.\n\nAfter that Busch Light can splattered beer on the thrust of the stage and landed between T-Pain and his DJ, T-Pain had enough and went off, as he should have.\n\nThe video below shows him in the middle of almost a 3-minute about feeling disrespected and informing the crowd he can leave if he wants. In every contract for every artist in every genre of music, they have a clause that essentially says that if they feel threatened or in danger, they can cut the show short and still get paid. That includes things getting thrown at them.\n\nLuckily, T-Pain is a nice enough guy and patient enough that he ended up doing the rest of the show, except for maybe the last 15 minutes or so.\n\nBut as T-Pain points out in this scolding of the crowd, the people disrespecting him and throwing stuff are a few pieces of sh*t. Those few pieces of crap were really ruining it for the rest of us and I wasn't even in the thick of it.\n\nBut the fair wants the beer can throwers and troublemakers out of there as soon as you commit an act of dipsh*tery. They are already thinking of ways to catch you in 2025.\n\nMississippi Valley Fair Will Step Up Security In 2025, Adding New Technology\n\nShawn Loter, General Manager of the Mississippi Valley Fair, joined Dwyer & Michaels on Wednesday morning to recap the fair including the good, the bad, and the ugly.\n\nDuring the show, they talked about the elephant in the room which we recapped above. But Shawn said in 2025, they will be stepping up security measures and that includes adding drones potentially.\n\nThat's right. Shawn is going to work with law enforcement and the security company onsite to try to catch the little party foulers. One way to do that is with drones. They actually had a drone flying around this year for promotional videos which I'm excited to see.\n\nOh, and in case you or your trash kid was one of those beer throwers this year, we now know what happens to those who get caught. Shawn said they did catch quite a few this year and here is the punishment for that:\n\nTrespassed from the fairgrounds for the rest of the fair\n\n$650 fine\n\nI'm not going to lie, I have a pretty good arm but a drone has a lens that zooms in way further. If you think that as a junior in high school on the varsity team, you can throw a tallboy at a drone from the pit, you might as well not even get your Fun Card for next year.\n\nShawn also mentioned that they'll be working on adding more security next year within the pits. By the way, thanks to the awesome security personnel and the law enforcement at the fair the entire 6-days sweating their butts off in uniform. I thought I was hot in a T-shirt and shorts...\n\nWe'll put this year behind us soon enough and truly we can't wait for MVF 2025. Just a reminder, school starts this month so make sure you bring your kids there. Thanks."
