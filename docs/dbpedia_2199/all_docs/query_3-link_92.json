        "text": "'Dance wiv Me' - Dizzee Rascal featuring Calvin Harris and Chrome, 2008\n\nAfter releasing his debut album 'I Created Disco' in 2007, Calvin and Dizzee met at a festival that year. Dizzee had been a huge fan of 'Acceptable in the '80s', and the pair discussed working together. Calvin said of the collaboration: \"Dizzee texted me, saying he'd done this a cappella over someone else's music, but his verse was too good for their music, so could he do it with me instead? So I spent a long time on it, to make sure it lived up to his expectations. I sent him the track, and he called me at 2 in the morning to say it was amazing, so I knew it was good.\"\n\nWatch the video on YouTube here.\n\n'Bounce' - featuring Kelis, 2011\n\nCalvin's next major collab came in the form of 2011 summer anthem 'Bounce' starring Kelis. The first single from his third album '18 Months', 'Bounce' peaked at Number 2 in the UK charts after being kept off the top spot by Example's 'Changed the Way You Kiss Me'.\n\nThe song also marked Calvin's decision to stop singing on his tracks; he said: \"I'll do tracks with people who can sing well â€“ proper artists, proper performers. I can focus on what I'm much better at, which is making music. I'm just not cut out for that role. I kind of fell into it a few years ago â€“ the live show had to happen, I had to be the frontman because I was doing the vocals on the songs. It went all right. I spent a few years trying to get it really properly good, but it dawned on me it wasn't going to get much better. I've taken the singing thing as far as I can.\"\n\nWatch the video on YouTube here.\n\n'We Found Love' - Rihanna featuring Calvin Harris, 2011\n\nTeaming up with Rihanna for another 2011 summer banger, 'We Found Love' went to Number 1 in the UK and was certified 5x Platinum, selling over 10 million copies worldwide. Former X Factor star Leona Lewis was originally going to sing the song, but she didn't commit and it went to Rihanna instead.\n\nCalvin said of the song: \"'We Found Love,' is the most successful thing I've done ever... It's not strictly a song by me, obviously, it's by Rihanna. She sings it...It was great to work with her... No one could have taken it as far as she did. You can't escape it in America. I've heard it a lot. I've heard it probably more times today than I did when I was mixing it. Which is a good thing.\"\n\nWatch the video on YouTube here.\n\n'Sweet Nothing' - featuring Florence Welch, 2012\n\nAfter working on a remix of Florence and the Machine's 2012 single 'Spectrum' from their second album 'Ceremonials', Calvin became interested in working with lead singer Florence Welch. She wasn't immediately available, but he finally tracked her down and they worked together on 'Sweet Nothing'.\n\nHe said: \"With Florence, she was really busy at that time. She was in the middle of a tour and she had like three days to record something, so I wasn't there, anything could've come back. I didn't think she'd do it. She seemed a really unattainable artist to reach for. I think she would've done it if the song was right and the people were right and it was all at the right time.\"\n\nWatch the video on YouTube here.\n\n'I Need Your Love' - featuring Ellie Goulding, 2013\n\nEllie and Calvin sparked dating rumours with their collaboration 'I Need Your Love' in 2012, appearing on '18 Months' as well as Ellie's album 'Halcyon'. It peaked at Number 4 in the UK, and was nominated for both British Single of the Year and British Video of the Year at the BRIT Awards 2014.\n\nWatch the video on YouTube here.\n\n'This Is What You Came For' - featuring Rihanna, 2016\n\nCalvin once again teamed up with Rihanna for 2016 single 'This Is What You Came For', peaking at Number 2 in the UK. It was co-written by Calvin's former girlfriend Taylor Swift, who used pseudonym Nils SjÃ¶berg initially as she did not want their relationship to overshadow the success of the song. It has since been changed.\n\nWatch the video on YouTube here.\n\n'One Kiss' - with Dua Lipa, 2018\n\n'One Kiss' was a worldwide smash hit, peaking at Number 1 in the UK and spending a whopping eight weeks at the top. It was the biggest-selling song of 2018, and was also the third longest-running Number 1 of the century by a female artist. It also won Best British Single at the BRIT Awards 2019.\n\nWatch the video on YouTube here."
