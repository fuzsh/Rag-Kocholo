        "text": "Released in 1989, Queen’s thirteenth studio album, The Miracle, is a remarkable, significant, and memorable musical achievement. Recorded during a period of personal trauma, for both Brian May and Freddie Mercury, the built-up angst was reappropriated superbly with creative energy that will captivate you from the very first note to the last. Featuring a blend of rock, pop, and operatic influences, The Miracle is one of Queen’s greatest records and is a landmark release from the era.\n\nWhile the music is, naturally, the most important aspect, the cover art for The Miracle is interesting. While I neither love nor hate it, it’s compelling to look at while the album is playing. I’d love to offer a reason as to why I find it captivating, but words somewhat escape me for it’s far from Queen’s best album artwork, yet it is strangely perfectly suited to the band.\n\nMoving our attention to the sonic qualities of the album, as one might expect, the recording, mix, and mastering of The Miracle is beyond reproach. However, not all editions are created equal, despite the same core remastering. For instance, the vinyl edition from the Queen Studio Collection is nothing short of perfection with a warm, detailed, and enveloping sound. The CD release is equally impressive but lacks the tonal warmth that is a trademark of vinyl records. Whereas, the lossless Apple Music stream, an Apple Digital Master, sounds a little concealed and somewhat muffled by comparison. It isn’t fatiguing to listen to and remains thoroughly enjoyable, but the presentation isn’t as bold as it, arguably, could be.\n\nParty is a fun high-energy tune that sets the tone for the music to come. With its dynamic guitar riffs and lively vocals, it may be short, but it flows quickly into Khashoggi’s Ship.\n\nKhashoggi’s Ship continues the vibrant energy with a fast-paced rock sound, but the jolt between the opening song and this one can take a moment for the senses to adjust to. As the song progresses, it becomes apparent that this is an album-only number that is unlikely to be memorable. Still, for an album to be exceptional, all songs need not be a hit. With that in mind, Khashoggi’s Ship holds the album together as we head towards the title track.\n\nThe Miracle is a multi-layered masterpiece that is characterised by lush harmonies and a sweeping melody that combine to create an anthemic feel. It’s, subsequently, a perfect title track and while repeat plays can cause this incredible tune to become a little fatiguing, due to the chosen vocal style, there is little doubt as to why it has become such a popular tune amongst fans.\n\nI Want It All is a powerful rock anthem and one of the very best hard rock songs Queen ever recorded. Featuring a memorable guitar solo by Brian May, and assertive vocals by Mercury, I Want It All is impossible to not sing along to for it’s an unforgettable Queen classic.\n\nThe Invisible Man sounds as if it was leftover from Queen’s Flash Gordon soundtrack. Despite that, The Invisible Man, with its quirky and innovative sound, showcases Queen’s ability to blend rock with a touch of funk and pop. The result is a catchy synth-driven tune with a unique charm that will appeal to just about anyone.\n\nBreakthru is an uplifting and dynamic track that starts with a gentle vocal intro before transitioning into a driving rock rhythm. With its energetic tempo, infectious chorus, and blend of synthetic and electric guitar elements, Breakthru creates a sense of urgency and excitement that makes it one of the more compelling tunes from the album.\n\nRain Must Fall adds a touch of Caribbean influence to the album, with its laid-back rhythm and breezy melody. It’s most certainly an album-only tune and while it could be said that it isn’t the strongest song from the record, it surprisingly doesn’t feel out of place. Featuring a smooth blend of percussion, gentle guitar riffs and an associated solo, along with Mercury’s soothing vocals, you’ll be in a relaxed state to appreciate the hidden gem of the album; Scandal.\n\nScandal is utterly brilliant and is not only one of the best songs that Queen ever recorded, but it’s one of the best songs from the 80s. That said, you won't find it on any compilation release, most likely due to its lacklustre chart performance when released as a single. Nevertheless, the riff and rhythm are off-the-charts and it’s impossible to sit still while this unforgettable tune is playing.\n\nMy Baby Does Me has a smooth, laid-back, rhythm with some lovely bass tracking and some thoroughly enjoyable guitar licks. It’s an album-only tune, yes, but one that works extremely well within the tracking of the record.\n\nWas It All Worth It is an incredible closer; one that will compel you to play the album again. Initially, things start on a gentler note, but the moment May’s riff comes into the mix, you know you’re in for a treat as the multi-layered production makes it thoroughly pleasing to listen to.\n\nUltimately, The Miracle is one of the greatest albums Queen ever released and stands as a powerful testament to the band’s enduring spirit and musical ingenuity, despite periods of personal struggle. While every song may not be a hit, each track showcases a different facet of Queen’s versatility. From Freddie Mercury's charismatic presence to Brian May's masterful guitar work, along with Roger Taylor's dynamic drumming and John Deacon's solid bass lines, The Miracle offers a cohesive yet varied musical journey that has remained timeless and is one of the greatest albums released in the late 80s."
