        "text": "It’s been nine long years since Calvin Harris and Ellie Goulding’s “Outside” reached meteoric success. Earlier this year, the pair revealed that they were back together in the studio and even gave us a teaser of their new song. Today, the powerhouse duo are finally ready to release their latest track, “Miracle.”\n\n“Miracle” draws heavily on 90s/early 2000s dance music with a fast-paced euro trance beat and over-the-top melodic dance-pop melodies. Ellie Goulding’s angelic vocals sound right at home over the production to round out one of the catchier bops we’ve heard so far this year.\n\nThe track is a powerful dose of nostalgia that only further cements the incredible musical bond these two share. Stream the track below and enjoy!\n\nCalvin Harris & Ellie Goulding – Miracle"
