        "text": "This article reviews the evidence for the medieval performance of the Cantigas de Santa Maria (CSM) and discusses King Alfonso's intentions for the work, including the intended audience. The CSM were conceived as an ambitious cultural enterprise with both religious and political objectives, but were doomed to failure by the steep political decline of their creator. The only surviving evidence for the CSM's presence in any court outside Alfonso's is the Barbieri MS, an eighteenth-century descendant of a lost original, plausibly transmitted to the Portuguese court before 1270. Other traces of performative use are rubrics and marginal notes in an appendix to manuscript To and their corresponding reworking in manuscript E, which point to short-lived ritual use. Internal iconographical, literary, and compositional evidence suggests that Alfonso did intend the CSM to circulate among a broad range of social classes. He manipulated poetic and metrical forms from the troubadour tradition to highlight the dignity of the Virgin Mary, but he privileged forms directly inspired by the Andalusian zajal familiar to popular audiences and among the minstrels, to encourage the penetration of his songs beyond his courtly circle. The CSM were meant to consolidate Christian restoration in the recently conquered southern territories, but also to serve as personal and dynastic propaganda, asserting their author's royal supremacy over Castilian lords, his preeminence among Iberian kings, and his status as the Christian monarch most worthy of the office of Holy Roman emperor.\n\nCentral to the world of thirteenth‐century Galician‐Portuguese song are the Cantigas de Santa Maria (CSM), on whose narrative cantigas de miragre this article focuses. These songs comprise alternations between a refrain and strophes that finish by reiterating the refrain's metre, rhymes and melody. Combining the strictly linear narrative of the miracle cantiga with this cyclical framework poses manifold complications. Self‐contained narrative logic is divided by interstrophic refrains, and chains of thought are divided by destabilising chains of interstrophic enjambment. This setup in the cantigas de miragre is rendered all the more curious given that few comparable instances of cyclical structure and linear narrative occur elsewhere in late‐medieval vernacular repertoire. In essence, concatenating the linear with the circular does not – and perhaps should not – work in narrative song. In this article, I examine how the cantigas de miragre navigate this dichotomy. Parsing the musical, poetic and narrative structures of CSM 232, I demonstrate how the sonically tenacious refrain, recapped within the latter part of each strophe as the strophe‐b, works to highlight the narrative thrust of a miracle story. The memorially marked recurrence of refrain metre, rhymes and melody in the strophe‐b functions as a device to separate the narratively central from the extraneous. It thereby exposes a miracle song's essential message to its audience. Through the analysis of CSM 232, this article highlights the fundamental role of sonic memory in late‐medieval vernacular song.\n\nWinner of the 2018 Best Early Career Article Prize from the Association of Spanish and Portuguese Historical Studies There exist a range of crusading sources, often well-known texts, that are currently not being as extensively used as they could be. The Cantigas de Santa María, typically read as a devotional text in praise of the Virgin Mary and descriptive of miracles worked through her intercession, is a central document for understanding crusading mentalities in thirteenth-century Castile. This article will examine three particular characteristics – Mary as intercessor, Mary as warrior, and Mary as missionary – to demonstrate one avenue through which the court of Alfonso X of Castile (r. 1252–1284) projected royal ideas about crusading. Even though much of Alfonso X's crusading efforts came to naught, Alfonso's vision, encoded within the Cantigas de Santa María, is a means through which historians can more fully illuminate the rhetoric of crusade in the thirteenth century."
