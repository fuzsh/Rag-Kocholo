        "text": "Song Information\n\nArtist: USAO\n\nComposition/Arrangement: USAO\n\nBPM: 210\n\nLength: 2:02\n\nGenre: FRENCHCORE\n\nMovie: VJ GYO\n\nFirst Music Game Appearance: beatmania IIDX 21 SPADA\n\nOther Music Game Appearances: None.\n\nLyrics\n\nNone.\n\nSong Connections / Remixes\n\nMiracle 5ympho X shares similarities with an earlier USAO song, Awesome My New Kick! from HARDCORE TANO*C album SPEEDBALL GT.\n\nBoth songs have the \"MACHINE GUN!\" voice sample.\n\nIt also shares some traits with 5ymphoTEK, a previous USAO song released on his first album, Kicks for Liberation.\n\nAn extended version of Miracle 5ympho X appears in the beatnation RHYZE vs HARDCORE TANO*C album, and in USAO's second anthology album, USAO ULTIMATE HYPER BEST.\n\nA remix by Kobaryo, titled Miracle 5ympho X (Kobaryo's FTN-Remix), also can be found in USAO ULTIMATE HYPER BEST.\n\nMiracle 5ympho X shares the \"Party!\" sample with 私をディスコに連れてって TOKYO, from REFLEC BEAT VOLZZA.\n\nMiracle 5ympho X shares the \"Rude boy bass, mash up the place\" sample with Butterfly Twist, from SOUND VOLTEX VIVID WAVE.\n\nTrivia\n\nMiracle 5ympho X is the first BEMANI song labeled under the FRENCHCORE genre.\n\nFrenchcore (or Tribalcore) is a subgenre of hardcore/rave music born in France. Frenchcore tracks generally run at a high tempo, between 190 and 240 BPM, and is characterized by a tight, bouncy kick.\n\nAccording to USAO, the 5 in Miracle 5ympho X's name was chosen because it looked cool, and not for any particular reason.\n\nThe video for Miracle 5ympho X was done by re-editing a generic video from beatmania IIDX 8th style.\n\nAccording to VJ GYO, the original gun in Miracle 5ympho X's video was going to be a X-shaped, multi-barrel Gatling gun, but he changed it to a machine gun when taking into account that such a big gun would be very difficult for a small girl to hold.\n\nHe also notes that the girl in the video's name is Mirabelle Shinho Exbrayat. Exbrayat is a French last name.\n\nMiracle 5ympho X is available in beatmania IIDX INFINITAS as part of the beatmania IIDX INFINITAS Music Pack vol.7 (beatmania IIDX INFINITAS 楽曲パック vol.7).\n\nMiracle 5ympho X received LEGGENDARIA charts in beatmania IIDX 31 EPOLIS' ARENA MODE. They can be unlocked from February 22nd, 2024 through March 4th, 2024 by collecting 100 ARENA CUBES.\n\nSong Production Information\n\nUSAO\n\nYo everyone!!! USAO here!! Yeah to all of my blood brothers!!\n\nI've been so tense, my head's been spinning round and round ><\n\nUgh... my stomach's been hurtin' so bad... I've been wanting to go home...\n\nBut I'm OK now! Making such strong music has made me feel better! Thanks everyone!\n\nYes! I mean that! Now I've also officially joined the group!\n\nI've put in more speed and more chaotic fun \\word/\n\nMiracle super X! Twice as fast!!\n\nI'm so excited! Such a cool dubstep song♪ Ya! (laughs)\n\n~faints~\n\nYeah, this song is from a little-known genre called FRENCHCORE\n\nAs a result of thinking about various ways to make the song more interesting, I decided to incorporate different genres into it.\n\nI was so busy making this song, I really didn't have time to identify a true genre for it, but I think the song follows the main elements of this genre.\n\nThere really isn't any meaning behind the song title, but I thought it had a nice ring to it. I changed the S to a 5 because I think it looked cooler and added the X because it made the title sound stronger.\n\nCome play this song because I think it will make you laugh.\n\nVideo Production Information\n\nVJ GYO\n\n\"Are you ready? ...Machine gun.\" \"Yeah!!\"\n\nI was beginning to make a nice video but something was pointed out to me.\n\nThe video and storyboard were set for production, but the design of the machine gun worried me a lot.※\n\nBy the way, while I'm at it, the name of the girl is Mirabelle Shinho Exbrayat.\n\n※ Although I really wanted a multi-barreled Gatling gun design with four magazines forming an X, I realized that such a small girl couldn't really carry such a weapon, much less fire it.\n\nSo instead, I decided to design a rotary-type automatic magazine for the machine gun.\n\nSince a gas-powered bullet feed to the magazine would be very unlikely, I made an electric chain gun system instead.\n\nDifficulty & Notecounts\n\nbeatmania IIDX difficulty rated from 1 to 12. (Ratings and notecounts obtained from BEMANIWiki 2nd.)"
