        "text": "Nashville, TN - (November 20, 2020) – With the release of Chris Tomlin’s official video for “Miracle Of Love” today, the GRAMMY ® winning performer becomes the first artist in the Christian genre to exclusively premiere a music video on Facebook. Chris now joins the likes of Bon Jovi, Katy Perry, Chris Stapleton, Carrie Underwood and other A-list artists who have also debuted videos with Facebook. “Miracle Of Love” is the title track from Chris’ Miracle Of Love: Christmas Songs of Worship EP released in October. Building on Chris’ #1 radio single “Who You Are to Me” feat. Lady A, “Miracle Of Love” is already receiving Christian radio airplay as we head into holiday season.\n\nThe live performance video was shot in Nashville earlier this month and was directed by Patrick Tohill. Chris’ youngest daughter Madison, age 6, makes a cameo at the beginning of the clip sharing what her Christmas morning will be like this year with a new baby sister. Watch it HERE on Facebook.\n\nChris revealed to People Magazine the inspiration behind the EP’s title track is the new baby he and his wife are expecting to arrive just before Christmas. “Christmas is about celebrating a gift from God, a surprise child for Joseph and Mary, a true Miracle Of Love. For me, it is another gift to be able to write a song about the surprise of our third baby girl and the parallel story of the birth of Jesus. As a songwriter, I felt so inspired and loved how each line of the song could have a double meaning.”\n\nChris’ Miracle Of Love: Christmas Songs of Worship EP includes two new songs, “Miracle Of Love'' and “All the World Awaits (Hosanna)”. The project also contains the songs from his 2019 Christmas Day: Christmas Songs of Worship EP as well as “Noel” featuring Lauren Daigle originally released in 2015. Get the EP HERE.\n\nMiracle Of Love: Christmas Songs of Worship Track Listing:\n\n1 “Miracle Of Love”\n\n2 “All The World Awaits (Hosanna)”\n\n3 “Christmas Day” (feat. We The Kingdom)\n\n4 “His Name Is Wonderful”\n\n5 “Little Drummer Boy”\n\n6 “Hope Of Israel”\n\n7 “Noel” (feat. Lauren Daigle)\n\nMiracle Of Love: Christmas Songs of Worship follows Chris’ #1 debuting album Chris Tomlin & Friends released this summer. That project includes 13 tracks with Chris featuring superstars Florida Georgia Line, who also executive produced the album, Lady A and Thomas Rhett as well as several of today’s biggest country music artists including Russell Dickerson, Chris Lane, RaeLynn, Cassadee Pope and Brett Young in addition to Bear Rinehart of NEEDTOBREATHE, Blessing Offor and We The Kingdom. The album debuted at #1 on Billboard’s Christian Albums Chart, at #5 on Billboard’s Digital Albums Chart and #9 on Billboard’s Top Current Albums Chart. Chris Tomlin & Friends includes two songs that hit Spotify’s US Viral 50 chart, “Thank You Lord” and “Who You Are To Me” featuring Lady A, which has reigned at #1 for five consecutive weeks on Billboard’s Christian Airplay chart. This makes the single Tomlin’s second longest running #1 after his 14 week run with “Whom Shall I Fear (God of Angel Armies)”\n\nTomorrow, Chris will perform on the Grand Ole Opry along with Lady A, Russell Dickerson and more. The Opry airs on Circle TV, Gray TV stations, DISH Studio Channel 102, Sling TV and other TV affiliates as well as on streaming partners Roku, Inc., Samsung TV Plus, VIZIO FREE Channels and XUMO, and can be heard on SiriusXM as well as the Opry’s flagship home 650 WSM AM and wsmonline.com.\n\nAbout Chris Tomlin\n\nIt is estimated that 20-30 million people across the world sing one of Chris’ songs every week in church services in nearly every language. Time magazine heralded him as the “most often sung artist in the world” as his music has inspired and uplifted an entire generation of believers. Along the way, he’s scored 17 Number one singles at radio, sold more than nine million albums, earned a Grammy, three Billboard Music Awards, 21 Dove Awards and became a two-time BMI Songwriter of the Year honoree. His current radio single featuring Lady A, “Who You Are To Me,” has become Chris’ 29th Top 10 single, giving him more Top 10 singles than any other Christian artist. In 2016, he was named one of only four artists ever to receive the Sound Exchange Digital Radio Award (to confirm the only winners still) for over 1 Billion digital radio streams, alongside Justin Timberlake, Pitbull and Garth Brooks. Chris is also the first Christian artist to reach the Billion streams threshold on Pandora and was presented with their BILLIONAIRE award. His tours have sold-out venues everywhere, including New York City’s Madison Square Garden, Hollywood Bowl in Los Angeles, Nashville’s Bridgestone Arena and Red Rocks."
