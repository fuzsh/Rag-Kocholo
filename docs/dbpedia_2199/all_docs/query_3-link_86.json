        "text": "The highly anticipated, old-school-full third conjoint work of the duo is finally out.\n\nPlease notice this is part six of an ongoing news piece. Click here to read the previous entry.\n\nThe wait is over, at last! The hottest collaborators of the past months, we’re talking Calvin Harris and Ellie Goulding, have finally released their single ‘Miracle‘. ‘Miracle’ is the third collaboration of the two, a partnership that started way back in 2012. The three-part series started with ‘I Need Your Love‘, and then, two years later, in 2014, ‘Outside‘ was unveiled. It took a while for them to write something together once again, and today, having passed nearly 9 years since their last work, they’ve switched the BPMs up a notch, gone completely old school, and created this new song.\n\nThe ‘Miracle’\n\nIn case you haven’t been around for a while, or haven’t looked into this story as it happened, Harris and Goulding came together for a studio session mid-January, and they’d update on the upcoming song every now and then (read previous article entries for context). Finally, a couple of days ago, he premiered the song during his South America tour, where the first crowd to hear ‘Miracle’ in full was Lima, Peru. Chile and Argentina followed, and they all had the chance to listen to the song.\n\nThis song waits absolutely no time building up to Ellie’s angelical voice: it opens with it. And with a line so memorable we’ve been singing it since the second part of this news thread:\n\nWhen you hold me\n\nThere’s a place I go\n\nIt’s a different high, oh no\n\n-Calvin Harris, Ellie Goulding ‘Miracle’\n\nYou’ll start to hear old-school ambient pads, and just when Ellie comes back onto the mic, nostalgia hits: kick, offbeat bass, and her voice. Nothing else. So 90s! Some Euro memories are bound to happen in this part of the song, but in case it doesn’t hit you, even after the roll of hi-hats, well, then there’s the piano melody! More 90s nostalgia for you! I personally jumped out of my chair when I heard it for the first time, with goosebumps and all. It’s a true trip down memory lane.\n\nIs it Robert Miles? Is it Alice Deejay? No, it’s Calvin Harris, and it’s Ellie Goulding, and it’s a wave of sounds coming back to mainstages all over the world! Have a listen below.\n\nIs Trance coming back, at long last?\n\nAfter this song, and mainly who the artists behind it are, the question is put on the table yet again: could this year be the one in which Trance comes back to its glory days? With several artists bringing melodic bits to Techno and making the bridge between the two (i_o and Charlotte de Witte to name a few), and some others such as Hardwell and Maddix with their take on ‘Take Me Away‘ and Oliver Heldens reworking Kate Ryan‘s ‘Désenchantée‘, it seems like the genre is slowly but surely climbing its way back into the throne.\n\nFor now, all that remains is to compile recordings of these artists playing these songs and paying attention to the reaction of the crowd. And, of course, to enjoy ‘Miracle’ for months to come. Who would’ve thought Ellie’s voice sounded so good in that style of music!"
