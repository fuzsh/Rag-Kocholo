        "text": "After a whirlwind summer of touring, Mayday Parade have shared their stirring new single ‘Miracle’.\n\nThe new track follows the release of their previous singles shared earlier this year, ‘Got Me All Wrong’ and ‘More Like A Crash’.\n\nAll of these releases have been shared independently, having fulfilled their most recent record deal with the release of their seventh studio album ‘What It Means To Fall Apart’.\n\nYou can check out the new track ‘Miracle’ via its video below.\n\nDescribing the new track and the context within which it was written, the band’s Jake Bundrick has explained:\n\n“‘Miracle’ is a song I started working on during our ‘Sunnyland’ record (2018) and didn’t fully complete until after we finished recording our ‘What It Means To Fall Apart’ record in 2021.\n\n“I was in a darker place in life during that span and was silently fighting for air. I felt alone and scared to talk about my feelings with anyone else including the people closest to me.\n\n“Life was happening way too fast for me and I wasn’t ready for it or able to accept what was happening. I felt alone and knew I needed to talk about it but didn’t know how.\n\n“Organically the song just came together and was the culmination of that entire span of time. Life moves faster than you can imagine and as much as you think you’re ready for what it throws at you, it can catch you off guard. It definitely did for me.”\n\nAnd as well as a new tune to sink your teeth into, the long-running Tallahassee band are also set to return to the UK in February, in support of Simple Plan and alongside State Champs.\n\nCheck out the full list of dates below – and visit the band’s site for more information and to purchase tickets."
