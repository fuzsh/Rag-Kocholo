        "text": "Calvin Harris and Ellie Goulding are back with yet another song! This time, they have returned with a trance anthem, ‘Miracle’. The song marks their first venture into the trance genre.\n\n“I’m asking you to believe, to believe in a miracle” sings Goulding over Harris’ production of punchy ‘90s rave vibes, keys and some breakbeat music in the outro.\n\nCalvin Harris and Ellie Goulding previously also worked together for ‘I Need Your Love’ which became an instant hit in 2013, and ‘Outside’ in 2014. The former spent 25 weeks on the Billboard Hot 100 chart, and the latter spent 20 weeks on the same chart in the following year. Ellie Goulding became one of the most crucial voices of the EDM era, wherein she appeared on tracks by Harris, Major Lazer, Skrillex and Seven Lions among others.\n\nHarris is headlining Coachella next month which will follow the release of his LP ‘Funk Wav Bounces Vol. II’. The LP features collaborations with Halsey, Justin Timberlake, Snoop Dogg and other known names. It followed his Love Regenerator project! The project produced an EP and a few singles including ‘Live Without Your Love’ that features Steve Lacy.\n\n– Riya Sohini"
