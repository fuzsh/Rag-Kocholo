        "text": "2023 song by Calvin Harris and Ellie Goulding\n\n\"Miracle\" is a song by Scottish DJ and record producer Calvin Harris featuring English singer and songwriter Ellie Goulding. It was released as a single on 10 March 2023 through Columbia Records and Sony Music UK. It is a trance song inspired by Eurodance and techno that uses piano and synths in its production. It was included on his 2024 compilation album, 96 Months.\n\nThe song was nominated for the Grammy Award for Best Pop Dance Recording at the 66th Annual Grammy Awards, Harris' first nomination since 2018 and Goulding's first since 2016. It was also nominated for the Brit Award for Song Of The Year at the Brit Awards 2024 and won the Most Played Song Award at the Global Awards 2024.\n\nBackground\n\n[edit]\n\nBefore the release of \"Miracle\", Scottish DJ Calvin Harris and English pop singer Ellie Goulding had released two collaborations: \"I Need Your Love\" in 2012 and \"Outside\" in 2014.[1] Harris later texted Goulding, asking her to collaborate with him on \"Miracle\".[2] On 12 January 2023, Harris posted a picture of him and Goulding together in a recording studio.[3] Goulding first performed parts of the song a cappella inside St Bartholomew-the-Great which was uploaded on TikTok by both artists.[4]\n\nAccording to Harris, creating the song took him back to his early producing days in the late 1990s, having taken \"bits from that\" and putting it \"in a new context\". He chose Goulding as the vocalist, citing her \"angelic voice\" and calling her the only one capable of delivering the vocals on the song.[5]\n\nRelease\n\n[edit]\n\nMiracle was released alongside an animated lyric video.[6] A music video for \"Miracle\" was released on 24 March 2023, depicting Goulding in a crown and being circled by dancers and lasers.[7] Dutch DJ Hardwell's big room trance remix of \"Miracle\" was premiered during his headlining performance at Ultra Music Festival in March 2023 before it was officially released on 14 April 2023.[8][9] A house remix of \"Miracle\" by Mau P was released on 21 April 2023.[10]\n\nPerformances\n\n[edit]\n\nDuring his headlining performance at Coachella in April 2023, Harris brought out Goulding as a guest for their first live performance of \"Miracle\".[11][12] Harris also performed \"Miracle\" as the closer for his set during Primavera Sound in Barcelona in June 2023.[13]\n\nEllie Goulding performed \"Miracle\" at American Idol's Season 21 grand finale stage in May 2023.[14] Goulding included \"Miracle\" in the setlist for her UK and European Higher Than Heaven Tour dates.[15]\n\nComposition\n\n[edit]\n\n\"Miracle\" is an uptempo, 1990s- and early 2000s-inspired[5] trance song[16][17] with inspiration from techno[7] and a Eurodance-inspired beat[18] combined with \"ethereal\" piano,[19] \"glittering\", \"repetitive\" synths, heavy bass, a \"soft\" organ, and fast kick drums in its production.[5][20] Goulding sings with \"soft-tinged\" vocals on the song.[21] Rolling Stone, in their list of the one-hundred best songs of 2023, called the collaboaration \"another electropop smash\" and \"a psychelic EDM hit\".[22]\n\nCritical reception\n\n[edit]\n\nBillboard's Katie Bain and The Sunday Times both described the song as reminiscent of record producer Robert Miles' work.[17][23] Tom Breihan of Stereogum wrote that there was \"nothing particularly inventive\" about \"Miracle\", but that \"you might have a good time with [it]\" if \"you have any room in your heart for absolute cheeseball dance jams\".[24] Vogue's Liam Hess called the song \"fiendishly addictive\".[25] Of \"Miracle\", Tyler Golsen of Far Out wrote, \"Vibrant, maximalist, and just the right amount of cheesy, 'Miracle' is undeniably catchy, if not a bit rote,\" also writing that it was \"certainly not a revelation\".[26] For The Music, Emma Whines called the song's hook \"a true standout\".[20]\n\nYear-end lists\n\n[edit]\n\nSelect year-end rankings of \"Miracle\" Publication List Rank Ref.
