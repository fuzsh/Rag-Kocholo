        "text": "Ohly | Interview | New Album, ‘Miracle’\n\n‘Miracle’ is the latest album by indie-folk singer-songwriter based in Detroit, Michigan, Christian Ohly.\n\nHave you ever snuck into a park in the rain?\n\nWanted to know how the tragedy ends?\n\nDo fondly remember playing fighting with a past lover?\n\n‘Miracle’ is a 14-song album that takes us down a winding road of adoration, family, and heartbreak. From the wishing well that is ‘R&P,’ to the picturesque lyricism of ‘Knuckles,’ prepare to not just listen, but feel.\n\nChristian Ohly is an indie-folk singer-songwriter based in Detroit, Michigan. He utilized the lush orchestral pop instrumentation of Jon Bellion, the insightfulness of long-lost poets, and the earthiness of Hozier. But it’s difficult to describe his newest album, ‘Miracle,’ in one sentence. With the help of the producer John Katona, Christian Ohly has created a sound that is familiar, enchanting, and consistent- all without sticking to one genre.\n\nThe introduction track ‘The Bridge Over Lake Huron’ is a feel-good jam- but wait, not so soon. Halfway through the palm-muted Midwestern bop, we start to experience a time-warping modulation that takes us through a tunnel. It ends, just like that, dropping us into the longing “R&P” with its oceanic violins and heartbeat percussion.\n\n“When you cry I can hear it\n\nWhen you feel, you can show it\n\nIt’s ok not to know it\n\nWhen you don’t….”\n\nOhly creates loving songs with catchy, innocent melodies and empathetic lyrics. While ‘R&P’ feels like the intro to a movie, the next track ‘Knuckles’ feels more like a Taylor Swift ballad that meets the band A Rocket to the Moon.\n\n“You were workin’ in the Metropark and you got me in after dark\n\nAnd we laid in the grass and watched the lightning pass by\n\n…Oh Annie won’t you stay around a while?”\n\nYeah I could make do with only a smile.\n\nBut the angelic female backing vox and bell-like pianos fade out, into some corner bar in ‘Sing for You’. Ohly is a versatile artist, painting romantic scenes one moment, and writing a dark, relatable tune directly after.\n\nNext, he pays homage to his home state in ‘Wintertime’ which feels frigid with its ice-skating saxophone and pulsating synths. Before you know it, we’re rhythmically modulated and have transitioned into full-on jazz. Just as listeners start to get comfortable, ‘If We Ever’ the “almost” anthem for the hopeless romantic comes on. Detailing all the things we never did, but certainly daydreamed about…\n\n“You were hopin’ that if you wait around I might start to change\n\nMaybe I should cuz you’d be there whenever I call your name\n\nBut I know you got a few things you should work through I do too\n\nSo just take a step back and think about you”\n\nWe get a whole color palette of experiences in ‘Miracle’. There’s ‘Change’ a traveler’s song about the urge to settle down yet not wanting to change, and “Maybe It’s You” which is a peppy song about an inspirational muse.\n\nA distinct transition happens in Track 9. ‘Phone Call’ with a bed of ethereal violins and its distinctly higher melody. The tension and pain creeps into your bones when you listen. A short ‘Interlude’ brings us back to jazz, acting like a palate cleanser for the last quarter of the album. And ‘Oh, Melody’ will be the prettiest song you’ve probably ever heard about writer’s block.\n\nBy this time in the album, our ears are tricked into thinking Miracle would be all mellow…That’s exactly when we get a ‘Pistons’ which is a pop-punky Strokesque jam.\n\nThen, the penultimate ‘Black Mirror’ takes the orchestral folk sound from earlier and makes it even more heart wrenching. It details living together, not connecting, but wishing you could make it right…. The two layered melodies are delectably mournful and loving.\n\nAnd as for the icing on the cake- the gente, familial title track ‘Miracle’. We could tell you what it sounds like, but it’s probably best to experience the entire miracle yourself…\n\n‘Miracle’ is available for streaming now. To purchase on vinyl, please visit here!\n\nAnd now for It’s Psychedelic Baby! Magazine’s interview with Ohly!\n\n“Often what I write is inspired by what I’m listening to”\n\nWhat does “R&P” stand for?\n\nChristian Ohly: River & Piper.\n\nWhat is your favorite thing about making art in Detroit?\n\nThere’s a lot of different music communities in Detroit – sometimes by genre, other times by neighborhood. I really enjoy having the ability to hear different local live music every weekend if I want to.\n\nWho played the saxophone in ‘Wintertime,’ and what inspired you to add these sounds to your chilly, cozy tune?\n\nAdam Reese played saxophone. John (the producer) and I weren’t sure what the song needed, and we thought woodwind would be unique and interesting. We both love Rostam and Bon Iver’s use of Saxophone, so that may have triggered the idea as well.\n\nWhat jazz artist most inspires you?\n\nI honestly don’t have an answer for this one, but I hope to soon. The Ohly drummer and bassist are both jazz cats. We just did a record swap after the last rehearsal, and I plan to dig into more jazz music in the future.\n\nIt seems like ‘Miracle’ is based on many life events. Do the themes and feelings in your record take place throughout the entire course of your life, or was it a short era?\n\nYeah, you got it right. It primarily covers the last four years when I wrote the songs, but some songs definitely pull memories from other times in my life. High school, middle school, childhood, typing this out now, yeah it does cover my whole life.\n\nWhat is the key to making a cohesive multi-genre album like Miracle?\n\nWell – writing songs over the course of a few years will definitely help. Often what I write is inspired by what I’m listening to (this happens less and less the more I write and find my voice).\n\n‘Wintertime’ was written in a time when I was learning to play drums. ‘If We Ever’ and ‘Oh, Melody’ came when I was listening to alot of John Prine, James Taylor, and other 70’s folk songwriters. ‘Pistons’ when I was in a midwest emo phase.\n\nYou use a lot of orchestral strings in your album! Can you tell us more about these instrumentation choices?\n\nYeah, the instrumentation is one of my favorite parts! I grew up listening to the late 2000’s/2010’s indie rock, and heard of a lot of strings/unique instruments in that era of music. John always encourages using organic, analog instruments whenever possible. We used a few different pianos, vintage guitars, drum kits, synthesizers, organs/etc. For the strings, we had a friend compose the parts and direct the quartet. Being in the studio and hearing the string quartet live was one of the most memorable experiences of my life.\n\nLastly, what do you do when the ‘Oh, Melody’ doesn’t come?\n\nAt this point, I’ve taken a break from writing all together. I’m really excited for the songs I’ll write in the future, but at this point, I’m consumed by sharing the record with others, as it means a whole lot to me.\n\nI’d like to get to a place where great songs come from strong work ethic/persistence opposed to emotional experiences like this record, and I look forward to making that happen.\n\nHeadline photo: Alexis Backus"
