        "text": "Carnival Miracle is a ship you may not believe when you see... but definitely don't miss seeing it!\n\nWhen we say that Carnival Miracle takes you to another world, we mean that in every sense. Not only does this ship visit stunning destinations, but features incredible onboard spaces inspired by elements of fantasy. Escape from reality as you take in a show at the Phantom Lounge or a dance at Dr. Frankenstein's Lab. To lose yourself in a song, find your way to Sam's Piano Bar. Hungry? You'll find great food all over the place, from the casual fare of Horatio's to the artful eats of the Bacchus and Ariadne dining rooms... not to mention the world-class cuts at Nick & Nora's Steakhouse.\n\nAt Alchemy Bar® we make drinks into art, while the laid-back RedFrog Pub™ has \"Caribbean cool\" down to a science. And up in SkyBox™ Sports Bar, we've combined luxury-box comfort with the up-close view from the 50-yard line. Outdoors there's fun to be had, whether you're down for watersliding or up for simply sunning — Carnival WaterWorks™ has you covered (in water, that is), and the Serenity Adult-Only Retreat™ will get you relaxing in the sun or the shade, grown-up-style."
