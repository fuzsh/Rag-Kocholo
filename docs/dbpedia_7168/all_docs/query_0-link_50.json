        "text": "Julie Andrews: Shock truth behind iconic Sound Of Music scene\n\nDame Julie Andrews chatted with everyone’s favourite chat-show host Graham Norton on Saturday night. She spoke about her new book Home Work: A Memoir of My Hollywood Years as well as her time in the spotlight.\n\nAppearing alongside Julie will be Jennifer Aniston and Reese Witherspoon to speak about their new Apple TV comedy-drama series The Morning Show.\n\nSir Ian McKellen will also make an appearance, to talk about his new film, a drama thriller named The Good Liar, in which he plays a con man.\n\nJulie Andrews is perhaps best known for her iconic roles in Mary Poppins and The Sound of Music.\n\nOn Graham Norton, Julie discusses her new book and winning an Oscar for her first-ever film - Mary Poppins.\n\nRead More: Mary Poppins Returns: Julie Andrews 'considered for THIS role'\n\nJulie said: “l kept the Oscar in the attic for a very long time because I thought I’d been given it as a ‘Welcome to Hollywood’ and I didn’t feel worthy of it.\n\n“So much early success sent me into therapy and analysis.\n\n“I learnt you have to do it right and honour the films you are making. It’s a huge gift, but a lot of obligation.”\n\nIt was a therapy session which introduced Julie to her second husband, Blake Edwards.\n\nInvalid email\n\nWe use your sign-up to provide content in ways you've consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

(1981).\n\nBlake died in 2010 following a battle with pneumonia, and afterwards, Julie dubbed their relationship a “love story”.\n\nSpeaking on Good Morning Britain in 2015, Julie explained how she was still struggling to cope without her husband.\n\nShe said: “We were married 41 years and it was a love story, it was. Success in our marriage was to take it one day at a time and so, lo and behold, 41 years later there we still were.\n\n“I’m still dealing with [his death]. There are days when it’s perfectly wonderful and I am myself and then it’s suddenly—sock you in the middle of your gut and you think ‘ah God I wish he were here.’\n\n“But he is in a way, I think one carries that love always.”\n\nWhen asked by Graham if she'd ever had negative experiences in Hollywood, she spoke of her marriage to Blake.\n\nShe said: \"I was very lucky. I married Blake Edwards soon after arriving in Hollywood and it protected me from ever getting into that predicament.\"\n\nThe Graham Norton Show is on BBC One at 10.35pm tonight"
