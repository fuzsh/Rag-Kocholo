        "text": "Julie Andrews is the matriarch of a large blended family.\n\nThe Sound of Music star has three daughters: Emma Walton Hamilton, 61, Amy Edwards, 50, and Joanna Edwards, 48. She welcomed her eldest daughter with her first husband, costume designer Tony Walton, and adopted her two youngest daughters with her second husband, director Blake Edwards, whom she was married to up until his death in 2010. The Hollywood icon is also a stepmom to Edwards' two kids as well as a grandmother and great-grandmother to several children.\n\nIn March 2022, Andrews' first husband, whom she remained close with over the years, died at age 87. The Mary Poppins actress and her kids leaned on each other for support while mourning the loss. \"We are a huge, blended family and as we hold each other close, we take comfort knowing that he lives on, not only in his children and grandchildren, but in the memories of thousands who cherished his warmth and generosity and the glorious gifts he gave us,\" Andrews told PEOPLE of Walton.\n\nAndrews' children have inspired her in several ways, and in fact, they are what motivated her to become a children's book author. She published her first book Mandy, which was originally a story she wrote for her stepdaughter Jennifer, in 1971. She has gone on to build a children's book empire and has even written several books with her eldest daughter Emma.\n\nKeep reading to learn about Julie Andrews' children.\n\nEmma Walton Hamilton, 61\n\nEmma Kate Walton was born on Nov. 27, 1962, in London, England. Just a few months after Emma's birth, Andrews moved to Hollywood with then-husband Walton and her daughter to film Mary Poppins, as she detailed in her memoir Home Work.\n\nAndrews and her eldest daughter have always had a close relationship. \"We were bonded from the beginning because of, well, so many reasons,\" she told The Guardian. \"Emma's dad, my first husband, and I separated, and that helped us. I knew it was really important for me to make Emma's childhood as normal as possible, even though it was incredibly abnormal in many ways. But the same team traveled together, we were together as much as possible.\"\n\nAndrews and Emma have since become business partners, penning several children's books together and co-authoring some of Andrews' memoirs.\n\nIn 2017, the mother-daughter duo collaborated on Julie's Greenroom, a children's show on Netflix that they executive-produced and wrote together. \"It's pretty special from this mum's point of view,\" Andrews told PEOPLE of working with her daughter. \"This is a new learning curve for both of us really — writing for children in television and also the format — to know that you only got this much time and you have to get everything out of it. She's on the floor every day while I'm performing. She's holding it all together.\"\n\nAndrews and Emma launched a \"family-friendly storytime\" podcast together in 2020 called Julie's Library: Story Time with Julie Andrews. \"When I became a parent, I passed the love of reading on to my children,\" Andrews said in a statement at the time. \"My daughter and I have co-authored over 30 books for children and young adults, and our shared passion for the power of storytelling, literacy and the arts remains fervent.\"\n\nAs for her personal life, Emma married her husband Stephen Hamilton in 1991 and the two share children Hope Hamilton and Sam Hamilton. Hope has followed in her grandmother's footsteps as an actress.
