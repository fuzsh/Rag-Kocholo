        "text": "Legendary actress Dame Julie Andrews has revealed that she once had a meltdown on the set of Mary Poppins, so much so, she even expressed her frustration by using a number of expletives.\n\nThe 87 year old star, who is best known for her role as Mary Poppins in the 1964 film, is also famed for flying through the air with the help of her umbrella. And her songs, which include A Spoon Full Of Sugar became one of the most well known songs of all time throughout generations. But it seems that the stunts she undertook brought out another side of her character which viewers have never seen, which was in stark difference to the well-mannered, not to mention well spoken character in the film.\n\nSpeaking to US Closer magazine, Dame Julie revealed that some of the stunts were painful and dangerous. She said: \"I landed hard and was quite shaken. I have to admit, I let fly a stream of colourful expletives.\" However that did not deter Walt Disney from wanting to keep Dame Julie as the main star and even postponed filming until she had given birth.\n\nSpeaking of the time she had to explain her pregnancy to the film mogul, she continued: \"I said, ‘Oh, Mr. Disney, I’d love to come. But I’m pregnant.’ He spoiled me.\" But it wasn't just the star who recieved special treatment, so too did her then husband Tony Walton, who was hired as a designer on the iconic film. The couple had one child together, Emma Walton Hamilton.\n\nThe couple married in 1959 but split in 1968. A year later she then married Blake Edwards which came to an end in 2010. They had two children together, Amy Edwards and Joanna Edwards. But it wasn't just Mary Poppins that Dame Julie encountered difficulty, she also experienced cast issues while filming Sound Of Music.\n\nDuring the interview, she explained that she struggled to get on with her co-star Christopher Plummer which came at a time when she was having problems in her marriage with Tony. She said: \"I was quite lonely. Tony was working, and our marriage was a little rocky.\"\n\nEver the professional, Dame Julie claims that she does not regret a thing as she followed her mother's advice of keeping her down and not to complain. She added: \"Thankfully, I was willing to pay my dues and to learn. When we were touring, my mum would drill into me: ‘Don’t you dare complain about anything.. Get on with it and you’ll be respected so much more.\"\n\nDame Julie is said to be worth in excess of £25 millon and she currently resides in Walton-On -Thames, England. Outside of acting, Dame Julie is also a renowned author and penned a number of books including Home: A Memoir Of My Early Years and The Last Of The Really Great Whangdoodles."
