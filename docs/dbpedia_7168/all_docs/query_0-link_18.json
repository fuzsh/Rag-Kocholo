        "text": "Close to her heart. Julie Andrews reflected on her late husband Blake Edwards in a new interview with Good Morning Britain this week.\n\nThe Oscar-winning actress, 79, appeared on the show in recognition of the 50th anniversary of The Sound of Music, and took some time to speak about her marriage and her husband, who passed away in 2010 at the age of 88.\n\n“We were married 41 years and it was a love story, it was,” Andrews said of the time she spent with the filmmaker. After divorcing first husband Tony Walton in 1967, she married Edwards in 1969. “Success in our marriage was to take it one day at a time and so, lo and behold, 41 years later there we still were.”\n\n“We met about ten years before we — I mean, literally ships that passed in the night at some event — but we actually… our cars, I was going one way and he was going the other,” Andrews spilled of her meet-cute with her longtime love. “Blake rolled down the window after smiling a couple of times and said, ‘Are you going where I just came from?’ I was going to a therapist and he was coming from… very corny!”\n\nTheir “corny” meeting led to a long marriage, as Andrews was with Edwards until the day that he died. The director — whose films included The Pink Panther, Breakfast at Tiffany’s, and the Andrews-starring Victor Victoria, died in California after struggling with a bout of pneumonia, leaving behind the couple’s five children from their marriage and previous ones.\n\n“I’m still dealing with it,” the Princess Diaries star said of her husband’s death. “There are days when it’s perfectly wonderful and I am myself and then it’s suddenly — sock you in the middle of your gut and you think, ‘Ah God I wish he were here.'”\n\n“But he is in a way,” she added. “I think one carries that love always.”"
