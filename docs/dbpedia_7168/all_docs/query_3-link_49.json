        "text": "Credit: 20th Century Fox/Kobal/Shutterstock; Shutterstock\n\nJulie Andrews Through the Years: From 'Sound of Music' to 'Bridgerton'\n\nJulie Andrews has been stealing viewers’ hearts for decades.\n\nBorn ​​Julia Elizabeth Wells, the actress came from humble beginnings before scoring her big break on Broadway in September 1954, just before her 19th birthday. Andrews’ performance of Polly Browne in The Boy Friend caught the attention of both audience members and industry experts, kickstarting her wildly successful career.\n\nEventually, Andrews found her way to the big screen, scoring the lead roles in The Sound of Music and Mary Poppins.\n\nThe England native, a three-time Grammy winner, has experienced highs and lows in her personal life. The Netflix star welcomed daughter Emma in November 1962 with her first husband, set designer Tony Walton. The pair split in 1967 after less than 10 years of marriage.\n\nAndrews and her second husband, the late director Blake Edwards, wed in 1969 and adopted two daughters from Vietnam: Amelia in 1974 and Joanna in 1975.\n\nKeep scrolling for a look back at Andrews’ career highlights:\n\nCredit: Image Press Agency/NurPhoto/Shutterstock\n\n2022\n\nAndrews, who played a royal matriarch herself in The Princess Diaries, issued a heartfelt statement after the death of Queen Elizabeth II in September 2022. \"A page in history has turned today,\" she wrote. \"Along with millions of others, I mourn the passing of our beloved Queen Elizabeth II. \"It feels as though we lost a friend: a dedicated Monarch who inspired all of us with her love, wisdom and grace. May we honour her by holding to the standards she set for herself and her nation.\""
