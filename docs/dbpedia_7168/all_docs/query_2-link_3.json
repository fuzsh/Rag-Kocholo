        "text": "Ten years before they actually married in 1969, Julie Andrews and director Blake Edwards met like ships passing in the night, the actress revealed in a 2015 interview withGood Morning Britain.\n\nAndrews explained how they spoke briefly from their cars, outside of a therapist's office, during their first introduction, which she deemed \"corny\": \"I was going one way and he was going the other, he rolled down the window after smiling a couple of times and he said, 'Are you going where I just came from?'\"\n\nOn the set of 1982\\'s \\'Victor/Victoria\\\n\nBut Edwards, who directed Breakfast at Tiffany's and the Pink Panther films, had a more romantic outlook on their relationship's origins—he once described the way they'd met as \"wonderfully Hollywood.\"\n\n\"We would stop in the middle lane on Sunset [Boulevard, in Beverly Hills] waiting for traffic and then go on,\" he recalled. \"I kept looking over, two or three mornings a week...eventually I said 'hi.'\"\n\nBoth divorced their first spouses in 1967 and, although a somewhat unlikely pair—Oklahoma-born Edwards was 13 years her senior—began dating soon after. Their marriage created a blended family that included Andrews' daughter Emma and Edwards' children Jennifer and Geoffrey. They later adopted two girls, Amy and Joanna, from Vietnam, in 1974 and 1975, respectively. The pair collaborated professionally, too, making seven films together, including Victor/Victoria (1982), S.O.B. (1981), and 10 (1979).\n\nNot everything their professional union produced proved to be fruitful, though. Darling Lili (1970) turned out to be a flop, but Andrews looks back on it fondly, anyway. \"We had bonded so much that it didn't matter,\" she told the Hollywood Reporter.\n\nThe family took a break from Hollywood in the late '70s, retreating to their home in Switzerland—a hiatus Edwards later said \"restored\" their souls. The director, whom Andrews has called \"one of the bravest writers I know,\" exorcised his \"demons\" through writing, and in the process created some of Andrews' best roles. (Prior to S.O.B. and 10, Edwards worried that his wife had been \"pigeonholed\" by playing such famously cheerful characters as Mary Poppins and Maria Von Trapp.)\n\nSadly, Edwards passed away in 2010 following a bout with pneumonia. Andrews called their marriage a \"love story\" and, five years after his death, she told Good Morning Britain host Kate Garraway that she was still struggling with the loss.\n\n\"We were married 41 years and it was a love story, it was. Success in our marriage was to take it one day at a time and so, lo and behold, 41 years later there we still were,\" Andrews revealed in during the interview commemorating The Sound of Music's 50th anniversary.\n\n\"I'm still dealing with [his death],\" she said. There are days when it's perfectly wonderful and I am myself and then it's suddenly—sock you in the middle of your gut and you think 'ah God I wish he were here.'\"\n\n\"But he is in a way, I think one carries that love always,\" Andrews added."
