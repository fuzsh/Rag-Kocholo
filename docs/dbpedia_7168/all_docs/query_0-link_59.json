        "text": "Elizabeth Taylor and Richard Burton\n\nDuring the filming of the movie \"Cleopatra,\" co-stars Elizabeth Taylor and Richard Burton’s passion rivaled the legendary lovers they were portraying on screen. When the director called, “Cut!” the pair did not stop kissing. These were the early 1960s, and when the two married, it was the “marriage of the century.”\n\nBurton was the leading lady’s fifth husband. But after ten years, the couple called it quits. Burton was incredibly hurt and spammed her with love letters, begging her to return. She did. They married and divorced again. It lasted mere months, and they stayed friends for the rest of their lives.\n\nLauren Bacall and Humphrey Bogart\n\nNot only did Lauren Bacall and Humphrey Bogart bring to the movie industry some of the greatest films that were made in the last century, but they also contributed their own love affair in the home movie aptly titled \"Lauren Bacall and Humphrey Bogart,\" which had its own dramatic moments.\n\nHumphrey shone in \"Casablanca,\" and Bacall was known for her provocative roles. The two had a 20-year difference between them. However, they didn't let it come in the way of their true love. In 1957 the two were separated by Bogart's devastating death; however, their legendary romance lives until this day.\n\nSonny and Cher\n\nLegendary Cher met charming Sonny while he was spending his days working for Phil Spector, a well-known music producer. In the early days, it wasn't exactly a Cinderella story as Sonny initially didn't recognize her talent and offered her a housekeeping position. Cher couldn't refuse as her big dream was the music industry.\n\nWithin no time, they became the most recognized couple in the entertainment industry during the 1960s and 1970s. In the late 1970s, the two had a very public and ugly divorce with custody issues over their child. The two are best known for their heartwarming duet. \"I've Got You, Babe.\"\n\nElvis and Priscilla Presley\n\nThere is no need to introduce the King of Rock 'n Roll and his exquisite better half. The two got married in 1967, and just six years later, they were already divorced. Their short marriage didn't stop them from being one of the most famous couples in the entertainment industry.\n\nHe was everything every woman wanted, and she was a young and innocent girl who had to cope with a lot of heartaches and a lot of public shaming. Priscilla became a movie star in her own right, and Elvis remained the greatest of them all, even after he passed away.\n\nPattie Boyd and Eric Clapton\n\nOne of the most famous scandals in the music industry belongs to singer Eric Clapton and model Pattie Boyd. When the two first met in 1970, Pattie Boyd was already involved in a romantic affair with no other than George Harrison. Yes, Beatle Geroge Harrison (who was also Clapton's friend).\n\nOn 27 March 1979, Clapton and Boyd were married in Tucson, Arizona, and stuck together for almost a decade. The beautiful British model and photographer was the inspiration behind some of the greatest love songs Clapton wrote, such as \"Wonderful Tonight\" and \"Layla.\" Apparently, they both remained close friends with George Harrison.\n\nGeorge Harrison and Pattie Boyd\n\nIn the late 1960s, the iconic model Pattie Boyd was torn between her boyfriend, Geroge Harrison, and one of Harrison's best friends, Eric Clapton. Still, she first began dating George, and the couple got married in 1966, and by 1974 Boyd was already getting someone else down on his knees.\n\nBoyd was not the bad girl in this story, as Harrison reportedly had numerous overlapping relationships that Boyd found very difficult to accept. She suffered tremendously and found comfort in Clapton's arms. Despite the romantic triangle, Harrison and Boyd remained friends for many years until he sadly passed away in 2001.\n\nPaul Newman and Joanne Woodward\n\nHollywood stars Paul Newman and Joanne Woodward were together for more than fifty years. The two met in the late 1950s and stuck through thick and thin, despite them both being stars since the Golden Age of Hollywood. They met while shooting \"The Long Hot Summer\" and have been inseparable since.\n\nThese two proved to the world the power of everlasting love. Woodward has been nominated for three awards for her performance in \"Empire Falls\" in 2015, and Newman, who was an Academy Award-winning actor, acclaimed director and helped define the male lead in motion pictures up to the 21st century.\n\nSharon Tate and Roman Polanski\n\nSharon Tate landed her first big role in 1965 while shooting \"Eye of the Devil.\" That's where she met Roman Polanski, a French-Polish film director who would become one of the most profound and honorable film actors and directors of the 20th century. Polanski would later win an Oscar for Best Director for the film \"The Pianist\" in 2002.\n\nTheir relationship only lasted for one year; however, it would end in a tragic way when Sharon Tate lost her life unexpectedly, leaving the greater public, along with Polanski, shocked and devastated. What started off as a promising love story in Hollywood saw its end in such a horrific way.\n\nPaul McCartney and Linda Eastman\n\nAlthough Paul McCartney was a big thing, his wedding was everything but. In the glorious 1960s, McCartney married the love of his life, Linda Eastman, in a small and private venue. There is no need to introduce Mccartney, being the number two of the famous four. Linda was an American musician and photographer — a talented star of her own accord.\n\nLinda Eastman had a daughter, Heather, from a previous relationship, who McCartney adopted when the two married. McCartney and Eastman were married for 29 years and together, they had three more children. He said that they were almost never apart for more than one week, except for one week back in 1980.\n\nMarilyn Monroe and Arthur Miller\n\nMarilyn fell in love at first sight with Arthur Miller, who was already married then. She thought he was the most charming man alive, and he was captivated once he met her. He said he couldn't live without her and married Monroe just two days after divorcing his previous wife.\n\nAfter five years of marriage, Monroe and Miller had enough and divorced in 1961. At the time, it was thought that this marriage was going to last. However, it ended just five years after tieing the knot and becoming one of Monroe's most significant relationships (and she had a few).\n\nJane Fonda and Roger Vadim\n\nJane Fonda and Roger Vadim were married in 1965. She was a rising movie star, and he was one of the more vibrant filmmakers to emerge from the French cinema scene of the 1960s. He was known for having many lovers before and after marrying Fonda. Amongst those women were Catherine Deneuve and Brigitte Bardot.\n\nThey first became an item in 1963 and married two years later in 1965. At the time, there were rumors going around about their relationship being unhealthy at times. However, it remained one of the most iconic ones of that era. In 1973, seven years after tieing the knot, the two went their separate ways.\n\nMick Jagger and Marianne Faithfull\n\nMarianne Faithfull came from a family of intelligent professors and European noblemen. She was considered upper class and was expected to mix with her kind. Noted for her distinctive voice, the beautiful singer and songwriter met Andrew Loog, who was The Rolling Stones' manager, and the route to Jagger was paved.\n\nJagger and Faithfull were together for a little over three years, and it is thought that she was involved not only with Mick but with a few other Stones. Her popularity was further enhanced by her film roles, but eventually, their very public relationship reached an inevitable breaking point, and they broke up.\n\nJerry Hall and Mick Jagger\n\nAlthough Mick Jagger and Jerry Hall only married in 1991, the two were a thing way back in the late 1970s. They met each other when each was involved with somebody else. However, that never stopped them from having a fling. The stunning model and A-class rock star dated for more than ten years before deciding to tie the knot.\n\nUnsurprisingly, Jagger couldn't remain faithful to his wife, and almost two decades after the two united, Hall filed for divorce. The couple have four children together. Jagger and Hall were (and forever be) one of the industry's most iconic and talked about couples who embody what the 1970s were all about.\n\nDiana Ross and Gene Simmons\n\nNot all celeb couples were in the limelight during the 1970s. Some preferred to stay low-key and concentrate on what was going on in their private lives and not outside of their home. Diana Ross and Gene Simmons were one of them. They kept a low profile while they dated.\n\nThey met while Simmons was still dating Cher. He ended up dating Ross until 1984. She was a rising singer and movie star, and he was a musician that reportedly said that Ross kept him on his feet. He loved her confidence, and he adored her self-esteem. However, two years into their relationship, they broke up.\n\nJessica Lange and Mikhail Baryshnikov\n\nOne of the most stylish and elegant couples in the 1970s was undoubtedly the respected American actress Jessica Lange and Mikhail Baryshnikov, the phenomenal Russian dancer. They accompanied one another for six years, from 1976 until 1982; however, their relationship never really ended. They remained good friends until this day.\n\nBack in her heyday, Lange was a successful actress and was frequently entrusted with portrayals of iconic American women, and her performances gained her several awards, including her Oscar-winning role of Carly in \"Blue Sky.\" Baryshnikov was an outstanding classical ballet dancer of the 1970s who later on became a dance director.\n\nJane Birkin and Serge Gainsbourg\n\nJane Birkin was a British and French actress who landed several movie roles in the 60s when her looks seemed to symbolize the swinging spirit of the times. She then rose to prominence thanks to her decade-long relationship with Serge Gainsbourg, one of the world's most popular and important French singers and songwriters.\n\nShe went on to have a highly successful acting career in both British and French cinemas and was often coached by Gainsbourg. Birkin was an icon in the 1960s, and her name will forever be associated with his. When they first met, he was almost double her age, but this never stopped the toe from being together for almost 12 years and having a daughter together.\n\nBrigitte Bardot and Gunter Sachs\n\nBrigitte Anne-Marie Bardot is one of the most famous symbols of the 1950s. Truly a fashion icon, Bardot’s hairstyle, makeup, and fashion sense continue to inspire a lot of women across the globe. She earned international acting recognition in 1957 for her provocative role in the controversial drama, \"And God Created Woman.\"\n\nGunter was Bardot's third husband, and their marriage lasted slightly over three years. He was very wealthy, he liked the good life, and he suited Bardot perfectly for a little while. She reportedly said that throughout their life together, they saw each other no more than three months altogether, so naturally, he didn't suit her anymore.\n\nJean Shrimpton and David Bailey\n\nJean Shrimpton was an English actress and model and is considered to be one of the first models to be titled a supermodel. In the 1960s, she was everywhere, so no wonder David Bailey fell for her. He was a successful fashion photographer and took a significant role in shaping the sixties.\n\nThey first met when they worked together, and soon they fell in love and became one of the most talked about couples of that era. A few years after the two became an item, Shrimpton was tired of Baily being unfaithful and subsequently saw their four-year relationship that ended in 1964.\n\nJohnny Cash and June Carter\n\nJune Carter Cash may be Jonny Cash’s second wife, but there's so much to her. Before her famous marriage, she was June Carter of the popular Carter Family Trio until the group disbanded. June saw some success as a solo artist in the ‘60s. But her most notable performances were with Johnny Cash, whom she eventually married.\n\nTheir love story was an iconic country music affair. They had a tale that outperformed time and was coated with all the bad and good fame brings with it. They were both portrayed in \"Walk the Line,\" a 2005 biographical film that largely focused on the development of their relationship over the course of 13 years.\n\nJohn Lennon and Yoko Ono\n\nJohn Lennon and Yoko Ono are one of the most iconic and artistic couples who ever lived. The pair lasted for more than a decade until the unfortunate tragic death of John Lennon. Yoko was a Japanese avant-garde artist, and they accidentally met in an art gallery that exhibited her work in mid-60s in London.\n\nEver since their meeting, the pair became inseparable and even had their two-week bed protests for peace. They were purveyors of love, and they both had a huge influence on the hippie movement. Their combined fame for sure made them one of the most powerful couples of that day of age.\n\nAllen Ludden and Betty White\n\nBetty White and Allen Ludden were a match made in heaven. Ludden was a huge TV star at the time, and White appeared on several shows and became one of the leading entertainment figures of the 1960s. Ludden was White's greatest love, and she reportedly said in one interview that when she first met him, she felt as if she had known him for years.\n\nAllen and Betty were tied together for almost two decades, at the end of which they separated — not because they fell out of love but because Allen lost a battle to a severe medical condition, which saw him take his last breath just a week before their 18th wedding anniversary.\n\nIke and Tina Turner\n\nBefore being known as a romantic couple, Ike & Tina Turner were a famous musical duo who performed together from 1960 until 1976. They were the lead on everything surrounding R&B at the time and set the tone for that kind of groove. So what’s love got to do with it? Well, a lot, if you ask us.\n\nJust as they were huge with their music, so was their love; the only difference is their music lives on even today. As their personal life became patchy, Turner filed for divorce. She claimed they separated for irreconcilable differences, but it is no secret that Ike mistreated her in a physical, emotional, and financial way. In May 2023, Tina sadly passed away, leaving behind her a neverending dancer.\n\nJohn and Jackie Kennedy\n\nYou cannot talk about notable 1960s romances without including Jackie and former President John Kennedy. They were married for ten years before John lost his life, so tragically and too soon. Although their love life seemed pure and admirable from the outside, it turned out that not everything was peachy.\n\nIt was rumored that Kenndy was also romantically involved with Marilyn Monroe, and it is thought that Jackie knew all about it but decided to accept her husband's ways and lifestyle. On the contrary, there was hearsay that just before John lost his life, Jackie was planning on filing for divorce. Was she? We will never know.\n\nFrank Sinatra and Mia Farrow\n\nIn 1966, Frank Sinatra married his third wife, actress Mia Farrow, when he was 50 and she was 21. Farrow and Sinatra’s marriage seemed to succeed at first – but problems soon started to crop up. Farrow had agreed to stop working at Sinatra’s request but soon decided she wanted to return to acting, which annoyed Frank.\n\nTheir arguments and controversies became public, and soon enough, everyone knew of their problems. When she canceled her appearance in Sinatra’s film \"The Detective\" in favor of appearing in \"Rosemary’s Baby,\" Sinatra served Farrow with divorce papers while she was on the set. It happened just two years after tying the knot.\n\nAva Gardner and Frank Sinatra\n\nSinger Frank Sinatra divorced his first wife, Nancy Barbato, for actress Ava Gardner, and the two married soon after the proceedings were finalized. While Sinatra was associated with many other women over the years, one of his greatest loves was, without a doubt, the straightforward and sassy broad Ava Gardner.\n\nTheir legendary love story began with a bang, and their marriage was tumultuous, often making headlines. Their union only lasted for six years, from 1951 to 1957. And even after Sinatra and Gardner divorced, which Gardner filed for, the actress referred to Sinatra, third husband, as the love of her life.\n\nJanet Leigh and Tony Curtis\n\nJanet Leigh made her debut in a horror film. Leigh was a huge Hollywood star back in the 50s, 60s, and 70s, and one of her most memorable moments was that of the female shower victim in Hitchcock’s famous horror classic, \"Psycho.\" The 1960s film earned Leigh a Golden Globe Award and an Oscar nomination for her infamous screaming shower scene.\n\nWhen Janet Leigh met Tony Curtis, she was only 24 years old and was already divorced twice. However, they were a temporary match made in heaven. The big movie star and the rising Hollywood icon were married for over a decade and had two daughters together, one of them being actress Jamie Lee Curtis.\n\nVivien Leigh and Laurence Olivier\n\nLaurence Olivier and \"Gone with the Wind\" star Vivien Leigh were glamourous showbiz stars, being both nominated (and won) several awards. After securing their divorces from their respective spouses, Leigh and Olivier married in 1940. They had an emotional and sad relationship that wasn't understood or accepted in those days, and their 20-year marriage ended with a storm.\n\nVivien Leigh suffered from mental instability and had a few breakdowns that went public. Heartbroken, Olivier wasted no time, and in 1960, their troubled marriage ended in divorce. Soon after that, he began dating another actress; however, he and Leigh continued writing love letters to each other until their very last days.\n\nAudrey Hepburn and Mel Ferrer\n\nAudrey Hepburn and Mel married in the late 1950s. Mel Ferrer would go on and star in all-time classics, such as \"War and Peace,\" \"Macro Polo,\" \"The Longest Day,\" and more. He was a rising star in those days, and his light shone independently. She was one of the most successful and desirable actresses in the industry.\n\nFerrer loved the fact that Audrey was a fiercely independent and strong woman. However, despite their strong passion and fondness for one another, their relationship still did have its challenges. Fourteen years after tieing the knot, they both had enough of each other's crooked ways, and they decided to move on.\n\nKatharine Hepburn and Spencer Tracy\n\nKatharine Hepburn and Spencer Tracy were a legendary couple, on the screen and off. They starred in nine films together and kept each other company for more than 25 years. Spencer was a practicing Catholic; therefore, he couldn't divorce Louise, his first wife, and never got to fulfill his true love for Hepburn.\n\nHepburn was known to be fiercely private, but still, their love story was a spoken-about secret that tragically ended when Spencer passed away. Katherine Hepburn never had children, and all of her love and affection throughout her entire life was dedicated to Spencer. A kind of love you don't see these days.\n\nAnne Bancroft and Mel Brooks\n\nWhen Mel Brooks was asked how he met Anne Bancroft, he replied by saying that they were introduced; they started to talk and never stopped. Mel was smitten with Ann— so much so that it also unleashed a creative fire within. They were a match made in heaven and a key couple in the industry.\n\nThe two actors were married for more than 40 years and worked together on screen three times. The couple had a son together, Max, who was born in 1972. Bancroft sadly died in 2005, but they will forever be remembered as one of Hollywood's most loving, caring, and funny couples.\n\nLucille Ball and Desi Arnaz\n\nLucille Ball was not the type of woman to fawn over men. In the case of Arnaz, he was the exact opposite of who she usually dated. She usually went after older men, but Arnaz was much younger than her. At the time they met, he was 23, and she was 28, but soon enough became inseparable. They decided to get married only six months after they started dating.\n\nTheir marriage was anything but easy. Ball was making a name for herself in Hollywood and seemed to be investing more time in her career than in her relationship, which upset Arnaz. After two decades of being together and claims on her side of Arnaz mentally harming her, they divorced.\n\nGloria Hatrick McLean and Jimmy Stewart\n\nGloria Hatrick McLean was a beautiful actress and model in the past century. Jimmy Stewart, best known for starring in the legendary movie \"It's a Wonderful Life,\" was an American pilot and charming actor. They married less than a year after they met. He was swept off his feet and dazzled by her beauty.\n\nAnd she was captivated by his charms, so as luck would have it, they stuck together for almost 50 years. It was quite a shock back then that one of Hollywood's most famous leading men fell for a divorced actress who already had two children, and together they held a healthy and flourishing marriage.\n\nBob Dylan and Joan Baez\n\nBefore anything, Bob Dylan and Joan Baez were professional singer and colleagues; however, over time, their relationship had nothing to do with their skills and everything to do with their passion. They were an item for a while, and it was openly known that Dylan regretted how things ended between them.\n\nBaez was crazy about Dylan, and he thought she was one of the most talented musicians around. They completed each other. At one point, Dylan's career escalated and kind of left Baez behind. He invited her to join him on tour. However, he never asked her to come on stage. They ended their love affair during that tour.\n\nRuby Dee and Ossie Davis\n\nRuby Dee and Ossie Davis are one of the most adored couples, both on and off-screen. Not only as individuals but also as a couple, Dee and Davis have brought to life fantastic pieces of art that have influenced generations. Not only that, they had a great love between them.\n\nDavis once said that the way to love a woman is to love ONE woman, which explains how the coupled turned into being so noticeable and so profound in the industry. They were known for being ardent civil rights activists and for being one of Hollywood's greatest black love stories.\n\nYves Saint Laurent and Pierre Berge\n\nMore than 50 years ago, Yves Saint Laurent was as big and remarkable as he is today, if not bigger. Pierre Bergé first laid eyes on the young designer at a fashion show, and from there, the spell was cast, and their turbulent love affair began. Together, they co-founded the fashion label, Yves Saint Laurent.\n\nPierre Berge turned Yves Saint Laurent into what we know today, and they became longtime business partners. He founded the YSL fashion label and was romanticly involved with Yves for almost 15 years. YSL has left an unerasable mark not only in the fashion industry but also in the late Berge's heart.\n\nRod Stewart and Bebe Buell\n\nIn the late 1970s, British rock star Rod Stewart and beautiful American singer and model Bebe Buell were going strongly together. Her love life was so complicated that Buell said that Stewert was a rebound of hers. She was dumped by her previous lover and found herself vulnerable and alone.\n\nStewert was like a \"knight in shiny armor,\" as Bebe described. Altogether they were an item for a little over a year, then each going to find another music star to be comforted by. Later on, Buell would say Stewart helped her realize what she didn't want in a boyfriend.\n\nJon Voight and Marcheline Bertrand\n\nIn December of 1971, Jon Voight and Marcheline Bertrand were married. He was a rising Hollywood star, and she was an actress climbing the ladder of success. They would soon become the parents to two children, with their daughter later becoming one of the biggest names in the industry — Angelina Jolie.\n\nAt the beginning of their relationship, the two were one of the most popular couples in the industry. Years later, however, Voight would turn out to be a typical Hollywood star and spend his time with more than one woman. Bertrand filed for divorce in 1978, and their divorce was finalized in 1980.\n\nJuanita Hardy and Sidney Poitier\n\nJuanita Hardy and Sidney Poitier were married for fifteen years. Hardy was a big name back in the day. She was a beautiful dancer and model, and her entrepreneurial accomplishments in the real estate industry proved she was not just a pretty face. Her husband, Sidney Poitier, was the first-ever black actor to win an Oscar.\n\nThe two married when Poitier was at the peak of his career, and they became one of the biggest couples in the industry. They lived a glamorous life; however, as is all too common in Hollywood, Hardy filed for divorce after finding out Poitier had been unfaithful to her for 11 years.\n\nLinda Christian and Tyrone Power\n\nTyrone Power was one of Hollywood's most eligible bachelors and became one of the industry's most desired men after starring in \"Tarzan and the Mermaids.\" Soon after the movie came out, he married Linda Christian, who was a stunning Mexican actress, also known for being the first Bond Girl.\n\nA few years into their marriage, Christian and Power argued continuously. This led to Christian going through a nervous breakdown, leaving Power, and eventually filing for divorce. On several occasions, Christian and Power were offered the opportunity to work together, but for various reasons, each offer was either refused or rescinded.\n\nFarrah Fawcett and Lee Majors\n\nIn the late 1960s, legendary Farrah Fawcett began dating rising star Lee Majors. She was set on a blind date with Majors, eventually leading the two to exchange their vows and tie the knot. These were the days when Fawcett was a huge name on the screen, being the number-one star of \"Charlie's Angels.\"\n\nFawcett and Majors were living every teen's dream and were the hottest item around at the time. They were idolized. Eventually, their career won over their passion, and the paparazzi and fame that came with the role were too much for Farrah to handle. They divorced 12 years after they wed.\n\nJack Nicholson and Michelle Phillips\n\nMichelle Philips was one-quarter of the almost mythical music band \"The Mamas and the Papas.\" During the peak of her career, she dated Dennis Hooper, and they actually were married for eight days. One of Hooper's best friends at the time was Jack Nicholson. In the early 1970s, she dated Nicholson too.\n\nThey were on and off for a while, and it was reported that at one stage, Michelle fell pregnant with his child. The pregnancy ended tragically, Nichlson moved on to seeing other women, and the story between the two ended before it escalated too much. They were a big item for a very short time.\n\nJack Nicholson and Anjelica Huston\n\nAngelica Huston was one of the biggest names in the industry during the 1970s. Nicholson was famously in a 17-year-long relationship with the charismatic Huston, who was (and still is) a huge film star in her own right. Over the course of his acting career, Nicholson delivered dozens of performances that are still considered as being some of the best acting ever done.\n\nThe starlet stuck by Nicholson even through multiple affairs. Sadly, she hoped they would start a family together, but one of his affairs resulted in a child. The actress called it quits after that. For many years Nicholson reflected on it, saying that he was young and stupid and made a mistake.\n\nRaquel Welch and Joe Namath\n\nIn the ravishing 1970s, Joe Namath was a big name in football (American football, that is). Raquel Welch made her breakthrough while starring in \"Fantastic Voyage\" in 1966, and although the two dated for just a little while, they made so much noise it seemed as if they were the power couple of the era.\n\nWhile their relationship was brief, Namath still managed to accompany Welch to the 1972 Acadamy Awards; however, it obviously wasn't meant to be, and they each went their separate ways. Raquel found another Hollywood shoulder to lean on until she married Richie Palmer, co-owner of Mulberry Street Pizzeria. Joe went on to marry Deborah Mays.\n\nWarren Beatty and Julie Christie\n\nIf there was one beautiful couple in Hollywood in the 1970s, it must be Warren Beatty and Julie Christie. Beatty was known to have an affair with almost every co-star of his; however, the fling with Christie was one of his greatest ones. Beatty was so in love with Christie that he would refer to her as his wife even though they never married.\n\nDespite Beatty's unfaithful ways and despite all the warnings she got from the people closest to her, Christie was so hooked on him she couldn't let go. Eventually, enough was enough, and Christie told Beatty it was either her or the other women, and he went with the many other women.\n\nDiane von Furstenberg and Prince Egon von Furstenberg\n\nThe history between these two people is fascinating. They come from completely different backgrounds, however, managed to cross all barriers and become one of the most talked-about couples of the 1970s. Diane came from a standard middle-class family, and Egon was the son of a prince. When the two got married, Diane was already pregnant.\n\nNone of this bode well with his family, and they were not supportive of the wedding; however, when love strikes, it strikes hard (and usually wins). Diane grew to be a successful fashion designer, and despite the two divorcing in the early 1980s, she never dropped Egon's name and remained von Furstenberg until this very day.\n\nTwiggy and Justin de Villeneuve\n\nFrom 1966 until 1973, Justin de Villeneuve (who was born Nigel Jonathan Davies) was Twiggy's manager. For a certain period of time, he was a bit more than that. And she was more than a name in the British fashion industry; she was a cultural icon, and he brought her to greatness.\n\nIn 1973, the business part of their relationship became more significant than the passion they shared. When they found themselves caught in contractual problems, Twiggy decided enough was enough, and she left Villeneuve, the manager, and Villeneuve, the boyfriend. She eventually married American actor Michael Witney, and they had a daughter together.\n\nSally Field and Burt Reynolds\n\nIf we had to put a face to 1970s masculinity, it would be Burt Reynolds. With countless women chasing that iconic mustache, the man sure did break a lot of hearts, but lo and behold, he got his heart broken too! The late actor told \"Vanity Fair\" that his biggest regret was losing the love of his life, Sally Field.\n\nThe two were together for a little over five years in a complicated relationship. Reynolds admitted that, in retrospect, it was stupid to let her go like that, saying that you can find the perfect person and then still do everything possible to mess it up. The actor missed her terribly until the very end.\n\nDiane Keaton and Warren Beatty\n\nThough Beatty's romantic adventures as the womanizer were well-known, this didn't stop him from being in a relationship with Keaton. Their relationship began before the two starred beside each other in the movie \"Reds.\" In fact, Beatty cast Keaton to star with him two years after their relationship began, as Keaton had just ended her romance with Al Pacino.\n\nKeaton said in one interview that she found Beatty mysterious, captivating, and extremely talented and that, for a while, he was the man of her dreams. Beatty proposed to Keaton, but she was focusing on her career, and as a multi-faceted actress, she didn't want to lose what she had. Keaton never married.\n\nKatharine Ross and Sam Elliott\n\nThe two Hollywood stars are living the dream in every single way. They first met in the 60s, then they got married in 1984 and are still together to this day. They began dating in the late 1970s while the movie \"The Legacy,\" which starred the two, was being filmed.\n\nRoss and Elliot went on to work on many projects together, \"Conagher\" being their most successful one. This beautiful couple has managed to preserve and maintain their marriage (which is not something we can say about many couples in Hollywood) and despite their jobs in a very demanding industry, they've managed to stay together.\n\nSylvester Stallone and Sasha Czack\n\nMore than five decades ago, Sasha Czack was known only as Sylvester Stallone's partner. While she was a passionate photographer and actress, it was only years later that she became a star in her own right. She met him before he became Rocky. In fact, it was two full years before he got his breakthrough.\n\nStallone and Czack married in 1974, and sadly, the former couple went their separate ways after ten years together when they got a divorce in 1985. They had two sons together, and each continued to make great things in the industry. Stallone went on to marry model and actress Brigitte Nielsen that same year.\n\nAudrey Hepburn and Andrea Dotti\n\nAfter divorcing Mel Ferrer in 1968, Audrey Hepburn fell in love with Italian psychiatrist Andrea Dotti. It relieved her that Dotti wasn't involved in the entertainment industry, and their relationship lasted for several years. With Dotti, she could stay balanced and keep her private life private. They got married in 1969 and lived together in Rome throughout the '70s.\n\nThey met while they were both cruising on the Mediterranean, and both were still married to former partners. Sadly, Audrey married the wrong man (not for the first time) — as Dotti was being unfaithful. When she felt her children were old enough to handle a divorce, Hepburn left him.\n\nHarrison Ford and Mary Marquardt\n\nMary Marquardt is known as the one who stayed beside Ford through thick and thin, during bad times and worse times, until the very end of their relationship in 1979. They met in college and became a hot item, even before Ford became a big Star and saw his successful stint in \"Indiana Jones\" and \"Star Wars.\"\n\nIt is thought that Ford found it difficult to keep his pants on while filming \"Star Wars,\" and Carrie Fisher kept him company while they were filming \"Star Wars\" together. Fisher never denied the affair, and Marquardt's route to courts for filing for divorce was immediate, and their 15 years of marriage ended.\n\nGoldie Hawn and Bill Hudson\n\nYou might find this hard to believe, but Goldie Hawn had a life before Kurt Russell. In 1975 Goldie and Bill Hudson became an item when they began dating. By 1976 they were already married. Hudson was a singer at the time, and Goldie was marking her footsteps in the movie industry.\n\nThe rumors say that Goldie was all in for an open relationship with Hudson, but he was having none of it. In 1982, after four years of marriage, they went through an ugly divorce which Hudson reportedly initiated. Husdon lost contact with their children, and Goldie moved on to Russell.\n\nAnn-Margret and Roger Smith\n\nWhat is the secret behind the amazing love story Ann-Margaret and Roger Smith share? The Swedish actress first laid eyes on Smith in the early 1960s, and they have been inseparable ever since. Margaret played alongside King Elvis and legendary Dick Van Dyke; however, her heart has forever belonged only to one.\n\nWhen they first dated, Smith was technically still married, but nothing could come between the couple, who have been playing it strong despite them both being part of the harshest, most selfish, and notoriously dishonest industry in the world. On May 8, 1967, they were married at the Riviera Hotel.\n\nDustin Hoffman and Anne Byrne\n\nAnne Byrne was Dustin Hoffman's first wife. Hoffman emerged as a key figure in Hollywood when he rose to fame in the 1960s and 1970s, and at the time, Byrne was a successful working actress too who starred alongside Diane Keaton and Myrel Streep in the 1979 production of \"Manhattan.\"\n\nBefore the couple went their separate ways in 1980, Hoffman adopted Byrne's daughter from a previous marriage and had one of his own too. After the divorce, they both continued to take part in the industry, Hoffman becoming one of the most appreciated and desirable actors in the late 20th century.\n\nMick and Bianca Jagger\n\nThe Rolling Stones singer and his first wife were one of the most popular couples of the time. After a seven-year marriage and one daughter, they divorced in 1978. Bianca Jagger was a Nicaraguan actress and carried a kind of flair with her, and this unique trait was quite magnetic to many rockstars.\n\nBianca filed for divorce after Mick brought Jerry Hall into their relationship, and the divorce came through more than a year after Mick became involved with Hall. Bianca Jagger has since lived her days working on charity campaigns as social and human rights advocate while being involved in other worthy endeavors.\n\nJacqueline Kennedy and Aristotle Onassis\n\nAmerica had to adjust to the former First Lady's new last name after she married shipping tycoon Aristotle Onassis in 1968. They were one of the most high-profile couples of the decade, whether they were in walking the streets of NYC or on Aristotle's yacht. Jackie Kennedy experienced much tragedy in her life, particularly after losing her husband in such a tragic way.\n\nFive years after the tragic death of her husband, she married long-time friend and Greek shipping magnate Aristotle Onassis. She believed that Aristotle's wealth could provide her family with the safety she longed for. The two had a twenty-three-year age difference, and they remained married until Aristotle’s death in 1975.\n\nNatalie Wood and Robert Wagner\n\nNatalie Wood started her acting career when she was just five years old. She first met Robert Wagner when she was ten and he was 18. Wood said that she looked at her mother and said that one day she would marry him. She was right, not once, but twice.\n\nThey first tied the knot in 1957. However, five years later, in 1962, they divorced. When they remarried in 1972, they were everything anyone could talk about. Their second time around lasted until 1981, when Wood passed away. Wagner has been married to his third wife, actress Jill St. John, 81, since 1990.\n\nChad Everett and Shelby Grant\n\nIf there is one couple on this list who we admire, it is Chad Everett and Shelby Grant. They were married for over 45 years, which is more than many Hollywood couples put together. They were one of a kind (or two of a kind) and proved that you could have a successful career and a successful marriage at the same time.\n\nEverett admits that it was love at first sight, and the minute he saw her, he was captivated. Grant said that after meeting him for the first time, she had a strange feeling that she had met him before. Chad flourished in his career, while Shelby packed it all in to bring up her family.\n\nMichael and Shakira Caine\n\nLife starts and ends with instant coffee commercials. Well, at least it did for Michael and Shakira Caine. Michael first saw Shakira in a TV commercial (for coffee), and he knew she was about to become the love of his life. Soon enough, they went on a date, and they have been together ever since.\n\nFive decades to be precise. Michael has one of the most stable careers in Hollywood. He has been nominated for several awards on many occasions, and just like his marriage, he accomplishes everything to perfection. Shakira, the beautiful Indian former model, and former Miss Guyana, packed up acting in 1975.\n\nJulie Andrews and Blake Edwards\n\nJulie first met her second husband, Blake Edwards, in 1959, and they were together until Edwards's death in 2010. As it happens, Andrews, the queen of musicals, was just arriving at her therapist's clinic when Edwards was leaving the place where they first met, both in their cars. A true Hollywood love story.\n\nThey married ten years after they first set eyes on one another and were considered a power couple of their time. The director of \"Breakfast at Tiffany's\" and Ms. Poppins have five kids between them: one from Andrews's previous marriage, two from Edwards's previous marriage, and two that they adopted together.\n\nJohn Derek and Linda Evans\n\nWay before John Derek married Bo, he was married to Linda Evans. In fact, Bo was one of the reasons the two divorced. The director (a former actor) and the lovely TV star had a publicized marriage; however, they had an even more publicized separation that led to working on \"Dynasty.\"\n\nThey first dated in 1965, they were married by 1968, and on Christmas day 1973, it was all over. John came out clean about his affair with Bo, and a new, or used, Hollywood couple was born. John married Bo in 1976, and they remained together until his death in 1998 at age 71.\n\nBarbra Streisand and Elliott Gould\n\nWhen \"I Can Get It for You Wholesale\" was being worked on, Elliot Gould had the lead role, and Barbara Streisand auditioned for a part. They tried to hide their secret relationship; however, within no time, the rest of the company knew what was going on. Streisand's career was escalating, but things were not sailing so smoothly for Gould.\n\nHe was envious of her, and it took him a few good years before his breakthrough. Streisand's fame was too much for Gould to handle, and by 1971, the potential power couple broke up. Gould said, \"It was difficult to be married to someone who was married to their success.\"\n\nBernadette Peters and Steve Martin\n\nA few years before \"The Jerk\" was filmed (1979), the two stars of the movie, Bernadette Peters and Steve Martin, were an item. They were one of Hollywood's most noticeable couples, and they stuck by each other's side for almost four years. At one stage in their relationship, the two were about to move in together.\n\nPeters was getting her personal belongings ready for the move. However, something happened, and it never fell through. The ex-couple never spoke about it, but Peters did mention in one interview that she was eager to get married to Martin, but he was eager to bring up his many cats.\n\nCarly Simon and James Taylor\n\nCarly Simon and James Taylor were a match made in Hollywood. Simon and Taylor were two of the most recognized voices of the 1970s. They were constantly first on the charts, each with their own solo tunes and with duets they recorded together. Their music lingered on for years, which is the last thing we can say about their love story.\n\nThey tied the knot in 1972, and a decade later, in 1983, the two were already divorced. The pair have cited a number of reasons that led to the end of their marriage, with their parallel careers being a large contributing factor. When did \"You're So Vain\" come out? In 1972. Is it about Taylor? No. It's reportedly about Warren Beatty.\n\nSteve McQueen and Ali MacGraw\n\nSteve McQueen was a Hollywood star best known for his role in \"The Great Escape\" (1963). The Legendary Ali MacGraw got her breakthrough in 1969 when she starred in the movie \"Goodbye, Columbus.\" In 1970 when the movie \"Love Story\" came out, she became internationally famous. Not long after \"Love Story\" came out, the two got together.\n\nAli was married to her first husband at the time. She left him and held a relationship with Steve for five tumultuous years. It was believed Ali McGraw remained the apple of Steve McQueen's eye even years after their relationship's conclusion, with her remaining his true love until his untimely death.\n\nStevie Nicks and Lindsay Buckingham\n\nThe two legendary members of Fleetwood Mac began dating each other before joining the band. In fact, one of Buckingham's conditions for joining was that Nicks be welcomed too; however, not all was a garden of roses when it comes to their love story. Buckingham wanted to end their relationship, wanting to be a free bird once again.\n\nOne of Stevie Nicks's best songs is, without a doubt, \"Landslide.\" The song is about her rollercoaster relationship with Lindsey Buckingham while they struggled through difficult times. It was while writing and recording the album “Rumours” that Buckingham and Nicks ended their love affair; overall, the pair were together for six years.\n\nClint Eastwood and Sondra Locke\n\nClint Eastwood has had a slew of partners throughout his life, but none more iconic than his years with Sondra Locke. They started dating after meeting on the set of \"The Outlaw Josey Wales\" in 1976 and starred in six films together throughout their relationship. They were together for about 13 years.\n\nDuring those years, Eastwood expressed that he didn't want to have any children, and Locke respected his wishes. But eventually, it became known that the pair were trapped in one of the most notoriously toxic relationships in Hollywood history. Later on, it turned out that he had two children with a woman he was seeing on the side. A true Hollywood star.\n\nCher and Gregg Allman\n\nCher's romance with the Allman Brothers singer was one of the biggest stories in the mid-'70s, as she got married three days after her divorce from Sonny Bono was finalized. The couple wed in 1975, and the public watched the couple's troubled marriage unfold over the next few years, and they were divorced by 1979.\n\nDuring their marriage, Cher and Allman welcomed a child, Elijah Blue Allman, in 1976. They also collaborated musically and released the duet album \"Two the Hard Way\" in 1977. In her 2018 interview with \"The Daily Mail,\" Cher explained that Allman's substance issues hurt their relationship. Sadly, Allman died following complications from liver cancer in 2017.\n\nMovita Castaneda and Marlon Brando\n\nMarlon Brando, renowned for his exceptional acting talent, also had a turbulent personal life marked by drama. While hailed as one of the most gifted actors of all time, his journey through three marriages shed light on his relationships. Particularly intriguing was his second marriage to Movita Castaneda, shrouded in mystery, as the couple guarded their relationship with utmost privacy.\n\nThe couple met in the early '50s and secretly married in 1960. She was known for a small role in the movie \"Mutiny on the Bounty.\" In a twist of fate, Marlon met his third wife, Tarita Teriipaia, while filming the 1962 remake of the same film. He married Tarita that same year, even though his divorce from Movita wasn't finalized until 1968.\n\nLena Horne and Lennie Hayton\n\nDuring the 1940s, Lena achieved great fame and became the highest-earning African-American actor in the United States. It was during this period that she crossed paths with Lennie Hayton, whom she married in 1947. However, due to the intense scrutiny surrounding their interracial relationship, the couple decided to relocate to Paris.\n\nDespite facing hate combined with racism, their love persevered, and they remained together until his passing in 1971. She never married again after Hayton's death. The couple had a son named Teddy Jones, but he tragically passed away in 1970 due to a kidney ailment, as reported by \"The Guardian.\"\n\nJane Fonda and Donald Sutherland\n\nJane and Donald lit up the screen in the 1971 film \"Klute,\" so it wasn't totally surprising to hear about their affair. At the time, he was married to Shirley Douglas. \"We got together shortly before we made Klute, and then we were together until the relationship exploded and fell apart in Tokyo,\" he said in an interview.\n\n\"And it broke my heart. I was eviscerated. I was so sad. It was a wonderful relationship right up to the point we lived together.\" It wasn't long after their breakup that Sutherland married French Canadian actress Francine Racette after meeting her on the set of the Canadian pioneer drama Alien Thunder.\n\nCarrie Fisher and Paul Simon\n\nWhile they seem like an unlikely couple, their turbulent relationship kicked off after meeting while Fisher was working on the original \"Star Wars\" movie in 1977. They had a brief marriage from 1983–1984 and dated for about ten years after that. Paul wrote several songs about her, including \"Hearts and Bones.\"\n\nReflecting on the song in a later interview, Paul said: “That was one of my best songs. It took a long time to write it, and it was very true. It was about things that happened. The characters are very near to autobiographical. It’s probably the only track that I really like on that album.”\n\nRhea Perlman and Danny DeVito\n\nRhea and Danny were one of Hollywood's longest-running couples before separating in 2012. They were together for over 40 years and had three children. The two reunited in 2013 but ultimately split for a second time in March 2017. DeVito said in 2019 that he and Perlman have remained “very close\" since their split.\n\n\"We’re still close friends,” the actor went on to say, “we’re happy. Everybody’s happy.” While they're separated, their divorce hasn't been finalized yet. The two have appeared onscreen together many times over the years, including on his classic TV show \"Taxi\" and the 1996 family film \"Matilda,\" in which they played a married couple.\n\nOprah Winfrey and John Tesh\n\nOprah Winfrey's discreet romance with musician and TV personality John Tesh in the mid-70s remained largely unknown until many years later. It wasn't until an unauthorized biography of Winfrey was released, suggesting that Tesh had ended the relationship due to societal pressures surrounding interracial unions, that he finally acknowledged their past together with a public statement.\n\nJohn Tesh went on the say that \"Oprah and I were cub reporters in Nashville nearly 40 years ago, and we dated for a short time. We even talked about it during one of my appearances on her show. We remain friends to this day,\" he said in his interview.\n\nBarbra Streisand and Pierre Trudeau\n\nIn the early '70s, Barbra Streisand dated Pierre Trudeau—former Prime Minister of Canada and the father of current Prime Minister Justin Trudeau. Their relationship didn't last, though she has been known to praise her ex's son on Twitter. And after the elder Trudeau's death in 2000, Streisand contributed her memories of him to the book \"Pierre.\"\n\n\"Pierre Trudeau was a graceful balance of contradictions,\" she said. \"He was an elegant, private, and dignified man who was also charmingly bohemian. And it all flowed through him so naturally. He was always ahead of his time.\" She concluded by stating, ” I’m proud to have been a part of his life.”\n\nGrace Kelly and Prince Rainier of Monaco\n\nKnown for her captivating presence as the \"icy blonde\" American film star, she achieved stardom through Alfred Hitchcock's thrilling masterpieces like \"To Catch A Thief,\" \"Rear Window,\" and \"High Society.\" Her path intertwined with Prince Rainier of Monaco at the Cannes Film Festival in 1955, where he sought an American starlet as a wife to reinvigorate Monaco's tourism industry.\n\nUltimately, Kelly married Prince Rainier in 1956, donning a magnificent dress designed by her film studio, and the ceremony captivated the eyes of over 30 million viewers. Taking on her role as princess consort, she declined Hitchcock's pleas to continue acting for him, choosing instead to dedicate herself to philanthropic endeavors until her untimely death in a car accident in 1982.\n\nElla Fitzgerald and Ray Brown\n\nAlthough not from the realm of acting, these two individuals are musical royalty; Ella Fitzgerald was hailed as one of the greatest jazz singers in the USA. In 1947, during a tour of the South, Fitzgerald crossed paths with jazz double bassist Ray Brown, and they tied the knot that same year. Together, they recorded songs and graced stages across the country.\n\nDespite the pressures of their careers leading them in different directions, their marriage eventually succumbed, leading to their separation in 1953. However, their musical partnership remained intact as they continued to perform together. As a musical duo, if not as romantic partners, they were a flawless match, creating harmonies that left an indelible mark on the world of music."
