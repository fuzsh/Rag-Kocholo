        "text": "Julie Andrews is a sparkling star of the stage and screen, with a career spanning multiple decades. She’s starred in tons of classic musicals, like Thoroughly Modern Millie, The Sound of Music, and Mary Poppins, which she won an Academy Award for. Fans who were youngsters in the early aughts though may recognize her more for her roles in modern classics like The Princess Diaries. More recently though, Julie has appeared in the hit Netflix series Bridgerton.\n\nJulie is set to appear in her Mary Poppins co-star Dick Van Dyke’s 98 Years of Magic special on CBS on Thursday, December 21. The special commemorates the actor’s 98th birthday, and it will feature performances from those closest to him as well as younger stars who were influenced by his work.\n\nThroughout her career, Julie was married to two men: Tony Walton and Blake Edwards. While her marriage to Tony ended in divorce, she was wed to Blake until he died in 2010. Get to know more about both of Julie’s husbands here.\n\nTony Walton\n\nJulie married British set and costume designer Tony Walton on May 10, 1959 in Weybridge, Surrey. The actress initially met Tony when she was performing in Humpty Dumpty in 1948. Growing up, Julie had often performed with her mother and stepfather, and, at 13, she was the youngest performer to appear at a Royal Variety performance.\n\nAfter meeting Tony and developing a relationship with him, she walked down the aisle at 24. They share one child, a daughter named Emma, who currently works as a children’s author. Julie welcomed Emma in 1962, right before she shot to stardom with Mary Poppins. Tony notably designed Mary Poppins’ iconic costumes for the flick.\n\nThe couple ultimately divorced in 1968 and Julie went on to marry director Blake Edwards (more on that below). Tony passed away on March 2, 2022. Although the pair wasn’t married for too long, Julie still reflected on their love for PEOPLE after his death. “Tony was my dearest and oldest friend. He taught me to see the world with fresh eyes and his talent was simply monumental. I will miss him more than I can say.”\n\nShe added, “We are a huge, blended family and as we hold each other close, we take comfort knowing that he lives on, not only in his children and grandchildren, but in the memories of thousands who cherished his warmth and generosity and the glorious gifts he gave us. Gifts of theatre and film, ballet and opera, the graphic arts and illustration.”\n\nBlake Edwards"
