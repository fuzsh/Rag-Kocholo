        "text": "Julie Andrews' early encounter with her late husband Blake Edwards was either \"corny\" or \"wonderfully Hollywood\", depending on who you asked.\n\nThe two Tinseltown icons first met a decade before they exchanged vows in 1969, initially as \"ships that passed in the night at some event\", as Andrews recalls.\n\nThen, they crossed paths in a more literal way, making eye contact at an intersection in Los Angeles as they drove in opposite directions from the same therapist's office.\n\n\"I was going one way and he was going the other,\" Andrews recalled in a 2015 interview with Good Morning Britain.\n\nRELATED: Betty White met her beloved third husband after two 'mistakes'\n\n\"He rolled down the window after smiling a couple of times, and he said, 'Are you going where I just came from?' ... Very corny, sorry about that.\"\n\nIn an interview with ABC's Diana Sawyer, she added, \"I'm afraid I was trying very hard not to fall in love with him.\"\n\nAs far as the American director behind Breakfast at Tiffany's and Pink Panther was concerned, their meet-cute was \"wonderfully Hollywood\".\n\nAt the time, Andrews and Edwards were both married, to set designer Tony Walton and actress-turned-costume designer Patricia Walker respectively.\n\nThe Mary Poppins star had known Walton since she was 13 and he was 12. They married in 1959 and welcomed a daughter, Emma, three years later.\n\nIn 1967, Andrews and Edwards both divorced their first spouses. They had reconnected towards the end of their marriages, and began dating soon after their divorces were finalised.\n\nIn the early days of their relationship, Edwards was forced to own up to a lewd joke he'd made about the English actress about six weeks before they met.\n\nThe writer and director had been at a party when conversation turned to film stars who'd been catapulted to fame, and what it was that had made them successful.\n\nRELATED: Love Stories: A heartbreaking loss led Meryl Streep to her husband Don Gummer\n\nAndrews' name had been thrown in the ring, thanks to her lauded role as the governess Maria in 1965's The Sound of Music.\n\n\"At just the right moment, I said, 'I can tell you exactly what it is. She has lilacs for pubic hair',\" Edwards admitted in a joint interview with Andrews for Playboy magazine.\n\nAndrews wasn't at the soiree, so imagine Edwards' shock when, just weeks later, his new girlfriend offered him a housewarming present: a lilac bush.\n\nHe was convinced it was a reference to his dinner party joke, but when Andrews assured him she had no idea what he was talking about, he confessed.\n\n\"He told me, and of course, I concurred; it's absolutely true,\" she quipped.\n\nThe Academy Award winner didn't let Edwards entirely off the hook, though, presenting him with lilacs \"in every way, shape and form\" as anniversary gifts each year.\n\nProphetically, one of the guests who had witnessed Edwards' lilac joke first-hand, agent Stan Kamen, told him on the night: \"With your luck, you'll wind up marrying her.\"\n\nIn 1969, that prediction came true, with the couple tying the knot at Andrews' home in November after two years together.\n\nAndrews and Edwards continued raising their children together — he had two children, Jennifer and Geoffrey, from his marriage to Patricia Walker — and later adopted two daughters, Amy and Joanna, who were both orphans from Vietnam.\n\nThe family had an international lifestyle, with home bases in LA, London and Gstaad in Switzerland.\n\nRELATED: Love Stories: Goldie Hawn and Kurt Russell's first date was crashed by the police\n\nAndrews and Edwards also collaborated on seven films during their marriage, with varying success. These included Darling Lili, S.O.B. and Victor/Victoria, which earned Andrews an Oscar nomination for Best Actress and was later turned into a stage show.\n\nThough they were devoted to one another, the couple faced some challenges, namely Edwards' struggles with mental illness — including hypochondria, \"horrible bouts of depression\" and suicidal thoughts.\n\n\"Blake was the most charismatic and interesting fellow you could possibly meet,\" Andrews recalled during a talk promoting her 2019 memoir Home Work: A Memoir of My Hollywood Years.\n\n\"He was hilariously funny and had such a dark sense of humor that just put me away, that I loved so much. But he was also, at times, a very depressive personality and had a very difficult time.\"\n\nAndrews acknowledged her own turbulent childhood with an alcoholic mother and step-father may have led her to attempt to \"save\" her husband from his \"monsters\".\n\n\"You have to remember, I was very used to that kind of thing, because I was a very big codependent with my own family, and so I became that with Blake,\" she told Sawyer.\n\nThe couple's approach to marriage was to \"take it one day at a time\", and they remained together until Edwards died of pneumonia complications in 2010 at age 88, following a years-long battle with chronic fatigue syndrome.\n\n\"We were married 41 years, and it was a love story, it was,\" she told Good Morning Britain.\n\nAndrews was at Edwards' side when he died. The grief of his passing hasn't left her, but she \"carries that love\" to this day.\n\n\"There are days when it's perfectly wonderful and I am myself, and then it's suddenly sock you in the middle of your gut and you think 'ah, God, I wish he were here'. But he is, in a way,\" she said in 2015.\n\nAndrews remembers her late husband as incomparable; the most \"charismatic, mercurial gentleman\" she'd ever met.\n\n\"They broke the mold when Blake was born. I hadn't come across anybody with his wit and sophistication, which I relied on a great deal,\" she told Oprah.\n\nFor a daily dose of 9Honey, subscribe to our newsletter here"
