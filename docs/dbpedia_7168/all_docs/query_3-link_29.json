        "text": "Julie Andrews is ''still dealing'' with the loss of her husband four years after his passing.\n\nThe 79-year-old actress was married to film director Blake Edwards for 41 years until his death in December 2010 and admits his loss hits her really hard on certain days and she will ''always'' carry her love for him.\n\nShe said: ''He sadly passed away about three years ago, but we were married 41 years and it was a love story, it was.\n\n''I'm still dealing with it. There are days when it's perfectly wonderful and I am myself and then it's suddenly - sock you in the middle of your gut and you think, 'Ah God, I wish he were here'. But he is in a way, I think one carries that love always.\n\n''Success in our marriage was to take it one day at a time and so, lo and behold, 41 years later there we still were.''\n\nThe 'Sound of Music' star underwent therapy to rid herself of some ''garbage'' in her life but is particularly pleased she did as she met Blake while traveling to one of her sessions to see the same therapist he used to visit.\n\nSpeaking to ITV's 'Good Morning Britain', he added: ''We met about 10 years before, literally ships that passed in the night at some event but we actually ... our cars, I was going one way and he was going the other, he rolled down the window after smiling a couple of times and he said, 'Are you going where I just came from?'\n\n''I was going to a therapist he was coming from. Very corny, sorry about that.''"
