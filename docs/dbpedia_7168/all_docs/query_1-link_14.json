        "text": "After their marriage in 1969, Julie Andrews and Blake Edwards collaborated on many projects until his death in 2010, starting in 1970 with the romantic musical spy film \"Darling Lili,\" and concluding with the 1995 Broadway musical \"Victor/Victoria,\" which, like the 1982 film it was based on, was directed by Edwards and starred Ms. Andrews.\n\nThe Sag Harbor Cinema will open \"Julie and Blake,\" the second exhibition in connection with its yearlong retrospective \"The Worlds of Julie Andrews,\" on Saturday, on its third floor.\n\n“The artistic collaboration between Julie Andrews and Blake Edwards is one of the greatest in Hollywood history,\" says Giulia D'Agnolo Vallan, the cinema's founding artistic director. \"Their love for film and its craft, as well as their understanding of the power of art to illuminate life’s complexities and absurdism, are a joy to experience in the seven films they did together.\"\n\nThe exhibition will open after Saturday's 5:30 p.m. screening of the 1981 film \"S.O.B.,\" in which Ms. Andrews plays a famous actress who agrees to bare it all for the camera in order to save her husband's career. The screening will be followed by a conversation with Edwards's daughter Jennifer, who has a role in the film.\n\nThe cinema will also show Edwards's cut of his western \"Wild Rovers\" (1971), which was released by the studio in a drastically cut version that did not represent the director's original concept for the film. Bob Rubin, a film collector and historian, will lead a discussion after Sunday's 4 p.m. showing. Ms. Andrews will introduce the film.\n\n\"Julie and Blake\" will reflect the collaboration between the couple with annotated scripts, rare photographs, sketches, correspondence, and artworks, among them Edwards's sculptures that were used in his 1983 comedy \"The Man Who Loved Women.\"\n\nIn addition to \"Darling Lili,\" \"Victor/Victoria,\" and \"S.O.B.,\" the couple worked together on the films \"10,\" \"The Tamarind Seed,\" \"The Man Who Loved Women,\" and \"That's Life.\" Their life together led to interests beyond film: Edwards fostered his wife's passion for children's literature, and she encouraged his interest in painting and sculpture.\n\n\"S.O.B.\" stars Richard Mulligan as Felix Farmer, a successful Hollywood producer whose most recent film, \"Night Wind,\" was a disaster. After several bungled suicide attempts, Farmer decides to rework \"Night Wind\" into a softcore porn epic in which his wife, played by Ms. Andrews, will make her debut as a topless star.\n\nVincent Canby, a New York Times film critic, wrote, \"The performances are wickedly right . . . Mr. Edwards's direction is as furious as his screenplay is funny.\"\n\nMs. Andrews did not appear in \"Wild Rovers,\" which starred William Holden and Ryan O'Neal as two cowboys who decide to rob a bank so they can retire to Mexico. Needless to say, with a posse on their trail, things don't go according to plan. Roger Ebert called the film \"a beautiful, dumb cowboy movie about two beautiful, dumb cowboys.\"\n\nOriginally intended as a three-hour epic, the film was heavily edited by Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer without Edwards's knowledge, including a reversal of the ending from a negative to a positive one. Edwards disowned the finished film, and he satirized his battle with the studio in \"S.O.B.\"\n\nThe director's cut, which was released on home video in 1986, restored 30 minutes of the deleted footage.\n\n\"Julie and Blake,\" which will be open to the public during the cinema's normal operating hours, will be on view through July 4."
