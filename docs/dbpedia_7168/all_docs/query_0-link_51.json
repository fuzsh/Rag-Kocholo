        "text": "(2 of 2)\n\nMary Poppins was never a junkie, no matter what the bumper stickers said, but it does seem that she will soon become a divorcee. Confirming longstanding rumors, Julie Andrews, 32, filed suit in Santa Monica, Calif., for divorce from English Stage Designer Tony Walton, 33, her husband since 1959. In a formal statement more notable for brevity than syntax, Julie explained that \"the varying demands of our careers have kept Tony and I apart, placing obvious strains upon our marriage.\" Another obvious strain, Director (The Pink Panther) Blake Edwards, 45, has recently acquired his own divorce, and will presumably be at hand when Julie's decree becomes final in a year.\n\nAfter he agreed to knock back a few vodkas with the London Daily Express' man in Moscow, British Traitor Harold Philby, 55, proved aggressively unrepentant. \"I would do it again tomorrow,\" said the former chief of British counterintelligence, who went over the wall in 1963. His purpose, he said, \"was the fight for Communism\" and the eradication of the many evils of capitalism, prominent among them \"the expense-account lunch, British railways, the Beaverbrook press, the English Channel and the rising cost of living.\" By contrast, Philby added, \"I am having a love affair with Moscow,\" marred only by one touch of staleness: \"I am rather tired of caviar.\""
