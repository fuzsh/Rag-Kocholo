        "text": "Back in 2007, I took part in a truly bizarre three-year (mostly) summer program run by the National Association of Scholars, a conservative advocacy group that had received a huge Teaching American History grant. This was the brainchild of Senator Robert Byrd who wanted to promote the teaching of “traditional” American history. The whole thing was a combination of indoctrination and a cash grab. I don’t want to step on a separate blog I’ll be writing about this soon, but I needed to provide some background. Almost every professor in the program came from Ashland University, a very conservative school in Ohio. Even after the three-year program was over, they still found ways of funneling us money to sit through lectures from various right-wing ideologues.\n\nMy favorite was Robert Lowry Clinton, the author of a book on Marbury v. Madison. His premise was that the decision itself was unconstitutional. Chief Justice John Marshall’s creative solution which said that the Court didn’t have the power to grant William Marbury his request of issuing a writ of mandamus was invented and therefore illegitimate. Marshall’s reasoning, while creative, has usually been taken as sound, and the bedrock of the Court’s ability to say what laws and actions are constitutional. Clinton’s argument is largely that of a textualist. Article III of the Constitution does not say anything about judicial review.\n\nFor years I just shrugged my shoulders about this and thought Marshall had “fixed” a flaw of the Constitution through his creative manipulation, sort of like Alexander Hamilton allowing the non-existent Federal Bank to loan the federal government $2 million dollars to buy the first shares of the Bank. Although politically I don’t tend to agree all that much with people who lean on the original intent of the framers, there’s something in my personality that finds textualism appealing. Words have meaning and it troubles me on a technical (some would say anal retentive) level when people massage them to read what they want into the text.\n\nSo I’d actually been reading up on this topic before I heard Clinton speak. I’d concluded from my research that the best argument for judicial review — beyond Marshall’s creative explanation — was that “the judicial power,” a term in Article III that is never defined, must include judicial review. After hearing Clinton I pursued the topic more aggressively asking several major historians and constitutional scholars their opinions. The arguments were pretty compelling:\n\nAll of the states had judicial review at the state level, adding weight to the idea that this was an accepted norm within “the judicial power.”\n\nHamilton’s Federalist #78 directly addressed the issue of judicial review. Although the Federalist Papers are not official documents, Supreme Court justices had leaned on them countless times in Supreme Court decisions (and often it was the conservative justices focusing on original intent!).\n\nThe academic argument ultimately was pointless in the 21st century considering the completely embedded power that every justice of the Court has accepted for well over a century, even Justice Clarence Thomas who occasionally flirts with textualism and arcane positions that would undue dozens if not hundreds of decisions.\n\nBut back to Clinton’s presentation. I had my own argument about Marshall fixing the broken design and the final bullet point in mind when I raised my hand and asked, “So what would happen if Congress, in the throes of anti-Muslim sentiment, passed a law that violated the Thirteenth Amendment, choosing to imprison all Muslims and make them slaves of the state?”\n\nClinton responded, “That’s why we have elections.”\n\nI think I stammer, “I’m sorry, what?”\n\nTo which he said, “If the people of the country don’t like a law, they can change it by electing different leadership.”\n\nAlthough I didn’t have Federalist #78 fresh in my memory at the time, I did have Federalist #10 at the forefront of my thoughts. That’s James Madison’s treatise on the dangers of the tyranny of the majority.\n\nI still have Clinton’s book, and I’ll confess that I’ve never read it. Maybe he made a better case in writing than in person.\n\nI thought it was an utterly fringe idea until I ran into it again recently in my AP US Government and Politics group on Facebook where at least one teacher seemed to be on board with Clinton.\n\nNow if you really want to be weirded out, search YouTube for video clips on the Fourteenth Amendment. You’ll find an array of lunatic fringe statement that the amendment itself is unconstitutional. Up is down, people."
