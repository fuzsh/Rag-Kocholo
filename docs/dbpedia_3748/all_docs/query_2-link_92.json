        "text": "In 1984, the University purchased the Lowry House, located at 110 University Avenue. The house was the home of the famous hymn writer Rev. Robert Lowry, Class of 1854, Professor of Rhetoric, and pastor of the First Baptist Church from 1869 to 1875. In 1985, the house was renovated to accommodate Psychological Services, which moved there from the Botany Building."
