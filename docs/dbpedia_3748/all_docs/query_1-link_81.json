        "text": "Robert “Rob” Dean Lowry II, age 65, passed away May 30, 2023, after a brief illness. Preceded in death by his father Bob Lowry and brother Mike Lowry. He is survived by longtime partner Carol Jameson; children Katie (Corey Eschenauer) Gregory, Meri (Josh) Benadum, Jessica (Corey) Fischer; grandchildren Claire Gregory, Thea and Iris Benadum, Walt and Ellie Fischer; mother Donna Thomas; sister Jeannie (Kurt) Nowicki; nephew Nate Nowicki; niece Mary-Paige Nowicki; former spouse Peg Schweizer Lowry, and many other relatives and friends.\n\nRob has always enjoyed being his own boss; in 1998 he co-founded Commercial Control Services where he went on to have a successful and fulfilling career before retiring in 2021. Many of his business acquaintances have become treasured friends as Rob can strike up a conversation and share a meal with just about anyone. Rob was a steadfast friend and could be found most days hanging with the “Spuds crowd.” In later years he enjoyed connecting with his classmates from Grandview Junior High and Hilliard High School class of 1976 (his most beloved classmate being Carol Jameson, class of 1977). Rob loved to hear people’s life stories and took an interest in his friends’ diverse backgrounds, talents, and careers. If Rob has had a conversation with you, chances are his kids and Carol know your life story too.\n\nRob made the most out of retirement by watching as much collegiate wrestling as he could, taking cooking classes, eating ethnic food, consuming every bit of global and local politics, staying current with music and pop culture, watching live music, reading, getting out on a boat to fish, and showing the rest of us who’s boss in the kitchen. Rob was furthering his plans to “eat his way around the world” and in recent weeks channeled his creativity towards a high-flavor and low-sodium diet. Above everything else, he treasured the time he spent with Carol, his kids, and his grandkids.\n\nJoin us to celebrate his life and share your memories of him during calling hours on Monday, June 5 from 4 to 7 pm at Egan-Ryan Northwest Chapel, 4661 Kenny Rd. A formal funeral service will be held Tuesday, June 6 at 11:30 a.m. with calling starting at 10:30 a.m. at Egan-Ryan Northwest Chapel. In lieu of flowers, contributions can be made in his name to Ohio State University’s wrestling program or the City of Columbus PLAY Scholarship Fund.\n\nThe recording of the funeral service can be viewed by clicking HERE"
