        "text": "Robert Wadsworth Lowry was an American Baptist minister best known for his hymns. Though he published several books of poetry and prose during his lifetime, his lasting impact comes from his hymn writing. Lowry's hymns, many still sung today, are characterized by their simple language, strong emotional appeal, and focus on themes of faith, hope, and comfort.\n\nWriting during a time of significant social and cultural change in America, Lowry's hymns resonated with a nation grappling with the aftermath of the Civil War and the rapid modernization of society. His work reflects the Victorian era's emphasis on sentimentality and moral instruction, often employing vivid imagery and musical language to convey religious truths."
