        "text": "Rev. Robert Lowry was born in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania on March 12, 1826 and at age 22 entered the University of Lewisburg (now Bucknell University). After graduating at age 28 he served as pastor in West Chester, PA; New York City; Brooklyn; and then returned to Lewisburg, where he was a professor and received an honorary doctorate.\n\nMonument Text: The famed hymn-writer lived in this house, 1869-75. Here, some of his best known hymns were written. His music was sung in many foreign lands. One of his works is, “Shall We Gather at the River.” Lowry died in 1899.\n\nIn 1864 a heat wave struck Brooklyn. It seemed to Lowry to contrast with the heavenly city as recorded in Revelation 22:1: “And he shewed me a pure river of water of life, clear as crystal, proceeding out of the throne of God and of the Lamb.” Even though it wasn’t his favorite, that song became the favorite of many:\n\nShall we gather at the river,\n\nWhere bright angel feet have trod;\n\nWith its crystal tide forever\n\nFlowing by the throne of God?\n\nRefrain:\n\nYes, we’ll gather at the river,\n\nThe beautiful, the beautiful river;\n\nGather with the saints at the river\n\nThat flows by the throne of God.\n\nIn addition to songs he worked on with Fanny Crosby like “All the Way My Savior Leads Me,” Lowry wrote this song in 1876 based on Revelation 1:5 and Revelation 7:14\n\nWhat can wash away my sin?\n\nNothing but the blood of Jesus.\n\nWhat can make me whole again?\n\nNothing but the blood of Jesus.\n\nRefrain:\n\nO precious is the flow\n\nthat makes me white as snow;\n\nno other fount I know;\n\nnothing but the blood of Jesus.\n\nOn Easter Sunday you’ll likely hear his testament to the Resurrection:\n\nLow in the grave he lay, Jesus my Savior,\n\nwaiting the coming day, Jesus my Lord!\n\nRefrain:\n\nUp from the grave he arose;\n\nwith a mighty triumph o’er his foes;\n\nhe arose a victor from the dark domain,\n\nand he lives forever, with his saints to reign.\n\nHe arose! He arose! Hallelujah! Christ arose!\n\nHe also authored another tune for “Come Ye that Love the Lord”\n\nAnd, you’ll recognize the chorus to “I need thee every hour.” While Lowry didn’t write the stanzas, he did write the refrain:\n\nRefrain:\n\nI need thee, O I need thee;\n\nevery hour I need thee!\n\nO bless me now, my Savior,\n\nI come to thee."
