        "text": "A Denver jury found a 58-year-old man guilty Tuesday of first-degree murder in the 2015 death of his wife.\n\nRobert “Bob” Feldman was convicted after the jury deliberated for about two hours for the death of 44-year-old Stacy Feldman, according to the Denver District Attorney’s Office. Her body was found in their south Denver home on March 1, 2015.\n\nAt the time of her death, Stacy had just discovered that Feldman was having an extramarital affair. Feldman collected a $750,000 insurance payout after his wife’s death. The long-awaited trial started on April 6.\n\n“Despite his creative efforts to evade justice, today Robert Feldman was found guilty of murdering his wife, Stacy Feldman,” said Denver DA Beth McCann in a news release. “I am extremely proud of the outstanding work by our prosecutors, investigators, victim advocates, support staff, and the Denver police detectives who never gave up on securing justice for Stacy. Moreover, I thank the jury for performing their civic duty over these past three weeks.”\n\nFeldman was charged by prosecutors in the case with first-degree murder in February 2018. District Court Judge Edward D. Bronfin on Tuesday immediately imposed a sentence of life in prison without the possibility of parole.\n\nAt the start of the trial, prosecutors told jurors that Feldman strangled or suffocated his wife after she learned about the affair. Feldman then picked up his young children from school — an hour late — and took them to a church carnival before returning home and calling 911, telling operators he’d just discovered his wife unresponsive in the bathtub with the water running.\n\n“The firefighters noticed there was no water on the floor,” Senior Chief Deputy District Attorney Maggie Conboy said of the first responders to the 911 call.\n\nFeldman’s defense attorneys — whom he’d planned to pay with the insurance money from his wife’s death — told jurors that Stacy Feldman had a long history of medical problems, including an enlarged heart, and just happened to drop dead in the shower within hours of learning about her husband’s affair.\n\nStacy Feldman’s death was not ruled a homicide by the Denver medical examiner’s office; pathologists could not pinpoint a cause of death. Her death was also not initially investigated as a homicide by Denver police until they learned about Robert Feldman’s affair months later.\n\nIn 2019, the Colorado Supreme Court ruled that Feldman could use $550,000 of the $750,000 he received from his wife’s life insurance policy to pay his defense attorneys, even though the guardian of his two young children argued they should get the funds."
