        "text": "Casualty.\n\nLOWRY, Robert.\n\n$100.00\n\nItem Number: 115068\n\nNew York: New Directions, 1946.\n\nFirst edition of Lowry’s powerful story about a WWII Photo Reconnaissance Wing in Italy. Octavo, original cloth. Presentation copy, inscribed by the author on the front free endpaper, “To Mrs. Robert Levine Good friend to the Little Man Robert Lowry.” Very good in a very good dust jacket. Author photograph by Peter Martin.\n\nRobert Lowry gained the factual background for Casualty in his 39 months of service as a GI, 23 of which were spent with the AAF in Africa and Italy. The anarchy and boredom American soldiers experience in overseas army camps are brought into sharp focus in this tense and powerful novel."
