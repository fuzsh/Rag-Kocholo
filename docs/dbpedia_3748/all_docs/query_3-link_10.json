        "text": "Captain Lowry (88), late of Blessingbourne, Fivemiletown, passed away peacefully on February 19 at the South West Acute Hospital, Enniskillen following a short illness.\n\nDescribing his father as “a family man”, Captain Lowry’s eldest son, Nicholas, said: “As children, we had as much attention as we could possibly want.\n\n“He was good for the community as well. He was very conscientious, and he always had the best interests of others at heart, and certainly all the committees he was on,” he added.\n\nBorn in 1932, Captain Lowry grew up in London. As his father was in the Royal Navy, during World War II Captain Lowry, his mother and sisters, Rosamund and Maimie, were evacuated to Northern Ireland, where they resided at Blessingbourne Estate, owned by his mother’s family, the Montgomerys.\n\nThis is when he first fell in love with the estate, which he would later inherit and call his home.\n\nIn his youth, Captain Lowry briefly attended Rockport School in Holywood, County Down. He then moved back to England and attended school in Essex before going on to the King’s School, Canterbury.\n\nNicholas said: “Like most of us in the family, he didn’t excel academically or sportingly, but he did have an interest in rowing.”\n\nIn 1951, Captain Lowry enlisted with the Royal Irish Fusiliers and worked his way up to the rank of Captain before retiring in 1963.\n\nNorth Africa\n\nFor a time, he was stationed in North Africa, and from there he served during the Mau Mau Rising in Kenya, in the late 1950s.\n\nWhilst serving with the Fusiliers, Captain Lowry was also stationed in Northern Ireland and Germany.\n\n“When he left the army he went to Greenmount and learnt about farming then so he could manage Blessingbourne Estate,” said Nicholas, who went on to explain that his father studied more than just farming at the college.\n\n“It was about managing the estate and everything that goes with it.”\n\nIn 1958, Captain Lowry married the love of his life, Angela, who was from the south of England, and they went on to have three children: Nicholas, Peter and Joanna.\n\n“They had a long and happy marriage, together 61 years,” said Nicholas.\n\nVery active in his local community and beyond, Captain Lowry was President and Chairman of Clogher Valley Show from 1987 to 2007.\n\n“He was very much concerned with the Clogher Valley Show and he was very good with the Fivemiletown and Brookborough Creamery, where he was Vice-Chairman from 1970 to 1985, and Chairman from 1997 until around 2005,” said Nicholas.\n\nWith his military background, Captain Lowry was actively involved in the Royal British Legion.\n\nOutlining his many other roles and positions in the community, Nicholas said: “He was in an advisory group for the Enniskillen Museum and was Vice Lord Lieutenant for County Tyrone.\n\n“He was also Trustee for the Royal Irish Fusiliers Museum in Armagh.\n\n“He was on the Vestry of St. John’s Parish Church in Fivemiletown, and he also held the position of High Sheriff of Tyrone in 1987,” he added.\n\nIn his spare time Captain Lowry loved reading and was very fond of wildlife, particularly the flora and fauna that surrounded Blessingbourne Estate.\n\nHe always found peace and tranquility outdoors, such as riding horses, boating on Lough Erne, or walking the dogs.\n\nFuneral service\n\nCaptain Lowry’s funeral service will take place on Friday, February 26 at St. John’s Parish Church, Fivemiletown. Funeral arrangements are by Marcus Madill of S. R. Elliott Funeral Directors. Donations in lieu of flowers to Marie Curie.\n\nA much loved husband of Angela, and a devoted father of Nicholas (Colleen), Peter (Claudia) and Joanna (Adrian), a dear brother of Maimie and the late Rosamund, and a very special grandfather of Callum, Rory and Hubert, Captain Lowry is very sadly missed by all his loving family and family circle.\n\n“I’ll miss his wisdom, his guidance and his advice,” said Nicholas. “He developed Blessingbourne tirelessly, was greatly respected, and it’s definitely going to be a tough act to follow,” he told The Impartial Reporter."
