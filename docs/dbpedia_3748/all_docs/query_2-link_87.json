        "text": "American Poetess & Hymn Writer\n\nAnnie Sherwood Hawks wasn't your ordinary housewife. From the glimpse of her I gotten from the hymns she wrote such as I Need Thee Every Hour, I believe that she was an extra-ordinary woman. Or maybe I should say, an ordinary woman living in the presence of an extra-ordinary God.\n\nBiography of Annie S. Hawks\n\nAnnie Hawks was born in Hoosick, New York on May 28, 1835.\n\nFrom a young age, she was gifted in writing poetries and by the age of 14, she had her first poem published in the newspaper.\n\nIn 1857, at the age of 24, she mar­ried Charles H. Hawks and lived in Brook­lyn, New York. They worshipped at the Han­son Place Bap­tist Church where Robert Lowry was the pastor. Robert Lowry, himself a prolific hymn writer, encouraged her to write hymns and promised to write the music for her hymns. The Christian hymn, I Need Thee was one such example of the collaboration between him and Annie S. Hawks.\n\nAnnie and Charles Hawks had 3 children. In 1888, Charles Hawks died and she moved to Ben­ning­ton, Ver­mont to live with her daugh­ter and son-in-law (W. E. Put­nam).\n\nIn her life time, Annie S. Hawks wrote 400 hymns. She died in Jan­u­a­ry 3, 1918 at the age of 82, at Benn­ing­ton, Ver­mont and was buried in Hoo­sick Rur­al Cem­e­tery, Hoo­sick, New York.\n\nPopular Hymns Written By Annie Sherwood Hawks\n\nI Need Thee Every Hour\n\nWholly Thine\n\nEzine and Your Comments\n\nStay tuned!
