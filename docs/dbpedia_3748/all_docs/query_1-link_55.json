        "text": "I recently completed an epic, year-long “do-ver” of my family tree, and am now back to researching and transcribing. Robert Lowry is my newly discovered 7th great-grandfather. He named my 6th great-grandmother, Ann Lowry Dicken, wife of Benjamin Dicken, in his will, below. Lowry and Dicken were likely neighbors, as Dicken witnessed the one deed I have been able to locate for Robert Lowry, the purchase in 1763 of 200 acres of land on the north bank of Fishing Creek in Edgecombe County. Benjamin is also named as an additional executor to Lowry’s will in a 1773 codicil.\n\nUnusually, in my research anyway, Robert Lowry doesn’t appear to have been a slaveholder. There are no deeds regarding slaves that I could find, and he names no “negroes” in his will. As his land was on a creek, he may have been a miller of some kind. He could have been a livestock farmer rather than a “planter.” Or, possibly he had such a large family (including six sons) that he simply didn’t need any slaves to run his relatively small farm.\n\nWill of Robert Lowry\n\nIn the Name of God, Amen. I Robert Lowry of Edgecomb County in the Province of North Carolina, being thankful [for the] abundant mercy and goodness of God for Perfect health Sense and memory, Thanks be given to Almighty God therefore calling to mind the uncertainty of this Transitory Life and knowing that all flesh and blood yields to Death when it shall please God to Call do Constitute and Ordain this my Last Will and Testament that is to say Principally and first of all I give and Recommend my soul unto the hands of God that gave it to me for my Body I Recommend it to the Earth to be buried in a Christian-like and decent manner at the Discresion of my Executor Nothing doubting but at the general Resurrection I shall receive same Again by the mightly Power of God and as touching such Worldly Estate wherewith it hath Pleased God far above any _____ to bestow or _____in this life I give Divide and dispose of the Same in the following manner.\n\nITEM I give the ____ of all my Estate Both Real and personal being of what Nature kind or Quality soever Unto my loving Wife, Ann Lowry, During her Widowhood and at her Death or second Marriage to be Divided as followeth.\n\nITEM I give unto my son, John Lowry, all my Land together with the Houses Orchards and Appurtenances thereto belonging to him and his Heirs Lawfully begotten forever and if he Die without heirs Lawfully Begotten of his Body then the Land is to be Sold to the highest Bidder by my Executor or the Survivors of them in fee simple and the money arising from Such Sale to be Equally Divided among the rest of my children.\n\nITEM I give unto my sons, Lewis Lowry, Peter Lowry, & Rich’d Lowry Fifteen Pounds Current Money to be Equally Divided among them and their heirs.\n\nITEM I give unto my daughters, Frankey Langford & Jemimah Watts Twenty Pounds Current Money to be Equally Divided Between them; to them and their heirs For Ever.
