        "text": "This hymn, written by Isaac Watts, was first published in 1707 and was entitled “Heavenly Joy on Earth.” Watts authored over 600 hymns and is known as “The Father of English Hymnody.” He profoundly influenced other hymn writers, including John and Charles Wesley, who studied his hymns and often used them in their meetings. In 1737, while ministering in America, John included it in the first hymnal published in America, “Psalms and Hymns, Charlestown Collection.” Wesley omitted two of the original stanzas and gave the hymn a different title, “Heaven Begun on Earth.”\n\nSince then, the hymn has survived many changes, and most hymnals today use only four or five of the original ten stanzas. The title “Come, We That Love the Lord” is derived from the first line. The most common tune is “St. Thomas,” composed in 1763 by Aaron Williams, an 18th-century Welsh singing teacher and music engraver. Williams published several choir music collections for use in rural churches.\n\nIn 1869, more than 100 years later, Robert Lowry composed a new tune and refrain for Watts’ verses. Lowry was a Baptist pastor in Brooklyn and a well-known author and composer of gospel hymns. However, he often said he’d “rather preach than write.” He’s probably most famous for writing the words and music for “Shall We Gather at the River?”\n\nLowry was ministering and teaching during the Civil War, which was also a time when revivalism was rising in America. He was impressed with Watts’ text, but he wanted a musical setting that expressed the enthusiasm of the American revival movement. He adapted the text, composed a new tune, and called it “We’re Marching to Zion.” Taking “marching” from the words of Watts’ final stanza, Lowry created a refrain that gave the new setting its name:\n\n“We’re marching to Zion,\n\nBeautiful, beautiful Zion;\n\nWe’re marching upward to Zion,\n\nThe beautiful city of God.”\n\nThe repetitive nature of Lowry’s version makes the text more easily sung in less formal situations such as revival meetings, rural churches, and children's meetings. Lowry often added refrains to existing hymns. A common practice was for the adults to sing the verses written by Watts, and then the children would join in on the refrain.\n\nBoth settings of Isaac Watts’ hymn text appear in many hymnals, one expressing the Christian’s joy in a stately manner and the other in the enthusiastic spirit of a revival. Lowry’s version changed the emphasis from a reverent recognition of “Heavenly Joy on Earth” to that of a community of believers on the journey to eternity, joyfully anticipating when they’ll be at home in heaven, singing praises around the throne of God. And the ransomed of the LORD shall return, and come to Zion with songs and everlasting joy upon their heads: they shall obtain joy and gladness, and sorrow and sighing shall flee away (Isaiah 35:10).\n\nCome, we that love the Lord,\n\nAnd let our joys be known;\n\nJoin in a song with sweet accord,\n\nJoin in a song with sweet accord,\n\nAnd thus surround the throne,\n\nAnd thus surround the throne.\n\nRefrain:\n\nWe’re marching to Zion,\n\nBeautiful, beautiful Zion;\n\nWe’re marching upward to Zion,\n\nThe beautiful city of God.\n\nThe sorrows of the mind\n\nBe banished from the place!\n\nReligion never was designed,\n\nReligion never was designed\n\nTo make our pleasures less,\n\nTo make our pleasures less.\n\nLet those refuse to sing\n\nThat never knew our God,\n\nBut fav’rites of the heav’nly King,\n\nBut fav’rites of the heav’nly King\n\nMay speak their joys abroad,\n\nMay speak their joys abroad.\n\nThe God that rules on high,\n\nAnd thunders when he please,\n\nThat rides upon the stormy sky,\n\nThat rides upon the stormy sky,\n\nAnd manages the seas,\n\nAnd manages the seas.\n\nThis awful God is ours,\n\nOur Father and our love,\n\nHis Son shall come with heav’nly pow’r,\n\nHis Son shall come with heav’nly pow’r,\n\nTo carry us above,\n\nTo carry us above.\n\nThere we shall see his face,\n\nAnd never, never sin;\n\nThere from the rivers of his grace,\n\nThere from the rivers of his grace\n\nDrink endless pleasures in,\n\nDrink endless pleasures in.\n\nYes, and before we rise\n\nTo that immortal state,\n\nThe thoughts of such amazing bliss,\n\nThe thoughts of such amazing bliss\n\nShould constant joys create,\n\nShould constant joys create.\n\nThe men of grace have found\n\nGlory begun below,\n\nCelestial fruits on earthly ground,\n\nCelestial fruits on earthly ground\n\nFrom faith and hope may grow,\n\nFrom faith and hope may grow.\n\nThe hill of Zion yields\n\nA thousand sacred sweets,\n\nBefore we reach the heav’nly fields,\n\nBefore we reach the heav’nly fields,\n\nOr walk the golden street,\n\nOr walk the golden street.\n\nThen let our songs abound,\n\nAnd ev’ry tear be dry;\n\nWe’re marching through Immanuel’s ground,\n\nWe’re marching through Immanuel’s ground\n\nTo fairer worlds on high,\n\nTo fairer worlds on high.\n\nAll rights reserved.
