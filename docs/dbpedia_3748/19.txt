LOWRY WAS A SUCCESSFUL AND MUCH LOVED PASTOR. HE POSSESSED A BRILLIANT MIND

AND GREAT KNOWLEDGE OF THE SCRIPTURES, WHICH MADE HIM AN EXCEPTIONAL PREACIER.

HE SAID, “I WOULD RATHER PREACH A GOSPEL SERMON TO AN

APPRECIATIVE AND RECEPTIVE CONGREGATION THAN WRITE A HYMN”.

WITHOUT A DOUBT, LOWRY IS ENTITLED TO THE DOUBLE HONOUR INTENDED FOR THOSE WHO

LABOUR FAITHFULLY IN THE WORD AND DOCTRINE, BUT [T IS HIS CONTRIBUTION TO SACRED MUSIC

THAT WON HIM ENDURING FAME. EARLY IN LIFE, HE EXHIBITED A FONDNESS AND APTITUDE

FOR THE MANY HYMNS THAT ISSUED FROM HIS PEN.

ROBERT LOWRY WAS THE AUTHOR OF “SHALL WE GATHER AT THE RIVER”,

“CHRIST AROSE”, AND HIS PERSONAL FAVORITE, “NONE BUT JESUS”.

HE ALSO WROTE “NOTHING BUT THE BLOOD OF JESUS” WHICH IS

REGARDED AS A BAPTIST CONFESSION OF FAITH IN SONG,

WHILE PASTORING IN BROOKLYN, LOWRY WAS INSTRUMENTAL IN GATHERING THE

FLAT BUSH MISSION EN 1865. THE MISSION WAS LATER CONSTITUTED AS THE

SIXTH AVENUE BAPTIST CHURCH. AMONG THE CONSTITUTING MEMBERS WERE

CHARLES AND ANNIF HAWKS. MRS. HAWKS WROTE THE WELL LOVED HYMN

“I NEED THEE EVERY HOUR” AND LOWRY ADDED THE TUNE.

LOWRY ALSO COMPOSED THE MUSIC FOR GREAT HYMNS SUCH AS:

“SOMETHING FOR THEE”, “WE’RE MARCHING TO ZION”, AND

“ALL THE WAY MY SAVIOUR LEADS ME”.

UP FROM THE GRAVE HE AROSE,

WITH A MIGHTY TRIUMPH O’ER HIS FOES.

HE AROSE A VICTOR FROM THE DARK DOMAIN

AND HE LIVES FOREVER WITH HIS SAINTS TO REIGN.

HE AROSE! HE AROSE!

HALLELUJAH! CHRIST AROSE!
