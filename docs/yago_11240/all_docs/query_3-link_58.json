        "text": "Eric Stoltz, Julia Campbell and Simon Templeman will find themselves in the backwards-running web of Betrayal Oct. 10-14, opening the 2001-02 season of Los Angeles' Theatre Works recorded play readings at the Skirball Cultural Center. Rosalind Ayers directs.\n\nBroadway saw a revival of Betrayal last season at the Roundabout Theatre starring Juliet Binoche and Liev Schrieber. The 1978 play traces a love affair from its end to its beginnings as best friends Jerry and Robert move from coldness to close friendship, Robert and Emma change from weary married couple to happy honeymooners and Jerry and Emma move from broken-up adulterers to first-time lovers. Pinter is the author of The Caretaker, The Birthday Party, The Homecoming and Celebration.\n\nA 1989 Tony Award nominee as George in Our Town, Stoltz has since performed in New York City in Three Sisters, Two Shakespearean Actors, The Importance of Being Ernest and The Glass Menagerie. Campbell most recently appeared in \"Bounce\" with Ben Affleck and Gwyneth Paltrow. A popular voice actor, Templeman has done work with L.A. Theatre Works before (The Voysey Inheritance), as well as video game and television acting and voice work.\n\nTickets are $36-$40. Skirball Cultural Center is located at 2701 N. Sepulveda Blvd. For reservations, call (310) 827-0889."
