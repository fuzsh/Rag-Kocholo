She later performed in television commercials and guest starred on TV series in her teenage years. Her first acting role was in the CBS sitcom Here’s Lucy, but she was first noticed performing in another CBS sitcom: 1972’s short-lived Anna and the King as the eponymous king’s (Yul Brynner) eldest daughter.\n\nDropping out of acting, Chao enrolled in the communications department at the University of Southern California where she earned her degree in journalism. However, after spending a year as a radio newswriting intern at the CBS-owned Hollywood radio station KNX, she soon returned to acting.\n\nPhoto courtesy FemaleStars.com\n\nMore Rosalind Chao Biography at wikipedia\n\nFemale Celebrity Headlines\n\nPussycat Dolls Doll Domination photo by lknight_01\n\nPussycat Dolls have their new album out today called “Doll Domination” and its getting mixed reviews with some tracks being superb and some lacking a certain something, but if you are a PCD fan you will still buy anyway.
