This fearless female will waste no time showing you she can’t be contained. From the Philly streets to Dr. Dre’s “castle” in Calabasas to the world’s stage, this guest shares with us how you can be a truth teller and a storyteller without sacrificing your authenticity or your instincts. She also lets us in on how she wound up taking the entertainment industry by storm despite her biggest fear: public speaking. Eve dishes on everything, starting from the first audition with Dr. Dre to being dropped and her journey to writing music and not being put in a box. This interview gives all the insight to becoming the entertainment industry’s “It” woman.\n\nEve Jeffers Cooper is a GRAMMY Award-winning musician and actress. She serves as host of THE TALK, CBS’ Daytime Emmy Award-winning talk show that examines topical events and contemporary issues through the eyes of five female hosts, alongside Julie Chen, Sara Gilbert, Sharon Osbourne and Sheryl Underwood.\n\nAs a musician, Eve is best known for her music hits “What Y’all Want,” “Gangsta Lovin,” “Who’s that Girl,” “Satisfaction,” “Tambourine” and “Let Me Blow Ya Mind” featuring Gwen Stefani, which won the inaugural GRAMMY Award for Best Rap/Sung Collaboration in 2002. In 2016 she reunited with Stefani for the “This Is What the Truth Feels Like” tour and hosted the “VH1 Hip Hop Honors: All Hail The Queens.” Eve has released four multi-million selling albums and 32 singles, and throughout her career she has collaborated with many prominent artists, including Alicia Keys, Ludacris, Jill Scott, DMX, Swizz Beatz, Dr. Dre, Juicy J, The Roots and Missy Elliott.\n\nAmong Eve’s film credits are “xXx” with Vin Diesel, “Barbershop,” “Barbershop 2: Back in Business” and “Barbershop: The Next Cut” with Ice Cube, “The Cookout” with Queen Latifah and Meagan Good, “The Woodsman” and “Flashbacks.” On television she is best known for starring in her own self-titled UPN sitcom, “Eve,” and she also had a recurring role on “Glee” and appeared on four episodes of the Oxygen series “Sisterhood of Hip Hop.” IG: @therealeve\n\nTune into our Interview on iTunes HERE\n\nResources\n\nLINKS:\n\nEve on IMDb\n\nEVE on Instagram\n\nThe Talk\n\nBarbershop: The Next Cut\n\nLet Me Blow Ya Mind\n\nQUOTES:\n\n“I’m grateful for being dropped by Dr. Dre because I learned how to survive the industry.”\n\n“Music videos tell a story. Back in the 2000s music videos told a story and I played the character.”\n\n“I feel most comfortable on stage. It’s a meditation for me.”\n\n“I read scripts melodically. When you have a great script it flows like music.”\n\n“I wanted people to know me more than my music and The Talk has been a wonderful platform to do just that.”\n\n“Energetically trying something new that is not inside the box or in your comfort zone helps you grow as a person and an artist, there is always a lesson to be learned.”\n\n“Fear has always been in my life, its a constant, if I feel it…I run towards.”\n\n“Music is my true love. It’s the diary of my life.”\n\n“I just want to contribute, that is my goal in life. I just want to make sure I’m not wasting my platforming.”\n\nVIDEOS:"
