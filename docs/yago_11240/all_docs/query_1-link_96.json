        "text": "Early life\n\nChao was born in Anaheim, California as a second-generation Chinese-American.\n\nHer parents ran a successful pancake restaurant, Chao's, across the street from Disneyland, and employed her there from an early age. After moving from Garden Grove to Villa Park, California, Chao was enrolled at Marywood, an all-girl school, where she was the only non-white student. She graduated from Pomona College in 1978.\n\nPersonal life\n\nFor some time, Chao worked at Disneyland as an international tour guide. It was there she met Simon Templeman; the couple would eventually wed and have their reception at the Disneyland Hotel. They have two children.\n\nCareer\n\nChao's parents were instrumental in her decision to pursue acting; she began at the age of five in a California-based Peking opera traveling company at the instigation of her parents who were already heavily involved, and during the summers they sent her to Taiwan to further develop her acting. She later performed in television commercials and guest starred on TV series in her teenage years. Her first acting role was in the CBS sitcom Here's Lucy, but she was first noticed performing in another CBS sitcom: 1972's short-lived Anna and the King as the eponymous king's (Yul Brynner) eldest daughter.\n\nDropping out of acting, Chao enrolled in the communications department at the University of Southern California where she earned her degree in journalism. However, after spending a year as a radio newswriting intern at the CBS-owned Hollywood radio station KNX, she soon returned to acting.\n\nRe-commitment\n\nRemembering Chao from Anna and the King, television producer Burt Metcalfe provided her big break with the role of Soon-Lee, a South Korean refugee, in the final episodes of the TV series M*A*S*M*A*S*H. Soon-Lee married longtime starring character Maxwell Klinger (Jamie Farr) in the series finale \"Goodbye, Farewell and Amen\", the most-watched television episode of all time (as of 2015). Chao continued playing the character in the M*A*S*M*A*S*H sequel: 1983's AfterMASH, her first role billed at co-starring status.\n\nPost-M*A*S*H"
