Jay could not be more ecstatic that Dede has moved on for good but his overenthusiasm might come back and bite him later. Claire and Mitchell work on their toast while Phil and Cam geek out over their favorite author who is also on the train. Luke and Manny go a little girl crazy, Gloria gets stuck in coach and Alex gets caught up in the romance of the train herself."
