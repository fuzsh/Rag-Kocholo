        "text": "THE NEIGHBORS, now in its second season on ABC, Fridays at 8:30 PM, is half-hour comedy about human/extraterrestrial culture clash. The Weavers, a nice middle-class family consisting of dad Marty (Lenny Venito), mom Debbie (Jami Gertz) and three kids, move to a quiet gated community, where everyone else turns out to be from the planet Zabvron. Chief among the Zabvronians is the family next door to the Weavers. Simon Templeman plays the alien patriarch Larry Bird, who can be doleful, fretful, ambitious and wildly optimistic all at the same time. Larry is married to Jackie Joyner-Kersee (Toks Olegundoye) an they […]Read On »\n\nTHE NEIGHBORS, ABC’s freshman series about a middle-class human family who find they’ve moved into a neighborhood full of alien refugees, has its first-season finale tonight, Wed. March 26, at 8:30 PM. The episode will bring together original STAR TREK’s George Takei and original STAR WARS’ Mark Hamill. English actor Simon Templeman, who stars in THE NEIGHBORS as alien patriarch Larry Bird (the aliens have all adopted the names of Earth sports stars to go with their faux-human identities) talks about his experiences in portraying a Zabrvronian.

The aliens take their names from human sports celebrities, so the Weavers’ next-door neighbors – and tentative new friends – are dubbed Larry Bird (Simon Templeman) and Jackie Joyner-Kersee (Toks Olagundouye). The results are multiculturalism at a wider range than mere terrestrial folks […]Read On »\n\nStars: Jami Gertz, Lenny Venito, Simon Templeman, Toks Olagundoye, Clara Mamet, Tim Jo, Ian Patrick, Max Charles, Isabella Cramp Writer: Dan Fogelman Director: Chris Koch Network: ABC, airs Wednesday nights Original Telecast: September 26, 2012 You can’t fault ABC for at least trying something new. Last year, they trotted out their cross-dressing comedy WORK IT (epic fail) and this year they’ve got THE NEIGHBORS, a terribly dated suburban alien comedy that falls completely flat. Ten years ago, a bunch of aliens from the planet Zabvron arrived in a gated New Jersey neighborhood to see if Earth could be inhabitable by […]Read On »"
