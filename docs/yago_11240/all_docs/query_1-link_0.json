She also played Hua Li, Mulan's mother, in the live-action 2020 remake of Mulan. In 2024 she starred as Ye Wenjie in the Netflix production of 3 Body Problem.\n\nEarly life and education\n\n[edit]\n\nRosalind Chao was born in Los Angeles, California,[7] and raised in Anaheim. Her parents were performers with the Peking opera[8] before they relocated to Anaheim, where they ran a successful pancake restaurant, Chao's Chinese and American Restaurant, across the street from Disneyland. Chao worked there from an early age.[9][10]\n\nShe attended Pomona College in Claremont, California,[11] and then the University of Southern California, where she earned a degree in broadcast journalism in 1978.[11] She worked at Disneyland as an international tour guide,[12] and contemplated pursuing journalism as a career.[8]\n\nCareer\n\n[edit]\n\nChao's parents were instrumental in her decision to pursue acting.[13] She began acting at the age of five, in the California-based Peking opera traveling company with which her parents were involved. During the summer, they sent her to Taiwan for further acting study and experience.[14]\n\nAs a child, she played the daughter of a laundry owner (played by James Hong) on a 1970 episode of Here's Lucy, \"Lucy the Laundress\".[15]\n\nDeciding not to pursue acting, Chao enrolled in the communications department at the University of Southern California where she earned her degree in journalism. However, after a year as a radio newswriting intern at the CBS-owned Hollywood radio station KNX,[14] she returned to acting.[16][13]\n\nChao's breakthrough role was that of Soon-Lee, a South Korean refugee, in the final episodes of the TV series M*A*S*H.[16] Soon-Lee married longtime starring character Maxwell Klinger (Jamie Farr) in the series finale \"Goodbye, Farewell and Amen\",[17] which aired on February 28, 1983, and was the most-watched U.S. sitcom television episode of all time as of 2021. Chao repeated the role in the M*A*S*H sequel, 1983's AfterMASH, her first role billed at co-star status.[18]\n\nChao played Japanese exo-botanist Keiko O'Brien on the television series Star Trek: The Next Generation and Star Trek: Deep Space Nine. In 2010, a preliminary casting memo for The Next Generation from 1987 was published, revealing that Chao was originally considered for the part of Enterprise security chief Tasha Yar.[19]\n\nIn August 2018, Chao was cast as Mulan's mother in the 2020 live-action retelling of Mulan.[20][21] In 2019, she was invited to join the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences, citing her contributions to the critically acclaimed films The Joy Luck Club and I Am Sam.[22][23][24]\n\nPersonal life\n\n[edit]\n\nChao met her husband Simon Templeman while they were working in theatre at the Mark Taper Forum.[25] They have a son and a daughter.[25][26]\n\nFilmography\n\n[edit]\n\nFilm\n\n[edit]\n\nYear Film Role Notes 1980 The Big Brawl Mae 1981 Spider-Man: The Dragon's Challenge Emily Chan 1981 An Eye for an Eye Linda Chen 1983 Going Berserk Kung Fu Girl 1987 Slam Dance Mrs. Bell The Tribulations of a Chinese Gentleman Lianhua 1988 White Ghost Thi Hau 1990 Denial Terry Thousand Pieces of Gold Lalu Nathoy/Polly Bemis 1992 Memoirs of an Invisible Man Cathy DiTolla 1993 The Joy Luck Club Rose 1994 North Chinese Mom Love Affair Lee 1997 The End of Violence Claire 1998 What Dreams May Come Leona 2000 Enemies of Laughter Carla 2001 The Man from Elysian Fields Female Customer Impostor Newscaster Uncredited I Am Sam Lily 2003 Freaky Friday Pei-Pei 2005 Life of the Party Mei Lin Just like Heaven Fran 2007 Nanking Chang Yu Zheng 2009 The Rising Tide Narrator 2012 Knife Fight Kate - Focus Group Moderator 2015 Stockholm, Pennsylvania Dr. Andrews 2017 Tragedy Girls Mayor Campbell 2019 Plus One Angela The Laundromat Gu Kailai 2020 Mulan Hua Li Magic Camp Lorraine Uncredited 2021 Together Together Dr. Andrews The Starling Fawn 2024 Sacramento TBA Post-production 2025 Freakier Friday Pei-Pei Filming\n\nTelevision\n\n[edit]\n\nYear Film Role Notes 1970 Here's Lucy Linda Wong 1 episode[15] 1972 Anna and the King Princess Serana 1 episode 1973 Kung Fu Dancer 1 episode, uncredited 1976 ABC Afterschool Specials The Kurmese Ambassador's Daughter 1 episode 1977 The Hardy Boys/Nancy Drew Mysteries Lily Episode: \"The Secret of the Jade Kwan Yin\" Kojak Grace Chen Episode: \"The Summer of '69: Part 1\" 1978 The Incredible Hulk Receptionist Episode: \"Married\" 1979 How the West Was Won Li Sin Episode: \"China Girl\" The Ultimate Imposter Lai-Ping Television film Emergency!
