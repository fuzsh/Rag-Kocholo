S. Rind exhibits a natural exuberance as his latest figurative style reflects the faces and moods of the women of his homeland of Rahim Yar Khan. His ethnic long necked women are generally wide eyed, often with puckered lips and adorned gracefully with traditional ornaments.\n\nIn some of the paintings, the presence of parrot, fishes and rose with women creates an aura of romance and mystery. Occasionally Rind has also used Faiz Ahmad Faiz’s verses to enhance the romance and mystique of his paintings.\n\n“The rich traditional heritage of the artist’s soil reverberates in his paintings of stylized women, jewellery and design” said Noshi Qadir, the curator of the gallery.\n\nA. S. Rind’s latest work carries a strong cultural influence of his area, as his paintings are certainly and deeply influenced by the regional aesthetics, splendor, colors, and motifs. The use of the verses of Faiz is to emphasize the mood and expressions of the stylized women he paints. His paintings of this period are mostly either in acrylic or mix media.\n\nAccording to his own statement Rind has tried super realism, which continued till 1993, after wards he tried his hands hand at impressionism, cubism, and the abstract. In 1988, he worked on some Quaranic calligraphic paintings and introduced a new typeface.\n\nMusarrat Hassan, an art critic believes that “the sounds and smells and colors of his home town are forever hauntingly present in his subconscious. He has returned to them through the paintings in the present collection.” The jewelry and designs were gentle reminders that a son of the soil; has come back to announce his heritage and even though there has been an effort to stylize the figures and enhance the design element, the colors claim a distant relationship with the desert, he added. (Sana Jamal)\n\nThe man standing in the shade of the rubber trees with coins of sunshine dancing on his body, holding her daughter in his arms, glanced up and caught Ammu’s gaze. Centuries telescoped into one evanescent moment. History was wrong-footed, caught off guard. Sloughed off like an old snakeskin. Its marks, its scars, its wounds from old wars and the walking-backward days all fell away. In its absence it left an aura, a palpable shimmering that was as plain to feel as heat on a hot day, or the tug of a fish on a taut line. So obvious that no one noticed.\n\n…\n\nAs he walked away from the house, he felt his senses had been honed and heightened. As though everything around him had been flattened into a neat illustration. A machine drawing with an instruction manual that told him what to do. His mind, desperately craving some kind of mooring, clung to details. It labeled each thing it encountered.\n\n[…] The machine drawing began to blur. The clear lines to smudge. The instructions no longer made sense. The road rose to meet him and the darkness grew dense. Glutinous. Pushing through it became an effort. Like swimming underwater.\n\n…\n\nThe twins were too young to know that these were only history’s henchmen. Sent to square the books and collect the dues from those who broke its laws. Impelled by feelings that were primal yet paradoxically wholly impersonal. Feelings of contempt born of inchoate, unacknowledged fear – civilization’s fear of nature, men’s fear of women, power’s fear of powerlessness.\n\n[…] There was nothing accidental about what happened that morning. Nothing incidental. It was no stray mugging or personal settling of scores. This was an era imprinting itself on those who lived in it.\n\nHistory in live performance.\n\nIf they hurt Velutha more than they intended to, it was only because any kinship, any connection between themselves and him, any implication that if nothing else, at least biologically he was a fellow creature – had been severed long ago. They were not arresting a man, they were exorcising fear. They had no instrument to calibrate how much punishment he could take. No means of gauging how much or how permanently they had damaged him."
