        "text": "taimoor shahidThe Politics of Enchantment:<strong>Remapp<strong>in</strong>g</strong> <strong>the</strong> <strong>Precapital</strong> <strong>in</strong> <strong>Faiz</strong> <strong>Ahmad</strong><strong>Faiz</strong>’s <strong>Postcolonial</strong> <strong>Poetry</strong> *IIn this paper I exam<strong>in</strong>e <strong>the</strong> work of Faiẓ Aḥmad Faiẓ (1911–1984)óarguably<strong>the</strong> most famous Urdu poet of <strong>the</strong> second half of <strong>the</strong> twentieth centuryóand contend that unlike <strong>the</strong> common <strong>in</strong>terpretation of his poetry as anultimate work of a postcolonial nature, his work offers several o<strong>the</strong>r layersof mean<strong>in</strong>g and is far more complex than a parochial sociopolitical <strong>in</strong>terpretativelens allows us to see. His poetry is deeply rooted <strong>in</strong> its antecedentsof <strong>the</strong> Persio-Arabic, Indo-Persian, and Urdu literary traditions and emergesout of <strong>the</strong>se vary<strong>in</strong>g genealogies which are precapital/precolonial <strong>in</strong> nature.The stark presence of <strong>the</strong>se traditions <strong>in</strong> his oeuvre makes him muchmore than a mere ìrevolutionary poet,î an archetypical postcolonial mold<strong>in</strong> which he is often cast. This is common practice <strong>in</strong> much of <strong>the</strong> criticaldiscourse on modern (postcapital and postcolonial) South Asian literaturewhich employs methods that reduce <strong>the</strong> so-called ìthird-worldî literatureto a political program, namely, <strong>the</strong> unfold<strong>in</strong>g of a universal modernity <strong>in</strong> <strong>the</strong>world. However, <strong>in</strong> order to understand Faiẓís work, it is important to breakaway from <strong>the</strong>se parochial sociological and political labels that have becomesynonymous with his multivalent poetry, which defies such classifications.In undertak<strong>in</strong>g a project of this k<strong>in</strong>d one has to be cautious of <strong>the</strong>methodological pitfalls that await hermeneutical analysis of a highly contestedtext which exists <strong>in</strong> <strong>the</strong> popular and critical imag<strong>in</strong>ation by virtue ofnot merely its wide popularity and high aes<strong>the</strong>tic value, but also becauseof its authorís political subjectivity. How <strong>the</strong>n is a person to understand* I would like to thank <strong>the</strong> AUS editor, Professor Muhammad Umar Memon,for his critical comments. I would also like to thank my friends and colleaguesNasser Abourahme and Sohaib Ibrahim Khan for <strong>the</strong>ir <strong>in</strong>sightful suggestions.215"
