        "text": "In this section various writers will be asked to take a second look at poems they admire and discuss informally what they admire about the work.\n\nIssue 30: Yusef Komunyakaa\n\nA Second Look by Tina Barr\n\nI first began reading Yusef Komunyakaa’s poetry in about 1996, and this poem, originally published in Magic City, but subsequently in Pleasure Dome: New and Collected Poems, copyright 2004 (Wesleyan University Press), has haunted me for years.\n\nThe narrator is a five-year-old boy, and we easily imagine it is the voice of Komunyakaa himself, who grew up in Bogalusa, Louisiana. But the child narrator’s observations are superseded by its specific details, which are overlaid onto the child’s voice, and come from an adult awareness. The narrator announces himself in the first line, “I am five, / Wading out into deep / Sunny grass / Unmindful of snakes / & yellowjackets, out / To the yellow flowers / Quivering in the sluggish heat.” As with so many of Komunyakaa’s poems, there is a fusion of beauty and danger, which we call the sublime. The Venus’s flytraps are, indeed, flowers, but a particularly threatening kind, because their open sticky shells trap flies. This threat is compounded by the reference to “snakes,” and “yellowjackets,” about which the boy claims he is oblivious. And the flowers, which are vaginal in their shape, “quiver.” This is the first use of connotative language which brings us to the sexual. The narrator’s voice is colloquial, “Don’t mess with me / ‘Cause I have my Lone Ranger / Six-shooter. I can hurt / You with questions / Like silver bullets.” This reference to the television show that ran from 1949 to 1957 locates the reader within a specific period of time, well before the Civil Rights Act. A silver bullet is a solution to a difficult problem, but here those questions are a threat.\n\nAs Venus’s Flytraps continues, with its brief, “stepped” lines, revealing its secrets in increments, the poem states, “The tall flowers in my dreams are / Big as the First State Bank” and we understand how large this building would have appeared to a small boy, in likely a small town, and the flowers have “mouths like where / Babies come from. I am five.” For a small child to understand where “babies come from” suggests a precocious figure, but also, a boy who is aware of sexuality, either through observation or by overhearing references.\n\nThe poem shifts a few lines further on, when the young boy admits “I don’t supposed to be / This close to the tracks. / One afternoon I saw / What a train did to a cow. / Sometimes I stand so close / I can see the eyes / Of men hiding in boxcars. We are transported to a rural setting, also a time and place where men ride boxcars, and the railroad has always been an acute reference in African-American poetry, representing a way out, a way north, and we think of the “underground railroad,” the slaves’ paths north. As is typical for a child, he laughs “When trains make the dogs / Howl. Their ears hurt.” A child will laugh, when an adult has a different perspective. But the poem gradually creates its setting though the story of its imagery. The juxtaposition of the lush rural setting and the crushed cow, which must be a graphic and terrible image, is never enunciated. We imagine what the boy saw. As the poem progresses it continues to return to relations between men and women, “I wonder why Daddy / Calls Mama honey.” This section of the poem is focused on bees and their need for flowers, and how the bees “Live in little white houses / Except the ones in these flowers / All sticky and sweet inside.” Again, Komunyakaa’s poem works through images which convey meaning without “telling” the reader its intention, but by insinuation and circumnavigation. The juxtapositions between sex and death alternate. Any insects caught in the trap of the flowers must die, and the “sticky and sweet,” elicits a sexual reference in such an offhand way, the boy doesn’t know what he conveys in his depiction. But he wonders “what death tastes like.” This use of synesthesia compounds the elision of sweetness with smell (the smell of a dead cow) and the references back to literal honey, which he has tasted. Only a child would “toss the butterflies / Back into the air,” because while he is aware of death and even sexuality, he wouldn’t consider this play a way of killing butterflies. The poem is so dense that revelations follow hard one after the other.\n\nThe poem reflects an interiority that is in high contrast to the boy toying with the butterflies. He says he wishes he knew why “The music in my head / Makes me scared.” This sentence seems to present us, as readers, with an awareness, even then, of the speaker’s sensitivity and introspection, which is incongruent with the consciousness of a child, but the child feels intensely. And the poem appears to reveal the adult poet’s reflection, admitting the boy knows things “I don’t supposed to know.” He states “I could start walking / & never stop. / These yellow flowers / go on forever. / Almost to Detroit.” And in the other direction, “Almost to the sea.” Situated between the northern edge of his world, the city of Detroit, and the southern edge of Louisiana, where it meets the ocean, the child reveals a map of his world, a realm between South and North. Detroit was one of the final stops on the underground railroad. The interwoven imagery vacillates between perceptions of a wider world and the actutely personal. “My Mama says I’m a mistake. / That I made her a bad girl. / My playhouse is underneath / Our house, & I hear people / Telling each other secrets.”\n\nThe little boy is illegitimate, but doesn’t yet understand such implications, and he lives between one world, of childhood, and that of the adults who tell each other secrets. The doubling of the two “houses,” is the coda for this relentlessly truthful and devastatingly revealing poem. The boy sees with two levels of perception, that of a child and that of the future adult poet, who will create a poem of forceful, disturbing and relentless observation.\n\nVenus’s-Flytrapsby Yusef Komunyakaa\n\nI am five,\n\nWading out into deep\n\nSunny grass,\n\nUnmindful of snakes\n\n& yellowjackets, out\n\nTo the yellow flowers\n\nQuivering in sluggish heat.\n\nDon’t mess with me\n\n‘Cause I have my Lone Ranger\n\nSix-shooter.

Used by permission of Wesleyan University Press.\n\nIssue 29: Mosab Abu Toha\n\nA Second Look by Kathryn Levy\n\nLeaving Childhood Behind\n\nWhen I left, I left my childhood in the drawer\n\nand on the kitchen table. I left my toy horse\n\nin its plastic bag.\n\nI left without looking at the clock.\n\nI forget whether it was noon or evening.\n\nOur horse spent the night alone,\n\nno water, no grains for dinner.\n\nIt must have thought we’d left to cook a meal\n\nfor late guests or to make a cake\n\nfor my sister’s tenth birthday.\n\nI walked with my sister, down our road with no end.\n\nWe sang a birthday song.\n\nThe warplanes echoed across the heavens.\n\nMy tired parents walked behind,\n\nmy father clutching to his chest\n\nthe keys to our house and to the stable.\n\nWe arrived at a rescue station.\n\nNews of the airstrikes roared on the radio.\n\nI hated death, but I hated life, too,\n\nwhen we had to walk to our drawn-out death,\n\nreciting our never-ending ode.\n\nThe experience of perpetual loss and exile has been at the heart of Palestinian poetry for the past 75 years. In his resonant first book, Things You May Find Hidden in My Ear, Gazan poet Mosab Abu Toha delves into the disorienting reality of being exiled, not just from a country, but from essential aspects of the self, even from any hope for a future.\n\nNowhere is that exile more acute than in its effect on children. In this quiet and yet devastating poem, “Leaving Childhood Behind,” Abu Toha charts the loss of childhood itself, the time we like to think of as realm of innocence and boundless imagination.\n\nAlthough written in the first person, “Leaving Childhood Behind” necessarily works on many levels, embodying the point of view of the child and the point of view of the adult remembering the child. It begins with a family fleeing from their home—there is the concrete detail of the boy’s toy horse left in its plastic bag, but also the vivid imagination the boy brings to that toy, contemplating its hunger and loneliness.\n\nBut this world of toys and fantasy is shadowed by inescapable facts. The boy and his sister sing a “birthday song,” even as family walks down “our road with no end” and the warplanes echo “across the heavens.” Of course this isn’t the vocabulary of a child but of the adult poet/witness who must live in the past, present, and future.\n\nAbu Toha seamlessly negotiates that time travel, bringing us back from the elevated language of the warplanes echoing across the heavens to the quotidian details of the exhausted family trudging down the road, the father clutching the keys to their house, and a deserted stable, no longer simply a world of toys.\n\nBut where is the family going? That is the question answered by the stunning last stanza, with its wide tonal range, beginning with the quiet first line, “We arrived at a rescue station,” which can’t truly be a place of rescue. Even in the place of supposed shelter there is the roar of the airstrikes on the radio and the overarching question of how to keep living in the face of constant destruction.\n\nThe stark line “I hated death, but I hated life, too,” represents a dramatic shift in language, in response to a desperate reality—the boy and the poet caught in the vise of history and perpetual flight. And yet, as frequently happens in Abu Toha’s work, that harsh world also has a lyric beauty. The family is walking to their “drawn-out death,” but as they do they recite their “never-ending ode.”\n\nThat “never-ending ode” does not represent redemption but a complex territory in which beauty and terror are inextricable. In this haunting work Abu Toha brings to life the refugee’s incessant longing and the poet’s inexhaustible search for the true language of his journey, a journey of one child and far too many children still struggling down that ashen road. Although “Leaving Childhood Behind” was published in 2022, sadly this poem of forced displacement and devastated childhood is now more relevant than ever.\n\nIssue 28: Leslie Norris\n\nA Second Look by Jon D. Lee\n\nHudson’s Geese\n\n“. . . I have, from time to time,\n\nrelated some incident of my boyhood,\n\nand these are contained in various\n\nchapters in The Naturalist in La\n\nPlata, Birds and Man, Adventures\n\namong Birds . . . .”\n\n—W. H. Hudson, in Far Away And Long Ago\n\nHudson tells us of them,\n\nthe two migrating geese,\n\nshe hurt in the wing\n\nindomitably walking\n\nthe length of a continent,\n\nand he circling above\n\ncalling his distress.\n\nThey could not have lived.\n\nAlready I see her wing\n\nscraped past the bone\n\nas she drags it through rubble.\n\nA fox, maybe, took her\n\nin his snap jaws. And what\n\nwould he do, the point of his wheeling gone?\n\nThe wilderness of his cry\n\nfalling through an air\n\nturned instantly to winter\n\nwould warn the guns of him.\n\nIf a fowler dropped him,\n\nlet it have been quick,\n\npellets hitting brain\n\nand heart so his weight\n\ncame down senseless,\n\nand nothing but his body\n\nto enter the dog’s mouth.\n\n—Leslie Norris\n\nOne of the greater challenges a poet can face is the love poem. The potential for clichés, overly precious phrasing, and abstractions is perhaps larger here than in any other type of poem, which is why a common exercise for beginning poets is to write a love poem without using the word “love.” One way to deal with this potential is to accept and play on the abstractions and clichés, as in the opening to Marvin Bell’s “To Dorothy”: “You are not beautiful, exactly. / You are beautiful, inexactly.” Another, used here in unparalleled excellence by the late Welsh poet Leslie Norris, is to employ metaphor—or, to be more precise, a poetic conceit—and allow the emotions a place in a separate set of images that allow the poem freedom to move in new and interesting directions while still developing a central theme.\n\nMetaphor is of course not new to poetry, but its successful application is one of the markers of the masters. It is impossible to carefully read e. e. cumming’s “She being Brand” without realizing that the poem is actually about sex (and not cars, as the poem suggests on its surface); equally, Elizabeth Bishop’s elegantly humble “The Fish” is obviously about much more than fishing. And so “Hudson’s Geese” is clearly a love poem without ever needing to say so. (And, having had the privilege of hearing Norris read this poem before his death at age 84 in 2006, it was impossible for the audience to not realize this was a poem about his wife of several decades.)\n\nThe poem admittedly assumes the reader is aware that geese mate for life, but even without that knowledge the emotions are profound: the migrating female unable to fly, the male unable to leave her, and the possibility of loss too weighty to allow a solitary existence. Recalling the tale of Philemon and Baucis from Ovid’s Metamorphoses—an elderly married couple who, as a reward for their honorability, were granted a wish by the gods and chose only to die together so one would not have to live without the other—the poem’s speaker can only imagine that the death of both geese would be better than the death of just one.\n\nDespite such a sophisticated conceit, much of the power in this poem comes from its elegant simplicity and plainness of language: only the word “indomitably” sticks out as weighty among what are largely monosyllables, as if to emphasize the monumental nature of the task, and the sheer brevity of the line/sentence “They could not have lived” is breath-stopping in its directness. Yet there is simultaneously an obvious control, each line tight in length save for “would he do, the point of his wheeling gone?” which juts out as if the poem could not contain its power, as if nothing will be the same after. So too the multiple connotations obviously intended in words such as “winter” and “heart,” the former referencing not only the cold season but also death and sorrow, and the latter describing the literal organ but clearly chosen for that organ’s association with love.\n\nIn the end, however, it is the image that centers the poem and makes the conceit successful: the geese, the rifle, the body in the dog’s mouth. These are made the more powerful by the near-complete avoidance of abstract nouns in favor of concrete ones, with multiple lines furthermore ending in image: geese, wing, bone, rubble, brain, body, mouth. So clear and precise are these images that the poem does not need to unravel or explain the metaphor—does not need to yell out how it is a love poem from husband to wife. It trusts itself to be so obvious, and us to understand on our own.\n\nHere’s a link to Norris reading from his work.\n\nIssue 27: Faiz Ahmed Faiz\n\nA Second Look by Shadab Zeest Hashmi\n\nWalk the Market in Shackles Today\n\nNot enough the eye\n\nwelling up—\n\nThe squall inside.\n\nNot enough to bear blame—\n\nLove hidden away.\n\nWalk the market in shackles today\n\nWalk wild\n\nbrandishing hands,\n\nwalk crazed, go frolic!\n\nGo with dust-laden head, bloodied shirt\n\nThe city of the beloved aches for a glimpse— go!\n\nThe king, the crowd of commoners too\n\nThe arrow of accusation, the stone of abuse too\n\nThe morning of sorrow, day of failure too\n\nWho lives side by side with these, but I?\n\nWho, in the city of the beloved, is pure of heart anymore?\n\nWho, left worthy of the executioner’s hand anymore?\n\nReady yourself for the journey of the heart, wounded ones, let’s go.\n\nLet us go, friends, let us then go\n\nto our beheading.\n\n—Faiz Ahmed Faiz, Translated from the Urdu by Shadab Zeest Hashmi\n\nOne of Faiz Ahmed Faiz’s most popular lyric poems, “Walk the Market in Shackles Today” celebrates the spirit of speaking truth to power, no matter the price. Faiz combines the classical Urdu trope of the beloved—embracing all manner of travail for love’s sake—to frame the struggle of common people. In employing a highbrow metaphor to convey what may appear to be lowbrow concerns, Faiz breathed a new life into the traditional metaphor itself. Thanks to Faiz, the notion of the “beloved” moved beyond the romantic and mystical and came to symbolize revolution in the modern sense of the word.\n\nThe story behind the composition of this poem is as remarkable as the poem itself. Following one of Faiz’s many arrests for political dissent, he was being taken to jail when the police car broke down and stalled. The poet—handcuffed—was transferred to a tonga, a horse-drawn carriage, a plebian mode of transportation in which the passenger faces the street, sitting with his back to the tonga-driver. Faiz, the “people’s poet,” taking in the quotidian sights and sounds he cared about so deeply, felt as if he himself was part of the scene, and on display. This sense of being inadvertently “staged” in handcuffs as the tonga rode through the streets—a spectacle among the scenes of “shahr e janan” (“the city of the beloved”)—becomes the poem’s primary lyric gesture.\n\nThis poem champions the spirit of struggle which not only rises above the indignity of punishment but shines as a consequence. “Aaj Bazaar Mein” has become a sort of anthem for social change over the decades, sung in protest rallies as a slogan against oppressive systems of power. “Not enough to bear blame—Love hidden away/ Walk the market in shackles today;” the poem not only embodies a declaration against the silencing perpetrated by the establishment but also against self-censorship. Faiz glorifies the revolutionary spirit, which, despite a looming sense of fatalism, takes pride in fighting against injustice, remaining forever faithful to the beloved—the domain of the dispossessed.\n\nIssue 26: Jean Valentine\n\nhttp://www.jeanvalentine.com/poemaudio/02september1963.mp3\n\nA Second Look by Deborah Bogen\n\nMy Political Poet — Jean Valentine\n\nHere’s a small poem, no, here’s a large poem, well, here’s a Valentine poem.\n\nSeptember 1963\n\nWe’ve been at home four years, in a kind of peace,\n\nA kind of kingdom: brushing our yellow hair\n\nAt the tower’s small window,\n\nPlaying hop-scotch on the grass.\n\nWith twenty other Gullivers\n\nI hover at the door.\n\nWatch you shy through this riddle of primary colors,\n\nThe howling razzle-dazzle of your peers.\n\nTears, stay with me, stay with me, tears.\n\nDearest, go: this is what\n\nSchool is, what the world is.\n\nHave I sewed my hand to yours?\n\nFive minutes later in the eye of God\n\nYou and Kate and Jeremy are dancing.\n\nGlad, derelict, I find a park bench, read\n\nBirmingham, Birmingham, Birmingham.\n\nWhite tears on the white ground.\n\nWhite world going on, white hand in hand,\n\nWorld without end.\n\nValentine opens with an image of a small paradise: “four years, in a kind of peace/a kind of kingdom: brushing our yellow hair.” This kingdom of the young family will be recognizable to many. Baby-rearing, while tiring, can be a wonderful break from the larger world’s problems. When the baby cries someone needs to pick it up. The small world of the family feels like a whole world, where children can be kept safe and parents are the absolute authority. So, this first bit is easy to get – then Valentine shifts to the first day of nursery school, a bevy of uncertain parents dropping off their treasured offspring. Expected tears are followed by a less expected picture of the children dancing. A small but perfect description of everything going right. Perhaps the kingdom of home and heaven can be extended to include this school.\n\nBut all heavens have parameters, and Valentine is the master of the sudden shift that smacks us upside the head with the boundary of this paradise. The lucky “derelict” mom, having finally found the time, sits on a park bench to read the paper. And there it is: “Birmingham. Birmingham. Birmingham.” We are faced not with the world of Valentine’s lucky child, her safe child. This is the world of Addie Mae Collins, Denise McNair, Carole Robertson and Cynthia Wesley, the girls who died when Ku Klux Klan members planted dynamite inside the 16th Street Baptist Church. The reading mother suffers a palpable shock. And the poet Valentine refuses to see this as just another “news item.” She doesn’t flinch and she doesn’t pull her punch. Reading the three devastating last lines the reader feels suddenly complicit:\n\nWhite tears on the white ground.\n\nWhite world going on, white hand in hand,\n\nWorld without end.\n\nThere’s so much craft in the way the poet creates this moment. Take a look at the syllable count in these lines. 15 one syllable words. (Valentine’s use of single syllable words could be the subject of a long class.) With these sharp short words she creates a rat-a-tat-tat, tapping the damning words into our skulls.\n\nFinally, Valentine’s use of the Gloria Patri reference as the closer, and her decision to deprive us of the “amen” that normally follows “world without end,” is a brilliant blasphemy. How dare we think that the world as it stands is a good thing? How dare we praise this world where the golden-haired darlings are dancing “in the eye of God” while Addie and Denise and Carole and Cynthia lie dead in the rubble.\n\nIssue 25: Motown Crown by Patrica Smith\n\nA Second Look by Alison Stone\n\nI am in awe of Patricia’s Smith’s “Motown Crown.” Often poets who write in traditional forms lose the natural-feeling language of free verse. Sometimes it seems to be a choice between from-the-gut emotion and craft. This jeweled sonnet crown flawlessly executes a difficult form while also speaking to the body and heart of the reader. And it addresses the complex relationship young women often have with music made by men.\n\nFrom MOTOWN CROWN\n\nThe Temps, all swerve and pivot, conjured schemes\n\nthat had us skipping school, made us forget\n\nhow mamas schooled us hard against the threat\n\nof five-part harmony and sharkskin seams.\n\nWe spent our schooldays balanced on the beams\n\nof moon we wished upon, the needled jetblack\n\n45s that spun and hadn’t yet\n\nbecome the dizzy spinning of our dreams.\n\nSugar Pie, Honey Bun, oh you\n\nloved our nappy hair and rusty knees.\n\nMarvin Gaye slowed down while we gave chase\n\nand then he was our smokin’ fine taboo.\n\nWe hungered for the anguished screech of Please\n\ninside our chests—relentless, booming bass.\n\nWhen reading contemporary poems in form, I ask myself, Do these seem like the best words to express what the writer is trying to say, or were they forced into a rhyme scheme? The words in this poem would have been ideal even if the poem had been free verse. In addition, the strict rhyme scheme of the traditional sonnet form, along with the repetition of a crown, mimic the structure of the Motown songs Smith writes about. Form and content blend seamlessly.\n\nAnother strength of Motown Crown is its ability to capture a particular speaker in a particular time period, while reaching across all those details into universality. The speaker is a Black girl listening to Motown; the longing and insecurity of adolescence and the erotic charge of music are equally applicable to girls of any race listening to any genre. While teen boys have a similar connection to music, until recently, dreams were channeled into very different paths. Boys were supposed to yearn to be the men performing, girls, to date them.\n\nWhile a series of linking sonnets is challenging enough, Smith goes the extra mile by making this a jeweled crown, adding a fifteenth sonnet made from the first lines of the previous fourteen. Smith’s skill is obvious by how natural and unforced this last sonnet seems as it sums up and brings home what came before.\n\nThe Temps, all swirl and pivot, conjured schemes\n\ninside our chests, relentless booming bass\n\nthen silk where throats should be. Much growling grace\n\nfrom open window, ’neath the door, pipe dreams—\n\nthat soul beneath the vinyl. The Supremes\n\nused to stockpile extra sequins just in case\n\nDiana’s Negro hips required more space,\n\nwhile Smokey penned a lyric dripping cream.\n\nAsk any colored girl, and she will moan,\n\nremembering how love had lied so loud.\n\nI whimpered while the downbeat dangled bait\n\nand taught myself to slow drag, all alone.\n\nLess than perfect love was not allowed\n\nand every song they sang told me to wait.\n\nMotown Crown is a career highlight for Smith and hopefully will convince other poets that formal verse can have as much Duende and straightforwardness as free verse. She may never have gotten to date a Motown star, but her music rivals theirs.\n\nIssue 24: Stephen Dunn\n\nPoet Stephen Dunn died on June 24, on his 82nd birthday.\n\nStephen Dunn’s poem “Impediment” from Whereas\n\nImpediment\n\nThe loneliness thing is overdone.\n\n— Edward Hopper, about responses to his work\n\nExcept for shoes\n\nthe young woman is naked,\n\nin a chair, looking out\n\na fully-opened window,\n\nher face obscured\n\nby dark brown hair.\n\nApartment? Hotel?\n\nOutside, the obdurate gloom\n\nof city buildings.\n\nIt’s 11 A.M.\n\nHopper’s title says,\n\ntime for her to have dressed\n\na hundred times.\n\nIt’s the shoes which hint\n\nof her desire to dress,\n\nand of some great impediment.\n\nElbows on knees. Hands clasped.\n\nThe window she’s leaning toward\n\nis curtainless.\n\nThere’s no sense she cares\n\nshe might be seen, or\n\nthat she wishes to show herself.\n\nA Second Look by Deborah Bogen\n\nStephen Dunn’s quietly assertive voice is easy to recognize in “Impediment.” The simple phrasing, a sort of plain speech, is at work in many of Dunn’s poems and the payoff for the poet is that we are not put-off. He’s a calm man giving us his thoughts. He does not seem scary. Or offensive. Or overly dramatic. He’s a thoughtful man we’d enjoy having at our dinner table, and he’s thinking about the human experience in way we feel we should all think of it.\n\nDunn’s underlying angst about how human beings live with each other, the ways we connect or fail to connect, befriend or betray, become salient to anyone spending time with his many books of poems. As Joel Brouwer said in a New York Times review of Dunn’s What Goes On, “the speaker of Dunn’s recent poems is a regular guy cursed with an understanding of human nature more subtle than he’d prefer.” Dunn has written poems with titles like “Kindness, “Loneliness,” and “Happiness,” as well as poems titled “Honesty,” “A Secret Life,” and “What They Wanted.”\n\nIn this poem, “Impediment,” Dunn makes use of Hopper’s famous painting, “Eleven A.M.” to think and talk about the difficulties that can arise as we try to know and understand each other. He describes the painting as if he’s translating Hopper’s subject, his shapes and colors, into Dunn’s native form of expression: words. The woman, he tells us, is naked “except for shoes.” Her face is “obscured/ by dark brown hair.” He sees her as “looking out” a fully opened window,” although I see her staring without seeing. Dunn describes the scene: “Outside the obdurate gloom of city buildings.” I’d argue “gloom” is too strong. There’s a lot of light both outside and in.\n\nAnd this is where the two art forms diverge. In the word-framed interpretation a position (looking? staring?) is taken. The painting doesn’t do that. It simply presents the scene, refusing to elaborate. I might stretch that analysis further — claiming the poem takes a didactic position, Dunn describing what he believes we should see. Hopper provides an image that may suggest a number of scenarios to viewers.\n\nBut the one thing Dunn is reaching for in this poem, the thing I think he most wants us to see, is the woman’s apparent indifference to the rest of the world. Everything he’s written leads up to “There’s no sense she cares/she might be seen, or/that she wishes to show herself.” This closing line is a quiet, simple statement. But its meaning is potentially powerful, and Dunn’s take on this aspect of painting seems exactly right. The solemnity (is there a weariness?) expressed in her solitude, her oddly incomplete nakedness, even her stillness, suggests she is, for whatever reason, beyond caring about the norms we usually live within.\n\nHopper’s painting hints at a compelling but missing backstory, and that’s what I think captured Dunn’s attention. Dunn’s own work often focuses on something that has gone right or more often gone wrong between people, giving us the sense that relationships are rife with unspoken backstories. In Hopper’s “Eleven A.M.” there is a sense that something has happened to this woman. Although no other person is depicted, it’s hard not to feel that someone else must have been involved in whatever brought her to sit in this chair, in this room, unclothed but unconcerned with her nakedness. She could be viewed as stranded and lonely, but taking my cue from Hopper, I think she might be experiencing a certain kind of freedom the kind that can visit us at difficult and even desperate moments, when what is usual, acceptable and normal is exposed as artifice. As window-dressing — which Dunn’s poem reminds us is not present in Hopper’s painting.\n\nIssue 23: City That Does Not Sleep\n\n(Night Song of Brooklyn Bridge)\n\nIn the sky there is nobody asleep. Nobody, nobody.\n\nNobody is asleep.\n\nThe creatures of the moon sniff and prowl about their cabins.\n\nThe living iguanas will come and bite the men who do not dream,\n\nand the man who rushes out with his spirit broken will meet on the street corner\n\nthe unbelievable alligator quiet beneath the tender protest of the stars.\n\nNobody is asleep on earth.

Fellow poets familiar with his oeuvre understand that Federico Garcia Lorca is one of the greatest, or perhaps the greatest Spanish poet, even surpassing the venerable Luis De Gongora himself. Lorca, a poet of vision and anguish, was able to foresee the predicament and complexity and fragility of our cities represented by the City of New York: its inhuman geometry, its flood of human frustrations and desires, and its logic of profit and exploitation of the natural world. From The Great Depression to the 9/11 attacks and to the horrors of our current Covid-19 crisis, nothing is more clear.\n\nFederico Garcia Lorca was born in Fuente Vaqueros, a small town west of Granada. A member of the Generation of 27, a group of poets associated with surrealism and the avant-garde, committed to Spain’s renewal by breaking with the past.\n\nNo piece is more apt and honest with what he experienced and saw in that metropolis during The Great Depression. The scale of human suffering being played out. Federico Garcia Lorca’s haunting poem (like T.S. Eliot’s, The Wasteland) remains as a totem, a talisman, a beacon and lens to man’s impulse of destruction.\n\n“Life is not a dream. Careful! Careful! Careful!”\n\nThe Duende, that playful trickster, summoned from the depths—and you can hear it in the ambulance sirens, in every weeping household visited by Death, as summer exists only in memory, as danger is ever-present, as funerals do day and night—\n\n“One day\n\nthe horses will live in the saloons\n\nand the enraged ants\n\nwill throw themselves on the yellow skies that take refuge in the eyes of cows.”\n\nFederico Garcia Lorca was murdered by Franco’s fascists in 1936. Until now no one knows where he was buried.\n\n“No one is sleeping.\n\nBut if someone grows too much moss on his temples during the night,\n\nopen the stage trapdoors so he can see in the moonlight\n\nthe lying goblets, and the poison, and the skull of the theaters.”\n\nOften I read Federico Garcia Lorca’s City That Does Not Sleep before going to bed at night. A perfect substitute for prayers. When reciting the poem I hear his voice in the swinging pendulum of the clock and in the creaking wood. I always feel him staring from the grave—I cover my mouth so my eyes see clearly in his dark.\n\nIssue 22: Parable by Louise Gluck\n\nParable\n\nFirst divesting ourselves of worldly goods, as St. Francis teaches,\n\nin order that our souls not be distracted\n\nby gain and loss, and in order also\n\nthat our bodies be free to move\n\neasily at the mountain passes, we had then to discuss\n\nwhither or where we might travel, with the second question being\n\nshould we have a purpose, against which\n\nmany of us argued fiercely that such purpose\n\ncorresponded to worldly goods, meaning a limitation or constriction,\n\nwhereas others said it was by this word we were consecrated\n\npilgrims rather than wanderers: in our minds, the word translated as\n\na dream, a something-sought, so that by concentrating we might see it\n\nglimmering among the stones, and not\n\npass blindly by; each\n\nfurther issue we debated equally fully, the arguments going back and forth,\n\nso that we grew, some said, less flexible and more resigned,\n\nlike soldiers in a useless war. And snow fell upon us, and wind blew,\n\nwhich in time abated — where the snow had been, many flowers appeared,\n\nand where the stars had shone, the sun rose over the tree line\n\nso that we had shadows again; many times this happened.\n\nAlso rain, also flooding sometimes, also avalanches, in which\n\nsome of us were lost, and periodically we would seem\n\nto have achieved an agreement; our canteens\n\nhoisted upon our shoulders, but always that moment passed, so\n\n(after many years) we were still at that first stage, still\n\npreparing to begin a journey, but we were changed nevertheless;\n\nwe could see this in one another; we had changed although\n\nwe never moved, and one said, ah, behold how we have aged, traveling\n\nfrom day to night only, neither forward nor sideward, and this seemed\n\nin a strange way miraculous. And those who believed we should have a purpose\n\nbelieved this was the purpose, and those who felt we must remain free\n\nin order to encounter truth, felt it had been revealed.\n\nA Second Look by Thylias Moss\n\nWinner of the 2020 Nobel Prize in Literature, Louise Glück’s “Parable” strikes me as a poem for all of us to read and memorize, this shedding of worldly pursuits in favor of something more lasting, a lightness of being so that we can almost literally float, and see more above it all: the destruction, torments, and desecrations we impose on each other and on the planet itself, as if the whole thing, even space itself in which our orb sits as vulnerable as any other space object, of a world so close to the paradisiacal, as if it all can just regenerate itself, this arm of star galaxy, a milky way, not lactating with health but loss of its milk of life, magnesium, —Humans once had Eden or its close approximation, an earth full of what everyone needed, possible to live off the land that now is under extreme desecration and annihilation, greed above all, as in my early report cards, a grade for “works and plays well with others” countries of Earth have earned Grade F for failure, as we are as divided as we have ever been, politics and ideologies abound, earth has been milked, exploited, fleeced, sucked dry, deforested, natural resources depleted; we have not paid enough attention to purpose of all, and an obvious interdependence, essential contributions of everything, even storms can clear the air, at least temporarily. obviously, sincere possibilities are in order, as there need to be healings of suffering pockets of the world, purifying our spaces with a return to purpose; it is still possible, overlooking stunning consequences of every reaction, this indeed our parable, consequences of everything done; still preparing for journey back to purpose, but we have lost the way, misunderstanding that all was made with purpose, and eradication is not always best solution. Relearning how all parts of mosaic of existence fit together each part offering something special and good for the larger health system of the plane. We are killing the killer whales. Chinook salmon was so plentiful, possible to cross Elwha River by walking on their backs, never getting your feet wet.

The term Negritude, first deployed by Aimé Césaire in his poem, captures the revolutionary attempt to criticize and deconstruct French policy of Assimilation that trapped Africans in the web of French colonialism. Black poets and writers like Leopold Senghor, David Diop, Birago Diop, staged a Black Renaissance, replicating the Harlem Renaissance that celebrated African American artists and writers in the 1920s. Under the banner of Negritude movement, Senghor and others critically wrote against white supremacy, the disappearing light of their homeland, and the overwhelming discrimination against black people. They celebrated their blackness, their ideologies, their dreams, and everything that signifies hope for African people. Notable among those who enjoyed the educational opportunities in France, Senghor defied all odds to paint in his poems the traumatic images of black people, enslaved and tortured, mentally and physically. The colonial abuse and experiences reflect in his poems and others who catalyzed the movement.\n\nIn Senghor’s poetry, the spirit of patriotism to homeland is germane. Growing up in Iseyin, his poem titled “I Will Pronounce Your Name, Naett” became a chant in the four walls of my classroom. In the poem, Senghor presents Naett as a symbolic representation of Africa. The African aesthetics manifests in his adornment of Naett, through indelible imageries and instances of glorification.\n\nApart from his commitment to celebrating Africa, Senghor’s involvement in war is documented in his poems. During German Invasion of France, he was captured as a prisoner of war. He spent two years in German camps. He had firsthand experiences of how black soldiers were offered as sacrificial lambs at the warfront. In “To The Senegalese Riflemen Who Died for France,” he chronicles the deaths of Senegalese Sharpshooters during World War 1. These riflemen were not honored, immortalized, in spite of their sacrifices to France. These tragic experiences culminated in the birth of this poem and others that were written solely to convey the grimness of war and the losses of the African soldiers during war. In the poem, Senghor recounts the war by projecting the casualties of war, the forgotten ones, the ones rendered eternally silent by massacre. The difference between this poem and other war poems is not far-fetched; however, the injustice melted on African soldiers seems to be a focal point for Senghor. The violence of war becomes acutely disturbing, as the victims of war, their loved ones and families, remain anonymous, deprived of remembrance. This poem reminds me of J.P. Clark’s “The Casualties”. The casualties of war are always unnumbered, because there are more to every war than figures. Immortalizing the Senegalese Rifflemen and criticizing the mass murder and erasure that befell them, Senghor, in stanza one, writes:\n\n“I hear the sound of cannon—is it from Irun?\n\nThey put flowers on tombs and warm the Unknown Soldier.\n\nYou my dark brothers, no one appoints you.\n\nFive hundred thousand of your children are promised glory\n\nof the future deaths, they thank them in advance, future\n\ndark dead.”\n\nIn this excerpt, Senghor depicts the macabre images of war. Before the war, people hung themselves, after hearing that they were going to war. After the war, “dark brothers”—the Black Soldiers— were denied of honor, despite their sacrifice at the warfront. France refused to claim responsibility of the massacre that put the Senegalese Sharpshooters on the line of death. In the last lines, the children of war-victims are not spared from the future occurrences of death. The word “Die Schwarze Schande!” is symbolic—a discriminatory and demeaning phrase that denotes the withdrawal of black troops from the Rhineland. In another stanza, Senghor writes:\n\n“Listen to me, Senegalese Riflemen, in the solitude of\n\nblack earth and death\n\nIn your solitude without eyes without ears, more than\n\nI in my dark skin at the depths of the Province,\n\nWithout even the warmth of your comrades lying close to\n\nyou, as in the trenches in\n\nthe village palavers long ago,\n\nListen to me, black skin Riflemen, well without\n\nears and eyes in your threefold chamber\n\nat night.\n\nWe have not borrowed mourners, nor\n\ntears from your former wives\n\n—They only remember your\n\nfury and prefer the stench of the living.”\n\nIn this stanza, Senghor furthers in his invocation of the grief-stricken memories of the black soldiers. The dead Senegalese Riflemen are brought into limelight, celebrated and glorified by the poet persona. Their struggles are proclaimed, acknowledged, and honored, albeit through this poem and others written posthumously. The imperative use of “Listen” shows the poet persona addressing them—the dead soldiers. Even when they neither see nor hear the words of the poet persona, their memories remain inerasable. Also, the last four lines in this stanza hint at the loyalty of the Africans to the plights of the dead black soldiers. Mourning them, remains unforced. They died heroically, and they were mourned, by their country people. In the remaining verses in the poem, Senghor devotes his time to paying homage and offering his respect to these soldiers who were brutally wiped, their wives left as widows, their children as fatherless. Similar to every war poem, “The Dining Table” by Gbanabom Hallowell narrates the haunting experiences of the people during a war in Sierra Leone. In the final lines in the poem, Senghor venerates the soldiers and offers them a comradeship salute.\n\nIssue 19: Daddy\n\nDaddy\n\nSylvia Plath\n\nYou do not do, you do not do\n\nAny more, black shoe\n\nIn which I have lived like a foot\n\nFor thirty years, poor and white,\n\nBarely daring to breathe or Achoo.\n\nDaddy, I have had to kill you.\n\nYou died before I had time—\n\nMarble-heavy, a bag full of God,\n\nGhastly statue with one gray toe\n\nBig as a Frisco seal\n\nAnd a head in the freakish Atlantic\n\nWhere it pours bean green over blue\n\nIn the waters off beautiful Nauset.\n\nI used to pray to recover you.\n\nAch, du.\n\nIn the German tongue, in the Polish town\n\nScraped flat by the roller\n\nOf wars, wars, wars.\n\nBut the name of the town is common.\n\nMy Polack friend\n\nSays there are a dozen or two.\n\nSo I never could tell where you\n\nPut your foot, your root,\n\nI never could talk to you.\n\nThe tongue stuck in my jaw.\n\nIt stuck in a barb wire snare.\n\nIch, ich, ich, ich,\n\nI could hardly speak.\n\nI thought every German was you.\n\nAnd the language obscene\n\nAn engine, an engine\n\nChuffing me off like a Jew.\n\nA Jew to Dachau, Auschwitz, Belsen.\n\nI began to talk like a Jew.\n\nI think I may well be a Jew.\n\nThe snows of the Tyrol, the clear beer of Vienna\n\nAre not very pure or true.\n\nWith my gipsy ancestress and my weird luck\n\nAnd my Taroc pack and my Taroc pack\n\nI may be a bit of a Jew.\n\nI have always been scared of you,\n\nWith your Luftwaffe, your gobbledygoo.\n\nAnd your neat mustache\n\nAnd your Aryan eye, bright blue.\n\nPanzer-man, panzer-man, O You—\n\nNot God but a swastika\n\nSo black no sky could squeak through.\n\nEvery woman adores a Fascist,\n\nThe boot in the face, the brute\n\nBrute heart of a brute like you.\n\nYou stand at the blackboard, daddy,\n\nIn the picture I have of you,\n\nA cleft in your chin instead of your foot\n\nBut no less a devil for that, no not\n\nAny less the black man who\n\nBit my pretty red heart in two.\n\nI was ten when they buried you.\n\nAt twenty I tried to die\n\nAnd get back, back, back to you.\n\nI thought even the bones would do.\n\nBut they pulled me out of the sack,\n\nAnd they stuck me together with glue.\n\nAnd then I knew what to do.\n\nI made a model of you,\n\nA man in black with a Meinkampf look\n\nAnd a love of the rack and the screw.\n\nAnd I said I do, I do.\n\nSo daddy, I’m finally through.\n\nThe black telephone’s off at the root,\n\nThe voices just can’t worm through.\n\nIf I’ve killed one man, I’ve killed two—\n\nThe vampire who said he was you\n\nAnd drank my blood for a year,\n\nSeven years, if you want to know.\n\nDaddy, you can lie back now.\n\nThere’s a stake in your fat black heart\n\nAnd the villagers never liked you.\n\nThey are dancing and stamping on you.\n\nThey always knew it was you.\n\nDaddy, daddy, you bastard, I’m through.\n\nA Second Look by Natalie Patterson\n\nWritten not long before her death and published posthumously in Ariel, Sylvia Plath’s “Daddy” is a quintessential example of confessional poetry and Plath’s dextrous treatment of the personal. It is a poem that consistently resurfaces in discussions of poetry by women as well as a classic of the previous century that remains in our collective consciousness. The tone is complex, the rhyme entrancing, the words at home on the tongue. Unable to speak directly to her dead father, she must speak to him in a poem, killing him again—how achingly appropriate, how poetically perfect.\n\nPlath is known for her brash and grotesquely beautiful (or perhaps beautifully grotesque) treatment of mental illness, womanhood, motherhood, and other subjects that would have made many critics and readers flinch during the first half of the twentieth century. It’s obvious why we love this poem: it’s inventive and personal, evocative and uniquely confessional. Her use of the “I” pronoun is bold and genuine, guiding her intensely honest, ostensibly taboo subjects—she addresses her father and the hurt he wrought on her, the “vampire” (and not the only one, as Plath arguably alludes to her husband as well) who fed on her, who wore her down: “If I’ve killed one man, I’ve killed two— / The vampire who said he was you / And drank my blood for a year….”\n\nPlath’s revelation of the personal within the confines of the poem’s structure, form, and use of metaphor make it a poetic triumph in and of itself. Indeed, a critic might explore the technical successes of the poem’s form and symbolism and proclaim it close to perfect: the multiplicity of tone, the close attention to sound and language, the voice that is at once that of a beaten-down child and a jaded woman denouncing Daddy in one mouth, who proclaims, “Daddy, you can lie back now. // There’s a stake in your fat black heart / And the villagers never liked you.”\n\nWhile its success as a confessional poem must be almost universally lauded, the overwhelming extended metaphor of her father as a Nazi and herself as a Jew must enter these discussions as well. Plath’s comparisons are drastic: we flinch, burned by the disturbing imagery and her mention of concentration camps; we are caught off-guard by the frankness of her comparisons. She speaks with the stung and occasionally slyly sardonic voice of a victim: “Every woman adores a Fascist. / The boot in the face, the brute / Brute heart of a brute like you.” But is this voice hers to employ?\n\nHere, contemplation of the confessional flirts with identity poetics: would it be acceptable for a modern poet who is also a Gentile to adopt this convention? If not, then how do we discuss “Daddy,” a twentieth-century poem, through a modern lens? With ever-changing sociocultural contexts, continual critical discussion of the poetry we love is absolutely necessary.\n\nDespite, or perhaps because of, these conventions which the modern reader may (and perhaps should) find distasteful, her confessional poem is uniquely successful. When we take a second look, it is important to remember that even as we revere beloved poems and poets, our collective sense of critical thinking as readers must never leave the room. Celebration only does a poem justice if we continue to think analytically about what we are reading—and truly, “Daddy” is worth celebrating.\n\nAs we know, there are many reasons for readers’ perennial love of Sylvia Plath. Perhaps the best example of her prowess in this particular poem lies in the venom and resignation of the final line, which compels the reader, like a spell, to speak it aloud: “Daddy, daddy, you bastard, I’m through.”\n\nIssue 18: We Shall See\n\nWe Shall See\n\nFaiz Ahmed Faiz\n\nWe shall see\n\nCertainly\n\nwe too\n\nwill see\n\nWill see\n\nthat day\n\npromised to us\n\nThe one written\n\non eternity’s tablet\n\nWe shall see\n\nWhen the mountains of tyranny\n\nwill up and float\n\nlike cotton-wool\n\nAnd this earth tremor\n\nUnder the feet\n\nof us enslaved ones\n\nAnd over the heads of rulers\n\nlightning crackle\n\nWe shall see\n\nWhen\n\nfrom the ka’aba of this sacred earth\n\nall idols are removed\n\nWe the pure of heart—\n\ndamned by puritans—\n\nwill be elevated\n\nWhen all crowns are tossed in the air\n\nand all thrones overturned\n\nOnly God’s name will remain\n\nMystery and manifest\n\nThe viewer and the scene\n\nWhen the anthem of “ana al Haqq” (“I am the truth”) is raised—\n\n(which I am, and you are too)\n\nAnd the people of God will rule\n\n(which I am, and you are too)\n\nWe shall see\n\ncertainly we, too, will see\n\nWe shall see\n\nWe shall see\n\n(Translation from the Urdu by Shadab Zeest Hashmi)\n\nA Second Look by Shadab Zeest Hashmi\n\nFaiz Ahmed Faiz is the foremost “people’s poet” of Urdu literature and this poem is one of his best loved poems of resistance. It employs some of the tropes of a generic anthem (such as the use of the first person plural and a morale-boosting theme), but its purpose is not to praise nationalistic sentiment or take pride in the established order, rather it is to elevate the common man in relation to authority—political, social, and especially religious authority.\n\nFaiz was a prominent political activist and a journalist motivated by Marxist beliefs, but he was also a poet whose work honors Islamic heritage in its spirit and aesthetics. In this poem Faiz brilliantly employs imagery from the Qur’an (such as mountains floating like cotton-wool) to make the point that those who appropriate religion to control and oppress the masses are the ones that will face the ultimate accountability on judgement day—divine scrutiny and punishment. The ordinary, unorthodox, oppressed, the true “pure-of-heart” are Allah’s beloved people who will be favored over the oppressors.\n\nThe refrain (“we shall see”) is simple but loaded; it is inclusive, empowering, and voices a shared passion for reclaiming the power that rightfully belongs to the people. As with other political poems, this poem has been appropriated by various political parties over the decades and diminished in its scale and scope by readers with heavy political biases—It is ironic that appropriation is the very thing the poem challenges, and scale is its primary gesture, as it defies those that claim authority and ownership of “the truth,” the supreme balance being the divine scale and the awe-inspiring spectacle of the day of judgment. The greatest quality of the poem is not the populist appeal of the refrain; it is the subversion of rigid, dictatorial religious orthodoxy (as well as all other hierarchies and power structures), using tropes that themselves originate from the sacred—from the Qur’an and from Sufi literature.\n\nThe most daring verse, in my opinion, is “the anthem of ana al Haqq rising”—the Sufi concept of God residing within, the concept which is ultimately egalitarian to Faiz: elevating ordinary people to the highest stature. This is where the poem really plays with fire, provoking orthodoxy by recalling Hallaj’s controversial, mystical statement “I am the Truth.”\n\nIssue 17: “Bilingual Sestina”\n\nJulia Alvarez\n\nA Second Look by Catherine Carter\n\nBilingual Sestina\n\nSome things I have to say aren’t getting said\n\nin this snowy, blonde, blue-eyed, gum chewing English,\n\ndawn’s early light sifting through the persianas closed\n\nthe night before by dark-skinned girls whose words\n\nevoke cama, aposento, suenos in nombres\n\nfrom that first word I can’t translate from Spanish.\n\nGladys, Rosario, Altagracia—the sounds of Spanish\n\nwash over me like warm island waters as I say\n\nyour soothing names: a child again learning the nombres\n\nof things you point to in the world before English\n\nturned sol, tierra, cielo, luna to vocabulary words—\n\nsun, earth, sky, moon—language closed\n\nlike the touch-sensitive morivivir, whose leaves closed\n\nwhen we kids poked them, astonished. Even Spanish\n\nfailed us when we realized how frail a word\n\nis when faced with the thing it names. How saying\n\nits name won’t always summon up in Spanish or English\n\nthe full blown genii from the bottled nombre.\n\nGladys, I summon you back with your given nombre\n\nto open up again the house of slatted windows closed\n\nsince childhood, where palabras left behind for English\n\nstand dusty and awkward in neglected Spanish.\n\nRosario, muse of el patio, sing in me and through me say\n\nthat world again, begin first with those first words\n\nyou put in my mouth as you pointed to the world—\n\nnot Adam, not God, but a country girl numbering\n\nthe stars, the blades of grass, warming the sun by saying\n\nel sol as the dawn’s light fell through the closed\n\npersianas from the gardens where you sang in Spanish,\n\nEsta son las mananitas, and listening, in bed, no English\n\nyet in my head to confuse me with translations, no English\n\ndoubling the world with synonyms, no dizzying array of words,\n\n—the world was simple and intact in Spanish\n\nawash with colores, luz, suenos, as if the nombres\n\nwere the outer skin of things, as if words were so close\n\nto the world one left a mist of breath on things by saying\n\ntheir names, an intimacy I now yearn for in English—\n\nwords so close to what I meant that I almost hear my Spanish\n\nblood beating, beating inside what I say en ingles.\n\nBilingual poetry is a broad phrase; it can cover both poetry in translation, with the original on hand for comparison and discussion of word connotations, and poetry which is actually bilingual—that is, using two or more languages within the same poem. Julia Alvarez’s “Bilingual Sestina” falls into the latter category, and its use of bilingualism to comment on the workings of all language, and of all loss, is nothing short of stunning.\n\nFirst, its bilingualism widens its potential audience from the initial words, introducing a simultaneous sense of distance and strangeness for readers who don’t speak Spanish and a sense of intimacy and nostalgia for those who do—that sense of intimacy and nostalgia which the poet expresses in this poem. The careful use of bilingual words and phrases is mimetic, creating in bilingual readers the feelings the poet expresses. It also gives monolingual speakers of English a taste of what it’s like to be on the linguistic outside: constantly running up against words whose meanings we don’t know, thwarted, baffled, feeling like a failure.\n\nAlvarez, though, is crafty; she chooses words whose English translations can be inferred from their context, so that while monoglot readers are held at a slight distance, the distance isn’t great enough to drive them from the poem with total incomprehension. Selecting the number and context of these just-enough bilingualisms is an art in itself; it would be fatally easy to go too far one way or the other.\n\nThis experience, of course, reflects the content. In the first stanza, the speaker tells us that there are things she needs to say, but can’t say, in English alone, an English which she personifies as snowy, blonde, and gum-chewing: English as a white girl, and not an especially appealing one. The speaker goes on to evoke her central sense of place: the dawn filtering through closed blinds, the images of dark-skinned girls speaking Spanish. She goes on, in subsequent stanzas, to list other things English alone can’t evoke: the musical names of women she’s loved; the musical sounds of Spanish, which she compares to waves on a warm island; the ease of naming things (sun, moon, sky, earth) in our first languages, as compared to the struggle when those names are translated into “vocabulary words” in the second language—or, to put it another way, the ease and freedom of language we learn organically, without the struggle of formal study; the house of her childhood, imagined as a space in which lost words in Spanish stand dusty and awkward, like abandoned furniture; the sounds of Spanish songs; colors, light, dreams, a world “simple and intact”; the intimacy that the speaker knows through Spanish which she doesn’t get in English.\n\nBut why can’t English convey these things? For so many reasons, which reveal so much about how languages work overall.\n\nBecause every word in every language (of course) carries its distinct connotations. There’s never a full or a true translation from one language to another—something is always, as they say, “lost in translation.” Even synonyms in English aren’t exact synonyms; run isn’t the same as lope, gallop, trot, jog, or bolt.\n\nBecause the differences between languages also reflect the differences between cultures. The Dominican Republic, where Alvarez was raised though not born, is not the United States. A culture which has salsa and mariachi music and afternoon siestas, where everyone knows how to dance, is not the same as a culture which treats naps as a sign of weakness and where adults don’t routinely dance at parties.\n\nBecause the gaps between languages stand in, for this poet, for the gaps between people, between worlds. When you’re raised one place and then come to live somewhere very different, the struggles of expressing yourself in the new language are a microcosm for all the other struggles of getting used to everything being different.\n\nTo make this point, the poem offers a brief meditation on how any word, in any language, sometimes isn’t enough: “how frail a word / is when faced with the thing it names. How saying / its name won’t always summon up in Spanish or English / the full blown genii from the bottled nombre.” These lines ask us to consider how the word “table”, or the word “love”, are inadequate compared to an actual, physical table, or to feelings of love—something every poet knows, but which every reader doesn’t. Indeed, many people believe (or, for rhetorical purposes, choose to say they believe) in the transparency of language—words seamlessly signifying physical things with no gap between the two. The speaker reminds us that even the home language, the intimate, intact language of her childhood, is sometimes inadequate—is dead-alive, closes up when examined too closely, like the morivivir plant.\n\nFrom stanza 4, the speaker peoples her reimagined house with women from home, Gladys and Rosario. Who are Gladys and Rosario? We don’t know for sure…but do we need to? The speaker “summons” them back by speaking their names, a metaphor of magic or conjuring (for Alvarez, as for any writer, words and names are truly magical—it’s no coincidence that two of Alvarez’s end words are names/nombres and words/palabras. Sestina writers choose their end words even more carefully than all the others. So maybe it’s enough to know these are people she’s left behind, people she loves, people whose memory she conjures by saying their names.\n\nBut we do find out more: Alvarez invokes Rosario as a “muse of el patio”, the way Homer or Virgil opens an epic poem (“sing, Muse, of the trials of Odysseus, that man of many turns…”) Alvarez makes the classical gesture of invoking the muse who will allow her to write this poem (it’s very metacognitive.) She asks the absent Rosario to “sing in me and through me say that world again”.\n\nIn stanzas 4 and 5, Alvarez avails herself of the sestina writer’s license to change the forms or uses of her end words slightly: she changes her end-word word to world, adding one letter, suggesting that words are something like worlds in themselves. More, though, it makes Rosario, whom we now find out is “a country girl” (maybe a servant?), into an analog for, as the poet says right out, Adam or God in Genesis. As the lost Rosario names the stars and the blades of grass, she’s giving them life and meaning through her words: she “warms” the sun when she calls it el sol, her Spanish names bringing the light of dawn. This is a huge claim for the power of language, and it becomes hugely subversive as it takes the power of naming and creating away from the patriarchal (and probably white) figures of God and Adam, ascribing it instead to one country girl speaking Spanish to a small child. This shift creates intimacy and connection, “as if the nombres / were the outer skin of things, as if words were so close / to the world one left a mist of breath on things by saying // their names…”\n\nFinally, in the envoi, one of the end words again shifts its form, this time from English into Spanish…and the word, of course, is English/ingles. The English word English becomes the Spanish word for English. Beyond the meta-coolness of this move, which the speaker saves for the final line and the final word, the speaker literally changes an English word into a Spanish word—and, again, it’s the word for English, not just any English word. That is, she changes English into Spanish. She claims and exerts her own godlike power over language, a power that she has only because she IS bilingual. The losses and gaps and pangs of bilingualism have given her a power she mightn’t otherwise have.\n\nThe act of writing this poem—and, by extension, all other poems—becomes the act of recreating her world—by extension, all worlds. It is achieved by changing one language to another—and it’s hard to imagine a better argument for bilingualism than that.\n\nIssue 16: “Cat Puke and Flies Poem”\n\nAl Zolynas\n\nA Second Look by Catherine Carter\n\nI encountered Al Zolynas’ “Cat Puke and Flies Poem” for the first time in Steve Kowit’s poetry primer, In the Palm of Your Hand: The Poet’s Portable Workshop. This is still my favorite poetry manual, 23 years later, and Zolynas’ ode to cat vomit is still one of my favorite poems on earth, one which I teach every time I get the chance.\n\nThis is because “Cat Puke and Flies” reads as if Zolynas had sat down to create an exemplar of my favorite things about poetry: unexpected and individual subject matter; the way that words’ connotations and associations carry what, if the poem were an article, we might call its argument; the description, or embodiment, of epiphany in the language of our everyday speech; the funny and the not-so-funny entwined with one another like mating slugs—though without the disturbing denouement which characterizes slug love (go on—look it up. There’s time.) And, most of all, the way it re-makes the world while we watch: as if our eyes had been dirty and someone had washed the glass inside them; as if our vision had been slowly deteriorating and then we were given the right prescription. Suddenly the trees sprout twigs again, and we perceive them, rightly, as marvelous.\n\nI also enjoy teaching this poem because it confounds non-poets’ expectations so dramatically with its initial offering of mild shock. You can write a poem about WHAT? No WAY! It plays particularly well with secondary students, whose willingness to revel in gross-out is the perfect setup for the revelation that if anything’s vile here, it’s not the flies.\n\nIn teaching this poem, I like to begin with connotation, once we’ve established the literal level (blessedly easy, thanks to Zolynas’ deadpan voiceover.) This poem makes the most of its words’ multiple connotations: ecstatic, bounty, brothers and sisters, fast, organization, calm, glinting, emerald, purple. And, oh, yes: grace. The religious connotations offer the first clues that there’s more here than a joke, and prepares us for the gradually unveiled view of the world through the lens of Fly.\n\nThat world is ecstatic, a word with both sexual and spiritual connotations, thanks in part to the freely given “bounty” of the cat vomit: “there’s obviously always/ enough for everyone in the fly world”, the speaker explains. Imagine, I tell the probably-hungry students, that the floor is made of your favorite food: hot fudge sundae, lemon asparagus, macaroni and cheese with extra cheese. Now imagine that it’s clean enough to suit you: you’re largely immune to disease, you never think about germs, and you can reach down and grab a handful whenever you feel like it.\n\nNor does this world include any sexual hangups: there’s “plenty of time to get of a quickie / with your neighbor.” What’s that like, students may ask. Imagine some more: everyone you see is appealing, and whenever you choose, you can say, “Hey, baby, how about it?” And the person can say yes, in which case you both get right to it with no fuss and no shame, or no, in which case there’s always someone else. There’s no fear of pregnancy, no performance anxiety, no STDs, no walk of shame…and no rape.\n\n“Wow,” one student memorably remarked at this point. “Are we talking about heaven here?”\n\nFunny you should ask.\n\nBecause, lacking famine and frustration and competition for resources, there’s “no fuss, no fighting”. This world without hunger is a world without war—a state we higher life forms haven’t achieved in ten thousand years. Unlike us, the flies are all “brothers and sisters.” This is literally a nod to the facts that the flies all look pretty similar, and that they may well have all hatched from the same clutch of eggs and pupated from the same boil of maggots; but it also invokes the language of religious service to comment on the flies’ pacific nature. These flies are all brethren, and the peace of the flies passes all understanding.\n\nThe straightforward narration tells us this; the word selection, though, tells even more. The flies are the recipients, and the embodiments, of grace: not only of physical dexterity, but of the kind of blessing that we can’t earn and can’t deserve, the kind freely given from the infinite generosity of the divine—if you will, out of love. They’re decked in emerald and purple—rare, precious, even royal. Their lives are “fast” (the word is repeated twice, suggesting a complementary reading of the poem as concerned with earthy time), but they are “calm.” If heaven created these flies (a possibility generally ignored in discussions of Creators), it seems to have been lavish with its blessings.\n\nMoreover, the cat vomit is similarly transfigured: one half is in light, one in shadow, “like sunrise / on a volcanic island.” The “island” is volcanic because it’s been spewed from the belly of a force of nature. Marcello (a cat whose very name evokes the haughty white Persian on the Fancy Feast can) has become a volcano, and his vomit lava which cools to form land on the face of the waters: a comparison, both amusing and profound, which fairly begs us to wonder anew about the nature of creation. And the result is beautiful as an island at sunrise. The speaker’s response to this vision is appropriate: he kneels.\n\nUltimately, this poem opens a wider door, inviting us to reconsider everything human people consider ugly, dirty, scary. A poet who really looks calls into question everything we’ve been told about the world. Short of human cruelty or waste, the poem tells us, not so many things are inherently ugly or awful: their ugliness or awfulness may be in how we look at them. As revolting as it sounds when flies devour a pile of cat vomit, Zolynas is willing to look closer, to recognize that our disgust for flies and germs may be the illusion, his vision the true vision.\n\nCat Puke and Flies\n\nI feed Marcello a can of Liver and Chicken.\n\nHe bolts it down too fast, as usual.\n\nTwo minutes later he throws up\n\non the back patio.\n\nThe first fly shows up within seconds,\n\necstatic over life’s bounty.\n\nWithin minutes, the word’s out\n\nsomehow, the brothers and sisters\n\ncoming in fast.\n\nThe sun creeps along the cement floor.\n\nPretty soon, half the cat puke is in light,\n\nthe other in shadow, like sunrise\n\non a volcanic island.\n\nAt least thirty flies have gathered by now,\n\nwalking around and eating\n\nwhat they’re walking around on.\n\nI move in closer.\n\nSuch organization and grace—\n\nno fuss, no fighting. There’s obviously always\n\nenough for everyone in the fly world.\n\nAnd plenty of time to get off a quickie\n\nwith your neighbor.\n\nI’m now on my hands and knees,\n\nmy face within inches\n\nof the calm feeding of at least fifty flies\n\n(give or take arrivals and departures).\n\nNone seem to notice me,\n\nthe sun glinting off their emerald thoraxes\n\nand through their purple wings.\n\nIssue 15: Ode to a Rat\n\nWhen Elizabeth Acevedo was enrolled in an MFA program, the only person of color in her program, she was asked to write an ode. Her professor scoffed at her notion that she might write a poem about a rat. She was laughed at, told a rat was “not noble enough” to be the subject of a poem. So she decided to write, not just a poem, but an Ode, one of the most elevated forms , a lyric poem of heightened praise, to a rat.\n\nHer poem raises important questions. What is an ode? Who gets to determine the definition of a form? How does form change according to the poet writing it? Can someone writing from outside ‘the canon’ recapture a standard form and make it relevant?\n\nFor the Poet Who Told Me Rats Aren’t Noble Enough Creatures for a Poem\n\nBecause you are not the admired nightingale.\n\nBecause you are not the noble doe.\n\nBecause you are not the blackbird,\n\npicturesque ermine, armadillo, or bat.\n\nThey’ve been written, and I don’t know their song\n\nthe way I know your scuttling between walls.\n\nThe scent of your collapsed corpse bloating\n\nbeneath floorboards. Your frantic squeals\n\nas you wrestle your own fur from glue traps.\n\nBecause in July of ’97, you birthed a legion\n\non 109th, swarmed from behind dumpsters,\n\nmade our street infamous for something\n\nother than crack. We nicknamed you “Cat-\n\nkiller,” raced with you through open hydrants,\n\nscreeched like you when Siete blasted\n\naluminum bat into your brethren’s skull—\n\nthe sound: slapped down dominoes. You reigned\n\nthat summer, Rat; knocked down the viejo’s Heinekens,\n\nyour screech erupting with the cry of Capicu!\n\nAnd even when they sent exterminators,\n\nset flame to garbage, half dead, and on fire, you\n\npushed on.\n\nBecause you may be inelegant, simple,\n\na mammal bottom-feeder, always fucking famished,\n\nlittle ugly thing that feasts on what crumbs fall\n\nfrom the corner of our mouths, but you live\n\nuncuddled, uncoddled, can’t be bought at Petco\n\nand fed to fat snakes because you’re not the maze-rat\n\nof labs: pale, pretty-eyed, trained.\n\nYou raise yourself sharp fanged, clawed, scarred,\n\npatched dark—because of this alone they should\n\nlove you. So, when they tell you to crawl home\n\ntake your gutter, your dirt coat, your underbelly that\n\nscrapes against street, concrete, squeak and filth this\n\npage, Rat.\n\nIssue 14: Patrick Kavanagh, The Great Hunger\n\nPatrick Kavanagh grew up a peasant, and in his epic poem The Great Hunger he examines the complex, sophisticated and tragic emotional trajectory of the lives of Irish peasants, men, and to a lesser extent women, who worked the land, honored church and family, but lived an existence several steps darker than Thoreau’s lives of quiet desperation.\n\nClay is the word and clay is the flesh\n\nWhere the potato-gatherers like mechanised scarecrows move\n\nAlong the side-fall of the hill – Maguire and his men.\n\nIf we watch them an hour is there anything we can prove\n\nOf life as it is broken-backed over the Book\n\nOf Death? Here crows gabble over worms and frogs\n\nAnd the gulls like old newspapers are blown clear of the hedges, luckily.\n\nIs there some light of imagination in these wet clods?\n\nOr why do we stand here shivering?\n\nThe title is taken from the name given the potato famine that devastated Ireland in the 19th century, leaving 1 million dead, and Kavanaugh uses it it to explore what he sees as a different type of famine and death that devastated lives in the mid 20th century.\n\nA dog lying on a torn jacket under a heeled-up cart,\n\nA horse nosing along the posied headland, trailing\n\nA rusty plough. Three heads hanging between wide-apart legs.\n\nOctober playing a symphony on a slack wire paling.\n\nMaguire watches the drills flattened out\n\nAnd the flints that lit a candle for him on a June altar\n\nFlameless.\n\nLucy Collins, writing in an extended remembrance of Kavanaugh in the Irish Times, says “Though the spiritual and sexual deprivation of mid-century Ireland is brought into stark relief in this poem, it is ultimately an expression of thwarted love.”\n\nLike the afterbirth of a cow stretched on a branch in the wind\n\nLife dried in the veins of these women and men:\n\n‘The grey and grief and unloved,\n\nThe bones in the backs of their hands,\n\nAnd the chapel pressing its low ceiling over them.\n\nThe poem was published in 1942, and it’s depiction of the life of the peasant moves from lyric beauty to existential despair, from bemusement to horror. It’s a poem that leaves one both in awe, and constantly visited by an ever-deepening sense of a down-circling life lost to others’ expectations.\n\nLike a goat tethered to the stump of a tree –\n\nHe circles around and around wondering why it should be.\n\nNo crash, No drama.\n\nThat was how his life happened.\n\nNo mad hooves galloping in the sky,\n\nBut the weak, washy way of true tragedy –\n\nA sick horse nosing around the meadow for a clean place to die.\n\nIssue 13: Yusef Komunyakaa, Camouflaging the Chimera\n\nIt is hard to make war intimately familiar to those who haven’t been on the front lines. The self-protecting mind tends to wean itself from savage realities or defer to clichés approximating heartfelt empathy. What I love about this poem by Yusef Komunyakaa is that it overwrites both these tendencies, almost surreptitiously. This poem catches me off guard every time, making the poet’s recollection of his experience in the Vietnam War a vivid and urgently personal one for both poet and reader.\n\nKomunyakaa astutely chronicles the smallest details of an imminent ambush interweaving the topography of the soldier’s psyche with the natural environment he or she sneaks through. The we here could be anyone and everyone; it includes even the chameleons and the grass, the mud and light, along with the ghosts of fallen comrades and their widows’ longings. This fugue of muted but omnipresent voices, creatures, sensations, and scrolling intimations, gives the poem the chilling feeling of a live broadcast. The past tense feels all too present and forebodingly prophetic as we, the reader, understand this scene to be the portrait of ongoing human tragedy.\n\nThis is a blunt poem of murky boundaries and implications. Distinctions between victim and enemy, nature and man are unclear—both a chimera that must be reckoned with. We are thrust into a place of pulsing portent against the threat of “dark-hearted songbirds.” There is such sadness in that telling and paradoxical depiction, a compassion for the equally bleak predicament of the other.\n\nVC, the one specific reference in the poem, is made all the more stark with the oppositional image of “black silk” struggling to wield iron through grass. The fate of this figure is unknown; he is a fleeting actor in a stalled maelstrom who disappears with the chameleons measuring the passage of time in colors tracing the spines of the soldiers. These mercurial creatures heighten the sensation of invasion, yet they likewise take refuge, camouflaging themselves with the soldiers’ growing foreboding. The human is simultaneously engulfed and salvaged by nature.\n\nWhat is real and what is not? What are the boundaries of truth and our claims to action or inaction? What does it mean for human nature to be so starkly pitted against the physical environment and yet to depend wholeheartedly upon it? When something as ungraspable as the breeze becomes our buttress and the rocks become jesters, have we surpassed the limits of our mortality or merely succumbed to the fate of a fallible and corrupted humanity that is as fickle and uncompromising as the natural world? These are just some of the many questions this poem poignantly evokes.\n\nTo move or to remain when neither is a suitable recourse— this is the vulnerability that war renders all the more insistent. Komunyakaa movingly distills the perilous fact that for some things there is simply no camouflage.\n\n– Anya Russian\n\nCamouflaging the Chimera\n\nWe tied branches to our helmets.\n\nWe painted our faces & rifles\n\nwith mud from a riverbank,\n\nblades of grass hung from the pockets\n\nof our tiger suits. We wove\n\nourselves into the terrain,\n\ncontent to be a hummingbird’s target.\n\nWe hugged bamboo & leaned\n\nagainst a breeze off the river,\n\nslow-dragging with ghosts\n\nfrom Saigon to Bangkok,\n\nwith women left in doorways\n\nreaching in from America.\n\nWe aimed at dark-hearted songbirds.\n\nIn our way station of shadows\n\nrock apes tried to blow our cover,\n\nthrowing stones at the sunset. Chameleons\n\ncrawled our spines, changing from day\n\nto night: green to gold,\n\ngold to black. But we waited\n\ntill the moon touched metal,\n\ntill something almost broke\n\ninside us. VC struggled\n\nwith the hillside, like black silk\n\nwrestling iron through grass.\n\nWe weren’t there. The river ran\n\nthrough our bones. Small animals took refuge\n\nagainst our bodies; we held our breath,\n\nready to spring the L-shaped\n\nambush, as a world revolved\n\nunder each man’s eyelid.\n\nIssue 12: Woman Falling by Franz Wright\n\nIt’s so interesting you should suddenly be here, how did that happen? In your favorite place, this witchy old orange orchard, the very spot where it gives the impression of stretching forever in every direction–all those spokes, from where you stand, between the trees, within sight of the three-story house painted the same shade of white and right about the same size as this lone beehive you stand looking down at a moment, no one has lived there for as long as you’ve known it, kept it a secret, parking off the high-way and walking a mile down the nameless dirt road in a windy and shadowy brightness, wind from the sun you would say, in your mind, if I know you, as I do not, and never will now, no one will anymore, you have made sure of that, but I can picture you saying it, I’m not bothering anyone, I don’t even know where it is, that’s the point, no one did, nobody knew how to reach you, in the one vacant room with a mattress you even spent a night sometimes, honeysuckle southern California dawn wind blowing through the glassless windows and over your body, over your hair, maybe God would let you be the wind, but I don’t know what God thinks either, I just like to imagine you all at once finding yourself in that place, walking along, without anyone knowing, that was the haunting, that was always the fun, and stretching before you a whole day of wandering and singing alone in the instant right before the one in which your body meets the earth at last.\n\nThe poet opens his eyes to find himself in a dreamlike landscape, “witchy” orange orchard, possibly at a gravesite, slightly astonished to find her(?) there, though it’s her favorite place, her secret place, where she is at the center, spoking out in all directions. She looks down from inside the mythic white house empty of human habitation, at a bee hive, and we begin to wonder – did she jump to her death?\n\nHe imagines her parking a mile off, down a dirt road in a “shadowy brightness” which she might consider “the wind from the sun” –\n\nAnd then the poem turns, as he admits he doesn’t know her enough to suggest what she might think; and no one will anymore, she has “made sure of that.” With its implication of suicide, the poem moves forward with his regret and desire to somehow keep her alive through what he can picture her saying. A process – the act of poetry – he hopes might justify his failure to act in life. “I’m not bothering anyone, I don’t even know where it is, that’s the point, no one did, nobody knew how to reach you.”\n\nThe conflation of ‘it’ and ‘her’, the landscape now become the absent person, alone in a vacant room on a mattress. In his poetic imagining Wright grants her the grace of honeysuckle and a visitation from God who would let her be the dawn wind.\n\nBut then he doesn’t know what God thinks, either. He’s just imagining that also. So he returns to his own imagining – creating, gifting her “a whole day of wandering and singing” before her body meets the earth “at last.”\n\nIssue 11: “homage to my hips”\n\nOne of Lucille Clifton’s best-known poems, “homage to my hips,” appeared in the 1980 collection Two-Headed Woman and the 1987 Good Woman. The poem mythologizes large hips and celebrates the female body, especially the African-American body, as nothing short of magical in its strength and power (sexual and otherwise) and its potential for freedom.\n\nHowever, despite being regularly reprinted and anthologized, “homage to my hips”—like much of Clifton’s oeuvre—has not received the critical notice it deserves. At best, the poem is treated as “inspirational,” adjuring women to love our bodies even when we don’t meet a narrow patriarchal standard of beauty. Of course, the poem does urge women to love their embodied selves…but in a much more nuanced way than the suggestion that we should wear purple (at least when we’re safely old), or even that we should recognize ourselves as inherently phenomenal women.\n\nhomage to my hips\n\nLucille Clifton\n\nthese hips are big hips\n\nthey need space to\n\nmove around in.\n\nthey don’t fit into little\n\npetty places. these hips\n\nare free hips.\n\nthey don’t like to be held back.\n\nthese hips have never been enslaved,\n\nthey go where they want to go\n\nthey do what they want to do.\n\nthese hips are mighty hips.\n\nthese hips are magic hips.\n\ni have known them\n\nto put a spell on a man and\n\nspin him like a top!\n\nThis is generally handled as a light-hearted treatise of love for the body that we’re told to hate and strive to change…if one can call that light-hearted. When I teach this poem, which I seize any excuse to do, we start there: why does Clifton need to offer up a homage to her hips? why wouldn’t women love their hips?\n\nThe norm, as portrayed by advertising, media, male commentary, and the women themselves, is that women’s bottoms are almost by definition considered too big. No matter how big they actually are, we’re supposed to want to get rid of them. Buttocks and hips are crammed into jeans and shapewear so tight as to gouge lines into flesh; women literally starve trying to shrink them; the desperate (and affluent) will accept mutilation and risk death to have them cut away. This is how profoundly the female body in America, especially the stereotypically larger African-American female body, is loathed and stigmatized. So Clifton’s poem doesn’t address petty concerns, and while it’s a poem of fierce delight and reclamation, relegating it to the realm of light-hearted inspiration is too glib. We can see this in the “free” in line 6. “Free,” of course, has powerful associations, especially for an African-American woman.\n\nClifton is known for working in uncapitalized free verse (though she punctuates quite carefully). As Lewis Turco and others have noted, however, good free verse isn’t…and “homage to my hips” is tightly structured and crafted. How many lines in the poem? I ask my students, and which is the longest line? As the careful reader has already noticed, there are fifteen, and the longest line is the central one, line 8 (coincidence? you be the judge).\n\nThen there’s that word in the middle: enslaved. That word is important—it should jar us, to hear the word “enslaved” in a happy poem about loving our butts—and its placement is important too: out there at the end of a line, at the very center of the poem, where it carries real weight. What else might be going on here? Could these hips, big as they may be, represent anything bigger?\n\nOnce we ask the question, of course, the answer is obvious. An African-American woman doesn’t use the word enslaved lightly or figuratively. She’s talking about literal slavery, the kind in which children are sold away from their parents, women are raped as a matter of policy, and punishments might include whipping a man five hundred times, rubbing the wounds with salt and pepper, laying the man before a hot fire until the wounds blister, and finally forcing a cat to claw open the blisters.\n\nAt this point, there’s usually a pause in the classroom. Whoa, someone might say. Does Clifton really want to compare tight jeans and dieting with THAT?\n\nOh, hell, yes, she does, because that’s the power of this poem. Despite the hips’ sexual power to attract men and enjoy them, the poem is more than light-hearted, and the hips’ magic and desire are more than flowers and candy. As Zora Neale Hurston remarked—also about race and beauty—real gods require blood. This poem has plenty.\n\nWomen, says Clifton—especially Black women—that’s what we’re doing when we accept our hips as too big, needing to be confined or cut away. We’re walking right back into the bullwhip days. We’re crushing and cutting our bodies to fit exploitative standards. We’re enslaving ourselves. And she won’t do it. That’s why her hips can put a spell on a man and spin him like a top: because she insists on their freedom, and ultimately freedom is power, and fulfillment, and joy—irresistible.\n\nBut that power doesn’t come cheap. It requires active refusal to fit into “little petty places,” owning the body’s might and the magic in a way that few people really want women to do. It means recognizing beauty standards and the beauty industry as slaveholders getting rich on oppressed bodies, and the skin-tight jeans and cosmetic scalpel as whips in the owner’s hands, and that means pissing off people who are also very powerful. It means valuing our own freedom over a whole system of cultural hegemony, and being hated for it—though also, if we’re lucky, loved too.\n\nInspirational? How about genuinely radical?\n\n– Catherine Carter\n\nIssue 10: A Refusal to Mourn…\n\nRandall Jarrell defined a poet as someone “who manages, in a lifetime of standing out in thunderstorms, to be struck by lightning five or six times,” in which case Dylan Thomas was well toasted, and not only on booze. Of the five or six lightning strikes (and there may well be more) that qualify Thomas as a poet, I will offer one:\n\nA Refusal to Mourn the Death, by Fire, of a Child in London\n\nNever until the mankind making\n\nBird beast and flower\n\nFathering and all humbling darkness\n\nTells with silence the last light breaking\n\nAnd the still hour\n\nIs come of the sea tumbling in harness\n\nAnd I must enter again the round\n\nZion of the water bead\n\nAnd the synagogue of the ear of corn\n\nShall I let pray the shadow of a sound\n\nOr sow my salt seed\n\nIn the least valley of sackcloth to mourn\n\nThe majesty and burning of the child’s death.\n\nI shall not murder\n\nThe mankind of her going with a grave truth\n\nNor blaspheme down the stations of the breath\n\nWith any further\n\nElegy of innocence and youth.\n\nDeep with the first dead lies London’s daughter,\n\nRobed in the long friends,\n\nThe grains beyond age, the dark veins of her mother,\n\nSecret by the unmourning water\n\nOf the riding Thames.\n\nAfter the first death, there is no other.\n\nThough often baffling, Thomas’s poems are never diffident. This poem, for example, beginning with the grim and seemingly blasphemous title accosts the reader, who has three options: 1) turn away, as one might from a half-crazed street preacher, 2) dismiss it as rank baloney, or 3) consent to its severe, almost archaic and certainly vatic lyricism. Readers who withhold initial judgement and forbear demanding immediate comprehension, might find themselves immersed in the poem’s Gregorian ambience, liturgical rhetoric, and mystery. In fact, Thomas’s poetry seems dithyrambic and improvisatory, a quality that endeared him to the Beat poets. But Thomas labored over his poems, their torqued quality a result of ruthless revisions, composing, or so he claimed, two lines a day, revising them until they satisfied his purpose and the demands of the poem—a scrupulous routine and one hard to reconcile with his supposed chronic alcoholism, all of which ultimately is not pertinent to the merit of his work. However, Thomas’s vision and how his language animated that vision is pertinent. And to understand that it is helpful to consider his craft and the lyric agenda to which it is applied.\n\n“A Refusal to Mourn…” consists of four declarative sentences played out through four sestets, rhyming A B C A B C, except for the last, which rhymes A B A A C A, the A rhymes being all feminine—daughter, mother, water, other—, cumulatively suggest maternity, or, in the context of the poem, death as the mother of the war-murdered daughter. The meter is loose, swinging from tetrameter to dimeter (long over short lines), and the syntax, torqued, dependent, and markedly dithyrambic. Of the eighteen lines comprising the first sentence, seventeen are enjambed. The second sentence covers eight lines, seven of which are enjambed, and the third sentence, five lines, two being enjambed. The forth and concluding sentence is one line. In summary, as the poem progresses, the sentences get shorter, the syntax, less contorted, and enjambment, less pronounced, moving from jagged vehemence to pacific denouement.\n\nBut sentences are made of words, and symbolically productive and tonally vibrant word choice (diction), is, alongside prosody and syntax, an aspect of poetic craft, one that Thomas consistently employed, as demonstrated in this poem’s metaphysically suggestive rhymes: making/breaking, darkness/harness, death/breath, daughter/mother/water. The ecclesiastic tenor of diction is furthered enhanced by the seeding of words rich with scriptural significance: mourn, darkness, last light, humbling, salt, seed. Zion, synagogue, grave, and, of course, death.\n\nDylan Thomas’s craft, what he has describes as “sullen craft”—the torqued, dependent and often inverted, syntax, liberal usage of gerunds and ing participles that frequently follow, a meter chimed with alliteration and studded with spondees—recalls Anglo Saxon Verse, particularly “Caedmon’s Hymn.” Equally revealing, and perhaps more so, is his artistic kinship to Gerald Manley Hopkins, an unlikely poetic progenitor, considering Hopkins’s reticence and humility, as compared to Thomas’s famously transgressive and excessive showmanship, which he knew was largely responsible for his popularity, a distressing realization because it led him to doubt his literary merit. Yet, didn’t Hopkin, too, distrust his literary merit and passion for poetry, finding it contrary to his vows and avocation as a Jesuit priest? Are these not two very different artists, one a devout Christian and converted Roman Catholic, the other a hedonistic shaman poet? I am not so sure. Several scholars have noted seemingly Judeo-Christian elements in several poems by Dylan Thomas’s. Are those Judo Christian elements present in “A Refusal to Mourn…” Possibly, considering the scriptural character of the poem’s diction and its mysterious final line.\n\nMost intriguing to me is Thomas’s appropriation of sprung rhythm from Hopkins, the originator of that poetic. I say poetic because sprung rhythm is not merely a memorable (and sometimes confounding) prosodic technique. Rather, Hopkins developed sprung rhythm as a infinitely flexible objective correlative for “inscape,” which is how Hopkins described the everywhere kinetic indwelling of the Holy Spirit, i.e. the indiscriminate charging (imminence) of “God’s Grandeur” throughout nature. And that was what Hopkins strove represent and praise. But Thomas? I don’t know, but the last paragraph of Dylan’s Thomas’s introduction to his Collected Poem, 1934-1952 reads:\n\nI read somewhere of a shepherd who, when asked why he made, from\n\nfairy rings, ritual observances to the moon to protect his flock, replied\n\n‘I’d be a damned fool if I didn’t. These poems, with all their crudities,\n\ndoubts, and confusions, are written for the love of man and in praise\n\nof God, and I’d be a damn fool if they weren’t.\n\nIssue 9: Looking for Songs of Papusza\n\nLooking for Songs of Papusza (Bronisława Wajs)\n\nGypsy singer-poet Bronisława Wajs (1910-1987), known by her Roma name Papusza (“Doll”), was the first Gypsy known to write down and publish her songs as poems. Papusza’s people were wandering harpists who sang and played at inns, weddings, and fairs. Most were illiterate and disapproved of reading. As a child Papusza stole chickens and traded them to a local shopke"
