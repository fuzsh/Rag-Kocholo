        "text": "This paper aims to objectify Marxist tendencies in the poetry of Faiz Ahmad Faiz and Kaifi Azmi, the illustrious, revolutionary poets of the post-imperial era who have dedicated their art to resist against anarchy, tyranny, capitalism and misrule, and to create an utopian society where peace and equality would prevail. The paper is an endeavor to show how Faiz Ahmad Faiz and Kaifi Azmi were influenced by Marxist ideology and how they wanted the world to be a better place. However, these poets belonged to different social, political and cultural contexts. These poets have projected their Marxist utopian vision in reaction to capitalist hegemony in their respective social order. The sufferings and resistance of the oppressed were depicted by them. This paper also discusses the influence of Marxism on Romantic literary attitude and how these poets dropped their romantic approach for resistance.\n\nRomantic poetry, as an expression of the conscious and unconscious sentiments of the individual, holds a significant potential to be analysed for psychological contents. Such a view would reveal the personal life and psychological status of the poets. Therefore, the present paper concentrates on the Lacanian reading of the poetry of John Keats and Faiz Ahmad Faiz: the two major romantic poets of two different eras. Lacan divides the development of human psyche into three different stages i.e. ‘imaginary order’, ‘symbolic order’ and ‘real order’ While focusing on the ‘imaginary order’ and ‘symbolic order’, this comparative study intends highlighting the similar psychological states of the two poets as expressed in their poetry.\n\nThe All-India Muslim League achieved Pakistan, the Indian National Congress secured India but the Shiromani Akali Dal got nothing on the eve of the British departure in 1947 although the Sikh community had collaborated closely with the colonial power. The demand of the Sikh community for a separate Sikh state and accession of more territories to this state came to naught as a consequence of partition of Indian subcontinent. The decision of joining India by the Akali leadership enslaved this community to a mammoth majority in which they were only one per cent. Different scholars took variety of directions in exploring the roots of the Sikh failure in the final breakdown. According to Sher Muhammad Grewal, Sikhs failed to achieve something beneficial in the political arena staged in 1940s because they were very simple people and could not apprehend the sensitive situation of Punjab politics.1 Sangat Singh claims that the principal reason behind the Sikh failure was the incompetent Akali leadership2 while Sardar Hukam Singh opines that situational politics left no positive options for the Akali leaders, therefore their decision to join India was the best choice.3 These scholars tried to solve this tangle by pointing out some specific aspect of the question which still leaves many gaps. Actually, there were ample reasons which combined and resulted in the Sikh failure. This article traces the factors which compelled the Sikh political leadership to reject Pakistan and decide in favour of India in 1947.\n\nThis critical biography of Indu Mitha, a Pakistani dancer and choreographer, lays out an alternate, creative history of sixty-four years of post-Partition Pakistan. Her life and work enable choreographing an occluded space on stage and beyond, which I call space of hope --a space of alterity, a place where narratives countering the nation state boundaries enforced by the 1947 Partition of British India into the three independent states of Pakistan, India, and Bangladesh (1971). This space is not a post-colonial one, but is based on a longer shared historical specificity of South Asia. Indu Mitha&#39;s life and work enable this journey into occluded spaces, into an alternate history of sixty-four years of post-Partition Pakistan. These spaces of hope are foci to probing broader questions about the place of the outliers, i.e. Muslims in India, and non-Muslims and non-Pakistanis in Pakistan (Post 1971), in the aftermath of the 1947 Partition of India. This dissertation stages the untol...\n\nThis book tells the story of Pakistan through the lens of the Cold War, and more recently the War on Terror, to shed light on the domestic and international processes behind the global rise of militant Islam. Unlike existing scholarship on nationalism, Islam and the state in Pakistan, which tends to privilege events in a narrowly defined 'political' realm, Saadia Toor highlights the significance of cultural politics in Pakistan from its origins to the contemporary period. This extra dimension allows Toor to explain how the struggle between Marxists and liberal nationalists was influenced and eventually engulfed by the agenda of the religious right."
