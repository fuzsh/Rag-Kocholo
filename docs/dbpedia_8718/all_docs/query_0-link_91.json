        "text": "News\n\nA new generation is falling in love with the ghazal\n\nThis story is from March 19, 2023\n\nA new generation is falling in love with the ghazal\n\nArtists in India and Pakistan are winning over younger listeners by giving the genre a more contemporary feel while retaining its soul\n\nKanishk Seth was four when he first heard a ghazal . It was in his blood, after all. His mother, renowned singer Kavita Seth, started her career with ghazals. At a young age, he was also exposed to the work ofmany poets such as Rumi, Bulleh Shah, Waseem Barelvi, and Faiz Ahmed Faiz. At the same time, his teenage years were spent listening to MIDIval Punditz, an Indian electronica band, and the pop-blues superstar John Mayer. This mÃ©lange of experiences shaped his desire to give ghazals a modern makeover. He describes his attempt as making thearrangements more contemporary, while keeping its âsoul intactâ. âThe question in my mind was, how do I give a new spring to it?â\n\nThe mother-son duo is today at the forefront of redefining ghazals. Across India and Pakistan, artists such as Ali Sethi, Zeeshan Ali , and Pratibha Singh Baghel, are coming out with renditions which are shorter, use simplified poetry, and add western instruments and electronic music. However, they retain the themes of melancholy, longing and nostalgia typical to ghazals. In terms of writing, they are a collection of couplets composed in the same meter. The ghazal version of Rekha Bharadwajâs âAise Kyonâ, featured in the Netflix show âMismatchedâ, started trending on Instagram reels. Ali Sethiâs version ofâRanjish Hi Sahiâ, a ghazal written by Ahmad Faraz and performed by Mehdi Hassan in the 1980s, took the internet by storm when it featured in Coke Studio Pakistan. In an interview to Dawn a couple of years ago, Sethi spoke of how one producer asked him why I was into âsuch an aunty-uncle genre. â Now, he says, not only do a lot of young people appreciate the genre but even want him to sing ghazals at weddings.\n\nNineteen-year-old Niyati Agarwal, who was introduced to the likes of Mehdi Hasan and Ghulam Ali by her fatherâs collection of CDs, says the genre is more accessible than before. âOur generation wonât respond much to the original 8-15-minute-long versions of these ghazals. So these contemporary artists have packaged them into more easily consumable forms. âBrooklyn-based Pakistani singer Arooj Aftab is another artist breathing new life into the ghazal with jazz and Sufi influences. Her smoky rendition of âMohabbatâ, a famous ghazal sung by the legendary Mehdi Hassan and written by Hafeez Hoshiarpuri, won a Grammy and made its way to former US president Barack Obamaâs influential playlist.\n\nThis is by no means the first attempt by ghazal artists to make the genre more accessible for the audiences. Late singer Jagjit Singh is often credited with modernising the genre by choosing simple poems and setting them to simple tunes. He also introduced western instrumentation to make them livelier.\n\nSinghâs successful experiments remain the inspiration for todayâs artists too. âMy momâs inspiration was Jagjit Singh because he used to express very deep thoughts in a simple way. Iâve heard stories about how he used to teach audiences how to listen to ghazals, when to clap and when not to,â Seth says.\n\nAli Sethi too has a conversation with the audience before launching into a performance. At the start of the music video of Sethiâs âChaandni Raatâ, the viewers are literally explained what a ghazal is. Sethi and others also regularly conduct live sessions on Instagram.\n\nThese have been crucial for falling in love with ghazals for 33-yearold Sayanatani Maiti , whoâs pursuing her masters in electrical energy engineering in Italy. Maiti says that while she listened to the famous ghazals by Jagjit Singh and Ghulam Ali as a teen, she only developed a deeper relationship with ghazals recently. âI got really immersed into ghazals in late 2020, and I owe this to Instagram Live. Singers like Pratibha Singh Bagel , Prithvi Gandharv and Ali Sethi do live sessions, in which theyâd do their riyaaz on video, and explain the nuances of ghazals. â\n\nAnother emphasis is on usingelectronic sounds and western instruments, along with the traditional mainstays of ghazals â the harmonium, sitar, sarangi, and the flute. Aftab uses the harp, while Kanishk Seth has reimagined Faizâs âAapki Yaadâ for his album by using the clarinet and sarangi together. âI really like using Indian instruments with electronic sounds. However, even though my beats and bass are there, I always make it a point to make an Indian instrument the hero,â Seth says. He adds that, along with his mother, he has composed a ghazal written by Jaun Elia for a bigbudget Dharma Productions movie. The fusion composition uses styles and instruments of jazz music with the ghazal. âAs my mother Kavita says, âRooh wahi hai, bas kapde naye hain (The soul is the same, only the clothes have changed). â\n\nAlexa, play me a LoFi ghazal\n\nNot only movie production houses, but music labels are also jumping on the bandwagon. With large catalogues of ghazals already in place, they are now trying to ï¬nd new ways to popularise them. Saregama Music released three volumes of albums titled âGhazal-eLoï¬â in February featuring Jagjit Singh, Chitra Singh, and Bhupinder Singh. LoFi is a form of audio production popular today because of its relaxing nature, and uses audio which is characterised by an unpolished sound quality. For the album, the label reached out to music composer Raahi about three months ago. âIt is an attempt to use the massive catalogue of songs and make it attractive for the new generation,â Raahi says.\n\nEnd of Article\n\nFOLLOW US ON SOCIAL MEDIA"
