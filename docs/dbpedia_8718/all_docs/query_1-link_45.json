        "text": "Every sane person knows at least one, two or more lines of poetry by heart. Every eloquent orator adorns his speeches with a few relevant lines of poetry. Every existent religion has preserved its salient teachings in the form of poetry. If religions shed poetry, they will vanish within a few decades. Poetry is beauty. Everything that touches human hearts is poetry. The full moon, the starry sky, the sunrise, the sunset, the morning breeze, the summer drizzle, the waterfall, the flowers, the chirping of birds, the ebb and tide of the sea, the dimple on a damsel’s chubby face, the smile on a baby’s lips, the sweat drops on the forehead of a bride, the blush on the face of a bashful lover, the tears of joy in the eyes of a student who has just checked his results, the colourful butterfly resting on the petals of a rose, the fragrance of flowers, the fleeting winter sun, the floating clouds, the calm deer in a lush green pasture, the valley surrounded by dense forests and flanked by roaring streams filled with crystal clear cold water, the melodious calls echoing from the rooftops of religious places— all are poetry. Poetry is art. Poetry is medicine. Poetry is food for the soul. Poetry is peace. Poetry is happiness. Poetry is magic. Poetry awakens oblivious and slumbered communities. Poetry calms down aggressive warriors and sheathes naked swords. Poetry melts stones and encourages the weak. Poetry brings tears in fierce eyes and decks withered lips with pretty smiles. Poetry is fire. Poetry is cool water too. Poetry is philosophy. Poetry is fun too. Poetry is taught by professors, quoted by leaders, sung by farmers, appreciated by teenagers, analyzed by philosophers and enjoyed by one and all. To sum up, poetry is a type of literature that uses language to convey experiences, feelings and consciousness. It’s a form of creative writing that can be found in cultures around the world. Poetry would not be a universal human practice if it did not serve large and various purposes. People have sung or chanted poems to sow and reap, court reluctant lovers, march into battle, lull infants to sleep and call the faithful to worship. Poetry gave humanity the words to get through life.\n\nA Brief History of Poetry\n\nThe art of poetry is as old as human beings themselves and predates written text. In other words, humans invented the writing system 5000 years ago in Mesopotamia, in modern-day Iraq, but poetry existed before it. The oldest surviving speculative fiction poem is the Tale of the Shipwrecked Sailor, written in Hieratic and ascribed a date around 2500 BCE. Some scholars claim that the oldest surviving epic poem is‘the Epic of Gilgamesh', dating from the 3rd millennium BCE. There are more such ancient poems listed below:\n\n1) The Istanbul Tablet #2461: Dating 2000 BCE.\n\n2) The Story of Sinuhe: An Egyptian epic poetry from around 1800 BCE.\n\n3) The Iliad and the Odyssey: Ancient Greek epic poems attributed to Homer.\n\n4) Avestan books (the Yasna): Persian religious texts.\n\n5) Virgil's Aeneid: Roman national epic, written between 29 and 19 BCE.\n\n6) The Ramayana and the Mahabharata: Ancient Indian epics.\n\n7)The Shijing (Classic of Poetry): An ancient Chinese collection of poems dating back to the 11th to 7th centuries BCE.\n\n8) The Mu'allaqat: They are referred to as the \"Hanging Odes\" or \"Golden Odes.\" These are a collection of seven pre-Islamic Arabic poems highly esteemed for their eloquence and artistic expression.\n\nThe oldest European poet whose work is still widely read and appreciated today is Homer. Although the exact date of Homer's life is uncertain, it is generally believed that he lived around the 8th or 9th century BCE. Homer is traditionally credited with composing two of the greatest epic poems of ancient Greece: The Iliad and The Odyssey. Other notable poets of Europe from Homer to Geoffrey Chaucer include:\n\n1) Sappho (c. 630–570 BCE): Ancient Greek lyric poet known for her poems on love and relationships. she is often regarded as one of the greatest lyric poets of ancient Greece.\n\nPindar (c. 518–438 BCE): Ancient Greek lyric poet, particularly celebrated for his odes.\n\n2) Virgil (70–19 BCE): Roman poet, author of the epic poem \"Aeneid.\"\n\nHorace (65–8 BCE): Roman poet and satirist, known for works like \"Odes\" and \"Satires.\"\n\n3) Ovid (43 BCE–17/18 CE): Roman poet known for his works \"Metamorphoses\" and \"The Art of Love.\"\n\n4) Catullus (c. 84–54 BCE): Roman poet famous for his love poetry.\n\n5) Dante Alighieri (1265–1321): Italian poet, author of \"The Divine Comedy.\"\n\nChaucer, William Shakespeare, Wordsworth, Goethe etc were not even born when Muslim poets like Omar Khayyam (1048–1131), Ibn al-Farid (1181–1235), Hafez (1315–1390) and Rumi (1207–1273) took the world of poetry by storm. Their verses are not just literary expressions but also convey profound spiritual wisdom, exploring the themes of divine love, unity and the mystical journey. Alas! modern Muslims do not bother to know about their glorious past and rich heritage.\n\nMoreover, English literature is divided into three major periods: the Old English period (c. 500-1066 CE), the Middle English Period (1066-1500 CE), and the Modern English period (1500-2020). The Old English period is not worth mentioning. It consists mostly of religious and historical works. Most Old English poets are anonymous; only twelve of them are known by name from Medieval sources, but only four of those are known by their vernacular works to us today with any certainty: Caedmon, Bede, Alfred, and Cynewulf. Of these, only Caedmon, Bede, and Alfred have known biographies.\n\nCaedmon (658–680 AD)\n\nThe oldest poem in English literature is the 'Hymn of Creation' by Caedmon. Therefore, he is the first known writer in English literature.\n\nBede (673–735 AD)\n\nBede wrote scientific, historical and theological works. His best-known work is the \"Historia ecclesiastica gentis Anglorum,\" or \"An Ecclesiastical History of the English People.\"\n\nAlfred the Great (848–899 AD)\n\nThe title of \"the father of English prose\" has been assigned to several different men, including King Alfred the Great, Sir Francis Bacon, Sir John Mandeville, and John Wycliffe.\n\nCynewulf (9th century AD)\n\nHe is known for his four Christian poems, namely, 'The Fates of the Apostles,' 'Juliana,' 'Elene,' and 'Christ II' (also referred to as 'The Ascension').\n\nOther notable poems from the Old English period include:\n\nBeowulf\n\nAn Old English epic poem in the tradition of Germanic heroic legend consisting of 3,182 alliterative lines. It is one of the most important and most often translated works of Old English literature. Its poet is not known.\n\nThe Dream of the Rood\n\nThe Wanderer\n\nThe Battle of Maldon\n\nThe \"Battle of Brunanburh\"\n\nThe Seafarer\n\nThe Wife's Lament\n\nhe Ruin\n\nAndreas\n\nChrist and Satan\n\nDeor/The Lament of Deor\n\nThe real English poetry was written in the Middle and Modern English periods, and a student of English literature is supposed to read Geoffrey Chaucer, William Shakespeare, John Milton, William Wordsworth, Coleridge, Lord Byron, Shelley, Keats, Robert Browning, Emily Dickinson, W.B. Yeats, T.S. Eliot, Philip Larkin, Sylvia Plath, Ted Hughes and a few others. Some students enjoy reading the poetry of Emerson, H.W. Longfellow, Pablo Neruda, Goethe, Mirza Ghalib, Mir Taqi Mir, Allama Iqbal, Faiz Ahmed Faiz, Sarojini Naidu, Rabindranath Tagore, Kamala Das, Faraz, Jaun Elia, etc., too.\n\nSome amazing definitions of poetry\n\nPainting is silent poetry, and poetry is painting that speaks. (Plutarch)\n\nPoetry is nearer to vital truth than history. (Plato)\n\nPoetry is the art of uniting pleasure with truth. (Samuel Johnson)\n\nPoetry is thoughts that breathe, and words that burn. (Thomas Gray)\n\nPoetry is the spontaneous overflow of powerful feelings: it takes its origin from emotion recollected in tranquility. (William Wordsworth)\n\nPoetry is the best words in the best order.(Samuel Taylor Coleridge)\n\nOne merit of poetry few persons will deny: it says more and in fewer words than prose.(Voltaire)\n\nThe crown of literature is poetry. (W. Somerset Maugham)\n\nGenuine poetry can communicate before it is understood. (T. S. Eliot)\n\nPoetry is when an emotion has found its thought and the thought has found words. (Robert Frost)\n\nPoetry is a deal of joy and pain and wonder, with a dash of the dictionary. (Kahlil Gibran)\n\nPoetry is “the axe to break the frozen sea within us.” (Franz Kafka’s)\n\nGenres of poetry\n\nEpic Poetry\n\nLong narrative poems that often depict heroic deeds, adventures, and significant events. Examples include Homer's \"Iliad\" and \"Odyssey.\"\n\nLyric Poetry\n\nShort poems expressing personal emotions, feelings, or thoughts. It is often musical and introspective. Examples include sonnets and haikus.\n\nNarrative Poetry\n\nTells a story through verse, employing characters, plot, and other elements of storytelling. Examples include \"The Raven\" by Edgar Allan Poe.\n\nSonnet\n\n14-line poem, often with a specific rhyme scheme, expressing a single theme or idea. Shakespearean and Petrarchan sonnets are common forms.\n\nHaiku\n\nA traditional form of Japanese poetry with three lines and a 5-7-5 syllable count, capturing a moment or emotion in nature.\n\nLimerick\n\nA form of humorous verse with a distinctive rhythm and AABBA rhyme scheme, often used for light or humorous subjects.\n\nFree Verse\n\nPoetry without a fixed rhyme or meter, allowing for greater flexibility and creativity in expression.\n\nBlank Verse\n\nUnrhymed poetry with a regular meter, often iambic pentameter. Commonly used in dramatic and narrative works.\n\nSatirical Poetry\n\nUses humor, irony, or ridicule to criticize or mock people, politics, or society. Jonathan Swift's \"A Modest Proposal\" is an example.\n\nConcrete Poetry\n\nPoems in which the arrangement of words and letters on the page forms a visual representation of the subject. The visual presentation is integral to the poem's meaning.\n\nDoggerel, or doggrel\n\nIt is poetry that is irregular in rhythm and in rhyme, often deliberately for burlesque or comic effect.\n\nElegy\n\nA reflective and melancholic poem, often mourning the loss of someone or something. Thomas Gray's \"Elegy Written in a Country Churchyard\" is a famous example.\n\nOde:\n\nA lyric poem expressing strong emotions or praise, often addressed to a specific subject. John Keats's \"Ode to a Nightingale\" is a notable example.\n\nAcrostic Poetry\n\nVerses where the first letter of each line spells out a word or message vertically.\n\nBallad\n\nA narrative poem, often in a song-like form, that tells a story with a strong rhythmic and musical quality.\n\nProse poetry\n\nIt is a hybrid genre that shows attributes of both prose and poetry.\n\nGhazal\n\nA form of poetry with rhyming couplets and a repeating refrain, commonly used to express themes of love and loss in Middle Eastern and South Asian literature.\n\nVillanelle\n\nA pastoral or lyrical poem of nineteen lines, with only two rhymes throughout, and some lines repeated.
