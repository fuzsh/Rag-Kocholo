        "text": "Full Account of the Poetry\n\nReading on Jun 26, 2015\n\nPresent: Pamela, Joe, Talitha, KumKum, Priya, Ankush, Thommo, Kavita, Gopa\n\nAbsent: Vijay Govind (?), Preeti (out of town), Zakia (Ramadan), Govind Sethunath (out of town), CJ (out of town), Sunil (gone to Thrissur)\n\nNew Reader trying out: Shoba Cherian\n\nThe next reading for the novel Remains of the Day by Kazuo Ishiguro has been fixed\n\nfor Wed Jul 22, 2015.\n\n1. Pamela\n\nPamela chose to explore the ghazal form once more, this time it with Faiz Ahmed Faiz's Tum aaye ho na. Faiz was born in 1911 near Sialkot in Punjab in what is now Pakistan. He was brought up in a secular tradition of Islam by his father and went to a mission school, and later he studied Urdu, Persian, and English at the Government College, Lahore. He did his MA in English Lit in 1932 and also got a Master's degree in Arabic. In his college days he became a left-leaning member of the Communist Party.\n\nFaiz Ahmed Faiz\n\nHe married Alys, a British national (and Communist Party member) who was a co-student at the Government College, Lahore. They had two daughters. He was a lecturer and then a professor, first in Aligarh and then in Lahore. During the war he joined the British Indian Army, but was given a desk job. He opted for Pakistan at Independence. In 1947 he became editor of the Pakistan Times. He was arrested in 1951 in the Rawalpindi Conspiracy Case and came under a cloud.\n\nHe published his first literary work in 1947. In his lifetime he wrote eight books and received many prizes, including the Lenin Peace Prize. As a revolutionary poet he was against tyranny and dictatorship, and never compromised. Political themes occur in his poetry. He suffered greatly for his leftist inclinations and went to jail and later was in exile in UK for a while. He returned and prospered under Z.A. Bhutto's regime but came under a cloud again when Bhutto was executed by Zia ul Haq's regime. He died a broken man in 1984.\n\nFaiz has been a great figure in the arts and literature, and is highly esteemed on both sides of the border. Vikram Seth who loves Faiz translated a couple of shers movingly:\n\nRaat yuN dil meiN terikhoyi hui yaad aayi,\n\nJaise viraane meiN chupke se bahaar aa jaye,\n\nJaise sahraon meiN haule se chale baad-ae-naseem,\n\nJaise bimaar ko be-wajaah qaraar aa jaaye.\n\nLast night your faded memory came to me\n\nAs in the wilderness spring comes quietly,\n\nAs, slowly, in the desert, moves the breeze,\n\nAs, to a sick man, without cause, comes peace.\n\n(translation taken from the collection Mappings, the very first authored by Vikram Seth and published by P. Lal from the Writers Workshop, Calcutta)\n\nPamela mentioned that much of the ghazal is symbolic of the poet's imprisonment and loss of freedom. Indeed it opens with a line that speaks of the dawn (freedom) never appearing no matter how long one waits. After reciting the ghazal in Urdu Pamela sang it for us, in the Tarannum style, as she said. This provoked instant applause. Joe asked where is Takhallus in the last sher, the customary mention of the author's name or pen-name? It's missing. Joe also asked if the interpretation of this ghazal as being about imprisonment and freedom is supported. Pamela replied yes, just look at the last sher\n\nQafas se aaj sabaa be-qaraar guzri hai\n\nthe breeze passed by the prison today in disquiet\n\nBut love too is about enslavement, is it not?\n\n2. Kavita\n\nThis being the monsoon season in Kerala, Kavita (and later Priya) took up poems with rain as the theme. Kavita's is from The Crescent Moon collection of Rabindranath and the poem is called The Rainy Day. It paints a scene when the rain is slashing down on a village near the river and describes all the things that happen: palm trees bending, crows sitting bedraggled, the cows lowing, the fishermen rushing about catching fish in the ponds – and a child who only wishes to run out and experience the thrill of the rain.\n\nRabindranath Tagore\n\nKumKum said Rabindranath has many poems about the rain. Priya liked the appearance of the laughing boy in the poem. It's true to life. Someone asked if the child who is being admonished not to go out, actually stayed indoors. The consensus was it is too difficult to keep children indoors in the rain, especially in in the countryside. Shoba mentioned a comparison with 'Nia.'\n\nA few points about the translation. 'Fishes' is inappropriate in this context as the plural; fish would do. 'Ford' is a place in the river so shallow you can walk across; the word 'ghat' or pier might have been more right. Crows are more likely to have 'bedraggled' wings than draggled ones as a result of the rain.\n\n3. Shoba Cherian\n\nShoba, attending her first session at KRG, was introduced by Thommo. She teaches French at the Rajagiri School, and chose a poem by Jacques Prévert which is often set for school syllabi since it has simple vocabulary, but the surface simplicity is deceptive. It's an impish poem, capable of interpretation in several ways. Children are getting a look-in at adult behaviour.\n\nJacques Prévert\n\nShoba was going to read line-by-line from the French and have the readers decipher the meaning with her help, but they requested her to provide the all-important sound and rhythm of the whole poem by reading it before explicating.\n\nThe poem ends with an ignored person, most probably a woman, crying:\n\nEt moi j'ai pris\n\nMa tête dans ma main\n\nEt j'ai pleuré.\n\nJoe advanced the notion that this is a woman in a restaurant who was completely ignored by a man at a nearby table. She observed him closely having a coffee and a cigarette, and then leaving, without so much as a glance in her direction:\n\nSans une parole\n\nSans me regarder\n\nThis would have been galling to her, if she was vain and considered herself attractive. Others gave different interpretations of the human situation: two people who had had a quarrel the night before, ignoring each other next morning at breakfast. Or maybe it symbolises the end a whole relationship.\n\nHere's a short wordless prize-winning film on the poem, which supports the quarrel theory, but breaks with the poem in having the man look once fleetingly at the woman:\n\nThe restaurant theory is elaborated in this short\n\nBut the best voice I heard on the Web for this poem is here:\n\nWhen Shoba asked a student in her class how she felt about such silences, the child replied that it was fine so long as it was the father remaining silent at breakfast (he generally ignored her anyway), but if her mother failed to chat with her it would be very sad.\n\nHere's a page with plenty of links (some of which misfire) that pays homage to this Parisian poet:\n\nAnd now for a short bio of the poet taken from the Web:\n\nJacques Prévert, France's most widely read poet since Victor Hugo, was born in Paris in 1900. He left school in 1915 and worked at various jobs until 1920 when he served in the military in Lorraine and with the French occupation forces in Turkey.\n\nIn 1925 he began to associate with the surrealists, including André Breton and Louis Aragon. \"Expelled\" from this group by Breton in 1930, because of his \"occupation or character\", he responded with a savage satirical attack on Breton, titled \"Death of a Gentleman\". His first poems were published in the same year, and in 1931 there appeared his first major success: \"Attempt to Describe a Dinner of Heads in Paris - France\", subsequently published in the collection Paroles.\n\nIn the 1930s he worked with a theatre company, the \"October Group\", linked to the Communist Party though not always reflecting the Party's views. In 1933 he attended the International Workers' Theatre Olympiad in Moscow for the première of his play, \"The Battle of Fontenoy\". In the same years he began writing film scripts, his first film (\"It's In The Bag\") appearing in 1932.\n\nParoles, Prévert's first collection of poetry, appeared late in 1945. Patched together by René Bertelé from forgotten newspapers and reviews, cabaret songs, and scribblings from the backs of envelopes and the paper tablecloths of cafés, Paroles is widely considered Prévert's best work. By the mid-1960s more than a million copies of it and other collections of his poems were in print.\n\nJacques Prévert died of lung cancer in 1977. Two further poetry collections, Soleil de nuit (1980) and La cinquième saison (1984) were published posthumously.\n\n4. Talitha\n\nTalitha chose a war poet of WWI who is different from the other poets of that war. This poet first came to her notice when she read the first two lines of the poem as an epigraph in some other context:\n\nI have a rendezvous with Death\n\nAt some disputed barricade,\n\nHere is a bio from the Poetry Foundation web site:\n\nAlan Seeger’s promising poetic career (1888 – 1916) was cut short when he died serving in the French Foreign Legion during World War I. He is best known for his war poem, I Have a Rendezvous with Death, and has often been compared with Rupert Brooke, a contemporary English soldier-poet who also died in World War I. Brooke too idealised war and was equally handsome, seducing quite a few girls before he went off to gain glory at the front.\n\nAlan Seeger\n\nSeeger has been criticized for his impersonal, conventional, and idealising verses, but critics acknowledge these as being the weaknesses of youth. James Hart in the Dictionary of Literary Biography explained, “He needed more time to move from a stock and outmoded romanticism to a more distinctive and original style, from a style full of abstractions to one more concrete and personal.”The son of a businessman, Alan Seeger was born June 22, 1888, in New York City, and grew up in a wealthy and cultured home in Staten Island. His sister, Elizabeth, and brother, Charles (who became a noted musicologist), were close in age. Seeger attended the Staten Island Academy and then the Horace Mann School in Manhattan until the age of twelve. His family then moved to Mexico City; in 1902 Alan returned with his brother Charles to New York to attend the Hackley School, in Tarrytown. Following his graduation from the Hackley School, Seeger attended Harvard University, where, as a budding poet, he was influenced by the Romantic poets while other fresh poets at Harvard, such as T.S. Eliot, who was experimenting with more modern verse. He also translated Dante and Ariosto and helped edit the Harvard Monthly, where he published many of his poems. He graduated from Harvard with a BA in 1910.After graduating, Seeger moved to Greenwich Village in New York City. There he attempted to live out his romanticized notion of bohemian life, living wholly through the senses (as opposed to the mind). His father was not pleased. Still, Seeger continued writing poetry and slept on the couch of his classmate and notorious revolutionary, John Reed. After two years Seeger decided New York did not live up to his ideals so, with funding from admiring friends, he left for Paris.In Paris, Seeger reveled in his new friendships among the artists in the Latin Quarter. He found his ideals of beauty embodied by the city. There is also evidence that he fell in love, in the poems Do You Remember Once and The Rendezvous. When war broke out between France and Germany in 1914, Seeger enlisted in the French Foreign Legion to defend his beloved France.Apparently seeking the utmost of excitement in life, Seeger also had a fatalistic streak, and seemed attracted to the possibility of dying. Victor Chapman, in Victor Chapman’s Letters from France, questioned Seeger’s emotional state before joining the Legion: “Seeger was an appalling wreck before the war.” In his letters, Seeger told of crowded quarters, filth, cold and misery; but only his romantic views of the war make their way into his poetry, unlike that of more realistic and anti-war poets such as Wilfred Owen and Siegfried Sassoon. His admiration for Sir Philip Sidney and familiarity with the age of chivalry caused him to cast his comrades as mediaeval crusaders. Ever a fatalist, the outcome of the war was of less interest to Seeger than the glory of comradeship and adventure.Seeger’s poem I Have a Rendezvous with Death tells of an expected meeting between the narrator and Death himself. Though the narrator of the poem regrets leaving behind life’s pleasures and love, he does not fear or abhor death. Instead he is stoic, making the rendezvous a matter of honor. Hart described the curious relationship between the narrator and Death: “The union of fallen soldier and Death is, not based upon any profound philosophical or religious belief, but upon a vague romantic fusion of nature’s beauty, sexual love, and life in some undefined other realm.” His Ode in Memory of the American Volunteers Fallen for France is considered less self-aggrandizing and egocentric, and therefore a stronger work, but Rendezvous remained more famous. In 1916, Seeger died (ironically on July 4th) in the attack on Belloy-en-Santerre, where he was shot in the stomach. Following his death, the French military awarded him the Croix de Guerre and the Medaille Militaire. He was buried in a mass grave.Seeger’s collected Poems were published in 1917 to mixed reviews. Critics often find that Seeger had not yet matured as an artist, displaying too much of his enthusiasm for the Romantic poets. H.F. Armstrong, in Dial, compared Seeger to his contemporary Rupert Brooke, and laments that the two poets did not live long enough to realize their potential:\n\nA large part of the poems in this volume can reasonably well stand on their strictly literary merits. . . . We like to think that if Rupert Brooke had lived he would have eliminated from his final volume some of the unnecessary gaucheries of expression, as well as some of the unworthy compositions which were rushed into print under the impulse of the sudden fame brought about by his death. The same thought occurs in the case of Alan Seeger.\n\nStill, Seeger’s poetry remained popular throughout the war with soldiers in the trenches and with supporters at home. The French have particularly honoured Seeger as a poet who memorialised the fighting that took place in their country during World War I, and they have published numerous tributes to him since his death.\n\nHe died on the 4th of July 1916. There's a monument in Paris dedicated to the American volunteers, and it's based on Seeger's likeness.\n\nLet us consider this poem to see if it suffers in its expression, or its sentiment, from some alleged 'immaturity' which critics from on high would like to vilify. The poem is shot through, not with a longing for death, but with a premonition; yet there's uncertainty –\n\nIt may be I shall pass him still.\n\nSo far from a longing for death, it is the descriptions of what the poet could be leaving behind that move him\n\nWhen Spring brings back blue days and fair\n\nwhich is a beautiful phrase, repeated again in the image:\n\nWhen Spring comes round again this year\n\nAnd the first meadow-flowers appear.\n\nThe last para provides a stark contrast between where he'd rather be (Pillowed in silk and scented down) and the soldier's fateful knowledge that death rides with him to the front – as indeed it did for Alan Seeger and other soldiers in WWI. There's no silly romanticising of glorious death in war; this poem expresses a yearning from the barricades for beauty, which will be crushed by the fighting soldier's constant companion, death.\n\nHere's a hushed recitation of the poem:\n\nAnd here is the much-loved folk singer Pete Seeger (1919 – 2014), nephew of the poet Alan Seeger as it turns out, reciting the poem:\n\n5. Joe\n\nJoe, having discovered a new poem from Norman Mailer, burst into it with great éclat, but first took care to provide the OED etymology of the word 'fuck' in order to get a precise understanding of a word NM so relishes that he has been called the 'Talmudist of Fucking,' by the critic Alfred Kazin.\n\nNorman Mailer\n\nIt comes from Dutch 'fokken', to mock, to strike, to beget children. In Norwegian 'fokke' means to copulate. Old Icelandic 'fjuka' means to be driven by a storm. Middle High German 'fochen' is to hiss, to blow. One of the first usage examples given in the OED from 1719 is this:\n\nShe'd dance and she'd caper as wild as a Buck\n\nAnd told Tom the Tinker she would have some fuck.\n\nMailer’s gifts of imagination and force of expression are everywhere on display in his prose. One day Joe was sitting in the town library in Arlington, close to his daughter's place (Rachel) and picked up an edited volume of about 700 letters of Mailer. Skipping through them he came across an ardent one to a woman called Norris Church, dated Sep 12, 1975. He gathered later on the correspondent was to become Mailer's sixth and last wife, the one to whom he remained married to the end, the one who kept his brood of children by sundry other marriages together. A picture of her shows a woman of great beauty, the kind you associate with the vivacious American movie stars of the fifties.\n\nNorris Church\n\nWell, here is Norman Mailer writing, five years before they were married, to his future wife. All Joe did was to lineate and rearrange the words, and compress it to half its length. It was a poem singing out on its own without assistance from anyone. Joe admits he cut into Mailer’s flamboyant speech without bowdlerising him, however; the original had 8 occurrences of the word ‘fuck’, the poem has only 3, and as for the one c-word in the letter it lurks somewhere in the poem. Incidentally, this was the world premiere recital of this poem.\n\nBio:Norman Mailer is a famous American writer of the second half of the twentieth century, contemporary with a great number of well-known writers - Gore Vidal, Truman Capote, William Faulkner, Saul Bellow, Philip Roth, John Updike, and so on. He was born in 1923 in New Jersey and raised in Brooklyn. He wrote twelve novels over 59 years, the first being, The Naked andthe Dead, about his time in the military in WWII. It was a best seller. This was followed by Barbary Shore (1951) and The Deer Park (1955). He was a prolific essayist and journalist for hire. and a confirmed letter-writer of over 40,000 letters. He was also a boxer and a boxing enthusiast who covered the Ali-Foreman fight in Kinshasa, Zaire, in 1974 based on which he wrote a novel The Fight in 1975. He was often seen on TV and in one of the chat shows where he was a guest along with Gore Vidal he headbutted Vidal for criticising him in print. Vidal’s response was icy: ‘Once again words fail Norman Mailer’, he said. But in fact words never failed Mailer – he was exuberant in his prose.\n\nMailer did come out with two volumes of verse, Death for the Ladies (and Other Disasters) and Modest Gifts: Poems and Drawings, but they were slight and lacking in effort according to people who dismissed them as the trivia of a prose-writer unable to devote himself to the Muse of poetry, Calliope. Here are a couple of samples from these volumes:\n\nListenmy lovethe houris latemy sidehas anacheIfyou don'tget ataximy heartwill break.― DeathsForTheLadies\n\nModest Gifts: Poems and Drawings is a book of his selected poems and a hundred of his drawings.\n\n6. KumKum\n\nCome time to select a poet KumKum gets nervous, for there is a standing joke about Rita Dove, the poet she chose once, whom Joe characterised as a poet not to love. Dana Gioia came to her notice through a free issue of a literary magazine that was floating around at one the American airports, probably Boston. A poem of his seemed promising, and then KumKum read more and was convinced she had her poet. Mr Gioia, born in 1950, was raised in California. After graduating from Stanford, he did his Master's in Comparative literature from Harvard, before returning to Stanford to do his MBA.\n\nDana Gioia\n\nThere followed a life in business and commerce for fifteen years in which he rose to be VP of General Foods. Then he resigned and dedicated himself full-time to writing and the arts. He is a poet first, but also writes critical essays. An essay that became rather famous is a defence of poetry, published in the May 1991 issue of Atlantic Monthly titled Can Poetry Matter?:\n\nIt elicited a huge reader response, both positive and negative. Gioa has published several books; the first collection of his poems was titled Pity the Beautiful.\n\nKumKum said she chose Gioia's poems which turn upon the simple things of life. They appeal to you and need for their appreciation neither a dictionary, nor any learned exegesis. They are mostly rhymed.\n\nIn the first one we have the curious case of flowers that have arrived and nobody knows for whom or why; they sit around\n\n… and we can'tthrow out a gift we've never owned\n\nThe next one is a true rain poem, as it meditates on an event from long ago which also happened on a rainy day. It was raining cataracts outside the rented wedding hall, the poet and his woman friend were invitees of the bride and groom. They stole a few moments from the main event and stepped out in the patio to enjoy the summer rain and some inexplicable intimacy occurred. He wonders\n\nWhy does that evening's memoryReturn with this night's storm –\n\nIt reflects the thought of Faiz in his ghazal:\n\nRaat yuN dil meiN teri khoyi hui yaad aayi,\n\nJaise viraane meiN chupke se bahaar aa jaye,\n\nGioia was chairman of the National Endowment for the Arts, the U.S. government's arts agency from January 2003 until January 2009. In August 2011, Gioia became Judge Widney Professor of Poetry and Public Culture at the University of Southern California where he now teaches. For more see the wiki entry:\n\n7. Gopa\n\nGopa chose to read from Vikram Seth's Beastly Tales. KumKum and Joe were present at the release of a new illustrated edition in Delhi two years ago:\n\nYou can look up that entry for the account of a wonderful evening when the master himself entertained us with readings from five of the tales and interspersed his remarks with much humour and humane knowledge.\n\nWhile many of the tales have morals they are not explicit always, and you can find failings in the so-called heroic animals too. When a person asked VS if he had any words of encouragement for young writers, his apposite reply was not to get put off by the frogs of the world; VS drew attention to the frog’s ironical critique at the end about the nightingale’s song:\n\n… she should have known\n\nThat your song must be your own.\n\n“Use your own voice,” therefore.\n\nVikram Seth, when he was younger\n\nThe tales are fast paced and appealing to children because they are rhymed. VS uses an extensive vocabulary, so children will learn new words and expressions, and will delight in his nimble versification. Vikram Seth truly needs no introduction to our readers. What's new from him is a collection of his verse coming after 25 years (if you discount The Rivered Earth), titled Summer Requiem, released in UK in Feb 2015, and due to be published by Aleph in India in Oct 2015:\n\nVikram Seth has revealed how the collapse of a long-term relationship with French violinist Philippe Honoré contributed to “periods of darkness” that have delayed his sequel to A Suitable Boy.\n\nDespite being offered more than £1m by his publisher for A Suitable Girl in 2009, Seth suffered writer’s block and turned to poetry to cope with the trauma of his split from Honoré, the inspiration for Seth’s 1999 novel An Equal Music.\n\n“It [the split] was a loss of love and it really affected me,” says Seth, who negotiated his way out of the Penguin contract before signing another with rival Orion.\n\nReflecting on the healing nature of poetry as he publishes Summer Requiem, Seth says: “Poetry is there to console, amuse or enlighten. Yes, it is true that you are more likely to write when things are bad …\n\nThe revised date for the release of A Suitable Girl by Orion is some time in 2017. He is actively at work on that.\n\n8. Ankush\n\nThe following history of Esther Morgan, the poet, is taken from:\n\nEsther Morgan is the author of three books of poetry, of which the third, Grace, was shortlisted for the TS Eliot Prize in 2011. Her poetry is subtle, quiet, delicately paced.\n\nEsther Morgan was born in 1970 in Kidderminster, Worcestershire. After a childhood of writing poetry, she took it up again seriously in her early twenties, while working as a volunteer at the Wordsworth Trust in Grasmere, Cumbria. An MA in Creative Writing at the University of East Anglia followed in 1997, and she received an Eric Gregory Award (for promising poets under 30) in 1998.\n\nEsther Morgan\n\nAfter taking part in an exchange program with Edith Cowan University in Perth, Australia, she returned to UEA and edited four editions of the poetry anthology Reactions.Her first collection, Beyond Calling Distance, was published by Bloodaxe in 2001; it won the Aldeburgh First Collection Prize and was shortlisted for the John Llewellyn Rhys Prize. Its poems are full of silence, with short lines and spare stanzas surrounded by reverberating white space.\n\nShe’s lost a wordand searches for it everywhere\n\n(The Lost Word)\n\nThe silence leaves mewith something just beyond my reach\n\n(Nocturne)\n\nAll summer she listened to the heat-stilled world,her thumb resting on the rusted bell\n\n(Last Summer)\n\nThey’re full of people who struggle to speak, to give themselves a self to speak with. In ‘Self Portrait’:\n\nShe is drawing and redrawing herself,her skin sore from erasure.\n\nThere is a sense of space – wide landscapes, and time, and the smallness of people within them, intensified by close attention to prosodic detail.The Silence Living in Houses, her second collection, came out with Bloodaxe in 2005 – inspired by time spent as caretaker of an un-renovated Edwardian house in Goring-on-Thames, Oxfordshire. Houses have spirits, and in this collection the poet both wonders about and then invents a ghost:\n\nI am making a ghost for this houseso I can sleep safe at night, her footsteps light on the stairs . . .\n\n(Self-possession)\n\nEsther Morgan has written of being interested in the “hidden lives” that occupy a space. Mystery, not knowing, is also a kind of enclosure. The atmosphere is almost tangible, and the poems are completely assured.In 2010, she won the Bridport Poetry Prize for her poem ‘This Morning’, which appeared in book form the following year in her third collection, Grace (Bloodaxe). Grace was a Poetry Book Society Recommendation, and was shortlisted for the T.S. Eliot Prize.In the title poem, the vase – with its “cut flowers” – “or the thought of them” signals the mystery of the difference between inside and outside. The light is fading;\n\nIn the stillness, everything becomes itself: the circle of white plates on the kitchen table the serious chairs that attend themeven the roses on the papered walls seem to open a little wider.\n\n(Grace)\n\nCurrently Esther Morgan is combining freelance teaching and editing work, and her role as Historic Recordings Manager for the Poetry Archive, the world's largest online collection of poets reading their own work, and working on her next collection.After four years in Oxfordshire, she moved back to East Anglia, and now lives in Suffolk.\n\n9. Priya\n\nHenry Wadsworth Longfellow (1807 – 1882) was an American poet, born in Maine. He taught in Bowdoin College, Maine, and later at Harvard College, Massachusetts. He is among the five 'Fireside Poets', all New Englanders whose work became very popular in America . They all wrote in metre in rhymed stanzas, facilitating memorisation by students. The others in the group were Holmes, Whittier, Bryant, and Lowell. Longfellow retired in 1854 and lived in Cambridge, MA, to have time for his writing. His home on Brattle Street is now a museum (KumKum and Joe have visited it more than once). His first wife died as a result of a miscarriage and he was distraught. Many years later he pursued his suit with a woman called Fanny Appleton, who took seven years to say 'Yes' and that yielded the one and only love poem from Longfellow's pen, The Evening Star. His wife gave birth to six children, but the sad event of an accidental fire to her dress brought her life to a close, and left the poet quite desolate.\n\nHenry Wadsworth Longfellow\n\nDuring his lifetime critics accused Longfellow of imitating European exemplars, and writing for the masses.\n\nLongfellow translated Dante's Divine Comedy over several years, and published it in 1867; thereafter he continually revised it. Longfellow wrote in many forms: free verse, blank verse, hexameters, sonnets, heroic couplets, and sonnets. One of his very popular poems, The Song of Hiawatha, sold over 50,000 copies in just 3 years. Longfellow became lionised as a poet, the most popular poet in America, and it was common for him to earn upwards of $3,000 for a single published poem in 1874. Compare that with what one of the most prestigious magazines, The New Yorker, pays for a 36-line poem, 150 years later: just $460 (http://www.mhpbooks.com/how-much-does-the-new-yorker-pay-its-poets/ )\n\nTo read more about Longfellow go to the wiki site\n\nPriya chose a rain poem by Longfellow (How Beautiful is the Rain) to commemorate the present monsoon season. It is full of quiet descriptions of rain effects, yet does not come alive or leap off the page. But we in Kochi do enjoy the rain.\n\n10. Thommo\n\nThommo looked for Larkin and stumbled across Pete Crowley who was an assistant to Larkin in his life, at the Library, perhaps where Larkin worked. Joe said he read that Larkin will get a stone memorial in Westminster Abbey's Poets Corner, but it's unlikely to have his most famous lines inscribed upon it: They fuck you up, your mum and dad. See\n\nThommo was attracted to the poem A biker's funeral. The description reflects how the poet (a biker himself?) was moved to see fellow bikers gathered to honour one of their own:\n\nWho will forget this funeral? Four hundred strong in the nave we stood, family and friends both young and old and a phalanx of bikers in leathers and boots.\n\n…\n\nWho will forget that send-off from\n\nhis fellow bikers when three score\n\nor more bright gleaming motorcycles\n\nwith a thunderous roar led off the hearse?\n\nThe other poem by Pete Crowley (his name does not bring up anything on the Web about the poet) is a student's recollection of Larkin after having to read Larkin's poetry at the university.\n\nPhilip Larkin\n\nThe familiar face comes to the poet's mind, then a dream, and Larkin's fear of death. It's a tossed-off poem. Nothing profound, just bits and pieces of memories, like the aspidistra plant and the gravestone and the Earl Grey tea he drank out porcelain cups (KumKum will approve the cups).\n\nThe Poems\n\n1. Faiz Ahmed Faiz(1911 – 1984)\n\nTum aaye ho na shab-e-intezar guzri haiTalaash mein hai sahar, bar bar guzri hai\n\nJunoon mein jitni bhi guzri, bakaar guzri haiAgarcheh dil pe kharabi hazar guzri hai\n\nHuii hai hazrat-e-naaseh se guftguu jis shabWoh shab zaruur sar-e-koo-e-yaar guzri hai\n\nWoh baat saare fasaaneh mein jis ka zikra na thaWoh baat unko bahut naagavaar guzri hai\n\nNa gul khile hein, na un se mile, na mai pii haiAjeeb rung mein ab ke bahaar guzri hai\n\nChaman mein ghaarat-e-gulchiin se jaane kya guzriQafas se aaj sabaa be-qaraar guzri hai\n\nTranslation\n\nNeither have you come, nor has this night of waiting come to an endin your search, the dawn has passed by again and again\n\nAll the nights spent in the madness of obsession, have been purposefully spentalthough this heart has been afflicted thousands of time\n\nThe night I had to listen to the exalted preacher’s discoursethat night must have been spent in the lane of the beloved\n\nWhat was not mentioned even once in the whole talethat has turned out to be most disagreeable to her\n\nNo flowers have bloomed, couldn’t meet her, did not get to taste winein strange colors, has this spring passed\n\nWhat grief the garden had to bear due to the flower plucker’s ravagingthe breeze passed by the prison today in disquiet.\n\n2. Rabindranth Tagore(1861 – 1941)\n\nThe Rainy Day (from collection The Crescent Moon)\n\nSULLEN CLOUDS are gathering fast over the black fringe of the forest.\n\nO child, do not go out!\n\nThe palm trees in a row by the lake are smiting their heads against the dismal sky; the crows with their draggled wings are silent on the tamarind branches, and the eastern bank of the river is haunted by a deepening gloom.\n\nOur cow is lowing loud, tied at the fence.\n\nO child, wait here till I bring her into the stall.\n\nMen have crowded into the flooded field to catch the fishes as they escape from the overflowing ponds; the rainwater is running in rills through the narrow lanes like a laughing boy who has run away from his mother to tease her.\n\nListen, someone is shouting for the boatman at the ford.\n\nO child, the daylight is dim, and the crossing at the ferry is closed.\n\nThe sky seems to ride fast upon the madly-rushing rain; the water in the river is loud and impatient; women have hastened home early from the Ganges with their filled pitchers.\n\nThe evening lamps must be made ready.\n\nO child, do not go out!\n\nThe road to the market is desolate, the lane to the river is slippery.\n\nThe wind is roaring and struggling among the bamboo branches like a wild beast tangled in a net.\n\n3.

Norman Mailer(1923 – 2007)\n\nGorgeous Bitch\n\nYour hair is as red as the last of sunset\n\nOn a hot summer night,\n\nYour eyes are the golden umber of the last rare\n\ncloud before it darkens.\n\nMy sailboat's bucking\n\nLike a horse in a steeplechase,\n\nIt's storming and caroming\n\nAs if it's going to tip over;\n\nBut it's you rolling me over\n\nAs if I'm steeped in tea,\n\nSometimes fucking, or even\n\nJust holding me.\n\nI can close my eyes and feel you\n\nAs a rich real presence in my arms\n\nYour hair, your aura – it's orange and red,\n\nThe rose-red waves rippling off your heart;\n\nI see into your emotions and feel\n\nThe true woman there, big as her heart and her love\n\nWhich could grow strong as a fire –\n\nAnd wrathful if ever I betray it!\n\nWhat a marvelous big girl you are,\n\nI feel the cool in the center of your fire\n\nThat quenches the heat in me.\n\nWhen you kissed me in the cab\n\nIt was like discovering the taste of flesh and fruit.\n\nYour lips have changed:\n\nOnce they were sweet, ardent, and hungry,\n\nBut simple. Now I can't have enough of your mouth\n\nYour full, wanton mouth;\n\nThe fruit-meats of your lips mock me\n\nTelling the stories of where they've been,\n\nAll of the woman in you comes in at the mouth,\n\nComes like sin at the mouth,\n\nYour soul shaking like a leaf\n\nIn the sweet eye of your slit\n\nWhose welcome sets the wet wings astir\n\nTo leave me floating up to your fuck storm.\n\nOh, you gorgeous bitch, something's happened,\n\nWe've forged a taste for each other\n\nA taste that's clean and free,\n\nCaring neither of love nor not-love,\n\nSo now we can be free of each other\n\nFor, a part of our bodies would want to stick and fuck,\n\nCoupling in the sunlight from dawn,\n\nAnd all the tender red of your heart\n\nBleeds through my closed eyes in sweet choices –\n\nShould we fornicate, french-kiss, tickle our napes,\n\nOr lie in that blessed simmer of love,\n\nHalf asleep for hours, glued each to the other's spine?\n\nLet's use each other up,\n\nWe could fuck up the fucking, or fly into storms,\n\nDisagree on who we should be –\n\nBut together we'll discover the arts of living ...\n\nWoman, I know you are equal to me,\n\nAs bad, as good, as brave, as dumb\n\nAnd as full of sugar ...\n\nSoon I'll be there to collect on this poem,\n\nTo turn the lights down and fan the fire of your ardor.\n\n6. Dana Gioia (b. 1950)\n\nThanks for Remembering Us\n\nThe flowers sent here by mistake,\n\nsigned with a name that no one knew,\n\nare turning bad. What shall we do?\n\nOur neighbor says they're not for her,\n\nand no one has a birthday near.\n\nWe should thank someone for the blunder.\n\nIs one of us having an affair?\n\nAt first we laugh, and then we wonder.\n\nThe iris was the first to die,\n\nenshrouded in its sickly-sweet\n\nand lingering perfume. The roses\n\nfell one petal at a time,\n\nand now the ferns are turning dry.\n\nThe room smells like a funeral,\n\nbut there they sit, too much at home,\n\naccusing us of some small crime,\n\nlike love forgotten, and we can't\n\nthrow out a gift we've never owned.\n\nSummer Storm\n\nWe stood on the rented patio\n\nWhile the party went on inside.\n\nYou knew the groom from college.\n\nI was a friend of the bride.\n\nWe hugged the brownstone wall behind us\n\nTo keep our dress clothes dry\n\nAnd watched the sudden summer storm\n\nFloodlit against the sky.\n\nThe rain was like a waterfall\n\nOf brilliant beaded light,\n\nCool and silent as the stars\n\nThe storm hid from the night.\n\nTo my surprise, you took my arm–\n\nA gesture you didn't explain–\n\nAnd we spoke in whispers, as if we two\n\nMight imitate the rain.\n\nThen suddenly the storm receded\n\nAs swiftly as it came.\n\nThe doors behind us opened up.\n\nThe hostess called your name.\n\nI watched you merge into the group,\n\nAloof and yet polite.\n\nWe didn't speak another word\n\nExcept to say goodnight.\n\nWhy does that evening's memory\n\nReturn with this night's storm–\n\nA party twenty years ago,\n\nIts disappointments warm?\n\nThere are so many might have beens,\n\nWhat ifs that won't stay buried,\n\nOther cities, other jobs,\n\nStrangers we might have married.\n\nAnd memory insists on pining\n\nFor places it never went,\n\nAs if life would be happier\n\nJust by being different.\n\nThe Sunday News\n\nLooking for something in the Sunday paper,\n\nI flipped by accident through Local Weddings,\n\nYet missed the photograph until I saw\n\nyour name among the headings.\n\nAnd there you were, looking almost unchanged,\n\nYour hair still long, though now long out of style,\n\nAnd you still wore that stiff and serious look\n\nYou called a smile.\n\nI felt as though we sat there face to face.\n\nMy stomach tightened. I read the item through.\n\nIt said too much about both families,\n\nToo little about you.\n\nFinished at last, I threw the paper down,\n\nStung by jealousy, my mind aflame,\n\nHating this man, this stranger whom you loved,\n\nThis printed name.\n\nAnd yet I clipped it out to put away\n\nInside a book like something I might use,\n\nA scrap I knew I wouldn't read again\n\nBut couldn't bear to lose.\n\nUnsaid\n\nSo much of what we live goes on inside–\n\nThe diaries of grief, the tongue-tied aches\n\nOf unacknowledged love are no less real\n\nFor having passed unsaid. What we conceal\n\nIs always more than what we dare confide.\n\nThink of the letters that we write our dead.\n\n7. Vikram Seth(b. 1952)\n\nThe Nightingale and the Frog\n\nOnce upon a time a frog\n\nCroaked away in Bingle Bog\n\nEvery night from dusk to dawn\n\nHe croaked awn and awn and awn\n\nOther creatures loathed his voice,\n\nBut, alas, they had no choice,\n\nAnd the crass cacophony\n\nBlared out from the sumac tree\n\nAt whose foot the frog each night\n\nMinstrelled on till morning night\n\nNeither stones nor prayers nor sticks.\n\nInsults or complaints or bricks\n\nStilled the frogs determination\n\nTo display his heart's elation.\n\nBut one night a nightingale\n\nIn the moonlight cold and pale\n\nPerched upon the sumac tree\n\nCasting forth her melody\n\nDumbstruck sat the gaping frog\n\nAnd the whole admiring bog\n\nStared towards the sumac, rapt,\n\nAnd, when she had ended, clapped,\n\nDucks had swum and herons waded\n\nTo her as she serenaded\n\nAnd a solitary loon\n\nWept, beneath the summer moon.\n\nToads and teals and tiddlers, captured\n\nBy her voice, cheered on, enraptured:\n\n\"Bravo! \" \"Too divine! \" \"Encore! \"\n\nSo the nightingale once more,\n\nQuite unused to such applause,\n\nSang till dawn without a pause.\n\nNext night when the Nightingale\n\nShook her head and twitched her tail,\n\nClosed an eye and fluffed a wing\n\nAnd had cleared her throat to sing\n\nShe was startled by a croak.\n\n\"Sorry - was that you who spoke? \"\n\nShe enquired when the frog\n\nHopped towards her from the bog.\n\n\"Yes,\" the frog replied. \"You see,\n\nI'm the frog who owns this tree\n\nIn this bog I've long been known\n\nFor my splendid baritone\n\nAnd, of course, I wield my pen\n\nFor Bog Trumpet now and then\"\n\n\"Did you… did you like my song? \"\n\n\"Not too bad - but far too long.\n\nThe technique was fine of course,\n\nBut it lacked a certain force\".\n\n\"Oh! \" the nightingale confessed.\n\nGreatly flattered and impressed\n\nThat a critic of such note\n\nHad discussed her art and throat:\n\n\"I don't think the song's divine.\n\nBut - oh, well - at least it's mine\".\n\n\"That's not much to boast about\".\n\nSaid the heartless frog. \"Without\n\nProper training such as I\n\n- And few others can supply.\n\nYou'll remain a mere beginner.\n\nBut with me you'll be a winner\"\n\n\"Dearest frog\", the nightingale\n\nBreathed: \"This is a fairy tale -\n\nAnd you are Mozart in disguise\n\nCome to earth before my eyes\".\n\n\"Well I charge a modest fee.\"\n\n\"Oh! \" \"But it won't hurt, you'll see\"\n\nNow the nightingale inspired,\n\nFlushed with confidence, and fired\n\nWith both art and adoration,\n\nSang - and was a huge sensation.\n\nAnimals for miles around\n\nFlocked towards the magic sound,\n\nAnd the frog with great precision\n\nCounted heads and charged admission.\n\nThough next morning it was raining,\n\nHe began her vocal training.\n\n\"But I can't sing in this weather\"\n\n\"Come my dear - we'll sing together.\n\nJust put on your scarf and sash,\n\nKoo-oh-ah! ko-ash! ko-ash! \"\n\nSo the frog and nightingale\n\nJourneyed up and down the scale\n\nFor six hours, till she was shivering\n\nand her voice was hoarse and quivering.\n\nThough subdued and sleep deprived,\n\nIn the night her throat revived,\n\nAnd the sumac tree was bowed,\n\nWith a breathless, titled crowd:\n\nOwl of Sandwich, Duck of Kent,\n\nMallard and Milady Trent,\n\nMartin Cardinal Mephisto,\n\nAnd the Coot of Monte Cristo,\n\nLadies with tiaras glittering\n\nIn the interval sat twittering -\n\nAnd the frog observed them glitter\n\nWith a joy both sweet and bitter.\n\nEvery day the frog who'd sold her\n\nSongs for silver tried to scold her:\n\n\"You must practice even longer\n\nTill your voice, like mine grows stronger.\n\nIn the second song last night\n\nYou got nervous in mid-flight.\n\nAnd, my dear, lay on more trills:\n\nAudiences enjoy such frills.\n\nYou must make your public happier:\n\nGive them something sharper snappier.\n\nWe must aim for better billings.\n\nYou still owe me sixty shillings.\"\n\nDay by day the nightingale\n\nGrew more sorrowful and pale.\n\nNight on night her tired song\n\nZipped and trilled and bounced along,\n\nTill the birds and beasts grew tired\n\nAt a voice so uninspired\n\nAnd the ticket office gross\n\nCrashed, and she grew more morose -\n\nFor her ears were now addicted\n\nTo applause quite unrestricted,\n\nAnd to sing into the night\n\nAll alone gave no delight.\n\nNow the frog puffed up with rage.\n\n\"Brainless bird - you're on the stage -\n\nUse your wits and follow fashion.\n\nPuff your lungs out with your passion.\"\n\nTrembling, terrified to fail,\n\nBlind with tears, the nightingale\n\nHeard him out in silence, tried,\n\nPuffed up, burst a vein, and died.\n\nSaid the frog: \"I tried to teach her,\n\nBut she was a stupid creature -\n\nFar too nervous, far too tense.\n\nFar too prone to influence.\n\nWell, poor bird - she should have known\n\nThat your song must be your own.\n\nThat's why I sing with panache:\n\n\"Koo-oh-ah! ko-ash! ko-ash! \"\n\nAnd the foghorn of the frog\n\nBlared unrivalled through the bog.\n\n8. Esther Morgan (b. 1970)\n\n1. This Morning\n\nI watched the sun moving round the kitchen,\n\nan early spring sun that strengthened and weakened,\n\ncoming and going like an old mind.\n\nI watched like one bedridden for a long time\n\non their first journey back into the world\n\nwho finds it enough to be going on with:\n\nthe way the sunlight brought each possession in turn\n\nto its attention and made of it a small still life:\n\nthe iron frying pan gleaming on its hook like an ancient find,\n\nthe powdery green cheek of a bruised clementine.\n\nThough more beautiful still was how the light moved on,\n\nletting go each chair and coffee cup without regret\n\nthe way my grandmother, in her final year, received me:\n\nneither surprised by my presence, nor distressed by my leaving,\n\ncontent, though, while I was there.\n\n2. DetailIt may be that somewhere else\n\nmore important things are at stake:\n\nangels and infantas,\n\nrobes and raiment,\n\na haloed revelation,\n\nwith uplifted hands,\n\nthat the truth’s already blazing away,\n\na woman’s life is being changed for good.\n\nI’d rather put my faith\n\nin a light like this:\n\nthe chastening gaze\n\nof a china cup\n\nset against the pewter dish\n\nthe colour of an overcast sky;\n\nits delicate and sobering touch\n\nas if remembering the face of a loved one\n\nwho ate at this table daily.\n\n3. To My Godmother\n\nI thought I understood something\n\nof the pain it caused you,\n\nsigning my name each birthday\n\nwith love\n\nas if I could remind you\n\nmore than anything else.\n\nI thought it was just your daughter\n\nyou missed, not seeing\n\nthat meant everything\n\nshe was missing from,\n\nthat thirty summers later\n\nit means everything still.\n\nForgive me –\n\nI did not know then\n\nhow grief works,\n\nhow it steeps the clear world\n\nlike dye from a red dress\n\nthat keeps on running.\n\n4. Grace\n\nYou’ve been living for this for weeks\n\nwithout knowing it:\n\nthe moment the house empties like a city in August\n\nso completely\n\nit forgets you exist.\n\nLight withdraws slowly\n\nis almost gone before you notice.\n\nIn the stillness, everything becomes itself:\n\nthe circle of white plates on the kitchen table\n\nthe serious chairs that attend them\n\neven the roses on the papered walls\n\nseem to open a little wider.\n\nIt looks simple: the glass vase holding\n\nwhatever is offered –\n\ncut flowers, or the thought of them –\n\nsimple, though not easy\n\nthis waiting without hunger in the near dark\n\nfor what you may be about to receive.\n\n9. H.W. Longfellow (1807 – 1882)\n\nHow Beautiful is the Rain!\n\nHow beautiful is the rain!\n\nAfter the dust and heat,\n\nIn the broad and fiery street,\n\nIn the narrow lane,\n\nHow beautiful is the rain!\n\nHow it clatters along the roofs,\n\nLike the tramp of hoofs!\n\nHow it gushes and struggles out\n\nFrom the throat of the overflowing spout\n\nAcross the window-pane\n\nIt pours and pours;\n\nAnd swift and wide,\n\nLike a river down the gutter roars\n\nThe rain, the welcome rain!\n\nThe sick man from his chamber\n\nLooks at the twisted brooks;\n\nHe can feel the cool\n\nBreath of each little pool;\n\nHis fevered brain\n\nGrows calm again,\n\nAnd he breathes a blessing on the rain.\n\nFrom the neighbouring school\n\nCome the boys,\n\nWith more than their wonted noise\n\nAnd commotion;\n\nAnd down the wet streets\n\nSail their mimic fleets,\n\nTill the treacherous pool\n\nEngulfs them in its whirling\n\nAnd turbulent ocean.\n\nIn the country, on every side,\n\nWhere far and wide,\n\nLike a leopard's tawny and spotted hide\n\nStretches the plain,\n\nTo the dry grass and the drier grain\n\nHow welcome is the rain!\n\nIn the furrowed land\n\nThe toilsome and patient oxen stand:\n\nLifting the yoke-encumbered head,\n\nWith their dilated nostrils spread,\n\nThey silently inhale\n\nThe clover-scented gale,\n\nAnd the vapours that arise\n\nFrom the well-watered and smoking soil.\n\nFor this rest in the furrow after toil\n\nTheir large and lustrous eyes\n\nSeem to thank the Lord,\n\nMore than man's spoken word.\n\nNear at hand,\n\nFrom under the sheltering trees,\n\nThe farmer sees\n\nHis pastures, and his fields of grain,\n\nAs they bend their tops\n\nTo the numberless beating drops\n\nOf the incessant rain.\n\nHe counts it as no sin\n\nThat he sees therein\n\nOnly his own thrift and gain.\n\n10. Pete Crowley\n\n1. Have you heard of him?\n\n\"How are you keeping then\", she wrote,\n\n“still going on O.K? Me,\n\nI’m at college now, doing English lit.\n\nThis term its Philip Larkin —\n\nI think he’s brilliant,\n\na bit depressive, but\n\nhe’s really written some good stuff —\n\nhave you heard of him?\"\n\nInto my mind there came that long\n\nlugubrious clean-shaven face\n\nthat always smelled of after-shave,\n\nthose heavy black-rimmed spectacles,\n\nthe hearing aid that always whistled,\n\nthat stylish belted macintosh he wore,\n\nand his spacious room with its sprawling desk\n\non which incongruously sat\n\nan aspidistra and a photograph\n\nof Guy, the gorilla, next to where\n\nhis secretary, Betty, placed the tray\n\nof Earl Grey tea in porcelain cups,\n\nbut most of all did I recall\n\nhis voice — its deep, slow,\n\nrich cultured tones. So great a loss,\n\nso modest too. Upon his small\n\nmeat white gravestone you’ll find\n\nno flowery epitaph, just:\n\n\"Philip Larkin / 1922 – 1985 / writer.\"\n\nHe feared death — its endless emptiness,\n\nbut don’t we all, deep down?\n\nI’ll not forget his generous friendly smile\n\nlast time we met just a little while\n\nbefore he died. We were not close,\n\nbut yet, he told me once that he’d dreamt of me\n\nand I too, when he was dead, once dreamt of him,\n\nso I may justly say to you,\n\n“Its true, I’ve heard of him”.\n\n2. A biker’s funeral\n\nThe wind blows cold through the churchyard trees\n\nand sadly tolls the passing bell\n\nas mourners shuffle up the leaf-strewn\n\nnarrow path between the leaning stones.\n\nHe was just twenty-five, so young\n\nso full of life, and love of life\n\nin a head-on crash on his motorbike.\n\nFrom far and wide we’ve gathered here\n\nto pay respect to our young friend.\n\nI’ve never seen the church so full,\n\noh death, how can you be so cruel?\n\nWho will forget this funeral?\n\nFour hundred strong in the nave we stood,\n\nfamily and friends both young and old\n\nand a phalanx of bikers in leathers and boots.\n\nBetween the holy platitudes\n\nand hymns they played his favourite songs,\n\none had to smile to hear within\n\nso kind a man and in his way\n\nthat ancient august church of stone\n\ncome belting out the vibrant tones\n\nof modem rock and heavy metal.\n\nWho can forget the coffin passing\n\nin procession like a royal barque,\n\nthe biker’s helmet on its lid\n\nresplendent in heraldic tones\n\n— rich gules, azure, argent, or,\n\na shining light of knightly splendour?\n\nWho will forget that send-off from\n\nhis fellow bikers when three score\n\nor more bright gleaming motorcycles\n\nwith a thunderous roar led off the hearse?\n\nIn memory of Stephen (Reggie) Pearce of Kilnsea, 1980 – 2005)"
