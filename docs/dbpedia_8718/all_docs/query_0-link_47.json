He discussed the issues in Urdu literature, commented on the thoughts and art of his elders, looked at the ideas of contemporaries, made fiction the subject, set the standards of poetry, and the works of various writers and artists. Faiz delivered the critique from difficult, complex and multimeaning terms. They simply express their remorse. With his critique, Faiz has tried to bring this class closer to literature, which used to think of something supernatural because of its difficult and heavy words of criticism and genius language. Faiz has also critically presented his views on various genres of literature."
