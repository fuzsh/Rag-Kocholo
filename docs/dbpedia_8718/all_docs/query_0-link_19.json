        "text": "Biography:\n\nBorn : 13th February 1911,Kala Kader, Sialkot district, British,India\n\nDied : 20th November, 1984, Lahore Punjab province, Pakistan\n\nOccupation: Poet and journalist\n\nLanguage: Punjabi, Russian, English, Urdu, Arabic , Persian\n\nNationality : Pakistani\n\nEthnicity: Pakistan\n\nEducation: Arabic literature, B.A (hons), M.A English literature, Master in Arts.\n\nAlma mater: Murray College at Sialkot, Government College University, Punjab University.\n\nGenres: Ghazal , Nazam\n\nLiterary movements: Progressive’s Writer’s Movement,Communist’s Poetry of Pakistan.\n\nNotable works: Naqsh –e– Farayadi, Zindan Nama, Dast –e-Sabah\n\nNotable Awards: MBE (1946), Niger Award (1953), Lenin Peace Prize (1962),HRC Peace Prize Nishan-e-Imtiaz (1990), Avicenna Prize (2006)\n\nFaiz Ahmed Faiz studied English Literature and Philosophy. He began his career as a lecturer in English at Amritsar. After the Second World War, he turned to journalism and distinguished himself as the editor of “The Pakistan times”\n\nHe was revolutionary poet, and one of most famous poets of Urdu. He also wrote poems in Punjabi language as well. A notable member of the “Progressive Writers Movement” Faiz Ahmed Faiz was“MARXIST”. Listed FOUR times for Nobel Prize in poetry, he received LINEN PEACE PRIZE by SOVIET UNION in 1962.\n\nDespite repeatedly accused of atheism military establishment, faiz’s poetry suggested a “religion” in general and with Islam in particular.\n\nMajor themes by Faiz:\n\nRomanticism: (love and beauty)\n\nHe started writing poetry in 1931 or 1932, once more. His poetry of this period through was conformist poetry and about the more common subject like love.\n\nمقام فیض کوی راہ میں جچا ہی نہیں\n\nجو کوۓ یار سے نکلے تو سوۓ دار چلے\n\nIn Faiz’s own words, “The period between 1920 and 1930 constituted a state of carelessness, prosperity and exuberance, in which along with important national and political movements, in prose and poetry, there was an element of light heartedness, along with serious thinking and observation.\n\nIn this atmosphere, there was also the wonder of the beginning of love but we had just a glimpse of this period, when we reached the end of love’s companionship.”\n\nThe Ghazal “مجھ سے پہلی سی محبت میرے محبوب نہ مانگ” (ask me not for my beloved) is that type (that era) of poem.\n\nSocialism + prol taric:\n\nProltaric was Russian revolution, which held in 1917.The aim of this revolution was, “make laws (policy) for labor class or in favor of labor class”\n\nMoreover,Faiz was one of that revolution’s followers.\n\nSocialism:\n\nFaiz had tremendous sympathy for sufferings of the people. While he was teaching at the M.A.O College, he became friendly with vice Principal Sahabzada Mehmood-uz-zafar and his wife, Dr. Rasheed a Jahan. Both were committed socialists and lovers of literature as well. Under their influence faiz’s poetry underwent a tremendous change.\n\nIn these days, Faiz was writing his book “Dast –e- Sabah.\n\nIn his poetry, Faiz incorporated both values of beauty and social responsibilities. His message was couch in beautiful words with an almost wistful quality. That is why Faiz’s poetry was unlike the writings of his contemporaries, with a style more mellifluous, his tone soft, his poems smooth and flowing, unlike the works of other poets, which had stronger tone.\n\nFaiz’s first collection, Naqash-e-Faryaadi, was published in 1941, same year he got married with Ellis Catherine, British woman in Srinagar Kashmir.\n\nAs faiz had adopted socialist ideologies, due to his ideologies he was against Hitler add Nazism, also when Germany invaded the USSR he felt compelled to join the fight, he left this job and joined the British Indian Army as a caption in 1942, he soon rose in the ranks and became Lieutenant Colonel in barely two years.\n\nProgressive writer’s movement:\n\nIn 1935 in London, some writers with socialist ideologies set up the progressive writer’s movement. The movement emphasized the writer’s responsibilities towards spreading and promoting positive, healthy and just values through his writings. Faiz found himself in total agreement with the movement’s views and goals and this started a new phase in his writing career.Beauty did not have more artistic values, but it also had a social and moral value.\n\nAccording to faiz poetry was a struggle in which, art and life demanded participation according to one’s abilities.Through this movement Faiz’s poetry had a new theme, THEME OF REALISM.\n\nPakistan politics:\n\n1947 was the year that changed the history of the subcontinent, as well as the lives of many of its people.\n\nنثار تیری گلیوں کے اے وطن کے جہاں\n\nچلی ہے رسم کہ کو ی سر اٹھا کے نہ چلے\n\nجو کوی چا ہنے والا طواف کو نکلے\n\nنظر جھکا کے چلے، جسم و جان بچا کے چلے\n\nEveryone was expecting that we would have a new country, New system, new government etc. Our scarifies and hard work is near to give shining morning.\n\nBut what happened?\n\nWhen Pakistan came into being, the corrupted leaders and uneducated people were ruling the system and country. Nothing was new.\n\nProgressive’s writer’smovement’s members were sold their self in front of rulers. Faiz, Sajjad Zaheer, Zaheer Kashmiri, Habib jalab, etc., were only remained. At that time faiz wrote freedom’s down in 15th August, 1947. He said in this, “This is that mornings do some more struggle.\n\nRebellion:\n\nIn 1951, faiz was arrested he was accused as being a co-conspirator, in the Rawalpindi conspiracy case.\n\nKro kuj jabeen per ser-e- kafan mery qatilo ko guman na ho.\n\nK gharor-e-ishaq baankpun pas-e-marag hum ny bhula diya.\n\nFaiz spent four years in Jail. He almost received death sentence but later he was awarded a much lesser sentences of two and half years.\n\nThe poems he wrote in jail were later copied in to the:\n\nDast-e-sabah (1953)\n\nZindannama (1956)\n\nFaiz wanted that the government of Pakistan should be educated. The qualified MNAs and PMLs run the system.\n\nShift of faiz’s poetry from Romantism to Socialism and Humanism for this purpose he wrote his famous poem “mujhsypehli c muhabbatmerymehbobnamang”(ask me not my beloved).\n\nThis poem is actually showing his shift from Romantism to Socialism. Its translation in English is as below:\n\nDon’t ask me for the same love, my sweetheart\n\nI thought that life was radiant because of you\n\nWhy complain of worldly woes, once in your love-affliction\n\nYour countenance brings eternity to the youth of spring\n\nWhat else is there in the world but for the beauty of your eyes\n\nIf you were mine, my destiny would surrender to me\n\nThis was not so, only my wish for it to be\n\nThere are sufferings in the world other than the sufferings of love\n\nThere are pleasures other that the delight of our union\n\nDark, heinous spells of uncountable centuries.\n\nWoven into rich silk and precious brocades\n\nBeing sold in every corner, bodies,\n\nCovered in dirt, drenched in blood.\n\nBodies, burning in hot ovens of disease\n\nPus seeping from open, lacerating wounds.\n\nMy sight returns to this as well, I am helpless\n\nYour beauty is heart-warming still, but I am helpless\n\nThere are sufferings in the world other than the suffering of love\n\nThere are pleasure other than the delight of our union\n\nDon’t ask me for the same love, my sweetheart!\n\nNow here is main shift of Faiz’s poetry. He left everything for humanity and socialism. Even his personal life.\n\nEach star a rung,\n\nNight comes down the spiral\n\nStaircase of the evening.\n\nThe breeze passes by so very close\n\nAs if someone just happened to speak of love\n\nIn the courtyard,\n\nPure Humanism: (Love for Humanity)\n\nFaiz was in favor of communist society. He wants equality in society. He was against poverty, lawlessness, and anarchy and monopoly system in society. He was in favor of ideal society. In which there is equality of wealth, honor, and resources. He does not believe in feudal system. He revolted against this system.\n\nTyranny on faiz:\n\nAfter his revolt against traditional politics and system, he faced prison and faced the painful and teasing circumstances. He was criticized by literary people and even by the common person. Every men and women curse him and called him Non-religious and traitor. For a poet like Faiz who wrote for common people, it was a grey tyranny.\n\n!آ گی فصل سکوں،چاک گریباں والو\n\nسل گۓ ہونٹ، کو ی زخم سلے نہ سلے\n\nدوستو! بزم سجاؤ کہ بہار آٰئ ہے۔\n\nکھل گۓ زخم، کو ی پھول کھلے نہ کھلے۔\n\nProgressive Writer’s Movement:\n\nWhen Pakistan came into being, the members of progressive movement sold their self to the rulers of Pakistan.\n\nSome of them remained; the important ones are below;\n\nAhmed NadeemQasimi\n\nZaheerKashmiri\n\nHabibJalib\n\nUstadDaman\n\nFaizAhmed Faiz\n\nArifAbdul Makeen etc.\n\nFaiz addressed those members who left the movement and said:\n\nAkhri shab k humsafar faiz najany kia huy?"
