        "text": "In 1947, British Rule of the Subcontinent came to an end in what is known as The Great Divide or, more commonly, Partition. The latter terms elude to the split of the region, which resulted in the creation of India and Pakistan. However, geographically, the division gave way to three specific states. The far western part of the subcontinent became known as West Pakistan, the central region evolved into India, and the remaining area became East Pakistan.\n\nDespite being separated by two thousand miles, East and West Pakistan continued to operate as one state due to the Muslim populations residing in the two areas. Unsurprisingly, this was an arduous challenge as the two often clashed on political, religious, and cultural policies. Their disagreements stemmed from the disparities between the local populations, as West Pakistan often disregarded Bengali culture. Contrastingly, East Pakistan embraced its diversity by implementing policies that acknowledged its distinct identity. For instance, in 1955, Bengali was granted the status of a national language after a three-year, state-level struggle. Furthermore, state officials from West Pakistan often regarded the Bengali dress code of a sari and bindi with contempt. For them, the attire resembled the Hindu culture and, therefore, had to be reformed. Over the years, West Pakistan adopted the narrative that “Islam is in danger” in its Eastern counterpart. On the other hand, under the leadership of Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, the Bengalis of East Pakistan began to resist the political and economic disparities of their region. General Ayub Khan’s appointment as President further aggravated the rising discontent in East Pakistan in 1958.\n\nCommander-in-Chief, General Ayub Khan, attained the presidency through a coup d’état against the first President of Pakistan, Iskander Mirza. One of Ayub Khan’s primary concerns was the country’s economic development. However, he implemented policies through a quantitative agenda and a long-term perspective, thus, overlooking the immediate consequences of his regulations. For instance, his directives in the agriculture sector led to a dramatic increase in income disparities nationwide. Similarly, Ayub Khan’s policies led to an increase in prices, thereby reducing the purchasing power of the rupee. As a result, the citizens of Pakistan strongly opposed the new reforms.\n\nDissatisfaction across Pakistan was evident through the various riots that took place and their correlation with Ayub Khan’s policies. For example, as one of the first acts of the regime, state officials organized a national commission to improve educational opportunities in Pakistan. The report highlighted the shortcomings of the current system and listed potential improvements. However, a census of 1961 revealed that as the literacy of populations increased in the towns of West Pakistan, so did the arrests in the area. Furthermore, many accredit Ayub Khan for resettling over nine million displaced refugees. His Rehabilitation Minister, General Adam Khan, implemented several policies meant to reduce the plight of Partition’s refugees, including the construction of new homes. However, according to data from a consensus, an increase in refugee populations in towns led to a rise in mass arrests. One possible explanation is that the positive assimilation of refugees caused deep-rooted resentment amongst the local populations, instigating violence and unrest. While several policies aided in the nation’s prosperity (such as the restriction of land holdings), several reforms negatively impacted the common man, leading to mass dissent. The mass agitation led to the President’s forced resignation; as a result, General Yahya Khan became President in 1969.\n\nPrior to ’69, Yahya Khan had been a Lieutenant General and Deputy Commander-in-Chief of the Pakistan Army. Upon accepting the presidency, he declared the country under martial law and positioned himself as the Chief Administrator. Most of his reforms represented attempts at amending the directives implemented by his predecessor (General Ayub Khan). For instance, Yahya Khan’s regime began with the mass arrests of over three hundred senior officials on charges of corruption and misconduct. Similarly, while General Ayub Khan sanctioned a few privileged elites to amass wealth, Yahya Khan established Monopolies and Restrictive Trade Practices, which represented an attempt at distributing economic power.\n\nHowever, it is imperative to mention that since the beginning of his presidency, Yahya Khan emphasized his indifference to the role and pledged to hand over the power once “the country had returned to sanity.” He vowed to hold elections on 5th October 1970. These would be the first general elections of the country as prior democrats had exploited the balloting system, leading to the anointment of their preferred President. Furthermore, a new Legal Framework Order was issued in March 1970, outlining the new government’s logistics, hence laying down the foundations for the general elections. Namely, the National Assembly was to have 313 seats, with quotas for each province as well as women. Thus, Yahya Khan’s commitment to reestablishing the National Assembly and Parliament was unprecedented and played a crucial role in the war against East Pakistan.\n\nIn 1966, Sheikh Mujib-ur-Rahman released a Six Point Program, which called for equal political and military standing for Bengalis. While Ayub Khan had imprisoned Rahman on the grounds of secession, the latter used it again as a manifesto for the 1970 elections. Due to a high probability of a coalition government, Yahya Khan was reassured of the continuity of a civil-military bureaucracy and abstained from prohibiting the Awami League’s use of Rahman’s Program. The highly sought-after elections were postponed when severe monsoon flooding caused devastation in East Pakistan. The lack of emergency relief from their Western counterpart – despite it being one of the region’s greatest natural catastrophes – fanned the flames of deep-rooted resentment.\n\nThe jarring electoral results surpassed all expectations. Under Mujib-ur-Rehman, the Awami League dominated the polls and won 167 seats out of 169. Therefore, while Bhutto’s Pakistan Peoples Party won a majority in the west, they failed to obtain a single seat in the east. As Mujib-ur-Rehman remained steadfast in his manifesto, Yahya Khan and Bhutto became wary of the potential domination of the Awami League. Consequently, the President postponed the National Assembly, which was condemned by all Bengalis. Over the following months, Yahya Khan, along with other state officials, traveled to Dacca. The talks yielded positive results for East Pakistan as state officials agreed to several of their demands, including autonomy for the province. However, Bhutto refused to accept the proclamation and reverted to doubt the leadership of Yahya Khan. Cognizant of the increasing dissent, Yahya Khan and his Lieutenant General Tikka Khan now categorized the Bengali demands as attempts for a forced secession. In response, Bengali students mobilized and began acts of resistance on 23rd March.\n\nOn 25th March, Pakistan Army began firing on Dacca University, thus, marking the beginning of the war of liberation. This was followed by Yahya Khan’s address to the nation, whereupon he denounced Mujib-ur-Rehman and the Awami League. Soon a guerrilla war broke out as India and the Mukti Bandi group supported the East Pakistanis in an armed struggle against the Pakistani Army called “Operation Searchlight.” The latter surrendered on 16th December 1971, giving way to the emergence of Bangladesh.\n\nIn 1907, Mian Iftikharuddin was born in Baghbanpura. After completing his intermediary education in Lahore, he went to Oxford, where he obtained his bachelor’s degree. While receiving higher education, Mian Iftikharuddin was deeply influenced by communist ideologies and, thus, began his lifelong interest in left-wing politics and socialism.\n\nUpon his return to the Subcontinent, the individual inhabited the political sphere and became one of the first Muslims to be elected to state-level positions as a candidate of Congress and in Hindu and Sikh-dominated regions. However, by 1945, Iftikharuddin began to support the Muslim demand for self-determination and joined the Muslim League. After Partition, he joined the Punjab cabinet division and proposed reforms advocating refugee rehabilitation. Unfortunately, his ideas were met with silence, causing him to resign from his position. Nonetheless, he continued to advocate for the rights of minorities across the country.\n\nMian Iftikharuddin was the only individual who condemned Liaqat Ali Khan’s 1949 Objectives Resolution. He argued that the “passive democracy” presented within the Resolution did not guarantee “social justice, economic freedom, and equality”. As a result, it safeguarded the rights of the Muslim elites, overlooking the democratic freedom of minorities. His political career came to a halt in 1958 when President Ayub Khan imposed the Martial Law. However, as a political leader, Mian Iftikharuddin was also a pioneer of Urdu journalism.\n\nIn 1946, he established the Progressive Papers Limited (PPL) alongside fellow Muslim League leaders. A year later, the publishing house produced an English daily newspaper called the Pakistan Times, edited by Faiz Ahmed Faiz. Soon after, the PPL began to publish Imroze (a daily magazine) and Lail-o-Nihar. Most of these publications advocated for the Muslim League’s causes and later propagated left-wing ideas.\n\nThings began to change in 1959 when Ayub Khan’s regime took over the PPL. While demanding free press, the editor, Mazhar Ali, resigned from his post. Contrastingly, Mian Iftikharuddin continued to fight a legal battle in hopes of regaining control of the PPL. Unfortunately, the journalist lost and was not provided any compensation.\n\nHe spent his life advocating for social justice and brought attention to issues such as the rights of refugees and the freedom of the press. Mian Iftikharuddin died at the age of 54 and left behind an unforgettable legacy.\n\nProgressive movements often receive limited attention in the mainstream press and are overlooked. The limited attention they do receive tends to be predominantly negative. However, magazines like Lail-o-Nihar play a crucial role in providing a platform for these movements. They go beyond mere reporting by offering comprehensive analysis and contextual understanding of these events. This aspect is recognized in the article Kissan Conference:\n\n“Neither our newspapers nor our politics have ever deemed them (farmer’s conferences) worthy of attention. Recently, the Toba Tek Singh Kisan Conference has been a topic of discussion in almost every newspaper. While these newspapers provide a summary of the speeches of most political leaders, they fail to mention the exact nature or significance of the conference. The most intriguing reaction came from Lahore’s newspapers, which call every public-interest effort anti-patriotic or anti-Islam.”\n\nThe article then mentions the significance of the Toba Tek Singh Conference and provides a nuanced perspective on the event, translated as follows:\n\n“This gathering made it clear that political awareness and consciousness are no longer the monopoly of the white-clad classes of the cities. The speechless creatures in the villages have realized that they also have a voice. The conference also highlighted that political parties that are not ready to unite on the political platform, despite partial agreement, can come together on the platform of a class organization. This conference created a new path of unity and cooperation among sympathetic parties, where even a little persistence can change the direction of our political life…\n\nThe conference primarily focused on general, political, and ideological issues of the country such as elections, economic systems, and civil rights, neglecting to address the specific problems faced by local farmers. The daily challenges encountered by typical small farmers, laborers, and farm workers were not adequately discussed. These individuals face numerous difficulties, including exploitation by landlords and corrupt officials, leaving them vulnerable and oppressed. The conference failed to propose practical solutions to these issues, which are deeply rooted in the current system.\n\nFurthermore, the lack of a predetermined topic for speakers often leads to the repetition of certain points and the omission of critical subjects. The speakers’ speeches tend to lack the necessary depth and thought required for meaningful mental training and development of the people. While successful gatherings and conferences are essential for any movement or organization, they alone cannot create lasting change without proper action and the formation of an organized movement.”\n\nInstead of presenting a superficial and idealized version of the conference, the article delves into the specific issues that deserve critical examination. This approach enables readers to gain a more comprehensive understanding of the event, including its strengths and weaknesses. By confronting the flaws and examining the conference’s significance in light of these limitations, Lail-o-Nihar fosters a more informed and balanced perspective, encouraging readers to critically evaluate the event and consider the broader implications for the farmer’s movement and the pursuit of meaningful change.\n\nUltimately, Lail-o-Nihar’s contribution to the farmer’s movement and its coverage of crucial political times reflects the magazine’s commitment to being an agent of social and political change. The magazine here is a forum for generating awareness and fostering dialogue among readers. It helps shape public discourse by challenging prevailing narratives generated by the mainstream media and offering alternative viewpoints. Its coverage of the farmer’s movement contributes to the momentum of the farmer’s movement, encouraging readers to understand the challenges faced by rural communities and to engage in efforts to address their concerns actively.\n\nAll Excerpts Translated by Fatima Saeed"
