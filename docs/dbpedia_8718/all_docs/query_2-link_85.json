        "text": "Introduction\n\nFaiz Ahmad Faiz was born in 1911 at Sialkot and is one of the most highly regarded Urdu poets of the 20th century. As a poet, Faiz began writing on the conventional themes of love and beauty, but soon these conventional themes got submerged in larger social and political issues of the day. The traditional grief of love gets fused with the travalls of the afflicted humanity, and Faiz used his poetry to champion the cause of socialistic humanism.\n\nThe poetic works of the late legendary poet has won the hearts of the people of south asia. His first published accumulation was naqsh-e-faryadi, which inspired many young poets. In 1971, after the bifurcation of united Pakistan, the newly elected government appointed him as a cultural adviser, the period, in which he laid the foundation of the Pakistan national council of arts(PNCA). Faiz’s poems flash a deep background against righteous and impishness, though he tried to pull out these things from the society so everyone could leave with peace and love. His remarkable books were nuskha-e-haiwafanaqsh-e-faryadidast-e-sabazindannama and dast-e-tah-e-sang.\n\nFaiz was the first Asian poet who was awarded with the lenin peace prize by the former soviet union in 1963. He was also nominated for the noble prize shortly before his death in 1984. He remained extremely influential in Pakistan and his work continues to influence the country’s literature and arts. Faiz was publicly honored by the Pakistan Government after his literary work was publicly endorsed and posthumously honored him with nation’s highest civil award, Nishan-e-Imtiaz, in 1990 Faiz is a poet of beauty and love. His message is the reign of beauty and love in the country. The passion for enjoying the beauty of life, his deep attachment to love of self and the agony of the world, his love of humanity, his patriotism, his passion for revolution, his sense of justice, are all metaphors of the agony of love. That agony of love which is the soul of his imagination and feeling, on account of which he illuminates the beauty of both worlds with the desolation of his heart.\n\nAt the ceremony held in grand Kremlin hall in Moscow, Faiz received the award with stage full of Russian attendees, Faiz thanked the Russian government for conferring the honour, and delivered the acceptance speech at the ceremony, which appears as a brief preface to his collection Dast-i-tah-i-Sang (Hand under the rock) is a great piece of humanist literature, as he delivered:\n\nFaiz Sahib has said that poetry is not only seeing, it is also struggle and in this struggle, one’s participation according to one’s ability is not only a demand of life, it is also a demand of art. Faiz was one the greatest urdu poets. He gave a new dimension to Urdu poetry by introducing new phrases and innovative terms in it. He wrote on various subjects. Most of his poetry is autobiographical. His poem ‘Yad’ is one of the masterpieces of Urdu poetry. His love poems are as appealing as his political poems, and he is considered primarily responsible for shaping poetic diction in contemporary Urdu poetry.\n\nFreedom’s Dawn- Faiz Ahmed Faiz\n\nThese tarnished rays, this night-smudged light –\n\nThis is not that Dawn for which, ravished with freedom,\n\nwe had set out in sheer longing,\n\nso sure that somewhere in its desert the sky harbored\n\na final haven for the stars, and we would find it.\n\nWe had no doubt that night’s vagrant wave would stray towards the shore,\n\nthat the heart rocked with sorrow would at last reach its port.\n\nFriends, our blood shaped its own mysterious roads.\n\nWhen hands tugged at our sleeves, enticing us to stay,\n\nand from wondrous chambers Sirens cried out\n\nwith their beguiling arms, with their bare bodies,\n\nour eyes remained fixed on that beckoning Dawn,\n\nforever vivid in her muslins of transparent light.\n\nOur blood was young – what could hold us back ?\n\nNow listen to the terrible rampant lie:\n\nLight has forever been severed from the Dark;\n\nour feet, it is heard, are now one with their goal.\n\nSee our leaders polish their manner clean of our suffering:\n\nIndeed, we must confess only to bliss;\n\nwe must surrender any utterance for the Beloved – all yearning is outlawed.\n\nBut the heart, the eye, the yet deeper heart –\n\nStill ablaze for the Beloved, their turmoil shines.\n\nIn the lantern by the road the flame is stalled for news:\n\nDid the morning breeze ever come? Where has it gone?\n\nNight weighs us down, is still weighs us down.\n\nFriends, come away from this false light.\n\nCome, we must search for the promised Dawn\n\nTheme of the Poem\n\nThe poet writes this work on the eve of Indian independence, with a sense of melancholy about the fruits of labour, he verifies that this is not the independence that was sought after. The poem begins on a dark note with disillusionment, the bittersweet nature of the triumph. It goes on to describe the single mindedness with which the voyages of this journey resisted the temptations of fancy., and when dawn finally appeared, when the storm clouds cleared then came a sense of clarity between the struggle and the goal. The poet then goes on to describe that the comrades are changing, how in which gratification is sought more than angst, and the pain of partition does not weigh on their apparent disposition. The fine breeze of dawn has just passed by and the wayside lamp barely noticed. The gravity of night has not lightened, and the time for redemption has not yet arrived, so the poet urges his comrades and compatriots to keep walking, for that destination is not in sight.\n\nThe isolated experience of confinement led Faiz Ahmed Faiz to compose verse. The theme of this emotionally charged poems is the disillusionment surrounding the partition of India. In an evocative poem entitled Subh-e-Azad (Freedom’s Dawn) Faiz has alluded to Indian Independence in 1947 as a “much-stained radiance”. His disappointments originated from the belief that despite the acquisition of political freedom from pre-partition tyranny, the scope for economic freedom was still very bleak.\n\nCritical Appreciation of Freedom’s Dawn\n\nFaiz Ahmad Faiz was an influential, intellectual and revolutionary poet. Faiz’s poetry has a more naunced relationship with religion in general and with Islam in particular. He wrote to arise patriotic feelings in people of the country. Due to this reason, he was sentenced by government for a short period of time. His writing style was influenced by Ghalib in diction and style. His language is simple with elite diction.\n\nThe Dawn of Freedom is a bitter lamentation of the false dawn of independence and the betrayal of the ideals of the movement to gain freedom, dignity and economic justice. Faiz’s poem “Freedom’s Dawn, August 1947, captures the desolation of independence and partition. It is a lyrical rendition that represents the aesthetic mood of an unrequited love and shies away from the violence and dehumanisation of partition. Crucially the journey to freedom remains unfinished.\n\nIn the poem “Freedom’s Dawn”, there is a sense of tragedy. Faiz wrote this poem in August 1947 when Pakistan came into being. In the poem, there is an expression of tragedy and possibility of ordinary people caught in the world wind of historical events such as refugee crisis, communalism, rape and horror of partition. The poet says that although this is the same dawn, we have been waiting for a long time. We expected this morning of freedom be filled with brightness, sense of security and victory but it is not so. The poet is hopeful of finding such a dawn:\n\nDil kay aywaan main liye gulshada shamon ki qatar\n\nNoor Khurshid say sehmay huay uktaiy huay\n\nHusan-e-mehboob kay sayal-e-tasawar ki tarah\n\nApni tariki ko bhenchay huay lapetay huay\n\nHe resembles the hope of finding peaceful place to live with the hope of finding water in desert or finding the last group of star before rising sun. His claiming of sky as desert is dejecting which shows that he is worried for his country’s miserable condition. He still has the hope of fearless and peaceful meaning without injuries or suffering. He says continuous struggle can fulfill our dream of restful dawn, a dawn without worries, bloodshed and sorrows of losing our dear ones in wars, bomb blasts or other acidents. He says that the time of pain is moving slowly but we should be hopeful that the bad time will vanish soon. The hurdles which we are facing due to partition would be leapt soon, our emotional anguish would find rest, is the hope of the poet.\n\nHe, in the second stanza, says that when youth sets out on mystic journeys to win the battle of their rights, there are many people who attempts to stop them; their family, home, relations, comforts etc. But the charm of freedom has far more attraction in it. They want to see the nation (muslims) free from the oppression of tyrant rulers, so that they can live happy and with contment. The dream of separate homeland is dearer to tiredness, sufferings and troubles.\n\nBut when the battles of freedom came to an end, there is the waiting of fruits of struggle. But at the moment, what observes is that success is a journey and not a destination. There is much to be done. Apart from other grief, there is another problem which people are going to face. The grief is corrupted behaviour of leaders. He says that although there should be the scenes of joy and celebration but there is something which is making the dawn sorrowful. Perhaps he wants to say that tyranny of foreign people is sad but the disloyality of own people is heart breaking. He asks himself that if the war is over then why there is no feeling of security. The lights and brightness of freedom are still dim. He advises his companions in the end, that war is not over yet. It is just the change of phase. Our enemy is changed now. The enemy, now, is more strong and clever. We still need to work harder and harder to reach the destination of what we dreamt for, a place to live according to riles of Islam.\n\nSymbolism in Faiz’s Poem ‘Dawn of Freedom’\n\nFirst of all Dawn (from an Old English verb dagian “to become day”) is the time that marks the beginning of the twilight before sunrise. Dawn means the first appearance of daylight in the morning.\n\nAs a symbol, the dawn can have most of the meanings generally associated with light (e.g., enlightenment, vitality). More particularly, the dawn is the emergence of a new stage of life, a new understanding, or a new start, and the emergence from darkness.\n\nYe dagh dagh ujala, ye shab-gazida sahar,\n\nWo intizar tha jis-ka, ye wo sahar to nahiñ,\n\nYe vo sahar to nahiñ jis-ki arzu lekar\n\nChale the yar ke mil-jaegi kahiñ na kahiñ;\n\nIn the first stanza Faiz has drawn the picture of dawn. He has used the imagery with the words “day break”, “desired crack”, “stars in the sky”. From this imagery he has conveyed the enriching situation of the Muslims of that day. He has referred to the struggle of the independence of Muslims of the sub-continent. The meaning beneath this stanza refers to that ideology for which Muslims of the sub-continent fought against.\n\nFalak ke dasht main taroñ ki akhiri manzil,\n\nKahiñ to hoga shab-e sust mauj ka sahil,\n\nKahiñ to jake rukega safina-e-gham-e-dil.\n\nIn the second stanza Faiz is hopeful for the day and the misery and struggle will come to an end. He has symbolized the struggle that is going on within Muslims community, mauj ka sahil, and safina-e-gham-e-dil. In the next two lines he has represented the tragedy of Muslims as ‘Jawan Lahu’ which in English is something “exicted or passionable in nature”. The aim of the Muslims to get an independent state was fresh but on the other hand Faiz says that ‘Chale jo yar to daman pe kitne hath pare’ in English represents the hurdles as well as hindrances which stopped Muslims to achieve their purpose.\n\nJawañ lahu ki pur-asrar shahrahoñ se\n\nChale jo yar to daman pe kitne hath pare;\n\nIn the above two lines of third stanza the poet depicted the thoughts of Muslims. It is about what they thought while fighting for a separate nation. They had a lot expectation with this demand for separate nation. He closed the words which inspires soul to the poem. He has told us that how firm believe Muslim had in this demand they thought independent nation will bring a full stop to their tragedies. This paragraph has captured the temptation that was residing in Muslim’s heart. This is about their faith, their hope and expectations.\n\nLanguage\n\nFaiz’s Dawn of Freedom was written in August 1947 on the 60th anniversary of India’s Independence and the eve of Bhagat Singh’s Birth Centenary.\n\nIts words are as hauntingly familiar, as evocative, as inspiring as they were 60 years ago. Then, its view of “this night-bitten dawn”, stained by the communal bloodshed of partition,\n\nmocked at the triumphalism of Nehru’s Tryst With Destiny speech which announced that “India will awake to life and freedom”.\n\nHis tone varies from stanza to stanza for example in his first stanza pessimistic tone has been found as it reminds us of gloomy and dark situation .In the second stanza deep and reflective tone has been found that analyze the content of the independent war. His third stanza is satirical and realistic. He has told us about the harsh realities but in the end he gives faith to Muslim that destiny is not much far. In the last stanza the poet adopts harsh tone and he seems to be in satirical mode. He declares that fancy has become the reality but it has not brought the fruit “that all the battles have been fought” but he stress that the main aim for which the struggle was set on is yet unfulfilled. He symbolizes this independence as a “false dawn”. He does not consider this independence as a real independence and he forces that this desire remained unfulfilled.\n\nThe whole poem can be summed up in one line where he asks “when did it comes and where has it gone”. He is saying that we have forgotten our real aim and adopted a false one. The real aim was establishment of a peaceful society in a cordon with this aim where no anarchy flourishes but the outcome has been opposite to what it should have been. Last four lines reflect Faiz’s in the union of humanity when he negates “the moment of our freedom”. He dictates us the lesson of brotherhood and unity. He says that we can only reach to our freedom and destination when we believe in peace.\n\nConclusion\n\nSubh-e Azadi” (“Dawn of Freedom”) by the brilliant Urdu Marxist poet Faiz Ahmed Faiz, best expresses to me the sense of tragedy and possibility of 1947 for ordinary people caught in the worldwind of historical events: an independence brokered through ethnic cleansing, refugee crisis, communalism, rape, and horrors of partition.\n\nThe poet writes this work on the eve of Indian independence, with a sense of melancholy about the fruits of labour, he verifies that this is not the independence that was sought after. The poem begins on a dark note with disillusionment, the bittersweet nature of the triumph. It goes on to describe the single mindedness with which the voyages of this journey resisted the temptations of fancy., and when dawn finally appeared, when the storm clouds cleared then came a sense of clarity between the struggle and the goal. The poet then goes on to describe that the comrades are changing, how in which gratification is sought more than angst, and the pain of partition does not weigh on their apparent disposition. The fine breeze of dawn has just passed by and the wayside lamp barely noticed. The gravity of night has not lightened, and the time for redemption has not yet arrived, so the poet urges his comrades and compatriots to keep walking, for that destination is not in sight\n\nThe darkness of the night has not ended yet. The moment of liberation of hearts and minds Has not come yet. Keep going, for we have not come To the end of our journey yet!? The Dawn of Freedom is a bitter lamentation of the false dawn of independence and the betrayal of the ideals of the movement to gain freedom, dignity and economic justice. So, Faiz’s poem Freedom Dawn also symbolizes Muslims faith, their expectations, their hope, their determinations as well as their sufferings in particular.\n\nIntroduction:\n\nMatthew Arnold (1822-1888), the greatest name among the Victorian critics, was a poet turned critic. He started his literary career by writing poetry. It was only at the age of thirty-one that he published his first piece of criticism, Preface to the Poems, and then for the rest of his life, for full thirty-five years, he hardly wrote anything but criticism.\n\nHis literary criticism may itself be divided into two categories:\n\n(a) Theoretical criticism or literary aesthetics\n\n(b) Practical criticism\n\nHis theoretical criticism is contained largely in his Preface to the Poems and The Function of Criticism at the Present Time, standing at the head of the first series of his Essays in Criticism, and The Study of Poetry with which opens the second series of his Essays in Criticism. His practical criticism largely consists of his estimates of English and Continental poets contained in both the series of Essays in Criticism.\n\nA number of influences operated upon Arnold from the earliest days and determined his views and attitudes.\n\nFirst, Arnold owes much of his knowledge of Greek and Latin masters to his great father. His classicism was inspired by him, and it is to this fact that George Watson attributes the quality in his writing, the incongruity between the head and the heart.\n\nThe second powerful influence on him was that of the age in which he lived and created. Disgusted with the degenerate and decadent romanticism of the day, its mammon worship and false money-values, its cultural anarchy, its historicism, its provincialism, and its philistinism, he was critical of it and sought to bring about a cultural revolution.\n\nThirdly, Arnold was a man who read avidly, both the ancient and the moderns, and quite naturally, his reading influenced him profoundly. Love for the classics of ancient Greece and Rome was inculcated in him by his father, and he drank deep at the foundation of Homer, Sophocles, Virgil, Aristotle and many others. This passion of reading the Greek and Roman literature is reflected in all his works.\n\nFourthly, it was the critical method of Sainte-Beuve which appealed to him and which in the main, he made his own.\n\nAnd lastly, professorship of poetry at Oxford gave him power to present his ideas.\n\nAll these factors mixed up and he formed his criticism in which the most important work is The Study of Poetry.\n\nThe purpose of this paper is to delineate the several myriad arguments of Arnold’s critique. From Chaucer to Burns, this paper attempts to explain Arnold’s views on many famous classics of English literature. Not only does Arnold present a commentary on different poets, but in doing so presents a way of critique and criticism which, according to him, is the most appropriate and effective one. The “touchstone method”, for Arnold, was the only way of valorization and evaluation that is free from all fallacies and subjective prejudices. After presenting his conception of the best kind of poetry, he presents his case on how one can recognize this “best kind of poetry” and then goes on to give practical examples of such a system of criticism. All of this makes Arnold’s work complete, comprehensive and exemplary, such that could be read from time to time as an instruction manual on recognizing great poetry and distinguishing it from the mediocre kind.\n\nThe Study of Poetry:\n\nHe starts with asserting that the future of poetry is immense. All our creed and religion have been shaken. They have grown too much tied down to facts. But for poetry the idea is everything. The strongest part of our religion today is its unconscious poetry. We should study poetry more and more, for poetry is capable of higher uses. We have to turn to poetry “to interpret life for us, to console us, and to sustain us.” Without poetry science will remain incomplete and much that passes with us for religion and philosophy will be replaced by poetry.\n\nPoetry can fulfill its high function only if we keep a high standard for it. No charlatanism should be allowed to enter poetry. Arnold then defines poetry as:\n\n“A criticism of life under the conditions fixed for that criticism by the laws of poetic truth and poetic beauty.”\n\nOnly the best poetry is capable of performing this task. Only that poetry which is the criticism of life can be our support and stay, when other helps fail us. So, it is important that readers should learn to choose the best. In choosing the best, the readers are warned against two kinds of fallacious judgments:\n\nThe historic estimate and the personal estimate.\n\nThe readers should learn to value poetry as it really is in itself. The historic estimate is likely to affect our judgment when we are dealing with ancient poets, the personal estimate when we are dealing with our contemporary poets. Readers should insist on the real estimate, which means a recognition and discovery of the highest qualities which produce the best poetry. It should be a real classic and not a false classic. A true classic is one which belongs to the class of the very best and such poetry we must feel and enjoy as deeply as we can.\n\nIt is not necessary to lay down what in the abstract constitute the features of high quality of poetry. It is much better to study concrete examples, to take specimens of poetry of the high, the very highest qualities, and to say, the features of highest poetry are what we find here. Short passages and single lines from Homer, Dante, Shakespeare, Milton and others may be memorized and applied as touchstones to test the worth of the poems we want to read. This other poetry must not be required to resemble them; but if the touchstone-quotations are used with tact, they will enable the reader to detect the presence or absence of the highest poetic quality.\n\nHowever, in order to satisfy those who insist that some criteria of excellence should be laid down, Arnold points out that excellence of poetry lies “both in its matter or its substance and in its manner or style.” But matter and style must have the accent of high beauty, worth and power. But Arnold does not define what this mark or accent is. He says we would ourselves feel it, for it is the mark or accent of all high poetry. If the matter of a poet has truth and high seriousness, the manner and diction would also acquire the accent of superiority. The two are vitally connected together.\n\nArnold then undertakes a brief review of English poetry from Chaucer to Burns in order to apply practically the general principles laid down above and so to demonstrate their truth. The substance of Chaucer’s poetry–his view of things and his criticism of life–has “largeness, freedom, shrewdness, benignity.” He surveys the world from a truly human point of view. But his poetry is wanting in “high seriousness”. His language, no doubt, causes difficulty, but this difficulty can be easily overcome. Chaucer will be read more and more with the passing of time. But he is not a classic; his poetry lacks the accent of a real classic. This can be easily verified through a comparison of a passage from Chaucer with one from Dante, the first poetic classic of Christendom. This is so because he has the truth of substance but not “high seriousness”.\n\nShakespeare and Milton are our great poetical classics, but Dryden and Pope are not poetical classics.\n\n“Dryden was the puissant and glorious founder; Pope was the splendid high priest of the age of reason and prose, of our excellent and indispensable 18th century.”\n\nBut theirs is not the verse of men whose criticism of life has a serious seriousness, has poetic largeness, freedom, insight, benignity. Their application of ideas to life is not poetic application, they are not classics of English poetry; they are classics of English prose.\n\nThe most singular and unique poet of the age of Pope and Dryden is Gray. Gray is a poetic classic, but lie is the scantiest of classics. He lived in the company of great classics of Greece, and he caught their manners, and their views of life. His work is slighter and less perfect than it would have been, had he lived in a congenial age. Elsewhere, Arnold tells us that the difference between genuine poetry and the poetry of Pope, Dryden, and other poets of their school, is briefly this:\n\n“Their poetry is conceived and composed in their wits; genuine poetry is conceived and composed in the soul.”\n\nGray’s poetry was so composed.\n\nNext coming to Burns, Arnold points out that his real merit is to be found in his Scottish poems. In his poetry, we do find the application of ideas to life, and also that his application is a powerful one, made by a man of vigorous understanding and master of language. He also has truth of substance. Burns is by far the greater force than Chaucer, though he has less charm. But we do not find in Burns that accent of high seriousness which is born out of absolute sincerity, and which characterizes the poetry of the great classics. The poetry of Burns has truth of matter and truth of manner, but not the accent of the poetic virtue of the highest masters. Even in the case of Burns, one is likely to be misguided by the personal estimate. This danger is even greater in the case of Byron, Shelley and Wordsworth. Estimates of their poetry are likely not only to be personal, but also “personal with passion”. So Arnold does not take them up for consideration.\n\nHaving illustrated practically his touchstone method, Arnold expresses the view that good literature will never lose its currency. There might be some vulgarization and cheapening of literary values, as a result of the increase in numbers of the common sort of readers, but the currency of good literature is ensured by “the instinct of self-preservation in humanity”. So strong is Arnold’s faith in the value of poetry of the highest kind. Hence, he believes that only in the spirit of poetry our race will find its last source of consolation and stay.\n\nPoetry as Superior to All Knowledge:\n\nThe Study of Poetry is Arnold’s most famous work of literary criticism as it is fundamentally concerned with poetry’s high destiny. He is of the view that poetry can be our sustenance and stay in an era where religious beliefs are fast losing their hold. As discussed above, Arnold lived in a materialistic world where advancement of science had led society in a strange darkness. Importance of religion was submerged. People were becoming fact seekers. A gap was being developed and he believed that poetry could fill that gap by noble and profound application of ideas to life which should be of moral nature. Therefore, he believes that with the passing of time mankind will discover that they have to turn to poetry in order to interpret life and to console and sustain themselves as science and philosophy will eventually prove flimsy and unstable. He demanded that poetry should serve a greater purpose instead of becoming a mere medium of gaining pleasure and appreciating beauty. He claims that poetry is superior to philosophy, science and religion because religion attaches its emotions to ideas and ideas are infallible and science in his view is incomplete without poetry.\n\nOne of the characteristic qualities of poetry mentioned by Arnold in this essay is a sound representation of life and ideas without any attempt to falsify the facts. He further points out that another characteristic of great poetry is the application of ideas to criticism of life. He endorses Wordsworth’s view that “poetry is the impassioned expression which is the countenance of all science” and calls poetry the breath and finer spirit of knowledge. According to Arnold, the greatness of Wordsworth lies in his powerful application of the subject of ideas to man, nature and human life. Another quality attributed to great poetry by him is that of high seriousness. Aristotle was of the view that poetry was superior to history due to the former’s qualities of higher truth and higher seriousness. What we judge from Arnold’s essay is that “high seriousness” is concerned with sad reality and this quality is possessed by the poetry which deals with the tragic aspects of life. Arnold further illustrates this view by giving examples of Dante, Shakespeare and Milton’s poetry.\n\nTherefore we must know how to distinguish the best poetry from the inferior, the genuine from the counterfeit and to do this we must steep ourselves in the work of the acknowledged masters.\n\nCharlatanism and the Fallacies:\n\nArnold, after apotheosizing poetry in his essay, suggests that poetry must be of high order of excellence to fulfill its high destinies. The Study of Poetry clearly enunciates that the people must accustom themselves with “high standards” and “strict judgments”, in order to avoid fallacies of highly regarding certain poems and poet. Poetry should not be valued on basis of the value of certain poets in history. It must not be evaluated on the basis of personal affinities or likings. It presents methods for discerning only the classical and the best poets and poetry.\n\nArnold analyses the role of the critic while judging any poetry. Before Mathew Arnold, the critics valued poetry based on the beauties and defects in it. While Mathew Arnold sees the critic as the social benefactor who strictly judges the poetry of higher order of excellence. Aristotle analyzes the work of art, but Mathew Arnold in study of poetry analyzes the role of critic. Aristotle gives us the principles which govern the making of the poem, the other gives principles by which poems should be selected as superior or inferior and made known to the world. Aristotle’s critics own allegiance to the artist but Arnold’s critic own allegiance to the art (poetry) and the society. Art should be given value which it possesses in itself. Arnold views poetry as the criticism of life.\n\nAccording to Arnold, there is no place for charlatanism in poetry. A charlatan is defined as the flamboyant deceiver who attracts others with tricks or jokes. Charlatanism in poetry confuses or removes the distinction between excellent and inferior, sound and unsound, true and untrue or only half true. In this essay, Arnold clearly rejects charlatanism in poetry in following words:\n\n“In poetry, which is thought and art in one, it is the glory, the eternal honor that charlatanism finds no entrance that this noble sphere be kept inviolate and inviolable.”\n\nArnold supports his idea for the nobility in poetry by recalling the Saint Beuve’s reply to napoleon, Arnold states the Saint Beuve’s reply to Napoleon when he said him that charlatanism is found in everything. Saint Beuve replied to this that charlatanism might be found in everything except poetry, because in poetry the distinction between the superior and inferior and noble and ignoble is of paramount importance. Arnold regards poetry as criticism of life in true sense. Poetry can reflect the true spirits of life when it will be free of any kind of corruption or ignobility. He regards poetry as “the criticism of life governed by poetic truth and poetic beauty”. According to him the spirits of our age will find stay and consolation by this true criticism of life. The extent to which the consolation, comfort, solace in poetry is obtained is proportional to the power of poem’s criticism of life. It means that the measure to which a poem is genuine and noble, and free from charlatanism.\n\nArnold than defines the true canons for the best poetry. The best poetry is that which is according to the reader’s desire or wish. Arnold illustrates this in following words:\n\n“The best poetry is what we want, the best poetry will be found to have power of forming, sustaining and delighting us and nothing else can.”\n\nArnold states three different kinds of estimates that govern the reader’s mind while evaluating any piece of literature, especially poetry. These are:\n\nReal estimate\n\nHistorical estimate\n\nPersonal estimate\n\nAccording to him the most precious benefit to be collected from best poetry is “clearer and deeper sense of best” and “the strength and joy to be drawn from it”. This sense must be present in every reader’s mind while searching for the best in poetry, and to enjoy it. This sense should govern our estimate that what should we read. This estimate is called the real estimate of poetry.\n\nArnold contrasts the real estimate to “two other kinds of estimate”, the historic estimate and the personal estimate. The real estimate of the poetry can be superseded by these two “fallacious” estimates. He says that these two estimates should be discarded while evaluating poetry; he cautions the critic that in forming a genuine and disinterested estimate of the poet under consideration, he should not be influenced by historical or personal judgments.\n\nHistorical estimate is regarded fallacious, because we regard ancient poet excessive veneration. It calculates the poet’s merit on “historical grounds’, that is, by regarding a poets work as a stage in the course of development of nation’s language, thought and poetry. The historical estimate is likely to affect our judgments and language when we are analyzing ancient poets. Arnold states this in essay, in following words:\n\n“The course of development of nation’s language, thought and poetry, is profoundly interesting, and by regarding a poet’s work as a stage in this course of development, we may easily bring to ourselves to make it of more importance as poetry than in itself it really is, we may come to use a language of quite exaggerated praise in criticizing it; in short, to over rate it.”\n\nPersonal estimate is another fallacy while criticizing poetry. It calculates a poet’s merit on the basis of personal affinities, liking or circumstances, which may make us over-rate the object of personal interest because the work in question “is, or has been of high importance to us personally”. We may over-rate the object of our interest, and can praise it in quite exaggerated language and grant it more value or importance than it really possess. Personal estimate is regarded fallacious, because it makes people biased towards their contemporary poets.\n\nAs example of erroneous judgments, he says that the 17th century French court tragedies were spoken with exaggerated praise, until Pellison reproached them for want of free poetic stamp, and another critic Charles d’ Hericault, said that the 17th century French poetry had received excessive veneration. Arnold says that the critic seems to substitute, a halo for physiognomy, and a statue in place, where there was once a man.\n\nMany people, Arnold argues, skip in obedience to mere tradition and habit , from one famous name or work in its national poetry to another, ignorant of what it misses, and of the reason for keeping what it keeps, and of the whole process of growth in poetry. All this misses, however the indispensability of recognizing the “reality of poet’s classical character” that is’ the test whether it belongs to the class of very best and that appreciation of the wide difference between it and all the works which has not the same character. Arnold points out that tracing historical origins in works of poetry is not totally unimportant and that to some degrees personal choice enters into any attempt to anthologize the works. However, the ‘real estimate’, from which derives the benefit of clearly feeling and deeply enjoying the very best, the true classic in poetry ought to be the literary historian’s objective.\n\nPoetry as the Criticism of Life\n\nIn his essay, ‘The Study of Poetry’ Matthew Arnold has presented poetry as a criticism of life. In the beginning of his essay he states: “In poetry as criticism of life, under conditions fixed for such criticism by the laws of poetic truth and poetic beauty, the spirit of our race will find, as time goes by and as other helps fail, its consolation and stay.” Thus, according to him poetry is governed by the laws of poetic truth and poetic beauty.\n\nPoetic truth is a characteristic quality of the matter and substance of poetry. It means a sound representation of life. In other words, it is a true depiction of life without any attempt to falsify the facts. Poetic beauty is contained in the manner and style. It is marked by excellence of diction and flow of verse. While talking of Chaucer, Arnold mentions fluidity of diction and verse. Poetic beauty springs from right words in the right order.\n\nPoetic truth and poetic beauty are inter-related and cannot be separated from one another.” The superior character of truth and seriousness in the matter and substance of best poetry, is inseparable from the superiority of diction and movement marking its manner and style”, says Arnold. If a poem is lacking in the qualities of poetic truth and high seriousness, it cannot possess the excellence of diction and movement, and vice-versa\n\nIn his estimate of Burns and Wordsworth, Arnold points out that another characteristic of great poetry is application of ideas to criticism of life. The greatness of Wordsworth lies in his powerful application of the subject of ideas to man, nature and human life. Ideas according to Arnold are moral ideas.\n\nAnother quality attributed to great poetry by Arnold is that of ‘high seriousness’. Although he does not fully explain the term, we gather quite a lot of information from his statement. Aristotle was of the view that poetry is superior to history due to the former’s qualities of higher truth and higher seriousness. What we judge from Arnold’s essay is that high-seriousness is concerned with the sad reality. This quality is possessed by poetry which deals with the tragic aspects of life. Even the examples given by Arnold from Dante, Shakespeare and Milton’s poetry illustrate this view. For instance, dying Hamlet’s request to Horatio:\n\n“If thou didst ever hold me in thy heart\n\nAbsent thee from felicity awhile,\n\nAnd in this harsh world draw thy breath in pain\n\nTo tell my story…”\n\nRegarding the concept of criticism of life, it needs to be understood what Arnold meant by the phrase – “criticism of life”. It does not mean carping at or unnecessarily finding faults with life. The suggestion itself is unsound that it means a criticism of society and its follies. Criticism of life means a healthy interpretation of life. It means an evaluation, sympathetic sharing in and feeling for. The theory of poetry given Arnold has been challenged on many accounts. Arnold does not consider Burns a great poet because in his poetry Burns presents an ugly life. Arnold was of the view that a poet has the advantage of portraying a beautiful life in his poetry. Eliot attacked this opinion. He believed that the poet has not the advantage of describing a beautiful life but has rather an advantage of having the capacity to look beneath both ugliness and beauty. It is the power to look beyond boredom, horror and glory.\n\nWhile teaching of the concept of poetic beauty, Arnold mentions excellence of diction but does not explain what it is. As regards the flow in verse or the fluidity in movement, Arnold probably does not realize that the use of coarseness is sometimes intentional to create a specific effect. Smoothness need not be the only one; harshness and ruggedness are equally great qualities, when used to create special effects.\n\nMatthew Arnold does not fully explain the term ‘high seriousness’. It should also be remembered here that seriousness should not at all be considered synonymous with solemnity. The serious and humorous can exist together.\n\nAnother view put forward by Arnold that has been under the shadow of criticism is that of ‘ideas’. We might very well like to believe that what Arnold wants to say is that an author, while interpreting life for us, might also use a moral idea to convey a moral lesson. But what Arnold believes is that there is a pre-conceived idea on which the poet bases his evaluation.\n\nEliot also criticizes Arnold on the latter’s occupation with only great poetry. Adhering to this principle, we might end up dealing with only a small part of the total poetry.\n\nMatthew Arnold talks of deriving pleasure from poetry. But according to critics he is actually biased towards morality – a fact that is evident from his view that poetry would replace religion. “More and more mankind will discover that we have to turn to poetry to interpret life for us”, he writes. Apart from all the negative criticism directed against Arnold we cannot deny that he has very beautifully related literature to life. As Douglas Bush rightly points out that literature is not an end in itself for Arnold. It only adds to the beauty of life and answers the question ‘How to live?’ Arnold is such a person, who does not live to read, but reads to live.\n\nThe Touchstone Method:\n\n“Poetry is interpretative by having natural magic in it, and moral profundity.”\n\nArnold’s touchstone method is a comparative method of criticism. According to this method, in order to judge a poet’s work properly, a critic should compare it to passages taken from works of great masters of poetry, and that these passages should be applied as touchstones to other poetry. Even a single line or selected quotation will serve the purpose. If the other work moves us in the same way as these lines and expressions do, then it is really a great work, otherwise not. This method was recommended by Arnold to overcome the shortcomings of the personal and historical estimates of a poem. Both historical and personal estimate go in vain. In personal estimate, we cannot wholly leave out the personal and subjective factors. In historical estimate, historical importance often makes us rate a work as higher than it really deserves. In order to form a real estimate, one should have the ability to distinguish a real classic. At this point, Arnold offers his theory of Touchstone Method. A real classic, says Arnold, is a work, which belongs to the class of the very best. It can be recognized by placing it beside the known classics of the world. Those known classics can serve as the touchstone by which the merit of contemporary poetic work can be tested.\n\nThe best way to know the class, to which a work belongs in terms of the excellence of art, Arnold recommends, is:\n\n“… to have always in one’s mind lines and expression of the great masters, and to apply them as a touchstone to the poetry.”This is the central idea of Arnold’s Touchstone Method.\n\nMatthew Arnold’s Touchstone Method of Criticism was really a comparative system of criticism. Arnold was basically a classicist. He admired the ancient Greek, Roman and French authors as the models to be followed by the modern English authors. The old English like Shakespeare, Spenser or Milton were also to be taken as models. Arnold took selected passages from the modern authors and compared them with selected passages from the ancient authors and thus decided their merits. This method was called Arnold’s Touchstone Method.\n\nHowever, this system of judgment has its own limitations. The method of comparing passage with a passage is not a sufficient test for determining the value of a work as a whole. Arnold himself insisted that we must judge a poem by the ‘total impression’ and not by its fragments. But we can further extend this method of comparison from passages to the poems as whole units. The comparative method is an invaluable aid to appreciation of any kind of art. It is helpful not merely thus to compare the masterpiece and the lesser work, but the good with the not so good, the sincere with the not quite sincere, and so on.\n\nThose who do not agree with this theory of comparative criticism say that Arnold is too austere, too exacting in comparing a simple modern poet with the ancient master poet. It is not fair to expect that all hills may be Alps. The mass of current literature is much better disregarded. By this method we can set apart the alive, the vital, the sincere from the shoddy, the showy and the insincere.\n\nArnold’s view of greatness in poetry and what a literary critic should look for are summed up as follows:\n\n“… it is important, therefore, to hold fast to this: that poetry is at bottom a criticism of life; that the greatness of a poet lies in his powerful and beautiful application of ideas to life, to the question: how to live.”\n\nOn Chaucer:\n\nMatthew Arnold is an admirer of Chaucer’s poetry. He remarks that Chaucer’s power of fascination is enduring.\n\n“He will be read far more generally than he is read now.”\n\nThe only problem that we come across is the difficulty of following his language. Chaucer’s superiority lies in the fact that “we suddenly feel ourselves to be in another world”. His superiority is both in the substance of his poetry and in the style of his poetry.\n\n“His view of life [weltanschauung] is large, free, simple, clear and kindly. He has shown the power to survey the world from a central, a human point of view.”\n\nThe best example is his Prologue to the Canterbury Tales. Matthew Arnold quotes here the words of Dryden who remarked about it; “Here is God’s plenty”. Arnold continues to remark that Chaucer is a perpetual fountain of good sense. Chaucer’s poetry has truth of substance; “Chaucer is the father of our splendid English poetry.” By the lovely charm of his diction, the lovely charm of his movement, he makes an epoch and founds a tradition. We follow this tradition in Spenser, Shakespeare, Milton and Keats. “In these poets we feel the virtue.” And the virtue is irresistible.\n\nIn spite of all these merits, Arnold says that Chaucer is not one of greatest classics. He has not their accent. To strengthen his argument Arnold compares Chaucer with the Italian classic Dante. Arnold says that Chaucer lacks not only the accent of Dante but also the high seriousness.\n\n“Homer’s criticism of life has it, Shakespeare’s has it, Dante’s has it. But Chaucer’s has not.”\n\nThus in his critical essay The Study of Poetry Matthew Arnold comments not only on the merits of Chaucer’s poetry, but also on the short-comings. He glorifies Chaucer with the remark, “With him is born our real poetry.” According to Matthew Arnold, Chaucer’s criticism of life has “largeness, freedom, shrewdness and benignity”, but it lacks “high seriousness”. The term “high seriousness” which Arnold says marks the works of Homer. Also, Dante and Milton and Wordsworth, apparently employed this “high seriousness” which entails a sustained magnificence of artistic conception and execution accompanied by deep morality and spiritual values.\n\nIt must be remembered that Arnold laid a great deal of importance on the “human actions” as the proper subjects of poetry. His contention of “high seriousness” is inevitably bound up with this. His concept of poetry being a “criticism of life” is quite satisfied by Chaucer. Chaucer’s poetry is steeped with life, and yet there is basic sanity and order in his vision which Arnold should not have missed.\n\nThe fun and comedy in Chaucer’s writing often blinds one to his basic greatness. His vision is truly Christian in its broad and forgiving tolerance. His vision of the earth ranges from one of amused delight to one of grave compassion. His fresh goodwill and kindly common sense, his sense of joy and warmth are communicated through his poetry especially in The Canterbury Tales. But behind the fun and tolerance there is a sane moral view. Chaucer’s tolerance is not born of moral leniency or from a desire to excuse or mitigate the worldliness of the characters as he saw them. The Monk’s travesty of the cloister in the name of gracious living finds no exoneration from Chaucer, nor is Chaucer appreciative of the wickedness of the Summoner and the Pardoner. His tolerance is based on deep conviction of human frailty, and his medium of looking at it is irony, not inventive.\n\nWhen we read the pen portraits of the pilgrims, we can see how clearly Chaucer has suggested the values they live by and what they look for. In these values—the chivalry of the Knight, the Monk’s love for hunting, the Doctor’s love of gold, the poor Parson’s holy thought and work, the Clerk’s love for learning and teaching—lies Chaucer’s subtle moral judgment.\n\nWhen Arnold quotes a line from Chaucer as truly classic, he chooses a line expressive of stoic resignation. “O martir seeded to virginitee” from the Prioress’s tale. Indeed, all the lines quoted by Arnold as “touchstones” have the ring of stoic resignation. Thus, Arnold’s own view seems biased in favor of the obviously solemn and didactic.\n\nIn fact, Arnold’s concept of poetry does not seem to include the genre of comedy. The term “high seriousness” has been interpreted to mean seriousness in the more obvious sense. The poet’s criticism of life is not only to be serious, but also seen to be serious. Arnold seems to demand solemn rhetoric. If we interpret “high seriousness” in this light, we can only say that Chaucer’s poetry lacks it, for Chaucer was anything but “solemn”. However, if we consider “high seriousness” in a broader light, Chaucer’s observation of life, his insight into its passions and weaknesses, its virtues and strength is truly great. If we strictly accept Matthew Arnold’s contention, then we will have to deny “high seriousness” to all comic writers, even to Moliere and Cervantes.\n\nOn the Age of Dryden:\n\n“The difference between genuine poetry and the poetry of Dryden, Pope, and all their school, is briefly this; their poetry is conceived and composed in their wits, genuine poetry is conceived and composed in the soul.” – Matthew Arnold\n\nJohn Dryden (1631–1700) was an English poet, literary critic, translator and playwright who was made Poet Laureate in 1668. He is seen as dominating the literary life of Restoration England to such a point that the period came to be known in literary circles as the “Age of Dryden”. Walter Scottish called him “Glorious John”. John Dryden was the greatest English poet of the seventeenth century. After William Shakespeare and Ben Jonson, he was the greatest playwright. And he has no peer as a writer of prose, especially literary criticism, and as a translator. John Dryden was an English writer who was the dominant literary figure in Restoration England. Most of his contemporaries based their style of writing on innovations introduced by Dryden in poetry, drama, and literary criticism. The age of Dryden is regarded as superior to that of the others for “sweetness of poetry”. Arnold asks whether Dryden and Pope, poets of great merit, are truly the poetical classics of the 18th century. He says Dryden’s post-script to the readers in his translation of The Aeneid reveals the fact that in prose writing he is even better than Milton and Chapman.Just as the laxity in religious matters during the Restoration period was a direct outcome of the strict discipline of the Puritans, in the same way in order to control the dangerous sway of imagination found in the poetry of the Metaphysicals, to counteract “the dangerous prevalence of imagination”, the poets of the 18th century introduced certain regulations. The restrictions that were imposed on the poets were “uniformity, regularity, precision, and balance”. These restrictions curbed the growth of poetry, and encouraged the growth of prose.\n\nHence we can regard Dryden “as the glorious founder, and Pope as the splendid high priest, of the age of prose and reason, our indispensable 18th century.” Their poetry was that of the builders of an age of prose and reason. Arnold says that Pope and Dryden are not poet classics, but the “prose classics” of the 18th century\n\nOn Thomas Gray:\n\n“He is the scantiest and frailest of the classics in our poetry, but he is a classic.” – Matthew Arnold\n\nBorn in eighteenth-century London, Thomas Gray became one of those few names in English literature that despite a considerably short oeuvre are remembered and celebrated to this date. Often said to have been born in the wrong age and time, Gray led a highly troubled and dissatisfied life, and suffered from frequent bouts of melancholia and depression. But troubled as he was and the little which he wrote, he wrote incredibly well. Mostly remembered for his magnum opus, Elegy Written in a Country Churchyard, Gray wrote the kind of poetry where substance and form, thought and structure perfectly corroborate each other.\n\nOften the subject of many critical evaluations, Arnold, in his Study of Poetry and in several other commentaries, argue that Thomas Gray, often misunderstood and wrongly judged, belonged to the rare species of writers who never “spoke out”.\n\n“”He never spoke out.” In these four words is contained the whole history of Gray, both as a man and as a poet.” ¬– Matthew Arnold\n\nFor Arnold, Gray never “spoke out” rather words fell naturally and spontaneously from his pen. During his evaluation of the eighteenth-century, Arnold argues that it was not Dryden and Pope who were the poetical classics representative of their age, rather Gray who could be called the ultimate poetical classic of his century. In another commentary, Arnold enumerates different opinions that critics over time have had about Gray:\n\n“Cowper writes: “I have been reading Gray’s works, and think him the only poet since Shakespeare entitled to the character of sublime. Perhaps you will remember that I once had a different opinion of him. I was prejudiced.” Adam Smith says: “Gray joins to the sublimity of Milton the elegance and harmony of Pope; and nothing is wanting to render him, perhaps, the first poet in the English language, but to have written a little more.” And, to come nearer to our own times, Sir James Mackintosh speaks of Gray thus: “Of all English poets he was the most finished artist. He attained the highest degree of splendor of which poetical style seemed to be capable.””\n\nAnother reason for Gray not “speaking out” or writing enough is often said to be due to his being born in the wrong age. Eighteenth-century literature was gradually discovering the genre of prose and its possibilities. The greatest writers that the century produced were prose writers, as Arnold states in his discussion on the age of Dryden. In such an age, Gray, who was a born poet, could not blossom or flower the way he deserved to. Thus, Arnold writes:\n\n“Gray, a born poet, fell upon an age of prose. He fell upon an age whose task was such as to call forth in general men’s powers of understanding, wit and cleverness, rather than their deepest powers of mind and soul. As regards literary production, the task of the eighteenth century in England was not the poetic interpretation of the world; its task was to create a plain, clear, straightforward, efficient prose.”\n\nAnd so:\n\n“Coming when he did and endowed as he was, he was a man born out of date, a man whose full spiritual flowering was impossible.”\n\nBut despite the fact that Gray did not enjoy a satisfying and long literary career, he managed to leave the coming generations with a small treasure of some of the finest verse ever written in the English language. For Arnold, Gray remains the most representative poet of the early eighteenth-century before the Romantics. Thomas Gray never “spoke out” because he never had to and because he couldn’t bring himself to. His poetry flowed from him naturally, expectantly and inevitably. Arnold comments:\n\n“Compared, not with the work of the great masters of the golden ages of poetry, but with the poetry of his own contemporaries in general, Gray may be said to have reached, in his style, the excellence at which he aimed.”\n\nPassed away at the age of 54, Gray’s Elegy is the poet’s most loved work, and a poem that could be safely attributed to the poet and to the man himself.\n\nThe curfew tolls the knell of parting day,\n\nThe lowing herd wind slowly o’er the lea,\n\nThe ploughman homeward plods his weary way,\n\nAnd leaves the world to darkness and to me.\n\nOn Burns:\n\nRobert Burns, as Douglas Bush and R. H. Super observed, gets a surprising amount of attention in Arnold’s discussion of poets in The Study of Poetry. There are three explanations of the prominence of Burns in Arnold’s major essay on poetry. Firstly, Arnold is returning to the question that had interested him in exchanges with Clough, the connection between emotion and artistic form. In a letter in which Arnold touched on revolution and the relations between labor and capital, he breaks off abruptly to discuss Burns as an artist. Apparently in reply to Clough, Arnold says, “Burns is certainly an artist implicitly”. The “fiery, reckless energy” of Burns is noted in The Study of Poetry as well as his “sense of the pathos of things”.\n\nArnold’s concern with the admirers of Burns, however, suggests a second explanation, that Arnold is responding to the work of his old friend John Campbell Shairp. Shairp, as the Oxford Professor of Poetry, had given an Oxford lecture on Burns, and in 1879 had published a monograph on Burns; in both, Shairp praised Burns as the Scottish national poet and the poet who celebrated the Scottish peasantry. Arnold’s discussion of Burns in The Study of Poetry may be seen as a part of an argument connected with a larger question that had concerned Arnold in all of his criticism: the kind of poetry that was necessary for a democratic age. Shairp had indeed seen Burns as a poet sympathetic to the people and to the cause of democracy and equality. Arnold seizes the chance to talk about Burns because he wants to say, as he does at the end of the essay, that only the best poetry is adequate for a democratic age. Along with the names of Dryden and Pope, Matthew Arnold also mentions the name of Robert Burns. Burns’ English poems are simple to read. But the real Burns is of course in his Scottish poems.\n\n“By his English poetry Burns in general belongs to the 18th century, and has little importance for us. Evidently this is not the real Burns, or his name and fame would have disappeared long ago. Nor in Clarinda’s love-poet, Sylvander, the real Burns either. The real Burns is of course in his Scottish poems. Let us boldly say that of much of this poetry, a poetry dealing perpetually with Scottish drink, Scottish religion and Scottish manners; he has a tenderness for it. Many of his admirers will tell us that we have Burns, convivial, genuine, delightful, here.”\n\nBurns’ “real poems”, according to Arnold, are those that deal with “Scottish way of life, Scottish drinks, Scottish religion and Scottish manners.” A Scottish man may be familiar with such things, but for an outsider these may sound personal. For supreme practical success more is required. In the opinion of Arnold, Burns comes short of the high seriousness of the great classics, and something remains wanting in his poetry.\n\nLeeze me on drink! It gies us mair Than either school or college; It kindles wit, it waukens lair, It pangs us fou’o knowledge Be’t whisky gill or penny wheep Or any stronger potion, It never fails, on drinking deep, To kittle up our notion\n\nAccording to Arnold, there is an element of bacchanalianism in Burn’s poetry. He refers to many of Burns’ stanzas, and comments:\n\n“There is a great deal of that sort of thing in Burns, and it is unsatisfactory, not because it is bacchanalian poetry, but because it has not that accent of sincerity which bacchanalian poetry, to do it justice, very often has. There is something in it of bravado, something which makes us feel that we have not the man speaking to us with his real voice; as in the famous song For a’ that and a’ that:\n\nA prince can make a belted knight, A marquis, duke, and a’ that; But an honest man’s aboon his might, Guid faith he mauna fa’ that! For a’ that, and a’ that, Their dignities and a’ that, Are higher rank than a’ that.\n\nTo sum up Arnold’s views on Burns, Arnold does not see Burns as belonging to the rank of the ultimate classics in English literature, as, once again, Burns’ poetry lacks “high seriousness”. Burn’s poetry is frivolous, bacchanalian and passionate and is devoid of all the merits that characterize classic poetry. But despite his flaws, Burns remains one of those poets in whose work intensity of passion and spirit merge splendidly and whose work astounds as well as please.\n\nConclusion:\n\nMatthew Arnold, one of foremost critic of 19th century, is often regarded as father of modern English criticism. Arnold’s work as a literary critic started with Preface to Poems in 1853. It is a kind of manifesto of his critical creed. It reflects classicism as well his views on grand poetic style. His most famous piece of literary criticism is his essay The Study of Poetry. In this work he talks about poetry’s “high destiny”. He believes “mankind will discover that we have to turn poetry to interpret life for us, to console us, to sustain us”. Arnold lived in a materialistic world where advancement of science has had led society in a strange darkness. Importance of religion was submerged. People were becoming fact seekers. A gap was being developed and Arnold believed poetry could fill that gap. In his words:\n\n“Our religion has materialized itself in the fact, and the fact is now failing it. But for poetry the idea is everything, the rest is world of illusion, of divine illusion.”\n\nArnold wrote:\n\n“Without poetry our science will appear incomplete; and most of what now passes with religion and philosophy will be replaced by poetry.”\n\nHe had a definite aim in writing poetry. It was the “criticism of life”. By the “criticism of life”, he meant “noble and profound application of ideas of life”. He said poetry should serve a greater purpose instead of becoming a mere medium of gaining pleasure and appreciating beauty. According to him, the best poetry is criticism of life, abiding laws of poetic truth and poetic beauty. By poetic truth he meant representation of life in true way. By poetic beauty he meant manner and style of poetry. He said that a poet should be a man with enormous experience. His intellect should be highly developed by means of enormous reading and deep critical thinking. Arnold said that poetry is an “application of ideas to life”. If the application of ideas is powerful the poetry will become great. He also laid emphasis on the quality of “high seriousness”. It comes with sincerity which the poet feels for his subject. Many critics disagreed with Arnold on this point. T.S. Elliot, a great poet himself, disagreed with this view by saying that Arnold’s view is “frigid to anyone who has felt the full surprise and elevation of new experience in poetry”. Arnold’s classic poets include Dante, Milton, Homer and Shakespeare. He quotes the famous line of Milton:\n\nNor thy life nor hate; but what thou livest\n\nLive well: how long or short, permit to heaven\n\nArnold said poetry should deal with ideas not facts. Ideas should be moral. He said morality should not be taken in narrow sense. He said “poetry of revolt against life; a poetry of indifference towards moral idea is a poetry of indifference towards life”.\n\nUsing metaphors concerning rivers in what would prove subsequently to be a very influential way; Arnold, furthermore, argued that the “stream of English poetry” is only one “contributory stream to the world river of poetry”. He argued that we should “conceive of poetry worthily, and more highly than it has been the custom”, that is, as “capable of higher uses, and called to higher destinies, than those in general which man has assigned to it hitherto”. He contends that we must “turn to poetry to interpret life for us, to console us, to sustain us” because, as Wordsworth put it, it is the ‘breath and finer spirit of all knowledge’ as a result of which it is superior to science, philosophy, and religion. To be “capable of fulfilling such high destinies”, however, poetry must be “of a high order of excellence”. In poetry, for this reason, the “distinction between excellent and inferior, sound and unsound or only half-sound, true and untrue or only half-true, is of paramount importance”.\n\nIt is in poetry that conveys the “criticism of life”. The criticism of life “will be of power in proportion as the poetry conveying it is excellent, rather than inferior, sound rather than unsound or half-sound, true rather than untrue or half-true”. The “best poetry” is that which has a “power of forming, sustaining, and delighting us, as nothing else can”. Its “most precious benefit” is a “clearer, deeper sense of the best in poetry, and of the strength and joy to be drawn from it”. This sense should “govern our estimate of what we read”. Arnold contrasts this, what he terms the “real estimate”, with two other kinds of estimate, the historic estimate and the personal estimate, which are both “fallacies”. The former calculates a poet’s merit on historical grounds, that is, by “regarding a poet’s work as a stage” in the “course and development of a nation’s language, thought, and poetry”. The latter calculates a poet’s merit on the basis of our “personal affinities, likings and circumstances” which may make us “overrate the object of our interest” because the work in question “is, or has been, of high importance” to us personally.\n\nArnold’s most important achievement in The Study of Poetry would have to be the establishment of his system of literary criticism—the touchstone method. It is a comparative analysis which entails the valorization of modern texts by comparing them to the works of such greats as Shakespeare, Milton etc. Though criticized by many critics for its rigidity, Arnold’s theory of proper criticism is one of the most important elements in his essay.\n\nAfter giving an elaborate account of the function and nature of poetry and criticism, Arnold gives a critical account of many of the classics in English literature. He traverses through great names like that of Chaucer, Gray, Dryden, and Burns. About Chaucer, Arnold says that though he is one of the greatest classics of English poetry, he lacks the “high seriousness” that is found in the likes of Shakespeare and Milton. On Dryden, Arnold says that he is one of the finest prose writers of English language and proper prose began from him. Arnold complements Gray and Burns for their great poetry, but again he rejects them as classics as like Chaucer; their poetry lacks the “high seriousness” that must be present in great poetry.\n\nIntroduction\n\nSomewhere nearer to the local vernacular, 30 miles away from Lahore, in the tiny unknown city of Kasur lived an unknown man, named Abdullah Shah, a man whose writings are barely understood even by those who speak his language and which contain amongst them, such enlightening philosophies that even Smith and Kant would have been proud to claim them as their own. Mysterious is the turn of time. The man who had been refused by Mullahs to be buried after his death in the community graveyard because of his unorthodox views, today enjoys worldwide reverence and recognition. Bulleh Shah is universally admitted to have been the greatest of the Punjabi mystics. No Punjabi mystic poet enjoys a wider celebrity and a greater reputation. His poetry has gained immense popularity. He is in fact, the greatest Sufi of the world.\n\nA large amount of what is known about Bulleh Shah comes through legends and is subjective to the point that there isn’t even an agreement among historians concerning his precise date and place of birth. Some facts about his life have been pieced together from his own writings and other facts seem to have been paved down through oral traditions. Bulleh Shah is believed to have been born in 1680 in the small village of Uch, Bahawalpur, Punjab, now Pakistan. When he was six years old his parents relocated to Malakwal, where his father, Shah Muhammed Darwaish, was a preacher in the village mosque and a teacher. Bulleh Shah received his earlier education in Pandoke and then moved to Kasur for higher education. He gained knowledge of Arabic, Persian and the Quran through his traditional teachers. After that, in an effort to move to the next level, he searched for a spiritual guide and eventually he found his Murshid in the form of Inayat Shah Qadri. Although Bulleh Shah was of a much higher Syed caste, yet he accepted Shah Inayat as his spiritual master and subordinated his life to his lower caste Murshid. Much of Bulleh Shah’s verses about love are actually written directly for his spiritual guide, Shah Inayat.\n\nAlthough much of what is known today about Bulleh Shah comes through folklore and is anecdotal, however, what is neither anecdotal nor folklore, are the Punjabi verses that have been authored by Bulleh Shah. His style of writing is called Kafi – an established style of Punjabi poetry used by Punjabi Sufis and Sikh gurus. Though the number is disputed, Bulleh Shah is credited with authoring from fifty to one hundred and fifty Kafi. His life span overlapped with many legendary Punjabi poets like Waris Shah, Shah Abdul Latif Bhattai and Sachal Sarmast.\n\nHis writings represent him as a humanist, someone providing solutions to the sociological problems of the world around him, describing the turbulence his motherland is passing through, while concurrently searching for God. His poetry highlights his mystical spiritual voyage through the four stages of Sufism: Shariat (path), Tariqat (observance) , Haqiqat (truth)and Marfat ( union).This simplicity with which Bulleh Shah has been able to address the complex fundamental issues of life and humanity is a large part of his appeal.\n\nHis time was marked with communal strife between Muslims and Sikhs, but in that age Bulleh Shah was a beacon of hope and peace for the citizens of Punjab. As a poet, he is different from the other Sufi poets and represents that strong and living pious nature of Punjabi character which is more reasonable than emotional or passionate. He practiced the Sufi tradition of Punjabi poetry established by poets like Shah Hussain and Shah Sharaf. He thus pleaded to reach to Allah through the love of humanity and tameness of inner self.\n\nBulleh Shah was an evolved soul, a perfect faqir and a true lover. Through the love of his master, he realized the Lord. His life and writings are replete with subtle secrets of the path. They not only strengthen the love of a true lover but also encourage him to undergo the hardships for reaching the spiritual goal. His life and writings will serve as a lighthouse from times immemorial to true seekers of spiritual realization.\\\n\nIt’s All in One Contained & Strange are the Times\n\nBulleh Shah was the greatest Sufi poet of Punjab. His pure life and high spiritual attainments have made Bulleh Shah’s poetry very popular among every community. Considered as the greatest mystic poet of Punjab, his compositions have been regarded as, ‘the pinnacle of Sufi literature’. In his poetry, he preaches love, humanity and tolerance. It highlights the philosophy of reunion with God. He criticizes the religious orthodoxy of his day, and revolted against the no go areas of Muslim Mullahs and pleaded to reach Allah through love of humanity and tameness of inner self. Bulleh Shah’s poetry can prove very helpful in bringing tremendous change in this world of today, where people habitually magnify hatred or differences based on the racial prejudices.\n\nIt’s All in One Contained is a poem by Bulleh shah, emphasizing on the oneness of God. The poem highlights the philosophy of reunion with God. Bulleh Shah conveyed that the spiritual progress lay in detaching one’s mind from the outside world and attaching it to the God within. He preaches divine love. He condemns all futile ways for searching God. He believes that Man and God are inseparable. He says that the Beloved is not apart from me. Without the Beloved, there is nothing. But there is no eye to judge. Doing good and serving humanity, is in fact serving God. He advises us to study only one single point in which all knowledge is contained, and to leave all other calculations. He strictly disapproves the hypocritical religious or social behavior of the people, and condemns the malicious or greedy behavior of mullahs, hafiz or common people, who run after accumulating wealth, gaining high positions, lusting in his mind for enjoyment. They become evil and they start drowning spiritually into the polluted ocean of their worldly wishes. They lose their attachment with the Pivot. They indulge in a sinful life and lose their humanity. Meanwhile, if they perform the religious practices, they become just affection to impress others as they are very virtuous.\n\n“In vain, you rub your forehead on the ground and you display a long visible mark on it.”\n\nBy prostrating during the prayer, the forehead gets rubbed and gets a mark, Bulleh Shah says, “Why do you show this mark as a mark of your piety?”\n\nIn second kafi, Strange are the Times, Bulleh Shah expounds on the mysteries of changing times. According to various scholars, this kafi teaches us that when things deteriorate, God re-adjusts the world. This kafi represents the tumultuous time in the history of Punjab when the Mughal Empire was declining and the Sikhs were uprising. He presented various absurdities in the kafi, which presents how the natural order of the things have been changed. Those who were once kings, have now been lowered to the level of the slaves, the crows sweep on hawks and sparrows do eagles stalk. At the end of the Kafi, Bullah gives the message that although the time has been changed yet people must accept this change as the God’s will and no matter how incomprehensible this life will get, the love of God will soon get us through this.\n\nIt’s All in One Contained:\n\nThe verse form Bulleh Shah primarily employed is called the Kafi, a style of Punjabi, Sindhi and Siraiki poetry used not only by the Sufis of Sindh and Punjab, but also by Sikh gurus. Bulleh Shah’s poetry and philosophy strongly criticizes Islamic religious orthodoxy of his day.\n\nWhat use is it bowing one’s head?\n\nTo what avail has prostrating led?\n\nReading Kalma you make them laugh\n\nAbsorbing not a word while the Quran you quaff\n\nThe truth must be here and there sustained\n\nIt’s all in One contained\n\nThe kafi, “It’s All in One Contained” emphasizes the oneness of God. Bulleh Shah says that: Be one with the One and only the Almighty Creator, leave all complicated sources you have made to reach him, free yourself from the fear of hell, make your heart grand, and only then you will understand. But what do you do? You just rub your forehead against earth, you show off that you offer prayers, you profess to believe him just to impress people, but you don’t try to truly understand by using your heart, can’t you see that to find truth you need to search, but you limit yourself to few religious rituals. But what many do? They perform Hajj, then they even show off by their very apparel, and even during Hajj they don’t cease to usurp the rights of others (humans), how could you justify that? How could reality be denied? Then there are ones (birds) which go in search of food on a day to day basis, and there you are, on the other hand, who tire yourself for future and thus do nothing except to waste your own self. But when you submit yourself completely to your Murshid (teacher) you become one with God, you get indifferent to the world and get drunk in that ecstasy to find Him, you don’t wish anything, you don’t ask for anything in fact you appear as you have gone dumb, and then your heart is immensely cleansed. The truth is that there is nothing but the One.\n\nWhat use is it bowing one’s head?\n\nTo what avail has prostrating led?\n\nReading Kalma you make them laugh\n\nAbsorbing not a word while the Quran you quaff\n\nThe truth must be here and there sustained\n\nIt’s all in One contained\n\nThe Point or Dot is the starting point of anything or everything. The Dot explodes with Big Bang and becomes the universe. The explosion’s effects are dynamic. The Universe continues to expand. In this universe there are microcosms: the earth, man, his spirit, etc. All emanates from one point.\n\nThere are the birds that go in search of a grain, mere grain. They trust their God. They don’t store food. They praise God every morning. On the other hand there is a man who is so mistrustful, who is so concerned about his future, who torments himself in search of food, in search of money, in search of fame. He has no idea what his life is about. He’s been tiring himself for ages. He isn’t even sure about his future, still he likes to store for years. Bullah says they are senseless people who don’t know the meaning of life. What they’d get from these stored grains if they didn’t get to see a future? He is not going to last forever. His life is a short phase which he has to face. It’s a very short period then why is he drying himself up? We’ve lost our trust in God. We accept the concept of “God” and afterlife and yet we lack belief. And when Moaazan says Azaan, sometimes a man is too busy to pay attention to the call of his God. A man gets too tired that at night when he comes back home he becomes too ignorant to offer Isha prayer, because he’s been working all day for his family’s future. And what if there’s no future? What if this future word is only being used to escape the present? We’ve lost happiness. We’ve lost peace; we are living a life of misery just because we’ve lost our identity. We’ve lost our belief in God. We’ve forgotten the purpose of life. It’s all in One contained means we just need to know God. We have to believe in his oneness and his greatness. Then our desires would be finished. We will feel real ecstasy in the mere remembrance of Allah.\n\nIt will lead you to mystic abandon\n\nAnd help you to get attuned to the Lord\n\nIt’s the truth that Bulleh has gained\n\nIt’s all in One contained\n\nBulleh Shah was one of the greatest Sufi poets of all time. He has delineated his spiritual journey of a Sufi through various stages as known to his times in his poetry, these being: Shariat, Tariqat, Haqiqat and Marfat. He started his spiritual journey as a conformist.Shariat is the preliminary stage when the Salik conforms to the Sharia or the code of conduct as dictated by Islam. It is saying prayers five times a day, observing fasts during the month of Ramadan, besides faith in the supremacy of God and Prophet Mohammad as His Messenger. It is said that Bulleh Shah knew the text of the Holy Quran by heart. The way he quotes the Islamic scriptures in his verse speaks volumes for it. Says Bulleh Shah:\n\nUnderstand the One and forget the rest,\n\nShake off your ways of a non-believer\n\nLeading to the grave and to hell, in quest.\n\nBulleh Shah advises us to study the One point in which all knowledge is condensed, and to leave all other calculations aside. All other pretentions rituals are futile. He tells us to be far away from people who talk about kufar.Kufar is a term in Islam for something that is related to non-belief. Someone who commits or talks kufar is doomed to go to hell for eternity. One who believes goes to heaven. Bulleh Shah asks everyone to remove these punishments and rewards from their lives. And to cleanse ones heart of desires of going to heaven. The point of knowledge resides in such a heart and who understands it, he doesn’t need to understand anything else.\n\nThe point of these lines is that repetition of religious content without contemplation and clean heart is useless. Sort of like that saying:\n\nHands that help are holier than the lips that pray.\n\nIf someone needs help, it is much better to have good intentions and help out that person. Even if you do not do rituals, if your heart is pure, you are better off than people visiting temples and mosques every day to get pardoned of their sins.\n\nStrange are the Times:\n\nThe Mughals quaff the cup of poison.\n\nThose with coarse blankets are up.\n\nThe genteel watch it all in quiet,\n\nThey have a humble pie to sup.\n\nThe tide of the times is in spate.\n\nThe Punjab is in a fearsome state.\n\nWe have to share the hell of a fate.\n\nBaba Bulleh Shah was one of the greatest humanist, philosopher, rebel, internationalist, teacher and Sufi poet of all times.Bulleh Shah, the greatest mystic poet of Punjab, had lived the most tumultuous period of the subcontinent history and was a Punjabi Sufi poet and humanist. The verse form Bulleh Shah primarily employed is called the Kafi (Refrain), a traditional style of Punjabi poetry used by Punjabi Sufis and Sikh gurus. A common theme of his poetry is the pursuit of self-knowledge that is essential for the mystical union with the Beloved.\n\nBulleh Shah clearly established that human relations and consciousness are determined by historical conditions. Bulleh Shah was witnessing the declining Mughal empire, its ruling elites’ downfall while the Sikh movement was rising. ‘Bhurian wale raje keete’ (the blanket-wearing people are becoming rulers) is understood to be a reference to Sikh guerillas which comprised the artisans and poorest section of the Sikh Jatts of Punjab. Some Sikh literary critics have interpreted Bulleh Shah’s symbol of “Bhurian wale” as a slight but they fail to understand that Sufis preferred “Bhura” over the Mullah’s white sheet. Though Sikhs had not captured state power by then, Bulleh Shah’s sharp eyes could see where history was heading.\n\nThe Iraqis are despised\n\nWhile the donkey are prized.\n\nStrange are the times!\n\nAccording to the scholars the kafi, Strange are the Times, of Bulleh Shah reflects a tumultuous time in the history of Punjab. The poet perceives radical changes taking place in society around him. This was the middle of 18th century when the Sikh power was in the ascendancy and the Mughal power was waning. The 18th century was one of the most troubled times in Punjab: the Mughal empire was declining and there were uprisings all around; it was a time of chaos as there was no law and order. Bulleh Shah sees rampant corruption and societal decay. The general tone of the poem is pessimistic, as is obvious.\n\nIn this kafi, Bulleh shah presents logical absurdities and impossibilities like:\n\nCrows swoop on hawks\n\nSparrows do eagles stalk\n\nStrange are the times!\n\nThese absurdities show that how the natural order of things has had been completely reversed. The prey and the predator have changed places. This refers to the decline of the Mughal Empire that how once those who were the conquerors are now at the mercy of their conquered. With the Sikh uprising and the repeated attacks by Abdali, the Mughal dynasty from Aurangzeb and especially after his death, was speedily going downhill. Bulleh Shah, despite being a Sufi, was a keen observer of everything around him, could see how times were changing.\n\nEven if seen without its political context, this kafi is representative of the religious and ethical conditions of the time in which it was written. Bulleh Shah says:\n\nThere is no accord between fathers and sons,\n\nNor any between mothers and daughters\n\nThe truthful ones are being pushed about,\n\nthe tricksters are seated close by.\n\nBulleh Shah has perfectly captured the moral degeneration of his time. It was a time of anarchy, social and moral corruption and injustice. Religion had become only a set of rituals for the Muslims and, instead of using it for their spiritual exaltation, it had become a matter of appearances. It is for this reason that we can find in most of Bulleh Shah’s kafis social commentaries and critique on the hypocrisy of the so-called religious figures of his time.Also, another point worth noting is that in one translation of the kafi, Bullah seems to be resigned to the situation around.\n\nThose in tatters have turned into kings,\n\nthe kings have taken to begging\n\nO Bulleh, that which is His command\n\nwho can alter His decree.\n\nOn one side, he seems to be flaunting God’s omnipotence, but on the other side, the note of pessimism and despair also resonate. But in another translation, the kafi ends as:\n\nIt’s not without reason or rhyme ,\n\nStrange are the times!\n\nSays Bulleh, kill your ego\n\nAnd throw away your pride.\n\nYou need to forget yourself\n\nTo find Him by your side.\n\nThis alternative translation of the kafi has a more optimistic note to it. Bullah says that despite the fragility of time and the mayhem of events around, believers can still make it through by putting their trust in the wisdom of God and trusting Him to always help in all times. Obedience to God will lead to a close relationship with Him, and God never deserts those He loves. So, this translation completely changes the meaning of the kafi and ends on a positive and an optimistic note. But the first translation expresses feelings of despair and resignation. Bullah still seems to be exalting God and his ultimate power, but there seems to be no constructive message to the reader. The kafi seems to be saying that although times have completely gone topsy-turvy, one must simply accept them as God’s will. But the second translation says that no matter how incomprehensible life gets, the love of God shall get us through.The language of this kafi, considering both translations, is simple and straightforward. In the first translation, the refrain “Strange are the times!” occurs at the end of the each stanza, but in the second translation, there is no refrain. Bulleh Shah makes use of several common images, and this kafi is easy to understand by the layman. However, to appreciate its message completely, one must refer to the socio-political scene of Bulleh’s time, and its conditions.\n\nBulleh Shah’s Concept of Rabb:\n\nMullah and Pundit became old reciting the name of God\n\nDespite many prostrations, they could not find any clue of God.\n\nThe Holy Quran indicates that in your heart dwells God.\n\nBulleh says only those who kill their desires find God.\n\nBulleh Shah’s concept of God is central to his poetry. Without understanding Bulleh’s spiritual and religious beliefs, one cannot properly appreciate the depth of his poetry.\n\nTear down the mosque and temple too, break all that divides\n\nBut do not break the human heart as it is there that God resides.\n\nBulleh Shah was a Sufi poet who lived in Pakistan from 1680 to 1758. His given name was Abdullah Shah, Bulleh was a nickname and it is the name he chose to use as a poet. Bullah traveled to Lahore in search of a Murshid (master). He found Hazrat Shah Inayat, a well-known Qadiri Sufi and gardener by profession. He asked Inayat, “I wish to know how to realize God.” Inayat Shah replied, “What is the problem in finding God? One only needs to be uprooted from here and replanted there.” Inayat graced Bulleh with the secret of spiritual insight and the Knowledge of God.\n\nSeek your master, say your prayers and\n\nsurrender to God.\n\nIt will lead you to mystic abandon\n\nAnd help you to get attuned to the Lord\n\nIt’s the truth that Bulleh has gained\n\nIt’s all in One contained\n\n-Hold fast to your Murshid\n\nBecome a devotee of all creation,\n\nIntoxicated, carefree,\n\nWithout desire, indifferent to the world.\n\nLet your heart be fully clean.\n\nBullah asks, can the truth then be stopped?\n\nAt this one point, all talk ends.\n\nBulleh Shah’s poetry highlights the philosophy of a reunion with God. He believes that Man (creation) and God (Creator) are inseparable. He says that the Beloved is not apart from me. Without the Beloved there is nothing. But there is no eye to judge. Doing good and serving humanity is in fact serving God. Bulleh Shah preaches divine love, and for delivering his message of love to the reader, he employs a genre of poetry called the Kafi.\n\nBulleh Shah! I will never die.\n\nSomeone else is lying in the grave.\n\nHere Bulleh Shah says that by being one with God, he has become immortal. He will never die. The dead body in the grave does not belong to him. It belongs to dust, matter, and earth. Soul is universally superior to the body. The Body is the dress of soul. So the main emphasis should be on purifying the soul. It must not become impure. Anger, lust, greed, jealousy, enmity, bad behavior, pride and hatred make it impure.\n\nThe Sufi cult is akin to mysticism. It is believed in some quarters that it was born out of interaction between Semitic Islam and Aryan Vedantism on the soil of India. This is not the whole truth. Sufism took birth in Arabia in the ninth century. However, the Aryan perceptions in Iran and then in India influenced it a great deal, more particularly in accentuating the emotional content as against the dry-as-dust self-denial of the Arabs. The Arabs laid stress on asceticism and disciplining of the body, while the later Sufis in Iran and India, under the influence of Greek philosophy, Platonic ideology, Christian faith, Vedantist thinking, Buddhist lore, etcetera believed in leading an emotionally ~rich life. They drank and danced and advocated that physical love could sublimate itself into spiritual love. They had faith in God: they loved the Prophet but they maintained that the Murshid or Guru could also lead to realization of the Divine Reality.\n\nLiterally speaking, a Sufi is one who is pure or one who goes about with a woolen blanket. In Greek, he is a Sufi who is enlightened. The cardinal features of the Sufi cult are:\n\na) God exists in all and all exist in God.\n\nb) Religion is only a way of life; it does not necessarily lead to Nirvana.\n\nc) All happenings take place as per the will of God; nothing happens if He does not ordain it,\n\nd) The soul is distinct from the physical body and will merge into Divine Reality according to\n\na person’s deeds,\n\ne) It is the Guru whose grace shows the way and leads to union with God.\n\nThe Sufis loved God as one would love one’s sweetheart. God for a Sufi is the husband and humankind his wife, Man must serve, love, undergo asceticism, gain enlightenment and then get merged in God, The Indian Sufis laid stress on repeating the Name (Japu), concentration (Dhyan) and meditation (habs-i-dam). A Sufi must eschew sin, repent, live a simple and contented life and should look for the grace of the Murshid or Guru. The Sufis maintain that the soul has been separated from the Divine Reality and the supreme mission of human life is to achieve union with God.\n\nAccording to Bulleh Shah, the road to the union with God begins with Shariat or the observance to the rituals of Islam. The second stage is that of Tariqat.\n\nIf Bulleh Shah’s verse is any guide, he did not take long to leave Shariat as a spiritual path behind. At best, he employed it as a stepping-stone. He moved on to Tariqat which is an important landmark in a Salik’s career. The cardinal feature of this stage is the assistance provided by the Murshid or Guru. In fact, what Sharia does in the life of a common devotee, Tariqat does in the case of a Sufi. The literal meaning of Tariqat is manner or observance. Tariqat according to Bulleh Shah is the bridge which helps the seeker pass the arduous path of hard spiritual exercises with the help of the Murshid. The Guru or Murshid is like the philosopher’s stone which converts metal into gold. Good deeds are the dowry that the bride collects at this stage and then qualifies for union with the lord. In the first instance, Bulleh Shah discards the rituals and the ceremonials prescribed by the Shariat:\n\nBurn the prayer mat, break the water pot,\n\nQuit the rosary and care not for the staff.\n\nHaqiqat is the third stage of his spiritual journey to which Bulleh Shah refers time and again in his verse. The devotee understands and accepts the existence of God. God is truth. God exists in everything around us. This concept has been described in the Sufi idiom as Hamaost. When the Salik comes to realize it, he no longer discriminates between the Hindu and the Muslim, and the temple and the mosque. He hears the call of the Muezzin in the flute-strains of an idol worshipper:\n\nPour not on prayers, forget the fasts.\n\nWipe off Kalma from the sight.\n\nBulleh has found his lover within,\n\nOthers grope in the pitch-dark night.\n\nWhat a spark of knowledge is kindled ~\n\nI find that I am neither Hindu nor Turk.\n\nI am a lover by creed;\n\nA lover is victorious even when swindled.\n\nMarfat is the last stage of the spiritual evolution of a Sufi. It is the merging into Divine Reality called Fana and thus attaining the life eternal known in the Sufi idiom as Baqa. The Murshid helps the seeker arrive at this stage but it is the grace which makes possible the ultimate union. The moment this happens, caste and creed cease to have any meaning. The Atma (Soul) and Paramatma (God) become one. When Bulleh attained this stage, the entire world appeared to him as a reflection of the Divine Reality, Bulleh has merged in God:\n\nRemembering Ranjha day and night,\n\nI’ve become Ranjha myself.\n\nCall me Dhido Ranjha,\n\nNo more I be addressed as Heer.\n\nI abuse Ranjha but adore him in my heart.\n\nRanjha and Heer are a single soul,\n\nNo one could ever set them apart.\n\nBulleh Shah as a Humanist:\n\nBulleh Shah’s writings represent him as a humanist, someone providing solutions to the sociological problems of the world around him as he lives through it, describing the turbulence his motherland of Punjab is passing through, while concurrently searching for God. His poetry highlights his mystical spiritual voyage through the four stages of Sufism: Shariat (Path), Tariqat (Observance), Haqiqat (Truth) and Marfat (Union). The simplicity with which Bulleh Shah has been able to address the complex fundamental issues of life and humanity is a large part of his appeal. His humanism lies in his depicting the troubles that were being faced by the Muslims of his time, his rejection of caste system, and in his concept of God.\n\nBulleh Shah preaches that how knowledge is used by various levels of the religious establishment and how it makes them degenerates, and compares them with Satan who was the most learned angel of God but went against God’s will. For Bulleh Shah real knowledge comes from history and real-life experiences. In the following Kafi, he points out that he has acquired the understanding of the world from the course of history where anarchy shows the naked realities hidden under the ongoing states affair. For example in the following Kafi he predicts his understanding of the reality of socio-economic relations within society and how they can be put upside down with the change of time:\n\nTimes have gone upside down\n\nThat is how I discovered the secret of love\n\nBulleh Shah was witnessing the declining Mughal Empire, its ruling elites’ downfall while the Sikh movement was rising. Though Sikhs had not captured state power by then, Bulleh Shah’s sharp eyes could see where history was heading. That is why he states:\n\nThe crows are killing eagles\n\nThe sparrows have put hunting birds down\n\nThe blanket [wearing] people have become kings\n\nThe kings are made to beg\n\nBullah, this is the dictation from the Supreme\n\nWho can stop it?\n\nThe real duty of a humanist is to depict the society’s circumstances and evaluate them. Bulleh Shah has done this job in the above Kafi. Bulleh Shah clearly established that human relations and consciousness are determined by historical conditions. In the verse ‘ hukam hazoroon’ (Orders from the Supreme), he affirmed the concept of a pre-determined historical process but also unearthed the dynamics of change where the weakest can conquer the most powerful.\n\nBulleh Shah aptly discovered the basic contradictions of the society that were reflecting in religious differentiations. The following verse highlights his understanding of the essence of conflicts among people:\n\nSomewhere he is called Ramdas and elsewhere Fateh Muhammad\n\nThis dispute is from eternity\n\nOnce the quarrel between them was settled\n\nSomething else came out of it.\n\nWithin the bounded scope of “dictations from the Supreme” or history, real knowledge leads one to relate to humanity, nature and the universe. This goal can be achieved only through first surrendering your ego in front of your Murshid (spiritual master) and fall in deep love with this relationship:\n\nJad main sabq ishq da parhia\n\nDaryia waikh wahdat de wr’iya\n\nGhuman Gharian de vich ar’ia\n\nShah Inayat laiya par.\n\n[When I learned the lesson of love\n\nI entered the river of unity\n\nI was trapped in whirlwinds\n\nShah Inayat helped me to get across.]\n\nAs the last line of the Kafi indicates, Bulleh Shah became a follower of Sufi Shah Inayat Qadiri, who was a member of the Arain tribe of Lahore. For Bulleh Shah taking an Arain as his Murshid was an act of declassing, or surrendering his ego and negating the ingrained caste system. He was probably the only classical Punjabi who openly expressed ishq (love) for his Guru.\n\n“For a distinguished scholar [Bulleh Shah], who belonged to the line of Prophet Mohammed (PBUH), to accept an ordinary vegetable grower as his master was a very extraordinary event in the social conditions of Bulleh Shah’s times. It was like an explosion which shook the prevailing social structure.” (The Life of Bulleh Shah)\n\nWe find this expected reaction in his Kafi:\n\nTo admonish Bullah came his sisters and sisters-in-law,\n\nWhy have you brought disgrace to the prophet\n\nAnd to the progeny of Ali?\n\nListen to our advice, O Bullah, and leave the hem of the Arain’s skirt.\n\nThe reply to this reveals his humanistic attitude rather than the extremist. Bullah preached fearlessly that the guidance of a Master was indispensable for spiritual realization, and the caste of the Master did not at all matter in this pursuit. Even if he belonged to the lowest caste, his help would still remain indispensable. Thus, he proclaimed at the top of his voice that pride in being a Sayyed would land one in hell, and the one who held the skirt of a Master like Inayat Shah would enjoy the pleasures of heaven.\n\nLet anyone, who calls me a Sayyiad,\n\nBe punished with tortures of hell,\n\nAnd let him revel in the pleasures of heaven,\n\nWho labels me an Arain.\n\nIf you seek the pleasures of the spring season,\n\nBecome a slave of the Arain.\n\nThis quarrel of caste system disturbed him so much that he expressed this notion of annoyance in one of his Kafi as:\n\nChal Bullehya chal othey chaliye jithey saray annay\n\nNa koi saadi zaat pehchany, na koi sanu mannay\n\n(O’ Bulleh Shah let’s go there where everyone is blind\n\nWhere no one recognizes our caste and where no one believes in us)\n\nBulleh Shah articulated the role of organized religion and other obscurantist ideologies that were employed to sustain an uneven and unjust society. Bulleh Shah aptly discovered the basic contradictions of the society that were reflecting in religious differentiations. So, he declared himself unknown in one of his Kafi to degrade the class, caste and social status system. When he says I am unknown he is professing his humanistic view that is free from all the restrictions.\n\nNa main momin vich maseeta\n\nNa mai vich kufr diyaan reetaan\n\nNa mai paakaan vich paleetaan\n\nNa mai Musa na Firaun\n\nBulleh ki jana mai kaun\n\n[Neither am I a believer in the mosque\n\nNeither am I an infidel\n\nNeither amongst the virtuous nor amongst the sinners\n\nNeither am I Moses nor the Pharaoh\n\nBulleh, who knows who I am]\n\nInayat Qadiri’s alienation with Bulleh Shah is a much-talked-about myth in which it is claimed that he had to learn dancing and went back to his Murshid dancing in female attire. The cue of this myth is taken from Bulleh’s famous Kafi:\n\nTere ishq nachaiya kar ke thayya thayya\n\n(Your love made me dance beat by beat)\n\nSuch was the devotional attitude of Bulleh Shah. Bulleh Shah, taught people to liberate themselves from the prison of bigotry. Bullah’s message through much of his poetry matches his broad perspective of universality that is much deeper than the mere appraisal of natural beauty—it has deep roots that reach down to the human soul and human heart. This concept is larger than life: divinity to universality and then to spirituality; all are interconnected and cannot be separated. This interrela"
