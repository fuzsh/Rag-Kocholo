        "text": "Francis Russell O'Hara (June 27, 1926 – July 25, 1966)\n\nMy Heart\n\nI'm not going to cry all the time\n\nnor shall I laugh all the time,\n\nI don't prefer one \"strain\" to another.\n\nI'd have the immediacy of a bad movie,\n\nnot just a sleeper, but also the big,\n\noverproduced first-run kind. I want to be\n\nat least as alive as the vulgar. And if\n\nsome aficionado of my mess says \"That's\n\nnot like Frank!\", all to the good! I\n\ndon't wear brown and grey suits all the time,\n\ndo I? No. I wear workshirts to the opera,\n\noften. I want my feet to be bare,\n\nI want my face to be shaven, and my heart--\n\nyou can't plan on the heart, but\n\nthe better part of it, my poetry, is open.\n\nFrank O’Hara was born Francis Russell O’Hara in Baltimore on June 27, 1926 to a middle class Catholic family and was soon afterwards moved to Grafton, Massachusetts. During his youth, he recognized early on, his own homosexuality, and thus broke with the Catholic church and rejected all religious beliefs. During that time, O’Hara studied piano and played proficiently and was heading toward becoming a great pianist and composer by 17 (he studied piano at the New England Conservatory in Boston from 1941 to 1944). In 1944, he began a 2 year stint in the navy and served as a member of the shore patrol as well as served on the destroyer U.S.S. Nicholas. Though he was never in combat, he was exposed to it. When he returned in 1946, he attended Harvard and decided to major in English, not music. He met John Ashberry his senior year at a party. In that time, he was already a dedicated and serious writer who considered poetry his saving force from death. In 1950, he earned a master’s at the University of Michigan, and then joined Ashberry in New York where he secured a desk job at the Museum of Modern Art. Frank O’Hara lovedNew York City. It’s evident in his poetry – its many gestures of love for the city and its pleasures. He has become known as America’s most enthusiastic poet of city life. Frank O’Hara was very social and had numerous lovers, one being Joe LeSueur, whom he roomed with in New York for 11 years.\n\nWhile in New York, O’Hara became a central figure in the art and literary scene, during one of its most creative periods (abstract expressionism movement). He wrote influential art criticism and was friends with painters such as Willem de Kooning and Larry Rivers (he even appears in some of his paintings). He was a curator who was “at home” among the group of newly emerging artists, bringing a non-establishment style into the art world.\n\nOn July 24, 1966, O’Hara was struck by a beach buggy on Fire Island when he and his friends were waiting for a beach taxi to pick them up after a party. He died the next morning.\n\nO’Hara wrote prolifically. He got his writing done in spur of the moment opportunities, whenever there was time and inspiration (lunch breaks, parties, etc). Many of his poems were left around his apartment or sent in letters to friends. By the time of his death in 1966, he had published only a fraction of more than 700 poems he wrote in his lifetime. His first book was A City Winter and Other Poems (1952), followed by Oranges (1953), and Meditations in an Emergency (1957 – his first book with a commercial press). O’Hara first received national attention when his work was published in Donald Allen’s anthology, The New American Poetry 1945-1960. All the volumes published during his life contained no more than half of his poetry; only 1 book of poems (Lunch Poems) was available outside of New York in his lifetime. Frank O'Hara has been criticized for his subject matter, that what he writes about are not necessarily the subjects found in \"good poetry.\" However, he is a life poet, who seems to write on the transience of being and experiencing, where he establishes a sense of formlessness (rather than order) in his poetry. In his opinion, he disliked theorizing about poetry where his attitude towards the craft of poetry was that \"there ought not to be much.\" And when it comes to his poetry, there's a sense that he's not moralizing, rather he aims to capture the fleeting pleasures of observances and feelings, creating poetry with an alluring and desiring pull.\n\nO’Hara’s Books (published during his lifetime)\n\nA City Winter and Other Poems.\n\nOranges: 12 pastorals.\n\nMeditations in an Emergency.\n\nSecond Avenue.\n\nOdes.\n\nLunch Poems.\n\nLove Poems (Tentative Title)\n\nA statement made by O’Hara on writing poetry: \" if you’re going to buy a pair of pants you want them to be tight enough so everyone will want to go to bed with you.\" Click below to read more.\n\nPOEMS!\n\nFrom A City Winter\n\nAt night Chinamen jump\n\non Asia with a thump\n\nwhile in our willful way\n\nwe, in secret, play\n\naffectionate games and bruise\n\nour knees like China’s shoes.\n\nThe birds push apples through\n\ngrass the moon turns blue,\n\nThese apples roll beneath\n\nour buttocks like a heath\n\nfull of Chinese thrushes\n\nflushed from China’s bushes.\n\nAs we love at night\n\nbirds sing out of sight,\n\nChinese rhythms beat\n\nthrough us in our heat,\n\nthe apples and the birds\n\nmove us like soft words,\n\nwe couple in the grace\n\nof that mysterious race.\n\nLet's take a walk, you\n\nand I in spite of the\n\nweather if it rains hard\n\non our toes\n\nwe'll stroll like poodles\n\nand be washed down a\n\ngigantic scenic gutter\n\nthat will be\n\nexciting! voyages are not\n\nall like this you just put\n\nyour toes together then\n\nmaybe blood\n\nwill get meaning and a trick\n\nbecome slight in our keeping\n\nbefore we sail the open sea it's\n\npossible--\n\nAnd the landscape will do\n\nus some strange favour when\n\nwe look back at each other\n\nanxiously\n\nA City Winter\n\n1\n\nI understand the boredom of the clerks\n\nfatigue shifting like dunes within their eyes\n\na frightful nausea gumming up the works\n\nthat once was thought aggression in disguise.\n\nDo you remember? then how lightly dead\n\nseemed the moon when over factories\n\nit languid slid like a barrage of lead\n\nabove the heart, the fierce inventories\n\nof desire. Now women wander our dreams\n\ncarrying money and to our sleep's shame\n\nour hands twitch not for swift blood-sunk triremes\n\nnor languorous white horses nor ill fame,\n\nbut clutch the groin that clouds a pallid sky\n\nwhere tow'rs are sinking in their common eye.\n\n2\n\nMy ship is flung upon the gutter's wrist\n\nand cries for help of storm to violate\n\nthat flesh your curiosity too late\n\nhas flushed.

All faint, at rest,\n\nyet I am racing towards the fear that kills\n\nthem off, friends and lovers, hast'ning through tears\n\nlike alcohol high in the throat of hills\n\nand hills of night, alluring! their black cheers\n\nfalling upon my ears like nails. And there\n\nthe bars grow thick with onanists and camps\n\nand bivouacs of bears with clubs, are fair\n\nwith their blows, deal death beneath purple lamps\n\nand to me! I run! closer always move,\n\ncrying my name in fields of dead I love.\n\n5\n\nI plunge deep within this frozen lake\n\nwhose mirrored fastnesses fill up my heart,\n\nwhere tears drift from frivolity to art\n\nall white and slobbering, and by mistake\n\nare the sky. I'm no whale to cruise apart\n\nin fields impassive of my stench, my sake,\n\nmy sign to crushing seas that fall like fake\n\npillars to crash! to sow as wake my heart\n\nand don't be niggardly. The snow drifts low\n\nand yet neglects to cover me, and I\n\ndance just ahead to keep my heart in sight.\n\nHow like a queen, to seek with jealous eye\n\nthe face that flees you, hidden city, white\n\nswan.

He began writing poems as early as 1904 and studied Latin and Greek at the Cambridge Latin High School. He received his B.A. in 1915 and his M.A. in 1916, both from Harvard.\n\nIn 1917, Cummings' first published poems appeared in the anthology Eight Harvard Poets. The same year, Cummings left the United States for France as a volunteer ambulance driver in World War I. Five months after his assignment, however, he and a friend were interned in a prison camp by the French authorities on suspicion of espionage (an experience recounted in his novel, The Enormous Room) for his outspoken anti-war convictions.\n\nDuring his lifetime, Cummings received a number of honors, including an Academy of American Poets Fellowship, two Guggenheim Fellowships, the Charles Eliot Norton Professorship at Harvard, the Bollingen Prize in Poetry in 1958, and a Ford Foundation grant.\n\nAt the time of his death, September 3, 1962, he was the second most widely read poet in the United States, after Robert Frost. He is buried in Forest Hills Cemetery in Boston, Massachusetts.”\n\nPoetry:\n\nE.e.’s popularity may have derived from the attractive subjects (such as war and sex) and accessible language that usually permeate his works. However, the content of his poetry is secondary to his ability to extend beyond using craft by making poetry itself a craft. As a cubist artist, the holistic experience of words, the framing of image, and the slipperiness of construction (including syntax and punctuation), makes e.e.’s poetry a piece to be heard, not merely read. And they are not meant to be read (merely as a form of comprehension), but rather seen. Essentially, the texture of his pieces does not only lie in their audible value, but rather in their appearance on the page (e.e. is known for the usages of white space as a literal canvas, in which the words compose a mosaic). This Avant-garde imagist approach was influenced by those like Ezra Pound and Gertrude Stein. View the poems below to see how e.e. straddles the line between elevating form over function and vice-versa.\n\nl(a\n\nle\n\naf\n\nfa\n\nll\n\ns)\n\none\n\nl\n\niness\n\n********************\n\nit may

there looking at each other having the\n\nfastest time because they've never met before\n\ndead's more even than how many ways of sitting on\n\nyour head your unnatural hair has in the morning\n\ndead's clever too like POF goes the alarm off and the\n\nlittle striker having the best time tickling away every-\n\nbody's brain so everybody just puts out their finger\n\nand they stuff the poor thing all full of fingers\n\ndead has a smile like the nicest man you've never met\n\nwho maybe winks at you in a streetcar and you pretend\n\nyou don't but really you do see and you are My how\n\nglad he winked and hope he'll do it again\n\nor if it talks about you somewhere behind your back it\n\nmakes your neck feel pleasant and stoopid and if\n\ndead says may i have this one and was never intro-\n\nduced you say Yes because you know you want it to\n\ndance with you and it wants to and it can dance and\n\nWhocares\n\ndead's fine like hands do you see that water flowerpots\n\nin windows but they live higher in their house than\n\nyou so that's all you see but you don't want to\n\ndead's happy like the way underclothes All so differ-\n\nently solemn and inti and sitting on one string\n\ndead never says my dear,Time for your musiclesson\n\nand you like music and to have somebody play who\n\ncan but you know you never can and why have to?\n\ndead's nice like a dance where you danced simple hours\n\nand you take all your prickley-clothes off and squeeze-\n\ninto-largeness without one word and you lie still as\n\nanything in largeness and this largeness begins to\n\ngive you,the dance all over again and you,feel all again\n\nall over the way men you liked made you feel when they\n\ntouched you(but that's not all)because largeness tells\n\nyou so you can feel what you made,men feel when,you\n\ntouched,them\n\ndead's sorry like a thistlefluff-thing which goes land-\n\ning away all by himself on somebody's roof or some-\n\nthing where who-ever-heard-of-growing and nobody\n\nexpects you to anyway\n\ndead says come with me he says(andwhyevernot)into\n\nthe round well and see the kitten and the penny and\n\nthe jackknife and the rosebug\n\nand you say Sure you\n\nsay (like that) sure i'll come with you you say for i\n\nlike kittens i do and jackknives i do and pennies i do\n\nand rosebugs i do\n\n********************\n\nmay i feel said he\n\nmay i feel
