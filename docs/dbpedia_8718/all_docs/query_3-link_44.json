        "text": "A friend who has spent some years in Pakistan, recalled visiting an exhibition on the occasion of Faiz Ahmed Faiz's 98th birthday, where, displayed, among other memorabilia, was a nine paisa ‘India Postage’ postcard, stamped 25 August, 1943, from the poet to his wife Alys. “I shall arrive in the morning and we shall leave the same evening. And don’t worry about the milk”.\n\nI love that last bit. It humanizes a poet who is too often an object of worship. Given his dominant presence in literary thought, and his stature, it is easy to forget at times, that Faiz, and his fellow poets and writers of the Progressive Writers’ Movement, cared deeply for the ordinary, the everyman, the unprivileged. The empathy in the writings of Munshi Prem Chand, Saadat Hasan Manto, Sahir Ludhianvi, Kaifi Azmi, Makhdoom Mohiuddin finds an echo in Faiz.\n\nIn his poem, 'Kutte,' he wrote, \"Jahaan bhar ki dhutkaar unki kamaai na aaraam shab ko na raahat savere ( All the world’s harsh words are their earnings without rest at night, sans relief in the day). Likewise, the lifelong quest for freedom - not just of nations - but of liberal thought and action that Ali Sardar Jafri, Sajjad Zaheer, Ismat Chugtai, A.K. Hangal, Amrita Pritam and Rajinder Singh Bedi and Attia Hosain espoused, was epitomised by the writings and personal involvement of Faiz in working to unshackle first India, then Pakistan, from feudal structures that dominate these twin societies even today.\n\nIt’s not surprising then, that his influence in this sphere continues. Haider, a recent Indian film, used Gulon Mein Rang Bhare, as a sort of code to unravel the deeper vicissitudes that everyday life in Kashmir entails. The almost unbearable beauty of the valley that is a counterpoint to the bottomless search for the Disappeared finds expression in this song.\n\nSuch verse, so full of the beauties of nature and tender emotions; almost a ‘Come into the garden Maud’ in its utter romanticism. But being Faiz, it does not stop there. There is always a darker shadow, of a poet whose angst over other concerns does not let him be. And so he wrote, \"Maqaam Faiz koi raah mein jacha hi nahijo kuye yaar se nikletoh su-e-daar chale\"(There was nothing to tempt one on the way from my beloved’s embrace to that of the gallows).\n\nIn the sensibilities that govern the subcontinent’s people, this duality of love and loss, laughter and sadness seems seamless. A kashish - a tug for the unattainable, is part of every poem.\n\nThose fraught days when my father in law lay dying in hospital, I began to re-read his favorite poets. We were told he was beyond hearing, but it comforted me to think that somehow, the cadences that he had spent his life around, would get through in some subliminal way.\n\nAs someone who had grown up in Lahore; indeed been to Government College, he continued to read and write in Urdu till the end. And this is probably true of many Indians, Punjabis in particular. Faiz to them, is a cherished icon. Perhaps because he put into forthright words, the emotions and thoughts they can not express. Or the ideals they do not find it easy to live by.\n\nTere hamare sawaal saare jawaab saare bahaar aayi toh khul gayen hain naye sire se hisaab saare (With the Spring have returned All the things we questioned That we sought answers to These have reopened on a new note) Lina Krishnan lives in Bengaluru and writes on culture, cinema and the environment."
