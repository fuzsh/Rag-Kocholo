        "text": "Cliff Robertson, who has died the day after his 88th birthday, was an actor who won an Oscar playing a mentally disabled janitor in Charly and worked in films ranging from PT 109 to Spider-Man.\n\nHis career spanned more than 60 years and included Hollywood movies, Broadway shows, television dramas and commercials. He also is remembered for his courage in exposing powerful Columbia studios chief David Begelman, who had forged his name on a $10,000 check in the late 1970s.\n\nBegelman’s misappropriation of studio money caused a scandal at the time that was dubbed Hollywoodgate and Robertson became a hero among some industry players by risking his career to expose Begelman. In fact, work dried up for several years before he made a comeback.\n\nThe Academy Award for best actor for the 1968 film Charly was awarded for his portrayal of a mentally disabled man who is transformed into a genius in an experiment, only to regress to his former self.\n\nRobertson’s work as a top dramatic actor of his generation earned him his greatest fame. He portrayed a young John F Kennedy in PT 109 and the elderly Ben Parker, uncle to the crime fighter Peter Parker, in the Spider-Man franchise. His work in television, which dated back to the 1950s, earned him that medium’s top prize, an Emmy.\n\nBorn Clifford Parker Robertson III in La Jolla, California, he first worked in community theatre in San Diego before joining the US merchant marine during the Second World War.\n\nLater he moved east to study acting and performed in theatres in upstate New York and New England, and, like many actors of his generation, set his sights on Broadway.\n\nHe worked on Broadway in shows such as The Wisteria Trees with Helen Hayes and took work in the early days of black-and-white television.\n\nSoon his career took him to Hollywood where he earned roles on shows such as The Twilight Zone.\n\nHe won an Emmy, US television’s top honour, for his work in The Game. He was also nominated for Emmys in Days of Wine and Roses and The Two Worlds of Charly Gordon, which eventually became the movie “Charly.”\n\nIn his private life, Robertson played tennis and was a keen pilot.\n\nHe was married twice, first to Cynthia Stone Lemmon, from whom he was divorced, and later to actress Dina Merrill from 1966 to 1989. He had two daughters, one from each marriage."
