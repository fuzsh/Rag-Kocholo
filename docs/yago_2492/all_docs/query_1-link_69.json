        "text": "Born in La Jolla, California the son of wealthy landowners, Cliff Robertson was adopted by his maternal grandmother at age 2 following the divorce of his parents. Independent and industrious from an early age he trapped lobsters for extra money and at age 13 scrubbed airplanes in exchange for flying lessons. As a young adult Robertson attended Antioch College as a journalism major but dropped out to take a couple of small, uncredited and un-inspiring film roles Corvette K-225 and We’ve Never Been Licked both 1943. Afterwards he served two and half years as a merchant marine.\n\nSeeking a career in theater, Robertson arrived in New York in 1947. He worked as an assistant to a private detective, parked cars at the Stork Club and performed with a Catskills troupe in order to pay tuition at the Actors Studio. In the mid 1950s he began to appear on television in live performances of classic and new plays prevalent in an era that was to become known as the golden age of television. This exposure led to a contract with Columbia Pictures in Hollywood.\n\nRobertson began his film career in earnest by appearing in Picnic 1956, a film adaptation of the notorious William Inge play directed by Joshua Logan, starring William Holden, Kim Novak and Rosalind Russell, that same year he appeared opposite Joan Crawford in Autumn Leaves directed by Robert Aldrich. In 1958 Robertson took a role in Norman Mailer’s World War 2 epic, The Naked and the Dead with Raymond Massey and Aldo Ray then capped the decade by playing the Big Kahuna (a legendary Malibu surfer) in Gidget 1959 opposite Sandra Dee and James Darren.\n\nIn 1961-62 Robertson appeared in 2 installments of the iconic television anthology series The Twilight Zone the first one being A Hundred Yards Over the Rim where he played a desperate character in 1847 who accidentally stumbles into a time portal and ends up in year 1961 while wandering the desert. The other was The Dummy where he played a seriously deranged ventriloquist. He played John F. Kennedy in PT 109 1963 then starred opposite Debbie Reynolds in My 6 Loves 1963. He appeared on Bob Hope Presents the Chrysler Theater in a televised play The Game for which he was awarded an Emmy in 1966 and later in the decade won an Oscar for his performance in Charly 1968 about a hopeless, mentally challenged individual who is transformed through the use of modern technology into a genius but then reverts back to his former self, with co-stars Claire Bloom and Dick Van Patten.\n\nCapitalizing on his Oscar win, Robertson took on the challenge of writing, directing and starring in J. W. Coop 1972, a western that examined the modern-day rodeo circuit with Geraldine Page playing Coop’s mother. The film was rated above average by the critics but its appeal was relegated to only a small segment of the movie-going public. In 3 Days of the Condor 1975, a film that examined the moral ambiguity of the U.S. Government following the Vietnam War and the Watergate scandal, Robertson played the Deputy-Director of the CIA. Condor became one of the most important films of the 70s and starred Robert Redford, Faye Dunaway and Max von Sydow.\n\nIn 1977 Robertson became embroiled in a Hollywood scandal when he discovered that a check for $10,000 had been forged with his name and cashed by then Columbia Pictures head David Begelman. Against advice from his agent and Hollywood friends, Robertson took the information to the FBI and Begelman was suspended with pay while the studio conducted its own investigation into the allegations. They discovered that Begelman had embezzled funds in excess of $65,000 and he was quietly fired. Begelman pleaded no contest to the charges and was fined $5000 and given 4 years probation. Never mind that when he was Judy Garland’s manager in the early 60s, he embezzled several hundred thousand dollars from her all of which he spent in Las Vegas casinos. He also was successful in blackmailing her with a photo of a partially nude Garland having her stomach pumped in an emergency room in London following a drug overdose. He asked for $50,000 to give the photo and all negatives to her. Garland paid rather than face adverse publicity. Begelman was discovered dead in a hotel room of a single gunshot wound, an apparent suicide in 1995.\n\nRobertson’s decision to speak freely with the press on Begelman resulted in him being blacklisted by the industry and he was unable to find work for several years although he appeared for a season in Falcon Crest, a popular television night-time soap in 1982-83. During this time he became the national spokesperson for AT&T. He accepted an invitation to speak to AT&T stockholders at their annual meeting but the workers went on strike and Robertson refused to cross the picket line in 1989. That same year he was on the jury of the 39th Berlin International Film Festival.\n\nHe experienced a mild resurgence in his career during the 90s in mediocre film fare such as Wild Hearts Can’t Be Broken 1991, Wind 1992, Renaissance Man 1994, and Escape From L.A. 1996. In the 21st century, Robertson played Peter Parker’s uncle Ben in Spider-Man 2002 and in sequels 2 and 3 in the years spanning 2002-07.\n\nRobertson carried a lifelong interest of flying and aircraft and owned several de Havilland Tiger Moths as well as a World War 2 era Supermarine Spitfire. He was a longtime member of the Experimental Aircraft Association and eventually co-founded the Young Eagles program which he chaired from 1992-94 succeeded by former test pilot Chuck Yeager. On September 11, 2001, Robertson was piloting his Beechcraft Baron 7,500 feet over New York City and was directly over the World Trade Center when the first plane hit becoming one of the rare eye-witnesses to watch the event unfold from a unique vantage point, at least until the FAA ordered him to land his plane. In 2008 Robertson was recognized by the National Transportation Safety Board Bar Association with the Ambassador of Goodwill Award for his leadership in and promotion of general aviation.\n\nHe married his first wife Cynthia Stone (Jack Lemmon’s ex) in 1957 and spawned a daughter, Stephanie, before divorcing in 1960. His second marriage was to Dina Merrill 1966-1989, the daughter of Marjorie Merriweather Post and Edward F. Hutton, an actress and fabulously wealthy New York socialite. They also spawned a daughter Heather, who died in 2007 from cancer.\n\nAfter earning an Oscar, an Emmy and numerous lifetime achievement awards from various film festivals over a career that spanned 60+ years, Cliff Robertson died in a hospital on Long Island from natural causes on September 10th one day after his 88th birthday."
