        "text": "Cliff Robertson was a ruggedly handsome actor who won an Oscar for Charly but found himself frozen out of jobs for almost four years after he exposed a prominent Hollywood studio boss as a forger and embezzler.\n\nRobertson, a frequent critic of the movie industry, blew the whistle on David Begelman, the president of Columbia Pictures, in 1977 after he discovered that Begelman had forged his name on a $10,000 studio cheque.\n\nBegelman pleaded no contest to charges of grand theft and was fined $5000 and sentenced to three years' probation. He was first suspended and then fired. His legal problems notwithstanding, he was hired to run Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer in 1980.\n\nRobertson, on the other hand, temporarily became a non-person in Hollywood - essentially blacklisted, he said, by forces within his own industry.\n\nRobertson eventually found his way back into Hollywood's good graces, probably because his talent was impossible to ignore. An actor who was often more compelling than the movies he made, he won the Academy Award in 1969 for his performance in one of the better ones, Charly, in which he played a loveable bakery worker with the IQ of a five-year-old whose intelligence is raised to genius level by an experiment, only to inexorably regress to what it had been.\n\nCharly was a hit. Robertson's directorial debut, J.W. Coop (1972), in which he played an ageing rodeo performer who regains his freedom after spending almost a decade in jail for writing a bad cheque and assaulting a sheriff, was not. But like Charly, it was a labour of love - Robertson also had a hand in writing the screenplay - and like Charly, it was widely praised.\n\nClifford Parker Robertson was born on September 9, 1923, in the La Jolla neighbourhood of San Diego. His parents were divorced when he was a year old, and his mother died when he was two. He was never close to his father and was raised by his maternal grandmother and an aunt. After serving in the merchant marine, he went to Antioch College in Ohio. He became interested in journalism there and worked briefly for a local newspaper and radio station, but the dean encouraged him to pursue acting.\n\nHis film debut came two years later, when Joshua Logan cast him in Picnic (1955). But in those years, Robertson was primarily a television actor.\n\nHis later movies included Wild Hearts Can't Be Broken (1991), Renaissance Man (released as Army Intelligence in Australia) in 1994 and Spider-Man (2002) and its sequels."
