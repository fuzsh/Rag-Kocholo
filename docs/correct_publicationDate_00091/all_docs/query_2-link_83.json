Here's the list:\n\nDestination: VOID\n\nThe Jesus Incident\n\nThe Lazarus Effect\n\nThe Ascension Factor\n\nI just finished reading this series for a second time recently. Like Dune, you need to read it more than once to soak it all in. This series is the antithesis of Dune in every way. For anyone interested in this series they might have some copies at your local used book store or amazon.com.\n\nbasically they are the same in the fact that humans can reach a higher state of consciousness, but that's a theme that runs through all of frank's books. other than that they are complete opposites: planet of sand/planet of water, humans all over the galaxy/mutant humans not even in the same universe as where they started. the list goes on.\n\nOf course, he didn't re-do over and other the same book. Else it would be quite boring to read him. But I'm sorry, having read both of them at least 10 times, the antithesis is only in the planet choice, not in the ideas under (and the water planet doesn't appear at all in the first book). In both case, the extreme condition of the planet occupied by the protagonists (and Dune throughout the serie is not the only planet and not all the time covered of sand) act more as a catalyst for for their \"ascension\" and/or downfall.\n\nblah, blah, blah. i was just trying to see how many people read frank's books other than dune. stop saying pointless crap, leto. i say pandora is completely different than dune. you can keep living in your fantasy where dune is the only thing frank wrote.\n\nNilentropy said:\n\nblah, blah, blah. i was just trying to see how many people read frank's books other than dune. stop saying pointless crap, leto. i say pandora is completely different than dune. you can keep living in your fantasy where dune is the only thing frank wrote.\n\nNice sabotage trick, but then why don't you ask frankly instead of opening a debate between two series equally good yet not so different ?"
