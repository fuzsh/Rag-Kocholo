        "text": "The Jesus Incident is the second science fiction novel set in the Destination: Void universe by the American author Frank Herbert and poet Bill Ransom. It is a sequel to Destination: Void, and has two sequels: The Lazarus Effect and The Ascension Factor. The book deals with concepts such as artificial intelligence, worship, resource allocation, and religious violence. Clones and genetic engineering take up themes of racism. One of the major themes is leadership and how the values of leaders influence society through the actions and narratives of a society's leaders. Another is the nature and definition of God. The novel also makes several references to Frankenstein, as an analogy to the relationship between Ship and humans. In The Jesus Incident, when Earthlings escaped an Earth’s whose sun was about to go nova, their goal was to create a living ship, artificial intelligence that would take them through the galaxy, and take care of them. They succeeded, and countless generations later, their ship became Ship, their god, complete with prayers, proper education, sacred areas, sacred rites, and honoured people who Ship speaks directly to. The ship takes care of the people, feeds them, clothes them, ensure the life support system and hydroponics gardens continue to function. And in return, it demands to be WorShipped… You can listen online to free English audiobook “The Jesus Incident” by Frank Herbert and Bill Ransom on our website."
