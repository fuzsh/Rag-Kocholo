        "text": "The Waste Land\n\n‘Nam Sibyllam quidem Cumis ego ipse oculis meis vidi in ampulla pendere, et cum illi pueri dicerent: Σίβυλλα τί θέλεις; respondebat illa: άποθανεîν θέλω.’\n\nFor Ezra Pound\n\nil miglior fabbro.\n\nI. The Burial of the Dead\n\nApril is the cruellest monthApril is the cruellest month The Waste Land begins with a subversion of the first lines of the General Prologue of The Canterbury Tales, by Geoffrey Chaucer. He paints April as a month of restorative power, when spring rain brings nature back to life: “Whan that Aprille with his shoures soote / The droghte of March hath perced to the roote, / And bathed every veyne in swich licóur / Of which vertú engendred is the flour;” it’s an image repeated to the point of cliché in subsequent centuries. But in the wasteland of Eliot’s modern world, amid the ruins of the World War I, the Chaucerian image of a fertile, resurrective April becomes suffused with cruelty. It is, ironically, winter that “kept us warm.”, breeding\n\nLilacs out of the dead land, mixing\n\nMemory and desire, stirring\n\nDull roots with spring rain.\n\nWinter kept us warm, covering\n\nEarth in forgetful snow, feeding\n\nA little life with dried tubers.\n\nSummer surprised us, coming over the Starnbergersee\n\nWith a shower of rain; we stopped in the colonnade,\n\nAnd went on in sunlight, into the Hofgarten,\n\nAnd drank coffee, and talked for an hour.\n\nBin gar keine Russin, stamm’ aus Litauen, echt deutsch.\n\nAnd when we were children, staying at the archduke’s,\n\nMy cousin’s, he took me out on a sled,\n\nAnd I was frightened. He said, Marie,\n\nMarieMarie Marie is Countess Marie Larisch, who played a pivotal role in the Mayerling Incident. The lines are taken from her book My Past and from Eliot’s conversations with her. Through biographical knowledge of the countess, readers can make connections to Crown Prince Rudolf and the scandal that allowed Archduke Franz Ferdinand to become the presumptive heir to the throne of Austria-Hungary and through Ferdinand to World War I (and, perhaps, also Prince Ferdinand from The Tempest)., hold on tight. And down we went.\n\nIn the mountains, there you feel free.\n\nI read, much of the night, and go south in the winter.\n\nWhat are the roots that clutch, what branches grow\n\nOut of this stony rubbish? Son of man,\n\nYou cannot say, or guess, for you know only\n\nA heap of broken imagesA heap of broken images Eliot’s endnotes for the poem connect the following line to Ecclesiastes 12:5: “Also when they shall be afraid of that which is high, and fears shall be in the way, and the almond tree shall flourish, and the grasshopper shall be a burden, and desire shall fail: because man goeth to his long home, and the mourners go about the streets.” But it also resembles Ezekiel 6:4: “And your images shall be broken.” Though the “heap of broken images” is one of many depictions of post-war decay in the poem, it can also be taken more generally as a metaphor for how present consciousness consumes past culture. Hugh Kenner, one of the great scholars of Modernism, explained this element well, arguing how the line evokes: “the manner in which Shakespeare, Homer, and the drawings of Michelangelo, Raphael, and the Magdalenian draughtsmen coexist in the contemporary cultivated consciousness: fragments, familiar quotations: poluphloisboio thalasse, to be or not to be, undo this button, one touch of nature, etc. […] Cities are built out of the ruins of previous cities, as The Waste Land is built out of the remains of older poems.”, where the sun beats,\n\nAnd the dead tree gives no shelter, the cricket no relief,\n\nAnd the dry stone no sound of water. Only\n\nThere is shadow under this red rock,\n\n(Come in under the shadow of this red rock),\n\nAnd I will show you something different from either\n\nYour shadow at morning striding behind you\n\nOr your shadow at evening rising to meet you;\n\nI will show you fear in a handful of dust.\n\nFrisch weht der Wind\n\nDer Heimat zu\n\nMein Irisch Kind,\n\nWo weilest du?\n\n‘You gave me hyacinths first a year ago;\n\n‘They called me the hyacinth girl.’\n\n—Yet when we came back, late, from the Hyacinth garden,\n\nYour arms full, and your hair wet, I could not\n\nSpeak, and my eyes failed, I was neither\n\nLiving nor dead, and I knew nothing,\n\nLooking into the heart of light, the silence.\n\nOed’ und leer das Meer.\n\nMadame SosostrisMadame Sosostris The name Madame Sosostris is reminiscent of Sesostris, the Sorceress of Ecbatana, from Aldous Huxley’s novel Crome Yellow, which was published in late 1921 while Eliot was working on The Waste Land. In Huxley’s novel, Sesostris, the Sorceress of Ecbatana is the moniker Mr. Scogan uses when he masquerades as a woman who tells fortunes at a fair. This cross-dressing gender play foreshadows the sexual ambiguity of the Tiresias figure, who appears later in the poem and whom some scholars take as its central consciousness. Madame Sosostris’s clairvoyance, even if she is merely a charlatan seer, further solidifies her connection to Tiresias and to the Cumaean Sibyl in the poem’s epigraph (taken from Petronius’s Satyricon)., famous clairvoyante,\n\nHad a bad cold, nevertheless\n\nIs known to be the wisest woman in Europe,\n\nWith a wicked pack of cardsa wicked pack of cards Eliot admitted in his endnotes that he was “not familiar with the exact constitution of the Tarot pack of cards,” but he used the symbolic register of the divinatory deck to spin a web of his own associations: James Frazer’s Hanged God from The Golden Bough, the Fisher King of the Grail quest (through Jessie Weston’s From Ritual to Romance), the Phoenician Sailor (a presence later in the poem), death by water, Shakespeare’s The Tempest, etc. Eliot later said, “I regret having sent so many enquirers off on a wild goose chase after Tarot cards and the Holy Grail.”. Here, said she,\n\nIs your card, the drowned Phoenician Sailor,\n\n(Those are pearls that were his eyesThose are pearls that were his eyes This line is pulled directly from Shakespeare’s The Tempest. In the context of the play, Ariel says this line in a song to Ferdinand, describing Ferdinand’s father’s supposed death by water. This line is repeated again in the second section of Eliot’s poem. Another line from this section of The Tempest, this one by Ferdinand, shows up in the third section of the poem: “This music crept by me upon the waters.”. Look!)\n\nHere is Belladonna, the Lady of the Rocks,\n\nThe lady of situations.\n\nHere is the man with three staves, and here the Wheel,\n\nAnd here is the one-eyed merchant, and this card,\n\nWhich is blank, is something he carries on his back,\n\nWhich I am forbidden to see. I do not find\n\nThe Hanged Man. Fear death by water.\n\nI see crowds of people, walking round in a ring.\n\nThank you. If you see dear Mrs. Equitone,\n\nTell her I bring the horoscope myself:\n\nOne must be so careful these days.\n\nUnreal CityUnreal City The “Unreal City” is borrowed from Baudelaire’s “The Seven Old Men”: “Unreal city, city full of dreams, / Where ghosts in broad daylight cling to passers-by.” Eliot’s “Unreal City” is modern London. The urban scene that makes up the final piece of the first section of The Waste Land is set in the city’s financial district where Eliot worked at Lloyds Bank. Eliot’s London, Baudelaire’s Paris, and Dante’s Inferno merge into a hellish tableau. The phrase “Unreal City” returns in the third section of the poem.,\n\nUnder the brown fog of a winter dawn,\n\nA crowd flowed over London Bridge, so many,\n\nI had not thought death had undone so many.\n\nSighs, short and infrequent, were exhaled,\n\nAnd each man fixed his eyes before his feet.\n\nFlowed up the hill and down King William Street,\n\nTo where Saint Mary Woolnoth kept the hours\n\nWith a dead sound on the final stroke of nine.\n\nThere I saw one I knew, and stopped him, crying: 'Stetson!\n\n‘You who were with me in the ships at Mylae!\n\n‘That corpse you planted last year in your garden,\n\n‘Has it begun to sprout? Will it bloom this year?\n\n‘Or has the sudden frost disturbed its bed?\n\n‘Oh keep the Dog far hence, that’s friend to men,\n\n‘Or with his nails he’ll dig it up again!\n\n‘You! hypocrite lecteur!—mon semblable,—mon frère!”\n\nII. A Game of Chess\n\nThe Chair she sat in, like a burnished throne,\n\nGlowed on the marble, where the glass\n\nHeld up by standards wrought with fruited vines\n\nFrom which a golden Cupidon peeped out\n\n(Another hid his eyes behind his wing)\n\nDoubled the flames of sevenbranched candelabra\n\nReflecting light upon the table as\n\nThe glitter of her jewels rose to meet it,\n\nFrom satin cases poured in rich profusion;\n\nIn vials of ivory and coloured glass\n\nUnstoppered, lurked her strange synthetic perfumes,\n\nUnguent, powdered, or liquid—troubled, confused\n\nAnd drowned the sense in odours; stirred by the air\n\nThat freshened from the window, these ascended\n\nIn fattening the prolonged candle-flames,\n\nFlung their smoke into the laquearia,\n\nStirring the pattern on the coffered ceiling.\n\nHuge sea-wood fed with copper\n\nBurned green and orange, framed by the coloured stone,\n\nIn which sad light a carvéd dolphin swam.\n\nAbove the antique mantel was displayed\n\nAs though a window gave upon the sylvan scene\n\nThe change of Philomel, by the barbarous king\n\nSo rudely forced; yet there the nightingale\n\nFilled all the desert with inviolable voice\n\nAnd still she cried, and still the world pursues,\n\n‘Jug Jug’ to dirty ears.\n\nAnd other withered stumps of time\n\nWere told upon the walls; staring forms\n\nLeaned out, leaning, hushing the room enclosed.\n\nFootsteps shuffled on the stair.\n\nUnder the firelight, under the brush, her hair\n\nSpread out in fiery points\n\nGlowed into words, then would be savagely still.\n\n‘My nerves are bad tonight. Yes, bad. Stay with me.\n\nSpeak to me. Why do you never speak. Speak.\n\nWhat are you thinking of? What thinking? What?\n\nI never know what you are thinking. Think.’\n\nI think we are in rats’ alley\n\nWhere the dead men lost their bones.\n\n‘What is that noise?’\n\nThe wind under the door.\n\n‘What is that noise now? What is the wind doing?’\n\nNothing again nothing.\n\n‘Do\n\n‘You know nothing? Do you see nothing? Do you remember\n\n‘Nothing?’\n\nI remember\n\nThose are pearls that were his eyes.\n\n‘Are you alive, or not? Is there nothing in your head?’\n\nBut\n\nO O O O that Shakespeherian RagO O O O that Shakespeherian Rag The song “That Shakespearean Rag” with lyrics by Gene Buck and Herman Ruby and music by Dave Stamper was a minor hit in 1912. The cultural degeneration from Shakespeare to popular music is emblematic of the decline and debasement seen throughout The Waste Land. Eliot has interestingly affixed an “O O O O” to the beginning of the song, which is reminiscent of the final lines of Hamlet: “The rest is silence. / O, o, o, o.”—\n\nIt’s so elegant\n\nSo intelligent\n\n‘What shall I do now? What shall I do?’\n\n‘I shall rush out as I am, and walk the street\n\n‘With my hair down, so. What shall we do tomorrow?\n\n‘What shall we ever do?’\n\nThe hot water at ten.\n\nAnd if it rains, a closed car at four.\n\nAnd we shall play a game of chess,\n\nPressing lidless eyes and waiting for a knock upon the door.\n\nWhen Lil’s husband got demobbed, I said—\n\nI didn’t mince my words, I said to her myself,\n\nHURRY UP PLEASE ITS TIME\n\nNow Albert’s coming back, make yourself a bit smart.\n\nHe’ll want to know what you done with that money he gave you\n\nTo get yourself some teeth. He did, I was there.\n\nYou have them all out, Lil, and get a nice set,\n\nHe said, I swear, I can’t bear to look at you.\n\nAnd no more can’t I, I said, and think of poor Albert,\n\nHe’s been in the army four years, he wants a good time,\n\nAnd if you don’t give it him, there’s others will, I said.\n\nOh is there, she said. Something o’ that, I said.\n\nThen I’ll know who to thank, she said, and give me a straight look.\n\nHURRY UP PLEASE ITS TIME\n\nIf you don’t like it you can get on with it, I said.\n\nOthers can pick and choose if you can’t.\n\nBut if Albert makes off, it won’t be for lack of telling.\n\nYou ought to be ashamed, I said, to look so antique.\n\n(And her only thirty-one.)\n\nI can’t help it, she said, pulling a long face,\n\nIt’s them pills I took, to bring it off, she said.\n\n(She’s had five already, and nearly died of young George.)\n\nThe chemist said it would be all right, but I’ve never been the same.\n\nYou are a proper fool, I said.\n\nWell, if Albert won’t leave you alone, there it is, I said,\n\nWhat you get married for if you don’t want children?\n\nHURRY UP PLEASE ITS TIME\n\nWell, that Sunday Albert was home, they had a hot gammon,\n\nAnd they asked me in to dinner, to get the beauty of it hot—\n\nHURRY UP PLEASE ITS TIME\n\nHURRY UP PLEASE ITS TIME\n\nGoonight Bill. Goonight Lou. Goonight May. Goonight.\n\nTa ta. Goonight. Goonight.\n\nGood night, ladies, good night, sweet ladies, good night, good nightGood night, ladies, good night, sweet ladies, good night, good night The final words of this section of the poem come from Hamlet, spoken by Ophelia: “And so I thank you for your good counsel. Come, my coach! Good night, ladies; good night, sweet ladies; good night, good night.” Ophelia is yet another character whose death comes through water, and there is also a connection to the poem’s “hyacinth girl” through their mutual association with flowers. Hugh Kenner, in fact, described the hyacinth girl as speaking “with urgent hurt simplicity, like the mad Ophelia.”.\n\nIII. The Fire Sermon\n\nThe river’s tent is broken: the last fingers of leaf\n\nClutch and sink into the wet bank. The wind\n\nCrosses the brown land, unheard. The nymphs are departed.\n\nSweet Thames, run softly, till I end my song.\n\nThe river bears no empty bottles, sandwich papers,\n\nSilk handkerchiefs, cardboard boxes, cigarette ends\n\nOr other testimony of summer nights. The nymphs are departed.\n\nAnd their friends, the loitering heirs of City directors;\n\nDeparted, have left no addresses.\n\nBy the waters of Leman I sat down and wept . . .\n\nSweet Thames, run softly till I end my song,\n\nSweet Thames, run softly, for I speak not loud or long.\n\nBut at my back in a cold blast I hear\n\nThe rattle of the bones, and chuckle spread from ear to ear.\n\nA rat crept softly through the vegetation\n\nDragging its slimy belly on the bank\n\nWhile I was fishing in the dull canal\n\nOn a winter evening round behind the gashouse\n\nMusing upon the king my brother’s wreck\n\nAnd on the king my father’s death before him.\n\nWhite bodies naked on the low damp ground\n\nAnd bones cast in a little low dry garret,\n\nRattled by the rat’s foot only, year to year.\n\nBut at my back from time to time I hear\n\nThe sound of horns and motors, which shall bring\n\nSweeney to Mrs. Porter in the spring.\n\nO the moon shone bright on Mrs. Porter\n\nAnd on her daughter\n\nThey wash their feet in soda water\n\nEt O ces voix d’enfants, chantant dans la coupole!\n\nTwit twit twit\n\nJug jug jug jug jug jug\n\nSo rudely forc’d.\n\nTereu\n\nUnreal City\n\nUnder the brown fog of a winter noon\n\nMr. Eugenides, the Smyrna merchant\n\nUnshaven, with a pocket full of currants\n\nC.i.f. London: documents at sight,\n\nAsked me in demotic French\n\nTo luncheon at the Cannon Street Hotel\n\nFollowed by a weekend at the Metropole.\n\nAt the violet hour, when the eyes and back\n\nTurn upward from the desk, when the human engine waits\n\nLike a taxi throbbing waiting,\n\nI TiresiasTiresias In Greek mythology, Tiresias is a blind seer from Thebes. In addition to his gift of prophecy, he is known for his sexual transformation from man to woman (as a punishment from Hera, the queen of the Greek gods). In his endnotes, Eliot explained, “Tiresias, although a mere spectator and not indeed a ‘character,’ is yet the most important personage in the poem, uniting all the rest. Just as the one-eyed merchant, seller of currants, melts into the Phoenician Sailor, and the latter is not wholly distinct from Ferdinand Prince of Naples, so all the women are one woman, and the two sexes meet in Tiresias. What Tiresias sees, in fact, is the substance of the poem.” The interpretational mileage one gets from shoehorning everything in the poem into a single consciousness, whether it is that of Tiresias or not, varies from critic to critic, but it would be difficult to understand The Waste Land without wrestling with this question: “What does Tiresias see?” Thinking through some of the essential narratives that include Tiresias (especially Homer’s Odyssey, Ovid’s Metamorphoses, and Sophocles’s Oedipus Rex) can offer connections to many of the major motifs of The Waste Land, including blindness, gender ambiguity, withheld knowledge, cryptic prophecy, dangerous sexual power, stagnant relationships, plagued land, and death by water., though blind, throbbing between two lives,\n\nOld man with wrinkled female breasts, can see\n\nAt the violet hour, the evening hour that strives\n\nHomeward, and brings the sailor home from sea,\n\nThe typist home at teatime, clears her breakfast, lights\n\nHer stove, and lays out food in tins.\n\nOut of the window perilously spread\n\nHer drying combinations touched by the sun’s last rays,\n\nOn the divan are piled (at night her bed)\n\nStockings, slippers, camisoles, and stays.\n\nI Tiresias, old man with wrinkled dugs\n\nPerceived the scene, and foretold the rest—\n\nI too awaited the expected guest.\n\nHe, the young man carbuncular, arrives,\n\nA small house agent’s clerk, with one bold stare,\n\nOne of the low on whom assurance sits\n\nAs a silk hat on a Bradford millionaire.\n\nThe time is now propitious, as he guesses,\n\nThe meal is ended, she is bored and tired,\n\nEndeavours to engage her in caresses\n\nWhich still are unreproved, if undesired.\n\nFlushed and decided, he assaults at once;\n\nExploring hands encounter no defence;\n\nHis vanity requires no response,\n\nAnd makes a welcome of indifference.\n\n(And I Tiresias have foresuffered all\n\nEnacted on this same divan or bed;\n\nI who have sat by Thebes below the wall\n\nAnd walked among the lowest of the dead.)\n\nBestows one final patronising kiss,\n\nAnd gropes his way, finding the stairs unlit . . .\n\nShe turns and looks a moment in the glass,\n\nHardly aware of her departed lover;\n\nHer brain allows one half-formed thought to pass:\n\n'Well now that’s done: and I’m glad it’s over.’\n\nWhen lovely woman stoops to folly and\n\nPaces about her room again, alone,\n\nShe smooths her hair with automatic hand,\n\nAnd puts a record on the gramophone.\n\n‘This music crept by me upon the waters’\n\nAnd along the Strand, up Queen Victoria Street.\n\nO City city, I can sometimes hear\n\nBeside a public bar in Lower Thames Street,\n\nThe pleasant whining of a mandoline\n\nAnd a clatter and a chatter from within\n\nWhere fishmen lounge at noon: where the walls\n\nOf Magnus Martyr hold\n\nInexplicable splendour of Ionian white and gold.\n\nThe river sweats\n\nOil and tar\n\nThe barges drift\n\nWith the turning tide\n\nRed sails\n\nWide\n\nTo leeward, swing on the heavy spar.\n\nThe barges wash\n\nDrifting logs\n\nDown Greenwich reach\n\nPast the Isle of Dogs.\n\nWeialala leia\n\nWallala leialala\n\nElizabeth and Leicester\n\nBeating oars\n\nThe stern was formed\n\nA gilded shell\n\nRed and gold\n\nThe brisk swell\n\nRippled both shores\n\nSouthwest wind\n\nCarried down stream\n\nThe peal of bells\n\nWhite towers\n\nWeialala leia\n\nWallala leialala\n\n‘Trams and dusty trees.\n\nHighbury bore me.

One laments, “I can connect / Nothing with nothing.” Could this be a response to E.M. Forster, who had written in his novel Howard’s End a decade prior “Only connect”? If so, is it a negation of Forster’s famous injunction or an extension of it? Eliot’s line can mean “I can’t connect anything” or “I can’t connect anything with the nothingness” or “I can connect the nothingness with the nothingness,” all of which yield different interpretations to the closing lines of this section. The fact that this happens “On Margate Sands,” one place Eliot physically stayed during the writing of the poem, connects the maiden’s voice with Eliot’s personal voice as well.\n\nNothing with nothing.\n\nThe broken fingernails of dirty hands.\n\nMy people humble people who expect\n\nNothing.’\n\nla la\n\nTo Carthage then I came\n\nBurning burning burning burning\n\nO Lord Thou pluckest me out\n\nO Lord Thou pluckest\n\nburning\n\nIV. Death by Water\n\nPhlebas the PhoenicianPhlebas the Phoenician Ezra Pound, a mentor of Eliot’s, helped him edit the poem. Pound cut so much that he joked about performing the “Caesarean Operation” for the poem’s birth. The section that Pound cut most deeply was this fourth section, which became the shortest section. After his friend’s edits, Eliot questioned whether he should keep Phlebas the Phoenician at all, but Pound was adamant he remain. Phlebas is connected not only to the tarot cards of Madame Sosostris but also to Ferdinand from The Tempest and the Smyrna merchant Mr. Eugenides. , a fortnight dead,\n\nForgot the cry of gulls, and the deep sea swell\n\nAnd the profit and loss.\n\nA current under sea\n\nPicked his bones in whispers.

In his endnotes, Eliot pointed to Ernest Shackleton’s account of one of his Antarctic expeditions, in which the explorers maintained the delusion that there was an extra member present. It also clearly conjures up a biblical story from Luke 24 of travelers on the road to Emmaus, in which two disciples encounter a third presence on their journey, who is revealed to be a post-resurrection Jesus.\n\nWhen I count, there are only you and I together\n\nBut when I look ahead up the white road\n\nThere is always another one walking beside you\n\nGliding wrapt in a brown mantle, hooded\n\nI do not know whether a man or a woman\n\n—But who is that on the other side of you?\n\nWhat is that sound high in the air\n\nMurmur of maternal lamentation\n\nWho are those hooded hordes swarming\n\nOver endless plains, stumbling in cracked earth\n\nRinged by the flat horizon only\n\nWhat is the city over the mountains\n\nCracks and reforms and bursts in the violet air\n\nFalling towers\n\nJerusalem Athens Alexandria\n\nVienna London\n\nUnreal\n\nA woman drew her long black hair out tight\n\nAnd fiddled whisper music on those strings\n\nAnd bats with baby faces in the violet light\n\nWhistled, and beat their wings\n\nAnd crawled head downward down a blackened wall\n\nAnd upside down in air were towers\n\nTolling reminiscent bells, that kept the hours\n\nAnd voices singing out of empty cisterns and exhausted wells.\n\nIn this decayed hole among the mountains\n\nIn the faint moonlight, the grass is singing\n\nOver the tumbled graves, about the chapel\n\nThere is the empty chapel, only the wind’s home.\n\nIt has no windows, and the door swings,\n\nDry bones can harm no one.\n\nOnly a cock stood on the rooftree\n\nCo co rico co co rico\n\nIn a flash of lightning. Then a damp gust\n\nBringing rain\n\nGanga was sunken, and the limp leaves\n\nWaited for rain, while the black clouds\n\nGathered far distant, over Himavant.\n\nThe jungle crouched, humped in silence.\n\nThen spoke the thunder\n\nDADA In the Upanishads, a collection of Hindu scriptures, “DA” is the voice of thunder. As Hugh Kenner explained it, “If the race’s most permanent wisdom is its oldest, then DA, the voice of the thunder and of the Hindu sages, is the cosmic voice not yet dissociated into echoes.” It is the root of “Datta” (“Give”), “Dayadhvam” (“Sympathize”), and “Damyata” (“Control”), each of which appears in this final section of the poem. Interestingly, Eliot reshuffled their order from the original “Damyata, Datta, Dayadhvam.”\n\nDatta: what have we given?\n\nMy friend, blood shaking my heart\n\nThe awful daring of a moment’s surrender\n\nWhich an age of prudence can never retract\n\nBy this, and this only, we have existed\n\nWhich is not to be found in our obituaries\n\nOr in memories draped by the beneficent spider\n\nOr under seals broken by the lean solicitor\n\nIn our empty rooms\n\nDA\n\nDayadhvam: I have heard the key\n\nTurn in the door once and turn once only\n\nWe think of the key, each in his prison\n\nThinking of the key, each confirms a prison\n\nOnly at nightfall, aethereal rumours\n\nRevive for a moment a broken Coriolanus\n\nDA\n\nDamyata: The boat responded\n\nGaily, to the hand expert with sail and oar\n\nThe sea was calm, your heart would have responded\n\nGaily, when invited, beating obedient\n\nTo controlling hands\n\nI sat upon the shore\n\nFishing, with the arid plain behind me\n\nShall I at least set my lands in order?\n\nLondon Bridge is falling down falling down falling down\n\nPoi s’ascose nel foco che gli affina\n\nQuando fiam uti chelidon—O swallow swallow\n\nLe Prince d’Aquitaine à la tour abolie\n\nThese fragmentsThese fragmentsThe fragments that immediately precede this phrase are in various languages and were taken from a traditional English nursery rhyme, Dante’s Purgatorio, the Pervigilium Veneris (of unknown authorship), and Gerard de Nerval’s sonnet “El Desdichado,” respectively. Fragmentation is not only a feature of the setting, plot, and theme of The Waste Land but also, crucially, its defining formal feature. As with the line “A heap of broken images,” this has become one of the more memorable detachable statements of self-reflective description in the poem. But it is emblematic not just of this poem but also of Modernism more generally. It also ties in nicely with Eliot’s description of “the mythical method” in his review of James Joyce’s Ulysses in The Dial. For Eliot, Joyce’s use of Homeric parallels had “the importance of a scientific discovery.” I have shored against my ruins\n\nWhy then Ile fit you. Hieronymo’s mad againe.Hieronimo is Mad Againe is the alternate title of Thomas Kyd’s The Spanish Tragedy (which Eliot noted was one source for Hamlet in his essay on Shakespeare’s play). The words “Why then Ile fit you” appear in Kyd’s play when Hieronimo says them to one of the murderers of his son when he is asked by the killer to write a play for the king’s entertainment. With that line, Hieronimo means both “I’ll oblige your wishes” and “I’ll give you what you have coming.” He uses the play as a means for revenge; wielding a real dagger as a prop, he murders the men on stage.\n\nDatta. Dayadhvam. Damyata.\n\nShantih shantih shantihShantih shantih shantih Shantih is a Sanskrit word for peace that is prayed at the close of an Upanishad. Eliot wrote in his endnotes that “The peace which passeth understanding” is “a feeble translation of the content of the word.” The beyond-language-ness of this final prayer again returns us to those final lines of Hamlet: “The rest is silence. / O, o, o, o.”\n\nT.
