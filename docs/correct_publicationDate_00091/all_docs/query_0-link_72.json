As demanding and spectacular as the vision it serves.  The Jesus Incident is as much a voyage as a novel: a breakthrough work of speculative fiction that leaps to the end of evolution, to the surface of a poisoned planet as profoundly realized as Dune's Arrakis... to witness mankind and his creations trading places in a ceremony that illuminates the shimmering connections between free will and destiny that will determine the ultimate course of our future.</p>",
