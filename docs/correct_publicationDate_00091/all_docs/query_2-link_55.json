This image was captured in the early morning light of my home and I was glad to feature books that mean alot to me.  In the near center of this frame, the book \"The Jesus Incident\" is my very favorite of all Frank Herbert work.  Although most people will remember only that he was the author of the Dune series, it is this particular book that I return to over and over.\n\t\n\tAt some time, I hope to pass on these books to my sons.  I've started to collect duplicates of Herbert's work so I can make sure Cameron and John each have a chance to read them.  For those who enjoy science fiction, this work is the best combination of hard science and masterful storytelling.",
