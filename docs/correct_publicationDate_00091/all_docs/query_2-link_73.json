        "text": "\"The Dragon in the Sea\" is excellent. the very first publishing in the US was under that name, and then it was forever printed as \"Under Pressure\" after that. this isn't so much a scifi novel, as it is an military espianoge thriller. but it's a ton of fun, easy read.\n\n\"The Green Brain\" is really good as well. Nowhere near as futuristic as his Dune novels, or the Jesus Incident series. but still, very good, and with a nice squelchy kick at the end. i have a book review of that too, but it think it got archived on the site i review for. . . i'll have to put it up on amazon sometime.\n\nI've got a copy of \"Eye\", that book of short stories, and for the most part, i enjoyed it. in fact, i should read it again one of these days.\n\nhe also wrote, with Brian, \"Man of Two Worlds\", and just finding copies of this book is an adventure (god i LOVE used book stores!). \"Man of Two Worlds\" is a pretty simple adventure, and it's obvious which parts were written by who. i wrote a spiffy book review, here:\n\nhttp://wormsscifi.com/haven/viewtopic.php?t=1348\n\nI've got copies of Dosadi, Jesus Incident, and Whipping Star, but i just couldn't get into them.\n\nDune may be epic, but Herbert's other stuff is good too.\n\nI thought The Dosadi Experiment and Whipping Star were creative and had some aliens that came across as more than humans in funny costumes. The Dosadi Experiment also had more awareness of the implications of natural selection than did most of the science fiction written in its time. It discusses ideas that were highly politically incorrect from the late sixties through the mid nineties. Things have loosened up somewhat since then, but researchers still need to choose their words carefully.\n\nI also read The White Plague, but I remember not liking it. I can't, however, remember enough about it to say why I didn't like it.\n\nIt is a shame that Herbert's work other than the Dune series is in danger of being forgotten. I actually liked The Dosadi Experiment better than Dune's sequels."
