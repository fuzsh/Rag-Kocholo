Putnam's Sons, 1979.\n\nFirst edition of the second novel set in the Destination: Void universe by Frank Herbert and poet Bill Ransom. Octavo, original cloth. Boldly signed on the title page, “Frank Herbert 5/10/85.” Review copy, with the original press photograph and release laid in, near fine in a near fine dust jacket. Jacket illustration by Paul Alexander. Uncommon signed.\n\nThe book takes place at an indeterminate time following the events in Destination: Void. At the end of Destination: Void the crew of the ship had succeeded in creating an artificial consciousness. The new conscious being, now known as 'Ship', gains a level of awareness that allows it to manipulate space and time. Ship instantly transports itself to a planet which it has decided the crew will colonize, christening it \"Pandora\". The first book ends with a demand from Ship for the crew to learn how to WorShip or how to establish a relationship with Ship, a godlike being."
