        "text": "MAPLE GROVE, Minn. (Gray News) - A Minnesota woman said she is in shock after she was dropped by her insurance company all because of her car’s make and model.\n\nErin Walters said she was a State Farm customer for five years, but the insurance company recently refused to renew her policy citing “high theft rates.”\n\nWalters said that when she bought her 2019 Hyundai Elantra, it was the first time in 30 years that she was able to buy a new car.\n\n“I love it,” she said.\n\nWalters said the car gave her a sense of freedom, but her feelings changed a week ago when she tried to renew her car insurance.\n\n“I was shocked that State Farm was denying me,” she said.\n\nWalters said it is because of the make and model of her car.\n\n“I would never buy a Hyundai because they are not stepping up to fixing this situation,” she said.\n\nA spokesperson for State Farm said, “State Farm has stopped accepting new customer applications in some states for certain model years and trim levels of Hyundai and Kia vehicles because theft losses for these vehicles have increased dramatically. ... This is a serious problem impacting our customers and the entire auto insurance industry.”\n\n“I’ve never cried over a car before,” she said.\n\nFor days, Walters had been looking for other options, only to be let down again.\n\nWalters said Progressive also denied her.\n\nIn the last week, 40% of stolen cars were Kias and Hyundais, but Minneapolis police said they are seeing a decrease.\n\nWalters said she wishes that she would have never bought the car.\n\nIn response to the increasing thefts targeting Hyundai vehicles, the company introduced a free anti-theft software update for nearly 4 million vehicles"
