You can carry ideas through the gate … but you must carry the ideas in symbols.\n\n—Raja Flattery, Chaplain/Psychiatrist\n\nSomething went Tick.\n\nHe heard it quite distinctly—a metallic sound. There it went again: Tick.\n\nHe opened his eyes and was rewarded with darkness, an absolute lack of radiant energy … or of receptors to detect energy.\n\nAm I blind?\n\nTick.\n\nHe could not place the source, but it was out there—wherever out there was. The air felt cold in his throat and lungs. But his body was warm. He realized that he lay very lightly on a soft surface. He was breathing. Something tickled his nose, a faint odor of … pepper?\n\nTick.\n\nHe cleared his throat. Anybody there?\n\nNo answer. Speaking hurt his throat.\n\nWhat am I doing here?\n\nThe soft surface beneath him curved up around his shoulders to support his neck and head. It encased hips and legs. This was familiar. It ignited distant associations. It was … what? He felt that he should know about such a surface.\n\nAfter all, I …\n\nTick.\n\nPanic seized him. Who am I?\n\nThe answer came slowly, thawed from a block of ice which contained everything he should know.\n\nI am Raja Flattery.\n\nIce melted in a cascade of memories.\n\nI’m Chaplain/Psychiatrist on the Voidship Earthling. We … we …\n\nSome of the memories remained frozen.\n\nHe tried to sit up but; was restrained by softly cupping bands over his chest and wrists. Now, he felt connectors withdraw from the veins at his wrists.\n\nI’m in a hyb tank!\n\nHe had no memory of going into hybernation. Perhaps memory thawed more slowly than flesh. Interesting. But there were a few memories now, frigid in their flow, and deeply disturbing.\n\nI failed.\n\nMoonbase directed me to blow up our ship rather than let it roam space as a threat to humankind. I was to send the message capsule back to Moonbase … and blow up our ship.\n\nSomething had prevented him from … something …\n\nBut he remembered the project now.\n\nProject Consciousness.\n\nAnd he, Raja Flattery, had held a key role in that project. Chaplain/Psychiatrist. He had been one of the crew.\n\nUmbilicus crew.\n\nHe did not dwell on the birth symbology in that label. Clones had more important tasks. They were clones on the crew, all with Lon for a middle name. Lon meant clone as Mac meant son of. All the crew—clones. They were doppelgangers sent far into insulating space, there to solve the problem of creating an artificial consciousness.\n\nDangerous work. Very dangerous. Artificial consciousness had a long history of turning against its creators. It went rogue with ferocious violence. Even many of the uncloned had perished in agony.\n\nNobody could say why.\n\nBut the project’s directors at Moonbase were persistent. Again and again, they sent the same cloned crew into space. Features flashed into Flattery’s mind as he thought the names: a Gerrill Timberlake, a John Bickel, a Prue Weygand …\n\nRaja Flattery … Raja Lon Flattery.\n\nHe glimpsed his own face in a long-gone mirror: fair hair, narrow features … disdainful …\n\nAnd the Voidships carried others, many others. They carried cloned Colonists, gene banks in hyb tanks. Cheap flesh to be sacrificed in distant explosions where the uncloned would not be harmed. Cheap flesh to gather data for the uncloned. Each new venture into the void went out with a bit more information for the wakeful umbilicus crew and those encased in hyb …\n\nAs I am encased now.\n\nColonists, livestock, plants—each Voidship carried what it needed to create another Earth. That was the carrot luring them onward. And the ship—certain death if they failed to create an artificial consciousness. Moonbase knew that ships and clones were cheap where materials and inexpensive energy were abundant … as they were on the moon.\n\nTick.\n\nWho is bringing me out of hybernation?\n\nAnd why?\n\nFlattery thought about that while he tried to extend his globe of awareness into the unresponsive darkness.\n\nWho? Why?\n\nHe knew that he had failed to blow up his ship after it had exhibited consciousness … using Bickel as an imprint on the computer they had built.…\n\nI did not blow up the ship. Something prevented me from …\n\nShip!\n\nMore memories flooded into his mind. They had achieved the artificial consciousness to direct their ship … and it had whisked them far across space to the Tau Ceti system.\n\nWhere there were no inhabitable planets.\n\nMoonbase probes had made certain of that much earlier. No inhabitable planets. It was part of the frustration built into the project. No Voidship could be allowed to choose the long way to Tau Ceti sanctuary. Moonbase could not allow that. It would be too tempting for the cloned crew—breed our own replacements, let our descendants find Tau Ceti. And to hell with Project Consciousness! If they voted that course, the Chaplain/Psychiatrist was charged to expose the empty goal and stand ready with the destruct button.\n\nWin, lose or draw—we were supposed to die.\n\nAnd only the Chaplain/Psychiatrist had been allowed to suspect this. The serial Voidships and their cloned cargo had one mission: gather information and send it back to Moonbase.\n\nShip.\n\nThat was it, of course. They had created much more than consciousness in their computer and its companion system which Bickel had called the Ox. They had made Ship. And Ship had whisked them across space in an impossible eyeblink.\n\nDestination Tau Ceti.\n\nThat was, after all, the built-in command, the target programmed into their computer. But where there had been no inhabitable planet, Ship had created one: a paradise planet, an earth idealized out of every human dream. Ship had done this thing, but then had come Ship’s terrible demand: You must decide how you will WorShip Me!\n\nShip had assumed attributes of God or Satan. Flattery was never sure which. But he had sensed that awesome power even before the repeated demand.\n\nHow will you WorShip? You must decide!\n\nFailure.\n\nThey never could satisfy Ship’s demand. But they could fear. They learned a full measure of fear.\n\nTick.\n\nHe recognized that sound now: the dehyb timer/monitor counting off the restoration of life to his flesh.\n\nBut who had set this process into motion?\n\nWho’s there?\n\nSilence and the impenetrable darkness answered.\n\nFlattery felt alone and now there was a painful chill around his flesh, a signal that skin sensation was returning to normal.\n\nOne of the crew had warned them before they had thrown the switch to ignite the artificial consciousness. Flattery could not recall who had voiced the warning but he remembered it.\n\nThere must be a threshold of consciousness beyond which a conscious being takes on attributes of God.\n\nWhoever said it had seen a truth.\n\nWho is bringing me out of hyb and why?\n\nSomebody’s there! Who is it?\n\nSpeaking still hurt his throat and his mind was not working properly—that icy core of untouchable memories.\n\nCome on! Who’s there?\n\nHe knew somebody was there. He could feel the familiar presence of …\n\nShip!\n\nOkay, Ship. I’m awake.\n\nSo you assume.\n\nThat chiding voice could never sound human. It was too impossibly controlled. Every slightest nuance, every inflection, every modulated resonance conveyed a perfection which put it beyond the reach of humans. But that voice told him that he once more was a pawn of Ship. He was a small cog in the workings of this Infinite Power which he had helped to release upon an unsuspecting universe. This realization filled him with remembered terrors and an immediate awesome fear of the agonies which Ship might visit upon him for his failures. He was tormented by visions of Hell …\n\nI failed … I failed … I failed …\n\nChapter 2\n\nSt Augustine asked the right question: Does freedom come from chance or choice? And you must remember that quantum mechanics guarantees chance.\n\n—Raja Flattery, The Book of Ship\n\nUsually Morgan Oakes took out his nightside angers and frustrations in long strides down any corridor of the ship where his feet led him.\n\nNot this time! he told himself.\n\nHe sat in shadows and sipped a glass of astringent wine. Bitter, but it washed the taste of the ship’s foul joke from his tongue. The wine had come at his demand, a demonstration of his power in these times of food shortages. The first bottle from the first batch. How would they take it groundside when he ordered the wine improved?\n\nOakes raised the glass in an ancient gesture: Confusion to You, Ship!\n\nThe wine was too raw. He put it aside.\n\nOakes knew the figure he cut, sitting here trembling in his cubby while he stared at the silent com-console beside his favorite couch. He increased the light slightly.\n\nOnce more the ship had convinced him that its program was running down. The ship was getting senile. He was the Chaplain/Psychiatrist and the ship tried to poison him! Others were fed from shiptits—not frequently and not much, but it happened. Even he had been favored once, before he became Ceepee, and he still remembered the taste—richly satisfying. It was a little like the stuff called burst which Lewis had developed groundside. An attempt to duplicate elixir. Costly stuff, burst. Wasteful. And not elixir—no, not elixir.\n\nHe stared at the curved screen of the console beside him. It returned a dwarfed reflection of himself: an overweight, heavy-shouldered man in a one-piece suit of shipcloth which appeared vaguely gray in this light. His features were strong: a thick chin, wide mouth, beaked nose and bushy eyebrows over dark eyes, a bit of silver at the temples. He touched his temples. The reduced reflection exaggerated his feeling that he had been made small by Ship’s treatment of him. His reflection showed him his own fear.\n\nI will not be tricked by a damned machine!\n\nThe memory brought on another fit of trembling. Ship had refused him at the shiptits often enough that he understood this new message. He had stopped with Jesus Lewis at a bank of corridor shiptits.\n\nLewis had been amused. Don’t waste time with these things. The ship won’t feed us.\n\nThis had angered Oakes. It’s my privilege to waste time! Don’t you ever forget that!\n\nHe had rolled up his sleeve and thrust his bare arm into the receptacle. The sensor scratched as it adjusted to his arm. He felt the stainless-steel nose sniff out a suitable vein. There was the tingling prick of the test probe, then the release of the sensor.\n\nSome of the shiptits extruded plaz tubes to suck on, but this one was programmed to fill a container behind a locked panel—elixir, measured and mixed to his exact needs.\n\nThe panel opened!\n\nOakes grinned at an astounded Lewis.\n\nWell, Oakes remembered saying. The ship finally realizes who’s the boss here. With that, he drained the container.\n\nHorrible!\n\nHis body was wracked with vomiting. His breath came in shallow gasps and sweat soaked his singlesuit.\n\nIt was over as quickly as it began. Lewis stood beside him in dumb amazement, looking at the mess Oakes had made of the corridor and his boots.\n\nYou see, Oakes gasped. You see how the ship tried to kill me?\n\nRelax, Morgan, Lewis said. It’s probably just a malfunction. I’ll call a med-tech for you and a repair robox for this … this thing.\n\nI’m a doctor, dammit! I don’t need a med-tech poking around me. Oakes held the fabric of his suit away from his body.\n\nThen let’s get you back to your cubby. We should check you out and … Lewis broke off, looking suddenly over Oakes’ shoulder. Morgan, did you summon a repair unit?\n\nOakes turned to see what had caught Lewis’ attention, saw one of the ship’s robox units, a one-meter oval of bronze turtle with wicked-looking tools clutched in its extensors. It was weaving drunkenly down the corridor toward them.\n\nWhat do you suppose is wrong with that thing? Lewis muttered.\n\nI think it’s here to attack us, Oakes said. He grabbed Lewis’ arm. Let’s back out of here … slow, now.\n\nThey retreated from the shiptit station, watching the scanner eye of the robox and the waving appendages full of tools.\n\nIt’s not stopping. Oakes’ voice was low but cold with fear as the robox passed the shiptit station.\n\nWe’d better run for it, Lewis said. He spun Oakes ahead of him into a main passageway to Medical. Neither man looked back until they were safely battened inside Oakes’ cubby.\n\nHah! Oakes thought, remembering. That had frightened even Lewis. He had gone back groundside fast enough—to speed up construction of their Redoubt, the place which would insulate them groundside and make them independent of this damned machine.\n\nThe ship’s controlled our lives too long!\n\nOakes still tasted bitterness at the back of his throat. Now, Lewis was incommunicado … sending notes by courier. Always something frustrating.\n\nDamn Lewis!\n\nOakes glanced around his shadowed quarters. It was nightside on the orbiting ship and most of the crew drifted on the sea of sleep. An occasional click and buzz of servos modulating the environment were the only intrusions.\n\nHow long before Ship’s servos go mad?\n\nThe ship, he reminded himself.\n\nShip was a concept, a fabricated theology, a fairy tale imbedded in a manufactured history which only a fool could believe.\n\nIt is a lie by which we control and are controlled.\n\nHe tried to relax into the thick cushions and once more took up the note which one of Lewis’ minions had thrust upon him. The message was simple, direct and threatening.\n\nThe ship informs us that it is sending groundside one (1) Chaplain/Psychiatrist competent in communications. Reason: the unidentified Ceepee will mount a project to communicate with the electrokelp. I can find no additional information about this Ceepee but he has to be someone new from hyb.\n\nOakes crumpled the note in his fist.\n\nOne Ceepee was all this society could tolerate. The ship was sending another message to him. You can he replaced.\n\nHe had never doubted that there were other Chaplain/Psychiatrists somewhere in the ship’s hyb reserves. No telling where those reserves might be hidden. The damned ship was a convoluted mess with secret sections and random extrusions and concealed passages which led nowhere.\n\nColony had measured the ship’s size by the occlusion shadow when it had eclipsed one of the two suns on a low passage. The ship was almost fifty-eight kilometers long, room to hide almost anything.\n\nBut now we have a planet under us: Pandora.\n\nGroundside!\n\nHe looked at the crumpled note in his hand. Why a note? He and Lewis were supposed to have an infallible means of secret communication—the only two Shipmen so gifted. It was why they trusted each other.\n\nDo I really trust Lewis?\n\nFor the fifth time since receiving the note, Oakes triggered the alpha-blink which activated the tiny pellet imbedded in the flesh of his neck. No doubt the thing was working. He sensed the carrier wave which linked the capsule computer to his aural nerves, and there was that eerie feeling of a blank screen in his imagination, the knowledge that he was poised to experience a waking dream. Somewhere groundside the tight-band transmission should be alerting Lewis to this communication. But Lewis was not responding.\n\nEquipment failure?\n\nOakes knew that was not the problem. He personally had implanted the counterpart of this pellet in Lewis’ neck, had made the nerve hookups himself.\n\nAnd I supervised Lewis while he made my implant.\n\nWas the damned ship interfering?\n\nOakes peered around at the elaborate changes he had introduced into his cubby. The ship was everywhere, of course. All of them shipside were in the ship. This cubby, though, had always been different … even before he had made his personal alterations. This was the cubby of a Chaplain/Psychiatrist.\n\nThe rest of the crew lived simply. They slept suspended in hammocks which translated the gentle swayings of the ship into sleep. Many incorporated padded pallets or cushions for those occasions that arose between men and women. That was for love, for relaxation, for relief from the long corridors of plasteel which sometimes wound tightly around the psyche and squeezed out your breath.\n\nBreeding, though … that came under strictest Ship controls. Every Natural Natal had to be born shipside and under the supervision of a trained obstetrics crew—the damned Natali with their air of superior abilities. Did the ship talk to them? Feed them? They never said.\n\nOakes thought about the shipside breeding rooms. Although plush by usual cubby standards, they never seemed as stimulating as his own cubby. Even the perimeter treedomes were preferred by some—under dark bushes … on open grass. Oakes smiled. His cubby, though—this was opulent. Women had been known to gasp when first entering the vastness of it. From the core of the Ceepee’s cubby, this one had been expanded into the space of five cubbies.\n\nAnd the damned ship never once interfered.\n\nThis place was a symbol of power. It was an aphrodisiac which seldom failed. It also exposed the lie of Ship.\n\nThose of us who see the lie, control. Those who don’t see it … don’t.\n\nHe felt a little giddy. Effect of the Pandoran wine, he thought. It snaked through his veins and wormed into his consciousness. But even the wine could not make him sleep. At first, its peculiar sweetness and the thick warmth had promised to dull the edge of doubts that kept him pacing the nightside passages. He had lived on three or four hours’ sleep each period for … how long now? Annos … annos …\n\nOakes shook his head to clear it and felt the ripple of his jowls against his neck. Fat. He had never been supple, never selected for breeding.\n\nEdmond Kingston chose me to succeed him, though. First Ceepee in history not selected by the damned ship.\n\nWas he going to be replaced by this new Ceepee the ship had chosen to send groundside?\n\nOakes sighed.\n\nLately, he knew he had turned sallow and heavy.\n\nToo much demand on my head and not enough on my body.\n\nNever a lack of couch partners, though. He patted the cushions at his side, remembering.\n\nI’m fifty, fat and fermented, he thought. Where do I go from here?\n\nChapter 3\n\nThe all-pervading, characterless background of the universe—this is the void. It is not object nor senses. It is the region of illusions.\n\n—Kerro Panille, Buddha and Avata\n\nWild variety marked the naked band of people hobbling and trudging across the open plain between bulwarks of black crags. The red-orange light of a single sun beat down on them from the meridian, drawing purple shadows on the coarse sand and pebbles of the plain. Vagrant winds whisked at random dust pockets, and the band gave wary attention to these disturbances. Occasional stubby plants with glistening silver leaves aligned themselves with the sun in the path of the naked band. The band steered a course to avoid the plants.\n\nThe people of the band showed only remote kinship with their human ancestry. Most of them turned to a tall companion as their leader, although this one did not walk at the point. He had ropey gray arms and a narrow head crowned by golden fuzz, the only suggestion of hair on his slender body. The head carried two golden eyes in bony extrusions at the temples, but there was no nose and only a tiny red circle of mouth. There were no visible ears, but brown skin marked the spots where ears might have been. The arms ended in supple hands, each with three six-jointed fingers and opposable thumb. The name Theriex was tattooed in green across his hairless chest.\n\nBeside the tall Theriex hobbled a pale and squat figure with no neck to support a hairless bulb of head. Tiny red eyes, set close to a moist hole which trembled with each breath, could stare only where the body pointed. The ears were gaping slits low at each side of the head. Fat and corded arms ended in two fingerless fleshy mittens. The legs were kneeless tubes without feet.\n\nOthers in the band showed a similar diversity. There were heads with many eyes and some with none. There were great coned nostrils and horned ears, dancers’ legs and some stumps. They numbered forty-one in all and they huddled close as they walked, presenting a tight wall of flesh to the Pandoran wilderness. Some clung to each other as they stumbled and lurched their way across the plain. Others maintained a small moat of open space. There was little conversation—an occasional grunt or moan, sometimes a plaintive question directed at Theriex.\n\nWhere can we hide, Ther? Who will take us in?\n\nIf we can get to the other sea, Theriex said. The Avata …\n\nThe Avata, yes, the Avata.\n\nThey spoke it as a prayer. A deep rumbling voice in the band took it up then: All-Human one, All-Avata one.\n\nAnother spoke: Ther, tell us the story of Avata.\n\nTheriex remained silent until they were all pleading: Yes, Ther, tell us the story … the story, the story …\n\nTheriex raised a ropey hand for silence, then: When Avata speaks of beginning, Avata speaks of rock and the brotherhood of rock. Before rock there was sea, boiling sea, and the blisters of light that boiled it. With the boiling and the cooling came the ripping of the moons, the teeth of the sea gone mad. By day all things scattered in the boil, and by night they joined in the relief of sediment and they rested.\n\nTheriex had a thin whistling voice which carried over the shuffling sounds of the band’s passage. He spoke to an odd rhythm which fitted itself to their march.\n\nThe suns slowed their great whirl and the seas cooled. Some few who joined remained joined. Avata knows this because it is so, but the first word of Avata is rock.\n\nThe rock, the rock, Theriex’s companions responded.\n\nThere is no growth on the run, Theriex said. Before rock Avata was tired and Avata was many and Avata had seen only the sea.\n\nWe must find the Avata sea …\n\nBut to grip a rock, Theriex said, to coil around it close and lie still, that is a new dream and a new life—untossed by the ravages of moon, untired. It was vine to leaf then, and in the new confidence of rock came the coil of power and the gas, gift of the sea.\n\nTheriex tipped his head back to look up at the metallic blue of the sky and, for a few paces, remained silent, then: Coil of power, touch of touches! Avata captured lightning that day, curled tight around its rock, waiting out the silent centuries in darkness and in fear. Then the first spark arced into the horrible night: ‘Rock!’\n\nOnce more, the others responded, Rock! Rock! Rock!\n\nCoil of power! Theriex repeated. Avata knew rock before knowing Self; and the second spark snapped: I! Then the third, greatest of all: I! Not rock!\n\nNot rock, not rock, the others responded.\n\nThe source is always with us, Theriex said, as it is with that which we are not. It is in reference that we are. It is through the other that Self is known. And where there is only one, there is nothing else. From the nothing else comes no reflection of Self, nothing returns. But for Avata there was rock, and because there was rock there was something returned and that something was Self. Thus, the finite becomes infinite. One is not. But we are joined in the infinite, in the closeness out of which all matter comes. Let Avata’s rock steady you in the sea!\n\nFor a time after Theriex fell silent, the band trudged and hobbled onward without complaint. There was a smell of acid burning on the whisking breezes, though, and one of the band with a sensitive nose detected this.\n\nI smell Nerve Runners! he said.\n\nA shudder ran through them and they quickened their pace while those at the edges scanned the plain around them with renewed caution.\n\nAt the point of the band walked a darkly furred figure with a long torso and stumpy legs which ended in round flat pads. The arms were slim and moved with a snakelike writhing. They ended in two-fingered hands, the fingers muscular, long and twining, as though designed to reach into strange places for mysterious reasons. The ears were motile, large and leathery under their thin coat of fur, pointing now one direction and now another. The head sat on a slender neck, presenting a markedly human face, although flattened and covered with that fine gauze of dark fur. The eyes were blue, heavy-lidded and bulging. They were glassy and appeared to focus on nothing.\n\nThe plain around them, out to the crags about ten kilometers distant, was devoid of motion now, marked only by scattered extrusions of black rock and the stiff-leaved plants making their slow phototropic adjustments to the passage of the red-orange sun.\n\nThe ears of the furred figure at the point suddenly stretched out, cupped and aimed at the crags directly ahead of the band.\n\nAbruptly, a screeching cry echoed across the plain from that direction. The band stopped as a single organism, caught in fearful waiting. The cry had been terrifyingly loud to carry that far across the plain.\n\nA near-hysterical voice called from within the band: We have no weapons!\n\nRocks, Theriex said, waving an arm at the extruded black shapes all around.\n\nThey’re too big to throw, someone complained.\n\nThe rocks of the Avata, Theriex said, and his voice carried the tone he had used while lulling his band with the story of Avata.\n\nStay away from the plants, someone warned.\n\nThere was no real need for this warning. They all knew about the plants—most poisonous, all capable of slashing soft flesh. Three of the band already had been lost to the plants.\n\nAgain, that cry pierced the air.\n\nThe rocks, Theriex repeated.\n\nSlowly, the band separated, singly and in small groups, moving out to the rocks where they huddled up to the black surfaces, clinging there, most of them with faces pressed against the darkness.\n\nI see them, Theriex said. Hooded Dashers.\n\nAll turned then to look where Theriex looked.\n\nRock, the dream of life, Theriex said. To grip rock, to coil around it close and lie still.\n\nAs he spoke, he continued to stare across the plain at the nine black shapes hurtling toward him. Hooded Dashers, yes, many-legged, and with enfolding hoods instead of mouths. The hoods retracted to reveal thrashing fangs. They moved with terrifying speed.\n\nWe should have taken our chances at the Redoubt with the others! someone wailed.\n\nDamn you, Jesus Lewis! someone shouted. Damn you!\n\nThey were the last fully coherent words from the band as the Hooded Dashers charged at blurring speed onto its scattered members. Teeth slashed, claws raked. The speed of the attack was merciless. Hoods retracted, the Dashers darted and whirled. No victim had a second chance. Some tried to run and were cut down on the open plain. Some tried to dodge around the rocks but were cornered by pairs of demons. It was over in blinks, and the nine Dashers set to feeding. Things groped from beneath the rocks to share the feast. Even nearby plants drank red liquid from the ground.\n\nWhile the Dashers fed, subtle movements changed the craggy skyline to the north. Great floating orange bags lifted above the rocky bulwarks there and drifted on the upper winds toward the Dashers. The floaters trailed long tendrils which occasionally touched the plain, stirring up dust. The Dashers saw this but showed no fear.\n\nHigh wavering crests rippled along the tops of the bags, adjusting to the wind. A piping song could be heard from them now, like wind through sails accompanied by a metallic rattling.\n\nWhen the orange bags were still several kilometers distant, one of the Dashers barked a warning. It stared away from the bags at a boil of stringy tendrils disturbing the plain about fifty meters off. A strong smell of burning acid wafted from the boil. As one, the nine Dashers whirled and fled. The one which had fed on Theriex uttered a high scream as it raced across the plain, and then, quite clearly, it called out: Theriex!\n\nChapter 4\n\nA deliberately poor move chosen at random along the line of plan can completely change the theoretical structure of a game.\n\n—Bickel quote, Shiprecords\n\nOakes paced his cubby, fretting. It had been several nightside hours since he had last tried to contact Lewis on their implanted communicators. Lewis definitely was out of touch.\n\nCould it be something wrong at the Redoubt?\n\nOakes doubted this. The finest materials were going into that base out on Black Dragon. Lewis was sparing nothing in the construction. It would be impenetrable by any force known to Pandora or Shipmen … any force, except …\n\nOakes stopped his pacing, scanned the plasteel walls of his cubby.\n\nWould the Redoubt down on Pandora really insulate them from the ship?\n\nThe wine he had drunk earlier was beginning to relax him, clearing the bitter taste from his tongue. His room felt stuffy and isolated even from the ship. Let the damned ship send another Ceepee groundside. Whoever it was would be taken care of in due course.\n\nOakes let his body sag onto a couch and tried to forget the latest attack on him by the ship. He closed his eyes and drifted in a half-dream back to his beginning.\n\nNot quite. Not quite the beginning.\n\nHe did not like to admit the gap. There were things he did not remember. Doubts intruded and the carrier wave of the pellet in his neck distracted him. He sent the nerve signal to turn the thing off.\n\nLet Lewis try to contact me!\n\nOakes heaved an even deeper sigh. Not the beginning—no. There were things about his beginnings that the records did not show. This ship with all the powers of a god would not or could not provide a complete background on Morgan Oakes. And the Ceepee was supposed to have access to everything. Everything!\n\nEverything except that distant origin somewhere earthside … back on far-away Earth … long-gone Earth.\n\nHe knew he had been six when his first memory images gelled and stayed with him. He even knew the year—6001 dating from the birth of the Divine Imhotep.\n\nSpring. Yes, it had been spring and he had been living in the power center, in Aegypt, in the beautiful city of Heliopolis. From the Britone March to the Underlands of Ind, all was Graeco-Roman peace fed by the Nile’s bounty and enforced by the hired troopers of Aegypt. Only in the outlands of Chin and the continents of East Chin far across the Nesian Sea were there open conflicts of nations. Yes … spring … and he had been living with his parents in Heliopolis. Both of his parents were on assignment with the military. This he knew from the records. His parents were perhaps the finest geneticists in the Empire. They were training for a project that was to take over young Morgan’s life completely. They were preparing a trip to the stars. This, too, he was told. But that had been many years later, and too late for him to object.\n\nWhat he remembered was a man, a black man. He liked to imagine him one of the dark priests of Aegypt that he watched every week on the viewer. The man walked past Morgan’s quarters every afternoon. Where he went, and why he went only one way, Morgan never knew.\n\nThe fence around his parents’ quarters was much higher than the black man’s head. It was a mesh of heavy steel curved outwards and down at the top. Every afternoon Morgan watched the man walk by, and tried to imagine how the man came to be black. Morgan did not ask his parents because he wanted to figure it out for himself.\n\nOne morning early his father said, The sun’s going nova.\n\nHe never forgot those words, those powerful words, even though he did not know their meaning.\n\nIt’s been kept quiet, but even the Roman Empire can’t hide this heat. All the chants of all the priests of Ra won’t make one damn whit of difference.\n\nHeat? his mother shot back. Heat is something you can live in, you can deal with. But this … she waved her hand at the large window, this is only a step away from fire.\n\nSo, he thought, it was the sun made that man black.\n\nHe was ten before he realized that the man who walked past was black from birth, from conception. Still, Morgan persisted in telling the other children in his crèche that it was the sun’s doing. He enjoyed the secret game of persuasion and deception.\n\nAh, the power of the game, even then!\n\nOakes straightened the cushion at his back. Why did he think of that black man, now? There had been one curious event, a simple thing that caused a commotion and fixed it in his memory.\n\nHe touched me.\n\nOakes could not recall being touched by anyone except his parents until that moment. On that very hot day, he sat outside on a step, cooled by the shade of the roof and the ventilator trained on his back from the doorway. The man walked by, as usual, then stopped and turned back. The boy watched him, curious, through the mesh fence, and the man studied him carefully, as though noticing him for the first time.\n\nOakes recalled the sudden jump of his heart, that feeling of a slingshot pulled back, back.\n\nThe man looked around, then up at the top of the fence, and the next thing Oakes knew the man was over the top, walking up to him. The black man stopped, reached out a hesitant hand and touched the boy’s cheek. Oakes also reached out, equally curious, and touched the black skin of the man’s arm.\n\nHaven’t you ever seen a little boy before? he asked.\n\nThe black face widened into a smile, and he said, Yes, but not a little boy like you.\n\nThen a sentry jumped on the man out of nowhere and took him away. Another sentry pulled the boy inside and called his father. He remembered that his father was angry. But best of all he remembered the look of wide-eyed wonder on the black man’s face, the man who never walked by again. Oakes felt special then, powerful, an object of deference. He had always been someone to reckon with.\n\nWhy do I remember that man?\n\nIt seemed as though he spent all of his private hours asking himself questions lately. Questions led to more questions, led ultimately, daily, to the one question that he refused to admit into his consciousness. Until now.\n\nHe voiced the question aloud to himself, tested it on his tongue like the long-awaited wine.\n\nWhat if the damned ship is God?\n\nChapter 5\n\nHuman hybernation is to animal hibernation as animal hibernation is to constant wakefulness. In its reduction of life processes, hybernation approaches absolute stasis. It is nearer death than life.\n\n—Dictionary of Science, 101st Edition\n\nRaja Flattery lay quietly in the hybernation cocoon while he fought to overcome his terrors.\n\nShip has me.\n\nMoody waves confused his memories but he knew several things. He could almost project these things onto the ebon blackness which surrounded him.\n\nI was Chaplain/Psychiatrist on the Voidship Earthling.\n\nWe were supposed to produce an artificial consciousness. Very dangerous, that.\n\nAnd they had produced … something. That something was Ship, a being of seemingly infinite powers.\n\nGod or Satan?\n\nFlattery did not know. But Ship had created a paradise planet for its cargo of clones and then had introduced a new concept: WorShip. It had demanded that the human clones decide how they would WorShip.\n\nWe failed in that, too.\n\nWas it because they were"
