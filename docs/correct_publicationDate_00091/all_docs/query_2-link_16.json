        "text": "There’s so much to say on this book, the complexity of the characters the ship cloning religion too much to go on\n\nI enjoyed reading this book. It’s actually the second time that I’ve read it the first time I read it I was in junior high ￼\n\nAnd it was just as good then, as it was now ￼\n\nCerebral journey on a hostile world\n\nColonists on Pandora face a planet designed to kill them. The enigmatic Ship watches from above, and has thawed out a hibernating chaplain-psychiatrist to complete the players in a power struggle of politics, religion, and biology - if they survive the hostile environment, they must still learn to WorShip or be destroyed. Recommended for fans of Dune and Herbert’s other work. While a sequel to “Destination: Void”, you can start here. Excellent performance by Scott Brick.\n\nBLUE ITSELF, TEACHES US BLUE\n\nTHINK HOW LONG YOU'LL LIVE IF YOUR ALWAYS WAITING\n\nAll of Herbert's writings are deep, full of overly thought out worlds. They include political and religious systems, often very foreign to the known. They are so different, it is difficult for the average person to wrap their head around them. Herbert's books are often long, as the explaining of these worlds is a long torturous path. When I was in my early twenties I picked up Dune, two or three times, but could not figure it out. Than the movie came out and now it is one of my favorites. Dune is a complex rich story, complete in all aspects. This book might be the same, but until I see the movie, I will probably not get my tiny brain around it.\n\nScott Brick\n\nBrick has changed and is now one of the better narrators. It is not BS, SB is good.\n\nGreat Depth\n\nWhat did you like best about this story?\n\nI loved the Dune series for the depth of emotion that Frank Herbert creates with his characters. This book did not disappoint.\n\nInteresting ideas but falls flat\n\nThis book is much slower than novels written by just Frank Herbert. It finally gets interesting and active toward the end, but then the very end falls flat. It spends a lot of time at the beginning developing the story very slowly and building very slowly and in the end only sort of crescendos into, what? The authors don't really paint a clear picture of the result of it all. It's missing the clarity and punch Frank Herbert novels have. I'm sure collaborating is hard and that seems to have left this novel diffuse in a way that made the effort of reading it feel very unsatisfactory. It's also a shame because some of the ideas they're exploring, like godhood and mass consciousness, and the way they're exploring it is very interesting. They set it in a very engaging and interesting universe that's different than what we know in our day-to-day lives, and they succeed at painting a very clear picture of it, but then they fail to exploit that reality in an effective way that tells a really good story."
