        "text": "I like Izkata's comment so much I'm going to repost it as a real answer.\n\nIt seems to be word play on Jeez Louise. I believe this is just the kind of weird name logic that Herbert would have used, considering the character.\n\nThe entire \"Jesus Lewis\" character is the most perplexing thing about the novel to me. The choice of name sticks out like a sore thumb considering how prominently the biblical Jesus is discussed over the course of the novel.\n\nBut anyway, while I'm not sure exactly what point Frank Herbert was trying to make, I'm pretty sure the choice of name is a reference to Lewis's Trilemma.\n\nWhat is revealed about \"Jesus Lewis\" at the end of the novel more or less confirms it for me.\n\nEdit: Sorry for the incomplete response, as you suspected I was trying to avoid spoilers. I've added more info hidden behind the spoiler tag.\n\nIn summary, Lewis's Trilemma is the argument that Jesus must have been either been 1) an evil person who lied about what he preached 2) a crazy person who was deluded about what he preached 3) a true agent of God. The point of the argument is to reject compromises. It's not enough to merely hold Jesus as an example of moral humanity. Either you accept him completely as divine and worship him or you must reject him as a false prophet.\n\n-\n\nConcerning Jesus Lewis specifically, whatever pretense the novel had for presenting his name as a coincidence (Heysoos vs Geezus) was dispelled in the conclusion when Ship explicitly identifies Jesus Lewis as Its agent and whisks him away in a flash of light. It specifically refers to him as \"a real Devil\" and \"the other half of me\", implied to be the only character that was not an independent agent and directly following Ship's designs.\n\n-\n\nFollowing this, Hali Ekel (who was chosen to witness the crucixion of \"Yaisuah\" (Jesus Christ) in a time travel event) asks Ship if Yaisuah was also \"another filament from one of Your dreams?\" Ship's answer is that it does not matter if Yaisuah was real or fictional. The lesson was that Yaisuah was the \"ultimate essence of goodness\", and Jesus Lewis \"its opposite\", and it was necessary for the Shipmen to experience both to understand them. Finally, Ship itself did not want to be \"WorShipped\" as a God, but encourage humans to achieve their own consciousness/conscience and become independent. In other words it rejects Lewis's Trilemma."
