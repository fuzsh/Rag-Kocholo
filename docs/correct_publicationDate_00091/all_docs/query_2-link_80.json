The determined colonists attempt to establish a bridgehead on the deadly, inhospitable planet, but more trouble arises. Their sentient ship - backed up by an impressive array of armaments - has decided it is God and is insisting the colonists find appropriate ways to worship it.\n\nIn an attempt to help the people pass its test, Ship awakens chaplain-psychiatrist Raja Flattery from hibernation. Either the humans pass the test - or the human race could be destroyed.”"
