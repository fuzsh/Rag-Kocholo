        "text": "Book Description\n\nPandora’s humans have been recovering land from its raging seas at an accelerated pace since The Lazarus Effect. The great kelp of the seas, sentient but electronically manipulated by humans, buffers Pandora’s wild currents to restore land and facilitate the booming sea trade. New settlements rise overnight, but children starve in their shadows. An orbiting assembly station is near completion of Project Voidship, which is the hope of many for finding a better world.\n\nPandora is under the fist of an ambitious clone from hibernation called The Director, who rules with a sadistic security force led by the assassin Spider Nevi. Small resistance groups, like the one led by Twisp Queets and Ben Ozette, have had little effect on his absolute power. The Director controls the transportation of foodstuffs; uprisings are punished with starvation.\n\nThe resistance fighters’ main hope is Crista Galli, a woman believed by some to be the child of God. Crista pools her talents with Dwarf MacIntosh, Beatriz Tatoosh, and Rico LaPush to transcend the barriers between the different species and overthrow The Director and the sinister cabal with which he rules.\n\nFrank Herbert\n\nBill Ransom\n\nKobo Edition – January 2015\n\nWordFire Press\n\nwordfirepress.com\n\nISBN: 978-1-61475-258-5\n\nCopyright © 1988, 2012 Herbert Properties, LLC and Bill Ransom\n\nOriginally published by Ace/G.P.

The Warrior’s Union thugs were professionals; if he passed out he simply wasted their time. In his three days at their hands he had never passed out. They knew that he was no good to them right from the start. The rest of his agony had been the penalty he paid for wasting their time. When they were through tormenting him at last they hooked him up, as he knew they would, to the obsidian cliff below the high reaches. Subversives were hooked up to die in full view of the settlement as a lesson—the exact meaning of the lesson was never clear.\n\nThe three from the Warrior’s Union hooked him up there in the dark, as they’d taken him in the dark, and Jephtha thought them cowards for this. His left eyelid was less swollen than the right, and he managed to work it open. A pale hint of dawn pried the starry sky away from the black cheek of the sea. Predawn lights of a commuter ferry wallowed at the dark dockside down below him in the settlement. Like the rest, it loaded up the shift changes of workers at Project Voidship.\n\nRunning lights from the submersible ferries flickered the night sea’s blackness all the way from the settlement at Kalaloch out to the project’s launch tower complex. A maze of organic dikes and rock jetties fanned out both up-and downcoast, supporting the new aquaculture projects of Merman Mercantile, none of which had hired Jephtha after his fishing gear had been seized and his license revoked. His partner had kept a couple of fish for himself instead of registering them dockside. The Director’s new economy prohibited this, and the Director’s henchmen made a lesson of the both of them.\n\nUnder the opening sky of morning Jephtha felt himself lighten, then separate from his body. He peeled the pain from himself, his self wriggling free of its wounded skin like a molted skreet, and watched the sagging wretch of his flesh from atop a boulder a couple of meters away. This far south, Pandora’s days lasted nearly fourteen hours. He wondered how many more breaths he had left in his sack of cracked ribs and pain.\n\nMarica, he thought, my Marica and our three little wots. The Warrior’s Union said they’d hunt them down, too.…\n\nThey would think maybe she had something to tell. They would claim that his woman and their three little ones were dangerous, subversive. They would start on the children to make her talk and she could say nothing, she knew nothing. Jephtha squeezed his good eye closed against his blood and shame.\n\nThe Director’s special squad of the Warrior’s Union had pierced Jephtha’s chest and back with maki hooks, steel fishhooks with a cruel incurve the size of his thumb. They caught the glimmer of fresh daylight like armor across his chest. The steel snaffles and cable leaders hung to his knees like a kilt. The glitter of the hooks, as well as the smell of his blood, would attract the dasher that would kill him.\n\nJephtha had caught thousands of maki on hooks like these, set tens of thousands of these ganions on hundreds of longlines. Most of them hung free now, clinking with his movements or the rare morning breeze. His weight hung from two dozen of them—twelve puncturing the skin of his chest, and twelve through his back. He thought this had a significance, too, but they had not told him what it was. But they had told him what he’d wanted to know for years.\n\nThe Shadows are real! Jephtha played the thought over and over. The Shadows are real!\n\nEveryone had heard about these Shadows, but no one he knew had ever met one. Now in the last few months had come the mysterious broadcasts on the holo or the telly or the radio made by Shadowbox. Everybody said those were the work of the Shadows. There were stories in every village about their fight to depose the Director, Raja Flattery, and hamstring his hired muscle. The Nightly News reported daily on Shadow activities: detoured supplies, food theft, sabotage. Anything unpopular or harmful to the Director’s cause was laid at the Shadows’ hatch, including natural disasters. Shadowbox, using pirated air space and great expertise, reported on the Director.\n\nJephtha had whispered around many a hatchway trying to join up with the Shadows, but no word came forward. Shadowbox had given him enough hope that he had set out to strike his own blow. He understood, now, that this was how the Shadows worked.\n\nHe’d wanted to destroy the seat of power itself—the main electrical station between the Director’s private compound and the sprawling manufacturing settlement adjacent to it, Kalaloch.\n\nThe power station that Jephtha chose was a hydrogen retrieval plant that supplied hydrogen, oxygen and electricity to all of the subcontractors in the Director’s space program. Blowing the plant would set Flattery’s precious Project Voidship and his orbiting factory on its heels for a while. The poor of the town were used to doing without, Jephtha reasoned. Thousands didn’t even have electricity. It would be this new Voidship project and Flattery who would be most crippled. He should have known that the Director’s security had already thought of that.\n\nThe interrogation had been very old-fashioned, as most of them were. He’d been caught easily and forced to stand naked under a hood for three days while being tortured for nothing. Now a host of steel snaffles clinked against hooks whenever any of his muscles moved. His wounds, for the most part, had stopped bleeding. That just made the flies sting him more. Two poisonous flatwings crawled his left leg, fluttering their wings in some ritual dance, but neither bit.\n\nDashers, he prayed. If it’s anything, let it be dashers and quick. That was what they’d hung him out there for—dasher bait. The hooded dasher would strike him hard, as is their habit, then it would get hung up on the maki hooks and snare itself. The hide would bring a pretty price in the village market. It was an amusement to the security guards, and he’d heard them planning to split the change they’d get for the hide. He didn’t want to be nibbled to death, a dasher would accommodate him nicely. His mouth was so dry from thirst that his lips split every time he coughed.\n\nIn this hungry downslide of his life Jephtha had dared to hope for two things: to join up with the Shadows, and to glimpse Her Holiness, Crista Galli. He had tried his best with the Shadows. Here, chained to the rocks overlooking the Director’s compound, Jephtha watched the stirrings of the great household through his darkening vision.\n\nOne of them might be her, he thought. He was lightheaded, and he puffed his chest against the hooks and thought, If I were a Shadow, I’d get her out of there.\n\nCrista Galli was the holy innocent, a mysterious young woman born deep in the wild kelp beds twenty-four years ago. When Flattery’s people blew up a rogue kelp bed five years back, Crista Galli surfaced with the debris. How she’d been raised by the kelp underwater and delivered back to humankind was one of those mysteries that Jephtha and his family accepted simply as miracle.\n\nIt was rumored that Crista Galli held the hope for Pandora’s salvation. People claimed that she would feed the hungry, heal the sick, comfort the dying. The Director, a Chaplain/Psychiatrist, kept her locked away.\n\nShe needs protection, Flattery had said. She grew up with the kelp, she needs to know what it is to be human.\n\nHow ironic that Flattery would set out to teach her how to be human. Jephtha knew now, with the clarity of his pain-transcendence, that she was the Director’s prisoner down there as much as all Pandorans were his slaves. Except for now, at the base of the high reaches, Jephtha’s chains had been invisible: hunger chains, propaganda chains, the chain of the fear of God that rattled in his head like cold teeth.\n\nHe prayed that the security would not find Marica and the wots. The settlement sprawled, people hid people like fish among fish.\n\nMaybe …\n\nHe shook his head, clink-clinking the terrible hooks and snaffles. He felt nothing except the cool breeze that wafted up from morning low tide. It brought the familiar iodine scent of kelp decomposing on the beach.\n\nThere! At that port high in the main building …\n\nThe glimpse was gone, but Jephtha’s heart raced. His good eye was not focusing and a new darkness was upon him, but he was sure that the form he’d seen had been the pale Crista Galli.\n\nShe can’t know of this, he thought. If she knew what a monster Raja Flattery is, and she could do it, she would destroy him. Surely if she knew, she would save us all.\n\nHis thoughts again turned to Marica and the wots. The thoughts were not so much thoughts as dreams. He saw her with the children, hand in hand, traversing an upcoast field in the sunlight. The single sun was bright but not scorching, there were no bugs. Their bare feet were cushioned by the fleshy blossoms of a thousand kinds of flowers.…\n\nA dasher shriek from somewhere below jerked him out of his dream. He knew there was no field without bugs, nowhere on Pandora to stroll barefoot through blossoms. He knew that Vashon security and the Warrior’s Union were known for their persistence, their efficiency, their ruthlessness. They were after his wife and their children, and they would find them. His last hope was that the dasher would find him before they hooked what was left of Marica up here by his side.\n\nChapter 2\n\nAgain we have let another Chaplain/Psychiatrist kill tens of thousands of us—Islander and Merman alike. This new C/P, Raja Flattery, calls himself the Director, but he will see. We have kissed the ring and bared the throat for the last time.\n\n—First Shadowbox broadcast, 5 Bunratti 493\n\nFirst light through the single plasma-glass pane stroked a plain white pillow with its rosy fingers. It outlined the sparse but colorful furnishings of this cubby in shades of gray. The cubby itself, though squarely on land and squarely gridded to a continent, reflected traditions of a culture freely afloat for nearly five centuries on Pandora’s seas.\n\nThese Islanders, the biowizards of Pandora, grew everything. They grew their cups and bowls, the famous chairdogs, insulation, bondable organics, rugs, shelves and the islands themselves. This cubby was organically furnished, and under the old law warranted a heft of supply chits that converted easily to food coupons. Black-market coupons were a cheap enough price for the Director to pay to assimilate the Islander culture that had been dashed to the rocks the day he splashed down on the sea.\n\nAs the grip of dawn strengthened into morning it further brightened the single wall-hanging of clasped hands that enriched this small cubby. Red and blue fishes swam the border, their delicate fins interlacing broad green leaves of kelp. Orange fin and blue leaf joined at the foot of the hanging to form a stylized Oracle. The tight stitch of the pattern and its crisp colors all rippled with the progress of dawn. A sleeper’s chest rose and fell gently on the bed beneath them.\n\nThe night and its shadows shrank back from the plasma-glass window at the head of the bed. Islanders had always enjoyed the light and in building their islands they let it in wherever they could. They persisted in light, even though most of them were now solidly marooned on land. In their undersea dwellings Mermen put pictures on their walls of the things they wall out—Islanders preferred the light, the breezes, the smells of life and the living. This cubby was small and spare, but light.\n\nThis was a legal cubby, regularly inspected, a part of the shopkeeper’s quarters. It was a second-floor street room above the new Ace of Cups coffee shop at Kalaloch harbor. A huge white coffee cup swung from a steel rod beneath the window.\n\nAlmost synchronous with the sleeper’s breathing came the slup slup of waves against the bulkhead below. Respirations caught, then resumed at the occasional splashings of a waking squawk and the wind-chime effect of sail riggings that clapped against a host of masts.\n\nDawn brightened the room enough to reveal a seated figure beside the bed. The posture was one of alert stillness. This stillness was broken by an occasional move of cup to mouth, then back to the knee. The figure sat, back to the wall, beside the plaz and facing the hatch. First light glinted from a shining, intricately inlaid Islander cup of hardwood and mother-of-pearl. The hand that held the cup was male, neither delicate nor calloused.\n\nThe figure leaned forward once, noting the depth of the sleeper’s odd, open-eyed slumber. The progress of light across the bay outside their room was reflected in the hardening of shadows inside, and their relentless crawl.\n\nThe watcher, Ben Ozette, pulled the cover higher over the sleeper’s bare shoulder to ward off morning dampness. The pupils in her green irises stayed wide with the onset of dawn. He closed her eyes for her with his thumb. She didn’t seem to mind. The shudder that passed over him uncontrollably was not due to the morning chill.\n\nShe was a picture of white—white hair, eyelashes, eyebrows and a very fair porcelain skin. Her shaggy white hair was cropped around her face, falling nearly to her shoulders in the back. It was a perfect frame to those green, bright eyes. His hand strayed to the pillow, then back.\n\nHis profile in the light revealed the high cheekbones, aquiline nose and high eyebrows of his Merman ancestry. In his years as a reporter for HoloVision, Ben Ozette had become famous, his face as familiar planetwide as that of a brother or a husband. Listeners worldwide recognized his voice immediately. On their Shadowbox broadcasts, however, he became writer and cameramaster and Rico got out in the lights—in disguise, of course. Now their family, friends, coworkers would feel the snap of Flattery’s wrath.\n\nThey hadn’t exactly had time to plan. During their weekly interviews, they both noticed how everyone, including compound security, stayed well out of microphone range as they taped. The next time they walked the grounds as they taped, interviewing with gusto. Then last night they simply walked out. Rico did the rest. The prospect of being hunted by Flattery’s goons dried Ben’s mouth a little. He sipped a little more water.\n\nMaybe it’s true, maybe she’s a construction, he thought. She’s too perfectly beautiful to be an accident.\n\nIf the Director’s memos were right, she was a construction, something grown by the kelp, not someone born of a human. When dredged up at sea she was judged by the examining physician to be a green-eyed albino female, about twenty, in respiratory distress secondary to ingestion of sea water; agitated, recent memory excellent, remote memory judged to be poor, possibly absent.…\n\nIt had been five years since she washed out of the sea and into the news, and in that five years Flattery had allowed no one but his lab people near her. Ben had asked to do the story out of curiosity, and wound up pursuing more than he’d bargained for. He’d learned to hate the Director, and as he watched Crista’s fitful sleep, he wasn’t the least bit sorry.\n\nHe had to admit that, yes, he knew from the first that it had always been a matter of time. He’d fought Flattery and HoloVision too openly and too long.\n\nA recent Shadowbox accused HoloVision of being a monopoly of misinformation, Flattery’s propaganda agent that would not regain credibility until it became worker-owned. Ben had leveled the same attack at the production assistant the previous day.\n\nBen found himself being preempted by propagandistic little specials that Flattery’s technicians were grinding out. Ben and Rico had bought or built their own cameras and laserbases to minimize the company’s intimidation and Flattery’s interference. Now they had full-time, nonpaying jobs as air pirates with Shadowbox.\n\nAnd fugitives, he thought.\n\nBen Ozette eased back into the old chairdog and let the sleeper lie. Of all the deadliness on Pandora, this sleeper could be the most deadly. People had died at her touch, and this was not just the Director’s professional rumor mill. Ben had dared touch her, and he was not yet one of the dead. It was rumored she was very, very bright.\n\nHe whispered her name under his breath.\n\nCrista Galli. Her breathing skipped, she sniffed once, twice and settled down.\n\nCrista Galli had green eyes. Even now they opened ever so slightly, turning toward the sun, visible but not waking.\n\nEerie.\n\nBen’s last love, his longest love, had brown eyes. She had also been his only love, practically speaking. That was Beatriz. Her coffee-colored eyes became vivid to him now against the shadows. Yes, Beatriz. They were still good friends, and she would take this hard. Ben’s heart jumped a beat whenever their wakes crossed, and they crossed often at HoloVision.\n\nBeatriz took on her series about Flattery’s space program, she was away for weeks at a time. Ben freelanced docudramas on earthquake survivors, Islander relocation camps and an in-depth series on the kelp. His latest project featured Crista Galli and her life since her rescue in the kelp.\n\nFlattery agreed to the series and Ben agreed to confine the material to her rescue and subsequent rehabilitation. This project led him into Raja Flattery’s most sacred closets, and further away from Beatriz. The HoloVision rumor mill claimed that she and the Orbiter Commander, Dwarf MacIntosh, were seeing each other lately. Through his own choice Ben and Beatriz had been separated for nearly a year. He knew she’d find someone else eventually. Now that it was real he decided he’d better get used to it.\n\nBeatriz Tatoosh was the most stunning correspondent on HoloVision, and one of the toughest. Like Ben, she did field work for HoloVision Nightly News. She also hosted a weekly feature on the Director’s Project Voidship, a project of great religious and economic controversy. Beatriz championed the project, Ben remained a vocal opponent. He was glad he’d kept her away from the Shadowbox plan. At least she didn’t have to be on the run.\n\nThose dark eyes of hers …\n\nBen snapped himself alert and shook off the vision of Beatriz. Her wide eyes and broad smile dissolved in the sunrise.\n\nThe woman who slept, Crista Galli, put quite a stutter into his heartbeat the first time he saw her. Though she was young, she had more encyclopedic knowledge than anyone he’d ever met. Facts were her thing. About her own life, her nearly twenty years down under, she apparently knew very little. Ben’s agreement with Flattery prohibited much probing of this while they were inside the Preserve.\n\nShe had dreams of value and so he let her dream. He would ask about them when she woke, keep them with his notes, and the two of them would make a plan.\n\nThis, he realized, was something of a dream in itself. There was already a plan, and he would follow the rest of it as soon as he was told what it was.\n\nToday for the first time she would see what the people had made of the myth that was Crista Galli, the holy being that had been kept away from them for so long. She could not know, closed away from humans as she’d been for all of her twenty-four years, what it meant that she had become the people’s god. He hoped that, when the crunch came, she would be a merciful god.\n\nSomeone entered the building below and Ben tensed, setting his cup aside. He patted his jacket pocket where the weight of his familiar recorder had been replaced by Rico’s old lasgun. There was the rush of water and the chatter of a grinder downstairs. A rich coffee fragrance wafted up to him, set his stomach growling. He sipped more water from the cup and half-relaxed.\n\nBen felt his memories pale with the light, but the light did not still his unease. Things were out of control in the world, that had made him uneasy for years. He had a chance to change the world, and he wasn’t letting go of it.\n\nFlattery’s totalitarian fist was something that Beatriz had refused to see. Her dreams lay out among the stars and she would believe almost anything if it would take her there. Ben’s dreams lay at his feet. He believed that Pandorans could make this the best of all worlds, once the Director moved aside. Now that things were out of control in his personal life it made him, for the first time, a little bit afraid.\n\nBen was glad for the light. He reminisced in the dark but he always felt he thought best in the light. The fortune, the future of millions of lives lay sleeping in this cubby. Crista could be either the savior of humanity or its destroying angel.\n\nOr neither.\n\nShadowbox would do its best to give her the chance at savior. Ben and Crista Galli stood at the vortex of the two conflicts dividing Pandora: Flattery’s handhold on their throats, and the Avata/Human standoff that kept it there.\n\nCrista Galli had been born in Avata, the kelp. She represented a true Avata/Human mix, reputed to be the sole survivor of a long line of poets, prophets and genetic tinkering.\n\nShe had been educated by the kelp’s store of genetic memories, human and otherwise. She knew without being taught. She’d heard echoes of the best and the worst of humanity fed to her mind for nearly twenty years. There were some other echoes, too.\n\nThe Others, the thoughts of Avata itself, those were the echoes that the Director feared.\n\nThe kelp’s sent her to spy on us, Flattery was heard to have said early on. No telling what it’s done to her subconscious.\n\nCrista Galli was one of the great mysteries of genetics. The faithful claimed she was a miracle made flesh.\n\nI did it myself, she told him during their first interview, as we all do.\n\nOr, as she put it in their last interview: I made good selections from the DNA buffet.\n\nFlattery’s fear had kept Crista under what he called protective custody for the past five years while the people clamored worldwide for a glimpse. The Director’s Vashon Security Force provided the protection. It was the Vashon Security Force that hunted them now.\n\nShe could be a monster, Ben thought. Some kind of time bomb set by Avata to go off … when? Why?\n\nThe great body of kelp that some called Avata directed the flow of all currents and, therefore, all shipping planetwide. It calmed the ravages of Pandora’s two-sun system, making land and the planet itself possible. Ben, and many others, believed that Avata had a mind of its own.\n\nCrista Galli stirred, tucked herself farther under the quilt and resumed her even breathing. Ben knew that killing her now while she slept might possibly save the world and himself. He had heard that argument among the rabid right, among those accustomed to working with Flattery.\n\nPossibly.\n\nBut Ozette believed now that she could save the world for Avata and human alike, and for this he vowed to guard her every breath—for this, and for the stirrings of love that strained in old traces.\n\nSpider Nevi and his thugs hunted the both of them now. Ben had wooed her away from the Director’s very short leash, but Crista did the rest. Crista and Rico. Ben knew well that the leash would become a lash, a noose for himself and possibly for her next time and he had better see to it that there was no next time. Flattery had made it clear that there was nothing in the world more deadly, more valuable than Crista Galli. The man who’d made off with her wouldn’t be lightly spared.\n\nBen was forty now. At fifteen he’d been plunged into war with the sinking of Guemes Island. Many thousands died that day, brutally slashed, burned, drowned at the attack of a huge Merman submersible, a kelp-trimmer that burst through the center of the old man-made island, lacerating everything in its path. Ben had been rimside when the sudden lurch and collapse sent him tumbling into the pink-frothed sea.\n\nThe years since and the horrors he had seen gave him a wisdom of sorts, an instinct for trouble and the escape hatch. This wisdom was only wisdom as long as he kept alive, and he remembered how easily he had thrown instinct out the porthole the time he fell in love with Beatriz. He had not thought that could happen again until the day he met Crista Galli, a meeting that had been half-motivated at the possibility of seeing Beatriz somewhere inside Flattery’s compound. Crista had whispered, Help me, that day, and while swimming in her green-eyed gaze he’d said, simply, Yes.\n\nIn her head sleeps the Great Wisdom, he thought. If she can unlock it without destroying herself, she can help us all.\n\nEven if it wasn’t true, Ben knew that Flattery thought it was true, and that was good enough. She rolled over, still asleep, and turned her face up at the prospect of the dim light.\n\nKeep you away from light, they say, he thought. Keep you away from kelp, keep you away from the sea. Don’t touch you. In his back pocket he carried the precautionary instructions in case he accidentally touched her bare skin.\n\nAnd what would Operations think if they knew I’d kissed her? He chuckled, and marveled at the power beside him in that room.\n\nThe Director had already seen to it that no interview of Crista Galli would ever be aired. Now, at Flattery’s direction, HoloVision had lured Beatriz with an extra hour of air time a week glorifying Flattery’s Project Voidship.\n\nBeatriz is running blind, he thought. She loves the idea of exploring the void so much that she’s ignored the price that Flattery’s exacting.\n\nFlattery’s fear of Crista’s relationship with the kelp had kept her under guard. The Director sequestered her for her own protection, for study, for the safety of all humankind. Despite weekly access to Flattery’s private compound, Beatriz showed no interest in Crista Galli. She lobbied his support, however, when Ben had requested the interviews.\n\nMaybe she hoped to see more of me, too.\n\nBeatriz was wedded to her career, just as Ben was, and something as nebulous as a career made pretty intangible competition. Ben couldn’t understand how Beatriz let the Crista Galli story slip through her fingers. Today he was very happy that she had.\n\nChapter 3\n\nFire smolders in a soul more surely than it does under ashes.\n\n—Gaston Bachelard, The Psychoanalysis of Fire\n\nKalan woke up from his nestling spot between his mother’s large breasts to loud curses and a scuffle a few meters down The Line. The chime overhead tolled five, the same as his fingers, same as his years. He did not look in the direction of the scuffle because his mother told him it was bad luck to look at people having bad luck. A pair of line patrolmen appeared with their clubs. There were the thudding noises again and the morning quieted down.\n\nHe and his warm mother stayed wrapped in her drape, the same one that had shaded them the day before. This morning, at the chime of five, they had been in The Line for seventeen hours. His mother warned him how long it would be. At noon the previous day Kalan had looked forward to seeing the inside of the food place but after everything he’d seen in The Line he just wanted to go home.\n\nThey had slept the last few hours at the very gates of the food place. Now he heard footsteps behind the gates, the metallic unclick of locks.\n\nHis mother brushed off their clothes and gathered all of their containers. He already wore the pack she’d made him, he hadn’t taken it off since they turned in their scrap. Kalan wanted to be ready when she negotiated rice, because carrying the rice back home was his job. They had made it right up to the warehouse door at midnight, then had it locked in their faces. His mother helped him read the sign at the door: Closed for cleaning and restocking 12–5. He wanted to start his job carrying the rice now so he could be going home.\n\nNot yet. His mother tugged his shirttail to restrain him. They’re not ready. They’d just beat us back.\n\nAn older woman behind Kalan clucked her tongue and collected a breath on an inward hiss.\n\nLook there, she whispered, and lifted a bony finger to point at the figure of a man trotting down the street. He looked backward toward the docks more than forward, so he stumbled a lot, and he ran with his hands over his ears. As he ran by he crouched, wild-eyed, as though everyone in The Line would eat him. As two of the security moved to cross the street, the short young man skittered away down the street uttering frightened, out-of-breath cries that Kalan didn’t understand.\n\nDriftninny, the old woman said. One of those family islands must’ve grounded. It’s hardest for them. She raised her reedy voice to lecture pitch: The unfathomable wrath of Ship will strike the infidel Flattery.…\n\nShaddup! a security barked, and she muttered herself to silence.\n\nThen there arose in The Line a grumbled discussion of the difficulties of adjustment, the same kind of talk that Kalan had heard muttered around the home fire when they first settled here from the sea. He didn’t remember the sea at all, but his mother told him stories about how beautiful their little island was, and she named all the generations that had drifted their island before Kalan was born.\n\nThe Line woke up and stretched and passed the word back in a serpentine ripple: Keys up. Hey, keys are up! Keys, sister. Keys up.\n\nHis mother stood, and leaned against the wall to balance herself as she strapped on her pack. Hey, sister!\n\nA scar-faced security reached between Kalan and his mother and tapped the side of her leg with his stick.\n\nOff the warehouse. C’mon, you know better.…\n\nShe stepped right up to his nose as she shouldered her carryall, but she didn’t speak. He did not back down. Kalan had never seen anyone who didn’t back down to his mother.\n\nFirst tickets up, alphabetical order, left to right, he said. This time he tapped his stick against her bottom. Get moving.\n\nThen they were inside a press of bodies and through the gates, into a long narrow room. Where Kalan had expected to see the food place, he saw instead a wall with a line of stalls. An attendant and a security armed with stunstick flanked each stall, and out of each one jutted what he thought must be the nose or tongue of some great demon.\n\nHis mother hurried him and their things to the farthest stall.\n\nThose are conveyer belts, she explained. They go way back into the building and bring out our order to us and they drop it here. We give our order and our coupons to this woman and someone inside fetches it for us.\n\nBut I thought we could go inside.\n\nI can’t take you inside, she said. Some things we can get on the way home when the market opens. I’ll take you around to see all the booths and vendors.…\n\nOrder.\n\nHis mother handed the list to the guard, who handed it to the attendant. The attendant had only one eye, and she had to hold the list close to her face to read it. Slowly, she crossed off certain items. Kalan couldn’t see which ones. He couldn’t read"
