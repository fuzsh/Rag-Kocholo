        "text": "Last year I read the wonderful Miss Peregrine’s Home For Peculiar Children by Ransom Riggs and really enjoyed it. It stood out amongst other books due to its presentation of the story, black & white photos and hand-written letters dotted throughout the book as if it was a photo album or scrap book. So when PGUK asked if I’d be interested in joining a Ransom Riggs blog tour, I jumped at the chance to interview the author…….\n\nI loved the way the photos were used in Miss Peregrine’s Home For Peculiar Children. They gave the book that extra something special. Did the photos inspire the story or were they a later addition?\n\nThanks! The pictures came first. I started finding old photos at swap meets and flea markets a few years ago, and pretty soon my collecting hobby became an obsession. As interesting as the photos and the people in them were, they were anonymous, and I didn’t know anything about their stories – so I made them up! In addition to flea markets and such, I also made contact with a number of other collectors who’d been amassing old photos for much longer than I had, and when I told them about my project they generously let me paw through their voluminous collections looking for “peculiar” stuff.\n\nWhat it is it you liked about Wales that made you base the majority of Miss Peregrine’s Home for Peculiar Children on a remote Welsh island rather than somewhere in the US?\n\nEhh, there’s nothing magical-seeming or exotic about the US – at least, not to someone who was born here. Britain just seems like a place where magical things happen with more frequency than the states. And I couldn’t set it in Scotland, because that’s where Harry Potter lives, and Wales is somewhere Americans are aware of as a place, but know little about, so it seemed like a “blank spot” on our collective map (King Arthur notwithstanding) where I could invent my own little mythology.\n\nGetting published with a good publisher isn’t easy, how did you land your first book deal?\n\nIt was easy, actually: they approached me! I didn’t even have an agent. I’d been blogging for mentalfloss.com, and the mental floss people and the quirk books people were acquainted and traded writers sometimes, and my name got mentioned at the right secret cocktail party, or something, and Quirk one day asked me if I’d be interested in writing a book about the history of goth culture. I thought that was a bit weird, because I’m about the furthest thing from a goth, but we moved on to a book about Sherlock Holmes instead, which I wrote, and that was the beginning of a long and fruitful working relationship.\n\nIf you were one of the Peculiar Children, what would be your “special” talent?\n\nThe way I see it, most of the peculiar children’s powers, if you want to call them that, have a dark side – they’re both a blessing and a curse. So, honestly, I’m happy to be normal! But now that you mention it, I’ve been thinking lately that it would be nice – this is geeky, I know – to be able to take pictures with my eyes just by blinking. Because I’m always seeing things I think would make great photographs and wishing I had my camera with me. I know that’s not a great power, but it’d be really convenient.\n\nGreat minds think alike! I’ve always thought it would be fantastic to take pictures just by blinking.\n\nI hear you have an unusual hobby (relating to photos)?\n\nYes: I collect them! Found photos, that is – meaning, mostly, old family photos that have been orphaned and separated from their owners and are usually 50+ years old.\n\nSo what else do you get up to when you’re not writing wonderful books like Miss Peregrine’s Home For Peculiar Children?\n\nI make videos and short films (I went to film school), I play a little guitar, I pretend I know the difference between cheap whiskey and good whiskey, I travel as much as I can, to the weirdest places I can (usually the desert, since I live in Los Angeles), I take photos, I collect photos, and, er … answer Q&As? A lot of things!\n\nWhen you get time to read, what authors or genres do you go for?\n\nA lot of nonfiction, actually. I love history books and memoirs. Bill Bryson always makes me laugh. I’ve been trying to bone up on my Lovecraft lately. I love Cormac McCarthy’s novels. I’ve been reading a lot of YA recently, as well, since I am now apparently a YA author – I didn’t mean to write a YA novel, but that’s where Barnes and Noble shelved it! And I really like what I’ve been reading (let’s see: Anna and the French kiss by Stephanie Perkins, A Monster Calls by Patrick Ness, anything by John Green (an old college friend of mine), and I can’t wait to dive into some Libba Bray, who I recently met at a book festival and who might be the world’s funniest human).\n\nI believe a second ‘Peculiar’ book will be released next year. Can you tell us anything about it?\n\nThis is true. I can tell you this: much of it takes place in London. It is action-packed. And I have so many cool, creepy photos now that I hardly know what to do with them all. The book is stuffed with them. I hope everyone enjoys it!\n\nMany thanks for your time, Ransom. It was a joy to read Miss Peregrine’s Home For Peculiar Children and I look forward to reading the next one.\n\n——————————-\n\nWIN A COPY OF MISS PEREGRINE’S HOME FOR PECULIAR CHILDREN BY RANSOM RIGGS\n\nClosing date: Friday, 18th May 2012 at 5pm – CLOSED\n\nUK readers only.\n\nTo be in with a chance of winning a copy of Miss Peregrine’s Home For Peculiar Children by Ransom Riggs all you have to do is leave a comment on this interview and answer the following question…\n\n- If you were one of the ‘Peculiar’ children in Ransom’s book, what would your ‘special’ talent be?\n\nEntries are open until 5pm on Friday, 18th May 2012 and a winner will be selected at random. Apologies to international readers, but this giveaway is only open to UK readers.\n\nMany thanks to Quirk Books for providing the prize.\n\nGood luck!"
