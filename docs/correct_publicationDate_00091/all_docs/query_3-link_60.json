        "text": "Don’t forget to tip your mayor\n\nPop quiz: What is it typically called when someone gives money to a public official in return for a government contract or approval for a building permit or other application.\n\nAnswer: An illegal bribe.\n\nWhat would you call it if the same person handed the same sum to the same official, but waited until after the decision was made in his or her favor?\n\nHow about an illegal kickback?\n\nNo, the Supreme Court said in a 6-3 ruling sure to warm the hearts of grifters everywhere. That was a lawful gift, a gratuity so to speak.\n\nThe court, in an end-of-term decision that went largely overlooked as the justices planted roadblocks in the road to accountability for Donald Trump, threw out the conviction of a former Indiana mayor who accepted $13,000 from a company after it received a lucrative contract for the purchase of garbage trucks.\n\nIt seems, per Justice Brett Kavanaugh’s majority decision, that federal law doesn’t make it adequately clear that a payment that would unequivocally be illegal prior to a decision still is illegal afterward.\n\nThe ruling didn’t specify whether the same principle applies to judges and jurors.\n\nLet’s hope Congress defuses this bomb before tip jars become a fixture on the dais at public meetings.\n\nLawmakers target pay-to-play reform\n\nIn May, we told you about legislation in Sacramento to take some teeth out of a state law targeting “pay to play” politics in local government. County supervisors, city council members and other local officials are required to recuse themselves from voting for one year on any matters involving campaign contributors who donate more than $250.\n\nThe law, which passed without a single dissenting vote in 2022, was intended to prevent not just corruption but the appearance of a conflict of interest, thereby buttressing public confidence in local government. This year, two bills have been introduced in Sacramento to substantially raise the threshold.\n\nOne of those measures, AB 2911 by Assemblywoman Tina McKinnor, D-Hawthorne, would have increased it sixfold to $1,500. That bill was held in the Senate elections committee last week. But SB 1243 by Sen. Bill Dodd, D-Napa, is still alive. Dodd’s bill would raise the threshold to $1,000 before elected officials were required to recuse themselves.\n\nAs we noted in our prior editorial, $1,000 might be a reasonable amount in Los Angeles or other large cities, but it’s too high for most jurisdictions. If a change is necessary, Dodd should pursue a tiered system that distinguishes between large, medium and small jurisdictions. SB 1243 bill has passed the Senate and is awaiting a vote on the Assembly floor after the summer recess. It isn’t too late to fix this bill — or to withdraw it from consideration."
