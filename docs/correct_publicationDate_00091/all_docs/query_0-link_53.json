His latest book from WordFire Press, Brother Blood Sister Death, introduces twin hybrid vampires with serious sibling issues. Release date: January 29, 2020. His current project is a sequence of short stories.\n\nBill’s science fiction/speculative fiction titles include Jaguar, Burn, and Viravax, and he co-authored (with Frank Herbert) the three novels of the Pandora Sequence: The Jesus Incident, The Lazarus Effect, The Ascension Factor.\n\nThe Pandora Sequence omnibus edition offers introductions to each novel that reveal the stories behind the collaborative writing of these stories.\n\nHis Learning the Ropes (Utah State University Press), a hybrid collection of poetry, short fiction and essays, was billed as “a creative autobiography.” Three of Bill’s short stories from this collection have been selections of the PEN/NEA Syndicated Fiction Project, often called “The Pulitzer Prize of the Short Story”: “Uncle Hungry,” “What Elena Said” and “Learning the Ropes.” These appeared in the Sunday magazine editions of major U.S. newspapers; circulation, ten million. “The Liberation of Father Free” appeared in Raven Chronicles, Manoa and the northwest anthology, Stealing Light.\n\nBill’s most recent poetry collection, The Woman and the War Baby, was published in 2008 by Blue Begonia Press. His poetry has been nominated for both the Pulitzer Prize and the National Book Award (Finding True North & Critter, Copper Canyon Press, 1973). Twice he was awarded residencies at Centrum, an arts foundation in Port Townsend, WA.\n\nHis poetry appears in anthologies and literary magazines, such as: Puerto del Sol, Conversations Across Borders, Weathered Pages, Oregon Literary Review, Portland Review, Seattle Review, Prairie Schooner and New Poets of the American West."
