Both Wes Moore’s grew up in rough neighborhoods in Baltimore, exposed to drug abuse, poverty, violence, and death. They both were fatherless, struggled with education and ran into some trouble with the law. Although, as similar as their lives were what separated Wes Moore and the other Wes Moore in the end, were the decisions made that impacted their future.

Charlotte from “The Metaphor” by Budge Wilson and the Mother character from “Borders” by Thomas King live very different lives but the way they deal with the problems they are faced with is very similar. Both protagonists have to deal with trying to be forced to be something they are not by society and their families, but Charlotte from “The Metaphor” has been challenged by her strenuous home, she must face her organized mother and orderly home; the Mother from “Borders” must stand up for what she believes in and fight for what she wants.\n\nSimiliaries and Differences in Characters in The Outsiders by S. E. Hinton\n\n1051 Words | 3 Pages\n\nTwo people with two completely different characteristics have something alike. Both Dally and Johnny are mentally tough because of their parents. Johnny and Dally’s parents both do not care for them and could care less about them. For example, during Dally’s childhood he went to jail, been in a gang, and has been in many fights and his dad still would not care for him even if he won the lottery. Dally also talks about his dad's disgrace towards him in the car with Johnny and Ponyboy, “‘ Shoot, my dad don’t give a hang whether I’m in jail or dead in a car wreck or drunk in a gutter...’”(88). Dally could easily live without his dad and he does for the most part. Dally just hangs around with his friends and stays at their place. Similarly, Johnny's parents use him like a rag doll to blow off steam, “his father always beating him up”(14). The gang knows what happenes in Johnny’s house. Once Ponyboy was witnessing, “Johnny take a whipping with a two-by-four from his old man”(33).

Although Wes didn’t know his father for long, the two memories he had of him and the endless stories his mother would share with him, helped guide him through the right path. His mother, made one of the biggest effects in Wes’s life when she decided to send him to military story, after seeing he was going down the wrong path. Perhaps, the other Wes’s mother tried her best to make sure he grew up to be a good person, but unfortunately Wes never listen. His brother, Tony was a drug dealer who wish he could go back in time and make the right decisions and he wanted Wes to be different than him. He didn’t want his brother to end up like him and even after he tried everything to keep Wes away from drugs, nothing worked and he gave up. As you can see, both families are very different, Wes (the author) has a family who wants him to have a bright future. Most importantly, a family who responds fast because right after his mother saw him falling down the wrong hill she didn’t hesitate to do something about it. The other Wes isn’t as lucky, as I believe since his mother already had so much pressure over keeping her job and her son Tony being involved in drugs. Same thing with Tony, he was so caught up in his own business that no one payed so much attention to\n\nYoung and Innocent Views\n\n658 Words | 2 Pages\n\nBoth have many similar characterizations, mostly they revolve around there innocent tendencies towards their view of the world and what it brings to them.

Micah was raised in the streets and therefore has developed a wild, self-sufficient manner unlike Henri who has only ever known the sheltered but strict life of the Abbey and is very introverted and well mannered. However as the story progresses similar traits between the two boys are uncovered and they both start to lose features of their personality that at first made them seem so different from one another. This shows that the two boys who at first appear to be polar opposites are actually remarkably similar, and only differenced in background which provides opportunity"
