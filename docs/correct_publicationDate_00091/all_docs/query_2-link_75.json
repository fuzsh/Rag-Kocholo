        "text": "Background (if you’re interested)\n\nYesterday I wrapped up my first reading of Frank Herbert’s The Jesus Incident, which, unsurprisingly, had very little to do with Jesus. This book centered on a hostile alien planet aptly named Pandora, where a recently-sentient voidShip takes on the role of God to its crew which it had transported from an Earth on the verge of destruction by supernova. Like the Abrahamic texts from which Herbert sometimes quotes at the start of select chapters, God is testing people to become their best selves through a terrible and vague challenge to worShip satisfactorily.\n\nI love when authors create religions, I’m making a note that I need to write a post about the utility of religion in scifi. The Jesus Incident contains conflict between humans and the native flora and fauna of Pandora, between humans and humans, and between humans and Ship. Is the theme of human conflict with other selves evident yet? In my next piece, I’ll attempt to use this book as an argument against conflict (oh, the hypocrisy!) by outlining the final paradox that I saw in the book.\n\nSo, let’s dive in to some of the ideas I’ve fleshed out a bit and see where things go from there. As will be the norm, you are welcome to comment and I’ll do my best to respond thoughtfully.\n\nParadox of Individuality\n\nIt is through the other that the Self is known. And where there is only one, there is nothing else. From the nothing else comes no reflection of Self, nothing returns.\n\n-Theriex to the clones, Frank Herbert, The Jesus Incident\n\nIndividuality. The idea itself is defined by uniqueness and separateness from others. Many people find their identities in being as individualistic as possible. In the United States, it seems a pervasive part of culture. I am who I am, you are who you are.\n\nI’m not well enough versed to do more than suspect that our desire for ownership in some way is related to our desire to own our selves. The best way to own one’s self is to first define one’s self so one knows what exactly it is that one owns. There’s, that’s established.\n\nIn Orson Scott Card’s Wyrms, we’re told,\n\nThere is nothing but empty space between the infinitesimal pieces of matter; the only thing connecting them is their behavior, their influence on each other, and yet out of those empty, invisible connections is build all that exists in the universe. Most of it empty, the web insensible. Yet if for a single moment the web broke down, everything would flash out of existence. Do you think it’s different for us? … Do you think that you can ever serve your own interest without also serving them?\n\n-Heptarch to Patience, Orson Scott Card, Wyrms\n\nWe’re tangled in a web. Where is the self?\n\nThe Jesus Incident challenges the reader thematically toward the last 1/3 of the novel: ‘how do we define our selves?’ and answers that for us, that self, as words of a language, as atoms and molecules, are defined by references to all else – self to other selves, words to words, atoms to atoms. In Wyrms, the Heptarch says that everything exists in relation to all else, and The Jesus Incident‘s Theriex echos this in the first quote presented by this post.\n\nThe better we define our selves, to create ourselves as more pronounced individuals (let’s acknowledge that defining requires pronouncing, and the root of the word “thing” in many languages is related to the word “say,” thus we cannot have an individual without defining it), the more sharply we contrast ourselves with the world, shouting, “I am me, different from all the rest! Bleeblorptrinnigett! There, nobody’s said THAT before!”\n\nThe more starkly we contrast with all else that is we see as not us, the more separated we become, and some might say that the more individualistic we become.\n\nThe paradox is before us: As an individual moves toward complete individuality, it becomes more distinguished from others. The more distinguished it becomes, the more removed from the others it becomes. When the individual is fully distinguished, it both becomes the ultimate individual, and also looses all identity, becoming no individual at all.\n\nAn individual/agent without connection/reference to anything else has no way in which to define itself, and we cannot define something with which we have no connection. To summarize: The ultimate individual is unknown to itself and has no identity and so isn’t an individual at all. Our only hope to define the individual is by its connections to others.\n\nParadox of Community\n\nWhen you know all that otherhumans know, and otherhumans know all of you, then you are human.\n\n-Avata to Weala, Frank Herbert, The Jesus Incident\n\nSince the word “human” above is a bit out of our cultural understanding of human, let me share my view. I see Herbert’s usage of “human” here to mean a singular human self. A human organism that is the only one of its species, and made up of a great many bodies. Almost like the Formics (Buggers) of Ender’s Game, but without a queen to lead the hive-mind.\n\nThe paradox? Let’s first define community. A community is a collection of individuals which share characteristics in common.\n\nThe paradox may be already glaringly obvious: As a community moves toward communal fidelity – that is to say, complete community, it aligns its individuals’ characteristics toward a singularity of self. When the alignment is complete and true community is achieved, the community ceases to exist and becomes an individual.\n\nAll thoughts, all goals, all actions are shared intracommunity, so it, being no longer made of individuals, becomes an individual. To sum: A community that fully actualizes its potential for community becomes an individual.\n\nYou may be now holding both paradoxes presented in your mind and thinking, “But then if that community becomes a true individual, it will also cease to be!”\n\nYes. Fortunately, nobody we know has found a way to fully isolate anything at all, even something a small as an electron (or have they, wouldn’t it vanish with no evidence of where it went?). The community, now an individual, may go forward through time to align characteristics with other agents around it, thus becoming a larger community (like an ecosystem). When that larger community behaves as an individual, it will be a different individual than the individual/community from the past.\n\nI wonder if this is a trend of life at large. In such a view, we are all connected and moving toward synthesis with all other agents to grow the self that is (at least) all life.\n\nConclusion\n\nIndividualism fully realized is the extermination of self.\n\nCommunity fully realized is the conversion of community into individual.\n\nI personally find these very funny. At the expense of explaining the joke and thus condemning it to die, I think what’s funny is that at least in these concepts, when they become fully realized, they collapse into another thing entirely (oftentimes, becoming something that’s an oxymoron to the original intention). All the effort, love, pain, joy, time that we invest into one of these goals… and we get to the destination to only find that the destination cannot exist.\n\nThere was 1 last paradox that I learned in this book, related to the ultimate futility of selfishness, but that will have to wait for PART II posted within the week.\n\nThanks for reading! Until next time, pleasant scifying!"
