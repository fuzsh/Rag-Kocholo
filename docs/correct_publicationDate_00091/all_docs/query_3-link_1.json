        "text": "Ransom, Bill\n\nEntry updated 12 September 2022. Tagged: Author.\n\n(1945- ) US author who has worked as a medic and as a firefighter. His early writing was poetry, with several volumes released from Finding True North & Critter (coll 1974 chap) onward. He began publishing sf anonymously with \"Songs of a Sentient Flute\" in Analog for February 1979, a collaboration with Frank Herbert published as by Herbert alone: Ransom wrote the first draft at Herbert's request, as related in Brian Herbert's Dreamer of Dune: The Biography of Frank Herbert (2003). Substantially revised, the story eventually became part of Medea: Harlan's World (anth 1985) edited by Harlan Ellison. Ransom is best known for the related Pandora sequence, also with Frank Herbert (whom see for details), sequelling the latter's Destination: Void (August 1965 Galaxy as \"Do I Wake Or Dream?\"; 1966; rev 1978). This series comprises The Jesus Incident (1979) – based on \"Songs of a Sentient Flute\" – The Lazarus Effect (1983) and The Ascension Factor (1988).\n\nRansom's first solo novel, Jaguar (part 1983 Kansas City Star; and elsewhere; fixup 1990), is also of interest for its depiction of the physically, psychologically and morally complex dream-driven pattern of connections between Earth and another planet, each planet containing two maturing adolescents whose sleep disorders allow them to make journeys between the worlds. The Jaguar – a disturbed World War Two vet who likewise roams the dreamways – must be halted before he disrupts the fragile tissues of reality. Slightly overweighted for the adventure-sf idiom in which it is told, Jaguar is all the same an intriguing attempt to say more than could easily be said, and to suggest Ecological reasons for self-restraint. The later ViraVax sequence beginning with ViraVax (1993) follows a similar procedure: an impressive presentation of the complex perils that inevitably accompany in-depth virological research (see Genetic Engineering) is conveyed through a Near Future storyline which focuses upon a suspenseful thriller-like action plot, here accompanied by strong images of body horror (see Horror in SF); in the sequel, Burn (1995), an apocalyptic cult has stolen the deadly virus, and threatens to unleash a Pandemic upon the world. The world is saved.
