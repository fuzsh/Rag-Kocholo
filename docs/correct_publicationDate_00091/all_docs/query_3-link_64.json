Whether you're a seasoned player or just dipping your toes into the world of tabletop gaming, now's the perfect time to expand your collection or bring home some new favorites.\n\nWhether you're looking for party games to liven up your gatherings, cooperative adventures to tackle with friends, or brain-teasing puzzles to challenge your mind, there's something for every type of player during Prime Day 2024. To help you navigate the selection of discounted board games, we've gathered some of the best deals available. Below, find our top board game picks for Amazon Prime Day 2024.\n\n'Catan': $37 ($23 off)\n\n\"Catan\" might take some time to get used to, but you'll be so satisfied that you did. Sometimes the more complex games make for the most interesting experiences, and this one certainly ticks those boxes.\n\nYou're on a mission to settle the Isle of Catan as you use resources to develop the land, build settlements, cities and more. It's an intensely complex strategy game, but that's what makes it so much fun.\n\nIt's also on sale for an extremely low price at Amazon for Prime Day. It's just $37, which is $23 off its normal price of $60.\n\nBe sure and grab \"Catan\" before it goes back up outside of this week's sales event, because you don't want to miss this one. Especially if you have a large family looking for a lengthy and complex game.\n\n'Ticket to Ride': $37 ($18 off)\n\nThis extremely popular strategy game has you exploring all of North America as you make your way through the 20th-century United States and create train routes by placing cards.\n\nCollect enough train cards and claim your own railway routes, earn more points by laying down longer routes, and see who can build the longest railway. If you or someone in your family loves trains, they'll be especially enamored with this game.\n\nYou can get \"Ticket to Ride\" right now at Amazon for just $37, which is $18 less than its normal price of $55.\n\n'Monopoly Deal': $8 ($6 off)\n\nIf traditional Monopoly games take too long, try this card game version instead that can get you going in just 15 minutes. It has you collecting property sets while dodging cards representing debt collectors, forced deals, and deal breakers meant to destroy your business empire.\n\nOnce you've collected all three sets of different property colors, you can claim victory. No messy setup with hotels, tokens, money, or anything else to be lost - just play on the go with simple to understand rules and fast-paced turns.\n\nYou can snag \"Monopoly Deal\" for just $8, which is $6 off its usual price for Prime Day.\n\n'Sorry!': $15 ($6 off)\n\nSometimes you have to go back to the classics for a great game night.

Anyone can be sent back to the beginning of their path at any time.\n\n\"Sorry\" has been around for years, and it's all about planning for the right path to get to home base. Once you've gotten your game piece there first, you're good to go. Whether you grew up playing this game or you're introducing it to your children, it's well worth revisiting.\n\nYou can grab \"Sorry!\" now for just $15, which is $6 off as part of Prime Day.\n\n'Mantis': $12 ($8 off)\n\nThis colorful card game from the creators of \"Exploding Kittens\" is all about stealing or scoring. Collect matching sets of cards and take them from your opponents, too.\n\nOnce you're the first player to get 10 or more cards in your score pile, you win - but to get there, you've got to strategize about how best to steal and wheel and deal. Gameplay is fast, appropriate for the whole family, and especially good for busting boredom.\n\nYou can snag \"Mantis\" right now for just $12 during Prime Day, which is $8 off its normal price.\n\n\"Exploding Kittens: Recipes for Disaster\": $17 ($8 off)\n\nThis \"Exploding Kittens\" spinoff lets you take some of the best cards from the original game for silly, remixed fun. It's all about figuring out new ways to play, with 13 recipe booklets included to help facilitate that.\n\nThe base card game is quite simple to learn and understand, with 121 of the original game's most popular cards included. It also has a wearable cone of shame included with it so you can really get into character.\n\nGet this remixed card game for just $17 during Prime Day, which is $8 off its normal price.\n\n\"Throw Throw Burrito\": $17 ($8 off)\n\nIf you've ever played dodgeball or like having fun with plush toys, this is a card game that's for you. Collect matching sets of cards quicker than the other players, and then duck and dodge the squishy burrito toys included.\n\nYou earn points as you collect cards but lose them again if you happen to get hit by a flying burrito. It's a knock-down, drag-out battle that you'll have to engage in if you want to emerge victorious. It'll certainly keep you on your toes.\n\nRight now, you can get this unpredictable game for just $17, which is $8 off its original price during the Prime Day sales event.\n\n\"ThinkFun Gravity Maze Marble Run\": $18 ($14 off)\n\nThis STEM game is all about completing logic challenges with marbles. It has 60 puzzles to solve with increasing difficulty. It's perfect for players of any ages and it's more than just a game, it's a way for your kids to learn more about spatial and logical reasoning.\n\nIt's also quite aesthetically pleasing with the brightly colored clear marble cubes and shiny marbles.\n\nYou can get this marble-centric game for just $18 during Prime Day, which is $14 off its normal price.\n\n\"Azul\": $29 (save 28%)\n\nDesigned by award-winning game creator Michael Riesling, \"Azul\" involves Moorish art with challenging game mechanics. Players work to decorate the walls of the Palace of Dvora with certain tiles, including the beautiful \"azulejos.\"\n\nIt's your challenge to design the palace walls using particular blue and white ceramic tiles as you complete the display board and earn points.\n\nGrab this creative board game during Prime Day for just $29.\n\n\"What Do You Meme? Family Edition\": $13 ($7 off)\n\nIf you love memes and making jokes, \"What Do You Meme? Family Edition\" is the perfect combination of sly and funny. Compete with other players to make the funniest combinations of memes.\n\nTake turns drawing cards and match captions with images to make fun reaction memes. The winner of each round is decided by a rotating judge each turn, with the funniest creation winning points. The team who wins the most takes the victory!\n\nYou can get \"What Do You Meme? Family Edition\" for just $13 during the Prime Day sale, which is $7 off its normal price.\n\n\"Yeti in My Spaghetti\": $12 ($6 off)\n\nThis wacky game with a silly name is exactly what it sounds like. A yeti figure is relaxing on top of a bowl of spaghetti. Players take turn removing spaghetti noodles until the yeti is close to falling.\n\nApparently as much as yetis apparently like the noodles, they don't need to actually fall into the bowl. If the yeti falls into the spaghetti, it's game over. So you need to try to keep it out, much like the marble game \"Kerplunk,\" to the best of your ability.\n\nThis fun little family game is just $12 during Prime Day, which is $6 off its normal price."
