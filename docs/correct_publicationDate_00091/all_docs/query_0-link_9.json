        "text": "Frank Herbert (1920-1986), winner of the Hugo and Nebula awards and a #1 New York Times bestselling author, was born in Tacoma, Washington, and worked as a reporter and later as an editor for a number of West Coast newspapers before becoming a full-time writer. His first science fiction story was published in 1952, but he achieved fame more than ten years later with the publication of \"Dune World\" and \"The Prophet of Dune\" in Analog. The stories were amalgamated in the bestselling novel Dune in 1965."
