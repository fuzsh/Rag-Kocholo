        "text": "About the Author[]\n\nGenre: Science Fiction\n\nWriting Style:\n\nBooks: Frank Herbert Books\n\nBiography[]\n\nFrank Herbert was an American author, and the creator of the Dune novels and its vast fictional universe.\n\nHerbert was born in Tacoma, Washington in 1920. From an early age he had literary ambitions, and worked as a journalist and a photographer before pursuing a career as a writer. His early work consisted of short science-fiction stories.\n\nIn 1959 he began research for his novel Dune, which he completed in 1965. As with his earlier work, he extended his science-fiction writing beyond the superficial predictions and plots that were common at the time, and adopted complex psychological, social and environmental themes that resulted in greater depth and subtlety.\n\nIn Dune and its sequels - and indeed in most of his novels - Herbert explored numerous themes: politics, the power of love, facets of conflict, human survival, lessons from history, the power of genetics, the complexity of human relationships, and the family, to name but a few. Perhaps the most pervasive theme in the Dune series, was the optimistic view of human potential. In the various schools in the Dune universe, i.e., the Bene Gesserit, the Suk School, the Spacing Guild, the Mentats, each represented explorations of hitherto untapped human potential, and taking it to its logical, if fantastical, conclusion.\n\nFrank Herbert died of pancreatic cancer in Madison, Wisconsin, on February 11, 1986. He was survived by his son Brian Herbert.\n\nSeries[]\n\nDune series[]\n\nGenres: Sci Fi Colonization, Diaspora\n\nTheme: A mix between Sci Fi and Epic Fantasy\n\nCo-Authors: Kevin J.
