Putnam's Sons, 1979.\n\nFirst edition of the second novel set in the Destination: Void universe by Frank Herbert and poet Bill Ransom. Octavo, original cloth. Boldly signed on the title page by both authors Frank Herbert and “For Michael, with warmest wishes Bill Ransom 4 Dec 93.” Review copy, with the original release laid in, near fine in a near fine dust jacket. Jacket illustration by Paul Alexander.\n\nThe book takes place at an indeterminate time following the events in Destination: Void. At the end of Destination: Void the crew of the ship had succeeded in creating an artificial consciousness. The new conscious being, now known as 'Ship', gains a level of awareness that allows it to manipulate space and time. Ship instantly transports itself to a planet which it has decided the crew will colonize, christening it \"Pandora\". The first book ends with a demand from Ship for the crew to learn how to WorShip or how to establish a relationship with Ship, a godlike being."
