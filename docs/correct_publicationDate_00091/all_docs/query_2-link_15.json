You will.‚Äù\n\nThe Jesus Incident ‚Äì 4 out of 5 stars\n\nWARNING ‚Äì THE FOLLOWING REVIEW HAS A MAJOR SPOILER FOR THE END OF THE BOOK DESTINATION VOID BY FRANK HERBERT.\n\nThe Jesus Incident is (strictly) the first book in the Pandora Sequence. This series is the sequel to, and follows directly on from, Destination Void although it is not actually necessary to read this book first ‚Äì I‚Äôve seen one review make a parallel between Destination Void/The Hobbit and the Pandora Sequence/Lord of the Rings series. Its a fair structural comparison.\n\nI reviewed Destination Void last week, and I hope I avoided spoilers there ‚Äì as the very short book builds to a climax where the main plot question is answered: when the crew of the Void Ship Earthling create an artificial intelligence in the ships computers, what will they create?\n\nWhilst I think the book is still enjoyable even if you know the ending, I understand that many people are sensitive about spoilers. If you don‚Äôt want to spoil this book, stop reading here.\n\n‚Ä¶\n\nI‚Äôll give you a few lines of space to go away.\n\n‚Ä¶\n\nMaybe check out some different books to read. Here‚Äôs my list of planned books for the BookRiot Read Harder challenge.\n\n‚Ä¶\n\nLike classic or vintage sci-fi? Check these spoiler free reviews of Wyndham‚Äôs Seeds of Time or First Men in the Moon by H.G. Wells.\n\n‚Ä¶\n\nOr check out the reviews on Little Red Reviewer‚Äôs Vintage Science Fiction Month earlier this year.\n\n‚Ä¶\n\nOr much of the stuff on Couch to Moon; Battered, Tattered, Yellowed & Creased; or Science Fiction and Other Suspect Ruminations.\n\n‚Ä¶\n\nOk, if you are still here, then I guess you‚Äôve read it, or won‚Äôt read it, or are ok with spoilers.\n\nSynopsis\n\nWhen the crew created the artificial intelligence in the ships computers, they created God ‚Äì or at least an incredibly powerful intelligence that thinks that it is God. Destination Void ends with the ship instantly taking them across space and time to their programed destination (Tau Ceti), creating a livable planet (where one did not exist before), and demanding they now turn their mind to how humanity will now WorShip.\n\nSee ‚Äì spoilers. üòõ\n\nAlso I LOVE the term WorShip.\n\nThis is important to know, as we start The Jesus Incident with Ship (note the proper noun, Ship is capitalised now) retrieving Raja Flattery, the CeePee or Chaplain/Psychiatrist from Destination Void, from hibernation (Hyb) where he has been in stasis for‚Ä¶ centuries‚Ä¶ millennia‚Ä¶ aeons?\n\nShip explains to Raja that it has spent the millennia watching replay after replay of human history, following it through until each replayed Earth is about to be destroyed by a Nova, at which point Ship comes and rescues select humans from each replay. These replays differ enough that human genetics can vary significantly; by way of examples, one ‚Äòhuman‚Äô woman‚Äôs skin changes colour with mood, whilst another woman looks normal but is exceptionally strong. Ship has used these varying humans from different replays to populate itself and the planet below (Pandora). Raja is ‚Äòoriginal material‚Äô of Earth.\n\nShip tells Raja that despite so much time passing, humanity has not decided yet how it will WorShip and after playing the same replays over and over, the Ship has become‚Ä¶ bored. Raja is given a mission to accomplish on the Planet (communicate with the intelligent kelp in the ocean), and if he fails, then Ship will ‚Äòbreak the recording‚Äô (a threat that whilst not clear, doesn‚Äôt bode well for humanity).\n\nMeanwhile on Pandora, things aren‚Äôt going well. Pandora is what those in familiar with Warhammer 40k lore would call a Death Planet. Every living thing seems out the kill the humans in the most unpleasant ways possible. The current CeePee Morgan Oakes (the religious and political leader) is installed at the top of the power structure and seems to be up to something dubious with genetically modifying clones, has plans to completely destroy the kelp, and controls his spies and deputies by making them spend time in something called the Scream Room. People are starving and people are dying and everything is coming to a head‚Ä¶.\n\nYep. There‚Äôs lots going on in The Jesus Incident.\n\nReview\n\nThis is a great sci-fi book, and personally I think its almost as good as Dune. Almost.\n\nDune was a great story bound up in a gloriously crafted world and universe. Whilst the story and themes in The Jesus Incident would probably be as strong as in Dune, the setting just isn‚Äôt as interesting. Pandora, being the last outpost of humanity and isolated to a couple of small colonies seems a much narrower stage for the drama going on. There is an awful lot going on in this book, and I think it suffers from being a bit too busy. Some plot lines don‚Äôt seem as well explored, or end too soon, and other bits seem a little superfluous.\n\nDon‚Äôt get me wrong though, I loved this book ‚Äì its just a 4 star book, not a 5.\n\nMuch like Dune, Herbert (and co-author Bill Ransom) doesn‚Äôt shy away from big themes, and much like Dune, you are constantly belted around the head by them. Themes of what it means to WorShip, religious violence and not so subtle racism/clone bias are not hidden behind text and subtext. No ‚Äì characters frequently ask themselves the big questions in the traditional Herbert ‚Äòinner thought‚Äô italics ‚Äì although here the italics also serve as the Ship telepathic dialogue. I expect that some might find this annoying ‚Äì but I actually enjoy Herbert‚Äôs writing style. Indeed, I have appropriated the italic thought bubbles for my own use.\n\nAgain, I loved the characters here. Herbert seems to create these complex and believable individuals effortlessly, and there was not a single character that I felt ‚Äòwasted my time‚Äô (contrast this with Transition by Iain Banks, where I couldn‚Äôt find two interesting characters to rub together). Raja was a carry over favourite from Destination Void, but in this I felt Morgan Oakes, the power-hungry and blasphemous CeePee was the stand out villain. Delightfully awful, without being a moustache-twirling cartoon. Oakes does what he does because he believes the colony needed him ‚Äì need him to get independence from the ship (Oakes doesn‚Äôt believe Ship is God), need him to tame Pandora. His politics, his treachery are all done because they are required. Any benefits flowing to him are simply a natural consequence of him being better than everyone else.\n\nI know that Dune cops criticism for its portrayal of women, by placing them in either a subservient feudal wife/concubine role, or as the game-playing Bene Gesserit witches ‚Äì but couldn‚Äôt find the same in this book. There are women characters, who play important roles, and who are not simply ornaments or prizes for the male hero. So, I think this book does ok on that front, if this is something you worry about.\n\nA really good book, one that challenges the reader with complex and powerful themes. Arguably a bit too busy, but still worth your time seeking out.\n\nCheers\n\nKT"
