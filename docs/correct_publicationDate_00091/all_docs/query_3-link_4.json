        "text": "June 15, 2014\n\nNot a bad book overall, but it took a *long* while to get truly interesting. I was ready to write it off, but around chapter 20-21, it finally started to show some promise. At that point, I decided to finish the book, and to be honest, I'm glad I did. It turned out to be a lot more interesting than I'd possibly hoped at first. Glad to see it ramped up there. Overall, a good read, but extremely slow to get going. If you don't mind a slow start, or if you can struggle through the start, and well into the midpoint, you'll likely come away with a decent experience. However, if you're the type that hates build-up, or doesn't like to wait for half the book before things start to come to a head, then you'll want to give this one a pass.\n\nJune 23, 2015\n\nWarning: Read this book first before going on to the sequel (Burn). The story actually gets a bit better in the sequel, as it's more fast-paced, but it will make no sense unless you first read this book.\n\nViravax is an interesting premise, but a largely unsatisfying book to the reader. It masquerades as a near-future techno-thriller, but has a plodding pace that cancels out virtually all of the thrills. The tension throughout the book is quite thick, but not enough on its own to salvage the novel. In the book, a religion (which seems to have some similarities to a few of the beliefs of Seventh Day Adventists) has become a world superpower through its business wealth and scientific research. They have a secretive lab in which they study tailor-made viruses, and they perhaps even have an agenda to take over the world...\n\nOne main issue I had with this book (and to a lesser extent, the sequel Burn), is that some action takes place offstage. Between chapters, the reader is jarred by the passage of an unknown period of time, during which certain events have occurred. And the reader has to discover what those events might have been through the drawn out pontifications of whichever character is featured in the current chapter.\n\nAnd there are too many characters. Not too many for the storyline, and not too many for the reader to keep sorted out. But way too many when you have to get stuck in their head and listen to their thoughts, over and over as they mull things about. Not everybody thinks in linear fashions, either, so the narrative within a chapter jumps around as a character explores recent events (that you missed, so the action is told to you instead of being shown to you), and then his thoughts wander as he recalls earlier events that you didn't know about previously, either. It allows the author to build really well developed characters, but it also bores the reader to tears.\n\nGive me a book that doesn't require me to spend chapters and chapters in the heads of multiple characters, and instead lets me watch the action, and I'm happier.\n\nChoppy, disjointed, and ultimately largely boring, this book is a bit of clunker right up to the end, where the plot suddenly wraps up so neatly and so quickly that the reader is left frustrated.\n\nThe frustation is eased somewhat by the knowledge that there is a sequel, and thus the abrupt denouement of the 1st book is in fact a mere preparation for the real action that takes place afterwards.\n\nAnd if you are curious about that, then you'll have to check out the sequel, Burn, which is a bit better, but completely uncomprehensible unless you read this book first."
