        "text": "This is the part where I was going to tell you what happened, how those torturous two days were for us, and the many long days that followed. But it’s not my story to tell. It’s hers one day when she’s ready. I will tell you that she’s the bravest person I know (and my husband runs into burning buildings for a living), and her strength and resilience are nothing short of remarkable.\n\nAt sentencing today, the judge ruled that Craig Ross Jr. will serve 47 years to life. He will be 94 when he’s eligible for parole. That’s primarily due to our sweet niece and her courage. I’m not sure what ‘most kids’ would do in this instance, as this is something NO CHILD should ever have to endure. But I do know that she shocked family members and investigators with her ability to calmly and articulately recount every last detail, no matter how small, of what happened to her during those 47 hours, effectively building what could be considered an airtight case for the prosecution. More than a million pieces of evidence were sent to the defense, and that’s not an exaggeration.\n\nThe FBI, the New York State Police Special Operations Response Team, the forest rangers and multiple other agencies responded not only to locate her in the small camper hidden away in a trailer park, but to apprehend the monster that took it upon himself to kidnap her from her family camping trip and take her there. The special ops team that raided the camper were recently honored as the heroes they are, and they deserve those accolades and many more. Our gratitude to them is immeasurable. But she is the real hero, having not only kept herself alive during those harrowing hours but also having the remarkable ability to put him away for life so he can never harm another child ever again. SHE did that. The petite little angel who barely scrapes 5 feet tall went up against a giant scary monster – the boogeyman in the flesh – and she won. No one can ever take that away from her. Not all heroes wear capes. Mine wears a Pokémon T-shirt.\n\nCharlotte's mother, Trisha, shared this victim impact statement at today's sentencing:\n\nThere will never be a sentence that is sufficient for what you did in my daughter. You were shown leniency, not because of the people in this room but because of our laws. But that is a subject for another day.\n\nI don’t understand why people like you do the things that you do. You took something from my daughter that cannot be replaced and I will never forgive you for that. You don’t deserve forgiveness. Maybe that says something about the type of person I am, but I will deal with that when I am no longer a part of this world. Maybe it makes you feel powerful to alter someone’s life, to change who they are mentally, emotionally and physically.\n\nYou didn’t know my daughter so let me tell you about her. She loves to sing but she hates dancing. She loves snakes and all wildlife but she is afraid of ladybugs. She loves Pokémon and cats. She loves deeply and is never afraid to apologize. She is kind and cares about everyone around her, whether they are a family member, a friend or someone she just met. She is incredibly smart. Her Kindergarten teacher called her a “big thinker” because she couldn’t take anything at face value – she needed to know the how and the why.\n\nI know I said all the things that a parent is supposed to say about their child. But it’s all true. And you tried to ruin that, you took advantage of her kindness. But I want you to know that you failed. She’s stronger than what you tried to do. She wanted to come today so she could see you be punished for what you did to her. Because you didn’t change her, and though her trust is hurt right now, it will not be forever. Even after what you did to her, she was concerned for your cat and asked if you did this to her because someone did it to you when you were a kid.\n\nTHAT IS THE KIND OF PERSON MY DAUGHTER IS. She is everything that you are lacking. She is everything good in this world and you are nothing. She will make this world a better place and already has because she wasn’t afraid to tell her story and now you are no longer allowed to be a part of society. She put you here. I hope you understand that. She put you here because she was not afraid.\n\nWhen I look around this room, not only can I see the love everyone has for my daughter and my family, but I can feel it. We could never thank all of you enough for your support. When you look around, Craig Ross Jr., I hope you feel your family’s absence for the next 47 years.\n\nMedia, when we are in this court room today, the lawyers will refer to my daughter as the victim. I understand this is standard court room terminology, but I ask that when you leave today and choose to report on this case as you see fit, please do not call her a victim. She is a survivor. She experienced something horrific, but she will overcome this. And she works hard every day to continue being a survivor. This horrific situation does not and will not define her."
