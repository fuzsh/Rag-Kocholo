Little Red Riding Hood’s Zombie BBQ’s eponymous heroine in a dress several sizes too small for her.

The slits on the side of her outfit are much, much too high – what would her poor, sick grandmother think? Oh, that’s right, granny has turned into a zombie along with the other fairy tale enemies in this shoot'em-up.

IGN posted five game videos not too long ago, and the “intro movie,” in particular, is worth watching. I love how it begins with spent bullet casings falling like cherry blossom leaves. The in-game clips seem slow, but I hope that’s due to the movies showing only the first stage.
