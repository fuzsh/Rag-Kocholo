        "text": "Murder mystery, Nintendo style\n\nAlthough I do review mainstream games like Fallout New Vegas and Pokemon, I like to think the goal of this site is to inform about wonderful hidden gems that most of us just haven’t played. In that light, this review is dedicated to the translation efforts of multi-talented ROM hacker Tomato and the rest of the staff at DemiForce for their pronominal translation of this forgotten Nintendo masterpiece. Wither you’ve heard vague details or know nothing of it, Famicom Detective Club Part 2 should be a game every serious Nintendo lover checks out. Why? Read on.\n\nStory\n\nAlthough the second game in the Famicom Detective Club series, The Girl in Back is actually a prequel to the first game and as such is a better place to start off with.\n\nA 15 year old orphan (player named) in search of his parents meets a private detective named Shunsuke Utsugi and develops a bond, becoming his apprentice. Only a few months later, Utsugi puts the protagonist in charge a crime scene investigation.\n\nYuko Kojima, a 15 year old highschool girl attending Ushimitsu High, has been discovered dead floating in the local river. According to Yoko’s best friend and classmate Ayumi Tachibana, the two had formed a “detective club” and were investigating mysteries across town. Prior to her death, Yoko had been investigating an eerie ghost story turned urban legend in her highschool called “The tale of the girl in back”\n\nDetermined to find Yoko’s killer, the protagonist vows to solve the case and partners with Ayumi and sets out on his task. Little does he realize the truths that lay hidden and the true scope of the mystery…\n\nGraphics\n\nFamicom Detective Club Part 2 is a menu driven adventure game from several decades ago. As such, there’s not as much eye candy as you might hope, but nevertheless the Super Famicom remake of the game looks fantastic. For the most part, the game focuses on talking heads from the shoulders up againstg backdrops of their surroundings which can be investigated for greater information. If you’ve played any of the Phoenix Wright or countless other Adventure games you’ll know exactly what to expect.\n\nAt a few key moments in the plot however, the view will expand to show much more detailed, beautiful portraits. The use of transitions makes the game almost into an interactive anime at some points! These scenes are very cinematic, almost like cutscenes you can savor by choosing to advance at your own pace.\n\nAudio\n\nFamicom Detective Club Part 2 was composed by Kenji Yamamoto, whose other works include Mike Tyson’s Punch-Out, almost every Metroid game including Super Metroid, Fusion, Zero Mission, Prime 1, 2 and 3, Mario Kart Super Circuit and most recently, Donkey Kong Country Returns.\n\nMuch of the music in Famicom Detective Club Part 2 compliments and enhances the gameplay. There are songs for every situation from somber music that plays when Ayumi expresses the grief over her best friend’s death, calm and cool music that plays as the protagonist cruses around locations in search of clues, dramatic music that plays with there’s a critical situation and more.\n\nA few of the tracks damn near give me goosebumps, such as this one.\n\nThe original game made excellent use of the Famicom Disk System’s expansion audio, but the Super Famicom soundtrack is even more remarkable.\n\nGameplay\n\nFamicom Detective Club Part 2 is a point and click adventure game that focuses in large part on menus. The game is mostly told in first-person from the young protagonist’ perspective.\n\nFor most situations you can look around, speak to various people around you, present items to them, think about the situation and save. You do this by selecting the option you wish and pressing A. Think of the game as an evolution of a text only adventure game, but you can actually easily understand what’s going on.\n\nAs you play you’ll need to sometimes present items to characters, although doing so isn’t always such a good idea. Showing off Yoko’s photograph to Ayumi for instance usually results in the poor girl tearing up.\n\nThere are some situations where after you are told something, you’ll need to think about it. Thinking is the game’s way of allowing the player inside the protagonist’s mind.\n\nThe game is divided up into chapters like a novel, presenting the game in a manner best suited for play sessions that can last from anywhere from a few minutes to a few hours. When you choose to save and quit the game, the next time you return to it you will have the ability to review all that has happened recently. This is is an excellent feature that is sorely missing from many modern RPG and adventure games.\n\nLastly, I would be remiss if I didn’t mention the wonderful translation DemiForce and Tomato did. All conversations sound natural and with a script of I’d estimate of at least 20,000 words, there are only a handful of spelling or grammar errors. Like Mother 3 fan translation, it’s so well written you will find it hard to believe this is a fan translation!\n\nControls\n\nGiven it’s Famicom Disk System roots, the game doesn’t use most of the buttons on the Super Famicom controller. All you will pretty much ever use is the D-pad and the A button.\n\nD-pad: Choose options in menus\n\nA: Advance text, confirm\n\nB: Cancel\n\nY: No function\n\nX: No function\n\nL: Close Scrapbook\n\nR: Open scrapbook\n\nSelect: No function\n\nStart: Pause\n\nFrustration\n\nThere are some points in the game that demand arcachic trail and error gameplay in order to advance. For instance, there are literally several points in conversations which force you to ask everything you can possibly ask about, present everything you can possible present, then think about the situation, and then try every option again in search of a new response.\n\nNewer games such as Phoenix Wright address this by having the word “new” appear next to a conversation path you have already had to give the player some way of knowing what to do next. Not here! This isn’t a constant problem, but you will find yourself scratching your head more often than you rightfully should.\n\nAvailability & Price\n\nThe original Famicom Disk games can be found relatively easy, but remember they were originally sold separately, and you’ll probably have to buy them separately, increasing your cost. The Super Famicom version reviewed here was only available for the Nintendo Power Data Cartridge service in Japan, and Data Cartridges containing this title seem to be exceedingly rare, even in Japan. If I had to hazard a guess on price, based on other SFC Data Carts, expect to pay $70 or more for an original copy. The GBA port of the FDS disks can be found the easiest at around $30. In each of these cases though, you’ll be getting the Japanese versions.\n\nI am currently inquiring into the possibility of a reproduction cartridge, but as of this writing, I’m not sure if that’s even possible. I don’t like to promote piracy, but the translated version does play perfectly on the Super Powerpak…\n\nAudience\n\nFans of the Phoenix Wright series will eat this game up. The whole game feels like one giant Phoenix Wright case, complete with plot twists and more exciting dialogue than you can throw a novel at.\n\nThis game itself involves death, despair, the supernatural, has people smoking, drinking and soliciting sex and more; definitely not the typical child-friendly Nintendo game. In fact, Famicom Detective Club part 2 is the only Nintendo first party game that carries a parental warning and CERO rating of 15+!\n\nHistory\n\nFamicom Detective Club Part 2 was originally released for the Famcom Disk System in 1989. the original version spanned two disks, and used each side to the maxim capacity. Detective Club Part 2 is a direct sequel to the previous year’s Famicom Detective Club which starred the same characters. In 1998, the game was re-released on the Nintendo Power data cartridge service.\n\nThe Super Famicom Data Cartridge Service, ran between 1996 and 1999 in Japan, allowed consumers to purchase special blank cartridges from vendors at a reduced rate and then either go to certain retailers or mail the cartridge to Nintendo through a service called “Nintendo Power” (had absolutely nothing to do with the American magazine).\n\nThe service offered a dozen or so titles, some of which had shown up as broadcast Stelleview games and were the only way of getting cartridge versions of these games. Some of these games included Super Picross, Super Wrecking Crew, Super Famicom Wars, and as mentioned, a remake of Famicom Detective Club Part II.\n\nThe Super Famicom remake of Detective Club Part 2 offered vastly improved graphics and sound and slight tweaks to the gameplay and story, as well as add in the dating sim element with Ayumi. Review’s advice: although randomly grabbing Ayumi’s chest is fun, its not the best way to win her affections.\n\nFor the third wave of titles marking the 20th anniversary of the Famicom in Japan, the FDS version of Famicom Detective Club Part 2 was released on the GBA. This version is the most readily available version and is probably also the cheapest.\n\nOverall\n\nGood\n\n-Extremely well written\n\n-Beautiful portraits and art style. As the protagonist states early on, Ayumi is cute ♥\n\n-The entire translation feels natural, keeps the Japanese names intact and through hours and hours of scrolling text, there are only a couple of spelling or grammar errors. That’s better than my track record to be sure!\n\nBad\n\n-Trial-and-error gameplay; sometimes you literally have to scan through EVERY option you have to advance the game.\n\n-No SNES mouse support. Why the hell not?\n\n-Occasionally confusing\n\n-Finding a way to play it can be difficult\n\nConclusion\n\nFamicom Detective Club Part 2 is an amazing experience and is much darker than you would expect a Nintendo game to be. It’s a shame that the series never really continued, but if you are looking for an engaging adventure game to sink your teeth into, look no further. There are some noticeable flaws regarding the trial and error gameplay of some situations, but this is indicative of the genre itself.\n\nData\n\nPlatform: Famicom Disk System, Super Famicom, Gameboy Advance\n\nGenre: Text-based Adventure\n\nOriginal Release Dates: May 23, 1989 and June 30 1989 (FDS), April 1 1998 (SFC), August 10, 2004 (GBA)\n\nDeveloper: Nintendo\n\nPublisher: Nintendo\n\nAlso from the developer: There’s not much out there from Nintendo in terms of games like this.

It’s a budget title that shouldn’t be good, but is. It’s a buggy, repetitive mess, yet it’s one of the games I find myself returning to again and again over much more polished titles. It’s not online either, but it’s by far one of the best multiplayer experiences on the Xbox 360.\n\nIf that’s not confusing enough, it’s also the third game in a whole series of Earth Defense Force games and the only one to be released in North America. While I recommend importing the previous two games, is 2017 worth a look? Read on to find out.\n\nStory\n\nThe story is identical to that of Monster Attack. Have some delicious copy-pasta from my Monster Attack review.\n\nIn the year 2017, Earth is invaded by an alien force made up of almost every ’50s monster movie clechés you can think of. Giant ants, giant spiders, robots, UFOs and yes, even Godzilla. To combat these invaders, the nations of the world band together to form a united army called the Earth Defense Force. As the lone EDF Soldier “Storm One”, presumably the sole survivor of a platoon, you are tasked with defending Japanese soil from the alien threat.\n\nIt’s cheesy 50′s horror movie fare. If you like classics like THEM! then you’ll fall in love with this game.\n\nGraphics\n\nThe jump fro the PS2 to the HD Xbox 360 is noticeable, but not really for the visuals themselves. By and large the game looks the same, but enhanced. Textures are greatly improved, making buildings look much better than ever before. Windows now reflect light, they fall in a somewhat more believable manner, staircases can be climbed for sniper positions. It’s all rather cool. Nearly all the enemies have been redesigned and look less goofy than before, but I honestly prefer the PS2 designs to these new ones, not to mention that Global Defense Force has a much larger variety of enemies than are found here.\n\nThe biggest improvement is the framerate, which only drops during especially huge, screen filling explosions. It’s no where near as bad as what can be found in the later stages of Global Defense Force, but it’s still there. This is a budget game, after all.\n\nJust like the PS2 games, character models in 2017 look very polished considering this is a budget title. By and large, the game’s graphics are decent to excellent.\n\nAudio\n\nGone is the amazing menu menus from Monster Attack and Global Denfese Force, but the music in-game is largely lifted rigth out of Monster Attack. There are a few new arrangements this time around too, but nothing that stick outs quite as well as that PS2 menu music!\n\nUnlike the PAL English versions of the PS2 games, Earth Defense Force 2017 actually has voice acting in English. The voice acting itself isn’t bad, but many lines are terrible, repeat often, and are fun to listen to since they are often absurd. The best voices are the female operations officer and your CO, both of whom have the most lines and are voiced by seemingly good actors.\n\nYour buddies though? “Wait until they get closer! Don’t wanna waste your bullets!” – A line from a game with infinite ammo\n\nGameplay\n\nJust like it’s predecessors, 2017 is a strictly third person action game that is a blast to play because it’s simple, functional, and fun. As before, you can carry two different weapons at a time ranging from automatic assault rifles to shotguns to missiles to special weapons like automatic gun turrets and Boundguns that shoot bullets that bound off walls.\n\nYou collect weapons by defeating enemies and then collecting WEAPON icons they randomly drop. There is no way of knowing what weapon you just collected until the mission is over, and no way of knowing if the weapon you just picked up is one you don’t already have. Duplicate weapons mean nothing, so there’s no point in collecting weapons already have. The game rewards new, better weapons for beating stages on higher difficulties, and even better rewards await players who can beat the last few missions on the hardest difficulty settings.\n\nThis system has a risk/reward factor as even if you collect some weapons, if you are killed in combat, none of your upgrades will carry over to your inventory! With six difficulty settings, only the most hardcore of gamers will ever 100% Earth Defense Force 2017. I’ve been playing for at least three years and I still have yet to finish the last stages on Inferno difficulty.\n\nSimilarly, you gain HP by picking up armor units from fallen enemies that give your character a single HP gain per armor unit you collect. This adds up over time until you collect a maximum of 9,999 HP. If you want to take on Inferno, you’ll need all the HP you can get.\n\nBest of all, the game can be played co-op splitscreen with a friend, greatly increasing your chances in some of the tougher missions as both characters have access to every weapon unlocked and share the same maximum health that the player has accumulated in single player. This is the best way to enjoy 2017.\n\nControl\n\nThe controls for Earth Defense Force 2017 are pretty much exactly like they were on the PS2 games, and that’s a great thing.\n\nLeft Stick: Movement\n\nRight Stick: Aim gun/Look\n\nLT: Jump/Barrel Roll\n\nRT: Fire\n\nLB: Switch Weapon\n\nRB: Secondary fire\n\nA: Confirm menu choices, no usage in-game\n\nB: Cancel menu choices, no usage in game\n\nX: no usage\n\nY: no usage\n\nStart: Pause\n\nBack: no usage\n\nFrustration\n\nThe game has six difficulty levels, and the latter Inferno difficulty can be extremely frustrating as the game becomes harder by decreasing the amount of damage your weapons do, increasing enemy strength, and in some cases, increasing the numbers of enemies. Another large source of frustration is the giant spiders that spew webs.\n\nDue to the budget nature of the game, Spider webs can travel a small distance through solid walls. Spider webs stick to you and sap your health, and there is nothing you can do to escape the damage.\n\nAudience\n\nEarth Defense Force 2017 has been called the Serious Sam of third person shooters, and that’s pretty much accurate. If you like minimal plot and maximum shooting, Earth Defense Force 2017 is for you.\n\nAvailability and price\n\nEarth Defense Force 2017 is region locked on the Xbox 360, but was released worldwide under the same title for the first time in the series. Expect to pay between $12-15 for a used copy. It shouldn’t be hard to find in used game shops.\n\nHistory\n\nAlthough most in the west have no idea, Earth Defense Force 2017 is actually the third game in the series, after Monster Attack and Global Defense Force, both only released outside of Japan in European countries. Those two games were originally part of D3 Publisher’s Simple 2000 Series in Japan, a hugely successful 2000 yen budget line of PS2 games. Shown to the left are the Japanese covers of the PS2 prequels.\n\nIn 2007, Sandlot made an odd choice for a Japanese developer and announced their next project would be remaking Monster Attack for the Xbox 360. Perhaps because it was now on an American made console, the third game was localized and became a cult hit in North America. In the meantime, due to extremely low sales of the Xbox 360 in Japan, the game didn’t do nearly as well as either Simple 2000 Earth Defense Force PS2 titles, and any hope for a remake of the arguably superior Global Defense Force died with it. Maybe Someday Sandlot.\n\nIn late 2010, a long awaited sequel for the Earth Defense Force series was announced by the title Earth Defense Force Insect Armageddon. Details were slow at first, but it soon came out that the game is not being developed by Sandlot, but instead Vicious Cycle software, an American deveoper now owned by D3 and best known for their previous Robotech games last gen and Eat Lead: The Return of Matt Hazard on the PS3 and 360.\n\nThe change in developers is slightly alarming for me, but I will not pass judgment on Insect Armageddon until I’ve played it myself.\n\nOne final note I feel I should mention: there is also a Jaleco Super Nintendo game called Super Earth Defense Force. Although it shares the name, that shooter has nothing to do with this series. It’s fun though!\n\nOverall\n\nGood\n\n-Simple controls, simple gameplay and simple fun\n\n-Probably the best Co-op multiplayer game on the 360\n\n-Lasting replay value\n\nBad\n\n-No Pale Wing Soldiers 😦\n\n-Spider web can travel through solid walls. It’s bullshit.\n\n-Framerate still occasionally dips\n\n-Occasionally, the game will take command of the camera to focus on an important major enemy while still allowing the player control over their character. This is momentary, but annoying if you need to attack surrounding enemies.\n\nConclusion\n\nEarth Defense Force 2017 is not a flashy game, it doesn’t millions of dollars behind its budget and it’s not online. Instead, what you get here is a fun retreat back to the way gaming used to be; fun and challenging, great with a friend and one you can pick up and play over and over. If this sounds appealing, look no further than Earth Defense Force: 2017. If you haven’t played any of the games in the series, this one is probably the best place to start before you import the PS2 titles.

Where most Americans eagerly await the next block buster FPS or third person action game, Japanese gamers line up at stores to buy anime inspired RPGs, dating sims, turn based strategy games and more.\n\nThus, every year, many Japanese games never see release in America. Sometimes it’s because of copyright issues. Sometimes it’s just due to cultural differences and many Japanese games just wouldn’t appeal to westerners. Other times its because these Japanese games are just too weird.\n\nLet’s all be thankful that RAD: Robot Alchemic Drive wasn’t among those games. Released by Enix of all companies in 2002 in North America, R.A.D was unlike any mech game before – or since.\n\nIs originality enough to make this the best mech game ever?\n\nStory\n\nIt is the near future. After numerous failed attempts to explore space, it is discovered that no organic tissue can survive in space due to an unknown form of radiation called the Nectar Radiance.\n\nAn organization dedicated to finding a long-term solution to humanity’s survival in space, the Civilization Preservation Foundation (try saying that three times fast), is formed with the funding of Tsukioka Industries. Unfortunately, Tsukioka Industries eventually goes bankrupt after having poured all of its resources into the covert development of the Meganites, gigantic machines with seemingly no use or application. Best use of funds ever.\n\nIts founder dies penniless, leaving his child, a junior at Senjo city high school, to take the interim position of chairman. Without warning, colossal robots teleport onto Earth’s surface, wreaking havoc and devastating many cities, with Senjo as their next target.\n\nAs a giant robot approaches Senjo, Japan, the young Tsukioka chairman is contacted by the Trillenium Committee, the secret face of the Civilization Preservation Foundation.\n\nGiven a strange remote control, the chairman is told the true purpose of the Meganites – to defend Earth against these alien robots – the Volgara.\n\nNone of this makes much sense, nor do many of the characters that claim the Volgara are the ultimate form of evolution. I could be wrong, but last I checked, robots don’t evolve.\n\nGraphics\n\nR.A.D makes use of the basic graphics engine used n nearly every PS2 game Sandlot produced. You’ll be able to freely explore a large city with buildings you cannot enter. The city is completely destructible as well, but its probably a good idea to not destroy it as you kind of are suppose to be protecting it.\n\nThe giant robots next to the small humans and buildings give R.A.D an impressive sense of scale. The characters appear as fairly low res polygonal models, but when they speak, are represented with some nice looking anime stills, which differ as conversations change.\n\nThe game has some fairly advanced particle effects for the PS2, and explosions are handled just as well here as other Sandlot titles.\n\nAudio\n\nLike most Sandlot games, the majority of the music is forgettable. On the other hand, sound effects are handled well. Giant mechs make all sorts of mechanical sounds as they move, and pound the ground due to their sheer size and weight. One minor gripe of mine is that the Volgaras make the same scream as the giant ants of Earth Defense Force. This is amusing at first, but then really weird. Maybe the Volgaras are soldiers in the Ravager army?\n\nThe real star of the audio however, is the voice acting. It is simply awful – in an awesome way. The voice acting in the English version is intentionally awful, as a parody of old-school giant robot anime and movie English dubs with almost no budget.\n\nVoice actors were told to deliberately speak their lines with the contextual abandon and wild cheesiness of the original TV shows. Even though the game obviously takes place in Japan and the game makes no effort to hide this, many primary characters use very Americanized pronunciation, while the Japanese news reporter Mika Banhara speaks with an almost offensively thick Japanese accent.\n\nThis mesh brings R.A.D to a whole new level of laughably bad audio.\n\nYou need only watch this conversation exchange to understand all that R.A.D is about. Poor Nanao.\n\nGameplay\n\nWhen you first put in Robot Alchemic Drive, you choose from three characters (doesn’t effect anything) and then you get to choose from three different robots.\n\nThere’s an average fighter, Vevel, a jetfighter robot, and a heavy weapons robot that’s slow but powerful. I chose Vevel, to get the most ballanced first play, so I’ll have to update this later to give my thoughts on the other two.\n\nThird person action games are dime a dozen. A lot can be said for the unique human perspective that R.A.D offers for the giant robot battles.\n\nSince you control the robot and your human player, you have to keep a close eye on what’s happening at all times because you can only control either the robot or the human – not both at once.\n\nSince you can’t attack as a human, you have to stay far enough away from the battle to avoid harm, but you also need to be close enough to see what’s going on as you control your robot.\n\nAlthough the game downright tells you to do so at one point, getting up on the shoulder of the robot is not such a good idea as it does put you in harms way. if your robot gets knocked down.\n\nThe gameplay boils down to controlling your giant robot around into position, then punching, blocking and launching projectiles at your enemy until you win. It’s not groundbreaking or very deep, but it is a hell of a lot of fun.\n\nControl\n\nR.A.D has a very unusual control scheme that takes some getting used to. In the basic control option, you move your giant mech with the d-pad, and use each analog stick to control each arm of your mech. Depending on how you swing the sticks, your mech will block, punch, jab, or even uppercut. The fact buttons are used to fire long range weapons of various sorts.\n\nIf that’s not enough for you, there’s also an advanced control option where you must use the L2 and R2 shoulder buttons to control each leg of your mech to move it! The advantage of this mode is it frees the d-pad up for moving the torso, making it possible to evade enemy punches at the cost of more difficult movement.\n\nEither way, you probably won’t be very good the first time you play Robot Alchemic Drive. However, over time you’ll eventually learn to actually love the controls, as it feels like the DuelShock controller really is controlling a 120-foot-tall robot, espically when using a PS3 wireless controller. It’s pretty damn cool.\n\nFrustration\n\nMost of the frustration in R.A.D comes from the very fact that you control your giant walking robot from a third person angle that remains fixed while controlling the robot.\n\nThe catch with the frustration is that you have direct control where you put yourself to get the view of the battle.\n\nSystem availability and price\n\nRobot Alchemic Drive is exclusively for the Playstation 2. Most likely forecasting low sales, enix produced the game in limited numbers in North America, making it rather difficult to find today. Check your local area, but don’t hold your breath. It is on ebay now and then, but for inflated prices. As always, good luck. and happy hunting.\n\nAudience\n\nThe game is rated Teen for blood and violence, but there’s really nothing at all here that wouldn’t be suitable for a child. The game’s true audience is for Japan-oholics like me that really love Japanese mech tv shows and movies. This is pretty much like Neon Genesis: the game.\n\nHistory\n\nBefore Earth Defense Force and even Robot Alchemic Drive, Sandlot created a destructible city engine for what was to be a high budget licensed game called Tekkouki Mikazuki Trial Edition, a one stage demo game meant to promote the television series of the same name. The series bombed.\n\nUnfortunately, the game was later cancelled, so Sandlot turned all their development programming for Tekkouki Mikazuki and created their own giant Robot/monster game: Gigantic Drive, which became in America, Robot Alchemic Drive.\n\nSandlot has since moved on from the PS2, but man, I would love to see a sequel to R.A.D someday. This game needs way more attention than it got.\n\nOverall\n\nGood\n\n-Excellent Mech designs and graphics. This game has aged remarkably well.\n\n-Voice acting so incredibly laughable it’s good\n\n-Extremely unique and a ton of fun\n\nBad\n\n-Some bad looking textures\n\n-a somewhat steep difficulty curve for the controls\n\n-Uneven framerate\n\n-R.A.D has become exceedingly difficult to find, with inflated ebay prices offering the only ticket to this game.\n\n-Nanao is annoying\n\nConclusion\n\nR.A.D is an unusual game, and some would even say it’s a rather flawed game. My perspective is that this is one of the best PS2 games that somehow got a localization, and the more people that know about it the better. If you can find it, give it a shot. You’ll walk away smiling. I can only hope a sequel come out someday.\n\nData\n\nPlatform: Playstation 2\n\nGenre: Mech, but unlike any other\n\nRelease Date: November 5, 2002\n\nDevoloper: Sandlot\n\nPublisher: enix\n\nDeveloper’s notable other works: Monster Attack, Global Defense Force, Earth Defense Force 2017, The Onechanbara series\n\nESRB: Teen\n\nBuy or skip: Buy\n\nQuite possibly the best in the triology\n\nIf there’s one thing conventional videogame knowledge can teach its that you shouldn’t mess with a winning formula. This is the philosophy behind many sequels and Global Defense Force is no exception.\n\nBorrowing nearly everything from Monster Attack, Global Defense Force stands as a mirror game that has been significantly built upon. Released in late 2006, Global Defense Force’s western release was just like Monster Attack’s; it was quietly released with little fanfare only in Europe by a small budget game company and then quickly all but forgotten.\n\nConsidering the vast library of games for the PS2, is this obscure action game worth your time?\n\nGenre\n\nGlobal Defense Force is a third person action shooter with duel stick and shoulder button driven FPS-like control. Despite its arcade like nature, it cannot be played with an arcade stick.\n\nStory\n\nI was originally going to post the plot as stated in the manual, but its just so badly written it would just leave you confused. Here’s my plot revision that actually does tell you what’s going on.\n\nTwo years have passed since the end of the Great War with the Ravagers. Despite nearly every major city being reduced to ruins, humanity has been hard at work rebuilding at an astonishing rate.\n\nWhile the toll the Ravager war was indeed major, it was alien inventions that allowed humanity to jump leaps and bounds in engineering and weapon development. How ironic it all was that the same technology used by the attackers was being used to rebuild the planet.\n\nSince destroying the Ravager Mothership, The EDF (Earth Defense Force) has been shut down and a new allied army has formed in their place, called the Global Defense Force to protect humanity should they ever be attacked from beyond the stars again.\n\nA new type of jetpack and hand cannon based on Ravager technology was created, and a new unit of soldier called the Pale Wing were trained, all in the hopes they would never be needed.\n\nAfter so much suffering and destruction, humanity has finally begun to enjoy a quiet time of peace. However, deep down in the bowels of the Earth….something strange is happening.\n\nJune 12, 2019…the planet was put on alert.\n\nAn emergency broadcast from England announced that a multitude of giant lifeforms were invading cities all across the planet once again. The Ravagers were back.\n\nUpon hearing the news, the GDF readied itself for a new nightmare. Even armed with the new technology, would humanity be able to defeat the Ravagers once again?\n\nWell okay, the plot can be summarized pretty much as a rehash of the original game, but come on, what kind of riveting plot do you expect from a budget game that has giant ants, spiders, robots and UFOs?\n\nGraphics\n\nGraphically, Global Defense Force is about on par with Monster Attack, both its highs and lows. Monsters and locales look impressive for the PS2, espically considering this is a budget game.\n\nThe game does seem to use more polygons than Monster Attack, so weapon effects and explosions look better than the previous game’s. As before, cityscapes are fully destructible which adds to the charm of the game.\n\nStill, as with the previous game, the environments still have a lot of pop in due to the short draw distance, and you’ll run into numerous graphical imperfections from screen tearing to occasional clipping issues to slowdown so bad it can actually reduce the FPS count to single digits.\n\nGlobal Defense Force is an ambitious game that usually succeeds, but it occasionally is brought down by the limited PS2 hardware. Still, you can’t really fault a budget game for technical issues, and besides, nobody plays the Earth Defense Force games because of how they look.\n\nAudio\n\nGlobal Defense Force has a bit of a more varied soundtrack than Monster Attack, but this is still a game where you will find most of the music forgettable after hearing it. It’s not bad, its just not very memorable.\n\nGameplay\n\nGlobal Defense Force is a third person action game where the player controls a lone EDF soldier and fights against a horde of 50’s horror clichés from giant ants and other insects to robots, UFOs and lots more.\n\nAs before, GDF mixes in slight RPG elements, as monsters drop health and new weapon items, which work as a grab bag of sorts since you’ll never know what new weapon you’re getting, or even if’s new at all. If you’ve played Monster Attack, all this will sound familiar.\n\nThe EDF foot Soldier returns with all previous weapons as well as a new weapons, but he is totally overshadowed by the inclusion of the brand new alternate class, the Pale Wing.\n\nThe Pale Wing soldier is lightly armored and thus takes twice the damage that the soldier does, but they carry a unique set of powerful weapons and the ability to fly with a aid of a jetpack. Plus, these units are apparently made up of women only, and they wear miniskirts as part of their uniforms. Talk about boosting morale of the troops!\n\nThe Pale Wing’ cannot jump or barrel roll as the soldier can, but in exchange you can fly anywhere you want. This gives the Pale Wing an amazing freedom of movement and unmatched evasiveness.\n\nHowever, you cannot fly with the jetpack indefinitely. There is a energy gauge that depletes after about 15 seconds of constant use. Luckily, this gauge quickly refills itself when you are grounded.\n\nHowever, if you completely drain the Pale Wing’s energy, the jetpack will overheat and take twice as long to recharge. To make matters worse, many of the unique weapons the Pale Wing uses also take energy directly away from the jetpack, so if your jetpack overheats, you can be left stuck on the ground unable to even fire until your jetpack recharges.\n\nThe Pale Wing’s weapon set varies from extremely close range but powerful lasers to lighting powered shotguns to powerful sniper rifles and rocket launchers. As mentioned, some of the Pale Wing’s weapon sap the jetpack gague while others have ammo clips. With these weapons, jetpack gauge is partially depleted when reloading.\n\nThe extreme maneuverability and unique power of the Pale Wing is completely balanced by her vulnerability to enemies and the constant threat of overheating the jetpack. This level of strategy is unparalleled in any other budget game I’ve ever played. The Pale Wing rocks.\n\nStill, there are some situations where the EDF Soldier is better suited for the stage. A mix of the soldier and the Pale Wing also comes in handy in co-op multiplayer.\n\nAvailability and Price\n\nGlobal Defense Force was only released in Europe and Japan. If you want to pick up the European English version, you should only expect to pay a few euros for it at most. The game was a budget title to begin with, so finding it used for even less shouldn’t be too hard. It’s sometimes on ebay, but I managed to get my copy off amazon. Good luck to everyone looking for it.\n\nHistory\n\nGlobal Defense Force was very well received in Japan, but received limited sales in Europe, killing any hopes for a North American release. However, reviews were nevertheless positive, and many consider Global Denfese Force to be superior to the third game for the much more powerful Xbox 360, Earth Defense Force 2017.\n\nOverall\n\nGood\n\nGlobal Defense Force is a blast to play either alone or with a friend. The Pale Wing is so much fun to play as you’ll wonder why she wasn’t in the third game. The game is also almost twice as long as Monster Attack.\n\nBad\n\nAs before, the game is full of technical issues such as uneven framerate, horrid pop-in, and although not a fault of the game, its PAL 50Hz only.\n\nConclusion\n\nGlobal Defense Force is one of the best titles in the entire Simple 2000 series. Europeans should consider themselves lucky to have it available to them, and those in North America should jump the hurdles required to play this. Keep in mind that the game is PAL 50Hz, so make sure you have a TV that can support this video mode. If not, make sure you have a PS2 with a modchip.\n\nSimply burn the game to your PC using a free program such as Imgburn and then run the PS2 PAL to NTSC y-fix program, which auto corrects games and makes them playable on NTSC televisions. Burn the iso to disc and enjoy Global Defense Force in NTSC.\n\nData\n\nPlatform: PlayStation 2\n\nGenre: Third Person Action Shooter\n\nRelease Date: Mid 2006 (PAL)\n\nDevoloper: D3 Publisher\n\nPublisher: Essential Games\n\nPEGI Rating: 12+\n\nBuy or skip: Buy\n\nThe best adventure game on the Xbox, and one of the best adventure games, period\n\nVideogames sure have changed over the years. Once just simple screen-driven versions of tabletop games and basic, basic shooters, today’s games exist in a multifaceted world of complex genres and styles. Mirroring the history of film, a key question is often asked now: are videogames art?\n\nWhile that is potentially arguable both ways in the general sense, one thing cannot be argued – Dreamfall: The Longest Journey is indeed art.\n\nDreamfall is one of the last, best games for Windows and Microsoft’s original black Xbox. My computer isn’t gaming quality by any stretch of the meaning, so I’ll be reviewing the Xbox title.\n\nGenre\n\nDreamfall the Longest Journey is a 3D adventure game that plays like many menu and text-driven adventure games but with all the text dialogue carefully and skillfully spoken making the wonderful writing even more enjoyable. There are plenty of places to explore, things to investigate, people to meet and interact with, and yes, classic adventure game puzzles.\n\nStory\n\n“They say that every story has a beginning and an end. That may be true in most cases, but sometimes however, the two are one and the same.” – Zoë\n\nWithout going into too much detail, Dreamfall is the story of a young woman named Zoë Castillo who lives in futuristic Casablanca. She’s your average gal with average problems – she’s looking for her place in school, love, and the world at large. Although her life starts out completely average, soon she’ll be caught up in events far more important than her trivial problems and her world will never be the same…\n\nZoë keeps seeing visions of a small young girl in a white dress in various monitors wherever she goes. The girl telling her to save someone named April Ryan and cryptic remarks about a place called “Arcadia”. What does this all mean?\n\nLike Final Fantasy VI, the story of Dreamfall centers around multiple characters that each have a story to tell that is every bit as interesting as the main story, but also like the classic Square game, Dreamfall does generally focus most of its efforts on the central character, Zoë Castio. She is such a well flushed out character that during the times when you don’t play as her, you will actually miss her.\n\nGameplay\n\nThis is what really separates Dreamfall from other games – its not really a “game”. Dreamfall focuses on long, exquisitely detailed in-engine cutscenes to move the story along. For the most part, this is the kind of game that sweeps the player off their feet and takes them on a long journey – just as the subtitle would suggest.\n\nSome people hate this idea and feel they should be in control. If that’s you, then stop reading this and go play something else. You will not enjoy Dreamfall.\n\nIf this does sound like something you would enjoy, then you’ll find yourself in true gaming bliss.There are cleaver ways the game engages players allowing interaction in the story which few games employ so well.\n\nOccasionally you have command over how Zoë will respond to someone during a conversation, which can effect the course of events to come. Some entire events can be avoided or altered through speech, and it all feels natural. Everyone in the whole game reacts as you would expect real people to.\n\nThe game has some stealth sections that are really just there to break up the gameplay so you’re not always doing the same kind of thing. It’s as fitting in Dreamfall as it would be other adventure games, say Phoenix Wright for instance.\n\nThe biggest flaw with Dreamfall is the fact that it has a fighting system. Incredibly simplistic, robotic and awful, there are thankfully only a handful of fights in the entire game. It’s not a big enough problem to worry too much about though.\n\nOf course, what would be an Adventure game without puzzles? Dreamfall’s involve using a small set of inventory items to solve problems. This usually takes the form of combining two or more items together to create something useful or using Zoë’s black market cellphone to hack into digital locks. The hacking mini game is along the idea of Bioshock’s use of Pipedream, but this time its more like Simon Says than anything else.\n\nAudio\n\nDreamfall has a stunning score. Composed by Leon Willett, the tracks are extremely atmospheric and greatly help drive the emotion of each scene. Since Dreamfall has more in common with movies than other games, this aspect is crucial and is executed extremely well. Songs are mostly instrumental with plenty of piano, strings and other soft instruments, but there are also a few vocal tracks sung by Norwegian singer Even Johansen, aka Magnet.\n\nDreamfall is also without a doubt, the host of some of the most impressive and largest voice cast in gaming history. There are literally dozens and dozens of voice actors who each deliver unique lines, and everyone in the game is voiced. You will never encounter two people with the same voice as you do in other games such as Oblivion. Each of the main characters espically have voices that fit their characters are the acting is spot on. There’s something both fitting and exotic about a girl from Casablanca with a distinctly English voice.\n\nCheck out this video for an example of the superb voice acting in Dreamfall, and to see how the game first begins with Brian Westhouse, a character long time fans of the Longest Journey will already know:\n\nControls\n\nAs I don’t have the PC version, I can only comment on the controls for the Xbox. Dreamfall is a 3D Adventure game seemingly tailor made for the Xbox controller S in mind. You move with the left stick and can rotate your surroundings with the Right stick. If you click the left stick in, a blue “scanning beam” will appear and when it highlights an object you can interact with, the object will gain a green box around it and a simple press of the A button will allow you to examine it more closely. The +pad is used to manage inventory, the right shoulder button toggles stealth, and the A button is used for general advances. When given different ways you can respond in conversations, simply tilt the left stick toward the one you want and press A. It all works extremely well.\n\nAvailability and price\n\nAs with all PC games, Dreamfall will cost more or less depending on where you look. I’ve seen it for as low as $10 and as high as $30. As for the Xbox version, expect to pay around $20. Dreamfall was released almost a year after the 360 was, so it may be slightly difficult to find, but you should be able to find it wherever you can find Xbox originals.\n\nAudience\n\nMature – Dreamfalls deals with some pretty heavy stuff, including death, drugs and more, but the game is best played by adult gamers because they can best relate to the various situations Zoë and the other main characters find themselves in, and be able to appreciate what drives their actions.\n\nHistory\n\nDreamfall is the middle chapter in the Longest Journey narrative created by Norwegian game designer/writer Ragnar Tørnquist. The first game in the series, 1999’s The Longest Journey told the story of April Ryan, a young woman from Stark who unintentionally shifts to Arcadia and learns she has a pivotal role in the future of that world. The Longest Journey may be aged, but it’s still such a fantastic game to go into further detail would be a disservice to that wonderful game. Track it down it you can.\n\nDreamfall picks up several years later and features many of the same characters and places from the first, but Dreamfall does a good enough job that you don’t need to have played The Longest Journey to appreciate Dreamfall and understand what’s going on.\n\nMost everyone who finishes Dreamfall has a single complaint in that the game ends almost as prematurely as Halo 2. The reason being is that Dreamfall was never intended to be the end of the story, rather instead just like the end of a novel.\n\nA sequel is in development called Dreamfall: Chapters which should resolve all remaining issues.\n\nPros: Excellent voice acting, excellent story, beautiful and memorable set pieces, some cleaver puzzles.

Introducing Monster Attack, a budget PS2 third person action game released only in Japan and Europe.\n\nMonster Attack is the first game in a series known in Japan semi-unofficially as The Chikyū Bōeigun, or “Earth Defense Force”.\n\nIn Japan, The Chikyū Bōeigun was an early entry in D3 Publisher’s Simple 2000 series of budget titles all retailing for 2000 yen each.\n\nThought obscure and somewhat hard to find, The Chikyū Bōeigun was translated and brought to Europe until the new title Monster Attack, completely dropping the Earth Defense Force name for whatever reason.\n\nApparently, Monster Attack did well enough in Europe to warrant it’s sequel to be localized for the European gamer, but that game is for another review.\n\nMost gamers in the west will recognize this as it looks very similar to an early Xbox 360 action game called Earth Defense Force 2017, and it should look similar: 2017 is a rather extensive remake of this game.\n\nBeing an obscure PS2 budget title with only a PAL localized version, you might be asking yourself if this simple action game is worth your time and money. Let me assure you that it is on both accounts.\n\nStory\n\nIn the year 2017, Earth is invaded by an alien force made up of almost every ’50s monster movie clechés you can think of. Giant ants, giant spiders, robots, UFOs and yes, even Godzilla. To combat these invaders, the nations of the world band together to form a united army called the Earth Defense Force. As a lone EDF Soldier, presumably the sole survivor of a platoon, you are tasked with defending Japanese soil from the alien threat.\n\nIt’s cheesy 50’s horror movie fare. If you like classics like THEM! then you’ll fall in love with this game.\n\nGraphics\n\nGraphically, the game ranges from slightly below average to slightly above. Cityscapes and the monsters look decent enough, but some of the environments look bland and effects are mostly awful. The arenas for each stage are fairly large and take some time to travel across, but there are only a handful of different stages across the game’s 50 missions. To give the illusion there are more the Developers change the starting locations for each mission. However, this too soon repeats and the novelty wears off. The environments also have a lot of pop in due to the short draw distance, but I mostly fault the limited PS2 hardware for this and not the developer. Keep in mind this is a budget game afterall.\n\nWeapon effects look good, as do explosions. The cityscapres are fully destructible as well, but destroying buildings is rendered like throwing a bowling ball at a paper machete cutout of a building. It leaves a lot to be desired. Worst of all, Monster Attack has a real hard time maintaining a steady framerate as the action heats up in some stages. It can literally drop down to single digits at times, making the game almost unplayable during these segments. They do clear up though, so its not an ongoing issue. All this said, Monster Attack is a budget title and it sure looks like one.\n\nAudio\n\nThe game’s audio serves to enhance the overly cheesy monster there even further. Broody horror movie-like scores fill the game’s track. I love it. The main theme is as techno sci-fi track that is just plain awesome. The rest of the background music is your typical Monster themes and they totally fit in.\n\nGameplay\n\nAlmost as if to apologize for the lackluster graphics, Monster Attack’s gameplay is just short of being excellent. Once you go into options and change the controls to “tactical,” this game becomes one of the best third person shooters you’ll play on the PS2 outside Resident Evil 4.\n\nFor each mission you can carry two sets of weapons. Weapons range from machine rifles to shotguns to rocket launchers to bazaar particle cannons. Your soldier travels on foot by tilting the left stick or by using the d-pad. You aim as you would in an FPS by tilting the right stick. The shoulder buttons are used for jumping, barrel rolling, changing weapons and of course, firing. All the weapons you have have unlimited ammo and are only restricted by their reload times. You can’t attack at all while reloading so its a good idea to leave some ammo for your second weapon in case you need to quickly attack to defend yourself.\n\nWhen you defeat enemies, they sometimes drop items. Items consist of small health packs that instantly restore some lost HP, armor packs, which increase your overall HP by 1 and new weapon packs. Armor isn’t added to your inventory until you successfully complete a mission, making failure even more unpleasant.\n\nLikewise, you can’t tell what new weapons you picked up until after you complete the mission and check the gear you picked up. The weapons are pretty random, so it’s got a candy grab-bag sort of fun to seeing what you got.\n\nThe game teases you with a unique risk/reward system. There are five difficulties to play the game in, and the game will reward players with more powerful items the higher the difficulty they attempt. The most powerful weapons only appear in the hardest stages on the hardest mode called Inferno, appropriately enough.\n\nAlthough the game has you mostly on foot, there are also three vehicles you can use as well – a tank, a speed bike and a helicopter. Unfortunately, you’ll soon discover these all control awful, lack power and are generally best simply ignored.\n\nLasting Appeal\n\nAs you play and collect armor, you increase your overall HP and gain access to stronger weapons, making the game very RPG like in a lot of ways. Knowing your actually accomplishing something every time you play goes a long way to making you want to pick up the controller again.\n\nAvailability and Price\n\nMonster Attack can be found for around 5 Euro making it rather cheap. Only problem is finding anyone who does have it. Check around: check ebay, amazon, European friends or family. You’ll find it.\n\nAudience\n\nEveryone – Despite the violence, the only blood or gore to found is that of the monsters, which is a comical green spray that quickly vanishes. This game can be enjoyed by kids and adults alike.\n\nHistory\n\nIn Japan, The Chikyū Bōeigun quickly became one of the most popular and successful games in the Simple 2000 series, allowing D3 Publish and Sandlot to develop a sequel which did even better.\n\nShortly after D3 was finished with Chikyū Bōeigun 2, they began to work on another title called Chikyū Bōeigun X, surprisingly for the Xbox 360.\n\nEven more shocking was the fact that this game would not be a new game, but a complete remake of the first.\n\nIn 2007, The Chikyū Bōeigun X was finally released for the Xbox 360 in North American rentitled Earth Defense Force 2017, to help distinguish itself from the SNES Super Earth Defense Force game that bares nothing but the common name. Despite being a Monster Attack remake, EDF2017 made many changes including new enemies, weapons, NPC soldiers and a vastly expanded game length.\n\nThat said, Monster Attack is different enough to warrant a purchase and a place in anyone’s PS2 library.\n\nIt may be PAL only, but many new TVs can accept PAL signals and even if they can’t, you can rip the game to an .iso and then run PAL to NTSC converter software “forcing” the game into NTSC. Ah, the joys of technology.\n\nOverall scores\n\nGraphics 7.0 – Monster Attack is a budget game and it shows. Nothing really looks excellent but the graphics do their job well enough that the less than stunning graphics won’t bother you after a few minutes.\n\nAudio – 8.0 A broody excellent 50’s horror movie type sound. Sound effects are used well. I just love the main menu music.\n\nGameplay – 8.0 – Where the game truly shines. It’s simple but fun.\n\nControl – 8.0 – In Technical mode, the controls work like a charm.\n\nValue – 8.0 – True, Earth Defense Force 2017 is this game, and 2017 is much more refined, but this game can be found very cheaply and is a blast to play with a friend.\n\nLasting Appeal 8.0 – Not the longest game nor the deepest, but Monster Attack is a great experience on the PS2. Grab a buddy and have at it with giant ants, spiders, robots and more.\n\nOverall 8.0\n\nData\n\nPlatform: Playstation 2\n\nGenre: Third Person Action Shooter\n\nRelease Date: 2004\n\nDevoloper: D3 Publisher\n\nPublisher: Agetec\n\nPEGI: 12+\n\nBuy or skip: Buy\n\nA dictionary definition of “hidden gem”\n\nIn the dying days of the Gameboy Color and after the release of its successor, the Gameboy Advance, one last 8-bit gem was released and served as the GBC’s final send off swan song. That game was Shantae by small developer Wayforward Technologies.\n\nHaving previously honed their skills on the Gameboy Color with excellent titles such as Wendy: Every Witch Way and Xtreme Sports, the team at Wayforward poured all their experience into one last GBC game that pushed the limited Gameboy Color to its limits and beyond. One glance at Shantae will reveal to anyone that it’s not only one of the most technologically and visually impressive 8-bit games to ever be made, but its a complete labour of love.\n\nReleased in mid 2002, Shantae had been delayed from a mid 2001 release so Wayforward could really work on milking every ounce of power from the GBC. The delay hurt sales, but allowed the team to craft Shantae into something truly special.\n\nStill, as we all know, technical achievements alone don’t make games good. So should you play Shantae? Short answer: yes. long answer: keep reading.\n\nStory\n\nShantae is the story of a spunky, sassy and downright sexy teenage half-genie girl named Shantae strangely enough. Shantae has been hired to protect the small fishing community of Scuttle Town. When Scuttle Town falls under attack from the infamous (and not surprisingly, sexy) lady-pirate Risky Boots, Shantae springs into action to fend off the pirate attack. During the raid, Risky manages to steal town inventor Mimic’s prize, the “steam engine”. Shantae soon learns Risky plans to use the steam engine to power a giant robot that would make her invincible.\n\nPlaying the part of the heroine, Shantae plans to get the engine back from Risky. Shantae soon learns that Risky plans to enhance the steam engine by infusing it with the powers of four elemental stones, So Shantae journeys around to collect them first and foil Risky’s evil plans. Does any of this make much sense? Not really, but who cares.\n\nGameplay\n\nBeing a half genie, Shantae can wield her magic to swing her ponytail as if it were a whip and also preform magical transformation dances. These magical dances prove to be a large part of the game’s unique charm.\n\nAs the game progresses, Shantae gains new dances to transform her into various animal forms. Each new form enables greater mobility and allows Shantae to access places she cannot in her human form, somewhat like Metroid games. The monkey form allows Shantae to jump very high, access narrow holes and scale vertical walls. The elephant form can push around heavy objects. The spider form lets Shantae climb background walls and the Harpie lets Shantae freely fly anywhere. These animal forms cannot attack when you first get them, but you can find secret items that allow you to do that as the game progresses. In Harpie form, Shantae is pretty much unbeatable.\n\nShantae is a brilliant mix of many successful game types all melded together. First take the basic structure from Castlevania 2 Simon’s Quest. Then sprinkle in Zelda style dungeons and puzzles, and finally add in a slight Metroid element of upgrades to find and vast areas to explore both above and below ground.\n\nGraphics\n\nVisually Shantae is a drop dead gorgeous game. Character sprites are large, detailed, colorful and have extremely fluid movements. Environments are well detailed and well designed. Some areas even have multiple background layers like in Super Mario World. Best of all, there is no slowdown or sprite flickering at all. The game’s only visual fault is the frequency of deaths caused by the limited viewing space, causing “leaps of faith” to often land you in pits or spikes.\n\nA totally unexpected touch Shantae features is a day/night system like in Castlevania 2 for the NES. During the day the world is colorful and vibrant, but when night falls, everything gets darker, enemies become stronger and shops are closed. As well, fireflies can only be found in hidden areas at night.\n\nI don’t quite recall what firefies do when collected, but their inclusion adds extra depth.\n\nIt’s little details like this that send Shantae over being just another platformer to a true visual masterpiece. Pokémon Gold and Silver may have previously employed a day/night system on the GBC, but doing so in a platformer was unheard of.\n\nAudio\n\nAs for sound, Shantae features a full set of memorable, fun tunes.\n\nThe GBC was blessed with some truly awesome chiptunes as well as truly awful ones. Luckily, Shantae stands up as one of the better soundtracks produced on the hardware. There’s an upbeat, Arabian vibe to them music that keeps things upbeat and energetic. I really like the music in this game and would love to hear remixes if a sequel should ever actually materialize.\n\nThere’s very little in the way of Shantae remixes, but this video does a fairly good job while showing off much of the awesome gameplay that makes Shantae such a winner.\n\nControls\n\nThe game controls are well as you expect and then some. Shantae can crouch and crawl, even backgrounds. Button combos are employed to let Shantae preform some impressive Melee attacks, and the control remains fluid regardless of what form Shantae is in.\n\nThe precise controls are broken down as follows:\n\nD-pad: Move left/right, Up+B use special item\n\nB: Hair Whip Attack or hold to run\n\nA: Jump\n\nSelect: No function\n\nStart: Pause and bring up the menu\n\nLasting Appeal\n\nThe game is also quite lengthy, especially for a GBC platformer. There are a number of towns, dungeons, bosses and hidden goodies around and I’d say the game should take first time players around 4 hours to complete.\n\nThis might not sound like a lot, but consider that Super Mario World has about the same amount of game time, if not less. This game is bigger than the game that launched the SNES.\n\nAudience\n\nEveryone – Shantae may be sexy and wear what amounts to a bikini bra, but this game is kid-friendly. The strong woman lead and ease of play also make it welcoming to many female gamers too.\n\nHistory\n\nWhen Shantae was finished, the Gameboy Advance had already been on the market for almost a year and the GBC lineup was quickly drying up as many gamers switched to the new hardware. Seeing the quality of the game, Capcom decided to publish the game in America, but in limited quantities only.\n\nThe limited release and the timing of the release were obstacles Shantae ultimately could not overcome, and despite overwhelmingly positive reviews from nearly everyone who had a chance to play Shantae, the game sold very poorly and quickly disappeared from store shelves.\n\nEven at the time, I knew Shantae would become difficult to find so I tracked down a copy when I could get one, and I’m glad I did – today, Shantae is one of the most sought after GBC titles and like Earthbound, prices for even loose copies often exceed $100 USD. I recently checked ebay and saw prices hovering between $300 – 500 USD. Ouch! $40 for the game in 2002 doesn’t seem so expensive anymore.\n\nThroughout the life of the GBA, Shantae fans including myself were on edge to see if Wayforward would make a sequel for the GBA, and Wayforward worked away on doing just that. Tentatively called Shantae Advance, road blocks were quickly formed when Capcom decided they did not want to publish the title a second time for Wayforward after how poorly the first had sold. The game was delayed and delayed and eventually just like the GBC, the GBA too had become obsolete and the game was canceled after being half done.\n\nLast fall, Wayforward announced the long awaited sequel would be coming out for DSiware entitles Shantae: Risky’s Revenge. According to the report, there would be not one but three new Shantae games for the DSi platform as digital downloads. It’s not clear yet if Risky’s Revenge will be broken up into three parts, or this means there will be three different DSi games.\n\nHowever, in typical Shantae tradition that game too was delayed and currently has a scheduled release of only “soon”.\n\nI can only hope that someday Shantae will become recognized for its true platforming brilliance and the game that everyone ignored can finally get its much overdue appreciation.\n\nIn the meantime, here’s the Risky’s Revenge trailer to go crazy over:\n\nScores\n\nGraphics – 9.5- Technically and visually a masterpiece. This is not only be best looking gameboy Color game, but the best looking 8-bit game ever made. It is extremely colorful, lush, sprites are detailed and animate extremely fluidly, and the whole game carries a distinctive Arabian vibe that’s hard to dislike.\n\nSound – 8.5 – While not the best on the system, the music for Shantae is much better than you probably will expect. I hope to hear some good Shantae remixes someday.\n\nGameplay – 8.5 – Nothing earth shattering, Shantae is a simple two button platformer with an attack and jump button. That said, this formula works and Shantae is a ton of fun. The only gripes I have are that the GBC screen is too small to allow you to see what’s coming up (pits, enemies) and that some of the items are too expensive compared to their usefulness.\n\nControl – 10 – Brilliant, perfect, fluid, responsive.\n\nLasting Appeal – 8.0 – Shantae is a lengthy game that can be further enhanced on the GBA, allowing you access to a secret zombie-town and increased color depth. The best way to experience Shantae is on the Gameboy Player or the 2006 GBA SP 2.0. At four hours, this game can be completed in only a few weeks or even days, but don’t rush this one – it’s too good for that.\n\nOverall – 9/10\n\nShantae is excellent.\n\nData\n\nPlatform: Gameboy Color\n\nGenre: Action Platformer\n\nRelease Date: Mid 2002\n\nDevoloper: Wayforward Technologies\n\nPublisher: Capcom\n\nDeveloper’s notable other works: Xtreme Sports, Wendy: Every Witch Way, Sabrina: Zapped\n\nESRB: E\n\nBuy or skip: Buy"
