        "text": "Barcelona, April 24, 2008 - Gammick Entertainment and Enjoy Up present the second playable character of Zombie BBQ: Momotaro.\n\nStoryland is infested with zombies! Little Red Riding Hood has whipped out her weapon and is locked and loaded, ready to end the threat of the undead. But she will not be alone: Momotaro, the peach boy who’s recently arrived from Japanese folklore, will join her on this dangerous crusade. But… what powers and secrets does this legendary character hold?\n\nMomotaro is the second selectable character in Zombie BBQ. He can access the arsenal of weapons in the game, and shoot their enemies… whenever he has snatched enough weapons from his enemies' cold dead hands! From a lethal laser rifle to a sawed-off shotgun and moving up to an incredibly powerful flame thrower or 'Zombie BBQer', Momotaro will have at his disposal plenty of firepower to take on enemies such as the ferocious Granny, the undead Gretel and Pinocchio, the puppet who wanted to be a zombie boy. Not only that, while Red Riding Hood uses her trusty machine gun as a weapon by default, Momotaro launches sharp ninja stars that will spell certain doom for many of the classic characters that will rise from the grave.\n\nYou must choose: Will you control the devastating power of Little Red Riding Hood and her firearms? Or master the deadly precision of a classic Japanese legend like Momotaro? See it at www.gammickentertainment.com\n\nZombie BBQ will be released on Q4 2008.\n\nAbout Gammick Entertainment\n\nGAMMICK Entertainment S.L. is a videogame production company at the heart of the growing Spanish videogame sector.
