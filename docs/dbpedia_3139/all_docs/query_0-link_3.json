David Szymanski continues to be a master of FPS Games by creating a short, but extremely satisfying and funny FPS that showcases why Boomer Shooters are a thing (it's because of him). Other noteworthy games include Serious Sam: Siberian Mayhem (Because of course I loved a Serious Sam game), Singularity (which had a fantastic story and setting), Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2019 (a game that was super rewarding and satisfying as a fan of the franchise and overall was just really well made) and of course, Prey 2006 which despite having one of the most unlikeable and selfish main characters in FPS History is one of the most original and unique and groundbreaking games I have played from that time. LIKE WOW.\n\nSome of the lesser games were disappointing especially since I thought I would love them. The original Call of Duty is extremely redundant and falls apart during the latter half, Turbo Overkill is hugely overpraised with it's first episode being overly difficult because why not and just feels frustrating despite some great things going on in it, so hopefully the devs will be able to balance things more and make it better when it gets to full release. Star Trek: Voyager - Elite Force has a great story and characters, but overall I found the FPS Formula did no favors for the gameplay. And Chex Quest HD? Yeah, it was bad, not gonna lie. I heard it's a downgrade from the original WAD so I'll have to check that out, but it has the most pitiful AI imaginable, is so easy calling it a cakewalk is an insult to cakes and overall it's Jank Low Budget Unreal Engine 4 look does it no favors at all. The nice thing is that there are multiple characters to play as with unique lines of dialogue, so if you REALLY do care to play through all characters it's a nice change of pace.\n\nAs for replays, there were quite a few. I spent a lot of time on Rage which has not aged as well as I thought. I gave more current opinions on Serious Sam 3 and it's expansion Jewel of the Nile, replayed Half-Life again before going through the excellent Half-Life: Restored mod which is my favorite way to play the game now and Kirby Star Allies helped me get through a very dark time in my life this year.\n\n2022 has not been a great year for me overall in terms of what happened in my life despite some good things happening. I've been through tons of depression spouts and overall I just wasn't happy for most of the year. But I will say that 2023 is looking much brighter. Next year I'm planning to play more ambitious games. I'm going to finish Kingdoms of Amalur: Re-Reckoning, Yakuza Kiwami and a couple other games I haven't finished while going through more bigger games like Ghost of Tsushima, Blue Dragon, Immortals Fenyx Rising and overall just trying some newer experiences that are out of my comfort zone. I will continue playing Boomer Shooters and FPS Games of course but my computer really needs to be upgraded starting with my Water Cooler that needs to be replaced and replacing my 2 TB Hard Drive with 2 1TB SSDS.\n\nHappy New Year Everyone!"
