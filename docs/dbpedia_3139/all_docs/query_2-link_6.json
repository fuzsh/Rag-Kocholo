        "text": "Nintendo of Europe's gone all out with Halloween-themed releases - 4 of this week's 5 new downloads feature zombies, ghosts and other typical Halloween monsters. Funnily enough, the only game that doesn't fit the bill is published by Nintendo.\n\nZombies is probably much better known under its North American title of Zombies Ate My Neighbors, but due to Nintendo's policy it has been released with its very generic original European name. As either one or two teenagers, your goal is simple - Rescue your neighbours from the monsters out to get them before they bite the dust. In practice though, you'll find this quite hard to achieve, especially in later stages! Thankfully, you don't necessarily have to rescue every single one of them. There's over 50 stages to beat, so you'll be busy for quite a while - And since it's so incredibly addictive, you'll likely stick with it until the very end. Read our review for more.\n\nIt took forever, but LIT is now finally out in Europe. In this WiiWare game, you play as Jake as he attempts to rescue his girlfriend from a school infested with monsters. The gameplay is quite simple - Simply stay out of the darkness, making your way through the various rooms in the school by creating light sources which in turn create paths. It's quite a unique game, and puzzle fans are likely to love it, on the whole we thought it was quite good and there are some even some improvements for the PAL version. The game costs 800 Wii Points.\n\nGhost Mansion Party is Gameloft's latest WiiWare effort - Taking inspiration from Nintendo's Mario Party, it's a party game in which you move around a board with up to 3 others and play minigames. It seems decent, but looks can deceive - It's just too similar to other motion-controlled minigame collections on the Wii and doesn't offer anything special. But if you're feeling brave, it costs 1000 Wii Points.\n\nLittle Red Riding Hood's Zombie BBQ is a DSiWare release of a DS retail game - One which was never released in Europe. As Little Red Riding Hood or Momotaro (Yes, a character from a Japanese myth) the game doesn't consist of much more than blasting apart the hordes of enemies and bosses that come your way. Although the game had mixed opinions, we thought it was quite good, so if this DSiWare release contains all of the content from the retail game, it could be a very cheap buy at 800 points. We'll review this version soon enough and see if it's worth it.\n\nWe have no idea why Nintendo chose to release A Little Bit of... All Time Classics: Card Classics today - It has absolutely nothing to do with Halloween and has been out in North America and Japan for months. For 500 DSi Points, this package will get you five games from the retail game 42 All-Time Classics, so if you're a fan of the games included it might be nice. Otherwise, we recommend just paying a little bit more for the retail version.\n\nFour Halloween games! Are you getting any to get in the mood for Saturday?"
