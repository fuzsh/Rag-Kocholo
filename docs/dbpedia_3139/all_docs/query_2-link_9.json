        "text": "A one night flight\n\nDeveloper: EnjoyUp Games\n\nPublisher: EnjoyUp Games\n\nRelease Date: January 19th, 2012\n\nAvailable On: DSiWare\n\nGenre: Action, Fantasy\n\nRemember that flash game where you play as the little green helicopter? The one where you try to fly for as long as you can without crashing? Yeah, that was my generation’s Flappy Bird before Flappy Bird! It makes me feel old even though I’m not really old, you know? That helicopter game was pretty dang ubiquitous in its day, at least, I think it was, right? It was the talk of my school back in the day in the sense that plenty of kids played it during class and I’m not the only one who had this experience because in a blog post for the site Other Strangeness by merritt k, she too had a similar experience in her school days. She also goes into the origins of the Helicopter Game, which is a good read! Anyway, based on this experience, I always assumed that there’d be loads of copycats in the years between it and Flappy Bird, but maybe it wasn’t quite the trendsetter that I thought. There were surely some other flash games that did the same thing, but none of them ever caught on in the same way and I can’t even recall any offhand. Was that because they weren’t as good or because not many people cared? If it had come out during the smartphone days, it surely would have fit the platform well, but I was always surprised nobody ever bothered to put it on a handheld gaming device. Seems like a pretty obvious PSP homebrew project to me! Well, with today’s game, I have good news: somebody did make one of these for a dedicated gaming device! It was exclusively on DSiWare, though, so I can’t imagine many people even know or remember it exists. What’s funny, too, is that Gaia’s Moon came out in 2012, just a year before Flappy Bird. I’m not sure if that’s fortunate or unfortunate timing, but it is kind of amusing to me!\n\nIf you look around online, a handful of sources have this clearly copy-pasted bit about Gaia’s Moon playing like Lunar Lander. I have no idea where they got this from, but they’re nothing alike! The only similarity they arguably have is how effective movement requires careful feathering of a button to control whether you want to go up or down, but even that plays out differently between the two. Everything else, from the aesthetics to the objective to the number of potential players and the way pressure is applied on the player, is all different as well, so I think Gaia’s Moon deserves a more accurate elevator pitch! If I had to come up with one, I think I’d say something like, “it’s the Helicopter Game but with really nice graphics, an actual endpoint of sorts, and a time = health system”. I’m no marketer nor do I ever want to be, but I think that gets across the game’s most interesting qualities that we’ll be going into. Considering that DSiWare was a really tough place to get attention for your game – Nintendo Life was really the only outlet consistently reviewing them during its heyday – you really had to do anything it took to stand out and Gaia’s Moon managed to do so thanks to its colorful pop-up book-esque visual style. There’s not a ton to Gaia’s Moon mechanically on virtue of what it is, but you don’t really see this type of game anymore now that Flappy Bird is long past its relevance (and not even on app stores anymore), so I think there’s something inherently interesting to revisiting this type of game design.\n\nThere’s a chance you may recognize EnjoyUp Games if you’re the kind of person who bought games off of WiiWare and trawls around for DS ~hidden gems~ every so often like I do. Their debut title (according to Mobygames, as usual) was Chronos Twin, a DS/DSiWare game about controlling a character split between the system’s two screens simultaneously. I always thought it looked cool and I absolutely love the idea, but I never got around to playing it. I remember hearing good things and it did eventually get a WiiWare port, which seems like it would be kind of missing the point, but it’s probably a fine way to play it. Their other notable title was Little Red Riding Hood’s Zombie BBQ, a shoot ‘em up that I’ve seen pop up on various “Underrated DS games” lists and whatnot. Haven’t played it myself, but it’s about Little Red Riding Hood teaming up with Momotaro (of Japanese folk tale fame) to shoot zombies, so it’s gotta be good! From there, they developed a whole bunch of DSiWare and Wii games while those platforms were still in vogue and went on to consistently support all of the subsequent major platforms for years after that. I don’t hear anything about their games nowadays and they narrowed their focus to pinball and racing games, but they must be doing something right if they’re still around in this merciless industry! Looking at the staff mentioned in the game’s credits, game designer Julio Moruno has a history of doing graphics for various Game Boy Color games (like the Turok ones and Hugo 2, all of which were developed by Bit Managers) and has both graphics-related and design-related credit for Chronos Twin and Little Red Riding Hood’s Zombie BBQ. In general, the staff of EnjoyUp looks to be very consistent since the other credited people on this game (Jorge Biedma, Roberto Granado, Jose Manuel Ruiz) all have credits on at least one game in their catalog and every single one was on Little Red Riding Hood in some capacity as well. There’s surely something you could say here about how keeping people around and fostering talent over the course of years helps keep your company putting out quality games, but I’m sure I don’t have to lecture you on the importance and value of doing that, right?\n\nIn the vein of its straightforward predecessor, there’s only one mode in Gaia’s Moon. Unless you want to count a digital instruction manual, anyway! You can also play it with two people using one DS, which is a cool idea, but I’d be impressed if you find someone itching to play it with you in that way. If you do find someone who’s down to clown with you, I hope you have fun with it! After selecting one of three difficulties, you’re off on your way to save the world of Gaia by flying onward and surviving long enough. Rather than tacking on anything unnecessary, this is still a one button game and the variations on the core premise are instead layered upon it in more subtle ways. You gotta be careful with these simple but masterful one-button game concepts; you ever see how mad people got when Super Monkey Ball had the “audacity” to add a jump button? Yeah, stuff like that can make evolving and iterating upon game design very difficult! The biggest difference compared to the Helicopter Game is that progression is a thing here. instead of just playing until you lose, there’s a concrete number of levels here to complete. Sure, the game loops after you clear the final level, but there’s still a clear spot where you can go, “ok, I’ve officially saved the day and seen the ending of Gaia’s Moon”, and as someone born and raised on games that have clear beginnings and endings, I like this choice. I’m certainly not against games that go on forever (I mean, have you seen some of the games I’ve covered here?), but there’s always something nice about having a concrete goal to aim for, you know? Said choice also facilitates some interesting challenges like a “final boss” to deal with, something the Helicopter Game certainly didn’t have. The implementation of said final boss is a bit odd – you just survive his onslaught and get high enough into the sky so that the sun evaporates it, I guess – but it’s still a cool idea for a game like this in that you sure don’t see anybody else trying it.\n\nProtagonist Atreyu and his trusty cane (which is apparently named Milo according to the manual) fly upward when you tell them to and sink downward when you stop holding the button. Before we continue, I just want to comment on Milo real quick; they make a point of giving Milo an identity in the manual as if that’s something that’ll matter, but there’s no dialogue during the game nor does the fact that the cane has a name ever come up. Aside from being what you fly on, Milo doesn’t have any input in the game’s story, so I’m really not sure why they felt the need to name the cane. I guess it could just be a way of giving it a tiny bit of flavor, but for a person like me who’s very into the whole “talking weapons” thing (Brave Fencer Musashi, Devil May Cry 3, Soul Nomad, and Tales of Destiny were formative games for me, I can’t help it), Milo just being a cane with nothing else going on was genuinely disappointing. I don’t know, the whole thing’s just weird to me! Anyway, there’s a bit of a momentum and physics thing going on here that makes the gameplay a bit more interesting than simple start-stop Simon Says challenges. Not only do you have to get to the right elevation before you bump into something, you also have to account for the way that Atreyu bends and shakes as he rides his cane. Since he doesn’t stop on a dime and isn’t stiff as a board, it’s entirely possible to do everything right, but do it just a little too hard and wobble into something you should have cleared. It’s a very clever way of adding a little tension to every movement; sure, you can press the button long enough, but do you know how to feather it and show a little restraint, too? They were clearly aware of it working like this because there are several moments designed in such a way so that you barely make it through them and have to do more than just hit the right elevation. Whenever a bundle of skulls show up on screen, you’re gonna have to do some careful weaving, for example. It takes a moment to get used to, but it does feel good once you’re consistently accurate!\n\nThe biggest twist in Gaia’s Moon is how health and time both exist and are intertwined. In the Helicopter Game, you can go for as long as you want so long as you don’t crash even once. Here, the clock’s ticking, and it’s ticking really dang fast! As you fly, a bar on the right constantly drains and can only be refueled by grabbing these blue orbs that show up from time to time. If you hit something, you won’t lose instantly, but you’ll lose a chunk of that bar instead. This sounds like it should make things more lenient, but I would argue that it makes things even more stressful! The bar drains fast, the damage you take is significant, the tiny amount you heal feels like a cruel joke, and the health pickups become rarer over time. Oh yeah, by the way, you also don’t heal to full in between levels, so you can’t bank on that! The game tricks you into thinking health will be frequent in the first two stages, but the supply dries up very quickly from there, regularly creating scenarios where you’re still playing but it’s actually impossible for you to win the game because it’ll be (at least!) an entire minute or two before your next chance at health. Let me tell you, surviving just long enough to get to a health pickup only to miss it by accident is soul crushing! I was able to finish the game (on Easy), but it took several runs to do even that because I had situations where I got hit one too many times and then fizzled out because they decided it would be funny if a level only had, like, two health pickups across the entire thing. It’s very annoying, honestly, but in its defense, I will say that the practice and knowledge gained from living a bit longer instead of dying as soon as the game identifies that your run is impossible is worth something that could be useful in a future run. Situations like that make the lack of a level select or training mode strange to me, though. This game relies heavily on memorization with a sprinkle of “Gotcha” moments (especially towards the end), so I think being able to practice and prepare ahead of time would serve to make the loop feel a little less harsh and help people to better understand where things went awry. Like any good game, it is possible to trace back failure to something you did wrong, but when said mistake was five minutes past without any clear indication, you can’t really blame people for missing the signs. A winning run has an extremely small margin for error even on Easy, so I’m thankful EnjoyUp was smart and made this a very short game to encourage you not to give up!\n\nThere are only six levels and they do go by fast (restarts needed to see them all aside), but each one manages to introduce something new to learn and deal with. The first level is a good introduction, giving you enough time to practice the physics and enough healing items to stay alive long enough for said practice, all the while not pulling too many punches with regard to hazard density, giving you a proper taste of what’s to come. The second level starts preparing you to learn how to react on the fly via an onslaught of sharks that either pop out from below you or jump in an arc to catch you by surprise. The third level uses thunderclouds as a means of throwing persistent long-range attacks at you, so not only do you have to learn to dodge attacks that extend beyond something’s body, you also have to learn how to keep dodging them in situations where the screen doesn’t scroll past them right away. Levels four and five are where they really ratchet things up before the final boss I mentioned before; these levels force you into a very tight corridor filled with lava that loves to spring stalagmites and stalactites on you out of nowhere while also introducing new enemies like these giant eyeballs that home in on your position. Once you get the hang of the basics, these levels are the ones bound to give you the most trouble in ways that don’t always feel fair on your first attempt. Seriously, those stalagmites and stalactites appear extremely fast and take up most of the screen, making them the kind of thing that’s hard to deal with until you’ve memorized their locations. Each level manages to have a theme and give you something new to deal with while making sure you don’t forget about past challenges, which are both things conducive to good, educational level design. As long as you don’t mind the need for practice and memorization, which are things common to arcade games and games styled like them and are absolutely valid things to implement into your game, you’ll appreciate the steady climb in challenge here.\n\nI do wish they were a little more varied in terms of presentation, though. The first three levels all have a general shared aesthetic of “pretty sky above an ocean that rotates in a circular fashion” and only make changes to the time of day to go along with the hazards introduced. Levels four and five change it up, but they both do the “lava-filled tunnel” thing, so there’s really only 2-3 kinds of environments depending on how generous you want to be. There aren’t many enemy types, but I actually really like how they all look because of how they straddle the line between goofy and dangerous. The first enemy type you encounter is a weird pufferfish-like thing that definitely looks painful, but there’s something oddly kinda cute about it, too. There are these flying fish-like creatures that don’t actually appear to mean you harm and don’t look particularly intimidating at all. You still get hurt if you bump into them, but at least they don’t act or look malicious. It’s nice to have some denizens of Gaia that just look like they’re living their best lives, giving the world a bit more flavor, you know? As you get deeper into things, the enemies become more intimidating, with the fire bats and the eyeballs looking like they came out of a Castlevania or something, which is pretty cool and a good way of signifying just how far from home you are. The visuals do a great job of depicting a land with lots of hidden depth, between the endless ocean at the bottom of the screen and the strange castle that looks like it has a tongue sticking out of it in the background that you never go to, but they do nothing with these teases. They also don’t do anything with the top screen aside from the sky and your minimalist HUD, which seems like a wasted opportunity. Having to weave between both screens or deal with massive threats would have been super cool, not to mention a good way of flexing the team’s past experience with games like Chronos Twin. There’s a lot of potential in the world of Gaia even from this short 15 minute or so experience, so it’s a shame that so much of it is left to the imagination in an unsatisfying way. I suppose this kind of game isn’t really about telling a story or depicting a world and the game is clearly designed to be a bite sized arcade-adjacent experience, but doing so would have been yet another hook in its favor. It was already taking some steps towards standing out thanks to it having a narrative at all, so I think it would have been nice to see an alternate take on this game that feels like a broader journey. Kinda sounds like something that would work really well on Apple Arcade, now that I think about it…\n\nWhile Gaia’s Moon is quaint by most standards then and now, it was a good fit for its particular platform and is a solidly built game that executes on its intent successfully. Though DSiWare was getting long in the tooth by 2012 (smartphones picking up steam around the late 2000s-early 2010s surely didn’t help either), it originally set out with the intent of providing a space for developers to come up with creative bite sized games and, intentionally or not, fostered an environment that required frugality and practicality to succeed in. A strict size limit of 16 MB meant that you really had to boil your game down to its most essential parts and come into things with a clear statement of intent without lacking the eye candy needed to draw in someone casually browsing the eShop. EnjoyUp makes it clear though their design chops that Gaia’s Moon was meant to be a companion piece to your daily commute or whatever and not necessarily your next obsession. Bring it with you, find a moment to pop it on, do a quick run, have fun, and move on with your life. If you get on a roll, maybe it’ll make your commute fly by, or if things go poorly, maybe it’ll serve as a sign that you need to take a break and do something else, which is useful in its own right. It may not have extra modes and other bells and whistles, but considering that the asking price was only $2 (or 200 points, rather), that seems exceptionally fair. To me, that’s the exact function that the flash games it draws from served as well. Whenever I was fortunate enough to be in a classroom with computers and had an opportunity, such as finishing my work early or just feeling a little spicy knowing all the teachers saw me as one of “the good kids” so I could get away with the occasional treat, I’d go to a flash game website and play whatever new things they had. Sometimes, those things would catch on with the class, but other times, they’d be brief fancies born purely out of curiosity and nothing more. That doesn’t mean they were bad, it just means they only needed to keep me busy for a handful of minutes in order to serve their “purpose”. With how every game nowadays wants to be your One Game to Rule Them All, it’s easy to forget that there’s absolutely nothing wrong with a flight of fancy and that there’s no obligation to make every game a commitment. In that sense, Gaia’s Moon is a good way to remind yourself of the sheer range of experiences that a video game can provide. So, go ahead: if this post got you interested, find a way to play it, give it any amount of time, and then move on whenever you’ve had your fill. Your experience, no matter what it may be, is valid, and it’s as simple as that!\n\nMore Screenshots\n\nSources:\n\nElisa Day. “Helicopter Game by SeeThru.co.uk (Classic Flash Game) Playthrough.” YouTube, 20 Nov. 2022, http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-YaeTwkIS0o.\n\nk, merritt. “The Shrouded Origins of the Helicopter Game.” Other Strangeness — Merritt K, 29 Sept. 2022, http://www.otherstrangeness.com/2022/09/29/the-shrouded-origins-of-the-helicopter-game/.\n\nWorld of Longplays. “Nintendo DS Longplay [158] Chronos Twin (EU).” YouTube, 28 Mar. 2023, http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCbCB-6hZIU.\n\nWorld of Longplays. “Nintendo DS Longplay [144] Little Red Riding Hood’s Zombie BBQ (US).” YouTube, 21 Mar. 2023, http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q5r0XGmF85A.\n\nFollow Me ON:\n\nCohost: https://cohost.org/EphemeralEnigmas\n\nBackloggd: https://www.backloggd.com/u/EphemeralEnigmas/\n\nBluesky: https://bsky.app/profile/ephemeralenigmas.bsky.social\n\nRetroAchievements: https://retroachievements.org/user/sb191219\n\nAugust 2024 (2)\n\nJuly 2024 (5)\n\nJune 2024 (4)\n\nMay 2024 (4)\n\nApril 2024 (5)\n\nMarch 2024 (4)\n\nFebruary 2024 (4)\n\nJanuary 2024 (5)\n\nDecember 2023 (4)\n\nNovember 2023 (4)\n\nOctober 2023 (5)\n\nSeptember 2023 (4)\n\nAugust 2023 (5)\n\nJuly 2023 (4)\n\nJune 2023 (4)\n\nMay 2023 (5)\n\nApril 2023 (4)\n\nMarch 2023 (4)\n\nFebruary 2023 (4)\n\nJanuary 2023 (5)\n\nDecember 2022 (4)\n\nNovember 2022 (5)\n\nOctober 2022 (4)\n\nSeptember 2022 (4)\n\nAugust 2022 (5)\n\nJuly 2022 (4)\n\nJune 2022 (4)\n\nMay 2022 (5)\n\nApril 2022 (4)\n\nMarch 2022 (5)\n\nFebruary 2022 (4)\n\nJanuary 2022 (4)"
