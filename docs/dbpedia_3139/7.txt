Little Red Riding Hood's Zombie BBQ never made it to retail in Europe, instead being released as a DSiWare download. Even though it did come out on a cartridge in North America, EnjoyUp is releasing the DSiWare version anyway, giving Zombie BBQ the unique honor of being available both digitally and in a box.

Said DSiWare release will occur next Monday, December 13. Look forward to having two convenient options for fulfilling your Red Riding Hood-blasting-the-undead needs. Check out an oddly windowed trailer after the break.
