        "text": "The Florida court system is comprised of the Supreme Court, six district courts of appeal, 20 circuit courts and 67 county courts. Each layer of the Florida judicial system has a distinct role in providing justice across the state.\n\nThe Office of the State Courts Administrators (OSCA) is the administrative arm of the Florida Supreme Court. The office was formed in 1972, the result of Article V of the state constitution which sought to bring greater consistency and uniformity to the judicial branch.\n\nRead about the Mission & Vision of the Florida court system.\n\nCourt System Organization & Structure\n\nAppellate Courts:\n\nSupreme Court\n\nThe highest appellate court in Florida, the Florida Supreme Court’s 150+ years span a time when the state was the least populated (1845) to the present (2022) when it ranks third nationwide. Decisions stemming from Florida’s highest court have helped shape the state itself and also the nation.\n\nDistrict Courts of Appeal\n\nThere are currently six District Courts of Appeal in Florida, located respectively in Tallahassee, Tampa, Miami, West Palm Beach, Daytona Beach, and Lakeland. As a general rule, decisions of the district courts of appeal represent the final appellate review of litigated cases.\n\nTrial Courts:\n\nTrial Courts - Circuit\n\nThere are 20 judicial circuits in the Florida court system. Circuit courts have general trial jurisdiction over matters not assigned by statute to the county courts and also hear appeals from county court cases. Some circuits are made up of multiple counties.\n\nTrial Courts – County\n\nThe Florida Constitution establishes that there is ONE county court in each of Florida’s 67 counties. The county courts are sometimes referred to as \"the people's courts,\" as a large portion of the courts' work involves a myriad of civil disputes, such as traffic offenses, less serious criminal matters (misdemeanors), and relatively small monetary disputes."
