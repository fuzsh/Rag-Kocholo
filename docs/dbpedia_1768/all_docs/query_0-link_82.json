        "text": "Federal legislative power consists of the House of Commons and the Senate. Each level of government adopts laws according to their powers, that is, the categories of subjects for which they are responsible. The division of powers between the federal and provincial governments is set out in the Constitution Act, 1867, in section 91.\n\nThe federal legislative power consists of two chambers:\n\nthe Senate, made up of senators appointed by the government, and\n\nthe House of Commons, made up of Members of Parliament elected by the Canadian population.\n\nThe judiciary is represented by the courts and has the function of resolving conflicts related to laws. It consists of courts of federal and provincial jurisdiction, and is completely independent of the legislative and executive powers.\n\nStructure of the courts in Canada\n\nThe Canadian judicial system includes courts created by both the provincial and federal levels of government, each with a well-defined mission.\n\nOn the provincial side, there are:\n\nTrial-level courts\n\nSuperior courts\n\nAppellate courts\n\nFederal Court structure includes:\n\nThe Supreme Court of Canada\n\nThe Federal Court\n\nThe Federal Court of Appeal\n\nThe Tax Court of Canada\n\nThe Court Martial Appeal Court of Canada\n\nThere are also administrative tribunals at both the provincial and federal levels. They are not part of the judicial system as such, but are often considered to be quasi-judicial because they engage in fact-finding and have the power to impact personal rights. Administrative tribunals are independent government organizations that play an important role in resolving administrative conflicts.\n\nDepending on the type of litigation involved, individuals will be referred to one or another of these courts\n\nHowever, there are many other ways to resolve a dispute without going through the courts.\n\nWho appoints judges?\n\nThe federal government appoints judges to the federal courts, the superior courts of the provinces/territories, and the Supreme Court of Canada, while the provincial and territorial governments appoint judges to provincial and territorial courts.\n\nThe Canadian Judicial Council is responsible for federally appointed judges only."
