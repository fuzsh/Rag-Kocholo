In this lesson, students learn the basics of our judicial system, including the functions of the trial court, the Court of Appeals, and the Supreme Court. Students learn how a case moves up through these levels and discover that these courts exist on both the state and federal levels.iCivics en español! Student and class materials for this lesson are available in Spanish.\n\nThe Courts in a Nutshell\n\nIn this WebQuest, students look at all levels of both the state and federal court systems.

Madison (1803)\n\nThis mini-lesson covers the basics of the Supreme Court’s decision that affirmed the Court’s power of judicial review. Students learn how Congress tried to add to the Supreme Court’s Constitutional power, how the Supreme Court rejected the idea that it has any power beyond what’s listed in the Constitution, and how the Court’s exercise of judicial review in this case made the judicial branch equal to the other two branches. Students then learn that even when the Supreme Court declares a law unconstitutional, Congress has options for moving the law forward.\n\nTrial and Appeal (Infographic)\n\nMost cases start and end in trial court, but what if there's an error?

Who gets to do it? In this WebQuest, students explore the answers to these questions and more. Using examples from the First and Eighth Amendments, students try their own hand at interpreting sticky situations—and compare their findings to actual Supreme Court opinions.** This WebQuest was formerly called “You Be the Judge.” It has been updated to offer students a deeper look at the Supreme Court's role interpreting the Constitution and to better complement our lesson “Interpreting the Constitution.” You do not…\n\nArgument Wars Extension Pack\n\nMake your students’ game play more meaningful by using our activity and assessment set designed specifically for Argument Wars. This easy-to-use Extension Pack helps you give context and purpose to the game, as well as reinforce and assess the game concepts. That means deeper learning for students, and best practices around game-centered learning for you!\n\nAppellate Courts: Let's Take It Up\n\nStudents learn the purpose of appellate-level courts and how those courts operate differently from the trial courts most people are familiar with from watching television. By following the case of a real middle school girl who was strip searched at school, students find out what happens when someone takes a case all the way to the Supreme Court. Through this case, students learn about the structure of the federal court system and the way appellate courts decide cases.\n\nThe Courts in a Nutshell\n\nIn this WebQuest, students look at all levels of both the state and federal court systems. They learn about jurisdiction, look up the courts in their own state, find out what federal appellate circuit they live in, and investigate the current U.S. Supreme Court justices.\n\nDouble Take: The Dual Court System\n\nDoes your state court system feel oddly similar to our federal one? Chances are it does, but there may still be some differences. In this lesson, students learn how our country came to have a dual court system and explore how the state and federal levels of that system work. But wait, there's more!

This lesson outlines the types of speech the First Amendment does and does not protect. Students also examine the Supreme Court’s rulings regarding hate speech in five historic cases. After analyzing the decisions, students apply the Court’s reasoning to the issue of student speech codes on college campuses. The lesson also serves as springboard for a class discussion on these controversial questions: Do speech codes violate students’ First Amendment rights? Should public colleges allow hate groups to recruit on campus?"
