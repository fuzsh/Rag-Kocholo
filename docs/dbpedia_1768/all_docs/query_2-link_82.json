        "text": "Senior Inspectors, Deputy Marshals, and Court Security Officers provide security for federal court facilities in each of the 94 judicial districts and 12 circuits of the U.S. Court of Appeals. The U.S. Marshals Service protects more than 2,700 sitting judges and approximately 30,300 federal prosecutors and court officials, along with members of the public who visit and work in federal courthouses nationwide.\n\nJudicial Security Division manages contracts for over 5,600 Court Security Officers, maintains more than 1,600 residential security systems in judges' personal residences, and as the physical security provider to over 800 federal facilities, the U.S. Marshals Service develops, manages, and implements security systems and screening equipment that protect each courthouse.\n\nExplicit threats and inappropriate communications against the judiciary, U.S. Attorneys, and other court officers are assessed to determine the level of danger.\n\nIn fiscal year 2022, the U.S. Marshals Service investigated 1,362 threats and potential threats to protected persons.\n\nToday's threat landscape is more complex than ever before with high-threat environments resulting from terrorism and organized crime. To combat these, U.S. Marshals Service judicial security personnel provide a 360 degrees safe-haven with state-of the-art protective techniques and equipment in all phases of court proceedings, threat situations, and judicial conferences.\n\nThe latest in investigative techniques as well as cutting-edge protective operations ensure rapid and safe responses in emergency situations as well as unobtrusive surveillance and protection during routine judicial security operations.\n\nThe United States Marshals Service is the preeminent expert on facility security. The Court Security Program ensures the protection of the federal judicial process through screening and protection at all federal court facilities. The program ensures the day-to-day security of all those who participate in the federal judicial process, including members of the public.\n\nThe agency is dedicated to this responsibility through strategic development, implementation, and enhancements of the nationwide Court Security Officer (CSO) program, which consists of more than 5,600 contractors. The Court Security Officer is typically the first line of interior defense for the \"Third Branch\" of the United States Government.\n\nCurrently, four companies hold Court Security Officers contracts with the U.S. Marshals Services:\n\nWalden Security\n\nParagon Systems\n\nCenterra Group\n\nAPSI-Centerra"
