        "text": "Accessibility for Persons with Disabilities\n\nAccess to the DC Courts\n\nIt is the intent of the DC Courts to provide access to services, programs, and activities that are offered by the DC Courts to any qualified participant, applicant, or member of the public with a disability, upon reasonable notice (when necessary) and without requiring action which would result in a fundamental alteration in the nature of a service, program, or activity or in undue financial or administrative burden. You can contact the ADA Coordinator at ADACoordinator [at] dcsc.gov (ADACoordinator[at]dcsc[dot]gov).\n\nWebsite Accessibility\n\nThe DC Courts' website was developed for persons who are interested in the District of Columbia Courts. We strive to make it as accessible as possible and keep that goal in mind when developing web pages and adding content. Also, our Information Technology Division periodically tests the website, using on-line accessibility tools, to help ensure that it continues to meet accessibility standards. If you encounter any difficulties or have any comments or feedback, please send an email to us at webmaster [at] dcsc.gov (webmaster[at]dcsc[dot]gov) We will consider all suggestions for improvement and make whatever changes are reasonably possible. We appreciate your input.\n\nSafety & Security\n\nThe United States Marshals Service, with the assistance of Court Security Officers (CSO), is responsible for keeping the District of Columbia Courts a safe and secure environment for all. Every person entering the DC Courts is subject to search. Handheld possessions are subject to search and inspection. Dangerous items will be confiscated. Weapons are prohibited and will be confiscated.\n\nAll persons entering the courthouse are asked to:\n\nEmpty their pockets and place the contents in a container for X-ray scanning.\n\nPlace overcoats on the belt of the X-ray scanning machine. Possessions should be left in the coat pockets.\n\nPlace purses, briefcases, backpacks, and parcels on the X-ray machine.\n\nWalk through the metal detector.\n\nIf the x-ray or metal detector sets off an alert or alarm, a CSO may perform another scan, using a hand-held wand. The CSO also may conduct a physical search of personal articles to determine the cause of the alert or alarm.\n\nThere are a variety of potentially hazardous and dangerous items that are not permitted inside court facilities. In general, items that could be used to injure or harm another person are not permitted. If in doubt about an item, do not bring it to court. Swiss Army Knives and other pocket knives are among the prohibited items. The DC Courtsâ€™ Weapons policy can be found here.\n\nBefore leaving the security screening area, persons entering the courthouse should be sure to retrieve all personal possessions."
