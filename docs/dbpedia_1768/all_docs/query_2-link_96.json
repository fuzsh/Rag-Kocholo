The act established a three-part judiciary—made up of district courts, circuit courts, and the Supreme Court—and outlined the structure and jurisdiction of each branch.\n\nThe Judiciary Act of 1789, officially titled “An Act to Establish the Judicial Courts of the United States,” was principally authored by Senators Oliver Ellsworth and William Paterson and signed into law by Pres. George Washington on September 24, 1789. The act’s creators, by essentially all accounts, viewed it as a work in progress. Although indeed amended throughout the years, the basic outline it provided has remained largely intact.\n\n(Read John Kennedy’s Britannica entry on Oliver Ellsworth.)\n\nThe act divided the country into districts with one court and one judge in each, along with attorneys responsible for civil and criminal actions in their districts. The act also created the office of attorney general of the United States; the attorney general, a member of the cabinet, is appointed by the president and is head of the Department of Justice.\n\nCircuit courts—which make up the middle tier of the federal court system—were created to serve as principal trial courts. They also exercise limited appellate jurisdiction. A local district judge and two Supreme Court justices preside over the circuit courts."
