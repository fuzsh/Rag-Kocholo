        "text": "Learn how courts are organized in Virginia, what the different courts do, how cases are brought to and heard in local courts, and how judges are appointed in Virginia.\n\nWhat are courts?\n\nCourts are part of the judicial branch of government and responsible for interpreting laws when a law is broken or there is a dispute. Courts hear criminal, civil, juvenile, domestic, and traffic cases.\n\nHow are courts organized in Virginia?\n\nThe Supreme Court of Virginia is one of the oldest continuous judicial bodies in the United States. Its roots are deep in the English legal system, dating to the early seventeenth century as part of the Charter of 1606 under which Jamestown, the first permanent English settlement in North America, was established. In 1623, the Virginia House of Burgesses created a five-man appellate court which met quarterly to hear appeals from the lower courts. At the close of the Revolutionary War, the court system was reorganized.\n\nToday, the system includes four levels of courts: the Supreme Court, the Court of Appeals, the Circuit Courts, and the District Courts. In addition, magistrates serve as judicial officers with authority to issue various types of processes. In Juvenile & Domestic Relations (J&DR) District Courts, intake officers serve as officers of the court with authority set forth in Virginia law.\n\nVirginia’s judicial system is represented in the figure below:\n\nThere are 32 judicial districts in Virginia and every city and county in Virginia has a General District Court and a J&DR District Court. Shown in the map below are Virginia’s judicial circuits and districts.\n\nMost cases enter Virginia’s judicial system through magistrates who determine whether there is probable cause to believe an offense has been committed. In juvenile courts, most cases enter through intake officers who review complaints and determine whether there are enough facts to involve the court.\n\nGeneral District Courts have authority in matters related to juveniles and to domestic relations. The term “domestic relations” refers to family relationships.\n\nAs the name suggests, Juvenile and Domestic Relations District Courts have authority in matters related to juveniles and to domestic relations. The term “domestic relations” refers to family relationships.\n\nDecisions in District Courts – both General and J&DR – may be appealed to the Circuit Court.\n\nCircuit Courts hear criminal cases involving more serious offenses, called felonies, civil actions involving larger monetary claims, and appeals from District Courts.\n\nThe Court of Appeals hears appeals of decisions of Circuit Courts and cases from certain state agencies.\n\nThe Supreme Court of Virginia eviews decisions of the Court of Appeals and lower courts and handles matters related to the operation of Virginia’s judicial system.\n\nWhat does a magistrate do?\n\nThe main job of the magistrate is to provide an independent, unbiased review of complaints brought to the office by police officers, sheriffs, deputies, and citizens and determine whether there is probable cause for a warrant or summons to be issued. “Probable cause” is a reasonable belief based on facts that would cause a reasonable person to feel that the accused committed the offense.\n\nMagistrates can issue arrest warrants, summonses, bonds, search warrants, subpoenas, and civil warrants. Another important duty is to conduct bond hearings to set bail in instances in which an individual is charged with a criminal offense. A magistrate may also accept prepayments for traffic infractions and minor misdemeanors.\n\nWhat does an intake officer do?\n\nJ&DR District Court intake officers receive and review complaints and determine whether there are enough facts to involve the court. They are authorized to handle cases informally or may authorize filing a petition to bring the matter before the judge. They are also authorized to detain juveniles when necessary. Intake officers do not handle criminal charges against adults that come into the juvenile court; these go through the magistrate.\n\nHow do General District Courts operate?\n\nThere is a General District Court in every city and county in Virginia. A General District Court decides all criminal offenses involving ordinances, laws, and by-laws of the county or city in which it is located and all misdemeanors under state law. A misdemeanor is any charge which carries a penalty of no more than one year in jail or a fine of up to $2,500, or both.\n\nGeneral District Courts do not conduct jury trials. All cases are heard by a judge. Each defendant in a criminal case is presumed innocent until proven guilty beyond a reasonable doubt. Upon consideration of evidence, the judge first decides the question of guilt or innocence. If the defendant is found guilty, the judge then determines the penalty. The Code of Virginia defines criminal offenses and the range of penalties to be imposed.\n\nGeneral District Courts also decide civil cases in which the amount in question does not exceed $25,000, except in personal injury and wrongful death cases where the amount can be up to $50,000. Civil cases vary from lawsuits for damages sustained in automobile accidents to lawsuits by creditors to receive payment on past due debts. Claims of less than $5,000 are sometimes heard in what is referred to as “small claims court.”\n\nTraffic cases are also heard in General District Courts. In addition to any fine that the judge imposes, those convicted of certain traffic violations will have “points” assessed against their driver’s licenses by the Virginia Department of Motor Vehicles (DMV). Excessive points can result in a license being suspended or revoked.\n\nGeneral District Courts also hold preliminary hearings in felony cases (that is, any charge that may be punishable by more than one year in jail). These hearings are held to determine whether there is sufficient evidence to justify holding the defendant for a grand jury hearing. The grand jury determines whether the accused will be indicted and held for trial in the Circuit Court.\n\nFrom January 2024 to April 2024, there were 776,760 case filings in the Virginia General District Courts. (See https://www.vacourts.gov/courtadmin/aoc/djs/programs/cpss/csi/stats/district/cms/2024/gcms1001_apr.pdf).\n\nDecisions in a General District Court may be appealed to the Circuit Court. Cases appealed to the Circuit Court are reheard de novo. This means that cases are heard as completely new cases; all evidence is reheard and a decision is made based on the evidence.\n\nHow do Juvenile and Domestic Relations District Courts operate?\n\nIt is important to understand that J&DR District Courts differ from other courts. The welfare of the juvenile and the family, the safety of the community, and the protection of the rights of victims are the highest concern in the court’s proceedings. In addition to protecting the public and holding juvenile offenders accountable for their actions, J&DR Courts have a duty to protect the confidentiality and privacy of juveniles coming before the court and a commitment to rehabilitate those who come before the court. Because of the confidentiality laws, the clerk’s office can only provide limited information about a case and then only to those people involved with the case. In other respects, J&DR Courts generally have the same requirements and provide the same safeguards as other courts. This court does not, however, conduct jury trials. All cases are heard by a judge.\n\nJ&DR Courts in Virginia handle cases involving:\n\njuvenile delinquency and status offenses;\n\njuveniles accused of traffic violations;\n\nchildren in need of services or supervision;\n\nchildren who have been subjected to abuse or neglect;\n\nadults accused of child abuse or neglect, or of offenses against members of their own family or household members (juvenile or adult);\n\nadults involved in disputes concerning the visitation, support, or custody of a child;\n\nspousal support;\n\nabandonment of children;\n\nfoster care and entrustment agreements;\n\ncourt-ordered rehabilitation services; and\n\ncourt consent for certain medical treatments.\n\nIn Virginia,\n\na juvenile is any person under 18 years of age.\n\na delinquent is a juvenile who has committed an act which would be a crime if committed by an adult.\n\na status offender is a juvenile who has committed certain actions which, if committed by adults, would not be considered criminal offenses – such as a curfew violation.\n\na child in need of supervision is one who engages in truancy or habitually runs away from home.\n\na child in need of services is one whose behavior, conduct, or condition poses a risk of harm to himself or herself or to another person.\n\nChild abuse and neglect cases involve the improper care or injurious handling of juveniles.\n\nDecisions in a J&DR Court may be appealed to the Circuit Court. Cases appealed to the Circuit Court are reheard de novo. This means that cases are heard as completely new cases; all evidence is reheard and a decision is made based on the evidence. In 2024, there were 146,592 case filings in the J&DR Court from January 2024 to April 2024.\n\nWhat does a Circuit Court do?\n\nCircuit Courts have jurisdiction over the following:\n\nCivil actions:\n\nexclusive original jurisdiction in claims exceeding $25,000 (or exceeding $50,000 in personal injury and wrongful death cases); concurrent jurisdiction with General District Courts in claims over $4,500 but not exceeding $25,000, with certain exceptions.\n\nCriminal cases:\n\nall felonies, and offenses that may be punished by commitment to the state prison\n\nmisdemeanor charges originating from a grand jury indictment\n\ntransfer or certification of felony offenses committed by juveniles\n\nAppeals:\n\nappeals from the General District Court or J&DR District Court\n\nappeals ffrom certain administrative agencies\n\nThe Circuit Court judge can convene a grand jury.\n\nDecisions of the Circuit Court may be appealed to the Virginia Court of Appeals. In 2023, there were 452,229 case filings in the Circuit Courts in Virginia. (See https://www.vacourts.gov/courtadmin/aoc/djs/programs/cpss/csi/stats/circuit/cr01monthly/2023/cr01_2023_dec.pdf).\n\nWhat are grand juries?\n\nGrand juries serve two purposes:\n\nto consider indictments prepared by the Commonwealth’s\n\nAttorney (the grand jury determines whether there is probable cause to believe that the person accused has committed the crime charged in the indictment and should stand trial), and\n\nto investigate and report concerning any condition which\n\ninvolves or tends to promote criminal activity, either in the community or by any governmental authority, agency, or official. The grand jury has subpoena powers and may summon persons, documents, or records needed in its investigation.\n\nThe grand jury hears only the commonwealth’s side of the case and does not determine the guilt or innocence of the accused.\n\nA regular grand jury is composed of five to seven citizens of the city or county in which the Circuit Court is located; it is convened at each term of the court to consider indictments prepared by the Commonwealth’s Attorney (the grand jury determines whether there is probable cause to believe that the person accused has committed the crime charged in the indictment and should stand trial).\n\nMembers of the grand jury must\n\nbe citizens of Virginia at least 18 years of age,\n\nhave been residents of the state for at least one year, and\n\nhave been residents of the county or city in which they are to serve for at least six months.\n\nCitizens selected by the Circuit Court judge are to be “of honesty, intelligence, and good demeanor.”\n\nA special grand jury is composed of seven to 11 citizens and is summoned by the Circuit Court to investigate and report any condition which involves or tends to promote criminal activity, either in the community or by any governmental authority, agency, or official thereof. A special grand jury may be impanelled by the Circuit Court (1) at any time upon the court’s own motion, or (2) upon the recommendation of a minority of the members of a regular grand jury. A special grand jury must be impanelled upon the recommendation of a majority of the members of a regular grand jury. A special grand jury may also be impanelled at the request of the Commonwealth’s Attorney.\n\nThe qualifications for members of a special grand jury are the same as for a regular grand jury.\n\nWhat does the Court of Appeals do in Virginia?\n\nThe Court of Appeals of Virginia provides for review of decisions of the Circuit Courts in traffic infractions, in criminal cases, and in Circuit Court cases involving domestic relations matters. The Court of Appeals also hears appeals from administrative agencies and the Virginia Workers’ Compensation Commission. Decisions of the Court of Appeals can be appealed to the Supreme Court of Virginia.\n\nIn 2021, the number of judges in the Virginia Court of Appeals increased to 17. The Court sits at locations designated by the chief judge so as to provide convenient access to the various geographic areas of the Commonwealth. The court sits in panels of at least three judges, and the membership of the panels is rotated.\n\nIn 2022, there were 1,971 cases filed in the Virginia Court of Appeals.\n\nWhat does the Supreme Court of Virginia do?\n\nThe primary function of the Supreme Court of Virginia is to review decisions of lower courts. Other cases also handled by the Supreme Court include those involving corporations, the conduct of attorneys and judges, and the performance of other public officials. Following 2022, nearly all civil parties and criminal defendants have a right to a full appeal before the Court of Appeals, without having to obtain permission.\n\nIn 2022, there were 846 petitions filed and 76 cases decided (either by opinion or order) in the Supreme Court of Virginia. (https://www.vacourts.gov/courtadmin/aoc/djs/programs/cpss/csi/stats/scv/scv_caseload_rpt_2022.pdf)\n\nHow does someone become a judge in Virginia?\n\nThe judges of Virginia’s District Courts are elected by a majority vote of each chamber of the General Assembly for terms of six years. Vacancies in District Court judgeships occurring when the General Assembly is not in session are temporarily filled by the Circuit Court judges of the corresponding circuit until the General Assembly is back in session.\n\nThe judges of Virginia’s Circuit Courts are elected by a majority vote of both chambers of the General Assembly for terms of eight years. The governor makes interim appointments when the General Assembly is not in session, but these appointments are subject to confirmation by the General Assembly at the next regular session.\n\nThe 17 Court of Appeals judges are elected and receive interim appointments in the same manner as the Circuit Court judges. They serve a term of eight years. The chief judge is elected by a vote of the 17 judges for a term of four years.\n\nThe Supreme Court of Virginia is composed of seven justices elected by a majority vote of each chamber of the General Assembly for a term of 12 years. Interim appointments are made by the governor subject to confirmation by the General Assembly at the next regular session. As prescribed by law, the Chief Justice is chosen by the majority vote of the seven justices.\n\nWhat are drug courts?\n\nIn Virginia, drug courts are not separate courts but are specialized court dockets within the existing structure of the court system. Those convicted in drug and drug-related cases are closely monitored and strictly supervised while they undergo intensive treatment for drug addiction."
