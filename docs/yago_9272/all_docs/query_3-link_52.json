        "text": "Born February 16, 1945, died peacefully October 1, 2011, surrounded by her family after living with Alzheimer’s disease for ten years. Born in Duncan, BC, she chose Victoria as a home for most of her life. Alison received her Bachelor Degree of Science in Botany from the University of Victoria in 1969 and remained an avid gardener and lover of all plants and animals. She was also very active in the local folk music singing community and was a voracious reader. She had a special connection to the outdoors, particularly her beloved Thetis lsland, a love that she shared with her family. She was predeceased by her parents, Lorna and Jim and is survived by her sister, Di; her brother-in-law, John; her husband, Tom and his sister, Maureen and her daughters, Lorna and Emily. Alison was a loving mother, affectionate friend, and an integral part of the Winton St. and Union Rd. neighbourhood. The family would like to particularly thank the support workers at Kiwanis Pavilion, the nurses on 4B South at Victoria General Hospital and Alison’s honourary daughter, Jen.\n\nA Celebration of Alison’s life will be held on Thursday, October 6th at 1:00 pm at St. Peter’s Anglican Church, 3939 St. Peter’s Rd, Victoria, BC. The family asks that in lieu of flowers, donations be made to the Oak Bay Kiwanis Pavilion, 3034 Cedar Hill Road, Victoria, BC V8T 3J3 and that those attending the service feel free to wear bright clothing. Condolences may be offered to the family at www.mccallbros.com."
