Connie also leaves to mourn a large extended family and group of friends on Shea Heights, Bell Island and beyond; too many to mention individually, but know she loved you all. Special thanks to Kearney Druken who was there with Mom at the end; we will be forever grateful for all you did to help keep her with us.\n\nConnie had a big heart, and always celebrated life devoting time to her family and friends, throughout good times but also in the hardships. She was there for all that knew her and she will be missed more than words could ever say.\n\nA funeral mass will be held for the family on Friday, October 9th, 2020 at 10:30 a.m. from St. John Bosco and is by invitation only. Interment will follow at Holy Sepulchre Cemetery."
