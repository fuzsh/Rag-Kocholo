        "text": "TO BE EDITED\n\nOrigins\n\nOriginally called the Johannesburg Repertory Theatre (popularly known as the Reps' Theatre), it was a 550 seater space in a Scandinavian design, which opened in Stiemens Street, Braamfontein as the permanent home of the Johannesburg Repertory Society (Johannesburg Reps) in November 1951.\n\nThe Alexander Theatre\n\nIn 1960 it was renamed the Alexander Theatre, in honour of Muriel Alexander the founder and longtime driving-force behind the Johannesburg Repertory Society (Johannesburg REPS) and the construction of the original theatre. This was done in an effort to eradicate the stigma attached to amateur theatre. The theatre was thereafter often used for professional work by the REPS’s own company as well as other companies. It was later leased by PACT and professional companies for their productions, including The Cherry Orchard (PACT, 1962), **** In 1978*? it finally sold the theatre the Arts Council who proceeded to use it as their Johannesburg base, alongside the Windybrow Theatre, but also letting it to other companies. ****EXPAND*** The Alexander finally closed in the 1990s with Ipi Thombi and by 1997 it was not being used anymore and fell into disrepair. In 2006 it was purchased and revamped by entrepreneur Adam Levy, as part of the urban revival process in Braamfontein spearheaded by Levy.
