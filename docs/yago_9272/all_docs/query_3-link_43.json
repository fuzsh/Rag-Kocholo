        "text": "Celebrating 10 years of university teaching. My path to become a lecturer is a bit long winded. In 2011 I was offered a teaching position at FPT university but turned down due to burnout from the previous research project. I thought I wanted nothing to do with university anymore. Then somehow I ended up doing a PhD in 2013 and started teaching at Griffith University then. Being a university teacher in my 20s came with a lot of insecurity, especially when your students were often mistaken you as an undergrad friend. I remember trying to dress up and do make up to look older and more mature. But despite all my efforts, the first semester went terribly. I cried with my supervisor Prof Michelle Whitford after reading the student evaluation, and she told me calmly that it was all part of the process: I just need to try again. So I tried. 4 universities in Australia, Denmark and Vietnam with countless training, experiments, sleepless nights and the occasional sickness. I learnt to enjoy teaching so much more, and became confident enough to not bother wearing makeup or dress formally sometimes in class. I owe all this to my kind supervisors Prof Michelle Whitford, prof Dianne Dredge, PhD, prof Helene Balslev Clausen and Prof Sacha Reid along with many other colleages, who always supported and cheered me on. And above all, the thousands of students who were willing to go along with all the activities I dreamed up in the classroom and in field trips, and for them to take their learning so far ahead in their career and in daily life. It takes 10 years to start seeing the impact I'm making. And still I am the same dreamer who believes that a good teacher can change the world, one student at a time. Happy Vietnamese teacher's day. #transformativeeducation"
