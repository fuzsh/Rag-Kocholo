        "text": "First episode: February 25 1980\n\nLast episode: February 19 2013\n\nby Paul Balsillie (updated text, originally from LAUGH MAGAZINE #22, 2001)\n\nIn 1972 writer Antony Jay attended a Civil Service College lecture given by Barbara Castle. During the proceedings he was introduced to the idea that there is a ‘ministry policy’ as opposed to a ‘minister’s policy’. Thus sprang the idea for a sitcom about a minister and a civil servant. Several years earlier Jay had recognized the comic potential of verbose ministerial speeches while contributing to The Frost Report (in fact some of this material actually resurfaced as dialogue for Sir Humphrey).\n\nMany years later Jonathan Lynn, Cambridge Footlights alumnus and by now a sitcom writer, was introduced to Jay by John Cleese. The two agreed to collaborate on a script – Jay bringing his knowledge of politics and civil servants and Lynn his comic brain and experience in sitcoms. The pair wrote a pilot called Open Government, which concerned the election of a new Minister For Administrative Affairs, who soon begins to wonder who is really in charge – the elected representative or the civil servant. As Lynn put it, it was a Jeeves and Wooster concept in which ‘the servant is cleverer than his master’.\n\nThe script broke new sitcom ground, especially for the late 1970’s, in that the plot was not centred around domestic relationships and the audience was invited to think, not just watch. From the beginning, Jay and Lynn had Paul Eddington, then famous as Jerry Leadbetter in The Good Life, in mind for the role of Jim Hacker MP and he was sent the script by producer John Howard Davies. Eddington liked what he read, but feared the political setting lacked the potential for success of his earlier series, and could be detrimental to his career.\n\nHis concern led to two more scripts being written, after which Eddington expressed interest in playing Sir Humphrey Appleby, the Jeeves-like civil servant who really runs the ministry and who always has the last line, ‘Yes, Minister.’ Jay and Lynn objected since they had written the ministerial part especially for him and pointed out that the Hacker character had a chance to grow, while Sir Humphrey would always remain the same.\n\nEddington eventually conceded and it turned out to be one of the best decisions of his career. In his autobiography So Far, So Good, he says, ‘When I think now how nearly I came to rejecting Yes Minister, my blood runs cold. I had not yet learnt the golden rule that no considerations, especially financial ones, should be placed above the quality of the work.’\n\nCharacter actors Nigel Hawthorne and Derek Fowlds were signed as Sir Humphrey Appleby, the Permanent Secretary and Bernard Woolley, the Principal Private Secretary. Also cast was Diana Hoddinott in the role of Annie Hacker, Jim’s wife.\n\nThe pilot was recorded on 4 February 1979 and went very well, but Eddington and Hawthorne were not impressed with the director Stuart Allen’s broad visual approach, acquired during four years of On the Buses. They felt close-ups of Diana Hoddinott’s behind while she scrambled around on the floor looking for a cigarette, out of place in this sort of show.\n\nThe BBC decided that they would commission a series, with the pilot as the first episode, but when the Labour government collapsed and Conservative Party leader Margaret Thatcher was elected as Britain’s Prime Minister on 3 May, the project was put on hold lest it be accused of party bias.\n\nOn 6 January 1980 filming resumed for a further six episodes, this time with director Sidney Lotterby. During rehearsals Eddington and Hawthorne fought to rid the script of gags. According to Eddington, “We both felt that it was a genuine situation comedy – the comedy lying in the situation rather than the jokes, verbal or visual, which could tend, we thought, to be a distraction.” A compromise was reached.\n\nThe first viewing figures for Yes Minister were not encouraging. Expecting at least six million viewers, it only managed a third of that figure, but by the second episode word of mouth had pushed it to the top of the ratings.\n\nIn 1981, the programme won the British Academy Award (BAFTA) for Best Comedy Series and Nigel Hawthorne won the award for best actor. In fact, Yes Minister won BAFTAs in1982 and 1983 as well, making it the first ever show to win three years in a row, with Nigel Hawthorne winning four times out of five seasons, only missing out in 1983.\n\nIn 1983 BBC Radio recorded the first of two eight-episode audio adaptations, featuring the original cast reprising their roles. Lynn and Jay’s scripts were reworked for radio by the producer Pete Atkin, though he was not ideally suited to the job. In the episode The Quality of Life Hacker is being interviewed by Selina Scott and is asked if the children can get autographs. He happily agrees, but is surprised when they all run to get her autograph. In order to describe this visual joke Atkin gave Bernard the line, ‘Couldn’t you get at least one of them to ask Jim for his autograph?” At no time throughout the series has Bernard referred to him as ‘Jim’. It was always as ‘Minister’ or ‘Prime Minister’.\n\nAfter three seasons Yes Minister ended in 1982, with real life P.M. Margaret Thatcher being a devoted fan of the series. In fact, when Mary Whitehouse’s National Viewers and Listener’s Association presented an award to Eddington, Hawthorne, Jay and Lynn on January 20 1984, Mrs. Thatcher was not only present, but decided to contribute and perform a specially-written script for the occasion. The two minute offering saw the P.M. summoning Hacker and Sir Humphrey to Downing Street for discussion on the merits of economics and economists.\n\nLater that year the real scriptwriters had a surprise for Mrs. Thatcher in return, when the B.B.C. screened a 60-minute Christmas special called Party Games, in which Hacker himself is miraculously elevated to the position of Prime Minister.\n\nIt wasn’t until January 1986 when the series proper returned, this time with a new title, Yes, Prime Minister. Sir Humphrey and Bernard have also moved to Number 10 and a new character, Dorothy Wainwright, threatens Sir Humphrey’s position of power. Though just as successful as the first series, only two seasons of eight episodes apiece were made before the characters retreated into television folklore.\n\nAfter the series ended Jonathan Lynn moved to Hollywood and in 1992 he directed Eddie Murphy in The Distinguished Gentleman, which looked at the American government and its bureaucracy, in much the same way as Yes Minister looked at the English government.\n\nIn 1997 Antony Jay wrote the book How to Beat Sir Humphrey: Every Citizen’s Guide to Fighting Officialdom and Derek Fowlds returned to his Bernard Woolley persona to narrate the book on BBC Radio 4.\n\nInterestingly, after years of being known as Sir Humphrey Appleby, Nigel Hawthorne became Sir Nigel Hawthorne when he was knighted in the 1999 New Year’s Honours List.\n\n2010 saw the return of Jim Hacker when Antony Jay and Jonathan Lynn wrote a new stage play of Yes, Prime Minister. In the play Hacker finds salvation for the UK’s debt crisis when the oil-rich country of Kumranistan offers a $10 trillion loan to build a pipeline, but the deal depends on the country’s foreign secretary being supplied with an underage girl with whom he can have sex. It premiered at Chichester Festival Theatre on 13 May 2010 and ran to 5 June 2010, transferred to the Gielgud Theatre, London on 17 September 2010 and ran to 15 January 2011. The play began touring in February 2011, and has been produced many times since around the world with different casts. The original run featured David Haig as Jim Hacker and Henry Goodman as Sir Humphrey Appleby, and this cast reunited to film a 6-episode TV adaptation, which screened on Gold in 2013.\n\nAntony Jay passed away in August 2016, and in 2023 Jonathan Lynn wrote Jim Hacker’s last hurrah, a play entitled I’m Sorry, Prime Minister, I Can’t Quite Remember. Starring Christopher Bianchi as Hacker and Clive Francis as Sir Humphrey Appleby, the play centres around Jim Hacker being secretly recorded making “inappropriate” comments at a college dinner, which requires Sir Humphrey’s skills to save him from having his name removed from Hacker College, Oxford. It premiered on 22 September 2023 at the Barn Theatre, Cirencester and ran until 4 November 2023, and was subsequently released as a book.\n\nYES MINISTER\n\nStarring Paul Eddington (Jim Hacker), Nigel Hawthorne (Sir Humphrey Appleby), Derek Fowlds (Bernard Woolley), Diana Hoddinott (Annie Hacker), John Nettleton (Sir Arnold Robinson), Neil Fitzwilliam (Frank Weisel) (series 1), John Savident (Sir Frederick ‘Jumbo’) (series 1)\n\nSeries 1\n\nBBC2 25 February to 7 April 1980 1 Open Government\n\nJim Hacker’s party wins the General Election and he is appointed Minister for Administrative Affairs.
