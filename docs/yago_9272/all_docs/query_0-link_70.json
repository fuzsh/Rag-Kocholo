        "text": "Sherlock Holmes (1951)\n\nstarring John Longden as the immortal detective and Campbell Singer as Dr Watson\n\n(For the 1954 Sherlock Holmes series starring Ronald Howard . . For the 1960s BBC series . . For the 1979 Geoffrey Whitehead series)\n\nThe Case of The Man Who Disappeared\n\nBased on the Conan Doyle story The Man with the Twisted Lip\n\nNeville St Clair (Hector Ross), a patient of Dr Watson, has disappeared. A \"very old friend\" Marie had come to his home one day and insisted he obeys orders, or else.......\n\nKate his wife (Ninka Dolega), seeks SH's help. She doesn't know who the woman was, but she has found out her husband's alleged place of work does not exist.\n\nSH examines the area around this address, and follows a mysterious match seller through a graveyard and on to Redmead Lane near Tower Bridge. Kate is brought there and spots her husband through a window. In rushes SH to find St Clair dead in the room. When the police arrive the corpse has of course disappeared from the match seller's room. But there is some clothing that belongs to St Clair, and his coat is found underneath the window on the bank of the Thames. The house is a shady opium den owned by Luzatto (Walter Gotell).\n\nAgainst all this evidence, Kate still believes her husband is alive. \"I ought to be kicked from here to Baker Street,\" jokes SH as he concurs with her. The key is in the bathroom of the house, he adds cryptically.\n\nKate's intuition seems to be substantiated when she receives an anonymous letter in printed letters cut from a magazine stating Neville is alive. SH of course can deduce much from this missive. It's from a woman.\n\nHe breaks into the property of this lady, Doreen alias Marie, at the opium den belonging to Luzatto, to ask her why she'd sent the note. Answer: \"Neville told me to.\" Luzatto had been blackmailing Neville St Clair because he thought he had killed Doreen's husband. Neville had feigned death when SH had found his corpse earlier- incredible that SH was so taken in! Nevertheless, SH persuades her to set a trap.\n\nThe crooks break into Baker Street and capture SH. At least they think it's SH, though it's actually DrW. He's taken to Luzatto, who realising the error, orders DrW to write a note to SH ordering him to come to the den. But in breaks SH and there's a fight, during which, with typical sneakiness Luzatto creeps away.\n\nWhen the fisticuffs are over, the match seller is shown to be Neville, who'd been a virtual prisoner of the evil Luzatto. He's exonerated of the crime he thought he was guilty of, so they all live happily etc etc\n\nCrime Menu\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\nJonnie and Me\n\nA 1960 pilot made by Revue, filmed in Mexico. and starring\n\nRichard Greene as Jonnie, and Robert Strauss as \"me\" (Hank)\n\nwith, in this story Hazel Court,\n\nalso Fernando Wagner, Jerome Cowan, Elsa Gardenas.\n\nTeleplay: Danny Armold and Roland Kibbee. Directed by Danny Armold. Producer: Richard Irving.\n\nThis pilot was made but no series ever materialised from it. It introduces the main character, Jonnie, a wealthy playboy but secretly working for the US government, and his rival \"me\" aka Hank.They enjoy an uneasy relationship trying to spy out secrets and obtain the best price possible for them. This adventure has the added bonus of an appearance by Hazel Court.\n\nIt starts in Acapulco where Jonnie, relaxing on his luxury yacht with his latest conquest, rescues survivors from a stricken destroyer. The mystery is how it could have been sunk by a torpedo.\n\nJonnie stumbles on a note which shows that a millionaire named Karnak had had his ship fitted up with just such a torpedo. Jonnie invites himself to an exclusive party on this vessel.\n\nA beautiful guest, Victoria, catches him taking photos so he chats her up and dances with her. Then he goes below to try and locate the torpedo and bumps into Hank. Behind a bulkhead he finds what he is looking for. He photographs the torpedo but they are discovered and dragged into the presence of Karnak. \"You may die,\" he tells them. They are chucked overboard, which seems hardly murderous intent as the pair swim ashore.\n\nNow Hank wants to share the vital photos, but Jonnie has to concede he hasn't got them. When he was searched he had handed them to Vicky.\n\nWhen she comes ashore, she coldly informs Jonnie and Hank she has sold them to a higher bidder, ie Karnak. But later, at the airport, she kindly hands them to Jonnie alone, for a kiss or two. Hank however is wise to that and butts in to grab his share.\n\nAll very tongue in cheek, anticipating the mood of the 1960s spy genre, if this had been made a few years later it would surely have caught on. It's a very slight story, but interesting to watch Richard Greene attempting to throw off the shackles of his Robin Hood, alas, that was just impossible with the series ever being repeated\n\nCrime Menu . . . Pilots' Menu\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\nBoyd QC\n\nstarring Michael Denison in the title role, a well-respected, highly professional man-about-the courts. Richard Boyd QC is in demand by all kinds of clients. Some of his cases include murder, fraud, forgery, blackmail and poison pen letters.\n\nOne of A-R's big successes, the series ran from late 1956 until 1964, with time off, of course, for good behaviour. 83 stories were made.\n\nWriter of all the stories was Jack Roffey. Introducing each story, and acting as narrator was Charles Leno as Boyd's clerk. However John Glyn-Jones played Boyd's clerk George in the first series only. Executive Producer series 1: Caryl Doncaster.\n\nThe set was an adaptation of Courts Three and Four at the Old Bailey, though this was never actually referred to, in the stories. Publicity claimed the programme's success was down to 1 authenticity coupled with suspense and excitement, 2 the court theme and 3 its authoritarian approach to the question of right and wrong in law. \"The treatment of all cases is tough and realistic.\"\n\nNote on actors in the series.\n\nIn addition to those listed below, the following have also stated they appeared in this series, though the actual story is not at present known:\n\nDouglas Blackwell (series 1 or 2), Jane Downs (either series 1 or 2 or 3- she played a nurse), Jeremy Geidt, David Blake Kelly, Doreen Keogh (series 1), Paul Massie, Jill Melford, George Mikell, Jean 'Jill' Moore, Peter Stephens, June Thorburn, Susan Travers, Selma vaz Dias, Mavis Villiers, Lockwood West. John Horsley also made at least one appearance in Boyd QC before that listed in #4:1.\n\nSeries 1 ran for 13 weekly stories, commencing Christmas Eve 1956. All except 1:1, 1:2, 1:6 and 1:10 were being advertised for sale to other tv stations in the 1960s, so must have been filmed.\n\n1:1 Her Father's Daughter\n\nDesigned by George Haslam. Directed by Michael Currer-Briggs.\n\nSynopsis: what was the secret of Ruth Martin that turned the case for James Lavers?\n\nThe first ever episode.\n\n1:2 The Greenstreet Girl\n\nDecember 31st 1956.\n\nDesigned by George Haslam. Directed by Cliff Owen.\n\nSynopsis: Judy Greenstreet, a secretary, endeavours to evade the amorous advances of her boss. The situation which ensues involves her in a charge of arson.\n\nCast includes Jane Downs\n\n1:3 The Case of Casanova Jones\n\nMonday 7th January 1957\n\nDirected by Ronald Marriott\n\nCast includes: Junia Crawford... Ruby Wheeler.\n\nTo quote Boyd himself- \"When is a bigamist not a bigamist?\" The results of the marital adventures of a soldier, Pte Jones.\n\n\"There are four complete answers to a bigamy charge... proven absence of the marriage partner for seven years coupled with a genuine belief of death; dissolution of the first marriage and nullity of the first marriage. There is also a fifth which is not laid down by law, but which is equally effective. We meet it when Boyd QC defends a certain Private Jones, Casanova Jones as he became known in this case.\"\n\n1:4 The Ordinary-Looking Man\n\nMonday 14th January 1957\n\nDirected by Michael Currer-Briggs.\n\n\"Richard Boyd is by no means invincible nor is he intended to be a 'clever dick.' There comes a time when his client is not quite so fortunate- when evidence is stacked too strongly against him. As Boyd's clerk, George, points out, 'You can't build bricks with straw.'... In this episode the case against Hatton Garden's diamond merchant Rosenstiel is black indeed, innocent as he would appear to be. This is a story of diamond smuggling that starts when an Irish runner is apprehended at the airport and refuses to divulge the names of his accomplices. Police investigation leads to the diamond merchant who by a circumstantial twist of fate finds himself in the dock.\"\n\n1.5 Final Night Alibi\n\nJanuary 21st 1957, 8pm.\n\nDirector: Cliff Owen.\n\nTV Times synopsis: \"A ring at the door... a night watchman answers it- and the next moment he lies battered and bleeding on the floor. The defence of those accused of the crime was an alibi, but to be effective an alibi must be unshakeable\"\n\nRediffusion synopsis: \"Boyd's clerk George quotes Mr Weller's advice on how to conduct the case of Bardell v Pickwick- 'Stick to the alleybi' says Mr Weller, 'a alleybi's the thing to get him off!' George ends the programme some 27 minutes later, 'An alibi is like a chain. The more links in it the longer it gets... the difficulty lies only in finding its weakest link.' Finding that weak link is Boyd's task. He is confronted with the seemingly cast iron alibi of two crooks plaintively protesting their innocence to a charge of breaking and entering an office and stealing jewellery and silver to the tune of several thousand pounds.\"\n\nCast includes Michael Medwin\n\n1:6 The Light Tackle Job\n\nMonday 28th January 1957\n\nDirected by Ronald Marriott.\n\nA violent criminal on the run can be gentle enough with the woman who loves him, but to the public at large he is a potential killer.\n\n1.7 The £10,000 Wash Out\n\nFebruary 4th 1957\n\nDirector: Michael Currer Briggs.\n\nCast includes:\n\nRaymond Francis... Col Barlow\n\nMargo Johns... Mrs Barlow\n\nNoel Coleman... Mr Eastley, Defending Counsel\n\nJames Raglan... Judge (\"once again\")\n\nOf nearly 4,000 cases of forgery known to British police in a year, two thirds are cheque forgeries and of the few odd ones, one would certainly have been the falsely time-stamped betting letter. Colonel Barlow, assisted by his wife perpetrates a simple but effective method of putting this fraud into operation. A £10 treble win placed on three outsiders would win the Barlows a five figure fortune. All the runners had of course come in first but Barlow's bookmaker smells a rat. So does the Post Office, so do the police; and so the colonel finds himself in the dock. It seems fairly obvious that he has engineered a betting swindle but it is going to be difficult to prove, and Boyd as Prosecuting Counsel begins to feel that the defendant is going to get away with it. But Col Barlow did not keep up to date with his racing and it turned out to be all a matter of time and a horse called Crumpet that unseated him\n\n1:8 The Open and Shut Case\n\nFebruary 11th 1957\n\nDirector: Michael Currer Briggs.\n\nCast includes:\n\nRichard Gatehouse... Blackmailer\n\nGladys Boot... Housekeeper\n\nHonor Blackman\n\nAn American woman in her mid thirties is accused of murdering her aged husband. Blackmail by an old American friend of hers enters the plot... Jealousy by her husband's housekeeper complicates the issue. The accused pleads not guilty.\n\n1:9 Both Sides of the Story\n\nMonday February 18th 1957\n\nDirected by Ronald Marriott.\n\n'The Stage' reported the following were part of this cast:\n\nBetty McDowall... Jill Harris (Defence Counsel)\n\nChristine Pollon... Helen Porter\n\nBoyd's clerk says, \"A mean cowardly sort of crime, and quite rightly the courts come down on it hard. All the same there are always two sides to every story.\" This robbery takes place in a railway carriage and the young man, Peter Hayman, is arrested on the charge in which he is alleged to have been armed with an offensive weapon, a revolver, and robbed Helen Porter of a necklace. The accused pleads not guilty, and Boyd QC is briefed to prosecute.\n\nAdditional details: \"... This time the hitherto invincible paragon of the law courts takes a beating from the defending counsel who has 'the face of an angel and a mind like a needle.'\"\n\n1:10 The Light That Was Dark\n\nFebruary 25th 1957, 8pm\n\nDirected by Michael Currer-Briggs\n\nSynopsis: Hate and blackmail provide important elements in this case, where Richard Boyd defends a fascinating and sophisticated woman who is accused of murder.\n\n1.11 Hit and Run\n\nMarch 4th 1957\n\nDirector: Cliff Owen.\n\nCast includes:\n\nWilliam Franklyn... Jack Main\n\nBarry Keegan... Police Inspector Roberts\n\nFrank Shelley... Mr Donkin, Prosecuting Counsel\n\nThe charges concerns a road accident. The case in question is an up to date one from the point of view that causing death by dangerous driving is a new offence in Great Britain created by the Road Traffic Act of 1956. Replacing the charge of manslaughter which hitherto covered the same cirumstances, death by dangerous driving is no longer a felony punishable by life imprisonment, but a misdemeanour carrying a maximum sentence of five years. However, when a man's car kills a cyclist one night, police find him intoxicated at home. Boyd QC defends. But even he finds this a tough nut to crack.\n\n1.12 The Key of the Door\n\nMarch 11th 1957\n\nDirected by Ronald Marriott\n\nCast includes:\n\nPhilip Dale... Mr Black, Prosecuting Counsel\n\nMeier Tzelniker\n\nJeffrey Segal\n\nDelia Paton\n\nSynopsis: Minks and sables, beautiful furs worth thousands of pounds are stolen on a Sunday afternoon. Only one person could have done it- according to the prosecution.\n\n1.13 The Third Stroke\n\nMarch 18th 1957 (note- this story is definitely still in existence)\n\nCast includes:\n\nVictor Maddern... Lee Blake.\n\nSynopsis: Lee Blake, the safebreaker is standing in the dock. This case, the last in this series, is one of breaking and entering. A safe is blown open so expertly that it points to only one man. Eventually arrested, he stands in the dock, but Boyd finds his alibi as tough to crack as the Bank of England vaults. However, even good witnesses are persuaded that the timings of a defendant's alibi can be wrong, even by ten seconds.\n\nBoyd's clerk ends the series with these words, \"The Guvnor is going to France for a holiday with his eyes looking like roulette wheels.\"\n\nSeries 2 with 12 stories started in April 1958.\n\n2.1 The Up-and-Coming Man\n\nWednesday April 9th 1958, 7.30pm\n\nDirector: Michael Currer-Briggs.\n\nSynopsis: A girl decides to end her relationship with a married man. He takes the decision badly and threatens her life. One night she is razor slashed by an assailant, and she accuses her ex-lover. Nevertheless, arrested and charged, his case seems certain to be dismissed. Boyd, as prosecuting counsel, has to work hard against strong evidence to get a conviction.\n\n2.2 Mustapha- King of Reefers\n\nApril 16th 1958\n\nIn the second edition of Boyd QC, Richard Boyd acts as prosecuting counsel in a case of drug trafficking. An Indian, Mustapha, is caught in possesion of hemp.\n\n2.3 The Shropshire Lass\n\nWednesday 23rd April 1958 7.30pm\n\nDirected by Michael Currer-Briggs.\n\nSynopsis: Ken Morris pleads guilty to a charge of receiving stolen goods. Did his beautiful girl friend who is charged with him know the truth?\n\nCast:\n\nJune Laverick... Elizabeth Oliver\n\nBarrie Cookson... Kenneth Morris\n\nRussell Waters... Albert\n\nCyril Renison... Mr Bodkin\n\nDavid Garth... Mr Moss\n\nFred Johnson... Judge\n\nWeyman McKay... Clerk of court\n\nOwen Berry... Usher\n\nIan Ainsley... Inspector Briggs\n\nJill Melford... Kay Steers\n\nLaurie Main... Sonder Struniewski\n\nRobin Lloyd... Walter\n\nHilary Crane... Rita\n\n2.4 The Balance of her Mind\n\nApril 30th 1958\n\nSays Boyd's clerk Albert, 'By the MacNaughton rules of 1843, no person can be convicted of any crime if it can be shown that at the time he committed it the balance of the mind was so disturbed that he didn't know what he was doing was wrong. And it is up to the defence to prove this...' The story opens with the murder of a middle aged lady by her twin sister, an epileptic. A next door neighbour hears the sounds of the killing and calls the police.\n\n2.5 The Not-So-Civil-Servant\n\nMay 7th 1958\n\nDirector: Michael Currer-Briggs\n\nBoyd QC finds himself defending an unpleasant character charged under the Prevention of Corruptiion Act. Richard Coote, a Licence Enforcement Officer, threatens a small Soho cafe proprietor with a traffic offence and suggests the matter could be glossed over for a small consideration. The cafe owner reports the matter to the police and Coote is arrested.\n\n2.6 Two Wrongs\n\nMay 14th 1958\n\nDirected by Jonathan Alwyn.\n\nSynopsis: Armed robbery is a serious offence in the eyes of the law. In this episode, the Court's work is made difficult through a case of mistaken identity.\n\nStoryline: Charles Woodman, a young tough is in the dock charged with robbing a jeweller at pistol point. Woodman pleads Not Guilty and Boyd takes on his defence though the evidence is strongly stacked against the accused.\n\n2.7 The Other Half\n\nMay 21st 1958\n\nDirected by Michael Currer-Briggs.\n\n\"A young mother, Mrs Pearson, is in the dock after attempted suicide by gas poisoning. She is charged on an indictment containing two counts- attempting to murder her baby and attempting to commit suicide. Boyd defends.\"\n\nCast included Carmel McSharry as Mrs Pearson.\n\n2.8 Subaltern Red\n\nMay 28th 1958\n\nDirected by Jonathan Alwyn.\n\nAlthough every possible detail is carefully checked by police, it does sometimes happen that the vital clue remains stubbornly elusive. In such a case the work of counsel is rendered doubly hard.\n\n\"Synopsis: A young woman is found strangled in an East End coalyard and her husband Edward Dixon is charged with her murder. Prosecuting counsel produces damning evidence of Dixon's guilt and Boyd has to use all his powers of defence.\" (Sounds like Perry Mason all over again!)\n\n2.9 A Question of Type\n\nJune 4th 1958\n\n\"Did old Mr Maitland write the libellous letters to discredit his son or was Dr Tom Maitland's cunning responsible for his father's appearance in court? That is the question posed in this edition of Boyd QC. Boyd is briefed to prosecute Mr Maitland on a charge of publishing a defamatory libel. Opposing him across the court is defence counsel Emrys Williams. The libel takes the form of anonymous letters which allege that popular Dr Tom committed an illegal operation on a young girl. This the doctor heatedly denies. By some careful police work and a little bit of luck the machine on which the letters were typed is traced to Maitland's own house- to his father's room. But in court Counsel Williams insists it was planted there by the doctor, eager to gain long-awaited revenge on his father for something which happened in the past\n\n2.10 Last Train Home\n\nJune 12th 1958\n\nDirected by Jonathan Alwyn.\n\n\"Marjorie Nelson is a wilful spoiled girl, accustomed to getting her own way, and living in an atmosphere of Only The Best Will Do.\n\nHer association with young Frank Atkins, eager to please her every whim but financially prevented from doing so, seems headed for unhappiness.\n\nIn this tenth story of series two the story has gone a step further, from unhappiness to tragedy. Frank is in the dock accused of Marjorie's murder. Returning home on the last train after an expensive night out, the problem of money again causes an argument. Marjorie becomes hysterical, threatens to kill herself and opens the door of the carriage. Frank attempts to save her but the girl slips and falls from the moving train. An obvious accident, but in a dying declaration, Marjorie accuses Frank of pushing her. At the trial Boyd defends Atkins.\"\n\nTV Times add the explanation that the evidence of a deceased person can only be admitted if the judge is satisfied the deceased was aware of their impending death.\n\n2.11 The £12,000 Fiddle\n\nJune 18th 1958\n\n\"Three men, Quentin, Martin and Milne, are charged with conspiring together to obtain £12,000 from an insurance company by false pretences. The first two plead Not Guilty, but Milne anxious to return to the path of honesty he has followed for nine years admits the crime and offers evidence to the Crown against his former accomplices. Upon Boyd falls the responsibility of proving that Quentin and Martin are indeed guilty of fraud. All he has is Milne's uncorroborated statement, nothing at all in writing to connect two seemingly innocent men with the crime. And Milne is a former criminal whose last conviction was for a similar offence to the one with which he has now pleaded guilty.\"\n\n2.12 The Family Affair\n\nJune 25th 1958, 7.30pm\n\nDirected by Jonathan Alwyn.\n\nTV Times synopsis: \"Richard Boyd plans to spend a weekend in Kent with his family, but soon finds that it is not as quiet as he had imagined.\"\n\nA-R synopsis: \"Richard Boyd finds himself in court defending a member of his household, German maid Putzi Weigel. Putzi faces a charge of child stealing and another of causing the baby grievous bodily harm. When the baby, bruised and beaten, is found in the wardrobe of her bedroom, Putzi at first denies hysterically all knowledge of it. Later she admits taking the child from its pram but vehemently denies cruelty, alleging that the baby's mother is to blame. She is brought to court where Boyd finds himself in the strange position of cross-examining not only Putzi, but his own father and sister, Joanna.\n\nThis is the first time Boyd's family have appeared in the series.\"\n\nSeries 3 ran for 16 weekly episodes from 30 December 1958.\n\n3.1 A Couple of Macs\n\nDecember 30th 1958, 10.15pm\n\nDirected by Michael Currer-Briggs.\n\n\"Two Scots go out on a pub crawl on New Year's Eve and become involved in a fight. They are charged with assault and causing an affray. Boyd is asked by an old friend to represent them under the Poor Prisoners Defence Act, does so, securing their release under two points of law. The results are highly amusing although based on actual law and authentic legal procedure.\"\n\n3.2 Nylon Spells Murder\n\nTuesday January 6th 1959, 10.15pm\n\nDirected by Jonathan Alwyn.\n\nSynopsis: When a man has been killed and the case is being considered, a most important factor is time- that is, the time in which the intention to kill was formed. Without that intention, a killing is not murder; it may not even be manslaughter.\n\n3.3 Old Tom\n\nJanuary 13th 1959\n\n\"Old Tom Brown, on the brink of receiving a life pension and £1,000 gratuity after 40 years with the post office, is charged with stealing three postal orders from a letter.\"\n\n3.4 A Question of Talking Turkey\n\nTuesday January 20th 1959\n\nDirected by Michael Currer-Briggs\n\nSynopsis: Three weeks after Christmas is the harvest time for a bumper crop of Christmas crimes. Why did Boyd take this case? Was John Wainwright really involved in the turkey racket?\n\n3.5 Cheap Ticket\n\nJanuary 27th 1959\n\nDirected by Tania Lieven\n\n\"A good alibi is a cheap ticket to an acquittal any day of the week- and the alibi Bill Minto cooked up was the cleverest in many a long day.\"\n\n3.6 Confession of Murder\n\nFebruary 3rd 1959\n\nDirected by Michael Currer-Briggs.\n\n\"Was Pollard's confession voluntary, or made under pressure? How does a barrister reconcile his conscience to defending a man he believes to be guilty?\"\n\n3.7 An Inside Job\n\nFebruary 10th 1959\n\n\"Like many burglars, Harry believed in working with inside help, and, like many burglars, he was caught.

The High Court Judge believes Odapi and orders the jury to acquit him.\"\n\nCast:\n\nDan Jackson... George Albert Memorial Odapi\n\nBarbara Assoon... Martha Shimboko\n\nMillard Williams...

Green is charged with stealing the money and Baird, another employee of Chetty and Winthrop, is accused of receiving stolen goods. Boyd's prosecution reveals that Baird had disguised himself as Green, had visited De Viani in jail and had subsequently stolen Case and money.

He testifies that Dalton was extremely drunk and that his driving was dangerous on the journey home. In Dalton's defence, Boyd cross-examines Gorman and casts doubt on his version of the story. Further questioning proves Gorman to have been the culprit and shows that he deliberately framed Dalton so as to avoid a prison sentence.\n\nCast:\n\nBill Kerr... Lewis Gorman\n\nLeonard Sachs...

Willie provided 'cheap' meat for Rosie, who then made meat pies which she sold on her stall. The meat used had been stolen from local farms by Willie. Eventually they were caught, but, however, this possibility had been foreseen and they had provided themselves with an alibi. Lottie Machin, who was known to be scrupulously honest, staunchily upheld their alibi. She said that they could not be responsible for the paricular theft in question because she was with them at the time having her picture taken; in the background of the photo was a clock showing the time and date which apparently 'verified' what they said. At the last minute, Boyd for the prosecution, finds a flaw in the alibi and the case is proven against Rosie and Willie.\"\n\nCast-\n\nMegan Latimer... Rosie Gould\n\nGeorge Tovey...

Jim Lyons is a case in point.\n\nA-R Synopsis: \"Helen Mackenzie is murdered. Her fiance James Lyons discovers that Helen had somehow been mixed up with a gang of criminals; she had wanted to leave the gang but the boss, Benjamin Turley, threatened to kill her if she did. Helen left them and Turley shot her. In a blind rage, Lyons goes to Turley's flat, shoots him once, and stabs him twice, then gives himself up to the police. In defending him, Boyd points out to the court that it is not known whether Turley died from the bullet wound or the stab wounds, and on this fact would depend whether Lyons was to be sentenced to death or life imprisonment. Dr Lifford, who examined the body, could not say from which wound Turley had died. This doubt over a technical point, caused the judge to sentence Lyons to life imprisonment.\"\n\nCast:\n\nBryan Coleman... Prosecuting counsel\n\nBarry Warren... James Lyons\n\nJohn Barrie...

A fight develops and Caroline is accidentally killed. In desperation, Joanna turns to her uncle, George Pack, who agrees to help. Pack decides that in return for a sum of money, he will accept responsibility for the accident. At the Assizes, Pack is charged with manslaughter. Boyd, who is sitting as Special Commissioner and Judge, decides that Pack's story is inconsistent and suggests to the police a further search for another witness. This is successful and important evidence comes to light which causes Pack to confess to the court the full story. The Case is dismissed and Pack, Joanne and Jonathan are imprisoned for perjury.\"\n\nWilliam Squire... Mr Corby\n\nRedmond Phillips... George Pack\n\nLeslie Weston... Mr Martin\n\nMary Watson...

He had intended to ask her for a divorce so that he could marry Florence Twiss, the woman he really loved. He and his wife had quarrelled, and in a scuffle Connie is killed. When he hears that the police are looking for him, Parsons gives himself up and admits to the killing. Boyd defends Parsons, and his thorough investigations reveal the true facts of the case. Boyd shows the court that Dr Attard, who conducted the postmortem, was inexperienced with death by strangulation and had inadvertently but wrongly diagnosed the cause of death.

In defending Loukis, Boyd explains that the antique silver had been left in the shop safe since before the war. He also explains how a set of modern hallmark punches came to be left in the safe. Boyd's defence appears strong, and it seems the case will be quickly wound up. However Mr Burton, the prosecuting counsel, produces further evidence which convinces the judge and jury that Loukis is guilty.\"\n\n4.11 The Time of Day\n\nDirector: Pat Baker\n\nSeptember 7th 1960\n\nSynopsis: Family loyalty and the love of a father for his son have been two essential elements of social behaviour. Unfortunately these very same qualities sometimes become warped, and that means trouble for everyone, especially the police.\n\nA-R Synopsis: \"James Sprott is accused of murdering his ex-girl friend. Boyd, the prosecuting counsel, establishes the approximate time of the murder at around 3pm to 4pm. Casement for the Defence calls as a witness a Mr Lewis who swears that the girl was alive between 3.30 and 4pm on the day of the murder. Casement also proves that Sprott was at the local hospital from 3.15 until 7.45pm. Boyd is convinced Sprott is guilty. Investigation proves that Lewis had perjured himself in order to repay Sprott's father for saving his (Lewis') son's life a year before. Boyd presents this new evidence to the court. Lewis confesses that he had not seen the murdered girl on that day. This fact along with the police evidence of fingerprints and bloodstains convinces the judge and jury of Sprott's guilt.

He pleads not guilty, and is defended by Boyd. His defence is that his car broke down and that, as he was close to a friend's garage, he thought he would borrow the necessary tools. However he did not know that the garage had changed hands and he swears that he got in through an open window. The garage owner, Arthur Todd, insists that all the windows and doors were locked. Evidence substantiating Burris' story is revealed when Todd's daughter is found to have been secretly courting and had used the open window in question as an exit. The window had stuck and she left it open all night. His case is proved not guilty, and Burriss is discharged.\"\n\nWeyman Mackay... Clerk of Court\n\nLeslie Dwyer...

Police notice his arrival, and he is kept under observation. After arranging an alibi, Jordan with the aid of associate Archie Martin, eludes police by slipping out of a taxi. During the robbery, Martin, who is looking after the getaway driver, decamps.The robbery is unsuccessful, and Jordan and George Kean hurry after Martin.\n\nIt is discovered that a woman named Patricia Dunn had gone away with Martin. Because nitroglycerine in a certain form had been used, the trademark of Ben Jordan is recognised, and Baxter is sent after him. In Patricia's flat, Jordan is found, but he has an alibi.\n\nMartin is murdered, and police connect him with the robbery. Lockhart learns that a light coloured shooting brake was seen near where the body was found. He has a tyre imprint photographed.\n\nGeorge Kean, armed with a false passport, joins his wife. Both are taken to the Yard, where they learn that the passport had been supplied by Robinson. This crook however denies knowing Kean or Martin. But Baxter finds a blood stained towel, Kean claims he had cut himself shaving off his moustache. Lockhart taxes Robinson with the towel and the tyre imprint. Robinson tries to tell the truth, thus breaking Jordan's alibi by saying that Pat Dunn was with him\n\n5.6 Alexander's Ragtime Girl\n\nAlexander Alexander, a shy young graduate training to be a barrister, takes Jennifer Buckley, the girl he wants to marry, home to meet his mother. Mrs Alexander (Pauline Letts) is shocked and tries to dissuade them. At a party Jennifer gets into an argument with Gary Benson, Pete Gonzales (Gerald Harper) and Ricky about her forthcoming marriage. There is a scene when Mrs Alexander breaks in, she leaves, then Alexander with jennifer. Next morning Jennifer is found murdered.\n\nTime of death is established at 2.30am, and it is also found that she was two months pregnant. Lockhart and Baxter break the news to Jennifer's father Dr Buckley, who is shocked. Mrs Alexander is upbraiding her son as Lockhart and Baxter turn up to inform them of Jennifer's death. Alex says they left each other at midnight, but cannot account for his movements afterwards. Baxter interviews those at the party, and learns that Pete left soon after Alex and Jennifer.\n\nA wooden chair leg, the murder weapon, is found. Lockhart and Baxter discard the idea of the murderer being one of the party guests, since they all seem to have alibis. Therefore they return to the Alexander house. Alex admits that Jennifer did go out with other men, but he doesn't know about that particular night. As he is obviously under suspicion, his mother comes forward to admit killing Jennifer\n\n5.7 Pay as You Earn\n\n\"Tregunter, Clarke and Palmer plan to steal a safe from the office of a building firm. They spray a yellow van with grey paint, cover the number plate with mud, cut the lock at the rear of the premises and substitute a new padlock. While Tregunter keeps watch outside the office, the others, using a battery operated fork lift truck, steal the safe. The only clues are the marks of the truck and the substituted padlock. The grey van is seen leaving the scene of the crime and a general call is put out, but by this time the thieves have reached Palmer's garage, washed off the grey paint, and managed to get away through the road blocks. Lockhart returns to his office with the padlock which was issued by a government department, but which department? Had he seen Clarke and Tregunter at that moment, he would have known the answer, as they were returning to prison, being parolees on a rehabilitation course.\n\nBaxter and Lockhart get a lead on Tregunter and depart for the prison, but by the time they arrive, Tregunter and Clarke have been released. However a prisoner tells the governor that he heard Joe Dean, Palmer and Clarke discussing a burglary using a fork lift truck. The police go to Palmer's garage, but when they arrive they find the body of Palmer beside the empty safe.\n\nClarke is found, and detained on a charge of stealing the money, which he admits. Tregunter is found at the house of a girl called Frances, a secretary at the building company. The police find the proceeds of the robbery there, so Tregunter is taxed with the murder of Palmer, but he proves that he was not there at the time of the killing. Attention is then focussed on the girl, who admits that she killed Palmer to prevent him getting away with all the money\"\n\n5.9 Peggy\n\n\"Anne Cassett is assaulted by John Clint. He is charged, found guilty and sent to Northmoor Mental Hospital, but escapes one year later. Baxter visits the hospital and finds the walls of Clint's cell covered with drawings of cats, panthers and lions, and is given samples of poems written by Clint to someone named Peggy.\n\nClint gets to London and telephones an attractive model Joanna Simpson (Catherine Woodville). She anwers the phone, but he does not speak. The same night, Clint attacks a motorist near Joanna's address in Chelsea. Lockhart sees the injured man in hospital, who identifies Clint.\n\nBaxter visits Clint's mother, but the only information he gets from her is that Clint had been employed in a gown shop, and that he had loaned an amount of money he had won on the pools to one of the girls. That night Joanna returns home with her fiancee, and after he leaves she goes into the kitchen to call her cat. Clint is there.\n\nFollowing the information that Clint had worked in a gown shop where models were employed, special attention is given to models called Peggy. Eventually a girl named Peggy Dawson is found, but although she knew John Clint, she denies receiving money from him, and names Joanna as the person who did. It is then discovered that Joanna had previously occupied the same address as Anne Cassett.\n\nJoanna, alone in her flat with Clint, has succeeded in convincing him that she had intended to marry him and had kept his money for this purpose, but a telephone call from her fiancee changes the situation and Clint rounds on her. The police arrive and Clint, in attempting to run away down the fire escape, falls to his death.\n\nBaxter picks up Joanna's cat, on the collar is the name Peggy. John Clint, in his mental illness, had thought that the cat had come between him and Joanna\"\n\n5.10 Statement to the Press\n\nWhen Baxter is told by an informer that Alan Klein, a wireless engineer, is going to be 'sprung' from Dartmoor, Lockhart plants Benson, of the Special Branch, in the cell with Klein. Benson talks Klein into taking him with him on the breakout. They escape safely and drive to a derelict flour mill owned by John Pentelow. Here they are met by Lee Gilbert and Lofty Rogers (Jack Watson), who need Klein for a crime their boss has planned. Benson receives a cool reception, it is made plain that he is not to be trusted. Lee Gilbert goes to see Mr Big, Bryan Fellows (Hugh Manning) in his office, to complain about Benson's introduction. Gilbert returns to the mill and after being bested in a row with Benson, says that Klein will be responsible if Benson comes with them on the job.\n\nBenson works on Klein, who finally tries to phone his wife because he is worried about her, but he is stopped by Rogers. Baxter tries to trace the call, but is unsuccessful. Meanwhile Rogers is given the briefing for the job, a raid on a security van. Fellows takes a plane to Paris with his secretary Wendy. The raid now takes place, and is successful.\n\nThe van used by the raiders is found, and inside is a piece of plaster with a phone number, left by Benson. The number is that of Lee's girlfriend. Baxter sees her and by playing on her greed for money by mentioning the large reward, is given Fellows' phone number. Lockhart connects flour found on Gilbert's trousers with the miller's van which had gone through a road block earlier. The van is traced to John Pentelow and searched.\n\nBenson contacts police, but in so doing, is found out. The gang are about to deal with him, when Lockhart and the police burst in to arrest them\n\n5.11 Scaremonger (Sept 10th 1963)\n\nBen Morland (Barry Keegan), just released from prison, has a message for his cell mate's widow, Jane Hobbs. But when he visits her, she won't listen to him.\n\nLockhart receives a call to tell him that there is a bomb at Paddington Station, and another in a pillar box in Pimlico. Both bombs are found, but neither has a fuse, and Lockhart suspects that it is the work of a hoaxer, and forbids any publicity.\n\nNext morning, the lab reports on the newspaper wrapping around the bombs. Cut into the second page of one, there is the number 21, followed by the letters C and L. An article appears in the Evening Citizen, which denigrates police, and Lockhart in particular.\n\nAfter inquiries, Lockhart interviews Harvey, Wand and Morland. Another bomb is found in a library, and Lockhart finds another, this one with a fuse, on the back seat of his car.\n\nPolice keep watch on Morland, and he is followed to Jane's house. Baxter enters, finding Morland unconscious.\n\nLockhart keeps a rendezvous with the Bomb Man in a mews garage, arriving early to find Jane Hobbs with her brother in law and a dummy wearing an old raincoat. The message Morland was to have given Jane was to tell her to disperse a load of gelignite. She has found this and tries to kill Lockhart, whom she blames for her husband's death\n\n5.16 Two Dreams in a Fire\n\nPearce uses an ingenious method of fraud, and has had success with it for some time, but police are almost on to him. He decides to run away with the week's takings, approximately £700, planning to go abroad, abandoning his girl friend Nell Burroughs. Five miles from Dover, he passes a garage run by Sean McMurdoch (Eddie Byrne), but then gets a puncture.\n\nSean is called out to repair it. He drives there in his little van, and notices a bag with the stolen money. He strikes Pearce on the head, puts him in the van, drives it down a steep slope and sets fire to it.\n\nBowman and Baxter, who are on to Pearce's crimes, have obtained information about his car and the amount of money stolen. Next morning Lockhart is told about the body in the burnt out van, and travels to Dover. He quickly establishes that the body is not that of Sean, and it is identified as that of Pearce. On the car radio, while he is near Liverpool, McMurdoch hears a broadcast calling attention to the car he is driving. He abandons it, and sets off for the docks, carrying the stolen bag of money.\n\nA letter found in McMurdoch's house intimates that he might go to a pub in Belfast, so the quest moves to Northern Ireland. The publican, apprehensive of his position because it is murder, reveals that McMurdoch has left for the border. Just short of here, McMurdoch's car breaks down. he spots the police car in the distance, and attempts to rush across the border, but is felled by Baxter, and arrested for murder\n\n5.17 An Eye on the Kings\n\nBerry who is planning a jewel robbery, employs 'Petty' Smith to recruit assistants. With Harry Matters (John Junkin), Petty engages two men, Wills and Petrie, and together with ex GPO man Swallow, they plan the job. Lockhart is informed of the plan, so a watch is kept on Berry. The raid is carried out, and a broken window sets off an alarm in the security office. It is arranged that security men meet up with police at the jeweller's, these men are Petrie and Wills.\n\nThe plan works- the security van arrives and the guards are deceived. Matters, also in uniform, sits out of sight, monitoring police radio calls. When the guards open the vault, they are attacked and their keys stolen. A quarter of a million pounds worth of jewellery is stolen.\n\nSeen by Baxter in his home, Berry explains where he has been, and blames Godfrey for the job. Continuing his pressure, Lockhart instals Det Sgt Bowman outside the door of Berry's house, and has Berry's phone tapped. The stolen jewels are hidden in Wills' room. But Berry is unable to move the stolen property. He is nervous, and gets angry when Petty Smith calls at his home. There is a row and Baxter is waiting with a car when Berry emerges from the house.\n\nLockhart interviews Godfrey, and is given an account of his movements, then purposely lets Godfrey know what Berry has alleged about him. He pinpoints in this allegation that the information could have started at a billiards hall owned by Berry, and frequented by Petty Smith. Godfrey swallows the bait, and sends his right hand man Wally to see Petty. After some intimidation, Petty talks. Wills becomes nervous, and after talking with Petrie, phones Berry. This call is traced so Lockhart obtains the address of the hideout. Wally and a strong arm man get there first. Wills is beaten up, the jewels taken. But police arrive and they are all arrested. Berry is picked up later\n\n5.18 Requiem on a Typewriter\n\nArchie MacLaren, an ex police officer turned private investigator, is shot dead in his office. Lockhart, an old colleague of Maclaren, is called in. With Baxter, he investigates the scene of the crime, and finds a piece of torn off paper stuck on the typewriter, indicating that something had been typed has been pulled from the machine. The only thing the police have to work on are MacLaren's address book, and his bank statement, and they find his three most recent clients were a Mr Littleton, Westbrook and Sons, and a Mrs Anstruther.\n\nBaxter sees Mrs Anstruther (Dandy Nichols), who employed Maclaren to get divorce evidence against her husband, a womaniser and a violent man. Baxter obtains a photograph of Anstruther from a newspaper, which is circulated to the police and the press. Det Sgt Tandy investigates Littleton, and establishes that he could not possibly have been to MacLaren's office.\n\nLockhart starts on the third client, Westbrook and Sons, and finds this company had not used MacLaren for over two years. It is decided to see the person who drew MacLaren's cheque, a Mr Oliver Westbrook, at his private address in Sussex.\n\nAnstruther, located at a hotel with a woman known as Mrs Anstruther, is taken to Scotland Yard, coincidental with the arrival of his real wife, who produces a letter from MacLaren returning her documents, thereby clearing her husband of all suspicion. However as a result of Lockhart's investigations, Anstruther is arrested for bigamy and fraud.\n\nThis leaves one remaining suspect- Oliver Westbrook, but when Baxter arrives at his Sussex home, he is informed that Westbrook has died during the night. Baxter goes back to Lockhart with the news, and he applies to the Home office for a post mortem.\n\nLockhart examines the clues on the typewriter revealed by Forensics, as a result of which Westbrook's nephew Julian is accused of murder\n\n5.19 A Hole in the Head\n\nJoey Beeble (Aubrey Morris), a tramp, finds a human skeleton in the Epping Forest. The man had been shot. Dr Penton finds some granite dust and gunpowder on the clothes and in the hair of the skeleton. Graham Crowley (Andrew Faulds), a sculptor, is called in to reconstruct the man's features, and a photograph is taken and circulated. Through this the police are led to a stonemason's yard, where a man named Begg works. His wife screams when she sees the photo- she knows the dead man.\n\nLockhart and Baxter visit Mrs Grace Begg at her home. She tells them that the dead man's name is Rinaldo Sarto. He was an Italian and used to work at the yard. She had become friendly with him, but her husband disapproved. A report on the gunpowder is received: it is known as black powder. Lockhart thinks Rinaldo might have blown a safe just before he was murdered, and checks on recent safe blowings using this method. A result soon comes, and Sgt Plimmer of the Essex police, provides the information. A man named Redding, with an address in King's Cross, has been arrested in a stolen car containing some of the proceeds from the safe blowing. Also found in the car: a cartridge case, and some blood stains. Baxter returns to the office- he had been to an address in King's Cross where Sarto lived, along with another man who answers to the description of Redding.\n\nRedding is sent to prison for five years. When he is faced with a possible charge of murder, he blames Joe Rezkowski. Joe's premises are searched, and police find odds and ends of jewellery settings, and an automatic pistol. The settings are identical with some stolen in the safe blowing, though the gems have been removed. Ballistic tests show that the rifling on the bullet was different to that on this gun barrel, but a further test shows that the impression on the discharged shell case was the same. Rezkowski is arrested for murder\n\n5.20 The Gamblers\n\nThe story opens in the Crucible Club, where a chemin-de-fer game is in progress. There are seven players, fashion model Raine Smith (Gabriella Licudi), Harvey Hale (Gerald Campion), Nigel Carpenter (Terence Longdon), Arnold Hurst, Johnnie Lightman, Frank Drover, and the owner of the club Suzie Dart (Petra Davies).

At Carpenter's flat, Lockhart and Baxter find that a sum of money has been stolen, and they also find a £5 gambling chip with the name Crucible on it.\n\nLightman's girl friend Claire, reads the report of the murder and rings Lockhart's office. She also speaks to Frank Drover who works with him. When Lightman comes into the office, he is told about the phone call. He denies that he killed Carpenter, though Frank says, 'what exactly do you want Arnold and me to say?'\n\nLockhart and Baxter meet Suzie Dart at the Crucible, where they learn about the game and all those who played it. They all seem to have some sort of alibi, icluding the croupier, who implies that he had been with Suzie. That night, Drover walks into the flat of Raine, and asks for a false alibi. He is refused. Arnold Hurst tries a similar thing with the croupier, and he also is refused.\n\nA reconstruction of the previous night's game, with everyone except Carpenter present, takes place. Following this, all the people except Drover, Lightman and Hurst, establish concrete alibis, but the latter three alibi each other. Drover and Lightman's stories do not tally, and Lockhart decides to see Hurst, the third man in the alibi. They find him at The Crucible, and after Lockhart has asked several questions, a flaw is found in his story. Hurst admits murder\n\n5.21 No Previous Convictions\n\nFrank Evans, Harold Slessor and Stanley Bridges, all men with clean records, are enlisted by Bill Warren to rob a wages car.

His photo is circulated to golf courses, and three days later Bridges is identified by a professional in Gloucester. Lockhart and Baxter see him, and he names two associates in golf, Evans and Slessor. The following Saturday, the pair visit the course, and are followed by Baxter and Hodgkins. Later two cases of money are discovered in a railway station. Observation is kept here.\n\nBarbara Green, Bill Warren's mistress, has a boyfriend, an ex-con named Alfred Jackson. After the raid, she tells him what has happened, and that Bill plans to cross the Channel to France in a cabin cruiser.

A policeman stops Warren, accompanied by Barbara, and he produces a false driving licence.\n\nA box of tablets marked Bethnal Green has been issued to her, and she pretends she has lost them to delay Bill's departure. He finds these tablets she has hidden, and realises that she has deceived him. He takes his money and leaves. Barbara, unable to get any of her tablets, collapses.
