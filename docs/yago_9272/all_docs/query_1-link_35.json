        "text": "His TV shows read like a potted history of British television itself, and include such classics as The Saint (1962, 1964), Dixon of Dock Green (1964-74), Dr Finlay's Casebook (1964, 1969), The Avengers (1968), The Professionals (1980), Minder (1980), Casualty (1992, 2006), The Bill (2001-2007) and My Dad's the Prime Minister (2004).\n\nBetween 1962 and 1972 he played at least seven different characters on the seminal police show Z Cars and he appeared opposite two incarnations of Doctor Who, with Patrick Troughton in The Seeds of Death (1969) and Jon Pertwee in Terror of the Autons (1971).\n\nBorn in Larne, Towb grew up in Belfast and began acting in theatre in Ireland before moving to England in the early 1950s. He landed a series of supporting roles in films, playing a crook in Joseph Losey's The Sleeping Tiger (1954), alongside Dirk Bogarde, and serving in the naval ensemble that included Commander John Mills and Admiral James Robertson Justice in Above Us the Waves (1955).\n\nHe went on to appear in The Blue Max (1966), Carry on at Your Convenience (1971) and Digby, the Biggest Dog in the World (1973). Extensive theatre credits include the National Theatre in London, the Abbey Theatre in Dublin and the Royal Shakespeare Company, and he was Lenin in the original 1975 Broadway production of Tom Stoppard's Travesties. He is pictured above, second from left, in a production of Over The Bridge at Glasgow's King's Theatre in 1960.\n\nBut he was probably best known for his television work. He got into TV just as the medium was taking off in the 1950s and appeared in dozens of shows, generally in supporting one-off parts.\n\nHowever he had a recurring role as a Fleet Street reporter in Front Page Story (1965), with Roddy McMillan and Patrick Mower, he was a regular in the children's comedy series Tottering Towers (1971-72) and he co-starred with Warren Mitchell in So You Think You've Got Troubles (1991), a short-lived sitcom set against the backdrop of Irish religious divisions, with Mitchell as an atheist and Towb a Jew.\n\nHe is survived by his wife, the actress Diana Hoddinott, three children and three grandchildren."
