I have completed a Bachelor of Science in Physical Education at Federal University of Juiz de Fora (UFJF) and a Bachelor of Education in Phisical Education at the Federal University of Paraná (UFPR) in Brazil. At the UFPR, in 2022, I worked on a project called EnvelheSendo where it was developed physical activities to improve the health of the elderly population. Currently as a professor of Physical Education and as a music student, the combining music with physical exercise calls my attention. Outside of the school, I sing, I act, I do voice overs and go for runs. I’m very grateful for the opportunity to work in the Grahn Lab! ​\n\nAlexandra Elmslie\n\nHello! My name is Alexandra, and I am a 2nd year undergraduate student pursuing an Honours Specialization BSc Developmental Cognitive Neuroscience degree, in addition to the Scholar’s Electives program. As both an accomplished pianist and neuroscience student, I am fascinated by the significant neurological influence music possesses, and I am passionate about furthering researching regarding how music can help treat neurological and psychiatric disorders. Within the Grahn lab, I am currently investigating music-based rhythmic auditory stimulation and how this can assist the rehabilitation of Parkinson’s disease patients with neural mechanisms of disordered gait. Outside of the lab, I enjoy hiking, reading Jane Austen, and playing various instruments.\n\nIsha Agarwal\n\nHi, I’m Isha. I am currently in my fourth year of studies pursuing an Honours Specialization in Psychology at Western University. Although I cannot play an instrument to save my life, listening to music and attending concerts makes my life complete. Outside of music I enjoy reading, travelling, painting and playing tennis. I am excited for the opportunity to conduct my honours thesis at the Music and Neuroscience lab with Dr. Jessica Grahn and learn from other lab members throughout the process.​\n\nJoshua Williams\n\nHi everyone! I am a 4th-year undergraduate student pursuing an Honours Specialization in Neuroscience. As a multi-instrumentalist and jazz musician, the Music and Neuroscience Lab appealed to me through its connection between music and neuroscience. I’ll be helping out with a study researching the ecological validity of virtual reality as a tool for analysing the synchronisation of gait patterns. Outside of the lab and school, I play in the jazz ensemble and go for runs. I’m grateful for the opportunity to work in the Grahn Lab, and am excited for this year!\n\nKyle Ing\n\nI am a 4th year undergraduate student working towards graduating with an Honors Specialization in Neuroscience here at Western. Outside of academics, I'm an aspiring independent artist and spend most of my free time writing and producing music. The Grahn lab has given me the opportunity to help with a study exploring social bonding, rhythm, and musical reward, and I'm grateful to be able to take part in research that overlaps with much of my interest.\n\nKatsiaryna Buchko\n\nHi everyone! I am entering my fourth year in the Honours Developmental Cognitive Neuroscience program at Western. Although I have little experience practising music, I am a trained dancer with an appreciation for music and the way that it impacts our movement and cognition. This appreciation, combined with my academic interest in neuroscience, motivated me to join Dr. Grahn’s lab this summer as part of the Undergraduate Student Research Internship program. I am interested in the use of musical interventions for neurological disorders and would hope to do research of my own in the future. I am so grateful for this opportunity and look forward to gaining valuable research experience in the lab this summer!\n\nIvan Quan\n\nHello all! I’m Ivan Quan, a fourth-year undergraduate student pursuing an Honours Specialization in Physiology alongside a double major in Computer Science. Under the supervision of Dr. Grahn and Rebekka Lagacé-Cusiac, I am working at the Grahn Lab on my honours thesis project to study the human ability to quantify intermediate durations in a bisection task. While the classic bisection task implores participants to classify an interval duration on a binary short or long scale, this study aims to discern if we can mentally represent intermediate durations that might not be classified as short or long. I was drawn to working at the Grahn lab as a passionate listener of music, being interested in how we mentally represent and process music and how this could affect our behavior. I am grateful for the opportunity to work at the Grahn lab, and I much look forward to combining my passions in music and physiology into a meaningful contribution to the lab’s research!\n\nAlistair Cranmer\n\nHello, I am a 5th-year undergraduate student pursuing an Honours Specialization in Psychology intending to apply to a master's in Social Work. I'm excited to have been accepted at Grahn Lab to do my Honours Thesis project. I intend to study the effects of different types of stimulation of the Supplementary Motor Area (SMA) using Transcranial Direct Current Stimulation (tDCS) on ratings of pleasure felt by the participant after listening to their favourite song. I will be conducting my study under the guidance of PhD student Marina Emerick and Master's student Rebekka Lagacé-Cusiac. I have been fascinated by music and its effects on people's brain activity and thus their affect since I was a teenager when I joined a choir school and began learning to play different musical instruments, a passion I've continued into adulthood.\n\nSimon Hawke\n\nHi! I am a 4th-year undergraduate student pursuing an Honours Specialization in Neuroscience and looking to apply to Medical School or Graduate School in the upcoming years after receiving my Bachelor's. I had the pleasure of doing an independent study last year where I got my first taste of a true lab environment and learned so much in regards to writing, collecting data and broadening my knowledge of certain niches of literature. As someone who grew up playing the piano and then got lucky enough to perform in some musical theatre productions in high school, being able to combine elements of music with my love for the brain and interest in neurodegenerative diseases is a best-case scenario. I will be building on my feasibility study from last year by continuing to use functional Near Infrared Spectroscopy (fNIRS) for analyzing brain activity while simultaneously looking at gait patterns and characteristics. Hopefully, in the future, these preliminary trials which we will perform in the upcoming months can allow for a greater understanding of gait patterns in individuals such as those with Parkinson’s Disease and how these characteristics may be actively correlated to changes in brain activity.\n\nJaehyun Hwang\n\nHello there! My name is Jay and I’m a 4th year undergraduate student who is pursuing a degree in Honours Specialization in Physiology and Pharmacology. One of my passions is playing the cello, so I was naturally drawn to the Grahn Lab where we can study the relationship between music and physiology. By working with Dr. Grahn and Rebekka, I am studying how rhythmic context affects temporal ratio perception for my thesis project. As a musician, I have always wondered how our brains perceive and interpret temporal information. The reason why I am specifically studying temporal ratios is because they are an important component in music as well as in speech, so I find this subject extremely interesting and relevant. I am super excited to be contributing to this field of study!​\n\n​\n\nVictoria Ferreira\n\n​​Hi! My name is Victoria Ferreira and I am a 4th year undergraduate student pursuing my Honours Specialization in Psychology. I was drawn to the Grahn Lab because the research conducted here encompasses two of my passions: psychology and the arts. I developed a love for the arts at a young age when I began training in dance at the age of 3 and continued on until I was 18. I also had the privilege of attending a high school for the performing arts where I was able to pursue my passion for dance while exploring other areas such as music, drama, and the visual arts. This year I am looking forward to pursuing my thesis project where I will be investigating how music learning and performance can be optimized through different practice scheduling strategies.\n\nSarah Sequeira\n\nI'm a 4th year undergraduate student, completing my Honours Specialization in Psychology (B.Sc.) and currently working on my thesis at the Grahn Lab, with co-supervision by Dr. Grahn, Dr. Vanden Bosch der Nederlanden and Dr. Swaminathan. I'm looking to explore the relationship between specific acoustic features of music and anxiety levels. In particular, my research aims to experimentally manipulate tempo and mode in musical stimuli and assess whether these differences are associated with changes in participant-reported levels of state and trait anxiety pre-/post-musical listening. I was drawn to the Grahn Lab due to my personal background with music; from playing the tenor horn at the age of 10, to teaching myself guitar and piano as a teenager, and of course, listening to music almost everywhere I go, I personally have experienced the therapeutic effects of this art form in both practice and appreciation, and I'm super passionate about exploring these factors empirically through my research!\n\nPrisca Hsu\n\nHi, I am a 4th-year student pursuing an Honors Specialization in Neuroscience. Music has been an important part of my life as an amateur pianist. Naturally, I joined the Grahn Lab to apply my music and science background in a meaningful way. The translational aspect of music cognition has always excited me, and I have been involved in gait and beat perception/production research in the lab. I worked on analyzing BAT data across healthy younger, older adults and people with Parkinson's Disease this summer with an NSERC USRA. I am thrilled to be continuing my research on the effects of music training on Parkinson's Disease for my honors thesis this coming school year and I look forward to what the future holds! ​\n\nMaya Da Silva\n\nHi, I am a 4th year undergraduate student working towards my honours specialization in psychology BSc. I would describe myself as a creative person, as art and music have always been something I value highly. Science has also always been an interest of mine as I like the idea of creating new knowledge. The Grahn lab caught my attention as I've always thought music to be therapeutic and inspiring, and learning that this can have an impact on health conditions that run in my family, like Parkinson's and Alzheimer's, really pulled me in. This is my first experience in a lab, and I hope to continue helping with research after graduation. I'm self-taught in multiple instruments, including the ukulele, and I have a passion for understanding how dreams and memory are impacted by everyday life.\n\nAlex SH Lee\n\n​​Hi there, I am a 4th year undergraduate pursuing an Honours Specialization in Physiology. My research interest involves studying the effect of feedback and different practice schedules on category induction during musical training. While music (clarinet and violin) has been important in my earlier childhood, I am drawn by the translational potential of my research in the general realm of learning and memory. After all, learning happens everywhere we go! As a blog/media writer and tutor, I am constantly providing feedback for written drafts and teaching other people new skills. In this regard, I always look for ways to be an effective communicator and educator. The research being done at this lab helps me nurture those qualities while taking full advantage of my scientific background. I look forward to exploring a unique field of study and complement my degree with valuable lab skills.\n\nMelissa Ong\n\nHi! I am a fifth year undergraduate student pursuing a dual degree in Honours Business Administration and Honours Psychology. Ever since taking my first psychology course at Western, I have become interested in investigating and broadening my understanding about how the brain works. Though I have little formal musical training, music plays a large role in my everyday life - I enjoy self-teaching myself guitar, creating new playlists, and discovering new music. I am excited to combine my interests of psychology and music for my thesis project as I explore how music affects gait in healthy individuals. I look forward to learning from the team in the Grahn Lab and am excited to contribute to the wealth of research in the lab!\n\n​Duffy Du\n\nHello! I’m a fourth-year undergraduate student pursuing an Honours Specialization in Physiology and Pharmacology. Music has always been a big part of my life. I play a variety of musical instruments such as keyboard, liuqin (a Chinese traditional instrument), clarinet, piano, and many percussion instruments. I have also been a member of the school choir and have trained in dance for over 6 years. I am very excited to have the opportunity to combine my interest with my thesis project to contribute to the field of beat perception research.\n\nBen Shapiro\n\nHey! I'm a fourth year undergraduate student pursuing an Honours Specialization in Neuroscience with a Minor in Computer Science. I've always been fascinated in the cognitive sciences, as the brain and mind both create and our realities and allow us to inhabit those realities. I've worked in labs in the fields of sensory/perception neuroscience, cognitive psychology, biomedical engineering, and computational neuroscience. I've also worked in the research department at Interaxon, a company that has developed consumer dry electrode EEG technology that is compatible with multiple form factors (headband, glasses, virtual reality). Aside from science, music has consistently been one of my passions. I've played various musical instruments for 10+ years and have been composing music for 7 years. Being able to marry music with neuroscience and investigate the intricacies of the human relationship with music is what excites me most about the Grahn Lab.\n\nJP Teselink\n\nMy name is JP Teselink. I am in my final year of my BSc with an honours specialization in Animal Behavior. After growing up on a dairy farm, my fascination with animal behavior set up my curiosity to further understand the brain and mind. My renewed interests in psychology and neuroscience stem from my other passion in mental health research. My previous experiences at Parkwood Institute for Mental Health utilizing TMS (transcranial magnetic stimulation) in treatment-resistant depression have increased my curiosity in using this technology as a research tool. Because music is very much incorporated in my life, I felt the Grahn Lab was the perfect opportunity to broaden my understanding as to how the brain perceives and processes auditory stimuli. Using my experience in TMS, my thesis in the Grahn Lab will be investigating motor system fluctuations during auditory rhythms and beat perception. I hope that my experiences in my lab will further enhance my understanding in the neuroscience field and prepare me for a future career in psychiatric research. If I am not reading up on the latest scientific articles, I like to spend my time in the outdoors, (especially on the farm), travelling and going on adventures.\n\nStephanie Reesor\n\nMy name is Stephanie Reesor and I am an undergraduate student pursuing a BSc Honours Specialization in Psychology. I became cognizant of my passion for psychology and neuroscience after watching a TED talk in my first year at Western. It was entitled “The Brain in Love,” by biological anthropologist Helen Fisher, and I immediately read all of her books. Since then, I have continued to learn as much as possible about neuroscience and psychology from the biological perspective. I have played flute for thirteen years, and my background in music led me to the Grahn Lab. I am now able to connect my newfound passion for neuroscience with my long-held hobby, music. I have previously worked as a research assistant in the shared lab of Dr. Ossenkopp and Dr. Kavaliers at Western University. I am currently working on my honours thesis with the assistance of Molly Henry, post-doctoral fellow. We are examining the efficacy of the Beat Alignment Test (BAT), commonly used in beat perception tasks. In addition, we plan to create improved prototype models of the BAT. ​\n\nDavid Prete\n\n​The past year I completed an undergraduate honours thesis in the Grahn lab. For my thesis looked at the association between enjoyment of music and the desire to move to music under the supervision of Molly Henry and Daniel Cameron. I have been part of the Grahn lab for several years working on various projects examining beat perception, music perception and how we move to music. I have always loved music. I was a huge band geek in high school, and always interested in neuroscience. Being a part of the lab gave me the opportunity to combine these interests. The skills I have learned in the lab have helped me pursue a career in research as I continue to graduate studies in the fall.\n\nJerome Iruthayarajah\n\nHey! My name is Jerome Iruthayarajah, I am a current fourth year undergraduate student in the Honours specialization in Neuroscience. My interest for music began from early age, and was solidified by playing guitar in a variety of bands during my highschool years. As a student in the neuroscience program, the intricacies of brain are extremely fascinating to me; it seemed only natural to mesh old passions and new ones by completing an honours project with the Grahn lab. Working closely with Tram Nguyen, I will be examining the effects musical mood and arousal can have on our executive functions (e.g. planning, working memory, task flexibility, etc.). Executive functioning is important for so many of daily interactions; and abnormalities in executive functioning are implicated in a variety of neurological disorders. If music can mediate executive functioning, such research could prove very fruitful.\n\nAbigail Hunt\n\nHi everyone!
