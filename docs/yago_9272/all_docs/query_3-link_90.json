        "text": "THE AMERICAN SITUATION comedy is wide enough to encompass adolescent capers, romantic flings and even tips on how best to raise a family. But the native form has had problems getting a handle on political comedy. The few more notable attempts to poke fun at our politics and politicians have been decidedly off target. A couple of years ago, ''Hail to the Chief'' gave us Patty Duke as the first female President of the United States, a promising concept that was then buried in frantic efforts to be irreverent. The result was merely sour. Currently, on Fox Broadcasting's new Sunday lineup, ''Mr. President'' is offering George C. Scott as the nation's chief executive, complete with patient wife and adorable family. While the comedy is meant to be light, the always formidable Mr. Scott leaves the impression of an elephant stampeding through marshmallow.\n\nIn at least one outstanding instance, the British sitcom has proven infinitely more adept on the subject of politics. ''Yes Minister,'' produced and directed by Peter Whitmore, was made several years ago, in the early 1980's, and has been around American TV schedules for a while - previously shown on cable's Arts & Entertainment Network and public TV's WNYC, among others. As it happens, the series, adding up to 21 half-hour episodes, is now in the middle of still another run, this time on WNET, Sunday nights at 10. Clever, sophisticated and at times positively brilliant, ''Yes Minister'' is one of those little British series very much worth savoring, even more than once.\n\nCreated and written by Anthony Jay and Jonathan Lynn, the show revolves closely around only three characters: Jim Hacker (Paul Eddington), a Member of Parliament who has just been appointed Minister for Administrative Affairs; Under-Secretary Sir Humphrey Appleby (Nigel Hawthorne), a permanent pillar of the Civil Service who over the decades has seen Ministers of all political persuasions come and go, and Bernard Woolley (Derek Fowlds), Hacker's personal secretary but, as a Civil Service employee himself, with somewhat divided loyalties between Hacker and Appleby. Called in periodically to provide wry dollops of common sense is Hacker's wife, Annie (Diana Hoddinott).\n\nSome of the specific aspects of British politics may occasionally be puzzling to American viewers, but the basic situation is not difficult to grasp. The new Minister has all sorts of ingenious plans for reforming the running of government. He is dedicated and eager for action. On the other hand, the imperious Appleby, along with all the other Civil Service underlings, are determined to keep their jobs intact and unchanged. They spend much of their time trying to foil Hacker or, as they see it, keep him out of harm's way. In the end, nothing is as clear-cut as it may have seemed. More often than not, the smug Appleby winds up the victor, while the well-meaning but naive Minister looks a bit dazed.\n\nOne early episode, for example, had Hacker getting terribly exercised after discovering that the Government was bugging private telephones. But then he found out that he himself was on a ''death list'' supposedly compiled by international terrorists. After getting past Appleby's sarcasm (''Who on earth would want to kill him?''), Hacker decided that perhaps in some cases ''surveillance'' is justified.\n\nAnother episode in this BBC series took on no less an awesome institution than the British Broadcasting Corporation itself. Setting out to do something about the appalling waste in government, Hacker found himself in a BBC radio interview that got onto the subject of civil defense (''The Russians? Who's talking about the Russians?'' snapped Appleby. ''This protects us against the French!''). For security reasons, he was later forced to ask the BBC to kill the program. In a beautifully orchestrated meeting, BBC executives, always adamant about their independence, made a stirring speech about why the broadcasting organization cannot give in to government pressure. That much said, of course, the program was canceled, with the proviso that ''there can absolutely be no question of the BBC ever giving in to pressure.''\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
