        "text": "In a new series by the City Clerk's Office, The Clerk Chronicles, learn all about Palo Altoâ€™s Office of the City Clerk and the services their team provides. From agenda and meeting management to municipal elections, City Clerk duties are outlined in the City Charter and acts as the liaison between the public and City Council. The first in our series shares information about how the Clerk administers the Cityâ€™s local election process. Read here: bit.ly/3WbOZ0y Mahealani Ah Yun Christine Prior\n\nCOUNCIL SWEARING-IN CEREMONY & DECIDING WHO'S DEPUTY MAYOR Now that the local government elections are over and winners declared, Noosa Council has scheduled two critical events/meetings which will be live-streamed so all can watch. The first is the 'Declaration of Office' at 10am on Wednesday 3rd April, which will involve the mayor and councillors being sworn in. They will each commit to and sign the Councillor Code of Conduct and then each will get the opportunity to make a speech. Attendance is by invitation only, including to a yummy morning tea, but livestreaming is for everyone. The first Council meeting of the new Council will be at 10am on Monday 8th April. At this ceremonial meeting the Council will make its first political decisions - voting on who to elect as Deputy Mayor and as representatives on various external boards and groups. Most likely the negotiations about this will take place behind the scenes in advance, so that unanimous votes can result, but if consensus has not been reached, it is possible for Council to vote by secret ballot. For live-streaming, follow this link https://lnkd.in/gsuvXfhk\n\nNews alert: the Government has introduced a bill to lower the voting age to 16 in local elections. LGNZ is always open to any changes that strengthen local democracy and improve participation. Lowering the voting age is one of the many recommendations from an independent review into the future for local government. As part of our wider campaign to push decision makers to choose localism, our member councils are developing a consensus position on the package of recommendations in a bid to drive a future by local government. It will be ready in November, in time for a new Cabinet to take office. We are taking a considered approach to all the recommendations in this review - it's a huge opportunity to shape Aotearoaâ€™s councils and communities for the better, so we need to get it right.\n\nThis week, the #EBRA Board are meeting on Monday and Tuesday, followed by our Summer General Assembly for Members on Tuesday afternoon. At the General Assembly, the Board will connect with the Members to: ðŸ“£ Discuss the recent Annual Report and Accounts ðŸ“£ Present an update on the 2024 Action Plan ðŸ“£ Share progress on work such as the EBRA Strategy and the EBR Pilot Project ðŸ“£ Hear updates from the Working Group Chairs ðŸ“£ Launch our Board elections ðŸ“£ Listen to our Members and respond to any feedback and questions We look forward to seeing you ðŸ‘‹ *** #Europeanbusinessregistries #businessregisters #membersmeeting #boardmeeting Antti Riivari Marco Vianello Maureen O'Sullivan Gesine Freund Ana del Valle Julian Lamb Chiara Gaffuri Stephen Brandon\n\nKey Ideas at a Glance!

Rather than be the end of the world, it is a rational, focused plan to make sure that the second Trump Administration is much better prepared to govern than the first one. What I like is how transparent it is. Lefties, elections have consequences and if Trump wins, his team will be ready on day one. How anyone can have problems with that is beyond me. https://lnkd.in/g7sYM2mk"
