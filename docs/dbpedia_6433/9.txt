So it was just about this time five years ago when G. Love rolled into town to the extreme delight of post-apocalyptic New Orleans local music lovers. The show sold out immediately, and was by all accounts the first such show for the then recently reopened House of Blues. The vibe was electric. The room was filled with the smiling faces of the city's limited population, enabling them, at least for a few hours, to forget about everything going on outside that music hall. For me, it was the first of what would prove a handful of cathartic concerts in the wake of Katrina. His sound back in the day was a pioneering blend of funk, soul and hip-hop which today seems almost commonplace.
