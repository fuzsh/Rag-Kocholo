The relationship between fashion and dolls, however, remained a very close one. After WWII, the plastic fashion doll for children arose from some less than wholesome beginnings, to take the world by storm. In this second of three episodes on the fashion doll, History Unhemmed takes a closer look at some little fashionistas who had a huge impact.\n\nIf you would like, you can support us at:\n\nhttps://www.patreon.com/historyunhemmed\n\nhttps://podcasters.spotify.com/pod/show/historyunhemmed\n\nDrop us a line at historyunhemmedpodcast@gmail.com and/or follow us on social media:\n\nInstagram: @history_unhemmed\n\nFacebook: History Unhemmed\n\nThank you! <3\n\nRESOURCES:\n\nAugustyniak, J.

It soon became a symbol of the modern working woman, and by the early twentieth century, shirtwaists were mass manufactured and widely available. However, this would come at a devastating cost to the workers (mostly women) who produced them. On the afternoon of March 25, 1911, fire broke out at the Triangle Shirtwaist Factory in New York City. This would go down in history as one of the worst industrial disasters in American history and its impact would be felt more than a century later.\n\nIf you would like, you can support us at:\n\nhttps://www.patreon.com/historyunhemmed\n\nhttps://podcasters.spotify.com/pod/show/historyunhemmed\n\nDrop us a line at historyunhemmedpodcast@gmail.com and/or follow us on social media:\n\nInstagram: @history_unhemmed\n\nFacebook: History Unhemmed\n\nThank you! <3\n\nRESOURCES:\n\nBader, Bonnie.
