        "text": "It has been nearly eight years since Hurricane Katrina destroyed large parts of the US Golf region and caused a breach of the New Orleans levee system, which resulted in the flooding of 80 per cent of the city. The storm and subsequent flood had devastating consequences for the mostly black and poor residents who stayed in the city. The failure of the US government to provide fast and efficient help and the media coverage of New Orleans after the levee breach proved the idea of a post-racial America wrong. Instead, American society appeared to be still clearly divided along the categories of race and class."
