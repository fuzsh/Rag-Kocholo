        "text": "IN THIS SPECIAL ISSUE OF Caribbean Quarterly we focus on Caribbean Carnival cultures. The term “Caribbean Carnival cultures” encompasses an analysis of the cultures of Carnival in the Caribbean and its diaspora, but the scholars and practitioners published here also view Carnival as a unique cultural phenomenon rather than merely a group of Caribbean and diaspora-based events. Caribbean Carnival has not received the scholarly attention it deserves in the UK and, after spending several years researching Carnival, Professor Max Farrar and I created a Caribbean Carnival Cultures (CCC) research network,1 supported by the Centre for Culture and the Arts at Leeds Beckett University. The CCC research network is a unique platform bringing Carnival practitioners and academics together in an aim to kickstart Carnival research in the UK and to support and promote Carnival research across the Caribbean and its diaspora. Central to our approach is the belief that Carnival needs to be taken serio...\n\nAn essay in the companion book to the exhibition EN MAS: Carnival and Performance Art of the Caribbean, Farewell, Farewell: Carnival, Performance and Exhibition in the Circum-Atlantic Economy of the Flesh, bids farewell to traditional definitions and representations of Carnival in the Americas in general, and the Caribbean in particular, predicated upon the etymology of Farewell to the Flesh (Carne Levare). Instead, the essay reinsert flesh at the center of the debate about this unique circum-atlantic performance that is Carnival. The first section elicits a modern theory of Carnival in the Americas by introducing a novel etymythology of Carnival as Chariot of the Sea (Carrus Navalis). It asks: \"What became of Carnival during the crossing of the Middle Passage and following the experience of slavery and colonization in the Americas?\". A second section follows closely the eponymous exhibition I curated for Contemporary Arts Center New Orleans by Circumambulating the 2014 Caribbean Carnival season during which myself and collaborator Krista Thompson commissioned performances to 9 artists in 7 different Caribbean cities: Nicolás Dumit Estévez at Santiago de los Treinta Caballeros (Dominican Republic); Christophe Chassol around Fort-de-France (Martinique) ; Marlon Griffith in Port of Spain (Trinidad and Tobago); Charles Campbell and Ebony Patterson in Kingston (Jamaica); Cauleen Smith in New Orleans; Lorraine O'Grady in New York (USA); Hew Locke in London (UK); John Beadle in Nassau (The Bahamas). Through close descriptions and evocations, I show how the various strategies deployed by the artists circumvent carnival altogether. In a third and final section I call for a reinsertion of Carnival within the counter-history of the birth of the museum and begin to suggest ways to expand upon the exhibitionary complex through various curatorial strategies.\n\nA paper given as part of \"consent not to be a single being: Worlding Through the Caribbean\" at the Tate—hosted in partnership with Worlding Public Cultures and the University of the Arts London Research Centre for Transnational Art, Identity and Nation (TrAIN)—to compliment the Tate Britain’s exhibition \"Life Between Islands: British - Caribbean Art 1950s – now.\" According to poet and historian Kamau Brathwaite, the inaugural Carifesta—a 1972 gathering in Georgetown, Guyana, of hundreds of artists celebrating their multiple cultural heritages without precedent and without “foreign magistrates of taste or art”—was one of the most crucial events to have occurred in the region since Emancipation. A council of artists and writers envisioned the shape of the event and aimed to promote art standards based in myriad aesthetic traditions from, their report reads, the “multi-lingual Caribbean plantation culture.” This paper argues that Carifesta was envisaged as a process to redraw—for a mass, regional and diasporic audience—racialized cultural and architectural canons transplanted to and informed by the region during the reign of the colonial plantation. Through engaging contemporaneous theories by Sylvia Wynter and Brathwaite regarding the cultural lives of the enslaved and those of the New World Group and Tapia Group, the paper reads the council’s report as a call to “resurrect” unrecorded images and cultural production systemically omitted from stories of (Euro-)Caribbean aesthetics by those upholding what Wynter terms “plantation ideology.” By attending to the intertwined power of art and architecture, it makes a case that, at its start, Carifesta was a key technology to unmake a colonized Caribbean and build the region, together, anew.\n\nIn the 1970s, in a context of increased racial tensions and growing nationalist claims, the use of rhythms, instruments, and clothing associated with Africa among the black populations of England, Guadeloupe, and Martinique became part of a cultural and political repertoire aimed at resurrecting and denouncing a long history of subordination. Similarly, the mobilization of carnival by Afro-Caribbean activists today can be considered as a tactical choice—that is to say, carnival has become part of the standardized, limited, context-dependent repertoires from which claim-making performances are drawn. Based on ethnographic fieldwork conducted in Fort-de-France, London, and Pointe-à-Pitre between 2000 and 2018, this article analyzes how cultural movements have drawn on carnivalesque aesthetics to both memorialize and display the complex history of black Caribbean populations. I argue that Caribbean carnival has been subject to constant reinterpretations since the eighteenth century and...\n\nFor the full call for participation in Spanish, Portuguese, French, English, and Dutch, please see the attached PDF. Fifty years ago, the first Caribbean Festival of Arts (Carifesta), held in Guyana from August to September 1972, marked a significant and deliberate postcolonial moment that embodied the aspirations of a unified Caribbean. A brochure for the inaugural multidisciplinary and transnational festival stated that Carifesta would “depict the life of the people of the region—their heroes, morale, myth, traditions, beliefs, creativeness, ways of expression” and “stimulate and unite the cultural movement throughout the region.” Carifesta ‘72 aspired to promote the cultural expressions of the multilingual region. The conceptualizers, who included celebrated poet and historian Kamau Brathwaite, poet and activist Martin Carter, and artist Aubrey Williams, expected that the organizing body would craft a festival that embraced and celebrated the multiracial and multicultural heritage of the region despite the polarized national politics of the day. This meant, in theory, celebrating traditions rooted in the indigenous nations, West Africa, India, Indonesia, China, and Western Europe. What transpired when the artists, dancers, musicians, writers, directors, filmmakers, and revelers from across the circum-Caribbean and beyond gathered to exchange ideas and idioms, ancestral stories, and contemporary engagements with tradition? What were the ripple effects of the Carifesta ‘72 event on the region’s (festival) culture, politics, and people? What legacies did it build upon or interrupt? As we approach the 50th anniversary of the first Carifesta (as well as Carifesta XV in Antigua & Barbuda in 2022), we invite scholars, artists, Carifesta ‘72 participants, and the Guyanese and Caribbean diaspora to participate in a three-day virtual symposium organized in association with the Guyana Cultural Association of New York, Inc. as part of the 2022 Guyana Folk Festival... A goal of this symposium is to bring scholars and Carifesta ‘72 participants together to exchange knowledge and to document this festival, which remains in personal and collective memories. We aim to collect physical materials and oral histories to facilitate the creation of a digital archive that could expand to embrace other regional festivals."
