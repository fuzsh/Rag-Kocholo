Among the comedy highlights is the scene in which Costello speaks to Chaney over the phone just when he transforms into a growling werewolf. Capably directed by Charles T. Barton, who was responsible for several other top A&C films. Also with: Frank Ferguson, Vincent Price (the voice of the Invisible Man).\n\nA NOS AMOURS (FRENCH/1984) C/102m. Maurice Pialat's disturbing portrait of a 16-year-old girl (Sandrine Bonnaire) who drifts into a series of meaningless, unfulfilling sexual affairs. Her sexual proclivity can be seen as an attempt to find the love she can't find at home with her squabbling, unhelpful parents. The fact that she gives her virginity to a stranger rather than to her boyfriend who loves her implies that she is afraid of a meaningful relationship that will eventually go sour and that she is exhibiting a sad lack of self-esteem, masochistically and systematically picking men who will dump her-just as her father (Pialat) walks out on his hysterical wife (Evelyne Ker). Pialat's naturalistic vision of lower-middle-class family life is brutal-we even prefer that Bonnaire flee to her depressing romances rather than sticking around for the endless crazy arguments or wild slapping fits that take place each time she shows her face at home. She goes off to these men not only out of spiteful rebellion to hurt her parents for being uncaring, but also because tbafs her only choice. In her debut Bonnaire, a beautiful 16-year-old who looks a bit like the young Diane Lane, is memorable as the unhappy girl; her eyes become progressively more vacant, lonely, and forlorn as her character's chances for happiness vanish. Her nude scenes drew angry response from some critics who questioned Pialat's motives-but I don't think the film is particularly exploitive. It is a bit disjointed-the time frame is really hard to follow, and it's hard to determine how Pialat wants us to respond to the girl's situation or to the father who deserted her. But long after seeing the film you still think about her and those like her who are forced to bring themselves up, long before they have the maturity to know\n\nABOMINABLE DR. PHIBES, THE (BRITISH/1971) C/94m. Not as well made or as lively as Theatre ofBlood (1973), another campy Vincent Price British horror film with a revenge motif, but this is still reasonably enjoyable. Price is badly disfigured (we see how badly at the end) and his wife is killed in an accident. With the help of a beautiful, mute assistant (Virginia North), Price uses an assortment of gruesome methods to get revenge on the nine people he thinks are responsible. Intended victim Joseph Cotten discovers that Price's murders correspond to the ancient \"Seven Curses of the Pharaohs.,, Price is we11 cast as the methodical, obsessed Dr. Anton Phlbes, but at times I wish he'd get more into his \"hammy routine.\" The murders are too grisly, especially for young children, but the film benefits from stylish direction by Robert Fuest and a funny, tongue-incheek script by James Whiton and William Goldstein. My favorite bit has the two detectives assigned to the case, Trout (Peter Jeffrey) and Crav (Derek Godfrey), being told by their superior that from now on they should try to arrive at the mu1:der scene before the murder takes place-it's advice that almost every detective team, especially the British Avengers, should have been given. A solid ending, leading to Fuest's sequel, Dr. Phibes Rises Again. Also with: TerryThomas, Sean Bury., Susan Travers, Hugh Griffith.\n\nABUSE (1 983) B&W/93m.\n\nA gay graduate student\n\n(Richard Ryder) makes a documentary on child abuse to\n\nwhat's good for them. Also with: Dominique Besnehard.\n\ncomplete his degree requirements, choosing as his main case study a teenage boy (Raphael Sbarge) who is being victimized by his parents. As the brutality intensifies, the filmmaker and his subject, who is also gay, become lovers and contemplate running off together. While the production values are low (it was made in 16mm) and the pacing is erratic, the subject matter is thought-provoking and importantand unusual for a commercial film. The almost too realistic scenes in which the boy's father and mother switch in an instant from being loving parents to monsters who take pleasure in systematically torturing their child are among the most harrowing in all of film. You 'II feel the boy's fear when his parents just come in to kiss him goodnight. You'll begin to undersand the syndrome involving supercritical parents and the abused child that prevents either from making an assertive move to stop further violence. But director Arthur J. Brennan's view that a young adult becoming lover/ protector of a teenager is a welcome alternative to his parents battering him-rather than this being just another fonn of cru.ld abuse-is certainly worth arguing about. (Brennan tries to sway viewer by making the teenager independentminded and having the actor playing the part look several\n\nABBOTT AND COSTELLO MEET FRANKENSTEIN (1948) B&W/83m. Coun1 Dracula (Bela Lugosi) intends to implant Costello 's tiny brain in the head of the Frankenstein Monster (Glenn Strange). Meanwhile: as usual, the self-pitying Lawrence Talbot (Lon Chaney, Jr.) searches desperately for a cure for his lycanthropy. Smug critics often refer to this title to indicate just how low both Universal's top comedy team and its famous monsters had sunk by 1948. They 're wrong on both counts. Most A&C fans consider this the duo's finest picture; their interplay is particularly sharp, their routines are strikingly funny, as when the not-so-innocent Costello arranges a double date with Abbott in which he gets both women (Lenore Aubert, Jane Randolph). In one of the few filmc; to deftly combine horror and comedy, the monsters are treated with respect and affection, a far cry from the lampooning they'd be subjected to in future years. Horror fans, who'll appreciate the nifty special effects and make-up, will find the monsters appropriately frightening. Great visual has the Wolf Man dive out a high window and grab Dracula just as he flies\n\n15\n\nyears older.) Oddly, picture has some wit. Extremely controversial and worth a look. Also with: Steve W. James, Kathy Gerber, Jack Halton, Mickey Clark, Maurice Massaro, Susan Schneider.\n\nis handsome, but hasn't the necessary charisma to play a superhero. His cockiness reflects the attitude of the whole production. Intended to be, paradoxically, a \"cult film for the masses,\" it was a surprising failure when hip audiences were turned off by conceited attempt by filmmakers and actors to show off how \"hip\" they were. Richter even promised a sequel at the end of this film. No thanks. Has had some success as a midnight movie. Also with: Jeff Goldblum, Ellen Barkin.\n\nADAM'S RIB (1949) B&W/101 m.\n\nMarried lawyers Spencer Tracy and Katharine Hepburn find themselves opposing each other in a headline-making trial. Hepburn is defending Judy Holliday, a mother and housewife, who caught husband Tom Ewell with his mistress Cara Williams and wildly fired six shots around her apartment. Tracy represents Ewell, who is accusing Holliday of attempted murder. Hepburn bases her defense on the supposition that if Holliday had been a man who found his wife with another man, then she would have been applauded instead of arrested. She uses the trial as a forum to denounce the sexism that prevails in society. Tracy accuses her of making a mockery of the law. Actually his masculine pride is hurt-hurt so badly that he leaves a marriage that had worked because of equality, friendship, and mutual respect. He must then use feminine wiles to get his wife back. Spirited performances by Hepburn and Tracy and Holliday's batty but\n\nADVENTURES OF ROBIN HOOD, THE (1938) C/105m. Robin (Errol Flynn) and his Merrie Men of Sherwood Forest make things difficult for sly Prince John (Claude Rains) and his evil henchman (Basil Rathbone) while loyally waiting for the noble King Richard (Ian Hunter) to return to England from the Crusades and reclaim his throne from his brother. Of course, they take from the rich and give the poor back the money John had unfairly taxed them. This is perhaps the greatest costume adventure of all time. Dashing Flynn and his loveliest screen partner, Olivia de Havilland (gallant as Maid Marian), are as romantic a couple as Romeo and Juliet-fittingly, they even have a balcony scene. And the final swordfight between Flynn and Rathbone (who, off screen, was the superior swordsman) is a classic, complete with gigantic shadows on castle wallsa trademark of Michael Curtiz, who assumed directing duties from William Keighley. The splendid color photography, sets, costumes, and rousing Oscar-winning score by Erich Wolfgang Korngold are all first-rate, effectively transporting us back to an enchanting world. Plus Wamers surrounded the stars with such wonderful character actors as Alan Hale (Little John), Eugene Pallette (Friar Tuck), Una O'Connor, Montagu Love, and Melville Cooper. The casting of Flynn as Robin Hood was pivotal to his career, for it reinforced his Cap1ain Blood image as the sensitive champion of the downtrodden and one of the few freedom-fighter (anti-authoritarian) heroes whom conservative Hollywood has ever accepted. You'd follow Flynn anywhere, sure that his cause is just. Also with: Patrie Knowles, Herbert Mundin.\n\nsensitive delivery spark George Cukor's comedy. It's probably Hepburn and Tracy's best film, yet it has dated as badly as the others. Like the others, it must be seen in the light of its era to appreciate that it was ahead of its time in its treatment of sexual politics. Toe characters do so much grandstanding that the issues get blurred, yet the bright script by married Garson Kanin and Ruth Gordon deserves praise for being a Hollywood film that not only mentioned the term \"sexual equality\" way back in 1949, but also attempted to be something much more significant than the typical battle of the sexes. Also with: David Wayne, Clarence Kolb, Polly Moran, Hope Emerson.\n\nADVENTURES OF BUCKAROO BANZAI ACROSS THE EIGHTH DIMENSION, THE (1984) C/103m. Scatterbrained, sloppily made science-fiction comedy for the stoned-out generation. It's about an all-purpose superhero-a poor man's Jerry Cornelius (Michael Moorcock's creation)--named Buckaroo Banzai, who is a rock star, neurosurgeon, particle physicist, and cool defender of the free world. He does battle with a lot of weirdly dressed aliens and a mad Italian scientist, Lizardo (John Lithgow), for control of an oscillator overthruster that makes it possible for a person to pass through solid matter. The story gets lost because of the chaotic pacing and lack\n\nADVENTURES OF ROBINSON CRUSOE/ ROBINSON CRUSOE (MEXICAN/1952) Cl 90m.\n\nLuis Buiiuel's peculiar adaptation of Defoe's novel is beautifully shot, particularly for such a low-budget film, yet is static and thematically ambiguous. Once Crusoe (Dan O'Herlihy) is stranded on the desert island, the ideal place for self-examination. this haughty slave-dealer feels humbled as he must consider his helplessness and man's insig• nificant place in God's universe. But where he initially is in awe of God and accepts his isolation as fair punishment for his conceit, he becomes furious toward God for abandoning him as well. Does he lose his faith in God and in fact see himself as God in this new domain as he brings order to the wilderness? It's unclear. So is the full meaning of his relationship to Friday (Jaime Fernandez), the cannibal he saves and civilizes: is it that contact between men is more\n\nof continuity, the overabundance of characters who run around in fancy outfits with no place to go, and the fact that firsttime director W. D. Richter (who wrote the script for 1978's Invasion of the Body Snatchers) never bothers to establish where anyone is in relation to anyone else. As played by Peter Weller, Banzai unfortunately turns out to be a pretty conventional hero; his special skills are never really put to work-ifs as if he has them only so the film's publicity releases will sound interesting. He even disappears from the screen for long periods of time without being missed. Weller\n\n16\n\nimportant than that between man and God? Crusoe and Friday become trusting companions, but one can see that Friday considers Crusoe his master and Crusoe seems to agree with him on this. If you want a defiant black, see Richard Roundtree stand up to Peter O!Toole in 1975's Man Friday. Adults will enjoy this film mostly as a Buiiuel curio; oddly, this is the one Bufiuel film that children-who'll respond to the colorful adventure and magical setting and be unaware of the religious ffiemes-will like best.\n\nAcademy Award; for some reason the equally fine Hepburn (who based her character on Eleanor Roosevelt) didn't even get nominated. Filmed in England, the Congo. and Uganda, this is perhaps the cinema's greatest romantic adventure which is set in the 201h century-films such as Romancing the Stone were greatly influenced by it. Photographed by Jack Cardiff. Also with: Peter Bull, Theodore Bikel.\n\nAFTER HOURS (1985) C/96m. Near the end of Martin Scorsese's loopy paranoia-comedy, star Griffin Dunne's character, Paul Hackett, a young New York word processor, stands in front of a seated man and manically summarizes all the ridiculous and tragic things that have happened to him during this one night. It's a striking scene because one can visualize co-producer (with Amy Robinson) Dunne standing before studio execs, telling them in the same manner the weird plot points of this film and getting the same incredulous non-response. (Wisely, the producers decided to complete the film before trying to sell it to a studio.) In the story Paul meets a pretty, dithery young woman (Rosanna Arquette) in a coffee shop. She leaves him her number. Sensing an easy sexual conquest-he's willing to take advantage of her being an emotional cripple due to her break-up with her boyfriend-he calls her up and accepts her invitation to come to her SoHo loft. He leaves his secure Upper East Side apartment and takes a cab to SoHo. The supersonic-speed ride, during which his money blows out the window, is like Alicc•s bumpy descent into Wonderland. Trapped penniless in a nctherland. an enemy zone, every imaginable awful experience happens to him, including his date•s suicide (this is the ultimate \"bad date\" movie). As he flees, on mysteriously empty streets, from a bloodthirsty mob who think he's responsible for a rash of robberies, he runs into the same people over and over and into the same bars, diners, clubs, and apartments that he fled from earlier. SoHo becomes a labyrinth and he's the rat who can't find an exit. Scorsese's film, from a student script by Joe Minion, is literally Paul's nightmare, in which he just can't get home (only in a nightmare would the subway fare jump 60 cents at midnight without advance notice). He's in every scene; everything is taken from his point of view. As in any good nightmare, he loses his money and keys; is hunted down by complete strangers (much like Kevin McCarthy being chased by Body Snatchers); characters he befriends change from helpful to hostile from one meeting to the next and somehow they also seem to know each other; he keeps forgetting the phone number of a friend in the area because a woman (Catherine O'Hara) mixes him up by shouting out random numbers. The film is weH made, but Minion's script is perhaps too facile because there is no need to develop any of the characters. What's most fascinating is that we don't sympathize with Paul because we don't really like him (he's kind of a wonn). But we can identify with his plight. And we recognize him as Everyman, with many of our less noble qualities, including callousness, cowardice, opportunism, selfishness. Dunne is very good; yet this part also would have been ideal for Dudley Moore and, if you\n\nADVENTURES OF THE WILDERNESS FAMILY, THE (1975) C/1 00m. Surprisingly popular in the theaters, now this and its two indistinguishable sequels have become staples on pay television. Traffic, pressure, smog, and health problems force an urban family of four \"back to nature,\" into the Rocky Mountains, where they encounter a whole new series of problems. This is good family fare, I suppose, with lots of pretty scenery and wild animals, particularly bears. Father Robert Logan, enthusiastic star of the similar Shipwreck.', makes a sturdy hero. Susan Damante Shaw may get on your nerves by continuously worrying about her kids' safety, but, considering that their lives really are in danger about every two minutes of screen time, she has the right. In fact, most people who see these films will choose the smog over the dangerous mountain life. Directed by Stewart Raffill. Also with: Hollye Holmes, Ham Larsen, Buck Flowers~ William Cornford.\n\nAFRICAN QUEEN, THE (1952) C/1 05m. A surefire \"feel-good\" movie teaming Humphrey Bogart and Katharine Hepburn under the direction of John Huston. James Agee, John Collier, Huston and Peter Viertel adapted C. S. Forester's novel, and Huston and his stars injected humor and playfulness into the story. Supposedly it had at one time been considered ideal for Charles Laughton and Elsa Lanchester because it bears similarities to The Beachcomber. The setting is German East Africa in 1914. Prim and proper Hepburn (as Rose) is the sister of Methodist minister Robert Morley. When Morley dies, directly because of German infiltration into the jungles, she accepts the invitation of slovenly, alcoholic boat captain Bogart (as Charlie) to flee downriver on his African Queen. She insists that they plan to blow up a German battleship far downstream. At first they can't stand each other, but their perilous journey-she is thrilled when they go over rapids-draws them close together. They become one of the cinema's truly wonderful romantic couples. Neither is reticent about expressing love for the other, even when in the midst of tragedy. Both are supportive of each other; there is a division of labor (he even lets her steer down the rapids); there is mutual respect. How her eyes sparkle with love when she looks at him; she truly believes she has found the best man in the world! And how he smiles and laughs around her-he no longer needs alcohol to make him happy. They constantly hug and kiss, and their endearing gestures have a cheering effect on the viewer. Fifty-three-year-old Bogart and 45-year-old Hepburn get sexier by the minute.

As in other films, Herzog delights in placing characters in hostile environments where, having nothing tangible to fight, they are unable to cope. Eventually their minds become mush from the constant horror, depression,. and fear of death. Aguirre himself has little dialogue, and that is delivered\n\nmovie-audience complacency. We are introduced to our hero\n\nwithout emotion, but seconds after we first see Kinski-\n\nAGE D'OR, L' (FRENCH/1930) B&W/60m.\n\nsneering and snarling, gnarled like Richard m, standing at an angle as if to signify he's at odds with the world, twisting his head before moving his body-we recognize that he is contemptuous of the world and tortured by inner demons. Certainly Aguirre is meant to represent Hitler (though George Annstrong Custer also is appropri~te). But his consistently poor leadership and frustration are treated with such mock delight by Herzog that there's evidence Aguirre is used as a comic villain, and the film itself is, though somberly presented, a comedy about a most embarrassingly unsuccessful expedition, carried out not by heroic figures, but by nefarious Spanish imperialists who deserved the sad end Herzog happily writes for them. Popo1 Vuh's music contributes greatly, making the journey come across as a funeral procession.

Love/sex represents rebellion! The two are separated by police who take them away, but they release him when they learn he has a major position in the Ministry of Good Works. Working his way up, he squashes a beetle, kicks a dog, knocks over a blind man, and slaps an old lady (Lys's mother) who accidentally spilled liquor on him. Meanwhile Lys chases a cow from her bed, parts of Rome crumble, and guests at an elegant party ignore the deaths of a kitchen maid killed by fire and a young boy who was shot by his gamekeeper father after the tot annoyed him. During a concert Modot and Lys make mad love to Wagner music. While he's on the phone ]earning that he has caused millions of deaths since neglecting his job, Lys sucks on the toes of a male statue.

Finally we cut to an isolated hilltop castle where four sadistic libertines have spent De Sade·s \"120 Days of Sodom,,-they emerge and the despicable leader turns out to be Jesus Christ!

He buckles down and becomes part of the motley crew, along with John Ridgely, Gig Young, Harry Carey, George Tobias, Charles Drake, and Arthur Kennedy. The solid, exciting script was provided by Dudley Nichols, with an assist from Hawks's buddy William Faulkner. But contemporary viewers. not so in tune with the film's propaganda value in 1943, may have trouble stomaching finale in which our vengeful heroes mow down helpless Japanese soldiers who are stranded in the ocean. In other Hollywood movies our Gis always showed amazing compassion. Also with: Faye Emerson, Ray Montgomery.\n\nAGUIRRE: THE WRATH OF GOD (WEST GERMAN/1 972) C/90m. Director Werner Herzog took his cast and crew to unexplored regions of South Americasteep mountain ledges and an Amazon tributary-to film his fictional masterpiece ahout a mad Spanish conquistador (Klaus Kinski) who in 1560 leads a mutiny against the leader (Ruy Guerra) of an expeditionary force in search of El Dorado. He then orchestrates an ill-fated journey downriver. He hopes to eventually conquer Mexico, many his own fifteen-year-old daughter (Cecilia Rivera), and found a pure dynasty. It was filmmaking under the most trying circumstances, but the results are priceless; Thomas Mauch's camera has gone back in time to a lost wor]d that is at once beautiful and terrifying. Beginning with an incredible image of perhaps a thousand soldiers in full annor, women in long dresses, and Indian slaves dragging cannons along a narrow, steep mountain path and ending with a delirious image of lone-survivor Aguirre stranded on a monkey-covered raft, with his dead men lying about him, the film is spellbinding; at first it is dreamlike, and ultimately hallucinatory. The journey downriver is fuU of haunting images: ghostly figures\n\nAIRPLANE! (1980) C/86m.\n\nA combination of Airport and Zero Hour as if made by Mad magazine. Actually, this ambitious, amusing spoof was written and directed by three of the founding members of the madcap satirical revue Kentucky Fried Theater: Jim Abrahams and David and Jerry Zucker. When the crew and most passengers are struck down by food poisoning after eating spoi1ed fish, stewardess Julie Hagerty convinces her former flame Robert Hays, an anny pilot who crashed his plane and killed his crew, to land the plane. Back at the airport, Robert Stack and Lloyd Bridges\n\n18\n\ntry to talk him down. Much humor comes from exaggeration of cliches-for instance, when a passenger panics and needs the proverbial \"Thanks, I needed that\" single slap to be returned to her senses, passengers stand in line (many with weapons) to do the honors. Other humor comes from the fact that everything said is taken literally, including the \"s--hitting the fan.\" But the humor comes from all sources: Barbara Billingsley speaking Swahili, co-pilot Kareem Abdul-Jabbar adamantly stating that he never dogs it on the basketball court, pilot Peter Graves talking about nude men in showers to a small boy who visits the cockpit, Hays and Hagerty dancing and her picking him up and twirling him through the air, Robert Stack {who wears two pairs of sunglasses) karate-chopping his way through Hare Krishnas, Moonies and other cultists who flood the airport. Gags come fast and furiously and it's amazing how many are funny. Picture does have dull spots, and eventually runs out of gas-but, all in all, it is a good job. Ken Finkleman directedAirplane II: The Sequel, which reunited Hays, Hagerty, Bridges, and Graves.

(Ironically, Eisenstein's film wouldn't play in Russia until after Hitler broke the Soviet-German non-aggression pact; interestingly, the Order of Alexander Nevsky, eliminated in 1917, was restored in 1942 when Stalin wanted to rally his people against Gennany.) You can take or leave Alexander,s speeches about how Russia will always defeat invaders-it's probable that the real prince's conviction wasn't really so strong, since a few years later he capitulated to occupying Tatar\n\nforces; more fascinating, in the same way that Triumph of the Will is fascinating when Hitler mingles with his adoring subjects, is how Eisenstein humanizes his hero (meant to represent Stalin?) to show that he is not superior to the Russian soldier or peasant, just a better leader. He's a humble fishennan in the opening scene; he never talks down to his men; he lets the people decide what to do with his prisoners; he has compassion and a sense of humor; he•s willing to celebrate with the people after his great victory. Simultaneously. common men are elevated to Alexander's level-Eisenstein films them with a camera tilted upward and sets them in the foreground against the gray sky (there is always space behind them) so that they look enormous, like heroic epic figures of Alexander's magnitude. Importantly, we see the soldiers-not Alexander-in battle. Indeed, the picture has a subplot in which each of two friendly soldiers hopes to win the hand of a young woman by fighting more gallantly than the other. It's like a stock Hollywood storyline, only in this case the woman is also a warrior, fighting alongside the men. The scene in which she helps both male friends off the battlefield is a classic. Eisenstein 's picture is kno\\\\in for its remarkable close-ups, innovative use of the frame (whereby action is taking place in several different planes and as far back as the eye can see), beautiful shots of man and landscape, mix of realism and theatricality, gorgeous pageantry, and Sergei Prokofiev's grand score (which becomes oddly jovial when the Russians get the upper hand in battle). The climactic Battle on the Ice, a lengthy, precisely directed sequence that employs thousands of warriors and horses, is perhaps the greatest battle scene in movie history. It can't be described properly-it must be seen-but I suspect Eisenstein received special pleasure from directing the segment in which the ice breaks and hundreds of Gennans drown. We are seeing Russia itself literally swallow invaders. I admit that some Russian classics are boring, but not this masterpiece.

While everyone on a recently departed plane and back at the airport tries to sort out their personal problems, things become tense when a bomb explodes on the plane, causing great damage. Will the crippled plane make it back to the airport'? Will George Kennedy be able to clear a runway for an attempted landing? Will anyone in the all-star cast admit they recognize some of the other stars? A polished \"commerciar' Hollywood film, but it might have been really something if Irwin Allen, rather than Seaton, had been director. Surely a hurricane and airport fire would have been thrown in for good measure. Also starring Dean Martin, Burt Lancaster, Jacqueline Bisset, Martha Hyer, Helen Hayes, Jean Seberg, Maureen Stapleton, Van Heflin (as the mad bomber), Barry Nelson, Dana Wynter, Lloyd Nolan, Barbara Hale.\n\nALEXANDER NEVSKY (RUSSIAN/1938) B&W/\n\n105m.\n\nA monumental achievement by Sergei Eisenstein. It's his greatest film, a visual tour-de-force about Russia's heroic I 3th-century prince (Nikolai Cherkasov) who-three years after repelling the Swedes-forms a great army to wage war against the seemingly invincible Germans who have invaded the country. It's a peerless propaganda piece that extols Russian nationalism, displays the courage of the common Russian in battle, and viciously attacks Germany, Russia's historical enemy, which in the 1930s was again on an imperialist march in which impersonal medieval-like sol-\n\nALGIERS (1938) B&W/95m.\n\nIrresistible, hot-blooded romance set in_ Algiers's Casbah, with Charles Boyer as suave jewel thief Pepe le Moko and luscious Hedy Lamarr (her American debut) as Gaby, the already engaged Parisian woman who melts his heart. Although they are in the drab Casbah, when they kiss they feel as if they were in their beloved Paris. Police want to lure Boyer out of the Casbah so they can arrest him. Lamarr is wrongly informed Boyer is dead so that she won,t visit him as promised. They realize\n\n19\n\nBoyer will come out of the Casbah to find the woman he loves. Beautifully photographed by Jaines Wong Howe, this dark, exotic, highly atmospheric film has the distinct look of a \"thirties classic.'' Opening, in which we see documentary footage of Algiers and the Casbah, is very effective in transporting us out of Hollywood and into the faraway world. Character actors are convincing playing assorted foreigners. And Boyer and Lamarr are memorable screen lovers. Director John Cromwell's film is a remake of the 1937 French film Pepe le Moko, starring Jean Gabin; Tony Martin would have the lead in the 1948's Casbah. Written by John Howard Lawson, with additional dialogue by James M. Cain. Also with: Sigrid Gurie, Joseph Calleia, Gene Lockhart, Johnny Downs, Alan Hale, Stanley Fields, Leonid Kinskey, Joan Woodbury.\n\nThe Hollywood-style happy ending ruins the picture for many viewers, but I find it a relief after watching Alice suffer through the society dance, at which her brother (her date) is the only person (until MacMurray comes along) who pays attention to her, and the disastrous dinner when MacMurray comes to her house. It's probable that women like this film better than men because they can relate to Alice blowing it in public, in front of an attractive man, by trying too hard, talking too much, and smiling and laughing in an attempt to conceal her nervousness and embarrassment. But I find it too painful to watch (it's like Shirley Macl..aine putting on that hideous dress for her wedding in Sweet Charity and having her fianc~ change his mind). This was George Stevens 's first major directorial assignment. Most impressive are his close-ups of Hepbum's smooth, beautiful face with her wet lips and those intelligent, sparkling eyes that reveal Alice's simultaneous feelings of excitement and fear. Stevens's evocation of small-town America is reasonabl~, but, despite a scene-stealing performance by Hattie McDaniel, the depiction of \"colored\" people is regrettable. Florence Vidor starred in a 1923 silent version. Also with: Charley Grapewin, Evelyn Venable, Hedda Hopper.\n\nALI-FEAR EATS THE SOUL/FEAR EATS THE SOUL (WEST GERMAN/1974) C/94m. For those who consider the films of Rainer Werner Fassoinder too esoteric and perverse, here is one that has universal appeal. In fact, it was Fassbinder's breakthrough film internationally, the reason many people worldwide were willing to examine his more difficult, less accessible films. Set in Munich, it tells of the romance and marriage of a short, dumpy, 60-year-old German widow (Brigitte Mira) and a tall, handsome, young Moroccan (El Hedi Ben Salem) who we later discover is developing an ulcer from the constant racial prejudice he and other Arabs in Germany are subjected to. Once married, Mira is ostracized by her neighbors, friends, and adult children. The couple is strong enough to endure this, and eventually there are some signs of acceptance (the local shopkeepers make up to Mira when they realize they need her business). But in time Mira's own prejudices surface and threaten to shatter the marriage. A simple, extremely poignant film, all the more fascinating because Fassbinder deals with racial prejudice in modem Germanyagainst Arabs, not Jews. Fassbinder admired the work of Douglas Sirk, and critics were quick to point out film's similarity to Sirk\"s All That Heaven Allows. Also with: Barbara Valentin, Inn Hennann, Fassbinder.\n\nALICE DOESN'T LIVE HERE ANYMORE (1974) C/11 3m. Martin Scorsese directed this film which was considered a breakthrough by feminists not because it presents a woman who achieves full liberation and fulfilling self.,.sufficiency-this doesn't happen-but because it presents a real woman who relies on herself to solve problems that are common to single mothers. Ellen Burstyn deserved her Oscar for her multi-faceted portrayal of Alice Wyatt, a recently widowed New Mexico housewife who worries about how she 'II support herself and her likable but unsupportive 12-year-old son (Alfred Lutter). They drive toward Monterey, California, where Alice was raised. She intends to resume the singing career she gave up when she married. They live in a motel in Phoenix when Alice gets a job singing in a bar, but flee town when the man (Harvey Keitel) Alice is seeing turns out to be a married psychopath. Alice takes a waitress job at Mel 's Diner in Tucson and has an affair with David (Kris Kristofferson), a nice-guy rancher. But she still plans on going to Monterey. To me, this is a film about the fears a woman feels when she finds herself on her own: Alice is afraid that she can't make enough money, that she can't sing, that her son will think her a bad mother (does any other film deal with this significant theme?), that she won't make friends (she befriends foul-mouthed waitress Diane Ladd), that she won't find another man, and that if a man pursues her, she won't make correct decisions about him. What's admirable is that she deals with her fears headon, despite her obvious insecurities. That Scorsese ended the film with Alice getting a man angered many people because they thought it traditionally Hollywood. But I don't think he was pandering to the mass audience at the expense of her hard-earned independence. If he'd had Alice reject the \"perfect\" David, he might have been accused of pan-\n\nALICE ADAMS (1935) B&W/99m.\n\nKatharine Hepburn had one of her greatest successes playing the young heroine of Booth Tarkington's Pulitzer Prize-winning novel. Alice is a smart, imaginative, energetic, yet dissatisfied small-town girl. She cov.ets being on equal social footing with her richer acquaintances. When she meets a nice young man (Fred MacMurray), she is afraid to tell him that her family is poor. Instead she makes up stories about her fainily 's wealth and her own good breeding. Alice is so obsessed with improving her social standing that she assumes an affected attitude whenever she leaves her house. We'd dislike her except that we admire her love for and loyalty to her weak father (Fred Stone), pushy mother (Ann Shoemaker), and irresponsible brother (Frank Albertson), despite their constantly letting her down and causing her grief; we understand her desperate need to escape her sad home life.\n\n20\n\ndering to feminists as Paul Mazursky was because of Jill Clayburgh rejecting \"perfect\" Alan Bates 's proposal in An Unma\"ied Woman. It makes sense that Alice would chance a relationship with David, especially since her son could use an adult around he wilJ listen to. Visually, Scorsese's greatest accomplishment is that he conveys that people in America don't stand on firm ground, are never comfortable in their settings, feel disoriented and unsettled. Film has much humor, especially in the scenes between Alice and her son, but it is hard-edged throughout. Keitel is terrifying. Written by Robert Getchell, photographed by Kent L.

Ridley Scott's film is loved by many science-fiction fans-it was an enonnous hit-but despised by others. I find it underrated: an extremely scary, well-made, interesting film. It has been criticized for being a violent, bigbudget rip-off of a cheap fifties SF film, It! The Terror From Beyond, but surely the basis for Dan O'Bannon\"s script was Dark Star, the comedy he co-wrote with John Carpenter. Although a comedy, it, too, dealt with the melancholia, claustrophobia, and irritation suffered by crews on long space voyages, had a female-voiced computer, and had a centerpiece in which O'Bannon the actor searched the ship for an escaped alien creature which kept jumping out and attacking him. Picture is first space film that has workingclass heroes rather than scientists and astronauts flying a ship. I believe it is the first sci-fi film since Scream and Scream Again to .advance creepy notion that scientists will have such egos they'll create scientist-androids .. Thanks to design work by H. R. Giger, Ron Cobb, and Michael Seymour, film is stunning-the alien is truly imposing, but also memorable are the vagina-like entrances to the derelict ship and the enormous skeleton pilot, as well as the ofd, uninviting, disheveled interiors of the Nostromo. The direction by Scott is as imaginative as it is (properly) manipulative; he builds tension by having characters talk in hushed tones, smoke incessantly, drink coffee, pace nervously, sweat, argue. He also manages to pull off bloodless killingsbecause Hurt's death is so graphic, he could leave the others to our imagination. Importantly, the final sequence during which Weaver does her famous strip, realizes .she's being observed by the alien, and tries to outwit it, is no letdown. Interestingly, Scott thought the creature was interested in Weaver's Ripley only as a host for its eggs, while Weaver believed it also had sexual designs on Ripley. Weaver also is the star of James Cameron's sequel. Cast also includes: Tom Skerritt (as the captain), Veronica Cartwright, Yaphet Kotto, Harry Dean Stanton.\n\nALICE, SWEET ALICE/COMMUNION/HOLY TERROR (1977) C/96m- 108m. Little girl (Brooke Shields 's debut) is strangled in church by a figure in a yellow raincoat and mask just prior to her taking her first communion. Her jealous, mean older sister, Alice (Paula Sheppard)-who has been denied communion-is the logical suspect (after all, she has a yellow raincoat and mask). But her mother and her father, who has remarried, work with the young local priest to try to figure out who really is responsible. Cult horror film is guaranteed to keep you tense. The attack scenes are not for the faint-hearted. Director Albert Sole uses the horror genre to attack Catholicism, which brings little peace to its constituents. Picture is set in Catholic community of Paterson, New Jersey, in 1961, at beginning of first Catholic Presidency. All the characters attend or work in the church, yet all are sinners or were born out of sin; significantly, the church does not help these confused, guilt-ridden, emotionally misunderstood church members-which is why a maniac (Alice?) is on a God-told-me-to rampage to wipe out other sinners. Pictme is full of offbeat touches and characters (i.e., enormous Mr. Alfredo). Well made, but beware. Also with: Linda Miller, Mildred Clinton, Louisa Horton, Tom Signorelli, and in bits: Lillian Roth and professional wrestling legend, the late Antonino Rocca.\n\nALL OF ME (1984) C/93m. A soul-transmigration experiment is fouled up, and the spirit of the late cantankerous millionairess Edwina Cutwater (Lily Tomlin) enters the body of lawyer Roger Cobb (Steve Martin), who despised her. Edwina and Roger vie for control of his bodywhich really ruins his love life-and somehow fall in love. Martin is terrific, particularly doing physical comedy that requires his movements to incorporate female traits. He won the Best Actor Award from the New York Film Critics, but was denied an Oscar nomination. Unfortunately, Lily Tomlin, a great physical comedienne herself, is limited to just being a head-and-shoulders reflection in mirrors Martin looks into. Carl Reiner's direction is slipshod and obvious; he is saved at times by the originality of Martin and Richard Libertini, who plays a silly swami. The script by Phil Alden Robinson (adapted from Ed Davis's novel Me Two) is so stupid that in order for there to be a happy ending the audience is expected to believe that the vain, beautiful villainess (Victoria Tennant) would prefer living in the body\n\nALIEN (1979) C/117m. Frightening, ferocious science-fiction film that incorporates many elements of the horror film. The cargo ship Nostromo heads back to earth, carrying its load. The crew members are awakened with orders from the home corporation (the real villain of the piece because it sacrifices people for discovery) to investigate a signal on nearby planet. They find a derelict ship containing a giant skeleton pilot, and, below, a hatchery. In a terrifying sequence John Hurt looks inside a pod and a creature attaches itself to his face. Against the advice of cocaptain Sigourney Weaver (her debut), science officer Ian Holm lets Hurt come aboard. The creature on his face falls off, but a new creature bursts through his stomach and hides in the huge ship. It grows to enonnous size and kills off the crew one at a time until only Weaver (her Ripley is a 21\n\nof a horse to going to prison. Also with: Madolyn Smith, Dana Blear. ·\n\nby Alan J. Pakula, scripted by William Goldman, and played by Robert Redford (Woodward) and Dustin Hoffman (Bernstein), it is one of the cagiest films ever made. We are enthralled, although not much happens-major discoveries by the two investigative reporters are few and far between. As he had done with The Parallax View,--Pakula steeps his film in paranoia. Woodward and Bernstein are shown in close-up as they talk to strangers on the phone, trying to wangle information out of them. They sweat slightly as they bluff prior knowledge about what the people are divulging or insinuating-they worry that the people will stop in midsentence and question their right to ask such things. Because we don't see the people the reporters speak to, they naturally become mystery figures-Pakula gives them nervous, reticent, suspicious deliveries so we feel they all have something to hide or that they're the types who might arrange for something nasty to happen to the hard-pushing reporters. If Pakula had moved the camera back from the reporters and directed the actors on the phone to speak in friendly, cooperative tones (using the same dialogue), we would feel no suspense. And if he didn't repeatedly show our reporters going alone, mostly at night, to the doors of people who don't want to speak to them or who are reluctant to reveal all they know, or, as in Woodward's case, meeting his contact \"Deep Throat\" in an underground garage so dark we can t see faces, we wouldn't think that our two heroes are so vulnerable (or so brave). Near the end we are told that they are in danger-we felt it all along-but nothing comes\n\nALL QUIET ON THE WESTERN FRONT (1 930) B&W/105m-140m. The most famous pacifist film is not as grisly as Erich Maria Remarque's novel, but has enough horror and brutality to drive its anti-war theme home a hundred times over. Story deals with German teenagers who enlist during WWI after hearing a rousing pro-militaristic speech by their professor. They soon discover that war has nothing to do with gallantry, duty, or the right cause. They suffer through bombings, gassings, massacres, handto-hand conflicts; men are wounded 1 blinded, have legs amputated, are killed. The dialogue scenes are static, but the human story is powerful; we do listen in the scene when the soldiers lament about there always being unwanted, unneeded wars; and director Lewis Milestone's visuals of the battle scenes are still impressive (i.e., his camera pulls back over men fighting in a trench; his camera pans as soldiers are mowed down by machine guns)-and effec-\n\ntively convey that being a soldier is a terrifying prospect. Famous scene in which Lew Ayres kills a French soldier with a knife and weeps for his dead \"brother\" is hokey but still moving. Best of all is the scene in which Ayres returns to his school and tells his professor's new students just how awful war is, and that it isn't \"beautiful and sweet to die for your country.\" A memorable final shot. It's unfortunate that films like this are never made when a war is in progress.\n\n9\n\nThe Road Back, a sequel, was made in 1937.

Acting is excellent, particularly by Jason Robards, Jr., who won a Best Supporting Actor Oscar as the Posts managing editor, Ben Bradlee. Another plus is that we get a sense of the inner workings of a newspaper and how individual reporters pursue a story (i.e., phone calls, legwork, paperwork). Woodward and Bernstein are shown to be manipulative, driven, willing-to-fib reporters-\n\nAlexander, Edmund Breese.\n\nALL THAT JAZZ (1979) C/123m.\n\nBob Posse's stylized, semi-autobiographical musical about a hopelessly overworked Broadway and movie director (Roy Scheider) who suffers a heart attack that should, but doesn't really, give him a new perspective on life and death. Film starts out like a house afire, with beautifully choreographed, erotic-almost lewd-dances. But once Scheider has his attack that sends him to the hospital, the picture deteriorates into a never-ending wave of self-indulgence. You really get to hate Scheider's character. ~•Bye Bye, Life\" finale, during which Fosse, Scheider, and company do to the Everly Brothers what TV commercial jingles do to many of our standards, is perhaps the most annoying production number in cinema history. Picture will be enjoyed most by those involved in theater or film. Ann Reinking is Scheider's girlfriend; Jessica Lange was rescued from King Kong by Fosse, who had her play the temptress Death.

The brutal interplay between Cruise and Nelson is familiar but well handled, and it has a somewhat surprising resolution (how many of you had coaches who admitted they were wrong about something?). But what makes the film noteworthy is Lea Thompson's extremely mature and appealing portrayal of Cruise's supportive girlfriend, who, despite being a gifted musician, realizes no scholarship will pull her out of this dead-end town. The scene where she chastises Cruise for thinking only of himself is really special, as is their one love scene. Opportunists Cruise and Nelson both learn valuable lessons from this unselfish girl.

Posing ac; reporter Ivan Johnson, tough Lemmy is really trying to get the lowdown on this computer-run, robotized society where technology has replaced humanity; where there is repression/murder of all who don't think logic any; whose women, like the leader's daughter, Natasha (Anna Karina), have numbers tattooed on their backs and function as first-, second-, or third-class prostitutes/seducers; where words such as \"conscience\" and \"love\" do not exist in its Bible-dictionary. It's Lemmy's job to destroy the computer, which will, in turn, cause Alphaville's destruction. Picture has the novel twist of having a two-fisted tough guy teaching a sensual female the meaning of \"love\"; the political themes aren't that novel, but Godard's direction is consistently offbeat and fascinating. His use of flickering lights (including those from Lemmy's camera), sounds (including a monstrous male voice on a loudspeaker), ominous suspense music, choice settings (especially narrow hallways), and sudden, unexpected actions by characters (i.e., Lenny shoots first, before asking questions) makes us feel we 're in another world whose look and rhythm are different from our own. Film isn't altogether successful, but it has moments of brilliance. The casting of \"B\"-movie actor Constantine was inspired. The ending anticipates the one in Blade Runner. Exc,eptional cinematography by Raoul Coutard. Also with: Akim Tamiroff (as a coITUpted exagent, looking like his co-star in Touch ofEvil, Orson Welles), Howard Vernon (as the leader Professor von Braun, alias Nosferatu).\n\nmake a strong finale to the picture, and he watches a string of imaginative, brutal yet funny visual gags. Black-andwhite live-action sequences full of slapstick humor and dealing with a Felliniesque orchestra (comprised of old ladies) and a silly animator (who was taken out of prison to draw images to fit the music) precede and follow all the animation vignettes. Film is a nice change of pace from typical repertory-theater fare, but you have to be in right mood to enjoy it.\n\nALLIGATOR (1980) C/94m.\n\nFor decades there have been unfounded but imagination-stirring rumors of alligators roaming around urban sewer systems as a result of tourists, returned from Florida, flushing souvenir live baby alligators down their toilets. Surprisingly, this was the first film to exploit the subject, which is obvious horror-film material. Picture is set in Chicago, where a police detective (Robert Forster) investigates a series of disappearances in the sewers and discovers evidence of a giant alligator on the loose. John Sayles's script is sharp, Lewis Teague's direction is competent, and Henry Silva has a ball playing a big-game hunter detennined to bag his greatest animal. The film, which is played for laughs, would have worked better if it took itself more seriously end to end (which wouldn't have meant it couldn't have humor). Also, I wish the phonylooking giant alligator would stay in the dark sewers, where it's scary, instead of walking outside, where it's silly. Also with: Robin Riker, Michael Gazzo, Perry Lang, Jack Carter, Bart Braverman, Dean Jagger.\n\nALTERED STATES (1980) C/102m.\n\nPsychopsychiatrist Eddie Jessup (William Hurt) spends many years searching for Ultimate Truth and his Original Self by undergoing dangerous sensory-deprivation experiments. His\n\n23\n\nto be happiness. So often do they expose their innermost thoughts and emotions, sexual fears and confusion about marriage and relationships, and worries about being alone or misunderstood, and so constant is their hugging, kissing, and crying that we're made to feel we got waylaid to an intense weekend therapy session. Moreover, it's not easy to warm to these people. It's obvious that Jaglom still loved Townsend when making this film. And that's touching. But just because he's so taken with the way she can laugh naturally (usually through her tears) on film, it doesn't mean we can stand this happening every time she delivers a line. He allows Townsend, through her character, to express the reasons she left him, hoping they wm he exposed to her and us as simplistic and foolhardy. Yet the more you see of Jaglom/Dave with Townsend/Judy, the better you can understand why she would leave him-although you won't be able to pinpoint the reasons either. Also with: director Bob Rafelson (as Dave's neighbor), Michael Emil, Andre Gregory as the \"life is a stone\" party philosopher.\n\nobsessive quest causes the break-up of his marriage to anthropologist Emily (Blair Brown), who finds it frustrating that he's incapable of love. But she's there to help him when his experiments get out of hand due to injections of an ancient hallucination-causing Mayan mushroom solution. He has begun to experience genetic change, at one point turning into an apeman (and going on a rampage), and as his regression continues, he moves into an embryonic state and is sucked toward nothingness at the moment of Man's creation. Jekyll-and-Hyde variation, which Paddy Chayefsky based on John Lilly's mind-expansion experiments in the mid-sixties, takes viewers on ambitious, if hokey, explun1tiun of man's u1igiu~ and advances intriguing theory that there can be genetic change if one's consciousness is manipulated. Then, toward the end, film drops several intellectual planes and makes simplistic points: there is no Ultimate Truth and the only thing of importance is Love. Jessup's rejection of his findings makes us want to forget deciphering all the religious symbolism we've seen in his hallucinations-after all, even he thinks them irrelevant. Thus the film unfortunately avoids controversy. Neverthe'.\" less there's much that is noteworthy. The blasting soundtrack won the picture an Oscar. Bran Ferren's special effects are often ill-chosen but dynamic; and FIX fans will delight in the legendary Dick Smith's remarkable make-up work. Working from Chayefsky 's overwritten script, Ken Russell keeps things under surprising control for a change. Best of all are his close-ups of Emily when she reacts with dazed amazement at Eddie 's strange thought processes. Russell smartly establishes a contrast between the passionate work done by Emily and the maniacal work of Eddie, thus reaffirming the thrill of exploration to viewers turned off by Jessup. Excellent ensemble acting by Hurt, Brown, Charles Haid, and Bob Balaban. Also with: Thaao Penghilis, Dori Brenner, Miguel Gideau (as Eddie's primitive form), Drew Barrymore.\n\nAMADEUS (1984) C/158m.\n\nOscar-winning, largescale adaptation of Peter Shaffer's 1979 fictional play about the obsessive jealousy an 18th-century Italian hack composer, Antonio Salieri, felt for Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart's musical genius. It was scripted by Shaffer and directed by Milos Forman. As told by Salieri ( R Murray Abraham) from his asylum cell, years after Mozart's death-for which he insists he was responsible. Twenty-six-year-old Mozart (Tom Hulce) arrives in Vienna in 1781. Salieri is the court composer of Hapsburg Emperor Joseph II (Jeffrey Jones) and his unimaginative operas and technically expert but uninspired compositions are extremely popular. Salieri immediately recognizes Mozart•s talents, although Joseph and the Viennese do not, and is tormented not only because his own music can't compare to the young boy's but because God pulled a double-cross by giving the shockingly vulgar Mozart the musical genius that Salieri thought he himself deserved. While pretending to be Mozart's one supporter in Vienna, he swears to destroy him. The acting is great, but while the characters are interestingly unusual the first time we see them, they don't vary in the slightest from then on. Anyone could fill in their dialogue, reactions, etc. In fact, each time a group of characters gets t9gether, they virtually replay an earlier scene-there are only about four basic scenes in the movie, which are repeated in different settings. The dialogue and situations are embarrassingly anachronistic-trite \"newlywed\" chatter between Mozart and his young wife (Elizabeth Berridge, who looks straight out of period's portraits) about money problems and sex, and Mozart's stem, interfering pop (Roy Dotrice) could have been lifted from bad fifties TV comedy, and if characters weren't in fancy period dress, sure viewers would have laughed it off screen. Indeed, the picture's major premise, dealing with the sad discrepancy between Salieri 's popular music, and Mozart's good unpopular music, was undoubtedly inspired by sad reality that today's most talented rock musicians/rock singers are not necessarily the ones that make\n\nALWAYS (1986) C/105m.\n\nWe've all been stuck next to a stranger in a bus or plane who insists on telling all the mournful details of a personal relationship while we sit there thinking, uy don't want to know~H Thafs how I feel when watching director-writer Henry Jaglom's seriocomical examination of his break-up with his actress wife, Patrice Townsend. Jaglom plays the male lead, Dave, and Townsend, oddly enough, plays his female lead, Judy. Two years after Judy walked out on Dave she comes over to sign the divorce papers. But since it's obvious that the two are still very much in love, the notary refuses to sign the decree until they've thought it over for a few more days. Judy becomes ill from Dave's cooking and ends up spending the Fourth of July weekend with him. Joining this divorcing couple at Dave's LA home are their friends, a \"happily\" married couple (Joanna Frank, Alan Rachins) and an engaged-to-be-married couple, Judy's younger, free-spirited loving sister (Melissa Leo) and a passive boy (Soup for One director Jonathan Kaufer) she met in New York. The six people keep splitting up and discussing what they consider\n\nrm\n\n24\n\nthe most money. However, period detail and lavish recreations of excerpts from four Mozart operas give the film immense flavor. Also, it should be applauded for trying to convey what it is to be an artistic genius, and to show a genius actually in the act of creating. The scene 01 which the dying Mozart dictates his requiem to Salieri while we hear the music jumping from his mind is truly exciting. Cinematography by Miroslav Ondricek. Also with: Christine Ebersole, Charles Kay, Kenny Baker, Lisabeth Bartleff.\n\nwhich was also based on a Highsmith novel. In Germany to seU a painting, Ripley is slighted by Jonathan (Bruno Ganz), a simple Swiss frame-maker, who won't shake his hand because of his shady reputation. Insulted, Ripley secretly recommends Jonathan to a rich criminal friend (Gerard Blain) who is looking for a non-criminal to assassinate Mafia men. Knowing Jonathan has leukemia, Tom starts a rumor that he is no longer in remission. Soon Jonathan believes he is about to die. Wanting to leave money to wife and child after his death, he is talked into committing the crimes-although he has never done an incorrect act in his life. Meanwhile he and Tom become friends, while his marriage to Marianne (a fine performance by Lisa Kreuzer, Wenders's wife) deteriorates because of his lies about his activities. Tom helps Jonathan with a murder on a train and together they battle the Mafia men who track them down. Conscience, guilt, and morality based on a religious code were important to Highsmith but Wenders doesn't deal with these themes. As his world has no God, he is concerned with existential themes (depressed Ripley worries that his meaningless life is endless; depressed Jonathan fears his life will soon be over) and male bonding and friendship between opposites. Both aliens in their respective environments, Tom admires Jonathan's stable family life, while Jonathan admires Tom's freedom from family responsibilities and his criminal activities-he is appreciative that Tom helps him engage in excitement before he dies. Highsmith didn't like this film (her su.ave Ripley character was turned into a tormented, drunken existentialist), but in its own way it's just as exciting, enjoyable, and thought-provoking as her novel. Also with: Peter Lilienthal, Daniel Schmid, Sandy Whitelaw, Jean Eustache, Lou Castel, Wenders.\n\nAMARCORD (ITALIAN/1974) C/127m. Federico Fellini's Oscar-winning nostalgia piece takes place in the early thirties in a small Adriatic town that is much like Rimini, where the director grew up. He is represented in the film by a blond, lightheaded teenager (Bruno Zanin) who, like all his friends, thinks constantly of women with big breasts and big rears. The best parts of the film deal with Zanin and his horny pals.' The sequence showing how the kids react (usually by pulling pranks) to their weird teachers is a classic. Also funny is a bit in which Zanin excites a· 300-pound woman by lifting her off the ground repeatedly and is rewarded with a chance to smother himself in her enormous breasts. Better is a family dinner during which Mama refuses to eat, Mama and Papa (Armando Brancia) argue (as they must do every night), Zanin eats like a pig, the emotionless uncle juggles and eats from a plate he holds in his hand, Papa chases Zanin from the house for having urinated on a man's hat at the movie thcater, and Grandpa slips into the next room to break wind. The picture isn't all comedic, but those are the best moments-unfortunately, they come mostly at the beginning. A couple of anecdotes, presented stylistically, about peripheral adult characters in the town really slow down the picture. The scene in which the father is punished by the fascists for some indiscreet remarks is well done, but seems out of place in this otherwise apolitical film. The first halfhour is marvelous-the rest of the film is extremely erratic. Also with: Magali Noel, Ciccio Ingrassia, Giuseppe Lanigro, Puppela Maggio, Josiane Tanzilli.\n\nAMERICAN GIGOLO (1980) C/117m. Richard Gere is a self-assured, flashy male prostitute who becomes the prime suspect in the brutal murder of a woman with whom he had a late-night session (in front of her sadistic husband). Director-writer Paul Schrader includes references to the work of Robert Bresson, but what he tries to pass off as art is simply trash; ugly and dirty. Gere 's much publicized love scene with Lauren Hutton, as the only person who remains loyal to him, may titillate some, but the rest of the sexual content is fairly repulsive. This is a thoroughly unconvincing, terribly made movie that was designed solely to arouse viewers unaccustomed to seeing big stars like Gere take such embarrassing roles. Blondie's song \"Call Me\" may be best thing in film. Also with: Hector Elizondo, Nina Van Pallandt.\n\nAMERICAN FRIEND, THE (WEST GERMAN-\n\nFRENCH/1977) C/123m. Wim Wenders's dazzling psychological thriller, adapted from Ripley's Game by Patricia Highsmith, was the first film of West Gennan film renaissance to be truly accessible to American audiences. That's because the colors are splashy rather than subdued; there are references to familiar English-language rock songs; the picture is set partly in America, and English is the dominant language; Dennis Hopper (as Tom Ripley) costars, and supporting parts are played by well-known American directors Sam Fuller (.as a Mafia man) and Nicholas Ray (as the supposedly dead artist whose paintings Ripley sells). Moreover Wenders's sharply edited action sequences are influenced by Fuller; his use of the frame as an arena for tension and to expose character isolation was influenced by Ray. The storyline and characters, however, are most reminiscent of Hitchcock, specifically Strangers on a Train-\n\nAMERICAN GRAFFITI (1 973) C/11 Orn. George Lucas directed this wonderfully exuberant youth comedy which is set one eventful night in Modesto, California, in 1962. Made by a filmmaker in a cynical era, it's an idealized remembrance of things past, of innocent youth spent eating fries and malts at the drive-in hangout, cruising the main strip, drag-racing, bragging about your one \"cool\" friend, making out, hanging out, dancing real close, listening to\n\n25\n\nrock music on the car radio, playing pranks on police, telling off an obnoxious teacher-. fittingly, we don't see our young heroes and heroines having dinner at home with their parents, doing their homework, or attending classes. At the beginning and conclusion, we see our four male heroes together; iil between, they go their separate ways. Ron Howard is ready to go far away to college, but girlfriend Cindy Williams is still in high school. When he suggests that they date other people while they're apart, she becomes infuriated. They spend the rest of the night arguing, realizing how much they']] miss each other when he leaves, and rcevaluating their future. Richard Dreyfuss is reluctant about leaving home and going off to college. He spends his last night with three toughs (evolving from potential victim to one of the gang) and trying to find a beautiful young woman (Suzanne Somers) who passed him in a car. Nerdy Charles Martin Smith, who has the use of Howard's car, mirdculously picks up batty blonde Candy Clark and has the wildest night imaginable-he actually impresses this girl who has been around. Paul Le Mat, local 22-year-old dragster champ, picks up a girl (Mackenzie Phillips) too, only to discover when she c1imbs into his car that she's about 12 or 13. But it turns out that she's a great companion. Lucas moves smoothly between the four storylines, which at times intenningle. The pace is swift, the dialogue is consistently witty and clever, and the characters are terrific. When this film was released, it made us feel nostalgic for a bygone era, but now when we see it we miss the young characters and we feel sad that the actors, whom we didn't know very well back in 1973, arc long past the time they can play high school students-today, this film really makes one feel aged. Film features the first great golden-oldie soundtrack-my favorite scene, the most touching in the movie, has Williams and Howard slow dancing to the Platters' \"Smoke Gets in Your Eyes.\" 1979's ambitious but flawed More American Graffiti took characters into the protest years. Produced by Francis Ford Coppola and Gary Kurtz; with a screenplay by Lucas and Gloria Katz and Willard Huyck. Verna Fields and Marcia Lucas edited. The remarkable cast, comprised mostly of then-unknowns, also includes: Harrison Ford, Debralee Scott, Joe Spano, Wolfman Jack (as himself), Kathy (Kathleen) Quinlan, Bo Hopkins, Manuel Padilla, Jr.\n\nlook at aspiring acts whom agents march through his office, amiably chatting with teenagers on the street, stopping to listen to unknown doo-wop groups (including Dion and the Bclmonts) who always cross his path between his car and a building, watching a rousing recording session (of \"Come Go with Mc\"), Mclntire's Freed is totally believable. He looks as if he walks through this cluttered, special world every day. While the film hints at Freed's imminent downfall (because of a payola scandal), Mutrux prefers to end it on a high note: despite pressure from bluenoses and government officials out to get Freed, he hosts his last triumphant music extravaganza at Brooklyn's Fox Paramount. \"You can close the show,\" he warns the police who have gathered to do just that, Hyou can stop me, but you'll never stop rock 'n' roll. n Also with: Laraine Newman (1ikable as a striving songwriter), Fran Drescher (the whining publicist in This ls Spinal Tap), Jay Leno, John Lehne, Jeff Altman, and, as themselves, Chuck Berry (doing a reaUy dirty version of \"Rcclin' and Rockin\"'), Jerry Lee Lewis, Screamin' Jay Hawkins.\n\nAMERICAN IN PARIS, AN (1951) C/113m. Lavish M-G-M musical, directed by Vincente Minnelli. A struggling American artist Jiving in Paris~ Gene Kelly. and young French shopgirl Leslie Caron fa)I in love. But he feels indebted to his patron, Nina Foch, and she feels obligated to marry Kelly's French friend Georges Guetary, who has taken care of her since she was orphaned during WWTT. Potentially interesting storyline, featuring what should be intriguing relationships, is given short shrift by Alan Jay Lerner. As this was 12 years before Breakfast at Tiffcmy's dared to have struggling writer George Peppard be Patricia Neal's \"kept man,\" it is made crystal clear that Kelly and Foch aren't _lovers;- likewise, it's clear Caron is a virgin, having never been taken advantage of by Guctary. So, instead of a steamy, complicated Jove affair between Kelly and Caron, it is all too proper-their romance is moviemusical predictable. Caron 's character, who no doubt had an interesting past, is very artificia1; it's nice to see her dance, but in her starring debut-whcn they hadn't figured out her makeup, I suppose-she doesn't yet look like a romantic lead. Smiling KeUy is likable once his character cuts out his obnoxious brash act when courting Caron, but for the most part Minnelli's elegant balletic style of dancing is too tame for him. Yet he does let loose in the extravagant 20-minute musical finale. Featuring several striking ballet interludes-all part of one ballet story set to Gershwin's \"An American in Paris\"-and the imaginative use of color, costumes, and sets to create scenes in the styles of French artists, it is one of the best production numbers in cinema history; but the other, shorter song-and-dance numbers shouldn't suffer so badly in comparison. Standard Gershwin score includes \"'S Wonderful,\" ..I Got Rhythm,\" and ·~rn Build a Stairway to Paradise\"; Saul Chaplin and Johnny Green won an Oscar for their musical arrangements. Co1orfu1 re-creation of Paris street scenes on M-G-M backlot.\n\nAMERICAN HOT WAX (1978) C/91 m.\n\nFloyd Mutrux 's affectionate facts-out-the-window tribute to the late Alan Freed, regarded as the first white deejay to play black music, has as flimsy a storyline as those fifties \"B\" rock 'n, roll movies in which Freed appeared. Nevertheless it has great drive and sustained momentum, a chaotic atmosphere that properly reflects the wild era it depicts, and familiar music from 1957-60 (both performed by acts in the film and played on the soundtrack) that will make you feel joyfu1Jy nostalgic. Best of all, it has Tim Mcintire giving a dynamite performance as the former uMr. Rock 'n' Roll.\" Respectfully spinning platters on his radio show (we see that Freed really loved rock music), taking a quick\n\n26\n\nNot worthy of its Best Picture Oscar, but a major entry to the musical genre. Produced by Arthur Freed. Also with: Oscar Levant (in need of a talk show).\n\nby fact that nothing really terrible happened to Lutzes during their tenure. Main selling point is that Rod Steiger as a priest gives what may be the worst performance in horrormovie history. He's incredibly awful. Bad direction of actors by Stuart Rosenberg. Sequels: The abominable Amityville ll-The Possession, showing what supposedly took place before the Lutzes moved in; Amityville-The Demon, conventional haunted-house fiction made in 3-D, is the best of the lot, although it falls apart long before the end. Also with: Don Stroud, Murray Hamilton, Natasha Ryan, Michael Sachs, Harry Wright, Helen Shaver.\n\nAMERICAN WEREWOLF IN LONDON, AN (1981 ) C/97 m. While backpacking at night on the British moors, young Americans David Naughton and Griffin Dunne are attacked (in a terrifying scene) by a werewolf. Naughton survives, but is repeatedly visited by Dunne's deteriorating corpse-ghost, who tells him to commit suicide so he won't turn into a werewolf at the next full moon. Believing Dunne to be a hallucination, Naughton moves in with his new lover, lovely nurse Jenny Agutter. (He even jokes about the old Lon Chaney, Jr., film, The Wolf Man.) Sure enough, Naughton turns into a werewolf each night of the next full moon, roams through London, and commits extremely brutal murders. A pet project of director-writer John Landis, this may be the most successful attempt to mix horror and comedy there has been. You '11 laugh even when you feel jittery. There are hilarious scenes (i.e., the nude Naughton trying to get home from the zoo) and many that are extremely frightening. The young actors are appealing and energetic (Naughton was picked because of his amiable presence in a series of Dr Pepper commercials), and the supporting players-many from the Royal Shakespeare Company-give the production class. Shot on location, the settings arc particularly well chosen for atmosphere and visual interest. The music-\"Blue Moon\"' is done by a number of people-is a lot of fun; Rick Baker won a deserved Oscar for his corpse-ghost and werewolf makeup and his stunning work on Naughton,s transformation from man into beast. The last couple of scenes, taking place in Piccadilly Circus, seem ill advised (all Naughton\"s victims urge him to commit suicide, which he doesn't do anyway; the werewolf on the loose causes a number of unnecessarily violent car crashes); but otherwise the picture is truly enjoyable and original. I find it immeasurably better than The Howling, Joe Dante's campy werewolf film that came out at about the same time. Also with: John Woodvine, Brian Glover.\n\nAMONG THE LIVING (1941) B&W/68m. Impressive \"B\" rnovie stars Albert Dekker as a businessman in a small Southern town and as his homicidal twin brother who escapes from a mental hospital. The crazy brother still remembers his father abusing his mother when he was a child; when he strangles victims, he places their hands over their ears so they won't hear their own screams. Susan Hayward's the cheap, sexy golddigger who talces financial advantage of her mother's new boarder when a large reward is offered for the unknown killer. She gets Dekker to go with her to look for the wanted man-she doesn't realize that he's the murderer. Psychological thriller has good acting and direction (by Stuart Heisler), suspense, and miU-town atmosphere. Frances Fanner plays the sane brother\"s wife. Also with: Harry Carey, Gordon Jones, Jean Phillips, Maude Eburne, Clarence Muse, Rod Cameron.\n\nANCHORS AWEIGH (1945) C/140m.\n\nGene Kelly and'1rank Sinatra teamed up for the first time as hero sailors on shore leave in Hollywood. Kelly became a big star as the wolf of the navy, but Sinatra is better as his best friend, a bashful manchild from Brooklyn. Sinatra falls for sweet Kathryn Grayson, and though Kelly loves her too, he steps aside so Sinatra can have free sailing. Sinatra tries to impress her by promising her a singing audition with Jose lturbi, although the boys don't really know him. Flimsy plotline is not helped by timid romantic leads Kelly and Grayson. And who cares about a story centered on orchestra conductor lturbi? But Sinatra's singing (of okay songs by Jule Styne and Sammy Cahn) is silky smooth and Kelly's athletic dances are dazzling-especially his celebrated duo with MGM cartoon star Jerry the mouse. MGM Technicolor is gorgeous. Terrible finale in which we expect musical extravaganza in front of thousands of sailors but instead get Grayson hugging Kelly. Directed by George Sidney. Also with: Dean Stockwell, Pamela Britton, '~Rags\" Ragland, Billy Gilbert, Henry O'Neill, Edgar Kennedy, Grady Sutton, Leon Ames.\n\nAMITYVILLE HORROR, THE (1979) C/117m. Adaptation of Jay Anson's \"fact\"-based book isn't nearly as \"convincing'' or as much fun. The Lutz family moves to Amityville, N. Y. , into a large house that was the scene of a mass murder (a boy wiped out his family). People think it's haunted and may have a doorway to hell in its basement. Not long after the Lutzes move in, strange occurrences take place; the young daughter starts communicating with a \"pig\" figure-which parents Margot Kidder and James Brolin assume is imaginary-a stuck window suddenly falls down on young son's hand (big deal!), all religious visitors act panicky and flee the premises, and Brolin begins to act possessed. Hints are he will become violent, like the son of the last tenants. The two leads try hard, but material becomes increasingly stupid-filmmakers were hampered\n\n... AND GOD CREATED WOMAN/AND WOMAN ... WAS CREATED {FRENCH/1957) C/ 90m-91 m-93m-95m. Brigitte Bardot became an international sex symbol as the result of her role in husband Roger Vadim 's debut film. She spends the entire film wrapped 27\n\nand parodies. With: Louis Hayward, Barry Fitzgerald, Walter Huston, Roland Young., June Duprez, Mischa Auer, Judith Anderson, C. Aubrey Smith, Richard Haydn, Queenie Leonard, Harry Thurston.\n\nin towels or in tight, sexy outfits, or nude (Vadim shows a lot of skin, but the nudity is fleeting and in some prints nonexistent). She is a forerunner of many young females in future French films in that she lives for herself, is sexually promiscuous, is guiltless about her disloyalty toward men, has an eager body that sends stronger messages to her brain than her conscience. Bardot marries fisherman Jean-Louis Trintignant. She loves him, but seduces his brother Christian Marquand on the beach. And she still feels an attachment to wealthy middle-aged Curt Jurgens. You'll forget the men and remember Bardot: sunbathing, standing nude behind a sheet on the outdoor clothesline while speaking to Jurgens (who looks over the top of the sheet to see her); Bardot in bed with Trintignant; Bardot on the beach with Marquand; Bardot doing a sizzling dance in front of many men. Picture tends to be dismissed as simply the film that made Bardot famous, but it could very easily be called the first picture of the French New Wave. Filmed on location in St. Tropez. Bardot and Trintignant had a well-publicized affair. Also with: Georges Poujouly, Jeanne Marken,. Isabelle Corey.\n\nANDROID (1982) C/80m.\n\nIn 2036, Dr. Daniel (Klaus Kinski) runs an abandoned space station. His only companion is Max 404 (co-writer Dan Opper), an android he created. The childlike Max spends his free time studying pop culture on earth in the 20th century. He doesn't suspect that Daniel plans on destroying and replacing him with a perfect female android (Kendra Kirchner). But Daniel's plans are put on hold when Max allows three space travelers (Brie Howard, Norbert Weisser, Crofton Hardester), who he doesn't know are escaped convicts, to land on the station. Put all these weird characters together and there ~s bound to be mayhem. Director Aaron Lipstadt's low-budget debut film became a quick cult favorite in England, but while it got friendly reviews in America, it never really caught on. It has cb.ann, a Chaplinesque lead character, and behind-thecamera intelligence going for it, but this is one film that really should have been zanier.\n\nAND SOON THE DARKNESS (BRITISH/1970) Cl 98m.\n\nIf Dennis Hopper and Peter Fonda convinced hippies not to cycle through America's South, then British nurses Pamela Franklin and Michele Dotrice should convince young women not to bicycle through the French countryside-particularly if a sex maniac is on 1he loose. Certainly this thriller is no gem, but it has some suspense and titillation, and, as always, FrankJin is a sympathetic heroinein-jeopardy. When her companion disappears, Franklin must do a little snooping on her own. Most often this film plays on the Late Late Show, with the strongest sex and violence excised-even so, it'll grab your attention. Directed by Robert Fuest. Also with: Sandor Eles, John Nettleton, Clare Kelly.\n\nANDROMEDA STRAIN, THE (1971) C/1 JOm. Robert Wise directed this deliberately paced adaptation of Michael Crichton's best-seller. A U.S. spaceship brings back deadly unknown bacteria from outer space, which quickly wipes out an entire town but for a baby and an alcoholic. Government calls in team of brainy scientists (Arthur Hill, James Olson, Kate Reid, David Wayne) to secret facility. They attempt to figure out nature of bacteria and the way to neutralize it before it is transported by winds and destroys mankind. Like Crichton, Wise emphasizes the scientific process that occurs when a problem must be solved. Crichton 's theme: no process is foolproof. So, while the scientists make discoveries, there are also major mistakes made by man and machine. In fact, a nuclear detonation almost occurs. The most intriguing aspect of book and film is that with all the scientific dialogue and experimentation taking place, and the exciting finale in which Olsen desperately races to stop the bomb from exploding, we almost overlook the fact that the scientists need not have been brought together in the first place; in regard to the bacteria, the same result would have happened without their presence, and their presence almost caused world destruction. Crichton's point is that it was thoughtless to have brought back such bacteria from space in the first place (possibly to be used militarily); once that happened, every attempt to correct the initial mistake caused new errors and cascading ramifications. This is a story about helplel·sness. Also with: Paula Kelly.\n\nAND THEN THERE WERE NONE (1945) B&W/ 9 8m. A highly entertaining adaptation of Agatha Christie's Ten Little Indians (called Ten Little Niggers in England, as was the film), with an unbeatable cast. Ten people are summoned to a mansion on an isolated island by an unknown person. Supposedly, each was responsible for someone's death, but didn't have to pay the penalty. Now, as the voice on a phonograph record tells them, they are to be punished. One by one, these guests are knocked off,. in ways suggested by the nursery rhyme. As there is no one else on the island, it is apparent that one of the I O is the killer. Film benefits from a witty script by Dudley Nichols and light-touch direction by Rene Clair, who effectively keeps the multimurder story from becoming bleak (he makes good use of lively music). It's fun trying (and most likely failing) to figure out the murderer's identity, but this mystery is just as interesting the second time around when you can watch the killer closely and see how cleverly we are being manipulated by Christie and the filmmakers. Remade as Ten Little Indians in 1965 and 1975 (an English version); classic also has served as the model for numerous movie mysteries\n\nANDY WARHOL'S BAD/BAD (1971) C/1 OOm. Perhaps the most ridiculous film ever distributed by a Hollywood company (Roger Corman's New World Pictures), this satirical look at a completely rotten society is also the only Andy Warhol film to at least \"look\" like a mainstream\n\n28\n\nbest of all is Amo Juerging, who plays Dracula's always angry assistant. He speaks in the most unpleasant tone imaginable and his argument-conversations with the overly excited Kier are classics. His bar-game scene with peasant Roman Polanski is also a highlight.\n\nfilm. Young director Jed Johnson wisely kept his characters under tight control, making sure they delivered their preposterous dialogue (\"I want you to kill a dog and I want you to kill it viciously'') in a very off-key manner; as a result, this absurd black comedy beats the odds and works beautifully. Carroll Baker returned to America after a selfimposed exile to work for Warhol and proved her real calling wasn't as a sex symbol but as a comedienne. She plays a middle-aged Queens housewife who shares her house with a useless husband, a mother who smokes despite her lung cancer, and a dumpy daughter-in-law (Susan Tyrell) and her messy, always wailing baby. She is the family's breadwinner and like many American housewives, devotes her life to making ends meet. Besides several money-making scams and inordinate penny-pinching, she makes a living by running ( 1) a facial-hair-removal business and (2) a fourwoman assassination-for-hire organization that specializes in doing away with kids and animals. Perry King plays a mysterious young assassin she takes into her house for a one-time assignment. Their viciously unfriendly banter serves to punctuate the dastardly acts committed by Baker's women. Oddly, the main thrust of the humor has less to do with the overly outrageous violent acts than with characters' simply being mean to one another or pulling cruel jokes to intimidate those people they don't like: one woman clogs a drugstore's toilet to make it overflow; another stuffs a thumb into Baker's ketchup bottle and attacks Tyrell with an aerosol spray; another woman physically attacks a man because he wears the same blue pants every day and still has the nerve to comment that she looks ugly in shorts. Interestingly, nothing is taken seriously except a poignant scene between King and an autistic boy-unlike John Waters, Warhol doesn't treat truly sensitive subjects irresponsibly. Film deserves more of a cult than it has. Also with: Stefania Cassini, Cyrinde Fox, Mary Boylan, Charles McGregor, Tere Tereba, Brigid Polk, Susan Blond.\n\nANDY WARHOL'S FRANKENSTEIN/FLESH FOR FRANKENSTEIN (ITALIAN-FRENCHGERMAN/1974) C/94m. Perpetually aggravated, bad-tempered Frankenstein (Udo Kier) creates a handsome male (Srdjan Zelenovic) and beautiful female (Dalia di Lazzaro) from the remains of dead bodies. While he works and talks science non-stop with his stupid, sex-crazed assistant (Amo Juerging), his wife (Monique Van Vooren) seduces the stud field worker (Joe Dallesandro) and his young son and daughter creep around the castle planning evil of their own. Kier-and-Juerging team is fun to watch, though they're not as polished as in Andy Warhol' s Dracula, when both virtually scream every line. Also \"sex\" scene between Dallesandro and Van Vooren is hilarious, particularly when she slurps away at his annpit. But the explicit violence in film overwhelms the subtle humor and sex. The repetitive images and dialogue make film tiresome. Originally in 3-D. Directed by Paul Morrissey.\n\nANGEL (1984) C/92m.\n\nNew World's titillating newspaper ad-showing a teenager who looks 14 (actually\n\nbaby-faced star Donna Wilkes is over 18) standing in high heels and wearing a miniskirt, with copy that promised ''High School Honor Student By Day, Hollywood Hooker By Night\"-paid great dividends. This low-budget exploitation film made the studio many times its investment. Wilkes isn't bad as the smart young streetwalker who, deserted by her parents, has found the only way to pay for her expensive private-school education. The actress is ably supported by Dick Shawn, as Angel's transvestite friend and protector, Susan Tyrell, as her crotchety (but sentimental) but.eh landlady, and Rory Calhoun, as an ex-western stuntman who makes a living as a quick-draw artist on Hollywood Boulevard. Cliff Gorman is the police detective who tries to get Angel off the streets, which has become especially important now that a psycho is doing away with Hollywood hookers. Not as bad as one would expect. Probably afraid of pushing ukiddie porn,,, the filmmakers don't exploit the sexual nature of Wilkes's role-she keeps her clothes on. The offbeat characters, a couple of action sequences, and a wild finale in which Wilkes chases the killer (who wears Hare Krishna garb) down crowded streets while carrying a loaded pistol provide some entertainment. Director Robert Vincent O'Neil also made the sequel, .4.venging Angel.\n\nANDY WARHOL'S DRACULA/BLOOD FOR DRACULA (ITALIAN-FRENCH/1974) C/90m106m. Not as popular as Andy Warhol's Frankenstein, also directed by Paul Morrissey, but a much better film. It's the l 930s and the skinny, sickly, extremely weak Count (Udo Kier) needs virgin blood to survive. So he travels to Italy (where else?). He becomes guest in the dilapidated castle of an aged nobleman (Vittorio De Sica), whose mind and finances have seen better days. De Sica and his wife (Maxime McKendry) hope that the stranger is rich and will give them much-needed money. They don't realize that Dracula is lusting after the blood of their daughters (Milena Vukotic, Dominuqe Darel, Stefania Casini, Silvia Dionisic). But each time Dracula seduces one of the girls, he starts vomiting blood. Too late the ill Dracula discovers that they gave up their virginity to the Bolshevik gardener (Joe Dallesandro doesn't bother to hide his New York accent). Film is erotic, cleverly scripted by Morrissey and very funny, but it's so super bloody, gross, and violent that viewers will surely be scared away. The entire cast is impressive, but\n\nANGEL AND THE BADMAN (1947) B&W/\n\n1OOm.\n\nGunslinger John Wayne is shot, recuperates in home of Quaker family, falls in love with the daughter, Gail Russell. Although some outlaws are out to get him and a lawman (Harry Carey) patiently waits for him to break the law so he can hang him, Wayne is so reformed by Russell\n\n29\n\nthat he resists temptation to use a gun. Most enjoyable. It's interesting that Wayne, who produced, would choose to make a pacifist western with this theme: \"Only a man who carries a gun ever needs one. n Romance between beautiful as well, is truly delightful and believable. They are a sweet couple. There are some wonderful moments when Wayne looks at Russell adoringly, and when Russell feels emotions building inside her as she looks at him. Such scenes are never found in westerns. Skillfully written and directed by James Edward Grant, high-class uB\" western in many ways anticipated Peter Weir's Witness. Also with: Irene Rich,\n\nall it's a disappointing film, where the innocuous art-theft plot gets in the way of the comedy, and where the proceedings come to a dead halt when Chico plays the piano, romantic leads Hal Thompson and Lill"
