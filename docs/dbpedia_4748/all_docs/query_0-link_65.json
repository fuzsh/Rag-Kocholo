The Subcommittee met, pursuant to notice, at 10:05 a.m. in room SR-253, Russell Senate Office Building, Hon. Byron L. Dorgan, Chairman of the Subcommittee, presiding. OPENING STATEMENT OF HON. BYRON L. DORGAN, U.S. SENATOR FROM NORTH DAKOTA Senator Dorgan. We'll call the hearing to order. This is a hearing of the subcommittee of the Senate Commerce Committee, the Subcommittee on Aviation. I want to thank all of you for joining us today to talk about the importance of the issue of aviation safety. This is the second hearing that we have held this month to discuss the subject of aviation safety, with a particular focus on the safety of regional carriers. In this hearing, we will receive testimony from representatives of the Nation's network carriers and regional carriers from the Air Transport Association and from the Regional Airline Association, respectively. We'll also hear from the Air Line Pilots Association and from Mr. Scott Maurer, representing the Families of Continental Flight 3407, which crashed on February 12 of this year in New York. I do want to say, as well, as we start this hearing, that I had intended and wished to have representatives of the carriers themselves at a hearing. And so, we did not accomplish that today. I'm not minimizing at all the representatives of the two--the ATA and the RAA, but I will wish to extend invitations and have representatives of the airlines themselves in here within the next month or so. It is important, I think, that they would accept an invitation to come, and so, I will extend those invitations again. In this country, I think it is safe to say that we have a remarkably safe system of air travel. It's not my intention, with hearings about aviation safety, to alarm anyone about taking a flight on a regional carrier or a network carrier. We operate aircrafts all across this country every day, and provide critical air service to many people who would not otherwise have that kind of transportation service or that kind of option. But, we do have a responsibility, it seems to me, to ask questions and to get answers to the questions of, Do we have one level of safety, do we have one standard of safety that now exists, or have we drifted some? If the traveling public ever has doubts about the consistency of safety in our airspace system or with airline travel, the airline industry inevitably will suffer. So, we have to move together to make certain that people have no reason to question the oversight or the application of aviation safety across the country. I've said before that I've read extensively about the most recent crash that occurred in our country, the crash by Colgan Air in Buffalo, New York. Frankly, a number of things happened on that flight that caused me great, great concern. There were a number of mistakes that occurred, a number of things that, to me, were revelations that were quite stunning and led me to question, Is this--was it an aberration, was it something that happened only in the cockpit of this one plane, or is there something else at work? Is there a set of standards that is applied one way in one set of carriers and another way in another set of carriers? I don't know the answer to that, but I think it is important that we ask those questions. The plane that crashed in New York was a Bombardier Dash 8 Q400 operated by a captain and a copilot who had commuted--both commuted long distances to get to work, and were found to have had reasonably little rest before the flight. The copilot raised issues, in the transcript that I read of the conversation in the cockpit, of her inexperience with icing conditions. They, clearly that evening, were flying in significant icing. The captain had failed a number of flight tests during his career, which the carrier themselves were unaware of and did not have information about. We're going to hear from those that are investigating this. The NTSB, I know, is doing substantial investigations. But, the larger question for me, here, is, What about the airlines and the FAA's ability to prevent a double standard or two different standards of experience in the cockpit? What about the enforcement of rules with respect to familiarity with certain kinds of conditions, familiarity with equipment? We are supposed to have, dating back to the mid-1990s, ``one level of safety,'' for both regional and major carriers. And I want to hear, from our witnesses today, whether you think that is actually the case, whether the system has kept up with changes, or whether there have been changes that have occurred that have drifted us away from one standard? I'm particularly concerned, from some of the things I've learned in the last hearing--for example, that a carrier does not easily have full access to the records of pilots they are considering hiring. I'm talking about all of the records. They have access to the records of everything that has occurred with respect to an airplane. An airplane that comes off the line and is put in service, everything that happens to that particular airplane is a matter of record that anyone can access. And that is not the case with respect to the record of the pilot or the people in the cockpit. I think that there is some reason to be encouraged by what the new administrator, Randy Babbitt, has done. He called for a meeting, Monday of this week, which reflects a concern that he wants to understand these things quickly and take whatever action is necessary. It is also the case that he indicated that, after--2 years after the NTSB suggested a rulemaking on access to records for pilots, that Mr. Babbitt indicated to me that the next time he came to a hearing and I asked the question, ``Have you begun a rulemaking?'' he indicated that he expected the answer to be affirmative rather than negative. So, I think we're making some progress, here. But, this is very, very important, and it's something that we have to ask questions about. They are tough questions, but necessary and important questions. I want to thank the witnesses for being with us. Senator DeMint is the Ranking Member of our Subcommittee, and I know Senator DeMint wishes to make a comment and then, I think, also introduce Mr. Maurer, more formally, who is a member of your state. STATEMENT OF HON. JIM DeMINT, U.S. SENATOR FROM SOUTH CAROLINA Senator DeMint. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. And I thank you again for conducting these hearings. And I would just add my comments to yours. I agree with everything you said about the concerns about this flight. A lot of us get on regional flights ourselves, every week, going back and forth to our home states, and we assume a lot when we get on a plane. And I know all Americans do. And we do need to make sure there is a standard of safety for every American. I'm looking forward to working with the Chairman on language that would reveal all the pilot records, just as we have them for an airplane. And some things seem to make common sense right now. But, I do have the pleasure of introducing Mr. Scott Maurer this morning. Mr. Maurer is the father of a 30-year-old woman who was on Flight 3407 crash, Lorin Maurer. Mr. Maurer was born and raised in Reading, Pennsylvania, where he and his wife raised their daughter, Lorin. He currently lives in South Carolina. I appreciate him taking the time to come to Washington. I think this is his third trip here, and I know this is very difficult for him to continue to recount this tragedy in public, as well as private. Mr. Maurer comes before this Committee this morning as a representative of over 150 people and the families of the Flight 3407 group. They've come together as a result of the terrible tragedy, with the goal of making changes in the airline industry and the FAA, hoping to keep an accident like 3407 from happening again, and saving many other families the sadness that they are continuing to endure. Mr. Maurer is also joined this morning by his wife, Terry, and Lorin's boyfriend, Kevin Kuwik. I am deeply impressed with the work of the Maurers and Mr. Kuwik and all the families of the victims of Flight 3407. As a father of four and a grandfather of two, I can't begin to imagine the pain that comes from so tragically losing a loved one. It speaks very highly of all the families here today that you're working to take what must be such a deep sorrow and focusing it on improving airline safety and helping other Americans. I'm looking forward to hearing your testimony, Mr. Maurer, and the recommendations, this morning. And both the Chairman and I--and I know I speak for everyone on the Committee--thank you for the sacrifice that you're making to try to improve the system for others. Senator Dorgan. Senator DeMint, thank you very much. I would--let me ask others if they would limit opening comments to 2 minutes, and then we'll have 7-minute rounds for questions when we've heard from the witnesses. Senator Lautenberg? STATEMENT OF HON. FRANK R. LAUTENBERG, U.S. SENATOR FROM NEW JERSEY Senator Lautenberg. Yes, Mr. Chairman, very quickly, thank you for calling this hearing, because, though our flight safety record is so outstanding, when we look at the total of aviation and its services, the situation with the Colgan flight is one that is--shook our bodies, our minds. The plane took off from Newark-Liberty International in February. It cost the lives of 50 people. Flight 3407 taught us that we need to improve pilot training, address flight-crew hours of service, and implement consistent safety standards for both regional and large air carriers. And just last year, we saw disturbing reports about safety inspection failures, where the FAA let planes filled with passengers take off with cracked hulls. And these failures forced the cancellation of thousands of flights by airlines who may not have taken safety as seriously as they should have. And so, we're anxious to learn whatever we can about the failure of good precautions, with Flight 3407, and we extend our sympathies, also, to Mr. Maurer, and that we would like to be able to make the promise, when we're finished with these hearings, Mr. Chairman, that we will have done whatever we can to make this excellent safety record that exists with American aviation even better. And we look with interest at what our witnesses---- Senator Dorgan. Senator Lautenberg---- Senator Lautenberg.--have to say. Senator Dorgan.--thank you very much. Senator Lautenberg. Thank you. Senator Dorgan. Senator Johanns? STATEMENT OF HON. MIKE JOHANNS, U.S. SENATOR FROM NEBRASKA Senator Johanns. Mr. Chairman, thank you. My comments will be very, very brief. But, let me tell you what I'm thinking about and hoping to accomplish through this process. I think the burden is on the airlines to prove to the American people that, when we get on, for the price of our ticket, whatever that is, that we're going to have a well-experienced crew, who will treat us politely and decently, an airplane that is safe as can possibly be. And I think, really, the burden is there. When I think about this flight in--and I feel so badly for these families, but this hearing is bigger than that one flight--I think about questions like, Is the plane safe? What's the inspection background of this airplane? What would the service records show me if I were to take a look at them? I ask myself, Has the crew got the training, the talent, the background, the discipline, have they gotten a good night's sleep, so they can handle all situations? I had a pilot at--a dear friend of mine; he flew small planes--who said to me, ``You know, flying is hours and hours of boredom followed by moments of sheer terror.'' And, you know, that always stuck with me. I ask myself, Does the crew know when they are entering a situation that is beyond their capability, or their airplane's capability? Are they trained well enough, and do they have the talent and experience and background, to see this situation and say, ``I'm not going to expose my passengers to that risk. I don't care what somebody above me is trying to say?'' And those are the things that I hope to accomplish in this hearing. So, my hope is, we can focus on some of those questions, and others. And I'll wrap up by just saying, Mr. Chairman, thanks for calling this--such an important topic. And--just glad to be here today. Thanks. Senator Dorgan. Thank you very much. Senator Begich? STATEMENT OF HON. MARK BEGICH, U.S. SENATOR FROM ALASKA Senator Begich. Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman. I will be very, very brief. I'll look forward to the questions and answers. But, I'll be looking at this from two perspectives. One is United States Senator, but also someone who lost a family member, my father, in a plane crash. So, I look at it from two different perspectives. And I will be anxious to ask several questions. And I don't want you to take them, any of them, personally. I think this is an important issue, as just described by several Senators here, of--in regards to safety for our air flights, because people do walk onto the planes assuming they are safe transportation modes, and it's going to be important that we make sure they continue to improve on the record you have today. But, again, I'm going to be coming from two perspectives, and I hope you recognize that. Thank you very much. Senator Dorgan. Senator Thune? STATEMENT OF HON. JOHN THUNE, U.S. SENATOR FROM SOUTH DAKOTA Senator Thune. Mr. Chairman, I, too, want to thank you for calling the hearing. And I want to thank our panelists for being here, especially you, Mr. Maurer. Again, our condolences to you and your family and all the families. A very tragic, tragic incident, and I applaud you for committing yourself to making sure this doesn't happen to any other families. Thank you for your efforts and for the courageous work that you're doing. Coming from a state like mine, we have a heavy reliance on regional airlines. They play an important role in transporting passengers from smaller communities who otherwise would not have scheduled air service. And, while I don't, you know, think, again, that we can--no one's arguing that we shouldn't take our overall aviation safety record for granted, I also believe there's room for improvement. And we want to ensure that the FAA and the airlines are doing everything they can to improve the overall safety record, when it comes, not only to regional airlines, but to all airlines. And I particularly want to home in on something that we discussed at the Subcommittee hearing last week, Mr. Chairman, and that is the need to incorporate more information regarding the background of pilots. I think it just makes sense that we work to ensure that the FAA incorporates a more accurate picture of a perspective--prospective pilot's flight history when an airline is looking to make a hiring decision. And voluntarily requesting this information just isn't good enough. I think there is more that Congress can require, when it comes to updating the Pilot Records Improvement Act, and I hope that we can work on that in this Committee to make some of those changes, because, I think, clearly that came into play in this very tragic incident. But, again, thank you for holding the hearing, and I want to thank our panelists, and I'll look forward to hearing from you. Thanks. Senator Dorgan. Senator Thune, thank you very much. As several of my colleagues have mentioned, we look at these issues through the lens of tragedy, regrettably. But, in many cases, I--and I expect Mr. Maurer is here in the hope that what we learn will save other lives and improve airline safety. And I--all of us would, I think, embrace that goal. So, with that in mind, we have four witnesses, and I want to call on Mr. Jim May first today. Mr. Jim May is President and Chief Executive Officer of the Air Transport Association of America. Mr. May, you and I have discussed all of the issues that have been discussed this morning. I--the same is the case with Mr. Cohen; we've had these discussions. Let me call on you--let me say, to all four of you, that your entire statements will be made a part of the permanent record, and we would ask that you summarize your remarks. STATEMENT OF JAMES C. MAY, PRESIDENT AND CEO, AIR TRANSPORT ASSOCIATION OF AMERICA, INC. Mr. May. Thank you, Mr.---- Senator Dorgan. And would you pull that very close and turn that on. Thank you. Mr. May. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and good morning. Let me also share my condolences with Mr. Maurer and the other representatives of the families that lost loved ones aboard the Colgan Air flight. It is a terrible, terrible tragedy. In the airline industry, safety is our highest priority. We try very hard to assure that we never compromise safety because of economic conditions. We work closely with all members of the aviation community, including regional airlines, to achieve extraordinary records--no fatalities for mainline carriers in the past number of years. And it really is in that spirit that I appear before you today, with an understanding that no accident is acceptable. We have a responsibility to understand, through rigorous and searching inquiry, the causes of the Buffalo accident, and then to take whatever single or multiple corrective measures are needed. In light of that responsibility, we're very fortunate that there are three expert government forums in which scrutiny is happening today, right now. This is as it should be. The public needs to be confident in the responses to aviation safety issues. The National Transportation Safety Board's ongoing investigation is going to produce a far more complete picture than we have today. In this, as in previous accidents, the Board is the authoritative source for making that determination and recommending corrective action. In addition, the Department of Transportation's Inspector General recently began an assessment of the Federal Aviation Administration's oversight of certification, pilot qualification, training, and other issues. That is in response, Mr. Chairman, to your very direct inquiry. When this review was announced, we immediately offered our resources and full cooperation to the inspector general. His evaluation and constructive suggestions that we know will result from it will augment the NTSB's effort. Finally, the FAA's Call to Action, held on Monday of this week, is a broad-based initiative to look at safety issues, including those raised at this morning's hearing. We attended-- multiple representatives of ATA attended Monday's meeting and were impressed by the participants' focus on concrete issues and their understanding of the need for very prompt solutions. We look forward to being engaged with the FAA and other interested stakeholders in this vital work. Now, I don't believe that any topic should be off the table in the Call to Action. We need to have a full and frank discussion about safety and the factors that contribute to it. If there are disparities between mainline and regional safety programs they should be closed, and closed quickly. Let me suggest six or seven steps that need to be pursued right now, today. First, I think we need to apply FOQA, Flight Operational Quality Assurance programs used by major carriers, to regional airlines. FOQA works. The collection and analysis of data recorded during flight improves safety. Second, apply ASAP, Aviation Safety Action Programs, which encourage voluntary reporting of safety issues and events that come to the attention of employees, to those regional airlines that don't currently have such a program. Third, identify advanced-training best practices of mainline carriers to be used by regional carriers. It's an AQP program, in the jargon. Fourth, we need a centralized database of pilot records, to give airlines easy access to complete information about applicants from the time they begin their flying career. Fifth, let's see if the FAA needs to increase compliance with the ``sterile cockpit'' rule, and what measures it should use to do that. Sixth, let's examine flight-crew preparedness when pilots report to work. This means looking at crew-member commuting. If this means examining flight and duty-time issues, I think that's perfectly appropriate--but, tie it to the commuting side of the equation--as long as any examination is based on science, not anecdotes. Each of these initiatives can and should be achieved in short order. We're looking forward to working with this Committee, the FAA, the IG, and the NTSB in as cooperative a fashion as possible. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I'll be pleased to answer any questions. [The prepared statement of Mr. May follows:] Prepared Statement of James C. May, President and CEO, Air Transport Association of America, Inc. The crash of the Colgan Air aircraft near Buffalo on February 12, 2009, was a tragedy that has produced heartache for the relatives and friends of the victims of that accident. Words are faint consolation for their grief. Two basic considerations need to guide us in the aftermath of that tragedy. The first consideration is that in the aviation community, no accident is acceptable. We need to understand through rigorous and searching inquiry the cause of the Buffalo accident. Completion of the ongoing National Transportation Safety Board investigation will produce a far more complete picture than we have today of what so tragically unfolded that evening. Moreover, the Department of Transportation Inspector General recently began an examination of Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) oversight of certification, pilot qualification, training and other issues that will augment the NTSB effort. The ``call to action'' initiative that the Secretary of Transportation announced last week will enhance these two efforts. The call to action meeting that the FAA held this Monday enabled stakeholders to review pilot training, cockpit discipline and other issues associated with flight safety. We enthusiastically support this initiative. ATA and its members actively participated in last year's FAA runway safety ``call to action.'' We look to the same type of involvement with this latest ``call to action.'' The second consideration is that it is the certificate holder--the air carrier that has received the authority from the FAA to serve the public--that is ultimately responsible and accountable for the safety of its operations and for complying with the requirements that the FAA imposes on air carriers. It goes without saying but I will say it: We do not compromise safety for economic reasons. ATA members and their employees have achieved an extraordinary safety record because of their single-minded focus on safety. This has occurred, I would emphasize, during the most turbulent era in our industry's history. It is in the spirit of the pursuit of safety that I appear before you today. Understandably, much has been written about the Buffalo accident. Speculation, however, is not the foundation for a meaningful response to any aviation accident. We need to get it right. That is why we all rely on the NTSB in these situations. After its investigation is concluded, the Board will prepare and issue a detailed narrative report that analyzes the investigative record, identifies the probable cause of the accident and makes specific recommendations for fixing the causes of the accident. That kind of rigor is indispensable in developing a fact-based, informed and effective response to the accident. It is the kind of diligence that characterizes other safety-related efforts in our industry. We approach safety issues collaboratively with commitment and know-how within the bounds of the Federal Aviation Regulations (FARs). In the airline industry, safety is the highest priority. That is a shared commitment and we work closely with other members of the aviation community to achieve it. Together with the FAA, manufacturers, labor unions and other interested parties, we have achieved an extraordinary safety record. That impressive accomplishment, however, does not mean that we can rest on our laurels. We continuously pursue safety. Improving safety is work that is never done; we always seek to improve. Commercial aviation has built this record through a disciplined and analytical approach to improving safety performance. That scrutiny includes benefiting from experience and from a forward-looking search to identify emerging issues. The Commercial Aviation Safety Team (CAST), for example, brings together stakeholders to improve safety performance by applying data-driven analyses to spot issues before accidents occur and to establish safety priorities. Increasing reliance on two industry-led safety programs, the Aviation Safety Action Program (ASAP), which encourages voluntary reporting of safety issues and events that come to the attention of employees of certain certificate holders, and the Flight Operational Quality Assurance (FOQA) program, which involves the collection and analysis of data recorded during flight to improve safety, have also added immeasurably to our knowledge. This empirical approach, coupled with the expertise and commitment of our frontline employees, provides the underpinning for industrywide safety efforts. Participation in these programs underscores that ATA members' efforts go well beyond compliance with governmental regulatory directives. This willingness to exceed minimum requirements is often overlooked. It is tightly woven into the safety culture of airlines, whether they are mainline or regional. No accident or incident is acceptable. We seek to learn from each event. Consequently, ATA has formed a Senior Advisory Task Force to address the matters raised during the recent NTSB hearing about the Buffalo accident. The task force is comprised of airline presidents, chief operating officers and their peers. It will ensure that our support of the FAA, airlines, unions and others is responsive, targeted and thorough. ATA member airlines highly value their relationships with regional airlines and the customer benefits those arrangements provide. Customers, communities and the marketing and operating carriers benefit immensely. The bedrock principle in civil aviation is that the entity to which the FAA has issued a certificate is solely responsible for its activities. Whether that entity is an air carrier, an airman or a dispatcher, that responsibility cannot be delegated or assumed by others. That principle avoids any confusion about ultimate responsibility, an absolutely essential consideration in promoting safety. It is a principle that dates back to 1938, when Congress created the Civil Aviation Authority, the predecessor of the FAA. As separate regulated entities, regionals are independent of mainline airlines. As I noted previously, they hold operating authority that the FAA has granted them. The FAA certificates regionals under Federal Aviation Regulation Part 121. This means that the certificate holder--the regional airline--maintains the responsibility for, and direct control of, its operations and safety programs. The FAA has the mandate to assure compliance with Part 121 and other FAR requirements. We should also remember that in the mid-1990s, in evaluating the need for improvements in the regulatory structure under which commuter airlines--the former term for regional airlines--operated, the FAA responded with the support of ATA and its members by requiring them to adhere to FAR Part 121, the same regulation under which mainline airlines operate. As a result, the rule that became effective on December 20, 1995 imposed a ``one-level-of-safety'' standard that continues to this day. It required aircraft with 10 or more passenger seats and all turbojets operated in scheduled passenger service to operate under and comply with FAR Part 121 operational requirements. These included dispatch requirements and the use of certificated dispatchers, new flight/duty time rules, manuals and procedures for flight and ground personnel, cabin safety and flight attendant requirements for 20- to 30-seat airplanes, and new training rules. Moreover, the Department of Transportation, for more than a decade, has required in 14 CFR Part 257 that codeshare arrangements be disclosed to customers before they purchase a ticket. This ``operated by'' language underscores the importance that the government has recognized in maintaining the distinction between the mainline airline and the regional airline. FAA implementation of uniform mainline and commuter regulatory requirements has raised questions about mainline and regional operating environments. The most significant of those concerns and our responses follow. ``Two-tiered safety environment.'' As noted previously, since 1995 the FAA has imposed one level of safety on the air carrier industry-- whether with respect to training, flight deck crew competency, etc. If the NTSB or FAA determines that regional airline performance within that unitary regulatory structure requires additional attention, it should reformulate its compliance efforts as necessary. Flight/duty time regulations. An issue that has arisen in the Buffalo accident is the role of flight-deck personnel commuting. That, it should be clear, is not a flight/duty time issue. Commuting is within the exclusive control of the pilot or copilot. It is expected, and the law assumes, that they will report fit to work. It is the responsibility of the crew member to inform the carrier if he/she is unable to fly because of fatigue, whether because of commuting or for any other reason. That is why Part 121 airlines staff reserve crew members. Flight deck crew compensation. With but one exception, pilots at all larger regional airlines are represented by unions and they work in a seniority-based system. Compensation is a function of collective bargaining. Neither legislation nor regulation can effectively peg what is the right compensation in such a system of negotiated wages, benefits and working conditions. Sterile cockpit rule. The FAA imposed the sterile cockpit rule in 1981. Its longstanding prohibition against ``nonessential conversations within the cockpit'' is well-known. To the extent that compliance with the rule is a concern at any Part 121 carrier, it is a matter for the FAA to pursue. Centralized pilot record database. A centralized database of pilot records would make it easier to evaluate the backgrounds of applicants for flight deck positions. We urge the FAA to determine if such a database can be efficiently implemented. To be successful, however, it must be complete. Results of all pertinent actions relating to the pilot's competency must be recorded and accessible to an airline evaluating an applicant. Conclusion We will work diligently with other stakeholders in evaluating and responding to the results of the NTSB investigation of the Buffalo accident and the Inspector General's assessment of the FAA regulatory oversight program. This week's FAA ``call to action'' meeting was part of a vital initiative that we believe will contribute appreciably to this effort. It is in that informed context that any further action to improve safety should be examined. Senator Dorgan. Mr. May, thank you very much. And next, we'll hear from Mr. Cohen. Mr. Cohen, you may proceed. STATEMENT OF ROGER COHEN, PRESIDENT, REGIONAL AIRLINE ASSOCIATION Mr. Cohen. Thank you. Chairman Dorgan, Senator DeMint, and members of the Subcommittee, I'm Roger Cohen, and I'm President of the Regional Airline Association. I want to express our deepest sympathies for the lives of the passengers and crew of Flight 3407 that were lost, and for the families affected by the crash. We deeply share in their grief. And I also want to express, today, not only for our member airlines, but for our 60,000 highly trained professionals, our total unwavering commitment to safety. As we work toward ensuring this post---as we work toward this--let's make sure this post-accident process does not have to be repeated. We will take whatever steps are necessary so that our flight crews and our aircraft are as safe as humanly possible. The safety of our Nation's skies is a shared responsibility. At Monday's FAA summit, five of our regional airline CEOs and other senior leaders in--five of our CEOs joined with Federal agencies, major airlines, and union representatives to candidly explore all of the issues making headlines over these past few months. Regional airlines have but one objective, and that's to prevent any future accidents. And as we do that, as this Committee has noted, it's important to keep our perspective and to reassure the American public that flying is extremely safe. In fact, until this recent tragedy, commercial airlines had gone the longest period in aviation history without a fatal accident. Working collectively, rolling up our sleeves with all parties--government, labor, manufacturers--airlines have steadily improved our safety record over the course of many decades of safety initiatives, investigations, and reviews of accidents and incidents, large and small. Nevertheless, we can and must do better. Our industry's number-one goal has been, and always will be, zero accidents and zero fatalities. Mr. Chairman, at your request, our member airlines provided the Committee very detailed information about their operations, their training, their hiring, and their employees. Today, we will try to better define the airline--the regional airline industry to clear up some of the misconceptions. More importantly, we will talk about the steps that regional airlines have already taken and the actions we plan to take to further focus our total commitment to safety and accident prevention. Our airplanes typically carry up to 100 passengers. More than 50 percent of all of the scheduled airline passenger flights in the United States are on regional airlines. And, most notably, three out of every four commercial airports in this country are served exclusively by regional airlines. Our airlines, as you've indicated, largely operate in seamless partnership with the major airlines. Regional airlines provide the crew and the aircraft, while major airlines set the flight schedules, the fares, and the customer-service policies. Regional airlines and our major airline partners operate as a single, integrated system. One ticket, one trip, one safety standard. All passenger airlines are subject to the exact same FAA safety standards and requirements. It has been this way for more than a decade. Our goal is to prevent accidents, and that's why we are earnestly and eagerly supporting the FAA's Call to Action, and why the Regional Airline Association has embarked on our own Strategic Safety Initiative to underscore our safety culture and to help prevent accidents. This Strategic Safety Initiative has four elements: First, we'll be bringing together our safety professionals to review all of the procedures and address any issue that can even be perceived as a contributing factor to an accident. Second, we will conduct a thorough review of fatigue, looking at all the human factors in the scientific field to minimize the risks associated with fatigue. Third, we will implement a Fatigue Awareness Management Program so that our airlines keep this issue top-of-the-mind for both our flight crews and, just as importantly, airline management. Fourth, we will reach out in partnership, with you in Congress, across the government, and to our fellow stakeholders in labor and throughout the aviation industry, to explore the full range of issues which could help us improve safety and prevent future accidents. And among those are, number one, establish a single integrated FAA database of pilot records. Second, explore random fatigue testing. Third, examine the practice of commuting. Fourth, extend the period for background checks from 5 to 10 years. And fifth, seek to analyze the information from cockpit voice recorders in settings other than accident investigations. And mine all this tremendous data of check rides to look for trends to help prevent future accidents. Mr. Chairman, the Regional Airline Association thanks you for the opportunity to testify today and for opening the dialogue on these critical issues. We look forward to keeping you informed. And I welcome any questions you might have. [The prepared statement of Mr. Cohen follows:] Prepared Statement of Roger Cohen, President, Regional Airline Association Good morning Mr. Chairman, Senator Hutchison, and Members of the Committee. My name is Roger Cohen. I am the President of the Regional Airline Association. Our 31 member airlines carry more than 90 percent of the passengers traveling on regional aircraft. The circumstances that prompted the Committee to convene today's hearing are tragic. We share the Committee's concern for the lives of the passengers and crews that have been lost and the grief suffered by their families and loved ones. The challenge now facing this Committee, Federal aviation safety agencies, and the aviation industry is to review all of the issues and take whatever steps are necessary to prevent accidents in the future. We appreciate the open lines of communication this Committee has kept with our industry, including the opportunity to meet with Aviation Subcommittee Chairman Dorgan to share our thoughts in advance of this hearing as well as the opportunity to include our members in a survey of commercial airline safety programs and industry best practices. We hope you find this continuing dialogue to be as valuable as we do. Federal safety statistics clearly show that flying is the safest mode of travel. A person is far more likely to have a fatal accident traveling in a car, train, or bus than traveling by air. According to the National Safety Council, the fatality rate for cars is 7,700 percent higher than for commercial aircraft and the fatality rate for trains and buses is 300 percent higher. This remarkable safety record is the result of decades of dedicated work from aviation safety professionals, both in the government and in the industry. Nevertheless, the pursuit of improved aviation safety is a shared and continuous effort, to which regional airlines are committed, along with everyone else in the commercial airline industry. The industry's overarching goal has been and always will be zero accidents and zero fatalities. We are committed to working with Congress, the FAA, the NTSB, and aviation safety experts in academia to ensure that we can meet this goal. Mr. Chairman, for the purposes of aiding this Committee with its inquiry, our testimony will focus on two broad areas. First, we will take a few moments to reacquaint the Committee with the regional airline industry. Anyone who has done background research on the industry prior to this hearing would have found a large number of inaccuracies portrayed in the media, and such misconceptions will not help the Committee carry out its responsibilities. Second, we will talk about the steps regional airlines have already taken and the actions they plan to take to even further intensify their focus on aviation safety. The regional airlines are launching a new initiative to advance industry safety standards. We also believe that Congress can provide additional safety tools for the industry. Regional Airlines Regional airlines operate regional jets or turboprop aircraft ranging in size from about 10 to 100 seats and provide scheduled passenger service on short- and medium-haul routes that connect more than 600 smaller towns and mid-size cities to each other as well as to the Nation's major hub airports. This network offers passengers seamless service to almost every community in the country and many around the globe, serving 160 million passengers last year. Shorter flights to less heavily populated areas on smaller aircraft should not be equated with fewer flights or limited reach. Over the last 20 years, the industry has worked to match aircraft size to the market, leading to vast improvements in service to many communities that would otherwise not have air service. Today, more than 50 percent of all scheduled flights are operated by regional airlines and three out of every four commercial airports in the United States are served exclusively by regional airlines. Regional airlines operate in full partnership with major airlines. Indeed, major airlines either contract with regional airlines to provide service on selected routes or have an ownership stake in regional airlines. In this relationship, a regional airline is responsible for providing the crew and maintaining the aircraft. The major airline, for which the regional carrier is providing service, determines flight schedules and fares and sets customer service standards. From the passenger's perspective, the brand of the major airlines is in full view throughout the travel experience. In most cases, the passenger buys the ticket from the major airline, typically checks in at the major airline's counter, may find the in-flight magazine of the major airline, and may even sip a beverage placed on the cocktail napkin of the major airline. Regional airlines and their major airline partners operate as a single, integrated system. The notion of two separate systems is a misconception. That misconception extends to safety standards and it needs to be corrected if Congress is to have an accurate grasp of the situation. The fact is that all carriers are subject to the same strict FAA safety standards and requirements and receive the exact same level of safety oversight, notwithstanding so many erroneous press accounts. Pilot Qualifications. Regional airline pilots are subject to the same training requirements that apply to pilots working for major carriers. The rules are the same for all airlines. Pilots must complete rigorous classroom and simulator training and regularly pass extensive flight checks given by FAA-approved examiners throughout their careers. Each and every check tests a pilot's knowledge and ability to perform both routine and emergency procedures. Each and every question, procedure and maneuver must be executed fully to FAA standards. Unlike many professional tests, the checks that airline pilots must complete are unforgiving. What this means is that airline pilots must complete every aspect of their flight check successfully, in effect scoring a grade of 100 percent, or they cannot fly for the airline. If any aspect of the flight check is not passed, the pilot must receive remedial training and successfully complete a recheck before being allowed to fly again. The FAA also requires pilots to be separately trained and qualified on every type of airplane that they will be operating. Regional airlines comply with these strict safety standards and regularly operate under internal standards above and beyond FAA requirements. For example, the average experience of the RAA member airline flight crews is 3,075 total flight hours for first officers and 8,500 for captains, which far exceed the FAA minimum requirements of 500 and 1,500 hours, respectively. Pilot Background Checks. All airlines conduct in-depth background and safety checks on pilots before they are hired. Two separate sources are consulted. The FAA maintains a database of pilot information established by the Pilot Records Improvement Act of 1996 or PRIA. This database includes information about a pilot's certificates, ratings, medical status and any rule violations for the previous 5 years. In addition, this law requires airlines to contact the pilot's previous airline employer to obtain information about his or her training performance, drug and alcohol tests, and employment status. FAA maintains a separate database, not subject to the PRIA law, which includes a pilot's history of FAA check ride disapprovals. Certainly, integrating a real-time database containing all pilot records would improve access to this vital information. Pilot Fatigue. Rested, alert, and focused pilots are essential for aviation safety. All parties--the FAA, airlines, and pilots--have a role to play in ensuring that pilots are well rested. The FAA has rules in place to avoid fatigue. These rules apply to all pilots and all airlines. Pilots cannot fly more than 100 hours per month. In practice, pilots typically fly less than that--80 to 82 hours during a month. Pilots can fly no more than 8 hours per day. Pilots are required to get at least 9 hours of time off between trips. All airlines construct their pilot schedules in strict adherence to Federal rest rules. In addition, many airlines have agreements with their pilot unions, further limiting the length of their scheduled working days. Computers are used to track pilots' flight and duty time to ensure that they are working within the FAA rest rule limits. Pilots are also required to maintain their own log books and are directed to alert airline management if they are approaching a limit. These systems alert airline management if a pilot is approaching FAA limits. Additionally, airlines provide training to pilots so that they can accurately recognize the signs of fatigue. It is the professional responsibility of every pilot, if he or she does not feel sufficiently well rested, to say so and not fly. Airlines have non-punitive policies in place that allow pilots to drop the trip if the pilot feels incapable of flying alertly. Backup flight crews are in place specifically for this purpose. Pilots must maintain this professional responsibility and ethical obligation to passengers and their fellow crewmembers to conduct themselves in a manner that ensures they are well rested. In fact, the great majority of regional airline pilots are consummate professionals that embrace their responsibilities without hesitation and without compromise. While there are strict FAA rules and regulations in place to ensure pilots have enough time off between duty periods, it is the pilot's responsibility to ensure they get enough rest during their time off and to notify the airline promptly in any case where the pilot did not get sufficient rest. Among the other issues of interest to this Committee, which I would like to review, is pilot compensation. Pilot Pay. The entire airline industry--regional, majors, and low- cost airlines--has a highly unionized workforce that is paid a fair and reasonable wage. Pay levels, the option to commute, and virtually all other work rules are negotiated through the collective bargaining process. The average salary for a regional pilot with the rank of Captain at an RAA member airline is $76,000 a year. This salary is comparable to other professions that utilize similar skills. For example, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the average salary in the architecture and engineering fields is $71,430 per year. In the computer industry or in mathematical sciences the average annual salary is $74,500. A First Officer has less seniority and responsibility than a Captain. The average salary for a First Officer, working at an RAA member airline, is $32,000 a year. Again, this salary is in line with comparable professions. The average salary for a paramedic is $31,980; medical assistants average $29,060 per year. Pilots earn a fair and reasonable wage and also receive valuable benefits such as free airline travel, paid leave, and comprehensive benefits. Also, pilots, while on duty, receive collectively-bargained per diem expenses. Commuting. Some pilots choose to commute and live away from their crew base, which is the airport from which they will begin and end every flight assignment. In fact, commuting is a common and long- standing practice among crewmembers at all airlines, regional and major. Whether to commute and what constitutes an acceptable commute is a choice made by each individual crewmember. In fact, the ability to live where they want to and to fly to where they work is a valuable perk that attracts pilots to the profession. It is important to note that, while many pilots commute, many others do not. Commuting is not necessitated by economics. In fact regional airlines have crew bases in dozens of attractive and affordable communities across the country. On the other hand, those who choose long commutes have a professional responsibility to arrive at work properly rested. As I mentioned earlier, the airlines have non-punitive policies in place to relieve a pilot who is not rested or feels fatigued. Moving Forward: Strategic Safety Initiative RAA is a strong supporter of and full participant in the FAA's call to action. At the request of the Administrator, senior officials from the regional airlines, including five RAA member CEOs, attended the FAA's Call to Action meeting on Monday, June 15. The consensus reached at Monday's meeting is that safety is a shared responsibility. In fact, many specific safety objectives discussed at Monday's meeting were already included as part of the Strategic Safety Initiative (discussed in detail below) launched by RAA member airlines last week. We will continue to support and participate in this valuable dialogue as FAA conducts similar safety summits across the Nation this summer, at which we will address our shared safety goals with our partners within labor and government and with our mainline partners. Indeed, the purpose of the Regional Airline Association's Strategic Safety Initiative is to study and recommend actions responsive to challenges facing the airline industry. The initiative has four elements: 1. Review Safety Procedures The Regional Airline Association will form a task force comprised of safety directors and operations directors from the regional airlines to review safety procedures, giving particular attention to any issue or procedure cited by the NTSB as a contributing factor to any accident. 2. Study Impact of Fatigue RAA will commission a study to look at the impact of fatigue and other human factors on pilot performance. The study will be conducted by an independent and expert organization, in all likelihood a university with a respected aviation program. The study will be framed by a Strategic Safety Advisory Board comprised of industry experts drawn from the ranks of academia, industry, and safety regulators. 3. Fatigue Awareness Management Program The Regional Airline Association will create a fatigue awareness management program for use by its member airlines. 4. Recommendations to Congress We are committed to working with Congress on this initiative and believe that Congress can provide the aviation industry with additional safety tools, including: a. Single Data base of Pilot Records Requiring the FAA to maintain a single, integrated database of pilot records would provide airlines with critical, real-time information about pilot qualifications and performance, thereby improving the process of recruiting, hiring, and training new pilots. b. Random Fatigue Tests Airlines are already required to conduct random drug and alcohol tests on pilots. RAA recommends exploring with FAA and all industry stakeholders the concept of random fatigue tests on pilots to help ensure that pilots are indeed rested before flying. c. Commuting We believe it would be prudent for Congress, working with all stakeholders, to examine commuting in depth, including the possibility of limiting commuting time prior to beginning a work assignment. d. Extend Background Check Time Frame Under current law, an airline conducting a background check on a pilot can only review the last 5 years of the pilot's safety records, qualifications, and training. Extending the review period to 10 years will help airlines identify safety risks. e. Explore Use of Cockpit Voice Recordings for Accident Prevention Currently, cockpit voice recordings can be reviewed only as an accident investigation tool, and RAA clearly understands the sensitive privacy issues involved and the years-long debate about access to the CVRs. Yet, as we saw in the flight 3407 accident, pilots have violated the rule requiring sterile cockpit below 10,000 feet. In our collaborative safety effort, stakeholder groups must look at all potential tools to improve flight safety, including reaching out to our employee groups to explore random, non-punitive ways in which this essential information can be used to prevent accidents. Similar to ASAP and other diagnostic preventative safety programs, an initiative permitting random audits could provide valuable information. f. Improved Tracking and Analysis of Check Rides Current discussion suggests confusion relating to check rides--the image of pilots who have failed check rides continuing to fly aircraft. Every airline pilot is required to pass frequent check-rides during their airline service, and pilots cannot fly until they have successfully completed their required check rides. We believe FAA and the airlines may be able to increase the level of safety through a more detailed analysis of this testing over the entirety of a pilot's career. By working with regulators and the employee groups, the industry may develop a better methodology for assessing pilot performance and instituting remedial training programs that will ensure a higher level of safety. We will be moving expeditiously to implement this initiative and have already begun compiling a list of aviation experts as candidates for our Strategic Safety Advisory Board. We will keep the Committee informed of these activities. Mr. Chairman, the Regional Airline Association appreciates the opportunity to testify before the Committee this morning and I welcome any questions you might have. Senator Dorgan. Mr. Cohen, thank you very much for your testimony. Next, we will hear from Captain John Prater, the President of the Air Line Pilots Association. Mr. Prater---- Captain Prater. Thank you---- Senator Dorgan.--you may proceed. STATEMENT OF CAPTAIN JOHN PRATER, PRESIDENT, AIR LINE PILOTS ASSOCIATION, INTERNATIONAL Captain Prater. Thank you, Chairman Dorgan. We commend this Committee for calling this hearing to take a closer look at some of the critical issues affecting airline pilots and our charges. Many of these issues--pilot screening and hiring standards, training and mentoring--were at the top of the agenda at the FAA's Call to Action Summit in which we participated, on Monday. While this meeting was a critical first step toward developing solutions to these problems, we encourage the FAA to take a more structured approach in working with the airlines and labor to establish an agreed-to implementation plan for all parties to adopt. In recent years, we have to look more at the system. The major airlines have come to rely heavily on codeshare arrangements with the so-called regional airlines to connect large, mid-sized, and small cities in the U.S., in Canada, in Mexico, to their international hubs. This has resulted in the exponential growth of the regional sector of the industry. Still, the major carriers exert a great deal--almost total pressure on the regional airlines to provide their service at the lowest possible price. They control ticket pricing and schedules, and they regularly move flying between their regional partners. This exacerbates breaking the chain of pilot experience. Couple that with 160 or more bankruptcies in the airline industry, and airline pilots leaving the industry because there has been no way to protect and retain that experience in the cockpit, we start over again and again. Some of the major airlines, even today, are outsourcing their flying to the regionals and laying off their own pilots, losing those decades of experience to the profession. These experienced pilots cannot afford to work for one of these so- called ``regional carriers'' as a newly hired first officer. As a result, many of the smaller regional carriers hire pilots near the FAA minimum standards and do not employ adequate screening processes during hiring that identify that ideal candidate. As was brought out during the NTSB's recent hearing on the tragic accident in Buffalo, many pilots who fly for the regional airlines are not getting adequate training or enough rest. Airlines are requiring pilots to work longer days, and more of them each month. Fleet and frequent base changes are forcing pilots to decide between commuting or possibly taking another pay cut to train on new equipment. The consequences? The quality of airline pilot careers has been greatly diminished, and the severe erosion of benefits and quality of life are motivating experienced aviators to move to other professions. Current training practices do not take into account the drastic change in pilot applicants' experience. Instead, they assume that pilots are far more experienced than they may actually be. ALPA believes there must be a new focus on standardization and even on fundamental flying skills. To meet this challenge, airlines and other training providers must develop methodologies to train for that lack of experience and to train for judgment. Current training practices may also need to be adjusted to account for the source and the experience level of that new pilot entering into initial training with his or her airline. ALPA also believes there should be more stringent academic requirements to obtain both commercial and airline transport pilot ratings in preparation to starting a career as an airline pilot. The FAA should develop and implement a structured and rigorous ground school and testing procedures for pilots who want to qualify to fly for Part 121 airlines. ALPA also recommends that airlines provide specific command and leadership training courses for new captains, to instill in them the necessary skills and traits to be a real leader on the flight deck. Airlines should also implement mentoring programs for both captains and first officers as they first enter operations in their new crew positions to help them apply the knowledge and skills to line operations from their more experienced peers. Flight experience and pilot capabilities cannot be measured by mere flight hours. We must remember that each and every pilot out there today has met the FAA standards, has met and trained and exceeded the standards of their airline, who's responsible for certifying them. Turning to another area of concern, for two decades you have heard me and my predecessors speak about the pilot-- problem of pilot fatigue. It's time. We need to address those rules, and we need to change them. Other means to enhance safety and improve airline operations, we agree with Mr. May, data collection and analysis programs, such--in FOQA and ASAP--we need to share that information across the industry and then modify our practices to make sure that the best practices are being used by the entire family of airlines. In order to allow those programs to grow and make these reports more readily obtainable, additional legislative protections will be needed to limit the use of ASAP and FOQA data in civil liability cases and to ensure that the information is used to increase safety. The best safety device on any airplane is a well-trained, well-rested, highly motivated pilot. A strong safety culture must be instilled and consistently reinforced from the highest levels within an airline and among its codeshare regional partners. Thank you for the opportunity to address you, and I'll be ready to take any questions. [The prepared statement of Captain Prater follows:] Prepared Statement of Captain John Prater, President, Air Line Pilots Association, International Good morning. I am John Prater, President of the Air Line Pilots Association, International (ALPA). ALPA is the world's largest pilot union, representing nearly 54,000 pilots who fly for 36 airlines in the U.S. and Canada. ALPA was founded in 1931 and our motto since its beginning is ``Schedule with Safety.'' For more than 77 years, ALPA has had a tremendous impact on improving aviation safety. ALPA is a founding member of the International Federation of Air Line Pilots Associations (IFALPA) and the U.S. and Canada representative to the Federation which joins the pilots of over 100 nations together in safety and security harmonization efforts. Today, ALPA continues to be the world's leading aviation safety advocate, protecting the safety and security interests of our passengers, fellow crewmembers, and cargo around the world. ALPA has lived up to its mandate to the extent that many in the industry, including a former FAA administrator, have referred to us as the ``conscience of the airline industry.'' We applaud the Committee for holding this hearing and appreciate this opportunity to testify about ``Aviation Safety: The Role and Responsibilities of Commercial Air Carriers and Employees.'' We would like to begin our testimony by discussing crewmember fatigue. Crewmember Fatigue Fatigue may adversely affect every flight crew member every time they fly. Due to airline economic conditions which require pilots to work longer days and more of them than ever before, fatigue has reached alarming levels within the industry. The FAA's flight and duty time regulations are woefully inadequate to address today's situation and have not significantly changed in over 60 years, since well before jet transports came into use in the late 1950s. The current U.S. flight and duty time rules are a patchwork of regulations that are intended to address disparate domestic, international flag, and supplemental operations. There have been a number of attempts to revise the regulations over the past 25 years, but those attempts have met with generally abysmal results because of the contentious disagreement by the stakeholders as to which changes were appropriate or needed. One fact about pilot fatigue that is not widely known is that airline pilots frequently spend much more time at work each day than the number of hours recorded actually flying an airplane. This is especially true in the regional industry although the work schedules at the so-called ``legacy carriers'' are by no means free of these same concerns. Currently, airline pilots are routinely assigned duty days of up to 15 hours. During a typical 14- to 15-hour duty day, a pilot can expect to be assigned fewer than 8 hours of flying but up to 8 individual take offs and landings, in various types of weather and across multiple time zones. The time not flying may be spent performing duties such as checking weather, dealing with routing, dispatch and flight paperwork, overseeing aircraft loading and unloading, dealing with mechanical issues, waiting on the ground between flights, and similar activities. Thus, although a pilot may have only flown 7 or fewer flight hours by the end of a duty day, he or she could easily have been on duty 14 or 15 hours. This work pattern may be repeated over a period of several days. The weight of the scientific evidence accumulated over the last 20 or so years has firmly established that the vast majority of humans simply cannot be expected to reliably and safely perform operational tasks beyond 12 to 14 hours on duty. It cannot be overstated that pilots are making their most critical decisions on landings at the very end of their duty day which, due to unplanned circumstances, can easily be 20 hours or more since their last rest period. It is worth noting in this context that most fatal accidents occur during the landing phase of flight. The airlines are required to give pilots only an 8-hour break after any duty day, regardless of its length. Unfortunately, this 8-hour minimum break does not provide an adequate opportunity for recuperative sleep because the break is not an opportunity for 8 hours of sleep, but rather a period of time away from the aircraft. During the 8-hour break, it is not unusual for a pilot to be left with a maximum 4 or 5 hours of sleep opportunity. This occurs because the FAA has defined all time away from the airplane (``release to report'') on a trip as ``rest.'' Incredible as it may seem, the time a pilot spends waiting for a hotel shuttle and going through airport security screening is defined as ``rest'' under the current FAA regulatory scheme. A pilot must also attend to all of his or her other non-work-related daily physical and nutritional needs and requirements during this 8-hour break away from the aircraft. It is not at all unusual for a pilot to elect to forego a meal so as not to further reduce their sleep opportunity. This situation is highly objectionable-sleep experts agree that most adults require 7 to 8 hours of sleep each night to meet their physiological needs and restore their alertness. Pilots need a longer, and genuine, daily rest period than is allowed under current regulations. Another serious deficiency in current regulations is the failure to acknowledge circadian rhythms. Every human has an internal circadian cycle that determines sleep and wakefulness. Typical ``circadian low'' cycles (i.e., a period of reduced wakefulness and energy) will occur from approximately 3 to 5 a.m. and again from 3 to 5 p.m. Performance and alertness may be decreased during the nocturnal window, which is from approximately 2 a.m. until 6 a.m., depending on individual variability. Flight and duty regulations need to acknowledge this cycle. Because the FAA's present fatigue regulations are antiquated and outmoded, they have frequently been augmented by contractual work rules negotiated between pilots and their employers in the decades from 1960 to the mid 80s. Through the restructuring of pilot contracts in corporate bankruptcies (note: over 160 U.S. airlines have gone through bankruptcy since 1980) and the complete absence of negotiated work rule improvements at many carriers, there has been non-uniform treatment of flight duty and rest limitations at the various airlines, leaving only the antiquated Federal Aviation Regulations to govern maximum duty days and minimum rest periods for thousands of airline pilots. Further exacerbating the problem is the fact that pilot wage rates and pensions were slashed by more than 30 percent in corporate bankruptcies forcing pilots to accept even more flights or face their own financial crisis. Fatigue provisions are rarely found within any pilot contract, especially within a regional airline agreement. Of the regional contracts that do have such provisions, only one of which we are aware allows a pilot to recoup his or her lost pay. All contracts of which we are aware contain real threats of disciplinary action if the company determines that a pilot's claim of fatigue was fraudulent. In recent times, there has been severe pressure on individual airlines to slash pilot staffing and reduce rest periods to minimum levels due to a belief that such actions would result in ``productivity'' increases necessary for economic survival. The demands for more monthly and yearly flight hours flown by fewer pilots has lead to endemic fatigue levels, and with fewer pilots staffed on reserve or standby duty for weather disruptions, pilots are forced to fly more flights to the upper limits of the FARs or watch as scheduled flights are canceled for lack of available rested crews. The fatigue cushion once provided by negotiated work rules has been virtually eliminated largely due to a single-minded focus by airline managements on minimizing the labor costs associated with flight operations. This elimination of the fatigue protections once provided by negotiated work rules that were developed over decades of experience at most established air carriers means that today, for more and more pilots, the bare minimum protections afforded by the FAA flight and rest regulations have become a daily way of life. The current cumulative effects of reduced rest resulting from working to minimum FAA limits, combined with the effect of personal financial stress and uncertainty brought about by nearly 8 years of severe economic downtimes in the industry, have taken a severe toll upon pilots. Many pilots feel that they are just hanging on to a barely tolerable job instead of pursuing a once-promising career. Today's airline pilot is typically working substantially more hours for less money and spending more hours away from home than his or her predecessors. In addition, regularly required training events are crammed on top of the monthly flight schedule often paying less than 3 hours of pay for 8 hours of training with none of that time counting toward the FAR flight time limits. The repeated attempts by airline managements in recent years to return U.S. airlines to an era of profitability by cutting labor costs continues to be paid for by the daily sacrifices and toil of airline pilots and other workers. ALPA joins the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), which since 1990 has identified reducing accidents and incidents caused by human fatigue as one of its ``Most Wanted Transportation Safety Improvements'' in the United States, in calling for revisions to the current FAA regulations based on fatigue research, circadian rhythms, and sleep and rest requirements. The current FAA rules glaringly fail to adequately address any of these issues and reform is decades overdue. Other U.S. Federal agencies have moved toward scientifically- based worker fatigue regulations; the FAA is simply lagging behind other agencies when it comes to the need to modernize its fatigue rules. When addressing possible revisions to the current FAA flight duty and rest regulations applicable to pilots, airlines and their pilots are immediately at cross-purposes. Managements are looking for more availability and ``productivity'' from flight crews. For flight crews, safety advocates and scientists, the question is often not whether to change the current rules, but rather how much to reduce the current maximum flight and duty limitations to enhance safety, raise human performance to acceptable levels, and reduce risk. Hence, the past approach of creating proposed regulations on notions of operational necessity without the assistance of scientists and technical advisors, or reference to the technical literature, has failed. Needed are rules which are grounded in the results of scientifically based fatigue studies and safety reports. The International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) has enacted standards that will become effective in November 2009 which will require participating states to adopt rules limiting airline pilot duty periods that are based on science. The United States' airline pilot fatigue rules currently do not meet this new international standard and the FAA will be under pressure to comply. In Europe, new regulations governing airline pilot flight time limitations were enacted in 2008. While implementation of these new regulations in individual European Union member states is an ongoing process, the design and implementation of scientifically-based airline pilot fatigue rules has been underway in Europe for some time. For example, the United Kingdom has for years had science-based airline pilot flight and duty time regulations. The U.K.'s rules, embodied in Civil Aviation Authority document CAP 371, account for human circadian rhythms and adjust maximum pilot duty periods based on time of day, number of flight legs, time zones crossed, acclimatization to local time and other factors. Under these scientifically-based rules, if a pilot who is normally awake during the day and asleep at night reports for duty during the middle of the night, he or she is simply not permitted to work as long as if he or she reported during normal daylight hours. The current FAA rules incorporate none of these modern, scientifically-justified fatigue protections. Pilots performing commercial flying duties must have regulatory safeguards which provide them with an opportunity to get an adequate night of sleep before each duty day of flying. In some cases, pilots may lack access to adequate rest facilities to obtain needed recuperative sleep in order to prepare to safely operate the next flight or series of flights. Unfortunately, the combination of duty periods and personal or industry economic circumstances may in some cases operate to deny a pilot a realistic opportunity to obtain facilities for needed rest. Ensuring that a meaningful opportunity for rest is provided combined with a scientifically determined maximum length duty day, including provisions for the type of flying accomplished--whether it be traditional short haul, multiple sector flying or flights across multiple time zones--is essential to ensure that the U.S. air transportation system continues its envied record of safety. We believe it is possible to implement needed regulatory changes that will adequately address safety needs and the issues related to pilot fatigue without negatively impacting the ability of the Nation's airlines to serve the needs of the public. To that end, we were pleased the Commerce Committee included a provision in S. 1300 to arrange for a study by the National Academy of Sciences on pilot fatigue which will examine recommendations made by the NTSB and the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) on this subject, and provide recommendations concerning the FAA's flight and duty regulations. ALPA stands ready to work with regulators and the industry to develop science-based rules that will adequately address the problem of fatigue. Fatigue Risk Management Systems A fatigue risk management system (FRMS) is a science-based, data- driven process used to continuously monitor and manage fatigue risks. An FRMS is intended to be implemented within an airline's safety management system (SMS) to allow operational efficiency for unique and specific operations when needed while also mitigating fatigue-inducing factors. An FRMS offers an effective, alternative means of evaluating and managing risk when compared to a purely prescriptive scheme but it is intended to be built upon--and create synergy with--defined, prescriptive flight and duty time regulations. I would invite the Committee to review ALPA's white paper on FRMS, published in June 2008, for additional information on this subject. Revised regulations must provide guidance based on science that accounts for start and stop times related to crew circadian rhythms, the number of takeoffs and landings related to crew duty days, and any time zones that must be crossed. Science-based regulations, coupled with an FRMS, can allow some flexibility in unusual flight operational situations. Since fatigue is such a critical factor in daily airline operations, ALPA published The Airline Pilots' Guide to Fighting Fatigue in October 2008. This booklet may be carried by crews and provides guidance to understanding and dealing with fatigue. Understanding and mitigating fatigue is extremely important and assists crews in flying in as rested a state as possible, given the inadequate regulations governing the tempo of operations. We are presently updating this document to give pilots guidance on ``responsible commuting.'' Airline Training Programs Most airlines, which include many of the major or ``legacy'' carriers and the larger, ``mature,'' regional airlines, do an outstanding job of hiring and training pilots. They normally require significant flight experience including substantial amounts of multi- engine and turbojet time. However, some smaller regional airlines which may have very thin profit margins due to the economics of the contract between them and their major airline, have traditionally not offered compensation packages which enable them to hire experienced pilots. As a result, they must often employ pilots with little experience and bare minimum qualifications who are willing to take these low-paying positions in exchange for an opportunity to build experience so that they can move to a career airline. Some airline training programs, including those at mature regional airlines, are extensive and exceed the regulatory minimums. When pilot experience at the new-hire level dropped severely below 1,000 hours, or less than a year's worth of total flight experience, these airlines wisely extended their training process and doubled the initial operating experience (IOE) program requirement for these pilots. However, this cannot be said for all airlines. Economic pressures push some airlines to train to the minimum requirements set by regulations. These minimums were established decades ago and were based on pilots coming into the airlines with much more experience than many pilots have today. Experience allows pilots to broaden their approach to problem solving and decisionmaking above the technical proficiency needed to fly the aircraft. It allows for the recognition of outside patterns and trends that develop during the course of routine flights and permits crewmembers to accomplish tasks specific to their cockpit position as well as be aware of the tasks being performed by other crewmembers. Experienced pilots tend to identify more pertinent clues and generate more alternatives in problem solving and decisionmaking than inexperienced pilots ALPA believes the licensing and training methodologies used successfully in the past may not work where airline pilots entering airline operations do not have the background or experience that previous generations of incoming airline pilots possessed. In meeting this challenge, the airlines and other training providers must develop methodologies to ``train experience'' that in the past was acquired in the traditional maturation and progression to becoming an airline pilot. This training should include extensive and detailed academic courses of learning taught in classrooms by well-qualified instructors. Screening Few, if any, airlines tailor their training programs based on their new hires' past flying experience. The airline industry has seen significant changes--some of which involve pilot demographics--that have not been reflected in our training practices. For example, there are considerably fewer former military pilots in the airline ranks than in years past. The military services extensively screen their candidates, who are generally required to have a four-year college degree, before being accepted into pilot training. Once accepted, military training provides intense and rigorous classroom academic instruction as well as in-depth flight instruction that takes over 1 year. Additionally, pilots today coming from non-military backgrounds often do not have the challenging experience of their predecessors on which to build--e.g. flying corporate, night freight, or flight instructing--before being hired at entry-level, or regional air carriers. These demographic changes require a new focus on standardization and professionalism training and even some fundamental flying skills. The previous training programs based on the assumption of more experienced pilot candidates will not be sufficient; ``one- size-fits-all'' training is ill suited to the task. The financial commitment of training and the historical time commitment to build experience to qualify to be hired by an airline through the civilian route and the considerable time and sacrifices needed to serve in the military acted as a screening process to eliminate those only marginally interested in becoming an airline pilot. However, with new pilots being hired with as little as 200 hours total flight time (much of which could have been in a simulator) and fewer military pilots seeking airline jobs, this de facto screening process that helped ensure only the highest performing people make it to the airlines is no longer effective. Today, many regional airlines do nothing to discourage their experienced pilots from quitting so as to hire lower-paid replacements. Flight experience and pilot capabilities cannot be measured by mere flight hours. Airlines used to have an extensive screening process that included psychological tests, academic knowledge tests, simulator flying skill evaluations and medical conditioning exams. As the number of pilot applicants declines and airlines become more desperate to fill the positions, these screening processes have been reduced and some elements completely eliminated. Airlines need to reestablish thorough screening processes, or their equivalent, to ensure that the applicants they hire will be able to maintain an equivalent or better level of safety, professionalism and performance than their predecessors. Flight schools need to implement extensive screening processes for students pursuing a professional pilot career. Regulators need to provide the oversight to ensure that these screening tools are implemented effectively by the airlines and flight training organizations, as well as modify pilot qualification regulations to include much more rigorous education and testing requirements in order to provide a screening process that begins prior to initial pilot certification and continues at the airlines. Command and Leadership Training The FAA does not currently require command training for pilots who upgrade to captain. The agency does require that an applicant for an airline transport pilot certificate have knowledge of aeronautical decisionmaking and judgment, as well as crew resource management, to include crew communication and coordination. We do not consider these requirements to rise to the level of command training. The difference between the two approaches is a focus on knowing what to do versus knowing how to do it. Training in decisionmaking, for example, might emphasize all the things that a pilot must investigate in order to make a sound decision, but might not provide strategies for how to stick to that good decision in the face of pressure from outside entities to compromise. The role of captain includes far more than the ability to fly the aircraft from the left seat and perform the checklists. Some airlines have courses for teaching prospective captains how to lead a crew, exercise command authority, take charge of a situation, and so forth, all of which are critical safety skills that must be learned. They are not simply inherent to being the one ``in charge.'' Specific training should include emphasis on setting the tone for compliance by adhering to standardized procedures. Other topics that should be trained include reinforcing the skills, aptitude, and character necessary to lead fellow crewmembers (informally or otherwise) in compliance with procedures. Need for Stronger Academic Emphasis The Joint Aviation Authority (JAA), now the European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA), and FAA pilot licensing requirements are both ICAO-compliant. The single biggest difference between EASA and FAA is knowledge requirements. The FAA theoretical knowledge is simply not as demanding as EASA, which has 14 written exams versus one by the FAA, which is a multiple-choice exam. The EASA exams require the student to be tested for 30-40 hours. By stark contrast, the FAA publishes its exam questions with answers provided so a student can purchase them, study the questions, and pass its single exam. Examination questions are not available for EASA exams in such a manner. The least demanding Federal Aviation Regulations which govern commercial pilot license requirements (i.e., 61.125 and 61.155) specify the aeronautical knowledge requirements for commercial and airline transport pilot ratings. These rules were written decades ago, when there was no expectation that they would be used as minimum standards to train pilots to take jobs as airline first officers. The requirements emphasize weather and navigation, including interaction with air traffic control. There is some mention of aircraft aerodynamics and human factors, including aeronautical decisionmaking and judgment as well as crew resource management. The regulations allow self-study and many such training courses emphasize passing the test rather than learning the material. We do not feel these requirements are adequate to prepare a professional airline pilot. The ground instruction of these subjects needs to be strengthened with required formal classroom academic instruction and more extensive testing and examination. The EASA-approved training course for a commercial airline pilot tends to be rather structured and rigorous. FAA should develop and implement a corollary ground school and testing process in FAR Part 121 for all pilots who seek commercial airline careers. Testing akin to the quality of the Certified Public Accountant (CPA) exams or bar exam for attorneys would benefit aviation by serving as a screening tool to ensure that, in the future, only the most knowledgeable and dedicated pilots join the ranks of airline pilots. Airline Relationships The past several years have been very turbulent ones for the major, legacy airlines which have experienced numerous bankruptcies and changing operations. Rather than using their own pilots on the mainline seniority list to fly the 50- to 90-seat jet aircraft or modern 76-seat turboprop aircraft into mid-size and smaller cities in the U.S., Canada and Mexico, they have established economic relationships with regional airlines to provide this service and feed the major carriers through their hub cities. The major carriers exert a great deal of economic, and other pressures on the regional airlines to provide their service at the lowest possible price. The major carrier controls all aspects of ticket pricing and schedules and regularly moves flying between their regional partners, which forces major changes of pilot domiciles among the regional carriers. An operational and safety relationship providing surveillance and oversight of regional airline operations must be required and maintained by those major carriers who either own or contractually use regional airlines. Even with these relationships, there is no guarantee that ``One Level of Safety'' will be provided by the dependent carriers. Safety comes not just from oversight from an outside airline or organization but is an intrinsic value built into an airline from the highest levels of internal management. Given operational criteria and guidance, this value must be recognized and nurtured to realize true safety in operations. ALPA's endeavors to establish One Level of Safety and contract standards have been rebuffed by the managements of some mainline and regional carriers. Before the practice of codesharing with regional partners began, ALL flying was done by the pilots of an airline on one, single pilot seniority list. This practice ensured that several years of airline operations experience for newly hired airline pilots--even those with military or thousands of hours of previous civilian flight time--was earned before assuming the command responsibilities of an airline captain. The pilots of the name brand airline were trained and met the same high standards, whether they flew 70-seat DC-9's or 400-seat B- 747's, or they were not promoted to be an airline captain. The pilots that once flew for such regional airlines (which were in the 70s and 80s referred to as ``national carriers'') as Ozark, Southern, North Central, Hughes AirWest, AirCal , Allegheny, Piedmont, PSA, and Frontier, held career jobs at those carriers. They flew 40-50 seat propeller-powered aircraft and 70- to 100-seat jet aircraft. They had good jobs with pensions, work rules, and wages that made them career destinations. Those pilots were not just trying to gain experience to get a job with a major airline. Their pilot seniority list operated to guarantee stability and years of cockpit experience before assuming command. The merger mania of the 80s saw those carriers swept into the major or legacy airlines. Then, as competitive cost concerns increased with the post- deregulated upstart carriers, the legacy airlines began to outsource the flying to as many as a dozen new ``regional'' partners flying 30- to 50-seat props and 50- to 90-seat jets. The name brand airline then began the practice of having their ``partners'' bid against each other to maintain these ``fee for departure'' outsourcing contracts. As the legacy airlines replaced more and more mainline flying by this outsourcing scheme to regional operators, they furloughed hundreds of highly experienced pilots, and refused to allow these experienced pilots to fly for the contractor carrier, effectively replacing them with lower paid and lower experienced pilots. With this overriding concern on lowering costs by the legacy carrier, the stable and experienced regional partners were whipsawed against each other and forced to continually lower their costs to today's substandard levels or be replaced by another newly created contractor. This system of replacing one regional with another has created unprecedented, rapid growth at a few low-cost regionals where newly hired pilots are upgraded to Captain with less than 1 year of air line flying experience. A copilot seeking to upgrade to captain with the minimum of 1,500 total hours has not been through several years of thunderstorms and winter storms despite the fact that they meet the FAA minimums. He or she has not flown with hundreds of other Captains nor been through several years of annual training and checking events. Before this unconscionable focus on outsourcing mania began, most airline pilots would have 10 or more years of airline experience as a co-pilot before qualifying for command. The legacy airlines grant these outsourcing contracts to the regional carriers for short periods from 2 to 7 years so that higher costs and their experienced pilots can once again be replaced by new airlines with new pilots. Today, even though the ``regional'' carriers are flying up to 40 percent of the U.S. airline domestic system, few of the regional airline pilot jobs created by the outsourcing schemes are worthy of an experienced aviator career. The duties and responsibility of a captain and a co-pilot flying 30 to 100 passengers for a regional partner airline is just as important to their passengers as a Captain flying a B-777 or Airbus 330 for a legacy carrier. In a further example of this safety compromising business practice, the legacy airline, will oftentimes during growth periods refuse to hire the experienced ``regional'' pilot from one of their fully owned or contract partners to become a co-pilot on a 100-120 seat mainline airplane. However, that same pilot may be a captain flying a complex jet aircraft with 70 passengers on 5 or 6 flights per day in the service of the codeshare, mainline airline which sold the ticket to the passengers. This cycle of outsourcing with very little oversight by the ticket-selling carrier has created a very unstable environment which has broken the One Level of Safety mandate. The NTSB has performed several safety studies of the regional, air taxi, and air carrier industry. As a result of those studies, the Board called upon major airlines and their code-sharing partners to establish a program of operational oversight that would include periodic safety audits of flight operations, training programs, and maintenance and inspection as well as emphasize the exchange of information and resources that will enhance the safety of flight operations. The Board believes that there may be large differences between code-sharing partners in terms of the knowledge, expertise, and other resources for assuring safe operations. They noted that this is particularly true when a code-sharing carrier uses the brand identity name and paint scheme of the larger carrier. Passengers have no choice but to fly on the code-share carriers even though they purchased their ticket from the major carrier and deserve the same level of operational oversight, control and service, which the code-share partner may not be able to deliver. The regional airlines, in their own cost-saving measures, have gone to extraordinary lengths to provide their product at the lowest possible price. As an example, Trans States Holdings, which operates Trans States Airlines, established a second subsidiary airline, GoJet Airlines, which operates United Express flights from United Airlines hubs at Chicago O'Hare, Denver, and Washington Dulles airports flying Bombardier CRJ700 Regional Jets. A passenger buying a ticket on United Airlines may very well, unwittingly, end up on a GoJet flight. As a new airline, GoJet can abrogate prior relationships their parent airline may have with service providers to provide cheap airline seats for their codeshare partner. Another example of this type of cost pressure can be seen at Midwest Airlines which has outsourced over 75 percent of its flying to regional partners. They have laid off 75 percent of their experienced pilots and replaced them by contracting with Republic and Skywest Airlines. Midwest Airlines refuses to train their long-time pilots in the new smaller jet aircraft. This has the effect of the Midwest pilots with over 15 years of airline experience being replaced by pilots with less than 3 years experience in a blatant disregard for the value of its own employees. Economics of outsourcing to cheaper contractors has clearly trumped the safety value of maintaining experience in the cockpit. Pilots flying for airlines like GoJet, Gulfstream, Colgan and others are at the bottom of the economic scale with starting salaries below $20,000 per year. In many cases, pilots have accumulated extraordinary costs just to earn the basic FAA licenses of commercial, instrument and multi-engine ratings. A 4-year flight education at a college or university can cost from $120,000 to $180,000, or more. It is difficult to repay these expenses and maintain any sort of reasonable lifestyle on the starting pay of a regional pilot. So these jobs frequently end up as a stepping stone to a major carrier, an opportunity to build valuable flight time before moving on to a more lucrative job with a major carrier. In fact, some airlines publicly call themselves ``stepping stones'' without reservation, as could be heard in a recent NTSB public hearing. This type of relationship effectively represents a disincentive to provide more than the bare minimum training or to provide any motivation for experienced employees to remain. Typical wage differences between major and regional carriers can be as much as $70,000 for a Captain and $50,000 for a first officer at 5 years of service. The differentials increase dramatically the longer the pilot is employed. When an econ"
