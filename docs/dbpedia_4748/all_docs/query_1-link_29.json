        "text": "The Shenandoah Valley Regional Airport Commission was created in 1956 by a group of local business and community leaders from five localities: Harrisonburg, Staunton, Waynesboro, and the counties of Rockingham and Augusta. This forward-thinking group knew for our local economy to grow, an air transportation facility with substantial capabilities would be critical. Today, these same localities have businesses and industries that depend on the facilities and services provided at SHD as an essential part of their day-to-day operations. SHD is a critical partner in regional economic development efforts and works collaboratively with the Shenandoah Valley Partnership, the region’s economic development and marketing organization. Close proximity and access are core criteria when companies are looking to invest, grow and expand. It often begins with their first visit to the Valley through the doors of SHD.\n\nShenandoah Valley Airport serves as the ultimate gateway to our beautiful and diverse region while meeting the area’s varied and growing aviation needs. We pride ourselves on our premier aircraft services for private and corporate customers, and reliable airline flights with great connections to the world. Our first-class customer service is guaranteed every time you choose to fly with us. We know that we are your first step into the Valley, and we don’t take that responsibility lightly. We keep you in mind at every step, from offering free parking to providing complimentary flight booking assistance and more. Travel with us to experience firsthand the difference that flying local makes."
