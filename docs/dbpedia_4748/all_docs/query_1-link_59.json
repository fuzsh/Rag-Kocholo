        "text": "The Salt Lake City International Airport (SLC) is operated and managed by the Salt Lake City Department of Airports, a department of Salt Lake City Corporation. Salt Lake City's Mayor, the City Council and a nine-member advisory board of citizen volunteers oversee its affairs. The department also operates South Valley Regional and Tooele Valley Airports.\n\nSLC is the 21st busiest airport in the United States and the 70th busiest in the world. More than 330 flights depart daily to 95 nonstop destinations. In 2023, SLC saw a record 26,952,754 passengers travel through the airport.\n\nSLC is currently undergoing a $5.1 billion redevelopment program. Phase 1 of the program opened in the fall of 2020, while Phase 2 opened in the fall of 2023. Phase 3 is scheduled to open in fall of 2024 and Phase 4 by 2026. The project is being funded by user fees--primarily by airlines serving SLC--as well as savings, car rental fees, passenger facility charges and airport revenue bonds. No local tax dollars are being spent on the project.\n\nThe mission of the Salt Lake City Department of Airports is to develop and manage a system of airports, owned by Salt Lake City, which provides quality transportation facilities and services to optimize convenience, safety and efficiency for aviation customers. The vision is to achieve excellence and unprecedented customer service in making Salt Lake City among the most convenient and efficient air ​​transportation centers in the world.\n\nAirport Management\n\nAn executive director, appointed by Salt Lake City's Mayor, leads the management staff along with eight directors.\n\nFunding\n\nAn enterprise fund of Salt Lake City Corporation, the Department of Airports is a self sustaining organization requiring no funding from property taxes, general funds of local governments or special district taxes. Capital requirements are met from earned surpluses, revenue bonds, passenger facility charges and Federal Aviation Administration grants under the Airport Improvement Program.\n\nFacilities\n\nSLC is located five miles northwest of downtown Salt Lake City. The airfield consists of three air carrier runways and a general aviation runway. Runway 16L/34R is 12,003 feet long, runway 16R/34L is 12,000 feet long, runway 17/35 is 9,596 feet long and runway 14/32 is 4,900 feet long.\n\nThere is one terminal and two concourses (A & B).\n\nA short-term parking terrace sits adjacent to the terminal. Rental car companies are located in the Gateway Center adjacent to the parking garage. Long-term parking is located south and west of the terminal buildings and is serviced by shuttle buses. The shuttles run every five minutes and are free. General aviation facilities including fixed base operators are located on the east side of the airfield. All cargo companies are located on the north end of the airport campus.\n\nDelta Air Lines operates a reservations center headquartered at the airport. Support facilities include two fire stations, an aircraft rescue and fire fighting training center, Delta and SkyWest Airlines maintenance hangars and a United States Post Office."
