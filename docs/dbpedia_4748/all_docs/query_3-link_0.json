        "text": "Regional airline of the United States\n\nThis article is about the airline. For its holding company, see Republic Airways Holdings.\n\nNot to be confused with the defunct Republic Airlines.\n\nRepublic Airways Inc. is a regional airline in the United States headquartered in Indianapolis, Indiana. Republic operates and maintains aircraft used on flights that are scheduled, marketed and sold by a partner mainline airline. The company is contracted by American Airlines (as American Eagle), Delta Air Lines (as Delta Connection), and United Airlines (as United Express).\n\nHistory\n\n[edit]\n\nIn 1999, Republic Airways Holdings incorporated a new subsidiary, \"Republic Airline, Inc.\"[4] but the subsidiary had no activity prior to 2004 and no ability to operate aircraft prior to 2005. In 2004 the holding company activated Republic Airways in reaction to a pilots' suit against American Airlines.\n\nAmerican had awarded the flying of 44-seat regional jets to Chautauqua Airlines, then the main operating subsidiary of Republic Airways Holdings. However, Chautauqua later started to operate 70-seat regional jets on behalf of United Airlines, and this caused American to be in violation of its pilot union scope clause, which prevented an airline from operating on behalf of American if that airline was operating jet aircraft of more than 50 seats, even if such aircraft were operating on behalf of a carrier other than American. To repair the situation, Republic Airways Holdings activated Republic Airline, and upon Part 121 certification in 2005[5] allowing Republic Airline to operate commercial service. Republic Airways Holdings then transferred the offending 70-seat regional jets from Chautauqua to Republic Airline. American was then no longer in violation of its pilot union scope clause. Republic Airways Holdings paid $6.6 million to the pilot union of American Airlines to settle the issue.[6]\n\nUS Airways' pilots had a scope clause prohibiting the airline from operating large regional jets such as the Embraer 170. The airline negotiated around this clause by offering flight deck jobs to laid-off US Airways pilots, in a program known as \"Jets for Jobs\". This agreement created a subsidiary, MidAtlantic Airways. As part of US Airways' bankruptcy restructuring, the 25 Embraer 170s delivered to MidAtlantic were bought by Republic to help US Airways come out of bankruptcy; Republic operates them along with additional newly delivered aircraft.[citation needed]\n\nIn 2007, Frontier Airlines signed an 11-year service agreement with Republic Airways. Under the agreement, Republic would operate 17 Embraer 170 aircraft for the Frontier Airlines operation. The first aircraft was placed into service in March 2007, and the last aircraft was expected to be placed into service by December 2008. On April 23, 2008, Republic Airways Holdings (parent of Republic Airline) terminated its service agreement with Frontier Airlines, which entered Chapter 11 bankruptcy in early April 2008. Subsequently, Republic Air Holdings purchased Frontier Airlines in bankruptcy. Frontier-branded Republic Embraer 190 aircraft provided regional capacity support. In September 2013, Republic Airways Holdings sold Frontier Airlines. As part of the sale, Republic Airways terminated the Frontier-branded Embraer 190 from flying.[citation needed]\n\nOn February 1, 2008, Republic Airways opened a base at John Glenn Columbus International Airport in Columbus, Ohio.[citation needed]\n\nOn September 3, 2008, Republic signed a new 10-year codeshare agreement with Midwest Airlines. The aircraft would be based at Kansas City International Airport beginning October 1, 2008. Twelve aircraft would be placed in service with Midwest. On June 23, 2009, Republic announced it would acquire Midwest Airlines for $31 million.[7]\n\nIn January 2013, Republic Airways Holdings reached a capacity purchase agreement with American Airlines to operate Embraer 175 airplanes under the American Eagle brand beginning in mid-2013.[8] Republic began service as an American Eagle affiliate on August 1, 2013, from Chicago to New Orleans, Pittsburgh, and Albuquerque.[9]\n\nOn February 25, 2016, the airline filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection. The airline was hit hard because of pilot shortages, but a new contract ratified in October 2015 helped restructure the airline. At the time of filing, Republic Holdings claimed $2.97 billion in liabilities and $3.56 billion in assets.[10][11] On November 16, 2016, Republic Airways Holdings filed their Plan of Reorganization with intentions to emerge from Chapter 11 during the first quarter of 2017.[12]\n\nIt was announced that parent company Republic Airways Holdings would merge subsidiaries Shuttle America and Republic Airways into one company, with Republic Airways being chosen as the surviving company. On January 31, 2017, Shuttle America merged with Republic Airways. In December 2018, the operating division was renamed Republic Airways to match its parent company.[citation needed]\n\nAs of January 31, 2017, Republic Airways has the largest fleet of Embraer 170 and Embraer 175 aircraft in the world.[original research?]\n\nDestinations\n\n[edit]\n\nAs of January 2024, Republic operates for American Eagle, Delta Connection, and United Express.\n\nList of destinations[13] (As of January 2023 ) City Country (Subdivision) IATA Airport Notes Ottawa Canada (Ontario) YOW Ottawa Macdonald–Cartier International Airport Toronto Canada (Ontario) YYZ Toronto Pearson International Airport Montreal Canada (Quebec) YUL Montréal–Trudeau International Airport Quebec City Canada (Quebec) YQB Québec City Jean Lesage International Airport Havana Cuba (La Habana Province) HAV José Martí International Airport Fayetteville/Springdale United States (Arkansas) XNA Northwest Arkansas Regional Airport Little Rock United States (Arkansas) LIT Clinton National Airport Hartford United States (Connecticut) BDL Bradley International Airport Fort Myers United States (Florida) RSW Southwest Florida International Airport Jacksonville United States (Florida) JAX Jacksonville International Airport Key West United States (Florida) EYW Key West International Airport Sarasota United States (Florida) SRQ Sarasota–Bradenton International Airport Atlanta United States (Georgia) ATL Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport Savannah United States (Georgia) SAV Savannah/Hilton Head International Airport Chicago United States (Illinois) ORD O'Hare International Airport Base Indianapolis United States (Indiana) IND Indianapolis International Airport Base Lexington United States (Kentucky) LEX Blue Grass Airport Louisville United States (Kentucky) SDF Louisville International Airport Base New Orleans United States (Louisiana) MSY Louis Armstrong New Orleans International Airport Bangor United States (Maine) BGR Bangor International Airport Portland United States (Maine) PWM Portland International Jetport Baltimore United States (Maryland) BWI Baltimore/Washington International Airport Boston United States (Massachusetts) BOS Logan International Airport Base Worcester United States (Massachusetts) ORH Worcester Regional Airport Detroit United States (Michigan) DTW Detroit Metropolitan Wayne County Airport Grand Rapids United States (Michigan) GRR Gerald R.

Total orders were for 36 aircraft, which were operated in an 80-seat configuration under the US Airways Express brand name.[15]\n\nIn July 2010, Republic ordered a further 24 Embraer 190 aircraft.[16]\n\nIn May 2012, Republic Airways agreed to fly the 28 Bombardier Q400s for United Express that bankrupt Pinnacle Airlines planned to return to its lessors.[17] The Q400 fleet was retired in 2017.[citation needed]\n\nRepublic Airways Holdings signed a three-year contract in October 2012 with Caesars Entertainment Corporation where its Republic Airways subsidiary would operate five Embraer 190 aircraft to provide more than 1,500 charter flights annually for Caesars. Service began in January 2013. This contract ended in August 2015 and all Embraer 190 aircraft were sold or returned to the lease holders.[18]\n\nIn January 2013, Republic Airways Holdings reached a capacity purchase agreement with American Airlines to operate 47 Embraer 175 aircraft under the American Eagle brand beginning in mid-2013. The regional jets would be deployed out of American's Chicago hub. In addition, Republic would have options to purchase an additional 47 Embraer aircraft beginning in 2015.[8] Republic took first delivery of the Embraer 175 jets in July 2013 and service began August 1, 2013, from Chicago to New Orleans, Pittsburgh and Albuquerque.[9] Republic began using Miami as an American Eagle hub in October 2014 and New York-JFK in May 2015.[19]\n\nIn late 2015, it was announced Republic Airways achieved approval from the FAA for Extended Overwater Operations (EOW), which allows Republic to operate up to 162 nautical miles from shore. As of January 31, 2017, only Republic Embraer 175 aircraft operating for American Airlines are equipped to operate as an EOW aircraft. American Airlines uses Republic to operate aircraft out of Miami International Airport to various Caribbean and Central American destinations, including the Bahamas, Mexico, Panama, Belize, Honduras, Costa Rica, Turks & Caicos, Cuba, Guadeloupe, and the French West Indies.[citation needed]\n\nIn late 2016 it was announced, due to the impending merger with Shuttle America, that the 80-seat Embraer 175s operated for American Eagle (previously US Airways Express) would have the last row of seats removed (4 in total) to conform with Delta's scope clause, which limits all regional jets to a maximum of 76 seats. These aircraft were retrofitted to American's standard Embraer 175 layout.[citation needed]\n\nOn January 31, 2017, all existing aircraft operating under the Shuttle America operating certificate were transferred to the Republic Airline Inc. operating certificate, thus ceasing operations for Shuttle America, and completing the merger process of both subsidiaries. The move made Republic the largest operator of Embraer 170 and 175 aircraft in the world.[citation needed]\n\nOn December 20, 2018, Republic Airways announced that it had finalized a firm order for 100 Embraer 175 aircraft, stating that deliveries for the new aircraft would start in the second half of 2020 [20]\n\nIn October 2019, Republic received the first of 30 Embraer 175s to be transferred from Compass Airlines upon the cancellation of their contract with Delta.[21]\n\nIn September 2021, Republic agreed to sell 11 Embraer 170s and 6 Embraer 175s to Envoy Air.[citation needed]\n\nRetired fleet\n\n[edit]\n\nRepublic Airways retired fleet Aircraft Year retired Bombardier Q400 2017 Embraer 190 2015\n\nIncidents\n\n[edit]\n\nOn April 9, 2017, a passenger was forced off of a Republic-operated United Express flight in Chicago bound for Louisville. The passenger was forced off the flight by Chicago Department of Aviation officers after he refused to give up his seat to an airline employee. He attempted to run back onto the aircraft but was forcibly removed. A video posted on social media showing him being injured and dragged off the plane led to a public outcry against United Airlines.\n\nOn June 21, 2018, a Republic-owned Embraer 170 registered N876RW was damaged by a fire while undergoing maintenance at John Glenn Columbus International Airport. The aircraft was deemed to be damaged beyond economical repair.[22][23]\n\nSee also\n\n[edit]\n\nAir transportation in the United States\n\nReferences\n\n[edit]"
