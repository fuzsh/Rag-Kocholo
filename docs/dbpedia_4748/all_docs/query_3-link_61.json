        "text": "The E-BUS RADAR platform promotes and monitors the initiatives of Latin American cities to integrate electric buses (e-buses) into their urban public transport systems. The objectives of this platform are: (1) to monitor and map e-bus fleets in operation; (2) to promote data transparency; and (3) to quantify the annual CO2 emissions reduction attributed to these vehicles.\n\nThe E-BUS RADAR data pertains to the systems in operation as of July 2024, in Latin American cities and metropolitan areas that already have e-buses in their public transport fleets. E-buses that have been purchased but are yet to enter the fleets are not showcased on the platform. We invite you to read this publication developed by the ICCT, which provides detailed information on the methodology for calculating the CO2 emissions avoided in the life cycle by electric buses in operation.\n\nIn some cases, the E-BUS RADAR also highlights cities with ongoing tenders that will lead to significant deployments of e-buses.\n\nAs the e-bus fleet grows in Latin America, this platform will be regularly updated, and several new cities will be added. Being a collaborative platform, if you have any observations regarding any mistakes or lack of data in the platform, or any other comments, please do not hesitate to contact us at: zebra@c40.org.\n\nWhy e-buses?\n\nEmissions from the transportation sector result in over $1 trillion in health damage every year. The growth of this sector has also contributed to expanding greenhouse gas emissions associated with rising sea levels, temperatures, fires, and other impacts on climate change.\n\nUrban bus fleets are the primary mode of urban mobility for hundreds of millions of citizens in Latin America. However, these fleets are still powered by diesel, an antiquated and highly polluting technology. In order to tackle the challenges posed by diesel engines to air quality and climate, cities must embrace an energy and technological transition.\n\nE-buses are an excellent solution for promoting cleaner and healthier urban areas while supporting local and national governments in achieving their climate goals. In this context, the expansion of e-bus fleets in Latin American cities is key to the economic and global future.\n\nWho are we?\n\nPartnership:\n\nDTU: DTU is recognized internationally as a leading technical and natural sciences university, renowned for its focus on sustainability and business-oriented approach. Through collaboration, DTU creates value, welfare, and growth by developing. The UN’s 17 Sustainable Development Goals function as a platform for the University’s activities.\n\nZEBRA: Financed and facilitated by ClimateWorks and co-led by C40 Cities and the ICCT, the Zero Emission Bus Rapid-deployment Accelerator (ZEBRA) partnership aims to accelerate the deployment of zero-emission buses in major Latin American cities.\n\nC40: C40 connects almost 100 of the world’s largest and most influential cities, representing 700+ million citizens and one-quarter of the global economy. C40 mayors are committed to increasing resilience, cleaning the air we breathe, and taking inclusive climate action to create a healthier and more sustainable future for all.\n\nICCT: The International Council on Clean Transportation is an organization founded to provide impartial technical research and analysis to governments and environmental regulators.\n\nSupport:\n\niCS: The Climate and Society Institute is a philanthropic organization that promotes prosperity, justice, and low-carbon development in Brazil."
