        "text": "Pacific Coastal Airlines is a privately owned British Columbia-based regional airlines operating from Vancouver International Airport’s South Terminal (YVR) that currently flies to 18 airports in British Columbia.\n\nWe are the tenth-largest airline operating at Vancouver International Airport (YVR) based on total seats, and the third-largest based on take-offs and landings. We also connect to additional destinations along the south coast of British Columbia through its affiliate airline Wilderness Seaplanes, located in Port Hardy on northern Vancouver Island.\n\nPacific Coastal Airlines was founded by Daryl Smith nearly forty years ago. The truck logger in Bella Coola, a small community on the central coast of British Columbia, decided to get a pilot’s license and purchased a small seaplane to make it easier to get in and out of remote camps. Some friends chipped in for fuel to tag along and thus began the adventure that led to Pacific Coastal Airlines.\n\nThat legacy of dedication and hard work continues with his son, President Quentin Smith, intimately involved in all aspects of the aviation business started by his father. A legendary figure in British Columbia aviation, Daryl has received numerous awards and accolades from his peers and industry associations alike."
