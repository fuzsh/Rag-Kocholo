Professional Standards FAQ If You’re 50, Join The Grey Eagles Pilot Job Fairs and Future Pilot Seminars APA Pilot App: Statistics for July 2024 This is a new message from the APA IT Steering Committee. For the month of July, 15,851 pilots utilized the APA Pilot app and the convenient features it provides, with a record 5.2 million My Open Time Alerts sent to 7,063 pilots. During the last 18 months, the APA IT Department has rolled out successive updates and new features based on member feedback and requests. Recently, these have included a new Robocall, Calendar Sync, Commute Info, and an improved My Open Time alerts. With each new rollout, the membership has responded with positive feedback and follow-on requests for further capabilities. The APA IT Department is hard at work with ongoing development, focusing on the continual improvement of these applications. Looking ahead, here’s a preview of some of the features we will bring online in the coming months: Trips Marketplace. Ability to pilot to pilot drop, advertise shared and last live leg sequences in one convenient application. Logbook . New and updated logbook integrated into the APA Pilot app. Sequence History . One stop to find every change to your sequence HSS/HI3, so pilots will be able to readily reference what their sequence looked like at any point in time. Calendar Sync . Include RAP, DFP and other calendar events for syncing. The APA IT Department, in conjunction with the IT Steering and Operational Analysis Committees, has continued to improve and develop products that pilots have requested. We value all membership feedback — please provide yours via the APA Pilot app, main menu, select feedback. The APA IT Development team will respond promptly. APA Contract Minute – Expenses Away From Base This is a new message from the APA Contract Compliance Committee. CA Saxer is back with a new APA Contract Minute .

APA Medical Minute – FAA Standards for Blood Pressure and Hypertension Medications In the latest edition of the APA Medical Minute , APA Medical Advisor Cassie Bien addresses the FAA’s standards for blood pressure and hypertension medications. YOUnion 401 Retirement Preparation Seminar This is a new message from the APA Compass Project Committee. Intended to help retiring pilots understand their AA margin-bottom: 1rem; box-sizing: border-box;\" type=\"disc\"> For - Pilots within 15 years of retirement From - AA \">When - Wednesday, Aug. 14, 1100 Central How - Via Zoom Webinar Register in advance via the link below: https://alliedpilots-org.zoom.us/webinar/register/WN_bfkfzJKyTkyt_ZqNPOIWeA#/registration After registering, you will receive a confirmation email containing information about joining the webinar. Send your feedback to YOUnion@alliedpilots.org Non-Contracted Hotels This message from the APA Hotel Committee was originally published on March 1, 2024. When there is no APA Hotel Webpage for your assigned hotel, it is a good indicator that you are staying at a non-contracted hotel. We create a webpage for a new hotel once AA has signed a contract with the hotel and an official CCI announcement has been made. If there is no webpage, then APA and AA, most likely, have not vetted this hotel. We see this often in our pop-up and overflow markets, in IROPs situations, and with off-schedule flights, as our contracted hotels may not have availability to accommodate additional rooms. We also see this during relocations, which can happen for a myriad of reasons. Can the company put you at a non-contracted hotel in these situations? Yes. Should you be concerned if you are at a non-contracted hotel? Not necessarily. Often these hotels are very good, but sometimes they are not. One of the concerns the Hotel Committee has with non-contracted hotels (and the source of many Hotel Debriefs on these properties) is that the hotel may not understand crew. When AA signs a contract with a hotel, the market specialist coaches the hotel on how to handle crew. Additionally, this occurs when we conduct a site review. There are many nuances for hotels to plan for when accommodating crew, like room placement and abnormal check-in/checkout times. When you check in to a non-contracted hotel, we recommend you take more caution. Is there a quieter side of the hotel you can request? Request a non-adjoining room if this is important to you. Do they have a late checkout annotated properly if your show time is after the hotel’s normal checkout? Please also understand that there will most likely not be a negotiated discount. Just like a layover at a contracted hotel, you can contact the Hotel/Limo Desk and/or the Duty Pilot to be relocated if you have issues. If you are unable to solve a problem, sometimes a quick call from the Hotel/Limo Desk to the hotel can help. Please debrief issues at non-contracted hotels so we can have AA look into the root cause of the issue or poor selection of the hotel. Sometimes we ask the company to move these hotels to a “do not use” list after receiving your debriefs. “The Safety Culture Needs a Lot of Work” The National Transportation Safety Board conducted a two-day hearing this week in Washington, D.C. regarding the Jan. 5 Alaska Airlines midflight door plug blowout and broader concerns about the state of Boeing’s manufacturing and quality control. NTSB Chair Jennifer Homendy said “the safety culture needs a lot of work. It is not there from the evidence itself. There’s not a lot of trust.” In a News Nation interview, APA Communications Committee member CA Dennis Tajer — who attended the hearing — characterized the situation at Boeing as “a human factors nightmare.” National Aviation Week at the 9/11 Memorial During National Aviation Week from August 19-25, the 9/11 Memorial text-decoration: underline; background-color: transparent; transition: 0.2s; cursor: pointer; box-sizing: border-box;\">www.911memorial.org/aviationweek Please print your ticket before you visit. Once you arrive, you will be asked to present your flight crew credentials. The Memorial is open daily from 8 a.m. to 8 p.m. Eastern, and the Museum is open Wednesdays through Mondays from 9 a.m. to 7 p.m. Last entry to the Museum is at 5:30 p.m. Our Recommended Reading List This is a new message from the APA Aeromedical Committee. In an effort to improve our members’ health, we have created a recommended reading list. Each month, we will highlight a book that has helped in the prevention of, treatment of, or recovery from an injury or illness, or has elevated a member’s education. Feel free to send your book recommendations to aeromed-committee@alliedpilots.org . The Sports Gene: Inside the Science of Extraordinary Athletic Performance The debate is as old as physical competition. Are stars like Usain Bolt, Michael Phelps, and Serena Williams genetic outliers put on Earth to dominate their respective sports? Or are they simply normal people who overcame their biological limits through sheer force of will and obsessive training? In this controversial and engaging exploration of athletic success and the so-called 10,000-hour rule, David Epstein tackles the great nature vs. nurture debate a how far science has come in solving it. Through on-the-ground reporting from below the equator and above the Arctic Circle, revealing conversations with leading scientists and Olympic champions, and interviews with athletes who have rare genetic mutations or physical traits, Epstein forces us to rethink the nature of athleticism.

We believe they are the best in the business. When repetitive problems do arise, they’re often due to managerial decisions that fail to properly prioritize tasks and to management’s decision to outsource a significant portion of the airline’s maintenance to offshore, third-party repair stations. Since July 7, A319 aircraft 738 has been written up for a right engine start fault 13 times and out of service eight times. It was last signed off on August 8 and is currently restricted to AA maintenance stations only. Since April 4, A319 aircraft 769 has been written up for vibration issues 19 times and out of service 17 times for a total OTS time of more than 1,400 hours (two months). During this time, it has operated under an SFP (Special Flight Permit) to maintenance bases three times and has accomplished six Functional Check Flights (FCFs). It remains out of service and is restricted to AA maintenance stations only. APA Welcomes Leadership Class This is a new message from the APA Membership Committee. Click the image for a closer look. On August 7, the APA Membership Committee hosted a casual dinner for the following pilots who were in Fort Worth for American Airlines’ Professionalism, Leadership, and Mentoring class: Gregory Allen, Micholas Charnas, Justin Chase, William Cordoba Arenas, Andreas Demiris, Jose Garza Jr., William Green, Robert Habisreitinger, William Hewlett, Mitchell Lucas, Brian Martin, Andenet Mekonnen, James Nunley, David Schmarr, Andres Serrano, Michael Tsegai, Derek Turner, and Robert Tyson.

Professional Standards FAQ If You’re 50, Join The Grey Eagles Pilot Job Fairs and Future Pilot Seminars Thank You to Everyone at Oshkosh We thoroughly enjoyed meeting all of the pilots and their families who stopped by our hospitality area during EAA AirVenture Oshkosh, and we appreciate the efforts of the APA Family Awareness Committee, who made six evenings’ worth of dinners and happy hours possible. APA Medical Minute – Prostate Health In the latest edition of the APA Medical Minute , APA Medical Advisor Kathy Parr discusses prostate health, noting that it’s one of the most common topics members inquire about. APA Contract Minute – Reassignments This is a new message from the APA Contract Compliance Committee. CA Jason Saxer is back with a new APA Contract Minute . In this edition, he discusses Section 15.N, which provides for a pay, no credit removal from future flying for pilots reassigned over their Individual Monthly Maximum or the Company Limit on Voluntary Flying. Final Report on Governance and Reform This is a new message from the Governance and Reform Ad Hoc Committee. Last week, APA Vice President CA Chris Torres gave the Governance and Reform Ad Hoc Committee’s final brief to the Board of Directors. The committee, created last year in recognition of the APA membership’s desire for reforms, conducted extensive membership polling and interviewed former National Officers and Domicile Officers. Based on that feedback, the committee crafted a total of 57 proposals for Board consideration, with the Board approving 41 of them for action. The Board subsequently considered 24 related resolutions and voted to approve 22 of them. All members are welcome to read the committee’s final report . If Wait Times are Excessive, Help Yourself This is a new message from the APA Hotel Committee. Last week, we discussed “Booking in Progress.” What about when you arrive at a layover destination and realize you don’t have a room for the night, perhaps because you timed out? As many of you have experienced, wait times for Crew Tracking and the Hotel/Limo Desk have been lengthy lately. We do not recommend excessively delaying your rest because of these waits. If the wait time is excessive, and you know you will be laying over in the current city (Crew Tracking has repaired your sequence or you have timed out), you can book your own hotel room and ground transportation and expense them to the company. As a reminder, APA does not recommend using BizHero for company travel. To file an expense report for hotel and/or transportation reimbursement, you will need to use the SAP Concur app on your company iPad or use the link in AAPilots: Personal box-sizing: border-box;\">You will need to submit a photo of your receipt(s). All receipts for a particular trip may be included in the same Pilot Expense Report and must be submitted within 60 days of the incurred expense. Please contact your base flight office if you need help submitting a report. For more information, check out the recently updated QRH – Quick Reference Hotels document. This resource answers 99 percent of all hotel, transportation, and layover questions while providing helpful solutions. Suggestion: Download this QRH document to your AA iPad for easy access in the future. Join Us for YOUnion 401 on Aug. 14 This is a new message from the APA Compass Project Committee.

Summer Statistics and Updates This is a new message from the APA Scheduling Committee. TTS enhancement continues to be a priority for the Scheduling Committee. Progress has been made even with the company’s commitment to Contract 2023 implementation. We continue to engage with our company counterparts on improvements and functionality. Notable stats from June: Highest number of TTS transactions ever. Highest number of PVDs used (facilitated by trading). Record low sick usage. (If pilots are trading, no need to use sick time.)

AAL Reports “Bronze Medal” Earnings This week, AAL management reported second quarter earnings that lived up – or lived down, rather – to this forecast from JP Morgan airlines analyst Jamie Baker: “The company (AAL) likely remains on the bronze medal podium when it comes to Big 3 margins.” During the earnings call, CEO Robert Isom disclosed that the failed sales and distribution strategy reduced revenue by $750M for the first half of the year, and management expects another $750M in lost revenue for the second half of the year, for a total 2024 impact of $1.5B. Here are some excerpts from the AAL filing to the Securities and Exchange Commission: “The company’s previous sales and distribution strategy will continue to impact its revenue performance and earnings through the remainder of the year.” “The company expects its third-quarter 2024 adjusted earnings per diluted share to be approximately breakeven.” “The company now expects its full-year 2024 adjusted earnings per diluted share to be between $0.70 and $1.30.” (~$460-$854M) “The company reduced total debt by approximately $680 million and is now more than $13 billion, or approximately 87%, toward its goal of reducing total debt by $15 billion by the end of 2025. The company ended the quarter with approximately $11.7 billion of total available liquidity.” Pre-Tax Profit (excluding special items) DAL: $2 billion UAL: $1.7 billion AAL: $1.04 billion Free Cash Flow (FCF) DAL: $1.3 billion UAL: $1.9 billion AAL: $850 million Margins 2Q24 Pre-Tax Op. Margin EBITDAR DAL 13.0% 14.7% 18.2% UAL 12.1% 13.1% 17.9% AAL 7.3% 9.7% 15.7% As for the $1.5B worth of lost revenue this year, Forbes reported that Delta and United have been coy in discussing whether American’s loss benefitted them. But APA spokesman CA Dennis Tajer said it clearly went to the rival carriers’ coffers. “We don’t need Nancy Drew to determine where the $1.5 billion went,” he said. Airline Analysts on AAL: “Disappointing,” “Discouraging,” and “Uninspiring” You can click here for an in-depth account of Wall Street analysts’ reactions to the AAL earnings call, but here are a few excerpts: Jamie Baker of J.P. Morgan: “We’d have to go back to the Arpey era (pre-dating both its merger and its bankruptcy filing) to identify an American earnings call as discouraging as Thursday’s. ... To paraphrase one investor, American’s call sounded disappointingly like ‘the old America West script but with meaningfully elevated costs,’ sentiment we can’t really push back on.” Thomas Fitzgerald of TD Cowen: “We expect the airline’s commercial challenges (overexposure to domestic and LatAm, challenges with corporate travel, underexposure to long-haul international) to weigh on margins. Driving significant changes in strategy will require years of elevated CAPEX investments and diminish the company’s prospects for generating consistent free cash flow.” Conor Cunningham of Melius: “American has been crystal clear that adjustments to the distribution strategy that cost them $750 mm in 1H are underway. But a further review of the business is needed as they lag Delta and United on margins. Investor patience is very thin at this point and additional adjustments are needed for a credible margin recovery story to return.” Look for an Updated Logbook in the Coming Months This is a new message from the APA IT Steering Committee. Thanks to the hard work of FO Ken Lambert, along with many others, an updated Logbook will be launched this fall with a revamped user interface and design, along with new features, integration, and attention to detail. New features will include: Convenient access to your flying Table and calendar view Sequence grouping of flying Running convenient totals Sequence- and flight-level detail of flying with integrated map overview Handy filters to search and display data Multiple export options Integrated statistics visualizations We are also diligently working to update and improve our previously released products and features and are excited to showcase them in the coming weeks. Here are just a few to look forward to: Trips Marketplace: Will include drops, shared sequences, last live leg. APA Calendar Sync: Supporting other calendars and an increase in the number of data items that can be synced. Sequence History: No more taking a snapshot of your HSS! EVERY update and change will be available to browse and access. Open Time Detected Log: A history of all open time to allow for further analysis of your MyOT alerts using the reasons report functions. Again, thank you to FO Lambert, CA Vince Trevarton, the other pilots on the IT Steering and Operational Analysis committees, and the staff in our APA IT Department for the hard work put in by all. As always, please keep your valuable feedback coming! It only helps to improve the services provided to our pilots. Check Out Our New Military Guidebook This is a new message from the Military Affairs Subcommittee. On Monday, the Military Affairs Subcommittee conducted a town hall via Zoom and briefed the Board of Directors in person. During the Board briefing, the subcommittee hosted FBI and Homeland Security agents to give a brief update on international travel concerns and the best paths to stay safe once you leave American soil. Most of the tips and pointers can be found on the DHS or FBI websites or the Security Committee’s page on AlliedPilots.org. Bottom line: Once you leave American soil, be prepared for anything, stay conservative in your actions, and be alert to your surroundings. The Zoom town hall began with FO Christine Simpson providing an overview of the new APA Military Guidebook . We believe the document is a one-stop shop for all military-related questions a pilot might have while serving our country and flying for AAL. The Guidebook can now be found on the Military Affairs page on AlliedPilots.org (Documents > General). The town hall also covered the high points we have seen over the past year in a PowerPoint presentation that will be posted on our webpage. Due to a technical issue with Zoom, we were unable to record the session. We will host another town hall next spring to highlight ongoing issues our pilots face. Stay safe flying, and reach out to us with any concerns at militaryaffairs@alliedpilots.org . “Booking in Progress” Guidance Has Not Changed This is a new message from the APA Hotel Committee. The last week has been rough! No doubt, many of you have felt the weight of putting our operation back together on your shoulders. Many crews have had difficulty getting hotels assigned due to lengthy waits getting their sequences repaired by Crew Tracking and lengthy waits on hold with the Hotel/Limo Desk. APA’s position has not changed. We recommend that you DO NOT DEPART on your last leg to a layover when “Booking in Progress” shows in your CCI Hotel/Limo information, unless you receive confirmation that you have lodging, or you are directed to depart by a Chief Pilot. “Booking in Progress” is a placeholder when no reservation exists. It does not necessarily indicate someone is actively working on booking you a room. Multiple crews have not followed this guidance lately and written to us to tell us it was a mistake. Crews who have waited to secure lodging have experienced lengthy waits after their last leg of the day. Some crews had the misfortune of arriving at a sold-out market only to learn that they were stuck with no hotel options. Had they insisted a room be booked prior to departure, this would not have happened. Although it’s not required, you may want to advise the Company of the reason why you aren’t departing and advise that you will be prepared to depart as soon as lodging is confirmed. If you can’t get through to the Hotel/Limo Desk, try the Duty Pilot, or consider sending an ACARS or HISEND message. Do not let the issue distract you from your preflight duties. Take care of yourself; take care of your crew. For more information, check out the recently updated QRH – Quick Reference Hotels document. This resource answers 99 percent of all hotel, transportation, and layover questions while providing helpful solutions. Suggestion: Download this QRH document to your AA iPad for easy access in the future. Concourse Conversations at DFW on July 31 This is a new message from the National Communications Network. Along with the DFW Domicile Officers, we will host Concourse Conversations from 0900 to 1500 on July 31 outside the new Terminal A Operations. These events provide an opportunity for members at large to deliver feedback directly to union volunteers. We will be collecting feedback to send to the Board of Directors and National Officers. If your schedule allows, please stop by to chat. Pigs of the Week APA commends American Airlines’ hardworking aircraft maintenance technicians for their outstanding work. We believe they are the best in the business. When repetitive problems do arise, they’re often due to managerial decisions that fail to properly prioritize tasks and to management’s decision to outsource a significant portion of the airline’s maintenance to offshore, third-party repair stations. Since July 7, the Digital Flight Data Recorder on A321 aircraft 799 has been written up 11 times, been on MEL three times, and been out of service seven times. It was most recently signed off on July 25. Since June 13, the Flight Control ELAC (Elevator and Aileron Computer) 2 faults on A321 aircraft 553 have been written up 15 times and been out of service seven times.

Good News for CDG Layovers This is a new message from the APA Hotel Committee. CDG layovers will continue at three airport properties through Sept. 8 due to the excessive drive times because of the Olympic-only lanes into the city. As a result of these relocations, the company has offered to reimburse pilots and flight attendants for one round-trip coach train ticket to downtown Paris. You can submit your receipt via Concur for reimbursement. Please note that this offer, which is good through Sept. 8, applies to only one round-trip coach ticket per layover. Each of our CDG airport properties have crafted an informative welcome letter for AA crews that includes this information. Please exercise heightened situational awareness if you choose to go into the city, as there is increased risk of crime during the Olympics.

Our Recommended Reading List This is a new message from the APA Aeromedical Committee. In an effort to improve our members’ health, we have created a recommended reading list. Each month, we will highlight a book that has helped in the prevention of, treatment of, or recovery from an injury or illness, or has elevated a member’s education. Feel free to send your book recommendations to aeromed-committee@alliedpilots.org . Curable The United States is fast becoming the sickest nation in the Western world. Cancer rates continue to rise. There is an epidemic of chronic disease in children. Even with all the money and modern innovations in science, the country’s health care system is beyond broken. Clearly there is a glitch in the system. But what if the solution has been here all along, and we’ve just been too blind to see it? In Curable , journalist and health care advocate Travis Christofferson looks at medicine through a magnifying glass and asks an important question: What if the roots of the crisis are psychological and systemic, perpetuated not just by corporate influence and the powers that be, but by you and me? It is now known that human perception is based on deeply entrenched patterns of irrational thought, which we attach ourselves to religiously. So how does this implicate the very scientific research and data that doctors rely on to successfully treat their patients? Disclaimer: This recommendation is for general informational purposes only and does not constitute the practice of medicine or other professional health care services. Always consult with your medical provider when making health care decisions. Pigs of the Week APA commends American Airlines’ hardworking aircraft maintenance technicians for their outstanding work.

Participants do not have “First Amendment” protections in their use of The Line, and all participants are subject to the reasonable rules for use as set forth in the AUP. Participants who violate the terms of the AUP remain subject to suspension or permanent ban from The Line. As noted, reinstatement of these limited subforums is on a trial basis. During its upcoming regularly scheduled summer meeting, the Board of Directors will likely deliberate on The Line’s future and potential changes to related policy. Positive Rate Episode 26: Strategic Planning Committee In the latest episode of our “ Positive Rate ” podcast, Communications Committee Deputy Chair FO Melissa Monahan talks with Strategic Planning Committee Chair FO Scott Yancy, who details how the committee’s planning efforts have centered around eliminating silos and encouraging greater collaboration among the elected leadership, committees, and staff. He encourages all members to engage with APA and notes that engagement can be as simple as voting in all elections and membership referendums. He also cites volunteering for the National Communications Network as a simple path to union service. NCN volunteers meet face to face with pilots in airports around the system to collect member feedback. Each episode of “Positive Rate” features various APA leaders and the subject-matter experts working on the membership’s behalf. The podcast is available through popular streaming services, including Apple Podcasts, Stitcher, and Spotify – you can search for “Positive Rate” or “Allied Pilots Association” on your platform of choice to subscribe and download. Your first opportunity to listen will be via AlliedPilots.org/Podcasts . We welcome your feedback on this format. If you have a question or a comment, please send it to Communications Director Gregg Overman via goverman@alliedpilots.org. APA Medical Minute — More About Calcium Score Cardiac Testing In the latest edition of the APA Medical Minute , APA Medical Advisor Kathy Parr addresses what happens after you complete the cardiac calcium score testing procedure and have been provided with a number. “That’s a Cornfield or the Hudson River” CA Dennis Tajer showed his pack of Post-it notes to CBS News’ Kris Van Cleave Hours before its deal with the Justice Department was announced , Boeing was the topic of the lead story on this week’s edition of CBS Sunday Morning . APA spokesman CA Dennis Tajer told senior transportation correspondent Kris Van Cleave that he’s “more ready than I’ve ever been” to fly the company’s planes. “I have absolutely no hesitation in flying the aircraft based on what I know about it,” he said. “The unnerving part – particularly on the MAX – is that I don’t know what you put on it that you decided not to tell me.” Last month, CA Tajer was also featured in a 60 Minutes Australia report on the issues surrounding Boeing. In both interviews, he highlighted an FAA airworthiness directive that references “off-airport” landings. “What the heck does that mean? That’s a cornfield or the Hudson River.” Join Us for YOUnion 301 on July 17 This is a new message from the APA Compass Project Committee. The Compass Project and APA Vice President CA Chris Torres will host a “YOUnion 301” meeting via Zoom at 1100 Central on July 17. This “Captains’ Development Seminar” is intended to help new captains and soon-to-be captains understand their authorities, APA support, and safety trends within our airline. Click here to register for the July 17 meeting . Retiring Pilots Honored Via Fini Flight This is an updated message from the APA Family Awareness Committee. CA Tom Force was honored on June 5 at DFW. Fini Flight is an APA program designed to honor our retiring members. If a pilot chooses to participate, we meet them at the gate after (or sometimes before) their final flight as an American Airlines pilot. We include friends and family, play some music, bring a cake (or donuts), and make their last flight memorable! You can see more photos from our June celebrations on Facebook . For more information on how to get involved, as an honoree or as a volunteer, email finiflight@alliedpilots.org . Incidentals Charges This is an updated message from the APA Hotel Committee. This is a reminder to please remember to pay all incidentals you have charged to your room before you depart the hotel. Every month, the AA Hotel Contracts team has to contact crew members through their base Flight Offices to remind them to pay their incidentals. Additionally, these oversights can sour a relationship between a good hotel and the company. A good practice is to never charge to your room unless you already have a credit card on file, and make sure you have no unpaid charges at checkout. We have also seen an uptick in pilots being charged for their room at non-contracted hotels when they put their credit card on file for incidentals. We recommend that you ask for a zeroed-out bill before you depart any hotel if you choose to put a card on file. As a reminder, you should never be required to place a credit card on file by a hotel. If a hotel says they require you to do so, and you do not plan to put incidental charges on the room, please reach out to the Hotel-Limo Desk for resolution. For more information, check out the recently updated QRH – Quick Reference Hotels document. This resource answers 99 percent of all hotel, transportation, and layover questions while providing helpful solutions. Suggestion: Download this QRH document to your AA iPad for easy access in the future. What Are Geomagnetic Storms? This is a new message from the APA Aeromedical Committee. Illustration courtesy of NASA A geomagnetic storm is a disturbance in the Earth’s magnetosphere. These are typically due to solar winds, solar flare, or coronal mass ejections. Some impacts to aviation include reduced GPS fidelty (RNP and well as en route GNSS signal), HF radio loss, and/or increased radiation dosage. For more information, please refer to the Pilot Occupational Health Subcommittee’s webpage . If you have questions, please send to cmte-occupationalhealth@alliedpilots.org . Pigs of the Week APA commends American Airlines’ hardworking aircraft maintenance technicians for their outstanding work. We believe they are the best in the business. When repetitive problems do arise, they’re often due to managerial decisions that fail to properly prioritize tasks and to management’s decision to outsource a significant portion of the airline’s maintenance to offshore, third-party repair stations. In the last month, the weather radar on B737 aircraft 3GJ has been written up 16 times and out of service 11 times. On July 12, with the radar on MEL, it operated an in-service reposition ferry to a main maintenance base, where it remains out of service and restricted to Class 1 and 2 maintenance stations. APA Welcomes Leadership Classes This is a new message from the APA Membership Committee. On July 3, the APA Membership Committee hosted a casual dinner for the following pilots who were in Fort Worth for American Airlines’ Professionalism, Leadership, and Mentoring class: Keith Allison, Kenneth Bach, Wayne Benson, Tibor Farkas, Stephen Farlow, Kendall Grimmonpre, Christopher Henshall, Brian Horeczko, Edward Kelley, Arno Knapen, Jesse Lea, Matthew Morehouse, Som Chai Odom, Jennifer Palmer, Francisco Razo, Victor Stoeckmann, Marc Werner, and Ian Whitcomb. On July 10, the committee hosted a casual dinner for the following pilots who were in Fort Worth for the PLM class: Zachary Balas, Richard Blagg Jr., Frank Botti, Brad Carstens, Ahmed Fakih, Rudy Foskuhl, Louis Lagro, Robert Mcnamara, Juan Melendez Millan, Michael Redmon Jr., Casey Ronayne, Adam Shepherd, Shad Vinson, and Elisha Walker.

On behalf of the 16,000 American Airlines pilots the Allied Pilots Association (APA) represents, I am proud to pledge our steadfast support for the Irish Air Line Pilots’ Association’s efforts to conclude CLA negotiations with Aer Lingus management. APA has a longstanding history of standing shoulder to shoulder with our Irish brother and sister pilots. Like professional pilots across the globe, you sacrificed to help your airline navigate the challenges of the global pandemic. With the surge in air travel demand, you have watched as the airline’s profits have increased dramatically. Now, in response to the union’s calls to normalize pilot salaries to account for the increased cost of living, Aer Lingus management has instead chosen to employ whipsaw tactics and threaten legal proceedings. Management’s use of traditional strong-arm tactics such as pressuring pilots to fly when they have declared themselves not fit to do so poses a safety threat. APA has a great deal of experience in dealing with a management team that refuses to recognize the value its pilot group provides. We stand ready to share our knowledge and experience with you and provide whatever assistance we can to support your efforts to successfully conclude your negotiations. It is in the best interests of all professional pilots, and the passengers we carry, to work cooperatively to elevate our profession and enhance the margin of safety whenever possible. We are here for you. In Unity, Captain Ed Sicher President, Allied Pilots Association APA Medical Minute – Common GI Procedures In the latest edition of the APA Medical Minute , APA Medical Advisor Tina Smith discusses common gastrointestinal procedures, such as the upper endoscopy and the colonoscopy. Professional Standards Training Set for September This is a new message from the APA Professional Standards Committee. We plan to train new Professional Standards volunteers at APA headquarters on Sept. 10 and 11, with a Sept. 12 session for pilots who already volunteer on other national committees. If you would like to join us, email CA Pat McGinn via pmcginn@alliedpilots.org . Sudden Grief Response Program to Train New Volunteers This is a new message from the APA Aeromedical Committee. The Sudden Grief Response Program (SGRP) Subcommittee is looking for volunteers willing to be trained in the last two weeks of August. SGRP provides the initial support structure to families in need during one of the worst times of their life by assisting the family and helping them understand the grief process. If you are interested, please contact FO Vern Reaser at vreaser@alliedpilots.org . The training date will be based on volunteers’ schedules. Thank you so much for wanting to be a part of this very valuable team at APA. CIRP Subcommittee Leader Joins Group of Stress Experts This is a new message from the APA Aeromedical Committee. FO Jim Woodke has nearly 30 years’ experience in Critical Incident Stress Management (CISM), a model pioneered by the founders of the International Critical Incident Stress Foundation. FO Woodke recently became the first line pilot appointed to the foundation’s faculty and speakers bureau. The foundation provides training to individuals interested in becoming a part of a crisis management team and to organizations dedicated to helping individuals or groups recover from incidents. APA is one such organization. As a Deputy Chair of the APA Aeromedical Committee, FO Woodke oversees our Critical Incident Response Program Subcommittee. The CIRP Subcommittee is responsible for ensuring a coordinated response toward accident investigators, crew members, and their families after a critical incident. FO Woodke is overseeing APA’s CIRP Subcommittee for the second time, and he held similar leadership positions at other unions before he became an American Airlines pilot in 2008. “It has been an honor to work for all the organizations I have served,” FO Woodke said. “I consider all my efforts to assist others as a debt I am repaying for the assistance I have received; I would not still be in aviation today if it wasn’t for the CIRP program.” What’s a Solar Cycle? This is a new message from the APA Aeromedical Committee. In the last few months, have you noticed the aurora visible much further south in latitude than normal? This is due to significant solar activity (solar maximum) as a result of Solar Cycle 25. To spread awareness and education, the Pilot Occupational Health Subcommittee will periodically answer some common questions regarding space weather. The solar cycle is when the sun fluctuates between solar minimum and solar maximum. Solar maximum is defined as an increase in sunspots (caused by magnetic changing fields) and a magnetic pole shift. This typically occurs approximately every 11 years. For more information, please refer to the Pilot Occupational Health Subcommittee’s webpage . If you have questions, please send to cmte-occupationalhealth@alliedpilots.org . Our Recommended Reading List This is a new message from the APA Aeromedical Committee. In an effort to improve our members’ health, we have created a recommended reading list. Each month, we will highlight a book that has helped in the prevention of, treatment of, or recovery from an injury or illness, or has elevated a member’s education. Feel free to send your book recommendations to aeromed-committee@alliedpilots.org . Traume: The Invisible Epidemic In Trauma: The Invisible Epidemic , Dr. Paul Conti examines the most recent research, clinical best practices, and dozens of real-life stories to present a deeper and more urgent view of trauma. Not only does Dr. Conti explain how trauma affects the body and mind, he also demonstrates that trauma is transmissible among close family and friends, as well as across generations and within vast demographic groups. With all this in mind, Trauma: The Invisible Epidemic proposes a course of treatment for the seemingly untreatable. Here, Dr. Conti traces a step-by-step series of concrete changes that we can make both as individuals and as a society to alleviate trauma’s effects and prevent further traumatization in the future.

Always consult with your medical provider when making health care decisions. Contract Training Offered in MIA on July 11 This is a repeated message from the APA Contract Compliance Committee. The Contract Compliance Committee wants to do everything we can to ensure that all APA members are well acquainted with the 2023 Collective Bargaining Agreement. Join us on July 11 in MIA for a full day of training on the new CBA. This session will include a preview of the Electronic Communication System and the Reserve Assignment System, which are both scheduled to go live on Aug. 31. This training will be conducted in hybrid fashion, with members welcome to participate in person at Dave margin-bottom: 1rem; box-sizing: border-box;\"> Contract training on July 11: Click here to RSVP for in-person attendance . Contract training on July 11 via Zoom: Click here to register . Please take a moment to familiarize yourself with the Electronic Document Index before attending training. You must be logged in to AlliedPilots.org for the links to be accessible. This index connects you to a vast array of APA documents that we will reference. It is equally useful in the daily operation as a line pilot, so we recommend you bookmark the index for future reference. During training, it may be helpful to have two screens—one to run Zoom, and one to reference these documents. Help us help you! The Contract Compliance Committee’s goal is for you—the membership—to be informed, educated, and knowledgeable. Every single pilot should strive to be a contract expert or, at the very least, strive for continued learning and engagement. Knowledge is power, and it will assist you in employing and being a watchdog of your negotiated work rules.

When repetitive problems do arise, they’re often due to managerial decisions that fail to properly prioritize tasks and to management’s decision to outsource a significant portion of the airline’s maintenance to offshore, third-party repair stations. Since April 30, the left engine FADEC on A319 aircraft 752 has been written up nine times, has been on MEL four times, and has been out of service five times. At the time of this writing, it remained on MEL. B737 aircraft 3AT returned to service from a MBV (main base visit) at a contract MRO (maintenance, repair, and overhaul) station on June 18. Since then, the L1 door has been written up and out of service five times. It was most recently signed off on June 27 and is restricted to Class 1 and 2 maintenance stations.

Professional Standards FAQs What is the process for handling issues that occur repeatedly? As human beings, it is expected that behavior changes slowly and, as such, some pilots will always behave as their personality dictates. The Professional Standards process should not be expected to “change” a personality, but more thought of as an opportunity to share how a certain behavior affects peers and colleagues. There will also be the possibility of an employee exhibiting the same behavior because they have yet to be informed there is a different expectation. If an issue has been referred to a committee member, and an employee exhibits the same issue, please be patient and give the committee the opportunity to re-address the issue. As a submitter, if you are concerned, you have the option of updating the committee volunteer on observed progress. If at any time you are concerned with the time needed to process any submission, contact any National Deputy or your elected Domicile Officers for resolution. To read all of the FAQs, click here .

APA Vice President CA Chris Torres, Safety Committee Chair CA Todd Wissing, Strategic Planning Committee Chair FO Scott Yancy, and Director of Benefits Marcy Scott were also on hand. Among the topics they addressed: The status of The Line forums, with CA Sicher detailing the reasons for the suspension and expressing support for restoring the fleet forums. The APA Strategic Plan, with FO Yancy providing an update on plan implementation. The state of American Airlines, with CA Sicher enumerating management’s shortfalls — including its continued focus on short-haul domestic flying while outsourcing more and more long-haul international flying — and reiterating calls for a timely course correction. APA’s safety-related concerns, with CA Wissing detailing management’s handling of ferry flights of non-airworthy aircraft. The ALPA card drive, with CA Sicher and Ms. Scott addressing some of the risks of a decertification vote, including the eventual cessation of APA’s supplemental benefits plans if APA is decertified as the bargaining agent for American Airlines’ pilots. You may listen to a recording of the entire town hall here . Also, in response to reports from some pilots that they weren’t contacted before the town hall began, we have followed up with Telephone Town Hall Meeting, the vendor that assists APA with these events. The vendor is taking steps to ensure that our town hall caller ID, 817-302-2171, is not tagged as spam to ensure pilots receive the call to connect.
