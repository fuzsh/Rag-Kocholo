        "text": "Nicole Brewin to Lead ASLRRA Congressional Affairs Team\n\nWASHINGTON, D.C., August 13, 2024 — Today, the American Short Line and Regional Railroad Association (ASLRRA) welcomes Nicole Brewin as the Association’s Vice President of Congressional Affairs. Ms. Brewin brings extensive Capitol Hill, rail and transportation government affairs experience and substantial expertise in influencing policy and legislative initiatives in both the public and private sectors to the position. She will be leading the congressional affairs team at ASLRRA, working with association staff and member short line railroads to pursue legislative support for critical issues facing the industry including investment in infrastructure, and surface transportation and tax policy.\n\nNew Virtual Reality Training Modules Added To Short Line Training Center\n\nWASHINGTON, D.C., July 22, 2024 — Today, three new virtual reality (VR) training modules have been added to the Short Line Training Center’s online Learning Management System (LMS) - Freight Car Familiarization, Locomotive Daily Inspection, and Class I Airbrake Test & Inspection. These training modules are the first use of VR for the LMS, offering enhanced engagement and motivation for trainees, improved safety and efficiency versus live training, and increased accessibility and scalability for railroads.\n\nREAD MORE\n\nASLRRA Petitions the U.S. Court of Appeals to Hear Oral Argument on Short Lines in FRA Crew Size Rule\n\nWASHINGTON, D.C., July 26, 2024 – TASLRRA, Nebraska Central Railroad and the Texas & Northern Railway Company have submitted a petition requesting an oral hearing to set aside the portions of the Federal Railroad Administration’s Crew Size rulemaking related to legacy operations of single person crew on short line railroads. The petitioners make three points supporting the argument that this rulemaking is arbitrary and capricious, and portions of it should be set aside. 1) There is no explanation for the two-year requirement for legacy operations, 2) the rulemaking limits railroads subsequently required to handle hazmat from operating with a single person crew without prior approval of detailed petitions, 3) the rulemaking requires alerters on railroads that have operated a single person crew safely."
