        "text": "As of the Petition Date, approximately $1.26 million was outstanding under the Debtors’ insurance financing arrangement, which covers the Debtors’ Regional Airline Hull & Liability Insurance and the Debtors’ Workers Compensation and Employer Liability coverage (the “ Insurance Financing”) (collectively, and together with any other prepetition obligationsarising under the Insurance Programs, in a total amount not to exceed $1,500,000, the “Prepetition Insurance Obligations”).\n\nPilot Source Study 2015: US Regional Airline Pilot Hiring Background Characteristic Changes Consequent to Public Law 111‐216 and the FAA First Officer Qualifications Rule.\n\nAccording to the Regional Airline Association, the average plane size flown by regional carriers grew from 24 seats in 1990 to 61 in 2015, and the average trip increased from 194 miles in 1990 to 478 miles in 2015.\n\nOver ten commenters (including SBA’s Office of Advocacy, the Regional Airline Association (RAA), ASA, and Snecma) stated the proposed definition of ‘‘commercial parts’’ was confusing.\n\nFrom the Regional Airline Association: The Regional Airline Association (RAA) member airlines conduct approximately 50% of the U.S. scheduled domestic departures, operate some 40% of the nation’s passenger fleet and carry more than one out of every five domestic passengers.\n\nExample 1—Airline Capacity Purchase Arrangement Major Airline A (lessee) contracts with Regional Airline B (lessor) to provide connecting service into Major Airline A's hub over a five year period.\n\nContractor agrees that, except as expressly permitted hereby or as otherwise directed in writing by United, the Covered Aircraft and the Engines may be used only to provide Regional Airline Services.\n\nThe contract is structured as a capacity purchase arrangement under which Major Airline A purchases the use of Regional Airline B's aircraft and flight crews and other related services.\n\nThe group called on government and industry stakeholders to be cognizant of this history to ensure these mistakes are not repeated.The Regional Airline Association (RAA) and Atlas Air commented that, because it is difficult to predict the amount of time required for the transfer of data, the FAA might need to extend the transition period."
