        "text": "Eligibility\n\nTo be eligible for regular bus services:\n\nStudents in grades K-5 must reside one (1) mile or more from their home school.\n\nStudents in grade 6-12 must reside one and a half (1.5) miles or more from their home school.\n\nStudents must be actively enrolled in a HIDOE public school that has bus service available.\n\nRegular bus services do not apply to students who:\n\nReside within the minimum qualifying distance.\n\nAttend a school outside of their home school area.\n\nRequire transportation to destinations other than their home.\n\nService Exceptions\n\nStudents who do not qualify for regular bus service may receive a “space available” exception provided that there are open seats on the bus route. Parents can apply for this exception by completing the “Request to Ride the School Bus on a Space Available Basis” form (Form CS-101) along with the completed bus pass application form located in the School Bus Handbook. All forms are located at the school office. Forms must be submitted, reviewed and approved by the school principal prior to using the bus service. The approval process may take up to four or more weeks. Students will not be permitted to ride the bus until the application is approved, so parents should plan accordingly.\n\nService Limitations\n\nRegular school bus service is limited to transportation to and from the student’s residential address on record and school.\n\nDepartment-contracted school buses do not travel on private property or on private roads. This includes, but is not limited to private developments, apartment complexes, business parking or driveway areas.\n\nHIDOE school bus stops and travel will be limited to paved and/or maintained public roads and public access roads. Families may need to drive their student to the nearest HIDOE bus stop if they reside on a private road and/or one of the listed areas above.\n\nApplications, Rates and Payments\n\nAll school bus applicants (both paid and free-status riders) must apply on a quarterly basis per the schedule provided below:\n\nQuarter 1: July 15 to September 6, 2024\n\nQuarter 2: September 16 to November 15, 2024\n\nQuarter 3: November 25, 2024 to Jan. 17, 2025\n\nQuarter 4: January 31 to March 28, 2025\n\nApplications are available at the school office or can be viewed online here. For in-person applicants, once applications are reviewed and approved by the school, payment must be received prior to the start of bus service.\n\nOnline applications can also be submitted via eTrition (a valid student ID number is required to apply). For online applicants, once applications are reviewed and approved by the school, families will be prompted via email to submit payments online using EZSchoolPay.\n\nAny applications that have not been paid or are pending approval after the quarterly period end date will automatically be denied and cleared from the application queue. Any applications submitted before the new period opens or after the period has closed will automatically be denied.\n\nThe flat rate for student bus passes are:\n\nQuarterly Round Trip: $72\n\nQuarterly One Way: $36\n\nAccepted forms of payment include:\n\nAny replacement passes require a $5 fee to the school office (cash only)."
