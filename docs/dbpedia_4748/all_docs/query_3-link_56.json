It was born from a belief that responsibly harnessing technology is crucial for delivering and scaling safety in our communities.

The 27 million...\n\nAdvocacy\n\nWhy Hasn’t Your School District Launched a School Bus Stop-Arm Safety Program Yet?\n\nAccording to data from the National Association of State Directors of Pupil Transportation Services (NASDPTS), there are more than 17 million stop-arm violations in the US each year. That means that 17 million times a year, a child is at risk as they step on and off the bus. Modern...\n\nMission\n\nThree Reasons You Should Opt for a School Bus Stop-Arm Safety Program With Full-Fleet Deployment\n\nAt BusPatrol, we believe that every child deserves access to safety technology, not just a percentage. That’s why we are committed to full-fleet deployment and equip entire school bus fleets with our stop-arm enforcement technology.

BusPatrol’s pilot projects reveal even more staggering safety figures. Recent pilots conducted in Virginia, Georgia, Maryland, Ontario, and Québec suggest that school buses are illegally passed by drivers between 1.6 – 3.8 times per bus per day in urban and suburban environments. When assessing the issue in NYS, BusPatrol conducted a one-month study of 10 buses in East Meadow, New York, during which school bus safety cameras recorded 615 stop-arm violations (2.3 violations per bus per day). These findings are three times higher than the total number of tickets issued across all regions in Nassau & Suffolk counties during the entire 2018-2019 school year.\n\nHow do stop-arm enforcement programs change motorist behavior?\n\nBusPatrol outfits fleets with the latest school bus safety technology, including stop-arm cameras, MDVR and storage devices, cloud-managed 360° safety cameras (interior, windshield, rearview and sideload cameras), GPS & telemetry and LTE connectivity. In addition to our industry-leading hardware, our enforcement program is powered by proprietary software and processes. Our experienced safety professionals help coordinate with police, local officials and other safety stakeholders.\n\nWhen a school bus is stopped and its lights and stop-arm are activated, BusPatrol cameras capture incidents involving vehicles illegally passing the bus. Through cloud-computing, data is sent to BusPatrol’s Alertbus platform. Safety experts help prepare evidence packages for law enforcement’s approval.\n\nBusPatrol data demonstrates that 94%-98% of motorists do not receive a second ticket after their first offence. In addition, 95% of ticketed drivers pay their fine after accessing our Driver Education Portal.\n\nThis trend indicates that drivers are responsive to the photo, video, and GPS telemetry evidence presented to them. Offenders can call our toll free 1-800 number to speak to BusPatrol safety agents who offer services in English, Spanish & French. An agent will explain the law and review a video of the stop-arm inciden with the motorist to further their understanding of the law and the dangers that illegal passes pose.\n\nHow are communities improving safety by partnering with BusPatrol?\n\nBusPatrol’s School Bus Safety Programs are changing the driving culture in communities across North America. School bus stop laws are being more thoroughly and effectively enforced with the use of our refined processes and methodology, technology (hardware, software & AI), program managers and safety specialists. The attitudes of drivers are shifting toward caution as our roads become safer for children.\n\nBusPatrol’s solution comes at no cost to municipalities and school districts. Revenue from tickets provide partners with a source of new funding. These revenues are often invested into educating motorists through PSA campaigns, purchasing enhanced safety equipment for school-age children, or as a source of new funding for safety and education initiatives.\n\nWhy is a full-fleet model important when deploying school bus safety tech?\n\nWe are the only company with a singular focus on full-fleet deployment. BusPatrol’s inclusive model prioritizes providing safety benefits for all students over short-term profits for suppliers and hardware vendors. We outfit entire fleets with no capital outlay required from our partners.\n\nTo measure the success of our program and capture the complete data sets required to make informed safety decisions, our technology must be applied consistently across a jurisdiction and all school buses in its fleet.\n\nBusPatrol’s wants to make all roads safer, change driver behavior and provide equitable access to technology.\n\nThe technology required to power our stop-arm program provides all our riders and their parents with additional benefits, such as access to WIFI and emergency bus safety and anti-bullying alerts. Through our exclusive partnerships with industry-leaders, including Samsung, AT&T, FirstNet, Zonar, BusPlanner and Transfinder, all student riders and their families benefit from BusPatrol programs.\n\nHow can my school districts go “beyond enforcement” and modernize its fleet?\n\nBusPatrol’s stop-Arm programs are changing the driving culture in communities across North America. School bus safety laws are being enforced more thoroughly and effectively with the help of our hardware, software, AI and safety specialists. Additionally, driver attitudes are shifting towards caution, making the roads safer for our children.\n\nMoreover, the same technology that powers our buses can also be used as robust data gathering tools to empower school executives and facilitate informed decision making. At no cost, BusPatrol outfits entire fleets with LTE connectivity, GPS and cameras. Our exclusive partnerships with Zonar and BusPlanner allow school districts to benefit from integrated stop-arm, route planning and fleet management data.\n\nIn addition, revenues from the issued tickets are used at the discretion of our partners. BusPatrol’s stop-arm program provides opportunities for municipalities and school districts to fund education and other student safety initiatives."
