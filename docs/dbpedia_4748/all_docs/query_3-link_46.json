        "text": "Flexible solution for small parts and lightweight inventory\n\nThe Kardex Shuttle 250/500 is a flexible solution for storing and retrieving small-sized inventory. With a tray width of 4,050 mm (159.5 in), the Kardex Shuttle 250/500 can handle loads up to 560 kg (1,234.6 lbs) per tray. It’s compact design allows it to adapt to space requirements, offering maximum storage capacity in a minimal footprint with a maximum height of 30 m (98.4 ft). Further, the system easily modifies to a wide range of requirements. For example, for storing goods in temperature controlled units or under clean room conditions.\n\nHighly compact storage for medium loads\n\nThe Kardex Shuttle 700 handles a tray width of 4,050 mm (159.5 in) and loads up to 725 kg (1,598 lbs) per tray. It adjusts to a device height of 20 m (65 ft) allowing a large storage volume. The Kardex Shuttle 700 is ideal for efficiently storing and retrieving heavy tools, components or spare parts. It is extremely flexible with a number of different options that can be easily integrated before or after installation. The units can expand, decrease, modify or adapt in various ways to cater to changing needs including business growth, new applications, or a relocation.\n\nManages heavy duty loads up to 1,000 kg\n\nWith a tray width of 4,050 mm (159.5 in), the Kardex Shuttle 1000 loads up to 1,000 kg (2,204 lbs) per tray. Achieving new load-carrying capacity standards, it's ideal for storing medium-heavy to heavy parts. Using a forklift, stack and store Euro pallets and mesh boxes in specially designed trays. This saves space and makes it possible to find goods faster, helping to lower costs, boost productivity and increase ergonomics. A factory-installed crane can be used to move stored goods easily, decreasing working times and costs.\n\nThe Kardex Shuttle extends over several floor levels and is equipped with up to six access openings on the front and rear of the unit. This makes it possible to work on multiple levels simultaneously. For example, storing inventory and retrieving them at different access points.\n\nTo increase warehouse capacity, the Kardex Shuttle can be installed outside of a building with an additional enclosure. In this case, access to the stored goods is via an opening in the wall created especially for this purpose."
