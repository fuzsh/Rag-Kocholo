        "text": "Since 1987, the Metropolitan Washington Airports Authority (MWAA) has managed Reagan National (DCA) and Dulles International Airports (IAD) as a single system with complementary roles for the two airports. When Congress established MWAA, it entrusted this entity with overseeing the so-called “slot and perimeter rules” that were created in the 1960s to limit the number of flights to and from DCA as well as to designate a perimeter beyond which flights could not travel. These rules were created out of concern for DCA’s limited physical size and capacity and its proximity to noise-sensitive residential areas, as well as to ensure DCA fulfills its intended objective of providing access to the nation’s capital for regional airports and smaller communities within the perimeter. DCA is currently at capacity and at risk of being seriously overburdened should there be changes to the slot and perimeter rules. Moreover, any changes to the slot and perimeter rules threaten to undermine the access of regional airports and their communities to the D.C. area, as well as increase delays, traffic, congestion, noise, and safety concerns.\n\nWe believe that airport authorities – working with local communities and lawmakers – are best placed to make operational decisions at our airports, which will lead to safer, more convenient, and sustainable air travel."
