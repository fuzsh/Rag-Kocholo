Summit Registration will close on October 1.\n\nOn October 14th, we will hold our Annual Business Meeting which will include elections for the Executive Vice President and Secretary positions.\n\nThe business meeting will be followed by a welcome reception which will include the first opportunity to visit with our generous sponsors. Our agenda is starting to shape up and similar to recent years. We plan to be kicking off the summit with our Leadership Panel at 0900 on the 15th. We hope to have discussions around professional standards, weather products, and safety related topics. Closer to the event, we will release our planned agenda.\n\nThe negotiated hotel rate is $159/night plus any applicable taxes and will close on September 13 or once full. Please reserve your room sooner than later to take advantage of this rate. Our location is within walking distances or short ridesharing trips to different restaurants in the immediate area. The hotel offers a first come, first served complimentary shuttle to/from the area theme parks and Disney Springs. That schedule will be published by the hotel and is subject to change by the hotel. Disney Springs is a lively area with multiple food and activities options less than a 10 minute rideshare trip from the hotel should the hotel shuttle schedule not be feasible.\n\nADF Summit and traditional merchandise is available for purchase at our website store. These items take some lead time as they are made to order, so please allow a good amount of time if you would like your products in time for the summit. Shirts with the summit logo will be available for purchase until the end of October. However, do know that we will not have shirts available for purchase at the Summit.\n\nLastly, if this is your first time joining us at a summit, please consider applying for our first timers’ scholarship no later than September 10, 2024. Scholarship awards are two nights hotel stay and waived registration fee. Scholarship applicants should register as normal for the summit and fees will be refunded if you are selected.\n\nWe hope your schedule allows you to join us in Orlando. We are looking forward to seeing old and new faces alike. Be on the lookout for more information as the Summit gets closer.\n\nRegards,\n\nADF Summit Committee\n\nLink to register: https://dispatcher.org/conferences/816-adf-summit-2024\n\nTo Book Hotel: https://www.hilton.com/en/attend-my-event/mcowdes-907-290006ae-8b43-4418-99a3-3ac90f00220b/"
