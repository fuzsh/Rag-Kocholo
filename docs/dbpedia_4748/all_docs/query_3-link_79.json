        "text": "With over 22 years of experience, CorporateShuttle.com by Busbank has provided ground transportation solutions to organizations big and small, moving employees from public locations to their places of work. With an extensive selection of vehicles, proven transportation and logistics experience, and premium features you are unlikely to find anywhere else, CorporateShuttle is your go-to transportation solution.\n\nPerhaps the most obvious benefits of employee shuttle services are that employees can avoid the hassle of fighting traffic and looking for parking, something that’s always been a difficulty in large metropolitan areas. Employers will save money on parking costs, and, if company cars are in use, savings on gas and car maintenance is an added perk.\n\nShuttle services can also help employees be more productive, as they will have less time wasted commuting to and from work. And beyond convenience, shuttle services also provide a social environment for employees, helping to create a sense of community within the workplace. An added advantage that’s fantastic for overall team morale.\n\nFor employees who live in cities and municipalities, using public transportation can be a frustrating experience. Public transit is often unreliable, expensive, and a risk to people’s general health.\n\nAlternatively, employee shuttle services offer a convenient, reliable, and affordable alternative to public transportation. They offer direct service to the workplace, which eliminates the need to transfer between buses or trains. And, instead, offer multiple pickup and drop-off points, which makes them a sight more convenient than public transportation.\n\nWhether it be a motorcoach, passenger minibus, charter bus, or shuttle bus, employee shuttle services are a great transportation solution for a wide range of different applications. And with custom route options and detailed scheduling, shuttle services for companies are perfect for corporate groups, event planners, and anyone else looking for a reliable way to get around.\n\nBy providing employees with a convenient way to get to and from work, commuter shuttle services can help employees avoid traffic congestion and the stress associated with rush hour. In addition, the shuttle service can provide employees with a comfortable, climate-controlled environment in which to relax during their commute.\n\nCouple this with Wi-Fi, power outlets, reclining seats, and on-board entertainment options, and your team will arrive at work relaxed and rested. The perfect start to a productive day at the office or workplace.\n\nWe take the responsibility of keeping our vehicles both clean and sanitized seriously. That’s why after each trip, all our vehicles’ high-touch areas undergo deep cleaning, sanitation, and disinfection. This includes great attention being paid to handrails, seat handles, bathrooms, and any other frequently touched surfaces within the coach.\n\nAlongside vehicle sanitation practices, capacity and seating configuration that conform to the CDC’s guidelines are used. To maintain these standards and limit overcrowding, seating arrangements are used to allow a minimum of 6-foot social distance, vehicles only carry 25-50% capacities, and predetermined entry and exit points are assigned to limit close contact between passengers.\n\nWith many office-based positions temporarily being moved to a WFH setting, one of the silver linings of the pandemic has been the reduction of emissions and improvements of air quality. To keep this trend going, employee shuttle service can help reduce the number of single occupancy vehicles on the road, significantly reducing emissions and making our cities cleaner and more livable."
