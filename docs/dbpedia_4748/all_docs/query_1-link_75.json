        "text": "Career Opportunities\n\nAn aviation student with a bachelor of science in flight operations is prepared to enter almost any entry-level position within flight management and flight operations within the aviation industry. Other graduates have gone on to serve our country in the various branches of the military, coast guard, and law enforcement agencies.\n\nUniversity of Dubuque flight operations students have gone on to work as flight instructors or pilots for charter operators, airlines, and small and large corporate aviation departments. Students may also qualify for many of the partnerships UD has created with ExpressJet, Endeavor to Delta, Cape Air, Envoy Airlines, SkyWest, and GoJet Airlines. These programs give students an opportunity to qualify as first officers with these airlines.\n\nProgram alumni may request a transcript review by completing the Restricted ATP Request Form. Send the completed document to the head of the Department of Aviation. Contact the Department of Aviation for appropriate contact information.\n\nPost-Graduate Opportunities\n\nThe University of Dubuque aviation program provides the educational and experiential base for entry-level management and flight professions and as a foundation to build a career through graduate-level study in the aviation industry. The Department of Aviation encourages all of our graduates to strive for higher levels of experience and education to advance their capacity to enhance the quality of their education and experience in serving the aviation industry. Most of our graduates have completed advanced level training in flight operations, and, for some, this has included pursuing post-graduate degrees.\n\nThe University of Dubuque offers four independent aviation groups and organizations on campus that offer networking and career-building experiences both inside and outside Dubuque.\n\nAlpha Eta Rho Upsilon Delta Chapter (AHP-UD)\n\nAlpha Eta Rho, a professional aviation fraternity, is a nonprofit organization that operates internationally. As Alpha Eta Rho members, students participate in service projects, especially those that have to do with aviation and work to further the aviation industry's cause.\n\nAs active members, students have the opportunity to attend the national conference where they can network with potential employers and fellow aviation students from across the country. Members network, compare stories, and enjoy fellowship with a great group of people with the same interests and goals.\n\nAlpha Eta Rho shares a close bond with those in the fraternity and is always looking for dedicated, energetic female and male members.\n\nWomen in Aviation International (WAI)\n\nThe University of Dubuque Chapter of Women in Aviation International is an organization that focuses primarily on networking, career advancement, and community outreach and service. Women in Aviation is open to both men and women. The students and Chapter Advisor Polly Kadolph, an associate professor of aviation, attend the International Women in Aviation Conference each year. Students are required to make business cards and have an updated resume to attend the conference with the chapter. These tools are useful throughout the event, as students can meet with many different vendors and companies including Airbus, United Airlines, American Airlines, Southwest Airlines, Lufthansa, military branches, and other universities.\n\nThis organization not only works towards career advancements but also has a high focus on community outreach. Members are asked to log community service hours and, as a group, are often involved in nonprofit or fundraising events. One event that Women in Aviation has taken part in is the Girls in Aviation Day held at the Babka Aviation Learning Center. The organization hosted girls from the surrounding area to learn about flight and aviation through fun activities and hands-on experiences.\n\nOne of the advantages of being a member of Women in Aviation is that it does not end after graduation. The members of this organization are diverse - something that makes WAI so unique. With different backgrounds and positions, the opportunity to learn from those in the profession and their experiences is networking at its finest. Not only are members able to offer each other advice, teach and learn from each other, and work together to better the industry, they also are able to encourage and inspire future aviators.\n\nUniversity of Dubuque Flight Team\n\nThe University of Dubuque Flight Team is a great way to connect with your fellow flight students on campus. The UD Flight Team has an opportunity to compete in two competitions per academic year: regional and national. Upon success at the regional level in the fall, the UD Flight Team would be invited to the national competition in the spring. The UD Flight Team competes in various events including power-off and short-field landings, aircraft recognition, message drop, navigation, SCAN, Ground Trainer (simulator), and E6B computer accuracy competitions.\n\nIn addition to competitions, the UD Flight Team focuses on community outreach. One way this is done is through the annual fly-in pancake breakfast held at the Dubuque Regional Airport. In addition to attendants from the Dubuque community, visitors have come from Iowa, Illinois, Wisconsin, and even Canada. The visiting aircraft are parked and displayed on the UD ramp, and a UD C172 is on display inside the hangar. Young kids, aspiring future aviators, and anyone interested are free to walk around, ask questions, and take pictures. This is a fun event for members of the UD Flight Team to share their passion for aviation and for community members get an inside look at what is flying over their homes.\n\nThe UD Flight Team is always looking for enthusiastic and dedicated teammates. Tryouts are held each fall for prospective members.\n\nAmerican Association of Airport Executives (AAAE)\n\nThe American Association of Airport Executives (AAAE) is a national organization that fosters airport executives and acts as a prevailing voice in Washington, DC, for US airports. The organization works to teach and educate present and future professionals to understand further what it takes to run an airport in the US and how to develop and become a leader in the airport industry.\n\nAAAE has student chapters across the country, and UD has the unique opportunity to be the home of one of these chapters. Students are encouraged to become members of AAAE and to participate on many different levels and platforms. Becoming an AAAE member allows an individual to become a certified member and eventually an accredited airport executive. AAAE also offers seminars, webinars, and conferences year-round pertinent to the greatest ideals affecting airports today. It gives members access to the member directory, a vital form of networking information. Members can also apply for various scholarships offered by AAAE throughout the year. Even more so, members have access to the AAAE career page where airports and private companies are continually posting career opportunities. Becoming a member also subscribes an individual to the AAAE magazine."
