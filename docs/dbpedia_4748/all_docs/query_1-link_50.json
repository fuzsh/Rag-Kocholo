        "text": "May 2024 Reporting Points\n\nRogers to Retire on July 1, 2024 Wow! The headline even surprises me. I’ve had the pleasure and honor to serve as executive director for the Salina Airport Authority since January 1985. Over the years 61 of Salina’s best civic and business leaders have served on the Airport Authority board of directors. Those men and women have inspired me to achieve the Airport Authority’s funding goal to “replace jobs and payroll lost” with the closure of the former Schilling Air Force Base in 1965. Since base closure the Airport Authority’s vision and mission has matured to “chart the course for global success and be a trusted leader propelling economic growth for aerospace business, industry, and military by strengthening partnerships.” Forward thinking board members have provided the guidance and resources for success. I’m grateful for their trust and confidence in me over the years.\n\nRead More\n\n1 Vision Aviation Salina Leases Hangar H626\n\nHangar H626 at the Salina Regional Airport has been leased to 1 Vision Aviation, marking the beginning of a partnership with Garmin International.
