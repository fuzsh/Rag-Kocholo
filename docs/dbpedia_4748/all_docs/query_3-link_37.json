While we hope someday to expand this service to passengers, for now, it is limited to SFO workers with a valid Airport security badge or an employee badge.\n\nIf you work at SFO and would like to know more about the employee shuttle, visit sfoconnect.com/gosfo-shuttle for route and schedule information."
