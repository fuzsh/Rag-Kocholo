        "text": "1. Introduction\n\nAlthough it has become a cliché to describe events during the covid-19 pandemic as “unprecedented”, the term may aptly be applied to the collapse in traffic realized by airlines and the resultant loss in revenues. U.S. airlines experienced an expected loss of $35 Billion in 2020,1 while worldwide airlines were expected to lose $157 Billion.2 According to estimates from the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA),3 total passenger enplanements across all the 446 commercial service airports in the U.S. dropped by more than 60% from 935 million in 2019 to 368 million in 2020. The decline in passenger demand caused airlines to discount airline tickets. On U.S. domestic routes, average airfares fell by more than 18% from $359 in 2019 to $292 in 2020, the lowest level since 1995 after adjusting for inflation.4\n\nTo improve their cash positions, airlines engaged in strategies to reduce costs and increase cash flow. To reduce costs, airlines grounded aircraft, retired older fleets, lobbied governments for tax relief and labor subsidies, laid off staff and provided employees with incentives for early retirements. To generate cash, airlines repositioned aircraft from business-oriented routes to (the less impacted) leisure routes, cut prices, converted aircraft to cargo operations, offered promotional deals including complementary covid-19 travel insurance, and lobbied governments for loans, equity investments, and direct aid (Adrienne et al., 2020, Albers and Rundshagen, 2020, Bombelli, 2020, Czerny et al., 2021; Wenzel et al., 2020; Tay et al., 2020). In addition, airlines sought to generate demand by reassuring passengers of increased safety-related procedures; for example, by changing boarding processes (e.g., boarding from back to front of aircraft), improving the cleaning regimen between flights, mandating facemasks, and leaving the middle seats open to increase social distances (Barnett and Fleming, 2020, Dube et al., 2021, Li, 2020, Milne et al., 2021). Moreover, when the covid-19 vaccine became available, many airlines required staff to be vaccinated and proof of vaccine to be provided by the traveling public.5\n\nDid the pandemic-induced strategies work? For this paper, we use U.S. data to assess the impact of the strategies on airline performance. We review several of the pandemic strategies at the airline level and then examine the middle seat blocking strategy at the more micro, route level. Blocking middle seats may decrease passenger load factors but should be offset by higher yields. If both load factors and yields fall for the airlines with middle seats blocked, this would be an indication that the strategy is not successful from the financial consideration. However, if the higher yields produce sufficient revenues to offset the lower load factors, then the strategy may be considered successful.\n\nIn conducting this research, we make use of the differences in strategies undertaken by U.S. airlines. Most notably, airlines exhibited considerable variation in their middle-seat blocking strategies. Delta Air Lines made the greatest use of this strategy, blocking middle seats from April 2020 to April 2021, when it finally rescinded the policy. On the other hand, United Airlines never implemented the policy, while American Airlines implemented the policy for a shorter period, from April 2020 through June 2020. We examine how the middle-seat blocking policy may have benefited or cost Delta, along with the other U.S. airlines that engaged in this strategy.\n\nOur major results show that the middle seat blocking strategy did lead to lower load factors, with a decrease of about 4.75 percentage points when middle seats were blocked (although, if the blocked middle seats are excluded from the seat total, the “effective load factor” actually increased by 12.28 percentage points). The middle seat blocking strategy also did not contribute to higher yields suggesting that the strategy may not have been effective at getting passengers to pay extra for the safety associated with the blocked middle seat. Yields were lower by $0.026 per revenue-passenger mile when the middle seats were blocked. Finally, airlines blocking middle seats operated routes with higher seat shares of about 2.1% and higher passenger shares of 7.93%.\n\nBased on a mean plane size of 168 seats, a mean load factor of 53%, a mean yield of $0.12/revenue-passenger mile, and a mean route distance of 1,119 miles, the blocking of the middle seat on average resulted in decreased revenues of about $3,300 per flight.6 Although the middle seat-blocking strategy may have conferred longer-term benefits to airlines, such as the perception of better safety or quality, in the short run, the strategy appears to have resulted in revenue losses. Therefore, it is not surprising that some airlines never instituted the policy, while others quickly rescinded the policy after implementation.7\n\nThis paper contributes to the growing literature on how the covid-19 pandemic impacted airline operations. Prior research describes how the pandemic has negatively affected the airline industry through decreased demand and lower revenues (e.g., Czerny et al., 2021, Iacus et al., 2020, Suau-Sancheza et al., 2020, Tay et al., 2020), led to various “pivot” strategies undertaken by the airlines to respond to the pandemic (Adrienne et al., 2020, Amankwah-Amoah, 2020, Bauer et al., 2020, Czerny et al., 2021), and resulted in measures undertaken by the airlines to reassure passengers and increase the safety of operations (Barnett and Fleming, 2020, Dube et al., 2021, Milne et al., 2021, Bielecki et al., 2021). Moreover, Hyman and Savage, 2021, Hyman and Savage, 2022 have examined the impact of the middle seat blocking strategy used by Delta Air Lines and Li (2020) has undertaken a SWOT (strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats) analysis of the middle seat blocking strategy. We add to this literature by demonstrating the variations in strategies undertaken by U.S. carriers in response to the covid-19 pandemic, and then by using a wide sample of routes and carriers to analyze the impact on carrier operations of the blocking of middle seats.\n\nThe rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 reviews the aviation-related pandemic literature. Section 3 presents an industry-level descriptive analysis of U.S. airline operations during the pandemic period. Section 4 describes our econometric model and the data used to assess the performance impact of the middle-seat blocking strategy. Section 5 presents our results. We conclude with a discussion of our results, the limitations of this research and suggestions for future research projects.\n\n3. Airline pandemic strategies\n\nIn this section, we analyze the operational strategies of the four largest U.S. airlines, American, Delta, United and Southwest, describing how they adapted during the first year (2020) of the covid-19 pandemic. The strategies undertaken by the airlines varied considerably. While all four airlines dramatically reduced their flight operations after the onset of the pandemic to save operating expenses, our analysis shows that their pre-pandemic strategies and route network structures influenced their operational responses to the pandemic.\n\nAs shown in , Southwest was the largest airline in the U.S. by passenger enplanements in 2019. However, as opposed to the other three airlines, it had a greater focus on domestic routes, with international traffic accounting for only 3% of its total passenger traffic. In comparison, the share of international traffic ranged from 16% to 25% for the other three airlines. The focus on domestic markets, with fewer international destinations, made Southwest less vulnerable to the closing of international markets during the pandemic since it was less reliant on international traffic to feed its domestic routes. As a result, Southwest was in a better position to maintain its domestic route structure following the onset of the pandemic, compared to American, United and Delta.\n\nTable 1\n\nAirline (Rank)Total Pax.

Traffic1,052.8811.5\n\n(77.1%)241.3\n\n(22.9%)\n\ncompares the number of origin-and-destination (O&D) routes offered by the four airlines in 2020 to the corresponding quarter in 2019. The figure shows that Southwest was the least aggressive of the four airlines in cutting routes during the pandemic, maintaining over 70% of its route total during the lowest point for airlines during the pandemic – the second quarter of 2020. The other three airlines reduced their route offerings by 60–65%, thus retaining only about half the routes (in percentage terms) as Southwest. Although the three network carriers all brought back routes during the third and fourth quarters of 2020, a gap in routes offered (compared to 2019) between Southwest and the three network carriers remained throughout the year.\n\nThe network structure of Southwest is distinct from the structures of the other three airlines, with a higher value for network density of 0.159, compared to 0.030 for American Airlines, 0.029 for United, and 0.024 for Delta Air Lines. Network density is defined as the ratio of the number of non-stop flight segments relative to all potential origin-and-destination connections within an airline’s route network.11 Therefore, an airline that operates a hub-and-spoke system has a lower density measure, since most passengers only have indirect connections through the hub, while an airline that operates a point-to-point network has a higher density measure, since the network offers a greater percent of nonstop origin-and-destination flights. Compared to a hub-and-spoke route structure, a point-to-point route structure could give an airline more flexibility to withdraw from routes or add new destinations with less disruption to the rest of the route network.12\n\nAs noted by Gary Kelly, the CEO of Southwest, the ability of Southwest to rapidly add vacation destinations to target leisure travelers during the pandemic enabled the airline to turn the pandemic crisis into an opportunity to outcompete its rivals.13 After cutting its domestic routes from 1,404 in the second quarter of 2020 to 1,094 in the third quarter of 2020, Southwest quickly reversed this trend, adding 204 new routes into its network in the fourth quarter of the year, flying to several new destinations in Florida, Colorado, California, and Georgia that appealed primarily to vacation travelers.\n\nAnother factor that could impact the ability of an airline to maintain its network is its relationship with regional carriers since regional carriers provide traffic feed for network carriers, such as American, Delta and United. Of the three network airlines, Delta reported about 15% of its passenger revenue was derived from traffic feed provided by its regional carriers under capacity purchasing agreements in 2019.14 In comparison, United Airlines reported about 11% of its capacity was operated by regional carriers that year, while American Airline reported that about 27% of its passenger enplanements were provided by its regional affiliates (owned or contracted) in 2019.\n\nThe relatively high use by American Airlines of regional carriers may have helped it maintain its network during the pandemic, since the regional services can be operated with fewer passengers. Network carriers, such as American, Delta and United, may act to maintain the centralized structure of their hub-and-spoke networks to run feed through their hubs. As shown in , the average degree of centrality15 across all the airports in American’s domestic route network dropped by only 0.43% (from 0.257 to 0.256), while it dropped by 11.29% for United (from 0.261 to 0.232), by 8.77% for Delta (from 0.232 to 0.211), and by 6% for Southwest (from 0.378 to 0.356) in the 2nd quarter of 2020, as compared to the same quarter of 2019. Similarly, shows that the average degree of closeness centrality for American Airlines across all the airports in its domestic route network remained almost unchanged (i.e., 0.57735 vs. 0.57744) in the 2nd quarter of 2020, as compared to the same quarter of 2019, while the average degree of closeness centrality decreased by 3.62% for United (from 0.575 to 0.554), by 2.48% for Delta (from 0.561 to 0.547), and by 2.34% for Southwest (from 0.617 to 0.603).\n\nAmerican’s ability to rely on its regional carriers may have also allowed the airline to limit its capacity and route reduction after the onset of the pandemic. To save operating expenses, all four airlines substantially reduced their flight operations during the pandemic. United Airlines cut its flights on domestic routes by 54.4% in 2020 relative to 2019 and Delta by 44.3%. However, American only reduced its flights by 42.4%, and Southwest’s reduction of 33.6% was even lower. Seat capacity reductions were of similar magnitudes – 54.4% by United, 44.2% by Delta, 41.5% by American, and 32.6% by Southwest.\n\nAs shown in , , all the four major carriers started trimming their domestic flight operations in March 2020, with the greatest reductions in May 2020. Compared to United and Delta, American made a smaller reduction in flight and seat capacity, especially during the worst months of the pandemic. As shown in , in May 2020, American Airlines kept 49% of its flights compared to the same month in 2019 compared to 41% for Delta Air Lines and only 22% for United Airlines. Similar findings based on seat capacity are illustrated in .\n\nIn addition to downsizing operation capacity to adjust for falling passenger demand, airlines also used a variety of measures to enhance safety standards. Notable among these strategies was the blocking of middle seats to increase social distancing among passengers. Delta began blocking middle seats in April 2020 and kept the policy for the remainder of the year (only rescinding the policy in May 2021). American blocked middle seats only during the 2nd quarter of 2020, Southwest blocked middle seats from May 2020 until November 2020 while United never blocked middle seats, booking them throughout the pandemic.\n\nSummarizing its commitment to both safety and financial measures during the pandemic, Edward Bastian, the CEO of Delta Air Lines, stated the following: “Our response has been focused on three priorities. First, protecting the health and the safety of our employees and our customers. Second, preserving our financial liquidity to work through this crisis. And third, ensuring we are well-positioned to recover once the virus is contained and building a plan to accelerate our progress through this period of recovery.”16 .\n\nAlthough the decision to block middle seats may have been primarily driven by safety concerns, the financial implications of middle seat blocking varied among airlines depending on their fleet composition. Importantly, the mix of narrow-body, wide-body and regional jets impact the percentage of middle seats in the total seat capacity of a fleet. For example, the fleet of Southwest consists of B737-700, B737-800, and B737-Max 800 aircraft,17 and middle seats account for more than 32% of the aircraft seat capacity across all three aircraft types. In contrast, the fleet of Delta Air Lines consists of 22 aircraft types with only 5 operating in domestic markets having middle seats.18 As a result, middle seats account for only 30% of Delta’s aircraft seat capacity. Therefore, middle seat blocking may have a lower impact on Delta compared to Southwest.\n\n, , show how daily flight frequencies on domestic routes evolved for the four major airlines between 2019 and 2020. As shown in , average daily flight frequencies per route were higher for American and Delta than for Southwest and United in 2019, prior to the pandemic. shows that all four airlines cut their frequencies significantly beginning March 2020. By April 2020, frequencies had been reduced by their maximum compared to the corresponding month in 2019. 73.1% by United; 62.9% by American; 61.4% by Delta and 56.9% by Southwest. indicates that the frequency reduction pattern varied by airline. In general, Delta and Southwest cut frequencies by the least amount, while United cut frequencies by the greatest amount.\n\ncompares the four major airlines in terms of the change in average aircraft size on their domestic flight segments between 2019 and 2020. In contrast to the other three airlines, Southwest operated with larger aircraft in 2020 (compared to 2019) in each of the 2nd, 3rd, and 4th quarters of the year. United Airlines downsized its average aircraft size in each of these quarters, while Delta Airlines downsized its average aircraft size in the 2nd quarter but increased average aircraft size in the 4th quarter. Finally, American held its aircraft size fairly steady in the 2nd and 3rd quarters, before increasing its aircraft size in the 4th quarter.\n\nThe strategies undertaken by the carriers, including capacity adjustments, fleet size adjustments and safety strategies such as the blocking of middle seats, likely affected performance outcomes. shows that yields dropped for all airlines in 2020 compared to the pre-pandemic year, 2019. Yields in the industry may have declined for several reasons, notably due to a drop in demand as potential passengers stayed home due to personal choice and to government lockdown restrictions, and to the relatively larger decline in higher-yield business travelers compared to lower-yield leisure travelers. However, shows that the decline in yields was not uniform across the four largest U.S. carriers. Yields dropped the most for American Airlines, which only blocked middle seats during the second quarter of 2020. During the last quarter of 2020, United experienced the second greatest drop in yields, while yields fell the least for Delta, providing some indication that the middle seat strategy may have been successful at stemming the decline in yields in agreement with Hyman and Savage, 2021, Hyman and Savage, 2022.\n\ncompares the load factors of the three airlines in 2020 relative to 2019. It can be seen that prior to the onset of the pandemic in the U.S. in March 2020, the four major carriers were filling about the same percentage of seats as in 2019. The onset of the pandemic reduced load factors, initially, for all four airlines by about 70%. The airlines responded by reducing capacity, thus increasing their load factors. The figure shows that during the latter half of 2020, load factors were lowest for Delta, reflecting, perhaps, its decision to keep middle seats open and highest for American and United, both of which did not block middle seats during the latter half of 2020. Southwest continued blocking middle seats until November, when it rescinded this policy and saw an uptick in its load factor, approaching the load factors of United and American.\n\nIn summary, the airlines adopted very different strategies to compete during the pandemic. Delta kept higher yields by allowing for lower load factors than its competitors, Southwest was aggressive at reconfiguring its routes, while American and United tolerated lower yields while keeping load factors higher. In the next section, we examine how performance outcomes may be more closely tied to the blocking of middles seats during the pandemic.\n\n4. Models and data\n\n4.1. Middle seat blocking profiles\n\nIn this section, we analyze at the airline-route level, the impact on airline performance of the middle seat blocking strategy. shows the airlines included in our dataset and the periods of time in which they pursued middle seat blocking strategies. According to the Bureau of Transportation Statistics, by including the top ten airlines by revenue-passenger miles (RPMs), our dataset describes over 90 percent of the available seat miles (ASMs) in the US domestic market.19\n\nTable 2\n\nAirline\n\nCodeAirline\n\nNameJan\n\n(Q5)Feb\n\n(Q5)Mar\n\n(Q5)Apr\n\n(Q6)May\n\n(Q6)Jun\n\n(Q6)Jul\n\n(Q7)Aug\n\n(Q7)Sep\n\n(Q7)Oct\n\n(Q8)Nov\n\n(Q8)Dec\n\n(Q8)AAAmerican Airlines000111000000DLDelta Air Lines000111111111UAUnited Airlines000000000000ASAlaska Airlines000011111111B6JetBlue Airways000011111110F9Frontier Airlines000010000000G4Allegiant Air000000000000HAHawaiian Airline000011111110NKSpirit Airlines000000000000WNSouthwest Airlines000011111110\n\nIn examining the three major network carriers in the U.S. domestic market (American, Delta and United), strong variations in the use of middle seat blocking are evident, as shown in . United never blocked middle seats, American only blocked middle seats during the first wave of the pandemic (April 2020 to June 2020), while Delta initially blocked middle seats during the first pandemic wave and then continued with this strategy throughout the year. Variations in middle seat blocking strategies also appear among the other seven carriers in the dataset. Notably, three airlines. JetBlue, Hawaiian and Southwest, blocked middle seats from May to November 2020, while Alaska continued middle seat blocking to December 2020. At the other end of the spectrum, Spirit and Allegiant joined United in never blocking middle seats, while Frontier blocked middle seats in only one month, May 2020.\n\n4.2. Data Source\n\nWe collected 2019 and 2020 monthly segment-level operating data for the ten airlines’ domestic routes from the U.S. Department of Transportation (DOT) T-100 reports, and quarterly origin and destination (O&D) airfare, itinerary and passenger data from U.S. DOT DB1B reports. Both the T-100 and DB1B reports are retrieved from the Cirium Diio Mi Market Intelligence data portal. In total, we gathered 313,492 observations from the T-100 dataset. After excluding carrier routes with<16 flights per month, we were left with 234,578 observations across 5,042 airport directional pairs.\n\nThe quarterly airfare dataset (DB1B) is larger, containing 1,624,120 itinerary-level observations for the ten airlines across 12,340 origin and destination (O&D) markets (with a minimum of 10 passengers per day). These itineraries include non-stop (5%), one-stop (54%) and two-stop (41%) connections.20 The DB1B dataset is used to access passenger fare data. Fares are presented in the dataset net of applicable federal taxes and fees, such as security and passenger facility charges.21 To convert fares into yields, fares are divided by route distance. The distance used for these calculations is the great circle distance between the O&D airports.\n\nWe include in our model a social distancing index to control for decreases in mobility due to the spread of covid-19. The index is compiled by the University of Maryland Transportation Institute at the state level, based on several factors, such as percent of people staying at home, the percent of individuals traveling to work, and the number of reported covid cases.22 For each of our sample airlines, we also collect aircraft seat layout data primarily from seatguru.com, supplemented by the airlines’ own fleet information webpages. For those aircraft models that have multiple layout designs, we use the number of seats per flight departure of an airline on a given route as a reference and select the layout design that provides the seat capacity closest to the reference.\n\n4.3. Variables\n\nprovides a description of variables in our models. We estimate our models with five dependent variables: passenger share, load factor, effective load factor, seat share, and yield. Passenger shares are computed using T-100 flight segment data for each carrier-specific route. Shares are based on the percentage of passengers carried during a period on a route by a specific carrier to the total number of passengers on the route during the time period. Load factors are computed for each carrier-specific route as passengers divided by seats on the route during the period. Seat shares are computed using the same data, based on seats offered by a carrier during a period on a route. In addition to computing the load factor for airline i on route j a given month, we also calculate the “effective load factor” after excluding the number of middle seats that are blocked by an airline in a period. Similarly, we develop “effective seat share” as a modified seat share measure. Given that passengers can use several itineraries to fly an O&D route, we calculate O&D yield based on the shares of the various itineraries for a route. Specifically, for airline i on route j in quarter t, we develop the variable Yieldijt based on the airline’s itinerary-specific yield and the share of daily passenger numbers on itinerary m for airline i on route j in quarter t:\n\nYieldijt=∑m=1NShareofPassengersperdaybyItinearymijt×Yieldijmt\n\nTable 3\n\nVariableDescriptionPAXSHRThe passenger share of each airline i on route j at time tLOADFACTORThe average (absolute) load factor of each airline i on route j at time tEFFLOADFACTORThe average (effective) load factor of each airline i on route j at time tSEATSHRThe seat share of each airline i on route j at time tYIELDThe average fare per mile flown by each airline i on route j at time t (US dollars/mile)MSBA dummy variable equal to 1 if airline i applies middle seat blocking in period t (see )RESROUTEA dummy variable equal to 1 if airline i operates route j in the same period t of 2019 and 2020SDIThe product of the endpoints state-based social distancing indexTOTCOMPThe number of competitors at the city pair levelLCCA dummy variable equal to 1 if the airline i is a Low-Cost CarrierDISTAverage route distance (miles)SUNBELTA dummy variable equal to 1 if one or both the endpoints are southern belt statesPOPProduct of the two endpoints’ population (trillion)INCProduct of the two endpoints’ income per capita (US dollars - million)FREQThe monthly frequency of operations of airline i on route j at time tFLEETMIXThe number of different aircraft types employed by airline i at time tAIRCRAFTSIZEThe average number of seats offered by airline i at time tTOTROUTEThe total number of routes operated by airline i at time tONESTOPThe percentage of passengers flying one-stop on route j at time tTWOSTOPThe percentage of passengers flying two-stop on route j at time tEFFSEATSHRThe (effective) seat share of each airline i on route j at time tCENTRALITY19The maximum centrality at the endpoint airports of route j for airline i at time t in 2019MIDDLESEATSHR19The percentage of middle seats in the number of seats of airline i on route j at time t in 2019\n\nWe also compute two measures that will be used in first-stage equations in our model, estimated to address potential econometric concerns (see Section 4.5). First, to measure the importance of origin and destination airports for an airline in terms of the connectivity in the airline’s route network, we calculate an airport-specific network metric in period t, and then take the maximum of the network metric between the two endpoint airports on a given route j. The closeness centrality index is calculated as follows:\n\nClosenessCentralityivt=Nit-1∑w=1Nit-1Svwt\n\nwhere Svwt represents the length of the shortest paths from airport v to w in airline i’s domestic route network in period t and Nit represents the number of airports in airline i’s domestic route network in period t. The length of the shortest paths indicates the minimum number of connections needed for traveling from airport v to w, based on airline i’s domestic route network in period t. The shorter the length, the greater the value of closeness centrality. This network metric has been applied in recent aviation research (e.g., Malighetti et al., 2019, Cheung et al., 2020, Sun et al., 2020, Reynolds-Feighan et al., 2022). We select this variable and incorporate its 2019 values into the estimation of an airline’s resilient route selection (i.e., routes maintained in both 2019 and 2020) during the pandemic. Second, we compute the percentage of middle seats to the total number of seats provided by airline i on route j in period t. We incorporate values for 2019 to estimate the likelihood of an airline blocking a middle seat in a given period. The variable is computed as follows:\n\nMiddleSeatShareijt=NumberofMiddleSeatsijtTotalNumberofSeatsijt\n\n4.4. Models\n\nTo examine the impact of the middle seat blocking strategy, we use data from 2019 (pre-pandemic period) and 2020 (pandemic period, beginning March 2020) to estimate our models. The data are at the airline-route-month level or at the airline-route-quarter level, depending on the model employed. We define a route as the directional combination of a departing airport O and an arrival airport D (i.e., A-B is a different route from B-A). Dependent variables include airline passenger share, load factor (absolute and effective), seat share, and yield. An effective middle seat blocking strategy can be expected to attract passengers because of higher perceived travel safety, and to lead to higher yields, while, potentially, depressing load factors. Moreover, the strategy could cause airlines to adjust the number of seats offered on a route.\n\nFrom the T-100 and DB1B data sources, two datasets are constructed. In each case, we confine our dataset to competitive routes, where airlines adopting the middle seat blocking strategy were competing with airlines that did not use this strategy. Monopolistic routes and routes where all airlines were blocking middle seats, or all airlines were not blocking middle seats are excluded from the datasets. This leaves the T-100 dataset and the DB1B dataset with 730 and 946 directional route pairs, respectively.\n\nWe present the results of the five models in in Section 5. As robustness checks, we estimate several alternate econometric specifications. First, we run the five models without including airline fixed effects. These estimations allow us to compare our results with references in the existing literature (Hyman and Savage, 2021, Hyman and Savage, 2022). Second, we add route-time fixed effects to our main specification, hence adding an extra level of fixed effects and capturing the time variant characteristics of a given route. Results from these estimations are reported in and in the Appendix. Third, we run our models based on year-over-year changes to the dependent variables (from 2019 to 2020).23 Finally, we restrict our analysis to Delta Air Lines’ middle seat blocking strategy and estimate our yield equation using the subset of data focusing on those routes where Delta Air Lines competed with the other two legacy airlines, that is, American Airlines and United Airlines. As with Hyman and Savage, 2021, Hyman and Savage, 2022 we find that blocking middle seats has a positive effect on yields, when examining this restricted database. This last result is reported in in the Appendix.\n\nTable 5\n\n(1)(2)(3)(4)(5)VariablesPAXSHRLOADFACTOREFFLOADFACTORSEATSHRYIELDMSB7.925***−4.751***12.279***2.098***−0.026***(21.823)(−9.784)(20.141)(4.328)(−6.155)IMR12.668***−3.432*6.965***7.756***−0.170***(2.884)(−1.809)(3.100)(4.402)(−6.162)RESROUTE−1.498***−0.955−2.590***0.4190.113***(−5.755)(−1.499)(−3.689)(0.785)(20.596)IMR2−2.829***−10.638***−13.506***−4.376***−0.082**(−4.235)(−8.208)(−8.912)(−3.264)(−2.575)SDI0.718**−14.856***−17.122***6.773***0.029***(2.415)(−8.682)(−8.803)(6.033)(4.337)TOTCOMP0.445***−0.417−0.218−3.760***−0.003**(5.530)(−0.989)(−0.431)(−11.295)(−2.491)FLEETMIX0.1460.086−0.150−8.712***−0.000(1.456)(0.448)(−0.720)(−21.488)(−1.438)TOTROUTE−0.009***−0.017***−0.007−0.001−0.000***(−4.521)(−4.320)(−1.602)(−0.276)(−7.242)FREQ−0.004−0.017***−0.0070.177***(−1.437)(−3.963)(−1.413)(20.929)AIRCRAFTSIZE−0.000−0.0030.018*0.130***(−0.010)(−0.318)(1.846)(13.121)EFFSEATSHR1.040***(101.207)ONESTOP−0.018***(−4.616)TWOSTOP−0.143*(−1.950)AA7.609***16.820***17.117***−1.175−0.011*(16.337)(19.284)(16.167)(−1.212)(−1.749)AS−1.387**2.1363.856**−12.584***−0.047***(−2.002)(1.616)(2.362)(−8.208)(−10.078)B61.499**7.407***11.880***−7.920***−0.084***(2.005)(5.534)(7.238)(−5.555)(−6.572)F93.426***13.924***9.070***−14.042***−0.179***(4.480)(8.286)(4.319)(−9.815)(−14.833)G41.9989.081**4.681−12.884***−0.167***(1.123)(2.291)(1.135)(−3.913)(−11.463)HA−6.505***−1.700−2.365−9.604***−0.044***(−3.206)(−0.758)(−0.726)(−4.134)(−7.714)NK6.820***22.791***19.447***−10.345***−0.169***(10.448)(16.666)(11.302)(−7.824)(−12.542)UA4.701***8.791***9.641***−3.681***−0.037***(8.710)(7.428)(7.136)(−3.969)(−7.255)WN7.436***10.698***17.728***1.206−0.032***(10.940)(7.171)(10.549)(0.779)(−6.610)Constant−11.767***162.964***162.255***−32.177***0.197***(−4.668)(13.446)(11.682)(−3.872)(2.841)Observations7,1357,1357,1357,1354,554Adj.

(2)), LOADFACTOR equation (Eq. (3)), and SEATSHR equation (Eq. (4)), are generalized in Eq. (1) as follows:\n\nYijt=α0+X1ijt∗α1'+α2∗MSB+ηi+ϑj+ϰt+e\n\n(1)\n\nThe dependent variable, Yijt, is the average monthly passenger share (load factor, seat share) for airline i on route j in period t. The dependent variable is a function of a matrix X1 of exogenous explanatory variables, and of a variable capturing the middle seat blocking strategy of each airline i. α1' is a column vector of coefficients for the exogenous explanatory variables and α2 the coefficient for the MSB dummy variable. Finally, ηi identifies airline fixed effects, ϑj captures airport pair fixed effects, κt month fixed effects, while e is the error term which is assumed to be normally distributed with zero mean and constant variance σe2. The inclusion of airline fixed effects allows us to better identify the middle seat blocking effect as they capture the time invariant characteristics of each carrier. Similarly, airport pair fixed effects are included to control for route unobserved heterogeneity. Finally, month fixed effects are used to eliminate biases from unobservable factors that change over time and not across entities. In this way it is possible to exploit the variations within each carrier, route, and month.\n\nAmong the exogenous explanatory variables, we include regressors for market and airline characteristics such as pandemic intensity measures, sociodemographic data, a city pair-specific measure of competition (TOTCOMP), a dummy variable capturing the business model type of each airline (LCC) and other supply and demand shifters. As an additional regressor in the PAXSHR model, we include the effective share of seats each carrier offered during a period on a given route24 .\n\nThe extended formulations of Eq.

The dependent variable is a function of a matrix X2 of exogenous explanatory variables and of a variable capturing the middle seat blocking strategy for each airline i. β1' is a column vector of coefficients for the exogenous explanatory variables and α2 the coefficient for the MSB dummy variable. The airline fixed effects are identified by λi, while μj captures airport pair fixed effects and ξt refers to quarter fixed effects. Finally, u is the error term that is assumed to be normally distributed with zero mean and constant variance σu2.\n\nAmong the exogenous explanatory variables are regressors identifying market and airline characteristics, including the percentage of passengers on a route flying on a connecting (rather than nonstop) itinerary (ONESTOP, TWOSTOP). The extended formulation of Eq. (4) is reported in Eq.

Econometric concerns\n\nEq. (6) is characterized by possible econometric concerns related to potential endogeneity between TOTCOMP and YIELD (i.e., higher yields may produce a feedback effect attracting more competitors onto a route). However, following Brueckner and Singer (2019) and Brueckner et al. (2013), we do not specifically control for endogeneity for several reasons: First, by explicitly including fixed effects and market characteristics in our model, we already capture much of the unobserved heterogeneity among observations, hence limiting potential bias; second, there is evidence in the literature (i.e., Gayle and Wu (2013)) showing that directly addressing endogeneity of carrier competition via a structural model has little impact on the final estimates; third, the potential endogeneity between TOTCOMP and YIELD is mainly an issue with nonstop routes. In our final sample, 82% of itineraries involve connections; therefore, the feedback effect from passengers to number of competitors may be limited. Finally, in this work we do not attempt to obtain the best linear unbiased estimator (BLUE) for TOTCOMP or use its coefficient to interpret the causal impact on the dependent variable. TOTCOMP only serves as a control variable. Therefore, potential endogeneity between TOTCOMP and our dependent variables will not influence the main results measuring the influence of MSB on the dependent variables. For these reasons, we do not specifically control for the potential endogeneity of TOTCOMP. 25\n\nA second econometric concern is the selection problem for our observations. With the advent of the pandemic, carriers dropped many of their routes. However, the decrease in routes was likely systematic, rather than random. Therefore, we estimate Eq. (7) through a probit regression to generate the Inverse Mills Ratio (IMR1) to correct for route selection bias in Eqs. (2), (3), (4), (6).\n\nRESROUTEijt=φ0+φ1∗CENTRALITY19ijt+φ2∗logSDI+φ3∗logDISTijt+φ4∗TOTCOMPjt+φ5∗SUNBELTj+φ6∗logPOPjt+φ7∗logINCjt+φ8∗TOTROUTEit+νt+z\n\n(7)\n\nIn Eq. (7), RESROUTEijt is a binary outcome variable indicating whether a route is operated by a carrier in both 2019 and 2020. It is estimated as a function of the intensity of the pandemic at the state level, route cost and demand shifters and route market and origin and destination characteristics. Seasonal trends are captured by νt while z is the error term with 0 mean and, for identification purposes, variance σz2 set equal to unity.\n\nIn Eq. (7) we also include the network variable CENTRALITY19 that serves as an instrumental variable to tackle the route selection bias in the main equations. This variable is included in the selection equation, but not in the equations of interest. We believe that an airline is more likely to keep a route if it is important in terms of connectivity for its network. To save operating expenses while minimizing the disruption to overall route network connectivity, an airline is more likely to cut routes involving endpoint airports that have low centrality values. This intuition is indeed supported by the probit results in in the Appendix.\n\nSince the connectivity of a route network is important for passengers (as well as for airlines), the centrality index may also impact passenger share, load factor, seat share, and yield. Given the exclusion restriction (i.e., the instrumental variable should not directly impact the dependent variables), we base our centrality measure on (pre-pandemic) 2019 data.\n\nA third econometric concern rises because the adoption of a middle-seat blocking strategy may be due to self-selection by an airline. Systematic differences between airlines that did or did not adopt the strategy might yield biased measures of the effects of the middle-seat blocking strategy, even after correcting for route selection bias (i.e., due to carrier-specific characteristics). Therefore, we estimate Eq. (8) through a probit regression to generate the Inverse Mills Ratio (IMR2) to correct for airlines’ self-selection bias in Eqs. (2), (3), (4), (6).\n\nWe include the variable MIDDLESEATSHR19 in Eq. (8). It measures the percentage of middle seats to total seats operated by airlines in 2019 (lagged to limit endogeneity concerns), and serves as an instrumental variable to address self-selection bias in the main equations. The percentage of middle seats on an airline’s network may be linked to the likelihood that the airline will adopt a middle-seat blocking strategy. For example, the percentage of middle seats is higher for wide-body aircraft than for narrow-body aircraft; therefore, airlines that operate a high percentage of wide-bodied aircraft may be less likely to block middle seats.26 The lagging of the variable allows us to exclude MIDDLESEATSHR19 from the estimation of the performance variables, passenger share, load factor, seat share, and yield, since passenger choices are based on current, rather than on lagged, seat configurations.\n\nMSBit=ζ0+ζ1∗MIDDLESEATSHR19ijt+ζ2∗logSDIjt+ζ3∗logDISTijt+ζ4∗TOTCOMPjt+ζ5∗SUNBELTj+ζ6∗logPOPjt+ζ7∗logINCjt+ζ8∗TOTROUTEit+τt+ω\n\n(8)\n\nGiven the multi-step estimation procedure leading to our final estimates, standard errors may be underestimated, leading to inflated t-statistics. To adjust for potentially inflated standard errors, we employ a bootstrap procedure with 1,000 replications. Given the nature of our data, we implement the procedure by time blocks, resampling on the airline-route dimension (without resampling months or airline-route-months) to keep the time series properties of the observations (Dresner et al., 2021).27 Moreover, Eqs. (2), (3), (4), (6) are estimated using high dimensional fixed effects regressions. For identification reasons we include route, airline, and time dummies. Finally, standard errors are always clustered at the airline-route level.28\n\n4.6. Descriptive statistics\n\npresents descriptive statistics for the variables in our models. The statistics for our five dependent variables show that, on average, a US carrier averaged about 23% of the market in terms of both seat share and passenger share. Airlines filled about 53% of seats on a route during the time of our dataset. Average load factors were, thus, quite low, during the first year of the covid-19 pandemic.29 Yields averaged $0.12 per revenue-passenger mile. Data from the table indicate that the middle seat was blocked in 48% of our observations, about 91% of our observations are for routes operated both in 2019 and 2020 (the remaining 9% are new routes, introduced in 2020). There was an average of just over three carriers operating a route segment. Airlines employed about two different aircraft types on a route on average and the average aircraft size was 168 seats and the average route distance 1,119 miles.\n\nTable 4\n\nVariableObs.MeanStd. dev.MinMaxPAXSHR7,13522.5415.310.9993.35LOADFACTOR7,13552.9519.292.6394.76EFFLOADFACTOR7,13562.3520.232.9099.96SEATSHR7,13522.5615.222.0690.86YIELD4,5540.120.090.020.71MSB7,1350.480.500.001.00RESROUTE7,1350.910.280.001.00SDI7,1351240.10627.800.004683.50TOTCOMP7,1353.000.922.006.00LCC7,1350.540.500.001.00DIST7,1351118.90608.66153.002918.00SUNBELT7,1350.460.500.001.00POP7,135186.00241.004.001,560.00INC7,1354,040.00946.001,090.006,660.00FLEETMIX7,1351.960.971.0011.00TOTROUTE7,135461.72282.0613.001,004.00FREQ7,13566.6155.3916.001,080.00AIRCRAFTSIZE7,135167.7625.40100.00364.00EFFSEATSHR7,13522.3914.452.0393.58ONESTOP4,5540.110.200.001.00TWOSTOP4,5540.000.010.000.15CENTRALITY197,13565.5411.2628.67100.00MIDDLESEATSHR197,20930.074.910.0045.10\n\n6. Conclusions, implications, limitations and future research\n\nFor this paper, we first provide a general analysis of strategies undertaken by the four largest U.S. airlines and then provide a more detailed analysis on a route-level basis of one of the key safety-related strategies, the blocking of middle seats. Our airline-level analysis shows distinct differences among the largest airlines in terms of their strategies undertaken during the pandemic. In particular, strategic decisions may be closely tied to pre-pandemic operations. Southwest Airlines, notably, without an extensive international route network, was best able to maintain domestic routes during the pandemic. Moreover, American Airlines, with its greater reliance on regional carriers, was able to keep a higher percent of flights and seats in operation during the pandemic compared to its network carrier rivals. The regional carriers were especially suited to operating routes when passenger demand declined early in the pandemic.\n\nThe strategies undertaken by the carriers likely resulted in variations in performance outcomes. Although American Airlines maintained a higher percentage of flights and seats than its rivals, it also had a higher decline in yields during the pandemic, compared to the previous year. Therefore, American’s decision to maintain its capacity may have had a cost, with the higher capacity resulting in lower yields.\n\nOur analysis of the middle seat blocking strategy reveals revenue losses for airlines engaging in this strategy. Although there may be a positive long-term rationale for blocking the seats; for example, enhancing the safety image of an airline, in the short run, we calculated an airline lost over $3,000 per flight due to the blocking of middle seats. Much of the revenue loss can be attributed to lower load factors. With the middle seats blocked, fewer passengers could be accommodated by airlines undertaking a middle seat blocking strategy. To offset at least part of the loss in capacity resulting from the blocking of middle-seats, airlines that instituted this policy also had a greater share of seats on a route. Airlines that blocked middle seat increased flight frequencies or operated with larger aircraft to, at least partially, compensate for the lost capacity. However, this offset was not sufficient to overcome the revenue losses due to the lower load factors.\n\nEven though load factors were significantly lower when blocking the middle seats, effective load factors were higher. This result indicates that airlines blocking middle seats were able to fill a larger percent of available seats. This may be an indication that there were passengers that were attracted to airlines using this strategy. Further evidence of the ability of the strategy to attract passengers is that passenger shares were higher when the strategy was employed, even after controlling for an airline’s capacity on a route (through seat share).\n\nFinally, we find that yields were lower when the middle seat was blocked, contributing to an airline’s revenue loss. This result was related to the inclusion of fixed airline effects in our model. When fixed effects were excluded, the middle seat blocking strategy contributed to higher yields. These mixed findings indicate that the middle seat blocking strategy was related to systematic differences in airline strategies and operations.\n\nThe major implication of this research is that strategy matters. Although some passengers may view airline travel as a commodity and the services offered by airlines to be largely undifferentiated, airlines do attempt to differentiate their services. This was evident with the various strategies undertaken by U.S. carriers during the pandemic, especially with respect to blocking middle seats. The fact that it appeared to be a “losing” strategy may be indicative of the faith passengers put into the other efforts airlines took to increase the safety levels in their aircraft.\n\nA limitation of this paper is in its scope. We examine only the short run implications of blocking middle seats. Clearly some of the airlines that maintained this strategy for several months (e.g., Delta) must have seen some benefits to continuing to block middle seats. We do not assess these spillover effects from the middle seat blocking strategy. Furthermore, we only estimate a dataset for U.S. airlines. Since the viral levels differed across countries and since people’s perception of air safety will vary across cultures, then our results may not be fully generalizable to other aviation markets.\n\nWe believe that there is future work that can be conducted on the blocking of middle seats as well as on other pandemic-related aviation strategies. As noted above, it would be useful to see if our results hold in other markets. Furthermore, other safety-related strategies, including face mask requirements, may contribute to passenger traffic or to yields. Therefore, conducting further analysis of pandemic airline strategies may produce more insights into how airlines can best survive pandemics."
