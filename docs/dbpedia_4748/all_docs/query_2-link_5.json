        "text": "AAM is a new concept of air transportation using electric vertical takeoff and landing (eVTOL) aircraft to move people and cargo between places not currently or easily served by surface transportation or existing aviation modes. EVTOL aircraft may be powered by hybrid electric systems, batteries or potentially hydrogen fuel cells.\n\nSometimes AAM is also called urban air mobility (UAM), although potential applications for this form of transportation could extend beyond high-density urban centers. These aircraft, which will range in size from single-passenger aircraft to large shuttles, will bring accessibility to cities, underserved communities and geographically distant regions.\n\nDevelopment of infrastructure in support of AAM is underway in cities today, with AAM expected to become an increasingly important part of our transportation system in the next several years."
