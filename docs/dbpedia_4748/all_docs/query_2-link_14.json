        "text": "Looking Back at the Evolution of the Mandatory Retirement Rule\n\nThe following is a brief overview of significant events in the evolution of the FAA’s mandatory retirement rule for airline pilots.\n\n1959 - The FAA imposed a mandatory retirement age of 60 for airline pilots.\n\n1960 - The rule became effective on March 15, 1960.\n\n1980 - After 20 years of unsuccessful challenges to the age 60 rule, ALPA’s Board of Directors reversed its position and officially endorsed the age 60 retirement requirement for all flightdeck crewmembers.\n\n2007 - After the International Civil Aviation Organization increased the age to 65 and after years of debate and pressure from some pilot groups that argued that the retirement age of 60 was arbitrary, Congress passed legislation that raised the mandatory retirement age to 65 and included safety mitigations to balance the risk with the increasing age.\n\n2019 - A study contracted by the European Aviation Safety Agency found an increased health risk and a decline in cognitive skills with an increase in age.\n\n2022 - ALPA’s Board of Directors unanimously voted to support the current pilot retirement age of 65."
