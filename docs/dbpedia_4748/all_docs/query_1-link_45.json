Detours will be set on Tobacco road.\n\nThis project may impact airport patrons that access the airport via Doug Barnard Parkway from the south. The main access from I-520 and Tobacco Road will remain unaffected. Please plan your road travel accordingly to give ample time before your flight departure."
