A maximum of 14 bikes are allowed at one time.\n\nCan I bring my dog on the Water Shuttle?\n\nPets -- including comfort animals and emotional support animals -- can only be brought aboard the Water Shuttle if they are within an enclosed pet carrier that can fit on your lap and they do not pose a threat to passengers or crew members.\n\nTrained service animals or service animals in training may be brought aboard provided they remain under the passenger's control and do not pose a threat to passengers or crew members.\n\nFor more information about SF Bay Ferry’s pet policy, please visit: https://sanfranciscobayferry.com/pets.\n\nCan I keep my seat and ride back and forth (round trip)?\n\nAll passengers are required to disembark after each trip. If you wish to immediately return on the next boat, you must exit the boat and get in line. Note that if there are more than 31 people (the maximum number of passengers) already waiting, you will have to wait for the following boat departure.\n\nDoes the Water Shuttle run on holidays?\n\nYes. The water shuttle will continue to operate on holidays occurring during regular days of operation every Wednesday through Sunday.\n\nAre strollers allowed on board?\n\nYes!\n\n12.

Two ADA spaces and 34 standard spaces are available. Parking is limited to 4-hours maximum. There is also limited on street parking in the area.\n\nWhere can I park my car in Jack London Square?\n\nThere are three public parking garages in Jack London Square, including at the foot of Broadway beneath the restaurant Plank (map). The Water Shuttle does not provide validation for parking in Jack London Square.\n\nCan I take transit to or from the water shuttle?\n\nThis handy map shows all of the transit options between Alameda and Oakland.\n\nIn Alameda, AC Transit Line 96 serves west Alameda and stops ¼ mile away on Mitchell Avenue (behind Target). Line 19 serves central Alameda via Buena Vista Ave. and stops ½ mile away near the Posey Tube portal at Marina Village Pkwy & Mariner Square Dr. In addition, from July 27 to Sept 29, on weekends, the Island Hopper will stop near the Water Shuttle dock and provide free shuttle access to Alameda Point.\n\nIn Oakland, AC Transit Line 12 stops on Embarcadero West between Broadway and Franklin St. Line 72/72M/72R stops at 2nd St & Washington St. You can also easily connect to Amtrak trains at the Jack London Square Station and SF Bay Ferry’s Oakland Terminal is less than a block away.\n\nWhere can I safely park my bike near the docks?\n\nIn Alameda, there are 12 Bike Link lockers next to the playground at Bohol Circle Immigrant Park. Bike racks are distributed throughout the park.\n\nIn Oakland, the closest Bike Link lockers are in the plaza at the Jack London Square Amtrak Station. Bike racks are distributed throughout Jack London Square.\n\nWhat are the safe bike routes connecting to the Water Shuttle?\n\nBike Walk Alameda has a wonderful guide on getting to Bohol Circle Immigrant Park from different parts of the Cross Alameda Trail.\n\nIn Oakland, refer to OakDOT’s bike map, or stop by Bike East Bay’s headquarters in Jack London Square for a paper map and some tips, located steps from the Oakland dock on Water St.\n\nWhat can I do if I miss the last boat or if the boat is not available?\n\nAC Transit has many lines serving Alameda and Oakland via the Posey and Webster Tubes. Line 96 stops in Alameda on Mitchell Avenue behind Target. In Oakland, board Line 96 at 7th St. & Franklin St.\n\nCheck out this handy map to see all of your options.\n\nMore Info/Trivia/How come…?\n\nWhat is the name of the boat?\n\nThe boat is named Woodstock, which is the name of the Gold Rush era settlement and early terminus of the trans-continental railroad on Alameda’s west end.\n\nWhy are there gaps in the schedule?\n\nThey’re needed for required crew breaks, refueling and crew changeover.\n\nWhy does the service not operate longer hours or more days per week?\n\nService levels match the funding available. The Water Shuttle is a two-year pilot service provided by a public-private partnership. The schedule may change in the future to respond to seasons, funding, and rider demand.\n\nWho is the operator of the Water Shuttle?\n\nSF Bay Ferry operates the shuttle with their contract provider Blue & Gold Fleet.\n\nWho is funding and supporting this service?\n\nThis new water shuttle service is being developed and supported by a growing team of agencies and organizations. Click here to see the current list.\n\nWhat public input did you use in creating the service schedule?\n\nThe City of Alameda conducted a survey in Spring 2023 and collected over 2,300 responses. The results, summarized here, helped inform our initial launch service schedule. We'll be conducting additional surveys, once the service starts, to collect feedback and hear more about what service the public would like.\n\nWhy is the Water Shuttle running on a fixed schedule instead of on-demand?\n\nPassenger ferries in the Bay Area currently operate on a fixed schedule, which allows the predictability and reliability that travelers – especially commuters planning their trips -- need. Variability in transit time in the busy Oakland Estuary is another factor. Providing a fixed schedule also allows the project partners to reliably model fuel burn and other variable expenses.\n\nThe plan is for the ferry to run on its schedule regardless of whether there are passengers waiting to board – the ferry will need to cross to meet its next departure in any case. However, this is a pilot service and an opportunity to learn about what service model best fits the needs of this route and market. The project partners have agreed to review data and make adjustments – including consideration of an on-demand model -- over the 2-year pilot as needed.\n\nPartnership + Funding\n\nThis new water shuttle service was developed and is supported by a growing team of agencies and organizations. As of 2024, financial and in-kind support for this free service is coming from:\n\nCity of Alameda\n\nWater Emergency Transportation Authority, which operates the San Francisco Bay Ferry services\n\nAlameda Transportation Management Association\n\nWest Alameda Transportation Management Association\n\nJack London Square Property Management Company (CIM Group)\n\nPort of Oakland\n\nJack London Improvement District\n\nAlameda County's Vehicle Registration Fees\n\nBay Area Air Quality Management District's TFCA County Program Manager funds\n\nPress + Social Media\n\nPress Release: Oakland Alameda Water Shuttle to Launch July 17, City of Alameda and SF Bay Ferry Press Release, 07/02/24\n\n\"I'm on a boat\": Part II, Morning Bun blog, 2/13/24\n\nWeekend Roundup: ..and Woodstock arrives, StreetsblogSF, 02/09/24\n\nWoodstock has landed!, City of Alameda Facebook post and Instagram post, 02/08/24\n\n\"I'm on a boat\", Morning Bun blog, 2/08/24\n\nNew water taxi service will connect Alameda Landing to Jack London Square, Oakland North, 12/18/23\n\nA free water shuttle connecting two East Bay cities is launching next year, San Francisco Chronicle, 12/02/23\n\nMeet Woodstock, Alameda's Water Shuttle to Jack London Square, StreetsblogSF, 11/15/23\n\nCity of Alameda unveils new free water taxi, KTVU, 11/12/23\n\nVessel arrives, City of Alameda Facebook page, 11/10/23\n\nPlanning Background\n\nThe need for an easy way to connect Oakland and Alameda across the Oakland Estuary has existed for many years. In the early 2000s, the Alameda Oakland Bike Ferry service operated for several years (see newsletter insert below).\n\nIn 2009, the City developed a comprehensive Estuary Crossing Final Feasibility Study Report(PDF, 6MB) to analyze and evaluate all of the potential strategies for crossing the Estuary either by foot, bike or transit. Seventeen (17) different crossing options were studied, including a gondola, different bridge types, Posey/Webster Tubes enhancements, water shuttle services and a new transit tube. Solutions for the near-, mid-, and long-term were explored. The top recommended, mid-term option was determined to be a water shuttle service.\n\nSince then, the City has been working to create a partnership to fund and operate a free public water shuttle service for Alameda and Oakland, and finally, in 2022, the pieces for this shuttle service came together, with a high level of private sector interest and financial commitments of up to 75% of operations funding. A grant was secured in 2023 from the Alameda County Transportation Commission, to cover the remaining 25% of the costs. WETA also agreed to administer and operate the pilot service.\n\nThe City of Alameda conducted a survey in Spring 2023 and collected over 2,300 responses. The results, summarized here(PDF, 139KB), helped inform our initial launch service schedule. We'll be conducting additional surveys to collect feedback and hear more about what service the public would like."
