SacRT has also launched a new app for all SmaRT Rides users.\n\nFEB 2018 – AUG 2018\n\nSacramento, CA\n\nThe Sacramento, CA Regional Transit agency (SacRT) launched a six-month microtransit pilot in its Citrus Heights suburb in February2018. SacRT chose Citrus Heights for a six-month pilot program because the agency already had two local shuttles there that pick up passengers at their doorsteps. But those dial-a-ride buses require phone reservations a day in advance and have proven to be cumbersome to manage. They also don’t work for people used to instant service. Working similar to Uber, microtransit buses carry a handful of riders at a time. The driver uses an iPad on the dashboard showing the shortest route to get passengers to their individual destinations. The microtransit service — to be operated by SacRT instead of through a public-private partnership — will cost the city about $25,000 for needed software. Again, SacRT’s 2018 budget already allows for the cost of two shuttle buses and drivers.\n\nThe pilot, which will enable riders to request specific pick-up and drop-off locations, is being put in place to improve existing “dial-a-ride” bus services. The the on-demand service can be requested via smartphones.\n\nThe Delicate Balance of Microtransit by Katherine Lewis\n\nWith many public transit agencies seeing declining ridership in recent years, and technology advances facilitating scheduling of small-capacity vehicles, many systems are looking to microtransit to improve customer service and expand their service area. This feeds into changing customer expectations—thanks to disruptive technology across a range of industries—for everything at our fingertips, from food through DoorDash to movies on Netflix and rides via Uber and Lyft.
