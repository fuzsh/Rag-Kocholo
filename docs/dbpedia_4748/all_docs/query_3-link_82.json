        "text": "Products\n\nReal-time bus and student location information and data are the backbone and passion of our company. When transportation, schools, and households can all access real-time cloud-based, information, phones stop ringing and people can make better, more informed, and efficient decisions.\n\nTransportation\n\nKnow where all of your buses are in real-time, all of the time. In a few clicks, answer and address any questions and parent or school inquiries. The WheresThe Bus desktop and mobile software is the most powerful and user-friendly software in the industry. Our greatest compliment is after our first training or demo, when customers routinely tell us \"anyone can use this\".\n\nStudent Ridership\n\nWheresTheBus has the most large-scale student ridership implementations in school transportation. We work with the infrastructure already in place in the school system, coming up with a coherent implementation strategy and ID technologies that work consistently across all school disciplines.\n\nParent App\n\nWhen families can access real-time, precise bus stop arrival information, they receive accurate, personalized information immediately, allowing Transportation staff to focus on transportation, not telephones.\n\nWheresTheBus was the first widespread parent app in the industry and remains the most advanced. The app provides real-time, precise bus stop arrival time predictions (ETA / Estimated Time of Arrival), maps, and bus stop views customized for each household.\n\nSchool View\n\nSchool View allows schools to access real-time location and arrival time information for all buses assigned to their school. Rather than calling Transportation inquiring about bus arrivals, school staff can focus on staging students and preparing them to efficiently board incoming buses.\n\nRuggedized Tablet (MDT)\n\nFully ruggedized (IP67) tablets are configured to do a wide range of functions including driver messaging, turn-by-turn directions, and student ridership / bus stop validation. A simple, user-friendly interface with easy, powerful, and quick access to information is our priority.\n\nAny information, software, or materials that are made available to you (\"Information\") is the copyrighted work of WheresTheBus LLC (\"WheresTheBus\") and those associated with WheresTheBus.
