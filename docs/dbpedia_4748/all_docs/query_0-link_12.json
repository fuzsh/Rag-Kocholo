        "text": "This paper will cover information about Hawaiian airlines. Founded in 1929, now in its 87th year of consecutive service, Hawaiian Airlines is Hawai 'i 's biggest and longest-serving airline, as well as the largest provider of passenger air service from its primary visitor markets on the U.S. mainland. Specifically, research to describe the airline, its aircraft fleet, route structure and number of employees will be provided. Information to determine whether Hawaiian airlines is organized as a corporation with private ownership or is owned by the national government will be given and discussed. Also, a brief description of the governmental agency or authority responsible for regulation of safety, as well as the certification requirements and minimum flight time for the commercial airline flight deck crewmembers. The governmental agency or authority that is empowered to regulate the routes flown, rates charged, and other economic aspects of the airline’s flight operations will be identified and discussed. Information will be given on the extent to which the airline’s fleet consists of owned vs. leased aircraft. All accidents involving an aircraft operated by that airline since 1/01/2000 will be identified to include the probable cause of each. Lastly, labor relationships of the airline’s pilots and maintenance personnel based in the airline’s home nation will be discussed; plus, any\n\nIn 2015, it showed in the record that the number of employees American Airline has was 110,300 employees within different departments such as flight attendants, and ground workers and pilots. With this huge number of workers, they need a representative to make their rights will be claimed. That why American Airline has a voice with a different labor unions such as Association of Professional Flight Attendants (APFA), Air Line Pilots Association (ALPA), Transport Workers Union-International Association of Machinists alliance (TWU-IAM) and Allied Pilot Association (APA). Therefore, the airline will be forced to consider and listen to the labor unions and their demands to avoid strikes that can damage the reputation of the company.\n\nOn August 3, 1981, nearly 13,000 of the 17,500 members of the Professional Air Traffic Controllers Organization (PATCO) staged a walk out and strike. There were four main reasons the union members of PATCO decided to go on strike. First, to address the concerns by members who felt that their work was seriously undervalued and under-rewarded. The second reason was that the Federal Aviation Administration had neglected serious deficiencies in staffing and hardware reliability. Thirdly, their work week was unreasonably long, especially when compared to controllers overseas. The fourth reason for the strike was the FAA’s (FEDERAL AVIATION ADMINISTRATION) approach to management-union relations and the\n\nThe airline industry has been divided into labor unions which include several types of unions such as the Flight Attendants' Unions, the Machinists' Unions, and the Pilots' Unions. The majority of the employees are part of such unions which has led to an increase in labor costs for the entire airline industry. TECHNOLOGICAL FACTORS Fuel efficiency is increasing. Aircrafts that are more fuel efficient are being developed and the engines are being redesigned to cater to this change.\n\nThe airline industry is one of the largest and most innovative industries within the United States. Aside from the innovations for which it is reputable and which changed the world the US airline industry is also notable in terms of the developments registered at the level of collective bargaining. The lines below reveal a brief time line of the events after 1978:\n\nAmerican Airlines is looking to expand its market to more wealthy consumers by offering an excusive line of aircraft consisting mostly of first class and business type seating. This new model will be labeled under the title “Elite” and would market routes to and from major city hubs during heavy business traveling hours. American Airlines will position this service as the, “Black Jet” since that would be the standout feature of the aircraft. American can take advantage of its existing market base along with its frequent fliers to sell the experience of a flight experience beyond maximizing passengers. The target motto would be a “flight redefined.” American Airlines Elite would target business, first class, and frequent flying travelers.\n\nThe Boeing complaint has created a huge conspiracy theory. As we speak, the NLRB is looking into whether Boeing chose to create a manufacturing plant for its new 787 airliner in South Carolina in effort to penalize its unionized workers in Everett, Wash., which would be completely illegal. The National Labor Relations Board (NLRB or Board) released a complaint attacking the Boeing Company that created a war throughout the airline industry and further out. The complaint claims that many violations against the NLRA have been arousing due to Boeing’s decision to create a non-union 787 airliner production line located in North Charleston, South Carolina. The board is days, if not months, away from retaliation or taking action against Boeing. There was a hearing held on June 14, but no one has heard an ounce of its outcome.\n\nOne Remarkable Fact Says It All: Since 1963, members from a single professional society have achieved virtually every milestone in modern American flight. That society is the American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics. With more than 30,000 individual members from 88 countries, and 95 corporate members, AIAA is the world’s largest technical society dedicated to the global aerospace profession. Created in 1963 by the merger of the two great aerospace societies of the day, the American Rocket Society\n\nAmerican airlines is a corporation that exhibits all of the characteristics of a firm in an industry where good tactical management is the key to success. This company and its regional airline partner American eagle serve almost 250 cities around the world and operate more than 3600 daily flights. Its goal is to provide safe, dependable and friendly air transportation along with related services, making a great effort to transform any experience into a positive one. All of the services that this company has and the image that they are trying to keep in every day activities make each day an inevitable challenge for its employees.\n\nThere hardly comes a time when Congress and Senate can unanimously agree to a bill to pass. Congress created the Transportation Security Administration (TSA) and the Senate voted unanimously to federalize airport security. Furthermore, this immediate action of unanimous votes was due to the terrorist attacks of 9/11. Additionally, this quickly led to the Aviation and Transportation Act. This act was immediately placed, and led to the establishment of the TSA as an Agency by George W. Bush in the fight against terrorist attacks on the U.S. On November 2001, the new agency known as TSA was created within the Department of Transportation and is now part of Homeland security. The amount of the budget given to the TSA allows them to be a bully that\n\nIts importance role of providing a platform for unions to negotiate and bargain with their respective airlines has minimized or prevented the extent of the damages strikes have on the airline industry. Strikes, such as the one by ALPA, have been proven to be disastrous with regard to public interest. RLA’s role cannot be taken lightly as an absence of such an act would be extremely detrimental to the airline industry and ultimately, United States’ commerce."
