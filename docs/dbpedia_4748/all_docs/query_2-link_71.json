This legislation will provide the FAA with the tools to improve the recruitment and upskilling of inspectors, engineers, and other positions focusing on safety-enhancing technologies and advanced automation.” Full letter of support\n\nTransport Workers Union of America (TWU) International President John Samuelsen: “The Securing Growth and Robust Leadership in American Aviation Act, offered by the bipartisan leadership of the Transportation and Infrastructure Committee, will make our national air space safer, improve the working conditions of airline workers, and return good, union jobs to the U.S.”\n\nU.S. Chamber of Commerce Transportation, Infrastructure, and Supply Chain Policy Vice President John Drake: “The U.S. Chamber of Commerce supports the bipartisan ‘Securing Growth and Robust Leadership in American Aviation Act,’ as it will advance our nation’s global leadership in aviation safety while respecting free enterprise. The U.S. business community understands best how to efficiently run their operations and provide customers with safe, affordable, and accessible service. We look forward to working with the Committee leadership to further improve this legislation and urge the Committee to support its passage.”\n\nU.S. Travel Association Executive Vice President of Public Affairs and Policy Tori Emerson Barnes: “The United States requires a more modern, efficient air travel system to grow the industry and the broader economy. By increasing investments in airport infrastructure, accelerating deployment of air traffic control technologies and addressing workforce shortages, the bipartisan ‘Securing Growth and Robust Leadership in American Aviation Act’ is a welcomed and necessary step forward. The U.S. Travel Association thanks Chairman Graves (MO), Ranking Member Larsen, Chairman Graves (LA), Ranking Member Cohen and the members of the committee for their bipartisan work on the bill.”\n\nVirginia Spaceport Authority CEO and Executive Director Maj. Gen. Roosevelt “Ted” Mercer, Jr., USAF (Ret.): “This legislation would reauthorize the Federal Aviation Administration for the next five years with a number of updates to ensure the United States remains the global leader in aerospace and aerospace infrastructure.
