        "text": "No matter your migration size — gigabyte, petabyte, or anywhere in between — Box Shuttle gets it done your way: all at once, in phases, or ongoing as you need it. With on-prem and cloud connectors, you centralize your content, configure permissions, and manage version history from one place.\n\nBuild a solid scope for your Box Shuttle migration, so it’s manageable for you and your teams. Rely on analytics to size up the content across your source tools. Remap ownership, structure folders, and control permissions (and sharing) for users and groups. Run simulations of your settings before you migrate to validate your configuration.\n\nYour cloud migration runs in the background, so you can continue to work on critical projects. Teams can work in Box or in source applications and files, and Box Shuttle will recognize and maintain any edits or additions. Afterward, review summary reporting, or dive into file-by-file details of your migration outcomes.\n\nContent stays secure from the moment you migrate. With frictionless security settings immediately applied, you can power workflows and collaborate with anyone (inside or outside your business) without delay or added work.\n\nIf you need guidance on deploying Box Shuttle, or you’re looking for a full-service managed migration, Box Consulting can help. Our robust Migration Services program provides you with expertise in planning, execution, change management, and user training — ensuring your migration is successful.\n\nConnectors\n\nConnect to both on-premises and cloud tools like file servers, Microsoft OneDrive, SharePoint Online and SharePoint Server, Google Drive, Dropbox, AWS, Azure, and GCP.\n\nAnalysis tools\n\nAnalyze and report on file migration source content. Gather details like file size, type, ownership, permissions, and more to help you scope and plan your migration.\n\nConfiguration tools\n\nMigrate as much data as you need — from single files to petabytes of data. Configure individual migrations, and manage settings like file exclusions, bandwidth, file version migration.\n\nLocation mapping\n\nSelect where content on the source should live in Box at both the owner and folder level. Automatically apply owner-specific user settings to migrated content.\n\nPermission management\n\nSelect whether to migrate permissions or just content. Map users on your source to users in Box, expand or restrict permissions, or skip conflicts when more in-depth assessment is needed.\n\nSimulation\n\nValidate configuration and mapping before your cloud migration. Get details like expected transfer duration, bottlenecks, folder and file quantities. Plus, access file-by-file details.\n\nTransfer\n\nRun your migration and transfer your source content to Box without any disruption to your workday. Migrated content is copied from the source, and doesn’t overwrite existing data.\n\nReporting\n\nReview robust post-migration reporting, including high-level summary details, visualizations of data, and deep, file-by-file results to audit migration outcomes when needed.\n\nDelta sync\n\nRe-run completed jobs to migrate any new or updated data on the source to Box, so teams keep working while migration runs. Delta syncs don’t overwrite edits to content already made in Box.\n\nEnterprise Plus gives you the best of the Content Cloud (and all the admin migration tools you need) in one simple plan. We’ve included our most-valued products and services to help you power secure enterprise workflow automation across your organization. And not only does it save you up to 35% — you get 20 terabytes included."
