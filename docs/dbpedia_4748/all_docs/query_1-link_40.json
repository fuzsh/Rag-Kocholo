        "text": "Pilots choose Mesa because of the real opportunities that exist for both experienced pilots and newcomers to the industry. Mesa’s training, job security and upgrade times are second to none. Since our latest expansion began in the spring of 2013, we have upgraded more than 400 pilots, many in less than two years.\n\nMesa crews have enjoyed higher career earnings due to upgrade opportunities, job stability through long-term partnerships with major airlines, and the opportunity to fly large, in-demand Bombardier CRJ700/900 and Embraer E175 aircraft.\n\nA testament to our success and future opportunities – is the fact that – while our growth is among the fastest in the industry, our pilot attrition is among the lowest.\n\nMesa Airlines…A Proud History, A Very Bright Future…\n\nMesa Airlines’ story began near a windy mesa in the unassuming town of Farmington, New Mexico. The company’s founders, Larry Risley (an A&P mechanic) and his wife Janie, mortgaged their house to pursue their dream of operating an airline. In 1982, “Mesa Air Shuttle” launched scheduled service between Farmington and Albuquerque with a five-seat Piper Chieftain aircraft. The call sign “Air Shuttle” is still in use today as a tribute to our earliest days. It was the beginning of what would become one of the industry’s most successful regional airlines.\n\nIs the Sky Calling? Mesa is the Answer.\n\nHeadquartered in Phoenix, Arizona since 1998, Mesa Airlines provides regional air service for American Airlines under the American Eagle banner from hubs in Phoenix and Dallas/Fort Worth and for United Airlines under the United Express brand from Washington Dulles and Houston.\n\nSince 2013, Mesa has more than doubled in size from 58 aircraft to 122, which will increase to 133 with currently-scheduled deliveries this year. The company has been in a rapid growth phase – creating more than 1,200 jobs, expanding our contracts with American and United to 2025 and 2028, and providing growth, new opportunities and job security for employees. Mesa currently operates more than 616 daily system departures to 105 cities, 37 states, the District of Columbia, Canada and Mexico.\n\nIn addition to attractive crew bases in livable hub cities, Mesa flies in-demand Bombardier CRJ700/900 and Embraer E175 aircraft – with no 50-seat aircraft to park, and is fortunate to be one of the regional airlines continuing to attract pilots, fill classes and provide unparalleled upgrade opportunities.\n\nTops in Ops\n\nIn May 2014, Mesa launched the Performance Pays program to raise awareness of the company’s operational performance requirements for United and American and to reward employees for working together to achieve these goals. The monthly bonus program rewards Mesa employees for outstanding operational performance and top customer service scores from passengers. Between May 2014 and February 2016, the company exceeded $2.3 million in monthly incentive bonuses paid to employees.\n\nWhile doubling in fleet size and opening new bases, the people of Mesa worked together to ensure every new aircraft was in service on time (or ahead) of schedule and that Mesa continues to be a top industry performer.\n\nThere have been many exciting changes at Mesa, including our look. In February 2015, Mesa launched a new, more employee-focused website and an updated logo design. We have invested in new technology, increased communications and updated our facilities to continue to engage our employees and attract new ones.\n\nOn Line – On Time\n\n• E175 in Service at United\n\nIn September 2013, Mesa announced a new agreement with United Airlines to extend the term of its CRJ700 fleet. The company was also selected to operate 30 new E175s, the first regional aircraft ever purchased by United. Between June 2014 and April 2016, 37 Embraer E175 aircraft entered service. While more than doubling the United Express Fleet, Mesa maintained its longstanding position as a top regional performer in the United Airlines system.\n\n• CRJ900 Expansion Aircraft in Service at American\n\nA key milestone for Mesa’s growth came in 2013 with a CRJ900 contract extension, solidifying a decades-long relationship with America West and US Airways. This created an opportunity to expand with the new American. Since May 2014, Mesa has added 14 CRJ900s to its American Eagle fleet, including seven factory-new CRJ900 Next Gen aircraft, and was selected to operate in American’s headquarters city in 2015.\n\nPilots Helping Pilots Progress in Their Careers\n\nTo support its ongoing growth, Mesa has expanded its focus on attracting highly qualified and engaged employees by combining leading-edge technologies with a newly-formed, energetic professional recruiting department. At Mesa, Recruiting is About Pilots Helping Pilots Progress in Their Careers. As a result the recruiting department is staffed by both senior Mesa Captains and newly-upgraded PICs. In fact, selecting outstanding candidates for Mesa is such a high priority, the flight operations, inflight and maintenance recruiting departments are located adjacent to the CEO’s and Chief Operating Officer’s Offices. Executive and senior management is also directly involved in the hiring process of both line employees and management candidates through video and web-based interviews.\n\nBenefits\n\nPilots hired at Mesa Airlines receive an Airline Transport Pilot type rating upon completion of initial training (CL-65 or EMB170/190)\n\nPilots receive unlimited travel benefits including jump seat agreements.\n\nFamily members (spouse, domestic partner, dependents, and parents) also receive travel benefits on our code share partners\n\nMesa Airlines offers competitive medical and dental benefits, vision, life, 401K and travel benefits with our code-share partners\n\nATP flight instructors receive tuition reimbursement\n\nATP-CTP course provided by Mesa Airlines for those pilots who qualify\n\nCrew Bases\n\nPhoenix (PHX)\n\nDallas (DFW)\n\nWashington Dulles (IAD)\n\nHouston (IAH)\n\nMesa pilots are initially assigned to a hub city based on current openings in seniority order\n\nElectronic Flight Bag\n\nMesa Airlines was the FIRST airline approved for Electronic Flight Bag usage for all phases of flight\n\nAll manuals and charts are issued electronically at no cost via a pilot provided iPad\n\nEach pilot is required to have an iPad (2, 3, 4, Air, or Air2) prior to simulator training\n\nTraining\n\nPilots will receive FULL monthly guarantee pay from the start of training\n\nGround Training is conducted at the Mesa Airlines’ Training Center in Phoenix, Arizona\n\nThe Company provides single-occupancy lodging during training\n\nPilots receive per diem during training and at the completion of IOE.\n\nEach new hire is assigned a mentor to assist them through their first six months of employment.\n\nQualifications (ATP Minimums)\n\n1500 hours Total Flight Time\n\n500 hours Cross Country Time\n\n100 hours Total Night Time\n\n50 hours Multi Engine Time, Fixed Wing\n\n250 hours of Pilot in Command Time, Fixed wing\n\n100 hours of Instrument time\n\nCommercial Pilot Certificate with Multi Engine and Instrument ratings\n\nCurrent FAA First Class Medical Certificate\n\nAbility to demonstrate instrument proficiency\n\nATP Written (CTP training can be provided to qualified applicants)\n\nFCC Restricted Radiotelephone Operator Permit\n\nCurrent Valid Passport\n\nAt least 23 years of age\n\nLegally authorized to work in the U.S.\n\nAble to pass security background check and FAA mandated drug test\n\nHigh school diploma or GED\n\nAbility to read and speak English language\n\nRestricted ATP Requirements\n\nMilitary – 750 Hours\n\nFour-Year Degree from approved aviation program – 1,000 Hours\n\nTwo-Year Degree from approved aviation program – 1,250 Hours\n\nAt least 21 Years of Age – 1,500 Hours\n\n200 Hours Cross Country Time\n\nAll other ATP Requirements Apply\n\nMesa Airlines recognizes the skills associated with helicopter flying.
