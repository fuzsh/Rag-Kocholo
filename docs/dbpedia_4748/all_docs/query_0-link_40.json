By upgrading one of the worldâs most prolific turboprop aircraft, the Cessna Grand Caravan EX, we can bring the benefits of electrified flight to passengers as soon as possible.\n\nHybrid Electric Powertrains\n\nOur first-generation hybrid electric powertrains are targeting\n\nemission reductions of up to 50% and direct operating cost\n\nreduction of up to 25%.\n\nTarget\n\n50%\n\nUp to 50% emission / fuel reductions\n\nTarget\n\n25%\n\nUp to 25% direct operating cost reductions\n\nFully Electric Powertrains\n\nOur first-generation fully electric versions have targets of\n\nup to 100% emission reduction and up to 50+% operating\n\ncost reduction.\n\nTarget\n\n100%\n\nUp to 100% emission / fuel reductions\n\nTarget\n\n50%\n\nUp to 50% direct operating cost reductions\n\nA new network\n\nConnecting regional airports\n\nA new network, with new opportunities\n\nWe believe making air travel more affordable and sustainable will fundamentally change how we move around the world. As we work toward reducing the environmental cost of flying to zero, we can redraw the map of where we live, work, and explore, opening up exciting new economic and lifestyle opportunities.\n\nIllustrative example of regional flight network potential\n\nWhere to next?\n\nBe a part of bringing scheduled flights to the airport closest to your home or office.\n\nClimate\n\nHelping to decarbonize air travel\n\nPassengers will no longer have to make the choice between the best travel solution and the most sustainable option once electrified aircraft take flight. With electrified aircraft flying short regional routes, we can start to make an impact on the aviation industryâs CO2 emissions.\n\nChange the way you fly"
