        "text": "New Parent Leave\n\nFull-Time Eligible employees who have been employed for at least 12 months may take up to 6 consecutive weeks (30 workdays) of Family Care Leave for a birth or adoption of a child: all 6 of those weeks will be compensated at 100 percent (100%) of the employeeâ€™s regular pay. Part-Time Eligible Employees who work a minimum of 25 hours per week and have been employed for at least 12 months may be eligible and the number of weeks of paid leave will be pro-rated based on length of service and percentage of time worked.\n\nEducational Assistance Program\n\nThe Indianapolis Airport Authority (IAA) understands the skills and knowledge of its employees are critical to the success of the organization and, in turn, the community. Investing in equitable opportunities for development and higher education and partnering with educational institutions in Indiana helps to foster our high performing culture and adds public value to our community. The Educational Assistance Program encourages personal development by providing up to $5,250 each year in tuition reimbursement or both degree and certificate programs to motivate employees to maintain and/or improve job-related skills and enhance their ability to compete for jobs within the IAA.\n\nTransparency Coverage Rule Anthem\n\nOn November 12, 2020, the Departments of Health and Human Services, Labor, and the Treasury finalized the Transparency in Coverage Rule that requires health insurers and group health plans to create a price comparison tool and post publicly available machine-readable files that include in-network negotiated payment rates and historical out-of-network charges for covered items and services, including prescription drugs.\n\nThe link below provides access to machine-readable files disclosing detailed information on the costs of covered items and services, including prescription drug pricing, for both requirements below.\n\n1. Negotiated rates for in-network providers\n\n2. Historical allowed amounts and billed charges for out-of-network providers"
