This can include, but is not limited to, charging equipment (such as alternating current (AC) Level 2 charging equipment, direct-current (DC) fast charging equipment, or vehicle-to-grid (V2G) enabled equipment); design and engineering; installation costs such as trenching, wiring and electrical upgrades, labor, and permitting; and related intelligent equipment and software designed to monitor bus and infrastructure performance (such as telematics or charge management software).\n\nEPA funds must not be used for any infrastructure costs associated with work on the utility’s side of the electrical meter.\n\nAll AC Level 2 charging infrastructure purchased under this program must be EPA ENERGY STAR certified at the time of purchase. EPA strongly recommends that all other charging infrastructure funded under this program be listed by a Nationally Recognized Testing Laboratory (NRTL). EPA also strongly encourages recipients to consider long-term fleet electrical needs when installing charging equipment. Installing additional electrical capacity on the customer side of the meter to support future charging needs (e.g., purchasing and running additional electrical conduit during trenching and wiring upgrades) is an allowable use of funds.\n\nAll electricians installing, operating, or maintaining EVSE must meet one of the following requirements: (i) Certification from the Electric Vehicle Infrastructure Training Program (EVITP), OR (ii) Graduation or a continuing education certificate from a registered apprenticeship program for electricians that includes charger-specific training and is developed as a part of a national guideline standard approved by the Department of Labor in consultation with the Department of Transportation. For projects requiring more than one electrician, at least one electrician must meet the requirements above, and at least one electrician must be enrolled in an electrical registered apprenticeship program. In limited circumstances, EPA may provide an exception to the above requirements for grantees that can demonstrate there are no electricians meeting the above requirements available in their area, and that efforts to train local electricians to meet the requirements are not feasible. EVITP certification of electricians working on a CSB-funded project is an allowable use as defined in the NOFO.\n\nApplicants should be aware that Build America, Buy America requirements apply to eligible vehicle charging infrastructure equipment.\n\nPlease refer to the FY23 CSB Grants NOFO for specific information about this competition.\n\nFunding Prioritizations\n\nPriority for funding is given to applications that:\n\nPropose to replace buses that serve districts that meet one or more of the prioritization criteria:\n\nHigh-need local educational agencies,\n\nRural school districts,\n\nBureau of Indian Affairs-funded school districts,\n\nSchool districts that receive basic support payments for children who reside on Indian land\n\nPlease refer to the FY23 CSB Grants NOFO for specific information about this competition.\n\nApplication Process\n\nApplication packages must be submitted electronically to EPA through Grants.gov by the deadline to be considered for funding.\n\nSpecifically, the Grants.gov registration process requires that your organization have a Unique Entity Identifier (previously known as the DUNS number) and a current registration with the System for Award Management (SAM.gov); the process of obtaining both could take a month or more for new registrants.\n\nPotential applicants without a Grants.gov account are encouraged to initiate the Grants.gov registration process well ahead of the deadline for funding since the registration process can take a month or more.\n\nOrganizations applying to this funding opportunity must have an active the System for Award Management registration. If you have never done business with the Federal Government, you will need to register your organization in SAM.gov. If you do not have a SAM.gov account, then you will create an account using the government sign in service1 (login.gov) to complete your System for Award Management registration. The registration is FREE. The process for entity registrations includes obtaining Unique Entity ID (UEI), a 12-character alphanumeric ID assigned an entity by SAM.gov, and requires assertions, representations and certifications, and other information about your organization. Please review the Entity Registration Checklist for details on this process. It is recommended to begin the System for Award Management registration process prior to applying to this grant competition; registration may take more than a month to complete.\n\nApplicants with existing Grants.gov accounts are encouraged to check the status of your System for Award Management account and address any account issues in advance of applying.\n\nPlease note that System for Award Management registrations do expire, and inactive accounts must re-register to be able to submit an application. If you have done business with the Federal Government previously, you can check your entity status using your government issued UEI to determine if your registration is active. The System for Award Management requires you renew your registration every 365 days to keep it active. Applicants must ensure that all registration requirements are met in order to apply for this opportunity through Grants.gov and should ensure that all such requirements have been met well in advance of the application submission deadline.\n\nAll applications must now be submitted through Grants.gov using the “Workspace” feature. Information on the Workspace feature can be found at the Grants.gov Workspace Overview Page.\n\nFor more information on the registration requirements that must be completed in order to submit an application through Grants.gov, click on “Applicants” on the top of the page, and then click the “Get Registered” link on the page. Contact the Federal Service Desk for help with your System for Award Management account, to resolve technical issues or chat with a help desk agent: (866) 606-8220. The Federal Service desk hours of operation are Monday – Friday 8am – 8pm ET.\n\nTools and Resources for Applicants\n\nEPA Grants Management Training for Applicants and Recipients provides an online training course that is designed to introduce EPA grant applicants and recipients to key aspects of the entire grant life cycle, from preparation of an application through grant closeout.\n\nFor applicants applying for zero-emissions school buses, coordination with their utility is critical to initiate early and continue throughout the project. For applicants’ convenience, EPA has created a sample template to guide applicants in their discussion with utilities, and has established an \"Electric Utility Pledge\" to help school districts with the deployment of electric school buses.\n\nEPA's Clean School Bus website provides charging and fueling infrastructure resources for alternative fuel buses, including, technical assistance videos, case studies, best practices, and more.\n\nThe Joint Office of Energy and Transportation provides technical assistance to school districts interested in electrifying their fleet via a partnership with the EPA. Interested stakeholders can contact the office to ask questions regarding the planning and deployment of clean school buses in their communities; potential applicants are encouraged to contact the Joint Office of Energy and Transportation for support in working with their utility companies early in the application process."
