Geographically our membership is distributed throughout the state, from southeast Michigan to the western-most point of our Upper Peninsula.\n\nThe objectives of the association shall be to consider issues common to the bus and motorcoach industry and to advise its members concerning laws and regulations of federal, state and local governmental bodies: to disseminate information and to encourage equality and uniformity relative to legislative and regulatory action; to promote better understanding among owners and operators of bus companies through conferences, educational programs and social activities; and to bring about a greater awareness of bus operations on the part of the general public.\n\nMissouri Public Transit Association (MPTA) was established in 1980 as a Missouri non-profit corporation.
