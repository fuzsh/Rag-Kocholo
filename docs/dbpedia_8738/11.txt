Paying by credit or debit card in Portugal

In Portugal, large, upmarket, and chain shops and restaurants - as well as hotels - are likely to take card payments. However, smaller family run places may prefer cash, so carrying both is a smart move.

ATMs in Portugal

You'll be able to find ATMs - called Multibanco - in cities and towns across Portugal.

However, small villages and remote areas won't have ATM coverage, so carry cash if you're adventuring off the beaten track.

To get the best deal when spending on card or withdrawing money in Portugal, don’t forget to use the Wise travel money card to avoid sneaky exchange rate markups and excessive fees.
