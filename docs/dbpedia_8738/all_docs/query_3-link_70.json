        "text": "In 2015, the Central Bank of Malta issued two numismatic coins, in gold and silver, depicting the Auberge de Bavière. This will be the fifth and final in the Bank's series of numismatic coins on the auberges of the Knights of St John.\n\nThe obverse of the coins shows the emblem of Malta with the year of issue. The reverse features the façade of the Auberge de Bavière.\n\nPalazzo Carnerio, known today as the Auberge de Bavière, was built in 1696 by the Portuguese knight Gaspare Carnerio. The palace was designed by Carlo Gimach. Palazzo Carnerio was purchased for the use of the Anglo-Bavarian Langue, which had been set up in 1782 during the rule of Grand Master De Rohan. During the First World War the Auberge de Bavière was converted into a hospital. It was later used as a school and today it houses the Government Property Department."
