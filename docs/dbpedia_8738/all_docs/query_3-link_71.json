        "text": "In this paper, we assess the production, supply, and circulation of 'national' gold coins in Brazil in the eighteenth century. New estimates have been provided of the volume of production of these gold coins at Mints of Rio de Janeiro, Bahia, and Minas Gerais. Comparing the values of this coinage with remittances to Lisbon, the first half of the eighteenth century reveals a more stable conjuncture than the second half. This latter period shows fluctuations that were expressed in the faster growth of the supply, despite the fall that took place in the production-coinage of gold. Our conclusions question the historiographical theses about the shortage of currency in Brazil throughout the Eighteenth Century. The growth of the economy from the last quarter of the Century onwards implied an increase in the demand for money, which may explain the increase in the supply of national gold coins.\n\nThis article analyses the transition from bimetallism to the gold standard in Portugal. The research has emphasised that the high percentage of gold coins in circulation and the network externalities were the main reasons for the de jure adoption of the gold standard in 1854. However, it has not provided a justification for either the appreciation of gold in the Portuguese market in 1847 which was contrary to the international trend or the reasons behind the decision to continue to circulate British gold sovereigns in 1851 when all other foreign coins were withdrawn. We argue that the political pressure applied by groups with ownership of British gold coins explains the transition from bimetallism to the gold standard.\n\nThis article analyses the transition from bimetallism to the gold standard in Portugal.

Precious metals were often transferred from a region, or a country, to another: looting of conquered regions (such as Roman Spain, Gaul or Egypt), invasions (Vandals, Huns invading the Roman Empire, Crusaders arriving at Constantinople), and, of course arrival of gold and silver from Americas after 1492. Each time, the new metal disturbed the monetary systems, sometimes improving, sometimes troubling the currencies and economies. The period considered is focused on the 19th century, the question of the depreciation of silver and the transfers of metals from America or Europe to Asia, India, China, etc. However, papers on the other main transfers of metal are welcome, especially those concerning the important transfers of metal following the discovery of Americas. Thematic or theoretical approaches as well as comparative studies are welcome (consequences of the arrival of metal on prices, currency, society, etc.). In general all papers in relation with these problems are welcome.\n\nIn this article we estimate MO for the period between 1834 and 1891. The first section deals with an interconnected and, in a certain sense, previous subject: monetary regime. The period under consideration will be 1797-1891. Its beginning coincides with the introduction of paper-money in Portugal and its end with the declaration of inconvertibility after a financial and banking crisis. Section 3 presents an analysis of monetary evolution on the economy.\n\nThe lack of important silver and gold sources in Brazil before the finds in the region of Minas Gerais at the end of the 17th century is known. Information concerning the first gold finds reached the Portuguese capital in 1695 but it was only in 1697 that the first ship arrived at Lisbon harbour with a gold load identified in the documents as ‘Peruvian’ but supposed to be Brazilian. The first Brazilian mint was itinerant, and the first silver and gold coins were struck in Bahia from 1694 to 1698. In order to try to find out which metals were struck before 1698 in Brazil, we analyzed gold and silver coins issued by the first Brazilian mint, Bahia, and coins issued in Mexico and in South America—Peru, Bolivia, Colombia, Chile—as well as Brazilian gold ingots from different mining regions. Fingerprinting was done using several analytical techniques: 12 MeV proton activation analysis, moderated neutrons activation analysis and inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry with laser ablation. We could show that in general the platinum group elements discriminate gold and that elements such as gold, indium and tin discriminate silver. The comparison of the Brazilian coins and ingots with the coins issued elsewhere in South America and Mexico showed that the gold and silver coins circulating in Brazil between 1694 and 1698 were mostly made from a mixture of metals from the main Latin American sources."
