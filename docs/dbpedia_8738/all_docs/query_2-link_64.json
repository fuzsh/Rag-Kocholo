The program started in October 2012 and since then more than 12,000 applicants have applied for their Golden Visas.\n\nWhat You Will Find in This Article:\n\nWhat Is Portugal Golden Visa\n\nBenefits: What Are the Benefits of Portugal Golden Visa\n\nEligibility: Who Is Eligible for a Golden Visa in Portugal\n\nPortugal Golden Visa Investment Options: What Types of Investments Qualify for The Golden Visa\n\nRequirements: What Are the Golden Visa Portugal Requirements\n\nHow To Get a Golden Visa in Portugal: Application and Process\n\nFees and Costs: What Are the Government Fees and Legal Costs Related to Golden Visa\n\nStatistics on Portugal Golden Visa\n\nThe Updated Portugal Golden Visa Program in 2024\n\nPrevious Portugal Golden Visa Changes\n\nGet Golden Visa: Who We Are and How We Can Help You\n\nYour Guide to Portugal Golden Visa\n\nAt Get Golden Visa, we helped thousands of investors and families from 41 different countries obtain a Golden Visa in Portugal.\n\nContact us and speak to our independent advisors who can assist you with all your investment and Portugal Golden Visa Program related questions.\n\nPortugal Golden Visa In a Nutshell\n\nPortuguese Golden Visa provides a range of relatively affordable investment options for you to choose from in obtaining your residence permit,\n\nYou are only required to spend a minimum of seven days in Portugal per year,\n\nPortugal Golden Visa Program gives you visa-free access to the Schengen states,\n\nYou can become a Portuguese citizen within five to six years,\n\nPortugal is a safe, secure, affordable country with a high quality of life, solid infrastructure, superb climate, and good health and education systems.\n\nWhat Is Portugal Golden Visa?\n\nThe Portugal Golden Visa program, also known as the residence permit for investment activity (ARI), is a residency by investment scheme designed for non-EU citizens.\n\nPortugal launched the program in October 2012. The main objective was to attract international capital into the country, as it was much in need after the 2008 economic crisis. The program proved to be a great success, raising over €7.5 billion since then.\n\nPortugal offers a wide coastline, a great climate, hospitable people, and delicious cuisine. Better yet, it provides this high quality of life at an affordable cost of living. These factors make Portugal a very attractive destination for international investors to invest in and obtain the right to live, work, and study in the country.\n\nFurthermore, the Portugal Golden Visa program provides the opportunity to become a permanent resident or a citizen in Portugal in only five years.\n\nBenefits: What Are the Benefits of the Portugal Golden Visa?\n\nYou can qualify for residency by contributing a minimum of €250,000 which is one of the lowest investment thresholds in Europe,\n\nYou don’t have to move to Portugal to keep your residence permit. Staying in the country for seven days on average per year will suffice,\n\nYou can be eligible to apply for Portuguese citizenship in five years. This is one of the quickest in Europe,\n\nOnce you become a Portuguese citizen, you get visa-free access to 191 countries.\n\n1. Visa-Free Travel\n\nThe Golden Visa permit registers you in the Schengen Area central system. So, you can freely travel within Europe without an additional visa.\n\nAt the end of five years, if you decide to get Portuguese citizenship, you can get a Portuguese passport. The Portuguese passport allows you to travel to 191 countries without the need for a visa.\n\n2. Living, Working, and Studying in Portugal\n\nPortuguese Golden Visa allows you to live, work, and study in Portugal.\n\nIf you decide to live in Portugal full-time with your Portuguese Golden Visa, then you will be required to have medical insurance. You will, however, have full access to all public services including healthcare and education.\n\nState schools follow the Portuguese curriculum, though there are numerous private British and American international schools.\n\nThe work permit allows you to work anywhere, as well as start and run your own business in Portugal.\n\n3. Family Reunification\n\nAs the main applicant, you may extend your Portuguese Golden Visa to your family members. The application process is simultaneous for the main applicant and the dependents.\n\nThe following members of the family are eligible to apply along with the main applicant:\n\nSpouse,\n\nChildren under the age of 18\n\nFinancially dependent 18+ children provided that they are full-time students and not married,\n\nParents of the main applicant, if over the age of 65 years old.\n\n4. Citizenship and Passport\n\nYou may apply for citizenship after five years of holding a Golden Visa in Portugal.\n\nIn order to qualify for citizenship, you must have:\n\nNo outstanding tax payments in Portugal,\n\nClean criminal records from Portugal and from your home country,\n\nObtain an A2 level language certification in Portuguese.\n\nLater in the article, we will touch on the specifics of the Portuguese language requirement.\n\nImportant Note: In 2024, the Portuguese Parliament has approved changes to the citizenship law, affecting how the 5-year residency period required for citizenship eligibility is calculated. With the change, the countdown for these five years begins on the day you submit your application, rather than when you receive your residence permit. Check out the details on the Portuguese Citizenship Law Change.\n\n5. Tax Benefits\n\nPortugal Golden Visa Program will not bring any tax responsibility to you unless you spend more than 183 days of the year in Portugal. In case you do, then you become a tax resident in Portugal. The country offers a competitive tax system to those who are tax residents in Portugal.\n\n6. Overall Benefits\n\nAs a Portuguese Golden Visa applicant, you have the right to live and work in Portugal, but there is no requirement to do so. With your Golden Visa, you can enjoy free travel within the European Schengen visa zone. After holding a Golden Visa for five years, you can apply for citizenship or permanent residency in Portugal, leading to a passport. The Portuguese passport allows you to live, work, study anywhere within the European Union.\n\nEligibility: Who Is Eligible for a Golden Visa in Portugal?\n\nNationalities\n\nAny non-EU/EEA/Swiss national can apply for the Portugal Golden Visa.\n\nPre-requisites\n\nYou’re required to be at least 18 years old and hold a clean criminal record from your home country, as well as from Portugal. The funds for the investment should arrive from outside of Portugal.\n\nGolden Visa Minimum Investment\n\nIn order to qualify for Portugal’s Golden Visa, a qualifying investment has to be made. Investment categories include venture capital fund, company formation / employer responsibilities, and donation. Later on in this guide, you can find a list of qualifying investments.\n\nFamily Members\n\nUnder family reunification, you may extend the Golden Visa to the rest of the family members. A comprehensive list of eligible dependents is listed in the previous section.\n\nAmerican Applicants\n\nUS citizens are eligible to apply for the Portuguese Golden Visa. American Golden Visa applicants typically prefer to invest in a qualifying private equity or venture capital fund.\n\nThe number of American expats in Portugal surged above 10,000 as of 2024, a big increase over previous years. This rise is often attributed to the affordability, pleasant climate, and safety in Portugal.\n\nBritish Applicants\n\nIn 2021, UK passports lost their freedom of movement in the Schengen Area. British investors had to plan for the mobility repercussions of Brexit. UK citizens target Portugal for three reasons: travel rights across Europe, a desirable lifestyle, and ultimately European citizenship by investment.\n\nThe British expats constitute the second-largest expatriate group in Portugal, with over 50,000 British residents residing across the country.\n\nGet Golden Visa: Who We Are and How We Can Help You\n\nGet Golden Visa is a bespoke investment advisory firm. Contact us and talk to one of our experienced team members to help you with any and all your questions in your quest for Portugal Golden Visa.\n\nPortugal Golden Visa Investment Options: What Types of Investments Qualify for the Golden Visa?\n\nPortugal Golden Visa program offers different investment options.\n\nFund Subscription\n\nCompany\n\nDonation\n\nReal Estate Acquisition (no longer eligible)\n\nCapital Transfer (no longer eligible)\n\nFund Subscription\n\nA minimum of €500,000 subscription in a qualifying Portuguese fund. The qualifying funds include Private Equity and Venture Capital funds in Portugal and exclude any fund that has direct or indirect real estate ties.\n\nCompany\n\nCreation of a minimum of 10 new full-time jobs in a Portuguese business that is owned by yourself as the main applicant.\n\n→Create a minimum of eight new full-time jobs in a Portuguese business formed in a low-density area in Portugal, owned by the main applicant.\n\nInvest a minimum of €500,000 in an existing Portuguese business, where the incorporated business must create a minimum of five new full-time jobs for at least three years.\n\nDonation\n\nInvest a minimum of €250,000 in preserving national heritage in Portugal.\n\nInvest a minimum of €500,000 in a research and development activity in Portugal.\n\nReal Estate Acquisition (no longer eligible)\n\nReal estate investments no longer qualify you for a Golden Visa in Portugal as of October 2023.\n\nCapital Transfer (no longer eligible)\n\nCapital transfer no longer qualifies you for a Golden Visa in Portugal as of October 2023.\n\nAre Loans Allowed for the Golden Visa Investment in Portugal?\n\nA common question is if you can use a loan or a mortgage in making your Golden Visa investment in Portugal. Portugal expects you to bring in the minimum required amount from outside of Portugal into the country. So the minimum amount cannot be taken out as a loan from a Portuguese financial institution.\n\nHowever, you can take the amount as a loan from a non-Portuguese financial institution and then bring it into Portugal. Additionally, if your investment exceeds the minimum amount, there is nothing stopping you from taking a loan for the exceeding amount from a Portuguese bank.\n\nWhich Portugal Golden Visa Investment Route To Take\n\nChoosing the best route for your Golden Visa investment can be difficult. In this video, our Regional Partner Werner Gruner explains the pros and cons of real estate and fund investment routes.\n\nReal estate is no longer an eligible investment route for Golden Visas, but the comparison is useful in understanding where the current most popular investment route, the fund investment, stands.\n\nRequirements: What Are the Golden Visa Portugal Requirements?\n\nMinimum Residence Requirement\n\nPortugal Golden Visa program has a low stay requirement. Portugal requires Golden Visa residents to spend a minimum of seven days annually on average in the country.\n\nImportant Note: As of April 2020, the initial residence permits became valid for two years (used to be one year) and the subsequent permits became valid for two years each. This was due to a legislative change in the Portuguese immigration law. In case the change is permanent, it is expected that the initial card that is valid for two years will require the cardholder to spend at least fourteen days within that two-year period physically in Portugal. Then the renewal cards will also be valid for two years each and the applicants will need to spend at least fourteen days physically in Portugal within the two-year period.\n\nMake and Maintain a Qualified Investment for Five Years\n\nYou’re required to present supporting evidence that you have individually made the investment of the minimum amount required. As the main applicant, you must maintain the investment as long as you and your dependents hold Golden Visa residency status.\n\nIf and once you become a permanent resident or a Portuguese citizen, the investment no longer needs to be maintained. You can then liquidate whichever investment you made.\n\nProper Documentation\n\nYou need to provide the following documents in order to apply for Portugal Golden Visa Program:\n\n1) Copy of a passport or other government-issued travel document,\n\n2) Proof of evidence of the qualifying investment made by the main applicant individually:\n\n→ If investment fund; proof of fund subscription from the fund manager.\n\n3) Declaration from a Portuguese financial institution confirming the transfer of funds,\n\n4) Criminal record of the current country of residence,\n\n→ Must be issued within three (3) months of the form submission.\n\n5) A completed form authorizing SEF to access criminal records in Portugal,\n\n6) A sworn declaration of compliance with the minimum investment requirements for the necessary time period of five years,\n\n7) Documents outlining good standing with the Portuguese Tax and Customs Authority & Social Security system,\n\n→ Must be issued within 45 days of the form submission.\n\n8) Receipt of ARI application payment,\n\nUnless otherwise stated, it is best to have the documentation issued within three months of your Golden Visa application submission.\n\nLegalizing Documents\n\nAll the above documents issued by a non-Portuguese entity need to be legalized. The legalization must have an apostille if the subject country is part of the Hague convention.\n\nTranslating Documents\n\nAny original document that is not in Portuguese needs to be translated into Portuguese and certified. The certification is typically performed by a notary.\n\nRelated Fees\n\nBelow is a chart of Portugal Golden Visa government application fees;\n\nBank Account and NIF Number\n\nPortugal requires you, the main applicant, to make the investment from your bank account in Portugal. Accordingly, it is mandatory for you to have an account in a Portuguese bank. You must also have a NIF number, which is a tax identification number in Portugal, to open the account.\n\nBoth obtaining a NIF number and opening a bank account in Portugal are pretty straightforward. They can both be done in half a day.\n\nGetting a NIF Number\n\nGet proof of address from your country of residence,\n\nBring a government-issued identification and your proof of address to a Finanças office in Portugal,\n\nGet your NIF number on the spot within an hour.\n\nYou can also provide your lawyer with a power of attorney and they can complete this step without you even being present in Portugal.\n\nOpening a Portuguese Bank Account\n\nUnlike many countries in the world, Portuguese banks make it quite easy to open a bank account for non-residents and foreigners. The banking and maintenance fees are also quite low compared to the rest of Europe. Just follow the below steps:\n\nWhat you will need:\n\nPassport or government-issued travel document,\n\nNIF number,\n\nPortuguese phone number,\n\nProof of address from your country of residence,\n\nProof of income/payslip,\n\nWhat you will do:\n\nGo to the bank branch and open your account.\n\nTypically, each law firm has one or more banks and branches they work closely with. It is best to get their advice in order to keep things moving quickly.\n\nHow To Get a Golden Visa in Portugal: Application Process\n\nThe Golden Visa application in Portugal is quite straightforward. If you take the necessary steps, such as investment, legal steps, and the right documentation, you’ll have a successful Portugal Golden Visa application process. Check the steps below for more clarification:\n\nStep One: Speak to Get Golden Visa Team and Decide on Your Investment Type\n\nFirst things first. You need to analyze the list of available investment types and decide on which investment you will move forward with. Tip: Currently, the fund option is by far the most popular investment method.\n\n↓\n\nStep Two: Gather All Necessary Documents\n\nYou need to gather all necessary documents for yourself, the main applicant, as well as all those for your dependents if you have any. This step may get a bit tiring, especially with all the translations, notarizing, apostilles, and certifications. However, a professional advisor like Get Golden Visa will help alleviate the headache.\n\n↓\n\nStep Three: Get a NIF and Open a Bank Account\n\nAs mentioned above in the article, getting a NIF in Portugal can practically be done within a day. As for opening a bank account, it may take anywhere from a week to a couple of months, depending on which country you are originally from. This is a task that you can delegate to your lawyers to complete without your presence in the country.\n\n↓\n\nStep Four: Finalize the Investment\n\nNow that you chose which investment type to go with, it’s time to pay up and lock in your investment in Portugal.\n\n↓\n\nStep Five: Submit Pre-Application\n\nWith your qualifying investment made and your paperwork ready, you will submit your pre-application online to AIMA (previously SEF). In most cases, your law firm will do this on your behalf and notify you if there is anything missing.\n\nIn standard times, it takes roughly two months from the time you submit your documents until your appointment date.\n\n↓\n\nStep Six: Schedule and Attend Your AIMA (previously SEF) Appointment\n\nAfter analyzing your pre-application, AIMA will provide you with a set of available dates for a biometrics appointment. On the chosen appointment date, you and your dependents need to physically show up at the corresponding AIMA office in order to submit your fingerprints and make your application official.\n\n↓\n\nStep Seven: Get Your Golden Visa and Renew\n\nBingo! You and your dependents receive your Golden Visa residence cards. Your law firm or your professional advisor will collect the cards and send them your way. Each card is valid for two years and at the end of the validity period, you will renew your Golden Visa card to receive a new one.\n\nIt takes roughly six months from your biometrics appointment until you receive your cards.\n\n↓\n\nStep Eight: Become a Portuguese Citizen\n\nOnce five years lapse from the day you submitted your application to AIMA, you are eligible to apply for permanent residency or citizenship in Portugal. The citizenship application typically takes anywhere from a year to 18 months. Once you receive your permanent residence or citizenship, you will no longer need to maintain your investment in Portugal.\n\nAs Get Golden Visa, we’re committed to assisting you through your Golden Visa journey.\n\nTimeline: What Is the Timeline for the Golden Visa Process?\n\nThe initial application and the supporting documents are submitted online to Agência para a Integração Migrações e Asilo (AIMA). AIMA is the official immigration and border services office in Portugal. Once they approve your application, you then need to appear for an interview in person.\n\nThere are numerous AIMA offices across Portugal, and you may apply for any of them, regardless of where you made your investment. That way, you can avoid districts with long waitlists such as the SEF office in Lisbon. It can take more than a year for AIMA to approve and provide a biometrics appointment date.\n\nAs the main applicant, you and all your dependents can book the AIMA appointment simultaneously. After the in-person interview, you will receive your Golden Visa cards. It typically takes around six months to receive these residence permit cards.\n\nYour residence clock starts ticking on the day your Golden Visa card is issued.\n\n* Note: AIMA used to be called Serviço de Fronteiras e Estrangeiros (SEF) until late 2023. So if you come across the SEF acronym, do not be confused. It most likely refers to AIMA.\n\nYear One and Two\n\nYour initial Golden Visa residence card will be valid for two (2) years. In these two years, you must spend a total of fourteen (14) days in Portugal.\n\nAt the end of this period, you need to renew your residence permit. So, between 30-90 days prior to the expiration date of your card, you need to repeat the above AIMA appointment to renew your cards. For the renewal, you need to re-submit the up-to-date documentation (ie. criminal records), biometrics, and necessary application processing fee.\n\n↓\n\nYear Three, Four, and Five\n\nYour renewed Golden Visa residence permit will be valid for two (2) years. Within those two years, you must spend at least fourteen (14) days in Portugal. Your residence permit can then be renewed for another two (2) years, requiring you to spend yet another fourteen (14) days in the country.\n\n↓\n\nEnd of Year Five\n\nWith the recent updates to the citizenship law in 2024, any time that lapses until you receive your first Golden Visa card also counts towards your five year to citizenship.\n\nAt the end of the fifth year, you have three options:\n\nApply for Permanent Residence in Portugal\n\nApply for Citizenship in Portugal\n\nContinue with the Golden Visa temporary residence program\n\nIf you decide to become a permanent resident or a citizen in Portugal, you no longer need to maintain the Golden Visa investment you made in the country.\n\nThe above application, stay, and renewal requirements always apply to all Golden Visa cardholders, including the main applicants and their dependents.\n\nThe above timeline is based on the assumption that you would receive your first card without a wait.\n\nFees and Costs: What Are the Government Fees and Legal Costs Related to Portuguese Golden Visa Program?\n\nIn addition to the minimum investment you make and the necessary fees related to the transaction of the investment property, you will be faced with legal fees and government application fees. Below, you may find a detailed list of all the associated costs.\n\nGovernment Fees\n\nLegal Fees\n\nThe legal fees depend on the law firm you choose to work with.\n\nThe Portugal Golden Visa investment is quite a sizable one, so it is best if you assign an experienced law firm to take care of your due diligence, as well as the application and renewal process. The legal fees can add up to a significant amount, but it is best not to take chances by going with a newbie in the field.\n\nThe fees can land somewhere between €10,000 all the way up to €30,000 for a family of four, taking into account the complete five-year span. The good thing is, you will not have to pay this upfront, but in installments depending on the completed tasks within the five years.\n\nWe would be happy to guide you to a number of different experienced law firms in the field of Portuguese Golden Visa.\n\nCosts Related to Investment\n\nDepending on your preferred type of investment, the associated costs differ. Below, you can find a table that covers the costs associated with the most popular investment types; real estate acquisition, fund investment, and transfer of capital:\n\n* Varies on the fund, it is typical for the performance fee to be between 20 percent-50 percent above a hurdle on the profit\n\n** Varies on the fund, it is typical for the annual management fee to be between one percent-two percent of the invested amount\n\n*** Legal fees vary widely between law firms, the number of dependents, and other variables; it would not greatly differ between different investment routes\n\nTaxes: What Are the Portuguese Golden Visa Tax Implications?\n\nTax Implications\n\nTax residency and legal residency are different concepts.
