Learn more here and join the waitlist.\n\nIf you already have a Wise card or you’re not located in the US, you're not impacted by this change.\n\nThe Wise card is currently available for residents of these countries and regions:\n\nAustralia\n\nBrazil\n\nCanada\n\nEEA + Switzerland*\n\nJapan\n\nMalaysia\n\nNew Zealand\n\nPhilippines\n\nSingapore\n\nUK + European microstates and overseas territories*\n\nUSA (except for residents in Nevada)\n\nWhat if my country isn’t listed?\n\nWe’re working hard to make cards available everywhere. In the meantime, if your country or region isn't on the list, you can go on our waitlist, and we’ll let you know when cards are coming your way.\n\nMoving to a new country\n\nDo I need to get a new card if I move to a different country?\n\nOnce you move to a new country your Wise card won’t work anymore, you’ll have to order a new Wise card. We’ll ask for your updated address, and we may request additional information or ID documents.\n\nYou don't need to order a new card if you move within the same region:\n\nbetween countries in the EEA + Switzerland*\n\nbetween the countries in the UK + European microstates and overseas territories*\n\nWhy can’t I keep using my old card when I move to/from the US?\n\nWe know that moving to a new country can be a difficult process, so we’ll always try to make your experience as smooth as possible.\n\nCard licences are specific for different countries and regions and do change depending on where you’re located. This means that when you relocate to or from the US you need to order a new card to meet the requirements of the country you now reside in.\n\n*EEA + Switzerland: Austria, Belgium, Bulgaria, Croatia, Cyprus, Czechia, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, France (only Metropolitan), Germany, Greece, Hungary, Iceland, Italy, Ireland, Latvia, Liechtenstein, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Malta, Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Slovakia, Slovenia, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland"
