        "text": "Howâs Life?\n\nPortugal performs well across a number of well-being dimensions relative to other countries in the Better Life Index. Portugal outperforms the average in housing safety and environmental quality. It underperforms average in income, social connections, civic engagement and life satisfaction. These assessments are based on available selected data.\n\nMoney, while it cannot buy happiness, is an important means to achieving higher living standards. In Portugal, the average household net-adjusted disposable income per capita is USD 24 877 a year, less than the OECD average of USD 30 490 a year.\n\nIn terms of employment, about 69% of people aged 15 to 64 in Portugal have a paid job, above the OECD employment average of 66%. Some 72% of men are in paid work, compared with 67% of women. In Portugal, 6% of employees work very long hours in paid work, below the OECD average of 10%, with 8% of men working very long hours in paid work compared with 3% of women.\n\nGood education and skills are important requisites for finding a job. In Portugal, 55% of adults aged 25-64 have completed upper secondary education, lower than the OECD average of 79%. However, completion varies between men and women, as 52% of men have successfully completed high school compared with 59% of women. In terms of the quality of the education system, the average student scored 492 in reading literacy, maths and science in the OECD's Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA). This score is higher than the OECD average of 488. On average in Portugal, girls outperformed boys by 3 points, well below the average OECD gap of 5 points.\n\nIn terms of health, life expectancy at birth in Portugal is around 82 years, one year higher than the OECD average of 81 years. Life expectancy for women is 85 years, compared with 79 for men. The level of atmospheric PM2.5 – tiny air pollutant particles small enough to enter and cause damage to the lungs – is 8.3 micrograms per cubic meter, below the OECD average of 14 micrograms per cubic meter. In Portugal, 89% of people say they are satisfied with the quality of their water, higher than the OECD average of 84%.\n\nConcerning the public sphere, there is a moderate sense of community and moderate levels of civic participation in Portugal, where 87% of people believe that they know someone they could rely on in time of need, less than the OECD average of 91%. Voter turnout, a measure of citizens' participation in the political process, was 49% during recent elections, much lower than the OECD average of 69%. Social and economic status can affect voting rates; voter turnout for the top 20% of the population is an estimated 52% and for the bottom 20% it is an estimated 47%.\n\nWhen asked to rate their general satisfaction with life on a scale from 0 to 10, Portuguese people gave it a 5.8 grade on average, lower than the OECD average of 6.7.\n\nFor more information on estimates and years of reference, see FAQ section and BLI database.\n\nKey Findings\n\nLiving in satisfactory housing conditions is one of the most important aspects of people's lives. Housing is essential to meet basic needs, such as shelter, but it is not just a question of four walls and a roof. Housing should offer a place to sleep and rest where people feel safe and have privacy and personal space; somewhere they can raise a family. All of these elements help make a house a home. And of course there is the question whether people can afford adequate housing.\n\nHousing costs take up a large share of the household budget and represent the largest single expenditure for many individuals and families, by the time you add up elements such as rent, gas, electricity, water, furniture or repairs. In Portugal, households on average spend nearly 20% of their gross adjusted disposable income on keeping a roof over their heads, in line with the OECD average.\n\nIn addition to housing costs it is also important to examine living conditions, such as the average number of rooms shared per person and whether households have access to basic facilities. The number of rooms in a dwelling, divided by the number of persons living there, indicates whether residents are living in crowded conditions. Overcrowded housing may have a negative impact on physical and mental health, relations with others and children's development. In addition, dense living conditions are often a sign of inadequate water and sewage supply. In Portugal, the average home contains 1.7 rooms per person, in line with the OECD average. In terms of basic facilities, 99.1% of dwellings in Portugal contain private access to an indoor flushing toilet, more than the OECD average of 97%.\n\nMore Resources\n\nHow's Life?: Measuring Well-being\n\nKey Findings\n\nHaving a job brings many important benefits, including: providing a source of income, improving social inclusion, fulfilling one's own aspirations, building self-esteem and developing skills and competencies. In Portugal, around 69% of the working-age population aged 15 to 64 has a paid job. This figure is the same as the OECD average.\n\nUnemployed persons are defined as those who are not currently working but are willing to do so and actively searching for work. Long-term unemployment can have a large negative effect on feelings of well-being and self-worth and result in a loss of skills, further reducing employability. In Portugal, the percentage of the labour force that has been unemployed for a year or longer is currently at 2.3%, higher than the OECD average of 1.3%.\n\nThe wages and other monetary benefits that come with employment are an important aspect of job quality. Portuguese people earn USD 28 410 per year on average, much less than the OECD average of USD 49 165.\n\nAnother essential factor of employment quality is job security, in terms of expected loss of earnings when someone becomes unemployed. This includes how likely you are to lose your job, how long you are likely to remain unemployed and how much financial assistance you can expect from government. Workers facing a high risk of job loss are more vulnerable, especially in countries with smaller social safety nets. In Portugal, workers face an expected 8.1% loss of earnings if they become unemployed, much higher than the OECD average of 5.1%.\n\nFor more information on estimates and years of reference, see FAQ section and BLI database.\n\nBetter Policies for Better Lives\n\nJobs for innovation and productivity\n\nThe Portuguese economy contracted in 2011-13 in the wake of the global financial crisis. However, GDP is forecast to grow in real terms in 2014. The government has taken significant action to restore the sustainability of public finances and restart growth. On-going reforms aim to improve product and labour market regulation, upgrade education and skills, and enhance innovation.\n\nInnovation also has a major role to play in boosting productivity. Portugal’s business environment is very conducive to entrepreneurship, although provision of venture capital is at the median of OECD countries. Various initiatives support business innovation, entrepreneurship and SMEs. +Innovation +Industry is a new investment programme addressed to small firms and entrepreneurs in traditional business sectors. +Innovation +Industry aims to promote business spin-offs and innovation capacity by providing access to a Venture Capital Funds, business accelerators for internationalisation and coaching for business development. SIFIDE provides fixed and incremental tax credits for R&D and supports the hiring of doctoral-level graduates in companies. In 2013, the government launched INOVA, Creative Youngsters: Entrepreneurs for the 21st century programme to develop an environment that favours innovation and creativity in primary and secondary schools. The programme seeks to foster youngsters' analytical capabilities and the mind-sets needed to identify business opportunities, take risks and face competition.\n\nMore Resources\n\nHow's Life?: Measuring Well-being OECD Job Quality Database\n\nKey Findings\n\nA well-educated and well-trained population is essential for a country's social and economic well-being. Education plays a key role in providing individuals with the knowledge, skills and competences needed to participate effectively in society and in the economy. Having a good education greatly improves the likelihood of finding a job and earning enough money. The Portuguese can expect to go through 17 years of education between the ages of 5 and 39, similar to the OECD average of 18 years.\n\nGraduating from upper secondary education has become increasingly important in all countries, as the skills needed in the labour market are becoming more knowledge-based. High-school graduation rates therefore provide a good indication of whether a country is preparing its students to meet the minimum requirements of the job market. In Portugal, 55% of adults aged 25-64 have completed upper secondary education, much lower than the OECD average of 79%.\n\nBut graduation rates, while important, speak little to the quality of education received. The OECD's Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA) reviews the extent to which students have acquired some of the knowledge and skills that are essential for full participation in modern societies. In 2018, PISA focused on examining students' reading ability, skills in maths and level in sciences, as research shows that these skills are more reliable predictors of economic and social well-being than the number of years spent in school.\n\nThe average student in Portugal scored 492 in reading literacy, maths and sciences, above the OECD average of 488. The best-performing school systems manage to provide high-quality education to all students.\n\nBetter Policies for Better Lives\n\n“School clusters” for better results across regions\n\nShortcomings in Portugal’s education system were brought to light following the OECD’s Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA) results in 2000. Key challenges were concentrated in primary schools in rural areas, and in town and cities, many schools were overcrowded putting stress on teachers. Limited resources and strain on schools resulted in many disadvantaged students in repeating grades and even dropping out of school.\n\nSweeping reforms soon followed after a national debate on how to best address the needs of students and teachers. Among the most successful was the creation of school clusters which bring between 5-10 schools together under a single educational project. Working together, the Ministry of Education and municipalities create clusters considering unique characteristics specific to school sizes, student needs, as well as geographical and demographic factors. By broadening the number of available staff and facilities, school clusters have helped improve the services and support available to students.\n\nMore Resources\n\nHow's Life?: Measuring Well-being\n\nKey Findings\n\nThe quality of our local living environment has a direct impact on our health and well-being. Outdoor air pollution is one important environmental issue that directly affects the quality of people's lives. Despite national and international interventions and decreases in major pollutant emissions, the health impacts of urban air pollution continue to worsen, with air pollution set to become the top environmental cause of premature mortality globally by 2050. Air pollution in urban centres, often caused by transport and the use of small-scale burning of wood or coal, is linked to a range of health problems, from minor eye irritation to upper respiratory symptoms in the short-term and chronic respiratory diseases such as asthma, cardiovascular diseases and lung cancer in the long-term. Children and the elderly may be particularly vulnerable.\n\nPM2.5 – tiny particulate matter small enough to be inhaled into the deepest part of the lung – is monitored in OECD countries because it can harm human health and reduce life expectancy. In Portugal, PM2.5 levels are 8.3 micrograms per cubic meter, below the OECD average of 14 micrograms per cubic meter and below than the annual guideline limit of 10 micrograms per cubic meter set by the World Health Organization.\n\nAccess to clean water is fundamental to human well-being. Despite significant progress in OECD countries in reducing water pollution, improvements in freshwater quality are not always easy to discern. In Portugal, 89% of people say they are satisfied with water quality, higher than the OECD average of 84%.\n\nBetter Policies for Better Lives\n\nCompare your water services\n\nThe Water and Waste Services Regulation Authority launched a mobile app in 2014 to provide users with better information about water and waste services. The app lets citizens compare their services with those in 278 other municipalities across Portugal. They can also find information about how to reduce their own water consumption and waste production. This gives users the tools they need to demand better services from low performing operators and improve their general knowledge to make better environmental choices. By publicising poor performance and educating the public the app pressures operators to improve their services. The introduction of benchmarks has also incentivised improve efficiency and services.\n\nMore Resources\n\nHow's Life?: Measuring Well-being OECD Environmental Outlook to 2050\n\nKey Findings\n\nTrust in government is essential for social cohesion and well-being. High voter turnout is a measure of citizens' participation in the political process. In the most recent elections for which data are available, voter turnout in Portugal was 49% of those registered. This figure is one of the lowest rates in the OECD, where average turnout is 69%.\n\nBroader public engagement in the decision-making process is also important for holding the government to account and maintaining confidence in public institutions. The formal process for public engagement in developing laws and regulations is one way to measure the extent to which people can become involved in government decisions on key issues that affect their lives. In Portugal, the level of stakeholder engagement in developing regulations is 1.5 (on a scale between 0 and 4); lower than the OECD average of 2.1.\n\nFor more information on estimates and years of reference, see FAQ section and BLI database.\n\nBetter Policies for Better Lives\n\nCitizen shops for better services\n\nPortugal has built a network of local \"citizen shops\" which offer public and private services. These range from public social security and tax services to private services such as arranging the connecting and disconnecting of electricity, water and gas or cable television subscriptions. In one single place, citizens have access to a wide range of services with longer opening hours and can save considerable amounts of time.\n\nSome second generation citizen shops offer counters organised around common life events, such as the \"I lost my wallet\" service, \"having a child\" service or housing-related services as well as multi-service counters.\n\nThe citizen shops cover the whole country with shops in most district capitals, and have greatly improved the efficiency and quality of services provided to citizens.\n\nThe Citizen Map is an online platform, adapted for mobiles, that provides location information for all public service locations. Users can use the map to search and find the closest location of a public service. The information contained within the map is also stored and made available at the Portuguese Open Data portal.\n\nMore Resources\n\nHow's Life?: Measuring Well-being Regulatory Policy Outlook: Portugal"
