        "text": "Its distinctive design incorporates historical and cultural elements, such as the five chevrons that represent the five Moorish kings defeated by King Afonso Henriques at Batalha de Ourique and symbolize the divine protection granted to Portugal during difficult times. In addition, the shield bears the armillary sphere, a symbol of the Age of Discovery and Portugal's role as a maritime and exploratory power in the XV and XVI centuries. Finally, the mural crown that surrounds the shield is a symbol of the country's sovereignty and independence.\n\nElements of the Portuguese Escudo: The five chevrons of Portugal\n\nThe five chevrons symbolize the five Moorish kings defeated by King Afonso Henriques at the Batalha de Ourique in 1139 and the dots inside the chevrons represent the five wounds of Christ inflicted during his crucifixion.\n\nThis emblem was adopted in Portugal during the reign of Afonso Henriques in the XII century as a way of thanking God for the protection granted during the Christian Reconquest of the Iberian Peninsula against the Moors. Since then, the five chevrons have been an essential element of Portuguese heraldry, representing faith, divine protection, and the country's national identity.\n\nSymbols of the Portuguese flag: The armillary sphere\n\nThe armillary sphere is a symbol that dates back to the Age of Discovery, highlighting maritime and exploratory prowess in the XV and XVI centuries. It was adopted as the official symbol of Portugal during the reign of Dom Manuel I, around the end of the XV century.\n\nIts complex and intriguing shape reflects the advanced Portuguese cartographic and naval knowledge of the time. Its symbolism transcends maritime conquests, evoking the constant search for new horizons and discoveries, thus praising the nation's historical and cultural legacy.\n\nThe mural crown: A historical symbol\n\nThe mural crown symbolizes a country's sovereignty and independence. It originated from the Roman tradition of rewarding the first soldier to climb the walls of a fortress.\n\nNowadays, the mural crown defines the category of the town or municipality and is made of silver with five apparent towers for cities, four for towns, and three for other parishes. The crown of arms of Lisbon, the country's capital, is the only gold one with five apparent towers.\n\nThe Portuguese Escudo is not just a symbol, but a living emblem of the soul of a resilient and persevering nation. It is a proud reminder of the epic journey, an inspiration for future generations, and a tangible manifestation of the fundamental values that unite the Portuguese people through our collection.\n\nJewelry with Portugal: symbols present in traditional jewelry\n\nOur collections feature pieces inspired by the iconic Portuguese Escudo, reflecting the country's history and culture. With elegance and sophistication, the accessories, which include earrings, bracelets, necklaces, and rings, are made with high-quality silver and meticulous design, making each piece special and worthy of being a lasting symbol of Portuguese heritage.\n\nTo expand your options, we also offer a \"SÃ­mbolos Portugueses\" collection that hides a unique meaning in each piece, tracing the DNA of the country's collective soul.\n\nJewelry inspired by the Portuguese Escudo\n\nInspiration for the tangible symbols of Portuguese history and tradition has reinforced the creation of jewelry as a way of remembering and valuing the milestones in Portugal's history.\n\nIt is in this spirit of respect for tradition that our unisex \"Escudo\" collection stands out, launched in partnership with Ana Moura.\n\nThe Cross of Christ\n\nOffer something memorable that can add a special, personalized touch to the occasion.
