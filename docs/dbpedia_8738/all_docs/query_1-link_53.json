        "text": "Lisbon › Travel Tips for Lisbon\n\nMoney\n\nCurrency\n\nThe official currency of Portugal is the euro. Tourists who are not familiar with this currency must keep in mind the subunits refer to 1, 2, 5, 10, 20 and 50 cents, and they come in coins. Coins also refer to 1 and 2 euro coins. Banknotes refer to 5, 10, 20, 50, 100, 200 and 500 euro bills.\n\nCurrency exchange\n\nBanks understandably offer the best exchange rates. The highest density of banks can be spotted in the Baixa district. As a rule, they open Monday to Friday, roughly speaking between 8.30am and 3pm. 24-hour a day money exchange solutions are offered by the exchange desks located at the airport and the Santa Apolonia station. Most high rated hotels also provide currency exchange services, but their rates are highly disadvantageous for clients. Tourists can also turn to the post offices in Lisbon in order to exchange money. ATMs are also at hand to this purpose.\n\nCommunications\n\nPost offices\n\nIn Lisbon there are tens of post offices scattered throughout the city. They are easily identifiable, given they are marked by a red sign reading “Correios” in Portuguese. Generally speaking, the post offices open weekdays between 8am and 10pm. The main post office is the one located in Praca dos Restauradores. On top of the specific postal services, these offices are also available for money exchange transactions. In order to learn more about the whereabouts, the services and the opening hours of each of these offices, visit CTT (Correios de Portugal).\n\nTelephones\n\nLisbon is dotted with public phone booths from where tourists can make calls to virtually all corners of the world. These phones work with prepaid cards which can be bought from newspaper stands, post offices and hotels’ reception desks.\n\nIn order to call from abroad to a landline network in Lisbon, one must first dial the country code (00351), and then enter the region code (21) and eventually the phone number proper, which usually consists of 7 digits.\n\nConnection to the Internet\n\nHigh and medium rated hotels include the access to the Internet in the range of services provided to their guests. But hotels aside, tourists can always turn to the services provided by the Internet cafes scattered throughout Lisbon. The following is the list of the best rated venues which offer Internet services:\n\nCib@rcafe\n\nName:\n\nCib@rcafe\n\nAddress:\n\nPavillhao do Conhecimento, Ciencia Viva Parque das Nacoes, Lisbon, Portugal\n\nTelephone:\n\n00351 218 917138\n\nCiber Chiado\n\nName:\n\nCiber Chiado\n\nAddress:\n\nLargo do Picadeiro, Lisbon, Portugal\n\nTelephone:\n\n00351 213 466722\n\nCiberoceanos\n\nName:\n\nCiberoceanos\n\nAddress:\n\nLoja G 109 A, Avenida D.

It’s true plenty of tourism-related venues have staffs trained to speak English (or other foreign languages, for that matter), but knowing a bit of Portuguese is definitely an advantage, not necessarily in terms of orientation as much as in managing to blend in and actually sample the characteristic charm of the place.\n\nTime zone\n\nGMT (summer time: one hour ahead of GMT)\n\nTourist information offices\n\nIn Lisbon there are several tourist information offices visitors can rely on in order to find out the tourist essentials of the city. The most important of all is the so-called Lisbon Welcome Center, which is located in Rua do Arsenal. Such offices can also be spotted in the surroundings of Lisbon.\n\nCustoms regulations\n\nEuropean Union citizens are allowed to bring in or out of Portugal no more than 800 cigarettes, 200 cigars, 1 kilogram of tobacco, 10 liters of spirits, 90 liters of wine, provided that these amounts are for personal use. Non-European citizens are not allowed to import or exports more than 200 cigarettes, 50 cigars, and 250 grams of tobacco, 1 liter of spirits and 4 liters of wine. Regardless of nationality, tourists are not allowed to bring in more than about 5,000 euros, nor are they allowed to export more than 10,000 euros.\n\nEntry documents\n\nEuropean Union citizens only need a valid identification card in order to enter Portugal. Passports are necessary for nationals of countries outside the European Union. Visas are required for non-European citizens who plan to stay in Portugal for more than 90 days. Again, depending on nationality, tourists might also be required to hold a visa regardless of the duration of their stay in Portugal.\n\nElectricity\n\nIn Portugal, sockets are designed according to the European standards (two-pin sockets) and they are supplied with 220 / 380 volts. Appliances requiring American-type plugs must be used with adapter plugs.\n\nTap water\n\nTap water in Lisbon is perfectly safe to drink. Tourists unfamiliar with the taste of the running water Lisbon is supplied with can always drink bottled water, which is not expensive at all and gives visitors an extra feel of safety.\n\nGo to top"
