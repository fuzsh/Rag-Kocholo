        "text": "They say learning a language can take you places, but did you know just how many countries you can go to when you learn French?\n\nWhether youâre just getting started with the ABCs in French or are already an intermediate speaker and want to put your language chops to the test, you may wonder: where do people actually speak French in the world?\n\nJust as English is a global language, French is also spoken far and wide, including in many places that you may not have imagined. After English, French is used as the national language of more countries than any other language globally.\n\nThat means that if you speak English and French, you will be able to speak the two most international languages! Talk about becoming a world citizen, huh?\n\nBesides France, French is spoken in dozens of countries in every single continent in the world. Thanks to French speaking countries, French Overseas Territories, and speakers of French as a foreign language, you can feel rest assured that speaking French is a skill that will come in handy all around the world.\n\nReady to learn just how massive the Francosphere is? Letâs get into it!\n\nHow many French speaking countries are there in the world?\n\nFormally, 29 countries use French as the national or official language. Additionally, France has 11 Overseas Territories, which are administrative subdivisions of France outside of the mainland. These are similar to what Puerto Rico is to the United States.\n\nThese countries and regions are spread out all over the globe, with at least one in each of the following regions:\n\nAfrica\n\nThe Caribbean\n\nEurope\n\nNorth America\n\nSouth America\n\nThe Caribbean\n\nOceania\n\nAnd, if you include countries where French is used as an administrative language (a step-down from the official language), you can add Laos and Cambodia, which get you francophone countries in every single continent!\n\nFrench speaking countries\n\nAt this point, you might be dying to find out exactly which countries speak French. If youâre studying French online or at home, it may be hard to visualize just how many countries speak French.\n\nTo make the list more manageable, weâll break down the countries that speak French by continent or region. Weâll also provide you with more information about each country, such as its population, flag, and capital.\n\nThat way, youâll more easily understand the true extent of the French language worldwide. If youâre familiar with French slang, seeing the geographic reach of the language may help you put things into perspective. Geographic diversity usually translates into linguistic diversity when it comes to language, and how could this not be the case with so many different cultures using French to communicate?\n\nThe data in the following sections are taken from the Organisation Internationale de la Francophonie and Laval University in QuÃ©bec.\n\nWithout further ado, letâs get started with our French speaking countries list!\n\nFrench speaking countries of Africa\n\nAfrica is â by far â the continent with the most countries that speak French. Itâs also the continent with the most French speakers. Oh, and the most populous country that uses French as its national language? Thatâs in Africa too.\n\nIn fact, French has become somewhat of a lingua franca in most of Eastern Africa. Whereas countries in Northern Africa tend to use Arabic as lingua franca, countries in Central Africa use Swahili, and countries in Southern Africa use English, most of the East uses French.\n\nHere are the 21 African countries that use French as a national or official language.\n\nCountryFlagCapitalPopulationPercentage of the population who speak French Beninð§ð¯Porto-Novo12,785,00033.68% Burkina Fasoð§ð«Ouagadougou22,103,00024.45% Burundið§ð®Gitega12,625,0008.51% Cameroonð¨ð²YaoundÃ©27,912,00067.0% Central African Republicð¨ð«Bangui5,017,00028.60% Chadð¹ð©N'Djamena17,414,00012.91% CÃ´te d'Ivoireð¨ð®Yamoussoukro27,742,00033.61% Comorosð°ð²Moroni907,00026.13% Congoð¨ð¬Brazzaville5,798,00060.68% Congo, Democratic republic ofð¨ð©Kinshasa95,241,00051.37% Djiboutið©ð¯Djibouti1,016,00050.0% Equatorial Guineað¬ð¶Malabo1,497,00028.92% Gabonð¬ð¦Libreville2,332,00065.14% Guineað¬ð³Conakry13,866,00027.24% Madagascarð²ð¬Antananarivo29,178,00026.49% Malið²ð±Bamako21,474,00017.24% Nigerð³ðªNiamey26,084,00012.89% Rwandað·ð¼Kigali13,600,0005.83% Senegalð¸ð³Dakar17,654,00026.28% Seychellesð¸ð¨Victoria99,00053.54% Togoð¹ð¬LomÃ©8,681,00040.94%\n\nFrench speaking countries of Europe\n\nOf course, we all know French is spoken in France.

QuÃ©bec, the largest territory of Canada, speaks almost exclusively French with over 93% of its population being able to speak the language. New Brunswick also has a significant French speaking population, with 42% of residents being able to speak it.\n\nCountryFlagCapitalPopulationPercentage of the population who speak French Canadað¨ð¦Ottawa38,694,00028.59%\n\nFrench speaking countries of the Caribbean\n\nYou might be surprised to learn that there is only one country in the Caribbean that uses French as its national language.

Well, those are all Overseas France, which means they are technically French territory!\n\nCountryFlagCapitalPopulationPercentage of the population who speak French Haitið­ð¹Port-au-Prince11,680,00042.0%\n\nFrench speaking countries of Oceania\n\nYep, French is spoken even all the way in Oceania! Australia and New Zealand are commonly referred to as âthe Antipodes,â which means the point on Earth that is the diametrical opposite of where you are. In this case, Oceania in general is the antipode of Europe. So, yeah, French somehow made it all the way to the antipode of France!\n\nCountryFlagCapitalPopulationPercentage of the population who speak French Vanuatuð»ðºPort Vila322,00031.06%\n\nFrench Overseas Territories where French is spoken\n\nAs mentioned earlier, France has significant overseas territories that are considered French soil for all intents and purposes. Most of these territories have their own senators, and up until recently had their own representation at the European Parliament. So, even though they arenât sovereign nations, they should count as countries for our purposes.\n\nTerritoryFlagContinentPopulationPercentage of the population who speak French French Guianað¬ð«South America294,43666.23% Guadeloupeð¬ðµCaribbean384,23987.45% Martiniqueð²ð¶Caribbean364,50883.13% Mayotteð¾ð¹Africa299,34851.78% RÃ©unionð·ðªAfrica868,84687.82% French Polynesiaðµð«Oceania279,30099.53% Saint BarthÃ©lemyð§ð±Caribbean9,96190.0% Saint Martinð¸ð½Caribbean32,48998.49% Saint Pierre and Miquelonðµð²North America6,000100.0% Wallis and Futunað¼ð«Oceania11,55877.87% New Caledoniað³ð¨Oceania271,40766.62%\n\nWhere else is French spoken where itâs not an official language?\n\nJust because French isnât an official language of a country doesnât mean that it isnât widely spoken. There are many countries around the world with a significant francophone population.

Even if a country doesnât have any significant ties to France or the former French Empire, itâs still very common for people to choose to study French as a foreign language. The countries in the table below all have at least half a million French speakers.\n\nCountryFlagCapitalContinentPopulationNumber of people who speak French Egyptðªð¬CairoAfrica106,157,0003,205,000 Vietnamð»ð³HanoiAsia98,954,000693,000 Polandðµð±WarsawEurope37,730,000947,000 Greeceð¬ð·AthensEurope10,317,000754,000 Israelð®ð±JerusalemAsia8,923,000528,000 Russiað·ðºMoscowEurope/Asia145,806,000629,000United Statesðºð¸Washington, D.C.North America334,805,0002,179,000 Swedenð¸ðªStockholmEurope10,219,000845,000\n\nHow many people in the world speak French?\n\nAs of 2022, there are over 321 million French speakers all over the world. Perhaps surprisingly, fewer than 100 million of them speak French as their native language. This makes French one of the languages with the most non-native speakers in relation to native speakers!\n\nThere are two main reasons why this happens. First, there are many countries that use French as one of the official languages. This means there are multiple official languages within a country, and French becomes the lingua franca.\n\nSecond, French is one of the most popular languages to learn worldwide! Perhaps it's due to the powerful influence of French culture around the world, including its cuisine, media, literature, and arts. Or perhaps thereâs something intrinsically appealing in French. Either way, students all over the globe canât get enough of French!\n\nWhat are the countries with the most French speakers?\n\nUnsurprisingly, France is the country with the most French speakers worldwide. But can you guess which countries follow? Maybe Canada, Belgium, or Switzerland? Nope! Check out our table below to find out which are the five countries with the most French speakers in the world (the last one might surprise you!).\n\nCountryFlagNumber of French speakers Franceð«ð·66 million Democratic Republic of Congoð¨ð©48.9 million Algeriað©ð¿14.9 million Moroccoð²ð¦13.4 million Germanyð©ðª12.3 million\n\nHow French became a global language\n\nAfter getting through this article, you may be wondering just how French became such a global phenomenon.\n\nOf course, English is the current global language in part thanks to the massive English-speaking economies of the US, the UK, Australia, Canada, and other countries with significant anglophiles like India, Nigeria, and the Philippines. So, how did France manage to make its language so global?\n\nWell, there are quite a few reasons. Letâs get into some of the most important ones.\n\nInfluence within Europe\n\nOne of the first instances of French being used outside of France was in the 11th century, much before the French even began thinking about exploring the world outside of Europe. The English aristocracy adopted French for official and legal use within the English court system and upper society. In fact, French was used in English legislation until the Proceedings in Courts of Justice Act of 1730, which replaced French and Latin with English as the official language of the English courts.\n\nKeep in mind that this was a time when Latin dominated Europe. Virtually all scientific, academic, and political discourse across Medieval Europe was carried out in Latin. That is, of course, until French replaced Latin as the European lingua franca for international treaties.\n\nIt all started with the Peace of Westphalia Treaty, which marked the end of the Eight Yearsâ War. This was the first international document of major significance that was written entirely in French. After this, French started to slowly supplant Latin as the most important lingua franca in Europe.\n\nFast-forward a few centuries (and a handful of Napoleonic Wars), and French had become the most important language among the educated all across Europe by the 19th century. Even the Russian nobility spoke French, with Prince Dmitry Golitsyn famously speaking terrible Russian with a thick French accent.\n\nFrench colonization\n\nOutside of Europe, French became an important language because of French colonization. The French Empire was at one point the second-largest empire in the world and still remains one of the largest empires in the history of humanity.\n\nAs the French Empire grew, so did the reach of the French language all over the world. France ended up having over 60 colonies in every corner of the Earth. Most former colonies still have significant French speaking populations today, and some still use French as the national language.\n\nAs discussed earlier, some of the remnants of the French Empire were incorporated into France as Overseas Territories, so the impact and influence of Franceâs colonial ambitions can still be felt today.\n\nBelgian colonization\n\nDespite France having a much bigger empire, we cannot forget about the Belgian Empire and its influence on the Francosphere. Despite not being nearly as far-reaching, the Belgian Empire did establish colonies in Africa, Asia, and North America.\n\nBy far, the most significant linguistic consequence of the Belgian Empire is the francophonie in the Democratic Republic of Congo. As mentioned earlier in this article, the D.R. Congo is the most populous French speaking country. Not only that, but its population is expected to more than triple to 360 million people by the year 2099.\n\nSo, it turns out Belgium is actually responsible for the largest French speaking country today!\n\nFrench diplomacy\n\nFrance has historically made strides to institutionalize and internationalize French as a language. Starting with the AcadÃ©mie FranÃ§aise in 1635, France has done more than any other country to preserve and disseminate its language.\n\nToday, the Alliance FranÃ§aise is the organization in charge of promoting French culture and language all over the world. With close to a thousand institutes in over 130 countries worldwide, Alliance FranÃ§aise centers are places where students can watch French movies, borrow or purchase French books, and learn more about the French language and French culture.\n\nThe success of Alliance FranÃ§aise is hard to be overstated, as it is the oldest and largest of all European language institutes, including the British Council, the Goethe Institute, and the Cervantes Institute.\n\nOfficial language of international organizations\n\nFinally, French is an official language of many important international organizations. This ensures that French stays relevant for international actors today.\n\nSome of the most important organizations in which French is an official or working language are:\n\nThe United Nations\n\nThe World Trade Organization\n\nUNESCO\n\nThe European Union\n\nThe International Court of Justice\n\nNATO\n\nThe International Red Cross\n\nThe International Olympic Committee\n\nAnd many, many more!\n\nThe future of the French language\n\nWith Franceâs deep history, itâs easy to think of French as a dying (or waning, at best) language. However, this couldnât be further from the truth. In fact, Forbes called French the language of the future!\n\nBy 2065, French is expected to have over one billion speakers. Thatâs more than triple the current number of French speakers in a matter of fewer than 50 years! If these predictions are accurate, then French will displace Spanish and Arabic in terms of total number of speakers.\n\nThis growth is largely due to the developing francophone countries, which are expected to grow tremendously over the next few decades. In particular, Africa â where French is one of the three lingua franca along with English and Arabic â is expected to experience a population boom unlike anything ever seen before.\n\nAs of 2022, there are 1,406,722,629 people living in Africa. By 2065, it is expected that there will be 3,108,925,401 people. Thatâs more than twice the current population and a net gain of over one and half billion people!\n\nThis is where most of the growth in global francophones will come from. As francophone African countries like D.R. Congo, Cameroon, and Madagascar double or even triple their population over the next few decades, the use of French will continue to increase worldwide.\n\nFAQs about countries that speak French\n\nIs French still useful worldwide?\n\nOf course! In addition to being an official language of 29 countries around the world, French is an extremely useful language to learn for business or otherwise. Bloomberg ranked French as the third most useful language for business, only after English and Mandarin.\n\nFrench is also ranked as the third most powerful language by the Power Language Index. Again, French is third only after English and Mandarin. The index takes into account geography, economy, communication, media, and diplomacy.\n\nIs French or Spanish more useful?\n\nIn general, French is more useful than Spanish as itâs considered to be a better language for business and a more powerful language according to the Power Language Index. However, Spanish could be more useful for you depending on where you live. If you live in the United States, then learning Spanish will almost undoubtedly be more helpful than French.\n\nWhat country has the best French accent?\n\nMetropolitan French â also known as Parisian French â is generally considered to be the best French accent. That is because itâs considered to be standard or âaccentlessâ French. Of course, whether or not Metropolitan French is the best accent or not ultimately depends on who you ask!\n\nIf youâre trying to find the best French accent for learners, then the Southern French accent may be what youâre looking for. People in the South of France tend to speak much more slowly and clearly than Parisians, making them easier to understand for foreign language learners.\n\nIs African French different from French from France?\n\nAfrican French is entirely based on standard French. However, with over 20 different countries in Africa using French as an official language, it is only natural for African French to vary somewhat from Metropolitan French.\n\nAnd thatâs part of what makes French such a fun language! With dozens of countries using French as a national language, you can imagine how much fun slang there is! Luckily, you donât have to imagine itâjust check out our blog with 275 French slang words and phrases!\n\nKeep up with the Francosphere\n\nHopefully, this blog has helped inspire you to continue or begin learning French! Now that youâre aware of all the places French can take you, whatâs stopping you from jumping headfirst into your next French lesson?"
