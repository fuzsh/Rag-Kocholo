        "text": "Portugal, like most European Union member countries, uses the Euro as its official currency. This shared currency simplifies travel across the region and eliminates the need for complex currency exchanges. Here's a quick guide to using Euros in Portugal:\n\nWhile you can exchange Indian Rupees (INR) for Euros at banks or currency exchange offices in Portugal, the rates might not be the most favorable. Consider exchanging some INR to EUR before your trip, especially for smaller initial expenses upon arrival.\n\nTipping is not mandatory in Portugal, but it is a common courtesy to leave a small gratuity (around 10%) at restaurants if you are satisfied with the service. Rounding up the bill to the nearest euro is also acceptable."
