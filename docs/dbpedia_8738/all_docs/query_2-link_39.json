        "text": "Contact the embassy of Portugal at 202-350-5400 for the most current visa information.\n\nPortugal is a party to the Schengen Agreement and part of the European Union.\n\nTraveling Through Europe: If you are planning to visit or travel through European countries, you should be familiar with the requirements of the Schengen Agreement.\n\nU.S. citizens may enter Portugal for up to 90 days for tourism or business without a visa.\n\nYour passport should be valid for at least three months beyond the period of stay. If you plan on transiting a Schengen country, review our U.S. Travelers in Europe page.\n\nYou will need sufficient proof of funds and a return plane ticket.\n\nFor information about visas for the Schengen area, see the Schengen Visa page.\n\nIf you are not staying in a hotel or a similar tourist accommodation, you are required to register your presence in Portugal with the Portuguese Immigration Service (SEF) within three working days of entering Portugal. You must download a declaration of entry form (declaracão de entrada) from SEF's website and personally submit it to the nearest SEF office within three business days of entry. Failure to comply with these requirements will result in an administrative offense punishable with a fine from €60 to €160.\n\nUnder Portuguese Immigration law, foreign minors under 18 years of age entering or exiting Portugal must possess an authorization letter of parental consent to travel, if travelling with adults other than their parent(s) or legal guardian. The document must be signed and dated, with the signature(s) certified by a notary. The letter of parental consent to travel must include the dates and reason for travel and the details about the adult responsible for the child. More information here.\n\nFind additional information on traveling with minors on the Portuguese Immigration Service webpage.\n\nHIV/AIDS Restrictions: The U.S. Department of State is unaware of any HIV/AIDS entry restrictions for visitors to or foreign residents of Portugal.\n\nFind information on dual nationality, prevention of international child abduction and customs regulations on our websites.\n\nCredible information indicates terrorist groups continue plotting possible near-term attacks in Europe. All European countries, including Portugal, remain potentially vulnerable to attacks from transnational terrorist organizations. U.S. citizens are reminded to remain vigilant with regard to their personal security.\n\nCrime: Crimes of opportunity, such as pickpocketing and purse snatching, particularly at popular tourist sites, restaurants, and on public transportation, are common. Pickpockets take advantage of crowds getting on and off all forms of public transportation, such as the popular Tram 28, using the jostling of the crowd as a distraction. Avoid standing near the doors on public transportation, as thieves will often strike just as the train/bus doors open and then dash onto the platform and disappear into the crowd.\n\nSafeguard your passport and identity documents when traveling throughout Portugal. Foreigners who arrive in Portugal without a valid passport will not be permitted to enter and will be returned to their point of origin.\n\nBe aware of your surroundings and take personal security measures to stay safe. Thefts of backpacks, electronics and luggage occur regularly. Do not leave valuables in rental cars, especially those with stickers identifying the vehicle as a rental car. Tourists are frequent victims of petty crime/car break-ins.\n\nAvoid using automatic teller machines (ATMs) in isolated or poorly lit areas. Use the buddy system and indoor bank ATMs when possible. Leave extra cash, credit cards, and personal documents at home or in a hotel safe.\n\nKeep doors and windows of private rentals locked at all times, taking extra care if easily accessed from the street or other places.\n\nIllicit drug transactions increase at night, and travelers are often approached by drug dealers in the downtown area of Lisbon, especially near the bars and restaurants. Some travelers have reported incidents in which criminals used drugs to assault or rob them. Use caution when accepting open drinks at bars or clubs, and do not leave drinks unattended.\n\nAlways use a taxi from the queue or kiosk. Do not go with someone who walks up to you and offers a ride. If you have called a ride sharing service such as Uber, confirm that the car information in the App matches the vehicle you are entering.\n\nTourists should not leave personal items or valuables unattended while at the beach.\n\nReports of thefts from rental homes and online rental apartments have increased. Secure belongings and lock windows while away or sleeping.\n\nDemonstrations occur in Portugal. They may take place in response to political or economic issues, on politically significant holidays, and during international events.\n\nEven demonstrations intended to be peaceful can turn confrontational and possibly become violent.\n\nAvoid areas around protests and demonstrations.\n\nCheck local media for updates and traffic advisories.\n\nInternational Financial Scams: See the Department of State and the FBI pages for information.\n\nVictims of Crime: Local authorities are responsible for investigating and prosecuting crimes. Report crimes to the local police at 112 (National Emergency Number) and contact the U.S. Embassy at +(351) (21) 770-2122 or the emergency after-hours telephone: +(351) (21)-770-2122 or +(351) (21) 727-3300.\n\nU.S. citizen victims of sexual assault should seek medical attention if needed and are encouraged to contact the U.S. Embassy for assistance.\n\nFor social welfare emergencies such as domestic violence or child abuse, dial the National Social Emergency Line - 144. English-speaking operators are available.\n\nSee our webpage on help for U.S. victims of crime overseas.\n\nWe can:\n\nhelp you find appropriate medical care\n\nassist you in reporting a crime to the police\n\ncontact relatives or friends with your written consent\n\nexplain the local criminal justice process in general terms\n\nprovide a list of local attorneys\n\nprovide information on victim’s compensation programs in the United States\n\nprovide information about a Portuguese victim assistance program, administered through an organization known by its acronym “APAV”\n\nprovide an emergency loan for repatriation to the United States and/or limited medical support in cases of destitution\n\nhelp you find accommodation and arrange flights home\n\nreplace a stolen or lost passport\n\nDomestic Violence: U.S. citizen victims of domestic violence may contact the Embassy for assistance. Additionally, Portugal has an “SOS” immigrant line with English-speaking operators who are ready to help you in case of emergency. You may contact them at +351 808 257 257 between the hours of 8:30 a.m. and 8:30 p.m.\n\nTourism: The tourism industry is generally regulated and rules regarding best practices and safety inspections are regularly enforced. Hazardous areas/activities are identified with appropriate signage, and professional staff is typically on hand in support of organized activities. In the event of an injury, appropriate medical treatment is widely available throughout the country. Outside of a major metropolitan center, it may take more time for first responders and medical professionals to stabilize a patient and provide life-saving assistance. U.S. citizens are encouraged to purchase medical evacuation insurance.\n\nNatural Disasters: In the event of a natural disaster or other widespread emergency, travelers can monitor the Portuguese Civil Protection Authority’s website at Prociv.pt for the latest information. All U.S. citizens living or traveling in Portugal should also monitor local news reports, follow directions from local officials, and take appropriate action needed. Additionally, information about areas in Portugal impacted by any events can be found at: http://www.prociv.pt/en-us/SITUACAOOPERACIONAL/Pages/ocorrenciassignificativas.aspx.\n\nWe recommend all Americans enroll in the Smart Traveler Enrollment Program (STEP) to receive security messages, alerts, and make it easier to locate you in an emergency.\n\nCriminal Penalties: You are subject to local laws. If you violate local laws, even unknowingly, you may be expelled, arrested, or imprisoned.\n\nFilming and photographing the police or military and certain buildings in Portugal is illegal and could lead to arrest or detention.\n\nDriving under the influence of drugs or alcohol could land you in jail.\n\nPossession and/or use of narcotics and illegal drugs can result in fines, administrative penalties, mandatory drug treatment, criminal punishment, or prison, depending on type, quantity and usage.\n\nPenalties for trafficking illegal drugs are severe. Offenders can expect long jail sentences.\n\nPepper spray is illegal and will be confiscated. Persons carrying it are subject to fines or prison.\n\nPossession of unlicensed metal detectors is strictly forbidden, and persons caught with them are subject to fines.\n\nIndividuals establishing a business or practicing a profession that requires additional permits or licensing should seek information from the competent local authorities prior to practicing or operating a business.\n\nFurthermore, some U.S. laws allow criminal prosecution in the United States, regardless of where the crime was committed. For examples, see our website on crimes against minors abroad and the Department of Justice website.\n\nArrest Notification: If you are arrested or detained, ask police or prison officials to notify the U.S. Embassy immediately. Your U.S. passport will not help you avoid arrest or prosecution.\n\nSee our webpage for further information.\n\nFaith-Based Travelers: See our following webpages for details:\n\nFaith-Based Travel Information\n\nInternational Religious Freedom Report – see country reports\n\nHuman Rights Report – see country reports\n\nHajj Fact Sheet for Travelers\n\nBest Practices for Volunteering Abroad\n\nLGBTI Travelers: There are no legal restrictions on same-sex sexual relations or the organization of LGBTI events in Portugal.

Use appropriate care and caution while on the roadways, practice safe driving habits, and adhere to the applicable speed limits.\n\nTraffic Laws: It is against the law to speed, drive while under the influence of alcohol or drugs, or use a mobile phone while driving.
