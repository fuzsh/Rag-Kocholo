        "text": "I have been traveling/living internationally for most of 7 years and have used this app almost daily for all these years. When shopping I use it many times a day. I also hand it to many others as they need to understand a price in their own local currency.\n\nI love that you can easily add any currency to your exchange list and just as easily delete it when youâre no longer needing a countryâs information. You canât even move each country up-and-down on the list to make it easier to compare and see what you need as soon as you need it.\n\nI am so happy to have discovered this app in 2011!\n\nA heads-up -> Just updated to the latest version - all âsavedâ currencies are gone except for the top 7 major currencies. (..and since when has Chinese yuan become a major currency??)\n\nYouâll need to re-save your preferences and rearrange the currencies in the order you like them.\n\n_______\n\nPrevious feedback\n\n_______\n\nThey just added 2 more crypto currencies so now they track Bitcoin as well as Ethereum and Litecoin. I use this app extensively when traveling. Now I can also use it to track my crypto wallet investments.\n\nGreatly appreciated Jeff!\n\n_______\n\nThanks for listening to our feedback. The new, darker layout option is fantastic! Should be the default option as it's so much better!\n\nOther Suggestions/Comments:\n\n===> the advertisement banner at the bottom is way too close to the number \"0\". Several times now I ended up being taken to an app which is supposed to tell me \"who I'll marry?!\" while I was trying to type three zeroes. <===\n\nTo save space (so the font can become even thicker/easier to read) I'd use country name & currency name versus the possessive form of a country's name. In other words Hungary â¢ Forint versus the present Hungarian Forint. Norway â¢ Krone versus Norwegian Krone, etc. This method saves several letters (Switzerland/Swiss is the exception). It also makes country names easier to find for non-native English speakers, i.e. the majority of this app's users.\n\nI have used this app for years and years and years. It is simple, practical, absolutely reliable and in my opinion just the best out there. I think 20 bucks for a yearly subscription is very very adequately priced. Especially compared with other apps these days. But the free app is also fine and gives you almost all of the functions plus some ads. regardless of whether you choose the free or the paid $20 a year it is the best app for Currency conversion out there. And you can set widgets on your phone and that makes it even better. I love this app. Go for it."
