        "text": "The Portuguese Escudo was the official currency of Portugal before the country adopted the Euro. It was in use from 1911 to 2002.\n\nThe Portuguese Escudo was introduced after the proclamation of the Portuguese Republic in 1910. It was replaced by the Euro on January 1, 2002, when Portugal, along with several other European countries, adopted the common currency.\n\nSubunits\n\nThe Portuguese Escudo was divided into 100 centavos.\n\nCoins and Banknotes\n\nThe Portuguese Escudo had various denominations of coins and banknotes. Coins were issued in centavos and Escudos, while banknotes were issued in various denominations.\n\nEuro Adoption\n\nPortugal adopted the Euro on January 1, 2002. From this date, the Portuguese Escudo ceased to be legal tender, and all transactions switched to the Euro.\n\nSince the adoption of the Euro, the Portuguese Escudo is no longer in circulation, and any remaining banknotes and coins are considered collector's items. The Euro is now the official currency used in Portugal.\n\nExchange Rate\n\nThe exchange rate at which the Portuguese Escudo was replaced by the Euro was fixed at 1 Euro = 200.482 Portuguese Escudos."
