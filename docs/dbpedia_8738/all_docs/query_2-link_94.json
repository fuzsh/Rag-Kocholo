        "text": "If you have money to invest, Greece may be the retirement spot for you. Since 2013, this European country has offered its Greece Golden Visa, granting five-year permanent residency to anyone investing approximately $271,562 or more in local real estate. After five years you can then renew your residency (as long as you’re still invested in local property), and you can apply for citizenship after seven.\n\nTo make things more enticing, Greece’s Ministry of Finance proposed a 7% flat tax in 2020 for any foreign nationals willing to transfer their tax residence (meaning the place where you’re legally required to pay taxes) here. This means that any pensions, rental income, and other transferable investments will stay at a 7% tax rate for up to 15 years. With tax brackets in the US typically ranging from 10 to 37%, it’s a steal.\n\nRequirements: There's no requirement to invest in local real estate to take advantage of the tax rate, nor are you expected to permanently reside in Greece. Still, the overall goal is to bring in foreign dollars, so government officials hope you’ll spend accordingly. Anyone interested in utilizing Greece’s flat tax can take advantage, no matter their age. To qualify for a tax transfer, however, you can’t have paid taxes in Greece over any of the last five years. Also, the country or nation where you’re transferring your tax residence from must already have a tax agreement with Greece; the US income tax treaty with Greece qualifies, and means you won't be paying income taxes twice.\n\nCost of living is key for American retirees in Colombia, where you can live comfortably for approximately $2,000 a month. The city of Medellín, in particular, is especially popular with foreign nationals, due to such factors as year-round warm weather, excellent public transit, and an internationally recognized healthcare system.\n\nIn 2022, Colombia updated its TP—7 pensionado visa, in place since 2017, with a new M-11 pensionado visa. According to new rules, the visa is now valid for up to three years and requires the purchase of private medical insurance (private Columbian plans start at about $50 per month) for the duration of your visa. Then, after five years of living within the country, visa holders can apply for permanent residency.\n\nRequirements: Along with a clean bill of health and no criminal record, pensionado visa holders must earn at least three times Colombia's minimum wage (approximately $340 per month) in passive income, including investments. This equates to $1,020 per month, with the cost of the visa being around $325. There's no tax treaty between Colombia and the US, meaning US expats are at the risk of double taxation. However, a number of IRS tax credits, including the Foreign Tax Credit, which allows taxpayers to take any paid foreign taxes as a deduction from US taxes, can significantly assist with tax breaks.\n\nPortugal is known for its Golden Visa, which uses tax perks to attract foreign nationals. Recently, the Portuguese government has tightened rules regarding the visa scheme, due to a magnifying housing crisis. Rather than investing in real estate, expats who transfer approximately $543,070 into one or more qualifying funds—including Pela Terra, a farmland fund that focuses on regenerative agriculture projects within Portugal, and Sharing Education, which supports the country’s international school system—or pour $271,537 towards supporting the arts or preserving national heritage, qualify for the visa. You must then maintain that investment for five years (at which time you can apply for citizenship) in order to keep your Golden Visa status.\n\nAnother great option for both retirees and semi-retirees is Portugal’s D7 Passive Income Visa. This popular residency program includes the option to become a non-habitual resident (and reap the aforementioned tax benefit), as well as the ability to actually work while there, whether it’s living life as a digital nomad or being employed at a Portuguese-run business. It even allows access to the country’s extensive healthcare system. The visa is valid for two years, and then can be renewed for three more. Five years in, you can apply for permanent citizenship.\n\nRequirements: There are no age restrictions for the D7 visa, though you must demonstrate an annual passive income of at least $10,680 (plus $5,340 per adult, and $3,560 per dependent), which is equal to the country’s current minimum wage, to apply. To qualify for the Golden Visa, you can’t have paid taxes in Portugal over any of the last five years.\n\nThe official currency of Panama, the balboa, is currently equivalent in value to the US dollar, making deciphering costs easy for Americans keen on retiring here. According to an estimated count from 2020, there are also an estimated 20,000 to 30,000 American expats currently living in Panama—no surprise, since the Panama Pensionado (or Panama Retirement) visa, started in 1987, is one of the best for attracting foreign nationals.\n\nWhy? It’s all about the discounts. Think of the Panama Pensionado as the ultimate coupon book. Qualifying applicants for this permanent-residency visa receive import-tax exemptions on household goods up to $10,000 and on a new car every other year, plus substantial discounts on everything from utility bills (25%) to dental exams (15%) and transportation services (up to 30%). The full discounts list, which includes savings on hotel stays, theater performances, and even airline tickets, is available here.\n\nRequirements: Anyone 18 years of age or older can apply for the Panama Pensionado, as long as you have a proven lifetime pension or income of $1,000 per month (it’s an additional $250 per month for each dependent). If your monthly pension falls between $750 and $999 you can still qualify by purchasing local property worth at least $100,000. All applications must be submitted in Panama, and through a Panamanian lawyer.\n\nThe Philippine Retirement Authority (PRA) offers several distinct retirement options in an effort to attract foreign nationals. These range from a visa for retired armed forces officers to another for pensioners aged 35 and above who are in need of medical assistance. Each option has its own requirements, though the Special Resident Retiree’s Visa (SRRV) is the country’s overall standard.\n\nThe SRRV’s many benefits include the option to import $7,000 worth of household items into the Philippines tax-free; the ability to work, study, and buy property; and access to PhiHealth, the country’s universal health care program. Discounts at PRA-accredited businesses, complimentary assistance in navigating other government agencies, and an exemption from taxes on pension and other foreign-earned annuities are also part of the draw.\n\nRequirements: To apply for the SRRV, you must be 50 years of age or older, and have a proven pension of $800 per month (or a joint $1,000 per month for couples), along with $10,000 deposited in a Philippine bank account. If you’re 50 or older but don’t have a monthly pension, you can qualify by depositing $20,000 in a local bank account, instead.\n\nAlong with its volcanoes, freshwater lakes, and rainforests brimming with wildlife, Nicaragua lures foreign retirees with a bevy of financial incentives. These include the ability for retirees to import up to $20,000 of household goods (such as furniture, clothing, etc.) and a car up to $25,000 in value, duty-free. Another motivator: All foreign income is tax-free.\n\nThe advantages of Nicaragua’s Pensionado Residency program, which is renewable after five years, don’t end there. Once you receive a residency card, which grants retiree status (it takes up to 6 months once you’ve submitted your application), you can open a local bank account, use credit to shop, and even get a local phone plan. For those looking to build a home, retirees can also purchase up to $50,000 of construction materials tax-free.\n\nRequirements: Foreign nationals can retire in Nicaragua at the age of 45 as long as they have a permanent passive income of $650 per month (plus $150 per month for each dependent). You’re also required to spend at least 6 months (which can be non-consecutive) per year within the country to keep residency status.\n\nThis central American country has been popular with US retirees for decades, and for good reason: The country’s green environs, its laid-back way of living, and a high quality of life that includes a well-developed and supportive expat community are all incentives that make relocating here entirely worth your while. The relative ease of establishing residency is a bonus as well.\n\nCosta Rica’s pensionado visa grants temporary residency to approved applicants of any age who make a minimum income of $1,000 a month, either from a retirement fund or a permanent pension source. Once settled, most retiree couples can live well within the country for as little as $2,000 per month. This includes making a small monthly contribution (approximately 7 to 11% of your monthly pension) to Costa Rica’s universal healthcare system, the Caja Costarricense de Seguro Social, which guarantees services to all of the country’s residents.\n\nRequirements: Proof of a permanent monthly income of $1,000 is really all that’s required for retirees to obtain temporary residency in Costa Rica. Any foreign national can then apply for permanent citizenship after three years, as long as they’ve stayed in the country for four months (continuous or discontinuous) per year and renewed their visa after two years. After seven years, they can even apply for citizenship by naturalization and obtain a Costa Rican passport, without having to renounce previous nationalities. As a pensionado visa holder, temporary residents can also establish a business or work independently—just not as an employee.\n\nAnother option for retirees is the two-year inversionista visa, which requires a one-time investment of $200,000 in either an active business, real estate, stocks, or securities; or an investment of $100,000 in forest plantations. As with Colombia, there is currently no US–Costa Rica tax treaty, but the IRS tax credits will typically help expats get around any extraneous dues."
