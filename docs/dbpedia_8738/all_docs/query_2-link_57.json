        "text": "The Schengen Agreement is a treaty which led to the creation of Europe's Schengen Area, in which internal border checks have largely been abolished. It was signed on 14 June 1985 by five of the ten member states of the then European Economic Community and enacted a decade later, with all countries in the European Union (EU), except the U.K. and Ireland, joining over the coming years. Countries in Europe but outside the EU have also joined, including Switzerland, Norway, and Iceland. Britain has subsequently left the EU - meaning it is extremely unlikely to join Schengen in the foreseeable future.\n\nWhy is it called the ‘Schengen’ Area?\n\nThe name Schengen comes from the town in southeastern Luxembourg where France, Germany, Belgium, Luxembourg, and the Netherlands signed the original Schengen Agreement in 1985.\n\nWhat does it mean if I want to travel to Europe?\n\nThe agreement has abolished border checks at the signatories' common borders within the area, allowing individuals to travel freely within it. It gives residents in border areas the freedom to cross borders away from fixed checkpoints and has harmonized visa policies, meaning that for short stays of under 90 days, you can get a Schengen Visa. Under the Schengen Agreement, traveling from one country to another within the Schengen Area is done without border controls. In fact, the Schengen Visa makes it possible to visit all the countries in the Schengen Area and to cross internal borders without further formalities.\n\nPlease be aware that the European Union and the Schengen Area are two different zones. The list below will enable you to see the difference and check that the countries where you are planning to stay are all in the Schengen Area.\n\nWhat European countries are not part of the Schengen Zone?\n\nAlthough 29 countries are inside the Schengen Zone, including most nations in mainland Europe - not every European state is inside the area where border checks have been abolished. Find out the list of non-Schengen countries.\n\nDo I always need a visa to travel to the Schengen Area?\n\nSome countries have reciprocal visa-free travel arrangements with the Schengen states - including the U.K. and America. From the end of 2022, those traveling from these countries will need to apply for ETIAS authorization - an electronic document that allows for streamlined background checks and the collection of biometric information.\n\nWas the U.K. ever in the Schengen Area?\n\nThe United Kingdom was never a member of the Schengen Agreement, as it secured an opt-out that other countries did not. Similarly, while Ireland is in the EU it is not in Schengen.\n\nBefore Brexit, the U.K. was subject to European Union law and Europeans had a right to live and work in the U.K. - and vice versa. Little has changed for those outside the EU as they were subject to these laws before Brexit - and so they have to apply for a short or long stay visa accordingly to the relevant authorities.\n\nAre the Canary Islands and other Europe's overseas territories part of the Schengen Area?\n\nThe Schengen Area includes the Atlantic islands belonging to Spain and Portugal, such as the Canaries (Tenerife, Fuerteventura, Gran Canaria, Lanzarote, La Palma, La Gomera, El Hierro and La Graciosa) and Madeira. However, most overseas regions and territories are not part of the Schengen Area. For example, French Guiana, Martinique (France), Reunion (France), Guadeloupe (France), Curaçao (Netherlands), and Greenland (Denmark) are not a part of the common travel area, and may not be within the EU.\n\nHow can AXA help?\n\nAXA offers several insurance policies for travel in Europe, from a low-cost option, priced at as little as €22 ($24) per week of your trip, that will meet the Schengen Visa requirements, to multi-trip insurance that will cover you for ongoing visits. None of these policies will require you to pay an excess fee on medical costs.\n\nThose seeking a multiple-entry visa can purchase the Multi Trip insurance from €328 per year, which again covers you for expenses up to €100,000.\n\nAdditionally, AXA Schengen insurance covers, depending on the policy subscribed, the U.K. and the non-Schengen countries of the European Union, like Ireland, Romania, or Bulgaria.\n\nRelated topics on the Schengen visa\n\nHow to apply for a Schengen visa?\n\nWho needs a Schengen visa?\n\nHow to fill in a Schengen visa application form?\n\nHow much does a Schengen visa cost?\n\nWhat type of Schengen visa do I need?\n\nWhat is a Schengen business visa?\n\nWhat is a Schengen student visa?\n\nHow to visit or stay with your partner living in the Schengen area?"
