These forms of payment might be valid to be used to pay for non-Google Cloud products such as Google Play and Google Ads.\n\nCloud Billing payment methods are described in more detail in Add, remove, or update a payment method.\n\nFor more payment options than those on this page, consider working with a local reseller, who might be able to accept more forms of payment, or help you switch to invoiced billing. Find a list of resellers on the Google partners page.\n\nAbout currencies for Cloud Billing accounts\n\nEach Cloud Billing account operates in a single currency, which you cannot change after you create your Cloud Billing account. If you need a Cloud Billing account to operate in a currency different than the currency of your existing Cloud Billing account, you will need to set up a new Cloud Billing account.\n\nWhen Google charges in a local, non-USD currency, we convert Google Cloud prices from USD into the applicable local currency pursuant to the conversion rates published by leading financial institutions.\n\nThe exchange rates are set at the beginning of every month.\n\nNote that in 2022, we will set the Brazilian Real (BRL-to-USD) exchange rate at the beginning of each calendar quarter.\n\nFor select currencies, we provide protection from large month-to-month rate changes.\n\nVisit our Exchange rates documentation for details.\n\nIf you export your Cloud Billing data to BigQuery, you can access the specific exchange rate information applied to your billing account. Look for the currency_conversion_rate field available in your standard, and detailed, usage cost data exports and pricing data export.\n\nNot all currencies are supported for your Cloud Billing account.\n\nList of countries and regions\n\nScroll down the table or use the filter tool to find your country or region.\n\nIf your country or region is not listed here, this might indicate that your country or region's currency is not supported for Google Cloud charges. In these instances, your Cloud Billing account might incur charges in USD.\n\nFor countries or regions not listed here, check the payment options tool for information.\n\nFilter the list\n\nCountry or region Currency Payment methods Andorra EUR credit/debit card Australia AUD credit/debit card Austria EUR credit/debit card, bank account Belgium EUR credit/debit card Bouvet Island NOK credit/debit card Brazil BRL credit card Canada CAD credit/debit card Christmas Island AUD credit/debit card Cocos (Keeling) Islands AUD credit/debit card Cyprus EUR credit/debit card Czech Republic (Czechia) CZK credit/debit card Denmark DKK credit/debit card Estonia EUR credit/debit card Faroe Islands DKK credit/debit card Finland EUR credit/debit card France EUR credit/debit card, bank account Germany EUR credit/debit card, bank account Greece EUR credit/debit card Greenland DKK credit/debit card Heard and McDonald Islands AUD credit/debit card Hong Kong HKD credit/debit card India INR credit/ debit* card, NetBanking (For manual payments only)\n\nIndonesia IDR credit/debit card Ireland EUR credit/debit card Israel ILS credit/debit card Italy EUR credit/debit card, bank account Japan JPY credit/debit card Liechtenstein CHF credit/debit card Luxembourg EUR credit/debit card Malaysia MYR credit/debit card Malta EUR credit/debit card Mayotte EUR credit/debit card Mexico MXN credit card Monaco EUR credit/debit card Montenegro EUR credit/debit card Nauru AUD credit/debit card Netherlands EUR credit/debit card, bank account New Zealand NZD credit/debit card Norfolk Island AUD credit/debit card Norway NOK credit/debit card Palestinian Territory ILS credit/debit card Poland PLN credit/debit card Portugal EUR credit/debit card Reunion EUR credit/debit card Russia RUB credit card San Marino EUR credit/debit card Singapore SGD credit/debit card Slovakia EUR credit/debit card Slovenia EUR credit/debit card South Korea KRW credit/debit card Spain EUR credit/debit card, bank account Svalbard and Jan Mayen Islands NOK credit/debit card Sweden SEK credit/debit card Switzerland CHF credit/debit card Taiwan TWD credit/debit card Thailand THB credit/debit card Turkey TRY credit/debit card Tuvalu AUD credit/debit card United States USD credit/debit card, bank account United Kingdom GBP credit/debit card, bank account Vatican EUR credit/debit card Vietnam VND credit card\n\nTry it for yourself\n\nIf you're new to Google Cloud, create an account to evaluate how our products perform in real-world scenarios.
