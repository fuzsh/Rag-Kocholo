        "text": "The currency in Portugal is the Euro (EUR).\n\nWe always advise changing some money over before you travel, so you’re not trying to hunt down the nearest exchange bureau when you get there.\n\nThe best way to order Euros for your holiday in Portugal\n\nThis is much more cost-effective than ordering at the airport or hotel, where Pound to Euro exchange rates are much less competitive, meaning you’ll get less for your sterling. So it’s best to change your Euros before you jet off. Or, you can order your travel money right here at Thomas Cook, and get it delivered straight to your door.\n\nUsing cash machines in Portugal\n\nYou’ll find cash machines (ATMs) all over Portugal, especially in popular holiday destinations, so if you need some extra cash, you’ll have little trouble withdrawing it. Look out for automated cashpoints, which can be found at most banks, as well as most large supermarkets, shopping districts, railway stations and airports. Use your debit or credit card to withdraw your money or pay by card.\n\nIf you’re visiting its most remote areas, it’s a good idea to carry some cash. ATMs may not be widely available in these areas. Some small businesses in these spots may not accept card payments, so make sure you have enough Euros for food and transport.\n\nOther useful advice\n\nSome shops may require a minimum card payment, such as 10 Euros, while cash machines will have a maximum of Euros you can withdraw per day. Visiting smaller towns on your Portugal holidays? Many banks in these areas will be closed in the early to mid-afternoon for siesta, while the majority will be shut at weekends and bank holidays.\n\nCharges"
