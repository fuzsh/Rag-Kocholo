        "text": "The currency in Portugal is the euro. Each euro is divided into 100 cents.\n\nWhen you’re buying currency for Portugal, look out for the currency code EUR. And once you’re in Portugal, you’ll see the symbol € used to show prices.\n\nYou’ll find Euro banknotes in denominations of 5, 10, 20, 50, 100, 200, and 500 - although the 200 and 500 EUR notes are seldom used. There are also 1 and 2 euro coins.\n\nCents come in coins of 1, 2, 5, 10, 20 and 50.\n\nThe Wise euro travel money card lets you top up in your local currency, and switch to euro to spend when you’re in Portugal. You’ll get the best rate for spending in euro - and can also hold and spend 40+ other currencies with the same card.\n\nGet your Wise travel money card online for free, to send and spend money around the world at the mid-market exchange rate.\n\nSimply top up your card and convert to the currency you need in real time using the Wise app.\n\nYou’ll always get the mid-market exchange rate with no hidden costs, and you’ll avoid foreign transaction fees while withdrawing from ATMs abroad, paying in restaurants and shops, and buying your accommodation and flights.\n\nLearn more about the euro card\n\nPaying by credit or debit card in Portugal\n\nIn Portugal, large, upmarket, and chain shops and restaurants - as well as hotels - are likely to take card payments. However, smaller family run places may prefer cash, so carrying both is a smart move.\n\nATMs in Portugal\n\nYou'll be able to find ATMs - called Multibanco - in cities and towns across Portugal.\n\nHowever, small villages and remote areas won't have ATM coverage, so carry cash if you're adventuring off the beaten track.\n\nTo get the best deal when spending on card or withdrawing money in Portugal, don’t forget to use the Wise travel money card to avoid sneaky exchange rate markups and excessive fees."
