        "text": "Synopsis\n\nA moving story about three girls coming of age in post-Holocaust Israel. Like most of the children in Udim, a youth village nestled along Israel's coastal plain, Aviya, Yola, and Mira share a common sorrow--the pain of longing for lost loved ones. Through their struggles, the girls find friendship and the comfort of knowing they're not alone.\n\n\"synopsis\" may belong to another edition of this title.\n\nFrom School Library Journal\n\nGrade 6-8?Nine years after the end of World War II, the residents of Udim, a youth village in Israel, are emotionally vulnerable but working to build a new life. As survivors of the Holocaust, they still dare to hope that a missing parent will be found or a sibling restored to them. What happens to one effects them all so that when Yola's father is miraculously found alive in Warsaw, the whole community prepares for her trip and mourns with her when tragedy strikes. A new girl alienates the group when she refuses to cooperate with her roommates, a necessity if communal living is to work. When she is threatened by a couple falsely claiming to be her parents, the community rallies to her support and she, in turn, learns to trust again. Except for the narrator, a sabra whose mother suffers from severe depression and whose father is dead, the characters are not explored in depth. The translation is sometimes rough and awkward. What comes through loud and clear is the emotional truth of simple, but important, things such as knowing where your father is buried and witnessing the blossoming of hundreds of bulbs given to the village by the Dutch government.?Amy Kellman, The Carnegie Library of Pittsburgh\n\nCopyright 1995 Reed Business Information, Inc."
