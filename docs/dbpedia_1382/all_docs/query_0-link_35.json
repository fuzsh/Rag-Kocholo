        "text": "In recent years, the Danish national team has made great strides up the world rankings. A semi-final finish at the European Championship in 2021, a first place in the qualifying group for the upcoming World Cup in Qatar and great performances in the Nations League this year have taken Denmark up to number ten in the FIFA world rankings.\n\nCoach Kasper Hjulmand's (50) overall match record prior to June 2022 was 19-3-6, including a draw against England in the European Championship semi-final. In that period, they lost twice to Belgium, once to Finland when they were flattened by Christian Eriksen's (30) heart failure, once to Scotland in a meaningless qualifier when they had already qualified for the World Cup and finally to the Netherlands when their defence was severely weakened.\n\nUnder Hjulmand, the national team has found a system of playing effectively and entertainingly, with advancing wingbacks and plenty of pressure on the ball to ensure quick turnovers.\n\nDepending on the opponent and the match, Hjulmand operates with two or three central defenders, but against World Cup group rivals France, in September, he surprisingly switched to a 4-2-3-1 formation.\n\nThere are many hungry young talents in the squad, but there is also a solid core of regulars, like Kasper Schmeichel (36), Simon Kjaer (33) and Christian Eriksen (30), who are the culture carriers of the team.\n\nHjulmand has once again rallied the nation around the team and there is great optimism ahead of the World Cup finals. This is a team that on its best days can beat the very best.\n\nStrengths\n\nTogetherness. The Danish national team moved even closer together after Eriksen's shocking cardiac arrest in the Finland match at last year's European Championship. The Danes rose from that terrible experience to reach the semi-finals, where they eventually lost to England after extra time. It was to be the end of a tournament where the Danish team garnered particularly heavy praise for their spirited performances.\n\nThe national team is well constructed and has had great success recently, including two wins over the reigning world champions France. It is team harmony and this recent good form that are the Danes' true strengths and should give them plenty of confidence going into this World Cup.\n\nWeaknesses\n\nThe Danes' biggest weakness is that several players do not get the desired amount of playing time at their respective clubs.\n\nPlayers like Thomas Delaney (31), Kasper Dolberg (25) and Mikkel Damsgaard (22) are all in a situation where they have not got many minutes this season.\n\nOther players like Andreas Cornelius (29), Jonas Wind (23), Christian Norgaard (28) and Andreas Christensen (26) have all been hit by injuries that mean they are probably not in optimal match shape.\n\nIdeal XI\n\nIt can be difficult to pinpoint an ideal starting line-up, as Hjulmand has alternated between two formations in particular. Denmark have usually played with either a 4-3-3 or a 3-4-3 formation.\n\nHere's a guess at the starting 11 in the first match against Tunisia:\n\n4-3-3\n\nKasper Schmeichel - Rasmus Nissen Kristensen, Simon Kjaer, Joachim Andersen, Joakim Maehle - Thomas Delaney, Pierre-Emile Hojbjerg, Christian Eriksen - Jesper Lindstrom, Kasper Dolberg, Andreas Skov Olsen\n\n3-4-3\n\nKasper Schmeichel - Andreas Christensen, Simon Kjaer, Joachim Andersen - Rasmus Nissen Kristensen, Thomas Delaney, Pierre-Emile Hojbjerg, Joakim Maehle - Andreas Skov Olsen, Kasper Dolberg, Christian Eriksen\n\nHottest Contest\n\nSchmeichel has been the first choice in goal for a number of years. Although the Danish goalkeeper had a difficult start at Nice, he has raised his level so that he again looks like the top goalkeeper that the Danes had been used to seeing between the sticks.\n\nIn central defence, the team's captain Kjaer has shaken off his injury and got some minutes under his belt. He is therefore expected to be among the first 11 to take to the field in Qatar. Predicting who will be Kjaer's partner in a four-man backline is a little trickier, though. Joachim Andersen (26) has been a regular at Crystal Palace, while Christensen has been injured for a long time at FC Barcelona, where he has only recently become fit. In a three-man back line, Hjulmand will probably find room for both of them.\n\nOn the flanks, Joakim Maehle (25) has settled heavily into the left-back position and doesn't have much competition in that spot. However, there is competition for places at right back, with Rasmus Kristensen (25) from Leeds and Daniel Wass (33) from Brondby in particular. Wass has more experience, while Kristensen plays at a higher level in the Premier League.\n\nIn midfield, Hjulmand will probably opt for Eriksen, Pierre-Emile Hojbjerg (27) and Delaney. The latter has not played much in Sevilla, but the most natural replacement, Christian Norgaard (28), has been injured for a long time and is only just ready. Therefore, it seems that Delaney will start.\n\nUp front, Andreas Skov Olsen (22) and Jesper Lindstrom (22) have been flying in their respective clubs. Dolberg hasn't played much at Sevilla, but with both Cornelius and Wind injured, Dolberg is a good bet to start the tournament.\n\nPrediction\n\nThis Danish team has gone from strength to strength in recent years and as their World Ranking suggests, they can mix it with the best nations out there.\n\nThey are expected to get out of Group D with ease but how they go against one of the tournament favourites in France should determine whether they place first or second in that group. As mentioned, they do have a good record against the French recently."
