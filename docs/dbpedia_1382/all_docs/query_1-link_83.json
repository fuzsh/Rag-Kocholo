        "text": "It didn’t take Bhuyan long to show his talents on the pitch. At 15, Bhuyan was already starting to grab eyeballs for the youth team of Danish giants Brondby. However, it was in a match against fierce rivals FC Copenhagen which proved to be an essential milestone in his career. The youngster scored a stunning goal, after which the Copenhagen coach met him and offered him a chance to join the biggest club in Danish football. Bhuyan gleefully accepted the offer.\n\n“I moved to FC Copenhagen when I was 15, and in the second practice, one of the coaches came to me, and he said, ‘Jamal, you have good technique, but you have to work on your physical part, or they will all beat you.’ But then he said that if I use my intelligence, I’ll be alright because football isn’t just physical.\n\nThe club was very nice to me. They had great resources; they were playing the UEFA Champions League,” said Bhuyan in an interview with News Click.\n\nThat fateful night\n\nBy the time Bhuyan turned 16, his progress was pretty impressive. FC Copenhagen was on the verge of promoting him to the senior team. But just then, tragedy struck.\n\nOne evening, Bhuyan was returning home from school when he got stuck in the middle of a gang fire. He was perplexed and didn’t know what to do. He found himself lying in the hospital bed after being in a coma for two days. Bhuyan was shot four times, with one of them just two centimetres below his heart.\n\nSpeaking about the incident to Indian Express, Bhuyan said, “A few people around me, they died. But, you know, I survived. Because of the injury, I did not have any feeling in my right hand. So the doctors wanted to take some nerves from my foot and put it up in my arm.” But he resisted. “I told them, ‘I need my legs.’”\n\nEventually, he had to undergo 11 to 12 surgeries. The doctors were adamant that he would never play football again, but it was not in Bhuyan’s blood to give up. After his recovery, he set out on his mission to prove them wrong.\n\n“I think a lot about that incident, and when I think a lot about those things, I get crazy. I cannot change the past. But, you know, I can change the future.”\n\nCall of the roots\n\nAged 18, Bhuyan’s development was good enough, and one day he got a mail from the Bangladesh Football Federation. They wanted him to decide on his national team future. He went to Bangladesh in 2008. However, being away from his family, coupled with an inability to adjust to the food, culture and atmosphere, took its toll on him. Unable to settle in his new surroundings, he returned to Denmark.\n\nOnce again, Bhuyan refused to give up. In 2012, he signed for Bangladesh Premier League club Abahani Limited Dhaka. After a two-year stint, during which he also made his national team debut, he returned to Denmark for a brief period.\n\n2015 saw Bhuyan return to Bangladesh with a renewed vigour and determination. He finally started to live up to his club career reputation when he fired Sheikh Jamal Dhanmondi to their third league title.\n\nEndearing himself to the nation\n\nThe 2018 Asian Games in Indonesia is where Jamal Bhuyan would write his legacy in the national team colours. Bangladesh was paired in a tough Group B, alongside Qatar, Uzbekistan and Thailand. The first match saw Bangladesh comprehensively beaten by Uzbekistan. In the next game, the Tigers earned a gritty draw against Thailand.\n\nThe last group stage match was against Qatar. After managing to hold their fort and frustrate their more illustrious opponents, it was Jamal Bhuyan who struck the decisive blow. In the 93rd minute of the contest, Bhuyan picked up the ball near the edge of the box and unleashed a fierce low drive to find the back of the net.\n\nThat goal sent Bangladesh to the knockout stages for the first time. Despite falling to North Korea in the Round of 16, Bhuyan had earned praise from everyone back home, and he soon became the toast of the nation.\n\nTrading one side of Bangla for another\n\nBangladesh, led by Jamal Bhuyan, travelled to Kolkata for the joint FIFA World Cup-AFC Asian Cup qualifier against India in 2019.\n\n“It’s always special to play against India because India is like an elder brother to Bangladesh”, said Bhuyan in an interview to the All India Football Federation (AIFF) official website. “In the stadium, the galleries were already full by the time we had come in for our pre-game warm-ups. That’s when we felt that this is going to be a really good game. The crowd was amazing.”\n\nThe midfielder played a crucial role, marking the talismanic Sunil Chhetri and providing the assist via a free-kick for his team’s goal. The match ultimately ended in a 1-1 draw. Still, it was that night in Kolkata where Bhuyan witnessed the passion among people in ‘The City of Joy’ and experienced the cauldron-like atmosphere in the Vivekananda Yuva Bharati Krirangan.\n\n“Some of the fans recognised me when we were going around the city after the game. They came to me and told me about how well I had played. I was quite taken aback,” he added.\n\n“I had initially felt that they would maybe throw taunts at me because I was on the opposing side. But they showed a lot of respect, and as a player, you really appreciate that.”\n\nIn November 2020, Jamal Bhuyan was back in India, having penned a deal for Hero I-League outfit Mohammedan SC."
