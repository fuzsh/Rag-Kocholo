        "text": "On Saturday evening, Denmark midfielder and talisman Christian Eriksen collapsed on the pitch shortly before half-time during the nation’s European Championship opening game against Finland in Copenhagen.\n\nIt has subsequently been confirmed that Eriksen suffered a cardiac arrest. Medical experts in attendance have said the footballer’s heart stopped and they feared he was “gone” during the most traumatic moment in the history of the competition.\n\nThankfully, the proactive response from Eriksen’s team-mates, match officials and medical professionals resuscitated the Inter Milan midfielder and he was well enough to speak to his fellow Denmark players via video link from hospital on Saturday evening, with his condition understood to have improved further on Sunday.\n\nDespite the trauma for both Eriksen’s team-mates and their opponents, the match, initially suspended, was then played to a conclusion. Finland won 1-0.\n\nHere, The Athletic details the events, how Eriksen’s team-mates acted with warmth in their hearts and coolness in their mind to be first responders to his collapse, counsellors to his distressed girlfriend and then formed a protective ring around the midfielder. We also detail how two FC Copenhagen doctors (who also happen to be brothers) heroically stepped in to save Eriksen’s life, as well as the ongoing debate as to whether the game should have continued, and how the Danish team are preparing to continue at Euro 2020.\n\nWhat happened to Eriksen?\n\nEriksen scuttled from the penalty area to make himself available to receive the ball from a throw-in and suddenly appeared to fall face-first towards the turf. It was immediately clear to the players on the field and English referee Anthony Taylor that he had collapsed.\n\nTeam-mates immediately placed Eriksen into the recovery position and Denmark captain Simon Kjaer sprinted towards the scene. He has subsequently been credited with helping to clear Eriksen’s airways and preventing the player from swallowing his tongue.\n\nEriksen required emergency CPR treatment on the field of play for 13 minutes. The Denmark team doctor Morten Boesen, who also works for Danish club FC Copenhagen, later explained: “He (Eriksen) was gone. And we did cardiac resuscitation. It was a cardiac arrest. How close were we? I don’t know. We got him back after one defibrillator. That is quite fast. How close were we? I don’t know.”\n\nIn the heat of the moment, Kjaer had assisted as one of the first responders and then he led his team-mates in forming a protective shield around Eriksen to prevent cameras from intruding.\n\nDenmark doctor Boesen explained Eriksen had been breathing when he first arrived at the scene but then drastically deteriorated. Boesen said: “When I got to him, he was on his side, he was breathing, I could feel a pulse but suddenly that changed and we started to give him CPR. It was clear he was unconscious.\n\n“The help came really fast from the medical team and the rest of the staff with their co-operation. We did what we had to do and managed to get Christian back. He spoke to me before he was taken to hospital.”\n\nThe Denmark doctor Boesen has worked for FC Copenhagen since 2004. He is the club’s chief physician and works both on treatment and surgical intervention. In March 2019, the Danish FA received permission to lend his services during international periods. He was on the bench pitchside yesterday and attended the scene within 45 seconds of Eriksen hitting the turf.\n\nRemarkably, his brother Anders Boesen also works for FC Copenhagen in the academy and he is also a qualified doctor. Anders was listed for the fixture as UEFA’s stadium doctor, as an independent medical professional who is called upon in an emergency. As such, the two brothers teamed up to provide heroic critical medical care for Eriksen. The two brothers are also former elite badminton players in Denmark. Anders was ranked as high as world No. 3 at his peak.\n\nOne source close to the pair admitted that “the day job is to fix knees, rather than save lives but they are always ready.” The source added: “Morten is a very clear doctor, he knows what he’s good at and speaks about what he knows about. He didn’t go into speculation about the cardiac arrest at the press conference for that reason.”\n\nEriksen was the beneficiary of a perfectly organised medical setup, as the stadium had a dedicated ambulance for the players, in addition to the pitchside medics. Both the defibrillator and life support equipment was immediately at hand, while a source close to the Danish FA quipped that the Parken Stadium has a medical room “with enough supplies for half the people in Copenhagen.” Eriksen was fortunate, too, that the local Rigshospitalet is one of the largest hospitals in Denmark and a four-minute drive from the stadium.\n\nKjaer and Denmark goalkeeper Kasper Schmeichel consoled Eriksen’s partner Sabrina Kvist, who had appeared, in obvious distress, at the opposite side of the pitch to where the 29-year-old was being treated. Schmeichel’s father Peter told BBC Radio 5 Live: “You could see from the reaction of my son Kasper, running over to her. He went over to say that Christian is breathing and she actually believed he had passed away. He went back to be sure he wasn’t saying anything that was out of order.”\n\nOne spectator with a direct view of the incident explains the numbness that gripped the stadium. He said: “The players went in a ring around Christian. That was very hard to watch. We understood this was serious. The players started crying. Jonas Wind, Thomas Delaney. Also Finnish players, Paulus Arajuuri — he used to play in Denmark. He had his hands on his head.\n\n“They were very long minutes. The players, nine of them, made the ring. Everyone stayed there. There were at least 16,000 in the stadium, but it was so quiet. It was really touching. Then some fans tried to start a chant, ‘Christian Eriksen, Christian Eriksen’, but it didn’t really work so they stopped. Nobody really knew what to do. What would be better, silence or to sing for him? We didn’t know anything.”\n\nOne leading club director present in the stadium admitted he feared the worst, even when Eriksen was leaving the stadium. He added that “nobody expected the game to continue.”\n\nHe explains: “As the players formed that shield around him, we feared for him and a lot of people in the stadium didn’t know he was alive. I only knew from social media a few minutes later. We have all seen big injuries before but in the stadium, the whole way this happened had a different vibe. Everyone felt this, I had goosebumps. He just fell down like he was shot. People went ‘What was that?’ The stadium had been sold out, with 16,500 spectators. People left because they were emotionally traumatised. Some people had their own traumatic memories of losing loves ones triggered and others left because nobody imagined the game could continue.”\n\nTim Sparv, the Finland captain, told The Daily Mail: “I thought initially that he had been tackled or he was fouled. Five or 10 seconds later you could see the players were rushing to him, trying to see if he was OK or if he was breathing. And then there was the feeling of, ‘Oh shit, what’s going on?’. You’ve seen these types of things happen before and we were just fearing the worst. It was very shocking and very stressful when we became aware of what was going on.\n\n“Our first moves were just to move away and go to our bench. We were speaking with each other, trying to figure out what was going on and looking for the first signs that he was alive. It was taking such a long time, and then you could see they were doing CPR. It was a very traumatic experience for everybody.\n\n“I saw there were young kids in the crowd who were leaving the stadium. I just hope everybody gets the psychological help and support they need. This won’t be going away for some time.”\n\nSparv also praised the response by referee Taylor and his assistants. He added: “He was a key person during this event. He was a very calm character, he was very empathetic to our emotions. I felt he was fantastic, the way he dealt with all of it and the way he communicated everything. Big credit to him and his colleagues in this kind of situation. I can imagine it was tough for them as well.”\n\nWhat about for those watching at home?\n\nIn the United Kingdom, the BBC has received criticism for continuing to broadcast live shots, which at different stages provided close-ups of the player’s medical treatment and also cut to his partner Sabrina Kvist appearing visibly devastated by the incident.\n\nThe BBC does not direct the coverage from international football events, which is provided by a UEFA feed and distributed to national broadcasters. However, some viewers felt that the BBC should have returned to the studio earlier. As Eriksen was carried off, a Finnish supporter also handed a flag to the Denmark team to help reinforce the shield protecting Eriksen’s privacy.\n\nA BBC spokesperson said: “We apologise to anyone who was upset by the images broadcast. In-stadium coverage is controlled by UEFA, as the host broadcaster, and as soon as the match was suspended, we took our coverage off-air as quickly as possible.”\n\nAs Eriksen was lifted onto a stretcher, German photographer Friedemann Vogel took a photo, through a gap separating the Danish players, that showed Eriksen sitting up. The picture rapidly went viral on social media. He wrote on Instagram: “As a pool photographer for all international news agencies, I decided to broadcast this life-signalling and relieving moment and let the editors of the respective agencies decide whether and how to use this picture.\n\n“Immediately afterwards I received many messages from people thanking me for this picture, it gave them hope that everything will be all right. But I also received a few messages insulting and defaming me, which makes me sad.\n\n“I accept all forms of criticism of my work but it should be with respect and decency. If I have irritated or even offended anyone with my image then I sincerely apologise.”\n\nDerek Rae called the match for ESPN in the US, alongside Efan Ekoku, as detailed here.\n\nWhat happened after the players left the pitch?\n\nReferee Taylor and the Finland players were first to depart the field of play after the match was postponed as Eriksen continued to receive critical treatment. As his condition improved, he was taken safely to a Copenhagen hospital.\n\nOne Denmark fan inside the stadium said: “We didn’t get any information until very very late. Maybe after 40 minutes, over the speaker, they said he was stable. Then people started to clap and sing. That was nice.\n\n“The best thing was the Finnish fans. They started singing his name after he was carried away. They would sing Christian, and then we sang Eriksen. That was also another touching moment. We all stayed. We walked around a little bit.\n\n“I’d had beers and stuff. But when this happened, my mate and I thought, ‘We should have some coffee’. I went to buy some but it was sold out — everyone was starting to buy coffee.”\n\nWhat conversations took place to get the match back on?\n\nTwo hours after Eriksen’s collapse, at 8.30pm local time, play resumed. The final five minutes of the first half were played, before a five-minute half-time and then the second half as Finland secured a victory in their first match at a major tournament.\n\nIt is understood that UEFA informed the two sets of players of two different options: finish the game on the night or play at midday on Sunday afternoon. Both options left the players facing up to completing or replaying the match within 18 hours of the traumatic incident.\n\nFinland players were happy to follow Denmark’s wishes, with news on Eriksen’s condition quickly sounding more positive. Denmark players spoke via video link to Eriksen from his hospital bed and he encouraged his team-mates to see the game through.\n\nUEFA confirmed to The Athletic that the match was restarted following the request made by players of both teams, although it has become clear the two nations were limited in their options by the governing body.\n\nThere has been a certain level of surprise that UEFA did not demonstrate greater flexibility. As an example, competition guidelines state that if a nation does not have at least 13 players available due to a COVID-19 outbreak then the game would be rescheduled within 48 hours “if possible”.\n\nThe governing body was understood to be keen to ensure Finland would have adequate recovery time before their second group fixture against Russia on Wednesday. UEFA also cited rule 29 of its handbook, which states that “if a match cannot start or cannot be played in full, the full of remaining match time is, as a rule, played on the next day”.\n\nIt remains unclear, however, why Denmark were not offered a later time on Sunday, although UEFA already had matches scheduled for 2pm, 5pm and 8pm. There are allowances in the rulebook for the game to have been pushed back even further, as rule 29.02 says “if a match cannot be rescheduled the next day, the UEFA administration fixes a new date, during or as close as possible to the international match calendar window concerned. The rescheduling may entail exceptions to the regular match scheduling pattern”.\n\nAs such, the two teams are entitled to wonder why the governing body did not provide further possibilities, which would have allowed the two sets of players a greater amount of time to recover their state of mind ahead of playing competitive football again.\n\nFormer Manchester United goalkeeper Peter Schmeichel said: “I want to put on record that it is absolutely ridiculous that UEFA comes up with a solution like that. Something terrible happens and UEFA gives the players an option to go out and play the final 50 minutes or come back at 12pm. I mean, what kind of option is that?\n\n“So you go back to your hotel — in the case for the Danes, it is 45 minutes away — then you cannot sleep, you might not even sleep because watching trauma like that has a massive effect on you of course and then get back on the team bus at 8am to play the rest of the game.\n\n“It was not an option. It was a ridiculous decision by UEFA and they should have tried to work out a different scenario and show a bit of compassion and they didn’t. Why take TV scheduling and all of that into consideration. Why 12 o’clock? The game was irrelevant, totally. How can you play?”\n\nUEFA did not respond when offered the opportunity to comment on the suggestions that TV scheduling may have influenced the decision to complete the match on Saturday night.\n\nOne senior director at a Danish club suggested on Sunday evening that the two nations should have been presented with a third option to abandon the game and agree a draw. The same director felt that the Danish FA could have simply put their foot down to UEFA, refused to play either on Saturday evening or Sunday lunchtime, and taken the decision out of the hands of their shell-shocked players. He did, however, appreciate that in the heat of the moment, with the players buoyed to hear Eriksen’s message of encouragement, that all parties were under immense pressure.\n\nThe Denmark manager Kasper Hjulmand admitted his players were not in the right state of mind to compete but also highlighted the problem with playing the match at Sunday noon.\n\nHjulmand added: “The players could not imagine not being able to sleep and to have to go on a bus tomorrow and play again. It was easier to go out and it was best to get it over with.\n\n“I couldn’t be prouder of those people who took such good care of each other. The way the players talked in the dressing room to decide to not do anything before we knew Christian was conscious and OK. (But) you can’t play a game with such feelings.”\n\nHow did the players finish the match?\n\nDenmark captain Kjaer, one of the heroes of the day, needed to be substituted around 20 minutes after play resumed. Kjaer later confided to his family that his legs felt heavy after the traumatic incident. Kjaer and Eriksen are long-standing friends from the national team but also in Milan, where Eriksen plays for Inter Milan and Kjaer represents city rivals AC Milan.\n\nA source close to several Denmark players said: “I honestly believe nobody in the stadium wanted that game to go on. It was so strange that they forced them to play. They were given the choice of playing on Saturday night or at noon on Sunday, and that wouldn’t help anything, would it?\n\n“Everybody knows after you have a shock like that, there is no way you can do anything physically.” In the aftermath of the game, Kjaer spoke only to his mother, who consoled the Danish captain.\n\nA source close to the squad said: “It was very easy to see that Simon couldn’t manage it, he couldn’t play the game. When they came out to do the warm-up he was just walking around. The goalkeeper coach came over and put his arm around him, and then the attacking coach did the same. Simon was just looking at the stands where Christian’s wife had been sitting. Simon was very affected. He started playing, but he was substituted a few minutes later for Jannik Vestergaard.”\n\nThis was Denmark’s first experience of hosting a match at a major international tournament and anticipation had been high, with the families of players sitting in the stands, many of whom mix socially away from football.\n\nHjulmand said: “It was incredible they managed to go out and try to play the second half. Honestly, there were players out there who were completely done. Emotionally done and emotionally exhausted. It was a traumatic experience. We talked about those feelings and it would’ve been OK to say ‘no’ if they didn’t want to play.\n\n“Some of them were not able to play, some were ready. We just tried to do our best, but you can’t play a football game at this level. It’s not normal to play such a game when one of your friends is suffering with a heart issue. I cannot imagine playing a game like that.\n\n“In hindsight, I wonder if I could have done something differently. Because when I look back, I honestly do not think we should have been back on the field. I am so proud that the players were able to mobilise and give it a try. It was a huge effort. But I have a guilty conscience that we were back out there.”\n\nHjulmand did speak to Eriksen later on Saturday night. The manager explained: “Christian said, ‘I don’t remember much but I’m more concerned about you guys. How are you doing?’. That’s typical Christian. It was good to see him smile.” Eriksen also dropped into his Inter WhatsApp group on Saturday evening to tell his team-mates “I am good”.\n\nThe Danish FA confirmed on Sunday that Eriksen remained in hospital as he undergoes further tests. Denmark cancelled Sunday’s training sessions, as well as media commitments for players, and have offered the team crisis management assistance in the form of counselling. They are intending to resume training on Monday ahead of Thursday’s fixture against Belgium in Copenhagen.\n\nHow did the Finland players respond?\n\nFinland won 1-0 through Joel Pohjanpalo’s second-half goal, with Tottenham’s Pierre-Emile Hojbjerg missing a late penalty. One source close to the squad said that Hojbjerg “showed balls” by stepping up to take the kick.\n\nPohjanpalo told Helsingin Sanomat: “We were told before we returned to the field that everything looked good. His condition was stable and he hoped that we would continue to play. The Finnish players ought to have been celebrating a famous victory in their first major tournament but instead, their players remained awake at 4am discussing the traumatic scenes they had witnessed earlier in the evening.”\n\nHead coach Markku Kanerva spoke to his team on the pitch before the match restarted and later conceded his players’ thoughts were “here, there and everywhere”. There were no real celebrations after the game, although the Finnish staff did go over to the supporters to share the moment.\n\nHow did players elsewhere react?\n\nThe match between Belgium and Russia, scheduled for Saturday evening, never appeared likely to be called off once it emerged that Eriksen was in a stable condition. Belgium’s squad, however, contains two long-term team-mates from Ajax and Tottenham in Toby Alderweireld and Jan Vertonghen, as well as former Tottenham player Nacer Chadli and Eriksen’s current Inter team-mate Romelu Lukaku.\n\nAfter scoring twice in Belgium’s 3-0 win over Russia, Lukaku said: “For me, it was difficult today to play because my mind was with Christian. I hope he is healthy and I dedicate this performance to him. I cried a lot (when we saw what happened). I was scared, we lived strong moments together for a year and a half, I spent more time with him than with my family. My thoughts are with him, his girlfriend, his two kids and his family.”\n\nLukaku opened the scoring against Russia and ran to the camera and said, “I love you, Chris.”\n\nThe England squad contains Harry Kane, Kieran Trippier and Kyle Walker, who all played with Eriksen at Tottenham, and the squad took in the news after travelling on the team coach down from their training base at St George’s Park to London for the group match against Croatia.\n\nWant to read more about Denmark?
