        "text": "Before we get into this rumor, I just want you to know that I am going to try my hardest to be objective when I discuss the \"Danish star\" in question. Daniel Wass, Evian Thonon Gaillard's fullback/winger/attacking midfielder/striker/everything that's right in the world, is being linked with a move away from Les Roses now that the club has been relegated from Ligue 1. There's nothing concrete linking him to Spurs at this point. Mostly it's just rumors saying Spurs, along with every other club ever, are interested in Wass.\n\nWass could be available for as little as 2 million euro, which is an amazing price. To give you an idea of how good he is, he's being tracked by the following clubs in addition to Tottenham Hotspur: West Ham, Southampton, Stoke City, Newcastle, Juventus, Schalke, and Inter Milan Chelsea, and Liverpool. Ok, some of those teams on that list are less impressive than others, but you get the idea.\n\nWass is sort of a jack of all trades. He began his career as a fullback, but quickly transitioned to positions further up the pitch. He's comfortable mostly on the right side, but has played through the middle and on the left as well. Wass scored 10 goals in all competitions for an Evian side that often found goals hard to come buy. Wass was the team's leading scorer by a fair margin.\n\nIn terms of just adding low cost and quality depth to a side that really only played about fourteen or fifteen guys, Wass would be an excellent option. At 25 years-old, Wass lacks the potential of some of the other big names that Spurs have been linked with. He also lacks elite top-end speed. Wass is much more crafty than he is pacy, but his delivery on crosses and dead balls is excellent and, if nothing else, he brings a lot of versatility."
