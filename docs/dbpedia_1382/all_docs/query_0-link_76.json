        "text": "With Denmark’s squad of 26 due to travel to the 2022 World Cup in just one week, coach Kasper Hjulmand has so far unveiled 21 players for the trip to Qatar.\n\nThere were no big surprises among the initial 21 selections with Christian Eriksen, Simon Kjær and inspirational keeper Kasper Schmeichel among those making the trip.\n\nThe squad was unveiled in a tidy video in which former PM Helle Thorning-Schmidt and The Lord himself, Nicklas Bendtner made appearances (see below).\n\nBarcelona defender Andreas Christensen, back from injury, will also be on the flight to Doha, as will midfield stalwarts Thomas Delaney and Pierre-Emile Højbjerg.\n\nREAD ALSO: World Cup stars of the future? Eleven to watch out for in 2026\n\nFive tickets still up for grabs\n\nDue to injury and form situations, Hjulmand will wait before revealing his final five selections. He said there were about 10-12 contenders still vying for the final five spots.\n\nOne will be a goalkeeper and if he can shake off his injury, Frederik Rønnow will be called up. Otherwise, Jonas Lössl or Mads Hermansen are waiting in the wings.\n\nIn defence, Mathias ‘Zanka’ Jørgensen (Brentford) has proven himself at major tournaments in the past, while Jannik Vestergaard seems a long shot given his lack of playing time for Leicester City this season. Alexander Bah could be a dark horse, having impressed for streaking Benfica.\n\nIf Christian Nørgaard (Brentford) can impress after returning from injury, he will be the favourite to go among the midfielders. Philip Billing (Bournemouth) has impressed lately and could squeeze in too, as could Lecce’s Morten Hjulmand (no relation to coach).\n\nPending fitness reviews, Yussuf Poulsen (RB Leipzig) and Robert Skov (Hoffenheim) are likely to go as forward/wingers, while Marcus Ingvartsen (Mainz 05) has been banging in goals lately and could be among the late additions.\n\nShould a big surprise materialise, it will likely come via young guns Mohamed Daramy (FC Copenhagen) and Gustav Isaksen (FC Midtjylland).\n\nThe full squad selection must be presented to FIFA by November 14 at the latest. The Danes will start the competition against Tunisia just eight days later on November 22.\n\nDefending champions France await four days later, before the final group stage game offers a battle with Australia on November 30.\n\nThe 21 Danish players selected for the 2022 World Cup:\n\nGoalkeepers: Kasper Schmeichel (OGC Nice), Oliver Christensen (Hertha Berlin)\n\nDefenders: Joakim Mæhle (Atalanta), Jens Stryger Larsen (Trabzonspor), Rasmus Kristensen (Leeds), Daniel Wass (Brøndby IF), Simon Kjær (AC Milan), Andreas Christensen (Barcelona), Joachim Andersen (Crystal Palace), Victor Nelsson (Galatasaray)\n\nMidfielders: Mathias Jensen (Brentford), Thomas Delaney (Sevilla), Pierre-Emile Højbjerg (Tottenham), Christian Eriksen (Manchester United)"
