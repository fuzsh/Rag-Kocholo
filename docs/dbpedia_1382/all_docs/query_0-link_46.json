        "text": "Team: Denmark\n\nManager: Kasper Hjulmand\n\nGroup: B\n\nOther teams in group: Belgium, Finland and Russia\n\nTHE SQUAD\n\nDenmark boss Kasper Hjulmand will certainly have plenty to choose from as many familiar faces are included in the squad. Big name players included are Christian Eriksen, Kasper Schmeichel, Yussuf Poulsen and Champions League winner Andreas Christensen. The squad is made up of players all across Europe’s top leagues.\n\nThe squad in full:\n\nGoalkeepers: Kasper Schmeichel (Leicester City), Jonas Lossl (Midtjylland), Frederik Ronnow (Schalke).\n\nDefenders: Jannik Vestergaard (Southampton), Simon Kjær (AC Milan), Joakim Mæhle (Atalanta), Andreas Christensen (Chelsea), Nicolai Boilesen (Copenhagen), Joachim Andersen (Fulham), Jens Stryger Larsen (Udinese), Mathias Jorgensen (Copenhagen).\n\nMidfielders: Thomas Delaney (Borussia Dortmund), Christian Eriksen (Internazionale), Mathias Jensen (Brentford), Daniel Wass (Valencia), Pierre-Emile Hojbjerg (Tottenham Hotspur), Christian Norgaard (Brentford), Philip Billing (Bournemouth).\n\nForwards: Robert Skov (Hoffenheim), Martin Braithwaite (Barcelona), Jonas Wind (Copenhagen), Mikkel Damsgaard (Sampdoria), Yussuf Poulsen (RB Leipzig), Andreas Skov Olsen (Bologna), Kasper Dolberg (Nice), Andreas Cornelius (Parma).\n\nHOW THEY GOT HERE\n\nRemarkably Denmark only managed to qualify on the last game of their qualifying campaign against, you guessed it, Republic of Ireland.\n\nThe last group game saw the Danes needing a draw to make it to their 9th European Championship. A 1-1 draw in the Aviva Stadium was enough for Denmark to advance.\n\nDespite a nervy ending to the qualifying group, Denmark progressed after going through the entire campaign unbeaten.\n\nKEY PLAYERS TO WATCH OUT FOR\n\nChristian Eriksen: The current Inter Milan attacking midfielder will look to flourish on the big stage after securing the Scudetto in his second season with the club.\n\nThe play-maker adapted to life in Italy after an unconvincing start to his career at Milan. After making his International debut in 2010 Eriksen has become a huge asset to the way the Danes play.\n\nHe became the Danes youngest player to play in the World Cup after featuring in two matches in South Africa. The former Tottenham midfielder has been named Danish Footballer of the Year for a record fifth time.\n\nSimon Kjær: The AC Milan defender will be a strong presence in heart of the Danish defence as he looks to captain his side to Euro 2020 glory.\n\nThe no-nonsense centre half seems to produce his best performances for the national side. He has been a part of the team since 2009 and has rarely let his country down.\n\nHe has over a century of caps and won the 100th cap against England in 2020.\n\nPierre-Emile Hojbjerg: Despite an unsuccessful season for Tottenham, Hojbjerg has had a strong season.\n\nJose Mourinho bought him from Southampton and the midfielder played his part in all of their 38 Premier League games last season.\n\nDespite his vast experience he is only 25 years old, he will bring a strong defensive shape to the midfield and will be looking to bring his qualities into the campaign.\n\nDenmark will bring one of the strongest squads into the competition. Having conceded few goals in the qualifying stages, they will look to build on that.\n\nWHERE THEY ARE PLAYING\n\nSaturday, 12 June Denmark v Finland (kick-off 5pm), Parken, Copenhagen\n\nThursday, 17 June Denmark v Belgium (kick-off 5pm), Parken, Copenhagen\n\nMonday, 21 June Denmark v Russia (kick0off 8pm), Parken, Copenhagen\n\nTHREE INTERESTING FACTS ABOUT THE TEAM\n\nThe nation of over achievers have previously won the European Championship. Just ten days prior to the tournament Denmark were included in the competition after Yugoslavia was pulled from Euro 1992. They originally failed to qualify for the tournament but remarkably defeated Germany 2-0 in the final to claim their first ever major trophy.\n\nVice-Captain Kasper Schmeichel will look to follow in his father’s footsteps and try to surprise the footballing world and win another major tournament for the country. Kasper is the son of former Manchester United goalkeeper Peter, and will have a huge part to play if his side are to be successful.\n\nProviding the Danes advance past the group stages they will have the chance to play in Wembley the Danes secured a 1-0 victory against England at Wembley in October.\n\nTHEIR RECENT FORM\n\nThey go into the Championship in good form after beating England 1-0 in Wembley in the Nations League. They also have won all three of their World Cup Qualifiers without conceding a goal and scoring 14."
