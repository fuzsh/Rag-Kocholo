        "text": "Daniel Wass has joined Atletico until 2023. The Dane, until now a Valencia player, arrives at the Metropolitano in a month marked by the departure of Kieran Trippier. The Englishman's departure to Newcastle has led to the red and white club's decision to sign the former Valencia player.\n\nWass has undergone his medical and has signed for Atletico Madrid. The player is committed until 2023, for a year and a half. The Dane did not hesitate, as soon as he heard about Atletico's interest, he told Valencia that he wanted to leave.\n\nOn Thursday he did not train with Bordalas' team, as he was in Madrid, ready to sign. Cameras caught him just after he committed to Atletico Madrid.\n\nIn fact, the final agreement, closed yesterday, involves the payment of 2.7 million euros plus bonuses. This amount has finally convinced Valencia after several weeks of negotiations between the two clubs, including the Mestalla side's search for substitutes to let the Dane leave.\n\nSimeone wants him for his experience and good work at the back. He is an expert in Spanish football, having spent three and a half seasons at Valencia and three seasons at Celta.\n\nWass arrived at Balaidos in the summer of 2015. Previously, he had spells at Evian Thonon Gaillard and Brondby IF. He has no shortage of international experience either. With Denmark, after playing in all the youth teams, the defender made the big leap to the senior side, with whom he has played 41 games to date."
