The Dane is seen as a replacement for departed right-back Kieran Trippier, but he can also play in midfield.\n\nAtlético upped their original offer of under €2 million and Valencia have decided to accept the latest offer from the Madrid-based club. Wass will travel to Madrid soon to complete his move to the Wanda Metropolitano.\n\nThe Danish international’s contract at Mestalla was due to expire on 30 June and he had previously told the club he wasn’t going to sign a new deal. His deal with Atlético is expected to be until 30 June 2023."
