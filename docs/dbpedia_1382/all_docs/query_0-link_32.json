This was followed up by scoring his second goal of the season, in a 5–0 win against Vestsjælland. Reflecting in the first half of the season, Kahlenberg said: \"We have a high top level, and on our good days we are perhaps the best playing team in Denmark. But we have also seen that we have a too low bottom level and have been too easy to kiss. So that is our biggest challenge. The most disappointing have been the outcomes we have had in three or four matches, where the bottom level has simply been too low. We have, of course, been disappointed in ourselves. Also on behalf of the club and the supporters. We have felt a little stupid.\" However, he suffered a hip injury that eventually sidelined for the rest of the 2014–15 season. It was announced that Kahlenberg would be out somewhere between four and five months following surgery.
