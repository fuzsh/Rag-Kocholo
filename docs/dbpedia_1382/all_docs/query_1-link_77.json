        "text": "© photo Daniele Buffa/Image Sport\n\nDaniel Wass’ contract at Valencia CF expires next summer and the player’s intention seems to be to return to his home country Denmark and specifically to Brondby, the club where he learned his trade, according to Valencia-based journalist Héctor Gómez.\n\nValencia made him a renewal offer last summer when the player asked to leave for Marseille, but manager José Bordalás convinced him to stay as the French club’s offer was too low.\n\n“It could be that I’m starting to look at home. The situation is that I don’t think that far into the future, but it’s clear that in a month and a half I can start to look at what’s going to happen, and it will also be exciting,” Wass said while on international duty with Denmark this week.\n\nThe midfielder admits that he is not negotiating his renewal with Valencia. “I will have a good chat with my wife and my children about what is going to happen. I definitely think my family has the last word here.“\n\nNo negotiations between Valencia and Wass\n\n“We are not in talks. There is simply nothing,” he admitted.\n\nWass went on to explain that the decision on what he does will also be up to his family.\n\n“I’ve said many times before, it is not just my decision; it is also a decision for my wife and my children, who have been on the road for 11 years now. I’ve had a lot of experiences abroad, and it’s my eleventh year away, so it could be that I, both personally and family-wise, will start looking at home, or maybe other clubs will come in.”\n\nThe Danish international remains a key player for Bordalás and has played consistently for Los Che in La Liga this season."
