        "text": "Daniel Wass, Valencia CF’s versatile, multi-position utility man, is an interesting character off the field as well. In a #YouAskVCF interview with fans, he answered all kinds of questions about confinement, his favourite music, his best moments in football and more besides.\n\n@escuadravcf: If you weren’t a footballer, what would you have liked to have been?\n\nIf I hadn’t become a footballer, I’d have been a chef. I love cooking and trying out new things; you can always find me in the kitchen.\n\n@kikecervera_: Of all the positions that you can play, which is your favourite?\n\nI don’t have a favourite position. The most important thing is playing every weekend. Whatever position I am put in, I try to do as best as possible to help my teammates to win.\n\nCristian LR Vcf: What is the best and the worst thing about being at home during the lockdown?\n\nThe worst thing is that you can’t train with your teammates. Every day you are by yourself at home, which is the worst thing. The best thing is that we can disconnect from football a little after so many games, and following this break we will be ready to play again and do the best we can.\n\n_menaprivv_: What is your secret to being consistent at such a high level during the season?\n\nThere’s no secret, I just try to do things as well as possible every day, and try to be at the best level -physically and mentally- all the time.\n\n@branderwiek17: What is the place that you like the most in Valencia (besides Mestalla)\n\nMy favourite place in Valencia is the riverbed. I like to go there with my family and play, take a walk… it’s a very beautiful place.\n\nignacioj_1809: Who is your favourite Valencia CF legend?\n\nFor me it’s David Villa. He was a great player and one of the best strikers in Valencia CF’s history, scoring many goals here.\n\napollovcf: What type of music do you listen to?\n\nI listen to a lot of Drake. I like his music a lot. Reggaeton as well.\n\n@Sam_mat09: Will you stay at Valencia CF for a long time?\n\nI want to stay in Valencia for many more years. I’m very happy here. I’ve got two years left on my contract but I hope I can stay here for many more years.\n\nsir_pinguino_zando_2_: What is your biggest dream?\n\nMy biggest dream is to win more trophies. Last year, when we won the Copa del Rey, it was a very special day. As a footballer, I always want to win more trophies.\n\nsentimenttaronja_: What is your best footballing memory?\n\nThere are two: My first game for the Danish national team, which was a dream come true for me, and the Copa del Rey final, which I’ll never forget."
