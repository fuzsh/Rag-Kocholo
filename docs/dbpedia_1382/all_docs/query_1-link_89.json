        "text": "As the season draws to a close, football agents crawl out of their caves and transfer windows become the hotbed for clubs across the world. But how do we strengthen? Who do we buy? Guest blogger Danny Penfold offers up suggestions for our problem areas. Enjoy!\n\nWe have seen the ups and downs that many expected to see from Stoke this season. We’ve seen the home form depreciate this season but we have seen a great enrichment in the away form – seeing us pick up 7 away wins in all competitions thus far. I believe summer is a crucial time for us to strengthen the side in the right areas, and ensure that we continue to improve from this season’s exploits.\n\nEnsuring We’re In Safe Hands\n\nFirstly, this entire goalkeeping situation we have going on at the moment. We have recently seen Asmir Begovic dropped from the match day squad, being replaced by Jack Butland. I see this as a good move. In my eyes I think now is the right time to use Butland and make a name for himself on the Premier League stage. He has the Euro U21 tournament coming up this summer and hopefully he has a good one and carries his form into the coming Premier League season.\n\nEven though Asmir is a world class goalkeeper, there’s no denying that, this season he hasn’t been himself. We’ve seen mistake, after mistake from him this season, costing the club valuable points and league positions (which help bring in more money to the club), is it because the transfer rumours are getting to him?\n\nOnly he knows this, but I and many Stoke fans would be happy for him to branch out and play at the top level, ideally in a different country (Juventus in Italy springs to mind). I think Begovic will go and that we will go out and sign a capable number 2 for Jack Butland. The first names that I can think of are Ben Hamer (27) from Leicester City, Adam Bogdan (27) from Bolton Wanderers and Tom Heaton (29) from Burnley.\n\nCompleting The Full Backs\n\nOne comment, which I have seen, touted around is “WE NEED TO SORT THE DEFENCE OUT”. As much as I believe there are some aspects of our defending which are suspect to put it politely, there are only 7 teams who have conceded less goals than us this season. I believe that we are well stocked with some good centre backs. The likes of Shawcross, Muniesa, Wollscheid and Wilson are very capable at doing a job in the heart of the defence (my preferred being Shawcross and Muniesa).\n\nThe BIG problem with our defence is at right back the lack of pace and constant failure to stop crosses being whipped into the box from out wide. Too many times this season we have seen our full backs being terrorised by pacey, direct wingers such as Bolasie and Hazard; being allowed to get crosses in and run down the by-line without a challenge from the full back and have been made to pay as a consequence.\n\nMy pet hate though, is that all season, our management team have neglected putting men on the posts from corners. The amount of times we have witnessed Begovic picking the ball out of the net from a front post flick from corners being tapped in at an empty back post is very alarming. I feel that we should delve into the market for a pacey and adventurous right back who could be a threat whilst attacking as well as holding his own when on the back foot.\n\nThe names that pop into my mind are Daniel Wass from Evian Thonon Gaillard F.C., Kieran Trippier from Burnley and Dennis Diekmeier from Hamburger SV in the Bundesliga.\n\nAt the tender ages of 24 (Trippier) and 25 (Wass & Diekmeier) I feel that they are perfect for the system Mark Hughes is slowly, but surely, imposing. Wass and Diekmeier would surely cost less than £5m, belonging to bottom half teams in their respective leagues.\n\nTrippier would be a lot more expensive, considering he would be coming from a fellow English club, we could be looking at paying in excess of £8m to attain the services of Trippier. Daniel Wass arguably has the best record out of the trio – tallying up 8 goals and 5 assists. Trippier boasts a very good considering he is playing at a struggling Burnley side – 0 goals and 4 assists is a respectful return.\n\nDennis Diekmeier however, does not have a good return at all. Racking up 0 goals and 0 assists this season, this signing may be underwhelming according to stats, but watching him play this season, I see great potential there.\n\nTuning The Midfield Engine\n\nNow, moving onto the central midfield spot next to N’Zonzi. This is definitely a weak spot in the squad, having two very aging players in Whelan (31) and Sidwell (32) battling for the holding midfield role. There have also been times this season where Charlie Adam has filled in beside N’Zonzi in the weak spot in the squad.\n\nIn my view, we do not have a Matic type player who cleans up in front of the defence and covers all areas. We have Whelan, who we often see getting overpowered in the centre of the park and not really making his mark on a game. He is also one who loves to give a free kick away in dangerous areas in and around our box. The same could be said about Sidwell – he hasn’t played much this season, but when he has he has been our best option for the central role in my opinion.\n\nHis stint in the side in November before his injury was a revolutionary one (especially his MOTM performance in our 2-1 away win against Spurs), making most Stoke fans forget the silly foul against QPR which resulted in us dropping 2 points.\n\nThen we have big Charlie Adam. I think he is a good player, don’t get me wrong, but do I think he should be starting games for us in a deeper role? No, I don’t. I feel that he is too rash when challenging for the ball, he is a walking yellow card, meaning once he is inevitably booked, players can afford to run past him as he can’t afford to foul them. Granted, he can provide that bit of magic to get everyone off their feet, just look at his goals against Chelsea and Sunderland respectively.\n\nI would like him to stick around and come off the bench in some games; he can certainly turn a game on its head when he comes on. I have been looking at many options to fill into that holding midfield spot. These are Emmanuel Agyemang-Badu (24) from Udinese in Serie A, Havard Nordtveit (24) from Borussia Monchengladbach in the Bundesliga and Valon Behrami (30) from Hamburger SV in the Bundesliga.\n\nHaving watched Badu in the World Cup and African Nations, I can instantly tell that he is a great holding midfielder. His pace, energy and power see him win the ball back for his team, he reminds me of a young Michael Essien.\n\nHavard Nordtveit is my most preferred target. The former Arse(nal) player is technically great, strong, good in the air and is versatile, which is always a bonus!\n\nNow, Behrami is a player with experience, at 30 years old it could be worth snapping him up, he is big, strong and has shown at every level that he is one of the best at playing in front of the defence.\n\nUnleashing The Wingers\n\nOur wingers are possibly the most hit/miss with our fan base at the moment. Fans for some strange reason can’t get to grips with Arnautovic and still using that wonderfully silly phrase “he’s a luxury we cannot afford”. That is nonsense, with better players around him who are on his wavelength (Diouf, Bojan, N’Zonzi) he excels. He gets slagged off by many saying that he’s lazy, yet he’s the one busting a gut tracking back to win the ball back for his team. I would keep him in the starting 11, on the left hand side too.\n\nWe need to either sign up Moses on a permanent deal or replace him with someone better. Jon Walters is good, but having him play against the top teams is painful to watch at times, sometimes he just doesn’t have that quality to shine through. I would definitely keep him around and have Odemwingie around for another season too – he needs summer to recuperate and get back to full fitness. The options which I have singled out would be – Victor Moses (24) from Chelsea, Valentin Stocker (26) from Hertha Berlin in the Bundesliga and Yevhen Konoplyanka (25) who will be a free agent in the summer.\n\nWe’ve all seen our Vic; we know what he can do. He’s ******* ace! He has that ability to get the crowd off their feet and deliver that bit of quality from the wide areas. He does have a slight proneness to injury though, which is slightly concerning.\n\nValentin Stocker is one of my favourite players. He’s skilful, quick and has a great cross. He is definitely one who will be a fan favourite; he has torn apart defences for Basel in the Champions League and also has shown his worth this season in the Bundesliga.\n\nYevhan Konoplyanka, no matter how unpronounceable his name is, is a familiar face to English full backs. I still think that Glen Johnson has nightmares about being torn a new one when England faced Ukraine at Wembley. He’s quick, skilful and both footed. He may choose Stoke over the “higher rated” sides such as Spurs and Chelsea as he may have seen wingers such as Lamela and Salah fail to make a name for themselves when going in straight at the top.\n\nFinding the Lethal Finisher\n\nFinally, we move on to our strikers. Mame Diouf is without doubt the best striker at the club. Netting 9 goals in the league and being our top scorer is quite an achievement. Bear in mind he has been playing most of this season out on the wing and also missed a month and a half playing at the African Nations for Senegal.\n\nI do feel that Peter Crouch is past his prime now; it would be lovely to see him break Alan Shearers headed goals record though. I would look at bringing in a young replacement for big Pete, possibly looking at Jordan Rhodes (25) from Blackburn Rovers, Shinji Okazaki (29) from 1. FSV Mainz 05 in the Bundesliga and Mark Uth (23) from Heerenveen in the Eredivisie.\n\nJordan Rhodes is one of the best finishers of the ball that I have seen in a long while. He’s got a good strike with his feet, good heading ability and is definitely ready to take the step up to the Premier League.This deal does come with risks however, he may do a “David Nugent” and not live up to the hype and fizzle back down to the Championship, or he may do a “Charlie Austin” and take the league by storm and be up there with the top scorers in the league. Netting an impressive 21 in 45 this season, Rhodes is definitely worth mentioning for next season.\n\nShinji Okazaki is possibly one not heard of in England, but the boy can play! Clever movement, strong on the ball and a good finish, Okazaki may be a very shrewd signing for Stoke if we decide to make a move for him. Boasting 12 goals in 29 games is a respectful return for someone in a low Bundesliga side.\n\nFinally, a striker who I believe has a lot to offer is Mark Uth. He is a big German striker with a point to prove! Much like Pelle at Southampton, Uth is big, strong and great with the ball at his feet. He’s burst onto the scene in the Eredivisie and looks built to play in the Premier League. Netting a wonderful 15 goals in 31 appearances is great for the young German.\n\nThese are just some of the possible ways that I personally feel that we can improve our squad and what I see is going wrong from where I sit in the Britannia. Let me also point out that I think that we have improved from last season, if it wasn’t for the constant injuries throughout, who knows where we would have finished?\n\nFeel free to leave me some feedback!"
