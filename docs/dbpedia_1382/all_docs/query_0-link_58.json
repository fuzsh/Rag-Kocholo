        "text": "EURO 2020\n\nUkraine vs England live online: scores, stats and updates | Euro 2020\n\nDenmark will play the winner of the match between Ukraine and England in the semi-finals, with kick-off in Rome in just under an hour. You can follow that one live with Johnny here.\n\nThe last time Denmark made it this far at the Euros was of course 1992, when they went on to win it. In this form, with this momentum behind them, it's not beyond the realms of possibility they could do it again.\n\nPoulsen bursts from midfield again but nobody goes with him and he decides to have a go himself. It's on target but not well-hit enough to trouble Vaclik.\n\nCelustka and Soucek are both down for the Czechs, the latter after catching some of Poulsen's boot in the face and the former with what looks like a muscle problem.\n\nThe Leverkusen forward strikes again to get his side right back in this at the start of the second half! And that brings Schick level with Cristiano Ronaldo in the Golden Boot stakes. What a tournament he's having.\n\nThe stats from the first half are fairly even: seven shots apiece, two on target for the Czechs, three for the Danes, and 48-52 possession. The only one that matters though is the score board and that says 2-0 to the 1992 champions.\n\nA lovely ball down the flank from Vestergaard, Maehle clips it with the outside of the boot and Dolberg hits it first time with his instep to guide the ball past Vaclik! A wonderful goal and the Danes are firmly in the driving seat now.\n\nHoles! He wasn't really expecting that cross to reach him on the far side but pulled a snap shot out of his hat and forces Schmeichel into a save, albeit a comfortable one.\n\nA good period of possession hands the Czechs another corner. They have at least stemmed the tide of the Danish attack, which threatened to put the game away in the opening 15 minutes.\n\nIt's aimed towards Soucek at the far post but Christensen makes a nuisance of himself and it's off the shoulder of the West Ham midfielder and out for a goal kick.\n\nLarsen sends the ball in and the Dortmund midfielder is unmarked in the middle. He picks his spot and plants a header into the bottom corner and there was nothing Vaclik could do about that!\n\nJust one change for the Czechs this afternoon, Jan Boril coming in for Pavel Kaderabek at left-back after serving a one-game ban. Denmark coach Hjulmand unsurprisingly goes for the same XI that thumped Wales 4-0 in the last 16.\n\nThe Czechs meanwhile reached the final at Euro 96, four years after the Danes' triumph, losing to Germany but the nation has a staggering international record that Jaroslav Silhavy will be looking to build on to reach a first Euro semi-final since 2004.\n\nAs well as lifting the European Championship in 1976, the Czechs have been runners-up on semi-finalists on a further three occasions, in addition to reaching the 1934 and 1962 World Cup finals.\n\nDenmark won their only major international trophy in 1992 after famously \"coming off the beach\" at short notice to compete in the tournament in Sweden and few thought they would be in a position to challenge 28 years later.\n\nHowever, the cardiac arrest suffered by Christian Eriksen earlier in the competition has had a galvanizing effect and Kasper Hjulmand's side have gone on to score four in consecutive games for the first time in the nation's history at a tournament finals to reach this stage.\n\nItaly and Spain will contest the first semi-final on 6 July at Wembley Stadium after seeing off Belgium and Switzerland respectively yesterday.\n\nThe two sides today are seeking a place in the semi-finals of Euro 2020 and will face the winner of the later game between Ukraine and England.\n\nCzech Republic vs Denmark: welcome\n\nHello and welcome to AS English's live coverage of the third Euro 2020 quarter-final between Czech Republic and Denmark from the Olympic Stadium in Baku. Kick-off is at 18:00 CEST."
