        "text": "It's a bit strange that there is no mention of Amon being injured ... they have just reported that their next big sales object, Danish U21 NT central midfielder Mathias Jensen is injured and out the next month or so, and they also admit that it could be the last we have seen of Jensen at FCN, because he could be on the verge of moving abroad, but there is no mention of what is going on with Amon.\n\nAs for Mathias Jensen, then he has refused a move to Ajax but it's no secret that Celta Vigo are highly keen on getting him as the replacement for Stanislav Lobotka who they signed last year from FC Nordsjælland but now seem on his way to either Napoli or Fiorentina... FCN are demanding €8 million for Mathias Jensen, and Celta Vigo need to sell Lobotka (estimated €25 million transfer) before they are able to sign Jensen ...\n\nhttps://talksport.com/football/399013/napoli-fiorentina-stanislav-lobotka/\n\nhttp://eldesmarque.com/vigo/celta/noticias/111815-mathias-jensen-prioridad-absoluta\n\nCelta have already sold their Danish central midfielder Daniel Wass to Valencia for €6 million :\n\nhttps://www.transfermarkt.com/celta-vigo/alletransfers/verein/940\n\nFinally some actual news about Amon, that also include why FCN are not able to tell us that much ... translated from an interview with the Danish soccer website bold.dk\n\nHead coach Kasper Hjulmand must do without the key player [Mathias Jensen] against both Cliftonville in the Europa League qualifier on Thursday and for the time to come. > \"Mathias will be out for a while. The same goes for Jonathan Amon, while Magnus Kofod we expect to return starting Monday,\" < Hjulmand told bold.dk. Due to the new regulations regarding the privacy act (Persondataloven = Person-data-law), FCN are not able to reveal exactly how long Jensen and Amon are going to be out and sidelined, but a few days ago Jensen himself estimated that he will be out for around a month.\n\nhttps://www.bold.dk/fodbold/nyheder/hjulmand-overvejer-at-rotere-mod-cliftonville/\n\nEuropa League, 1st Qualifying Round, 2nd leg :\n\nFCN \"toddlers\" (Den) v Cliftonville (Nir), 2-1 (agg: 3-1)\n\n0-1 Joe Gormley (Pen. 6)\n\n1-1 Godsway Donyoh (58)\n\n2-1 Andreas Skov Olsen (83)\n\nThough fielding 8 reserve \"toddlers\" and only 3 players from their Superliga starting 11 against Esbjerg 4 days ago, FCN still managed to get past the part-timers from Cliftonville, securing a slim 2-1 win ... but not without a few bumps on the road, when they fell one goal behind after a corner and some clumsy defending and a penalty in the 5th minute by the young Ghanaian left back Clinton Antwi, who was getting his first-team debut after having been promoted from their Academy this summer. But to be fair, besides the penalty he looked good and did quite well in the rest of the match.\n\nFCN were dominating and passing the ball nicely, but their finishing was quite horrible, while the part-time visitors were fighting bravely but had trouble stringing more than two passes together and were simply much too slow paced for their counter-attacking to be of any real threat ... but obviously, being 0-1 down at half-time, the FCN coach subbed in his most experienced attacking midfielder Mikkel Rygaard and also the former Man City youth Godsway Donyoh who both made all the difference, with a goal and an assist, but having made 3 subs so early on, FCN got in a bit of trouble in the last 12 minutes or so, when Godsway suffered an injury and FCN suddenly were down to 10 men in the rest of the match ... fortunatly the 2-1 goal came shortly after, so that there were no real danger that Cliftonville would be able to profit much from playing 11 against 10, though they did manage to produce one very good attempt ...\n\nit was mentioned during the match, that Amon suffer from the same kind of injury as Mathias Jensen, so i guess Amon is still a few weeks from being ready to play, considering that Jensen got injured in the match against Esbjerg only 4 days ago and is 3-4 weeks away from a return.\n\nEuropa League, 2nd Qualifying Round, draw :\n\nFC Nordsjælland (Den) v AIK Stockholm (Swe)\n\nFirst leg: 26th July\n\nSecond leg: 2nd August\n\nNext oppenent in the EL qualifiers is going to be Swedish AIK Stockholm that managed to get past Shamrock Rovers also with a 1-0 away win in Ireland, but losing 0-1 at home and progressing after a 1-1 result AET...\n\nAIK finished 2nd in the Swedish league last season but are at the very top of the table so far this season :\n\nhttps://www.bold.dk/fodbold/sverige/allsvenskan/\n\nEuropa League, 2nd Qualifying Round, 2nd leg :\n\nAIK Stockholm (Swe) v FC Nordsjælland (Den), 0-1 (agg: 0-2)\n\n0-1 Andreas Skov Olsen (29)\n\nFCN won both the home and away leg against AIK Stockholm, that I may add are in mid season and is the undefeated league leaders in Sweden :\n\nhttps://www.bold.dk/fodbold/sverige/allsvenskan/\n\nBut it was the young FCN team that came much closer to a 2-0 or 3-0 win than AIK to scoring a goal ... and just to illustrate how young this FCN team really is I'm going to add the age to their starting 11 against an AIK team with 5 players at the age of 30 or older, including their 33-yo highly experienced Captain Sebastian Larsson who has played 282 games in the English PL and also played for Sweden at the WC-18 in Russia including all 90 minutes in their quarter-final against England ... Norwegian international and former Bundesliga winger/ striker Tarik Elyounoussi ... and a likewise aging Henok Goitom, that you may know for his very short stint in MLS... but generally speaking AIK seemed to lack both pace and the sense of urgency in compare with the much younger FCN team...\n\nBut here you are... the FCN line-up : 3-4-3\n\nNicolai Larsen (age 27) - Ulrik Yttergård Jenssen(19), Victor Nelsson(22), Andreas Skovgaard(21) - Karlo Bartolec (23),Jacob Steen Christensen (17), Captain : Magnus Kofod Andersen (19), Mads Mini Pedersen (21) - Andreas Skov Olsen, (18), Mikkel Damsgaard (18), Mikkel Rygaard (27) ...\n\n'Man of the match' was the only 18-yo winger Andreas Skov Olsen who has just been promoted from the FCN Academy this summer, but still vastly outshined all the other players in this match and surely is going to be the next big sales object for FCN, besides Danish U-21 international and their usual Captain Mattias Jensen who unfortunately is injured and out right now just like Amon.\n\nBoth Mattias Jensen and Amon are greatly missed, and would be able to raise the level, but FCN still just keep impressing no matter who they field, inspite their very young age ... According to their coach they are on their way, but still around 5 years away from being the best in Europe at developing young talents and the 1st team level they believe they will be able to reach ...\n\nNext job for FCN in Europe is Partizan Beograd from Serbia .. a team no better than AIK in my opinion :\n\nEuropa League, 3rd Qualifying Round, draw :\n\nFC Nordsjælland (Den) v Partizan Beograd (Srb)\n\n.\n\nIt must have been a rude awakening for AIK in the Europa League qualifiers to first look at the average age of their roster and then at the young players just before the match, thinking that they will be up against a Danish youth team and then suddely facing reality when they have actually faced them on the field, to discover that this FCN team is vastly better than their age would imply and suggest... Should they manage to qualify, then I suspect it will be the youngest team ever to have played in a EL Group Stage.\n\nVery surprising that they got past AIK. It also highlights how well the Danish league is doing of late. They're not just the best Scandinavian league by far (back in the day, the Allsvenskan had that honor), but at this point are right behind the Dutch in the UEFA ranking.\n\nPS: I see they got Partizan for the nest round. At this point FCN should be favorites. For the play-off, they have a shot against most anyone except Sevilla IMO.\n\nThe Swedish league was the best of Scandinavia in Europe up until 1991, not least because they were semi-professionals back then while the rest of Scandinavia were strictly amateur leagues until 1986 when Brøndby turned full-time professionals, Norwegian Rosenborg then followed suit in the early 90's and since then the Swedish league for the most part has been either the 2nd or the 3rd best in Scandinavia behind the Danish Superliga and the Norwegian league (though only due to the results of Rosenborg). So you could say that the Norwegian league is not really that good, but depend on Rosenborg doing well.\n\nExcept for a 1-year down period, the Danish Superliga has been the vastly better Scandinavian league in Europe since 2008... this season Malmö still got the chance of qualifying for the Champions league, but the other 3 Swedish teams have already been knocked out, with AIK being their supposed strongest participant this season.\n\nIf you look at the present 5-year league ranking :\n\nhttps://kassiesa.home.xs4all.nl/bert/uefa/data/method5/crank2019.html\n\n... then the Superliga is far ahead of the rest of Scandinavia and right behind the Dutch league, but it's worth noticing that the Netherlands did quite terrible last season and have already lost AZ Alkmaar this season, while if you look 5 years back, then Denmark had it's worst season, which results will be removed when this season has finished and then the ranking will look like this, unless the remaining teams from the Netherlands really step up and do much better this season :\n\nhttps://kassiesa.home.xs4all.nl/bert/uefa/data/method5/crank2020.html\n\nIn all honesty i have now had a closer look at the Partizan Belgrade team and they do look stronger than AIK, but not quite as good as they have been in the past, so I think this is perhaps slightly in favor of Partizan, considering that they are much more experienced playing in Europe.\n\nWe must not forget that it has been 5 years since the last time FCN have played in Europe and that their huge investment in their present youth Academy + the African Right to Dream Academy ownership is only of a 2 years standing ... so they are still pretty far from where they want to be ... it will probably take another 4-5 years before they reach their full potential, both Academy wise and in Europe.\n\nThe club ranking mainly show how good the league is doing in Europe in general... the problem with the individual ranking of clubs is that we all know that FC København only finished 4th in the Superliga last season, but still they are ranked 43 in Europe above Olympique Marseille, AC Milan and RB Leipzig and so they are also much more likely to reach yet another group stage due to their past experience and very high seeding.\n\nPratizan are ranked 78 in Europe and are favored by the Serbian league clubs being no better than they have finish either 1st or 2nd the past 20 years in a row and so are able to pick up a higer ranking and seeding due to playing in Europe every season.\n\nIt's more difficult to qualify for Europe from the Danish Superliga and it has been 5 years since the last time FCN qualified to play in Europe, so their ranking and seeding is terrible and so it is an uphill battle to quailfy for a group stage."
