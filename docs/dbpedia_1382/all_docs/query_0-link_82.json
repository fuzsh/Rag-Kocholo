Drawn in a group that included Portugal, who have the world’s second-best-player, Cristiano Ronaldo, few pundits believed the Danes could overcome such opposition.\n\nBut thanks to a campaign based on stering home form, where they concded just one goal (to Ronaldo), they marched into Poland/Ukraine as group winners. Here, they will again lock horns with the Portuguese – plus the Dutch and the Germans. Yes, the Group of Death awaits the Danes and they are expected to be the fish food.\n\nThey won’t mind that, though. They weren’t given a chance 20 years ago, under the stewardship of a manager who had planned on renovating his kitchen over the summer, yet they beat France, Holland and Germany to lift the trophy.\n\nExcept for Liverpool’s Daniel Agger and the exciting Ajax midfielder Christian Eriksen, this side are as unremarkable as John Jensen and co were in 1992. Agger aside, Denmark’s back line appears shaky and with the inconsistent Nicklas Bendtner leading the line, goals may be hard to come by. Considering the pedigree of function Danish teams, though, it would be foolish to write them off.\n\nBut it seems unlikely the inventors of Lego will be able to build on their qualifying success.\n\nHOW THEY GOT THERE\n\n07/09/2010 – Group H – Denmark 1-0 Iceland\n\n08/10/2010 – Group H – Portugal 3-1 Denmark\n\n12/10/2010 – Group H – Denmark 2-0 Cyprus\n\n26/03/2011 – Group H – Norway 1-1 Denmark\n\n04/09/2011 – Group H – Iceland 0-2 Denmark\n\n06/09/2011 – Group H – Denmark 2-0 Norway\n\n07/10/2011 – Group H – Cyprus 1-4 Denmark\n\n11/10/2011 – Group H – Denmark 2-1 Portugal\n\nHOME AND AWAY KITS\n\nGROUP FIXTURES – GROUP B\n\nSaturday, 09/06 – Netherlands v Denmark (Kharkiv, 17:00)\n\nWednesday, 13/06 – Denmark v Portugal (Lviv, 17:00)\n\nSunday, 17/06 – Denmark v Germany (Lviv, 19:45)\n\nFINAL SQUAD\n\nGoalkeepers: Stephan Andersen (Évian Thonon Gaillard FC), Anders Lindegaard (Manchester United FC), Kasper Schmeichel (Leicester City FC).\n\nDefenders: Lars Jacobsen (FC København), Daniel Wass (Évian Thonon Gaillard FC), Daniel Agger (Liverpool FC), Simon Kjær (AS Roma), Andreas Bjelland (FC Nordsjælland), Simon Poulsen (AZ Alkmaar), Jores Okore (FC Nordsjælland).\n\nMidfielders: Christian Poulsen (Évian Thonon Gaillard FC), Jakob Poulsen (FC Midtjylland), William Kvist (VfB Stuttgart), Niki Zimling (Club Brugge KV), Thomas Kahlenberg (Évian Thonon Gaillard FC), Christian Eriksen (AFC Ajax), Michael Silberbauer (BSC Young Boys), Lasse Schøne (NEC Nijmegen).\n\nForwards: Dennis Rommedahl (Brøndby IF), Nicklas Bendtner (Arsenal FC), Michael Krohn-Dehli (Brøndby IF), Tobias Mikkelsen (FC Nordsjælland), Nicklas Pedersen (FC Groningen).\n\nTHE CAPTAIN – DANIEL AGGER\n\nHas been beset by injury for most his on-off Liverpool career, but when Danuel Agger is in full pomp, he is a rock at the back and a commanding presence bombing forward with an imperious left foot. It will be important in the group stage for his partnership with Simon Kjaer to remain firm under myriad assaults. If he plays well, this Danish side could begin to gain confidence.\n\nTHE KEEPER – ANDERS LINDEGAARD\n\nA late fitness test confirmed his inclusion in the squad and with the Stoke City keeper, Thomas Sorensen ruled out with injury, the Manchester United stopper is set to become the Danes new number one for the finals. Anders Lindegaard had a very good first full season with the Red Devils making eleven appearances and keeping seven clean sheets before he was ruled out for the 2nd half of the season with an ankle injury.\n\nSTAR MAN – CHRISTIAN ERIKSEN\n\nWithout question Denmark’s most exciting talent since Michael Laudrup, the sublime feet and imaginative mind of Christian Eriksen have been alerting all the major European clubs of late. His stubborn refusal to entertain their advances for fear of missing first-team football speaks volumes for his grounded attitude and determination to grow as a player, as well as a commodity. Very much in the mould of Rafael van der Vaart and Wesley Sneijder, Eriksen will operate in the hole, exploiting gaps in the midfield and defence with cunning efficiency. A star in the making.\n\nTHE MANAGER – MORTEN PER OLSEN\n\nCaptain of the legendary ‘Dynamite’ team of the mid-1980s and the first Dane to reach 100 caps, Morten Per Olsen is one of the most respected managers at UEFA EURO 2012, and also the longest-serving. Given the current crop of Denmark players, you can understand his pragmatic approach. It will be his use of Christian Eriksen at UEFA EURO 2012 that turns this side from businesslike to cut-throat. If anyone can do it, though, Danish supporters will be the first to admit their faith is in Morten Per Olsen.\n\nTOURNAMENT PREDICTION"
