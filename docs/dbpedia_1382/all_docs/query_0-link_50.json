        "text": "We continue our countdown to the 14th edition of the European Championship to be hosted by Poland and Ukraine between June 8 and July 1, 2012 .Denmark have their UEFA Euro 2012 hopes in danger as they’ve been drawn against hot favourites Germany and the Netherlands in the Group of Death.Denmark kick off their EURO 2012 campaign against the Netherlands on June 9.The Netherlands and Germany are two of the world’s best teams. Portugal are ranked highly and have the best player in the tournament.\n\nComparisons with 1992 achievements are unavoidable every time Denmark earns the right to participate in a big tournament. Euro 2012 is not an exception.\n\nDenmark’s shock victory at Euro ’92 was one of the most remarkable stories in the tournament’s history. The Danes were beaten to a qualifying spot by Yugoslavia, but civil war in the Balkans meant the Yugoslavs were not allowed to compete.Little was expected from the Danes, yet they beat France and the Netherlands to reach the final, where they defeated Germany through goals from John Jensen and Kim Vilfort.Denmark is the least populated country to ever win the European Championship.\n\nYoungsters like Simon Kjær (23), Andreas Bjelland (23) and injured Nicolai Boilesen (20) have already been hot topics in recent transfer speculations. William Kvist and Niki Zimling constantly show solid performances for their teams.\n\nExperienced trio Christian Poulsen (90 caps),Stoke City’s Sørensen (100 caps) and Ajax-star Dennis Rommedahl (114 caps) are still vital for their national team. The experience might become the factor for the Danes.\n\nMorten Olsen’s tactics is built on strong defence but his regular defenders (especially Simon Kjær) make silly mistakes for their clubs from time to time.\n\nStatistics against\n\nPortugal\n\nThe last two times in Copenhagen were must-win visits for Portugal, where they did not pass the test and were ought to try their luck in play-offs. However, the most thrilling match took place in Lisboa in 2008, where yet another boring match was about to finish with a score of 1-0, when suddenly the teams went wild five minutes before the final whistle. At first it got 1-1, a minute later 2-1, four minutes later 2-2 and deep inside the injury time 2-3, with Daniel Jensen leaving Portugal in shock.\n\nGermany\n\nDenmark’s record in 25 previous meetings with Germany is 8 wins 3 draws and 14 defeats. However, they hold the upper hand in competitive fixtures, where they have won two of three encounters.The Danes have not lost in their last three meetings with Germany – all friendlies – recording wins in Copenhagen and Duisburg, and a draw in the Danish capital.\n\nThe match between those two teams in the Swedish capital back in 1992 has been the most important one in Denmark’s football history. The fairy tale ended as it was meant to. Denmark won 2-0 against probably the best team in the world. Absolutely amazing tournament with even more amazing final!\n\nNetherlands\n\nThe Netherlands, hot favourites to win the trophy in 1992 ,were eliminated by the Danes. The match ended 2-2 and the Danish legend Peter Schmeichel saved Marco Van Basten’s penalty.\n\nTHE OLSEN GANG| Eight-year absence\n\nAfter an eight-year absence, Danish Dynamite (ranked 10th in the world) is once again set to explode on the elite european footballing scene. The Scandinavians missed out on EURO 2008 in Austria and Switzerland.\n\nDenmark played some of the most attractive football at EURO 2004 in Portugal, but came up against the in-form Czech Republic in the quarter-finals and lost 3-0.\n\nWith their long absence from the major stage now poised to end, captain Daniel Agger and his men are keen to cut a dash in Poland and Ukraine.\n\nHOW THEY QUALIFIED\n\nDenmark secured first place in Group H following their showdown with Portugal in the final group fixture, Michael Krohn-Dehli & Sunderland striker Nicklas Bendtner scored to clinch automatic qualification. The result meant Portugal would have to settle for a play-off place. Morten Olsen’s squad showed quality at the back, only conceding 6 goals from 8 fixtures and were only defeated once away to Portugal, 3-1. The Danes scored 15 goals this campaign, Nicklas Bendtner and Dennis Rommedahl were joint top-scorers with 3 goals each.\n\nGROUP H\n\nGP W D L GD PTS 1 Denmark (Q) 8 6 1 1 9 19 2 Portugal (P) 8 5 1 2 9 16 3 Norway 8 5 1 2 3 16 4 Iceland 8 1 1 6 -8 4 5 Cyprus 8 0 2 6 -13 2\n\nTOP SCORERS\n\n3 – Nicklas Bendtner, Dennis Rommedahl\n\n2 – Michael Krohn-Delhi, Morten Skoubo\n\n1 – Kasper Lorentzen, Lasse Schone, Christian Eriksen, Lars Jacobsen\n\nPAST RECORDS IN THE EUROS\n\n1960\n\nDid not qualify\n\n1988\n\nGroup Stage\n\n1964\n\nFourth place\n\n1992\n\nWinners\n\n1968\n\nDid not qualify\n\n1996\n\nGroup Stage\n\n1972\n\nDid not qualify\n\n2000\n\nGroup stage\n\n1976\n\nDid not qualify\n\n2004\n\nQuarter-finalists\n\n1980\n\nDid not qualify\n\n2008\n\nDid not qualify\n\n1984\n\nSemi-finalists\n\n2012\n\nQualified as group winners\n\nTHE MANAGER | Morten Olsen\n\nThe Danish Football Association (DBU) was so satisfied with the qualifying results that they hurried to persuade Morten Per Olsen (62) to wait a couple of years before he would retire.Olsen became the first Dane to play 100 games for the national team in April 1989, before ending his national team career in June 1989.The former Denmark captain played a total 102 games and scored four goals for the national team,and set a record of 50 games as Danish national team captain.\n\nMorten Olsen was appointed Head Coach after Denmark’s Euro 2000 campaign replacing Swedish coach Bo Johansson. Before managing Denmark Olsen was in charge at Ajax for just one season, winning both the Eredivise championship and Dutch Cup.He has not been the most successful manager, but he managed to earn next round tickets for his team outperforming rivals like France in World Cup 2002 and Italy in Euro 2004. They only need to add Germany or Netherlands to this list, as we’ve seen them advance Portugal twice during last 4 years.He came under heavy criticism when he failed to guide the team to Euro 2008.\n\nOlsen weathered the storm though and led the Danes to the 2010 World Cup and now has a chance to make his mark in Poland and Ukraine.Olsen wants Michael Laudrup to succeed him as national team manager.\n\nTHE CAPTAIN | Daniel Agger\n\nA left-footed central defender with a formidable long-range shot, Daniel Munthe Agger (27) has been a Liverpool FC player since January 2006, but much of his time at Anfield has been spent recovering from injury. An ever-present for Denmark at the 2010 FIFA World Cup, he is set to captain his country at UEFA EURO 2012.The Liverpool defender was handed the captain’s armband when Olsen dropped Christian Poulsen from the squad for the encounter against Norway last year.\n\nAgger came through the youth system at Brøndby IF and experienced a brilliant debut season in the Superligaen, making 26 appearances and scoring five goals as the club won the Danish league and cup double under coach Michael Laudrup.\n\nHe was handed his senior international debut in a friendly against Finland in Tampere on 2 June 2005.He scored his first goal for Morten Olsen’s team three months later during a 2006 FIFA World Cup qualifier versus Georgia (6-1). He has scored 5 goals in 44 appearances for Denmark.\n\nAgger left for European champions Liverpool midway through 2005/06 season and made a major impact the following term, notably in the UEFA Champions League, starting 11 matches and scoring the only goal in the second leg of the semi-final against Chelsea FC at Anfield, which Liverpool won on penalties and played in the Athens showpiece defeat by AC Milan.\n\nThe skipper missed most of 2007/08 with a foot injury but returned to assist Liverpool in finishing second in the 2008/09 Premier League and help Denmark end six years in the international wilderness by qualifying for the 2010 World Cup.He started all three fixtures in South Africa.\n\nThe tattoo artist finally reached 100 Premier League appearances for Liverpool in October 2011 and won his first trophy with the club in February 2012 as the Merseysiders overcame Cardiff City FC on penalties in the League Cup final – although he was substituted before the shoot-out with yet another injury.\n\nThe fans of Danish Dynamite will be hoping Agger can stay fit and play a leading role in Poland and Ukraine.\n\nGOAL MACHINE| Nicklas Bendtner\n\nGENIUS | Christian Eriksen\n\nThis season,he won the Eredivisie with Ajax for the second successive time.He scored 7 goals for the team from Amsterdam,providing 15 assists.He has scored 2 goals in 21 caps for Denmark.\n\nSTAR | Dennis Rommedahl\n\nA four-time Eredivisie winner with PSV, pacy winger Rommedahl (33) reached his century of international caps shortly after participating at the 2010 FIFA World Cup − his third major international tournament.\n\nCopenhagen-born, he made his debut for Lyngby at 17 and was transferred to PSV at 18. He helped the Eredivisie outfit win four Dutch titles , though his best individual campaign came in 2001/02, when he scored 11 goals in 34 league appearances as PSV finished runners-up to Ajax.\n\nThe winger enjoyed an impressive introduction to international football, making his debut for Denmark in Morten Olsen’s first game in charge, against the Faroe Islands in August 2000, scoring both goals in a 2-1 friendly win at home to Germany three months later and starting 32 internationals in a row.\n\nHis unbroken run lasted almost three years. He was part of Denmark’s 2002 FIFA World Cup team, where he excelled, scoring the opening goal in a 2-0 defeat of France that eliminated the holders.He was later voted 2002 Danish footballer of the year.\n\nHe also represented Denmark at EURO 2004, starting the first two matches and coming on as substitute in the next two after losing his place to Jesper Grønkjær.\n\nRommedahl left PSV for English Premier League club Charlton after 7 years with the club but returned to the Netherlands in 2007 to join Ajax, with whom he won the Dutch Cup in the 2009/10 season.\n\nHe impressed again for his country at the 2010 World Cup, playing every minute.Denmark’s group stage early exit left him on 99 caps but he reached a century that August in a Copenhagen friendly against Germany, marking the occasion with his 18th international goal.\n\nHe won the Greek title in 2010/11, his one and only season with Olympiacos, after which he signed a two-year deal with Brøndby and returned to his homeland after 14 years abroad.\n\nThe 33-year-old was the team’s joint top scorer in the qualifiers.The Brondby man has made 114 appearances for his country and will look to add to his 21 goals in what could be his last tournament.\n\nCan the Danish Dynamite explode again?\n\nThis article was written by Nana Abiri (@NOKA88)"
