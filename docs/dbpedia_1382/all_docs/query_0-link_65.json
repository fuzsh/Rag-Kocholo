        "text": "On a rainy, windy night, the U.S. took the lead twice, but surrendered it both times, then fell victim to a beautiful pass and finish from Christian Eriksen and Nicklas Bendtner to lose, 3–2, in Aarhus on Wednesday.\n\nFirst half\n\nThe U.S. lined up with Nick Rimando in goal; Timmy Chandler, Michael Orozco, John Brooks, and Greg Garza in defense; Gyasi Zardes, Alejandro Bedoya, Michael Bradley (captain), and Fabian Johnson in midfield; and Jozy Altidore partnering Aron Johannsson in a front two.\n\nThe U.S. started fairly well, keeping Denmark at bay, but with Bradley and Bedoya outnumbered in midfield, the Americans were too loose in their passing and had difficulty maintaining possession.\n\nDenmark, however, wasn’t doing much with the ball, either, reduced to a few crosses into the U.S. box that were relatively easily dealt with. However, the Danes grew into the game and began to dominate possession, with Christian Eriksen pulling the strings. In the 16th, Michael Krohn-Dehli took a pull-back from Eriksen and nearly placed a bending ball on Nicklas Bendtner’s foot at the back post. Moments later, after another good ball from Eriksen was cleared, Chandler lost a challenge with Nicolai Boilesen, who ran into the box and crossed. Eriksen picked the ball up and had a shot from a tight angle but missed high and wide.\n\nDenmark seemed sure to score soon, but from the restart on Eriksen’s missed shot, the U.S. went ahead. Chandler played a one-two with Bedoya on the right side, drove upfield, then launched a long crossfield pass over the top to Altidore, who finished from an acute angle with a difficult left-foot volley.\n\nDenmark was shaken by the goal, and the U.S. came back into the game, but the Danes would regain their control soon. And, on 33 minutes, the best passing move of the game resulted in Denmark’s equalizer. Eriksen and co. played one-touch passes around Garza and into the U.S. box, where Daniel Wass had a clear crossing opportunity. His ball was flicked on by Lasse Vibe to Bendtner, who was unmarked for a tap-in. Both Zardes and Chandler were well out of position, marking no one, on the play.\n\nThe U.S. looked to see out the half even, but nearly gave away an eerily similar goal in the 45th. Garza was beaten or fouled by Vibe, depending on your point of view. Vibe sent in a low cross to Bendtner, but the big striker couldn’t apply the finishing touch, and his flicked attempt went wide.\n\nSecond half\n\nThe U.S. made two subs at halftime, bringing on Brek Shea and Alfonso Morales for Johnson and Bedoya. Denmark nearly took advantage of the U.S. while those players settled in, repeatedly cutting through the U.S. midfield on the left side.\n\nDenmark was dominant, with Bendtner nearly getting his second after a Danish goalkick split the U.S. center backs, but his shot was wide. Eriksen was beginning to really sing, playing a one-touch pass over the U.S. defense to Vibe in the 57th, but Vibe’s volley went high and wide.\n\nBut in the 66th, the U.S. would go in front. An excellent entry ball over the top from Bradley found Altidore alone in the box with only the keeper to beat. Instead, he centered the ball to Johannsson, who poked home. Great movement from Shea had freed Altidore for the run, and the pass and finish were spot on.\n\nThe U.S. made subs and the game quieted down, with the U.S. seeming to do better than in the first half to hold the ball and shield the defense when without it. But Denmark grew increasingly dangerous again, pushing the U.S. deeper and deeper, and in the 83rd, Bendtner would find the second equalizer. A cross from the U.S.’s left touchline deflected high and fell toward the center of the goal, where Chandler nodded a header down, straight to Bendtner, who sidefooted home from six yards.\n\nWhile giving up the lead hurt, the U.S. still looked to hold onto the draw, but in the 91st, Eriksen would have the final word, again playing a phenomenal diagonal ball behind the U.S. defense to Bendtner, who took it out of the air with one touch, then laced a perfect volley across goal into the one stretch of net Rimando could not cover.\n\nThe U.S. had one final chance, and should have earned that draw. Bradley took a deep free kick from the left and sent a perfect ball into the box, freezing the keeper on his line. Brooks was there with a free header, but placed it well wide. He should have done better, but it was not to be.\n\nU.S. verdict\n\nJozy continues his scoring form: Make it four in six for Altidore in the U.S. uniform. He looked dangerous on the ball when he had it; he just didn’t have it enough.\n\nAltidore/Johannsson partnership a work in progress: In the first half, both strikers tried and failed to find each other, and were too often parallel, rather than aligned vertically, creating a big gap between them and midfield. In the second, they connected for a goal, but it may have been their only connection on the night.\n\nBradley better: This was much more like the Michael Bradley U.S. fans like to see. With a ton of ground to cover, he was all-action, touching nearly every blade of grass on the pitch. His free kicks were consistently dangerous, and it was his pass that earned the U.S. its second goal, and should have earned it its third.\n\nU.S. wide defense a mess: Chandler was especially bad defensively, at fault in part for two of the goals, but Denmark was consistently able to cross balls from the wings to dangerous areas without getting closed down fast enough. It was a rough night for both fullbacks, and their midfield support wasn’t good enough.\n\nFinal thoughts\n\nAt halftime of the ESPN broadcast, a graphic was shown that reported that, since the World Cup, the U.S. had scored ten first-half goals and given up three, while giving up nine second-half goals and scoring none. While the scoring hoodoo was broken, the U.S. again failed to hold on in a second half. After a while, it’s not simply coincidence. Something isn’t quite right with the U.S. defensively, whether it be communication, tactics, or something else, and it needs to be sorted out, stat. While the U.S. didn’t play that great, it could have, and perhaps should have won this game, and certainly should have had the draw.\n\nUSA\n\n1-Nick Rimando; 21-Timothy Chandler, 15-Michael Orozco (19-Ventura Alvarado, 80), 6-John Brooks, 3-Greg Garza; 20-Gyasi Zardes (2-DeAndre Yedlin, 67) 11-Alejandro Bedoya (7-Alfredo Morales, 46), 4-Michael Bradley (capt.), 23-Fabian Johnson (13-Brek Shea, 46); 17-Jozy Altidore, 9-Aron Johannsson (18-Rubio Rubin, 67)\n\nSubs not used: 5-Tim Ream, 10-Miguel Ibarra, 14-Danny Williams, 16-Julian Green, 22-Williams Yarbrough\n\nHead Coach: Jurgen Klinsmann\n\nDenmark\n\n16-Stephan Andersen; 2-Daniel Wass, 3-Simon Kjar, 4-Erik Sviatchenko, 5-Nicolai Bollesen (17-Simon Busk Poulsen, 53); 7-William Kvist (23-Anders Christiansen, 46), 18-Jakob Poulsen (19-Thomas Delaney, 46), 21-Lasse Vibe (8-Martin Braithwaite, 74), 10-Christian Eriksen (capt.); 9-Michael Krohn-Dehli (14-Lasse Schöne, 78), 11-Nicklas Bendtner\n\nSubs not used: 1-Kasper Schmeichel, 6-Las Jacobsen, 12-Mathias Zanka Jorgensen, 13-Kian H.
