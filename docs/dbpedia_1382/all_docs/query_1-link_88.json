        "text": "The Denmark World Cup 2022 squad is finally complete, after manager Kasper Hjulmand named the final five players of his 26-man team travelling to Qatar in November.\n\nWith Christian Eriksen back in action, Denmark head to Qatar determined to take on the big boys again.\n\nConfidence is high after last year’s European Championship semi-final was followed by a dominant qualifying campaign, and the squad looks strong, led by the impressive Kasper Hjulmand. Denmark will expect to progress ahead of Tunisia and Australia and hope to challenge France for top spot, because Lionel Messi and Argentina will likely be lying in wait for the runners-up.\n\nThey won't fear anyone, though. The Danish Dynamite won nine from nine in qualification for the Qatar World Cup 2022, not even conceding a goal in their first eight, before losing their final game in Scotland to tie with Germany as Europe’s top qualifiers on 27 points. It proved this team’s quality, as did home-and-away Nations League wins against a full-strength France, their Group C rivals. Confidence is high.\n\nIndeed, their defensive organisation is a key strength. Crystal Palace defender Joachim Andersen deputised impressively alongside Barcelona’s Andreas Christensen in the long-term absence of injured skipper Simon Kjaer, but the Milan centre-back’s return from serious knee knack only adds to the options in front of keeper Kasper Schmeichel. Thomas Delaney, Christian Norgaard, Pierre-Emile Hojbjerg and Eriksen offer great midfield balance.\n\nIt isn't clear who will score the goals, though. For all of the talent in defence and midfield, there’s no top talisman in the squad. Kasper Dolberg lacks consistency, while Yussuf Poulsen and Martin Braithwaite each average a goal every six internationals.\n\nRegardless, they'll impress with dynamic, high-pressure football. Hojbjerg is the team’s heart and lungs, and the skilful, fleet-of-foot Joakim Maehle will not give opposition right-backs a moment’s rest.\n\nDenmark World Cup 2022 squad\n\nDenmark World Cup 2022 squad: The final 26-man team\n\nGK: Kasper Schmeichel, Nice\n\nGK: Oliver Christensen, Hertha Berlin\n\nGK: Frederik Ronnow, Union Berlin\n\nDF: Simon Kjaer, AC Milan\n\nDF: Joachim Andersen, Crystal Palace\n\nDF: Daniel Wass, Brondby\n\nDF: Joakim Maehle, Atalanta\n\nDF: Andreas Christensen, Barcelona\n\nDF: Rasmus Kristensen, Leeds United\n\nDF: Jens Stryger Larsen, Trabzonspor\n\nDF: Victor Nelsson, Galatasaray\n\nDF: Alexander Bah, Benfica\n\nMF: Thomas Delaney, Sevilla\n\nMF: Mathias Jensen, Brentford\n\nMF: Christian Eriksen, Manchester United\n\nMF: Pierre-Emile Hojbjerg, Tottenham\n\nMF: Christian Norgaard, Brentford\n\nFW: Yussuf Poulsen, RB Leipzig\n\nFW: Andreas Skov Olsen, Club Brugge\n\nFW: Jesper Lindstrom, Eintracht Frankfurt\n\nFW: Andreas Cornelius, Copenhagen\n\nFW: Martin Braithwaite, Espanyol\n\nFW: Jonas Wind, Wolfsburg\n\nFW: Kasper Dolberg, Sevilla\n\nFW: Robert Skov, Hoffenheim\n\nFW: Mikkel Damsgaard, Brentford\n\nDenmark top scorers\n\nHere are Denmark's World Cup 2022 top scorers so far:\n\n1 goal: Andreas Christiansen\n\nDenmark yellow cards\n\nHere are Denmark's World Cup 2022 yellow cards so far:\n\n1 yellow card: Mathias Jensen, Rasmus Kristensen, Andreas Christensen, Andreas Cornelius\n\nDenmark manager\n\nWho is Denmark's manager for the 2022 World Cup?\n\nKasper Hjulmand is a national hero, having guided Denmark to the Euro 2020 semi-finals. Players praise his style of football, tactical flexibility – he switches regularly from a 4-3-3 to a back three – and man-management, and as the team continues to perform, the 50-year-old has piqued the interest of several European heavyweights.\n\nDenmark's star player\n\nWho is Denmark's best player?\n\nChristian Eriksen will be hugely motivated for this World Cup, after highlighting it as the main targetin hi s first public interview after his heart stopped beating at Euro 2020 last summer. It’s a miracle he is playing at all, yet his early-season form for Manchester United has even suggested he can again be the magician he was at Tottenham.\n\nHow many players are Denmark allowed to take to the 2022 World Cup?\n\nNational managers were allowed to bring 26 players to last summer’s European Championship for the first time at a major tournament, as a special measure brought in due to the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nNow 26-player squads have returned for the Qatar World Cup, an expansion from the usual 23-man teams."
