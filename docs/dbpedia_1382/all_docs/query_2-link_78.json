We have good players, we're in the Champions League and last season the team won the league, it's a very competitive team.\"\n\nWhen pressed further on his desire to represent Los Colchoneros, the Danish international wasn't able to hide his excitement.\n\n\"When I got the call from Atletico, I said 'Of course I want to go', it's a club that has won so many titles,\" Wass continued.\n\n\"They have great fans that help the team a lot.\""
