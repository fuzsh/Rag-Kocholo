        "text": "England is into the EURO 2020 Final after downing Denmark 2-1 in extra time.\n\nBoth sides couldn't be split after 90-minutes of regulation play, forcing an extra time period in which Harry Kane netted the decisive goal for England, a penalty.\n\nIt has been met with some contention, however, after the spot-kick was awarded when Raheem Sterling appeared to go down with minimal contact inside the box.\n\nDrama aside, England enjoyed the glut of attacking options at Wembley, and almost exclusively controlled the extra time period.\n\nThe win sees Gareth Southgate's men set up a grand final showdown with Italy next Monday morning.\n\nIt's the first time in history England has made it to the final of a European championship.\n\nEngland skipper Harry Kane has potentially blasted England into the EURO finals after narrowly putting away a penalty, cleaning up the rebound after Kasper Schmeichel saved his initial attempt.\n\nRaheem Sterling was the man who won the spot-kick with a slaloming run into the box halfway through extra time.\n\nBut it may be met with some contention after Sterling appeared to go down with light contact.\n\n\"Mesmerising, just mesmerising, they could just not see those blurry feet,\" Commentator Peter Drury said.\n\nBut former England great Andy Hinchcliffe was less convinced: \"I'm not too sure there's contact here, I'm not convinced.\"\n\nA shower of boos raining down at Wembley after the referee penalises Harry Kane for going down in the box, perhaps a little too easily.\n\nKane was chasing a stray ball on the edge of the 18-yard before he looked to go down after some light contact.\n\nThe referee didn't want a bar, as he awards Denmark a free-kick. The moment is also checked by VAR and waived away.\n\n\"I'm absolutely surprised he's penalised Kane for that, that is nonsense,\" English football great and commentator Andy Hinchcliffe said.\n\nA perfect response from England after conceding their first goal of the tournament.\n\nThey've come right down the other end, with their dynamic front four peppering the Danish goal until Kasper Schmeichel could not longer hold out.\n\nIn the end, it's Bukayo Saka who puts in a tantalising ball across the face of goal, leaving Raheem Sterling to bowl it in. The goal goes down as an own goal, but you really put that down to Sterling and Saka there.\n\nGame on here!\n\nWHAT A GOAL!\n\n21-year-old Mikkel Damsgaard has just handed England their first conceded goal of the tournament with an absolute pearler of a free-kick.\n\nAfter weathering an early England onslaught, the Danes clawed their way back into the game, and by the 20th minute had swung momentum in their favour.\n\nSome sloppy defence from the Brits handed Denmark back-to-back free kicks, and youngster Damsgaard wouldn't need a second opportunity when he was handed a dead-ball just a few metres out from the box.\n\nIn a stunning piece of skill, the attacker dipped the ball with whip, up over the wall and down hard under the crossbar, to leave Jordan Pickford's net rippling.\n\n\"That is Danish dynamite!\" Commentator Peter Drury said.\n\nCo-host and former football star Andy Hinchcliffe added: \"That is the sweetest of free kicks, he's picked up an absolute beauty,\""
