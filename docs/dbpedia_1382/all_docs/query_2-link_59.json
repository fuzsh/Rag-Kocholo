        "text": "Valencia have beaten Everton to the signing of Celta Vigo star Daniel Wass, according to reports.\n\nThe Toffees had been tracking the 29-year-old this summer as Marco Silva looks to improve the squad he's inherited at Goodison Park.\n\nBut, according to El Desmarque, the Denmark international will not join Everton, as he is set to sign for Valencia this week.\n\nThe LaLiga club will cough up around Â£5m for Wass, and he will put pen to paper on a four-year contract at the Mestella.\n\nRight winger Wass has been with Celta since 2015, and he entered the final year of his contract at the start of July.\n\nWass was unwilling to extend his existing deal and, as a result, Celta have decided to cash in on him now."
