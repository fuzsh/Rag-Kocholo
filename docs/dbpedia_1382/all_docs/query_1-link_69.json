        "text": "A special day it was, because Simon Kjær met Her Majesty Queen Margrethe from Denmark. The queen visited the National Team in Helsingør, Denmark. And that's not all, we've got a bathrobe scene and a pingpong match that we need to zoom in on.\n\nPreviously on 'Simon Kjær and the Danish Squad'\n\nWe've seen Simon Kjær being reunited with the Danish national team. Furthermore, Kasper Hjulmand explained that Simon Kjær chose training over a holiday. And we've seen the great workout video with Simon Kjær. Let's continue with today's royal adventures.\n\nSimon Kjær and the visit from the queen\n\nQueen Margrethe surprised the national team with a visit. First she received a special gift, a jersey with her nickname 'Daisy'. \"Thank you so much for the visit. We have a gift for you. So perhaps at the next New Year's speech?\", said manager Kasper Hjulmand, turning a smile on everyone's faces. Then they went outside for a picture all together. Look at Simon Kjær and Kasper Schmeichel standing next to Her Majesty the Queen.\n\nAnd in this video we even get a closer look at the royal event with the Danish squad.\n\nSimon Kjær bathrobe scenes"
