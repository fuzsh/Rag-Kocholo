        "text": "Manchester United midfielder Christian Eriksen has been named in Denmark's squad for the Fifa World Cup in Qatar.\n\nEriksen, 30, collapsed during their Euro 2020 opening game against Finland last year and had life-saving treatment on the pitch.\n\nThey take on Tunisia on 22 November.\n\nFollowing Eriksen's cardiac arrest in Copenhagen the former Tottenham man had an implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD) device - a type of pacemaker - fitted.\n\nIn January, he said it was \"a goal, a dream\" to play for his country again in front of their home crowd at Parken Stadium and at this year's World Cup.\n\nEriksen joined Brentford on a six-month deal at the start of the year after agreeing to end his contract with Inter Milan prematurely as players with an ICD cannot play in Serie A.\n\nHe made his international return in March and scored two minutes after coming on for Denmark in a friendly defeat by the Netherlands, before completing a move to United in the summer on a free transfer.\n\nOther top-flight players given a place in the squad include Spurs midfielder Pierre-Emile Hojbjerg, Leeds United defender Rasmus Kristensen and Eriksen's ex-Brentford team-mate Mathias Jensen.\n\nAfter facing Tunisia in their opening Group D game, Denmark will play defending champions France on 26 November and Australia on 30 November."
