The Argentina international is set to have some competition for his place once Juve complete the €75 million signing of Dusan Vlahovic from Fiorentina in the coming days.\n\nInter Milan are also keen on Dybala, with former Juventus director Beppe Marotta now at the club, and would be able to offer him the chance to continue his career in Serie A.\n\nHowever, Manchester City are now interested as well. The club are close to sealing an €18m deal for 21-year-old River Plate forward Julian Alvarez, sources have told ESPN, but Dybala would offer a more immediate option.\n\n- Stream ESPN FC Daily on ESPN+ (U.S. only)\n\n- Don't have ESPN?

Manager Steven Gerrard worked with the 26-year-old Finland international midfielder in Glasgow, and Kamara's importance to the Scottish club hasn't waned since the coach left for Villa, starting all but two of Rangers' league games this season as they hold a four-point advantage over Celtic atop the table.\n\n19.12 GMT: ESPN's Taylor Twellman reports that the New England Revolution and Arsenal have agreed a deal that will see United States goalkeeper Matt Turner move to north London this summer. The 27-year-old won MLS' Goalkeeper of the Year award in 2021 and earned all 13 of his international appearances in the same year, but is now seemingly set to become understudy to the Gunners' 23-year-old £30m summer signing Aaron Ramsdale. Read the full story.\n\n18.56 GMT: Southampton are keen to land Tino Anjorin on a permanent move from Chelsea, according to Football London.\n\nThe 20-year-old forward has spent the first half of the campaign on loan with Lokomotiv Moscow, where he was recruited by then-sports-and-development-manager Ralf Rangnick, though it is reported that Thomas Tuchel's side have received offers from top clubs in the Championship over a potential second loan spell. The Saints are hopeful that they can persuade Chelsea to allow him to make the switch to St. Mary's, where fellow Blues youth striker Armando Broja has thrived, with hopes of completing a deal before the transfer window closes.\n\n18.40 GMT: It's a busy day at Lyon, who've followed up the pending loan signing of Portland Thorns midfielder Lindsey Horan by closing in on a deal to send forward Signe Bruun to Manchester United, according to the Telegraph's Tom Garry. The 23-year-old Denmark international has spent the past three-plus seasons in France, primarily with Paris Saint-Germain prior to joining OL last year.\n\n18.23 GMT: Fabrizio Romano reports that an agreement has been reached between Wolverhampton Wanderers and Barcelona over a deal regarding Adama Traore.\n\nThe Blaugrana were reported to be in negotiations with the Premier League club earlier on Thursday, but it now looks as though a swift progression of talks will see the 26-year-old winger join on an initial loan that includes the option to make the move permanent for a transfer fee of €30m. Traore is expected to undergo a medical and sign his contract on Friday.\n\n17.50 GMT: The Philadelphia Union have announced a Designated Player deal of their own on Thursday, with Mikael Uhre arriving from Danish side Brondby IF.

He has only played three times in the Premier League, all last season, but has two goals in two games for United's U23 side in the Premier League 2.\n\n\"I am delighted to join Rangers until the end of the season,\" Amad told the Rangers website. \"It is fantastic for me at this stage of my career to have the opportunity to come to such a big club that is challenging on a number of fronts and will give me some excellent opportunities to test myself in many environments.\"\n\n16.00 GMT: Manchester City have announced the signing of Norway international midfielder Julie Blakstad on a two-and-a-half-year deal.\n\nBlakstad, 20, scored 17 goals in 35 appearances for Rosenborg since joining them in 2020.\n\n\"It's amazing to be a Manchester City player and I can't wait to get started,\" she said. \"Everybody has been amazing so far, and I'm so excited to meet my teammates.

She leaves the Thorns after six seasons where she won an NWSL Championship, two NWSL Shields and an NWSL Challenge Cup. The deal was first reported by The Athletic.\n\nHoran started her career in France, skipping college and going pro straight out of high school with PSG from 2012 to 2016. She then joined the Thorns and was named MVP of the NWSL for the 2018 season.\n\n14.45 GMT: AC Milan have signed Marko Lazetic from Red Star Belgrade.\n\nLazetic, 18, is a replacement for Pietro Pellegri who moved to Monaco on loan over the summer but has now ended that spell to join Torino on loan, with an option to sign permanently for €6m.\n\nThe Serbian striker came through the Red Star Belgrade youth ranks before making his first-team debut in November 2020 and has signed a contract at Milan until 2026.\n\n14.40 GMT: The Athletic has an interesting interview with Newcastle full-back Kieran Trippier.\n\nTrippier, 31 moved to Newcastle earlier this month for €15m from LaLiga champions Atletico Madrid.\n\n\"I wanted to come back to the north, and up north there was only Newcastle interested,\" he said. \"But I know the manager [Eddie Howe] and I've worked with him before [at Burnley] and I had good chats with him about the project and what could happen. I thought that maybe I could tempt other players to come here, too, that if I've joined Newcastle maybe it shows we can get out of it. It's going to be difficult, but I'm up for it. It's perfect timing for me and my family.\"\n\nTrippier also mentioned some other interest over the summer, with reports than Manchester United had not wanted to pay his release clause of €40m.\n\n\"After the Euros, there was really strong interest,\" he said. \"I've got to be careful what I say because I don't want to get into trouble, but yeah, there was interest. We had conversations, but Atletico Madrid just wanted my release clause and it was a lot of money for a 30-year-old, so I understand why Man United didn't do that. There were other clubs interested... Anyway, it's gone now, so it doesn't bother me.\"\n\n14.14 GMT: Ralf Rangnick is open to as many as four first team players leaving Manchester United in January because of the emergence of Anthony Elanga, sources have told ESPN's Rob Dawson.\n\nAnthony Martial has already departed to Sevilla on loan until the end of the season and Rangnick is relaxed about the prospect of also losing Jesse Lingard, Donny van de Beek and Amad Diallo before Monday's transfer deadline.\n\nNewcastle remain interested in Lingard while Van de Beek has been offered to a number of clubs including Crystal Palace.\n\nTalks are ongoing with Palace about a loan for Van de Beek but there is also interest from clubs in Spain and Italy. United are keen to receive a loan fee before letting the Dutchman leave and will ask that his wages are covered as part of any deal.\n\n13.55 GMT: Does Jesse Lingard deserve more of a chance at Man United?\n\n13.38 GMT: Corriere dello Sport claims that Roma have renewed their interest in Arsenal midfielder Granit Xhaka.\n\nXhaka, 29, is deemed surplus to requirements at the Emirates after a slip in form and popularity with the fans.\n\nNow the Gunners are keen to sign Wolves' Ruben Neves as his replacement, Roma are keen on a reigniting a deal for the Switzerland international.\n\n12.35 GMT: Real Madrid are tracking Monaco's Aurelien Tchouameni and Ajax's Ryan Gravenberch, sources have told ESPN's Rodri Faez and Alex Kirkland, with the France international the leading candidate to refresh the team's veteran midfield.\n\nTchouameni, 22, has become one of Europe's most sought-after midfield prospects since becoming a first team regular at Monaco last season. He has made 21 appearances in Ligue 1 this campaign and has seven caps for France since making his full international debut last September.\n\nThe highly-rated Gravenberch, 19, is also already a full international with the Netherlands, featuring regularly during World Cup qualifying and appearing at last year's European Championships. He is due to be out of contract at Ajax in 2023 and is yet to agree to an extension.\n\nSources told ESPN that while Real Madrid are monitoring a number of young prospects, the pursuit of Tchouameni is \"more serious.\" He is viewed as a suitable alternative to, and eventual replacement for, Casemiro in defensive midfield.\n\n12.22 GMT: Arsenal's talks with Juventus over taking midfielder Arthur Melo on loan have broken down, says The Athletic.\n\nArthur, 25, is keen to move on and Arsenal need to bolster their midfield before the January window shuts on Monday.\n\nHowever, the report claims Juve wanted the Brazil international to leave for an 18-month loan spell, while Arsenal only wanted him until the end of this season. As a result, the two clubs haven't been able to come to an agreement.\n\n12.00 GMT: ICYMI - Megan Rapinoe and Rose Lavelle are back with OL Reign.\n\nThe National Women's Soccer League club re-signed Rapinoe to a one-year deal while Lavelle's new deal is for two. Terms were not released.\n\nRapinoe and Lavelle were on the U.S. team that won the World Cup in 2019. Both spent time away from the Reign last season because of the Tokyo Olympics.\n\nRapinoe has been with the Reign since the team's first season in 2013. She holds the club record for career goals with 40. Last season she appeared in 12 matches, with six goals and three assists.\n\nLavelle, a midfielder, played in 12 matches for the Reign last season after signing with the team in May. She had a goal and an assist.\n\n11.17 GMT: The Independent claims Newcastle and Watford are both keen to sign Liverpool defender Nat Phillips.\n\nPhillips, 24, has slipped down the pecking order at Anfield now the club's injury crisis is over. However, Liverpool have reportedly rejected a loan offer from Newcastle with an option to sign him permanently, as well as a £7m outright offer from Watford.\n\n10.36 GMT: Barcelona coach Xavi Hernandez still wants three more signings before the transfer window closes, according to Mundo Deportivo.\n\nBarca have already added to Dani Alves and Ferran Torres to their squad this month but Xavi wants futher reinforcements to boost his side's chances of making the top four. Xavi hopes to bring in a left-back and another two forwards, with Ajax's Nicolas Tagliafico, Juventus' Alvaro Morata and Wolverhampton Wanderers' Adama Traore all targets.\n\nAny signings are likely to depend on Ousmane Dembele's situation. The club have told him to renew his contract, which expires in the summer, or leave this month. Both options would enable the club to create room within their league-imposed spending cap to register new players. However, if the Frenchman decides to run his contract down, arrivals this week will prove difficult.\n\nESPN revealed in December that Xavi wanted Morata as Barca look to add a No. 9 to their squad following Sergio Aguero's retirement. Meanwhile, winger Traore has emerged as an option due to the uncertainty over Dembele's future and an injury to Ansu Fati, with Tagliafico targeted to create competition for Jordi Alba at left-back.\n\n09.57 GMT: Erling Haaland has said it is time to \"move on\" from comments he made earlier this month about Borussia Dortmund pressuring him to made a decision over his future.\n\nHaaland, 21, is expected to leave Dortmund at the end of the season, with top clubs in the Premier League as well as Barcelona, Real Madrid, Bayern Munich and Paris Saint-Germain interested in his signing, according to ESPN sources.\n\n\"I don't really want to say too much about it, but I felt it was time for me to say something.\" Haaland said, in a interview with selected Bundesliga rights holders about why he felt he needed to publicly address the situation.\n\n\"A lot of others were speaking -- so that was it. Now, I don't want to say too much. I said what I said, and now we move on.\"\n\n09.40 GMT: Palmeiras are considering slapping a €100m release clause on 15-year-old sensation Endrick, according to the Brazilian publication Lance, amid interest from Real Madrid, Barcelona and a host of other top European clubs.\n\nEndrick -- who has shone in recent months at U-17 and U-20 level, with clips of his goals going viral -- is still too young to sign a professional contract, however, and Palmeiras would only be able to reach such an agreement when he turns 16 next July.\n\nMarca reports that, with Real Madrid leading the race to sign him, an offer of €30m-€40m now would be necessary to put a deal in place for an obligatory purchase in two-and-a-half years time, when Endrick is able to leave Brazil at 18.\n\n09.18 GMT: Jesse Lingard is growing increasingly unhappy at his treatment by Manchester United with talks over a possible loan move to Newcastle stalled and on the brink of collapse, sources have told ESPN's Rob Dawson.\n\nLingard, who will be out of contract in the summer, wants to move to St James' Park until the end of the season. He remains disappointed United have refused to enter negotiations with either Tottenham or West Ham this month because they are seen as rivals for a place in the top four.\n\nSources have told ESPN United are asking Newcastle to cover Lingard's wages, pay a £2.5m loan fee and another £12m if they avoid relegation. The overall package would end up costing Newcastle more than £15m.\n\nThere is concern in Lingard's camp that Newcastle could soon call time on their pursuit and turn their attention to Tottenham midfielder Dele Alli.\n\nSources have told ESPN that United have already turned down an offer from Newcastle for Lingard which included a £6m loan fee despite agreeing to loan Anthony Martial to Sevilla for free.\n\nThere is a suspicion among Lingard's representatives that he is being treated differently because he has so far refused to sign a new contract and will be able to leave Old Trafford for nothing on June 30.\n\n08.42 GMT: Valencia have accepted Atletico Madrid's latest offer for Daniel Wass, according to multiple reports in Spain, with the move close to being made official.\n\nBoth Marca and AS agree that a deal has been struck for a fee of around €3m, with Marca putting the figure at €2.7m plus variables.\n\nWass, 32 -- a versatile player who is nominally a midfielder but has frequently played for Valencia at full-back -- is available on the cheap with his contract at Mestalla expiring this summer.\n\nAtletico have been keen to strengthen at full-back after the sale of Kieran Trippier to Newcastle, and are also reportedly close to signing Reinildo Mandava from Lille.\n\nValencia, meanwhile, are working against the clock to sign Ilaix Moriba as a replacement for Wass, according to COPE radio,\n\nNegotiations are at an advanced stage and the 19-year-old, recently competed at the Africa Cup of Nations with Guinea, could return to Spain six months after joining Leipzig from Barcelona.\n\nValencia have approached Leipzig to get Moriba on loan for the remainder of the season. Moriba has made just six appearances in all competitions for Leipzig since his €16m transfer from Barca.\n\n08.00 GMT: Tottenham Hotspur are expected to make an improved offer for FC Porto winger Luis Diaz after having an opening bid of €45m plus add-ons rejected, sources have told ESPN's James Olley.\n\nPorto have a strong negotiating position based on the presence of an €80m ($90.23m) release clause in the 25-year-old's contract but there is some confidence at Spurs that a deal can be done below that figure.\n\nTottenham are planning to increase their bid but the clubs remain some way apart in their valuations as negotiations continue, forming one aspect of what promises to be a busy few days at Spurs.\n\nAntonio Conte has stressed the urgency for reinforcements this month rather than waiting until the summer and has identified Diaz, a Colombia international with 16 goals from 26 games across all competitions this season, as a key part of his rebuild.\n\nPAPER GOSSIP (by Nick Judd)\n\n- Southampton are so keen to keep forward Armando Broja that they're prepared to smash their transfer record to lure him away from Chelsea on a permanent basis. TEAMtalk believes that Broja, who has scored five goals in 18 Premier League games this season during his loan spell on the south coast, has impressed the Saints coaching staff so much that they're willing to part with £25m, more than they paid Liverpool for Danny Ings, to get him. Chelsea boss Thomas Tuchel has a number of attacking options at Chelsea and could be willing to let Broja leave.\n\n- PSV Eindhoven winger Cody Gakpo ignored admiring glances from Marseille last summer to stay in the Netherlands and his decision looks to have paid off, with Arsenal, Liverpool and Manchester City now in pursuit of the 22-year-old, according to Footmercato. The left-footed attacking player had previously been monitored by Bayern Munich, but the Germans are said to have cooled their interest. Arsenal would appear to be the keenest club, as they look to replace Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang, but they would struggle to match the lure of Liverpool or Manchester City.\n\n- Talented Major League Soccer goalkeeper Gabriel Slonina is attracting interest from the Premier League and could be on the verge of €10m move from the Chicago Fire, according to Fabrizio Romano. Last year, Slonina became the youngest goalkeeper to start an MLS league game, and his subsequent clean sheet was also a record. Yet to make his full debut for the United States, Slonina has been compared to Gianluigi Buffon, and the 17-year-old has enjoyed a remarkable rise. It hasn't gone unnoticed. As well as two unnamed Premier League sides, Slonina is also said to be attracting interest from the Bundesliga, Serie A and Atletico Madrid in Spain.\n\n- Following reports that Chelsea were monitoring Niklas Sule, now it appears that Newcastle United have joined the race too. On Wednesday, Bayern CEO Oliver Kahn confirmed that the German will leave the club in the summer. That's according to TEAMtalk, which suggests that Sule won't leave until the summer when he'll be a free agent. However, Chelsea and Newcastle are keen to land the centre-back before the end of the January transfer window, even if it means parting with £32m.\n\n- Manchester City are close to signing Hungarian wonderkid Zalan Vancsa from MTK Budapest. The Telegraph reports that the 17-year-old winger will stay in Hungary until the end of the season before joining up with his new City teammates in the summer. Vancsa is set to undergo a medical this week. Bayern Munich, AC Milan and Sevilla were all said to be monitoring the rising star, but City have acted quickly to beat the opposition to his signature.\n\n- Victor Osimhen is a wanted man, and though he appears happy to stay at Napoli until the summer, he's been identified by Arsenal and Newcastle as a top target, according to Gazzetta dello Sport. Arsenal's interest appears to rest on whether or not they can unload the aforementioned Aubameyang, who's future is clearly destined to be away from north London. Barcelona are interested in the Gabon striker, and if that deal happens the Gunners could move in for Osimhen. The 23-year-old boasts a goal roughly every two games for the Italian side and his record at previous side Lille was equally as impressive."
