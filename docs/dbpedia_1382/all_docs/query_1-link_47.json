        "text": "Denmark will be appearing at the World Cup for the sixth time in their history.\n\nThey made their debut in the 1986 edition held in Mexico and remarkably progressed to the knockouts, winning all three group-stage games, including a 2-0 victory over the mighty West Germans.\n\nHowever, their best performance came in the 1998 edition, when they reached the quarter-finals. In the last eight, they were edged out by Brazil following a hotly contested fixture that ended 3-2.\n\nCan the Danes do even better in Qatar?\n\nThey have been drawn in Group D along with defending champions France, Australia, and Tunisia.\n\nApart from the fixture against France, Denmark will be the favourites against the other two teams and will fancy their chances of reaching the knockouts.\n\nLet's take a look at the 26 players that Kasper Hjulmand has chosen to represent the country in Qatar, with five more set to be added before the deadline."
