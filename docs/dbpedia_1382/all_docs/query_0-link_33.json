        "text": "Well, what a night that was! Forget the history, forget our failings in the past, just savour this moment of the here and now. England are through to the final of Euro 2020, how good does that sound? On a night of huge drama and tension, England prevailed and, eventually, deserved to go through to meet Italy in the final.\n\nIt had been a bright start by the Three Lions, but Denmark soon showed that they were not just here to make up the numbers. They battled and fought for every ball and after just one minute I wrote that it was one foul each! Luke Shaw and Raheem Sterling tried to work something down the left, and then on six minutes the England fans held their breath as a tantalising cross came in from Harry Kane on the right. It was a superb pass, but unfortunately Sterling just couldn’t quite reach it and the ball went out for a goal-kick.\n\nIn the ninth minute Mikkel Damsgaard broke away, but, not for the last time in the match, Kyle Walker’s brilliant pace caught him and shepherded the ball safely back to Jordan Pickford. At the other end, good work by Mason Mount and Bukayo Saka ended with some desperate defending by the Danes to clear the ball away from danger. Four minutes later and Kasper Schmeichel was called into action for the first time as Sterling cut inside to fire in a low shot which the goalkeeper comfortably saved. A minute later Kane shot over from another attack. England had settled well. Denmark were battling for everything though, and they were the next to attack as Pierre-Emile Hojbjerg shot straight at Pickford, who also had a comfortable save. But Pickford’s poor clearance was then intercepted, and the goalkeeper was lucky to get away with just a corner conceded. Careless by Pickford. To be fair he then made a positive punch to clear the corner. Hojbjerg, then went down rather easily under challenge from Declan Rice, and won a free-kick that came to nothing.\n\nBoth sides were pressing hard, and it was largely a stalemate for the first 20 minutes. Kane was robbed of the ball to enable a shot by Damsgaard to fly wide of goal and then on 28 minutes, Mount was penalised for a foul. This was blocked but in the melee the referee pulled up Shaw for holding, which was a bit strange as everyone was holding everyone else at this stage. The free-kick was quite a long way out, but Damsgaard hit a peach of a shot which went over the jumping wall, towards the top corner, and dipped viciously under the bar with Pickford, getting fingers to it but unable to keep it out. It stunned the crowd in the stadium, and the millions at home. The immediate thought at the time was, \"Here we go again!\". But this England team are made of sterner stuff than us supporters, and they knuckled down to the job in hand after their first setback of the tournament. It has to be said that Denmark deserved their goal, as they had just edged it to that point. Pickford hit another poor clearance, and the keeper needs to regain his calm authority of the early games in the Euros. However, England cleared the ball and Sterling broke down the left to put in a dangerous cross that the Danish defence only just dealt with. On 38 minutes, it was so nearly 1-1, as Kane broke down the right and put a splendid ball into the middle. Sterling met it, and we all shouted \"Goal\", except that Schmeichel blocked the ball with his ample body for a good save. Sterling would have put that away nine times out of ten, but this was the tenth, sadly. No need to worry though, because on 39 minutes, just a minute later, Sterling was in there again. This time Kane’s wonderful through pass sent Saka away, and his clever run on the right ended with a dangerous low cross aimed at Sterling. However, as the Manchester City striker challenged, defender Simon Kjaer beat him to it to crash the ball into the top of the net for an own goal. If it was any consolation to the Dane, if the defender had missed it, Sterling would have scored. The England players were all working really hard, and one terrific piece of defending by Rice highlighted the effort and determination that was being put in. The goal certainly gave the England team, and fans, the lift they needed, and the half drew to a close with England looking more assured again. Overall, 1-1 was about right, so lots of work still to do. Three minutes after the break, Saka was fouled out on the right, and from the free-kick, Harry Maguire jumped well, only to be penalised. The Manchester United player was fuming after the referee harshly gave him a yellow card. Kjaer didn’t help matters by feigning injury, clutching his face, as you do! A good spell from the Danes as Kasper Dolberg, forces Pickford into a good save. However, the whistle had gone for an offside decision. But the Denmark players were passing the ball around well, and Kalvin Phillips, Rice and Mount were having to work hard to stem the tide. In the 55th minute the pressure was relieved when Kane won a free-kick, and from it Maguire so nearly gave England the lead. A terrific header was goalbound until that man Schmeichel dived full length to push the ball away. The referee irked the crowd with some of his decisions against England, whereas Joakim Maehle had committed several fouls and never once received the yellow card that he deserved. Just before the hour mark Pickford saved another effort from Dolberg, whilst Mount went close at the other end as Schmeichel again saved well. The Danish goalkeeper was having a fine game. Time for some substitutes as Denmark brought on three, whilst Gareth Southgate replaced Saka with Jack Grealish. The Aston Villa player’s first contribution was, naturally, to be fouled, but he also showed an immediate willingness to push England forward. Mount’s cross was touched over the bar by Schmeichel and then Sterling was crowded out by the strong Danish defence. In another attack, Kane was brought down for a stonewall penalty, but alas, the referee blew for a foul by Kane just before. It was certainly obvious that the penalty challenge was far worse than Kane’s foul. In my opinion the ref had in the main been harsh on England, but then I’m biased!! With 15 minutes to go it all became very tense. Phillips saw a shot deflected for a corner, which was given as a goalkick (see what I mean), and then Stones headed wide after Mount had been brought down. It was hard to watch as everyone knew that one mistake would cost them. Who would make it? England pushed for a winner as Phillips shot over, Maguire headed into Schmeichel’s arms, and a late attack was only just blocked by desperate defending. It was probably written in the stars that there would be extra-time, and so it was.\n\nFour minutes into the extra period, Kane, who had a fine match, forced another diving save from the goalkeeper, who pushed the ball away, luckily to find no England player following up. Jordan Henderson and Phil Foden came on for the magnificent Rice and Mount, as England brought on fresh legs. Schmeichel saved well from Foden before Sterling shot over from a good position. England were now on top as the Danes flagged. Could they force a winner, yes, was the answer to that. With 12 minutes of the extra period gone, Sterling attacked on the right bye-line cutting in dangerously. There was a definite trip, and this time the referee gave the penalty. Some saw it as soft, others, including Sterling, saw it as definite. My own thought was that if that challenge had happened on any other part of the pitch, then a free-kick would have been given.\n\nI wonder if Schmeichel’s outstanding display in goal influenced Kane, as he stood to take the spot-kick. The crowd were hushed, and the tension unbearable. Up stepped Kane to hit one of the worst penalties he has probably taken, down to Schmeichel’s left. The keeper saved it, but, thank the Lord, it bounced back to Kane who joyfully put it into the back of the net. The only word for it was PHEW!!!! At the start of the second period of extra-time, a strange thing happened in what was such a big game, as Mathias Jensen had to go off injured, but Denmark had used all their substitutes, so they were down to ten men for the remainder of the match. Meanwhile, Kieran Trippier replaced Grealish in a surprise move by Southgate. He wanted to switch to a back five, to hold on to the lead, but for a spell, England sat very deep, inviting the Danes onto them, a dangerous ploy.However, the second period passed off without undue concerns and as it progressed, England played some of their best possession football of the tournament. At the very end Sterling came so close to settling the tie once and for all, but man-of-the-match Schmeichel again saved the day. And with that the final whistle blew on an incredible football match.England had done it, they were in the final. Outstanding displays from Sterling, Kane, Maguire, Stones (who never put a foot wrong), Rice, Phillips and especially Walker, who I rated as England’s own man-of-the-match.But well done to the whole squad for a superb victory.\n\nNow, bring on the Italians."
