        "text": "Denmark will aim to emulate their emotionally charged run to the Euro 2020 semifinals in Qatar, minus the drama of Christian Eriksen's horrifying collapse.\n\nThe Manchester United midfielder has made a startling recovery following his cardiac arrest on the pitch during that tournament, that forced him to step away from the game.\n\nHe has, thankfully, returned and has become a fixture in the Premier League once again. Eriksen will function as the Danes' creative engine at his fifth major tournament.\n\nA dominant qualifying campaign and two recent victories over defending world champions France demonstrates the potential of Kasper Hjulmand's side, bringing a core of established talent in the mature end of their primes to the Middle East.\n\nIf they pick up momentum in the group stages, another brave Danish charge into the latter rounds could be on the cards.\n\nMORE: Breaking down Denmark's Group D opponents Australia, Tunisia and France\n\nFinal 26-man Denmark World Cup squad\n\nHjulmand had until Friday, October 21 to submit an official preliminary list of 35-55 players to FIFA, from which he then had to select a final 26-man roster for Qatar by Monday, November 14.\n\nDenmark revealed 21 of their 26 players on November 7 with the final five added before the cutoff.\n\nAmong those initially named, Premier League stars Christian Eriksen, Pierre-Emile Hojbjerg and Mikkel Damsgaard all made the cut.\n\nFormer Leicester City goalkeeper Kasper Schmeichel was also unsurprisingly named.\n\nHjulmand claimed 12 players were vying for the final five places in his side that saw the likes of Christian Norgaard and Yussuf Poulsen given a call-up.\n\nHere are the 26 players confirmed to be in Denmark's final World Cup squad:\n\nPosition No. Player Club Age Caps GK 1 Kasper Schmeichel Nice (FRA) 35 86 GK 16 Oliver Christensen Hertha Berlin (GER) 23 1 GK 22 Frederik Ronnow Union Berlin (GER) 30 8 DEF 6 Andreas Christensen Barcelona (SPA) 26 58 DEF 4 Simon Kjaer AC Milan (ITA) 33 121 DEF 17 Jens Stryger Larsen Trabzonspor (TUR) 31 49 DEEF 2 Joachim Andersen Crystal Palace (ENG) 26 19 DEF 3 Victor Nelsson Galatasaray (TUR) 24 7 DEF 13 Rasmus Kristensen Leeds United (ENG) 25 10 DEF 26 Alexander Bah Benfica (POR) 24 4 DEF 5 Joakim Maehle Atalanta (ITA) 25 31 DEF 18 Daniel Wass Brondby (DEN) 33 44 MID 8 Thomas Delaney Sevilla (SPA) 26 20 MID 10 Christian Eriksen Manchester United (ENG) 30 117 MID 23 Pierre-Emile Hojbjerg Tottenham (ENG) 27 60 MID 14 Mikkel Damsgaard Brentford (ENG) 22 18 MID 15 Christian Norgaard Brentford (ENG) 28 17 MID 7 Mathias Jensen Brentford (ENG) 26 20 MID 25 Jesper Lindstrom Eintracht Frankfurt (GER) 22 6 MID 24 Robert Skov Hoffenheim (GER) 26 11 MID 11 Andreas Skov Olsen Club Brugge (BEL) 22 23 FWD 19 Jonas Wind Wolfsburg (GER) 23 15 FWD 21 Andreas Cornelius Copenhagen (DEN) 29 41 FWD 9 Martin Braithwaite Espanyol (SPA) 31 62 FWD 20 Yussuf Poulsen RB Leipzig (GER) 28 68 FWD 12 Kasper Dolberg Sevilla (SPA) 25 37\n\nWORLD CUP 2022 SELECTED SQUADS:\n\nAustralia | Argentina | Belgium | Brazil | Cameroon\n\nCanada | Costa Rica | Croatia | Denmark | England\n\nFrance | Germany | Ghana | Iran | Japan | Mexico\n\nNetherlands | Poland | Portugal | Qatar | Senegal\n\nSerbia | Spain | Switzerland | Uruguay | USA | Wales\n\nDenmark best player, strengths & weaknesses\n\nA narrow 2-1 extra-time defeat to England in the Euro 2020 semifinal was all that separated Denmark from an against-all-odds bid for the title last year.\n\nA team with a sturdy back line who are comfortable in possession and capable of launching thunderbolt counter-attacks at any moment, they should be even better equipped in Qatar.\n\nThe added impetus of a fit and healthy Eriksen could make a significant difference this year. All the leading contenders will be wary of Denmark.\n\nStars\n\nDenmark's battle hardened, close-knit core of talent operating down the spine of their team will be the backbone of any success at this World Cup.\n\nKasper Schmeichel, Simon Kjaer, Eriksen and Martin Brathwaite are all into their early 30s, offering tournament know-how and leadership to a young and exciting attack.\n\nKasper Dolberg is expected to be Denmark's key goal threat, but a steady start to his season with Sevilla could see Brathwaite get the nod.\n\nStrengths\n\nThe Danish backline conceded just three goals throughout their World Cup qualification campaign. Andreas Christensen and Kjaer were heroes of their Euro 2020 campaign, while Jannick Verstergaard and Joachim Andersen are also excellent options.\n\nIt's a wonderfully balanced team, with 22-year-old wingers Mikkel Damsgaard and Andreas Olsen dangerous elements in attack, while the likes of Thomas Delaney and Pierre-Emile Hojbjerg steady the ship in midfield.\n\nWeaknesses\n\nHjulmand's team are full of spirit, have a well-oiled system and possess plenty of talent. Regardless, they'll still be considered underdogs against the likes of Brazil, England, Germany and Portugal.\n\nDo they have the resilience to withstand Messi or Ronaldo? Can they overpower Thiago Silva or Antonio Rudiger?\n\nDenmark World Cup group\n\nDenmark were drawn in Group D for the tournament in Qatar alongside Australia, France and Tunisia.\n\nDenmark Group D fixtures and match schedule\n\nDate Match Time (ET) Stadium Tue, Nov. 22 Denmark 0 Tunisia 0 8 a.m. Education City Stadium Sat, Nov. 26 France 2 Denmark 1 11 a.m. Stadium 974 Wed, Nov. 30 Australia vs. Denmark 10 a.m. Al Janoub Stadium\n\nCan Denmark replace players on World Cup roster?\n\nOnce the final 26-man roster is official, participating teams at the World Cup can only make changes before the first game of the tournament, and only in the case of extraordinary circumstances.\n\nAccording to the official tournament rules, \"a player listed on the final list may only be replaced in the event of serious injury or illness up until 24 hours before the start of his team's first match.\"\n\nThe team in question would need to submit a medical report to FIFA and if the world governing body determines \"the injury or illness is sufficiently serious to prevent the player from taking part in the FIFA World Cup\" then the replacement will be allowed.\n\nThe replacement player must come from the preliminary list of players submitted to FIFA in October."
