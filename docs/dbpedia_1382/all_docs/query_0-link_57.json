        "text": "Scotland welcome Denmark to Hampden Park this evening as Steve Clarke’s side look to end their World Cup qualifying campaign on a high note, having already sealed a place in the play-offs ahead of next winter’s tournament in Qatar.\n\nScotland’s 2-0 victory over Moldova on Friday ensured Clarke’s team will finish in second place in Group F, with tonight’s opponents Denmark guaranteed to win the pool. The Danes have won all nine of their qualifying fixtures, having beaten Scotland 2-0 in Copenhagen back in September – though the scoreline could have been much more lopsided against the Scots. Still, this is no dead-rubber for Scotland, who are now aiming to finish as one of the six best second-placed sides, which would give them a seeding in next March’s play-off games. A result here could significantly boost Scotland’s hopes of achieving a home semi-final draw in those play-offs, so Clarke and his players will be keen for a sharp performance in front of the Hampden Park faithful this evening.\n\nScotland’s presence at Euro 2020 this summer marked their first appearance at a major tournament since the 1998 World Cup, so qualifying for Qatar 2022 would see them play at a world championship for the first time in 24 years.\n\nFollow live updates from Scotland vs Denmark below.\n\nScotland vs Denmark LIVE\n\nScotland have already secured spot in qualifying play-offs\n\nScotland XI: Gordon, O’Donnell, Souttar, Robertson, Tierney, McGinn, McGregor, Adams, Christie, Gilmour, Cooper\n\nDenmark XI: Schmeichel, Vestergaard, Kjaer, Christensen, Kristensen, Wass, Jonsson, Maehle, Skov Olsen, Cornelius, Bruun Larsen\n\n35 mins: Souttar heads home opener for Scotland\n\nScotland 1-0 Denmark\n\n21:24 , Dylan Terry\n\n82 mins: Into the last 10 minutes we go as Denmark’s press for an equaliser appears to have tapered off following a number of changes and breaks in play.\n\nTierney flicks a cross away for a Danish corner. Fatigue setting in. Not long to go.\n\nOther scores\n\n21:23 , Dylan Terry\n\nIn case any Scotland fan at all is interested, here are the other scores for the home nations with 10 minutes remaining:\n\nNorthern Ireland 0-0 Italy\n\nSan Marino 0-10 (TEN) England\n\nScotland 1-0 Denmark\n\n21:21 , Dylan Terry\n\n80 mins: Scotland captain Andy Robertson has gone down here. A concern for the country and for Liverpool.\n\nSUBS! Robertson hobbles off and is replaced by Scott McKenna. Ryan Christie has also gone off for Stuart Armstrong.\n\nScotland 1-0 Denmark\n\n21:20 , Dylan Terry\n\n78 mins: Che Adams has been magnificent at holding the ball up for Scotland tonight and giving them an outlet high up the pitch. But his legs are starting to tire now and he is dropping deeper as a result. The Scottish defenders no longer have that long pass option and are subsequently welcoming pressure.\n\nScotland 1-0 Denmark\n\n21:18 , Dylan Terry\n\n76 mins: Scotland cannot get out of their own half now. It’s going to be a backs to the wall-type job for the final 15 minutes as Denmark continue to stalk their prey.\n\nScotland 1-0 Denmark\n\n21:16 , Dylan Terry\n\n74 mins: It’s neat build-up play in the middle third from Denmark but as soon as Kristensen looks for that killer pass it’s so poor.\n\nSUB! That is Gilmour’s last moments in the game as Kenny McLean comes on in his place.\n\nScotland 1-0 Denmark\n\n21:14 , Dylan Terry\n\n72 mins: Denmark having a lot of the ball now but not doing much with it. Here comes another substitution.\n\nUhre is on for striker Cornelius. The Danish forward has had very little to feed off of tonight.\n\nMeanwhile, Billy Gilmour looks like he has cramp. He is going to continue for the time being.\n\nScotland 1-0 Denmark\n\n21:11 , Dylan Terry\n\n69 mins: McGinn has been absolutely superb tonight. He appears to have won a free-kick on the byline after drifting beyond Kristensen but the ball had already gone out of play.\n\nThe Aston Villa man has been a pest all evening for that Danish back line.\n\nScotland 1-0 Denmark\n\n21:09 , Dylan Terry\n\n67 mins: Midway through the second half and Scotland are on their way to a sensational victory as it stands. The phone lights are out in force from the thousands in attendance - they’re in party mood.\n\nBut it’s heart in mouth stuff for a moment as one, two, three Denmark shots are blocked from inside the box. Souttar then rises highest to head a couple of crosses away before Scotland relieve the pressure by winning a throw.\n\nScotland 1-0 Denmark\n\n21:07 , Dylan Terry\n\nThis has been an excellent battle this evening. McGinn getting the better of it.\n\nScotland 1-0 Denmark\n\n21:06 , Dylan Terry\n\n64 mins: The crowd are on their feet once more as McGinn lobs a delicate ball into the path of Adams. He takes it down and thumps a low drive against the base of the post and then the assistant referee’s flag goes up.\n\nReplays show he was perhaps a shoulder’s width offside.\n\nScotland 1-0 Denmark\n\n21:04 , Dylan Terry\n\n62 mins: NOW THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN SPECIAL.\n\nO’Donnell’s throw-in is chested down by Gilmour and he takes a speculative shot on the bounce. For a moment it looks destined to loop over Schmeichel but in the end the Leicester man is able to pluck it out of the sky.\n\nThe crowd would have lost it had that gone in.\n\nScotland 1-0 Denmark\n\n21:03 , Dylan Terry\n\nDenmark do only have 400,000 more people in their population than Scotland (according to a quick Google). So would this really be that much of an upset? I mean, yes, but an interesting point nevertheless.\n\nScotland 1-0 Denmark\n\n21:01 , Dylan Terry\n\n59 mins: Olsen cuts the ball back and delivers an inswinging ball which Cornelius attacks but Souttar sees him all the way and it harmlessly rolls out for a goal kick.\n\nDenmark slowly getting on top although (offside header aside) they are still yet to create anything substantial.\n\nScotland 1-0 Denmark\n\n20:58 , Dylan Terry\n\n57 mins: SUBS! Sisto is on for Larsen and Jonsson has made way for Stage. Double change from Hjulmand as he looks to shake things up.\n\nHe needs to.\n\nScotland 1-0 Denmark\n\n20:56 , Dylan Terry\n\n54 mins: WHAT A SAVE! The flag is up but let’s just appreciate the save from Craig Gordon.\n\nIt’s lofted into the left-hand side of the penalty area and when Larsen heads back across goal Cornelius plants a header towards the near post only for Gordon to tip it away superbly! There was an offside in the build up, but the Scotland number one had no idea.\n\nWonderful stop.\n\nScotland 1-0 Denmark\n\n20:55 , Dylan Terry\n\n53 mins: Bit of space opening up in between the lines of Scotland at the start of this second half. Christensen drifts into a pocket and looks to find Larsen out on the left but he overhits the sweeping pass.\n\nDenmark just enjoying a spell of possession here.\n\nScotland 1-0 Denmark\n\n20:52 , Dylan Terry\n\n51 mins: It’s a carnival atmosphere at Hampden Park right now. If they do win this game, Steve Clarke would become the first Scottish manager to win six games in a row since Alex McLeish.\n\nScotland 1-0 Denmark\n\n20:50 , Dylan Terry\n\n48 mins: Olsen tries to beat Tierney down the right but the Arsenal man is equal to it and it comes back off the Dane for a Scotland goal kick.\n\nBeen that sort of evening for the visitors so far...\n\nScotland 1-0 Denmark\n\n20:48 , Dylan Terry\n\n46 mins: BACK UNDERWAY! Denmark begin the second half. They need to be much, much better if they want to maintain their 100 per cent record in the campaign.\n\nScotland 1-0 Denmark\n\n20:47 , Dylan Terry\n\nSecond half incoming. Can the Scots hang on to the lead? I say hang on, if the first period is anything to go by they may feel like extending their advantage.\n\nScotland 1-0 Denmark\n\n20:42 , Dylan Terry\n\nA moment to remember for John Souttar.\n\nHALF-TIME: Scotland 1-0 Denmark\n\n20:33 , Dylan Terry\n\nThat will do for the first 45 minutes at Hampden Park. What a sensational performance from Scotland!\n\nSteve Clarke side lead courtesy of a close-range header from John Souttar after an excellent nod back across goal from Liam Cooper.\n\nWonderful display so far from the Scots.\n\nScotland 1-0 Denmark\n\n20:32 , Dylan Terry\n\n45 mins: That was a chance for Denmark!\n\nOlsen curls a ball towards the back post and it falls for Wass. The Dane’s effort is heading into the bottom corner but Tierney gets a flick on it to crucially divert it wide.\n\nThe visitors’ best chance of the game.\n\nScotland 1-0 Denmark\n\n20:31 , Dylan Terry\n\n44 mins: England might be 6-0 up against San Marino but it is here where the performance of the night is coming from. Scotland have been utterly irrepressible in this first period.\n\nIt’s just a matter of whether or not they can keep this intensity up.\n\nScotland 1-0 Denmark\n\n20:29 , Dylan Terry\n\nHere it is.\n\nScotland 1-0 Denmark\n\n20:29 , Dylan Terry\n\n42 mins: Denmark probe 40 yards from the Scotland goal but Robertson nicks the ball and the hosts can come away with it.\n\nThe Dane’s haven’t really laid a glove on Scotland over the last 20 minutes or so.\n\nClarke’s men professionally seeing this one out to the break.\n\nScotland 1-0 Denmark\n\n20:27 , Dylan Terry\n\n40 mins: Are Denmark about to lose their first game since the European Championships?\n\nScotland have totally outplayed them for 40 minutes here. One. Way. Traffic.\n\nScotland 1-0 Denmark\n\n20:25 , Dylan Terry\n\n38 mins: Aaaaaand breathe. That was a moment for all of Scotland to saviour.\n\nBut they have to stay alert as soon as play gets back underway. Maehle storms down the left and earns a corner for the away side, their first of the game.\n\nIt comes to nothing though. Scotland are defending absolutely superbly.\n\nGOAL! Scotland 1-0 Denmark (Souttar, 35)\n\n20:22 , Dylan Terry\n\n35 mins: CAN YOU BELIEVE IT?!\n\nScotland’s seventh corner presents an eighth and it’s from that one where the home side find the breakthrough!\n\nMcGinn swings it all the way to the back post and when it’s knocked back into the six-yard box John Souttar is there to flick home from close range!\n\nPandemonium at Hampden!\n\nScotland 0-0 Denmark\n\n20:21 , Dylan Terry\n\n34 mins: Big chance for Scotland! Denmark are pressing up the pitch and caught napping by the Scots.\n\nIt’s two-on-one as Robertson brings it down for Adams. The Saints man looks up and opts to shoot but it’s blocked behind by Kjaer. He should have given it back to Robertson! The Liverpool man was open inside the box. Wrong decision.\n\nIt’s coming though...\n\nScotland 0-0 Denmark\n\n20:20 , Dylan Terry\n\n32 mins: Denmark just taking the sting out of the game a little as they knock it around at the back. Dare I say Schmeichel is already running down the clock in this first half?\n\nIf there is going to be a goal before the break, it is almost certainly going to come from the home team.\n\nScotland 0-0 Denmark\n\n20:17 , Dylan Terry\n\nDenmark coach Hjulmand will know his team are in a dogfight here. They have been largely outplayed for the opening 30 minutes.\n\nScotland 0-0 Denmark\n\n20:16 , Dylan Terry\n\n29 mins: Scotland on the march again! Robertson crosses from the left and it falls to McGinn whose shot is blocked behind for a corner - the hosts fifth already!\n\nIt’s swung in by McGinn and Kjaer has to get back on the goal line to preventing it going straight in at the near post!\n\nThe Danes on the ropes.\n\nScotland 0-0 Denmark\n\n20:15 , Dylan Terry\n\n28 mins: Jannik Vestergaard isn’t known for his distribution and his latest pass showcases why.\n\nThe Leicester defender tries to curl a sweeping ball towards the back post but it’s around 20 yards too deep.\n\nMaybe he was picking out someone he knew in the front row? Benefit of the doubt.\n\nScotland 0-0 Denmark\n\n20:13 , Dylan Terry\n\n26 mins: Few breaks in play here as a couple of cheap free-kicks and offsides are given.\n\nDenmark composing themselves after a strong spell for the hosts.\n\nScotland 0-0 Denmark\n\n20:12 , Dylan Terry\n\nAs an Englishman, I endorse this.\n\nScotland 0-0 Denmark\n\n20:11 , Dylan Terry\n\n23 mins: HUGE CHANCE!\n\nOh, what a move from Scotland. A lovely dinked ball finds Gilmour. He cuts it back for Christie who bundles it into the path of Adams but the Southampton man is denied by the outstretched leg of Schmeichel!\n\nSuperb stop. Great play from the Scots.\n\nScotland 0-0 Denmark\n\n20:09 , Dylan Terry\n\n23 mins: YELLOW! Denmark keeper Schmeichel has gone in the book, the first card of the night.\n\nIt seems it was for descent after he berated the referee, indicating he needs glasses when a goal kick/corner decision did not go his way. Silly boy.\n\nScotland 0-0 Denmark\n\n20:07 , Dylan Terry\n\n21 mins: McGinn swings in the corner which is on top of Schmeichel but headed clear inside the six yard box for another corner.\n\nThis one comes in from Gilmour but the referee has seen an infringement from a Scottish player.\n\nScotland 0-0 Denmark\n\n20:06 , Dylan Terry\n\n20 mins: Christie tries to make something happen as he drives down the right of the penalty area but his cross is headed clear.\n\nAdams then latches onto a loose ball and shrugs off Kjaer to earn his side a corner.\n\nScotland pushing Denmark back after a difficult 10 minutes.\n\nScotland 0-0 Denmark\n\n20:04 , Dylan Terry\n\n17 mins: CLOSE! Chelsea centre-back Andreas Christensen lines one up from 25 yards and let’s fly. It initially looks dangerous but ends up soaring just over the top.\n\nWe know he can hit them. Remember that one in the Euros?\n\nScotland 0-0 Denmark\n\n20:01 , Dylan Terry\n\n14 mins: After a very dominant opening seven or eight minutes, Scotland are now reverting to their defensive shape as Denmark start to ping it around.\n\nIf Steve Clarke’s side are going to get a positive result then they need to be patient because there will be spells without the ball.\n\nMaehle skips away as a bit of room opens up behind Scotland.

Harsh.\n\nRobertson and McGinn starting well down the left, probing that side.\n\nScotland 0-0 Denmark\n\n19:49 , Dylan Terry\n\n3 mins: Hampden Park is absolutely rocking this evening. It’s not hard to work out what they think of this Scotland team. Clarke has created a buoyant mood around the national side.\n\nJohn McGinn wins himself a free-kick in the early exchanges, battling and fighting for the ball with Vestergaard.\n\nScotland 0-0 Denmark\n\n19:47 , Dylan Terry\n\n1 min: KICK OFF!

A quick reminder of the two teams.\n\nScotland vs Denmark\n\n19:40 , Dylan Terry\n\nChe Adams found the back of the net last time out against Moldova.

But they could not have done any more in this qualification campaign. If they win tonight, they will be the only side to finish with maximum points.\n\nScotland vs Denmark\n\n19:21 , Dylan Terry\n\nElsewhere tonight:\n\nSan Marino vs England\n\nNorthern Ireland vs Italy\n\nSwitzerland vs Bulgaria\n\nAustria vs Moldova\n\nIsrael vs Faroe Islands\n\nAlbania vs Andorra\n\nPoland vs Hungary\n\nScotland vs Denmark\n\n19:16 , Dylan Terry\n\nSimply a lovely little moment.\n\nScotland vs Denmark\n\n19:11 , Dylan Terry\n\nScotland have won five World Cup qualifiers in a row, a run that stretches back to their defeat against Denmark at the beginning September.\n\nSince then, they have beaten Moldova twice, Austria, Israel and the Faroe Islands in a superb run of results for Steve Clarke’s men.\n\nScotland vs Denmark\n\n19:06 , Dylan Terry\n\nAlly McCoist in the house at Hampden Park for the game this evening.

Denmark have secured their place in Qatar as the group winners and Scotland have already clinched a play-off place.\n\nBut can the Scots clinch a famous win tonight?\n\nScotland vs Denmark\n\n18:46 , Dylan Terry\n\nScotland are looking to keep their positive form going with another impressive display tonight. Will they prevent Denmark from making it 10 wins out of 10 in this World Cup qualifying campaign?\n\nScotland vs Denmark\n\n18:41 , Dylan Terry\n\nDenmark XI: Schmeichel, Vestergaard, Kjaer, Christensen, Kristensen, Wass, Jonsson, Maehle, Skov Olsen, Cornelius, Bruun Larsen.\n\nScotland vs Denmark\n\n18:32 , Alex Pattle\n\nScotland bench: Clark, McLaughlin, Ralston, Porteous, McKenna, Armstrong, Turnbull, Nisbet, Ferguson, Brown, McLean.\n\nScotland vs Denmark\n\n18:31 , Alex Pattle\n\nScotland XI: Gordon, O’Donnell, Souttar, Robertson, Tierney, McGinn, McGregor, Adams, Christie, Gilmour, Cooper.\n\nScotland vs Denmark\n\n18:16 , Alex Pattle\n\nScotland welcome Denmark to Hampden Park this evening as Steve Clarke’s side look to end their World Cup qualifying campaign on a high note, having already sealed a place in the play-offs ahead of next winter’s tournament in Qatar.\n\nScotland’s 2-0 victory over Moldova on Friday ensured Clarke’s team will finish in second place in Group F, with tonight’s opponents Denmark guaranteed to win the pool. The Danes have won all nine of their qualifying fixtures, having beaten Scotland 2-0 in Copenhagen back in September – though the scoreline could have been much more lopsided against the Scots. Still, this is no dead-rubber for Scotland, who are now aiming to finish as one of the six best second-placed sides, which would give them a seeding in next March’s play-off games. A result here could significantly boost Scotland’s hopes of achieving a home semi-final draw in those play-offs, so Clarke and his players will be keen for a sharp performance in front of the Hampden Park faithful this evening.\n\nScotland’s presence at Euro 2020 this summer marked their first appearance at a major tournament since the 1998 World Cup, so qualifying for Qatar 2022 would see them play at a world championship for the first time in 24 years."
