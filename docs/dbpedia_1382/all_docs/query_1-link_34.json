        "text": "OWINGS MILLS, Md. — Responding to a question on Monday about the player who was getting the front-line center reps with Tyler Linderbaum sidelined, Baltimore Ravens coach John Harbaugh reiterated that there aren’t any long-term health concerns for his usual starter.\n\n“Tyler is out right now, they’re kind of evaluating him. He had some discomfort, and we’re going to hold him out,” Harbaugh said, not providing any specific information about Linderbaum’s injury, which was initially described as soft tissue damage. “We’re going to be very cautious with Tyler, obviously. There is not anything he needs right now in terms of practice, so we’ll kind of rest him.”\n\nLinderbaum, a Pro Bowl selection last year and one of only two returning starters on the offensive line, may not have played in the preseason even if he was fully healthy. Now, it seems close to a formality that Linderbaum’s first game action will be the Sept. 5 opener against the Kansas City Chiefs.\n\nHarbaugh has now used the words “cautious” and “patient” when describing the team’s approach with the 24-year-old. That could be an indication that his return to the practice field, at least as a full participant, may not be imminent, either.\n\nGO DEEPER\n\nRavens' Tyler Linderbaum is as competitive as they come: 'He just won’t allow himself to fail'\n\nThat’s why it felt notable Monday that the Ravens got a look at two other potential options at the center position. Connor Williams, who has started 77 games over six NFL seasons at either guard or center, was at the team’s facility for a free-agent visit. Williams has most recently been the starting center for the Miami Dolphins, but his 2023 season ended prematurely when he tore his ACL in early December.\n\nWilliams is nearing a return to the field, and the Seattle Seahawks, who brought him in for a visit late last month, are believed to be the front-runners to sign him. The Ravens, though, wanted to get a look at him before he made his decision. That doesn’t necessarily mean there are long-term concerns about Linderbaum, but Harbaugh did acknowledge that the team needs to figure out its backup center, especially if Patrick Mekari, who has started some games at center, begins the season as the starting right tackle.\n\n“It’s an open competition right now, and you have Patrick Mekari in that mix, too, obviously,” Harbaugh said. “I’m confident that we’ve got guys that can do it and do it well, but we are going to want to hone in there in the next period of time.”\n\nIn practice Monday, it was Ben Cleveland’s turn to show what he can do as a center. A natural guard, Cleveland didn’t look out of place snapping footballs to quarterback Lamar Jackson. There was one errant snap. Otherwise, Cleveland was mostly on point.\n\nThe 2021 third-round pick, who hasn’t established himself as a starting guard heading into his fourth NFL season, has been getting some reps at center since the organized team activities in the offseason. Monday, though, represented a chance to work with Jackson, left tackle Ronnie Stanley, starting right tackle candidates Mekari and rookie Roger Rosengarten, and potential starting guards Andrew Vorhees and Daniel Faalele.\n\n“We’re going to work Ben, we’re going to work Vorhees in there (at center),” Harbaugh said. “We’re going to work all of those guys.”\n\nWhether getting a shot at center is good news for Cleveland is another story. On one hand, it could add to his versatility and give him a better chance of sticking on the 53-man roster later this month. The downside for him, though, is if he’s auditioning for the backup center job, it probably doesn’t bode well for his chances to start at right guard. At one point in the offseason, Cleveland was perceived as the favorite to start at right guard after veteran Kevin Zeitler departed in free agency. That has changed, though, as Faalele continues to get a long look inside.\n\nGO DEEPER\n\nWhat are Ravens' potential roster concerns after 2 weeks of training camp?\n\nUp-and-down day for Bateman\n\nJackson’s first deep pass in full-team drills Monday fell incomplete as Rashod Bateman couldn’t get any separation from cornerback Marlon Humphrey and didn’t seem to find the flight of the ball right away. Things got much better from there with the highly scrutinized connection between the quarterback and wide receiver, who struggled to get on the same page for much of last year.\n\nA few plays later, Jackson found Bateman on a crossing route with the wide receiver creating some room against rookie cornerback Nate Wiggins. Bateman made several more receptions after that, thriving in the role of Jackson’s favorite target Monday. When Bateman went up in the corner of the end zone and elevated over defensive backs Jalyn Armour-Davis and Ar’Darius Washington to make a highlight-reel catch, it appeared to be the exclamation point on another strong practice for the fourth-year receiver.\n\nHowever, Bateman didn’t immediately get up after the touchdown, prompting tight end Mark Andrews and cornerback Brandon Stephens to rush over and check on him. When Bateman did get up, he appeared to be holding his ribs/midsection area. Ultimately, he walked to the sideline under his own power and talked to a few members of the athletic training staff before going to lie down on the far field. He then took his jersey and shoulder pads off. The play happened with about 10 minutes left in practice. That Bateman didn’t return — and Harbaugh didn’t have an update — didn’t seem troubling. The issue also didn’t appear to involve Bateman’s legs, so that’s a positive, too.\n\nBut it still was unfortunate for a hard-luck player that instead of the conversation being about his impressive touchdown catch and his productive practice, it was about his health.\n\nOther thoughts, observations\n\n• Jackson added some levity to a long and hot practice. Undrafted rookie quarterback Emory Jones mistakenly threw a backward pass when he tried to pump-fake and the ball flew out of his hands. The play was ruled dead, but Jackson came from the back sideline and quickly scooped the ball off the ground, motioned for running back Chris Collier to head down the sideline and then hit him in stride. The crowd roared its approval. Earlier in practice, Jackson showed his frustration when he punted the ball away after Vorhees was called for a false start. Later, Jackson demonstratively told Andrews and wide receiver Tylan Wallace what he saw — and expected — of them after his passes were incomplete. Jackson and Andrews retreated to a tablet to rewatch the play. More than anything, it was Jackson’s energy that Baltimore was missing when he was sidelined for much of the first week of camp.\n\n• It’s hard to say what was more impressive: Washington’s interception against Josh Johnson in which the defensive back stepped in front of receiver Malik Cunningham and returned the ball for a touchdown, or the back flip he did after getting into the end zone. Washington is one of many Ravens defensive backs who are having a really good camp. He can get grabby at times, like he did in his one-on-one rep against undrafted rookie receiver Dayton Wade. But he’s around the ball a lot. He also has the versatility to play in the slot and at safety, and he has special teams experience. He’s a guy Baltimore will want to keep, but will there be enough roster room? With Humphrey, Stephens, Arthur Maulet, Wiggins, fourth-round rookie T.J. Tampa (assuming he’s back from hernia surgery within the next couple of weeks), Armour-Davis, Marcus Williams, Kyle Hamilton and Eddie Jackson all looking like roster locks, that doesn’t leave a whole lot of room for other defensive backs. And that’s before we even mention Washington, Damarion Williams, free-agent signing Ka’dar Hollman, veteran Daryl Worley and rookie seventh-round pick Sanoussi Kane.\n\n• Armour-Davis had a strong first two weeks of camp, perhaps improving his roster status more than any other player. He had a few challenges on Monday, though. None bigger than when he bit on a double move and was burned by rookie Devontez Walker for a long touchdown.\n\n• College quarterback-turned-wide receiver-turned-NFL tight end Qadir Ismail may have had his most active practice yet, making a handful of catches, several of them contested. But his most impressive play Monday may have been when he more than held his own in blocking 6-foot-5, 292-pound defensive end C.J. Ravenell. Ismail is still low on a crowded tight end depth chart, but he might be the team’s most improved player from mid-June’s mandatory minicamp through the first two weeks of training camp.\n\n• Ravens offensive linemen had few answers for defensive tackle Travis Jones during the one-on-one period, just like they’ve struggled to block him during the team drills. During a stoppage in practice, Jackson and a handful of offensive players encircled Jones and were playfully pushing him. Quadruple-teaming him felt appropriate at that moment. Rosengarten also struggled at times Monday dealing with the bull rush of Odafe Oweh, who had at least two sacks.\n\n• Wallace is getting a long look as the punt returner with Deonte Harty missing so much time in camp with a lower leg injury. However, he had his issues Monday, twice failing to field — or pick up — a punt cleanly. These preseason games will be big for Wallace.\n\n(Photo: Nick Wass / Associated Press)"
