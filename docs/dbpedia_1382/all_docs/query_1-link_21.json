        "text": "We're into the swing of the new Premier League season, with matchday two bringing plenty more thrills and spills.\n\nBig wins for Chelsea and Manchester City were accompanied by hat-tricks for Noni Madueke and Erling Haaland, while Everton's miserable start to 2024-25 continued as they were thrashed 4-0 at Tottenham.\n\nBut who were the lucky winners and the unlucky losers to emerge from this weekend's set of fixtures, according to the underlying metrics?\n\nWith the help of Opta data, let's find out.\n\nLucky winners: Chelsea\n\nWhile Chelsea's thumping 6-2 win at Wolves was the most emphatic victory of a goal-laden matchday, perhaps fortune smiled on the Blues as they got off the mark under Enzo Maresca.\n\nChelsea's six goals came from an expected goals (xG) figure of just 1.68, with the Blues giving up chances worth 1.96 xG at the other end.\n\nMadueke was joined on the scoresheet by Nicolas Jackson, Cole Palmer and Joao Felix as Maresca became the first manager in Premier League history to see his team score six goals in his first away game at the helm.\n\nUnlucky losers: Wolves\n\nIt might be a tad generous to suggest Wolves were unfortunate after shipping six goals on home soil, four of them coming in a miserable second half as they attempted to chase the game.\n\nHowever, it is certainly fair to say the scoreline did not tell the full story of a game in which Gary O'Neil's men managed 12 shots to Chelsea's 14 and bettered the Blues' 21 touches in the area, registering 25.\n\nChelsea's xG overperformance of 4.31 is the largest of the season by some margin, with Brighton and Spurs both outdoing their underlying figures by 1.57 in their victories over Everton.\n\nNo team managed a bigger overperformance than that throughout the entirety of last season, either, with Newcastle's eight goals from 3.92 xG versus Sheffield United the closest any team got.\n\nLucky winners: Arsenal\n\nChelsea's win at Molineux was one of just two games in the Premier League on matchday two where the victors lost the xG battle.\n\nBut on a weekend where justice was largely done, Arsenal could perhaps count themselves fortunate to leave Aston Villa with a 2-0 victory.\n\nThe Gunners accumulated just 0.87 xG to Villa's 1.28, but goals from Leandro Trossard and Thomas Partey maintained their 100% start to the season.\n\nThis is the third time they have won their first two matches of a top-flight campaign without conceding a goal, having previously done so in 1924-25 and 1971-72.\n\nUnlucky losers: Aston Villa\n\nVilla were a lucky winner on matchday one as they escaped the London Stadium with a 2-1 victory over West Ham, but there was to be no repeat against Arsenal.\n\nUnai Emery's team only hit the target with three of their 11 shots, and striker Ollie Watkins was particularly wasteful as he failed to net from two efforts worth 0.87 xG.\n\nThat is the second-highest figure registered by a player who failed to score in a Premier League match this season, after Nottingham Forest's Nikola Milenkovic versus Southampton on Saturday (0.98 xG).\n\nThe Jamaica Football Federation expressed great elation after the country’s National U14 Team clinched the Caribbean Football Union (CFU) Under 14 Challenger Series in Trinidad and Tobago over the weekend.\n\nJamaica capped a dominant display throughout the tournament by defeating French Guiana 7-1 in the final at the Dwight Yorke Stadium in Tobago on Sunday.\n\nIn the 6 matches played, Jamaica scored 25 goals and only conceded two with only one of them coming from open play.\n\nTheir results in the tournament were as follows: 2-0 vs St. Kitts & Nevis, 6-0 vs Aruba, 2-0 vs Trinidad & Tobago, 5-0 vs Aruba, 3-1 vs Puerto Rico and 7-1 vs French Guiana.\n\nPresident of the Jamaica Football Federation Michael Ricketts expressed commendation for the team and the coaching staff in a press release on Monday.\n\n“I would like to extend my sincere congratulations to our National U14 team for their performances in the recently concluded CFU U14 Challenger Series in Trinidad and Tobago. I would like to commend the players for their grit and determination and work rate as they played 6 matches in just over a week.”\n\nHe continued: “I would also like to congratulate Coach Andrew Peart and his staff for their hard work in preparing the team for the tournament and I am so delighted that it has paid off and it is a good feeling knowing that we will be returning to Jamaica with a trophy.”\n\nGeneral Secretary of the JFF Mr. Dennis Chung also shared commendation for the team.\n\n“I would like to congratulate the U14 Team on being crowned champions of the Tier 1 group, and also commend the staff. This performance is a result of the deliberate effort to adopt the FIFA TDS programme, which is already bearing some fruit.”\n\nBrighton have announced the signing of Matt O'Riley from Celtic on a five-year contract.\n\nThe Denmark international was signed for a fee believed to be more than £25million, a new record transfer fee received by a Scottish club.\n\nO'Riley joined Celtic in January 2022 from MK Dons, going on to make 124 appearances for the Scottish champions. He scored 27 goals and registered 35 assists in all competitions for them.\n\nIn the Scottish Premiership last season, only Lawrence Shankland (24) scored more goals than O'Riley (18), while he got the most assists (13).\n\nOf his goals, 13 were scored from big chances, while he created the third-most chances of any player in the competition (93), behind only James Tavernier and Danny Armstrong.\n\n\"He plays a very specialist position; he is very good at occupying and attacking the right space. He likes making deep runs, and knows when to attack at the right time,\" Brighton manager Fabian Hurzeler said of his new signing.\n\n\"He enjoys getting forward and attacking the opponent's penalty area, but he also has a good defensive instinct. That balance makes him special. He is a great character and has a good ambition to succeed and that's something which is very important for us.\"\n\nCeltic had rejected five bids from Atalanta from O'Riley, with their highest offer being £21.5m plus add-ons.\n\nThe 23-year-old is Brighton's eighth signing of the transfer window, following Yakuba Minteh, Mats Wieffer, Amario Cozier-Duberry, Malick Yalcouye, Brajan Gruda, Ibrahim Osman, and Georginio Rutter into the club."
