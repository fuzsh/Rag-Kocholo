        "text": "Denmark have confirmed eight players who have been cut from their extended FIFA World Cup squad, with coach Age Hareide whittling his list down to 27 players.\n\nThe Caltex Socceroos’ Group C opponents on Monday began a preparation camp in Helsingor, Denmark where they train before facing Sweden and Mexico in pre-Russia friendlies.\n\nBut having previously named a 35-man preliminary FIFA World Cup squad, Hareide has cut eight players, including Southampton midfielder Pierre-Emile Hojbjerg.\n\nREAD: Denmark coach speaks on Christian Eriksen situation as he awaits birth of first child\n\nREAD: Two Aussies Abroad lift silverware, Danny Vukovic’s European success\n\nStar names Christian Eriksen, Kasper Schmeichel and Andreas Christensen, as well as veterans Nicklas Bendtner and Michael Krohn-Dehli, are among the 27 names.\n\nYet Hojbjerg, who made his debut for German giants Bayern Munich at just 17 and was viewed as a prodigious talent by then-coach Pep Guardiola, has not made the cut having struggled for guaranteed game time since moving to the Premier League.\n\nDespite this, Hojbjerg – a technical central midfielder – made 28 appearances for Southampton in all competitions, and was regarded by fans as one of the Saints’ best in a disappointing Premier League season.\n\nHojbjerg, just 22 years old, has made a total of 21 appearances for the senior Denmark team, having debuted as an 18-year-old in 2014.\n\nHere is Denmark’s extended 27-man squad:\n\nGoalkeepers: Kasper Schmeichel (Leicester), Jonas Lossl (Huddersfield), Frederik Ronow (Brondby)\n\nDefenders: Simon Kjaer (Sevilla), Andreas Christensen (Chelsea), Mathias Jorgensen (Huddersfield), Jannik Vestergaard (Borussia Monchengladbach), Andreas Bjelland (Brentford), Henrik Dalsgaard (Brentford), Peter Ankersen (FC Copenhagen), Jens Stryger (Udinese), Jonas Knudsen (Ipswich),\n\nMidfielders: William Kvist (FC Copenhagen), Thomas Delaney (Werder Bremen), Christian Eriksen (Tottenham), Lasse Schone (Ajax), Mike Jensen (Rosenborg), Lukas Lerager (Bordeaux), Michael Krohn-Dehli (Deportivo La Coruna)\n\nForwards: Pione Sisto (Celta Vigo), Martin Braithwaite (Bordeaux), Andreas Cornelius (Atalanta), Viktor Fischer (FC Copenhagen), Yussuf Poulsen (RB Leipzig), Nicolai Jorgensen (Feyenoord), Nicklas Bendtner (Rosenborg), Kasper Dolberg (Ajax)"
