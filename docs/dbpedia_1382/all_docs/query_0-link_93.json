        "text": "So tomorrow this summer's international competition kicks off. I know a lot of people will be watching to get their summer football fix, but might not know all that much about the bb ballers and since I came across the Daily Mail (yes I know, I know, you're all judging) team by team guide, I figured we could kick things off with a general preview of the tournament and the teams involved this year.\n\nEvery two years the elite of Europe's young talent gathers for the UEFA European Under-21 Championship, with entertaining play and no little drama often the end result.\n\nThe tournament kicks off on Saturday when Denmark face Switzerland and Belarus take on Iceland in Group A. The following day, Group B gets under way with games involving 2009 beaten finalists England, the Czech Republic, Ukraine and Spain.\n\nGroup A\n\nDenmark\n\nSquad\n\nJonas Lossl (Midtjylland), Nicklas Hojlund (Lyngby), Mikkel Andersen (Reading),\n\nAnders Randrup (Brondby), Lasse Nielsen (Aalborg), Mathias Zanka Jorgensen (Copenhagen), Andreas Bjelland (Nordsjaelland), Jesper Juelsgaard (Midtjylland), Nicolai Boilesen (Ajax), Daniel Wass (Brondby),\n\nKasper Povlsen (Aarhus), Mads Albaek (Midtjylland), Mike Jensen (Brondby), Thomas Delaney (Copenhagen), Christian Eriksen (Ajax), Matti Lund Nielsen (Nordsjaelland), Bashkim Kadrii (Odense),Soren Frederiksen (Sonderjyske), Mads Fenger (Randers)\n\nNicki Bille Nielsen (Villarreal),Nicolai Agger (Brondby), Nicolai Jorgensen (Bayer Leverkusen), Henrik Dalsgaard (Aalborg)\n\nManager\n\nKeld Bordinggaard - A Danish international during the 80s, the former midfielder’s highest profile role came as assistant to Morten Olsen for the full national side during Euro 2004. This summer will mark his fifth year in the job.\n\nStar man\n\nChristian Eriksen (Ajax) - Arguably one of the finest players that will be on show. A regular for Ajax already, the forward was the youngest player to feature at last summer’s World Cup and left many of the full England internationals on their backsides in a friendly earlier this year. Set for big things.\n\nFixtures\n\nJune 11 - Switzerland (Aalborg)\n\nJune 14 - Belarus (Aarhus)\n\nJune 18 - Iceland (Aalborg)\n\nSwitzerland\n\nSquad\n\nBenjamin Siegrist (Aston Villa), Kevin Fickentscher (Sion), Yann Sommer (Basel)\n\nFrançois Affolter (Young Boys), Gaetano Berardi (Brescia), Fabio Daprelà (Brescia), Timm Klose (Thun), Jonathan Rossini (Sassuolo), Philippe Koch (Zurich), Daniel Pavlovic (Grasshopper),\n\nAmir Abrashi (Grasshopper), Moreno Costanzo (Young Boys), Frank Feltscher (Bellinzona), Fabian Frei (St Gallen), Xavier Hochstrasser (Padova), Pajtim Kasami (Palermo), Fabian Lustenberger (Hertha Berlin), Xherdan Shaqiri (Basel), Granit Xhaka (Basel), Mario Gavranovic (Schalke), Admir Mehmedi (Zurich)\n\nInnocent Emeghara (Grasshopper), Nassim Ben Khalifa (Nuremberg), .\n\nManager\n\nPierluigi Tami - In charge since July 2009, Tami has been on the coaching staff of the full Swiss team under the reign of experienced Ottmar Hitzfeld. He doesn’t ask much of his young players only that they play ‘bravely in attack and compact in defence. I ask of my players that they are capable of adapting to variable systems. I want to see 11 people working in attack as well as defence.’ Tough customer.\n\nStar man\n\nXherdan Shaqiri (Basel) - Has twice run England’s full team ragged in the Euro 2012 qualifiers and will be the creative spark in Switzerland’s midfield. The boy looks good enough to hold down a spot in the full national side so look out for some left-foot wonder whacks from the Basel hot-shot.\n\nFixtures\n\nJune 11 - Denmark (Aalborg)\n\nJune 14 - Iceland (Aalborg)\n\nJune 18 - Belarus (Aarhus)\n\nIceland\n\nSquad\n\nHaraldur Bjornsson (Valur), Arnar Darri Petursson (Sonderjyske), Óskar Petursson (Grindavik)\n\nHolmar Orn Eyjolfsson (West Ham), Eggert Jonsson (Hearts), Hjortur Valgardsson (Gothenburg), Skuli Jon Fridgeirsson (KR Reykjavik), Jon Gudni Fjoluson (Fram Reykjavik), Elfar Freyr Helgason (Breidablik), Thorarinn Ingi Valdimarsson (Vestmannaeyjar)\n\nBjarni Vidarsson (Mechelen), Birkir Bjarnason (Viking), Andres Mar Johannesson (Fylkir), Johann Gudmundsson (AZ Alkmaar), Gylfi Sigurdsson (Hoffenheim), Gudmundur Kristjansson (Breidablik), Aron Gunnarsson (Coventry City)\n\nAlmarr Ormarsson (Fram Reykjavík), Rurik Gislason (Odense), Kolbeinn Sigthorsson (AZ Alkmaar), Alfred Finnbogason (Lokeren), Arnor Smarason (Esbjerg), Bjorn Bergmann Sigurdarson (Lillestrom).\n\nManager\n\nEyjolfur Sverrisson - An experienced player, winning the Bundesliga with Stuttgart as well as the Turkish league title with Besiktas. Capped 66 times for his country, this is his second spell in charge of the Under 21s after a failure to lead the full team to Euro 2008 saw him return back to the role he last held in 2005.\n\nStar man\n\nGylfi Sigurdsson (Hoffenheim) - Reading fans will remember the name fondly, Liverpool fans not so much. Sigurdsson was the star of the show as he helped the Championship club famously knock the Reds out of the FA Cup at Anfield in 2010. Has since joined Bundesliga side Hoffenheim where he continues to shine. Five goals in five qualifying games.\n\nFixtures\n\n11 June - Belarus (Aarhus)\n\n14 June - Switzerland (Aalborg)\n\n18 June - Denmark (Aalborg)\n\nBelarus\n\nSquad\n\nAleksandr Gutor (BATE), Dmitri Guschenko (Vitebsk), Artyom Gomelko (Lokomotiv Moscow)\n\nOleg Veretilo (Dinamo Minsk), Denis Polyakov (Shakhtyor), Yegor Filipenko (BATE), Sergei Politevich (Dinamo Minsk), Sergei Matveychik (Gomel), Evgeni Savostyanov (Neman Grodno), Yuri Ostroukh (Vedrich), Yuri Ryzhko (Torpedo Zhodino)\n\nVitali Gayduchik (Dinamo Brest), Stanislav Dragun (Dinamo Minsk), Dmitri Baga (BATE), Mikhail Sivakov (Wisla Krakow), Nikita Bukatkin (Naftan Novopolotsk), Pavel Nekhaychik (BATE), Dmitri Rekish (Polonia Warsaw), Mikhail Gordeychuk (BATE), Aleksandr Perepechko (Dinamo Minsk)\n\nMaksim Skavysh (BATE), Andrei Voronkov (Kryvbas Kryvyi), Vladimir Khvoshchynski (Dinamo Brest).\n\nManager\n\nGeorgi Kondratyev - A Russian international in the 80s, the 51-year-old has remained largely anonymous in his coaching career and the tournament represents a chance for him to showcase his coaching skills he has developed at various clubs in Belarus over the last 13 years. Has been in his current role since 2008.\n\nStar man\n\nAndrei Voronkov (Kryvbas, on loan from Dynamo Kiev) - Belarus were rank outsiders as it was before play-off hero Vladimir Yurchenko was ruled out for six months on the eve of the tournament. Goal scoring duties will fall to Voronkov who has full international caps and will need to make his 6ft frame count from set-pieces.\n\nFixtures\n\n11 June - Iceland (Aarhus)\n\n14 June - Denmark (Aarhus)\n\n18 June - Switzerland (Aarhus)\n\nGroup B\n\nEngland\n\nSquad\n\nFrank Fielding (Derby), Jason Steele (Middlesbrough), Alex McCarthy (Reading)\n\nRyan Bertrand (Chelsea), Phil Jones (Manchester United), Michael Mancienne (Hamburg), Chris Smalling (Manchester United), Kyle Walker (Tottenham), Marc Albrighton (Aston Villa), Jack Cork (Chelsea),\n\nTom Cleverley (Manchester United), Jordan Henderson (Liverpool), Henri Lansbury (Arsenal), Fabrice Muamba (Bolton), Jack Rodwell (Everton), Danny Rose (Tottenham),\n\nScott Sinclair (Swansea), Nathan Delfouneso (Aston Villa), Daniel Sturridge (Chelsea), Danny Welbeck (Manchester United), Connor Wickham (Ipswich).\n\nManager\n\nStuart Pearce - A passionate, authoritative England international in his heyday, Pearce has tried to hone his coaching skills since retiring. After leaving his first post as Manchester City manager in 2007, he has taken over the Under 21s full-time and is being groomed to take over the full national side.\n\nStar man\n\nDaniel Sturridge (Chelsea) - Spent the first half-season picking up splinters on the Chelsea bench and the second-half banging in goals like crazy at Bolton. If he can keep that sort of form up, England have a great chance of going one step further than their final defeat to Germany two years ago.\n\nFixtures\n\n12 June - Spain (Herning)\n\n15 June - Ukraine (Herning)\n\n19 June - Czech Republic (Viborg)\n\nUkraine\n\nSquad\n\nDenys Boyko (Dynamo Kiev), Dmytro Nepogodov (Metalurh Donetsk), Anton Kanibolotskiy (Dnipro Dnipropetrovsk)\n\nOleksandr Matvyeyev (Vorskla Poltava), Yaroslav Rakitskiy (Shakhtar Donetsk), Temur Partsvaniya (Dynamo Kiev), Yevhen Selin (Vorskla Poltava), Bohdan Butko (Volyn Lutsk), Serhiy Kryvtsov (Shakhtar Donetsk), Oleksiy Kurilov (Vorskla Poltava), Artem Putivtsev (Metalist Kharkiv)\n\nMykola Morozyuk (Metalurh Donetsk), Vitaliy Vitsenets (Shakhtar Donetsk), Denys Garmash (Dynamo Kiev), Taras Stepanenko (Shakhtar Donetsk), Yevhen Konoplyanka (Dnipro Dnipropetrovsk), Volodymyr Chesnakov (Vorskla Poltava), Valeriy Fedorchuk (Kryvbas Kryvyi), Oleg Golodyuk (Karpaty Lviv), Maxym Biliy (Zorya Luhansk)\n\nAndriy Yarmolenko (Dynamo Kiev), Artem Kravets (Dynamo Kiev), Roman Zozulya (Dynamo Kiev).\n\nManager\n\nPavlo Yakovenko - After returning in 2008, this is the second time the 46-year-old has been in charge of the Under 21s following a spell between 2002 and 2004. A dynamic player in the mid-80’s, he won the European Cup-winners’ Cup in 1986 with Dynamo Kiev before starring for Russia at the World Cup in Mexico that summer.\n\nStar man\n\nAndriy Yarmolenko (Dynamo Kiev) - A star in Dynamo Kiev’s Europa League run, the 21-year-old can play either as a forward or as a winger where at over 6ft he boats pace, power and trickery. Will be keen to show some of his talent that had Manchester City in a twist earlier this season.\n\nFixtures\n\n12 June - Czech Republic (Viborg)\n\n15 June - England (Herning)\n\n19 June - Spain (Herning)\n\nSpain\n\nSquad\n\nDavid De Gea (Atletico Madrid), Ruben Mino (Barcelona), Diego Marino (Villarreal)\n\nMikel San Jose (Athletic Bilbao), Álvaro Domínguez (Atletico Madrid), Alberto Botía (Sporting Gijon), Martin Montoya (Barcelona) Jose Ángel Valdes (Sporting Gijon), Cesar Azpilicueta (Marseille), Didac Vila Rosello (AC Milan), Victor Ruiz (Napoli)\n\nAnder Herrera (Real Zaragoza), Diego Capel (Sevilla), Daniel Parejo (Getafe), Thiago Alcantara (Barcelona), Ruben Perez (Deportivo), Javi Martínez (Athletic Bilbao), Juan Mata (Valencia)\n\nBojan Krkic (Barcelona), Adrian (Deportivo), Emilio Nsue (Real Mallorca), Iker Muniain (Athletic Bilbao), Jeffren (Barcelona).\n\nManager\n\nLuis Milla - Impressive playing CV that includes spending much of his career at Real Madrid sandwiched in between spells at Barcelona and Valencia. After taking charge of the Under 17s and Under 19s, the 45-year-old took the reins of the Under 21s last year and this tournament could provide a big case for him to take control of the full squad in the future.\n\nStar man\n\nBojan Krkic (Barcelona) - His talent is undeniable but he is at the right place at the wrong time in a star-studded Barcelona squad. Can finally step out the shadow of Lionel Messi, David Villa and Pedro to show Europe just what he can do and all of the continent’s top clubs will be monitoring him closely.\n\nFixtures\n\n12 June - England (Herning)\n\n15 June - Czech Republic (Viborg)\n\n19 June - Ukraine (Herning)\n\nCzech Republic\n\nSquad\n\nJan Hanus (Slavia Prague), Marek Stech (West Ham), Tomas Vaclik (Viktoria Zizkov)\n\nOndrej Celustka (Slavia Prague), Jan Hosek (Teplice), Jan Lecjaks (Anderlecht), Ondrej Mazuch (Anderlecht), Radim Reznik (Banik Ostrava), Marek Suchy (Spartak Moscow)\n\nLukas Vacha (Slovan Liberec), Milan Cerny (Slavia Prague), Borek Dockal (Slovan Liberec), Marcel Gecov (Slovan Liberec), Adam Hlousek (Kaiserslautern), Tomas Horava (Sigma Olomouc), Jan Kovarik (Jablonec), Lukas Marecek (Anderlecht)\n\nJan Moravek (Kaiserslautern), Jan Chramosta (Mlada Boleslav), Vaclav Kadlec (Sparta Prague), Libor Kozak (Lazio), Tomas Pekhart (Nuremberg), Michael Rabusic (Zbrojovka Brno).\n\nManager\n\nJakub Dovalil - Moved into coaching at the relatively young age of 24, Dovalil has made his way up the Czech coaching system, taking control of the Under 17s, Under 19s and now the Under 21s. He isn’t doing too badly either with eight out of eight wins so far, albeit he missed two of the qualifying games.\n\nStar man\n\nTomas Pekhart (Nuremburg) - The former Tottenham protege was destined for big things at White Hart Lane until injury hampered his progress and he never played a first-team match. The injury ridden striker finally looks like getting back to his best after signing for Bundesliga side Nuremburg. Top scorer in qualifying with nine goals from just six games.\n\nFixtures\n\n12 June - Ukraine (Viborg)\n\n15 June - Spain (Viborg)\n\n19 June - England (Viborg)\n\nSource\n\nSo who are you looking forward to watching through out the tournament and who do you think will be coming away with the trophy?"
