        "text": "Christian Eriksen wants to play for Denmark in this year’s World Cup as the former Tottenham playmaker targets a remarkable comeback from his cardiac arrest.\n\nThe 29-year-old’s world was turned upside down in June when he suffered a cardiac arrest during the Euro 2020 group match against Finland in Copenhagen.\n\nEriksen received life-saving treatment on the pitch before being taken to hospital and was fitted with an implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD) device.\n\nThe attacking midfielder has not played since but has been stepping up individual training as he looks to playing for his country again.\n\n“My goal is to play in the World Cup in Qatar,” Eriksen said. “I want to play. That’s been my mindset all along.\n\n“It’s a goal, a dream. Whether I’ll be picked is another thing. But it’s my dream to come back.\n\n“I’m sure I can come back because I don’t feel… I don’t feel any different. Physically, I’m back in top shape.\n\n“That’s been my goal and it’s still some time away, so until then I’m just going to play football and prove that I’m back at the same level.”\n\nAsked how important the national team is in this process, he told Danish broadcaster DR1: “Very important. I want to play on the national team in the World Cup.\n\n“My dream is to rejoin the national team and play at Parken again and prove that it was a one-timer and that it won’t happen again.\n\n“I want to prove I’ve moved on and that I can play on the national team again.\n\n“Again, it’s up to the manager to assess my level. But my heart is not an obstacle.”\n\nEriksen thanked doctors, team-mates and well-wishers in the interview, with the former Ajax man speaking about how he “died for five minutes” on the pitch.\n\n“It was amazing that so many people felt a need to write or send flowers,” he said.\n\n“It had an impact on so many people and they felt a need to let me and my family know. That makes me very happy.\n\n“At the hospital, they kept saying I’d received more and more flowers.\n\n“It was weird because I didn’t expect people to send flowers because I’d died for five minutes.\n\n“It was quite extraordinary but it was very nice of everyone and it’s been a big help to me to receive all those best wishes. And people still write to me.\n\n“I’ve thanked people I’ve met in person. I’ve thanked the doctors, my team-mates and their families in person.\n\n“But all the fans who’ve sent thousands of letters and emails and flowers, or who’ve come up to me on the street both in Italy and Denmark, I thank them all for the support I got from all over the world that helped me through this.”\n\nEriksen spent six-and-a-half seasons at Tottenham before joining Inter Milan in January 2020 for a fee in the region of £17million.\n\nHe was part of last season’s Serie A title triumph but left the Nerazzurri last month as Serie A rules would not allow him to play with an ICD.\n\nEriksen spent some time training on his own at Odense – where he was a youth team player between 2005 and 2008 – and was recently seen practising alone at Swiss club Chiasso.\n\nHis agent Martin Schoots told the Daily Mail: “It is going really well for Christian.\n\n“He had all the medical checks just before Christmas and the results were so good that we expect him to be involved in a group training with a team some time later in January.”\n\nDenmark became the second European nation to reach the 2022 World Cup after a 1-0 home win over Austria on Tuesday left them top of qualifying Group F with an unassailable seven-point lead over second-placed Scotland with two games to spare.\n\nAfter Germany advanced to the 32-nation tournament in Qatar on Monday, the Danes secured their own berth as a 53rd-minute goal from Joakim Maehle helped them to an eighth successive qualifying victory.\n\nDenmark and Germany joined Qatar, who gained an automatic spot in the finals as the host nation. Only the group winners from European qualifying advance directly while the runners-up enter the playoffs.\n\nDenmark have scored 27 goals and conceded none so far in World Cup qualifying, with their run to the finals underpinned by some impressive free-flowing football.\n\nThey did, however, look jittery for long spells against a well-organised Austria side.\n\nVisiting goalkeeper Daniel Bachmann denied Andreas Skov Olsen and Mikkel Damsgaard in the first half and then kept out a Thomas Delaney effort in the 48th minute as the home side struggled to create clear-cut chances.\n\nBut Bachmann was powerless five minutes later as Denmark’s best moment of the match produced a brilliant goal with Delaney at the heart of a breathtaking move.\n\nThe central midfielder weaved his way past four markers through the middle and then teed up Maehle to plant his shot from eight metres inside the near post and delight the home fans in a packed Parken stadium.\n\nDelaney was elated after the match as Denmark made it to their second successive World Cup, having reached the round of 16 in the 2018 tournament before advancing to the Euro 2020 semi-finals this year.\n\n“It’s a pleasure throughout, in every match,” Delaney told the country’s Kanal 5 television.\n\n“The support we’ve had. It is unique, what we have created, we can be proud of. There have been winds against us in other qualifying campaigns. This is something quite unique to us.”\n\nMaehle added: “It means a lot, it’s one of the coolest nights in the Park in a long time. It is fantastic. It’s strong for us to win here, and we got this ticket to the World Cup.”\n\nDenmark struck early to finish off Scotland in their 2-0 World Cup qualifying win in Copenhagen.\n\nSteve Clarke’s side were two down in 15 minutes through goals from Daniel Wass and Joakim Maehle and were then run ragged for the rest of the first half.\n\nA reshuffled Scotland side with Lyndon Dykes on for the second half showed marked improvement but nowhere near enough to dent the scoreline.\n\nWhile defeat was no surprise, it puts the Scots’ qualification hopes under a harsher light.\n\nScotland now have five points from a possible 12 and face Moldova at Hampden Park on Saturday before a trip to Austria next Tuesday and they are running out of points to lose.\n\nKasper Hjulmand’s side, who reached the semi-finals of Euro 2020, have won all four Group F games and look to be cruising to qualification.\n\nClarke had claimed it was the most disruptive build-up to a match in his time as Scotland boss and through injuries and Covid-19 issues, he had to choose from a depleted squad.\n\nCraig Gordon, the 38-year-old Hearts keeper, was reinstated for his 58th cap while to some surprise, captain Andy Robertson was be deployed as a right wing-back with Kieran Tierney on the other side.\n\nKenny McLean, who missed Euro 2020 through injury, was back in midfield alongside Norwich team-mate Billy Gilmour with Che Adams leading the line.\n\nDenmark were also without several players including star striker Martin Braithwaite and Kasper Dolberg but it did not affect them as they stormed into an early and commanding lead.\n\nIt was all too easy when Wass rose above Tierney at the back post in the 13th minute to head in a searching cross from Pierre-Emile Hojbjerg.\n\nLess than two minutes later, there was more finesse when Maehle slipped a second through the legs of Gordon from six yards after working a one-two with Mikkel Damsgaard.\n\nThe visitors then struggled to stem a red and white tide.\n\nDanish goalkeeper Kasper Schmeichel was a spectator as the home side gave Scotland the run-around and in the 32nd minute Gordon had to make a save from Yussuf Poulsen following a free-kick to the back post.\n\nScotland were happy to hear the half-time whistle and Clarke brought on Dykes for Scott McKenna.\n\nTierney moved into the back three, Robertson back over to the left and Ryan Fraser dropped to right wing-back.\n\nThree minutes after the restart Gilmour drove wide from 25 yards to five to offer some hope.\n\nHowever, Denmark’s talent could not be suppressed and just after the hour mark Gordon clutched Thomas Delaney’s 25-yard drive.\n\nRyan Christie replaced Adams in the 71st minute and soon afterwards McLean set up Callum McGregor but his left-footed shot was easily saved by the under-employed Schmeichel.\n\nDefender Grant Hanley headed a Gilmour cross past the far post before Schmeichel made a fine save down at his right-hand post from Fraser’s shot with the corner coming to nothing.\n\nWith four minutes remaining Gordon made a save from Hojbjerg’s close-range header and, as the game eased into added time, midfielder Lewis Ferguson replaced Gilmour to make his Scotland debut but the match was effectively over.\n\nHarry Kane propelled England to just their second major tournament final as Gareth Southgate’s men secured an extra-time penalty win against Denmark to set-up Sunday’s match against Italy.\n\nItaly lie in wait after a tense, pulsating semi-final under the arch on Wednesday night, when Simon Kjaer’s own goal cancelled out a superb Mikkel Damsgaard free-kick before Kane sealed a 2-1 extra-time win after his penalty was saved.\n\nEngland made a start as electric as the atmosphere at Wembley, but Damsgaard’s stunning 25-yard free-kick silenced the home support as the 21-year-old continued to shine in place of the sadly absent Christian Eriksen.\n\nIt was the first goal England had conceded during an unusually straightforward summer, but they responded well to the setback and Kjaer turned 19-year-old Bukayo Saka’s cross into his own goal under pressure from Raheem Sterling.\n\nKasper Schmeichel had superbly denied the latter moments earlier and the goalkeeper shone throughout a second half in which the video assistant referee cleared a Christian Norgaard challenge on Kane in the box.\n\nThe Denmark goalkeeper continued to impress in extra-time but could not stop England progressing to the final, with Kane slotting home after the Leicester man saved his initial spot-kick after Sterling was judged to have been fouled.\n\nDenmark grew into proceedings, with Pierre-Emile Hojbjerg seeing a shot saved and Jordan Pickford surviving a lackadaisical moment.\n\nKasper Hjulmand’s well-drilled side continued to push as Damsgaard bent wide, with Pickford entering England’s record books by breaking World Cup winner Gordon Banks’ long-standing 720-minute record without conceding. He only managed to extend it to 726 minutes.\n\nLuke Shaw fouled Andreas Christensen when a free-kick came over, giving Denmark another chance from a better position.\n\nDamsgaard stood over it and unleashed a thumping 25-yard strike that beat Pickford, sending Denmark’s red wall into raptures in the 30th minute.\n\nEngland did eventually settle back into a rhythm and Schmeichel spread himself well to stop Sterling turning home a Kane cross from close range.\n\nIt was a missed opportunity that the forward helped atone for in the 39th minute.\n\nSaka kept his cool and drove over a cross from the right that Kjaer turned into his own goal under pressure from Sterling.\n\nHarry Maguire saw a goalbound header superbly denied one-handed by Schmeichel in a second half that England were controlling as Denmark began to retreat deeper.\n\nSouthgate turned to fan favourite Jack Grealish to change the dynamics and the VAR decided against awarding a penalty after reviewing a clumsy Norgaard challenge on Kane.\n\nEngland continued to push right into stoppage-time, when Maguire saw another header saved by Schmeichel and Kane’s point-blank effort was blocked by Kjaer.\n\nGrealish stung the palms as the onslaught continued, with fleet-footed Sterling creating havoc for the tiring Danish defenders.\n\nJoakim Maehle was adjudged to have ended Sterling’s mazy run and Makkelie pointed to the spot. There was another ball on the pitch during a phase of play that the VAR reviewed, but the decision stood.\n\nKane stepped up and Schmeichel saved, only for the ball to land kindly for him six yards out to turn home and spark bedlam in the stands.\n\nDenmark tried desperately to level in the second period but a Martin Braithwaite shot was the biggest threat they managed, with Sterling denied by Schmeichel before the final whistle sent the 60,000-plus crowd wild.\n\n‘Sweet Caroline’ echoed around the ground as England celebrated reaching their first European Championship final.\n\nDenmark beat the Czech Republic 2-1 in Baku to book their place in the semi-final of Euro 2020.\n\nThomas Delaney headed Denmark into an early lead and Kasper Dolberg also struck shortly before half-time.\n\nCzech frontman Patrik Schick reduced the deficit with his fifth goal of the tournament in the 49th minute, but it was Denmark who progressed to secure a semi-final spot at Wembley on July 7th.\n\nKasper Hjulmand’s squad have grown in stature during the tournament, after their horrific start when Christian Eriksen collapsed with a cardiac arrest in their opening defeat to Finland in Copenhagen.\n\nDenmark got off to the fast start as Borussia Dortmund midfielder Delaney took full advantage of some slack marking to headed home from a corner after just five minutes.\n\nThe Czechs had progressed from England’s group as one of the best third-placed teams and then pulled off a shock victory against 10-man Holland in the last 16.\n\nBut Jaroslav Silhavy’s men were unsettled by going behind so early and Mikkel Damsgaard almost celebrated his 21st birthday with a goal when breaking into the penalty area and taking the ball around the goalkeeper, but his effort was cleared off the line.\n\nThe Czechs finally threatened at the other end when Petr Sevcik’s shot flew over before Delaney almost added a second after another Denmark break down the right saw his scuffed shot drop wide.\n\nLukas Masopust found space on the edge of the Denmark box to thread a ball through to Tomas Holes, but goalkeeper Kasper Schmeichel was out quickly to smother his angled shot.\n\nAs the half-hour approached, the Czechs were slowly growing into the match.\n\nA deep free-kick from Sevcik dropped just out of reach of defender Ondrej Celustka’s head as he ghosted in at the far post before a volley from Holes flew straight at Schmeichel.\n\nDenmark, however, doubled their lead shortly before half-time.\n\nJoakim Maehle darted down the left and clipped over a brilliant cross through the penalty area, which was just too far in front of Martin Braithwaite but perfect for Dolberg to score from close range.\n\nSilhavy made two changes for the second half, with Michael Krmencik and Jakub Jankto replacing Holes and Masopust, to inject fresh lift into the team.\n\nSchmeichel parried away a 25-yard effort from Krmencik and then saved Antonin Barak’s effort.\n\nThe Czechs’ pressure told, tough, as Schick pulled a goal back in the 49th minute, converting a cross from Vladimir Coufal to take his tournament tally to five.\n\nDenmark coach Hjulmand also opted for a double substitution on the hour, with Dolberg replaced by Yussuf Poulsen and Brentford’s Christian Norgaard coming on for Mikkel Damsgaard.\n\nThere was another hold-up in play when West Ham midfielder Tomas Soucek needed treatment for a head wound above his ear after accidentally being caught by Poulsen’s boot.\n\nPoulsen’s low, 25-yard shot following a break was saved by Tomas Vaclik, who then beat away a rising drive from the Denmark substitute before sticking out a boot to deny Maehle at the near post.\n\nDenmark saw out six minutes of added time to book their place in the semi-finals.\n\nWales bowed out of Euro 2020 as Denmark cruised to a 4-0 last-16 win in Amsterdam.\n\nKasper Dolberg’s double and late efforts from Joakim Maehle and Martin Braithwaite put the seal on an excellent Denmark display.\n\nWales’ misery was compounded by the 90th-minute dismissal of substitute Harry Wilson for felling Maehle.\n\nNice striker Dolberg was only playing because Yussuf Poulsen, scorer of two goals in the competition, had missed out with a hamstring injury.\n\nBut the former Ajax player, back in familiar surroundings at the Johan Cruyff Arena, made the most of his opportunity by punishing Wales in each half with ruthless finishes.\n\nWales had put in the air miles at a tournament which has taken them to Baku, Rome and Amsterdam.\n\nIt appeared as if the journey had finally caught up with them as Denmark dominated for long periods and fully deserved their victory.\n\nThe build-up to the game had been dominated by the Dutch government banning Wales fans because of coronavirus restrictions.\n\nA small band of Wales supporters did find their way into the stadium, but they were heavily outnumbered by several thousand Denmark fans who had been allowed to make the trip.\n\nDenmark boss Kasper Hjulmand had also expressed his hope that local Dutch support would rest with his side, particularly as their stricken midfielder Christian Eriksen spent five years of his career at Ajax.\n\nWales boss Robert Page recalled Ben Davies, Chris Mepham and Kieffer Moore from the side beaten 1-0 by Italy in their final group game.\n\nThe trio were carrying yellow cards and Page chose not to risk them in Rome as another booking would have ruled them out of the Amsterdam clash.\n\nWales reverted to a familiar 4-2-3-1 formation, while Denmark were forced to make two changes after beating Russia 4-1 in Copenhagen to qualify for the knockout stage.\n\nWales started well and skipper Gareth Bale was influential in the early stages of an open contest.\n\nBale was twice off target from 25 yards, his first effort whistling past Kasper Schmeichel’s post, as Wales enjoyed more possession than they had probably envisaged.\n\nSchmeichel also held Daniel James’ deflected effort, but Denmark’s move to a back four with Andreas Christensen pushed forward to curb Aaron Ramsey’s impact moved momentum in their favour.\n\nDenmark forced a series of corners and took a 27th-minute lead when Maehle and Mikkel Damsgaard combined superbly for Dolberg to finish with a superb curling shot.\n\nDolberg almost doubled Denmark’s lead with a clever flick from close range but Danny Ward blocked with his legs.\n\nWales’ problems grew as the half drew to a close as Denmark sensed the tie could be put to bed before half-time.\n\nConnor Roberts was forced off through injury and replaced by Neco Williams, while Moore was harshly booked to pick up a one-match suspension.\n\nWard made another fine stop from Maehle right on half-time but Denmark doubled their lead three minutes after the break, much to Wales’ grievance.\n\nWales wanted a free-kick after Simon Kjaer appeared to barge into Moore, but play was allowed to continue by German referee Daniel Siebert.\n\nBraithwaite beat Joe Rodon with a neat turn of pace and substitute Williams made a hash of the cross.\n\nThe ball fell to Dolberg who lashed home his second and the goal stood after a VAR check adjudged that Braithwaite had kept the ball in play at the start of his run.\n\nMathias Jensen and Braithwaite both hit the post as Denmark were inches away from ramming home their superiority further.\n\nBut Wales were simply out of ideas and Denmark punished them again in the closing stages.\n\nMaehle smashed home a left-footed shot from close range moments before Wilson became the second Wales player to be sent off at Euro 2020.\n\nBraithwaite’s stoppage-time effort then stood after a lengthy VAR check for offside, as Denmark eased into a quarter-final tie against either Holland or the Czech Republic.\n\nDespair turned to exhilaration for Denmark as they claimed an astonishing 4-1 victory over Russia to scramble into the last 16 of Euro 2020 on a wonderful night in Copenhagen on Monday.\n\nDenmark will face Wales in the Euro 2020 last 16 after clinching second place in Group B.\n\nNeeding a victory to have any chance of progression, the Danes took the lead in the 38th minute through a stunning Mikkel Damsgaard strike and Yussuf Poulsen doubled the advantage just before the hour mark as he punished a mistake by Roman Zobnin.\n\nRussia replied with Artem Dzyuba’s 70th-minute penalty before strikes from Andreas Christensen in the 79th minute and Joakim Maehle three minutes later wrapped up victory in front of a delirious crowd at the Parken Stadium.\n\nThe result, combined with Belgium’s 2-0 win over Finland, sees Kasper Hjulmand’s Denmark through to take on Wales in Amsterdam on Saturday as Group B runners-up, while Stanislav Cherchesov’s Russia, having started the match lying second in the pool, are out having ended up bottom.\n\nDespair turned to exhilaration for Denmark as they claimed an astonishing 4-1 victory over Russia to scramble into the last 16 of Euro 2020 on a wonderful night in Copenhagen on Monday.\n\nDenmark will face Wales in the Euro 2020 last 16 after clinching second place in Group B.\n\nNeeding a victory to have any chance of progression, the Danes took the lead in the 38th minute through a stunning Mikkel Damsgaard strike and Yussuf Poulsen doubled the advantage just before the hour mark as he punished a mistake

runners-up, while Stanislav Cherchesov’s Russia, having started the match lying second in the pool, are out having ended up bottom.\n\nRussia reduced the deficit when Aleksandr Sobolev was fouled by Vestergaard and the resulting spot-kick was struck past Schmeichel by Dzyuba.\n\nBut Denmark were soon back on the front foot, and after Matvei Safonov made three saves in quick succession to deny Christensen, Martin Braithwaite and Simon Kjaer, the ball came to Christensen, who cracked it home for 3-1.\n\nMaehle then swiftly added the fourth with a strike from the edge of the box, and made the number 10 – which Eriksen wears on his shirt – with his fingers as he celebrated amid the roar of the Danish fans.\n\nKevin De Bruyne came off the bench to fire Belgium into the last 16 with a comeback victory over Denmark on an emotional night in Copenhagen.\n\nPlaying for the first time since suffering facial fractures during the Champions League final, the Manchester City playmaker set up Thorgan Hazard’s 55th-minute equaliser and then clinched a 2-1 Group B win with a stunning finish 20 minutes from time.\n\nFive days after midfielder Christian Eriksen had suffered a cardiac arrest on the same Parken Stadium pitch, Yussuf Poulsen fired the Danes into an early lead as FIFA’s number one-ranked team were outplayed until De Bruyne arrived to light up proceedings.\n\nKasper Hjulmand’s men could hardly have got off to a better start when they took the lead with less than two minutes gone.\n\nJason Denayer’s careless pass out of defence was picked off by Pierre-Emile Hojbjerg and when he fed Poulsen, the striker smashed a low shot across keeper Thibaut Courtois and inside the far post.\n\nCourtois found himself in the thick of action early on, diving at the feet of wing-back Joakim Maehle and then fielding Daniel Wass’ header back across goal inside the opening six minutes with Belgium in uncharacteristic disarray.\n\nPlay stopped briefly as the clocked ticked around to 10 – the shirt number worn by Eriksen – as the players of both sides and officials joined the spectators in a moving moment’s applause for the Inter Milan midfielder.\n\nBelgium simply could not force their way into the game as they repeatedly squandered possession to leave Danish keeper Kasper Schmeichel untested, and Courtois was relieved to see Eriksen’s replacement Mikkel Damsgaard curl a 35th-minute effort just past the upright.\n\nRoberto Martinez sent on De Bruyne as a half-time substitute in a desperate search for inspiration – he was soon to be followed by Axel Witsel and Eden Hazard – and the move paid dividends within 10 minutes.\n\nRomelu Lukaku ran away from the Danish defence before squaring for De Bruyne, who expertly dummied his way into space before rolling the ball into the path of the fast-arriving Thorgan Hazard to thump into the net.\n\nBut it was his sumptuous 70th-minute strike, which flew past the helpless Schmeichel and into the bottom corner, which ultimately won the day and maintained the Red Devils’ perfect start.\n\nMartin Braithwaite might have rescued a point three minutes from time, but saw his header from substitute Andreas Skov Olsen’s cross clip the crossbar and run away to safety."
