Daniel Wass signed for Valencia CF just over a year ago, joining from Celta Vigo with the intention of playing Champions League football. He ended the season with a Copa del Rey winner's medal and a return to the Danish national team.

The versatile player featured as a central midfielder, on both wings and also -when required- as an emergency left back. As a result, Wass played some 50 games for the club in 2018/19: 32 in LaLiga, 8 in the Copa del Rey, 7 in the Europa League and 3 in the Champions League.

Along the way, the Dane scored two goals. The first was against Villarreal CF, and helped Valencia CF through to the semifinals of the Europa League. The second was a vital strike against SD Huesca in the league. Besides the goals on his personal tally, he also contributed to seven more, with six assists and one penalty won.

His performances this past season did not go unnoticed by the Danish national team, who on June 10th recalled him to the squad after nearly 3 years away. He took part in a comprehensive win over Georgia, participating in two goals.
