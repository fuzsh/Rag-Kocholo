        "text": "For the vast majority of travelers, the best time to visit Portugal is without a doubt during the spring or fall. Here’s what to expect if you visit during these periods:\n\nVisiting in Spring and Fall\n\nBetween April and May, and in September and October, the weather is nice, temperatures are warm but not too hot (ranging from about 14ºC to 25ºC), and you’ll have plenty of sunshine and daylight hours. These are the perfect times of year for hiking, cycling, golfing, or birdwatching, and if weather permits, you can even hit the beach some of the time (this is especially true for the early fall).\n\nThis is also the shoulder season, so there are fewer crowds, which means prices are more affordable and you’ll find lots of availability in hotels, restaurants, and even car rentals.\n\nNow, there’s a bit of a caveat to this though, as Portugal’s climate changes drastically from one region to another, so nice weather in one part of the country does not guarantee a similar experience elsewhere.\n\nFor green landscapes, head north: the North of Portugal is usually the rainiest region, and it can be fairly wet and overcast during the spring and fall. It certainly won’t rain every day, and if you’re looking for lush landscapes, green hills, and deep forests, that’s where you’ll find them. You do need some rain to maintain all that green after all!\n\nIf you want to hit the beach, go south: on the other hand, the Alentejo and the Algarve are the driest regions in mainland Portugal, and you will very likely find warm, sunny weather almost every day during the spring and fall.\n\nYou’ll see very different shades of green (perhaps more tan and brown even) when compared to the North, but it’s pretty likely that you’ll get a few perfect beach days along the Costa Vicentina in the Alentejo, or anywhere along the coast in the Algarve.\n\nExperience local life in the big cities: Lisbon and Porto are mostly busy all throughout the year, but during the spring or fall you’ll find many more locals than tourists, which can be quite pleasant if you want to experience traditional Portuguese life.\n\nLocals in the cities will be fully in the swing of their daily life during both seasons, so these periods are very much “business as usual” and the cities are note overwhelmed by or focused on tourism.\n\nPorto is in the north, so you won’t be guaranteed great weather, whereas Lisbon, further to the south, should be quite pleasant most of the time.\n\nVisiting in summer\n\nJuly and August are the busiest months of the year no matter where you go in Portugal. Both Portuguese and foreign travelers get their time off from work in the summer, and children are on their summer recess, so people descend in hordes on the Portuguese coastline, all trying (in vain) to find an empty beach. This is basically mission impossible, especially in the Algarve, Madeira, and the West Coast.\n\nAs a result, in these regions, or really anywhere that you can find the sea or a beach, you’ll find the highest accommodation rates and big summertime crowds.\n\nMost of Portugal is also quite hot in the summer, and temperatures can become rather scorching, especially in the south (Alentejo and Algarve). Exploring the cities and inland towns especially can be pretty uncomfortable given the heat. Temperatures are more moderate on the coast, but then you need to deal with the crowds and prices.\n\nOn the other hand, if you’re looking to explore Lisbon and Porto, you’ll find both cities nearly empty, because all the locals will be on vacation elsewhere. You’ll still have the occasional crowds of course, and lots of international tourists will be visiting, but both cities will be significantly less busy than at other times of year.\n\nIf you’re interested in the outdoors, summer is the perfect season to visit Serra da Estrela, Peneda Gerês, or Montesinho Natural Parks. In general, the entire north of the country is also lovely at this time of year, as it sees much more moderate temperatures than elsewhere.\n\nVisiting in winter\n\nAs you can imagine, beaches and coastal towns will be almost deserted during the winter. In touristic areas, many hotels, guesthouses, and restaurants close down, as there are very few foreign visitors and tourism mostly shuts down entirely during this period. While everything will be quiet, you’ll find the lowest accommodation rates, so that is a definite plus.\n\nYou’ll find lots of rain and relatively cold temperatures in the north of the country, while the Algarve, in the south, and the island of Madeira, will both be quite sunny and warm, with temperatures reaching 20ºC on most days.\n\nIf you want to explore nature (in the south, for the most part) or generally have a quiet, unhurried, and less expensive vacation, winter can be a very nice time to visit. Just be prepared for suboptimal weather in much of the country.\n\nHow long to spend in Portugal\n\n10 days - for a good introduction to just the mainland (no islands)\n\nEven though Portugal is a small country, you need a minimum of 10 days to see all of it. A 10-day trip to Portugal is enough to visit the mainland from North to South, tour the major cities, such as Lisbon and Porto, explore some countryside villages, and relax for a day or two on the beach.\n\nOf course, ten days isn’t enough time to see everything, and you’ll quickly find that there are almost endless itineraries to choose from. So, your main challenge with a ten-day visit will be deciding which places to include, and which ones to cut out. Below are some ideas for how to structure a week and a half on the Portuguese mainland.\n\nOn a 10-day trip, you could focus first on Lisbon and Porto, our two major cities, and then take day trips to nearby points of interest like Sintra and Cascais (from Lisbon), and Braga and Guimarães (from Porto). After that, you’d still have time for a couple of days of blissful relaxation in the Algarve, where you can hit the beach and soak up the sun.\n\nAlternatively, you could do a road trip and traverse the country from north to south, moving to a new destination every night and hopping between coastal towns, countryside villages, and lovely natural areas.\n\nFor inspiration on what to do with 10 days, check out our 10-day Portugal road trip.\n\n2 weeks - if you want to slow down and savor the country\n\nNow, if you have a full two weeks to dedicate to the Portuguese mainland, that’s really ideal, as it will allow you to combine everything that I’ve mentioned above.\n\nYou’ll be able to spend some time in Porto and Lisbon, make day trips to the surrounding cities, towns, and historical sites, and road trip through the country, hitting all the highlights along with lesser-known destinations that few international visitors ever make it to. If you’ve got 14 days to spare, this is the perfect amount of time to spend here.\n\nA full month - if you want to explore the mainland AND the islands\n\nIf you want to explore all of Portugal in a single trip, including the island regions of the Azores and Madeira, I recommend that you set aside a full month. This way, you’ll have plenty of time to roam the country at a reasonable pace, without rushing from one place to the next so quickly that you don’t even remember where you went after your trip.\n\nYou’ll also have the luxury of being able to add extra days to somewhere if you find that you just love it there. In this case, I’d suggest two full weeks for the mainland, and then a week for each of the islands.\n\nMadeira and the Azores are fairly sizable islands, and both have quite a lot to see and do on them. They’re also paradise for nature-lovers, and so if you want to hike, discover remote destinations, and relax on the beach, you’ll need some time!\n\nCombine this with the travel time that it takes to get to and between the islands, and it just doesn’t really make sense to spend much less than a week on each (you’re inevitably going to lose some days to travel).\n\nOfficially, Portugal is divided into 18 districts and 2 autonomous regions. However, the districts are mostly administrative and exist for governmental purposes, and for visitors, the distinctions from one district to the next are pretty insignificant.\n\nSo, from a tourist perspective, it makes much more sense to consider Portugal according to its 7 “regions”. There are 5 mainland regions and 2 island ones. On the mainland, heading from north to south, you’ll find Northern Portugal, Central Portugal, the Lisbon Metropolitan Area, the Alentejo, and finally, the Algarve.\n\nOffshore, there are our two island regions, the Azores and Madeira.\n\nEach region is quite distinct, so below is a quick overview of each. You can read more in our guide to Portugal’s 7 regions.\n\nNorthern Portugal\n\nHome to Porto and the Douro Valley, the northern Portugal is lush, green, and picturesque. It has an idyllic coastline with lovely beaches, charming mid-sized cities such as Braga and Guimarães, a remote, gorgeous interior (Peneda Geres National Park and Montesinho Park are both here), and tiny stone villages that appear as if stuck in time, hidden deep in the Tras-os-Montes area.\n\nCombine all of that with the friendliest people in Portugal and some of the country’s best food, and you’ll understand why just one visit here could never be enough.\n\nCentral Portugal\n\nOften ignored by tourists who just pass through when traveling between Lisbon and Porto, Central Portugal actually has a lot to offer. Here, you’ll find incredible surfing in places like Nazaré and Peniche on the West Coast, great hiking in the Serra de Estrela mountains, vibrant city life in Coimbra, and magnificent medieval architecture in places like Alcobaça, Batalha, and Tomar.\n\nYou could have a marvelous trip traveling only within Central Portugal, so be sure to dedicate at least a few days of your itinerary to this lovely part of the country.\n\nLisbon Metropolitan Area\n\nThe most densely populated part of the country, the Lisbon area is the engine of the Portuguese economy. Almost a third of the country’s population lives here, so it is a bustling, busy, and heavily developed region. Interestingly though, outside of Lisbon, its star attraction, there aren’t that many major tourist sites in the area.\n\nThe extraordinary castles and palaces of Sintra are an exception to this, as are coastal gems of Cascais and Estoril. Further to the south, the Parque Natural da Arrábida is a nature-lover’s paradise, filled with forests, mountains, and incredible beaches.\n\nAlentejo\n\nThe Alentejo is Portugal as it used to be; small walled villages with medieval cores and Roman ruins watched over by ancient castles. Portugal’s largest region and its agricultural heartland, the rolling countryside is planted with cork forests, olive groves, vineyards, and all manner of crops.\n\nWhitewashed villages pop up occasionally, like little oases, where people continue in their customs and daily rhythms much as they did hundreds of years ago. On the region’s coast, some of the country’s best beaches, which are almost entirely unknown to all but locals, are found on the vast and dramatic Costa Alentejana and Costa Vicentina stretches.\n\nAlgarve\n\nThe Algarve, my home, is Portugal’s southernmost region, famed for its golden, sandy beaches and perpetual sunny weather. While the region is truly a coastal paradise, the Algarve has much more to offer than just sun and sand. The countryside, bordered by the Monchique and Caldeirão mountains to the north and the Guadiana River to the east, holds authentic villages and towns that will transport you back in time.\n\nEven though the Algarve seems small, as you make your way across its 300-kilometer coastline stretching out along the Atlantic Ocean, you’ll witness countless exceptionally beautiful landscapes and will experience dramatic changes in scenery. The one constant, however, will be the breathtaking views.\n\nMadeira\n\nRoughly 1,000 kilometers away from the Portuguese mainland, the archipelago of Madeira sits in the Atlantic Ocean off the coast of northern Africa, with Morocco actually being the closest country to it. The landscapes and scenery here are totally unique, and are unlike anything on the mainland.\n\nBetween the four islands of Madeira (two inhabited and two uninhabited), you’ll find gorgeous sandy beaches, towering mountains and cliffs, dense forests, and more waterfalls than you can count. If you’re looking to get out into stunning nature, Madeira is for you.\n\nAnd for a bit of city life, Funchal, the main city of the archipelago, is a lot of fun and well worth taking some time to explore.\n\nAzores\n\nIn the middle of the Atlantic, between the United States' east coast and Portugal's mainland, lies an archipelago of nine volcanic islands known for its stunning green hills, dark land, and volcanic wines.\n\nPonta Delgada is the capital and the largest city in Azores, and is likely where your journey will begin. A medieval city that was an important merchant port in the 15th century, it has quite a lot of history.\n\nOutside of the city, the Azores is all about truly breathtaking landscapes. Here, you’ll find incredible volcanic lagoons and caves, the highest mountains in Portugal, white sand beaches, and verdant, dense vegetation that seems as if from another world.\n\nCost\n\nThe cost of renting a car will depend on the type of car you rent, the extras, the type of insurance, and the time of the year. Usually, in the summer, car rental rates skyrocket due to the high demand. On the other hand, during winter that’s when you’ll find the lowest rates.\n\nSo, I advise you to always book in advance regardless of the time of the year. This way, you’ll save money and guarantee availability.\n\nWhile traveling in Portugal, you’ll notice most cars are manual. Rest assured, car rental companies always have a few automatic available. Yet, you should know due to their low stock, renting an automatic will be more expensive than hiring a manual.\n\nOnce you have your rental car, it’s time to hit the road!\n\nRoad conditions\n\nMost roads in Portugal are in fairly good shape. Highways are the best roads in the country connecting the mainland’s coastal cities. If you’re traveling shorter distances, take a national road. You’ll find road conditions aren’t that good, and some of the countryside roads will require you to drive slowly.\n\nToll roads\n\nAll roads in Portugal are free of charge, except for the highways. Every few kilometers you’ll find a tollbooth. You can pay in cash, but paying by card is always the easiest and fastest way. You should also know that the toll system isn’t the same on every highway.\n\nFor instance, in the Algarve, you’ll drive through a traffic camera that’ll take a picture of your license plate and send the bill home so you can pay a few days later. Considering you’ll be driving a rental car, ask your provider for a transponder. This way, you’ll prepay a fee and don’t have to worry about paying tolls.\n\nParking\n\nParking availability will highly depend on the location you are in. In Lisboa and Porto, the most convenient option is the underground parking. You’ll pay per day or per hour, and there’s always a place available.\n\nYou can also park on the street, in designated places where you pay the parking meter per hour. However, I don’t recommend this option, especially in Lisboa and Porto, since there is a higher chance of break-ins. Yet, if you park on the street, remember to store your belongings in the trunk to avoid having anything in sight.\n\nParking in other locations in Portugal is usually simpler. Although most historical city centers have few parking spaces, you can always check for free parking spaces on the street.\n\nGas stations and electric vehicle charging stations\n\nWhether you’re renting a gas, a diesel, or an electric, Portugal has a wide availability of gas stations. In fact, you’ll find more gas stations in the largest cities than in the countryside. That’s why I recommend filling your tank before heading to the countryside.\n\nDue to the rising popularity of electric and hybrid cars, you’ll also find recharging stations at gas stations, supermarket parking lots, and around the main cities. Again, if you’re traveling through the countryside, you should go in a fully recharged vehicle.\n\nGetting around by bus\n\nThis is probably the most popular public transport in Portugal and its certainly the most extensive. Several different types of buses connect all of our cities, most of our small towns, and even many villages, all throughout the country.\n\nBuses traveling longer distances are usually more comfortable and provide onboard wifi, air conditioning, and toilets. Rede Expressos and Flixbus are the two main bus companies. You can buy tickets in advance directly on their websites.\n\nLocal buses are much more modest. In each region, you’ll find a different bus company. For instance, in the Alentejo, there's Rodoviária do Alentejo, while in the Algarve, there’s Vamus. Although most local bus stops don’t show the timetables, you can always check the schedule online or at the ticket office.\n\nFor local buses, you can buy tickets beforehand at the ticket office or directly with the bus driver as you board the bus. Just know that buying tickets on the bus is usually more expensive and the fare must be paid in cash.\n\nWhere to buy bus tickets\n\nOmio is an aggregator I like that shows options for public transport routes all over the world (and lets you book them).\n\nWhen you do a search, you’ll be able to see all your options for trains, buses, flights, and even ferries along with a host of different companies that provide the services. Comparing prices is easy, the site has a great design, and you can keep all your bookings in one place. It costs a little bit more than booking direct, but it’s really convenient.\n\nTaking the train\n\nIn Portugal, you have good train connections between major cities on the mainland. Smaller towns are almost never reachable with the train and you’ll find that most routes run along the coastline from north to south, and only a few head into the countryside.\n\nTrain service is provided by the national rail carrier, Comboios de Portugal.\n\nThe Alfa Pendular is our high-speed train, and it has routes traveling the length of the country, from Braga in the north, to Faro in the far south, connecting the largest coastal cities all along the way. This is the most convenient and fastest way of traveling in the country.\n\nAlternatively, for a cheaper option, or in cases where the Alfa Pendular doesn’t cover your destination, you can take the Intercidades train. It makes more or less the same route as the Alfa Pendular, but it’s not as fast or as modern (it is a bit cheaper though).\n\nFor shorter train rides, use the Interregional or the Regional train. These trains connect small towns and villages along the coastline and into the countryside. The most well-known of these train line is the one in the Douro Valley, since the train rides along the riverside (it’s very picturesque).\n\nWhere to buy train tickets\n\nYou can buy your tickets online, in advance, on the Comboios de Portugal website. You can check routes, timetables, and compares prices for different service classes fairly easily. The website is available in English.\n\nPayment is made by credit card, and they’ll email your ticket, in a PDF file, once the purchase is complete. I recommend printing the ticket just in case your smartphone runs out of battery.\n\nOmio, which I mentioned before in regard to the bus, is an aggregator site that you can also use for checking routes and timetables for trains. Prices are a little higher than buying direct, but their website is a bit more user-friendly than the official Comboios de Portugal site.\n\nDomestic flights\n\nEven though Portugal is a small country, sometimes it’s easiest (and cheapest) to fly domestically.\n\nOn the mainland, it’s common for people take a flight between Faro (in the south) and Porto (pretty far north), for instance. Instead of driving for 7 hours or riding the bus for almost 12 hours, the flight between these destinations takes only 45 minutes. This service is generally provided by low-cost companies, so tickets are quite inexpensive. Book well in advance to find the best rates.\n\nSome intercontinental flights arriving to Lisbon airport will offer a connecting flight to Faro or Porto, so depending on where you want to start your trip, it could be worth booking an arrival to Lisbon and then adding on a transfer to Faro or Porto.\n\nWhether this is worthwhile will really depend on the waiting time between flights and the price though.\n\nIf you want to get to the Azores or Madeira, a flight from Lisbon or Porto is by far the most common and convenient option. There are regular flights between both sets of islands and Portugal’s two biggest cities, and they are often relatively inexpensive.\n\nNote that you’ll also find flights that connect the various Azores islands with one another.\n\nTaxis and ride-share apps\n\nTaxis are available anywhere in Portugal, from the main city centers to even the majority of the smallest villages in the countryside.\n\nYou can hail a taxi from anywhere, but there’s an exception. In Portugal, the Road Traffic Act doesn’t allow taxi drivers to collect passengers from bus stops. Alternatively, you can call the local taxi company or use their app (if they have one).\n\nRide-sharing apps are also available in Portugal, especially in the largest coastal cities. Their vehicles use the TVDE name tag on their front and rear windows so they’re easier to identify. In Lisbon, you’ll find Rideshares, Bolt, Uber, Lyft, Ola and Didi. Throughout the country, Bolt and Uber are the most common, but Lyft is also pretty popular.\n\nSimilar to taxis, ride-sharing vehicles can pick you up from most places, except bus stops and taxi ranks. Also, you can’t hail a TVDE as you would do with a taxi.\n\nOther useful things to know\n\nHere are a few basic details that’ll make your time in Portugal much easier.\n\nLearn to say thank you!\n\nYou’ll hear the Portuguese saying thank you in many ways, which might be confusing (even for some Portuguese). The ladies say “Obrigada” and the gentlemen say “Obrigado”. It's that simple.\n\nGreeting other people\n\nWhen you arrive somewhere or want to greet someone, it is customary to “hi”. So, in the morning, which goes until noon, you say “Bom dia”. After lunch, you say “Boa tarde”. And in the evening and night, you say “Boa noite”.\n\nIf you prefer something simpler, just say “Olá” (Hello). It’s friendly, and you don’t have to think about the time of the day.\n\nHow widely is English spoken?\n\nYou’ll find that most Portuguese speak some level of English, especially in the largest cities and tourist hotspots. And if they don’t, they'll try their best to help you understand them. In the main tourist destinations of Madeira and Algarve, you’ll find many people speaking more than one language. Besides English, the most common second languages are French, Spanish, and German.\n\nTips on clothing\n\nThe Portuguese are very casual people, so you’ll find all sorts of attire day and night. However, we are also on the conservative side.\n\nWhile on vacation, especially if you’re in a beach town, avoid going to restaurants, supermarkets, or any other public service in a bikini, see-through beachwear, or bare-chested. It looks tasteless, and some might even consider it offensive.\n\nIf you’re going for dinner, always confirm if there’s a dress code. Although most restaurants are casual about what you wear, others are rigorous and might refuse your reservation if you don’t meet their standards.\n\nWhen visiting churches and religious locations such as Fátima, women should avoid wearing deep cleavage or showing their shoulders. As for men, consider wearing long pants and closed shoes.\n\nBargaining\n\nBargaining in Portugal isn’t that common, except if you’re at the outdoor markets trying to buy something from a local vendor. However, bargaining in hotels and restaurants is something you should avoid, as it’ll make you look cheap and tiresome."
