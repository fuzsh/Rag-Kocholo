        "text": "Geography\n\nLocated in the southern part of Europe, Portugal is in the Iberian Peninsula. It is located around the Atlantic Ocean and Spain.\n\nIt has an 88,889-kilometer square surface area in Europe. From its easternmost point there is a 218-kilometer border, from north to south there is a 561-kilometer border, there are 832 kilometers of coastline, and with Spain 1,215 kilometers of border strips.\n\nThe Azores is the archipelago located in the Atlantic Ocean between Europe and America. It consists of 9 islands with a total area of 2,355 square kilometers. These islands are in 3 groups:\n\nEast group â€“ Sao Miguel and Santa Maria,\n\nCentral group â€“ Terceira, Grasoza, San Jorge, Pico and Faial and\n\nWestern group â€“ Flores and Corvo. It is possible to reach the island with a flight of approximately 2 hours. Madeira Islands spread over a total of 741 square kilometers in the Atlantic Ocean. It is 500 kilometers away from the nearest West African coast and 1000 kilometers away from Europe (and flights from Lisbon take about one and a half hours).\n\nGovernance\n\nThere are 18 administrative regions in the country. The Azores and Madeira have autonomous status in the Atlantic Ocean. In Portugal, which has a single-parliamentary parliament with 230 seats, general elections are held on a principle of proportional representation every four years. In the last general elections on (4 October 2015), a minority government was established with the support of the other leftist parties (Left Block, Communist Party) represented by the Socialist Party in Parliament.\n\nThe president can be chosen twice by the people for five years. Marcelo Rebelo de Sousa, who won the last Presidential elections held on January 24, 2016, took over this task on 9 March 2016.\n\nClimate\n\nIn Portugal, the Mediterranean climate dominates, while the winter months are rainy and mild, the summer months are quite hot and dry. The climate in the country is not very visible, but the southern part is generally drier and warmer than the northern part. The northern part of the country has oak, chestnut and prairie forests, and there are olives almost everywhere in the country.\n\nReligion\n\nApproximately 95% of the country is Catholic, the rest is Jewish, Muslim, and Protestant. Society is separated by secularism, and religion and state affairs are separated by secularism. Individuals are freed in religious choices, but the majority of the population is Catholics. The Catholic Church has a great influence on society because of its past in history.\n\nIndustry and Tourism\n\nAgriculture: Generally, productivity in agriculture and livestock production is low and marketing opportunities are not developed. The farms in the north are small and divided between the families.\n\nWheat, corn, rye, rice, oats, dried tofu, potatoes, various fruits, and vegetables. 8% of the arable land consists of olive trees, 6% ties (worldâ€™s 6th largest wine producer). Cereal and vegetable production is in the north, citrus and olive production is in the south. The vineyards are the inner regions behind Lisbon. Mushroom production is also an important source of income.\n\nLivestock: The total number of animals (cattle, sheep, goats, horses, donkeys) is 10.5 million. Fishing, which constitutes the most important sector of animal husbandry, is a great source of foreign exchange. Sardines and cod are the most hunted species.\n\nIndustry: Industry events have gathered in several centers, such as Lisbon and Porto. The largest industry is textile (cotton and wool). Shipbuilding and repair, oil refining and processing, steel, artificial fertilizer, chemistry, building materials, paper, furniture, ceramics, food are other important sectors. 53% of annual electric energy production is from hydroelectric power plants.\n\nTourism: Portugal is one of the most tourist receiving countries in Europe. The Algarve in the south and the capital Lisbon, Madeira, and the Azores Islands are the most popular destinations for tourism.\n\nArt\n\nMuseu Calouste Gulbenkian (Calouste Gulbenkian Museum), one of the favorite addresses of tourists and tourists who are curious about ancient artworks, is located in the Lisbon city limits.\n\nCalouste Gulbenkian Foundation operates the museum, which was the legacy of businessman Calouste Gulbenkian and opened its doors in October 1969. This country, which provides you with colorful days thanks to its entertainment life, culture-art venues, historical texture, and unique beaches, has a very active appearance, especially in spring and summer months.\n\nSports\n\nFootball is the most popular sport in Portugal. As of October 2011, the Portuguese national soccer team is in the 8th place in the FIFA World Ranking among FIFA member national teams of 208 countries.\n\nThe legendary EusÃ©bio is still the unforgettable symbol of Portuguese football. Luis Figo was selected by FIFA as the player of the year 2001. Rui Costa and Cristiano Ronaldo are considered to be important players."
