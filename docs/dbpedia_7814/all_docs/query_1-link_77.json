For many looking to lead a good life, Portugal is the best country to live in for a variety of reasons. Keep reading to find out why living in Portugal could be the best choice for you.\n\nSituated at Europe’s western tip, right beside the ocean, this European Union (EU) country boasts a mild climate, vibrant economy, low crime rate, and high quality of life. The landscape includes mountains, beautiful beaches, and lush forests, and the sites encompass everything from grand castles to quaint, colorful houses. So what exactly makes Portugal a dream destination for so many expats, particularly non-EU citizens?\n\nEvery Portuguese city has something different to offer. Porto is great for families, Braga offers a glimpse into the country’s rich history, charming Aveiro is popular with students, and Portugal’s capital city, Lisbon, is vibrant and buzzing with diversity.\n\nFor beach lovers, Portugal is a great surfing destination.

So, is Portugal a good place to live? Let’s take a look.\n\nPortugal is Safe\n\nNot only is Portugal a beautiful country, but it is also safe. On the Global Peace Index 2022, Portugal ranks as the 6th safest country in the world, following Iceland, New Zealand, Ireland, Denmark, and Austria. As one of the safest countries, Portugal has a low crime rate, friendly people, and a low cost of living which make it more attractive than some northern European countries. Whether on mainland Portugal or one of the islands, you can live comfortably and focus on enjoying the stunning sites, slow pace, delicious food, and rich culture.\n\nPortugal Promotes Social Cohesion\n\nPortugal has a tradition of implementing progressive and tolerant laws that facilitate social cohesion within the country. For example, same-sex marriage became legal in Portugal in 2010, and drugs were decriminalized in 2001, the latter of which resulted in a dramatic drop in overdoses, HIV infection, and drug-related crime. Such initiatives have allowed the country to see greater social peace, contributing to its inhabitants’ excellent Portugal quality of life.\n\nIf you don’t speak the Portuguese language, you may worry about a potential language barrier.

These facilities are located throughout the country and can be accessed freely by all Portuguese residents. Any foreigner who is a Portuguese resident can benefit from the country’s excellent health care! Private health insurance is also available in Portugal, as is international health insurance, and is offered at more affordable prices than in other countries. Private clinics even allow consultations with your doctor over the phone.\n\nPortugal Has a Strong Economy\n\nWhile Portugal’s economy has steadily been getting stronger following the financial crisis and the impact of COVID-19, the country has maintained a relatively low cost of living that remains more affordable than other countries in western Europe. Portugal’s strong economy has attracted investors from around the globe, particularly those looking to invest in real estate.\n\nIn 2022, the total amount of investment transactions in Portugal increased by about 9.6 percent. Despite this growth, you can still find property prices that are relatively affordable. Portugal offers many exciting investment opportunities, a variety of properties, and diverse locations to choose from.
