        "text": "Portuguese African Exploration Overview\n\nForming the Southwest corner of Europe, Portugal is surrounded by water: most of its territory faces the Atlantic ocean and oversees access to the Mediterranean sea, making it geographically close to Africa. Interested in trade with Asia and rumors of Africa beyond the Muslim lands they had encountered, Portugal first turned its nautical skill towards exploring Africa. Under leaders like Henry the Navigator and John II, Portugal searched for gold, enslaved people, and new converts to Christianity.\n\nHenry the Navigator\n\nHenry the Navigator is another name for Henrique of Portugal, a prince and duke who oversaw the exploration of Africa by Portugal from 1415. He was the leader of a Catholic religious order descended from the Knights Templar, known as the Military Order of Christ. His interest in exploring Africa had several features, including stopping slave raiders from Morocco, investigating the legends of a Christian king known as Prester John, who Europeans believed to exist somewhere beyond the Muslim-controlled lands, and rumors of gold deep in Africa.\n\nThe rumors of endless gold in Africa came to Europe after African king Mansa Musa, sometimes referred to as the richest man who ever lived, visited Cairo on his pilgrimage to Mecca. Although Mansa Musa was certainly extremely wealthy, determining his actual economic worth compared to today is impossible due to changing economic systems.\n\nEarly Explorations\n\nHenry led the conquest of Ceuta, a port city in Morrocco, in 1415. With this foothold in Africa, the uninhabited island of Madeira was settled in 1419 and the uninhabited islands of the Azores in 1431. This enabled the Portuguese to extract gold and enslaved people from the African continent while using those slaves on island plantations. In 1446, Portuguese explorers reached as far as what is now Sierra Leone before Henry died in 1460.\n\nWith the death of Henry, there was less governmental interest in exploration. A merchant named Fernão Gomes took up the task. He managed to discover the overland gold trade and set up a trading post.\n\nJohn II of Portugal\n\nAfter Henry the Navigator died in 1460, Portuguese exploration of Africa heavily slowed down. When John II took the throne of Portugal in 1481, he wasted no time reinvigorating Africa's exploration with three primary goals: gold, enslaved people, and finally making contact with the mythical kingdom of Prester John. With these goals, he set out several explorers across land and sea.\n\nJohn II Era Explorations\n\nExplorerMission ResultBartolomeu DiasSail to determine the southern end of Africa and find the kingdom of Prester John. Found the Cape of Good Hope, the Southern tip of Africa. Pêro da CovilhãFind a land route to India, locate the source of spices, and find the kingdom of Prester John. Found overland route to India and spices, explored the eastern coast of Africa, and found Ethiopia.Diogo CãoExplore the west coast of Africa by sail. Discovered the Kongo River and made contact with the kingdom of Kongo.\n\nVasco da Gama\n\nVasco da Gama was a Portuguese explorer who built upon the work of earlier explorers like Bartolomeu Dias. He traveled not just to the tip of Africa but around it and up the East coast of Africa for the first time. His contacts with African peoples were not of a friendly nature, though. He was driven out of various locations such as Mombasa and Mozambique and even turned to piracy.\n\nThe Portuguese African Exploration Timeline\n\n1415 – Portuguese take control of Ceuta\n\n1419 – Portuguese take Madeira\n\n1431 – Portuguese take the Azores\n\n1482 – Kingdom of Kongo is discovered by the Portuguese\n\n1487 – Bartolomeu Dias sails to the Cape of Good Hope\n\n1492-3 – Ethiopia discovered\n\n1495 – Kingdom of Kongo convert to Christianity and formally aligns with Portugal\n\n1497-8 – Vasca de Gama sails around the Cape of Good Hope and on to Asia\n\n1507 – Relations with Ethiopia begin\n\nDiscoveries of the Portuguese Exploration of Africa\n\nUnder Henry the Navigator, Portugal began what is known as the Age of Exploration. At this time Europeans took to the seas and vastly expanded their knowledge of the world beyond Europe. Portugal encountered new people and ideas and made its own discoveries, such as the volta do mar, an innovative technique to utilize winds and sea currents in navigation. Keep reading to know more about this!\n\nWhat Portugal knew about the larger world and how early they knew it is up for debate. The kingdom was notoriously secretive about its discoveries. Records from this period were destroyed in various conflicts, leaving a mystery of how much knowledge of the world Portugal had.\n\nVolta Do Mar\n\nThe volta do mar was a crucial innovation in Portuguese maritime exploration. The Portuguese mariners discovered that in the Atlantic ocean existed permanent vortexes of air current or \"gyres.\" Instead of slowly traveling along the coast of Africa, the Portuguese realized that if they traveled West into the Atlantic Ocean, they would encounter these gyres. By riding the gyres, their ships could travel much further and faster.\n\nThe first gyre they discovered was the North Atlantic Gyre, off the coasts of Europe and Africa. This is one of the five large ocean Gyres on Earth.\n\nKingdom of Kongo\n\nDiogo Cão made the first contact between Portugal and the Kingdom of Kongo in 1483. He left some of his men in the kingdom and brought some Kongo nobles back to Portugal. Upon their return to Kongo in 1885, the king of Kongo decided to convert to Christianity. After another group of Kongo leaders was sent to Portugal to be educated, the king of Kongo took on the Christian name of João I. Ultimately, João I abandoned Christianity, but his son made it the official religion of Kongo and established the Catholic church there.\n\nPrester John in Ethiopia\n\nA myth had long existed in Europe that a Christian kingdom lay beyond the lands controlled by the Muslims. This kingdom was believed to be the strongest and wealthiest Christian kingdom and was sought as an ally. Various early rumors placed the kingdom in the East, and some later placed it south of Europe in Africa. The stories were embellishments, likely based on accounts of Christian groups that did exist in the East.\n\nDiscovery of Ethiopia\n\nMany explorers from Portugal were tasked with locating this kingdom. Eventually, an explorer named Pêro da Covilhã located the Christian kingdom of Ethiopia, which he identified as the court of Prester John. Covilhã was well treated by Emperor Eskander of Ethiopia but was not allowed to leave the country. Eventually, he convinced the later Empress Eleni to send an envoy to Portugal and establish relations and an alliance against the Ottoman Empire in 1517.\n\nEthiopian representatives were confused by the Portuguese referring to their ruler as \"Prester John.\" The legend was a European Christian invention later applied to Ethiopia, although they did not know the stories.\n\nImpact of the Portuguese Exploration on Africa\n\nThe Middle Ages had been a golden age for Africa. Wealthy and well-developed civilizations had been built up. The arrival of the Portuguese altered two of the major trades in Africa: gold and enslaving people. Although Arab slave traders from Northern Africa still sold the enslaved people to the Portuguese, their \"commodities\" now traveled by ship to Portugal, instead of land-based caravans to Northern Africa and into Italy. Many enslaved Africans were sent to work plantations on islands off the coast of Africa that had been uninhabited before the Portuguese arrived.\n\nAfter experiencing failure attempting to grow some of the crops grown in Portugal on these island colonies, the Europeans succeed in planting sugar cane on the plantations.\n\nSpread of Christianity\n\nIn addition, to the economic interest in gold and enslaved people, Portuguese exploration also had a religious interest. Explorers were often given orders to locate the mythical Christian kingdom of Prester John. In addition, colonizers were instructed to Christianize the areas they claimed. Many of the leaders of these explorations, including Henry the Navigator and Bartolomeu Dias, were members of the Military Order of Christ, a group descended from the Knights Templar.\n\nPortuguese Exploration of Africa - Key Takeaways\n\nHenry the Navigator began the Age of Exploration.\n\nThe first step was conquering Ceuta in Morocco.\n\nSought to find gold, enslaved people, the sea route to India, and the kingdom of Prester John.\n\nThe Discovery of the ocean currents off the coast of Africa aided Portuguese sailors."
