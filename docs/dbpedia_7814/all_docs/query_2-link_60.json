        "text": "This historic tour takes us back to the date of Sandemanâ€™s establishment, exploring the roots of its historical heritage and its irreverent advertising since the start of the 20th century. The tour ends in The 1790 Room, with an extended tasting of Port Wines.\n\nAn experience which begins with the timeline of Sandeman's history and its long tradition in the production of high quality Old Tawnies.\n\nIn the tasting, the award-winning wines Sandeman Tawny 10, 20, 30 and 40 Years Old... a complete century of Tawnies.\n\nThe Don leads visitors through rows of vats and casks, in a building where Sandeman Porto Wine ages since 1811. A fascinating story, which ends with the tasting of three styles: White, Ruby and Tawny.\n\nVisit the Sandeman Cellars, and enjoy an extraordinary Metaverse Experience to Quinta do Seixo in the Douro Valley!\n\nAt the end, enjoy a delicious port wine tasting including the irreverent Sandeman Beat on Ice!\n\nOnly available from the age of 16."
