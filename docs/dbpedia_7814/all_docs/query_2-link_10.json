Thus, in place of the County of Portugal, the independent state of the Kingdom of Portugal was formed.\n\nThe Kingdom of León recognized the independence of the Kingdom of Portugal only 4 years later, signing the Treaty of Zamora in 1143. In 1179, the Papal States also recognized Portugal as an independent state.\n\nFor a very long time, Castile was an enemy of the Portuguese Empire. But Portugal finally got rid of the enemy and began to strengthen its economy and territories. In 1386, a treaty was signed between England and Portugal, beginning the Anglo-Portuguese Alliance, the longest alliance in diplomatic history. When Dinis became king, civil war, earthquake, plague and war began. In 1367, Fernando became king and started many wars. But they were all unsuccessful. In 1373 and 1381 he again started wars with Castile. Portugal was devastated and destroyed. The first Portuguese trade agreement was signed with England in 1308, when Dinis created the Portuguese navy. In 1471, colonies were founded in Morocco. In East Africa, small Islamic countries along Mozambique, Brava and Quilua were ravaged or became colonies of Portugal. In 1500 Portuguese Brazil was founded. Maurice was founded in 1507. Socotra was colonized in 1506. Under King John III, active colonization of South America began.\n\nFortified settlements were established in northeastern Brazil, the first being the city of São Vicente, located in the coastal part of the modern state of São Paulo, founded in 1532, and the capital of the colony of Salvador (now the capital of the state of Bahia), founded in 1549. In 1536, at the request of King João III of Portugal, the Inquisition was officially established in Portugal. After the death of John III, the regency under the young Sebastian passed to Cardinal Enrique. Sebastian was fond of knightly exploits and, having reached adulthood, began an adventurous war for the liberation of Morocco, in which he died in 1578 in the battle of El Ksar el Kebir. Enrique resigned and married to take the throne, but the Pope did not approve him as king. Enrique soon died without leaving any heirs, and the Spanish Habsburg dynasty took the throne. In 1578, the Portuguese king Sebastian died during a North African expedition. King Philip II of Spain annexed the Portuguese Empire in 1580. When Spain intervened in the Seven Years' War, the Spanish army invaded Portugal, but with the help of the British, the Portuguese defeated the Spanish at Valencia de Alcantara and Vila Velha. and in 1640 peace was concluded. Portugal regained its independence from Spain and John IV came to the throne. During the Napoleonic Wars, Regent João 6 moved the capital to Brazil, Rio de Janeiro. Brazil gained independence in 1825. In 1906, Carlos I granted dictatorial powers to João Franco, who ruled the country without convening the Cortes. But in 1908, Carlos and his eldest son Luis Filipe (heir to the throne) were killed by terrorists. The youngest son of Carlos Manuel 2 became king, Franco was removed from power. In 1910, the Kingdom of Portugal became a Republic.\n\nPolitics[edit | edit source]\n\nRelationship[edit | edit source]\n\nFamily[edit | edit source]\n\nBrazil - child\n\nAngola - Child\n\nFriends[edit | edit source]\n\nEngland\n\nNeutral[edit | edit source]\n\nDraft:Kingdom of France\n\nHoly Roman Empire\n\nOttoman Empire\n\nScotland\n\nEnemies[edit | edit source]\n\nSpanish Empire\n\nCastilia\n\nJerusalem\n\nPast versions[edit | edit source]\n\nArabic caliphate\n\nFuture versions[edit | edit source]\n\nNew Republic\n\nOpinions[edit | edit source]\n\nSpanish Empire[edit | edit source]\n\nGallery[edit | edit source]\n\nFan-Art[edit | edit source]\n\nArt by Brcountry\n\nArt by CT\n\nArt by CT\n\nArt by yylixxs\n\nArt by yado_mari\n\nArt by nichidokuioji\n\nArt by 7613231945\n\nArt by 7613231945\n\nArt by Норвежский Хаски\n\nFlags/Symbols[edit | edit source]\n\nFlag\n\nCoat of arms\n\n[edit | edit source]"
