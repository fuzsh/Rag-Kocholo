I truly believe that this revolutionary project will position Eco Wave Power as a leading wave energy developer and serve as a significant milestone towards the commercialization of our wave energy technology globally. I would like to thank the Municipality of Porto and APDL, for being true wave energy pioneers, by enabling and supporting the development of an innovative, environmentally friendly energy generation technology, which will serve to lower the port's carbon footprint, while creating new workplaces and an innovative industry in Portugal.\"\n\nThe first MW project is being executed in line with a 20MW Concession Agreement entered into with APDL and is planned to be followed by a gradual expansion to the whole 20MW of installed capacity.\n\nIn March 2024, the Company received the final approval necessary for the commencement of the construction works of our first commercial-size project in Porto (TURH license) from APDL Port Authority, and issued a performance bond to APDL, meant to solidify the Company's commitment for the construction of the first commercial wave energy project within a 2-year period.\n\nEco Wave Power's project is well in line with the renewable energy plan of the Government of Portugal, as in July, 2024, Portugal announced that it aims to generate 85% of its annual electricity production from renewable sources by 2030, compared to 61% in 2023, one of the highest ratios in Europe.\n\nEco Wave Power is being advised by partner Joana Brandão and her team from leading Portuguese law firm PLMJ. Joana and the firm have significant experience in supporting the regulatory framework for renewable energy projects execution across Portugal and have been assisting Eco Wave Power since 2020.\n\nAbout Eco Wave Power Global AB (publ)\n\nEco Wave Power is a leading onshore wave energy company that developed a patented, smart and cost-efficient technology for turning ocean and sea waves into green electricity.\n\nEco Wave Power's mission is to assist in the fight against climate change by enabling commercial power production from the ocean and sea waves.\n\nThe Company owns and operates a grid connected wave energy project in Israel, with co-investment from EDF Renewables IL and the Israeli Energy Ministry, which recognized Eco Wave Power's technology as \"Pioneering Technology.\" The Israeli wave energy project marks the first grid-connected wave energy system in Israel's history.\n\nEco Wave Power will soon commence the installation of its third and fourth wave energy projects, in the Port of Los Angeles, and in Portugal.
