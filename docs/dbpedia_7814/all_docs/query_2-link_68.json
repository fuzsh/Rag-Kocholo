Its modern façade was commissioned in the 19th century by King Ferdinand II and Queen Maria II. The palace was created entirely from stone, with Moorish arches, towers, and a large central tower that reaches an impressive height. Inside, you can find a variety of luxurious rooms built with exquisite details we explore during our Day Trip from Lisbon.\n\nPeña Palace and Park are one of the most famous Sintra landmarks and attractions.\n\nPeña Palace is one of the most famous Sintra landmarks and attractions.

It’s full of picturesque monuments and panoramic views of the region.\n\nThe Peña Palace was built in 1838 by King Ferdinand II to be used as a summer palace for his guests to stay at during their visits.

We promise though, that once at the top you can look into a chapel or walk around outside to see all of Sintra’s most famous landmarks. While walking around outside we saw some other castles in the distance which was really cool too. You can also walk into this chapel if you want more views from inside as well.\n\nIf you have time we would recommend taking a look at some of the other beautiful sights in Sintra such as the Moorish Castle (built by Moors in the 8th century) and the Palace of Monserrate.\n\nAnother important landmark for us to visit is the Moorish Castle, which the Moors built in the 8th century.\n\nIs Moorish Castle worth visiting? Well it's one of the most stunning things about the Iberian peninsula is the many Moorish vestiges left from the great Muslim empire in northern Africa. Built during the 8th and 9th centuries, the Castle of the Moors is one impressive example of strategic fortifications built for defense. The castle was later left in ruins until Christian crusaders took the Moorish construction in 1147.\n\nAt the Moorish Castle, you can see an ancient wall that was used to defend the location against enemies approaching from outside. This section is called “The Castle” because it was once a fortress for Portuguese kings and queens. The oldest part of Peña Palace is actually this Moorish castle!\n\nThe Historical Background of Sintra\n\nOn the other side, you will see where the Christian victory took place as King Afonso Henriques won back Portugal in 1147. This was known as the Battle of Ourique. It is considered a turning point in the Reconquista, the Christian conquest of Spain by King Alfonse VI of Castile, who led his troops to victory over a Muslim army consisting largely of Berbers and Moors from North Africa.\n\nKing Afonso Henriques was crowned with a crown made from gold taken from his own father's helmet by Bishop Sisnando Davide on July 25, 1139, at Church Santa Maria do Olival near Porto, who also anointed king with holy oil given to him by Pope Innocent II. He then proclaimed himself “King” but only after many years did he receive official recognition from Pope Adrian IV on June 24, 1154.\n\nWhy is Peña Palace so famous?\n\nThe Peña Palace is one of the most beautiful castles in Europe and it's a must-see while you're in Sintra.
