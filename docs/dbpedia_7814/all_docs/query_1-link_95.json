Proof of this are the data obtained by the National Institute of Statistics of Portugal (INE) that show a growth of 4.1% of GDP and 3.7% of export growth between 2019 and so far in 2021.\n\nThis has been possible due to its constant change and economic growth, which has required the implementation of profound reforms by the government in the banking, pension and labor market sectors. This has allowed Portugal to become an attractive destination for investors and businessmen who want to establish themselves in the country.\n\nAdditionally, with the country's entry into the European Economic Community 35 years ago, it became a varied market economy based on services (this part is below in international trade).\n\nPrime location\n\nStrategically located on the west coast of Europe, it limits to the north and east with Spain, and to the west and south with the Atlantic Ocean, which makes it easy for it to act as a vital point for commercial relations between three continents: Africa, America and Europe, ideal for those investors, businessmen or entrepreneurs who wish to do business in the European market or take them around the world.\n\nFavorable legal framework\n\nThe international agreements signed by Portugal in recent years to guarantee the rights of investors have made it recognized worldwide as a competitive and reliable business and investment destination. Likewise, this nation has a set of incentives for investment and national and local tax benefits.\n\nModern infrastructure\n\nThe Global Competitiveness Ranking Report 2019, prepared by Portugal Statistics and OECD, showed that this nation has a large infrastructure system, with 2,562 KM of railway networks, 6 international ports and 3,122 KM of highways.

Its strong road structure makes it easy for the country to connect with the most important cities through air, sea or land transport.\n\nInternational Trade\n\nAfter its integration with the European Union in 1986, it became one of the main financial centers in Europe and this has allowed it to access a market of 500 million Europeans and more than 250 million Portuguese-speaking consumers. This nation has free trade without customs barriers and free movement of people and goods.\n\nSkilled workforce\n\nAccording to data from IMD World Talent Report 2019, the Portuguese workforce ranks eleventh and has a high degree of university education in the business and services areas, they are multilingual, dynamic, flexible and have an efficient labor cost compared to other countries in Western Europe.\n\nCutting-edge technology\n\nPortugal is one of the main countries with the greatest availability of technological services.

Himself, the MD World study Talent Report 2019 tells that the nation ranks 11th in the development of communication technologies.\n\nStable economic structure\n\nPortugal's economic structure is diverse and maintains promising growth in different branches of the service sector. The reforms implemented by the government Portuguese have reduced labor costs, modernized their infrastructures, optimized investments, which has made many multinationals choose Portugal as one of the countries where it is more profitable to do business. Traditional activities in its industrial area have evolved and facilitated economic growth in new sectors with greater technological influence, such as pharmaceuticals, energy, electronics, tourism and automobiles. Likewise, the Portugal 2020 Plan has been launched, which includes various sectoral incentives for foreign investment through tax benefits, to promote the growth of the country's productivity.\n\nFree zone\n\nThanks to Portugal has its own free zone, there are several companies that can settle and enjoy different legal tax benefits at various levels.
