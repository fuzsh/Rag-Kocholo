It is basically a country located in the southwestern Europe on Iberian Peninsula. It is mainland Europe‚Äôs westernmost sovereign state that is being bordered by Spain to the east and north, Atlantic Ocean to the south and west. Territory of Portugal also includes Azores and Madeira‚Äôs Atlantic archipelagos. However, both of these are autonomous regions containing their own governments. The National and official language of this country is Portuguese.\n\nHistorical background of Portugal:\n\nPortugal is known to be one of the oldest nation states on Iberian Peninsula and in Europe as well. Since prehistoric times, its territory has been settled, fought and invaded continuously. The territory is also inhabited by Celtic and pre-Celtic people, visited by Ancient Greeks, Phoenicians-Carthaginians, and even ruled by the Romans followed by the Visigothic Germanic and Suebi peoples‚Äô invasions. After Iberian Peninsula‚Äôs conquest by Muslims, a major part of Portugal‚Äôs territory became Al-Andalus.\n\nHowever, as a country Portugal was founded in 868, and established in early Christian Reconquista. However, it gained prominence in 1128 after S√£o Mamede‚Äôs battle.\n\nThe Portugal kingdom was proclaimed following Ourique‚Äôs battle in 1139, while gaining independence in 1143 from Le√≥n.\n\nDuring the 15th and 16th century the first commercial empire and global maritime was established in Portugal. That makes it one of the prominent economic, military and political powers.\n\nDuring this period, it was known to be ‚ÄúAge of Discovery‚Äù, with pioneered maritime exploration by Portuguese explorers, with discovery of what became Brazil in 1500. In the same period, the country also monopolized spice trade that divided the world into dominion with Castile‚Äôs hemispheres and expanded its military campaigns in Asian regions. However, the prior opulence of Portugal was erased by the events such as the country's occupation during Napoleonic Wars, Lisbon earthquake, and Brazil‚Äôs independence. After the deposition of monarchy in the 1910 revolution, the first republic of Portugal was established. But later the Estado Novo authoritarian regime superseded that. Democracy here was restored in 1974 after the Carnation Revolution that ended the Colonial War of Portuguese. After that independence was granted to overseas territories. Macau's handover to China ended what could be considered as the longest-lived colonial empire in 1999.\n\nPortugal at present:\n\nPortugal has a profound influence on its culture, linguistic and architecture globally, with its legacy of various Portuguese-based creoles and 250 million speakers (Portuguese). It is known to be a developed country with high living standards and advanced economy. However, it is ranked in different aspects for following ranks.\n\n2nd for moral freedom\n\n3rd for peacefulness\n\n7th for democracy\n\n10th for press freedom\n\n15th for stability\n\n18th for social progress\n\n26th for prosperity\n\nPortugal is also a member of:\n\nThe European Union\n\nThe United Nations\n\nThe Council of Europe\n\nThe Schengen Area\n\nIt was a founding member of:\n\nPortuguese Language Countries‚Äô Community\n\nThe OECD\n\nNATO\n\nThe eurozone\n\nCities in Portugal\n\nHere is the list of cities located in Portugal. However, in Portugal city is known to be an honorific term that is being used to give locations meeting specific criteria including:\n\nGood infrastructure including medical care centers, schools, sports and cultural facilities.\n\nMinimum number of habitants.\n\nAny major historical importance.\n\nThe 1980‚Äôs demographic expansion of the country prompted various towns‚Äô elevation to the status of city. However, as of 2018, about 159 locations are being considered as cities in Portugal. A city is not an administrative division in Portugal; therefore, it does not correspond to a municipality here generally. However, this comes up with an exception of completely urban municipalities including Porto, Lisbon, Entroncamento, S√£o Jo√£o da Madeira, and Amadora. Paredes Municipality is the most cities‚Äô municipality, which contains four cities.\n\nUntil 1910, a city was proclaimed by a Royal charter, which has happened about 25 times to present cities of Portugal. The Royal Charters were granted to the Portuguese Empire‚Äôs cities such as S√£o Paulo in 1711.\n\nHowever, during the first Republic of Portuguese, this process was shifted to the parliament, which raised three locations to the city‚Äôs category. The dictatorial Estado Novo command declared 7 more cities on the Portuguese mainland and more in the colonies as well, but by government decree this time.\n\nAfter the Carnation Revolution in 19 74, declaration of the cities to the parliament and now Portugal is containing 156 cities. While, one of the major consequences here was the title of ‚ÄúCity‚Äù is no longer having the prestige that it once had.\n\nSince the time when Portugal became an independent kingdom in 1128, 8 locations have always been considered as cities. These locations are including:\n\nBraga\n\nLamego\n\nCoimbra\n\nPorto\n\nViseu\n\n√âvora\n\nSilves\n\nLisbon\n\nGuarda is the very first city that was proclaimed in 1911 as a part of independent Portuguese kingdom. However, the most recent cities of Portugal are including:\n\nAlbergaria-a-Velha\n\nLagoa (Azores)\n\nAlfena\n\nS√£o Pedro do Sul\n\nBorba\n\nValen√ßa\n\nSamora Correia\n\nSenhora da Hora\n\nWhile on the other hand, when it comes to the most populated cities of Portugal then these are the following:\n\nLisboa / Lisbon\n\nVila Nova de Gaia\n\nPorto\n\nBraga\n\nQueluz\n\nCoimbra\n\nAmadora\n\nAgualva-Cac√©m\n\nSet√∫bal\n\nAlmada\n\nViseu\n\nRio Tinto\n\nAveiro\n\nPonta Delgada\n\nPortim√£o\n\nFaro\n\n√âvora\n\nBarreiro\n\nGuimar√£es\n\nLeiria\n\nOdivelas\n\nKnowing these facts have certainly given you pretty enough knowledge about Portugal.\n\nData Sources"
