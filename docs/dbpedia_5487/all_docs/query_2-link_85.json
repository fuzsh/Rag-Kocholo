If you have time, why not create a vision board for each phase of your life plan?\n\nPeople who use vision boards usually place them where they’ll see them often.

You don’t need to overthink the process. Engage with your creativity to build your dream board. Your vision board is totally personal to you, so don’t worry about defending yourself or impressing anyone.\n\nTo create a physical vision board that you can hang anywhere in your home or office, try following these steps:\n\nTake some time to clarify your vision and intention\n\nGather your materials, like images and art supplies\n\nFind images and words that represent your vision\n\nArrange your materials\n\nPlace your vision board where you’ll see it often\n\nLet’s break down each of these steps of the process.\n\n1. Take time to clarify your vision\n\nA vision board requires you to reflect on your desires and aspirations. Before starting your vision board work, clarify your goals. What do you want to manifest with your vision board?\n\nGet as clear as you can about your personal vision. Don’t rush this step, as it's the foundation for your entire vision board. You will find that you get even more clarity and detail as you create the board.\n\nAvoid distractions while thinking about your vision. It’s important to maintain self-awareness as you clarify things. You can start journaling as a brain dump and a way to gain clarity about your life.\n\n2. Decide on a medium\n\nThere are several mediums you can choose from when creating a vision board. Here are some popular options:\n\nPhysical board\n\nFoam board\n\nPoster board or cardboard\n\nWooden board or canvas\n\nA wire board\n\nA whiteboard\n\nA magnetic board for your fridge\n\nCork board\n\nHowever, your vision board doesn’t have to be a literal board like a poster board.

Your images can come from a variety of sources, including:\n\nOld magazines and catalogs\n\nDigital images\n\nPhotos from your personal collection\n\nPostcards\n\nStickers, sketches, and other elements\n\nAdhesive tools\n\nIf using a physical base, you’ll need something to secure your items to it. Pins and clips work well. You can also use glue sticks or tape. If you’re making a magnetic board, you’ll need small magnets to secure each image.\n\nHere are some common adhesive tools that can be useful when creating a physical vision board:\n\nGlue sticks: These are great for adhering lighter items like printed images, words cut from magazines, and lightweight paper items to your board surface. Look for acid-free, photo-safe glue sticks.\n\nRubber cement: This thick, re-positionable adhesive allows you to temporarily mount heavier items like fabric scraps or three-dimensional objects, and adjust positioning before it dries permanently.\n\nFoam adhesive squares: These double-sided adhesive foam squares create dimension by raising images and objects slightly off the board surface.\n\nWashi tape: This decorative, gentle masking tape can adhere light items while also adding splashes of color and pattern to your design.\n\nStraight pins or thumbtacks: For using a corkboard or foam board surface, pins allow you to easily rearrange images and elements as desired.\n\nHot glue gun: A hot glue gun provides strong, Quick-drying adhesive for permanently mounting bulkier three-dimensional items securely.\n\nAdhesive putty or poster putty: This reusable adhesive allows you to temporarily mount images and objects, making rearranging easy.\n\nHaving different adhesive options gives you flexibility in incorporating various materials and creating textured, multi-dimensional effects on your vision board.\n\nAdditional crafting tools\n\nFinally, you’ll need a variety of crafting tools, such as pens, markers, paint, stickers, or anything else you want to use to embellish your vision board. You can use as little or as much of these materials as you desire.\n\nScissors: a good pair of sharp scissors will allow you to precisely cut out images, quotes, and shapes from magazines, photos, fabric, etc.\n\nPaper trimmer/paper cutter: this tool gives you a straight, clean edge when trimming paper elements.\n\nHole punch: use different sized hole punches to create patterns, borders, or to punch holes for stringing items together.\n\nStencils: alphabet stencils let you add motivating words and phrases. Shape stencils allow you to trace and cut out designs.\n\nMarkers/pens: colorful markers and metallic gel pens are great for writing affirmations and doodling decorative elements.\n\nStamps/ink pads: rubber stamps with inspiring words or symbols can add visual interest when stamped repeatedly.\n\nStickers: motivational quote stickers, puffy alphabet stickers, or themed decorative stickers coordinate nicely.\n\nRibbons/trims: incorporate different textured ribbons, frayed fabric strips, lace or other fiber embellishments.\n\n4. Find images and words that represent your vision\n\nOnce you’ve gathered your materials, it’s time to add images and other details to display on your board. Photos and images are the most popular media to use on a vision board. The type of images you use will depend on the focus of your vision board.\n\nHere are some ideas for images to add to your vision board:\n\nImages of graduation caps or degrees\n\nImages of sports trophies\n\nImages of vacation destinations\n\nImages of things representing dream jobs, like an image of ocean animals for marine biology\n\nIn addition to images, you can find inspiring quotes to add to your vision board.

Positive and negative self-talk has been found to impact athletic performance. Research has also found self-talk impacts brain functional connectivity in cognitive tasks.\n\n5. Arrange and place your materials\n\nNow, it’s time to arrange everything you’ve prepared on your vision board. Lay out magazine images from your collection, writing utensils, and anything else you plan on using.\n\nYou have endless options when laying out your images. Here are some ideas to inspire your creativity:\n\nHere are some tips for arranging images in an effective and visually appealing vision board:\n\nLayout\n\nUse a grid or section off your board into categories like career, relationships, health, travel etc. This creates a nice flow. Alternatively, you can arrange images more randomly for an artistic, free-flowing look. Or you can start with a central image that represents a key aspect of your vision. You can build outwards from there, grouping related items. Remember to leave some blank space – too many images can feel cluttered.\n\nPrioritization\n\nPlace your most important, inspiring images in the center or at eye-level to draw focus. Arrange secondary images around the perimeter or in the corners. Use larger images/fonts for top goals and smaller ones for supporting visuals.\n\nColor Scheme\n\nCreate a cohesive color palette, even if eclectic, to provide visual harmony. Use contrasting hues or a background color to make images pop.\n\nTextures & Layers\n\nInclude fabrics, quotes on colored paper, stamps etc. to add tactile interest. Overlap and layer images in a visually appealing way.\n\nThe most effective vision boards are those that excite you and keep your eyes moving across all your motivating images and words. Have fun with this step. Get inspired by the momentum and play with different layout options until it feels right. This arranging process is part of developing a clearer, more detailed vision for the future.\n\nWhen you’re happy with the layout, secure everything in place with your chosen binding. Take time to make sure you’re happy with your design. If you’re using pins or clips, it’s easy to change things around as you go. But if you’re gluing or taping your materials, it’ll be much more difficult to change your mind afterward.\n\n6. Place your vision board where you'll see it often\n\nIt’s finally time to place your vision board. A key part of your vision board’s value is looking to it for continued inspiration. When it comes to placement, choose a location where you can access it daily.\n\nYou can try placing your vision board in one of the following locations:\n\nYour fridge\n\nAn empty wall in your kitchen\n\nAn altar\n\nA mirror\n\nYour nightstand\n\nIn your work-from-home office\n\nThe back of your front door\n\nAcross from your bed\n\nNo matter where you place your board, be sure to check it regularly. Looking at your board is essential to remembering why you created it to manifest your dreams.\n\n7. Continually update your vision board\n\nYour vision board should evolve as your goals change. Regularly replace old images with new ones representing your latest dreams. When you achieve a goal, celebrate by moving that image to a \"victory\" board or scrapbook.\n\nContinuously add fresh visuals and words inspiring you toward your next ambitions. These suggestions with help keep your vision board updated to match your ever-growing aspirations.\n\nBacked by science: why do vision boards work?\n\nIn a 2024 study, researchers at the Journal of Research in Personality found that visions inspire and create positive emotions. They create positivity because they make you believe your dreams are within reach. By putting your goals on something you see daily, you can focus on what matters.\n\nVision boards are just one type of visualization technique. Such techniques work by cementing an image in your mind until you believe it’s possible.\n\nFinding images and words that inspire you can increase your motivation to create an ideal life. Inspirational tools like vision boards can be powerful for making your dreams a reality. By reminding yourself of your life goals on a daily basis, you can start being more intentional.
