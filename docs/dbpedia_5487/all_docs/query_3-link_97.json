Not only do I take the name of them extremely seriously, but I take the time to curate the perfect cover image that's depictive of the vibe, mood, and aesthetic of the songs within.\n\nBULBFISH's new customizable cassette tape designs are calling my Spotify account's name. Inspired by Soviet Union cassette tapes from the 70-80s, the pack comes with 3 Photoshop mockups that offer customization possibilities: think realistic torn stickers.\n\nWhile cassette tapes might be a thing of the past, BULBFISH is making sure that the grit and pure loveliness of these tapes never lose their magic, even if it's just digitally. Now excuse me, I have some Spotify playlist cover art to make.\n\nThis project is inspired by the design of Soviet Union cassette tapes from the 70-80s. The pack contains 3 high quality .psd mockups with a lot of customization options and authentic vintage feeling. You can apply your design to the cassette label and cover (J-card), change cassette and case color, control highlights and shadows, use any background.\n\nProject Credits"
