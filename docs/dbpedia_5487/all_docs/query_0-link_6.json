Lawrence.\n\nLast revised 12 May 2020.\n\nNo copyright is asserted for NASA photographs. If a recognizable person appears in a photo, use for commercial purposes may infringe a right of privacy or publicity. Photos may not be used to state or imply the endorsement by NASA or by any NASA employee of a commercial product, process or service, or used in any other manner that might mislead. Accordingly, it is requested that if a NASA photograph is used in advertising and other commercial promotion, layout and copy be submitted to NASA prior to release.\n\nNASA photos reproduced from this archive should include photo credit to \"NASA\" or \"National Aeronautics and Space Administration\" and should include scanning credit to the appropriate individuals or agencies as noted in the captions.\n\nMany of the scans of photos taken during the missions were done from the original film. These scans are being done by NASA Johnson, with some post-processing by Kipp Teague. The film is scanned at 4096 x 4096 pixels per image. (See a discussion from Arizona State University about the scanning process.) Kipp reduced each digital image to approximately 2350 x 2350 pixels (equivalent to 300 dpi) and did minor adjustments of levels to ensure that (1) brightly lit areas of lunar soil were neutral grey, (2) objects with known colors (such as the CDR stripes or the LCRU blankets) looked right, and (3) information in bright or dark areas was not lost. These images from original film are indicated by the notation 'OF300' in the image description. In each case, a 900 x 900 pixel version is also provided.\n\nAnaglyphs in the image libraries created from sequential panorama frames by the ALSJ editor exist only because of Yuri Krasilnikov's willingness to teach me the art. Whatever value the anaglyphs have is due to Yuri's insights and guidance. Flaws are my doing. Briefly, panorama stitching freeware Hugin is used to create both non-stereo pan assemblies and remapped versions of the images. The latter are then made into anaglyphs using GIMP. The individual remapped images are linked from the corresponding Library entries for the original frames. The remapped images can be used to create stereo views using other methods.\n\nFor those interested in the subject of Apollo Photography and the Color of the Moon, see a brief discussion written for the ALSJ by Michael Light.\n\nThis Apollo 11 Image Library contains all of the pictures taken on the lunar surface by the astronauts together with pictures from pre-flight training and pictures of equipment and the flight hardware. High-resolution version of all the lunar surface images are included. A source for both thumbnail and low -resolution versions of the lunar surface images is a website compiled by Paul Spudis and colleagues at the Lunar and Planetary Institute in Houston.\n\nDescriptions of the cameras, film and general contents of the various magazines used during Apollo 11 can be found in National Space Science Data Center Report NSSDC 70-06, Apollo 11 Lunar Photography, issued April 1970.\n\nJournal Contributor Paul White has made detailed comparisons of cloud patterns seen in a large number of Apollo images with imagery taken at close to the same time by various meteorlogical satellites.\n\nSections:\n\nLunar Reconnaissance Orbiter Camera Images\n\nLanding Site Maps/Images\n\nAssembled Panoramas\n\nPre-Flight Suit Images\n\nCrew and Equipment Pre-Flight\n\nVehicle Assembly, Transport, and Checkout on the Launch Pad\n\nSaturn V Launch\n\nMission Support Photos\n\nMission Photos by Magazine Number\n\nMagazine 36/N (Color) Translunar Coast and Lunar Orbit\n\nMagazine 37/R (Color) Lunar Orbit and Lunar Surface out LM Windows\n\nMagazine 38/O (Color) Lunar Farside\n\nMagazine 39/Q (B & W) Lunar Surface out LM Windows\n\nMagazine 40/S (Color) Lunar Surface\n\nMagazine 41/P (B & W) Lunar Orbit\n\nMagazine 42/U (B & W) Lunar Orbit\n\nMagazine 43/T (B & W) Lunar Orbit\n\nMagazine 44/V (Color) Lunar Orbit\n\nMagazine 45/W (Color) Apollo Lunar Surface Close-up Camera\n\nRecovery and Post-Flight Photos\n\nMission Report Figures\n\nPreliminary Science Report Figures\n\nLunar Reconnaissance Orbiter Camera Images\n\nOriginal LROC image courtesy NASA/GSFC/ASU.

Each frame has been converted to a common scale and has been deconvolved and enhanced. The WMV film begins with a presentation of the frames in the order which they were taken. The next section presents the frames in order of solar elevation, beginning with local sunrise and ending with sunset. The third sequence is ordered by solar elevation and shows as area of about 600 x 360 meters, centered on the LM. The sequence shows changes in the appearance of the LM, terrain features, astronaut tracks, rocks, and deployed equipment under different lighting conditions. The sequence also shows bright objects well away from the LM which, because each persists over two or more consecutive images, are almost certainly pieces of Mylar blown off the descent stage during LM liftoff. The final sequence, GoneToPlaid writes, \"is a repeat of the previous sequence, but with only a one-sixth-second delay before transitioning to the next image. This helps the sequence flow smoothly from start to finish. It also provides a stronger visual effect where the viewer can clearly see the top of the LM descent stage shifting left and right, relative to the footpads, due to the changing perspective from which the LRO viewed the AP11 landing site.\"\n\n12 July 2009 First Pass 01:08:01 UTC; Solar El/Az 10.2/270.2; LRO Altitude 113 km. (2.8 Mb)\n\nA detail enlarged by a factor of three shows the LRRR and PSEP as bright spots roughly 21 and 27 meters, respectively, south of the LM. At higher sun angles, an LRRR cover is visible about 3.5 meters east of the LRRR location. The raw LROC file is M102000149R. The landing site lat/long is 0.67N/23.47E. The LRO spacecraft was at 0.47N/24.21E.\n\nDeconvolved, 0.50 m/pixel (4.7 Mb TIF) and 1.0 m/pixel (4.9 Mb TIF) versions by GoneToPlaid.\n\n12 July 2009 Next Orbit 05:06:36 UTC; Solar El/Az 8.2/270.2; LRO Altitude 113 km. (0.6 Mb)\n\nThe landing site lat/long is 0.67N/23.47E. The LRO spacecraft was at 0.53N/22.22E. The longitude difference produced noticable east-west foreshortening. In a 3x-enlarged detail, neither the LRRR, LRRR cover, nor the PSEP are immediately obvious. Labeled versions and a link to the raw file (nacr00000ada) are available at the LROC website.

(0.8 Mb)\n\nThis is our first look at Neil's path to Little West Crater, starting from close to LRRR where he retrieved the ALSCC (Close-up Camera) from a rock where he had set it down. A 3x-enlarged detail shows the LM, LRRR, PSEP. Labeled versions and a link to the raw file (M104362199R) are available at the LROC website. The landing site lat/long is 0.67N/23.47E. The LRO spacecraft was at 0.83N/23.93E.\n\nOn 14 January 2009, five months before LRO was launched, Journal Contributor Scott Cruickshank made use of AS11-40-5961, the last of Neil's photos taken from the rim of Little West Crater, and AS11-40-5962, which he took on the way back to the LM, to correct errors in existing maps of the routes Neil took to and from Little West. Cruickshank's result is very similar to the routes revealed by LROC images.\n\nDeconvolved, 0.50 m/pixel (4.0 Mb TIF) and 1.0 m/pixel (4.0 Mb TIF) versions by GoneToPlaid.\n\n04 September 2009 16:18:27 UTC; Solar El/Az 62.7/266.3; LRO altitude 122.49 km.

The LRO spacecraft was at 0.62N/23.92E. What may be a piece of mylar blown off the descent stage during ascent stage liftoff is also labelled. The LRRR cover can be seen in its final position in a detail ( 0.2 Mb ) from AS11-37-5548, one of the pictures Neil took out his window after the EVA. A labelled drawing of the PSEP includes dimenions provided by Allan Needell of the National Air and Space Museum. The solar panels face east and west and are oriented 20 degrees off vertical.

Because Brian's triangulation method lacks the detail and precision of Vlad's photogrammetric analysis, location errors are larger, but not enough so to keep the map from capturing the essential features of the EVA. Brian's method lends itself to improved mapping of the individual geology stops made by later crews.\n\nApollo 11 Planimetric Map, Preliminary Science Report Figure 3-15 (0.1 Mb)\n\nThe text that accompanies the map indicates \"Because the graphical method by which these data have been obtained is fairly crude, azimuths shown for individual frames may have errors of 3° or more. Positions of most of the camera stations are probably within a 1.5-m circle centered at the point shown. The determinations are sufficiently accurate, however, to provide a useful control net for an overall view of the astronauts' traverse and a starting point for more rigorous analytical photogrammetric measurements.\"\n\nApollo 11 Traverse Map, Defense Mapping Agency ( 0.7 Mb )\n\nThis 1978 site map is a product of a long collaboration between the Defence Mapping Agency and the US Geological Survey. It was originally drawn at a scale of 1:250. Compare with Preliminary Science Report Figure 3-15, above.

AMIE obtained the image on 5 February 2006 from a distance of 1764 kilometers from the surface, with a ground resolution of 159 meters per pixel. The imaged area is centered at a longitude of 23.9 degrees East close to the Moon equator, at 1.7 degrees latitude. The area is close to crater Moltke (outside the field of view of this image) in the Mare Tranquillitatis. The arrow shows the landing site of Apollo 11, where the first men from Earth set foot on another object in our solar system on 20 July 1969. The two prominent craters nearby are named after two of the Apollo 11 astronauts. The first man on the Moon, Armstrong, has a crater named after him outside the field of this image.

The eventual Apollo 11 site is in area IIP-6.\n\nApollo Zone of Interest ( 2.1Mb or 0.4Mb)\n\nThis later map shows five regions, each of which contains one of the five possible Apollo Landing Sites considered for the first landing. These sites were numbered, from east to west, ALS-1 to ALS-5. The eventual Apollo 11 landing site is ALS-2 and is within region IIP-6. Don Wilhelms's book, To a Rocky Moon, contains a wealth of information about site selection. Data from the first three Lunar Orbiter missions are discussed in pages 150-161; and selection of the Apollo 11 site is discussed in pages 188-191.\n\nApollo Landing Site 2: Flown Apollo 10 Map ( 140k )\n\nThis flown map shows the proposed landing ellipse and has three hand-drawn, rough ovals in the southwestern quadrant, possibly areas examined by the Apollo 10 crew in one or more passes over the site. Ulli Lotzmann provides a version with the actual Apollo 11 landing site marked ( 90k ).\n\nLunar Orbiter Frame 2084 ( 1.3 Mb )\n\nLunar Orbiter II frame 2084 from the Lunar and Planetary Institute's Lunar orbiter Photo Gallery, with an arrow added to indicate West Crater.\n\nLunar Orbiter Frame 5076 ( 4.4 Mb )\n\nLunar Orbiter II frame 5076 from the USGS Astrogeology Research Program's Lunar Orbiter Digitization Project. Eric Nelson has marked the location of the LM and Little West Crater.\n\nLunar Orbiter Frame 5076 (cropped) ( 84k )\n\nJim Scotti has provided a cropped version showing West Crater and the landing site. René and Jonathan Cantin have created a film of the Apollo 11 Final Approach ( 10 Mb, wmv ) that is a side-by-side composite of the landing film and LO 5076_h3, with a number of craters matched up in the two views.\n\nLunar Orbiter compared to LROC ( 25 Mb WMV )\n\nGoneToPlaid has produced an animated comparison between deconvolved/enhanced versions of Lunar Orbiter image 5076_H3 and LROC image M116161085R. The two views have similar lighting.\n\nSelene/Kaguya Image of Tranquility Base ( 183k )\n\nThis image was taken on 26 December 2007 with the multi-band imager on-board Japan's lunar orbiting spacecraft. North is at the top. The image was provided from the Japanese language version of the Kaguya Image Gallery by ALSJ Contributor Hiroyasu Hayashi. A labeled version shows both Cat's Paw and West Crater. Eagle landed just west of West Crater in an area which, in this Kaguya image, is relatively bright. High-resolution photographs of the Apollo 15, Apollo 16, and Apollo 17 landing sites taken with the Pan Camera flown in the Service Module's Sim Bay on each of those missions show a bright area around each of the LMs, with the lighter albedo probably due to sweeping of the surface by the descent engine. Journal Contributor Markus Mehring has produced a high-contrast version of the Kaguya image and compares it with the same area of pre-landing photo AS11-37-5447 ( 0.1 Mb ). Markus has also produced a high-contrast version of the image with the Eagle's ground track superimposed ( 0.3 Mb ), demonstrating that the light-colored area is around the LM. The ground track comes from Figure 5-8 in the Apollo 11 Mission Report ( 13 Mb PDF ). Although it is tempting to believe that the bright area seen in the Kaguya image is due to the LM exhaust, it is possible that differences in lighting conditions may be the cause. Higher-resolution imagery will be required before the question can be decided.\n\nApollo 11 Ground Track mapped onto LROC overlay in Google Moon (5 Mb)\n\nThis map shows the ground track during the last 3 minutes 30 seconds of the descent. Each point is marked with the time remaining (mm:ss) until the landing. Many are labeled to indicate transmission from the crew.

The longitude range is 32.5 E to 24.5 E. The original map scale is 1:630,000. The named feature at the upper left is probably \"Chuck Hole\". The feature to the right of the ground track just below \"8+00\" is \"Last Ridge\". The feature above and to the left of \"Cape Bruce\" near the bottom of the scan is \"Ruin Basin\".

Scan courtesy of Stephen Tellier, Lunar and Planetary Institute, Houston.\n\nDescent Flight Path ( 0.6 Mb or 32 Mb )\n\nThomas Schwagmeier has assembled the Descent Monitoring chart and has used it as a template for lunar maps from the Lunar and Planetary Institute website.\n\nFlown CMP Map LAM-2 ( 2.7 Mb or 0.3 Mb )\n\nMike Collins used this map to mark the estimated LM locations given to him by Houston. Compare with the sextant locations plotted in Figure 5-14 (below) from the Mission Report. The grid spacing is 1 km and the actual landing site is near J.65 and 7.52. Scan courtesy Bob Craddock and Allan Needell, National Air and Space Museum.\n\nThe landing ellipse is centered at map coordinates L.0/14.0 and extends north and south 2.4 km from that point and 9.4 km east and west. Mike Collins marked a number of locations with combinations of lines, arrows, circles, and one ellipse using either pencil or a felt-tipped pen. Most of these are associated with estimated LM locations that were given to him at various times during his solo operations in lunar orbit.\n\nBeginning at the upper left, there is a penciled ellipse labeled 'Auto Optics' and including craters at N.7/7.2 and M.0/6.7 that Mike mentions at 106:43:08. Owen Garriott gave Mike settings for Auto Optics operation of the sextant at 105:19:59; and, at 106:11:49, about 35 minutes before Mike's next pass over the landing site, Bruce McCandless told him \"We'd like you to let the Auto optics take care of the tracking and devote your energies to trying to pick out the LM (visually) on the lunar surface.\"\n\nThe 'Auto Optics' ellipse also contains a small circle at L.7/6.6 and attached arrow from the southwest drawn with a felt-tipped pen. I have not been able to associate this circle with anything in the transcript or in Figure 5-14 (below) from the Apollo 11 Mission Report.\n\nImmediately to the right of the upper end of the 'Auto Optics' ellipse, Mike has drawn circle, probably around the 'tiny crater' at M.7/8.0 that he mentions at 104:42:48.\n\nBelow the 'Auto Optics' ellipse, a penciled arrow leads to a circle drawn at K.8/6.3. At 112:22:20, Mike requested an estimated LM position for his pass over the landing site at 112:31:52. Bruce McCandless gave him K.9/6.3 and, as can be seen in Figure 5-14 (below), the actual landing site is just outside the sextant field-of-view for this location.\n\nBelow and to the right, an arrow drawn with a felt-tipped pen and labeled 'Last Bst Pos Prior L/O' leads to a dark spot at J.5/7.7, which is the estimated location Ron Evans gave Mike at 123:55:23, about a half hour before LM lift off. This location is only about 230 meters from the actual landing site at J.65/7.52. Farther down the map, Mike circled craters at E.3/7.6 and E.8/7.7 and to the left of the E.3/7.6 crater wrote 'SW Rim'. These two craters are in the area he examined during the pass over the landing site at 110:33:40 using the sextant in automatic mode and a set of coordinates Bruce McCandless gave him at 110:18:39. Mike reported the negative results at 110:36:58 but mentioned a \"suspiciously-small, white object\" on the southwest rim of the E.3/7.6 crater.\n\nFinally, there is a small, blue dot at about K.2/5.6, which may not have been purposefully drawn.\n\nMap LAM-2G ( 356k )\n\nApollo 11 Landing Site: Mission Report Figure 5-8 ( 347k\n\nThis labeled version of 1:5000 LM Lunar Surface Map LSE 2-48 shows the ground track and the landing site about 60 meters west of Little West Crater. The grid squares are 50 meters on a side.\n\nMap LSE 2-48 ( 2.7 Mb or 371k )\n\nCompare with Mission Report Figure 5-8 (above) for the Eagle ground track and the location of the landing site. In a detail ( 750 ), I have marked what is probably a boulder just east of West Crater. The grid squares on this 1:5000 map are 50 meters on a side and the north-south size of the boulder is about 1-2 meters and close to the resolution limit.\n\nSextant Locations ( 1.6 Mb or 0.4 Mb )\n\nThis is figure 5-14 from the Apollo 11 Mission Report and shows the various estimates of the landing location given to MIke Collins while Armstrong and Aldrin were on the surface. Each of the small squares is 1 kilometer on a side and the circles, which represent the approximate sextant field-of-view, are each about 3.2 km (2 miles) in diameter.\n\nLanding Site Detail ( 151k )\n\nA comparison of details from Figure 5-8 from the Apollo 11 Mission Report (top) and from the flown copy of LAM-2 (bottom). The latter includes the horizontal 'J' and 'K' lines and the vertical '7' and '8' lines. The resulting box is one kilometer on a side. The actual landing site is near J.65/7.52, sixty meters west of Little West Crater, and the last estimated position given to Mike about half an hour prior to LM lift-off is marked with a felt-tipped pen at J.5/7.7.\n\nPost-Flight Map with Named Features ( 312k )\n\nPhil Stooke, Department of Geography, University of Western Ontario discovered this \"untitled, post-flight, Manned Spacecraft Center graphic in the library of the Lunar and Planetary Institute in Houston.\n\nAS11-37-5437 Map ( 0.3 Mb )\n\nThis richly-labeled map of the approach to Tranquility Base was created by Markus Mehring. See, also, figure 1-20a ( 0.8 Mb or 0.1 Mb ) from the Apollo 11 Preliminary Science Report.

Australia is near the western limb, as can also be seen in a Celestia image generated for that time with an observer 2000 km from the center of the Moon at lat / long 0.0 / 80 E. Animated gif by Paul White.\n\n104:02:26 Post-landing Color Combined Window Pan ( 279k )\n\nThese frames were taken out the windows about an hour and half after the landing, and form a contingency panorama in order to briefly document the site, so that the crew wouldn't have left with empty hands in case of a No-Stay decision. Assembled by Karl Dodenhoff before high-resolution scans from the original film became available.\n\nFrames AS11-37-5449 to 5453 form a CDR (left) window pan ( 151k ); and frames AS11-37-5454 to 5458 form an LMP (right) window pan ( 123k ).\n\n104:02:26 Post-landing Color Combined Window Pan - High Resolution ( 4.9Mb or 1.2Mb )\n\nThis assembly uses high-resolution scans (OF300) from the original film. The frames are those used in the individual left- and right-window pans that follow, except that \"AS11-37-5451 was removed from the final mix to improve rendering around the area of the top of the LM shadow.\" . Assembled by Syd Buxton.\n\n104:02:26 Post-landing Color CDR (left) Window Pan - High Resolution ( 4.8Mb or 0.8Mb )\n\nThis assembly uses high-reolution scans (OF300) from the original film. The frames are AS11-37-5449 to 5453, plus 37-5459, 40-5847 and 40-5848. \"Post-EVA frames 37-5497 and 37-5500 were used to help with alignment and to fill in some small gaps.\" Assembled by Syd Buxton.\n\n104:02:26 Post-landing Color LMP (right) Window Pan - High Resolution ( 4.8Mb or 0.4Mb )\n\nThis assembly uses high-reolution scans (OF300) from the original film.

Assembled by Syd Buxton.\n\nPre-EVA Double Crater Pan ( 548k )\n\nDavid Harland as used high-resolution scans of AS11-40-5847 and 5848 by Kipp Teague to create a mini-pan showing the double crater below Neil's window.\n\n109:32:26 Pan 1 ( 0.9 Mb or 0.2 Mb )\n\nNeil took this pan near the bottom of the ladder while he was waiting for Buzz to start out thru the hatch. The frames are AS11-40-5850 to 5858. Pan assembly by Dave Byrne. Thumbnails by Joe O'Dea.\n\nFull-resolution assembly with derived anaglyphs ( 5.3 Mb ) by Eric Jones.\n\nDavid Harland has used 5852 to 5854 to create a mini-pan of the double crater ( 2.0Mb ) below Neil's window; and frames 5855 to 5857 to create a mini-pan ( 1.7Mb ) showing the view to the northwest.\n\n109:32:26 Ladder Mini-Pan ( 42k )\n\nAfter finishing his initial pan, Neil moved 3.9 meters north of the ladder and took three frames toward the south. The frames are AS11-40-5859 to 5861. The locations are indicated in a detail from Vlad Pustynski's photogrammetric map of the site. The three AS11-40 photo numbers are underlined in red and a red highlight has been added to each of the direction arrows.

He also took two frames, AS11-40-5864 and 65 of the area under the descent stage. Dave Byrne has used 5863, 64, and 65 to create this view of Buzz on the porch. Thumbnails by Joe O'Dea.\n\n109:39:43 Buzz on the Footpad ( 1.8 Mb or 198k )\n\nJon Hancock has used 5864, 65, and 5869 to create this view of Buzz on the footpad. Jon writes, \"I think Neil changed position between 5864/65 and 5869, so the perspective changed slightly; but, by rotating 5969 to correct the horizon and enlarging it a few percent to get the scale to match the other two, they fit together quite well (at least I think so!)\". Dave Byrne has created an alternate version ( 469k ) and, with the addition of 5863, a view with Buzz both on the porch and on the footpad ( 559k ). A third version ( 2.1Mb ) has been provided by David Harland.\n\n110:31:47 Pan 2 ( 1.4Mb or 0.3Mb)\n\nBuzz took this pan from due west of the ladder, on the rim of Double Crater.

Additional assembly by Erik van Meijgaarden version (8.5Mb or 361k)\n\n112:20:56 Post EVA Window Pan (300k)\n\nNeil and Buzz used up the remaining film on magazines 37/R, taking AS11-37-5460 to 5555, and 39/Q, taking AS11-39-5792 to 5839. Bob Farwell has selected frames from Magazine 37/R to create a pan covering both windows.\n\nA second version is presented on a white background.\n\nNote that Farwell's construction involves a certain amount of artistic license because neither Neil or Buzz actually had an unrestricted view from side to side, as shown by pans assembled from Magazine 39/Q images for the CDR window and the LMP window.\n\nNext, Farwell added a frame from the 16-mm DAC mounted in Buzz's window, showing Neil and Buzz erecting the flag.\n\nAn additional version, the 16-mm DAC frame is partially transparent, showing the residual differences caused by the fact that the DAC is mounted over the window and is aimed at a steeper angle than that of the Hasselblad.\n\nFinally, Farwell has modified Figure 10.12 from the Lunar Sourcebook to provided a rough comparison with the assembled pan. Farwell has provided a fuller discussion of the assembled pan and related items.\n\n112:20:56 Post-EVA Right Window Pan ( 159k )\n\nThese are frames AS11-37-5510 to 5517, taken out Buzz's window.

The fresh, sharp-rimmed crater beyond and just to the right of the TV camera has been identified in the 8 August 2009 LRO image ( 0.2 Mb of the landing site and is also visible in an anaglyph ( 280k ) made by Yuri Krasilnikov from frames AS11-40-5855 and 56 from Pan 1. The TV camera is about 20 m from Buzz, while the fresh crater is about 70 m away. See, also, a labeled version of the pan and a similarly labelled, animated gif made from the three 2009 LROC images, both by Vlad Pustynski.

Note that the sewn-on cuff checklist can be seen on the wrist cover of Buzz's left glove, the one closest to the right suit leg. Note, also, that Buzz is not going to wear a strap-on pocket. See, also, AS11-40-5903. Ken Glover believes that the grey square at the upper right, just below the bubble helmet, is a photographer's grey card; it is certainly not an EMU component. The pattern of Velcro strips and snaps surrounding the connector cluster provided for installation of what seems to have been called an \"umbilical cover\". There is considerable evidence that the Apollo 11-14 LM crew members' suits all had a similar pattern of Velcro and snaps but, as of June 2007, we have been unable to locate any indication - in photos, checklists, and EMU handbooks - of an umbilical cover having been flown. Karl Dodenhoff has provided a photograph, but doesn't remember where he found it.\n\nScan by Eric Jones.\n\nS69-38937 ( 0.2 Mb or 4.5 Mb )\n\nThis pre-flight photo shows Buzz's left glove, including the sewn-on checklist.

Scan by Eric Jones.\n\nS69-38889 ( 168k or 812k )\n\nThis pre-flight photo shows Neil's suit in its lunar surface configuration, which includes the Liquid Cooled Garment at the left and the EVA (Extra-vehicular) gloves and moon boots at the right. Mike Gentry at NASA Johnson gives a date for the photo of 9 July 1969, but this may represent the date when the photo was released to the public and that the date it was taken was earlier. Research by Frederic Artner.\n\nThe suit is shown with a strap-on pocket attached to the left thigh, as was the case during the EVA. In a detail from S69-38889 ( 166k ), we see some horizontal strips of Velcro hooks on the outside of the top flap which, on later missions, mated with horizontal strips of Velcro pile on the suit to hold the flap open. In the detail, we see that a loop of Velcro has been added been attached to the flap and a corresponding strip of Velcro has been attached over the front of the left hip. Further details of a typical strap-on pocket can be found in an Apollo 16 discussion. The suit shown in that discussion is Charlie Duke's training suit, which had horizontal strips of Velcro pile just above the knee, because Charlie wore his strap-on pockets on his shins.\n\nUlli Lotzmann notes that the card placed between the boots that reads \"PGA 076\" is wrong. The actual serial number of Neil's PGA is 056. The mistake is undoubtedly due to the fact that the serial number of Neil's suit 'liner assembly' is 076. The person who created the card probably saw the serial number of the liner and thought that was the number for the entire PGA as well. Bill Ayrey (ILC) has provided \"the fit-check record from the day that Neil was initially fitted into his 056 suit. It was on December 5, 1968 at 5 PM (which was on a Thursday). Mel Case was the ILC engineer performing the fit check. Neil came back to ILC on Saturday, May 3, 1969 for his final fit-check in the 056 suit.\"\n\nJournal Contributor Roland Suhr notes that there isn't a mission patch on the suit. Photos S69-38489 to 38517, taken during an EMU Crew and Cabin Fit-and-Function (CCFF) session on 25 June 1969, also show the flight suits without mission patches. Clearly, the patches were put on the suits no earlier than 25 June. On 27 January 2014, ILC Historian Bill Ayrey wrote: \"ILC was responsible for preparing the suits which included sewing the patches on. NASA was responsible for providing the patches which as I recall, they bought from a company named Lion Brothers. (Bill is correct. See Gene Dorr's patch webpage.) Ron Woods was one of our ILC suit technicians at the time and actually suited Buzz up for his Apollo 11 mission. \" On 28 January 2014, Ron Woods told Ayrey \"We were very late on sewing on the Beta (cloth) Flight Patches. Maybe two weeks prior to launch. And, of course, they were top stitched with the sewing machine and then carefully hand sewn through the top layer of the TMG (Thermal-Micrometeoroid Garment).\"\n\nS69-CDR Gloves ( 27k )\n\nThis pre-flight photo shows Neil's EVA (extra-vehicular) gloves.

Amazingly, we've only lost two of the fourteen who survived until July 1969; and I hope at least a few of them are still around when the next footprints are left on the Moon.\"\n\nJournal Contributor Brian Lawrence adds \"One thing I find interesting with photos such as this is who is missing from the photo. Twenty out of the thirty astronauts who had been selected by June 3, 1964 took part in the Philmont Ranch trip.

On the left, a two-position allows a choice of framing rate of either 10 frames per second or 0.625 fps. The latter was never used on the Moon. In January 2010, Mike Dinn initiated what became an extended exchange of e-mail about the 0.625 fpd mode. The discussion ultimately included Dinn, Dick Holl (Bendix/OTC), Colin Mackellar (editor of the HSK website), Dick Nafzger (GSFC), John Sarkissian (Parkes), John Saxon (HSK), Dwight Steven-Boniecki (author of Live TV from the Moon, and Bill Wood (GDS). Early in the exchange, Wood remember that, while he was doing a final edit of the restored telecast combined with the Flight Director's loop, \"I noted Network telling Flight ... that they were ready to handle the super-slow scan rate during the start of Neilâ€™s TV Panorama. To me that indicates they planned to support that mode if needed.\" Nafzger added, \"we had the capability to handle the .625 mode and it was intended to look at rocks, etc. as a basic still shotâ€¦..we did test it and it was fine, but once they started using the 10fps and the worldwide excitement built, Stan (Lebar) said they didnâ€™t want to take any chances switching modes!!! They were afraid that they couldnâ€™t get back to live tv!!\" Holl said, \" I remember testing (the 0.625 fps mode) in our downstairs lab (at Australia's Overseas Telecommunication Commission facility at Paddington in Sydney)) and it worked fine.\" Photo taken at the National Air and Space Museum in August 2004 by Ulrich Lotzmann.\n\nStan Lebar with the five production units that could have gone to the Moon (No photo ID) (66k)\n\n[Scan courtesy Colin Mackellar, who writes that one of the five is on the Moon, one is at the Smithsonian's National Air and Space Museum, and one lives at the National Electronics Museum in Linthicum Heights, Maryland.\n\nS69-16682 ( 102k or 457k )\n\nBuzz Aldrin (left), Neil Armstrong, and Mike Collins pose in business suits following a press conference at the Manned Spacecraft Center, Houston. 10 January 1969.

Both have geology hammers stowed in tool belts. Haise also has what looks like a tape recorder attached to the front of his belt. The leather pouch on Lovell's left hip may also hold a tape recorder. The recorders would capture any descriptions they made of the samples which, after the end of the session, could be discussed with the trainers. 24 February 1969.

Neil has a tape recorder on his belt and a large box scoop in his left hand. Note that the extension handle attached to the top of the scoop shaft is not symmetric. Note, also, that neither the scoop shaft nor the extension handle shaft have knurled sections for better gripping, as was the case of the flown items.\n\nThe fact that Buzz is taking a handheld photo may be an indication that the idea of using a bracket on the RCU had not yet emerged. The camera handle appears to be attached to a lanyard, which also suggests that the RCU camera bracket is still in the future. Buzz has a hammer holder on his belt over his right hip and has a weigh bag hooked to his right, front pocket. Inside the weigh bags, we see the telltale shape of at least one closure tab on an individual sample bag. As can be seen in photo S69-25202, Buzz has a pack of individual sample bags attached to weigh bag. The pack of sample bags is badly out-of-focus but, in S69-25903, an identical pack is clearly visible attached to Jack Swigert's weigh bag. 24 February 1969.
