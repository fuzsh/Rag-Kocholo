        "text": "In 1987 I began my academic activities as a film researcher and documentary filmmaker. Since 2003 I have been researching the subject of stereoscopic film (S3D [1] ), as much from a technological point of view and from the point of view of the audiovisual language. The interest in documentary films led the author to experiment with various techniques of stereoscopic filming, as well as analyze various documentary films in both 2D and S3D. The S3D film technology that uses two synchronized cameras has been competing with technology that uses a single camera with two lenses and two sensors. The heavy weight and large size of the two-camera technology complicates the mobility and agility of the documentary film language. This paper intends to investigate theoretical issues related to the use of these technologies in filming S3D documentaries and its immersive function. The current stage of the two-camera technology implies a setback in the film methods that have been enhanced from the ..."
