Here’s a quick summary of the main points.\n\nAGV stands for “automated guided vehicle” and AMR stands for “autonomous mobile robot”\n\nAGVs are automated material handling equipment that follows predefined paths with limited ability to make real-time corrections to its course\n\nAMRs are automated material handling equipment that use digital maps or sensors to navigate its environment, while being able to make real-time course correction\n\nThe main types of AGVs include carts, tuggers, forklifts, unit-load, and heavy haul\n\nThe main types of AMRs include those used for picking, inventory management, and sortation\n\nAGVs are best used in applications where processes and movements change very little\n\nAMRs are best used in dynamic applications where multiple types of tasks need to be automated\n\nBoth technologies can help operations improve productivity, reduce damage, boost inventory control, cut costs, and improve safety\n\nAGVs: An Overview\n\nWhat Is An AGV?\n\nFirst of all, AGV stands for “automated guided vehicle.”\n\nAnd they are a type of unmanned guided vehicle (UGV) used to automate repetitive tasks, such as hauling raw materials in production facilities.\n\nThe defining characteristic of AGVs is that they travel on predefined paths using automation software for instructions.\n\nBut, they cannot make real-time corrections to their course.\n\nWhen Were AGVs Invented?\n\nAGVs have been around since the 1950s.\n\nThe credit for their invention goes to Arthur Barrett, whose company Barrett Electronics created the “Guide-O-Matic” driverless vehicle in 1954.\n\nThese early AGVs were modeled on trains and were usually used to pull carts.\n\nIn the 1970s, the “Stop & Drop” AGV came along, which could automatically handle and unload pallets.\n\nFrom the 1980s onward, much of AGV development has been focused on improving navigational and fuel systems.\n\nWhat Can An AGV Do?\n\nAGVs are commonly used for transport.\n\nThat includes moving raw materials used in production or transferring work-in-progress materials between lines and workstations.\n\nThey are also used for picking and storage activities.\n\nFor example, warehouses may use AGVs to move inbound materials to storage or retrieve storage items needed to replenish stock.\n\nWhat Are the Types of AGVs?\n\nOne thing that unites all AGVs is that they’re all wheeled vehicles.\n\nThat said, they do come in several varieties.\n\nThe 5 main types of AGVs are:\n\nCarts\n\nTuggers\n\nForklifts\n\nUnit-load\n\nHeavy-haul\n\nLet’s go through each.\n\nCart AGVs\n\nThese are the simplest AGV material handling machines.\n\nIn essence, they’re low-profile carts with a storage structure mounted on top containing various materials or items.\n\nThe AGV cart moves around the facility and stops where the materials are needed.\n\nYou can find this type of AGV in automotive and E-commerce operations.\n\nTugger AGVs\n\nIf you’re wondering “what is an example of an AGV?”, the most common one you’ll see is the AGV tugger.\n\nThese are used to pull non-powered carts with loads up to 50,000 lbs.\n\nFor example, they’re often used to automatically transport heavy machine components, assemblies, and equipment.\n\nBasically, anything that’s too dangerous or difficult to transport manually.\n\nForklift AGVs\n\nForklifts can come as – or be converted into – automated guided vehicles.\n\nThey’re used to automatically move and stack products like paper rolls, coils, and even vehicles.\n\nSome examples of forklift AGVs include automated pallet jacks, sit-down counterbalance lift trucks, reach trucks, and narrow aisle equipment.\n\nUnit-Load AGVs\n\nThese are individual vehicles automated to transport single products, such as a pallet or a bin containing products.\n\nIn a typical application, a unit-load AGV will stop where it needs to be loaded (from an AS/RS system, for example), then move to another spot where the products or materials are needed.\n\nThis type of AGV is commonly used in the food and beverage industries.\n\nHeavy-Haul AGVs\n\nHeavy-haul AGVs are the most robust type, featuring sturdy bases, durable wheels, and large platforms, and built to handle up to 250,000 lbs.\n\nThey’re used in industries that handle heavy materials, like construction, aviation, and shipbuilding.\n\nOften, they’re custom-designed to fit the application.\n\nWhere Are AGVs Used?\n\nAGVs work best in applications where operations are fixed and well-defined.\n\nFor example, a factory AGV tugger may be used to move raw materials to replenish stock so a production line can operate uninterrupted.\n\nAGVs work well in this application because the process is repetitive and has little variation.\n\nOther industries that use AGVs include:\n\nWarehouses and distribution centers\n\nGeneral manufacturing\n\nAutomotive\n\nFood and beverage processing\n\nHealthcare and pharmaceuticals\n\nPackaging, paper, and printing\n\nAerospace\n\nIndustrial horticulture\n\nMail and newspaper\n\nAMRs: An Overview\n\nWhat Is An AMR Vehicle?\n\nFirst off, what does AMR stand for?\n\nAMR stands for “autonomous mobile robot.”\n\nLike AGVs, AMRs are a type of unmanned guided vehicle (UGV).\n\nWhat makes them different from AGVs is that AMRs are not limited to a specific route.\n\nInstead, they can make navigational decisions in real-time without the need for human intervention.\n\nWhen Were AMRs Invented?\n\nThe origins of AMRs can be traced to William Grey Walter.\n\nHe developed the first AMR between the late 1940s and early 1950s.\n\nFrom its conception, it was designed to be used as an assistant in medical research laboratories.\n\nTo serve in this capacity, the AMR used light, touch, and sound sensors to detect its environment and make decisions based on the data it received.\n\nAMRs didn’t successfully enter into commercial use until the early 1990s, with the creation of the “HelpMate” robot.\n\nThis AMR was used in hospitals to assist staff with activities like serving food trays, delivering mail, and transporting lab results.\n\nNowadays, AMR technology has advanced, with improvements in sensors, guidance software, and safety systems.\n\nWhat Can An AMR Do?\n\nMost AMR transport systems are designed to move, load, retrieve, sort, pick, or even stack cases, totes, or carts.\n\nAn example of how an AMR might function in a warehouse is as follows:\n\nRobotic arms, conveyors, or human workers load the AMR with products or materials\n\nThe AMR then automatically moves to its next destination\n\nThere, it deposits its load onto chutes, conveyors, shelving, flow racks, or workstations\n\nAll the while, the AMR is continuously updated with information about its surroundings and even inventory changes.\n\nIt uses this information to calculate each of its subsequent tasks – along with the shortest route to get to each.\n\nWhat Are the Types of AMRs?\n\nThere are many different AMR designs and models.\n\nBut, they can be classified into one of 3 groups, based on the types of tasks that they perform:\n\nPicking and putting\n\nInventory management\n\nSortation\n\nLet’s briefly cover each.\n\nPicking or Putting AMRs\n\nManual order picking is time-consuming.\n\nIn fact, it can account for up to 75% of the order fulfillment process.\n\nBy automating these tasks with AMRs, operations can save time, cut costs, and increase productivity.\n\nHow does an AMR picking assistant work?\n\nThe AMR does exactly what a human order picker does.\n\nNamely, traveling between storage and workstations and picking and placing items needed for production, assembly, or shipping.\n\nThus, they eliminate the need for humans to do the same tasks so they can focus on other value-added activities.\n\nInventory Management AMRs\n\nInstead of humans walking around and manually checking inventory, AMRs can automatically do it.\n\nFor instance, an aerial AMR can track SKUs in real-time using RFID technology and integration with a warehouse management system (WMS).\n\nThen, another AMR can be alerted to replenish low stock.\n\nBesides freeing workers from manually-checking inventory, AMR inventory assistants can help managers identify storage areas used inefficiently.\n\nSortation AMRs\n\nThese AMRs direct goods and materials to their next stop.\n\nHere’s an example of how the process could work:\n\nA sortation assist AMR has a tray on top of it\n\nEither workers or robotic arms place an item on the tray\n\nThe AMR uses a camera to identify the item and where it belongs\n\nThen, it calculates the shortest path to take\n\nFinally, the AMR stops at the designated area, tilts its top, and lets the item slide off and down a chute\n\nWhere Are AMRs Used?\n\nAMR technology works best in dynamic environments.\n\nThat’s because they can respond to changes in tasks and navigation in real-time, unlike AGVs.\n\nAdditionally, they’re adept at handling operations with lots of different SKUs and where collaborating with human workers is important.\n\nThis makes them perfect for person-to-goods and goods-to-person logistics operations.\n\nSpecific AMR applications include:\n\nHospitals\n\nAirports\n\nWarehouses, particularly e-commerce\n\nHazardous environments, like fire, nuclear, and military\n\n8 Differences Between AMRs and AGVs\n\nSometimes folks – and even manufacturers – use the terms AMR and AGV interchangeably.\n\nBut there are key differences between the two technologies.\n\nLet’s go through those differences.\n\nNavigation\n\nThe best way to explain the difference in navigation between an AGV and an AMR is by comparing them to a train and a car.\n\nTrains can only run on rails, of course.\n\nThat makes them like AGVs, as they can only follow a predefined path.\n\nCars, on the other hand, can go pretty much wherever they want.\n\nIn that way, AMRs are more like cars (self-driving cars, more specifically).\n\nAMRs don’t need to stick to a predefined path.\n\nRather, they can navigate between nearly any 2 points while also recalculating and adjusting their route on the fly, such as when there’s dense traffic or obstructions.\n\nBut, there’s a bit more to know about AGV and AMR navigation methods.\n\nSo let’s dive into each.\n\nAGV Navigation\n\nThe main fact to know about AGV navigation is that they use onboard sensors and infrastructure cues to navigate.\n\nAdditionally, they are pre-programmed to turn, accelerate, and decelerate on their own.\n\nAnd while they can detect obstacles, they cannot maneuver around them.\n\nInstead, the AGV will simply stop when it encounters an obstacle but won’t move until the obstacle is physically removed.\n\nHow Does AGV Navigation Work?\n\nWondering “How do automated guided vehicles work?” or “What guides an AGV?”\n\nAnswer: Either a wire guidance system or optical sensors.\n\nAGV Wire Guidance\n\nAn AGV wire guidance system consists of a wire embedded beneath the floor and sensors on the AGV.\n\nThe embedded wire emits electrical signals.\n\nAnd the AGV’s sensors detect the signals to determine where the path is and how to follow it.\n\nThe main drawback of this method is that it’s expensive to install, as it requires digging up the floor to bury the wire.\n\nNot only may the installation be costly, but it can also cause costly disruption to your operation through downtime.\n\nAGV Optical Guidance\n\nIn comparison, an AGV optical guidance system uses a variety of environmental cues, such as reflective markers, magnetic strips, or QR barcodes, along with lasers or cameras on the AGV.\n\nThe sensors on the AGV detect the cues and use them to determine its location and direction.\n\nThe advantage of optical guidance over wire guidance is that you don’t have to do structural work like digging up the floor and burying a wire underneath it.\n\nInstead, you use adhesives or common mounting methods to install the environmental cues.\n\nAMR Navigation\n\nInstead of using physical cues embedded or installed in the infrastructure, AMRs use sensors and software to understand their environment.\n\nThese sensors and detectors can include:\n\n3D depth cameras\n\nLIDAR technology\n\nLaser scanners\n\nSimultaneous Location and Mapping (SLAM) technology\n\nThe sensors identify both static and dynamic elements in your environment, like pallet racking, people, and other equipment.\n\nThen, the sensors feed the data to the AMR’s software.\n\nThe software then does a multitude of things, including identifying obstacles, calculating routes, and tracking inventory changes.\n\nWhat Is SLAM Technology?\n\nSLAM stands for “Simultaneous Location and Mapping,” and it’s a guidance method sometimes used in AMRs that uses algorithms to localize and map environments.\n\nA SLAM system uses cameras and sensors to create a map of the vehicle’s surroundings (called “mapping”).\n\nIt also uses information from the vehicle’s monitoring systems, such as how many revolutions the wheels make, to determine exactly how far to move (called “localization”).\n\nHow Does AMR Navigation Work?\n\nThere are 2 main methods for AMR navigation.\n\nMethod 1: Geo-Guidance\n\nThis system is similar to a car GPS with preloaded routes.\n\nTo navigate, the AMR uses a map of the facility instead of sensors embedded in the environment.\n\nIn using a map, the AMR can determine its place in the environment and find its way around automatically.\n\nThe advantage of geo-guidance is that you can quickly and easily modify the map according to changes in your working environment.\n\nMethod 2: Laser Guidance\n\nIn this guidance method, the AMR uses lasers to scan and detect its environment without the use of a map.\n\nOverall, this is a new but reliable navigational technology, is accurate and easy to use, and makes the AMR completely autonomous.\n\nThe downside, however, is that the AMR can get lost in wide-open spaces where it can’t readily recognize its surroundings.\n\nThis will shut the unit down and require the intervention of a human worker.\n\nData Collection & Intelligence\n\nAMRs are smarter and have more robust data collection abilities than AGVs.\n\nIn particular, they provide much more information to facility managers, such as data on KPIs.\n\nLet’s go through the differences between AMR and AGV intelligence in more detail.\n\nAMR Data Collection & Intelligence\n\nAMR robotics use Wi-Fi and cloud-based technologies for data collection and storage.\n\nThis allows them to collect lots of information for a variety of purposes, such as:\n\nUpdating the facility map with new parameters that it learns during operation\n\nTracking individual SKUs\n\nCoordinating tasks between other equipment\n\nMoreover, AMRs can easily integrate with warehouse management systems (WMS) or warehouse execution systems (WES) to manage the entire order fulfillment process.\n\nAGV Data Collection & Intelligence\n\nAGVs do not collect nearly as much data as AMRs.\n\nThus, they don’t offer as great insight into your operation.\n\nAGVs can, however, work with technologies like WMS or WES systems – though perhaps not as easily as AMRs in some cases.\n\nBut more than anything, AGVs simply do the work they’re assigned and not much else.\n\nSafety\n\nIn general, AMRs are safer than AGVs.\n\nHere’s why…\n\nAMR Safety\n\nAMRs have a much more robust ability to identify and avoid objects in their environment, including people, infrastructure, and other equipment.\n\nThis makes them suitable for working closely with humans – whether in transit or acting as personal assistants.\n\nAdditionally, AMRs usually have warning lights and sound systems, which can alert workers to their presence so they can avoid them.\n\nAGV Safety\n\nAGVs can recognize obstructions – like a worker walking in its path – and stop before striking them.\n\nAnd like AMRs, they can also be equipped with warning systems to alert workers to their location.\n\nThat said, it is generally safer for employees to work around AGVs rather than for AGVs to work around employees.\n\nFor instance, employees should be instructed to avoid walking along the magnetic tape that guides AGVs.\n\nLoad Handling\n\nAGVs tend to have more robust load-handling capabilities.\n\nLet’s explain why.\n\nAGV Load Handling\n\nFirst, AGVs can move both horizontally and vertically, like a forklift.\n\nThis allows them to be used for handling pallet-sized loads.\n\nSo, if you need to retrieve pallets from warehouse racking, an AGV may be your best bet.\n\nSecondly, AGVs can handle much more weight than AMRs.\n\nIn fact, some models can handle up to 250,000 lbs.!\n\nAMR Load Handling\n\nLike AGVs, some AMRs can be used both horizontally (i.e. transporting goods across the floor) and vertically (i.e. placing goods in shelving or racking).\n\nBut, they have much less weight-handling capacity.\n\nHow much weight can an AMR handle?\n\nMost AMRs only handle up to 500 lbs., but the maximum is about 2,600 lbs.\n\nSetup\n\nAGVs are more expensive to set up than AMRs.\n\nHere’s why:\n\nAGV Setup\n\nAGVs require infrastructure modification such as installing magnetic tape, burying wire, or adhering barcodes to the floor.\n\nThis not only costs money to set up and the services of a specialist engineer, but it may also be costly in production downtime.\n\nAMR Setup\n\nUnlike AGVs, AMRs require no modifications to a facility’s physical infrastructure.\n\nThat is, there’s no need for wires, magnetic strips, or any other modifications.\n\nThat makes AMRs easy and quick to deploy.\n\nPlus, implementing them causes very little disruption to your operations.\n\nCosts\n\nAMRs generally are more expensive than AGVs.\n\nLet’s discuss why and how much each costs.\n\nAMR Costs\n\nAMRs handle a lot more information and execute more complex tasks than AGVs.\n\nThus, they require more complicated software, which makes them more expensive.\n\nMoreover, AMR costs are tied to their size and load capacity.\n\nThe larger or more complex they are physically, the more money they cost.\n\nBut in the long run, AMRs are cheaper than AGVs.\n\nWhy?\n\nThe biggest reason is that you don’t need to modify and maintain your infrastructure for them to navigate.\n\nHow Much Does an AMR Cost?\n\nA small AMR may cost $25,000 to $40,000.\n\nFor example, an AMR using the SLAM navigation method can cause between $25,000 and $30,000.\n\nAGV Costs\n\nWhile having a lower initial cost than AMRs, AGVs do require the installation of physical guides, surface tape, or under-floor wiring.\n\nBesides installation, it’s important to consider other costs such as setup, deployment, reconfiguration, and operation costs.\n\nOne way to help ease the capital burden is by leveraging leasing options.\n\nAnother option is to use a Robots-as-a-Service (RaaS) model with a monthly subscription.\n\nAs far as return on investment, AGVs take longer than AMRs – usually 1+ years.\n\nHow Must Does an Automated Guided Vehicle Cost?\n\nAGV prices start at around $15,000 (for models that navigate using magnetic tape).\n\nFor example, an AGV tow tractor may cost around $30,000, while an AGV pallet jack can cost $60,000.\n\nHow Much Does an Automated Forklift Cost?\n\nAn automated forklift can cost between $50,000 to $75,000\n\nBy comparison, normal forklifts typically cost between $20,000 and $50,000.\n\nMaintenance\n\nAGVs cost more in maintenance than AMRs do.\n\nLet’s cover everything you need to know about AGV vs. AMR maintenance.\n\nAGV Maintenance\n\nAGV maintenance costs more than AMR maintenance because the physical markers, like magnetic tape and barcodes, are prone to damage from traffic.\n\nSo, you need to maintain them regularly to avoid rendering the AGV useless.\n\nAMR Maintenance\n\nConversely, there’s virtually no infrastructure required for AMRs to operate.\n\nThus, there’s not much to maintain beyond the normal maintenance items required of both AGVs and AMRs.\n\nThat includes lubricating moving parts, replacing worn parts, etc.\n\nVersatility & Scalability\n\nThe advantage of scalability goes to AMRs.\n\nLet’s explain why that is, compared to AGVs.\n\nAMR Versatility & Scalability\n\nAMRs are a better choice when there are changes in operations or production workflows.\n\nThat’s because you can quickly add a new facility layout (geo-guidance) or allow the unit itself to map the area (laser-guidance).\n\nAdditionally, AMRs can adjust to new tasks on the fly.\n\nSo, workers don’t have to spend much time coordinating AMR activity, which allows them to focus on other tasks.\n\nAnd when it comes to scaling your operations, AMRs are much easier to expand than AGVs.\n\nFor one, you can deploy AMR fleets in a modular fashion, which allows you to conserve initial capital until you gain proof of concept\n\nFor another, you can easily add more AMRs without the need to outsource the installation to 3rd party vendors for changes or additional implementation.\n\nAfter all, they don’t require infrastructure renovations, facility replanning, or additional training of employees.\n\nAGV Versatility & Scalability\n\nIf you need to adjust the path or tasks for an AGV, you’ll need to install new environmental cues like magnetic tape or underground wire guidance systems.\n\nAnd it’s the same thing if you want to add additional AGV units to your workflow.\n\nThis means a lot more is involved – in both costs and disruptions – than for AMRs.\n\n5 Benefits of AGVs and AMRs\n\nThere are some definite benefits to using either AGVs or AMRs, or even a combination of both.\n\nThe following are some of the key ones.\n\nImproved Productivity\n\nBoth autonomous systems help minimize travel time, provide for more efficient scheduling of deliveries, and help reduce bottlenecks.\n\nAMRs, in particular, help reduce labor by assisting human workers with tasks such as inventory management, picking, putting, and transporting goods.\n\nThese benefits help to allow employees to use their time to focus on higher-value activities.\n\nReduced Damage\n\nWith both AGVs and AMRs, their speed, motion, and movement are carefully controlled.\n\nEach uses an array of sensors, which makes them less likely to collide with people, equipment, and infrastructure.\n\nPlus, they reduce the chances of product damage, which helps preserve your bottom line.\n\nBetter Inventory Control\n\nEven though AGVs lack some of the more robust inventory management capabilities of AMRs, they both can help you get and keep a good grip on inventory.\n\nFor one, they help minimize errors associated with humans performing the same tasks.\n\nTwo, their movements are constantly tracked and controlled, which affords greater inventory accuracy.\n\nAnd three, both technologies can integrate with warehouse automation and warehouse management systems (WMS) to track inventory levels.\n\nCost Savings\n\nAGVs and AMRs can both work nonstop, unlike human beings.\n\nThus, they help cut costs by reducing reliance on expensive and hard-to-source labor.\n\nThis means fewer costs in the form of wages, benefits, training, and insurance.\n\nAnd compared to traditional fixed automated systems, like conveyors and sortation devices, AMRs and AGVs have lower initial costs, take up less space, and take less time to implement.\n\nIn fact, AMRs can get up and running in as few as a couple of weeks, whereas conveyor systems may take a year or more before they’re ready to work.\n\nFinally, AGVs and AMRs can operate in dark environments, unlike humans.\n\nSo, you can help reduce your utility bills.\n\nBetter Safety\n\nHuman workers get fatigued, make mistakes, are prone to injury, and get distracted.\n\nAMRs and AGVs help improve safety by removing the human factor.\n\nFor instance, each technology can help reduce worker injuries associated with physical tasks like picking up heavy items.\n\nHow to Choose Between an AGV and AMR\n\nLet’s go through 3 important factors you should consider.\n\nWhat Kind of Loads Do You Handle?\n\nAMRs are less accommodating to larger loads than AGVs are.\n\nSo, if you need to handle large (500+ lbs.) loads or pallets, you may want to consider an AGV.\n\nAnother consideration is the types of movements you’ll need to make.\n\nFor example, will you need to load pallets into pallet racking?\n\nIf that’s the case, you may also want to consider an AGV.\n\nAfter all, AGVs tend to have more robust weightlifting capacities (though AMRs are catching up!).\n\nHow Dynamic Is Your Operation?\n\nRecall that AMRs are ideal for more dynamic work environments.\n\nThat’s because they can respond and adjust their activities and movements in real-time based on changes detected in the environment.\n\nSo, if your operation is constantly changing, such as is the case with airports, hospitals, etc., AMRs may be a better fit.\n\nOn the other hand, if your operations are fixed, it may be better to consider an AGV.\n\nFor instance, say you’re in a manufacturing facility with fixed storage areas and production lines.\n\nIn that case, you may not have much variance in what needs to be done:\n\nMaterials must be moved from a fixed storage spot to a fixed production line, finished products moved to staging, and so on.\n\nAGVs work well in this context, while also sparing you the higher upfront cost that comes with AMRs.\n\nWhat Is Your Business’s Growth Outlook?\n\nPiggy-backing off the last consideration, think about how you expect your operations to grow.\n\nIf you’re in E-commerce warehousing, you can obviously expect some growth.\n\nIn those cases, AMRs tend to be easier to acquire and implement than AGVs.\n\nOn the other hand, if you expect fairly steady and predictable growth, AGVs may be a more financially-sound and effective solution.\n\nThere’s a lot that goes into choosing between an AGV and AMR.\n\nWe recommend reaching out to experienced professionals when trying to make a decision.\n\nConclusion\n\nThat’s it: The differences between AGVs vs. AMRs."
