        "text": "Credit Cards vs. Debit Cards: An Overview\n\nCredit cards and debit cards typically look almost identical, with 16-digit card numbers, expiration dates, magnetic strips, and EMV chips. Both can make it easy and convenient to make purchases in stores or online, with one key difference. Debit cards allow you to spend money by drawing on funds you have deposited at the bank. Credit cards allow you to borrow money from the card issuer up to a certain limit to purchase items or withdraw cash.\n\nYou probably have at least one credit card and one debit card in your wallet. The convenience and protection that they offer are hard to beat, but they have important differences that could substantially affect your pocketbook. Here’s how to decide which one to use to meet your spending needs.\n\nWhat Is a Credit Card?\n\nA credit card is a card issued by a financial institution, typically a bank, and it enables the cardholder to borrow funds from that institution. Cardholders agree to pay the money back with interest, according to the institution’s terms. Credit cards are issued in the following variety of categories:\n\nStandard cards simply extend a line of credit to their users for making purchases, balance transfers, and/or cash advances, and they often have no annual fee.\n\nPremium cards offer perks such as concierge services, airport lounge access, special event access, and more, but they usually have higher annual fees.\n\nRewards cards offer cash back, travel points, or other benefits to customers based on how they spend.\n\nBalance transfer cards have low introductory interest rates and fees on balance transfers from another credit card.\n\nSecured credit cards require an initial cash deposit that is held by the issuer as collateral.\n\nCharge cards have no preset spending limit but often don’t allow unpaid balances to carry over from month to month.\n\nCredit card users can reap cash, discounts, travel points, and many other perks unavailable to debit cardholders by using rewards cards. Rewards can be applied on a flat-rate basis or at tiered rates. For example, you might have a card that offers unlimited two miles per dollar on purchases and another that offers three miles per dollar for travel spending, two miles per dollar for dining, and one mile per dollar for everything else. You could then use miles earned to book future travel arrangements.\n\nPros of Using Credit Cards\n\nCredit cards can offer certain advantages over debit cards, though they can also have some downsides. Here’s a closer look at the pros and cons of spending with credit cards.\n\nBuild Credit History\n\nCredit card use is reflected on your credit report. That includes positive history, such as on-time payments and low credit utilization ratios, as well as negative items, such as late payments or delinquencies. Your credit report information is then used to calculate your credit scores. Responsible spenders can raise their scores with a history of expenditures and timely payments, and by keeping their card balances low relative to their card limits.\n\nWarranty and Purchase Protections\n\nSome credit cards also may provide additional warranties or insurance on purchased items that go beyond those that the retailer or brand is offering. For example, if an item bought with a credit card becomes defective after the manufacturer’s warranty has expired, it is worth checking with the credit card company to see if it will provide coverage. Or you may have purchase and price protection built-in to help you either replace items that are stolen or lost, or refund price differences when the item that you purchased is sold elsewhere for less.\n\nFraud Protection\n\nAs long as the customer reports the loss or theft in a timely manner, their maximum liability for purchases made after the card disappeared is $50. The Electronic Fund Transfer Act gives debit card customers the same protection from loss or theft—but only if the customer reports it within 48 hours of discovery. After 48 hours, the card user’s liability rises to $500; after 60 days, there is no limit.\n\nOther Credit Card Advantages\n\nThe Fair Credit Billing Act allows credit card users to dispute unauthorized purchases or purchases of goods that are damaged or lost during shipping. If the item was bought with a debit card, then the charge cannot be reversed unless the merchant is willing to do so. What’s more, debit card theft victims do not get their refund until an investigation has been completed.\n\nThe credit cardholder, on the other hand, is not responsible for the disputed charges; the amount is usually deducted immediately and restored only if the dispute is withdrawn or settled in the merchant’s favor. Though some credit and debit card providers offer zero liability protection to their customers, the law is much more forgiving for credit cardholders.\n\nIf you need to rent a car, many credit cards provide some sort of waiver for collisions. Even if you want to use a debit card, many car rental agencies require customers to provide credit card information as a backup. The only way out for a customer may be allowing the rental agency to put a hold of perhaps a few hundred dollars on a bank account debit card as a form of surety deposit.\n\nCons of Using Credit Cards\n\nThe main drawbacks of using credit cards involve debt, credit score impacts, and cost.\n\nSpending Can Lead to Debt\n\nWhen you make purchases with a credit card, you’re spending the bank’s money, not your own. This money has to be repaid, with interest. At the very least, you’re required to make the minimum payment due each month. Racking up high balances on multiple cards could make it difficult to keep up with monthly payments and strain your budget.\n\nCredit Score Impacts\n\nPaying your bill on time and keeping balances on credit cards low can help your FICO scores. However, misusing credit cards could hurt your credit history if you get into the habit of paying late, max out one or more of your cards, close down older accounts, or apply for new credit too often.\n\nInterest and Fees\n\nBecause a credit card is essentially a short-term loan, you’ll have to pay back what you spend with interest. The interest rate and the fees that the credit company charges are used to calculate your annual percentage rate (APR). The higher the card’s APR, the more it will cost you to carry a balance from month to month.\n\nYou should be aware of whether your card charges an annual fee, a foreign transaction fee, a balance transfer fee, a cash advance fee, a late payment fee, or a returned-payment fee. As a general rule of thumb, the better a credit card’s rewards program is and the more benefits it offers, the higher the annual fee will be.\n\nWhat Is a Debit Card?\n\nA debit card is a payment card that makes payments by deducting money directly from a consumer’s checking account, rather than on loan from a bank or card issuer. Debit cards offer the convenience of credit cards and many of the same consumer protections when issued by major payment processors such as Visa or Mastercard.\n\nThere are two types of debit cards that do not require the customer to have a checking or savings account, in addition to one standard type.\n\nStandard debit cards draw on your bank account.\n\nElectronic benefits transfer (EBT) cards are issued by state and federal agencies to allow qualifying users to use their benefits to make purchases.\n\nPrepaid debit cards give people without access to a bank account a way to make electronic purchases up to the amount that was preloaded onto the card.\n\nFrugal consumers may prefer to use debit cards because there are usually few or no associated fees unless users spend more than they have in their account and incur an overdraft fee. (The no-fee advantage does not hold for prepaid debit cards, which frequently charge activation and usage fees, among other costs.) By contrast, credit cards generally charge annual fees, over-limit fees, late payment fees, and a plethora of other penalties in addition to monthly interest on the card’s outstanding balance.\n\nFurther, your debit card could be an offline card. Offline debit cards are not electronically connected to your account. There will be a lag time between making a purchase and when the funds are taken from your account.\n\nPros of Using Debit Cards\n\nDebit cards can have upsides and downsides, just like credit cards.\n\nAvoid Debt\n\nA debit card draws on money that the user already has, eliminating the danger of racking up debt. People typically spend more when using plastic than if they were paying cash. By using debit cards, impulsive spenders can avoid the temptation of credit and stick to their budget. This can help keep you out of high-interest debt.\n\nFraud Protections\n\nIn the past, credit cards offered far greater fraud protection than debit cards. Some debit cards—particularly those issued by payment processors, such as Visa or Mastercard—are starting to offer more of the protections enjoyed by credit card users.\n\nThe key is reporting fraud or theft as soon as you realize it has occurred. Your liability for fraudulent purchases is determined by the time frame in which it’s reported. Waiting too long to let the bank know that your card has been used for unauthorized purchases could result in you being held responsible for some or all losses.\n\nSince a debit card is linked directly to a bank account, fraudulent purchases can quickly drain an account dry or lead to an overdraft. This cannot occur with credit cards since those are paid back at a later date.\n\nNo Annual Fee\n\nThough many credit cards charge an annual fee, debit cards don’t. There’s also no fee for withdrawing cash using your debit card at your bank’s ATM. Credit cards, on the other hand, can charge a cash advance fee plus a steep interest rate for that convenience. However, you may pay other fees to maintain your checking account.\n\nCons of Using Debit Cards\n\nThe biggest downsides of using debit cards involve the lack of impact on credit scores and the potential fees.\n\nNo Rewards\n\nUnless you have a rewards checking account, you won’t earn any points, miles, or cash back on purchases made with your debit card. Because rewards can save you money, depending on how you redeem them, you could be missing out if you only spend with a debit card.\n\nWon’t Build Credit\n\nBuilding good credit means demonstrating to lenders that you can responsibly repay the money that you borrow. When you’re spending with a debit card linked to your bank account, you don’t have the opportunity to do that, so using a debit card alone won’t help you establish or build a credit history.\n\nFees\n\nThough debit cards don’t have annual fees, you may pay other fees to have a checking account. Those can include monthly maintenance fees, overdraft fees if you overspend from your account, returned-item fees, and foreign ATM fees if you use your debit card at another bank or financial institution’s machine.\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nCredit and debit cards may look alike, but their benefits and drawbacks are very different. If building credit and cashing in rewards is important to you, then credit cards are essential tools for your financial journey. If you prefer to keep a tighter rein on your finances, then a debit card is a better bet. No matter which you choose, make sure that you know the fees associated with each account."
