Whatever value the anaglyphs have is due to Yuri's insights and guidance. Flaws are my doing. Briefly, panorama stitching software Hugin is used to create both non-stereo pan assemblies and remapped versions of the images. The latter are then made into anaglyphs using GIMP. The individual remapped images are linked from the corresponding Library entries for the original frames. The remapped images can be used to create stereo views using other methods.\n\nFor those interested in the subject of Apollo Photography and the Color of the Moon, see a brief discussion written for the ALSJ by Michael Light.\n\nJournal Contributor Paul White has made detailed comparisons of cloud patterns seen in a large number of Apollo images with imagery taken at close to the same time by various meteorlogical satellites.\n\nThis Apollo 17 Image Library contains all of the pictures taken on the lunar surface by the astronauts together with pictures from pre-flight training and pictures of equipment and the flight hardware. High-resolution version of many of the lunar surface images are included. A source for both thumbnail and low -resolution versions of the lunar surface images is a website compiled by Paul Spudis and colleagues at the Lunar and Planetary Institute in Houston.\n\nSections:\n\nLunar Reconnaissance Orbiter Camera Images\n\nLanding Site Maps/Images\n\nAssembled Panoramas\n\nPre-Flight Crew and Equipment\n\nVehicle Assembly, Transport and Pad Checkout\n\nSaturn V Launch\n\nMission Support Images\n\nMission Images by Magazine Number\n\nMagazine 133/J (B&W) EVA-2, Frames 20193-20375\n\nMagazine 134/B (Color) EVA-1, EVA-3, Frames 20376-20532\n\nMagazine 135/G (B&W) EVA-2, Frames 20533-20679\n\nMagazine 136/H (B&W) EVA-1, Frames 20680-20865\n\nMagazine 137/C (Color) EVA-2, Frames 20866-21027\n\nMagazine 138/I (B&W) EVA-2, Frames 21028-21184\n\nMagazine 139/K (B&W) 500mm EVA-3, Rev 62-74, Frames 21185-21350\n\nMagazine 140/E (Color) EVA-3, Frame 21351-21509\n\nMagazine 141/L (B&W) EVA-3, Frames 21510-21668\n\nMagazine 142/M (B&W) EVA-3, Frames 21669-21833\n\nMagazine 143/N (B&W) EVA-3, 21834-21982\n\nMagazine 144/R (B&W) 500mm Post-EVA-1, EVA-2, Frames 21983-22132\n\nMagazine 145/D (Color) EVA-2, Post-EVA-3, Rev. 52, Frames 22133-22288\n\nMagazine 146/F (Color) EVA-3, Frames 22289-22450\n\nMagazine 147/A (Color) Rev12, EVA-1, Frames 22451-22606\n\nMagazine 148/NN (Color) CSM Earth orbit, TLC, Lunar orbit, Frames 22607-22775\n\nMagazine 149/KK (Color) CSM Lunar orbit, Frames 22776-22941\n\nMagazine 150/LL (Color) CSM Lunar orbit, Frames 22942-23105\n\nMagazine 151/OO (Color) CSM Lunar orbit, inc.

Resolution in the raw file is 1.4 m/pixel. Crater names from Figure 5.3 ( 0.7 Mb ) in the Apollo 17 Preliminary Science Report and Sheet SE ( 0.2 Mb ) of the EVA-1 traverse planning map. A link to the raw file, nasr00000d11 , is available at the LROC website.\n\nFirst Look - Stereo View, Lee-Lincoln Scarp on the North Massif ( 0.8 Mb )\n\nCombines LROC images nacl00000adc and nacl00000d11. Vertical exaggeration in the anaglyph is 2-3 times. Hanover Crater is on the lower slopes of the North Massif just east of the Scarp. A detail ( 1.5 Mb ) shows the portion of the Scarp where valley floor meets the foot of the North Massif. Stereo Image released 21 July 2009. NASA/GSFC/Arizona State University.\n\nFirst Look - North Massif Boulder Source Regions ( 0.5 Mb )\n\nLabeled detail from LROC image nacl00000d11 showing the source regions for the Dark Boulder and the Station 6 Split Boulder. Other boulders identified in Jack Schmitt's 500-mm portrait of the Split Boulder source region have the same labelling here.\n\nFirst Look - LRV Shadow Identified ( 0.3Mb)\n\nPhoto AS17-143-21932, which Gene took toward the LM from behind the LRV at the VIP (final parking) site shows that the LM is on the same bearing as a spur on the left side of (Old) Family Mountain. The post-flight, topophotomap (6 Mb) can be used to transfer that bearing line to a detail from LRO image nacl00000d11. A thin shadow, undoubtedly cast by the LRV, is located 128 meters from the LM on an azimuth of 112 degrees (east of north).\n\nSecond Look - LM/ALSEP - 01 October 2009 10:32:01 UTC ( 1 Mb )\n\nThis image was taken from 50 km altitude with the Sun at an elevation of 68.3 degrees and an azimuth of 183.1 degrees. Resolution in the raw file is 0.53 m/pixel. The raw image is M109032389L. Labeled details are available at the LROC website.\n\nSecond Look - EVA-1 Traverse ( 3 Mb )\n\nSecond Look - Turning Point Rock, Dark Boulder, Station 6, Station 7 ( 2 Mb )\n\nAmong the tracks left by the astronauts at Station 6 ( 0.24 Mb ), the most prominent may be the loop Gene started when he was just east of the boulders and moved upslope to take what proved to be a dramatic pan. At Station 7, they parked about 25 meters ENE of the Station 7 boulder. They spent much of their time working at the east face of the boulder. Just before they left, Gene moved upslope of the LRV to take a pan.\n\nSecond Look - North Massif Boulder Source Regions ( 4 Mb )\n\nLabeled detail from LROC image M109032389LE showing the source regions for the Dark Boulder and the Station 6 Split Boulder. Other boulders identified in Jack Schmitt's 500-mm portrait of the Split Boulder source region have the same labelling here.\n\nSecond Look - EVA-1 Traverse, Station 1, EP-7 location, rock noted in 20733 ( 0.4 Mb )\n\nBefore starting the traverse to Station 1, Gene initialized the Rover nav system at the SEP transmitter. The range and bearing at Station 1 were 1.11/346. At the location where they deployed EP-7, the range and bearing were 0.6/339. A large boulder seen in frame AS17-136-20733 from Jack's Station 1 pan is also identified.\n\n21 May 2010 13:00:53 UTC; Solar El/Az 35.3/103.7; LRO altitude 42.5 km; resolution 0.43 m/pixel (width), 0.55 m/pixel (height) ( 2.0 Mb TIFF )\n\nThe image linked immediately above shows almost all the the LROC image, but at low resolution. The raw image is M129086118L. A re-scaled, low-res version (1.6 Mb TIFF) has the number of horizontal pixels reduced by a factor of 0.43/0.55. See, also, a labeled version.\n\nA high-res, re-scaled detail (2.6 Mb TIFF) shows the LM, the ALSEP site, the SEP transmitter and the Rover tracks Gene made to guide deployment of the SEP antenna, and the LRV parked at the VIP site. See, also, a labeled version.\n\nA high-res, re-scaled detail (6.9 Mb TIFF) shows Turning Point Rock, Station 6 Split Boulder, and Station 7. An enhanced, labeled version (1.2 Mb) shows tracks Gene and Jack made while working on the east side of the Station 6 boulder. there are hints of tracks on the east side, but they aren't as prominent. Patrick Vanuyne has created a mosaic of images devoted to Turning Point Rock and the Station 6 boulder, including anaglyphs made from the 21 May 2010 LROC image and M113751661L, which was taken on 25 November 2009.\n\nA high-res, re-scaled detail (0.2 Mb) shows Van Serg Crater while an inset from the Apollo 17 Preliminary Science Report shows the approximate where Gene parked the Rover and where he and Jack sampled and took pans. There are no signs of the tracks they made. These may show up at high solar elevations.\n\n6 September 2011 (release date) deconvolved to 0.25m/pixel (1.0 Mb)\n\nDownloaded from http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/LRO/news/apollo-sites.html\n\nLanding Site Maps/Images\n\nRed-Blue Anaglyph from LROC images ((0.5 MB)\n\nAnaglyph by Patrick Vantuyne.\n\nApollo 17 - The End of an Era\n\nGrumman pre-mission artwork. This vision of the landing site has several problems. In the distance, the mountains on the left side are clearly those of the Apollo 15 site, including such recognizable features as St. George Crater and Silver Spur. The astronaut near the top of the ladder would probably not be climbing up as casually as shown, with only one hand on the porch railing and his body turned. The ALSEP deployment area is depicted as being SSW of the LM rather than being directly west. And, finally, the LM is shown on the edge of a steep decline: graphically spectacular but not a position Gene or the targeting people would have chosen. Scans by J.L. Pickering.\n\nTaurus-Littrow Anaglyph, Apollo 15 Mapping (Metric) Camera Frames 0971 and 0972, Rev 33 ( 0.7 Mb )\n\nVertical view of the landing site from frames AS15-M-0971 and AS15-M-0972. Anaglyph by Yuri Krasilnikov.\n\nThe Valley of Taurus-Littrow\n\nThe image linked here is a portion of Pan Camera frame AS17-2309 showing the South Massif at the upper right and the Sculptured Hills at the lower left. The North Massif is at the bottom right and Henry Crater is the rightmost of the three large craters in a triangular pattern at the foot of the mountain. This orientation is to facilitate comparison with features in the Station 6 high resolution images below. See also the labeled version of this frame. The distance from Station 6 above Henry to the LM is 3.5 km; to Bear Mountain, about 8 km; and to the outcrop noted in 21498 below, about 18 km.

In terms of the mission time, the photo was taken at 116:54:38 -- just seven minutes before Gene and Jack started their watches for the first EVA. John Pfannerstill has scanned three portions of the frame.\n\nIn the central area around the LM, the largest crater is Camelot at the upper left. A labeled version highlights the LM and Poppie. In the area north of the LM, covering the EVA-3 traverse, Henry is the large crater at the foot of the North Massif just above and to the right of the center of the image. In the area west of the LM, covering the EVA-2 traverse, Nansen is at the lower left, Camelot is at the right edge above center, and Shorty is the sharp-rimmed, dark-edged crater at top center, about a Camelot diameter below the top edge of the image. Brian McInall has created a composite from the three details. See, also, a version (0.8 Mb or 0.2 Mb)with the lines-of-sight from Station 6 to Stations 2, 3, and 4 indicated.\n\nNorthern Portion of the Scarp in AS17-2309 (5.0 Mb)\n\nThis detail includes Stations 3, Shorty, Victory, Camelot, and, in the north, Hanover Crater and the nearby portion of the scarp. 1600 dpi scan courtesy of Stephen Tellier at the Lunar and Planetary Institute.\n\nShorty Crater in AS17-2309 (1.6 Mb)\n\nThis 1200 dpi scan shows the area immediately around Shorty. A labeled version ( 1.6 Mb ) highlights the Station 4 boulder and the location on the southeast rim from which Gene took his color pan. The 10-m craters labeled 'a' and 'b' are also shown in a labeled detail ( 240k ) from Gene's pan frame AS17-137-21013.\n\nEVA-3 Gatsby-to-Sherlock Traverse Segment in AS17-2309 (1.5 Mb)\n\nThis labeled detail shows the area traversed between Gatsby and Sherlock during the EVA-3 return to the LM. Gene and Jack stopped on the east of Gatsby to take photos and continued onward at about 168:51:03 and made a sampling stop just north of Sherlock at about 168:59:46. Using the traverse path plotted in Figure 7E (0.8 Mb ) in the USGS Professional Paper, I have indicated the locations of these two stops. I have also indicated a likely candidate for the large piece of subfloor gabbro that Jack asked Gene to drive towards starting at about 168:56:53. The last photo of the boulder Jack took before they drove past at about 168:57:04 is AS17-143-21882.\n\nPost-flight Traverse Map (1.15 Mb)\n\nThis is figure 10.27 from the Lunar Sourcebook, reproduced with permission.\n\nPostflight Traverse Map (496k)\n\nFigure 6 from USGS Professional Paper 1080 The Geologic Investigation of the Taurus-Littrow Valley: Apollo 17 Landing Site gives an overview of the routes taken during the three geology traverses.

PDF document courtesy Kim Poor.\n\nInitial Ascent Map ( 273k )\n\nLM ground track for the first five minutes of the ascent. Scan by Robin Wheeler from Mapping of the Moon by Z.Kopal and R.W. Carder (1974).\n\nApollo 17 16-mm frame taken during Ascent ( 308k )\n\nThis frame was taken just after lift-off with the 16-mm camera mounted in Jack Schmitt's LM window. It is also Figure 4-53 ( 1271k ) in the Apollo 17 Preliminary Science Report where the caption reads, in part \"the irregular dark lines between the LM and the ALSEP instruments are LRV tracks.\" In fact, the leftmost track was made by Jack Schmitt as he carried the ALSEP packages out to the eventual ALSEP site. Scan and labels by Brian McInall.\n\nThe Valley of Taurus-Littrow ( 153k )\n\nThis picture is an enlargement of an image taken from the Apollo 15 Command Module.\n\nTaurus Littrow ( 125k )\n\nThis map of the landing site shows the location of major features and, also, the impact point of the Ascent Stage on the South Massif.\n\nTaurus-Littrow - 22 September 2005 ( 262k )\n\nThis telescopic view of Taurus-Littrow was taken by Ulrich Lotzmann at about 0100 UTC 22 September 2005 from Marburg, Germany. At the landing site, the sun was about 15 degrees above the western horizon at an azimuth of about 266.\n\nTaurus-Littrow - 12 October 2006 ( 184k )\n\nThis telescopic view of Taurus-Littrow was taken by Ulrich Lotzmann at about 0000 UTC 12 October 2006 from Marburg, Germany. At the landing site, the sun was about 25 degrees above the western horizon at an azimuth of about 261 degrees east of north. Bear Mountain is clearly visible in the southcentral part of the valley\n\nTaurus-Littrow - 22 April 2007 ( 224k )\n\nThis telescopic view of Taurus-Littrow was taken by Ulrich Lotzmann at about 2150 UTC 22 April 2007 from Marburg, Germany. At the landing site, the sun was about 6.9 degrees at an azimuth of 91.3 degrees. Bear Mountain is clearly visible in the southcentral part of the valley; (Old) Family Mountain is just outside the western entrance to the valley; and (West) Family Mountain (aka the West Massif) is immediately west of the South Massif. Ken Glover has created a labelled gif animation ( 642k ).\n\nTaurus-Littrow - 1 October 2007 ( 52k )\n\nThis telescopic view of Taurus-Littrow was taken by Danny Ross Lunsford at about 0815 UTC 1 October 2007 from Atlanta, Georgia, USA. At the landing site, the sun was at an elevation of 1.3 degrees nearly due west of the LM on an azimuth of 268.6. North is at the lower left; a rotated version has the Sun at the top. The pre-EVA-1 window pan taken on Jack's side shows the view to the west at about 2156 UTC on 11 December 1972, about two hours after the landing. The LM shadow is pointing at the West Massif (aka (New) Family Mountain). (Old) Family Mountain is next right. The solar elevation and azimuth are 14.3 degrees and 96.2 degrees, respectively. The local horizon to the west is actually the near rim of Camelot Crater which, from the LM locaation is at an elevation of about 2 - 2.5 degrees. Using a composite of adjacent details from LTO 42C2 and 43D1 and making allowances for the curvature of the Moon, viewed from the LM, the summit of the West Massif is at an elevation of about 4.7 degrees on an azimuth of about 279 degrees and the summit of (Old) Family Mountain is at an elevation of about 3.7 degrees on an azimuth of about 293 degrees. Readers should note that, becuase of the flat film plane in the Hasselblads, degrees/cm varies with distance from the center of an image. For an observer at the LM on 1 October 2007, the Sun was apparently behind the left flank of the West Massif. This seems to be consistent with the deep shaodws on the floor of the Valley of Taurus-Littrow in Lundford's telescopic view.\n\nPre-flight Grid Map ( 273k )\n\nThis map shows the area immediately surrounding the target and shows the local coordinate system used during the mission.\n\nGrid lines on this map are separated by 400 meters; that is, the distance from 79 to 81 in the east-west direction and from DJ to DL in the north-south direction is 400 meters. Only every second one of the major grid divisions is shown on this map. In the north-south direction, there is actually a DK coordinate halfway between DJ and DL and, likewise, an east-west 80 coordinate midway between 79 and 81. These major grid divisions - say DJ and DK - are separated by 200 meters. The planned landing site was DM.8/82.2, which is 0.8 x 200 = 160 meters north of DM and 0.2 x 200 = 40 meters east of the 82 coordinate line. The actual landing site is near DN.2/83.3.\n\nPlanned Traverses ( 273k )\n\nPlanned EVA-1 Traverse ( 225k )\n\nPlanned EVA-2 Traverse ( 252k )\n\nPlanned EVA-3 Traverse ( 212k )\n\nPlanning for One-Man LRV Traverses ( 144k )\n\nPlanning for Walking Traverses ( 144k )\n\nTraverse Planning for a Landing 2.7 km South of Target ( 148k )\n\nTraverse Planning for a Landing 2.7 km North of Target ( 145k )\n\nActual Traverses ( 94k )\n\nEVA-1 Contour Map ( 40k )\n\nThis contour map shows the EVA-1 route and the reverse side of the photographic EVA-1 map taken from Apollo 15 photography.\n\nEVA-2 Contour Map ( 175k )\n\nEVA-3 Contour Map ( 199k )\n\nPre-flight Horizons from the Planned Landing Site ( 262k )\n\nPerception and Negotiation of the Scarp and Taurus-Littrow; Bell Laboratories memo which includes expected views of the Scarp from the LM windows and from three points along the EVA-2 traverse toward Hole-in-the-Wall.\n\nAmundsen/Nansen ( 171k )\n\nThis pre-flight map detail shows the area around Nansen Crater near the base of the South Massif. At some point, Jack had named this feature \"Amundsen\" after the Norwegian explorer of the Antarctic and the Northwest Passage. He then decided that Amundsen has enough things named for him and changed the name to \"Nansen\" to honor another great Norwegian explorer.\n\nHole-in-the-Wall from the LM ( 71k )\n\nThis Bellcom representation shows a view toward the base of the South Massif from the planned landing site. It was produced by Bell Labs from data derived from photographs taken from the Apollo 15 Command Module. The main feature of interest is the area labeled the \"Access Region\" where, it was thought, the Rover could be driven up onto the Scarp.

The frames are 21589 to 21598. 165:33:38 Gene's Station 6 Pan ( 140k )\n\nGene took this pan from above the Station 6 Split Boulder just before he and Jack left for their next stop. The frames are AS17-140- 21483 to 21509. Assembly by Chris Wells.\n\nEarlier in the stop, Gene collected a soil sample from the top of the foreground rock and, years later, told artist and Apollo 12 astronaut Alan Bean that he wished he'd written his daughter Tracy's name in the dust. Bean did it for him in a painting and, to some of us, the rock is now known as Tracy's Rock.\n\nDavid Harland has assembled a high-resolution portait of the boulder ( 2.5 Mb ).\n\nChris Wells has assembled a detail shows the sample area and Jack headed back to the Rover with the gnomon.\n\nDavid Nathan has combined 300 DPI scans of 21493 and 21496 into a higher-resolution detail of Jack returning to the Rover with the gnomon.\n\nYuri Krasilnikov has used frames 21491-3 from this pan and frames 22351-3 from Gene's Station 7 pan to create a stereo portrait of the South Massif.\n\n165:44:50 Source Outcrop for Station 6 Boulder ( 4.9 Mb )\n\nBy tracing the boulder track upslope from Station 6, Jack thought this might be the source area. The frames are AS17-139- 21186 to 21193. Assembled by Eric Jones.\n\nA number of boulders in the panorama have been tentatively identified via comparison ( 0.3 Mb ) with AS17-147-22502, a frame from Jack's 4-o'clock pan taken early in EVA-1 at the LM, with the relevant frames from Gene's portrait of the North Massif, taken at the LM late in EVA-2, and with a detail from Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter image nacl00000d11. Boulder 'e' is near the west edge of the track made by the dark boulder. The dark-boulder track is invisible from Station 6 with the Sun low in the east. Boulders at the apparent start, as seen from the LM, of the Station 6 track are those labeled 'i', 'j', and 'k', all on the far right. A portion of the Station 6 boulder track can be seen in an enchanced segment ( 0.6 Mb ) of Jack's mini-pan. With the Sun low in the east, the wall of the track facing the Sun is slightly brighter than the opposite wall. A marked version ( 0.6 Mb )gives a sense of the track location, with the center line and margins indicated along two segments. Boulder 'e' is near the west edge of the track made by the dark boulder.\n\n165:50:01 South Massif Summit from Station 6 (0.3 Mb or 5.0 Mb)\n\nJack's 500-mm frames taken while he braced himself against the boulder. The frames are AS17-139-21208-09 and 21211. This assembly, by Syd Buxton was rotated to match the orientation seen in Gene's Station 6 pan. Syd writes that he did not use 21210 in the assembly because the image is slightly blurred.\n\n166:10:23 Jack's Near-Field Station 7 Pan ( 412k )\n\nThe frames are AS17-141- 21646 to 21664. Jack took this pan at 11-foot focus and kept his aim low to show the areas from which they would collect samples. The pan includes very little of the horizon.

Jack took this pan while Gene was getting a core sample in the white material they found near the Rover. It consists of frames AS17-142- 21836 to 21858. Assembled by Bob Fry.\n\nA high-resolution assembly (257 Mb TIFF or 13 Mb JPEG) has been done by Eric Jones. Note that Gene appears twice in this assembly. See, also, a version (4.8 Mb with anaglyphs presented in context. Individual, high-resolution anaglyphs are linked starting with 21837-38. David Harland has assembled the portion of showing Gene extracting the core 3.6 Mb ).\n\n173:19:58 Gene's Side of the LM Cabin ( 35k )\n\nErik van Meijgaarden has combined AS17-134-20517 and 523 into a post-EVA-3 view of Gene's side of the cabin. On 6 December 2004, Erik wrote, \" As I was going through Michael Light's 'Full Moon' recently, I found a striking combination of two photos shown alongside each other that give us a lovely overview of the LM's interior. It took me a while to realise they were not assembled but just shown together. So I set myself to work on an assembly. The photo's are two of the series Jack took after EVA 3 and aren't of particular good quality. I guess a Hasselblad is a difficult instrument in these lighting conditions and after 22 hours of tiring EVAs. Although there are better pics in the series, I selected the best matching pair and created my view of the LM's interior. Altogether a gloomy picture, but I particularly like this one because there are not many images that give a sense of the size and (lack of) space available inside the LM.\"\n\n172:37:07 Post-EVA-3 Window Pans ( 123k )\n\nDave Byrne has combined photos taken out the windows after PLSS jettison. The photos taken out Jack's window are AS17-143- 21943 to 21960. those taken out Gene's window are 21961 to 21982.\n\n172:37:07 Post-EVA-3 Color Window Pans ( 117k )\n\nDave Byrne has combined color photos taken out the windows after PLSS jettison.

Scan by Ed Hengeveld.\n\n72-H-253 ( 1.7 Mb or 0.1 Mb)\n\nGene Cernan raises his arms during a final suit fit check. Note that the suit is inflated, undoubtedly at 3.8 psi above the pressure in the fitting room. Moving the suit arms away from their rest position against internal pressure is relatively difficult. The suit design includes two cables attached at the center of the chest which then run laterally to the armpits and then into tubes that run up over the shoulders. After extisting the tubes, the cables are secured at the center of the back. Friction between the tubes and the cables help keep the arms in any particular position. The tube on Gene's left shoulder is clearly visible. Note the small pulley wheels at the entrance to the tube on his right shoulder. The wheel on the left shoulder isn't visible in this shot. There are similar pulleys at the tube exits on the back of the shoulders. The wheels prevent contact between the cables and the tube edges at the entrances and exits. Photo filed 6 March 1972. Scan courtesy J.L.Pickering.\n\n72-H-297 ( 84k )\n\nRon Evans undergoes final flight fit checkout and integration of the Apollo 7-L spacesuit. Note the lack of a pulley at the entrance to the cable tube on his right shoulder, perhaps because the Command Module Pilot would not require as much mobility nor exercise the suit nearly as much as the surface crew. 7 March 1972.
