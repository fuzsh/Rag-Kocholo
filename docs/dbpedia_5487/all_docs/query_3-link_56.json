        "text": "THE PHYSICS CLASSROOM TUTORIAL\n\nA set of instructional pages written in an easy-to-understand language and complemented by graphics and Check Your Understanding sections. An ideal starting location for those grasping for understanding or searching for answers.\n\nPHYSICS SIMULATIONS\n\nThe Physics Interactives includes a large collection of HTML5 interactive physics simulations. Designed with tablets such as the iPad and with Chromebooks in mind, this user-friendly section is filled with skill-building exercises, physics simulations, and game-like challenges.\n\nPHYSICS VIDEO TUTORIAL\n\nOur Video Tutorial provides a video-based alternative to the written Tutorial above. We aim to present relatively short, highly-organized presentations with a strong graphical component on discrete topics. Watch them on our site or follow the links to YouTube. We add videos quite frequently so stop back by if you don't find what you are looking for. Or subscribe to our YouTube channel, tap the bell, and receive notifications when new videos come out.\n\nMULTIMEDIA PHYSICS STUDIOS\n\nA large collection of GIF animations and QuickTime movies designed to demonstrate physics principles in a visual manner. Each animation is accompanied by explanations and links to further information.\n\nCONCEPT BUILDERS\n\nHave you tried a Concept Builder lately? You should. This growing collection of cognitively-rich exercises will focus student attention on discrete learning goals. Filled with interactive elements, this section is the perfect tool for getting students thinking about the meaning of concepts. Perfect for students and 1:1 classrooms using iPads, Chromebooks, and the like. And for Chemistry types, we've added a large collection of Chemistry Concept Builders.\n\nMINDS ON PHYSICS - VERSION 5\n\nMinds On Physics - Version 5 is the HTML5 version of Minds On Physics that replaces our App and Legacy versions. Relying on a large bank of carefully crafted questions, Minds On Physics seeks to improve students' conceptions of physics. \"MOPs\" combines interactive questioning modules with a thorough, question-specific Help system to engage students in an exercise in thinking, reflecting, and learning. Version 5 is our best-yet version of Minds On Physics. There is a fully functional free version and a paid version that integrates seamlessly with our Task Tracker system and offers some rather enticing features.\n\nTHE CALCULATOR PAD\n\nVersion 2 of the Calculator Pad is now available. Our newest version includes >2500 Physics and Chemistry problems organized into >250 ready-to-use problem sets. Numerical information is randomly-generated. An answer box allows students to solve and check their answers. Most problems are accompanied by an audio-guided solution that explains how to solve a similar problem while hilighting the habits that can be adopted for solving any problem. Teachers with Task Tracker accounts can modify problems and problem sets and even create their own problems. Task Tracker also allows teachers to assign problems to their students and track their progress.\n\nCONCEPT CHECKERS\n\nConcept Checkers were built to coordinate with the Physics Interactives section of our website. Relying upon our Task Tracker tool to deliver questions, check answers, and track student progress, a Concept Checker is designed to coordinate with an interactive simulation. Use it as a follow-up check to understanding after exploring the simulation. Most sims are accompanied by a Concept Checker. Some sims have Task Tracker code built into the simulation. But not all sims will have a Concept Checker. Concept Checkers can be used with or without a Task Tracker account.\n\nTHE SCIENCE REASONING CENTER\n\nThe Science Reasoning Center is our most recent upgrade. This section includes about 70 activities that are perfect for encouraging scientific reasoning skills. Students use science and engineering practices, combined with cross cutting science concepts and core ideas from the disciplines of physics (and chemistry) to analyze phenomenon, experiments, and data presentations. We broke ground in April of 2023; we will continue work throughout the 2023-24 school year.\n\nTHE REVIEW SESSION\n\nA collection of pages with questions and answers/explanations which serve as reviews or practice. Each review complements a chapter from The Physics Classroom Tutorial.\n\nPHYSICS HELP\n\nA variety of question-and-answer pages which target specific concepts and skills. Topics range from the graphical analysis of motion and drawing free body diagrams to a discussion of vectors and vector addition.\n\nACT TEST CENTER\n\nCalling all high school juniors: You've trusted The Physics Classroom to help prepare you for that unit exam in physics. Why not trust us to help prepare you for the biggest test of the year - the ACT test? That's right. Let the TPC help you with the ACT."
