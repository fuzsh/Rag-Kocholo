        "text": "Some drivers are content to let the climate control do all the work and drive with the windows up all the time, while others crave fresh air and like the windows down as much as possible. If you’re in the latter group then you know how difficult it can be to get your fresh air fix when it’s raining or when driving at speed; if you lower the windows you’ll get soaked or grow deaf from wind noise. For fresh air junkies the answer to your dilemma is a set of Ventvisor Window Deflectors. Once installed on your vehicle, Ventvisors will let you keep your windows open enough for fresh air circulation without getting wet, and they’ll significantly reduce wind noise so you can drive at speed with the windows open. Ventvisors will also keep your interior cooler during the hot summer months by allowing you to crack your windows when parked in the sun. The trapped heat will be able to escape and potential thieves won’t be able to tell your windows are slightly down.\n\nAVS is the innovator of the original Ventvisor and this model has a higher profile for maximum protection. They’re made of rugged reinforced acrylic that is UV and scratch resistant, with an attractive smoke finish that will help shield the sun from your eyes and be a stylish enhancement to any vehicle. AVS uses a higher grade acrylic material than most other manufacturers, which means Ventvisors will hold their smoke finish longer, and are just the right thickness to be strong yet flexible for a perfect fit.\n\nVentvisors install quickly and easily with 3M acrylic foam tape, and no drilling is required. This tape is so effective it’s used by the automobile manufacturers to attach trim parts at the factory. Because no drilling is required, there’s no need to worry about rust forming at a hole. The foam core allows the tape to expand and contract with temperature changes and conform to surface irregularities. Installation is not only simpler; there are no unsightly fasteners to deal with. Just clean the surface according to the included instructions, then remove the backing from the tape and press the Ventvisor into place.\n\nYou can run your car or truck through the car wash with Ventvisors installed; however automatic “brush-style” car washes should be avoided. They come with everything required for installation, including detailed instructions, and they’re covered by a limited lifetime warranty against defects in materials and workmanship. The warranty applies to the original purchaser as long as he or she owns the vehicle on which the product is installed."
