Specific models were meant to hold entertainment, such as music, movies, and holotape games, with special-purpose players developed for displaying large, high resolution volumetric images or to play holotapes for personal use in a home environment via holotape players.[11] Holotapes could utilize terminal functionality, adding the ability for use with stationary terminals, together with interactive games.[12][13][14]\n\nA RobCo terminal with a holotape player was added as a part of the time capsule known as the \"Treasures of Jamaica Plain,\" displayed among other remnants of the past in the Jamaica Plain Town Hall basement.[15]\n\nCharacteristics[]\n\nTheir appearance varies between games. In Fallout, Fallout 2, and Fallout Tactics, holotapes are interchangeably referred to as holodisks and contained holotape reels in a translucent protective casing, roughly comparable to a VHS tape or computer hard drive.\n\nIn Fallout 3 and New Vegas, they are flat, with a gray metal casing, a vision slit that reveals the tape reels, and square shaped.\n\nIn Fallout 4 and Fallout 76, holotapes were redesigned with an orange and yellow plastic casing that completely conceals the tape reels, with a gray metal circle in the upper left corner. When played outside power armor, the player character will open the PIP-Boy and insert the tape. They can also be played on terminals. In Fallout 76, calling an emergency supply drop actually requires the player to insert the emergency drop holotape.\n\nBehind the scenes[]\n\nHolotapes are based on the real world 1969 RCA SelectaVision HoloTape Player, which involved etching holographic grooves onto a tape for later playback.[Non-game 3]\n\nGallery[]\n\nReferences[]"
