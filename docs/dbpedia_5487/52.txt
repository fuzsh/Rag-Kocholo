Magnetic tape is perfect for locations where markings and descriptions change often. The magnetic tape can be applied directly to steel surfaces, and you can write on it with a pen or marker. The writing can be erased, allowing the tape to be reused.

Magnetic tape can be used virtually on any metal object, such as whiteboards, warehouse shelves, lockers, drawers, or internal transport methods.

The magnetic tape is provided on 10-meter rolls. The roll can also be cut to size easily with scissors as well.
