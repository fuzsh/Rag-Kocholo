video tape recorder, electromechanical device that records and reproduces an electronic signal containing audio and video information onto and from magnetic tape. It is commonly used for recording television productions that are intended for rebroadcasting to mass audiences. There are two types of video tape units: the transverse, or quad, and the helical.

The transverse unit uses four heads rotating on an axis perpendicular to the direction of 2-inch (5-centimetre) tape. The transverse format achieves a 1,500-inch-per-minute head-to-tape speed necessary for high picture quality. For broadcast industry needs, an audio track, control track, and cue track are added longitudinally. These units follow the standards of the North American Television Standards Commissionâ€”i.e., the electron beam sweeps 525 horizontal lines at 60 cycles per second.
