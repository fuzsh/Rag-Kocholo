        "text": "The presidential election may be behind us, but many of Carly Rose Sonenclar’s fans have their sights set on voting for her on the “X Factor,” FOX’s singing competition.\n\nBy Janice Llanes Fabry\n\nThe presidential election may be behind us, but many of Carly Rose Sonenclar’s fans have their sights set on voting for her on the “X Factor,” FOX’s singing competition. As the Rye Neck Middle School student progresses as a favorite contestant, the community is putting their support behind her. Although the talented 13-year-old received the second highest number of votes last week out of the 12 remaining contestants, local fans want to ensure that the public doesn’t get complacent.\n\n“Collectively, we feel it’s important to provide support from our small community, much like the support given to the other contestants,” explained Joy Bruenn, who is working with fellow Rye Neck moms Peggy Conner, Anne Dooley, Jayne Kligman, Debra Julian, Marina Kohl, and Bernadette Acompora to round up the troops. “Our goal is to spread the word to everyone in Westchester County to watch Carly and vote. Her hometown is behind her.”\n\nFrom California, where Carly and her parents are busy with her grueling rehearsal and show biz schedule, the singer expressed her appreciation.\n\n“I am so lucky to have such great support from back home. Even in the middle of a hurricane, our friends arranged a big viewing party. I am so grateful and want to send my love and thanks to each and every person,” she said.\n\nNeighborhood families in Rye and Mamaroneck have been watching the show together at each other’s homes and have assembled “X Factor” viewings for young fans at Chat 19 in Larchmont. Friends have generated support by distributing fliers, painting Toyota City and Carriage Auto City windows with “ Vote for Carly” signs, as well as circulating messages on Facebook.\n\n“We’re so proud of Carly and we’re so happy to be able to support her,” said Rye Neck Middle School eighth grader Claire Julian. Classmate Jessica Giordano added, “Carly works so hard that she deserves it all. We haven’t missed a show since it started and even went to our friends’ houses to watch when we lost power last week.”\n\nDevotees of the young crooner extend beyond Westchester. A video of Carly’s “X Factor” audition has garnered almost 15 million hits on YouTube. Her rendition of Nina Simone’s “Feeling Good” drew enthusiastic praise from the judges on the show, Simon Cowell, L.A. Reid, Britney Spears, and Demi Lovato. Having earned a spot on Spears’ team of teens, Carly has continued to dazzle audiences with her performances of Karmin’s “Brokenhearted” and Flo Rida’s “Good Feeling.”\n\nAfter last week’s heartfelt performance of Bruno Mars’ “It Will Rain,” Cowell gushed, “You’ve got real guts for someone your age. I’ve got a feeling that with you, Carly, we’re watching a star in the making.” Spears added, “I feel like you should have closed the show because no one could follow that.”\n\n“X Factor” performance shows air on Tuesdays or Wednesdays from 8–10 p.m. America votes for their favorite contestants for up to two hours after the program by calling, texting, or logging on to the show’s website, through Facebook or via a new mobile app. The results shows air on Thursdays at 8 p.m."
