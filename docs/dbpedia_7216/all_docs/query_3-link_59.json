        "text": "Dissonant Voices\n\nSinging coach Jackie Walker (guest starring 2013 Tony Award-winner Billy Porter) is at the height of his career, with a featured role on television's biggest reality show, \"American Diva,\" and a steady position teaching music at a prestigious New York City school. When a four year-old student comes forward with claims of sexual abuse, Detective Rollins (Kelli Giddish) asks the squad to be mindful of Walker's reputation, but Benson's (Mariska Hargitay) investigation uncovers evidence that condemns the popular personality. As the case becomes public, more and more victims come forward, but Walker refuses to come clean."
