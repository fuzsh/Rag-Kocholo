        "text": "Former X Factor USA contestant Carly Rose Sonenclar has given her seal of approval to the parenting skills of Simon Cowell, who is set to become a father for the first time.\n\nSonenclar was runner-up in last year’s series of The X Factor, on which Simon Cowell is a judge and despite being just 14, the aspiring singer reckons she knows what it takes to make a good parent.\n\nComparing fatherhood to being a judge on the show, she said she thought Cowell would treat his child as he treated contestants.\n\n‘I think he’s going to be a good dad – I really do,’ Carly told Life & Style magazine.\n\n‘The thing with him, is even us – we’re his contestants, we’re not his children, obviously – but he treated us… he wanted to push us to do our best, and he did. I think that’s what he’ll do for his child.’\n\nNews that Cowell was expecting his first child with socialite Lauren Silverman shocked the showbiz world earlier this summer, as the music mogul is famed for his apparent inability to settle down."
