        "text": "Photo by: Gregg DeGuire/WireImage\n\nReading Time: 2 minutes\n\nTwo former contestants on The X Factor USA are launching a podcast all about their journey on the show, with special guests. The podcast will be hosted by Diamond White and Carly Rose Sonenclar.\n\nFormer The X Factor Contestants Launch New Podcast\n\nThe X Factor is best known for its UK iteration, but there was an American version of the talent show on FOX for three seasons from 2011 to 2013. Diamond White and Carly Rose Sonenclar competed in the second season of the show, coming in fifth and second place, respectively.\n\nNow the two singers are joining forces to host a new podcast called Ex Factors, which is set to launch on Tuesday, April 16. Earlier this week, the hosts shared a trailer for the new project, which teases what fans can expect from upcoming episodes.\n\nIn the clip, the hosts can be seen reacting to something dramatic — possibly an old clip from the show. They also bond over their shared fear of forgetting the lyrics while performing. The trailer teases a few special guests, including fellow Season 2 contestant Beatrice Miller.\n\nMiller can be heard saying that judge Britney Spears was “so nice to us.” At least one of the other hosts seems to disagree with that sentiment, which is sure to be an interesting conversation.\n\nSEE ALSO: BRITNEY SPEARS SAYS SHE ‘ABSOLUTELY HATED’ JUDGING ‘THE X FACTOR’\n\nWhat Have the Hosts Been Up to Since the Show?\n\nSince competing on The X Factor USA in 2012, Diamond White and Carly Rose Sonenclar have both embarked on music careers. The singers were just 13 years old when they auditioned for the show, so it will be fascinating to hear them reflect on their journeys now that they’re adults.\n\nSonenclar, who goes by Carly Rose, has released several singles over the past few years. In 2020, she put out a seven-song EP called Wild. In 2022, Sonenclar recreated a performance of “Brokenhearted” by Karmin from her time on The X Factor.\n\nWhite has done quite a bit of acting work since her time in the competition, including voice roles on shows such as Transformers: Rescue Bots and Moon Girl and Devil Dinosaur. She’s also released two albums, titled Tomorrow and Summerland.\n\nAre you excited to listen to the Ex Factors podcast when it launches on April 16? Let us know in the comments below."
