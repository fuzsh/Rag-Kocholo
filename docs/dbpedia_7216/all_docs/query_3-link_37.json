        "text": "Carly Rose Sonenclar, age twelve, started singing when she was two and has not stopped since. She began her professional career in 2006, playing the role of Pearl in The Night of the Hunter (The New York Musical Theatre Festival). She made her Broadway debut in Les Miserables in 2006, playing the principal role of Young Cosette, and understudying Gavroche for the entire run of the show. She reprised that role in a four-city tour of Les Mis in the summer of 2008. She also played the role of Kim in a production of Show Boat at Carnegie Hall in 2008. In 2009, Carly originated the role of Carrie in the national tour of Little House on the Prairie: The Musical, and was thrilled to have the opportunity to return to Broadway in April of 2011, originating the role of Chloe in the new Frank Wildhorn musical, Wonderland at the Marquis Theatre.\n\nCarly has appeared in several feature and independent films, including The Nanny Diaries and Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants II. In addition, beginning in 2011, she launched a new character, Gilda Flip, on the PBS TV Series, The Electric Company. She has performed at numerous charity benefits, including the prestigious KIDS/Fashion Delivers benefit at which Barack Obama appeared as the keynote speaker, and most recently singing alongside former Yankee great and highly accomplished guitarist Bernie Williams. Carly has performed the National Anthem at the US Open Tennis tournament and before the start of a New York Knicks game at Madison Square Garden.\n\nCarly, who is a seventh grader from Westchester, NY, enjoys reading, playing piano and softball, and adores her older brother Russell.\n\nwww.carlyrosesonenclar.com"
