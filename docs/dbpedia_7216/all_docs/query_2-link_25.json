        "text": "Down to the last two weeks of the “X-Factor,” Carly Rose Sonenclar continues soaring to new heights.\n\nBy Janice Llanes Fabry\n\nDown to the last two weeks of the “X-Factor,” Carly Rose Sonenclar continues soaring to new heights. With only four contestants left, as of press time, it appears the 13-year-old powerhouse will make it to the final round on December 19 — if America continues to vote for her.\n\n“Carly’s Angels,” as her fans across the country have come to be called, have kept her in the top two spots on Fox’s blockbuster singing competition, which airs Wednesdays and Thursdays at 8 p.m. Her performances on YouTube have garnered millions of hits, almost 20 million for her rendition of Nina Simone’s “Feeling Good.” Week after week, hometown support has skyrocketed.\n\n“I want to send my love and thanks to each and every person,” said Sonenclar, whose family is overwhelmed by the community’s powerful endorsement.\n\nRye and Mamaroneck families continue to hand out fliers, paint merchants’ windows, and put up “vote for Carly” signs on easels throughout the Rye Neck School district. Her own Rye Neck Middle School is abuzz about their eighth-grade crooner.\n\nAlthough Sonenclar has been away all semester, her classmates see her every week on the “X-Factor.” Absolutely over the moon about having one of their own on a national stage, the school has been showing YouTube clips of her performances in the classroom.\n\n“The whole school is excited about how well Carly is doing and we are very proud of her,” said Rye Neck Middle School Principal Eric Lutinski. “She has shown great maturity and poise and has proven to be an excellent role model. Teachers have pointed out to students how practice, hard work, and determination can be rewarding.”\n\nIndeed, Sonenclar has worked very hard since she was a little girl doing what she loves, appearing on Broadway and at Carnegie Hall. On the “X-Factor,” her compelling renditions of such classics as “Over the Rainbow,” as well as electrifying covers of pop tunes by Adele, Beyonce, and Justin Bieber wowed the entire country. The judges call her “a force of nature” and “a star.”\n\nBack home, classmate Claire Julian remarked, “Carly should definitely win because she is such an amazing singer. She is also just a really good person, who works so hard. I hope everyone keeps voting for her on Wednesday night.”"
