Reid’s Tate Stevens, Bonfire – Great song, upbeat. That would be a great concert song and really showed Tate is going to be a star. He really looked like he wants to win. Judge Britney Spears said Tate wasn’t at his best.\n\nBritney’s Carly Rose Sonenclar, Your Song – I wasn’t a big fan of Carly’s choice to do this Elton John song, but she killed it as usual. I thought it paled in comparison to Tate’s performance. The ending made up for what the beginning lacked.\n\nSimon Cowell’s Emblem3, Baby I Love Your Way – Better performance from them although I wasn’t impressed with the vocals. Harmonies were good and the judges all loved it.\n\nSimon’s Fifth Harmony, Anything Can Happen – When they started I thought I was going to be bored, but it was really great. I loved it.\n\nTate, Fall – A slower song to show off his voice. It was a boring song for me, but he nailed the vocals.\n\nCarly Rose, Imagine – Another huge song for this 13-year-old and a huge gamble. She sounded phenomenal again and added a nice little touch sitting at the piano at the start and end of the song.\n\nAdvertisement 3\n\nStory continues below\n\nThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nArticle content\n\nEmblem3, Hey Jude – They are really pulling out the big songs tonight. One of my favourite Beatles’ songs and the boys did a wonderful job. I really like that they didn’t fool around with it too much and I believe that was their best song of the season. Britney said it was an A-level performance.\n\nFifth Harmony, Impossible – I see a future for these five girls, who sang the same song they performed at Simon’s house during the selection stage. I would have a tough time eliminating them after their two performances on Wednesday night, but I still think the other three may advance.\n\nThe Regina Leader-Post has created an Afternoon Headlines newsletter that can be delivered daily to your inbox so you are up to date with the most vital news of the day.
