        "text": "At the beginning of the year, I discovered a very talented young girl on Youtube. The first video I’ve seen of her is when she performed at an audition for the American X Factor, and I can tell you that I wasn’t expecting such a wonderful voice!\n\nCarly is 13 years old and sang ‘Feeling good’ by Nina Simone : what a surprising choice for a young girl. Nevertheless, her performance was the most incredible I’ve ever seen. The jury, composed of the famous stars Britney Spears and Demi Lovato, but also Simon Cowell and L.A Reid, couldn’t believe what they were hearing ! Carly received what she deserved : a standing ovation. Like L.A Reid said, ‘a star is born’, and it’s definitely true. Her other perfomances in X factor were up to the first one : outstanding. She performed a lot of songs like ‘Rolling in the deep’ by Adele, also ‘All I want for Christmas’ but my favorite is ‘Halleluyah’. She sang it for the finals, and put a lot of emotion in her interpretation : it was beautiful. Unfortunately, she didn’t win, but it doesn’t matter because she has her talent and she’ll do great things.\n\nCarly has a very mature voice, with intense mediums for her age, and she can sound a note with power and resistance. Her vocal poise is surprising; that’s why she can sing a large repertoire of songs. She played the role of Cosette in the Broadway musical when she was a child : people already remarked her, the quality of her interpretation for her age. Now, in parallel to her concerts in the US, she has her own chain of videos on Youtube. We can see her singing ‘Runaway‘ by Bruno Mars, and ‘Trouble’ by Taylor Swift.\n\nI’m impressed by the way she transforms every song in order to create her own style. Even if she’s young, she has a lot of technique. Her voice is natural and will become more and more powerful. The videos she did after the X Factor session are really good : she performs a cover of ‘After Tonight’ and ‘Trouble’ by Taylor Swift with her brother who is playing the guitar. I really like her interpretation : she revisits the two songs, realizes a great transition and brings her personal touch. She had also the occasion to show her technique in a studio, performing ‘Runaway Baby’ by Bruno Mars.\n\nYou can see all her videos on Youtube, and even go to her website if you want to know more about her !\n\nHortense"
