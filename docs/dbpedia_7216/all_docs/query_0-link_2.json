        "text": "Britney Jean Spears (born December 2, 1981) is an American recording artist and entertainer. Born in McComb, Mississippi, and raised in Kentwood, Louisiana, she performed acting roles in stage productions and television shows as a child before signing with Jive Records in 1997. Spears’s first and second studio albums, …Baby One More Time (1999) and Oops!… I Did It Again (2000), became international successes, with the former becoming the best-selling album by a teenage solo artist. Title tracks “…Baby One More Time” and “Oops!… I Did It Again” broke international sales records. In 2001, Spears released her self-titled third studio album,Britney, and played the starring role in the film Crossroads (2002). She assumed creative control of her fourth studio album, In the Zone (2003), which yielded the worldwide success of the “Toxic” single.\n\nIn 2007, Spears’s much-publicized personal issues sent her career into hiatus. Her fifth studio album, Blackout, was released later that year, and spawned hits such as “Gimme More” and “Piece of Me”. Her erratic behavior and hospitalizations continued through the following year, at which point she was placed under a still on-going conservatorship. Spears’s sixth studio album, Circus (2008), included global chart-topping lead single “Womanizer”. Its supporting tour The Circus Starring Britney Spears was one of the highest-grossing global concert tours in 2009. Later that October, “3” became Spears’s third single to reach number one on the Billboard Hot 100. Her seventh studio album, Femme Fatale (2011), became her first to yield three top-ten singles in the United States: “Hold It Against Me”, “Till the World Ends” and “I Wanna Go”. She also served as a judge during the second season of the American version of The X Factor. Spears’s eponymous eighth studio album Britney Jean was released in 2013; it spawned the top 15 hit “Work Bitch”, however it became the lowest-selling record of her career. Later that year, Spears began the two-year residency show Britney: Piece of Me at The AXIS at Planet Hollywood Resort & Casino in Las Vegas.\n\nSpears was established as a pop icon and credited with influencing the revival of teen pop during the late 1990s. She became the ‘best-selling teenaged artist of all time’ and garnered honorific titles including the “Princess of Pop”. Her work has earned her numerous awards and accolades, including a Grammy Award, six MTV Video Music Awards including the Lifetime Achievement Award, nine Billboard Music Awards, and a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame. In 2009, Billboard ranked her as the 8th overall Artist of the Decade, and also recognized her as the best-selling female artist of the first decade of the 21st century, as well as the fifth overall. The Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) named Spears as the eighth top-selling female artist in the United States, with 34 million certified albums. Nielsen SoundScan ranked her the tenth best-selling digital artist of the country, with more than 28.6 million digital singles as of January 2012. She has sold over 100 million albums worldwide, making her one of the best-selling music artists of all time. Rolling Stone recognized her instant success as one of the Top 25 Teen Idol Breakout Moments of all time, while VH1 ranked her eleventh on their “100 Greatest Women in Music” list in 2012, and Billboard named her the sexiest woman in music. Forbes reported that Spears was the highest paid female musician of 2012, with earnings of $58 million, having last topped the list in 2002.\n\nEarly life and career beginnings\n\nSpears was born in McComb, Mississippi, the second child of Lynne Irene Bridges and James Parnell Spears. Her maternal grandmother, Lillian Portell, was English (born inLondon), and one of Spears’s maternal great-great-grandfathers was Maltese. Her siblings are Bryan James and Jamie Lynn. At age three, she started attending dance lessons in her hometown of Kentwood, Louisiana, and was selected to perform as a solo artist at the annual recital. During her childhood, she also attended gymnastics and voice lessons, and won many state-level competitions and children’s talent shows. Spears made her local stage debut at age five, singing “What Child Is This?” at her kindergarten graduation. She said about her ambition as a child, “I was in my own world, […] I found out what I’m supposed to do at an early age”.\n\nAt age eight, Spears and her mother Lynne traveled to Atlanta, Georgia for an audition in the 1990s revival of The Mickey Mouse Club. Casting director Matt Casella rejected her for being too young to join the series at the time, but introduced her to Nancy Carson, a New York City talent agent. Carson was impressed with Spears’s vocals and suggested enrolling her at the Professional Performing Arts School; shortly after, Lynne and her daughters moved to a sublet apartment in New York. Spears was hired for her first professional role as the understudy for the lead role of Tina Denmark in the Off-Broadway musical Ruthless!. She also appeared as a contestant on the popular television showStar Search and was cast in a number of commercials. In December 1992, she was finally cast in The Mickey Mouse Club alongside Christina Aguilera, Justin Timberlake,Ryan Gosling, and Keri Russell, but returned to Kentwood after the show was canceled in 1995. She enrolled at Parklane Academy in McComb, Mississippi. Although she made friends with most of her classmates, she compared the school to “the opening scene in Clueless with all the cliques. […] I was so bored. I was the point guard on the basketball team. I had my boyfriend, and I went to homecoming and Christmas formal. But I wanted more.”\n\nIn June 1997, Spears was in talks with manager Lou Pearlman to join the female pop group Innosense. Lynne asked family friend and entertainment lawyer Larry Rudolph for his opinion and submitted a tape of Spears singing over a Whitney Houston karaoke song along with some pictures. Rudolph decided he wanted to pitch her to record labels, therefore she needed a professional demo. He sent Spears an unused song of Toni Braxton; she rehearsed for a week and recorded her vocals in a studio with a sound engineer. Spears traveled to New York with the demo and met with executives from four labels, returning to Kentwood the same day. Three of the labels rejected her, arguing that audiences wanted pop bands such as the Backstreet Boys and the Spice Girls, and “there wasn’t going to be another Madonna, another Debbie Gibson, or another Tiffany.”\n\nTwo weeks later, executives from Jive Records returned calls to Rudolph. Senior vice president of A&R Jeff Fenster stated about Spears’s audition that “it’s very rare to hear someone that age who can deliver emotional content and commercial appeal. […] For any artist, the motivation—the ‘eye of the tiger’—is extremely important. And Britney had that.” She then sang Houston’s “I Have Nothing” (1992) for the executives, and was signed to the label. They appointed her to work with producer Eric Foster White for a month, who reportedly shaped her voice from “lower and less poppy” delivery to “distinctively, unmistakably Britney.” After hearing the recorded material, president Clive Calderordered a full album. Spears had originally envisioned “Sheryl Crow music, but younger more adult contemporary” but felt all right with her label’s appointment of producers, since “It made more sense to go pop, because I can dance to it—it’s more me.” She flew to Cheiron Studios in Stockholm, Sweden, where half of the album was recorded from March to April 1998, with producers Max Martin, Denniz Pop and Rami Yacoub, among others.\n\n1998 – 2000\n\nAfter Spears returned to the United States, she embarked on a shopping mall promotional tour to promote her debut album. Her show was a four song set and she was accompanied by two back up dancers. Her first concert tour followed, as an opening act for NSYNC. Her debut studio album, …Baby One More Time, was released on January 12, 1999. It debuted at number one on the U.S. Billboard 200 and was certified two-times platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America after a month. Worldwide, the album topped the charts in fifteen countries and sold over 10 million copies in a year. It became the biggest selling album ever by a teenage artist.\n\nThe title track was released as the lead single from the album. Originally, Jive Records wanted its music video to be animated; however, Spears rejected it, and suggested the final idea of a Catholic schoolgirl. The single sold 500,000 copies on its first day, and peaked at number one on the Billboard Hot 100, topping the chart for two consecutive weeks. It has sold more than 10 million as of today, making it one of the best-selling singles of all time. “…Baby One More Time” later received a Grammy nomination for Best Female Pop Vocal Performance. The title track also topped the singles chart for two weeks in the United Kingdom, and became the fastest-selling single ever by a female artist, shipping over 460,000 copies. It would later become the 25th-most successful song of all time in British chart history. Spears is also the youngest female artist to have a million seller in the country. “(You Drive Me) Crazy” was released as the third single from the album. It became a top-ten hit worldwide and propelled …Baby One More Timeto sell even more. As of today, it has sold 30 million copies worldwide, making it one of the best-selling albums of all time. It is also the best-selling first album by any artist ever.\n\nThe April 1999 cover of Rolling Stone featured Spears lying on her bed, covered with a bra, shorts and an open top. The American Family Association (AFA) referred to the shoot as “a disturbing mix of childhood innocence and adult sexuality” and called to “God-loving Americans to boycott stores selling Britney’s albums.” Spears responded to the outcry commenting, “What’s the big deal? I have strong morals. […] I’d do it again. I thought the pictures were fine. And I was tired of being compared to Debbie Gibson and all of thisbubblegum pop all the time.” Shortly before, Spears had announced publicly she would remain a virgin until marriage. On June 28, 1999, Spears began her first headlining…Baby One More Time Tour in North America, which was positively received by critics, but generated some controversy due to her racy outfits. An extension of the tour, titled Crazy 2k, followed in March 2000. Spears premiered songs from her upcoming second album during the show.\n\nOops!… I Did It Again, her second studio album, was released in May 2000. It debuted at number one in the US, selling 1.3 million copies, breaking the SoundScan record for the highest debut sales by any solo artist. The album sold over 25 million copies worldwide to date, making one of the best-selling albums of all time. Rob Sheffield of Rolling Stone said that “the great thing about Oops! – under the cheese surface, Britney’s demand for satisfaction is complex, fierce and downright scary, making her a true child of rock & roll tradition.” The album’s lead single, “Oops!… I Did It Again”, peaked at the top of the charts in Australia, New Zealand, the United Kingdom and many other European nations. The album as well as the title track received Grammy nominations for Best Pop Vocal Album and Best Female Pop Vocal Performance, respectively.\n\nThe same year, Spears embarked on the Oops!… I Did It Again Tour, which grossed $40.5 million; she also released her first book, Britney Spears’ Heart-to-Heart, co-written with her mother. On September 7, 2000, Spears performed at the 2000 MTV Video Music Awards. Halfway through the performance, she ripped off her black suit to reveal a sequined flesh-colored bodysuit, followed by heavy dance routine. It is noted by critics as the moment that Spears showed signs of becoming a more provocative performer. Amidst media speculation, Spears confirmed she was dating NSYNC member Justin Timberlake. She also bought a home in Destin, Florida.\n\n&nsbp;\n\n2001 – 2002\n\nIn February 2001, Spears signed a $7–8 million promotional deal with Pepsi, and released another book co-written with her mother, titled A Mother’s Gift.\n\nHer self-titled third studio album, Britney, was released in November 2001. While on tour, she felt inspired by hip hop artists such as Jay-Z and The Neptunes and wanted to create a record with a funkier sound. The album debuted at number one in the Billboard 200 and reached top five positions in Australia, the United Kingdom and mainland Europe and sold over 12 million copies worldwide. Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic called Britney “the record where she strives to deepen her persona, making it more adult while still recognizably Britney. […] It does sound like the work of a star who has now found and refined her voice, resulting in her best record yet.” The album was honored with two Grammy nominations—Best Pop Vocal Album and Best Female Pop Vocal Performance for “Overprotected”— and was listed in 2008 as one of Entertainment Weekly’s “100 Best Albums from the Past 25 Years”. The album’s first single, “I’m a Slave 4 U”, became a top-ten hit worldwide.\n\nSpears’s performance of the single at the 2001 MTV Video Music Awards featured a caged tiger and a large albino python draped over her shoulders. It was harshly received by animal rights organization PETA, who claimed the animals were mistreated and scrapped plans for an anti-fur billboard that was to feature Spears. To support the album, Spears embarked on the Dream Within a Dream Tour. The show was critically praised for its technical innovations, the pièce de résistance being a water screen that pumped two tons of water into the stage. The tour grossed $43.7 million, becoming the second highest grossing tour of 2002 by a female artist, behind Cher’s Farewell Tour. Her career success was highlighted by Forbes in 2002, as Spears was ranked the world’s most powerful celebrity. Spears also landed her first starring role inCrossroads, released in February 2002. Although the film was largely panned, some critics praised Spears’s acting. Crossroads, which had a $12 million budget, went on to gross over $61.1 million worldwide.\n\nIn June 2002, Spears opened her first restaurant, Nyla, in New York City, but terminated her relationship in November, citing mismanagement and “management’s failure to keep her fully apprised”. In July 2002, Spears announced she would take a six-month break from her career; however, she went back into the studio in November to record her new album. Spears’s relationship with Justin Timberlake ended after three years. In December 2002, Timberlake released the song “Cry Me a River” as the second single from his solo debut album. The music video featured a Spears look-alike and fueled the rumors that she had been unfaithful to him. As a response, Spears wrote the ballad “Everytime” with her backing vocalist and friend Annet Artani. The same year, Limp Bizkit frontman Fred Durst said that he was in a relationship with Spears. However, Spears denied Durst’s claims. In a 2009 interview, he explained that “I just guess at the time it was taboo for a guy like me to be associated with a gal like her.”\n\n2003 – 2005\n\nIn 2003 Spears opened the 2003 MTV Video Music Awards with Christina Aguilera, performing “Like a Virgin”. Halfway through they were joined by Madonna, with whom they both kissed. The incident was highly publicized.\n\nSpears released her fourth studio album, In the Zone, in November 2003. She assumed more creative control by writing and co-producing most of the material. Vibe called it “A supremely confident dance record that also illustrates Spears’s development as a songwriter.” NPR listed the album as one of “The 50 Most Important Recording of the Decade”, adding that “the decade’s history of impeccably crafted pop is written on her body of work.” In the Zone sold over 609,000 copies in the United States and debuted at the top of the charts, making Spears the first female artist in the SoundScan era to have her first four studio albums to debut at number one. It also debuted at the top of the charts in France and the top ten in Belgium, Denmark, Sweden and the Netherlands. In the Zone sold over 10 million copies worldwide. The album produced the hit singles: “Me Against the Music”, a collaboration with Madonna; “Toxic”—which won Spears her only Grammy for Best Dance Recording; “Everytime” and “Outrageous”.\n\nIn January 2004, Spears married childhood friend Jason Allen Alexander at The Little White Wedding Chapel in Las Vegas, Nevada. The marriage was annulled 55 hours later, following a petition to the court that stated that Spears “lacked understanding of her actions”. In March 2004, she embarked on The Onyx Hotel Tour in support of In the Zone. In June 2004, Spears fell and injured her left knee during the music video shoot for “Outrageous”. Spears underwent arthroscopic surgery. She was forced to remain six weeks with a thigh brace, followed by eight to twelve weeks of rehabilitation, which caused The Onyx Hotel Tour to be canceled. During 2004, Spears became involved in the Kabbalah Centre through her friendship with Madonna.\n\nIn July 2004, Spears became engaged to American dancer Kevin Federline, whom she had met three months before. The romance received intense attention from the media, since Federline had recently broken up with actress Shar Jackson, who was still pregnant with their second child at the time. The stages of their relationship were chronicled in Spears’s first reality show Britney & Kevin: Chaotic. They held a wedding ceremony on September 18, 2004, but were not legally married until three weeks later on October 6 due to a delay finalizing the couple’s prenuptial agreement. Shortly after, she released her first fragrance with Elizabeth Arden, Curious, which broke the company’s first-week gross for a perfume. In October 2004, Spears took a career break to start a family.\n\nGreatest Hits: My Prerogative, her first greatest hits compilation album, was released in November 2004. Spears’s cover version of Bobby Brown’s “My Prerogative” was released as the lead single from the album, reaching the top of the charts in Finland, Ireland, Italy and Norway. The second single, “Do Somethin'”, was a top ten hit in Australia, the United Kingdom and other countries of mainland Europe. The greatest hits album sold over 5 million copies worldwide. In August 2005, Spears released “Someday (I Will Understand)”, which was dedicated to her first child, a son, who was born the following month. In November 2005, she released her first remix compilation, B in the Mix: The Remixes, which consists of eleven remixes. It has sold over 1 million copies worldwide.\n\n2006 – 2007\n\nIn February 2006, pictures surfaced of Spears driving with her son Sean, on her lap instead of in a car seat. Child advocates were horrified by the photos of her holding the wheel with one hand and Sean with the other. Spears claimed that the situation happened because of a frightening encounter with paparazzi, and that it was a mistake on her part. The following month, she guest-starred on the Will & Grace episode “Buy, Buy Baby” as closeted lesbian Amber Louise. She announced she no longer studied Kabbalah in June 2006, explaining, “my baby is my religion.” Two months later, Spears posed nude for the cover of Harper’s Bazaar. The picture was heavily compared to Demi Moore’s August 1991 Vanity Fair cover. In September 2006, she gave birth to her second child, a son. In November 2006, Spears filed for divorce from Federline, citing irreconcilable differences. Their divorce was finalized in July 2007, when the couple reached a global settlement and agreed to share joint custody of their children.\n\nSpears’s aunt Sandra Bridges Covington, with whom she had been very close, died of ovarian cancer in January 2007. In February, Spears stayed in a drug rehabilitation facility in Antigua for less than a day. The following night, she shaved her head with electric clippers at a hair salon inTarzana, Los Angeles. She admitted herself to other treatment facilities during the following weeks. In May 2007, she produced a series of promotional concerts at House of Blues venues, titled The M+M’s Tour. In October 2007, Spears lost physical custody of her children to Federline. The reasons of the court ruling were not revealed to the public. Spears was also sued by Louis Vuitton over her 2005 music video “Do Somethin'” for upholstering her Hummer interior in counterfeit Louis Vuitton cherry blossom fabric, which resulted in the video being banned on European TV stations.\n\nIn October 2007, Spears released her fifth studio album, Blackout. The album debuted at the top of charts in Canada and Ireland, number two in the U.S. Billboard 200, France, Japan, Mexico and the United Kingdom and the top ten in Australia, Korea, New Zealand and many European nations. In the United States, Spears became the only female artist to have her first five studio albums debut at the two top slots of the chart. The album received positive reviews from critics and has sold over 3 million copies worldwide. Blackout won Album of the Year at MTV Europe Music Awards 2008 and was listed as the fifth Best Pop Album of the Decade by The Times. Spears performed the lead single “Gimme More” at the 2007 MTV Video Music Awards. The performance was panned by many critics. Despite the backlash, the single rocketed to worldwide success, peaking at number one in Canada and the top ten in almost every country it charted. The second single “Piece of Me” reached the top of the charts in Ireland and reached the top five in Australia, Canada, Denmark, New Zealand and the United Kingdom. The third single “Break the Ice” was released the following year and had moderate success due to Spears not being able to promote it properly. In December 2007, Spears began a relationship with paparazzo Adnan Ghalib.\n\n2008 – 2010\n\nIn January 2008, Spears refused to relinquish custody of her sons to Federline’s representatives. She was hospitalized at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center after police that arrived at her house noted she appeared to be under the influence of an illicit substance. The following day, Spears’s visitation rights were suspended at an emergency court hearing, and Federline was given sole physical and legal custody of the children. She was committed to the psychiatric ward of Ronald Reagan UCLA Medical Center and put on 5150 involuntary psychiatric hold. The court placed her under temporary, and later, permanent conservatorship of her father James Spears and attorney Andrew Wallet, giving them complete control of her assets. She was released five days later.\n\nThe following month, Spears guest-starred on the How I Met Your Mother episode “Ten Sessions” as receptionist Abby. She received positive reviews for her performance, as well as bringing the series its highest ratings ever. In July 2008, Spears regained some visitation rights after coming to an agreement with Federline and his counsel. In September 2008, Spears opened the MTV Video Music Awards with a pre-taped comedy sketch with Jonah Hill and an introduction speech. She won Best Female Video, Best Pop Video and Video of the Year for “Piece of Me”. A 60-minute introspective documentary, Britney: For the Record, was produced to chronicle Spears’s return to the recording industry. Directed by Phil Griffin, For the Record was shot in Beverly Hills, Hollywood, and New York City during the third quarter of 2008. The documentary was broadcast on MTV to 5.6 million viewers for the two airings on the premiere night. It was the highest rating in its Sunday night timeslot and in the network’s history.\n\nIn December 2008, Spears’s sixth studio album Circus was released. It received positive reviews from critics and debuted at number one in Canada, Czech Republic and the United States, and inside the top ten in many European nations. In the United States, Spears became the youngest female artist to have five albums debut at number one, earning a place in Guinness World Records. She also became the only act in the Soundscan era to have four albums debut with 500,000 or more copies sold. The album was one of the fastest-selling albums of the year, and has sold 4 million copies worldwide. Its lead single, “Womanizer”, became Spears’s first number one in the Billboard Hot 100 since “…Baby One More Time”. The single also topped the charts in Belgium, Canada, Denmark, Finland, France, Norway and Sweden. It was also nominated for a Grammy in the category of Best Dance Recording.\n\nIn January 2009, Spears and her father James obtained a restraining order against her former manager Sam Lutfi, ex-boyfriend Adnan Ghalib and attorney Jon Eardley — all of whom, court documents claim, had been conspiring to gain control of Spears’s affairs. The restraining order forbids Lutfi and Ghalib from contacting Spears or coming within 250 yards of her, her property or family members. Spears embarked on The Circus Starring Britney Spears in March 2009. With a gross of U.S. $131.8 million, it became the fifth highest grossing tour of the year.\n\nIn November 2009, Spears released her second greatest hits album, The Singles Collection. The album’s lead and only single, “3” became her third number one single in the U.S. In May 2010, Spears’s representatives confirmed she was dating her agent Jason Trawick, and that they had decided to end their professional relationship to focus on their personal relationship. Spears designed a limited edition clothing line for Candie’s, which was released in stores in July 2010. In September 2010, she made a cameo appearance on a Spears-themed tribute episode of American TV show Glee, titled “Britney/Brittany”. The episode drew Glee’s highest ratings ever.\n\n2011 – 2012\n\nIn March 2011, Spears released her seventh studio album Femme Fatale. The album peaked at number one in the United States, Canada, and Australia, and peaked inside the top ten on nearly every other chart. Its peak in the United States ties Britney with Mariah Carey and Janet Jackson for the third-most number ones among women. It has sold 1,000,000 copies in the United States and 2.2 million worldwide, and has been certified platinum by the RIAA.\n\nThe album’s lead single “Hold It Against Me” debuted at number-one on the Billboard Hot 100, becoming Spears’s fourth number-one single on the chart and making her the second artist in history to have two consecutive singles debut at number one, after Mariah Carey. The second single “Till the World Ends” reached peaked at number three on the Billboard Hot 100 in May, while the third single “I Wanna Go” reached number seven in August. Femme Fatale became Spears’s first album in which three of its songs reached the top ten of the chart. The fourth and final single “Criminal” was released in September 2011. The music video caused controversy when British politicians criticized Spears for using replica guns while filming the video in an area of London that had been badly affected by the 2011 England riots. Spears’s management briefly responded, stating, “The video is a fantasy story featuring Britney’s boyfriend, Jason Trawick, which literally plays out the lyrics of a song written three years before the riots ever happened.” In April 2011, Spears appeared in a remix of Rihanna’s song “S&M”. It reached number one in the US later in the month, giving Spears her fifth number one on the chart. On Billboard‘s 2011 Year-End list, Spears was ranked number fourteen on the Artists of the Year, thirty-two on Billboard 200 artists and ten on Billboard Hot 100 artists.\n\nIn June 2011, Spears embarked on the Femme Fatale Tour. The first ten dates of the tour grossed $6.2 million, landing the fifty-fifth spot on Pollstar’s Top 100 North American Tours list for the half-way point of the year.

In August 2011, Spears received the MTV Video Vanguard Award at the 2011 MTV Video Music Awards. The next month, she released her second remix album, B in the Mix: The Remixes Vol. 2. In December, Spears became engaged to her long-time boyfriend Jason Trawick, who had formerly been her agent. Trawick became a co-conservator of Spears, alongside her father, in April 2012. In January 2013, Spears and Trawick ended their engagement. Trawick was also removed as Spears’s co-conservator, restoring her father as the sole conservator.\n\nIn May 2012, Spears was hired to replace Nicole Scherzinger as a judge for the second season of the U.S. version of The X Factor, joining Simon Cowell, L.A. Reid and fellow new judge Demi Lovato, who replaced Paula Abdul. With a reported salary of $15 million, she became the highest-paid judge on a singing competition series in television history. She mentored the Teens category; her final act, Carly Rose Sonenclar, was named the runner-up of the season. Spears did not return for the show’s third season and her spot was filled by Kelly Rowland. Spears was featured on will.i.am’s “Scream & Shout”, which was released as a single from his fourth studio album, #willpower (2013). The song later became Spears’s sixth number one single on the UK Singles Chart and peaked at #3 on US Billboard Hot 100. Scream & Shout was among the best selling songs of 2012 and 2013 with denoting sales of over 8.1 million worldwide, the accompanying music video was the third-most viewed video in 2013 on VEVO despite the video being released in 2012. In December, Forbes magazine named her music’s top-earning woman of 2012, with estimated earnings of $58 million.\n\n2013 – 2015\n\nSpears began work on her eighth studio album, Britney Jean, in December 2012, and enlisted will.i.am as its executive producer in May 2013. On September 17, 2013, she appeared on Good Morning America to announce her two-year residency show at Planet Hollywood Resort & Casino in Las Vegas, titled Britney: Piece of Me. It began on December 27, 2013, and will include a total of 100 shows throughout 2014 and 2015. During the same appearance, Spears announced that Britney Jean would be released on December 3, 2013, in the United States. It was released through RCA Records due to the disbandment of Jive Records in 2011. Britney Jean became Spears’s final project under her original recording contract with RCA, which had guaranteed the release of eight studio albums. The record received a low amount of promotion and had little commercial impact, reportedly due to contractual obligations for Britney: Piece of Me. Upon its release, the record debuted at number four on the U.S. Billboard 200 with first-week sales of 107,000 copies, becoming her lowest-peaking and lowest-selling album in the United States. Britney Jean debuted at number 34 on the UK Albums Chart, selling 12,959 copies in its first week. In doing so, it became Spears’s lowest-charting and lowest-selling album in the country.\n\n“Work Bitch” was released as the lead single from Britney Jean on September 16, 2013, one day earlier than expected after being leaked online. It debuted and peaked at number 12 on the U.S. Billboard Hot 100 marking Spears’s 31st song on the chart and the fifth highest debut of her career on the chart, and her seventh in the top 20. It also marked Spears’s 19th top 20 hit and overall her 23rd top 40 hit. It also entered the top 10 on the U.S Billboard Hot Digital Songs chart at number 6 and debuted at number 2 on both the U.S. Billboard chart’s Hot Dance Club Songs and Hot Dance/Electronic Songs.

The song also charted well in several other countries, peaking within the top ten of the charts in Brazil, Canada, France, Italy, Mexico, Spain and South Korea.\n\nThe second single “Perfume” premiered on November 3, 2013, two days earlier than originally announced. It debuted and peaked at number 76 on the U.S. Billboard Hot 100. “Perfume” also charted on the U.S. Billboard Pop Songs chart, it debuted at number 37, reaching number 22 weeks later.

In August 2014, Spears confirmed she had renewed her contract with RCA, and that she is writing and recording new music for her next album. Spears announced through her Twitter account in August 2014 that she would be releasing an intimate apparel titled “The Intimate Britney Spears”.

The company now ships to over 200 countries including Australia and New Zealand.

The song debuted and peaked at number 29 on the Billboard Hot 100 and charted moderately in international territories.

Entertainment Weekly praised the performance, noting “Spears gave one of her most energetic televised performances in years.” On June 16, 2015, Giorgio Moroder released his album, Deja Vu, that featured Spears on “Tom’s Diner”.

On March 1, 2016, V magazine announced that Spears would appear on the cover of its 100th issue, dated March 8, 2016, in addition to revealing three different covers shot by photographer Mario Testino for the milestone publication. Editor-in-chief of the magazine, Stephen Gan, revealed that Spears was selected for the “V100″ issue because of her status as an icon in the industry. On the decision, Gan stated, “who in our world did not grow up listening to her music?” In May 2016, Spears launched a casual role-play gaming application titled Britney Spears: American Dream.

Rolling Stone magazine wrote: “One of the most controversial and successful female vocalists of the 21st century,” she “spearheaded the rise of post-millennial teen pop … Spears early on cultivated a mixture of innocence and experience that broke the bank”. She is listed by the Guinness World Recordsas having the “Best-selling album by a teenage solo artist” for her debut album …Baby One More Time which sold over thirteen million copies in the United States. Melissa Ruggieri of the Richmond Times-Dispatch reported: “She’s also marked for being the best-selling teenage artist. Before she turned 20 in 2001, Spears sold more than 37 million albums worldwide”.\n\nAs of 2011, she has sold over 100 million records worldwide, making her one of the best-selling music artists of all time based on album sales alone. She was also ranked as the fourth VH1’s “50 Greatest Women of the Video Era” show list, ahead of most of her contemporaries and only behind veterans Madonna, Janet Jackson, and Whitney Houston. Spears is also recognized as the best-selling female artist of the first decade of the 21st century, as well as the fifth overall. In December 2009, Billboard magazine ranked Spears the 8th Artist of the 2000s decade in the United States.\n\nOn July 2016, Billboard and Nielsen Music reported that Britney has sold 33.4 million albums in the U.S., becoming the 17th-best-selling album artist since Nielsen began tracking sales in 1991. Among women, she’s fourth, after Mariah Carey (55 million), Celine Dion (52.6 million) and Shania Twain (34.7 million). After Spears, Reba McEntire rounds out the top five among women (30.5 million). (More info here)\n\nOn August it was reported that in the U.S. alone, Spears has sold more than 70 million albums, singles and digital songs, according to Nielsen Music.\n\nSpears is known for her iconic performances and music videos. The music video for her debut single, “…Baby One More Time”, was ranked number one on TRL’s Final Countdown of the most iconic music videos. At the 2000 MTV Video Music Awards, before performing “Oops!… I Did It Again”, the singer appeared behind a backlit screen, and descended a spiral staircase and started performing “(I Can’t Get No) Satisfaction”, while wearing a tuxedo. After performing a shortened version of the track, she tore the tuxedo off, revealing a skin-tight flesh-coloured outfit. The following year, Spears performed her single “I’m a Slave 4 U”. Jocelyn Vena of MTV summarized the performance, saying, “draping herself in a white python and slithering around a steamy garden setting – surrounded by dancers in zebra and tiger outfits – Spears created one of the most striking visuals in the 27-year history of the show.”\n\nShe also duetted “The Way You Make Me Feel” with pop singer Michael Jackson at his 30th anniversary concert a few days earlier. During the opening of the 2003 MTV Video Music Awards on August 28, 2003, Spears joined Madonna, Christina Aguilera, and Missy Elliott. Halfway through the performance, Madonna kissed Spears and Aguilera on the lips. The kiss between Spears and Madonna generated strong reaction from the media. This performance was listed by Blender magazine as one of the twenty-five sexiest music moments on television history. MTV listed the performance as the number-one opening moments in the history of MTV Video Music Awards.\n\nBarbara Ellen of The Observer wrote: “Spears is famously one of the ‘oldest’ teenagers pop has ever produced, almost middle aged in terms of focus and determination. Many 19-year-olds haven’t even started working by that age, whereas Britney, a former Mouseketeer, was that most unusual and volatile of American phenomena — a child with a full-time career. While other little girls were putting posters on their walls, Britney was wanting to be the poster on the wall. Whereas other children develop at their own pace, Britney was developing at a pace set by the ferociously competitive American entertainment industry”.\n\nIn 2011, Adam Markovitz of Entertainment Weekly commented on the cultural significance of Spears’s voice and music: “We don’t ask a whole lot from Britney Spears as an entertainer…we’ll still send her straight up the charts simply because she’s Britney. She’s an American institution, as deeply sacred and messed up as pro wrestling or the filibuster. Musically, though, Spears will always have to measure up to her own gold standards of pop euphony: the operatic slither of 2004’s ‘Toxic’ and the candied funk of 2000’s ‘Oops!…I Did It Again.’ Spears is no technical singer, that’s for sure. But backed by Martin and Dr. Luke’s wall of pound, her vocals melt into a mix of babytalk coo and coital panting that is, in its own overprocessed way, just as iconic and propulsive as Michael Jackson’s yips or Eminem’s snarls.” ‘Britney Spears’ was Yahoo!’s most popular search term between 2005 and 2008, and has been in a total of seven different years. Spears was named as Most Searched Person in the Guinness World Records book edition 2007 and 2009. She was later named as the most searched person of the decade 2000 – 2009.\n\nSpears has been cited as a musical inspiration by contemporary artists. Gwyneth Paltrow’s character in 2010 drama film Country Strong was inspired on the singer’s public meltdown. According to film director Shana Fest, “that’s where this movie came from. I mean, I was seeing what was happening in the media to Britney Spears. I think it’s tragic how we treat people who give us so much, and we love to see them knocked down to build them back up again, to knock them down again.” Nicki Minaj has cited Spears as a major influence on her career, and commented, “the fact that she came back out with just so much fire inspires me, and it inspires young women and people all over the world. It just inspires you. A lot of my fans feel like they are the underdog and feel like they are the people who aren’t ever accepted for themselves, or who are laughed at or poked fun at forever. It just goes to show that once you keep at whatever it is you’re doing, people may not like you, people may not love you, but they will have to respect you at the end of the day. And that respect is all that matters.”\n\nLana Del Rey said: “I’m not really interested in a ton of female musicians but there is something about Britney that compelled me – the way she sings and just the way she looks.” Del Rey also said that the music video for “Toxic” inspires her. During the 2011 MTV Video Music Awards, Lady Gaga said that Spears “taught us all how to be fearless, and the industry wouldn’t be the same without her.” Gaga has also cited Spears as an influence, calling her “the most provocative performer of my time”. Miley Cyrus credits Spears as her biggest inspiration, and has referenced the singer in her hit song “Party in the U.S.A.” (2009). Spears’s personal breakdown was also cited as an inspiration for Barry Manilow’s album 15 Minutes.\n\nMusical style\n\nFollowing her debut, Spears was credited with leading the revival of teen pop in the late 1990s. The Daily Yomiuri reported that “[m]usic critics have hailed her as the most gifted teenage pop idol for many years, but Spears has set her sights a little higher-she is aiming for the level of superstardom that has been achieved by Madonna and Janet Jackson.” Rob Sheffield of Rolling Stone wrote: “Britney Spears carries on the classic archetype of the rock & roll teen queen, the dungaree doll, the angel baby who just has to make a scene.” Following the release of her debut album, Chuck Taylor of Billboard observed, “Spears has become a consummate performer, with snappy dance moves, a clearly real-albeit young-and funkdified voice … “(You Drive Me) Crazy”, her third single … demonstrates Spears’s own development, proving that the 17-year-old is finding her own vocal personality after so many months of steadfast practice.” Stephen Thomas Erlewine of Allmusic referred to her music as a “blend of infectious, rap-inflected dance-pop and smooth balladry.”\n\nOops!…I Did It Again and subsequent albums saw Spears working with several contemporary R&B producers, leading to “a combination of bubblegum, urban soul, and raga.” Her third studio album, Britney derived from the teen pop niche, “[r]hythmically and melodically … sharper, tougher than what came before. What used to be unabashedly frothy has some disco grit, underpinned by Spears’ spunky self-determination that helps sell hooks that are already catchier, by and large, than those that populated her previous two albums.”\n\nSince In the Zone, Spears has explored and heavily incorporated the genres of electropop and dance music in her albums, as well as influences of urban and hip hop musicwhich are most present in In the Zone and Blackout. She has also experimented with genres such as dubstep, first on Blackout’s “Freakshow” and again on “Hold It Against Me” from Femme Fatale.\n\nVocals\n\nSpears possesses a soprano vocal range of three octaves and two notes. Prior to her breakthrough success, she is described as having sung “much deeper than her highly recognizable trademark voice of today”, with Eric Foster White, who worked with Spears for her debut album …Baby One More Time, being cited as “[shaping] her voice over the course of a month” upon being signed to Jive Records “to where it is today—distinctively, unmistakably Britney”. Rami Yacoub who co-produced Spears’s debut album with lyricist Max Martin, commented, “I know from Denniz Pop and Max’s previous productions, when we do songs, there’s kind of a nasal thing. With N’ Sync and the Backstreet Boys, we had to push for that mid-nasal voice. When Britney did that, she got this kind of raspy, sexy voice.”"
