        "text": "“The 13-year-old girl’s mother is livid that [LeAnn] would dare say Carly Rose was ‘nervous and had trouble hitting the right notes’ when she sang ‘How Do I Live,'” a source tells TMZ.\n\nOn Dec. 19, Carly Rose performed a shaky duet with LeAnn, who our staff writer Sharon Tharp described as “one big, hot mess.” Social media went crazy, claiming LeAnn was drunk on stage.\n\nTMZ originally reported that LeAnn’s rep denied the accusations, saying, “[LeAnn] was trying to help this 13-year-old girl who was having some trouble with the song.” However, LeAnn’s camp later denied ever releasing a statement.\n\nLeAnn then tweeted, “It was an amazing opportunity to share this experience with Carly and I know I’ll be watching for her to win tonight.”\n\nUnfortunately, Carly Rose did not win and now her family is reportedly blaming the country crooner’s botched performance for overshadowing their daughter’s reputation on the show.\n\nLeAnn allegedly made a plate of food backstage and spilled it EVERYWHERE, TMZ further reports, but the singer insists she was completely sober.\n\nWhat do YOU think, HollywoodLifers? Is LeAnn to blame for Carly’s loss?\n\nWATCH: X Factor Season 2 Finale Performances!\n\n— Chris Rogers\n\nFollow\n\n@ChrisRogers86\n\nMore ‘X Factor’ News:"
