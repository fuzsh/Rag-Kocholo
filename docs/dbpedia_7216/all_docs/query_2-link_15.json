Auditions for the show began in May 2012 and concluded in July 2012. The show is hosted by reality star Khloé Kardashian and Extra host Mario Lopez, replacing Steve Jones from the previous year. Simon Cowell and L.A. Reid returned as judges, while Paula Abdul and Nicole Scherzinger were replaced by Britney Spears and Demi Lovato.\n\nJudges and hosts\n\n[edit]\n\nOn January 9, 2012, Fox announced that The X Factor would undergo some changes for its second season. On January 30, it was confirmed that host Steve Jones and judges Nicole Scherzinger[3][4] and Paula Abdul[5] would not be returning for the second season. Following Scherzinger's departure, she transferred to the UK show to replace Kelly Rowland as a judge for the 2012 UK series. On February 6, Simon Cowell and L.A. Reid were the only confirmed judges for season 2.[citation needed] Prior to her death, Whitney Houston was approached as a potential replacement judge.[6] It was also reported that Cowell was in talks with Britney Spears for her to join the show, reportedly offering her $15 million.[7] On May 9, reports surfaced that Spears officially signed on to judge the show.[8] It was also rumored that Demi Lovato and Miley Cyrus were in talks to be the second replacement judge.[9] Lovato reportedly signed the deal on May 13, making her the youngest ever X Factor judge.[10][11] The following day, it was officially confirmed that Spears and Lovato would join The X Factor as the two newest judges.[12] When asked about the new judges, Cowell said:\n\nI'm absolutely delighted Britney and Demi are joining us. Britney remains one of the biggest stars in the world, she's talented, fascinating – and I believe she knows exactly how to spot the X factor. Demi's had an amazing career in music, TV and film for someone her age. She's young, confident, and enthusiastic. I think it's really important that she speaks to our younger audience.[13] The new panel will be dynamic and will work really well with the changes we are making to the show.\"[14]\n\nSeason 2 hosts\n\nOn June 26, 2012, Cowell confirmed that in his search for a new host he had narrowed the possibilities to five candidates.[15] On June 29, Cowell revealed that there would be one male and one female host, and neither of them had hosted before.[16][17] People considered for hosting slots included Stacy Keibler, Mario Lopez, Khloé Kardashian, Kelly Osbourne, Terrence J, Erin Andrews, and Mike Catherwood.[18] It was also reported that Glee star Kevin McHale was in talks for the male hosting position.[19] According to then-recent reports, Kardashian, McHale, and Nick Jonas were the front runners to host the show.[20][21][22] On October 15, 2012, it was officially confirmed by E! News that Kardashian had officially signed on as co-host for the show, with Lopez close to signing a deal and was later confirmed as co-host the next day.[23][24]\n\nIrish music manager and The X Factor UK judge Louis Walsh filled in for Cowell at the Kansas City auditions while Cowell was recovering from bronchitis.[citation needed] On August 27, it was reported that Nick Jonas had signed a deal to help Lovato at judges' houses.[25] It was later reported that Justin Bieber would be helping Reid, Marc Anthony helping Cowell, and will.i.am helping Spears.[26]\n\nThis was the final season to feature L.A. Reid as a judge, after he announced that he was quitting the show in order to concentrate on other projects.[27]\n\nSelection process\n\n[edit]\n\nAuditions\n\n[edit]\n\nThe producers' auditions began on March 14, 2012 at the Sprint Center in Kansas City, Missouri. More producers' auditions were held on March 22 at the Frank Erwin Center in Austin, Texas, April 20 at the Cow Palace in San Francisco, California, May 1 at the Greensboro Coliseum in Greensboro, North Carolina and concluded on May 10 at the Dunkin' Donuts Center in Providence, Rhode Island.\n\nThe judges' auditions took place between May and July. The auditions went without a host as they had yet to hire new hosts by the time auditions started.\n\nSummary of judges' auditions City Date Venue Date aired Judges Austin, Texas May 24–25, 2012 Frank Erwin Center September 12 & 19, 2012 Reid Spears Lovato Cowell Kansas City, Missouri June 8–9, 2012 Sprint Center September 19, 2012 Walsh San Francisco, California June 16–18, 2012 Cow Palace September 12–13, 19, & 26-27 2012 Cowell Providence, Rhode Island June 27–29, 2012 Dunkin' Donuts Center September 12–13 & 26, 2012 Greensboro, North Carolina July 8–10, 2012 Greensboro Coliseum September 20, & 26-27 2012\n\nBootcamp\n\n[edit]\n\nFilming for bootcamp was held on July 25–27, 2012 in Miami. As with the auditions, there were no hosts at bootcamp.\n\n120 contestants made it to the Bootcamp stage. At bootcamp the contestants had to perform two tasks. Task 1 involved the contestants had to sing solo, after which the judges eliminated half of the acts, bringing the total down to 60. In Task 2 the contestants were paired up to perform together. After Task 2 the judges narrowed down the acts to the 24 who progress on to the Judges's homes round.\n\nThe groups Fifth Harmony, Playback, and LYRIC 145 were formed from eliminated contestants from the Teens, Young Adults and Groups categories in bootcamp. Fifth Harmony was known as LYLAS at this stage; their name was changed after they made the top 16 when a group consisting of four of Bruno Mars' sisters, called \"The Lylas\", claimed the show stole their name.[28] Their name changed again for the Top 13 performances, as their mentor Simon Cowell was not in favor of the name 1432 and felt that the show's viewers could make a better name for the group.[29]\n\nJudges' houses\n\n[edit]\n\nThe judges' houses was filmed September 28 & 29, 2012. The judges received news of their categories from the producers by telephone, seen during the third bootcamp episode on October 10.

The second before Lovato appeared to give her response, she pushed Cowell to vote before her as he was asked first but Lopez told Lovato the show was pressed for time and Cowell objected. Lovato voted against Thomas and then Cowell voted against Garcia. In an interview after the show, Cowell said he already intended to vote against Garcia and persisted to have Lovato vote before him because he knew if he voted before Lovato that she would not have to vote, was curious as to who Lovato wanted to save and thought the audience wanted to know who Lovato was going to vote against.\n\nHowever, voting statistics revealed that Garcia received more votes than Thomas which meant that if the result went to deadlock, Garcia would have been saved.\n\nWeek 4 (November 21/22)\n\n[edit]\n\nTheme: Thanksgiving[52]\n\nGroup performance: \"Fix You\" (with Bancroft Middle School choir)[citation needed]\n\nMusical guests: Cher Lloyd featuring Becky G (\"Oath\")[32][33]\n\nActs' performances on the fourth live show Act Category (mentor) Order Song[53] Result[41] Tate Stevens Over 25s (Reid) 1 \"I'm Already There\" Safe Diamond White Teens (Spears) 2 \"Because You Loved Me\" Emblem3 Groups (Cowell) 3 \"Secrets\" Arin Ray Teens (Spears) 4 \"Hero\" Eliminated CeCe Frey Young Adults (Lovato) 5 \"Wind Beneath My Wings\" Bottom Three Fifth Harmony Groups (Cowell) 6 \"I'll Stand by You\" Safe Beatrice Miller Teens (Spears) 7 \"Chasing Cars\" Bottom Three Vino Alan Over 25s (Reid) 8 \"God Bless the USA\" Safe Paige Thomas Young Adults (Lovato) 9 \"Everytime\" Carly Rose Sonenclar Teens (Spears) 10 \"Over the Rainbow\" Safe (Highest Votes) Final showdown details[41] CeCe Frey Young Adults (Lovato) 1 \"Because of You\" Safe Beatrice Miller Teens (Spears) 2 \"White Flag\" Eliminated\n\nJudges' votes to eliminate[41]\n\nLovato: Beatrice Miller – gave no reason, though effectively backed their own act, CeCe Frey.\n\nSpears: CeCe Frey – gave no reason, though effectively backed her own act, Beatrice Miller.\n\nReid: Beatrice Miller – gave no reason.\n\nCowell: Beatrice Miller – thought the competition was \"all getting too much for\" Miller and that the then-present time was not \"the right time for\" her.\n\nHowever, voting statistics revealed that Miller received more votes than Frey which meant that if Cowell sent the result to deadlock, Miller would have been saved.\n\nWeek 5 (November 28/29)\n\n[edit]\n\nTheme: Number-ones[54]\n\nMusical guests: Josh Krajcik (\"One Thing She’ll Never Know\") and Alicia Keys (\"Girl on Fire\")[34]\n\nMusic video premiere: will.i.am featuring Britney Spears (\"Scream & Shout\")[35]\n\nActs' performances on the fifth live show Act Category (mentor) Order Song[55] Result[42] Diamond White Teens (Spears) 1 \"I Wanna Dance with Somebody (Who Loves Me)\" Bottom Three Vino Alan Over 25s (Reid) 2 \"You've Lost That Lovin' Feelin'\" Paige Thomas Young Adults (Lovato) 3 \"Never Gonna Give You Up\" Eliminated Fifth Harmony Groups (Cowell) 4 \"Stronger (What Doesn't Kill You)\" Safe Carly Rose Sonenclar Teens (Spears) 5 \"Rolling in the Deep\" Safe (Highest Votes) Tate Stevens Over 25s (Reid) 6 \"Somebody Like You\" Safe CeCe Frey Young Adults (Lovato) 7 \"Lady Marmalade\" Emblem3 Groups (Cowell) 8 \"I'm a Believer\" Final showdown details[42] Diamond White Teens (Spears) 1 \"I Was Here\" Safe Vino Alan Over 25s (Reid) 2 \"Trouble\" Eliminated\n\nJudges' votes to eliminate[42]\n\nReid: Diamond White – backed his own act, Vino Alan.\n\nSpears: Vino Alan – backed her own act, Diamond White.\n\nLovato: Vino Alan – gave no reason.\n\nCowell: Vino Alan – gave no reason.\n\nWeek 6: Quarter-Final (December 5/6)\n\n[edit]\n\nThemes: Unplugged songs; Pepsi Challenge songs[56]\n\nMusical guests: Melanie Amaro (\"Long Distance\")[57] and Kesha (\"C'Mon\")[36]\n\nFor the first time this season, each act performed two songs.

This was due to the fact that the game was halted and rescheduled later in the day due to a rain delay, to be played concurrently with The X Factor.[109] Between the two, Fox decided to air the game instead of the rest of the episode. Many viewers took to the internet and called Fox to complain about the interruption. Cowell even took to his Twitter to comment that: \"It's what's known as a total f up.\" The show instead aired the following week in its entirety.\n\n\"Rejected\" votes of Paige Thomas\n\n[edit]\n\nDuring the fifth live show in November, many voters reported of having their votes \"rejected\" and their calls cut off when attempting to vote for Paige Thomas; Thomas was eliminated the following night. Fox and The X Factor affiliates have not confirmed or denied whether this had anything to do with Thomas' subsequent elimination the following night.\n\nDon Philip audition\n\n[edit]\n\nIn the season two premiere, Don Philip, who once collaborated with Britney Spears on her debut album, auditioned in front of the judges, and received a \"no\" from all judges. He then told Access Hollywood that ten minutes of footage from the interview was edited out because he felt like the judges bullied him into revealing that he is gay.[110] Spears reportedly replied \"I think it’s fine you’re gay,\" though this was edited out as well.[111] Fox then released a statement saying:\n\n\"The judges were not given any information at all about Mr. Philip prior to his audition. The personal information that Mr. Philip quickly volunteered at the start of his audition was a surprise to the judges, who asked what had happened during the past 10 years, as they were interested in Mr. Philip’s career. While we understand his decision to discuss his personal life, Mr. Philip’s sexual orientation was not something that any of the judges or producers felt was relevant to this audition. When advertising and promoting open auditions, thousands of people are informed about the ways to enter the show. Mr. Philip himself chose to enter for a chance to win a five million dollar recording contract.\"[112]\n\nLater that year, an insider revealed that he was contacted specifically by producers because of his association with Spears, and that according to him, \"she already knew he was going to be there, of course, because this is a reality show\".[113]\n\nReferences\n\n[edit]"
