        "text": "Demi Lovato wasn't the only one who decided to be \"straight-up honest\" about The X Factor's top four performances on Wednesday night.\n\nBackstage after the show, Tate Stevens proved refreshingly candid when offering up critiques of the other contestants, who'd taken to the stage for two songs each in an effort to make it into next week's finale. \"I really believe Emblem3 stepped it up tonight,\" the country crooner said of the laid-back Cali band, who earned raves from the judges for both \"Baby, I Love Your Way\" and \"Hey Jude.\" \"It was Emblem3's night. Fifth Harmony, as good as they are, they sang a song they'd already sung [Shontelle's \"Impossible\"].\""
