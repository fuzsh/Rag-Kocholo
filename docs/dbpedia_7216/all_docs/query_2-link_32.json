        "text": "Carly Rose Sonenclar, the 13-year-old singing phenom from Mamaroneck, earned second place on the second season of \"The X Factor.\"\n\nTate Stevens, the 37-year-old country singer from Missouri, received the most votes, beating out Carly Rose and third-place finishers Fifth Harmony for the grand prize, which includes a $5 million recording contract and a spot in a new Pepsi TV commercial that will air during the 2013 Grammy Awards.\n\nWhen Stevens heard his name announced as the winner, his first words were that \"first and foremost, I had to thank the man upstairs for taking care of me,\" followed by gratitude expressed toward his family and fans.\n\nCarly Rose graciously gave Stevens a hug after his victory, and although she was teary-eyed, her mentor Britney Spears seemed more emotional about the outcome.\n\nAt a private viewing party in Harrison on Thursday night, Carly Rose's friends, fans and supporters cheered her on throughout the show and expressed disappointment that she came in second. But that sadness soon turned to optimism as the crowd agreed she is destined to get a record deal after her \"X Factor\" run.\n\nMamaroneck Mayor Norm Rosenblum was among those at the party. \"I'm a little disappointed but extremely proud of Carly. She represents the best of the village of Mamaroneck.\n\n\"As far as I'm concerned, she's already an international star,\" Rosenblum added. \"She has all the attributes of a star -- talent and a beautiful personality.\"\n\nBefore the show, Harrison resident Brett Quigley, 22, shared his thoughts on the singer. \"I think Carly Rose is really talented and fresh to the music industry. She'll be a fresh take on a teenage singer ... Carly Rose has a magnetic charisma to her and she also has undeniable talent.\"\n\nWith Georgette Yacoub"
