        "text": "In Part two of our sit-down with the versatile actress Tamara Clatterbuck, we begin with the high-energy segment “Haute Topics” and we touch on the headlines of Mama June, Billy Ray Cyrus and Courtney Stodden engaging in a lively critique, setting the stage for the dynamic discussion ahead. The trio then delves into a critical topic for child actors: Coogan accounts. These accounts are designed to protect the earnings of young performers from misuse by their parents. Tamara shares her belief in karma, encapsulating her philosophy with the phrase, “what goes around comes around.” This segues into a lighter segment with inquiries about Tamara's thoughts on Courtney Stodden allegedly flushing a 5-carat diamond ring down the toilet. The conversation takes an intriguing turn as Tamara reflects on being compared to Miley Cyrus. She recounts how some people believe she resembles Miley and discusses the possibility of playing Miley's mother in a film. This opens a broader discussion about the intricacies of working in Hollywood, the pressures of public scrutiny, and the emotional toll of personal relationships in the limelight. The episode then transitions into the “Runway Rundown” segment, where Patrik and Pol' critique various red carpet looks. They provide insightful and entertaining commentary on celebrity fashion, including Tamara's own red-carpet appearances. Their playful banter and expert opinions offer a blend of humor and industry knowledge, making for a captivating time. Tamara shares an intimate part of her life by discussing her past relationship with performer Weird Al Yankovic. She reveals her appreciation for humor and funny people, adding her personal touch to the episode. The conversation shifts as Patrik and Tamara discuss her Emmy nomination and the intricacies of choosing the perfect dress for the red carpet. Pol' offers valuable fashion advice, emphasizing the importance of confidence and how trends in red carpet attire have evolved. The episode reaches an emotional climax with a poignant coffee reading by Pol'. He provides deep insights into Tamara's past and present, encouraging her to release old burdens and embrace new beginnings. This reading resonates deeply with Tamara, leading to a heartfelt discussion about personal growth and healing. The episode concludes with Patrik and Pol sharing personal anecdotes and reflecting on the transformative experience of the coffee reading. This is another Hurrdat Media Production.

Courtney broke national headlines back in 2011 when at 16 years old they married 51 year old Doug Hutchison. At the time, Courtney received endless online hate and negative media coverage. Courtney, a child, received death threats, was stalked by the paparazzi, sexualized, and labeled a whore. Courtney is now 27 years old, has gotten into therapy, and started their recovery journey. This is a story of child abuse that began 10 years ago and after finalizing their divorce in 2020, Courtney is now beginning to process what it means to be a survivor. This episode discusses adult subject matter, including descriptions of sexual abuse of a child, and is intended for adult consumption only. Listener discretion is advised.

It was the year the Free Britney movement captivated the world and Paris Hilton's legacy and rise to fame was told in a whole new, and much darker, way than ever before. We started asking questions about what really happened to Amanda Bynes and took a closer look at why the world had turned against Lindsay Lohan. But in a year where we obsessed about celebrity ‘bad' girls having redemption arcs, we also became hungry for a different type of story. A story where former Hollywood 'good' girls like Chrissy Teigen and Ellen DeGeneres were held to account and we appeared to revel in their downfalls. In today's episode, we discuss how the stories around famous women have changed in 2021and what happens next.

In true Rope fashion, rather than figure out what is true, untrue and somewhere in between, we've gone right to the source to break it all down. Courtney first came into the public eye at age 16 when they married then 51 year old Doug Hutchison in 2011. Courtney talks about what living with such strict media attention and judgement was like at such a young age. In other words, being trolled before trolling was a thing. We chat with Courtney about Britney Spears and how similar their own situation was, married at 16, to the conservatorship that Britney is now living with each day. The constant media attention earned them and their then husband a place on the second season of the VH1 hit, “Couples Therapy” along with famous co-stars such as your RHONY favs Alex and Simon van Kempen. We discuss! Courtney chats about their many other reality TV appearances on shows like Celebrity Big Brother and let us not forget that 50 Cent video they were in. Sort of! We can explain! Courtney chats about fame, the potential addiction to fame, living a life in the public eye, their public persona versus the real Courtney Stodden, the various and constant misconceptions about them and whether they is “in on the joke”. Having just had their 26th birthday, Courtney looks back on the past ten years and discusses their decision to divorce their then husband. Of course, we discuss the headlines Courtney made recently regarding their “relationship” with 90210's Brian Austin Green, their public “demise” and the involvement of both Megan Fox and Vanessa Marcil. Courtney also chats about their recent coming out as Non-Binary in the hopes of living a more authentic life. Courtney also chats about others who have slid into their DMs such as, wait for it, Courtney Love! Finally, they chat about being cyber-bullied by Chrissy Teigen, the long term effects that has had on them and what they would say to Chrissy Teigen if they came face to face today. @courtneyastodden @behindvelvetrope @davidyontef Bonus Episodes Available at - https://www.patreon.com/behindthevelvetrope Brought to you by OMAZE - https://omaze.com/velvetrope (Receive 20 Extra Entries When You Enter Code “Velvetrope” Brought to you by ROTHY'S - https://www.rothys.com/velvet ($20 Off Your First Purchase) Merch Available at - https://www.teepublic.com/stores/behind-the-velvet-rope?ref_id=13198 Learn more about your ad choices.

And why isn't Tom Girardi's shady connections to Democratic politicians like Gavin Newsom being discussed more by the media and viewers? Jacques and special guest Zack Peter break down the facts, fiction, and pure delusion surrounding Erika and her haters. They also get into the crazy story about Nicki Minaj and her husband Kenny Petty ~allegedly~ harassing the woman Kenny assaulted when he was a teenager and whether or not the media's overnight support of the victim has anything to do with Nicki's v*x hesitancy. They also get into Jenny McCarthy previous v-word stance and whether or not she was smeared by the media at the time. Lastly, Courtney Stodden has come out against Trisha Paytas, but is she just clout chasing? (Yes, she is.) For more content, subscribe to Unpopular on Patreon!

In part 2 of our Chrissy Teigen deep dive, hosts Kiki Monique, Mohanad Elshieky, and Hoja Lopez chronicle the downfall of Chrissy: from her feud with chef Alison Roman, to beefing with QAnon conspiracy theorists, to the Courtney Stodden cyberbullying scandal. They unpack Chrissy’s numerous, lengthy apologies, and answer once and for all: Is Chrissy Teigen canceled? Please note, I’m Sorry contains mature themes and may not be appropriate for all listeners.

Chrissy, the Queen of Clapback on Twitter, has millions of followers thanks to her quick come-backs and sheer genius replies (when twitter feuding with a comedian she replied \"much like your career, I have no comeback. You win!\"). But in March of 2021, the negativity and endless trolling in Twitter got to Chrissy and she decided to quit forever and live in a gentler, troll-free, world. That's when Courtney spoke up...back in 2011, Chrissy Teigen cyber-bullied then 16 year old Courtney Stodden with name calling and encouraging suicide. Much of the harassment was public, but some of it was direct messaging. Chrissy Teigen, a 26 year old successful model, publicly tweeted a troubled 16 year old with slut shaming and suggestions to \"go. to sleep. forever.\" The direct messages were worse, and though unverified, if true, say things like \"I can't wait for you to die\" and straight out suggest for Courtney to kill themself (Courtney has recently come out as non-binary). Chrissy's own trolling is catching up with her, but she's escaped such issues in the past. Is this time different? Is Chrissy being canceled or suffering the consequences of her actions? It wasn't just Chrissy who attacked a helpless teenager, Anderson Cooper, Joy Behar, and even Courtney Love (remember her?) but Chrissy seems to have been the only one to wish death upon a teenager. Note to our non-binary listeners: we tried and tripped countless times when using pronouns to speak about Courtney's story. We misgendered them a number of times, and while we acknowledge our errors during recording, we still failed to live up to our own standards of respect. Our heartfelt acknowledgement of this issue with apologies, and a promise to try better. TEIGEN UPDATE: Macy's has stopped carrying Chrissy's cookware line as of May 18, 2021. You may hear that Target also stopped carrying Chrissy's \"Cravings\" line, but that was a deal that ended in December 2020, long before this story became public.\n\nIt's so exciting for us to finally be joined by Beth and Amy, the sisters behind longtime supporter of the podcast, Greenwich Letterpress! It's such a delight to discuss the Halloween episode of Beverly Hills 90210 season five with them. Discussed on this episode: the Día de los Muertos movie Coco, the podcast Running From Cops, and Courtney Stodden's sexy pumpkin patch photoshoot, about which the Daily Mail notes, “The pair were eventually asked to leave the patch by security after they received several complaints from members of the public who found Courtney's attire offensive and her behaviour of a sexual nature.” This episode is brought to you by The Cocoa Fondue Show.
