        "text": "Simon Cowell called her \"a star in the making\" during her X-Factor audition, and the rest of the world agrees: At 13-years-old, Carly Rose Sonenclar has amassed a worldwide fanbase (known as \"Carly's Angels\") and, with more than 100 million views, has become a bona-fide YouTube sensation. Striking a balance between pop and soul, she's got a lot in the works: an album, a live show, and plenty of new music. And for any of you New York-based fans, check her out in concert on August 10th—pick up tickets here!\n\nWe had the chance to catch up with the singer despite her busy schedule. Read on to see what's next for Carly!\n\nYou've been super busy since X-Factor ended. What have you been up to?\n\nI've been in the studio! And I'll be doing concerts soon, which I'm really excited about. I'm in pre-production of my album, so right now I'm writing in-between putting my show together. I'm also doing some covers which are going on YouTube. So, yes—very busy!\n\nTake us all the way back to your X Factor audition. What was it like being told that a star was born after you walked onstage for the first time?\n\nIt was just very surreal. I couldn't believe it was actually happening to me, because I've grown up watching these types of shows and hearing the judges say stuff like that to the contestants. I always thought, \"Aw, I wish I could do that!\" so when it actually happened to me, it took a really long time to sink in.\n\nI can imagine! How was having Britney Spears as a mentor?\n\nReally amazing. She is so sweet, very humble, just a great person. But I also got to spend time with each of them—in particular, I remember having a moment with L.A. Reid. The judges had just told me that I wasn't having enough fun onstage, and the next week I was supposed to do \"It Will Rain\" by Bruno Mars, which is a slow ballad. I told L.A. that I was worried they would say the same thing, but he told me to pick one or the other, and really sell it. So, with a ballad, I'd have to really get the sadness and all of those feelings across. I've always remembered that—it was really helpful advice.\n\nSpeaking of advice, what would you tell teens who are getting their start in music, or who want to go for The X-Factor?\n\nDoing anything you possibly can to differentiate yourself is going to be really helpful. When I auditioned, I think people were expecting me to do a Top 40 song, but instead I did \"Feeling Good\" by Nina Simone, which was very unexpected. It really helped them remember me, and kept me from being put in a category that I didn't want to be in. I also play piano, which has helped me a lot with writing and covering songs—I can sit down and pump out the chords, read music, and kind of figure stuff out. So, I also say that anything that will help you continue pursuing music, even when you're not singing, is really helpful.\n\nSo, you've got an album in the works. Tell us about it!\n\nWell, it's in the early, early, early stages so I'm not 100% sure what my sound will be exactly. But my five inspirations are Bruno Mars, Adele, Ellie Goulding, Maroon 5, and Ed Sheeran. So, if you put them all together that will give you a hint.\n\nAnd what are you planning for your live show?\n\nWe're still working on the set list, but I want to do a good mix between the contemporary songs and the stuff that's a little more off the beaten path. That's kind of what I had going on X-Factor, and I don't think my fans want me to become a totally generic pop star. I like that contemporary, pop feel, but only to a point. I want to have a mix of Top 40 songs that everybody can sing along to, but also those songs that will make people say \"Oh, I don't know this one—I'm going to listen to it when I get home.\"\n\nBeing 13-years old, you've got a lot of younger fans. But your musical style applies to a much wider range of people—is that something you're keeping in mind?\n\nYeah, I'm very lucky to have an amazing fan base. It's a broad age group, going from my age to people in their 60s. It's kind of a hard balance trying to appeal to everyone while still staying current, but it's exciting.\n\nLet's talk fashion. You're a rapidly rising star—has your style evolved since you first started?\n\nDefinitely. I've had the chance to work with some amazing designers, from the people who did my wardrobe for X-Factor and the stylists on the photo shoots that I've done—even designers from my hometown whom I work with. I've definitely gotten a better sense of style—I hope! Right now, it's pretty boho, but I do like edgier stuff, too. One day I'd even like to have my own clothing line.\n\nWhat makes you interested in fashion?\n\nPeople judge you on what you're wearing. It's weird to think about, but it's also cool because it's a great way to express yourself—and to set yourself apart."
