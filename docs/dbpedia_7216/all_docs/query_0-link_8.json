This Evanston, Illinois native always dreamed of having a singing, broadcasting, and acting career as a child. Fisher grew up performing in front of her family, neighborhood friends, local theaters, and also sang in school plays and showcases along with her two siblings. Graduating at the top of her class and heading to college at the tender age of 16, Fisher was destined for greatness. The tall, sleek, and elegant nearly 5'9 small framed Honor Roll Society member, was stopped in the mall by a talent agent from the Ford Robert Black modeling agency in Arizona.

Her ancestry includes primarily Germans and Italians. She has had several recurring roles in television series. Her most notable role so far was that of supporting character Daisy Wick in the police procedural \"Bones\". Her character was an impulsive intern with a habit of non-stop talking. Gallo played this role for nearly a decade, from 2008 to 2017.\n\nGallo received her college education at Cornell University, a research university located in Ithaca, New York. She graduated with a degree in theater. She made her film debut in the black comedy film \"Spanking the Monkey\" (1994). She portrayed Toni Peck, the adolescent girlfriend of protagonist Ray Aibelli (played by Jeremy Davies). Toni is unaware that her boyfriend has a sexual relationship with his own mother Susan Aibelli (played by Alberta Watson). Toni is surprised when a jealous Susan attacks and injures her, in retaliation for sleeping with Ray. The film was a minor box office hit, earning 1,4 million dollars at the box office. That was about 7 times the size of the film's budget.\n\nBy 1999, Gallo started appearing in guest roles in various television series. Her earliest appearances in television series included episodes of the police procedural \"Law & Order\" and the medical drama \"ER\". She gained her first recurring role in the sitcom \"Undeclared\" (2001-2002), which focused on the lives of college freshmen. Gallo portrayed Lizzie Exley, a neurotic psychology student. Lizzie served as the main love interest of protagonist Steven Karp (Jay Baruchel), despite the fact that she was already dating an older man. The questionable nature of Steven and Lizzie's relationship was one of the series' main subplots. The series received critical acclaim, but suffered from low ratings throughout its first and only season. It was ranked as the 93rd most viewed show of American television at the time.\n\nIn 2003, Gallo joined the cast of the dark fantasy television series \"Carnivàle\" (2003-2005). The series was set in the 1930s, and mainly depicted traveling performers at a carnival. Gallo played the dancer Libby Dreifuss, the elder of the two surviving daughters of striptease artist Rita Sue Dreifuss (played by Cynthia Ettinger) and her manager Felix \"Stumpy\" Dreifuss (played by Toby Huss). During the first season, Libby's role focused on her lesbian relationship with her only friend, the fortune-teller Sofie Bojakshiya (played by Clea DuVall). After Sofie discovers that Libby was keeping secrets from her, she berates Libby and ends their relationship. In the second season, Libby's role focused on her ill-fated marriage to roustabout Clayton \"Jonesy\" Jones (played by Tim DeKay). She married him against the objections of both her parents, despite knowing that Jonesy was both a former lover of her mother and a former love interest of Sophie. The series only lasted for two seasons and 24 episodes, though the writers had planned the plot developments of a third season.\n\nIn 2008, Gallo joined the cast of police procedural \"Bones\" in its 4th season. Her character of intern Daisy Wick was developed as a knowledgeable and astute assistant to the protagonist Temperance \"Bones\" Brennan (played by Emily Deschanel), but her impulsiveness and motormouth nature were her main character flaws. Ongoing subplots about Daisy involved her on-and-off romantic relationship with FBI psychologist Lance Sweets (played by John Francis Daley), her treatment of Temperance as both a role model and as a surrogate family member, and getting used to the role of a single mother following the death of Sweets. Daisy ended the series as the lead anthropologist of the National Forensic Lab.\n\nAlso in 2008, Gallo joined the cast of the comedy-drama series \"Californication\" during its second season. She played the role of porn star and aspiring Hollywood actress Daisy, both a client and a lover for publicity agent Charlie Runkle (played by Evan Handler). Their relationship caused the end of Charlie's marriage to Marcy Runkle (played by Pamela Adlon). Gallo left the series following its 3rd season, having played Daisy for 11 episodes.\n\nIn 2009, Gallo joined the cast of the comedy-drama series \"Men of a Certain Age\" (2009-2011), which dealt with the experiences of three middle-aged men. Gallo played Annie, the young girlfriend of retired actor Terry Elliot (played by Scott Bakula). Annie was frequently annoyed at his immature behavior and his tardiness in their dates. The series lasted for 2 seasons and 22 episodes.\n\nIn 2014, Gallo had the supporting role of Paula Faldt-Blevins in the comedy film \"Neighbors\". Paula had a sexual relationship with frat boy Scoonie Schofield (played by Christopher Mintz-Plasse). This relationship motivated Paula's jealous ex-husband Jimmy Blevins (played by Ike Barinholtz) to scheme against the entire fraternity. The film earned 270.7 million dollars at the worldwide box office. In the summer of 2014, Gallo gave birth to her first daughter. In May 2017, Gallo gave birth to her second daughter. She eventually married her long-term partner Mark Satterthwaite. Her husband is a professional screenwriter.\n\nGallo returned to the role of Paula in the sequel film \"Neighbors 2: Sorority Rising\" (2016). Paula had resumed her relationship with Jimmy, and was expecting her first baby. But she eagerly joined in an escalating conflict between her friends and a new sorority. The conflict was motivated by the incompatible money-making schemes of the two groups. It was eventually resolved through a mutually beneficial deal. The film earned 108.8 million at the worldwide box office, and decent reviews about several of its subplots.\n\nIn 2018, Paula portrayed film producer Lucy Fisher (1949-) in the biographical film \"A Futile and Stupid Gesture \". The film covered the life of comedy writer Douglas Kenney (1946-1980), and portrayed several of Kenney's associates throughout his career. The real Kenney was killed in an accidental fall from a cliff, leaving behind notes for various unfinished projects. The film was released in the 2018 Sundance Film Festival, to lukewarm reviews.\n\nGallo has continued her career to the early 2020s. In May 2022, she was hired as part of the main cast of the upcoming series \"Platonic\". Filming started within the same month. By 2022, Gallo was 46-years-old. She has no plans to retire yet, and she has managed to keep her audience entertained for nearly 30 years."
