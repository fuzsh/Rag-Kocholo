        "text": "Justin Timberlake\n\nClips of movies and music videos Justin has been in:\n\n1.\n\n2.\n\n3.\n\n4.\n\n5.\n\n6.\n\n7.\n\n8\n\n9.\n\n10\n\nBackground\n\nJustin Randall Timberlake (born January 31, 1981) is an American singer, songwriter, and actor. Born in Memphis, Tennessee, he appeared on the television shows Star Search and The All-New Mickey Mouse Club as a child. In the late 1990s, Timberlake rose to prominence as one of the two lead vocalists and youngest member of the boy band NSYNC, which eventually became one of the best-selling boy bands of all time.\n\nDuring the group’s hiatus, Timberlake released his solo studio albums Justified (2002) and FutureSex/LoveSounds (2006), the former spawned hits “Cry Me a River” and “Rock Your Body”, while the latter debuted atop the U.S. Billboard 200 and produced the Billboard Hot 100 number-one singles “SexyBack”, “My Love”, and “What Goes Around… Comes Around”. With each album exceeding sales of seven million copies worldwide, he was established as one of the most commercially successful singers of the decade. From 2007 through 2012, Timberlake focused on his acting career, effectively putting his music career on hiatus; he held starring roles in the films The Social Network, Bad Teacher, In Time, and Friends with Benefits.\n\nEarly life\n\nTimberlake was born on January 31, 1981 in Memphis, Tennessee, to Randall Timberlake and Lynn (Bomar) Harless. Timberlake grew up in Shelby Forest, a small community between Memphis and Millington. He has two half-brothers, Jonathan (born 1993) and Steven Robert (born August 14, 1998), from Randall’s second marriage to Lisa Perry. His half-sister Laura Katherine died shortly after birth on May 12, 1997, and is mentioned in his acknowledgments in the album *NSYNC as “My Angel in Heaven.” He was inspired to become a performer by Janet Jackson, saying “She didn’t just stand there and sing her song,” fascinated by her “energy and exuberance.”At the age of 11, Timberlake appeared on the television show Star Search, performing country music songs as “Justin Randall.”In 1993 and 1994, he was a cast member in The Mickey Mouse Club, where his castmates included future girlfriend and pop superstar Britney Spears, future tourmate Christina Aguilera, future bandmate JC Chasez, and future movie actors Ryan Gosling and Keri Russell. In 1995, Timberlake recruited Chasez to be in an all-male singing group, organized by boy band manager Lou Pearlman, that eventually became NSYNC. 1995–2004: NSYNC and Justified\n\nThe boy band NSYNC formed in 1995, and began their career in 1996 in Europe; Timberlake and Chasez served as its two lead singers. In 1998, the group rose to prominence in the United States with the release of their self-titled debut studio album, which sold 11 million copies and included hit single “Tearin’ Up My Heart”. Their second album No Strings Attached (2000) sold 2.4 million copies in the first week, and included a #1 single, “It’s Gonna Be Me”. NSYNC’s third album Celebrity (2001) was also financially successful. Upon the completion of the Celebrity Tour, the group went into hiatus in 2002. In its lifetime, NSYNC was internationally famous and performed at the Academy Awards,the Olympics, and the Super Bowl, as well as selling more than 50 million copies worldwide,becoming the third-best selling boy band in history.\n\nIn late 1999, Timberlake appeared in the Disney Channel movie Model Behavior. He played Jason Sharpe, a model who falls in love with a waitress after mistaking her for another model. It was released on March 12, 2000. The rise of his own stardom and the general decline in the popularity of boy bands led to the dissolution of ‘N Sync. Band member Lance Bass was openly critical of Timberlake’s actions in his memoir Out of Sync.\n\nIn August 2002, Timberlake performed at the 2002 MTV Video Music Awards, where he premiered his debut solo single “Like I Love You”, it peaked at number 11 on the Billboard Hot 100. His debut solo studio album Justified was released in November and debuted at number 2 on the Billboard 200 with first-week sales of 439,000 copies, fewer than previous ‘N Sync releases. It went on to sell over three million copies in the U.S. and more than seven million copies worldwide. Its R&B influence, provided by hip-hop producers The Neptunes and Timbaland, was complimented by music critics. The album spawned the top 10 singles “Cry Me a River” and “Rock Your Body”. In summer 2003, Timberlake and Christina Aguilera headlined the Justified/Stripped Tour. Later that year he recorded a song “I’m Lovin’ It”, used by McDonald’s as the theme to its “I’m Lovin’ It” campaign. The deal with McDonald’s earned Timberlake an estimated $6 million. A tour titled Justified and Lovin’ It Live was included with the deal. Timberlake was featured on Nelly’s song, “Work It”, which was remixed and included on Nelly’s 2003 remix album.\n\nIn February 2004, during the halftime show of the Super Bowl XXXVIII broadcast on the CBS television network, Timberlake performed with Janet Jackson before a television audience of more than 140 million viewers. At the end of the performance, as the song drew to a close, Timberlake tore off a part of Jackson’s black leather costume in a “costume reveal” meant to accompany a portion of the song lyrics. Jackson’s representative explained Timberlake intended “to pull away the rubber bustier to reveal a red lace bra. The garment collapsed and her breast was accidentally revealed.”Part of the costume detached, and Jackson’s breast was briefly exposed.Timberlake apologized for the incident, stating he was “sorry that anyone was offended by the wardrobe malfunction during the halftime performance of the Super Bowl….”The phrase “wardrobe malfunction” has since been used by the media to refer to the incident and has entered pop culture. Timberlake and Jackson were threatened with exclusion from the 2004 Grammy Awards unless they agreed to apologize on screen at the event. Timberlake attended and issued a scripted apology when accepting the first of two Grammy Awards he received that night (Best Pop Vocal Album for Justified and Best Male Pop Vocal Performance for “Cry Me a River”).He had also been nominated for Album of the Year for Justified, Record of the Year for “Cry Me a River”, and Best Rap/Sung Collaboration for “Where Is the Love?” with The Black Eyed Peas.\n\n004–07: Acting and FutureSex/LoveSounds\n\nAfter the Super Bowl controversy, Timberlake put his recording career on hold to act in several films, having starred in a few feature films earlier in his career. The first role he took during this time was as a journalist in Edison Force, filmed in 2004 and received a direct-to-video release on July 18, 2006. He also appeared in the films Alpha Dog, Black Snake Moan, Richard Kelly’s Southland Tales, and voiced Prince Artie Pendragon in the animated film Shrek the Third, released on May 18, 2007.He also appeared as a young Elton John, in the video for John’s song “This Train Don’t Stop There Anymore”. Timberlake was considered to play the role of Roger Davis in the film version of the rock musical Rent, but director Chris Columbus had insisted that only the original Broadway members could convey the true meaning of Rent, so role was reprised by Adam Pascal.\n\nHe continued to record with other artists. After “Where Is the Love?”, he again collaborated with the Black Eyed Peas on the 2005 track “My Style” from their album Monkey Business. When recording the 2005 single “Signs” with Snoop Dogg, Timberlake discovered a throat condition. Nodules were subsequently removed from his throat in an operation that took place on May 5, 2005. He was advised not to sing or speak loudly for at least a few months. In 2005, he began his own record company, JayTee Records.\n\nTimberlake released his second studio album, FutureSex/LoveSounds, on September 12, 2006. The album, which Timberlake created from 2005 to 2006, debuted at number one on the Billboard 200 album chart, selling 684,000 copies its first week. It is the biggest album for pre-orders on iTunes, and beat Coldplay’s record for the biggest one-week sales of a digital album. The album was produced by Timbaland and Danja (who produced a bulk of the album), will.i.am, Rick Rubin and Timberlake himself, and features guest vocals by Snoop Dogg, Three 6 Mafia, T.I. and will.i.am.A studio representative described it as being “all about sexiness” and aiming for “an adult feel”.\n\nThe album’s lead single, “SexyBack”, was performed by Timberlake at the opening of the 2006 MTV Video Music Awards and reached number one on the Billboard Hot 100, where it remained for seven consecutive weeks. “My Love”, the album’s second single, also produced by Timbaland and featuring rapper T.I., reached number one on the Hot 100, as did third single “What Goes Around… Comes Around”. The song is reported to have been inspired by the break-up of his childhood friend and business partner, Trace Ayala, with actress Elisha Cuthbert.In October 2006, Timberlake said that he would focus on his music career rather than his film roles, specifying that leaving the music industry would be a “dumb thing to do at this point”. He was the special guest performer at the 2006 Victoria’s Secret Fashion Show for being where he sang SexyBack. In January 2007, Timberlake embarked on the FutureSex/LoveShow tour. “Summer Love/Set the Mood Prelude” was the fourth U.S. single off the album, and the next single in the UK was “LoveStoned/I Think She Knows Interlude”. The song “Give It to Me”, a Timbaland single on which Timberlake guests with Nelly Furtado, reached the Hot 100 number-one spot.\n\nIn February 2008, Timberlake was awarded two Grammy Awards. At the 50th Grammy Awards ceremony, he won the Award for Best Male Pop Vocal Performance for “What Goes Around…Comes Around”, and the Award for Best Dance Recording for “LoveStoned/I Think She Knows”.\n\n2007–12: Musical hiatus and focus on acting\n\nThe song “4 Minutes”, was first played by Timbaland at Philadelphia’s Jingle Ball on December 17, 2007.When released on March 17, 2008, “4 Minutes” was revealed to be a duet between Timberlake and Madonna, with backing vocals by Timbaland.

After much speculation of breakups throughout their relationship,the couple split in December 2006 shortly after she introduced him as musical guest on Saturday Night Live.\n\nIn January 2007, Timberlake began dating actress Jessica Biel, with whom he had been photographed on multiple occasions.They became engaged in December 2011, and married on October 19, 2012 at the Borgo Egnazia resort in Fasano, Italy.\n\nForbes magazine began reporting on Justin’s earnings in 2008, calculating that he earned $44 million between June 2007 to June 2008 for his music, tour, commercials and hospitality made him the 4th world’s best-paid music personality at the time, above Madonna and Celine Dion.

Born in McComb, Mississippi, and raised in Kentwood, Louisiana, she performed acting roles in stage productions and television shows as a child before signing with Jive records in 1997. Spears’s first and second studio albums, Baby one more time (1999) and Oops! i did it again (2000), became international successes, with the former becoming the best-selling album by a teenage solo artist. Title tracks “…Baby One More Time” and “Oops!… I Did It Again” broke international sales records. In 2001, Spears released her self-titled third studio album, Britney, and played the starring role in the film Crossroads (2002). She assumed creative control of her fourth studio album, In the Zone (2003), which yielded the worldwide success of the “Toxic” single.\n\nEarly life\n\n1981–97: Early life and the beginning of her career\n\nSpears was born in McComb, Mississippi, in which she was the second child of Lynne Irene Bridges and James Parnell Spears. Her maternal grandmother, Lillian Portell, was English (born in London), and one of Spears’s maternal great-great-grandfathers was Maltese. Her siblings are Bryan James and Jamie Lynn. At age three, she started attending dance lessons in her hometown of Kentwood, Louisiana, and was selected to perform as a solo artist at the annual recital. During her childhood, she also attended gymnastics and voice lessons, and won many state-level competitions and children’s talent shows.Spears made her local stage debut at age five, singing “What Child Is This?” at her kindergarten graduation. She said about her ambition as a child, “I was in my own world, I found out what I’m supposed to do at an early age”.At age eight, Spears and her mother Lynne traveled to Atlanta, Georgia for an audition in the 1990s revival of The Mickey Mouse Club. Casting director Matt Casella rejected her for being too young to join the series at the time, but introduced her to Nancy Carson, a New York City talent agent. Carson was impressed with Spears’s vocals and suggested enrolling her at the Professional Performing Arts School. Shortly after, Lynne and her daughters moved to a sublet apartment in New York.\n\nSpears was hired for her first professional role as the understudy for the lead role of Tina Denmark in the Off-Broadway musical Ruthless!. She also appeared as a contestant on the popular television show Star Search and was cast in a number of commercials. In December 1992, she was finally cast in The Mickey Mouse Club, but returned to Kentwood after the show was canceled. She enrolled at Parklane Academy in McComb, Mississippi. Although she made friends with most of her classmates, she compared the school to “the opening scene in Clueless with all the cliques and stated,” I was so bored. I was the point guard on the basketball team. I had my boyfriend, and I went to homecoming and Christmas formal. But I wanted more”.\n\nIn June 1997, Spears was in talks with manager Lou Pearlman to join the female pop group Innosense. Lynne asked family friend and entertainment lawyer Larry Rudolph for his opinion and submitted a tape of Spears singing over a Whitney Houston karaoke song along with some pictures. Rudolph decided he wanted to pitch her to record labels, therefore she needed a professional demo. He sent Spears an unused song of Toni Braxton. Britney rehearsed for a week and recorded her vocals in a studio with a sound engineer. Spears traveled to New York with the demo and met with executives from four labels, returning to Kentwood the same day. Three of the labels rejected her, arguing that audiences wanted pop bands such as the Backstreet Boys and the Spice Girls, and “there wasn’t going to be another Madonna, another Debbie Gibson, or another Tiffany.” Two weeks later, executives from Jive Records returned calls to Rudolph. With Senior vice president of (A&R) Jeff Fenster stated about Spears’s audition that, “it’s very rare to hear someone that age who can deliver emotional content and commercial appeal. For any artist, the motivation—the ‘eye of the tiger’—is extremely important. And Britney had that.”She then sang Houston’s “I Have Nothing” (1992) for the executives, and got signed to the label. They appointed her to work with producer Eric Foster White for a month, who reportedly shaped her voice from “lower and less poppy” delivery to “distinctively, unmistakably Britney.” After hearing the recorded material, president Clive Calder ordered a full album. Spears had originally envisioned “Sheryl Crow music, but younger more adult contemporary” but felt all right with her label’s appointment of producers, since “It made more sense to go pop, because I can dance to it—it’s more me.” She flew to Cheiron Studios in Stockholm, Sweden, where half of the album was recorded from March to April 1998, with producers Max Martin, Denniz Pop and Rami Yacoub, among others.\n\n1998–2000: Baby One More Time and Oops!… I Did It Again\n\nAfter Spears returned to the United States, she embarked on a shopping mall promotional tour to promote her debut album. Her show was a four song set and she was accompanied by two back up dancers. Her first concert tour followed, as an opening act for NSYNC.Her debut studio album, …Baby One More Time, was released on January 12, 1999.[28] It debuted at number one on the U.S. Billboard 200 and was certified two-times platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America after a month. Worldwide, the album topped the charts in fifteen countries and sold over 10 million copies in a year. It became the biggest selling album ever by a teenage artist. The title track was released as the lead single from the album. Originally, Jive Records wanted its music video to be animated; however, Spears rejected it, and suggested the final idea of a Catholic schoolgirl. The single sold 500,000 copies on its first day, and peaked at number one on the Billboard Hot 100, topping the chart for two consecutive weeks. It has sold more than 10 million as of today, making it one of the best-selling singles of all time.”…Baby One More Time” later received a Grammy nomination for Best Female Pop Vocal Performance.The title track also topped the singles chart for two weeks in the United Kingdom, and became the fastest-selling single ever by a female artist, shipping over 460,000 copies.It would later become the 25th most successful song of all time in British chart history. Spears is also the youngest female artist to have a million seller in the country. “(You Drive Me) Crazy” was released as the third single from the album. It became a top-ten hit worldwide and propelled …Baby One More Time to sell even more. As of today, it has sold 30 million copies worldwide, making it one of the best-selling albums of all time. It is also the best-selling first album by any artist ever.\n\nOops!… I Did It Again, her second studio album, was released in May 2000. It debuted at number one in the US, selling 1.3 million copies, breaking the SoundScan record for the highest debut sales by any solo artist. The album sold over 25 million copies worldwide to date, making one of the best-selling albums of all time. Rob Sheffield of Rolling Stone said that “the great thing about Oops! – under the cheese surface, Britney’s demand for satisfaction is complex, fierce and downright scary, making her a true child of rock & roll tradition. “The album’s lead single, “Oops!… I Did It Again”, peaked at the top of the charts in Australia, New Zealand, the United Kingdom and many other European nations. The album as well as the title track received Grammy nominations for Best Pop Vocal Album and Best Female Pop Vocal Performance, respectively.\n\nThe same year, Spears embarked on the Oops!… I Did It Again Tour, which grossed $40.5 million, she also released her first book, Britney Spears’ Heart-to-Heart, co-written with her mother. On September 7, 2000, Spears performed at the 2000 MTV Video Music Awards. Halfway through the performance, she ripped off her black suit to reveal a sequined flesh-coloured bodysuit, followed by heavy dance routine. It is noted by critics as the moment that Spears showed signs of becoming a more provocative performer. Amidst media speculation, Spears confirmed she was dating NSYNC member Justin Timberlake.\n\n2001–03: Britney, Crossroads, and In the Zone\n\nIn February 2001, Spears signed a $7–8 million promotional deal with Pepsi, and released another book co-written with her mother, entitled A Mother’s Gift. Her self-titled third studio album, Britney, was released in November 2001. While on tour, she felt inspired by hip hop artists such as Jay-Z and The Neptune’s and wanted to create a record with a funkier sound. The album debuted at number one in the Billboard 200 and reached top five positions in Australia, the United Kingdom and mainland Europe and sold over 12 million copies worldwide. Stephen Thomas Erlewine of (AllMusic) called Britney “the record where she strives to deepen her persona, making it more adult while still recognizably Britney. .The album was honored with two Grammy nominations—Best Pop Vocal Album and Best Female Pop Vocal Performance for “Overprotected”— and was listed in 2008 as one of Entertainment Weekly’s “100 Best Albums from the Past 25 Years”.The album’s first single, “I’m a Slave 4 U”, became a top-ten hit worldwide.\n\nSpears’s performance of the single at the 2001 MTV Video Music Awards featured a caged tiger and a large albino python draped over her shoulders. It was harshly received by animal rights organization PETA, who claimed the animals were mistreated and scrapped plans for an anti-fur billboard that was to feature Spears.To support the album, Spears embarked on the Dream Within a Dream Tour. The show was critically praised for its technical innovations, the pièce de résistance being a water screen that pumped two tons of water into the stage.The tour grossed $43.7 million, becoming the second highest grossing tour of 2002 by a female artist, behind Cher’s Farewell Tour. Her career success was highlighted by Forbes in 2002, as Spears was ranked the world’s most powerful celebrity. Spears also landed her first starring role in Crossroads, released in February 2002. Although the film was largely panned, some critics praised Spears’s acting. Crossroads, which had a $11 million budget, went on to gross over $57 million worldwide.\n\nIn June 2002, Spears opened her first restaurant, Nyla, in New York City, but terminated her relationship in November, citing mismanagement and “management’s failure to keep her fully apprised”. In July 2002, Spears announced she would take a six-month break from her career; however, she went back into the studio in November to record her new album.Spears’s relationship with Justin Timberlake ended after three years. In December 2002, Timberlake released the song “Cry Me a River” as the second single from his solo debut album. The music video featured a Spears look-alike and fueled the rumors that she had been unfaithful to him. As a response, Spears wrote the ballad “Everytime” with her backing vocalist and friend Annet Artani. The same year, Limp Bizkit frontman Fred Durst said that he was in a relationship with Spears. However, Spears denied Durst’s claims. In a 2009 interview, he explained that “I just guess at the time it was taboo for a guy like me to be associated with a gal like her.”Spears opened the 2003 MTV Video Music Awards with Christina Aguilera, performing “Like a Virgin”. Halfway through they were joined by Madonna, with whom they both kissed. The incident was highly publicized.\n\n2004–07: Marriage and motherhood\n\nIn January 2004, Spears married childhood friend Jason Allen Alexander at The Little White Wedding Chapel in Las Vegas, Nevada. The marriage was annulled 55 hours later, stating that Spears “lacked understanding of her actions”. In March 2004, she embarked on The Onyx Hotel Tour in support of In the Zone.In June 2004, Spears fell and injured her left knee during the music video shoot for “Outrageous”. Spears underwent arthroscopic surgery. She was forced to remain six weeks with a thigh brace, followed by eight to twelve weeks of rehabilitation, which caused The Onyx Hotel Tour to be canceled. During 2004, Spears became involved in the Kabbalah Centre through her friendship with Madonna.\n\nIn July 2004, Spears became engaged to American dancer Kevin Federline, whom she had met three months before. The romance received intense attention from the media, since Federline had recently broken up with actress Shar Jackson, who was still pregnant with their second child at the time.The stages of their relationship were chronicled in Spears’s first reality show Britney & Kevin: Chaotic. They held a wedding ceremony on September 18, 2004, but were not legally married until three weeks later on October 6 due to a delay finalizing the couple’s prenuptial agreement. Shortly after, she released her first fragrance with Elizabeth Arden, Curious, which broke the company’s first-week gross for a perfume.\n\nIn October 2004, Spears took a career break to start a family. Greatest Hits: My Prerogative, her first greatest hits compilation album, was released in November 2004. Spears’s cover version of Bobby Brown’s “My Prerogative” was released as the lead single from the album, reaching the top of the charts in Finland, Ireland, Italy and Norway. The second single, “Do Somethin'”, was a top ten hit in Australia, the United Kingdom and other countries of mainland Europe. The greatest hits album sold over 5 million copies worldwide. In September 2005, Spears gave birth to her first child, a son.\n\nIn November 2005, she released her first remix compilation, B in the Mix: The Remixes, which consists of eleven remixes.It has sold over 1 million copies worldwide.In February 2006, pictures surfaced of Spears driving with her son Sean, on her lap instead of in a car seat. Child advocates were horrified by the photos of her holding the wheel with one hand and Sean with the other. Spears claimed that the situation happened because of a frightening encounter with paparazzi, and that it was a mistake on her part.The following month, she guest-starred on the Will & Grace episode “Buy, Buy Baby” as closeted lesbian Amber Louise. She announced she no longer studied Kabbalah in June 2006, explaining, “my baby is my religion.” Two months later, Spears posed nude for the cover of Harper’s Bazaar. The picture was heavily compared to Demi Moore’s August 1991 Vanity Fair cover. In September 2006, she gave birth to her second child, a son. In November 2006, Spears filed for divorce from Federline, citing irreconcilable differences. Their divorce was finalized in July 2007, when the couple reached a global settlement and agreed to share joint custody of their children.\n\n2007: Personal struggles and Blackout\n\nSpears’s aunt Sandra Bridges Covington, with whom she had been very close, died of ovarian cancer in January 2007. In February, Spears stayed in a drug rehabilitation facility in Antigua for less than a day. The following night, she shaved her head with electric clippers at a hair salon in Tarzana, Los Angeles. She admitted herself to other treatment facilities during the following weeks. In May 2007, she produced a series of promotional concerts at House of Blues venues, titled The M+M’s Tour. In October 2007, Spears lost physical custody of her children to Federline. The reasons of the court ruling were not revealed to the public. Spears was also sued by Louis Vuitton over her 2005 music video “Do Somethin'” for upholstering her Hummer interior in counterfeit Louis Vuitton cherry blossom fabric, which resulted in the video being banned on European TV stations.\n\nIn October 2007, Spears released her fifth studio album, Blackout. The album debuted at the top of charts in Canada and Ireland, number two in the U.S. Billboard 200, France, Japan, Mexico and the United Kingdom and the top ten in Australia, Korea, New Zealand and many European nations. In the United States, Spears became the only female artist to have her first five studio albums debut at the two top slots of the chart. The album received positive reviews from critics and has sold over 3 million copies worldwide.[Blackout won Album of the Year at MTV Europe Music Awards 2008 and was listed as the fifth Best Pop Album of the Decade by The Times.Spears performed the lead single “Gimme More” at the 2007 MTV Video Music Awards. The performance was panned by many critics. Despite the backlash, the single rocketed to worldwide success, peaking at number one in Canada and the top ten in almost every country it charted. The second single “Piece of Me” reached the top of the charts in Ireland and reached the top five in Australia, Canada, Denmark, New Zealand and the United Kingdom. The third single “Break the Ice” was released the following year and had moderate success due to Spears not being able to promote it properly. In December 2007, Spears began a relationship with paparazzo Adnan Ghalib.\n\n2008–10: Conservatorship and Circus\n\nImage of a blond female performer.

She stands in front of a black and golden couch.\n\nSpears performing “Freakshow” at The Circus Starring Britney Spears, May 2009.\n\nIn January 2008, Spears refused to relinquish custody of her sons to Federline’s representatives. She was hospitalized at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center after police that arrived at her house noted she appeared to be under the influence of an illicit substance. The following day, Spears’s visitation rights were suspended at an emergency court hearing, and Federline was given sole physical and legal custody of the children. She was committed to the psychiatric ward of Ronald Reagan UCLA Medical Centre and put on 5150 involuntary psychiatric hold. The court placed her under temporary, and later, permanent conservatorship of her father James Spears and attorney Andrew Wallet, giving them complete control of her assets. She was released five days later. The following month, she guest-starred on the How I Met Your Mother episode “Ten Sessions” as receptionist Abby. She received positive reviews for her performance, as well as bringing the series its highest ratings ever. In July 2008, Spears regained some visitation rights after coming to an agreement with Federline and his counsel. In September 2008, Spears opened the MTV Video Music Awards with a pre-taped comedy sketch with Jonah Hill and an introduction speech. She won Best Female Video, Best Pop Video and Video of the Year for “Piece of Me”. A 60-minute introspective documentary, Britney: For the Record, was produced to chronicle Spears’s return to the recording industry. Directed by Phil Griffin, For the Record was shot in Beverly Hills, Hollywood, and New York City during the third quarter of 2008. The documentary was broadcast on MTV to 5.6 million viewers for the two airings on the premiere night. It was the highest rating in its Sunday night timeslot and in the network’s history.\n\nIn December 2008, Spears’s sixth studio album Circus was released. It received positive reviews from critics and debuted at number one in Canada, Czech Republic and the United States, and inside the top ten in many European nations. In the United States, Spears became the youngest female artist to have five albums debut at number one, earning a place in Guinness World Records. She also became the only act in the Sounds can era to have four albums debut with 500,000 or more copies sold. The album was one of the fastest-selling albums of the year, and has sold 4 million copies worldwide. Its lead single, “Womanizer”, became Spears’s first number one in the Billboard Hot 100 since “Baby One More Time”. The single also topped the charts in Belgium, Canada, Denmark, Finland, France, Norway and Sweden. It was also nominated for a Grammy in the category of Best Dance Recording. In January 2009, Spears and her father James obtained a restraining order against her former manager Sam Lutfi, ex-boyfriend Adnan Ghalib and attorney Jon Eardley — all of whom, court documents claim, had been conspiring to gain control of Spears’s affairs. The restraining order forbids Lutfi and Ghalib from contacting Spears or coming within 250 yards of her, her property or family members. Spears embarked on The Circus Starring Britney Spears in March 2009. With a gross of U.S. $131.8 million, it became the fifth highest grossing tour of the year.\n\nIn November 2009, Spears released her second greatest hits album, The Singles Collection. The album’s lead and only single, “3” became her third number one single in the U.S. In May 2010, Spears’s representatives confirmed she was dating her agent Jason Trawick , and that they had decided to end their professional relationship to focus on their personal relationship. Spears designed a limited edition clothing line for Candie’s, which was released in stores in July 2010.

The album peaked at number one in the United States, Canada, and Australia, and peaked inside the top ten on nearly every other chart. Its peak in the United States ties Britney with Mariah Carey and Janet Jackson for the third-most number ones among women. It has sold 1,000,000 copies in the United States and 2.2 million worldwide, and has been certified platinum by the RIAA. The album’s lead single “Hold It Against Me” debuted at number-one on the Billboard Hot 100, becoming Spears’s fourth number-one single on the chart and making her the second artist in history to have two consecutive singles debut at number-one, after Mariah Carey. The second single “Till the World Ends” reached peaked at number three on the Billboard Hot 100 in May, while the third single “I Wanna Go” reached number seven in August. Femme Fatale became Spears’s first album in which three of its songs reached the top ten of the chart. The fourth and final single “Criminal” was released in September 2011. The music video caused controversy when British politicians criticized Spears for using replica guns while filming the video in an area of London that had been badly affected by the 2011 England riots. Spears’s management briefly responded, stating, “The video is a fantasy story featuring Britney’s boyfriend, Jason Trawick, which literally plays out the lyrics of a song written three years before the riots ever happened.” In April 2011, Spears appeared in a remix of Rihanna’s song “S&M”.It reached number one in the US later in the month, giving Spears her fifth number one on the chart. On Billboard ’​s 2011 Year-End list, Spears was ranked number fourteen on the Artists of the Year, thirty-two on Billboard 200 artists and ten on Billboard Hot 100 artists.\n\nIn June 2011, Spears embarked on the Femme Fatale Tour.

In August 2011, Spears received the MTV Video Vanguard Award at the 2011 MTV Video Music Awards. The next month, she released her second remix album, B in the Mix: The Remixes Vol. 2. In December, Spears became engaged to her long-time boyfriend Jason Trawick, who had formerly been her agent. Trawick became a co-conservator of Spears, alongside her father, in April 2012. In January 2013, Spears and Trawick ended their engagement. Trawick was also removed as Spears’s co-conservator, restoring her father as the sole conservator.\n\nIn May 2012, Spears was hired to replace Nicole Scherzinger as a judge for the second season of the U.S. version of The X Factor, joining Simon Cowell, L.A.

Spears did not return for the show’s third season and her spot was filled by Kelly Rowland. Spears was featured on will.i.am’s “Scream & Shout”, which was released as a single from his fourth studio album, #willpower (2013). The song later became Spears’s sixth number one single on the UK Singles Chart and peaked at #3 on US Billboard Hot 100. In December, Forbes magazine named her music’s top-earning woman of 2012, with estimated earnings of $58 million.\n\n2013–present: Britney Jean, Britney: Piece of Me, and ninth studio album\n\nSpears began work on her eighth studio album, Britney Jean, in December 2012, and enlisted will.i.am as its executive producer in May 2013.On September 17, 2013, she appeared on Good Morning America to announce her two-year residency show at Planet Hollywood Resort & Casino in Las Vegas, titled Britney: Piece of Me. It began on December 27, 2013, and will include a total of 100 shows throughout 2014 and 2015. During the same appearance, Spears announced that Britney Jean would be released on December 3, 2013, in the United States. It was released through RCA Records due to the disbandment of Jive Records in 2011. Furthermore, Britney Jean became Spears’s final project under her original recording contract with RCA, which had guaranteed the release of eight studio albums. The record received a low amount of promotion and commercial impact, reportedly due to contractual obligations for Britney: Piece of Me. Upon its release, the record debuted at number four on the U.S. Billboard 200 with first-week sales of 107,000 copies, becoming her lowest-peaking and lowest-selling album in the United States. Britney Jean debuted at number 34 on the UK Albums Chart, selling 12,959 copies in its first week. In doing so, it became Spears’s lowest-charting and lowest-selling album in the country.\n\n“Work Bitch” was released as the lead single from Britney Jean on September 16, 2013, one day earlier than expected after being leaked online. It debuted and peaked at number 12 on the U.S. Billboard Hot 100. The second single “Perfume” was premiered on November 3, 2013, two days earlier than originally announced. It debuted and peaked at number 76 on the U.S. Billboard Hot 100.During the production of Britney Jean, Spears recorded the song “Ooh La La” for the soundtrack of The Smurfs 2 earlier in 2013. In October 2013, she was featured as a guest vocalist on Miley Cyrus’s track “SMS (Bangerz)”, taken from her fourth studio album Bangerz (2013).It debuted in the Billboard charts at number 10 in US Bubbling Under Hot 100 Singles, number 29 in the US Pop Digital Singles, and number 70 in the US Hot Digital Songs, respectively. On January 8, 2014, Spears won Favorite Pop Artist at the 40th People’s Choice Awards at the Nokia Theatre in Los Angeles. On August 28, 2014, it was confirmed that Spears has renewed her contract with RCA, and that she is writing and recording new music for her next album.\n\nSpears’s star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame\n\nSpears became an international pop culture icon immediately after launching her recording career. Rolling Stone magazine wrote: “One of the most controversial and successful female vocalists of the 21st century,” she “spearheaded the rise of post-millennial teen pop … Spears early on cultivated a mixture of innocence and experience that broke the bank”. She is listed by the Guinness World Records as having the “Best-selling album by a teenage solo artist” for her debut album …Baby One More Time which sold over thirteen million copies in the United States. Melissa Ruggieri of the Richmond Times-Dispatch reported, “She’s also marked for being the best-selling teenage artist. Before she turned 20 in 2001, Spears sold more than 37 million albums worldwide”. As of 2011, she has sold over 100 million albums worldwide, making her one of the best-selling music artists of all time based on album sales alone. She was also ranked as the fourth VH1’s “50 Greatest Women of the Video Era” show list, ahead of most of her contemporaries and only behind veterans Madonna, Janet Jackson, and Whitney Houston. Spears is also recognized as the best-selling female artist of the first decade of the 21st century, as well as the fifth overall. In December 2009, Billboard magazine ranked Spears the 8th Artist of the 2000s decade in the United States.\n\nA Sexier Image\n\nWith 2001’s Britney, Spears made the first move toward shedding her virginal image, while also taking her sound in a different direction. The track, “I’m a Slave 4 U,” sounded more like Prince than her bubble-gum pop of the past. “I’d get bored singing the same type of songs all the time. I still love my old stuff, but you have to extend yourself and grow,” she explained toEntertainment Weekly. Performing “I’m a Slave 4 U” at the 2001 MTV Video Music Awards, Spears made heads turn by dancing with a seven-foot albino python around her neck and wearing a barely-there costume.\n\nAround this same time, Spears took a leading role in the feature filmCrossroads. The coming-of-age drama received a drubbing from critics after its February 2002 release, but it ended up netting more than $37 million at the box office. Later that spring, Spears experienced another disappointment. She and Timberlake announced that they had broken up.\n\nConclusion\n\nI’ve found from doing my research into the life of Britney Spears she is clearly a very forward thinking, intelligent inspirational and a beautiful woman and its fascinating to finally understand the how certain chapters in her life played out in order to lead to where she is today.I’ve found consistently through my studies that most of her work has the sex appeal to it which according to research is biggest reason to how she is as big as she is. I would say although this is true and it helps i think she is a very talented lady and her voice is amazing and i feel its her journey and the stories about how difficult life has been to her is what i feel truly is the reason why she is credited so much and why she has inspired so many people to get into music industry and to listen to her music. So ultimately i feel she has earnt her way to fame rather than getting there just based on her looks."
