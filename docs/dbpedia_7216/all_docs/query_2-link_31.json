This 23 year old is reminiscing on her time on the X Factor by recreating a track from her time on the series.\n\nOn June 15, Carly Rose went viral on TikTok for sharing her intention to recreate a fan picked X Factor song. The singer begins the video with the words “When you finally listen to everyone in the comments asking you to recreate one of your favorite X Factor songs” on the screen. She then reveals a studio microphone in front of her face. The track underneath the video is a sped up version of “You’re Welcome” from the Disney film, Moana.\n\nIt’s clear that this video has landed on the “for you page” of the correct audience, there are tons of song requests in the comments. While some fans are suggesting “Broken Hearted,” “Rolling in The Deep,” and “Over the Rainbow,” many are requesting the song that got her famous on the show.\n\nCarly Rose’s Journey on The X Factor\n\nAt only 13 years old, Carly Rose took the X Factor stage to sing “Feeling Good” by Anthony Newley and Leslie Bricusse. Even though the judges were hesitant to hear her song because of her age, she became a standout in the competition due to her impressive vocals. This audition has become one of the most remembered from the series as a whole.\n\nShe continued throughout the competition as part of the Teens category. During her journey on the show, she was mentored by pop legend, Britney Spears. Even though Carly Rose continued to impress with multiple classics like “Over the Rainbow,” “My Heart Will Go On,” and “Your Song.” She was a clear fan favorite throughout her time on the series. Everyone was shocked when she was announced as the runner up to LA Reid’s singer, Tate Stevens.\n\nWhat She’s Been Up to Since the Show\n\nFollowing Carly Rose’s journey on The X Factor, she shared that Syco Music had a recording option for her, but they were “trying to find the right label” for her sound. In 2014, Carly Rose released her first music video for “Everybody’s Watching,” while she continued to attend public school. She graduated from high school in 2017 and later graduated from the University of Southern California in 2021.\n\nThe X Factor runner up began releasing original music to streaming in 2019 with the launch of her debut single “Birds and Bees.” Since then, she released ten singles and an seven track album named WILD. Her most recent release is entitled “Afterglow” and It appears that she dropped the single independently.\n\nCarly Rose has recently gained thousands of views on TikTok because of her series reacting to her performances on The X Factor. Each of the videos have gained around 300,000 views on the app. Even though Carly hasn’t released any further information about recreating her performances, fans cannot wait to see which song she records."
