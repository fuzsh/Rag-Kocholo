        "text": "The American public has voted and Carly Rose Sonenclar – a 13 year old Jewish girl from New York – is a finalist on The X Factor USA.\n\nThe young star, mentored by X Factor judge Britney Spears, received a standing ovation from all four judges when she performed Nina Simone’s “Feeling Good” during her first audition.\n\nEntertainment mogul Simon Cowell said “a star has just walked out on that stage.”\n\nHowever Carly Rose also has an impressive acting portfolio. Her first job with New York’s American Jewish Theatre led to a Les Miserables role on Broadway in 2006 and a musical tour of Little House on the Prairie in 2009.\n\nPop-sensation Britney Spears, who mentored the teenage contestants on the show, thought there was a resemblance between herself and Carly Rose.\n\n“She reminds me a lot of me - when I was younger,” she is quoted on a website run by celebrity-journalist Perez Hilton.\n\n“Carly Rose is kind of shy and then she gets on stage [and] it’s an insane voice.\n\n“Like Simon [Cowell] said about her the other night, she really gets it. She understands the business and that's what you also need on top of being talented. I think that's her best quality.\"\n\nCarly Rose is the final contestant in the teenage category, and will compete against Tate Stevens, Fifth Harmony, and Emblem3.\n\nThe X Factor USA winner will be announced on December 20."
