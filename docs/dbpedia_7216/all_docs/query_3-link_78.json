        "text": "Between viewer disappointment in Britney Spears as a judge, Khloe Kardashian Odom as a host, and distaste of the extravagant stage performances, The X Factor US has taken a hit to the ratings this year. The most recent episode that aired on Nov. 1 had 6.24 million viewers, almost half of what the show averaged during its first season. The decline in ratings and disgruntled fans are making FOX executives wary enough that they are beginning to question their decision to renew X Factor for a third season.\n\nThis is my first time watching The X Factor US and despite these troubles, I think it’s a fun show to watch. Besides, the executives’ concerns may soon be a thing of the past since popular boyband and X Factor UK alums, One Direction, are scheduled to play the results show tomorrow night. Personally, I hope FOX brings Simon Cowell and the gang back for another year, but until that decision is made, here is why I’m loving this season of X Factor."
