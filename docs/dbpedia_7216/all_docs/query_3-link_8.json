The former \"X Factor USA\" singer took to the stage at the Best Buy Theater where she brought together Motown classic \"I Heard It Through the Grapevine\" and Alex Clare's \"Too Close\" into one fluid medley. While we're no strangers to Carly Rose's amazing covers, this is the first time we've heard her take on a mashup --\n\nEntertainment·HuffPost\n\nHow Carly Rose Sonenclar Made These Kids Feel Like Rock Stars (VIDEO)\n\nNot only does Carly Rose Sonenclar have crazy-good vocal talent, but she also has a big heart. Teaming up with the children of the Starlight Children's Foundation -- an organization that helps to improve the lives of kids and their families globally -- the former \"X Factor USA\" contestant took the stage, where they sang a beautiful cover of Leonard Cohen's \"Hallelujah.\" By placing these children in the spotlight for a night, it's a chance for them to take their minds off the challenges they're\n\nEntertainment·HuffPost\n\nHuffPost Teen's '18 Under 18' Of 2012! (PHOTOS)\n\nIt's been an amazing year for young people, and here at HuffPost Teen, we've been inspired by watching many of them dominate in fields ranging from entertainment to science to technology to sports -- and beyond.\n\nEntertainment·HuffPost\n\nRobbed?\n\nTate Stevens beat Carly Rose Sonenclar on Thursday's finale of \"X Factor USA.\" We'll admit it: we've been #teamteens and #teamCarly since we started live-tweeting the show in September, so the news came as a bit of a shock and a bit of a bummer to us -- even though we agree that \"over 25\" country singer is both lovable and talented. As the judges said frequently, Carly Rose Sonenclar's voice was so stunning when she sang that they sometimes doubted that she was human. Click through the slidesh\n\nEntertainment·HuffPost\n\nDemi Lovato Sings Surprise 'X Factor' Duet! (VIDEO)\n\nTonight, \"X Factor USA\" featured the final performances from the show's remaining 3 acts: Carly Rose Sonenclar, Tate Stevens and girl group Fifth Harmony. Despite the fact that the girls have had the opportunity to speak with Demi throughout the season, her introduction to the stage from group member Camila Cabello couldn't have been sweeter and more heartfelt.\n\nEntertainment·HuffPost\n\n5 Reasons We're Excited For The 'X Factor' Finale (WATCH)\n\nThe \"Over 25\" country singer Tate Stevens came in ahead of our our favorite teen contestant, Carly Rose Sonenclar, in last week's rankings -- but Thursday's finale could be anyone's game. Given Carly Rose's track record, it's safe to say that this duet will be dynamite. Demi has already resolved to help Fifth Harmony with their career post-\"X Factor,\" and she'll be performing with the group this week.\n\nEntertainment·HuffPost\n\nCarly Rose SLAYS A Classic Beatles Song (VIDEO)\n\nSomehow, Carly Rose Sonenclar -- \"X Factor USA\"'s 13-year-old singing prodigy -- is stepping onstage in second place this week after last Thursday's shocking reveal that the \"over 25\" country singer Tate Stevens dominated the score board. Carly performed \"Your Song\" at the beginning of the episode, and this marked the first song choice she has made for herself on the show so far.\n\nEntertainment·HuffPost\n\nCarly Takes On 'Rolling In The Deep'\n\nOnly Carly Rose Sonenclar can make two of the most over-played songs of all time -- \"My Heart Will Go On\" and \"Rolling In The Deep\" -- feel inventive and moving. The 13-year-old prodigy on \"X Factor USA\" has so far left every other contestant in her dust, and Wednesday's episode was no different.
