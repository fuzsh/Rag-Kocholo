        "text": "Not only does Carly Rose Sonenclar have crazy-good vocal talent, but she also has a big heart.\n\nTeaming up with the children of the Starlight Children's Foundation -- an organization that helps to improve the lives of kids and their families globally -- the former \"X Factor USA\" contestant took the stage, where they sang a beautiful cover of Leonard Cohen's \"Hallelujah.\" By placing these children in the spotlight for a night, it's a chance for them to take their minds off the challenges they're experiencing.\n\n\"I think there's definitely a connection between all the kids and I,\" explained Carly Rose. \"The kids are just such fighters. I get inspired by the kids -- no matter what they're going through, they'll be smiling and dancing.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWatch the performance in the video above.\n\nIs it just us, or are you feeling a little sniffly too?\n\nCarly's Angels, what did you think of this special performance? Tell us in the comments or tweet @HuffPostTeen."
