        "text": "If there is one thing I know, Carly Rose is the best singer that has sung… ever. I haven’t seen her before the X-Factor, but apparently she has quite the resume. Not only is she a fantastic singer, but she was also a professional actor a few years ago.\n\nSonenclar began her acting career in 2006 at the New York Musical Theater Festival’s The Night of the Hunter, playing the lead role of Pearl. Later that year, she made her Broadway debut as Young Cosette in Les Miserables. Then, in 2009, Sonenclar appeared in the national tour playing the lead role of Carrie in Little House on the Prairie the Musical. She also appeared in season three of The Electric Company, making her television debut.\n\nLast year, Sonenclar played the lead role of Chloe from in Wonderland, the Broadway musical. It was interesting to come across that The New York Times theater critic, Charles Isherwood, thought of Sonenclar as a good actress but an “almost preternaturally skilled singer.” She was also rewarded as the 2011 Best Young Performer on broadwayworld.com. Recently, Sonenclar played Parsley, the lead role, in The Big Bank, a newly created musical at the New York Musical Theater Festival. Believe it or not, she appeared in two movies playing small roles in The Nanny Diaries and Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants 2.\n\nShe has also sung the National Anthem at Madison Swuare Garden for the New York Knicks, at Dodger Stadium for the Los Angeles Dodgers and as well as in New York City at the US Open.\n\nWhen Sonenclar auditioned for the second season of The X Factor USA with the well-known song, “Feeling Good,” each of the judges fell in love with her instantly. I remember watching her from my TV. I remember saying to myself, “Okay, this girl is going to win.”\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEverybody loves her, and even that’s an understatement. In school, if you ask your friends who they think will win, The X Factor they will most likely say Carly Rose Sonenclar.\n\nIt is devastating how amazing she is, and she’s only thirteen years old! People only wish they could have the talent that she has! She’s fantastic, amazing, superb, beautiful, bubbly and just an overall inspiring girl.\n\nThe judges never have anything bad to say about her. It’s always positive things, and like Demi Lovato said “The only thing that is predictable about that song was that it was going to be amazing!” Sonenclar is my favorite candidate on The X Factor, and I do believe that she deserves the $5 million record deal.\n\nVOTE FOR CARLY ROSE SONENCLAR!\n\nAdvertisement"
