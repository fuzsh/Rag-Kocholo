        "text": "Carly Rose Sonenclar, who releases music simply as \"Carly Rose,\" is a singer-songwriter known for finishing as the runner-up on the second season of the American version of \"The X Factor.\"\n\nSonenclar was a young actress, beginning her acting career in 2006. She soon made her Broadway debut in \"Les Miserables\" as Young Cosette. Among other stage roles, she originated the role of Chloe (Alice's daughter) in the 2011 musical \"Wonderland\" on Broadway.\n\nn 2012, Sonenclar auditioned for the second season of the American version \"The X Factor\" with the song \"Feeling Good\" (as made famous by Nina Simone). Sonenclar received a standing ovation from all four judges and she advanced to the next round.\n\nSonenclar performed covers of songs including \"Pumped Up Kicks,\" \"Brokenhearted,\" \"It Will Rain,\" \"Over the Rainbow,\" \"My Heart Will Go On,\" and \"Hallelujah\" on her \"The X Factor.\" She ultimately finished as the runner-up to winner Tate Stevens.\n\nIn June of 2019, Sonenclar released her debut single \"Birds & Bees.\" Since her time on \"The X Factor,\" Sonenclar has developed a better idea of her unique style. Sonenclar has described herself as an \"indie rock girl at heart.\"\n\nIn July of 2020, Sonenclar released a new single, \"twenty-one,\" which she said was inspired by the tragically young passing of rapper Juice WRLD in December 2019, as well as by other musicians who died young, including Kurt Cobain, Amy Winehouse, and Mac Miller."
