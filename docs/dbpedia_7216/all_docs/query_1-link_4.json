The group consists of members Ally Brooke, Normani Kordei, Dinah Jane, Camila Cabello, and Lauren Jauregui. They signed a joint deal with Syco Music, owned by Simon Cowell, and Epic Records, L.A. Reid's record label, after finishing in third place on the show.\n\nFollowing their exit from The X Factor, they released their debut single \"Miss Movin' On\". Their debut EP, Better Together was released in 2013 with a first week position of number six on the U.S. Billboard 200. The following year, they won the Artist to Watch award at the MTV Video Music Awards.[1] The group released their debut studio album, Reflection in February 2015 debuting at number five on the Billboard 200 and receiving a gold certification from the RIAA.[2] The album included the platinum singles \"Boss\", \"Sledgehammer\" and \"Worth It\". The latter achieved triple platinum certification in the U.S. and reached the top 10 in thirteen countries. Their lead single, \"Work from Home\" from their sophomore album, 7/27, became the group's first top 5 single on the Billboard Hot 100.[3] With 7.5 million certified records sold, Fifth Harmony has emerged as the most successful alumni from the X Factor U.S. franchise.[4][5]\n\nCareer[]\n\n2012: The X Factor[]\n\nFifth Harmony is composed of five singers who all successfully auditioned as soloists on the second season of The X Factor USA in 2012, but failed to progress individually to the judges' houses stage of the competition. On 27 July 2012, they were formed as a group at the end of bootcamp by Simon Cowell and Demi Lovato, thus qualifying for the \"Groups\" category. Originally, the group's name was \"LYLAS\" (acronym for Love You Like a Sister), but another group called \"The Lylas\" (which consists of four of Bruno Mars' sisters) claimed that the show stole their name.[6] Thereafter, LYLAS changed their name to 1432 (which stands for I Love You Too), which was announced on the first live show on October 31, 2012, during which 1432 performed \"We Are Never Ever Getting Back Together\" by Taylor Swift. Simon Cowell and L.A. Reid were critical of the new name, and Cowell suggested that the group be renamed again. During the first live results show on November 1, 2012, 1432 performed \"Skyscraper\" by Demi Lovato in a sing-off with Sister C. Cowell decided to send 1432 through to the Top 12 and he announced that they would be renamed by the viewers online. The name chosen by the public was announced: \"Fifth Harmony\".[7]\n\nIn the semi-finals stage of the show, they performed Ellie Goulding's \"Anything Could Happen\" as well as Shontelle's \"Impossible\" (for the second time during the competition). Their performance of \"Anything Could Happen\" was \"a finals-caliber performance\" according to L.A. Reid and described as \"magic\" by Britney Spears.[8] Their performance of \"Impossible\" received mostly negative reviews from the judges because the group had previously performed the song at Simon Cowell's home (although not on The X Factor concert stage). Three members of the group (Camila, Lauren, and Ally) sang parts of the song in fluent Spanish. The following night's public vote results advanced Fifth Harmony to the final 3 along with Tate Stevens and Carly Rose Sonenclar. On the Top three live show, Fifth Harmony performed Ellie Goulding's \"Anything Could Happen\" for the second time as their \"Song of the Series\" song. Their second song was a duet with The X Factor judge Demi Lovato singing \"Give Your Heart a Break\". Their final song of the night was \"Let It Be\" by The Beatles, billed as their \"$5 million song\". After the first round of the finals they did not receive enough votes from the public to advance to the Top 2, and they finished in 3rd place on December 20, 2012.[9]\n\nThe X Factor performances and results Show Theme Song Order Result Dinah Jane Hansen Lauren Jauregui Ally Brooke Normani Hamilton Camila Cabello Auditions Free choice \"If I Were a Boy\" \"If I Ain't Got You\" \"On My Knees\" \"Chain of Fools\" \"Respect\" N/A Through to bootcamp Bootcamp 1 Free choice \"Hero\" \"E.T.\" \"Somebody That I Used To Know\" \"If I Ain't Got You\" \"Back to Black\" Through to bootcamp 2 Bootcamp 2 Group performance Not aired Through to bootcamp 3 Bootcamp 3 Duet performance \"Stronger (What Doesn't Kill You)\" (with Diamond White) \"These Arms of Mine\" (with Sister C) \"Knockin' on Heaven's Door\" (with Julia Bullock) \"What Makes You Beautiful\" (with Arin Ray) \"Your Song\" (with Jordan Shane) Regrouped/through to judges' houses Judges' houses Free choice \"Impossible\" Through to live shows Week 1 Made in America \"We Are Never Ever Getting Back Together\" 13 Bottom two Sing-off \"Skyscraper\" 8 Saved by Simon Cowell Week 2 Songs from Movies \"A Thousand Years\" 13 Safe (5th) Week 3 Divas \"Hero\" 8 Safe (6th) Week 4 Giving Thanks \"I'll Stand By You\" 6 Safe (7th) Week 5 Number-ones \"Stronger (What Doesn't Kill You)\" 4 Safe (4th) Week 6 Unplugged \"Set Fire to the Rain\" 4 Bottom three Pepsi Challenge songs \"Give Your Heart a Break\" 10 Final Showdown (Week 6) Free choice \"Anytime You Need a Friend\" 1 Saved by judges' vote (4th) Semi-final Contestant's choice \"Anything Could Happen\" 4 Safe (2nd) No theme \"Impossible\" 8 Final Favourite performance \"Anything Could Happen\" 3 3rd Place Celebrity duet \"Give Your Heart a Break\" (with Demi Lovato) 6 Winner's song \"Let It Be\" 9 Christmas song \"Christmas (Baby Please Come Home)\" 2\n\n2013–14: Better Together[]\n\nApproximately one month following the X Factor season 2 finale, on January 14, 2013, Fifth Harmony was voted the \"Next Pop Superstar of 2013\" by Popdust Magazine.

After her audition, she got a 'yes' from all four judges. After elimination during bootcamp, Cabello was called back to the stage along with four other female contestants to form the girl group that would later become known as Fifth Harmony.\n\nIn November 2015 Cabello released a duet with Canadian singer Shawn Mendes titled \"I Know What You Did Last Summer\".[93] The song has charted at number 20 in the US and 18 in Canada.[94] It was certified platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America.[95]\n\nDinah Jane[]\n\nDinah Jane Hansen was born in Santa Ana, California on March 3, 1997[96] to parents Gordon and Milika Fot'aika.
