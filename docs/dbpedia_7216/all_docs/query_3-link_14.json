        "text": "Carly Rose Sonenclar\n\nCarly Rose Sonenclar\n\nDreamed A Dream\n\nby Ally Abramson\n\nMany of us dream of participating in reality shows such as The Voice or American Idol. Carly Rose Sonenclar has lived this dream, starring on The X Factor where she took second place.\n\nSonenclar, a fifteen year old from New York, is no stranger to the performing game. Sonenclar began acting at the age of 7, playing Young Cosette in the Broadway version of Les Miserables. Sonenclar has also performed on television and earned many awards as a young performer.\n\nAlong the way, Sonenclar gained the support of hundreds of thousands of fans. These fans keep up with Sonenclar on YouTube, Twitter and various other social media outlets while she works on new music.\n\nThis new music can be heard during Carly Rose Sonenclar’s latest performing endeavor – an online concert. The concert, which will take place on August 3rd, is being held on stageit.com.\n\nThis will be one of Sonenclar’s first major performances not on The X Factor. Recently, Sonenclar sat down and answered some questions about the concert and her musical journey.\n\nCarly Rose Sonenclar\n\nHow did you discover that music was your passion?\n\nWhen I was very young my family and I would watch American Idol. I used to make believe I was a contestant and would sing along. My family would make believe they were Simon Cowell and the rest of the judges. That is part of the reason it was so surreal to actually perform for Simon years later!\n\nWho inspired you to get into the industry?\n\nMy brother Russ has always been a huge influence on my musical taste. He has a great eye for up and coming musical talent and has turned me on to some of my favorite performers.\n\nWhat was the best part of the experience of being on X Factor for you?\n\nI think the best part of being on The X Factor was having the opportunity to work with world class producers and industry professionals that I might not have had the opportunity to work with otherwise. Also, getting to perform live in front of a worldwide audience each week. It was an amazing experience and great preparation for future live performances.\n\nWhat was your personal favorite performance on The X Factor?\n\nI don’t know if I have one! I really enjoyed doing “It Will Rain” by Bruno Mars and “As Long As You Love Me” by Justin Bieber.\n\nCarly Rose Sonenclar at the SLANT Celebration\n\nYou also performed on Broadway. How did that differ for you? Which type of performance did you like more?\n\nPerforming on Broadway is a completely different experience. It was fun because you have to become a character and perform live shows eight times per week. It is so totally different than being a solo artist.\n\nHow do you think social media outlets like Twitter and Facebook have helped you in getting attention?\n\nUsing social media to is a great way to keep in touch with fans – especially those that are all over the world. It’s something that artists back in the day did not have.\n\nRecently you were able to meet up with some fans after a concert. What’s the best thing about meeting your supporters?\n\nMeeting fans in person is definitely one of my favorite things. I am so grateful to each and every one of them for their amazing support and being able to meet them in person and communicate that directly means a lot to me.\n\nCarly Rose Sonenclar\n\nYou are doing an online concert on August 3rd at Stageit.com. Why did you decide to do the concert this way?\n\nSince I am fortunate to have an international fan base, doing an online concert is a great way to perform live for everyone no matter where they live. And since I am still working on my album and am not able to go on tour yet, this is a great platform to let everyone hear what I have been working on.\n\nYou’re working on your debut album right now; how would you describe the album so far? Is there a specific theme you are going for, perhaps a specific sound?\n\nIt is such a fun experience. I’m enjoying working with some really cool producers and writers. I love writing and I get to do it a lot more often now which is great. There are many artists that inspire me like Ellie Goulding, Flume, as well as bands that I like such as Arctic Monkeys and the Black Keys. They help inspire me when I write.\n\nYou have some experience in acting already, with your music career blowing up are you moving away from acting, or do you hope to continue doing it as well?\n\nI am still pursuing acting. I love to do both and hope to have the kind of career that will allow me to do both.\n\nPhotos © 2014 Courtesy of Carly Rose Music."
