        "text": "Tatyana Marisol Ali was born on January 24, 1979, in North Bellmore, New York, to Sonia, a nurse from Panama, and Sheriff Ali, a retired police officer from Trinidad. At the age of four, she started singing and got a taste of fame when she begged her mother to take her to an audition for Sesamstraße (1969).\n\nShe went on to perform in many productions in her native New York, including the Broadway show \"Fences\"--with James Earl Jones and, later, Billy Dee Williams--and the off-Broadway show \"Orfeo del Campo\". When she was seven, she appeared on Star Search (1983) and won twice, receiving a four-star rating when she appeared for a second time. At age 11, Tatyana moved from New York to Los Angeles to establish her career and, not long afterwards, got her breakthrough role:Will Smith's cousin, \"Ashley Banks,\" from Der Prinz von Bel-Air (1990).\n\nWhile filming \"The Fresh Prince,\" she also had exciting side projects, including guest roles in television shows such as Die Bill Cosby Show (1984), The Mickey Mouse Club (1989) (aka \"The Mickey Mouse Club\"), Kyno's Storytime (1992), Grusel, Grauen, Gänsehaut (1990) and Foster's Field Trip (1994).\n\nThe public saw her grow on \"Fresh Prince\" from an adorable little girl to a stunning young woman, and she sang in several episodes of the show, most notably her rendition of Aretha Franklin's \"Respect\" and an original song, \"Make Up Your Mind.\" Smith was so impressed with her singing that he asked if she would consider doing it professionally. Tatyana began preparing for her singing career during the last year of the show as she began training her vocal cords, recording demos and publicly performing on television and in various informal live concerts. Her performances on \"The Fresh Prince\" actually helped her build a fan base that anxiously waited for her first album launch. On August 25, she released her album \"Kiss the Sky\" (MJJ Music/Work/SME) and her single \"Daydreamin'.\" The single was certified gold within weeks of its release, and it quickly rose on the Billboard Hot 100 Singles, where it reached #6 and stayed there for two weeks. She also contributed to major movies such as Crocodile Dundee II (1988) and Eddie Murphy: Raw (1987). Since then, she has had significant roles in two films, Von Rache besessen (1996) and Fakin' Da Funk (1997). She has also guest-starred in several sitcoms, including Ein schrecklich nettes Haus (1995), and had a cameo role in the film ...Denn zum küssen sind sie da (1997). She also went to Harvard and graduated with a degree in Anthropology in June 2002. She is now working on a new album and starring in more movies.\n\nLuke began his acting career at the age of five, appearing as Mel Gibson's son in \"We Were Soldiers.\" Not knowing how to read yet, he simply recited the pledge of allegiance-a move that would land him the role. He was also cast as \"Stevie Dewberry\" in the family film \"Because of Winn-Dixie\" at age eight, after choosing to audition with a toothpick in his mouth. The choice set him apart from the hundreds of boys vying for the role. The director, Wayne Wang, loved the idea and even used it in the film. In 2006, Luke was cast in Walden Media's \"How to Eat Fried Worms\" as the main character of \"Billy Forrester.\" However, it wasn't until he was a freshman in high school that Luke realized that acting was what he wanted to do for the rest of his life, so in 2012 the family permanently moved to Los Angeles.\n\nHis past TV credits include the television pilots \"Life on the Water,\" the WB's revival of \"Family Affair\" starring Tim Curry and Gary Cole, and the Disney Channel pilots \"Madison High\" and \"Zombies and Cheerleaders.\" Other credits include starring in the Disney Channel's original movies \"Minutemen\" and \"Girl vs. Monster.\" Luke's other past motion picture credits include playing the role of autistic teen \"Alan Wheddon\" in \"Dear John.\" As well as a vast collection of failed pilots, including Amazon's \"Point of Honor\", helmed by Carlton Cuse.\n\nBenward was born in Franklin, Tennessee, to Kenda Benward (née Wilkerson), an actress/coach, and Aaron Benward, a singer/ songwriter. His grandfather, Jeoffrey Benward, was a Contemporary Christian music singer. Part of an entertainment family, Luke got his acting bug by tagging along to auditions with his mother, actress, acting coach and CMT's first on-air personality, Kenda Benward. He got his musical heritage from his father, Aaron Benward, an award-winning producer, songwriter and recording artist. Luke is truly a triple threat. He studied dance with hip hop choreographer, Nick Bass (Britney Spears, Chris Brown, Christina Aguilera, and Michael Jackson) for four years. He also recorded his first five-song EP called Let Your Love Out in 2008 and supported that effort with a fall and spring 50 city tour.\n\nBenward resides in Los Angeles, California .\n\nThis summer Kelli Berglund will star in the highly-anticipated, STARZ drama \"Heels,\" alongside Stephen Amell, Alexander Ludwig and Alison Luff. Written by Michael Waldron and directed by Peter Segal, \"Heels\" is set in a close-knit Georgia community and follows a family-owned wrestling promotion, as two brothers and rivals war over their late father's legacy. Berglund shines as Crystal, a 20-year-old wrestler's valet who yearns to transform out of her traditional day job and compete as a wrestler. \"Heels\" is slated to premiere August 15, 2021.\n\n\"Heels\" marks Berglund's return to STARZ, following a lead role in the network's sexy and vibrant Steven Soderbergh-helmed series \"Now Apocalypse.\" The series made its premiere as a Sundance selection in 2019 and Berglund was immediately deemed a breakout as Carly Carlson, being called \"a feisty pleasure\" (The Hollywood Reporter), \"a sharp-tongued highlight of the series\" (Collider), with \"great comic timing\" (AV Club), and the \"perfect level of don't-give-a-f*ck\" (Rolling Stone). Additional recent credits for Berglund include appearing as young Gwen Verdon in the Emmy-winning limited biopic series \"Fosse/Verdon\" for FX, the Apple original film \"Cherry,\" opposite Tom Holland and Ciara Bravo, and recurring on TNT's longstanding, hit drama series \"Animal Kingdom.\" In 2020 she appeared opposite Adam Sandler in Netflix's mystery/comedy \"Hubie Halloween.\"\n\nBerglund began her career in entertainment with a starring role as Bree Davenport from 2012-16 on Disney XD's hit series \"Lab Rats\" and \"Lab Rats: Elite Force.\" While on \"Lab Rats,\" Berglund also starred in the Disney Channel Original Movie \"How to Build a Better Boy,\" opposite China Anne McLain and Noah Centineo, which became a smash hit for the channel. In theatre, Berglund brought her dancing, singing, and acting skills to the stage, starring as Belle in Pasadena Playhouse's featured winter production \"Beauty and the Beast: A Christmas Rose\" (2017). Produced by Lythgoe Family Panto, the play offered an updated version of the classic tale, featuring family-friendly magic with a comedic twist, dancing, contemporary music, and more.\n\nA California native, Berglund has worked closely over the years with the Audrey Hepburn CARES Center, in association with the Children's Hospital Los Angeles, which provides services for suspected victims of child abuse and their families, as well as People Concern, an organization aiming to end homelessness across LA county. She is also an accomplished dancer and has been honored with a number of awards for her talents in lyrical, contemporary, ballet, pointe, hip-hop, tap, and jazz.\n\nBerglund currently resides in the Los Angeles area.\n\nCameron Boyce was an American actor, with Afro-Caribbean and African-American descent. His paternal grandmother Jo Ann Allen was one of the \"Clinton Twelve\", the first African-Americans to attend an integrated high school in the Southern United States (specifically in Clinton, Tennessee).\n\nIn 1999, Boyce was born in Los Angeles, California. He was trained as a dancer from an early age. In 2008, he made his debut in the music video \"That Green Gentleman (Things Have Changed)\" by the band \"Panic! at the Disco\". He was playing a child version of guitarist Ryan Ross. Also in 2008, Boyce gained a recurring role in the short-lived soap opera \"General Hospital: Night Shift\" (2007-2008).\n\nBoyce's first appearance in a feature film was in the horror film \"Mirrors\" (2008), playing the role of Michael \"Mikey\" Carson (the son of the film 's protagonist). His second film appearance was in the spy film \"Eagle Eye\" (2008), playing the role of Sam Holloman. His next prominent film role was in the comedy film \"Grown Ups\" (2010), again playing the son of the film's protagonist.\n\nBoyce showcased his dancing skills in the web series \"The Legion of Extraordinary Dancers\" (2010-2011). In 2011, Boyce appeared as a featured dancer in a \"Dancing with the Stars\" special and in the television sitcom \"Shake It Up\" (2010-2013). He made a guest appearance in the sitcom \"Good Luck Charlie\" (2010-2014), playing an impostor version of regular character Gabe Duncan.\n\nBoyce next gained the co-starring role of Luke Ross in the sitcom \"Jessie\" (2011-2015). The premise of the series was that celebrity couple Morgan and Christina Ross had no free time to spend with their four children, so they hired aspiring actress Jessie Prescott (played by Debby Ryan) as a full-time nanny and surrogate mother to the kids. Luke was the second oldest child, who viewed Jessie as a love interest. The series was a ratings hit for Disney Channel. It lasted for 4 seasons, and a total of 98 episodes.\n\nBest known for his role as 'Ravi Ross' on Disney Channel's hit series \"Jessie\" and its spinoff, \"Bunk'd,\" Karan Brar is taking Hollywood by storm and seeking to break cultural barriers in the entertainment industry. He stars in \"Bunk'd\" on Disney Channel and 2018 will be a major year for Karan as he breaks out of his Disney roles for some exciting new projects including the Legendary Entertainment/Universal Pictures film \"Pacific Rim: Uprising\" and the YouTube Red teen dramedy series, \"Youth and Consequences.\"\n\n\"Pacific Rim: Uprising\" is a science-fiction monster film produced by Guillermo del Torro. The film is a sequel to the 2013 film \"Pacific Rim\" and also stars John Boyega, Scott Eastwood, and Jing Tian. Karan plays 'Suresh,' a new cadet for the Jaeger pilot program. To prepare for the role, Brar worked out with a personal trainer for several months both before and during shooting of the film, which included stunt and fight training as well as a monitored diet. The film is set to be released early 2018.\n\nBorn and raised in Bothell, Washington, Karan pursued various sports to try to break out of his shell and find his 'niche'. He soon realized sports were not going to be his calling in life, and his father, who had done theater in India, suggested that he try acting. After a few workshops and acting classes, Karan discovered he was far more talented and comfortable on stage than he was on the field. So, at the age of eight, he signed with an agent and quickly booked his first commercial.\n\nNot long after, Karan's big break came when he landed the role of 'Chirag Gupta' in Twentieth Century Fox's hit trilogy based on the New York Times best-selling book series, \"Diary of a Wimpy Kid.\" The films included: \"Diary of a Wimpy Kid\" [2010], \"Diary of a Wimpy Kid: Rodrick Rules\" [2011] and \"Diary of a Wimpy Kid: Dog Days\" [2012]. However, it is Karan's role as 'Ravi' on \"Jessie\" that truly put Karan on the map. In \"Jessie,\" Ravi was a recent immigrant to the United States who was struggling to adapt to his new surroundings, while still trying to hold on to his Indian culture and religious beliefs. Since then, Ravi has adjusted and come into his own, bringing his considerate and sometimes naïve but hilarious personality to life in \"Bunk'd.\"\n\nWith Karan's family originally being from Punjab, India, he understands the importance and responsibility of portraying the Disney Channel's first-ever series regular Indian character. Brar has helped the channel diversify culturally, while sharing his native Indian culture with its target audience of kids and families. On the other hand, as a first-generation Indian-American, Karan also feels strongly that it is his duty to show his fans and the entertainment industry that he is more than the cliché \"Indian character,\" and he has something much greater to offer.\n\nKaran has several other projects under his belt as well, including NBC's \"The Night Shift\" where he played a young Afghan drug dealer, the Disney Channel Original Movie, \"Invisible Sister\" and guest-star appearances on several Disney Channel shows. Brar also voiced the character of 'Mason' in Twentieth Century Fox's \"Mr. Peabody & Sherman\" and 'Prince Zandar' in Disney's \"Sophia the First.\"\n\nWhen he is not busy lighting up the big or small screens, Karan enjoys quality time with his friends doing anything that can get them outdoors, from beach trips to hiking and travel adventures. He also spends time working on his photography and videography techniques. Karan enjoys playing video games and discovering new music as well. His philanthropic efforts include lending his voice as a celebrity ambassador for Thirst Project, the world's largest youth water organization whose goal is to build a socially-conscious generation that will end the global water crisis. Brar also has a passion for helping those affected by or who have loved ones affected by mental illness. He hopes to help remove the stigma around the topic and let others know it is something that is okay to discuss. Karan currently resides in Los Angeles.\n\nDarcy Rose Byrnes has been performing since she was only 3 years old.

Her second competition was a Latin competition for The Hollywood DanceSport Championships. She danced a rumba to the recording of her own song \"Chasin' the Picture,\" which was about \"Sofia the First\" ending. She earned a first-place medal for the dance.\n\nDarcy Rose started homeschooling halfway through second grade and tested out of her high school program when she was just 15 years old.

Cameron played Liz Larson in her first non-Disney film, Barely Lethal, which was theatrically released by A24 Films in 2015.\n\nCameron starred in the television film Descendants which premiered on July 31, 2015.

Other songs from the film featuring Cameron such as \"Set It Off\" and \"Evil Like Me\" charted at No. 6 and 12 respectively on the Bubbling Under Hot 100 chart. The soundtrack for the movie peaked atop the Billboard 200 chart becoming the first soundtrack from a Disney Channel Original Movie since High School Musical 2 to do so. As part of the Descendants franchise, Cameron released a cover of Christina Aguilera's hit song, \"Genie in a Bottle\". The music video premiered on Disney Channel on March 18, 2016. The single received 22 million views in less than a month.\n\nOn December 22, 2015, Liv and Maddie was officially renewed for a fourth season, becoming the 9th live-action Disney Channel show in history to achieve this. Cameron began filming the season of Liv and Maddie in early 2016. It was later announced that this would be the final season of the show. The series finale of Liv and Maddie later aired on March 24, 2017.\n\nCameron played the role of Amber Von Tussle in the NBC live television presentation of Hairspray Live!, which aired on December 7, 2016.

The Descendants 2 soundtrack debuted at #6 on the Billboard 200, with \"It's Goin' Down\" from the soundtrack debuting at #81. This became Cameron's third Hot 100 entry, following \"Rotten to the Core\" and \"If Only\".\n\nCameron played the role of Sophie in the Hollywood Bowl live production of Mamma Mia!. The show took place from July 28, 2017 to July 30, 2017. On August 21, 2017, Cameron was cast in the film Dumplin, starring Jennifer Aniston. Cameron is set to play Bekah Cotter in the comedy. In late 2017 Cameron signed on to appear in a recurring role in Season 5 of Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.. This role was later revealed to be Ruby, the daughter of General Hale (Catherine Dent).\n\nEmmy-winning talk show host Ellen Lee DeGeneres was born in Metairie, Louisiana, a New Orleans suburb. She is the daughter of Betty DeGeneres (née Elizabeth Jane Pfeffer), a speech therapist, and Elliott Everett DeGeneres, Jr., an insurance agent. Her brother is musician and producer Vance DeGeneres. Her parents divorced when she was 16 years old. Her mother remarried, and her new husband, salesman Roy Gruessendorf, moved the family to Atlanta, Texas.\n\nAfter graduating from Atlanta High School in 1976, Ellen attended the University of New Orleans as a communications major, but she dropped out after one semester. She held a wide variety of jobs until she turned to stand-up comedy, making her bones at small clubs and coffeehouses before working her way up to emcee Clyde's Comedy Club by 1981. Her comedy was described as a distaff version of Bob Newhart. Beginning in the early 1980s, she toured nationally and was named the funniest person in America after winning a competition sponsored by the cable network Showtime. This led to better gigs, including her first appearance on The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson (1962) in 1986.\n\nThough DeGeneres's early forays into series television were not successful (she appeared as a supporting player in two short-lived TV situation comedies in the period 1989-92, Open House (1989) and Frau Doktor kommt (1992)), she scored a hit headlining her own 1994 sitcom on ABC \"These Friends of Mine\" (renamed Ellen (1994) after its first season). She made TV history in April 1997, when her character, and DeGeneres personally, revealed that she was a lesbian. However, the show was canceled the following season due to declining ratings, after which DeGeneres returned to the stand-up circuit. In 2001, DeGeneres launched a new series, The Ellen Show (2001), on CBS, but it suffered from poor ratings and was canceled.\n\nRedemption as a television artist came in 2003, when DeGeneres's daytime talk show, Ellen: The Ellen DeGeneres Show (2003), proved to be both a critical hit and a commercial success. Along with good ratings, the show has won unprecedented kudos from the industry, winning 15 Emmy Awards in its first three seasons on the air and becoming the first talk show in TV history to win the Emmy Award for Outstanding Talk Show in its first three seasons.\n\nDeGeneres has also made a name for herself as a host of awards shows. She hosted the Grammy Awards in 1996 and 1997, as well as the Primetime Emmy Awards in 2001 and 2005. In February 2007, she had the ultimate TV awards show gig, hosting the Oscars, which she hosted again in 2014."
