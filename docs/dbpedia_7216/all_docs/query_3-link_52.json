        "text": "Carly Rose Sonenclar is headed back to TV.\n\nThe X Factor season two runner-up, who was mentored by Britney Spears during the competition, tweeted on Thursday that she’ll appear as a guest star in an upcoming episode of NBC‘s Law & Order: SVU.\n\nSonenclar even posted a photo from her day on set, featuring a director’s chair and what looks like her face on screen in the background.\n\nPHOTOS: ‘The X Factor’ Finale in Pictures: A Country King, a Teen Diva and a Girl Group\n\nThe 14-year-old will draw on personal experience for the role. She’s been cast as Grace, a contestant on a popular televised music competition, in an episode titled “Dissonant Voices,” The Hollywood Reporter has learned. The episode is tentatively scheduled for Oct. 30, but that is subject to change.\n\nA fan favorite on The X Factor, Sonenclar consistently remained in the top two viewer-voted slots during the live broadcasts. Earlier this year, Sonenclar confirmed to multiple outlets that Simon Cowell‘s Syco Entertainment had picked up her recording option, though a distribution deal with a label has yet to be announced.\n\nThe New York City native has previously appeared on Broadway as Young Cosette in Les Miserables and she originated the role of Chloe in the short-lived Wonderland."
