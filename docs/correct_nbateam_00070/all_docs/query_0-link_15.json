        "text": "Sixers fans hoping for a Kyle Korver reunion got disappointing news Saturday afternoon.\n\nThe veteran sharpshooter is reportedly signing a deal with the Milwaukee Bucks, per ESPN's Adrian Wojnarowski.\n\nKorver's decision was down to the Bucks and the Sixers. Ultimately, Korver chose the Bucks because of his relationship with head coach Mike Budenholzer. It makes sense. Korver enjoyed the best stretch of his career in four-plus seasons with the Atlanta Hawks, including his only All-Star appearance. The 2014-15 Hawks, which featured Sixers general manager Elton Brand and forward Mike Scott, won 60 games and got to the Eastern Conference Finals.\n\nWhile the Sixers could've used Korver's shooting to help space the floor, he's 38 years old - he'll turn 39 in March - and would've occupied the team's 14th roster spot. It's a slight disappointment, but not a huge concern. With all things even between the Sixers and Bucks as far as both teams' ability to contend, Korver chose to play for his former coach.\n\nThe veteran free agent pool is getting thinner, but there are a couple guys that might be able to help. Iman Shumpert is a veteran wing with championship experience. Shaun Livingston has even more of that experience from his time with the Warriors. Thabo Sefolosha is a 3-and-D type that is used to fitting into roles on winning teams.\n\nThe Sixers on Friday signed 7-foot-4 center Christ Koumadje to an Exhibit 10 deal, which we explained here. Koumadje is more likely getting a look for the Delaware Blue Coats than anything. The team has the minimum 13 players signed to guaranteed NBA deals. The maximum is 15.\n\nPhiladelphia 76ers\n\nComplete coverage of the Philadelphia 76ers and their rivals in the NBA from NBC Sports Philadelphia.\n\nClick here to download the MyTeams App by NBC Sports!
