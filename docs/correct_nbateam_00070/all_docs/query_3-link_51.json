        "text": "Editor's note: Below is a 2007 feature by former Register sports writer Rick Brown on the Korver family of Pella. The Korver brothers — Kyle, Kaleb, Klayton and Kirk — were all standout Iowa high school basketball players who later played in college. Kirk Korver died suddenly March 21, 2018 at the age of 27.\n\nPella, Ia. — The visitor's locker room at PCM of Monroe High School seems an odd place for a family reunion. Unless your last name is Korver.\n\nInside that locker room, four brothers representing three levels of basketball celebrated a milestone Friday night.\n\nKaleb, a senior guard at Pella High School, had scored his 1,000th career point in a 64-55 victory. Pella coach Mark Core invited Kaleb's older brothers — Kyle, a guard with the NBA's Philadelphia 76ers, and Klayton, a junior forward at Drake — to be part of a postgame celebration.\n\nKaleb had been struggling with his shot, but Kyle worked with him Friday afternoon.\n\n\"He got my shot straight,\" Kaleb said after scoring 26 points.\n\nA fourth brother, Kirk, a sophomore on the Pella team, was also there to soak it in. In two years, he could join his three brothers in the 1,000-point club. Pressure?\n\n\"They've all handled pressure really well,\" Kirk said. \"I'm good to go.\"\n\nMORE: Kirk Korver died from sudden illness, family spokesperson tells Register\n\nThe Rev. Kevin Korver stood in front of his congregation Sunday and preached on the power of prayer.\n\nAll 800 seats in the sanctuary of Third Reformed Church were filled, listening to a man who has been senior pastor the past 14 years.\n\n\"I was sitting at a basketball game the other night ... I know that probably surprises you,\" Korver said, transitioning into a point he was about to make.\n\nKorver and his wife, Laine, estimate they've gone to nearly a thousand basketball games to watch their four sons compete.\n\nThe Korvers are Iowa's first family of basketball.\n\n\"We've got one at every level,\" Kirk said. \"Pretty cool.\"\n\n==========\n\nKevin and Laine both played basketball. Kevin, along with his four brothers, were all-state selections in Paramount, California. Kevin also played at Central College.\n\nOne of Laine's high school coaches at Montezuma was Tony DiCecco, now women's coach at Northern Iowa.\n\n\"I can't shoot anymore,\" Laine said. \"But Kevin can.\"\n\nWhen the family gets together, a game of H-O-R-S-E usually breaks out. They take turns winning.\n\n\"When there's money on the table, and it's really serious, Kyle wins,\" Kevin said.\n\nJuggling busy lives with basketball schedules is a time-consuming labor of love.\n\n\"We actually feel like this is one of our easiest years, because we have two kids on one team and Drake is just 45 minutes from our driveway,\" Laine said.\n\nThey also try to get to Philadelphia at least once during the season to spend time with Kyle, and they watch most of his games on television thanks to a satellite package and technology.\n\n\"We'll be coming home from a game at night and check the (76ers) score,'' Laine said. \"With TiVo, you can watch a game in 45 minutes.''\n\nThe Korvers used to watch NBA games with the volume turned down because they didn't like the way opposing announcers were taking their son to task for being a one-dimensional player.\n\n\"It got so frustrating,\" Kevin said. \"But he's been in the league four years now. He's starting to do more things than shoot 3s. They haven't been bagging on him so much, so we listen more.\"\n\nWhen they attend games, Kevin is ice. Laine is fire.\n\n\"Mom gets pretty excited,\" Kyle said. \"She cheers for everyone. Dad just sits there, and smiles, and enjoys it.\"\n\nWhen Kyle was playing in high school, Kevin fretted if his son didn't play well.\n\n\"But with so many games at so many levels, it's not nerve-wracking anymore,\" Kevin said.\n\nKlayton attended a recent Pella-Grinnell game, a tug-of-war the Little Dutch eventually won 51-49.\n\n\"I was getting real nervous,\" Klayton said. \"My mom said, 'Now you know what I go through six times a week.' They want us to win and do well. But maybe you start to get a little numb after a while.\"\n\n==========\n\nThe Korvers have spent many a night in Missouri Valley Conference arenas, with more to come. Kyle was an all-American at Creighton. Klayton is at Drake. Kaleb has signed with Creighton.\n\n\"I think Kyle set a good standard,\" Creighton coach Dana Altman said. \"And Kaleb and Klayton, even Kirk, are all trying to play to that standard.\"\n\nNext season will turn into a family feud of sorts when Drake meets Creighton.\n\n\"It's like two sets of in-laws who don't quite see eye-to-eye on everything,\" Laine said.\n\nMORE: LeBron James offers condolences to teammate Kyle Korver\n\nKyle Korver bobbleheads were sold at Saturday's Creighton-Drexel game, with proceeds going to his foundation that raises money for Omaha charities.\n\nKlayton didn't get one.\n\n\"I don't want a Creighton bobblehead,\" Klayton said. \"Even if it is Kyle.\"\n\nKyle laughed at his brother's response.\n\n\"Blood is thicker than any color, any mascot,\" Kyle said. \"We're always going to have each other's back and cheer for each other. But that will be a tough one next year. For mom, especially.\"\n\nKaleb picked Creighton over Drake, a decision that brought a lot of emotional soul-searching for the family.\n\n\"Three (Division I players) from the same family is remarkable,\" Drake coach Tom Davis said. \"That's quite a family.\"\n\nOne factor that made Kaleb choose Creighton is that time has passed since Kyle, a two-time Valley player of the year, wore the uniform.\n\n\"Kyle is still a real big name here,\" Altman said. \"The legend kind of grows as the years go by. But I think enough time has passed now to where Kaleb can come in and be his own man.\"\n\nKaleb acknowledges the sneakers he will follow.\n\n\"But at the same time, if I'm going to be compared to Kyle, that's not a bad thing,\" he said.\n\nThe lines of communication are open after every game.\n\n\"I talk to Klayton after pretty much all his games, and to Kaleb and Kirk, too,\" Kyle said. \"We talk about what is going on with our teams. Anything positive, any frustrations. Because there's both. I've been through situations they're going through now, and I share with them what helped me.\"\n\n==========\n\nKyle and Klayton arrived at the PCM gym just before halftime. Minutes later, Kaleb drained a deep 3-pointer. His older brothers smiled and nodded in unison.\n\nIn the third quarter, Kaleb faked, spun in the lane and swished a shot to the sound of a whistle. Traveling.\n\n\"No way,\" Kyle said.\n\nKirk snared a tough rebound and started a fast break.\n\n\"Way to go, Kirk,\" Klayton screamed.\n\nLaine took it all in with a big smile. All four sons were in the same gym.\n\n\"This is really fun,'' she said."
