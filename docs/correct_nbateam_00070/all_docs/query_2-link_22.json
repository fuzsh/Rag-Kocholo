        "text": "PHILADELPHIA – Kyle Korver, less than two months away from his 34th birthday and in his 12th NBA season, is playing as well as he ever has.\n\nThe former Pella High School star is putting up numbers that are nearly unprecedented.\n\nNow in his third season as a guard/forward for the Atlanta Hawks, Korver is not the least bit surprised by this.\n\n\"I feel like as you get older, as long as your body doesn't break down, you should get better,\" Korver said after a recent victory over the Philadelphia 76ers. \"I should be a better shooter every year, because I've shot so many more shots, every single year. A lot of it just depends on taking care of yourself, and that's been a big emphasis for me the last few years.\"\n\nHis off-season conditioning goes beyond the conventional. Also contributing to his late-career renaissance is the Hawks' share-the-wealth style. Everybody gets touches and shots.\n\n\"We don't necessarily have that superstar guy,\" Korver said. \"When you feel like you have an opportunity every single time down the court to be a part of what's happening, you just naturally play a little bit harder.\"\n\nAtlanta, as a result, has become the talk of the league. Through Tuesday, the Hawks had won 13 consecutive games, and 27-of-29, to improve to 34-8, best in the Eastern Conference.\n\nThe Hawks' style of play is reminiscent of last year's NBA champions, the San Antonio Spurs. That stands to reason, since second-year coach Mike Budenholzer spent 19 years in San Antonio as an assistant to Gregg Popovich.\n\nKorver was scoring 13.2 points a game through Monday, the second-best average of his career, and shooting 51.5 percent from the floor, a league-leading 53.6 percent from 3-point range and 92.2 percent from the free-throw line.\n\nAt his present rate, he would not only match his NBA single-season record for 3-point accuracy (established in 2009-10), he would become just the second player in league history to make more than half of his shots from the floor and arc, while nailing better than 90 percent at the line. Current Golden State Warriors coach Steve Kerr did it in 1995-96 while playing for the Chicago Bulls.\n\nKorver pays little attention to the numbers.\n\n\"I try to make the shots that I do shoot,\" he said. \"I try to be consistent.\"\n\nHis preparation is without equal. As noted in a recent Sports Illustrated report, he has been a regular client at Peak Performance Project (P3), a training center and research lab in Santa Barbara, Calif., since 2008. The analysis he underwent there caused him to change the way he jumped, so as to reduce the strain on his troublesome left knee. He also improved his lateral quickness.\n\nIt was through his relationship with P3 founder Marcus Elliott that he became involved in misogi, a Japanese purification ritual. The last two off-seasons, Korver, Elliott and two other men have undertaken daunting physical challenges.\n\nIn 2013, they paddleboarded 27 miles while standing up, a journey of some nine hours. In '14 they took turns carrying a boulder weighing over 80 pounds three miles underwater, which took nearly six hours.\n\n\"Once you get past the, 'Man, this is so hard, I don't know if I can make it,' you fall into this, 'OK, what do I have to do to make it?' \" Korver said. \"And you start just trying to do the smallest things perfect, and you focus on the detail, and you get lost in the detail. And eventually that detail's not the detail. A new detail is the detail. That's what carried over for me into shooting, and for taking care of my body.\"\n\nThe results are inarguable — and nearly unprecedented.\n\nIOWANS IN THE NBA\n\n• Devyn Marble (Iowa), Orlando Magic\n\n• Doug McDermott (Ames), Chicago Bulls\n\n• Harrison Barnes (Ames), Golden State Warriors\n\n• Kirk Hinrich (Sioux City), Chicago Bulls\n\n• Kyle Korver (Pella), Atlanta Hawks\n\n• Luke Zeller (Ames), Phoenix Suns\n\n• Nick Collison (Iowa Falls), Oklahoma City Thunder\n\n• Reggie Evans (Iowa), Sacramento Kings\n\n• Wesley Johnson (Iowa State), Los Angeles Lakers"
