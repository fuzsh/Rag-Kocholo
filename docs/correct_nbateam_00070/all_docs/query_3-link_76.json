        "text": "Former NBA wing Kyle Korver is returning to the Atlanta Hawks in a front office role. He was previously a player development coach with the Brooklyn Nets last season. While this role will not be coaching he still brings a familiar face and 17 years of NBA experience with him to his old team. Korver spent four seasons and some change with the Atlanta Hawks where he averaged his career best and earned his lone All-Star appearance. He only played longer with the Philadelphia 76ers in his career.\n\nIn his 17-year NBA career, Kyle Korver averaged 9.7 points, 3.0 rebounds, and 1.7 assists per game. He paired those numbers with a field goal percentage of 44.2 percent and a three-point percentage of 42.9 percent. The former NBA wing is considered one of the best shooters in NBA history and was a talented role player in his career. His role with the Atlanta Hawks should help the team continue to develop into playoff contenders.\n\nThe Atlanta Hawks have made aggressive moves to try and compete for an NBA Championship with Trae Young. Adding Kyle Korver to the front office can help the team add more experience and perhaps one day win an NBA Championship."
