        "text": "The oddsmakers have had their say, as have the Sixers themselves.\n\nAfter immersing itself fully in the NBA’s summer swap meet, Philadelphia has the fourth-best odds to win next season’s championship, behind the Clippers, Bucks and Lakers. And during a news conference last Friday introducing the team’s four new additions (Al Horford, Josh Richardson, Raul Neto and Kyle O’Quinn) and re-introducing Tobias Harris and James Ennis III, the team’s managing partner, Josh Harris, told reporters he is “really confident” about what lies ahead.\n\nHis sentiments were echoed by general manager Elton Brand, who said he and the others in the brain trust are “doing everything we can to bring another championship to the city of Philadelphia.”\n\nEnnis had gone a step further, telling Philly.com earlier in the week that with Kawhi Leonard’s defection from Toronto to the Clippers, the Sixers were “going to walk to the Finals.”\n\nHe retreated only slightly from that stance during the presser, telling the assembled Fourth Estate that he was confident in his teammates, as well as Brand and coach Brett Brown.\n\n“And,” Ennis said, “I know all our guys want to win. As a competitor, we want to win all the time. So, it’s going to be tough — it’s the NBA — but I believe.”\n\nFair enough, but far as anyone can tell, Milwaukee plans to play out the season. Boston might very well might be better courtesy of addition by subtraction, seeing as the Celtics let Kyrie Irving — immensely talented, but also reportedly divisive — flee to Brooklyn. Indiana stole Malcolm Brogdon from the Bucks. And Toronto, while weakened by Leonard’s loss, is still formidable.\n\nThere also remains the question about whether the Sixers have enough shooting. The 12 guys on their roster who have played in the NBA to date have combined to shoot 35.7 percent from 3-point range in their careers, which is a tick above the 2018-19 league average (.355), and a tick below what the Sixers shot this past season (.359), the league’s eighth-best norm.\n\nNeto (.377), Horford (.368), Richardson (.368) and Tobias Harris (.364) are the top returning shooters, and Zhaire Smith was 6-for-16 from the arc as a rookie (.375.). Yet the Sixers don’t have a proven sniper like the departed J.J. Redick (.413), fueling speculation that they will make a run at Kyle Korver, released last Wednesday by the Suns.\n\nThe 38-year-old Korver spent the first four-plus of his 16 seasons with the Sixers, and is a career 42.9 percent 3-point shooter. ESPN.com’s Adrian Wojnarowski reported last week he is considering not only Philadelphia, but the Bucks and Lakers.\n\nThere would appear to be no downside to bringing him in. Long renowned for his professionalism (particularly his fastidious conditioning), he would thrive in whatever role he is asked to fill — and it would figure to be a limited one, given the Sixers’ glut of wings (Harris, Richardson, Ennis, Smith, Mike Scott and rookie Matisse Thybulle) and his own defensive deficiencies. But if you need someone to make a shot, no matter the spot, Korver is as good an option as any.\n\nNBCSports Philadelphia’s Paul Hudrick suggested last week that Thabo Sefolosha or Ryan Anderson wouldn’t be bad options to fill out the Sixers’ roster, either. (Trey Lyles was also on Hudrick’s list, but he has since signed with San Antonio.)\n\nBut Korver is the best option to help complete an increasingly promising puzzle."
