        "text": "As expected, the Phoenix Suns released veteran sharpshooter Kyle Korver shortly after acquiring him in a trade, and a few contenders are expected to pursue him as a free agent once he passes through waivers.\n\nLast week, ESPN’s Adrian Wojnarowski had reported that the Philadelphia 76ers, Lakers and Bucks were all expected to be under consideration for the 38-year-old.\n\nThe Lakers were viewed as the favorite since Korver is from Southern California, has experience playing with LeBron James, likely wants to win a ring before he retires and there was opportunity in Los Angeles for playing time.\n\nNow, it could be more likely Korver signs with the Sixers or Bucks if playing time is a factor.\n\nSince the start of free agency, the Lakers have filled out their roster around James and Anthony Davis with a handful of shooters and wings, including Danny Green, Kentavious Caldwell-Pope, Quinn Cook, Avery Bradley and Jared Dudley, all of whom would likely play over Korver if he signed with them.\n\nThe Sixers, on the other hand, still have a bench group with only two proven veterans (Mike Scott and Kyle O’Quinn) and nobody on the roster who is a knockdown three-point shooter at the level of Korver. They’ve drafted two wings in the first round the last two years (Zhaire Smith and Matisse Thybulle) but it’s unclear how ready either of them will be to contribute right away, at least on offense.\n\nEven at 37 last year, Korver was still one of the best shooters in the NBA, making 39.7 percent of his threes on five attempts per game with the Jazz and Cavaliers.\n\nAt least at the start of the season, Korver would seemingly be one of the first Sixers’ players off the bench, though his defensive limitations might limit exactly how much coach Brett Brown can play him if/when his shot isn’t falling.\n\nThe Bucks are another interesting option for Korver, as they lost Nikola Mirotic, Malcolm Brogdon and Tony Snell this offseason and in terms of shooters only added Wesley Matthews.\n\nIf Korver signs with the Sixers, Bucks or Lakers — all considered legitimate contenders to make the NBA Finals, though the Bucks and Sixers have a better shot — it will only be for the minimum of $2.56 million."
