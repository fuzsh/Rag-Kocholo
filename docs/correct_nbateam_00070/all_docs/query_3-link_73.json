        "text": "Some, like Babe Ruth, were ousted for debt. Fellow baseball Hall of Famer Dave Winfield was traded for an extravagant dinner.\n\nOn the hardwood, there’s Kyle Korver, whose well-told story of his amusing draft-day swap received an update over the weekend.\n\nBut let’s start at the top.\n\n“The 51st pick, to the New Jersey Nets,” Korver said Saturday, as he delivered a commencement speech at his Creighton alma mater, “I found out shortly afterwards that I had been traded to Philly. I’m not sure if traded is the right word.\n\n“I was more or less sold for an undisclosed amount of money. I later found out (the Nets) used that money to pay for the entry fee for their summer league team, and with the leftover money, they bought a copy machine.”\n\nKorver, of course, is still going strong at 38-years-old. Currently a member of the Jazz, he’s among the greatest three-point shooters in NBA history.\n\n“We gave away a good player for summer league,” then-Nets general manager Rod Thorn told Grantland in 2014. “It was just one of those things we had to do. At least, that’s how I rationalized it.”\n\nAs for that copy machine?\n\n“…A couple of years ago, that copy machine broke. And I’m still playing.”"
