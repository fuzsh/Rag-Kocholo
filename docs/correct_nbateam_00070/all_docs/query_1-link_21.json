        "text": "The Phoenix Suns have waived Kyle Korver after acquiring him in a trade with the Memphis Grizzlies, a move that isn’t very surprising. According to Adrian Wojnarowski of ESPN, once Korver clears waivers, he will consider signing with the Sixers, Los Angeles Lakers or Milwaukee Bucks.\n\nThe Phoenix Suns have waived forward Kyle Korver, the team announced Monday, clearing the way for the veteran sharpshooter to become a free agent.\n\nKorver -- whose expiring contract could be waived for the cost of $3.4 million -- will consider signing with the Los Angeles Lakers, Milwaukee Bucks and Philadelphia 76ers once he clears waivers, league sources told ESPN’s Adrian Wojnarowski.\n\nThe 38-year-old Korver isn’t as strong an overall player as he once was, but he’s still an above average three-point shooter with some of the league’s strongest gravity and spacing ability. For a Sixers team that is thin on shooters, Korver presents arguably the best remaining option on a veteran minimum and could give the Sixers a solid 12-15 minutes a night off the bench. And after losing JJ Redick to the New Orleans Pelicans, the Sixers could effectively slot Korver into their system in a very similar way that they used Redick.\n\nJudging by Korver’s list of destinations, he’s looking to compete for a title in what could be his final NBA season. While Korver has connections to LeBron James in Los Angeles (the two played together as recently as 2017-18), Korver also has a history with the Sixers organization. Korver started his NBA career in Philly, playing his first four seasons on Broad Street, and he was teammates with General Manager Elton Brand down in Atlanta during the 2013-14 and 2014-15 seasons."
