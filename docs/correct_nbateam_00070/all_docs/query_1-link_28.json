        "text": "Jason Miller/Getty Images\n\nThe Philadelphia 76ers added Jimmy Butler in a blockbuster trade Saturday, but they may not be done.\n\nKevin O'Connor of The Ringer reported Saturday that the Sixers \"talked a trade with the Cavaliers for Kyle Korver during the offseason and retain interest now, according to league sources.\"\n\nAdding more shooting for the Sixers would make sense after they dealt two of their better three-point shooters, Robert Covington and Dario Saric, to the Minnesota Timberwolves in the trade for Butler. Philly also sent Jerryd Bayless and a 2022 second-round pick in the deal, getting back Justin Patton as well.\n\nIn Butler, Joel Embiid and Ben Simmons, the Sixers now have a Big Three to build around. All three of those players need floor-spacing around them, however, and while players like JJ Redick and Landry Shamet will help in that regard, adding another marksman from the perimeter would be ideal.\n\nKorver, 37, remains a sniper. He's shooting 38.7 percent from three this year and is a career 43.1 percent shooter from beyond the arc. While he's getting just 15.3 minutes per game off the bench in Cleveland for a woeful 1-11 Cavaliers team, ceding time to some of the team's younger players, Korver could provide key shooting and spacing for a contending team like the Sixers.\n\nIf not Korver, the Sixers may have other options. O'Connor noted that the New York Knicks' Courtney Leeis \"also available,\" while the Sixers could wait to see what options shake out in the buyout market. One player who would fit perfectly in Philadelphia as a three-and-D wing would be Trevor Ariza if the 2-10 Phoenix Suns ultimately decide to cut him loose to give his minutes to younger players.\n\nRegardless, the Sixers would be wise to surround their new Big Three with shooting. The team went on a 16-game winning streak to close last season, in large part because of the increased floor spacing the Sixers added by acquiring Marco Belinelli and Ersan Ilyasova on the buyout market. That gave Simmons kick-out options on the perimeter when he collapsed the defense in transition, while Embiid had options to pass to when he was doubled in the post.\n\nButler is solid if unspectacular from deep, shooting 37.8 percent from three, but he also would benefit from spacing, allowing him room to operate in isolation or down in the post. For Embiid, Simmons and Butler, learning to play together and develop chemistry will be key this season. Doing so without the benefit of shooters around them will make that process all the more difficult."
