        "text": "Longtime NBA guard Kyle Korver is retiring as a player and joining Steve Nash’s staff with the Brooklyn Nets as a player development assistant coach, The Athletic reported Thursday, August 12.\n\nKorver, 40, last played in the league in the 2019-20 season with the Milwaukee Bucks. In 17 NBA seasons, he averaged 9.7 points and 3.0 rebounds per game over 1,232 games (423 starts).\n\nHe retires fourth all-time in career three-pointers made with 2,450, though Nets star James Harden is likely to surpass him early next season.\n\nThe then-New Jersey Nets drafted Korver in the second round in 2003 and traded his rights to the Philadelphia 76ers for $125,000 in cash. As the story goes, the Nets used some of that money to buy a new office copy machine.\n\nHe never played for the Nets, but now joins them in a player development capacity after suiting up for the Sixers (2003-07), Utah Jazz (2007-10, 2018-19), Chicago Bulls (2010-12), Atlanta Hawks (2012-17), Cleveland Cavaliers (2017-18) and Bucks.\n\nKorver was named an All-Star one time: in 2014-15 with Atlanta, a season that he finished with averages of 12.1 points, 4.1 rebounds, 2.6 assists, a 48.7 shooting percentage, and a 49.2 rate from three-point range in 75 games (all starts)."
