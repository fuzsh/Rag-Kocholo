        "text": "There was a lot of talk about the Philadelphia 76ers “running it back” with their roster from last season.\n\nMaybe they will actually run it all the way back to 2006.\n\nMore specifically — the Sixers might be in the running to bring Kyle Korver back to the team that drafted him. The sharpshooter was traded for the second time this offseason on Wednesday, dealt from the Memphis Grizzlies to the Phoenix Suns in a deal also involving former No. 4 overall pick Josh Jackson.\n\nPer ESPN’s Adrian Wojnarowski, the Suns are expected to buy out Korver’s contract, and the Sixers are one of three teams expected to contend for his services. The other two: Lakers and Bucks.\n\nThe Sixers, of course, drafted Korver in the second round out of Creighton back in 2003. He was traded during his fifth season with the team to the Utah Jazz.\n\nIn the 11 years since then, Korver has remained one of the NBA’s elite three-point shooters and even made an All-Star team in 2015 with the Hawks.\n\nHe shot nearly 40 percent from three last season in time split between the Cavaliers and Jazz, who traded him to the Grizzlies earlier this offseason.\n\nAfter the loss of JJ Redick, the Sixers are severely lacking three-point shooting options on their roster and Korver would provide a major upgrade in that area.\n\nThe Sixers don’t have any remaining cap space, though, so they’d only be able to pay Korver $2.5 million, though the Bucks are in the same boat and the Lakers will be if they sign Kawhi Leonard."
