        "text": "Atlanta's Jeff Teague is at the center of recent trade rumors. Big man Al Horford is also a focus in speculation. Now, swingman Kyle Korver has joined the trade rumors as well.\n\nAccording to ESPN Cleveland, the Cavaliers have \"interest\" in acquiring Kyle Korver. While there are no suggested deals in place, ESPN's Brian Windhorst suggests that Atlanta may be \"selling off pieces\" at the upcoming NBA trade deadline. Another report from ESPN explains the Hawks will entertain deals for Horford and Teague, but Korver is expected to remain in Atlanta.\n\nIt's hardly surprising, however, to learn that Cleveland is interested in Korver. Many teams would be interested the talented shooter. Last season, Korver was an All-Star and had the best 3-point percentage (.492%) in the Eastern Conference. Only Golden State's Stephen Curry (286) and Klay Thompson connected (239) on more 3's than Korver's impressive 221 -- which was 13 more than James Harden's 208.\n\nThis year, however, Korver and the Hawks (last year's top team in the Eastern Conference) have fallen off a bit. His 3-point percentage has dropped to .383%. His scoring rate has dropped from 12.1 PPG to 9.3 PPG. The Hawks had a .773% winning percentage with Korver as a starter last season; this year Atlanta has a .538% winning percentage when Korver starts.\n\n“We talk to each other as teammates and keep a lot of stuff in the locker room but I think for the most part we have to understand that last year is last year and this year is this year,” said Korver, via MyAJC.com. “We haven’t really achieved anything in the grand scheme of things.”\n\nIt's unclear what Cleveland could offer in return for Korver, however, considering Atlanta would require value back trading away a marque starter. Cleveland has a lot of indispensable pieces they'd be unlikely to trade, unless Korver was part of a bigger deal including Al Horford. That, however, seems significantly more unlikely."
