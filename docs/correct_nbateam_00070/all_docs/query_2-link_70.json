        "text": "You Can Blame Tobias Harris For That Game 6 Loss\n\nJoel Embiid scored 39 points. Tyrese Maxey dropped 12 in the 4th quarter. Those two bits of information would likely lead you to believe the Sixers forced a game 7. But there is one little problem. Tobias Harris.\n\nThe most expensive player on the team scored 0 points. He only took 2 shots. On top of that, he only grabbed 4 rebounds. Harris played 29 minutes but was invisible the entire time. For the majority of the game, the Sixers were playing 4 on 5.\n\nTobias Harris Ends His Sixers Career With A Whimper\n\nAt times, Tobias Harris has received too much hate. For most of this 5-year, $180 million contract, he was a decent player. Not a max-worthy player, but a decent player.\n\nHe played good defense, averaged 17 points per game, and grabbed rebounds. Not enough to be a max player, but still a net positive for the team.\n\nFans took out their frustrations on him because he was an easy target and did not live up to his contract. It didn’t help that there was the stigma that the Sixers chose him over Jimmy Butler. In truth, they chose Brett Brown and Ben Simmons over Jimmy Butler. Harris was the punching bag though.\n\nTonight he proved his haters right. He crumbled like one of his cookies. He was worse than bad. Bad would be trying and failing. He disappeared like Casper the Friendly Ghost. Vanished into thin air.\n\nIf Harris scored 5 points, they win. If he scored his usual 9 for this series, they win. But he scored 0, and was never even trying to actually score. They could have put any random player on the end of the bench in, and he would have given them at least as much as Tobias Harris did.\n\nWasting A Great Night By Joel Embiid\n\nThe worst part is, other than the Sixers season being over, they wasted a great night from Embiid. There was so much talk about how he falling short in elimination games. He took heat in game 5 despite his team winning, and his defense playing a part in that win.\n\nTonight he dropped 39 though, to go with 13 rebounds. 22 of those points came in the 2nd half.\n\nSadly he was not on the court at the very end, because his team somehow failed to foul Jalen Brunson, forcing Embiid to eventually foul someone. It was his 6th, and he had to leave the game.\n\nBut even on one leg, and with one good eye, he was the best player on that court. He imposed his will on the Knicks.\n\nIt went to waste though. Because two starters couldn’t find a way to score a single point. I didn’t even talk yet about Lowry dropping a goose egg as well.\n\nTwo Guys Let The Team Down\n\nMaxey and Oubre did their part. Maxey could have done more earlier in the game, but he made up for it in the 4th. Off the bench, Buddy Hield and Nico Batum had great games, with Hield hitting 6 3s for 20 total points.\n\nBut because 2 guys couldn’t contribute, the Sixers season is over.\n\nKyle Lowry is 38 and clearly just doesn’t have the legs anymore to play significant minutes. That is not an excuse, and he deserves some. He might just not be a good player anymore though\n\nBut Harris is 31. He is a max player. He should be the 3rd option on this team. For some years, he was. In this series, he wasn’t even their 5th best option.\n\nIt is hard to blame an entire game on 1 or 2 guys. But you go down the line, and nearly everyone else did their part. Harris and Lowry are the only outliers. Their 0s stick out like a sore thumb in a box score where everyone else besides Paul Reed had good games.\n\nNo More Tobias Harris\n\nI tried all these years to be a Tobias defender. I pointed out many times that his defense on Jayson Tatum kept them in that Celtics series.\n\nEven this year I went to bat for him. When people said they wanted to trade him for scraps just to be rid of him, I said he had more value on the team than away from it.\n\nI was wrong. If in this series, they had an average NBA player, they would have won it. If there was anyone at that spot who had a pulse, they would have won the series. Instead they had Tobias Harris.\n\nSo I was wrong. I apologize for sticking up for the guy all these years. For once, the haters were right.\n\nThe only good thing about this loss is we won’t have to deal with him anymore. They can hopefully take that money they paid him, and get someone who won’t crumble in important games.\n\nGood riddance. I don’t think we have ever seen a player go out with this little of a fight. That includes Ben Simmons.\n\nListen To Or Watch ‘The Best Show Ever?’ Live On The 97.5 The Fanatic And On NBC Sports Philly From 2 To 6 p.m. every Weekday\n\nDylan MacKinnon is The Digital Content Coordinator For 97.5 The Fanatic. he has been an Eagles, Flyers, Sixers, and Flyers fan his whole life.
