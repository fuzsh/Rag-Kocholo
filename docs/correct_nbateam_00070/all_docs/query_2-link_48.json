This season, the 6’6”, 220-pound guard has played in 22 games and averaged 4.3 points and 1.7 rebounds in 12.7 minutes per game, while shooting 40.2% (40-104) from the field and 35.3% (12-34) from three-point range.\n\nThe Croatian native was acquired by the Jazz on February 19, 2004 from Orlando and appeared in 226 games for Utah, where he compiled averages of 8.9 points, 2.1 rebounds and 1.4 assists in 20.7 minutes per game.\n\nGiricek played for the Croatian National Team in the 2005 European Championships and was named to the 2005 All-Eurobasket Second Team. He also competed in the 1998, 1999, 2000 and 2001 Croatian League All-Star Games (named MVP of the 1998 and 2000 All-Star Games). Additionally, he was named to the NBA All-Rookie Second Team and during the 2003 All-Star Weekend, he competed in the got Milk? Rookie Challenge and won the Rookie Hoopz Skills competition.\n\nCurrently in his fifth NBA season, Korver (6-7, 210, Creighton) has appeared in 337 regular season games, all with Philadelphia, and owns career averages of 10.5 points, 3.2 rebounds, 1.6 assists while hitting .409 from three-point range. He appeared in 25 games this season for the 76ers, averaging 10.0 points, 2.9 rebounds and 1.3 assists in 26.3 minutes.\n\nKorver holds the 76ers franchise record for three-pointers made in a season (226 in 2004-05) and owns three of the franchise’s top-10 single-season marks for three-point accuracy. Korver also ranks second on the team’s career list for three-pointers made (661) and has twice been selected to participate in the NBA All-Star Weekend Three-Point Shootout.\n\nOriginally selected by the New Jersey Nets in the second round (51st overall pick) of the 2003 NBA Draft, Korver’s rights were traded to Philadelphia in a draft-night deal. Prior to his NBA career, the Lakewood, Calif., native played four years at Creighton University, where he finished as the school’s fifth all-time leading scorer.\n\n“On behalf of the entire Sixers organization, I want to thank Kyle for the positive impact he has made on this team and the city of Philadelphia through his play on the court and, even more importantly, his philanthropic efforts off of it,” Stefanski said.\n\n“We made a trade which we feel improves our team this year,” said Jazz general manager Kevin O’Connor.\n\nInsideHoops.com editor says: The Jazz wanted Giricek to be a consistent shooting force. With this trade they upgraded to Korver, who actually is that. With Boozer inside, Deron Williams operating on one side of the floor, Korver can make it rain from three-point range on the opposite side. Good deal for the Jazz. As for the 76ers, they get rid of Korver's contract, which wasn't huge but was still more than they wanted to keep paying, and get Giricek plus a first rounder. I think this is a smart deal for both teams.\n\nI think we are all kinda shocked because Korver for a role player almost has a star type reputation more from his college days though. Like some have said you have a new Philly regime and really Korver is having by far his worst season. I wonder if your watching a guy who comes in and does nothing but shoot alot wonder about that players role? Korvers minutes are down but his shots have remained the same about 9 per 26 minutes and factor lows in shooting%. Down 4.5 ppg from last season.\n\nOne thing I agree with the key off the bench these days is Louis Williams. You can see when he was OUT and less the 100% for a few games how they suffered. Williams has shown he can knock down the three and Giricek career wise isnt to far from Korvers numbers(41% to 37%). Really Korver is only as good as he shots.\n\nSo cleaning out a contract ( whose players value could be diminishing), getting a 1st rounder and getting a player maybe with a chip on his shoulder who fits better in the second unit or allows Green to go back to the 2nd unit seems like an odd but solid fit.\n\nSixers have played well I think in spite of Korver..reasons are obvious why Utah would do the deal. They dont really need anything besides a shooter and backup PG. Hard to imagine a college kid will walk in as good a shooter as Korver so really all you did was spend some dough..\n\nFrom the Philly Inquirer:\n\nIn an effort to create more salary cap space, the 76ers traded Kyle Korver today to the Utah Jazz for Gordan Giricek and a first round draft pick.\n\nGiricek, who is making $4 million this season, has an expiring contract.\n\nKorver, who is earning nearly $4.4 million this year, has $15.4 million owed to him in the next three years after this one.\n\nThe first round pick is protected, according to Sixers president and general manager Ed Stefanski.\n\nThe pick can start in 2009 and the Sixers have seven years in which to make it. There are different protections for each year, according to Stefanski.\n\nTeams protect picks in case they are in the situation to receive a high choice, thus not losing it.\n\nStefanski estimated that the Sixers are $10 million under next year’s salary cap, which may be the most room any team has in the league.\n\n“We felt this was a move for the plan that we have made to look to try to secure cap space in the summer,” Stefanski said via conference calls. “The pick could be a player or a chip in a future trade.”\n\nAs for how Giricek will fit into the team, Stefanski says that it will be up to coach Maurice Cheeks.\n\nStill, Stefanski said that Korver’s trade benefits four players as far as receiving more playing time – Thaddeus Young, Willie Green, Rodney Carney and Lou Williams.\n\nLike Korver, Giricek is known as a perimeter shooter. This season he has had scant playing time and is averaging 4.3 points per game.\n\nKorver, who has had an up and down season, has is averaging 10 points.\n\nIronically, the Sixers and will meet the Jazz Wednesday in Utah.\n\nGiricek is expected to join the Sixers for Sunday’s game in Portland against the Trail Blazers.\n\nStefanski, realizing that Korver was among the most popular players with his teammates and the fans,\n\n“Kyle, even though I haven’t been personally here in his career, I’ve seen his work from afar and he is a good basketball player that you hate to lose,” Stefanski said. “Besides a good basketball player, he is better as a person.”\n\nStefanski said that Korver took the news with class.\n\n“He was gracious,” Stefanski said. “He is a terrific young man.\"\n\nGroup I: The \"Big 8\" ETO candidates\n\nThese are the players with an \"early termination option\" in their contracts, meaning they can opt to forgo the final year(s) of their deals and become unrestricted free agents in the summer of 2008. In most years, two or three big stars have this option. In 2008, there are eight, as the provisions of recent collective bargaining agreements kick in big-time. Here's the star-studded lineup:\n\n1. Elton Brand, Clippers -- The Clippers and Brand are both in limbo. The team looks lottery-bound again and, to stay competitive, Donald Sterling is going to have to pay Brand, Corey Maggette, Sam Cassell and Shaun Livingston.Brand is the most important piece, but he may also be the most coveted free agent on the market. He turns 29 in March, but as long as he recovers from his ruptured Achilles tendon, he seems to be the player who has the most to offer in free agency.\n\nTo keep from losing money, Brand will need a team to pay him a starting salary of $16.5 million. No one has that kind of cap room, though teams like the Sixers and Bobcats could make some moves to get further under the cap. The question is, obviously, would either of those teams really be an upgrade from the Clippers? If Brand bolts the Clippers, then the Clips themselves would have some serious cap room.\n\n2. Gilbert Arenas, Wizards -- Arenas has turned himself into a max player the past few years and, despite recent knee troubles, will likely opt out of his contract to cash in on his newfound celebrity status. While he continues to maintain publicly that his first choice is to re-sign with Washington, it's not inconceivable that, given his eccentricity, he could change his mind. The biggest issue for Arenas is the same that plagues all the free agents: Who else really has the money to pay him?\n\n3. Shawn Marion, Suns -- Marion has been unhappy in Phoenix for the past few years and has wanted a huge extension. And, given his age, this may be his last chance to garner a big, long-term deal. He's also been mentioned in trade rumors for the past few years. On paper, he looks like the type of free agent who would opt out. But Marion has a number of factors working against him. He turns 30 in May, is scheduled to make a whopping $17.8 million next season and would likely have to take a major pay cut if he opts out. The Suns are looking for financial security (which means they'd like to try to sign him for less than what he makes right now) and the rest of the teams in the league just won't have the money to pay him.\n\nA sign-and-trade looks like a real possibility, but if the Suns have been trying hard to move him the past few years and have been unable to make a deal … what's going to change next summer?\n\n4. Baron Davis, Warriors -- Davis showed up at camp in the best shape of his career -- a sure sign that he's eyeing opting out this summer. He's as good as any point guard in the game when he's healthy and motivated. But he also turns 29 in April and is rarely healthy for a full season. Will he stay motivated to stay in shape once he gets a big deal?And again … who can afford him? It seems more likely that he stays in Golden State.\n\n5. Jermaine O'Neal, Pacers -- O'Neal has his reasons to opt out. The Pacers don't look like contenders and, at 29, this is his last chance to get a big, long-term deal.However, given O'Neal's huge salary next year ($20 million) and his lack of productivity and durability so far this season, it's hard to see him opting out at this point.\n\nWhere's he going to go and where's he going to find that type of money?\n\n6. Allen Iverson, Nuggets -- Iverson turns 33 in June, is scheduled to make $21 million next season and has watched his productivity fall each of the past three seasons.To make matters worse for AI, Philly is the only team with significant room and I don't think the Sixers are bringing him back.\n\n7. Corey Maggette, Clippers -- Maggette has been on the trading block for years and appears to be eager to bolt the Clippers. He's making $7 million next season and should be due a raise.Teams will be out in force to get him, but most will have only the midlevel exception to offer -- which means he'd be taking a pay cut. We'll see how bad Maggette wants out.\n\n8. Ron Artest, Kings -- I wonder if the Kings won't be encouraging Artest to opt out. Clearly the team is no longer a contender and having Artest on a rebuilding team makes no sense. Artest still has great talent and he's on a reasonable contract … but who goes after him? He might be a guy who's better off taking a midlevel deal in the right situation. He needs to do something to rehab his image. Maybe this is it."
