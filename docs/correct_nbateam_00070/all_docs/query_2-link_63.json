        "text": "The NBA in its 75th year honored its best ever, selecting an anniversary team of 75 players that included familiar names like Wilt Chamberlain, Julius Erving, Allen Iverson and Charles Barkley.\n\nWith that in mind, The Inquirer decided to look at the Sixers’ best ever and rank them. While 75 might have been too ambitious, we created our own list of the 50 best players to ever lace up for the Sixers (and the Syracuse Nationals before them).\n\nIn order to do so, we polled a team of current and former Inquirer writers, considering each athlete’s on-court accomplishments in Philly and the legacy they left behind.\n\nLet the debate begin.\n\n50. Kyle Korver\n\nSixers years: 2003-07\n\nAmong the best moves made by GM Billy King was purchasing Korver from the New Jersey Nets on draft night in 2003 after he was selected in the second round, 51st overall out of Creighton. ... An outstanding shooter, he averaged just 4.5 points per game as a rookie but then was a consistent double-figure scorer, averaging 12.4 points and shooting 41.6% from three-point range in his next three full seasons with the team. ... Known for his hard work and dedication, he twice played all 82 games for the Sixers.\n\nKorver will be known as one of the best shooters in team history and is third on the team’s all-time three-point percentage list (.409). He also led the NBA in free-throw percentage (.914) during his last full season in Philadelphia, 2006-07, and shot .880 from the foul line as a Sixer.\n\n» If you value this kind of journalism, please subscribe today.\n\n49. Tim Thomas\n\nSixers years: 1997-99\n\nAveraged 9.8 points and 3.4 rebounds in 20.9 minutes over 94 games with the Sixers. ... He made the All-Rookie second team. ... He totaled 27 points and six rebounds as a rookie in a 1998 February loss to New Jersey.\n\nThomas played part of his first two seasons with the Sixers, after he was acquired in the draft-night trade that sent the rights of top overall pick Keith Van Horn to the Nets. Thomas was then dealt (with Scott Williams) to the Milwaukee Bucks midway through his second season, after his averages dipped to 4.6 points and 1.9 rebounds in 17 games.\n\n48. Mike Gminski\n\nSixers years: 1987-90\n\nGminski was a vital scorer for the Sixers, averaging 14.9 points per game. ... He was also a beast on the boards, averaging 9.0 rebounds per game over in four seasons.\n\nGminski, a former ACC Player of the Year with Duke, averaged 16.9 points and 10.0 rebounds per game in his first season with the Sixers. He averaged over 17 the following year, leading the Sixers to an Atlantic Division title and ranks as one of a handful of NBA players to have grabbed over 6,000 career rebounds.\n\n47. JJ Redick\n\nSixers years: 2017-19\n\nSet a franchise record for most three-pointers in a season (240) in 2018-19. ... He hit 40.7% of his three-point shots on 7.3 attempts per game in his two seasons, and hit eight long balls in a game three times. ... He averaged a career-high 18.1 points per game, at age 34, in 2018-19.\n\nA key veteran role player for the post-Process teams anchored by Joel Embiid, Ben Simmons, and Jimmy Butler who spaced the floor with his lethal three-point shooting.\n\n46. Rick Mahorn\n\nSixers years: 1989-91, 1998-99\n\nDemanded a trade after being picked up by Minnesota in the 1989 NBA expansion draft and the Sixers acquired him for three draft picks. ... Physical play made him a popular player in Philadelphia, teaming with Charles Barkley with the two going by the moniker “Thump and Bump”. ... Averaged 8.9 points and 7.1 rebounds in his first two years and started all 18 playoff games in that span before going to play in Italy. ... He returned to the Sixers for his final season in 1998-99 but played sparingly.\n\nMahorn, a member of Detroit’s “Bad Boys” 1989 NBA championship team, was expected to bring that playoff savvy to the Sixers, but Michael Jordan and the Chicago Bulls knocked them out in five games in 1990 and 1991. He reportedly told Barkley that Jordan needed to be knocked down if he drove to the basket but Barkley said he didn’t like that idea.\n\n45. Andre Miller\n\nSixers years: 2006-09\n\nMiller played three seasons for the Sixers, averaging 15.9 points, 4.3 rebounds and 6.9 assists. … He helped the Sixers make two postseason appearances and played well, producing 21.2 points, 6.3 rebounds and 5.3 assists in the 2008-09 playoffs. … He appeared in 82 games in two of his three seasons in Philly.\n\nMiller provided veteran savvy to a young Sixers team with Andre Iguodala, Lou Williams, and Thaddeus Young on the roster. With serious athletes around, Miller’s passing ability helped unlock the ability of players around him. A pass-first player, Miller also scored more for the Sixers than at any point in his career. He topped out at 17.0 points in 2007-08.\n\n44. Archie Clark\n\nSixers years: 1968-71\n\nClark will never get his due with the Sixers because he was traded from the Los Angeles Lakers along with Darrel Imhoff and Jerry Chambers for Wilt Chamberlain in July 1968, the year after the Sixers won the NBA title. ... Clark played three full seasons with the Sixers (he was traded one game into the 1971-72 season to Baltimore) and averaged 18.2 points and 4.7 assists. ... Even though the Sixers declined after trading Chamberlain, they qualified for the playoffs in all three seasons, but were eliminated each year in the first round.\n\nKnown for his crossover move, which was called “shake and bake”, Clark was a two-time All-Star, but never with the Sixers. Clark averaged 19.4 points and 4.4 assists in 17 postseason games for the franchise.\n\n43. Paul Seymour\n\nSixers years: 1949-59\n\nA 6-1 combo guard, Seymour was literally a coach on the court. … In addition to playing 10 seasons for the Syracuse Nationals, he was a player-coach, replacing Al Servi after 12 games in 1956-57 and staying through the 1959-60 season, his final one as a player. … A three-time NBA All-Star and two-time second-team All-NBA selection, Seymour was a key member of the 1954-55 NBA champions, averaging 14.6 points, 6.7 assists and 4.3 rebounds in a team-high 41 minutes per game.\n\nSeymour was known for his foul shooting. He finished in the Top 10 three times in free throw percentage, shot above 80% in each of his final seven full seasons and finished with a .792 percentage in the regular season and .824 in the playoffs. He is also known for once playing an NBA record 67 minutes in a playoff game (along with teammate Red Rocha) in a 111-105 four overtime loss to Boston during a 1953 Eastern Division semifinal game.\n\n42. Henry Bibby\n\nSixers years: 1976-80\n\nA three-time national champion at UCLA, Bibby was a guard on two Sixers teams that advanced to the NBA Finals, albeit both losses, in 1977 and 1980. ... He was a starter on the 1977 team and a key reserve on the 1980 squad. ... Bibby had 15 points and 11 assists, which was a postseason high, as the Sixers beat Portland, 107-89, to go up 2-0 in the 1977 NBA Finals before the Trail Blazers would win the next four games.\n\nBibby was known for his dependability, missing just one game in his four seasons with the Sixers. He was one of the team’s top bargains, as the Sixers bought his rights in September 1976 from the New Orleans Jazz.\n\n41. Jrue Holiday\n\nSixers years: 2009-13\n\nAppeared in the NBA’s Rookie Challenge as a 19-year-old first-year player. ... Holiday helped lead the Sixers to the postseason twice, including a second-round appearance in 2012. ... He made the 2013 NBA All-Star game in his fourth season.\n\nStarting his career as a scoring guard for the Sixers, Holiday is one of the players who got away for fans in Philly. After a solid start to his career that included an All-Star appearance and two postseason appearances, Holiday matured into one of the league’s best defenders and won an NBA title with the Milwaukee Bucks.\n\n40. Luke Jackson\n\nSixers years: 1964-72\n\nA true power forward (and sometimes center) at 6-foot-9 and 240-pounds, Jackson spent his entire eight-year NBA career with the Sixers. ... He was the starting power forward on the 1966-67 championship team, playing all 81 games for the 68-13 Sixers and averaging 12 points and 8.9 rebounds.\n\nWhile overshadowed on the championship team by Hall of Fame teammates Wilt Chamberlain, Hal Greer, Chet Walker, and Billy Cunningham, Jackson will be remembered for his strong postseason that year, averaging a double-double, 11.0 points, 11.7 rebounds in 36.2 minutes over 15 games. During the clinching 125-122 win over the San Francisco Warriors in Game 6, Jackson had one of his best all-around games, with 13 points and a playoff career-high 21 rebounds.\n\n39. Aaron McKie\n\nSixers years: 1997-2005\n\nAaron McKie played eight seasons in Philly. ... But it was his 11.6 points per game off the bench during the 2000-01 season that locked up NBA Sixth Man of the Year honors. ... He also helped fuel the Sixers’ run to the NBA Finals.\n\nAaron McKie is Philly hoops royalty as a star at Simon Gratz, leading the Bulldogs to the 1990 Public League championship followed by being one of the all-time scoring leaders at Temple and helping the team make it to the NCAA Elite Eight in 1993. His Sixers career was the cherry on top of the career of a local legend.\n\n38. Thaddeus Young\n\nSixers years: 2007-14\n\nSelected with the No. 12 pick in the 2007 NBA draft after one season at Georgia Tech, young made the 2008-09 All-Rookie Team as a second-team selection. ... Young averaged 13.7 points and 5.5 rebounds in seven seasons with the Sixers. ... He made the postseason four times as a member of the Sixers, including the 2008-09, when he averaged 12.0 points and 4.5 rebounds. ... Young was traded to the Minnesota Timbers during the 2014-15 season.\n\nYoung will be remembered as a member of a young team driven out of Philly as “The Process” entered full swing. While players like Young, Jrue Holiday, Lou Williams and Andre Iguodala experienced menial success with the Sixers, they were never going to get over the hump. And the Sixers realized that and moved in another direction.\n\n37. George Lynch\n\nSixers years: 1998-2001\n\nA strong defensive swingman on the 2001 NBA finalists, Lynch was the only player to appear in all 82 regular season games that year, but then suffered a broken bone in his left foot. ... Was limited to 10 postseason games, including just two in the NBA Finals, where he played under 14 total minutes. ... While not much of a factor, his ability to play hurt and attempt to help a banged up team in the five-game championship series loss to the Los Angeles Lakers was looked on positively by the fan base. ... His best Sixers stat was averaging 1.5 steals per game in his three seasons.\n\nLike Eric Snow, Lynch was a favorite of coach Larry Brown because of his character and selfless nature, never worrying about scoring. He will never be known for statistics, having averaged 8.8 points in his three seasons but he was a willing defender who the team missed greatly for the majority of the 2001 NBA Finals.\n\n36. Johnny Dawkins\n\nSixers years: 1989-94\n\nSucceeded Hall of Famer Maurice Cheeks as the team’s point guard in 1989 after the Sixers acquired him from San Antonio for Cheeks. ... He went on to play five of his nine NBA seasons with the Sixers, averaging 10.7 points and 5.7 assists. ... He started 81 games in his first season of 1989-90 and, after being limited to four games the following year because of a torn ACL, started all 82 games for the team in 1991-92. ... He played more of a backup role in his final two seasons.\n\nThe Sixers were looking to get younger by unloading Cheeks, the last representative of their 1983 NBA championship team, and Dawkins played well although he did not reach the level of Cheeks in his prime.\n\n35. Lou Williams\n\nSixers years: 2005-12\n\nWilliams led the Sixers in scoring with 14.9 points per game during the 2011-12 season despite not starting a single game. He finished that season as the NBA sixth man of the year. … After averaging 1.9 and 4.3 points in his first two seasons, Williams went on to average double-figure scoring in each of his remaining five Sixers seasons. … Williams hit a three-pointer with a 8.1 seconds left to lead the Sixers to an 86-82 victory in Game 4 of their 2011 Eastern Conference first-round series against the Miami Heat to avoid a series sweep.\n\nWilliams, who went by the nickname Lou Will, was a fan favorite in Philadelphia. He blossomed into one of the league’s all-time best reserves after being selected by the Sixers directly out of high school with 45th overall in 2005.\n\n34. Dana Barros\n\nSixers years: 1993-95\n\nA guard with unlimited range, Barros only played two seasons with the Sixers, but earned his lone All-Star appearance with the team during the 1994-95 season when he averaged 20.6 points and shot 46.6% from three-point range. ... During his two Sixers seasons he averaged 16.9 points and only missed one game. ... His best Sixers game came in a 136-107 loss to the Houston Rockets on March 14, 1995, when Barros scored 50 points, hit 21 of 26 from the field and 6 of 8 from three-point range.\n\nBarros was known for long-range shooting and is second on the Sixers career list for three-point percentage (.426). He played for teams that went a combined 49-115 in his two Sixers seasons, but besides only missing one game, he also averaged a career-high 40.5 minutes during his All-Star season in 1994-95.\n\n33. Chris Webber\n\nSixers years: 2004-07\n\nAveraged 17.9 points, 9.3 rebounds and 3.4 assists in 114 games during parts of three seasons. ... He totaled 19 points and six rebounds in a 2005 first-round playoff win over Detroit, the Sixers’ only postseason victory during Webber’s tenure. ... His first and last games as a Sixer were losses to his previous team, the Sacramento Kings.\n\nThe future Hall of Famer joined the Sixers via a blockbuster trade from the Kings to pair with Allen Iverson. After microfracture knee surgery, Webber was productive but no longer the All-Star-caliber player he was with Sacramento. He was bought out in 2005.\n\n32. Jimmy Butler\n\nSixers years: 2018-19\n\nButler averaged 18.2 points, 5.3 rebounds and 4.0 assists in his lone season as a Sixer . ... He elevated the game in the second round of the playoffs, averaging 22.0 points, 7.0 rebounds and 5.6 assists against the Toronto Raptors. … Although he was an All-Star snub during his lone season in Philly, Butler is a six-time All-Star and five-time All-Defensive selection.\n\nButler was the heart and soul of the 2018-19 Sixers team and a major reason why it took the eventual NBA champion Raptors to seven games in conference semifinals.\n\n31. Larry Costello\n\nSixers years: 1957-68\n\nCostello spent 10 seasons with Syracuse/Philadelphia as a heady point guard, a dogged defender who was among the last to employ a two-hand set shot. ... He is tied with Charles Barkley for fifth in franchise history with most All-Star selections (6). ... Costello, who also coached the Milwaukee Bucks to the 1971 NBA championship, averaged 12.9 points and 4.7 assists in his Nationals/Sixers career.\n\nHe was a member of the 1966-67 NBA championship team, one that was 38-4 when Costello was sidelined with an Achilles tendon injury. Costello, who averaged 7.8 points and 2.9 assists that season, returned late that year, but appeared in just two playoff games.\n\n30. Jerry Stackhouse\n\nSixers years: 1995-98\n\nA No. 3 overall pick of the 76ers and considered by some to be “The next Michael Jordan”. .... Gave fans some hope in an otherwise bleak time when the team won 40 games in his two full seasons. ... After averaging 19.2 points and making the All-Rookie team his first year, Stackhouse took off in a 1-2 punch with rookie Allen Iverson, combining for more than 44 points per game. ... However, Larry Brown eventually decided that the Stackhouse-Iverson grouping could not work and traded Stackhouse to the Detroit Pistons early in his third season.\n\nThe Stackhouse trade might have been one-sided in the Pistons’ favor but the Sixers got back Aaron McKie and Theo Ratliff, two keys to their 2000-01 championship run. The deal really worked well for Stackhouse, who made two All-Star appearances and averaged 29.8 points in 2000-01, almost beating out Iverson for the scoring crown.\n\n29. Red Kerr\n\nSixers years: 1954-65\n\nA three-time All-Star, all with the Syracuse Nationals, Kerr played all but one of his 12 NBA seasons with the Nationals/Sixers. ... He is seventh in team history in total points (11,699). ... As a rookie in 1954-55, he was a key performer on the franchise’s only NBA championship while in Syracuse, averaging 10.5 points and 6.6 rebounds while shooting a team-high 41.9% from the field.\n\nKerr will always be known for his durability. He never missed a game with the Sixers, playing in all 834 and when he retired, Kerr owned the NBA record for consecutive games played (844) that was snapped during his final season with the Baltimore Bullets. He averaged 31.2 minutes per game in his Nationals/Sixers career.\n\n28. Clarence Weatherspoon\n\nSixers years: 1992-98\n\nWeatherspoon was drafted ninth in the first round by the Sixers in 1992, one week after the team dealt Charles Barkley to Phoenix. ... At 6-foot-7 and 240 pounds, a sturdy rebounder and inside scorer, his 5½ years with the club had its share of good seasons, including in 1993-94 when he averaged 18.4 points and 10.1 rebounds. ... He was traded to Golden State midway through the 1997-98 season, posting averages of 15.3 points and 8.3 rebounds in a Philadelphia uniform.\n\nWeatherspoon tried to live up to the “Baby Barkley” nickname that some people gave him but he didn’t get much help. The Sixers were a team in disarray during his time there, averaging just 23 wins in each of his five full seasons. He ended up playing for Golden State, Miami, Cleveland, the New York Knicks and Houston in a 13-year career.\n\n27. Steve Mix\n\nSixers years: 1973-82\n\nHe played nine seasons with the Sixers, is eighth in franchise history in games played (668) and averaged 11.3 points and 5.6 rebounds. ... During his first postseason with the team in 1976, Mix averaged 44.3 minutes in the Sixers’ best-of-three series loss to the Buffalo Braves. ... He earned his lone All-Star selection in 1975 with the Sixers when the 6-foot-7 forward averaged 15.6 points and 10.9 rebounds.\n\nMix joined the Sixers after the worst season in NBA history, (9-73 in 1972-73) and was a big part of their revival, playing in 81 playoff games. Later a popular broadcaster for the team, he was known as the “Mayor of Mixville” because he was so accurate hitting the 17- to 19-foot jumper and his two-point field goal percentage with the Sixers was 50.4.\n\n26. Tobias Harris\n\nSixers years: 2019-present\n\nHarris came to the Sixers as the headliner of a blockbuster multi-player trade with the Los Angeles Clippers on Feb. 6, 2019. ... He averaged 18.7 points, 6.9 rebounds and 3.3 assists in a little over three seasons with the Sixers. … His campaign came when he averaged 18.9 points while shooting 51.2% from the field, 39.4% on three-pointers and 89.2% from the foul line.\n\nHarris has been one of the more pivotal non-All-Star players to grace a Sixers uniform. His play was one of the reasons the Sixers captured the 2020-21 Eastern Conference regular-season title.\n\n25. Fred Carter\n\nSixers years: 1971-76\n\nNicknamed “Mad Dog”, Carter was a premier scorer, averaging 18.8 points during parts of six seasons with the Sixers, mostly on dreadful teams. ... He never met a shot he didn’t like, was strong driving to the basket and averaged 18.4 field goal attempts per game during his Sixers tenure. ... During three of his Sixers seasons, he was in the top 10 in the NBA in field goal attempts, playing on teams with limited offensive options.\n\nCarter, who was 32-76 in parts of two seasons as the Sixers head coach, will always be known as the MVP of the worst team in NBA history, the 9-73 Sixers of 1972-73, but that shouldn’t be his legacy with the team. He only played three playoff games for the Sixers (in his last year) but went out firing, averaging 28.0 points in a best-of-three series loss to the Buffalo Braves.\n\n24. World B. Free\n\nSixers years: 1975-78, 1986-87\n\nThe flamboyant guard with the Rainbow Jumper, whose first name was Lloyd when the 76ers drafted him in 1975, could light up a crowd and a score sheet. ... Though primarily a sub in his initial Philadelphia stay, he still managed to score — with considerable flair — 16 points per game in his second and third seasons here. ... His scoring prowess exploded after his trade to San Diego in 1978 — 28.8 and 30.2 in his first two seasons there — and he never averaged fewer than 22 points between 1980 and 1986.\n\nWhile a prolific offensive force who loved to break down a defender one-on-one, Free’s real legacy might be in the showmanship he brought to what had been a staid league. His free-spirited style led to a bevy of nicknames, from the self-applied “All-World” to the “Prince of Mid-Air.”\n\n23. Eric Snow\n\nSixers years: 1998-2004\n\nA pass-first point guard, Snow was a defensive presence and offensive quarterback of the 2000-01 NBA Finals team, feeding Allen Iverson and covering up on defense. ... While Snow missed time during his six-year Sixers career, he also played all 82 games in three of those seasons. Snow averaged 9.7 points and 6.6 assists during his Sixers career, but his leadership on and off the court is where he made his greatest impression.\n\nSnow’s courage, playing in the 2001 NBA playoffs despite re-injuring an ankle that forced him to miss 32 regular season games, endeared him to Philadelphia fans who appreciated his grit. He played in all 23 playoff games that season, averaging 9.3 points, 4.5 assists and 1.2 steals.\n\n22. Theo Ratliff\n\nSixers years: 1997-2001, 2008-09\n\nRatliff was an undersized center known for his defense and was a key member of the Sixers’ 2000-01 NBA Finals team, but he didn’t get to the finish line that season. ... Suffering a season-ending wrist injury in February and then getting dealt to Atlanta in the Dikembe Mutombo trade. He earned his only All-Star berth in 2000-01 when he had a career-high 3.7 blocked shots. In parts of five seasons during two stints with the Sixers he averaged 10.0 points and 6.9 rebounds.\n\nRatliff will always be remembered for his lunch-pail mentality and more than holding his own against bigger centers. He is second all-time in Sixers history with 2.9 blocked shots per game, although blocked shots wasn’t an official stat when Wilt Chamberlain played for the Sixers.\n\n21. Wali Jones\n\nSixers years: 1965-71, 1976\n\nA star at Overbrook High and Villanova, the colorful Jones was a starter and key contributor on the Sixers’ 1966-67 champions. ... He averaged 13.2 points a game as the team’s point guard and his burst of jumpers in the series-clinching Game 5 of that year’s Eastern finals caused Convention Hall to erupt. As a first-year player with Baltimore in 1965, he was named to the league’s all-rookie team.\n\nJones is best remembered for his jump-shooting style. Rising from the ground he’d extend one leg in the air, a move that not only delighted crowds but allowed him more space to shoot.\n\n20. Hersey Hawkins\n\nSixers years: 1988-93\n\nHawkins garnered first-team All-Rookie honors in 1988 after averaging 15.1 points. … By his third season, his scoring average was up to 22.1 points, leading to his lone NBA All-Star Game appearance. … An elite defender, Hawkins had nine steals against the Boston Celtics on Jan. 25, 1991. He also scored 38 points on 11-for-19 shooting during the game.\n\nDuring his Sixers’ tenure, Hawkins was the second-leading scorer behind Charles Barkley.... Before being traded to the Charlotte Hornets on Sept. 3, 1993, he set the Sixers record for three-pointers made and attempted in a season during the 1992-93 campaign.\n\n19. Dikembe Mutombo\n\nSixers years: 2001-02\n\nA member of the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame, Mutombo had just a year-and-a-half tenure with the Sixers. ... After being acquired in February 2001, he played on the Sixers team that advanced to the NBA Finals that year, losing to the Los Angeles Lakers in five games. ... Mutombo was NBA Defensive Player of the Year that season and then averaged 13.9 points, 13.7 rebounds and 3.1 blocked shots in 23 playoff games. ... In his one full season with the Sixers (2001-02), Mutombo was an All-Star selection and 11.5 points, 10.8 rebounds and 2.4 blocked shots.\n\nAgainst the Lakers in the championship series, Mutombo averaged 16.8 points, 12.2 rebounds and 2.2 blocked shots, good numbers for sure, but overshadowed by Shaquille O’Neal (33.0 ppg., 15.8 rpg. 3.4 bpg.). Mutombo didn’t stay in Philadelphia long enough to have a lasting legacy, but his best moment came in the Sixers’ seven-game Eastern Conference final series win over Milwaukee when he averaged 16.6 points, 15.6 rebounds and 2.7 blocked shots.\n\n18. Darryl Dawkins\n\nSixers years: 1975-82\n\nIn 1975, became the first NBA player drafted straight out of high school (No. 5 overall), prompting Sports Illustrated to call him the league’s first “man child”. Became a breakout player down the stretch of his second season, earning key minutes during their the Sixers’ run to the NBA Finals. Spent his first seven NBA seasons with the Sixers, including a 1978-79 season when he averaged 14.7 points and a career-high 8.7 rebounds per game.\n\nNicknamed “Chocolate Thunder” by Stevie Wonder, Dawkins was one of the most popular Sixers of all-time because of his on-court power and infectious sense of humor. His thunderous dunks famously resulted in him shattering two backboards. The big man averaged 11.2 points on 55.5% shooting and 6.7 rebounds and 1.4 blocks per game as a Sixer and was part of three NBA Finals teams, in 1977, 1980 and 1982. He was then part of the three-way trade that brought Moses Malone to Philly, fueling the Sixers’ run to the 1983 championship.\n\n17. Ben Simmons\n\nSixers years: 2016-21\n\nSimmons was the No. 1 pick in the 2016 NBA draft. ... After missing the 2016-17 season with a broken foot, Simmons was the runaway winner for the 2018 Rookie of the Year award. ... The 6-foot-10 point guard was a three-time All-Star, a two-time All-Defensive selection, the 2020 steals leader and All-NBA pick. Simmons also has 32 career triple-doubles.\n\nSimmons was a matchup nightmare for opposing guards because of his height, strength and speed. Before forcing a trade to the Brooklyn Nets, he and Joel Embiid were arguably the league’s best young tandem.\n\n16. Doug Collins\n\nSixers years: 1973-81\n\nThe first overall pick in the 1973 NBA draft, the effervescent Collins at 6-foot-6 was one of the earliest big guards in the NBA. A four-time All-Star in Philadelphia, his best season came in 1975-76 when he averaged 20.8 points per game. A run of foot and knee injuries that began in 1979 limited his playing time and prematurely ended his career following the 1980-81 season.\n\nAs good a player as he was, and as much ballyhoo as surrounded the Olympic star’s drafting, Collins’ on-the-court career has been surpassed by his stints as Michael Jordan’s coach and an NBA broadcaster. He also coached the Pistons, Wizards, and, from 2010-2013, the Sixers.\n\n15. Andre Iguodala\n\nSixers years: 2004-12\n\nIguodala was selected ninth overall by the Sixers during the 2004 draft. ... He averaged 15.3 points, 4.9 rebounds, 1.7 steals in 613 games as a Sixer. ... Iguodala was an Eastern Conference All-Star during his final season with the Sixers.\n\nAn elite defender with unmatched athleticism, Iguodala was one of the most underrated Sixers during his tenure in Philadelphia. He received the first of two All-Defensive team selections during his time with the Sixers and was a member of the 2012 Olympic gold medal men’s basketball team.\n\n14. George McGinnis\n\nSixers years: 1975-78\n\nMcGinnis’ arrival here, after a protracted legal battle involving the 76ers, Pacers and Knicks, ignited a pro basketball renaissance in Philadelphia. ... A powerful force inside, he was an all-NBA first-teamer in his initial Philly season and averaged better than 20 points and 10 rebounds in all three Philadelphia years.\n\nMcGinnis, along with the newly acquired Julius Erving, was expected to get the 76ers a championship in 1976-77. But he flamed out in that season’s NBA Finals loss to Portland, was chided as being too soft and a year later was traded to Denver for Bobby Jones.\n\n13. Bobby Jones\n\nSixers years: 1978-86\n\nA Naismith Hall of Fame selection, Jones was a two-time All-Star in his eight seasons with the Sixers and the NBA’s Sixth Man of the Year on the 1983 NBA championship team. ... Jones was a first-team All-NBA Defensive Team selection six times in his career with the Sixers and a second-team selection in another season. ... Always known as a fundamental player who didn’t take bad shots, he is fifth on the Sixers’ career list in field-goal percentage (.542).\n\nSeemingly the opposite of the player he was acquired for (George McGinnis), Jones was known for his selfless manner, agreeing to go from an All-Star in 1982 to the sixth man after the Sixers acquired Moses Malone before the 1982-83 championship season. He’ll go down as one of the top defensive players in team history.\n\n12. Chet Walker\n\nSixers years: 1962-69\n\nThe silky Walker, a break-down specialist, was a seven-time NBA All-Star, earning that honor three times in his six Philadelphia seasons. ... Despite playing alongside the greatest scorer and rebounder in NBA history for 3 ½ seasons here, he averaged 16.2 points and 7.9 rebounds as a member of the Sixers and Syracuse Nationals. ... Famously adept at drawing fouls, he was consistently among the league’s best free-throw shooters, finishing in the top four in percentage four times.\n\nNicknamed “Chet the Jet” for his ability to burst to the basket, the agile, 6-6 Walker was the prototype for the modern small forward. In 2012, he became the fourth member of the champion 1966-67 Sixers inducted into the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame.\n\n11. Andrew Toney\n\nSixers years: 1980-88\n\nKnown as “The Boston Strangler” for his many epic games against the Celtics, Toney was headed to a potential Hall of Fame career until he suffered foot injuries that forced him to retire at the age of 30. ... Toney was a two-time All-Star with the Sixers, including in their 1982-83 championship season when he averaged 19.7 points and 4.5 assists in the regular season and 18.8 points and 4.6 assists in the playoffs.\n\nToney, who averaged 17.4 points in 72 playoff games for the Sixers, will have the reputation as being a fearless performer, always relishing to take the big shot. “He is definitely one of the toughest guys we ever played against,” Celtics Hall of Famer Larry Bird told The Inquirer in a 2013 interview. “We really didn’t have anybody to stop him, and it seemed like he scored at will.”\n\n10. Dolph Schayes\n\nSixers years: 1949-64\n\nA 12-time NBA All-Star in Syracuse and at the time the franchise’s all-time scorer and rebounder, the hook-shooting Schayes was 35 when the Nationals moved here in 1963. ... The 76ers’ first coach, he used himself sparingly in his lone Philadelphia season before retiring to the bench. ... Schayes led Philadelphia to the regular season East title in 1966 and was named Coach of the Year, but was fired after his team lost to Boston in the conference finals.\n\nThough barely 6-foot-8, the tenacious Schayes was one of the young leagues’ dominant big men as a member of the Nationals, averaging 18.5 points and 12.1 rebounds in 15 NBA seasons. Named to the NBA’s 75th Anniversary Team, he was also elected to the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame in 1973.\n\n9. Billy Cunningham\n\nSixers years: 1965-72, 1974-76\n\nA three-time All-NBA first-teamer, the Brooklyn-born leaper, nicknamed the Kangaroo Kid, averaged 18.5 points as the sixth man on the champion 1966-67 Sixers. ... After Wilt Chamberlain was traded in 1968, he became the team’s dominant player, averaging 24.8 points and 12.8 rebounds in 1968-69. ... His nine seasons in a 76ers uniform were interrupted by a two-year stint with the ABA’s Carolina Cougars.\n\nThough a perennial All-Star who played with a head-first intensity, Cunningham is probably best remembered now as the coach of the 1982-83 NBA champion Sixers. A Naismith Basketball Hall of Famer, Cunningham was selected to both the NBA’s 50th and 75th Anniversary teams.\n\n8. Joel Embiid\n\nSixers years: 2014-present\n\nEmbiid was the third overall pick out of Kansas in 2014. ... After missing his first two seasons with foot surgeries, Embiid was voted an All-Star starter for five consecutive seasons. ... This season, he became the first center to win a scoring title since Hall of Famer Shaquille O’Neal since 2000.\n\nEmbiid is the Sixers’ most dominant center since Hall of Famer Moses Malone. However, he’s putting up numbers that the franchise hasn’t seen since Hall of Famer Wilt Chamberlain.\n\n7. Maurice Cheeks\n\nSixers years: 1978-89\n\nThe franchise leader in assists (6,212) and steals (1,942), while averaging 12.2 points, 7.3 assists, 3.0 rebounds, 2.3 steals over 11 seasons. ... Made four All-Star teams as a Sixer, in 1982-83 and from 1985-88. ... Tied the NBA record for steals in a Finals game (Game 6 in 1980), which held up until Robert Horry recorded 7 in 1995.\n\nDuring the Sixers era anchored by Julius Erving and Moses Malone, Cheeks was the quintessential point guard who distributed and harassed opposing ballhandlers. The Hall of Famer made four All-Defensive first teams and was a critical part of the 1983 NBA championship squad. During that run to the title, Cheeks averaged 16.3 points, 7 assists and 2 steals per game in the playoffs, including totaling 20 points and 7 assists against the Los Angeles Lakers in the decisive Game 4 of the NBA Finals. After his playing career, Cheeks was the Sixers’ head coach from 2005-09 and an assistant from 1994-2001. His No. 10 is retired by the Sixers.\n\n6. Hal Greer\n\nSixers years: 1958-73\n\nOvershadowed by contemporaries Oscar Robertson and Jerry West, the jump-shooting specialist was named to the All-NBA second team an astounding seven times. ... Between 1960 and 1970, Greer never averaged below 19 points per game, topping out at 24.1 for the Sixers in 1967-68. ... Oddly, in the Sixers’ 1966-67 championship season, it was Greer and not Wilt Chamberlain who led them in scoring (27.7) throughout their 15 playoff games.\n\nGreer was so adept a jump-shooter that he was one of the few in league history to utilize that shot on his free throws. He was named to the NBA’s 50th and 75th Anniversary teams and inducted into the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame.\n\n5. Charles Barkley\n\nSixers years: 1984-92\n\nMade three All-NBA first teams and three All-NBA second teams while a Sixer, and averaged 23.3 points, 11.6 rebounds and 3.7 assists in 610 games over eight seasons with the franchise. ... Led the NBA in rebounding (14.6 per game) in 1986-87, a season he also averaged 23.0 points per game on 59.4% shooting and 4.9 assists per game to make his first All-Star Game. He was the 1991 All-Star Game MVP after totaling 17 points and 22 rebounds.\n\nThough at 6-foot-5 he didn’t have the overall size of his frontcourt counterparts, Barkley was one of his generation’s most imposing players. After demanding a trade following the 1991-92 season, Barkley was dealt to the Phoenix Suns, where in his first season he won NBA MVP and led his team to the 1993 NBA Finals. The Hall of Famer was named one of the 50 greatest players in NBA history in 1996 and was honored as a member of the league’s 75th anniversary team at this season’s All-Star Weekend. His No. 34 is retired by the Sixers.\n\n4. Allen Iverson\n\nSixers years: 1996-2006, 2009-10\n\nIverson was inducted into the Hall of Fame in 2016. ... He’s a member of the NBA 75th Anniversary Team. ... The seven-time All-NBA selection is a four-time scoring champion and three-time steals champion.\n\nIverson will go down as one of the greatest small guards in NBA history and a global icon. He led the Sixers to their last NBA championship appearance in 2001 and will be remembered in Philly for his fierce competitive spirit.\n\n3. Moses Malone\n\nSixers years: 1982-86, 1993-94\n\nMalone was inducted into the Hall of Fame in 2001. ... He led the Sixers to the NBA title in 1983, winning both the league and Finals MVP. ... He is a member of the NBA 50th and 75th anniversary teams.\n\nMalone will also be remembered for his famed “Fo’ Fo’ Fo’” playoff prediction in regards to the Sixers sweeping the 1983 playoffs. Despite being a six-time rebounding champion, and three-time MVP, Malone is seen as one of the most underrated players in NBA history.\n\n2. Julius Erving\n\nSixers years: 1976-87\n\nErving was inducted into the Hall of Fame in 1993. ... He averaged 22.0 points, 1.8 steals and 1.5 blocks during 11 seasons with the Sixers. ... Erving is a member of the NBA’s 35th, 50th and 75th anniversary teams.\n\nBefore Michael Jordan graced the NBA as a Chicago Bull, Erving was recognized as the league’s elite dunker. He’s one of the greatest small forwards to ever play the game and will always be beloved in Philly for being a member of the 1983 NBA championship team.\n\n1. Wilt Chamberlain\n\nSixers years: 1964-68\n\nThe most eye-popping of the 72 NBA records he still holds were set as a Warrior, but Chamberlain was no less dominant in his 3½-year stint as a member of the 76ers. In 1966-67, he led the Sixers to a championship and led the league in scoring, rebounding, shooting percentage and minutes played. Named NBA MVP in all three of his complete Sixers seasons, Chamberlain in 1968 became the first player to record a double triple-double, collecting 22 points, 25 rebounds and 21 assists in a win over Detroit.\n\nAn icon considered one of the best to ever play, Chamberlain’s return to Philadelphia just two-plus seasons after the Warriors moved to San Francisco resulted in what arguably was the franchise’s greatest season. And in 1966-67, Chamberlain finally filled the only hole in his astounding resume as his 68-win Sixers won an NBA title."
