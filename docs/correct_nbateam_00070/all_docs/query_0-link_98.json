        "text": "Jason Miller/Getty Images\n\nThe Philadelphia 76ers are reportedly pursuing a trade for Cleveland Cavaliers sharpshooter Kyle Korver.\n\nAccording to the Philadelphia Inquirer's Keith Pompey, the Sixers \"have had discussions\" with the Cavaliers about a trade centered around Korver and shooting guard Jerryd Bayless.\n\nCiting a source briefed on the talks, the New York Times' Marc Stein reported a deal involving those two is \"possible\" but \"far from certain.\"\n\nBayless, who is due $8.6 million next season, has been considered a prime buyout candidate since falling out of the Sixers rotation last season.\n\nGiven Bayless' declining value, it stands to reason the Sixers would have to add sweetener in the form of a young prospect or draft picks to complete a deal for a shooter of Korver's caliber.\n\nLast season, the 37-year-old averaged 9.2 points per game and shot 43.6 percent from distance for a Cavaliers team that won a fourth straight Eastern Conference title."
