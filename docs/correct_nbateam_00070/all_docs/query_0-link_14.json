        "text": "Kyle Korver was waived by the Suns on Monday.\n\nThat means the 38-year-old veteran shooter is an unrestricted free agent, now capable of choosing where he plays in 2019. How about your town, your team, your 76ers, who have two open roster spots and could use some scoring off the bench?\n\nKorver was linked to the Sixers by Adrian Wojnarowski, who said this last week:\n\nKorver on a veteran minimum would make a lot of sense here. He’s a Southern California native, so the Lakers might be appealing, but if he wants a ring before retiring I think he’s probably got a better chance of doing that with the Sixers coming through the lesser of the two conferences.\n\nHe did, of course, begin his career in Philadelphia, selected by the Nets in the second round of the 2003 draft and then sent to the Sixers for cash considerations. Korver played four and a half seasons here before being traded to Utah for Gordan Giriček, who appeared in 12 games before he was waived.\n\nLast season, he played 70 combined games for Cleveland and Utah, shooting 39.7% from three on five attempts per game. That was down from his career average of 42.9%, though his numbers were very good with the Cavs and slipped after he was traded. Maybe getting a full offseason to reset and recalibrate will see him pull back to that 40-42% range.\n\nBeyond those early years in Philly, there’s also a connection to numerous guys currently affiliated with the Sixers. Korver played alongside Elton Brand and Mike Scott during his time with the Hawks, which spanned about five years:\n\nhttps://twitter.com/Jolly66576243/status/1146567013801844738\n\nKyle Korver – yay or nay?\n\nHere’s the bench as currently constructed:\n\nRaul Neto\n\nShake Milton\n\nZhaire Smith\n\nMatisse Thybulle\n\nMike Scott\n\nJames Ennis\n\nJonah Bolden\n\nKyle O’Quinn\n\nMarial Shayok (two-way)\n\nNorvel Pelle (two-way)\n\nThe Sixers could use some shooting off the pine and you can certainly do worse than bringing Kyle Korver back on a veteran minimum deal, assuming he wants to come back. Keep that 15th roster spot open for flexibility, and the offseason is pretty much complete."
