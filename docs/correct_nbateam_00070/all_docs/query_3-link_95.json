        "text": "PHILADELPHIA — Tony Bennett left his heart in a certain left-coast locale where the sourdough is super, the demographics are diverse and the views are beyond belief.\n\nPhiladelphia is Kyle Korver's San Francisco.\n\nIt's where a kid raised in Iowa came to embrace not only the cheesesteak — plain, no onions — but also the fabric of a blue-collar Eastern seaboard city that hugged him right back.\n\nNo wonder Korver seemed so emotional Monday, when he worked out here with the Jazz one day before his first game in Philly since being traded by the 76ers to Utah late last December.\n\n\"I feel like this is kind of where I found myself ... as a man,\" said Korver, who spent the first 4 1/2 years of his NBA career with the Sixers. \"I have a lot of really close friends here.\n\n\"I hated it at first, and everyone here knows that,\" he added while sitting on a table at his old practice facility, the gym at Philadelphia College of Osteopathic Medicine, and fighting the cracks in his voice. \"I've said it before. I did not like Philadelphia at all at first. It took me a year or two to kind of get used to it. But I really got to know the city a lot, the people in it, the heart here. And, you know, I love it now.\"\n\nKorver spent most of this past summer here, even after being dealt to the Jazz.\n\nHe still has a home here.\n\nHe slept in his own bed here Sunday night, after the Jazz's loss in New York that kicked off a five-game trip, and ate his favorite food here Monday.\n\n\"Part of my heart,\" he said, \"is here, for sure.\"\n\nA portion of those belonging to some with the 76ers was torn, too, when the franchise severed ties with Korver — enabling them to create enough team payroll salary cap space to sign longtime Los Angeles Clippers big man Elton Brand last offseason.\n\n\"It was just tough,\" Sixers coach Maurice Cheeks said Monday. \"But, you know, sometimes hard decisions have to be made — and that was certainly one of the hardest.\"\n\nBasketball was one reason.\n\n\"No. 1,\" Cheeks said, \"he's one of the best shooters in the NBA.\"\n\nBut the pain of parting cuts much deeper.\n\n\"Second to that, the type of person he is. There's not a whole lot of character that's better than that,\" Cheeks said. \"All the guys around him, all of us, just benefitted so much by his presence — just the type of guy that he was.\n\n\"We all valued his play,\" he added, \"and we all valued him as a person.\"\n\nKorver performed extensive charity work for underprivileged children while in Philadelphia, and tonight — with the help of the shoe company Converse — about 200 kids will be on hand at Wachovia Center to watch the Jazz and 76ers.\n\nHe also established an annual coat drive in Philly, one he has continued in Salt Lake City — and that resulted in more than 800 pieces of brand-new outerwear recently being collected for two Utah-based charitable organizations.\n\nKorver's new coach, though, treasures him most for what he's done on the court.\n\nEven though he brings Korver off the bench behind Ronnie Brewer at shooting guard, and even though a wrist sprain this season has adversely impacted Korver's aim from both the field and the free-throw line, Jerry Sloan values the sharpshooter's mere presence.\n\n\"He's certainly made a difference,\" said Sloan, whose now 5-1 club is 43-17 in regular-season games since Korver played his first in Utah last New Year's Eve.\n\n\"Our big guys — it gives them more space to work and have opportunities to do their job,\" he added, \"because he does spread the floor out.\"\n\nWhen the trade was first made, Korver was about as apprehensive coming to Utah as he was transitioning to Philly from Pella, Iowa, and Nebraska's Creighton University.\n\nTo this day, he finds the Salt Lake vs. Philadelphia experience about as disparate as it gets.\n\n\"There's nothing that's similar,\" Korver said.\n\n\"The style of basketball to be played, the city itself. ... I'm not saying one is better than the other. They're just very, very different.\"\n\nThough he says he's happy in Utah, Korver — who still checks 76ers box scores every night they play — clearly misses his first NBA home.\n\n\"I've got a lot of guys on the team I'm friends with. The coaching staff here I love to death,\" he said. \"Just even people that work within the Sixers organization — I still talk to them a lot. There's a lot of great people here, so it makes things a little weird, I guess.\n\n\"I was pumped about the (Philadelphia) Phillies (winning the World Series last month),\" Korver added. \"Selfishly, I think, I was kind of wanting (the 76ers) to be the team that brought that championship here. I have a lot of friends who were starving for a long time and talk about it all the time.\"\n\nBut Korver has moved on now — \"It's business. I get it,\" he said — and so have the 2-4 Sixers.\n\n\"It's gonna take a little bit of time to kind of find themselves,\" Korver said. \"But they'll do it. Coach Cheeks' style — he'll get them going eventually.\"\n\nCheeks, too, sees the change as something that benefits all involved.\n\n\"No question,\" he said.\n\n\"He (Korver) ended up in a good situation playing for Utah and playing for the one of the best coaches (Sloan) in the NBA, and we end up getting cap space for that.\"\n\nAnd it doesn't get much more heartening than that."
