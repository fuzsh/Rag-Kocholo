        "text": "Update: The Hawks have posted a starting lineup of Jeff Teague, Kyle Korver (!), DeMarre Carroll, Paul Millsap, and Pero Antic. Korver returns for the first time in 7 games.\n\n----\n\nWith the Atlanta Hawks on a dismal, 6-game losing skid, any influx of optimism is a plus, and the team got a much-needed infusion when head coach Mike Budenholzer announced that DeMarre Carroll is set to return to the lineup against the Philadelphia 76ers on Monday night, barring any unforeseen circumstances during warm-ups. In addition, Kyle Korver is considered a game-time decision, but indications are that he will play if nothing goes awry in warm-ups will play after being announced as a starter alongside Carroll on the wing.\n\nIn short, the Hawks have been a much different (read: worse) team without Korver and Carroll in the lineup, and the win-loss record bares that out. Atlanta is just 1-9 without Korver this season (including the past 6 defeats) and without Carroll on the floor, things aren't much better with an ugly, 1-7 mark. They represent the top two wing options on the roster, and is certainly not a coincidence that the Hawks have struggled without them, especially on the defensive end with Carroll and with floor spacing in the case of Korver."
