        "text": "The Atlanta Hawks will be without three starters Saturday night when they face the Philadelphia 76ers. Mike Budenholzer will rest Kyle Kover, Paul Millsap and DeMarre Carroll according to the Atlanta Journal-Constitution's Chris Vivlamore.\n\nWith a big lead in the Eastern Conference, Mike Budenholzer can afford to rest some of his key players. He held out Carroll, Jeff Teague and Al Horford in last Saturday's game against Miami. Korver has been mired in a shooting slump of late but did knock down a pair of big threes in Friday's win over Cleveland. He did not even make the trip to Philadelphia according to Vivlamore.\n\nWith several of the starters out, expect to see more of John Jenkins and Mike Muscala who are likely to be in the rotation. Also the newly signed Jarell Eddie could see his first action since joining the team.\n\nUpdate\n\nJohn Jenkins, Kent Bazemore and Mike Muscala will move into the starting lineup for the Hawks."
