        "text": "We did the Eagles All-Underrated roster yesterday, and Andrew put together the Phillies Underrated team earlier in the year. So why not do the same thing for the Sixers?\n\nBuilding an All-Time roster of great Sixers would be easy. While they may not have won since 1983, there are so many truly great players in franchise history. They have 19 guys in the Hall of Fame. Allen Iverson, Dr, J, Maurice Cheeks. However, there would be significant debate about who belongs at center with players like Wilt Chamberlian, Mose Malone, and Joel Embiid all available. What is a bit harder is picking the guys who aren’t on the All-Time great level, but are still deserving of some love from Sixers fans.\n\nThese guys may not be Hall of Famers. But they were still damn good players. Several of them kept the Sixers afloat during some dark times. Others got overshadowed by playing with better players. Some maybe got a hard time while they were here because they couldn’t live up to high expectations. But maybe now we can appreciate them more after the fact.\n\nWhat Center goes under the radar? Which Point Guard deserves more love from the fans? Are there any Small Forwards that we underappreciate? And what bench player is the most underrated? I picked who I think is the most underrated Sixers player at every position and off the bench.\n\nHere is the All-Underrated Roster For The Sixers:"
