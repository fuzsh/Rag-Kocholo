        "text": "The 76ers likely aren’t done looking for players. While general manager Elton Brand wasn’t about to reveal his strategy about any moves, a team source said that the Sixers are considering signing a shooter.\n\nThat is not surprising since the Sixers lost JJ Redick, who signed as a free agent with the New Orleans Pelicans. Redick is a career 41.3 percent three-point shooter. In his two seasons with the Sixers, he shot 40.7 percent from beyond the arc.\n\nThe Sixers have 13 players under contract and can sign two more players.\n\nFormer Sixer Kyle Korver is at the top of the list for available shooters. He is reportedly considering the Sixers, Milwaukee, and the Los Angeles Lakers.\n\nKorver, 38, became a free agent when he was waived by Phoenix on Wednesday. He is a career 42.3 percent three-point shooter. If Korver went to the Sixers or any other team, he likely would be a valuable contributor off the bench."
