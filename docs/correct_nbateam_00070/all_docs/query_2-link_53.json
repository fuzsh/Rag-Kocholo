        "text": "With just two roster spots remaining and the list of free agents dwindling, finding a meaningful signing was not an easy task for Bucks general manager Jon Horst.\n\nBut he may have pulled it off over the weekend.\n\nOn Saturday morning, ESPN’s Adrian Wojnarowski reported Kyle Korver agreed to a one-year deal with the Bucks. The Athletic Wisconsin later confirmed the report.\n\nAfter previous stops with the 76ers, Jazz, Bulls, Hawks and Cavaliers, the Bucks are the 38-year-old Korver’s sixth team. Coming to Milwaukee also means a reunion for Korver and Bucks head coach Mike Budenholzer, who coached him for three and a half seasons in Atlanta and helped Korver achieve his lone All-Star appearance in 2015.\n\nLast year in his 16th NBA season, Korver appeared in 70 games with 16 in Cleveland before getting traded to Utah. In 54 games with the Jazz, he averaged 9.1 points, 2.5 rebounds and 1.2 assists in 20.1 minutes per game. He also shot 38.4 percent from the 3-point line, while taking 5.4 threes per game.\n\nWith other options at shooting guard and quality players up and down the roster, it’s tough to know exactly what Korver’s role will be.\n\nCan Korver still play?\n\nWith a few lingering injuries keeping him on the sideline for the final two weeks of the regular season and some struggles during the playoffs against the Rockets, how much does Korver have left entering his 17th season? A simpler version of the question is, “Can Korver still shoot?”\n\nAnd the answer to that is a resounding yes.\n\nWith the Cavaliers and Jazz last season, Korver shot just 39.7 percent from 3-point range, his worst shooting percentage in a decade. That percentage would have made him the second-best 3-point shooter behind only Malcolm Brogdon (42.6 percent) on his last year’s team.\n\nFor his career, Korver has hit 42.9 percent of his 3-point shot attempts, the ninth-highest career percentage in NBA history. Last season, the Bucks let it fly from beyond the arc more than any team outside of the Rockets, but only hit 35.3 percent of those shots. Adding Korver gives them an elite shooter, something they didn’t have last season. They had some high-volume and good shooters, but not an elite shooter like Korver.\n\nLast season, Korver’s 39.7 3-point shooting percentage ranked 28th among players who attempted at least 200 shots. He hit 40.3 percent of his catch-and-shoot 3-point attempts, good for 22nd among players that took at least 200 of those. He was the league’s third-most accurate pull-up 3-point shooter, behind only Kevin Love and Troy Daniels. Overall, Korver is still a great shooter, and even when he struggled he would’ve helped the Bucks.\n\nFew players get covered more closely at the 3-point line than Korver due to his accuracy and quick release. The Bucks didn’t have a player like that last season. Despite being one of the league’s most accurate 3-point shooters, Brogdon’s slow release meant many teams could give him space and then trust themselves to recover and run him off the 3-point line. That is not the case with Korver.\n\nHe gets his shot off quickly and willingly. Last season, Korver took 9.8 threes per 36 minutes. Brogdon took just 4.8 threes per 36 minutes. Even the Bucks’ 3-point gunner Brook Lopez took 7.9 per 36 minutes. Korver doesn’t just make 3-point shots, he attempts a bunch too, making him even more of a threat to opposing defenses.\n\nHe will be the best shooter Giannis Antetokounmpo has ever played with. Even if Korver is only on the floor to give Antetokounmpo more space offensively, it could be a huge win for the Bucks.\n\nDefenses will be forced to make an incredibly tough decision with Korver and Antetokounmpo on the floor. Deny Korver the basketball and give Antetokounmpo a lane or leave Korver and give up a three to one of the NBA’s best shooters of all time? It will be a dilemma for any defense playing against the Bucks next season.\n\nHow will Korver fit into the rotation?\n\nIt seems unlikely Korver will start at shooting guard for the Bucks. After playing over 30 minutes a night for Budenholzer’s Hawks, Korver has seen his minutes per game steadily decline during the last three seasons. At this point, he may only be capable of 15 to 20 minutes a night, but that may not necessarily be a bad thing.\n\nLast year, Budenholzer ended up using every player on his roster. Pat Connaughton was outside of the rotation at the start of the season and again in January, but he played a huge role in the Bucks series against the Celtics. Sterling Brown missed a month of the season with a wrist injury before returning at the end of the season and starting the entire first round of the playoffs against the Pistons.\n\nBudenholzer is not afraid of plugging in different players to give others adequate time to recover from an injury or give a different player an opportunity. He keeps the minutes of his starters low, even those of Antetokounmpo, which gives players coming off the bench even more opportunities.\n\nKorver will likely play a part in the shooting guard rotation with Wesley Matthews Jr., Brown, Connaughton and second-year player Donte DiVincenzo. Will there be times they are out of the rotation? Probably. Will there be times where they start? Possibly. Budenholzer will use each of them when he sees fit, but if The Athletic Wisconsin’s conversation with Horst is any indication, Matthews is the player most likely to start at shooting guard this season.\n\nCan Korver survive on defense?\n\nFor his career, offenses have been better with Korver on the floor. His reputation on that side of the floor is largely unquestioned. On the other end though, many wonder just how good he is defensively and whether or not he can stay on the floor during the playoffs.\n\nJazz coach Quin Snyder kept Korver off the floor for large portions of their first-round series against the Rockets. With their isolation-heavy attack, the Rockets did everything they could to get Korver switched on to James Harden or Chris Paul and then attack him one-on-one. The Rockets’ offensive plan kept Korver on the bench for the entirety of Game 5 and all but four minutes of Games 2 and 4.\n\nIt must be noted that player-specific offensive plans are largely only used in the postseason. Teams don’t prep to take advantage of a single defender like Korver on a Tuesday night in February, so the likelihood of him being unplayable during the regular season is incredibly low.\n\nThe postseason will be a question mark for Korver defensively, but it is worth noting that the Bucks defense plan doesn’t count on defenders to contain their man one-on-one. Everything the Bucks do defensively is meant to funnel players toward a specific area (the midrange) and specific players (Lopez and Antetokounmpo), as well as give up the lowest percentage 3-point attempts from above-the-break.\n\nOffenses will almost certainly do what they can to attack Korver in the playoffs next season, but the Bucks’ scheme should largely be capable of protecting him and limiting the instances where his weaknesses can be fully exploited.\n\n(Top photo of Kyle Korver: Jeff Swinger / USA Today Sports)"
