        "text": "ATLANTA – Kyle Korver and Paul Millsap each scored 17 points and Atlanta beat the Philadelphia 76ers 95-79 on Wednesday night, giving the Hawks their longest winning streak in 17 years.\n\nKorver sank five 3-pointers as Atlanta (15-6) won its eighth straight — the Hawks’ longest since an 11-0 start to the 1997-98 season.\n\nDeMarre Carroll had 14 points and 11 rebounds for Atlanta.\n\nThe Hawks averaged 104 points in their first seven wins of the streak, but they had to rely on defense against Philadelphia.\n\nAlexey Shved had 13 points to lead the 76ers (2-19), who have won two of four since their 0-17 start. Luc Mbah a Moute had 12 points, and K.J. McDaniels and Jerami Grant each had 10.\n\nStrong defense helped overcome a sluggish game for Atlanta’s offense. The Hawks never trailed and led 47-38 at halftime and 68-58 entering the final period.\n\nA 3-pointer by Korver stretched the lead to 79-62. A basket by Mike Muscala, who had 12 points, pushed the lead over 20 points for the first time at 89-68.\n\nCoach Mike Budenholzer almost emptied his bench, using 12 players. Elton Brand was the only player in uniform who did not play.\n\nDennis Schroder had only five points but led Atlanta with four steals. Jeff Teague also had a low-scoring night, scoring only four points with his six assists.\n\nTIP-INS\n\n76ers: Tony Wroten, who leads the team with 17.9 points per game, missed his sixth straight game with a right knee sprain. There had been hope Wroten could return against the Hawks, but coach Brett Brown said Wroten plays “with a kamikaze mentality” and needs to be closer to 100 percent to play. “When that disposition is watered down, it’s just not as effective,” Brown said before the game.\n\nHawks: The team had no shooting practice on Wednesday. Budenholzer, perhaps anticipating the pace of the game, said he wanted to conserve his team’s energy to play defense. … F Mike Scott was held out with flu-like symptoms. … Korver had 11 points in the first half — the only scorer for ether team in double figures.\n\nUP NEXT\n\n76ers: At Brooklyn on Friday.\n\nHawks: Host Orlando on Friday."
