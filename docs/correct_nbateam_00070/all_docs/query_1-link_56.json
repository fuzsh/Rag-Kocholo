        "text": "One name that has been floating around for a while has been Kyle Korver. The 37-year-old, acquired by the Sixers on draft night 2003, is still productive at his age, shooting 45.7 percent from the floor and 38.7 percent from beyond the arc. According to Marc Stein of the New York Times, Philadelphia remains interested in the veteran.\n\nThe desperate-for-shooters Sixers remain highly interested in acquiring Cleveland's Kyle Korver. But that will be harder for Philadelphia to make happen without Jerryd Bayless' handy $8.6 million expiring contract to help facilitate a trade.\n\nKorver is in the second season of a three-year, $22 million deal he signed with the Cavaliers in 2017. The Sixers instead plugged Bayless into the Butler trade to help make that salary cap math work.\n\nOn Tuesday, during the Jimmy Butler press conference, general manager Elton Brand was asked about how the Sixers plan to fill their open roster spot. Although the team needs shooters, Brand said that they plan to take their time and \"evaluate the landscape\".\n\nWhile Korver might be a fit offensively, acquiring him outside of the buy-out market doesn't make a whole lot of sense for a Sixers team that wants to have maximum cap flexibility heading into the 2019 offseason. Korver is set to make $7.5 million next season, but only $3.44 million of that is guaranteed if he's waived before July 7, 2019. Still, it'd be hard to believe that Philadelphia would want nearly $3.5 million in dead cap heading into a big offseason, where the goal will be to re-sign Jimmy Butler and potentially add another big name to the mix.\n\nKorver is currently sidelined with a foot injury and missed the Cavs last game against Charlotte. Cleveland is having trouble doing much of anything this season, posting an early record of 2-11."
