        "text": "MADISON - If it weren't for a chance encounter in mid-July, it's possible Kyle Korver wouldn't be in Madison with the Milwaukee Bucks for training camp.\n\nLast spring, at the end of his 16th season, the veteran sharpshooter was beaten down. A midseason trade and multiple injuries had taken a toll on the 38-year-old and his family. He considered retirement before deciding it was not the way he wanted to go out, especially since he still loved the game and felt like he has something to offer.\n\nAfter bouncing from the Utah Jazz to the Memphis Grizzlies to the Phoenix Suns via trades in a span of just two days in early July, Korver found himself as a free agent with multiple suitors. With thoughts of retirement fading away, he had a difficult decision to make with teams like the Bucks, Philadelphia 76ers and Los Angeles Lakers all publicly in the mix.\n\nWhile mulling his options, he continued his off-season workout regimen at Peak Performance Project (better known as P3) in Santa Barbara, California.\n\n\"I was debating about where I was going to be going and I was really torn over what I was going to do,\" Korver recalled Tuesday after the Bucks' first practice at the University of Wisconsin's Nicholas Johnson Pavilion. \"I really was unsure. I was kind of leaning a different direction, but then I worked out at P3 one morning and as I’m walking out Giannis (Antetokounmpo) came walking in the door.\"\n\nThe two players weren't strangers. They had spoken on the phone less than a month before that encounter, but neither knew the other was going to be at P3 that day.\n\nSurprised to unexpectedly cross paths with the league's MVP, Korver invited Antetokounmpo to shoot with him later at the University of California, Santa Barbara. Antetokounmpo immediately accepted the offer before continuing inside for his workout session.\n\nAfter the two parted ways, the surprise wore off and Korver began to feel skeptical. When he got to his car, Korver decided to call his former coach and current Bucks head coach Mike Budenholzer to see if he had sent Antetokounmpo on a recruiting mission.\n\n\"I was like, ‘Did you set this up?’\" Korver said. \"And (Budenholzer) was like, ‘I thought he was in Europe!’ \"\n\nLater that day, Antetokounmpo and Korver met up at the UCSB Events Center to do shooting work. The 24-year-old MVP brought a notebook to jot down all the advice Korver had to offer. Afforded the opportunity to learn from one of the greatest shooters in league history, Antetokounmpo was hungry to absorb whatever he could.\n\nTo him, even in the midst of free agency, this had nothing to do with recruiting.\n\n“Oh, no, no no, no. I was in learning mode,\" Antetokounmpo said Tuesday when asked if he was at all in recruiting mode.\n\n\"I told him, I’m like, ‘Look, if you come to the team – I know you’re a free agent and you’re thinking about coming – but if you come to the team, great. At the end of the day if you don’t come, I’m going to be here for the next five days and no matter what I’m going to learn so much from you.’ So I was in learning mode. ... I still have my notes from Kyle.\"\n\nThough he wasn't actively recruiting, Antetokounmpo's actions in Santa Barbara were what put the Bucks over the edge in securing Korver's services. On July 20, just a few days after his first workout with Antetokounmpo, Korver and the Bucks agreed to a one-year veteran minimum deal.\n\nYes, reuniting with Budenholzer and joining a championship-caliber team were big draws for Korver, but it was getting to know Antetokounmpo over those few days in July that sealed the deal.\n\n\"You’re around him and you feel his greatness on the court,\" Korver said. \"He’s just such an imposing presence, dominant presence. But he’s hungry to learn, he’s hungry to work and it’s like, ‘That’s who I want to go to work with, guys like that.’ I want to be around guys who love the game and are doing this for the right reasons and play good team basketball. I really connected with that and saw something special in him.”\n\nKorver is no stranger to playing alongside a physically dominant, MVP-level player. He spent a season and a half in Cleveland with LeBron James and the Cavaliers from 2017-18, including a pair of trips to the NBA Finals.\n\nWith their size, strength and all-around skill sets, there have been plenty of comparisons made between James and Antetokounmpo. Korver sees some of those similarities but is even more excited about the overall fit he expects to find in Milwaukee.\n\n“It feels like when we were in Cleveland, you tried to create the right space for LeBron to be amazing,\" Korver said. \"This feels like a more organized Cleveland to me. We all have a role, but we’re trying to get our big guy, our big dog to eat. Right? Like he’s going to be in the paint and we’re creating space for him. It’s really exciting.\"\n\nAs training camp tipped off Tuesday, Korver was still feeling out his new teammates and situation. But during the portion of practice open to the media, Korver -- whose 2,351 three-pointers made rank fourth all-time, trailing only Ray Allen, Reggie Miller and Stephen Curry -- also spent some time giving shooting pointers to Thanasis Antetokounmpo.\n\nWith his deep well of knowledge and experience, Korver is most comfortable when he can help his teammates. It just feels right to him to take what he's experienced and pass in on.\n\nFor the Bucks, it's almost like having another assistant coach, though Budenholzer quickly threw water on that notion.\n\n“No, do not tell him that,\" Budenholzer said. \"He already gives me enough opinions already. We keep him strictly in player mode. ...\n\n“Any time Kyle talks to our players about shooting he’s somebody they’re going to listen to. His fundamentals are just so solid. It’s just great to see that where players are seeking him out and he’s happy to help any way he can.”\n\nKorver's contributions as a veteran leader both on and off the court are things the Bucks hope will pay dividends. Personally, Antetokounmpo looks forward to adding more to his notebook and building on the lessons he learned from Korver over the summer.\n\nThis time, though, when Korver and Antetokounmpo run into each other at the gym it won't be a surprise. It'll just be Bucks practice as usual, something that may not have come to fruition without that chance meeting at P3.\n\n\"When you’re making decisions sometimes you’re asking God to make signs in the clouds or something,\" Korver said. \"You’ve got no idea what you’re supposed to do then Giannis Antetokounmpo walks in the door. I’m like, if that’s not a sign I don’t know what is.\""
