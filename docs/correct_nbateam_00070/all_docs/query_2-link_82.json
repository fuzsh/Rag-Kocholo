        "text": "CLEVELAND: The full-throated defense of Cavaliers guard Matthew Dellavedova from accusations of being a dirty player continued Tuesday here, there and on the airwaves.\n\nWhen asked about the subject 90 minutes before game time, Cavs coach David Blatt said that Dellavedova “doesn’t have an unsportsmanlike bone in his body.”\n\nThat may have been needed as the news on Kyle Korver, the Hawks’ sharpshooter injured in Game 2 of the Eastern Conference finals, only worsened.\n\n“Kyle went to New York and got a second opinion, additional tests and additional information, and it has been determined he will need surgery. He will get surgery tomorrow afternoon,” Hawks coach Mike Budenholzer said prior to game time.\n\nDellavedova called that fact “unfortunate.”\n\nIt will likely only enhance the accusations coming from some quarters that the Australia native is a dirty player.\n\nWhen told of those harsh words, he said: “Good thing I’m not reading it.”\n\nThere are some who do not buy the characterization, however.\n\nBrett Brown, current Philadelphia 76ers coach and coach of the Australian national team, offered some insight into how basketball is taught and played Down Under during an appearance on Sirius XM Radio on Tuesday.\n\n“In Australia you’re taught body, body, ball,” Brown said. “Their body, your body, the ball. You’ve got to put your body between their body and the ball. The ball is sacred. He’s going after the ball with [Kyle] Korver, he’s boxing [Al] Horford out the other way, about 10-15 feet. Taj Gibson rolls and he’s trying to get into Taj’s legs after they switch out on the pick-and-roll. All those plays, him scissoring Taj’s legs, that’s a Bruce Bowen thing, you know?\n\n“But in regards of calling him dirty or trying to hurt people, it ain’t even close. It’s just a very unfair assessment and he’s just got to continue to do what he does.”\n\nEven TNT announcer and former Indiana Pacer Reggie Miller, who allegedly criticized Dellavedova during Sunday night’s broadcast, seemed to soften comments regarding Dellavedova on The Dan Patrick Show.\n\n“He’s not dirty, and I’ve said that on the air several times,” he said. “The word I like to use is irritant and there’s nothing wrong with that. I’ve played with a lot of Dellavedovas, irritants — guys that got underneath your skin, and that’s a good thing. I’ve played with and against. And you want players like that on your team.”\n\nA little empathy\n\nThroughout his career LeBron James has suffered more than a few tumbles on the court, but none as serious as the one Golden State Warriors point guard Steph Curry endured in Game 4 of the Western Conference finals on Monday night in Houston.\n\nCurry essentially went off the back of one Warrior after jumping and landed on his head, suffering what was termed a head contusion.\n\n“I thought it was pretty horrific,” James said after Tuesday’s shootaround.\n\nBut he considered Curry — who returned to the game to play in what eventually turned into a Warriors’ loss — lucky in not breaking his wrist.\n\n“His was different because he actually went up for a block,” James said. “I got low-bridged on a jump and tried to brace my fall with my hand and ended up breaking my wrist. So I know exactly what he was going through at that point in time.”\n\nBusiness as usual\n\nHeading into Game 4, the Cavs were in agreement about one aspect of Tuesday’s possible elimination game.\n\n“You want to approach each game the same. It’s going to be a higher level of intensity because [the Hawks] don’t want to go home,” Cavs guard Iman Shumpert said. “We understand that they need this game. But though you don’t want to shy away from the moment, as far as being a close-out game, the approach of playing Cavalier basketball is always going to stay the same.”\n\nJames said experience should be the guide for how the Cavs handle potential close-out games.\n\n“This is our third time to close a team out in this postseason so far. We try to use the experience we have in the last two series to go out and just play our game and see what happens,” he said.\n\nDid I say that?\n\nIn Atlanta they will think little of a statement Kent Bazemore made during the Hawks’ shootaround interview session Tuesday morning. In Cleveland, it’s bound to turn some heads, however.\n\n“We’re the Dog Pound around here now. We all have to show the fight that DeMarre [Carroll] does. We take our lead from him,” Bazemore said.\n\nOf course, the Dawg Pound is the name for the most rabid of Browns fans who occupy the east end zone at FirstEnergy Stadium.\n\nCleveland fans can relax, though­ — he made the reference to Carroll because his nickname is the Junkyard Dog.\n\nIt does a body good\n\nDuring the course of post-game interviews, several Cavs mentioned that they cramped up during the course of Sunday’s marathon Game 3. James even seemed to collapse to the floor in exhaustion and in relief after the Hawks’ chance to tie the game on a last-second 3-pointer bounced off the rim.\n\nShumpert was one of those who confessed to cramping, but he said he and his teammates took precautions prior to Game 4.\n\n“Carry a gallon jug of water around,” he said. “Like I said: cold tub, ice. With other nagging injuries, just make sure you get with the training staff and a little bit of strength work, just to make sure you’re right.”\n\nFor the record, Shumpert even keeps a gallon of water in his car.\n\nLove cleared\n\nTo travel, that is. The Cavs’ forward — who has been on the bench for a couple of playoff games after suffering a left shoulder injury against the Boston Celtics and consequently undergoing surgery — received the OK to travel with the team for the duration of the playoffs, ESPN reported and the team confirmed Tuesday. Despite his contract status (he can opt out after the season), whenever Love’s been shown on Quicken Loans Arena’s Humongotron he’s received wild ovations.\n\nCorporate synergy\n\nTNT, which falls under the Time Warner umbrella and has aired the Eastern Conference Finals, took the time to get in a promo from the upcoming film version of Entourage, the first of the popular HBO television series that went off the air several years ago.\n\nKevin Connolly, Kevin Dillon, Jerry Ferrara and Adrian Grenier appeared to hype up the crowd during the break between the first and second quarters."
