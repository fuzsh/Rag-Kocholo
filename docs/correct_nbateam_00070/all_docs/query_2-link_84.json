        "text": "Former NBA All-Star Kyle Korver is joining Steve Nash's Brooklyn Nets staff as a player development coach, sources told The Athletic's Shams Charania.\n\nKorver hasn't officially retired from playing, though he didn't appear in an NBA game during the 2020-21 season. He most recently played with the Milwaukee Bucks in 2019-20, serving as a deep-rotation floor-spacer and veteran voice in the locker room.\n\nThe 40-year-old sharpshooter has averaged 9.7 points and three rebounds across 17 NBA seasons. He notably shot 42.87% from 3-point territory for his career to sit 10th on the all-time leaderboard and 0.9 percentage points ahead of Nash (42.78%). He led the league in long-range accuracy in four separate seasons.\n\nKorver made his lone All-Star appearance in 2015 while with the Atlanta Hawks."
