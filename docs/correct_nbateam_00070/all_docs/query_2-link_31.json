        "text": "The Memphis Grizzlies have agreed transfer Kyle Korver's contract, who had arrived from Utah not long ago, to the Phoenix Suns; However, the Arizona entity is not considering retaining the contract of the veteran forward and living legend of the three-point shot for next season, as journalist Adrian Wojnarowski has been able to point out (ESPN).\n\nThe Suns would cut Korver's contract to make room for Ricky Rubio's (51 million in three years), otherwise their salary schemes would not fit. Kyle Korver's contract for the upcoming season is a total of 7,5 million dollars, but only 3,4 million are guaranteed. That means that Phoenix could terminate the player's contract having to pay him no more than 3,4 million, which would also take up available space in the Postal Code of the franchise for the 2019-20 financial year.\n\nAnd in that scenario would enter the Lakers, Philadelphia 76ers and Milwaukee Bucks, teams interested in Korver, as long as he came out of his current contract and could sign as a free agent, after the period of waivers. There is no doubt that Korver (38 years old) would add outside quality to any of the three squads. It would be like May water for Lakers and Sixers, some due to the lack of outside shooting in general (second worst percentage from three last year) and another due to the departure of JJ Redick, who will play in New Orleans.\n\nThe Bucks could also use some proven outside experience since they will no longer have the shooting skills of Malcolm Brogdon or Nikola Mirotic. By the way, sources close to the matter were able to confirm nbamaniacs that the arrival of the Spanish international to Barcelona is not yet closed.\n\n(Cover photo: Christian Petersen/Getty Images)"
