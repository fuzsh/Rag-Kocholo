        "text": "The Philadelphia 76ers have recently hired Eddie Jordan as their new head coach. With Jordan, comes his offensive system that the 76ers need some new personnel for. The Princeton offense.\n\nThe offense is not that complex, but one of the biggest needs for the offense to succeed is some pure shooters, something the 76ers so not have at this point.\n\nThis off-season the Sixers have a chance to capitalize on their weakness by signing at least two proven shooters, if all goes well for the Sixers.\n\nFor starters, Kyle Korver, remember him, has a possibility of testing free agency. The Utah Jazz hold am early termination option on Korver. This means that if the Jazz feel that they are paying too much for Korver, they could let him loose without paying him the rest of his contract.\n\nThis is the best possible news for the Sixers right now. General Manager Ed Stefanski traded away Korver almost as soon as he arrived in Philly, but that was because he did not fit the Sixers system at the time. Now, that the Sixers are in need of a pure shooter like Korver, they probably scoop him up if he would hit the market.\n\nOther possibilities are Eddie House, who has a player option. If House would opt out of his current contract, the Sixers would sweep him up as well. House would be in the top five pure shooters on the market.\n\nThe only problem would be House's age. He is 31, so the Sixers could not lock him up in a long term deal like they could Korver. House would be a perfect fit in the Sixers new system, and would allow the Sixers to let go of Willie Green, who does not have any business in this system.\n\nThe best possible player that the Sixers could pick up this offseason would be Hedo Turkoglu. Turkoglu has an early termination option as well.\n\nIf the Magic do not win the NBA Finals, Turkoglu would likely opt out of his contract. Turkoglu wants the big bucks, and with the Magic giving all of their money to Rashard Lewis, they will probably not have enough money to pay Hedo what he wants.\n\nSurprisingly, Ben Gordon is an unrestricted free agent this summer. Gordon is an incredible scorer who is basically unstoppable when he gets going, and is on a roll. Gordon would be cheaper than Turkoglu, and would be a perfect fit in the system, but would just be another guard that the Sixers have to find minutes for."
