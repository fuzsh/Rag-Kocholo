        "text": "The Milwaukee Bucks have signed free agent guard Kyle Korver. “Kyle is an elite three-point shooter who will play an impactful role for our team,” said Bucks General Manager Jon Horst. “In addition to bringing tremendous experience, Kyle is familiar with Coach Bud’s system having played under him for three-plus seasons in Atlanta. Kyle is a highly-respected player and person both on and off the court and we are thrilled to welcome him and his family to the Bucks.”\n\nStoryline: Kyle Korver Free Agency\n\nKyle Korver to Milwaukee\n\nFree-agent guard Kyle Korver has agreed to a one-year, $2.6 million deal with the Milwaukee Bucks, his agent Jeff Schwartz of Excel Sports told ESPN. Korver labored on a decision between the Bucks and Philadelphia 76ers, but his history and relationship with coach Mike Budenholzer played a significant role in his ultimate choice, league sources said.\n\nThis rumor is part of a storyline: 22 more rumors\n\nPut James and Davis in a pick-and-roll, spread the floor with those shooters (who also will work hard at the other end) and let the magic happen. Throw in the possibility of adding a champion such as Andre Iguodala and another veteran role player along the way — perhaps even another shooter such as Kyle Korver — and the formula is there. “There’s no question this is a much stronger team that fits around LeBron better,” said one league executive. “They started backups a lot last season, and they had some guys on their bench that shouldn’t have been in the league,” said one scout. “If they stay healthy, they have a playoff lineup now.”"
