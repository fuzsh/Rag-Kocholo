        "meta_description": "Kyle Korver was one of the top swingmen in the NBA for much of his 17-season professional career. With the Utah Jazz in 2009â10, his seventh year in the league, he shot .536 from three-point range, setting an NBA single-season record. He ranks fifth all-time in three-pointers made (2,450) and 10th in three-point field goal percentage (.429). He also led the league in three-point percentage a record four times.\n \nKorver was a 2003 second-round pick of the New Jersey Nets â who dealt him to the Philadelphia 76ers in a draft-day trade â and played for six teams in his career. He played in two straight NBA Finals with the Cleveland Cavaliers (in 2017 and 2018), losing both to the Golden State Warriors. His last stop in the league was with the Milwaukee Bucks, for whom he played in 2019â20. In August 2021, the Brooklyn Nets hired him as a player development coach.\n \nKorver came to the NBA out of Creighton, where he was a second-team All-America as a senior, as well as a repeat winner of the Missouri Valley Conferenceâs Player of the Year award. Born in Paramount, California, he grew up a fan of the Los Angeles Lakers. In 1993, he moved with his family to Pella, Iowa, when his father became a pastor at a church there. He graduated from Pella High in 1999.",
