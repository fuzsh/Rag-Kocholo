        "text": "A trying spring is closing with an honorable moment for Kyle Korver.\n\nThe 37-year-old Cleveland Cavaliers guard and Pella native will be inducted into the Creighton University athletics hall of fame in August, the school announced Wednesday.\n\nKorver played basketball at the Omaha, Nebraska school from 1999-2003 and was a consensus second-team All-American as a senior. He is the only player in program history to play in four NCAA Tournaments, and Korver remains the Creighton and MVC record-holder with 371 career 3-pointers.\n\nKorver dealt with considerable personal tragedy earlier this year, when his younger brother Kirk died in mid-March at age 27 after battling an undisclosed illness.\n\nKyle Korver was simultaneously nursing a foot injury and first returned to the court two weeks after his brother's death.\n\nMORE ON THE KORVERS\n\nKirk Korver remembered as a kind, gentle basketball star\n\nKyle Korver to parents at brother's funeral: 'You will always have four sons'\n\nDelicate balance: Time to grieve, time to play for Kyle Korver\n\nFrom the archives: Pella's Korvers the first family of Iowa basketball\n\nKyle ended the 2017-18 regular season averaging 9.2 points in 73 games, a shade below his 9.9-point career average, but he logged postseason minutes for the sixth consecutive year as the Cavaliers reached the NBA finals.\n\nKorver's productivity dipped in the playoffs, with his scoring average dropping to 8.3 points per game. He logged just 65 total minutes and six total points for runner-up Cleveland in the Cavaliers' four-game sweep at the hands of the Golden State Warriors.\n\nKorver was the 51st overall pick in the 2003 NBA Draft and has played with the Philadelphia 76ers, Utah Jazz, Chicago Bulls and Atlanta Hawks in addition to Cleveland. He is the only player to lead the NBA in 3-point percentage four times, and he ranks fourth in NBA history with 2,213 career triples.\n\nHe has two years remaining on a 3-year, $22 million deal with the Cavaliers, who face an uncertain offseason with superstar LeBron James contemplating his future with the team.\n\nKorver will be inducted into the Creighton hall of fame Aug. 25."
