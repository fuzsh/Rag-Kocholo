        "text": "PHILADELPHIA — Paul Millsap scored 17 points to lead five Hawks in double figures as Atlanta routed the Philadelphia 76ers 104-72 on Saturday afternoon.\n\nKyle Korver chipped in 15 points and Mike Muscala added 14 for Atlanta.\n\nThe Hawks barely needed top offseason acquisition Dwight Howard. The big man had just two points and seven rebounds in his second game for his hometown team after signing a three-year, $70 million free-agent contract this summer. The 31-year-old center had 19 rebounds and 11 points in Atlanta's season-opening 114-99 win over Washington on Thursday.\n\nDennis Schroder displayed the playmaking ability the Hawks are counting on with him taking over for Jeff Teague as the team's point guard. After getting two assists in the opener, Schroder had 11 to go with 11 points against Philadelphia.\n\nJoel Embiid and Sergio Rodriguez had 14 points apiece for the 76ers.\n\nMillsap scored four points during Atlanta's 8-2 run to open the fourth quarter, capped by Muscala's 17-foot jumper for an 82-60 lead, making a Philadelphia comeback unlikely.\n\nAfter sitting out for two years due to a foot injury, Embiid dazzled the home crowd with 20 points and seven rebounds in 22 minutes in Wednesday's season-opening loss to Oklahoma City. The third overall pick in the 2014 draft, Embiid had trouble staying on the court in the opening half against Orlando.\n\nMoments after chants of \"Trust the process! Trust the process!\" serenaded Embiid on the free-throw line, the crowd erupted in the second quarter when Embiid rejected Howard. Embiid had to go to the bench seconds later after picking up his third foul. The Hawks took advantage, outscoring Philadelphia 17-10 from that point to enter the intermission up 53-39.\n\nPhiladelphia could get only within 10 points in the third quarter on Jerami Grant's highlight-reel reverse dunk. But the Hawks scored eight of the final 10 points of the period to enter the fourth quarter ahead 74-58.\n\nTIP-INS\n\n• Hawks: DeAndre Bembry scored two points for Atlanta. The rookie is a product of nearby St. Joseph's University. He received cheers when he entered with just under six minutes left. . Millsap, a three-time All-Star, is averaging a team-best 22.5 points per game through two games.\n\n• 76ers: Philadelphia, which started 0-18 on the way to a 10-72 mark last season, looks for its first win with its third straight home game to start the season, Tuesday against the Magic. Five of the 76ers' first six games are at home. . Philadelphia is playing without three starters due to injury: Jerryd Bayless (wrist), Nerlens Noel (knee) and 2016 No. 1 pick Ben Simmons (foot)."
