        "text": "Kyle Korver's lengthy NBA career has come to an end, and he already has a job lined up.\n\nThe veteran sharpshooter has joined the Brooklyn Nets as an assistant coach specializing in player development, according to The Athletic's Shams Charania.\n\nThe move brings Korver's playing days to a close after 17 seasons spent with six different teams. He currently sits at No. 4 on the NBA's all-time 3-pointers list with 2,450 and No. 10 in 3-point percentage at 42.9 percent, making him one of the greatest perimeter shooters in the history of the league.\n\nKorver, who averaged 9.7 points, 3.0 rebounds and 1.7 assists per game in his career, will reunite with Nets guard Kyrie Irving, who overlapped with him on the Cleveland Cavaliers for a season. He will also rejoin the organization that originally drafted him in the second round of the 2003 NBA draft before trading him to the Philadelphia 76ers.\n\nAccording to Korver, though, the Nets — then known as the New Jersey Nets — didn't exactly get huge value for him. Here's how he told it after hearing his name called with the 51st overall pick:\n\nKorver would never play for the Nets in his career, but there were apparently no hard feelings. He will certainly be joining an organization with a use for his specific expertise, as the Nets ranked in the top 10 in 3-point rate on their field goal attempts last season.\n\nMore from Yahoo Sports:"
