        "text": "DENVER — Allen Iverson took plenty of shots at his former team, and not all of them during the game.\n\nHis 30 points weren't enough, however, as Kyle Korver scored 26 points to help the Philadelphia 76ers beat the Denver Nuggets 108-97 Tuesday night in Iverson's first game against his former team.\n\nIverson was 10-of-24 before getting tossed for his second technical with 1:44 remaining.\n\nIverson's best shots came before tip-off when he once again ripped the team that traded him to Denver over the holidays, repeating his contention that he should have had more say in the Sixers' style.\n\nThe Sixers, who had lost 14 of 16 road games and 19 of their last 23 overall, scored 100 points for the first time in 16 games and improved to 4-4 since the trade that sent Joe Smith and Andre Miller to Philadelphia, along with two first-round draft picks in 2007, for Iverson.\n\nMiller had 17 points and 10 assists against his former team and Smith scored 12 points.\n\nThe Nuggets have lost four of six since Iverson's arrival, although he has yet to play with NBA scoring leader Carmelo Anthony and J.R. Smith, the league's top scoring tandem before their suspensions for slugging it out with the New York Knicks last month.\n\nThe Sixers, who led by 19 in the second quarter before the Nuggets rallied to tie it at 52 at halftime, led 86-73 after three quarters.\n\nTwo free throws, a pull-up 3-pointer and a driving layup by Iverson brought Denver to 86-80 but Steven Hunter's dunk followed by three free throws by Korver — one on an Iverson technical — restored Philadelphia's double-digit lead.\n\nRookie Yakhouba Diawara scored a season-best 23 points for Denver on the heels of an 0-for-11 shooting performance against Dallas.\n\nAfter the morning shootaround, Iverson said he felt a player of his stature and tenure should have been listened to when he criticized the Sixers' style of play last month, a condemnation that led to his departure from Philadelphia after 10 tumultuous seasons.\n\nIverson said he was still bitter with the way Sixers coach Maurice Cheeks and team owner Billy King handled his complaints that led to his departure from Philadelphia.\n\nIverson ignored Cheeks on Tuesday night, and he wasn't the only point guard who wasn't exactly eager to see his former coach. Miller walked right past George Karl before the game and didn't even acknowledge him.\n\n\"He didn't return calls to me when he played here. Why would he call me now?\" said Karl, who counted Miller among his favorite pupils.\n\nNotes: There was a moment of silence before tip-off for Darrent Williams, the Broncos' cornerback who was killed Monday. ... Iverson won't get to face the Sixers in Philadelphia this season because the Nuggets made their annual trip there before the trade. ... The Nuggets recalled G Julius Hodge from the Colorado 14ers of the NBA's developmental league. He played in 14 games as a rookie last year before he was wounded in a drive-by shooting and missed the remainder of the season. He entered the game in the final minute for his first action since getting shot last April but didn't record any stats."
