        "text": "Kyle Korver has fought father time and gotten better as he’s aged.\n\nAustin Williams\n\n·\n\nFollow\n\n3 min read\n\n·\n\nJun 24, 2017\n\n--\n\nThere are few things that get better with age. Wine, wisdom, and cheese are examples of this. When most things age there are many things that could go south. When people age we get weaker; we’re always moving closer to death. Age also leads to a lot of foods ending up rotten or moldy. There are not a lot of things that get better with age.\n\nSome things break that mold. Some people break that mold. In professional basketball, players progressively get worse after their prime. Their body just can’t live up to the expectations they put on themselves. They lose the athleticism they once had, and attempt to find different ways of contributing to the game. These ways tend not to work for them, because it is not the style of play they were once so familiar with.\n\nKyle Korver broke that mold. Age hasn’t stopped him from continuing to be a successful basketball player.\n\nStarting his collegiate career at Creighton University in 1999, Kyle Korver began his three point spectacular. Shooting an average of about 45% behind the arc, he made 371 of his three point attempts in his four years in college.\n\nHaving an average three point shooting percentage of 45% would mean Korver would have to hit about a little over two 3 pointers in every five attempts. That would make any coach happy.\n\nIn the 2nd round of the 2003 NBA draft, Korver was drafted by the New Jersey (now Brooklyn) Nets with the 22nd pick (51st Overall.) His rights were then traded to the Philadelphia 76ers for $125,000 later that night. Starting his rookie season he signed a two-year deal with Philadelphia. After having an underwhelming rookie season, only averaging 4.1 points in 11.9 minutes per game, Korver really stepped up his game in the upcoming 2004–2005 season. He was tied for the league leader in three pointers made, making 226, which was and still is the all-time Philadelphia franchise record.\n\nAfter playing in Philadelphia, Korver has now played for 4 other teams in his 14 year career. Since then he has played for the Utah Jazz, Chicago Bulls, Atlanta Hawks, and now the Cleveland Cavaliers.\n\nStarting with the Hawks at the age of 31, Korver was starting to near the end of his Prime years. Korver, being not as physical as the other players in the league, decided to become a better team defender as well becoming fundamentally sound.\n\nWatch this clip of how Korver displays his defensive impact. First Korver, guarding the man in the corner, recognizes what play the Lakers are running. He then stops the backdoor cut, a would be easy layup. He then tells his own teammate Paul Millsap to help on a drive, and then picks up Millsap’s man, and then even contests a shot from deep.\n\nKorver’s ability to be the “floor general” of the defense goes to show how he was a central part of Coach Mike Budenholzer’s system.\n\nSince this play over three years ago, Korver has continued to prove that he can overcome his lack of size, speed and athleticism at the 2 or 3.\n\nEven his advanced defensive metrics have improved since turning 30 playing for the Atlanta Hawks. Korver has averaged 2.45 defensive win shares per 82 games while playing for Atlanta. Before then he only averaged 1.78 Defensive win shares per 82 games in his career. Those aren’t necessarily suggesting Korver is a dominate defender, but do show the improvement in his later years.\n\nFrom 2011–2015 Korver a true shooting percentage above 60 percent, his highest being 69.9 percent in 2014–15, also the year of his lone All-Star game appearance.\n\nHe has lead the league in three point percentage three times nearly shooting 50% from deep at the age of 33. In fact, since turning 30 he shot 45.5 percent from three, increasing his three point percentage 4.4 percent over the years.\n\nThis is why the Cleveland Cavaliers acquired him in their championship run this past year. Though old (36), Korver’s consistency and improvement defensively and from behind the arc makes him an invaluable asset.\n\nKyle Korver has aged like fine wine. But even better."
