On December 29th, 2007, the Utah Jazz traded guard Gordan Giricek with a 2010 1st round draft pick (Trevor Booker) to the Philadelphia 76ers for forward Kyle Korver.

Kyle Korver was drafted in the second round of the 2003 draft by the New Jersey Nets and his rights were sold to the Philadelphia 76ers. He became a surprise and good find for Philadelphia becoming a great three point marksman. In four and a half seasons, Korver averaged 10.5 PPG and 3.2 RPG, and finished up as second all-time leading three-point shooter (661 made) in Philadelphia’s history behind Allen Iverson.

Giricek had fallen out of favor with Jazz coach Jerry Sloan after the two had a heated exchange during a timeout in a December 19th game at Charlotte. The 6-foot-5 reserve guard was ordered to the locker room and was sent home for three games and never played again for the Jazz. (via ESPN)

Giricek averaged 8.9 PPG in about four seasons with the Utah Jazz. His best individual season was an injury-riddled 10.6 PPG in 37 games.

The Sixers saved approximately $15 million in this deal. Giricek, who was making $4 million the season of the trade, had an expiring contract. Korver, who was earning $4.4 million that year, and had $15.4 million owed to him in the next three years after.

The trade was made as a salary dump so the Sixers could become players in the 2008 NBA Free Agency period. The Sixers ended up signing Elton Brand and re-signed Andre Iguodala to contracts that amounted to a guaranteed $162 million over six years.

The first-round pick had the following provisions:

The pick can start no sooner than 2009.

The Sixers have seven years in which to make it.

Korver played in two and a half seasons with Utah in a bench role for some solid Jazz playoff squads. Korver averaged 8.7 PPG over 180 games with Utah. He left the Jazz after the 2009-10 season for the Chicago Bulls in Free Agency.

Giricek only lasted 12 games with Philadelphia before being waived. He was picked up by the Phoenix Suns for the rest of the season, and never played again in the NBA after that season.

The first round draft pick that Philadelphia received was traded by them to Minnesota with Calvin Booth and Rodney Carney for essentially nothing to clear cap space to facilitate the signing of Elton Brand. Minnesota used the pick to draft forward Trevor Booker in 2010 at the 23rd slot and subsequently traded his rights to Washington in a four-player deal on draft night.

Kyle Korver (via Philadelphia Inquirer):

“I am not totally shocked, but I am surprised. I feel I can fit in well in Utah, but the hardest part is leaving the city of Philadelphia, where I had great friendships not only with my teammates but the people here who have been great to me.”

Utah Jazz senior vice president of basketball operations Kevin O'Connor (via Philadelphia Inquirer):

“We think Kyle is a good basketball player who has proven he can make shots and proven he can play in the NBA, and we’re happy to acquire him.”

Philadelphia 76ers president of basketball operations Ed Stefanski (via ESPN):

“We’re probably the only team that has that kind of money. We’d like to be a player in the free-agent or trade market this summer. We get in the game by doing this. Where we are right now, we have to do more things and add more pieces to this puzzle. Are we done? I couldn’t answer that question. But we do have chips that people like.”

On Kyle Korver:

“I want to thank Kyle for the positive impact he has made on this team and the city of Philadelphia through his play on the court and, even more importantly, his philanthropic efforts off of it.”

On Giricek:

“It’s a clean slate. He was excited to be joining the team.”

Sixers coach Maurice Cheeks (via Philadelphia Inquirer):

“He is one of the best in my time being in this league, not only coaching, he is one of the classiest guys who was always doing things for the good of the team.

Deron Williams in the following season (via Deseret News):

"I definitely like the trade. I like Gira as a person, but he just never really clicked with this team, meshed with this team, meshed with coach. There was always problems there. It could be a little bit of a distraction at times, so I think having Kyle here has been great.”
