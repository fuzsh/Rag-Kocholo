        "text": "In 1977, a special version for television titled Der Pate - Die Saga (1977) was prepared by director Francis Ford Coppola and editor Barry Malkin by re-editing Der Pate (1972) and Der Pate 2 (1974) in chronological order and adding deleted scenes. Most of these deleted scenes are also included separately as special features on the DVD releases and on The Godfather 1902-1959: The Complete Epic and The Godfather Trilogy: 1901-1980 (1992). Among the deleted scenes:\n\nThe opening credit sequence features additional shots of the Corleone compound. These shots were later used in the beginning of Der Pate 3 (1990).\n\nThe opening credit sequence also features additional shots of Michael sitting alone contemplatively, an alternate take of young Vito waving little Michael's hand on the train in Sicily, and a longer take of Michael looking at Fredo at their mother's wake.\n\nDon Ciccio's henchmen look for the boy Vito at his home. Vito's mother says she will bring him to Ciccio herself.\n\nDon Fanucci tells the theater impresario that he should feature Sicilian songs or opera and then comically sings examples.\n\nAfter Fanucci leaves, the impresario smacks his daughter for walking in at the wrong time.\n\nVito sees a group of hoods jump Don Fanucci and slice his neck. This explains the scar on his neck seen later.\n\nGenco tells Vito about the attack on Fanucci and Vito pretends not to know about it.\n\nIn the café, Clemenza tells Vito that he will never work a regular job like his father did.\n\nVito meets Tessio for the first time outside a warehouse with Clemenza. They take the bag of guns inside to a man named Augustino Coppola. He tells his young son, Carmine Coppola, to play the flute as entertainment while he works on the guns. This is a tribute to Francis Ford Coppola's grandfather and father. The men also leave the warehouse with a bunch of dresses.\n\nClemenza tries to sell a dress to a married woman and ends up having sex with her while Tessio and Vito wait outside.\n\nAn additional shot of Vito driving down the street before Fanucci jumps in.\n\nAdditional dialogue after Fanucci gets out of Vito's truck.\n\nAdditional dialogue when Vito, Clemenza, and Tessio discuss how to handle Fanucci.\n\nAn extended version of the scene where Vito first talks to Signor Roberto.\n\nSignor Roberto asks Genco if he can speak with \"Don Vito\".\n\nClemenza brings a young Jewish boy named Hyman Suchowsky to see Vito. Clemenza wants to rename him \"Johnny Lips\", but Vito decides he will be called \"Hyman Rothstein\" after Jewish gangster Arnold Rothstein.\n\nWhen Vito returns to Sicily, he kills the two henchmen that looked for him as a boy. One he finds passed out in a hut and stabs, the other he rows up to on a lake and kills with an oar.\n\nA wide shot of the train leaving the station in Sicily.\n\nA quick shot of people waltzing at Anthony's communion party.\n\nA quick shot of the bandleader looking at the dancers as he is conducting.\n\nA man taking home movies of Tom and his family.\n\nFredo shows up late to Anthony's communion party because his wife, Deana, is drunk. She runs up the driveway demanding to see Michael, then falls down and knocks down Fredo when he tries to pick her up. Fredo warns her not to embarrass him.\n\nA thirsty Pentangeli tries to get a beer or wine at the communion party, but all the waiters have are champagne cocktails. This explains why he is seen drinking from a garden hose.\n\nAt the party, Sonny's widow, Sandra, brings their daughter Francesca and her fiancé, Gardner, to see Michael. Fredo barges in to tell Michael that Pentangeli is outside. Michael gives Francesca and Gardner his blessing to get married. She sees Kay and tells her the good news.\n\nAl Neri tells Michael that he's tracked down Fabrizio, the man who murdered Michael's first wife, Apollonia. He now runs a pizza parlor in New York and is living under the name \"Fred Vincent\". He was brought to New York by Barzini.\n\nA shot of four opera singers performing at the party.\n\nA quick shot of Rocco berating one of his men.\n\nAnthony runs towards the area where the buttonmen are sitting and Kay chases after him, warning him to stay away. She then grabs and hugs Anthony.\n\nPentangeli sits with Anthony and drinks a full glass of wine in one gulp. Then, he gives Anthony a $100 bill.\n\nAl Neri goes to a casino and fires Klingman on orders of Michael. When Klingman won't leave, Neri smacks him, chases him into a rehearsal of a stage show and threatens him with a chair. Klingman agrees to leave, then Neri tells the performers to continue the rehearsal which he stays and watches.\n\nFabrizio gets into his car outside his pizza parlor. He turns the ignition, and the car explodes. He falls out of the car and crawls around a bit before he dies.\n\nThe final scene is Kay in a Catholic church lighting candles and praying."
