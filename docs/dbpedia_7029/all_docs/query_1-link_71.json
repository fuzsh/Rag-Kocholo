        "text": "I unlocked something during a screening of THE GODFATHER PART II on the weekend. I’ve seen the film dozens of times – probably as much as I have seen the original film, as I always watch the pair together – and this was the second time I’ve seen the sequel on the big screen; but I noticed something that had eluded me all these years.\n\nIn the final ten minutes of the film, we are delivered three iconic scenes: Fredo’s murder by Al Neri at the behest of Michael, followed by the scene that takes place before the events of the first film where they are gathered for Vito’s birthday, and finally that shot of Michael sat alone amongst a forest of dead leaves – one of the greatest downer endings of all time.\n\nI had thought that Michael’s ruminations in that final scene were on a range of subjects that had led him to this point: Fredo’s betrayal and subsequent murder, the death of his mother, Kay’s abortion of his child, and their subsequent separation.\n\nBut I now think it’s something more specific than that.\n\nIn that star-studded scene that appears between Fredo’s murder and the final shot of Michael, I’d always focused on James Caan’s domineering appearance. We see the Long Island compound in happier times, as they await the arrival of Vito who we will never see (Brando had initially agreed to return for the cameo, but didn’t show up for the single day’s shooting likely due to financial disputes with Paramount).\n\nWe see Michael sitting opposite his brothers, Sonny, Tom and Fredo. Carlo is brought in and introduced to Connie for the first time, and we even see Abe Vigoda appear as Tessio, bringing the birthday cake.\n\nI always thought the narrative purpose for the scene was to show Michael’s announcement to the family that he’s joined the Marines: the family are talking about the news of the Pearl Harbour attack, Sonny refers to the men who have enlisted as a bunch of saps; Michael says they are fighting for their country and announces he has also joined up.\n\nWhat follows are a tense couple of minutes. Sonny is visibly disgusted, and needs to be restrained from hitting his youngest brother. Tom is disappointed, though in a more measured way, outlining how he and his father had plans for him (something which Michael takes as a slight that acts as subtle motivation for some of his comments and actions towards Tom during the rest of the film). Connie and Carlo, perceived to be so far down the pecking order, are not allowed to comment and are instructed to leave the room.\n\nThe reaction that has always stood out to me though is Fredo’s. After his brothers’ initial negative reaction, Fredo says “That’s swell, Mike; congratulations,” and offers his hand for Michael to shake, which is thrust away in disgust by Sonny. I’d always taken this as a throwaway example of Fredo’s naivety, and his inability to read a situation; another reason he was ‘stepped over’, as he puts it earlier to Michael.\n\nInstead, it’s Fredo’s response that stands as the only shred of positivity in the room. Either he’s genuinely happy for Michael’s news, or he’s standing up for his younger brother after his older brothers are so damning. It’s perhaps both. Either way, it’s proof that Fredo’s heart, like Michael’s at that point, hasn’t been corrupted by the family.\n\nI had thought that the scene was there to act as a nice resolution to the two films, acting as a full-circle loop to tie the narrative up. Instead, I now think it’s simply a memory of Michael’s – as he sits and stews in that final shot, over what he’s just done to the only brother that was ever genuinely kind to him. This quite upset me in the cinema, and moved me more than the film has ever done before.\n\n*\n\nTHE GODFATHER PART II stands as one of the only sequels to win Best Picture at the Academy Awards – the other being THE RETURN OF THE KING, which always felt more like recognition of all three LORD OF THE RINGS films rather than that specific film’s achievement.\n\nCoppola’s film overreaches wildly, but it nearly all hits its target. It’s the best-structured film I can think of – part prequel, part sequel, with both stories executed in parallel to highlight the similarities, and differences, between Vito’s rise to power and Michael’s attempts to maintain that power. More than anything it feels like two films for the price of one, and I get the feeling any studio today would release them independently of each other.\n\nThe other thing the film does beautifully is present a host of subtle echoes from the first film: the Cuba boardroom meeting echoing the meeting of the five families, Vito taking a concealed gun to commit the murder that will change his fate, Michael’s thunderous face learning about Kay’s abortion echoing a similar look just before he shoots Sollozzo and McCluskey, Tom and Kay’s conversations around safety next to the compound gate. There are undoubtedly more…\n\nAs well as another beautiful Nino Rota score, I also look forward to the film’s appearances by younger up-and-coming actors: Danny Aeillo’s bungled assassination of Frankie ‘Five Angels’ Pentangali, Bruno Kirby’s scheming take on a young Clemenza, Harry Dean Stanton’s Federal agent and Joe Spinell reprising his role as ‘button man’ Willi Cicci from the first film. The cameo by an eagle-eyed Roger Corman on the Senate Committee is also a nice surprise.\n\nI used to prefer the simpler, more linear scenes with Robert De Niro’s Vito Corleone but the older I get the more I’m obsessed with Michael’s scenes in Lake Tahoe, Miami & Cuba.\n\nHit: Main Title / The Immigrant\n\nHidden Gem: Remember Vito Andolini\n\nAll hail the greatest cinema in Auckland – the Event cinema on Broadway in Newmarket. Not only was this the location where I met both Quentin Tarantino and Danny Boyle, but last Friday night they played The Godfather.\n\nFor a long time, The Godfather has been among my favourite films. I first saw it around the age of 17 or 18, and was immediately obsessed with it. It was probably the first film I was obsessed with as an adult. Prior obsessions as a teenager included the likes of Die Hard, Lethal Weapon, Terminator 2: Judgement Day and Aliens, so The Godfather was definitely a step-up, being such a decorated film and a more serious one at that.\n\nI don’t know why the film struck such a chord with me, but it’s something I’ve never become tired with. I have a number of books on the film – Peter Cowie’s The Godfather Book and Mario Puzo’s original novel being early targets, and Harlan Lebo’s The Godfather Legacy being a happy find in more recent year. The soundtrack of Nino Rota’s score sits on my record shelves – a strange Australian pressing with a murky green cover – and of course, I have the Coppola Restoration of the trilogy on blu-ray. At University, I remember walking through a field to the supermarket with my housemates, feeling like Michael walking through Sicily accompanied by his bodyguards.\n\nSeeing a film on the big screen is always a different prospect than watching at home though. You notice things that you would never have noticed in hundreds of home viewings – a character’s glance, a line of dialogue, the way the light falls on an object outside of the immediate foreground of a shot. It’s also nice to see it in a room full of people. The screening I saw was almost sold out, and full of much younger people than I was expecting.\n\nAs a film, it shouldn’t be so good. It goes against so many cinematic rules. The lead protagonist is clearly Michael, yet we don’t see him until a good five or ten minutes into the film, and even then he is introduced as a supporting character. Vito is initially offered as the film’s hero – or anti-hero – but his gunning down towards the end of the first act provides the film’s first challenge, a shake-up to decide not only who is going to become the patriarch of the Corleone family, but also the film’s lead protagonist.\n\nBy the end of the film, Michael’s actions have transferred him from protagonist to antagonist, and the stone-cold denoument where Michael’s study door is slowly closed on Kay, is matched only by the ending of The Godfather Part II where he sits alone to contemplate the terrible things he has done to his family.\n\nSpeaking of which, I’ll be seeing a screening of The Godfather Part II this Friday night. Same cinema, same seat probably. Leave the gun; take the cannoli.\n\nHit: Main Title\n\nHidden Gem: The Pickup\n\nI love The Matrix. It’s one of my favourite films of the ‘90s; probably my favourite science-fiction film of that decade. It’s an awesome movie, but I think I like it more for what it represents than for what it actually is. For me, the Matrix represents a truly wonderful thing – the end of George Lucas’ reign over special-effects movies in Hollywood.\n\nYes, Lucas was responsible for a great deal of my childhood cinema: the three original Star Wars films, and the three original Indiana Jones films. A round of applause, please. But that’s it. Nothing else. His 1973 breakout hit American Graffiti might be an enjoyable slice of 1950s nostalgia, but Back To The Future did it much better in 1985. And let’s not get started on the Star Wars prequels or the fourth Indiana Jones film.\n\nHis legacy is one of the things that ultimately curses him: Industrial Light & Magic. The special effects house set up to handle the myriad of effects shots in the first Star Wars film ultimately came to monopolise Hollywood in the decades that followed. The company may have been trendsetters in the late 1970s and early 1980s, and they hit a peak with the groundbreaking effects in 1992’s Terminator 2: Judgement Day, but by the late 1990s they had lost their edge. Nothing was special anymore; they had become complacent. The company that had once blown everybody away were now resting on their laurels.\n\nThen a film was released in 1999 out of nowhere. Titled The Matrix, it was written and directed by brothers Larry and Andy (now Lana and Lilly) Wachowski, responsible at that point for only directing one film, Bound (1996), a crime thriller starring Jennifer Tilly and Gina Gershon.\n\nThe Matrix came along with no hype. From the outside it looked like just another science-fiction film out of Hollywood, with a steam-punk aesthetic that we had seen before in dull gothic flicks like The Crow (1994) and Dark City (1998). The lack of advance word even led to UK film magazine Empire relegating the film to its ‘Also released this month” section.\n\nI saw the film at the cinema with my good buddy Stotty. Talk about being blown away. I was so engrossed that a Coca-Cola-induced urge to go to the toilet mid-way through had to be repressed. I wasn’t going to miss a second of this, particularly after being sideswiped by the film’s major left turn around twenty minutes in.\n\nThe idea, in retrospect, is simple: introduce the audience to the main character, then towards the end of the first act, suggest that the narrative you’re following is a fallacy, and that the film’s protagonist is being similarly hoodwinked. Hollywood had recently provided a film with a similar narrative hook, in Peter Weir’s The Truman Show (1998). Truman Burbank figures it out for himself when he overhears some radio chatter, almost gets pulverised by a studio light falling out of the sky, and notices the regularity of people bicycling down his street, but in The Matrix, our protagonist relies on others to wake him from his dream. Films ever since have played with the elastic nature of narrative. It seems like they’re ten a penny these days, but back in the late ‘90s it felt refreshing and new.\n\nEverything about The Matrix seemed well thought-out. The design, the cast, the music, the sound, the editing, everything; but what grabbed people most of all were the special effects. The Wachowskis rewrote the book, taking their lead from the infinite possibilities of Japanese Anime rather than traditional Hollywood special effects. Finally, seven years following Terminator 2: Judgement Day, here was something that we hadn’t seen before: Bullet Time.\n\nJohn Gaeta from Manex Visual Effects, working out of Alameda, California, developed a prototype of the effect prior to the film, and the Wachowskis jumped on it. Gaeta’s concept was based on an old idea – that a moving image is simply a sequence of still images played at high speed – but Gaeta’s application of the method to film action sequences was ingenious.\n\nA simple stunt, for example one character jumping up to kick another character, could be transformed from something very simple to something extraordinary. A rig featuring dozens of still cameras would bet set up around the actors, and the cameras would shoot the movement in the scene, before being compiled together to form a moving image. By employing a fairly simple idea, the filmmakers created the illusion of movement around the action, capturing the shot at super-slow motion, but still travelling at high-speed, hence ‘bullet’ time.\n\nThere’s an element of The Matrix borne out of a clichéd Hollywood trope – that of the white male protagonist being the saviour of the universe, or the ‘one’ as Neo’s anagrammatical name would suggest – but despite this, the films manages to still feel fresh. The main protagonist is derivative to a degree, taking the base elements of George Lucas’ original Star Wars conceit – that our hero is possessed with a magical ability to transcend all evil forces – but there’s so much innovation in the film, it’s easy to overlook this. It’s like receiving a pair of socks on Christmas Day, but finding that they turn you invisible when you put them on. Erm, thanks Aunty Flo.\n\nOf course, it’s impossible to talk about The Matrix without mentioning the sequels. At the time, they were exciting but just like the Star Wars prequels from George Lucas (him again), they suffered from a preponderance of weightless digital effects and little in the way of practical effects. Most Hollywood sequels are lazy rehashes of the same ideas that made the first film so interesting. The Wachowskis couldn’t be accused of this though; if anything, they overthought their sequels, giving them a highbrow slant that hasn’t been see in a sequel since The Godfather Part II.\n\nIt’s great to have Don Davis’ score to the film on this lovely slab of green wax. I probably enjoy the score as much as I love the pop soundtrack, which despite a few timeless classics is starting to feel very much of its time. I’m not familiar with Don Davis’ other work, but this is a great score – and its refreshing for a big action film to be scored by somebody other than John Williams, James Horner, Danny Elfman or Hans Zimmer.\n\nHit: Main Title\n\nHidden Gem: Welcome To The Real World"
