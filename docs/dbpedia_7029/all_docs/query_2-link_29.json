        "text": "Sequels had not yet become the Hollywood norm when Francis Ford Coppola signed up for a continuation to his hugely successful 1972 adaptation of Mario Puzo’s novel The Godfather, but this second film set a high standard for follow-ups in the way that it enriches and deepens the Corleone family narrative.\n\nRanging over multiple locations, Coppola’s film ambitiously intertwines two time periods: the story of Michael Corleone (Al Pacino) becoming increasingly consumed and isolated by his new power as head of the family, and flashbacks to his father Vito Corleone’s (Robert De Niro) arrival as an immigrant in New York, and his gradual ascent to power.\n\nThe project’s ambition did not go unrecognised: like the first film, it won best picture at the 1974 Academy Awards.\n\nThe Greatest Films of All Time\n\nDirectors’ 100 Greatest Films of All Time\n\nDirectors’ 100 Greatest Films of All Time\n\nWhere to begin\n\nWhere to begin with Francis Ford Coppola\n\nBy Brogan Morris\n\nWhere to begin with Francis Ford Coppola\n\nTalkies\n\nThe long take: New York stories\n\nBy Pamela Hutchinson\n\nThe long take: New York stories"
