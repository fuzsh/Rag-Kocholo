        "text": "Hello again, friends. I apologise for the lack of post last week — I heard that several riots broke out — but last week I was pretty unwell and barely had the energy to watch films, let alone scribble down my half-baked thoughts about them. As a result, I have a surplus of motion pictures that I’d like to mention, and therefore this entry is going to take on a much looser format than previously. By loose, I mean very messy and way too personal. I’m not going to go particularly into depth about the two titular films, although neither is exactly an unknown work. I must have seen more memes and promotional material about Dune: Part Two lately that I’ve had hot dinners (which isn’t that many, because I was unwell, remember) and people talk about The Godfather Part II almost as much as they talk about The Bible: Part II, aka The New Testament, aka The Jesus One.\n\nSpeaking of Jesus, two Thursdays ago I went to my local cinema for the Dune double bill. I relate that to our lord and saviour not because Herbert’s story is in part a Christ allegory, but because there were more than a few long-bearded men in attendance wearing sandals. At around 9pm, we all sat down to watch the first part of Denis Villeneuve’s adaptation of Frank Herbert’s book of Frank Herbert’s Dune, titled Dune. I’d seen it in 2021 on release and admittedly been unhappy with it. In fact, for the past two years I’d been going around telling people that yes, it looked pretty, but that I didn’t feel anything whilst watching it — that it felt empty. This is a problem I’d also had with Blade Runner 2049 and Arrival, and I had developed a pretty clear if unsolicited stance on Villeneuve’s sci-fi epics: they were pretty but soulless. Therefore, my expectations weren’t particularly high going into the double bill. You might be asking why I went to the double bill in the first place. The answer is that I wanted to, shut up. Anyway, it doesn’t matter, because I found myself actually enjoying Dune, or Dune: Part One as the title screen cheekily calls it and now everyone else is going to start calling it. Perhaps it was because with all the complicated subplots and characters established in my head I was freer to enjoy it. Perhaps I was just in a better mood. Perhaps they actually secretly went back and made Dune: Part One better. I like that option, because then I can be right both times.\n\nThe first film ended at midnight, just in time for Dune: Part Two to begin. When I say just in time, I mean there was absolutely no break between the two films. I had overheard someone asking at the popcorn counter (no, I didn’t get the bucket) if there was a break and had in confirmed that there in fact was not, so I ran to the toilets as soon as the credits started rolling on the first movie to pay water tribute, or whatever the people from Dune would say for peeing. Many unfortunate (read foolish) Duneheads made no such plans, and I think at least a dozen people missed the first few minutes of Dune: Part Two because they had assumed there would be at least a five minute break. (You might have read some other reviews of the film by now, but have any of them focused as much on the toilet situation as this one? Didn’t think so.) Anyway, part two began and I was pleasantly surprised to find that Villeneuve had made the sequel significantly weirder than the first. The opening sequence of Dune: Part Two is as visually stunning as it is strange, blending surreal imagery and action together perfectly. It’s what I remembered wanting from the first one, and although I did enjoy Dune: Part One a lot more this time, part two proved to be far more liberal with its oddness. I don’t want to spoil it for anyone yet to see, but some scenes (in particular the ones set on Giedi Prime) feel daring in a way that the previous entry perhaps could not quite afford to be.\n\nDune: Part Two is great. It’s certainly not without its problems. For me, the pacing is an issue, as the first two hours move very slowly and the last hour feels uncomfortably rushed. I’ve been told that this is similar in the book, but one of the good things about adapting material is that you have the power to fix such mistakes. There are a couple of deus ex-machina moments that could have been solved with some better established plot points early on, and one character in particular is disposed of in a way that felt anticlimactic. Those are fairly minor gripes, though, because almost every other aspect of the film is impeccably done and takes some admirable risks for a huge-budget production like this.\n\nThe day before writing this, I finally got around to watching the four hour epic Lawrence of Arabia, and couldn’t help but notice the similarities. For one, it’s full of incredible shots of the desert, but it also tackles the ‘white saviour’ trope in a way I didn’t expect, as well as colonialist ideas in general; something that Dune does too. ‘I bet this was a big inspiration for Villeneuve’s Dune’ I said whilst watching it, and then I watched a YouTube video about inspirations for Villeneuve’s Dune, and sure enough it was the first one he mentioned. In fact, Villeneuve says that the story of Lawrence of Arabia and the real life events that it was based on were an inspiration for Frank Herbert himself, and I believe Villeneuve because he has a lovely voice. I also finally watched David Lynch’s 1984 version of Dune, which I had been saving until after part two, and which sadly lived up (or down) to its reputation as a failure. It’s so set on exposition that it seems they had neither the time nor the energy to put anything else into it, although it does have a very creepy depiction of an evil toddler that Villeneuve was clearly too cowardly to attempt. The small role that the character of Alia plays in Dune: Part Two was fun, but it’s probably the one element that Lynch’s version actually did better.\n\nMore importantly than anything on screen in the Dune double bill, though, were the small particles of virus making their way through the cinema, for one among the audience was surely host to a sickness that would, much like the invading armies of the film, storm their way onto Arrakis (my body) and colonise everything in sight (make me feel poorly). From Saturday night until the next Monday I mostly lay in bed coughing pathetically, all the time in the world at my fingertips to watch more movies, and yet mostly too ill to pay attention to them. It was like that episode of The Twilight Zone where the guy has all the books in the world to read in the apocalypse but he steps on his glasses and breaks them. Now, if that were me, I would have just gone to an abandoned opticians and got a new pair, but I’m sure that guy couldn’t do that for some reason. I haven’t actually seen it. I had the opportunity once, but I broke my glasses by stepping on them. That didn’t happen, sorry.\n\nIn my diseased stupor, I did manage to watch a few movies (I know, braver than the troops), but they usually took me a long time to watch because I kept pausing them to take naps or just go ‘ugghhhhhh’. Some of these movies were Francis Ford Coppola’s Godfather trilogy. I’d seen the first two before, probably quite a few times by now, but I’d always avoided the third one because, like Lynch’s Dune, it had a poor reputation. After finally getting around to it after recapping the other two, I unfortunately understand why. It isn’t a bad film, but compared to the masterpieces before it there is no contest. Al Pacino’s performance is really the one redeeming feature, but then again I would say that, because I am Al Pacino’s number one fan. Actually, his number one fan probably watched The Godfather Part III years ago, and has masks of his face and has had several restraining orders taken out against them. Let’s just say I like Al Pacino a lot instead.\n\nI’m not really going to say anything about 1974’s The Godfather Part II because there’s almost nothing new I could possibly say about it. It takes place on the planet Arrakis, where the Corleone family have been sent by the emperor to mine money from the casinos. Unfortunately, Doctor Fredo Yueh has betrayed his family to the Baron Roth on Florida Prime, and… hey, are these actually the same movie? The answer is no, but I’m sure even more bizarre comparisons have been made, because that’s how much people have talked about The Godfather Part II. That’s why I want to focus on one part of it and only one part of it, because it’s something I have an interest in both personally and as a subject for fiction, and that’s being trapped.\n\nThroughout his portions of the film, Michael Corleone, now head of his family, is backed into corner after corner. His position of power has made him a target for others, but it has also changed him as a person. He has become more ruthless, crueller and more paranoid because of the pressures around him, breaking his promises to Kay and to himself. As much as he is the king of his world he is a prisoner, forced to follow a path that spirals deeper into the abyss that he swore he would never set foot in. In The Godfather, Brando’s Vito Corleone is devastated to learn that, in his absence, Michael has become involved in the criminal side of the family. Neither Michael nor his father wanted to follow that path, but even when he assumes power, the son assures his wife that ‘in five years the family will be completely legitimate’. In Part II, Kay makes reference to this statement, and we learn that it was in fact seven years ago, and things are not changing.\n\nIn Lawrence of Arabia, when T.E. Lawrence is given sudden, terrible power, he goes a little bit mad, by which I mean a lot mad. In Dune, Paul — spoiler alert, I suppose — becomes colder and greedier for power with every step towards success. In Ponyo… no, actually, Ponyo handles it pretty well. Michael Corleone, however, despite becoming more wrathful and paranoid as previously mentioned, is defined in his monarchy by something very specific; his melancholy. Pacino spends a lot of The Godfather Part II sitting around with an empty, sad look in his eyes, as if the horrors of his reality have been slowly hollowing him out from the centre. Most tyrants, at least in stories, seem blind to their own tyranny, excited so by their power that they lose all sense of morality or reality, but Michael’s curse is that he never does. The terrible things that he is forced to do seem as clear as day to him, but inevitable. By the time he — okay, really spoiler alert — has Fredo killed, he is like a ghost at the window, watching with a helplessness as present as his mercilessness. It is as if these terrible choices are no longer choices, but grim inevitabilities for which he is only a middle man. The optimism he once had, the idea that he could change things, is abandoned entirely. Michael is crushed under the weight of a world that, either through his own temptations or some actual fate, will clearly never release its grip.\n\nI’ll say this right now: I am not a mafia boss. Feels good to get off my chest. I have, however, felt those feelings many times, and likely will again. Things feel inescapable and for many of us there seems no way out. In Kiroshi Kurosawa’s 2008 film Tokyo Sonata, another I watched recently, a family breaks apart against the pressures of modern life. A man loses his job and pretends it hasn’t happened, whilst his wife pretends the monotony of her life is bearable and their sons seek escape elsewhere. The reality of their situation is financially difficult, but it isn’t money that breaks them. It’s the need for money, or really the need for anything at all. It’s the day-in, day-out demand from modern life to fill our days with tasks and owe things to one another that drives each member of the family (and others, we increasingly find) to a breakdown. Kurosawa is most famous for his horror films, like Pulse and Cure, but in this case the terror comes from ordinary life. It is a theme that I am finding increasingly prevalent in the art I consume, perhaps because I feel it so strongly myself.\n\nBeing ill is pretty isolating, so maybe themes of powerlessness are resonating with me more than usual, but it’s something that I feel comforted by as a theme despite its negativity. I’m a little uncomfortable writing about it, because it’s scary to admit that I feel afraid a lot of the time, but it’s clear that the people making these things do too, and that helps. If you feel afraid a lot of the time, I hope it helps you too. I mentioned in another one of these — maybe the first one — that I wanted to try making a film of my own at some point soon, and I still do. In fact, a big theme of that film would be fear in the face of existential pressure, but ironically I think I’m still too scared to try making it at the moment. Making a film involves approaching other human beings with ideas that I have, and that terrifies me more than the great sand worms of Arrakis. Mostly because they aren’t real, though. If they were real I would be terrified all the time.\n\nOkay, now that I’m done being weirdly vulnerable on my silly little movie review thing, let’s do the honourable mentions and hustle on out of here. Normally I do three, but since it’s been two weeks, I’ll do a few more.\n\nDa 5 Bloods (2020, Spike Lee)\n\nI loved this. Spike Lee’s film is at times warm and funny and at other times horrifically confronting. The real showstopper here though is Delroy Lindo’s (pictured above) performance as Paul. The character is extremely wounded, defensive to the point of being villainous and unable to escape the hurt he has seen and experienced. It is quite possibly one of the best performances I have ever seen on film.\n\nLinda Linda Linda (2005, Nobuhiro Yamashita)\n\nSuch a fun and sweet film about (female) friendship. Obviously I watched this for Bae Doona, who is fantastic as always. I don’t have much to say about this other than I think you’ll love it. Plus the song will be stuck in your head forever.\n\nThe Insider (1999, Michael Mann)\n\nAnother one that blew me away. I’m a big fan of Mann’s Heat, and this felt like a quieter companion piece in some ways. Not since The Conversation have I seen a paranoid thriller that leans quite so expertly on the ‘paranoid’. Al Pacino is, you guessed it, great, but Christopher Plummer steals his scenes like a master thief.\n\nRing (1998, Hideo Nakata)\n\nMany years ago I watched the American remake, and foolishly I thought that the original would be basically the same; a fairly generic mainstream horror movie based on jumpscares. I may be unfavourably misremembering the remake, but either way, this film is not that. It’s scary, sure, but what hit me is how incredibly thoughtfully shot this is. Every frame looks so carefully designed, and the ultra-eerie soundtrack provides so much of the atmosphere.\n\nAffliction (1997, Paul Schrader)\n\nPaul Schrader gets mocked for his repeating theme of Troubled Male Loner With Violent Desires (for other things, too), but to say he doesn’t do it well would be a lie. Nolte’s portrayal of a man unable to shake the deep anger and pain within him is fascinating, and James Coburn is deliciously detestable as his father.\n\nLegendary Weapons of China (1982, Lau Kar-Leung)\n\nA very lively film that confused the hell out of me. I had to watch the first five minutes three times and then the first twenty minutes twice, and only then did I have some grasp on what was happening. The good news is I rewatched it happily, because it’s incredible fun. A stacked cast and a compelling, if puzzling, gang of characters.\n\nI’m done now, I promise. Sorry for getting weird earlier. Bye."
