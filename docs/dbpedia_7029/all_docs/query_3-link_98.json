        "text": "What makes a family “family,” is depended on the sacrifices you’re willing to make, even if it means death. As cheesy as it sounds, this is what I perceived the message to be in The Godfather: Part II by Francis Ford Coppola, but in the Cinema, the main protagonist Michael Corleone loses what matters the most to him, Family. You get to see him and his household collapse due to his obsession of the family business and you get to view this through great angles this flick has produced. The sequel overall satisfied me for it’s rich content and met up to the standards of the original movie. All in all, I enjoyed the film for its aspects of crime, violence and drama behind it. The Godfather: Part II involves two storylines with one dealing with the current events of Michael Corleone; the other dealing with the past life of his father, Vito …show more content…\n\nOther than that, I agreed on one of quotes stating how the parallel storylines of Vito and Michael Corleone should’ve been two separate films. “To be sure, the life of young Vito helps to explain the forming of the adult Don Corleone, and to establish in the film the Sicilian code of omerta. As Michael changes, we see why he feels that he must. He must play the game by its rules. But I am not sure the flashbacks strengthen the film. I would have appreciated separate films about young Vito and the evolution of Michael” (Erbert). With what I said earlier in my paper, I felt like the flashback scenes of Vito Corleone felt unnecessary because of how it didn’t effect the main story plot a whole lot and kind of built a confusing path in the film at first. If the producers were to do what Erbert said, then they would be able to generate a large amounts of profit off two different films. One dealing with the prologue of Vito Corleone and the other dealing with the growth of Michael Corleone in the crime"
