        "text": "An offer you can’t refuse:\n\nIn celebration of the 45th anniversary of “The Godfather Part II,” Turner Classic Movies and Fathom Events brings the iconic film back to 600 select theaters on Nov. 10, 12 and 13.\n\nIn what is undeniably one of the best sequels ever made, Francis Ford Coppola continues his epic Godfather trilogy with this saga of two generations of power within the Corleone family.\n\nCoppola, working once again with the author Mario Puzo, crafts two interwoven stories that work as both prequel and sequel to the original. One shows the humble Sicilian beginnings and New York rise of a young Don Vito, played by Robert De Niro in an Oscar-winning performance for Best Supporting Actor. The other shows the ascent of Michael (Al Pacino) as the new don protecting the family business in the aftermath of an attempt on his life.\n\nCoppola reassembled many of the cast members who helped make “The Godfather” including Robert Duvall, Diane Keaton, John Cazale and Talia Shire. Marlon Brando was scheduled to be in one scene but did not show up for filming. The film ended up receiving 11 Academy Awards nominations, winning six including Best Picture of 1974.\n\nA timeless classic best revered on the big screen, time tested fans and newcomers alike won’t want to miss this special event featuring exclusive insight from TCM Primetime host Ben Mankiewicz before and after the 3-hour, 22-minute film. This event includes a five minute intermission.\n\nParticipating theaters in our neck of the woods include AMC Loews Stony Brook 17, 2196 Nesconset Highway, Stony Brook on Nov. 10 at 3 and 7 p.m. and Nov. 12 and 13 at 7 p.m.; Farmingdale Multiplex Cinemas, 1001 Broadhollow Road, Farmingdale on Nov. 13 at 7 p.m.; and Island 16 Cinema de Lux, 185 Morris Ave., Holtsville on Nov. 13 at 7 p.m. To purchase your ticket in advance, visit www.fathomevents.com."
