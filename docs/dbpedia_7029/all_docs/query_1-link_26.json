        "text": "AMC Becomes Exclusive Basic Cable Television Home to THE GODFATHER Trilogy in First-of-its-Kind Long Term Deal\n\nInvestment in Movie Library Underscores AMC’s Commitment of Delivering Premium Television on Basic Cable\n\nNew York, NY – September 7, 2010 – In a move that further solidifies its offering of premium television on basic cable, AMC announced today it has obtained exclusive U.S. cable rights from Paramount Pictures to The Godfather (1972), The Godfather: Part II (1974) and The Godfather: Part III (1990) for the next nine years, beginning January 2011 through December 2019. The groundbreaking deal marks the longest term ever licensed for the award-winning franchise. This latest investment underscores AMC’s commitment to bringing viewers the best in visual storytelling, whether through the most celebrated movies of all time or the network’s critically-acclaimed and award-winning original series.\n\nThe Godfather premiered in movie theaters in 1972 and was followed by the sequel two years later in 1974. Both films went on to win the Oscar® for Best Picture. The third installment premiered in 1990. All three were directed by Francis Ford Coppola and won a combined nine Oscars® with 19 nominations.\n\n\"The Godfather is recognized as one of the greatest sagas ever told on film,\" said Tom Halleen, AMC’s Senior Vice President of programming and scheduling. \"AMC is proud to be the exclusive long-term basic cable home to this incredible franchise for the next decade. The Godfather acquisition, as well as our ongoing commitment to quality original series, underscores AMC’s promise to provide the best stories on television. The latest investment further represents AMC’s commitment to continually expand its extensive movie library.\"\n\n\"We are very pleased to have concluded this arrangement with AMC,\" said Hal Richardson, President of Paramount Worldwide Television Distribution. \"We believe this is a terrific programming match. AMC’s motion picture programming continues to embody the finest movies in cinema history and we are thrilled The Godfather pictures, one of the most beloved series of movies ever made, have been added to their motion picture line-up to be enjoyed by television audiences for many years to come.\"\n\nAMC’s license includes on-air and on-demand rights to The Godfather (1972), The Godfather: Part II (1974), and The Godfather: Part III (1990). Also included is The Godfather: The Complete Novel for Television (1977), the nine-hour chronological re-edit of the first two installations, as well as additional documentaries and behind-the-scenes footage from Paramount’s vaults.\n\nThe Godfather stars Marlon Brando, Al Pacino, Robert Duvall, James Caan, Diane Keaton and Talia Shire. The film was Francis Ford Coppola’s epic masterpiece that features Marlon Brando as the patriarch of the Corleone family in his Oscar®-winning role for Best Actor at the 1972 Academy Awards®. Director Coppola paints a chilling portrait of the Sicilian clan’s rise and near fall from power in America, masterfully balancing the story between the Corleone’s family life and the ugly crime business in which they are engaged. Based on Mario Puzo’s best-selling novel and featuring career-making performances by Al Pacino, James Caan and Robert Duvall, this searing and brilliant film garnered ten Academy Award® nominations, and won three including Best Picture of 1972.\n\nThe Godfather II is a brilliant companion piece to the original that continues the saga of two generations of successive power within the Corleone family. Coppola tells two stories in Part II: the roots and rise of a young Don Corleone, played with uncanny ability by Robert De Niro, and the ascension of Michael (Al Pacino) as the new Don. Reassembling many of the talents who helped make The Godfather, Coppola has produced a movie of staggering magnitude and vision, and undeniably the best sequel ever made. Robert De Niro won an Oscar® for Best Supporting Actor and the film received six Academy Awards®, including Best Picture of 1974.\n\nIn the third film, The Godfather III, Al Pacino reprises the role of powerful family leader Michael Corleone. Now in his 60’s, Michael is dominated by two passions: freeing his family from crime and finding a suitable successor. That successor could be fiery Vincent (Andy Garcia) but he may also be the spark that turns Michael’s hope of business legitimacy into an inferno of mob violence.\n\nAbout AMC\n\nAMC reigns as the only network to ever win the Golden Globe® Award for Best Television Series – Drama three years in a row and the only basic cable network to win back-to-back Primetime Emmy® Awards for Outstanding Drama Series.
