        "text": "Hollywood's veteran star and acting icon, Robert De Niro, has given many stupendous performances in his career spanning several decades. However, the one that I cannot help but go back to is one of his first major breakout roles in Francis Ford Coppola's acclaimed blockbuster, 'The Godfather Part II' (1974).\n\nROBERT DE NIRO AS A YOUNG VITO CORLEONE\n\nOne of the most memorable moments that featured De Niro as a young mafia king in the making was when Vito Coreleone, in his confidence and youth, approaches a ring leader and negotiates with him. His friends are aghast, but in quick and fluent Sicilian, he convinces them that what he is trying to do will help them in the long run. All he asks in return is that they remember they 'owe him one.'\n\nadvertisement\n\nThis trait of dealing in negotiations was grounded in the first part of 'The Godfather', where we saw Marlon Brando's version of an aged Vito carry out these dealings in private, at his spacious mansion.\n\nTo get into the skin of the character, De Niro spent months learning the Sicilian dialect and even spent some time in a village where the language was spoken prominently, as per IMDb. But did you know, that at first when he was approached to be a part of the first film, he wanted to play James Caan's Sonny Corleone, but Coppola was keen to cast Caan in the role. He was then offered another part, of Paulie Gatto, but he turned it down to be a part of the film, The Gang That Couldn't Shoot Straight.\n\nDE NIRO'S FIRST MEGA HIT\n\nIn an earlier interview, while speaking to CNN, De Niro said, “Godfather was the first that I remember, movie, that was like a big blockbuster. Then came other movies. I might have this wrong, like some of the Spielberg films and so on, but when [‘The Godfather: Part II’] came, I said this might be a good chance that it’ll be a success.”\n\nMade on a reported budget of 13 million dollars, 'The Godfather II' minted 93 million dollars globally.\n\nWith a screenplay authored by Mario Puzo and Francis Ford Coppola, the film is available to stream on Netflix and Prime Video."
