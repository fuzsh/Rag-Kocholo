        "text": "What is there left to say that hasn't already been said about the Godfather films? Words like classic, epic and iconic come to mind. Francis Ford Coppola's definitive American gangster saga will always have its place in the annals of film history. Maybe that's why the director can't seem to leave it alone. Since the release of the first sequel, the films have been in and out of the editing room, resulting in so many different versions it's hard keeping track of them all. For those who have never gotten around to watching the films (and, seriously, get to it already), or may have forgotten all the gory details, here's a brief synopsis. Based on the bestselling book by Mario Puzo, The Godfather is the story of an Italian mafia family run by Don Vito Corleone (infamously portrayed by Marlon Brando). Vito has three sons -- Sonny (James Caan), Fredo (John Cazale) and Michael (Al Pacino) -- and a daughter, Connie (Talia Shire). Sonny is the hothead, Fredo is the dim-witted screw-up and Michael is the prodigal son. Connie is mainly just a pain in the ass. There's also Tom Hagen (Robert Duvall), Vito's loyal foster son, who is a lawyer and the family's closest adviser, or consigliere.\n\nWhen Vito refuses to join the other mafia families in the emerging drug trafficking business, he becomes a target for an attempted assassination. The plot fails, but it sets off a bloody gang war as Vito's sons take out their revenge. Although Michael was the one son with a chance of escaping the mafia lifestyle, it turns out that he is also the only one who can carry on the family business. After a sabbatical in Sicily, Michael returns and ultimately takes over as Don, becoming everything he detests for the sake of maintaining the family name.\n\nThe second film is the rare sequel that improves upon the original. Back in 1974, non-linear storytelling wasn't quite as common as it is today, so it took the public and the film community some time to truly appreciate The Godfather II for the masterpiece that it is. The film employs a dual narrative that switches back and forth in time, chronicling the rise of young Vito Corleone (played by the incomparable Robert DeNiro) and the fall of Michael (Pacino, once again turning in a mesmerizing performance). If the first film could be considered to glorify violence and organized crime, this one shows the consequences of that life. It also serves as a thinly veiled metaphor for American capitalism and its destructive effect on family, cultural heritage, community identity and morality.\n\nCLICK HERE to read the full The Godfather Trilogy review by Cindy White.\n\nScore: 10 out of 10\n\nVideo and Presentation\n\nThe Godfather Part II is presented in 1.85:1 widescreen using the AVC MPEG-4 codec on a dual-layered BD50 disc. The film itself consumes a staggering 44.4 gigs of disc space. This transfer appears to be the same one used for the Coppola Restoration. When these titles previously came to DVD, I was shocked by how bad they looked. The results of the 2008 restoration are simply amazing. I never witnessed the first and second films in theaters, but from what I've heard from friends and family who have, this presentation tops the original theatrical showing.\n\nColors are intentionally saturated and orange giving the film a distinctly organic 1950s look. Black levels are very rich and deep (occasionally bleeding) which adds some allure of the picture. Depth and clarity is somewhat crushed, but again, the deep blacks sink into the screen -- an intentional creative look. None of these visual elements make for a reference Blu-ray disc, but the print itself is most certainly reference.\n\nThe transfer is virtually spotless, without a hint of dust or digital artifacting. There is a slight hint of grain, but it's meant to be there to give the film some texture. Fans will undoubtedly be pleased by this remarkable restoration. Hopefully Paramount will do an equally great restoration on Blu-ray for Francis Ford Coppola's other epic, Apocalypse Now.\n\nScore: 9 out of 10\n\nLanguages and Audio\n\nAudio choices are English 5.1 TrueHD Audio, English Mono, Spanish and French Dolby Digital 5.1 with Spanish, English, Portuguese and French subtitles and English captions for the hearing impaired. Before you get your hopes up, let it be known that none of the Godfather films has ever really sounded that great. That said, this high-res upgrade (the same track used in the Coppola Restoration) doesn't really add much punch to the second film. The film sounds somewhat flat and hollow -- a fault of the time. Surround effects are minimal, but effective. The score is evenly mixed between the front and rear surrounds and dialogue is clean and crisp if somewhat crackly and tonally flat. LFE are sparse, but again, effective when need-be.\n\nI did a quick comparison to my original DVD and found some notable differences in fidelity and clarity, but more often than not, the track sounded mostly the same. Still, this is a significant improvement over the original theatrical mono presentation. The mix should please most die hard fans, and if it doesn't, the film's original mono track is available.\n\nScore: 7 out of 10\n\nExtras and Packaging\n\nThis single-disc BD comes packed in a blue elite case with a glossy slipcover. The Godfather series is now a member of Paramount's select \"Sapphire Series.\" To be honest though, this release seems more like a cheap way for economically troubled studio to release a catalog title without having to do anything new, other than change around the design somewhat.\n\nThe only extra from the 2008 Coppola Restoration that's been ported over here is the original director's commentary featuring Francis Ford Coppola. He's certainly informative, but factoring the three hour running time of the film, this track can grow tedious and tiresome, particularly if you've read up on the film in the past. Still, Coppola's obvious excitement over the picture is palpable, drawing away from the tedious nature of the commentary. If you love the film, you will mostly enjoy this track.\n\nScore: 2 out of 10\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nThe Godfather Part II is a classic in every imaginable way, but so are the other two films in the series (less-so with the third chapter), so skip this release and buy the Coppola Restoration instead."
