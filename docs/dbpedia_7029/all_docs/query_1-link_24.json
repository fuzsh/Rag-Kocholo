        "text": "There’s a dark joke running all the way through The Godfather, Part II: this family, the Corleones, that had always put family above all else is now a family destroying itself from the inside. Make it two jokes, because there’s another one, too: no matter how extraordinary a film, the sequel can always be better. These two uniquely profound — and profoundly unique — truths are what give Part II its unassailably singular character.\n\nWhat gives it its unique shape is its partitioned structure, with episodes alternating between Vito Corleone’s (Robert DeNiro) moving to America and establishing the family in New York, and Michael Corleone’s (Al Pacino’s) destruction of the family through ego and avarice. This makes the movie both prequel and sequel to The Godfather (1972). For the sheer excellence of its filmmaking as it compounds the value of an existing franchise, it’s unlike anything else in film history, even The Empire Strikes Back (1980).\n\nPeople weren’t calling them franchises back then, and the sequel was a foreign concept. To hear Francis Ford Coppola tell it, when he was brought on to direct the second film after having directed the first, Paramount Pictures chafed hard against his insistence on reprising the Godfather name accompanied by a numeral. Coppola fancies himself a pioneer of what before long became a dubious trend. Years later, when he wanted to call the third Godfather film The Death of Michael Corleone, Coppola had the strange sensation of finding himself on the other side of an argument he’d previously won — and losing.\n\nPrequels — by that name or any other — were also not a prominent part of pop culture. The script that Coppola wrote with Mario Puzo, author of the original novel, is beyond influential when considered in this light. And it’s the prequel element of Part II that gives it its gravity and its grace. There are logistical problems, however, in making a good prequel — reverse-engineering a story to recreate its beginnings — and the problems with Part II started when it came time to find the right actor to play Vito Corleone.\n\nIt’s also where the problems ended. They got lucky that way. It’s not pleasant to imagine what the movie would have looked like without De Niro — what it would have looked and felt and sounded like. It almost came off in a totally different way. De Niro was originally considered for the role of Michael, back when they were casting the first movie, but the studio wanted somebody bigger, so Coppola tested him for Sonny instead. He didn’t get that role either, of course, or the role of Connie’s husband, for which he was also considered. He almost got the job of Pete Clemenza, whereupon he would have gone down in Godfather lore as the one who said, “Leave the gun, take the cannoli” (or not, if it’s true that the line was improvised). But because of contractual complications, he didn’t get that role either. It’s almost as if fate were saving him for the Godfather part he was truly destined to play.\n\nBy the time Coppola came to offer De Niro the role of young Vito, it had been “rolling around in my head that in a funny way De Niro’s face reminded me of Vito Corleone,” Coppola remembered. “Not of Brando, but of the character he played, with the accentuated jaw, the kind of funny smile. De Niro certainly is believable as being someone in the Corleone family and possibly Al’s father.”\n\nDe Niro’s presence is felt all throughout Part II, even with very little screen time and very few speaking parts. His biographer Shawn Levy has crunched the numbers: 47 minutes on screen, 122 sentences spoken,\n\nmany of them fragmentary, and most of them in the demotic Sicilian that De Niro had mastered, often paring away at his lines to achieve a more credible semblance of the silence and cunning of the mature character. Brando spoke in fluent, flowery English, but De Niro’s Vito Corleone has put but seven lines in his adopted language, forty-two words in all, many of them muttered, all of them heavily accented. The powerful impact he imparts comes not from his tongue but, indeed, from his entire being.\n\nTo learn Sicilian he’d enrolled in the Berlitz school, then worked with a private tutor supplied by the studio, then traveled to Sicily, to the village of Corleone itself, and learned from the locals how his lines would be spoken in their most specifically native environment. “If you’d asked me if it was possible,” remembered his tutor, Romano Pianti, “that an actor master a language like Sicilian in such a short time, I would have said, ‘Never. Impossible.’ But this De Niro has done it.” He was even able to rewrite some of them Sicilian in the script, for his own role and others’, “sometimes emphasizing little idioms and tics of pronunciation,” writes Levy, “sometimes ratcheting back speeches that he felt, after his exposure to the manners of Sicilians, were too forthright and direct.”\n\nThen there was that other language — body language. He pored over Puzo’s novel and Caoppola’s script like Talmudic texts, scribbling notes to himself like “NEVER LET ANYONE KNOW THINKING. ALWAYS KEEP [OTHERS] OFF GUARD. BE DOING ONE THING WHILE THINKING ANOTHER” and “give smile with mouth, not with eyes. Chilling smile.” He attentively screened Brando’s performance in the first movie and made careful notes on how he’d carried himself: “lead a little with shoulders…head cocked…when thinking hand to chin…sly smile, sense of humor…raised eyebrows when making certain deliberate expressions…use back of fingers to scratch face…when point lift only forearm when want something…maybe should do more of chin sticking out. Esp. for smiling…Big thing is he is relaxed talker…Lets things happen. Let things happen.”\n\nReading these notes, you feel you’ve been presented with nothing less than the distilled physical-aural essence of Vito Corleone.\n\nCoppola and cinematographer Gordon Willis had quarreled terribly when making the first movie together, and Willis declared then that he would never work with Coppola again. But when Coppola got the offer to direct Part II, he realized he needed Willis’s touch or else the two movies just wouldn’t match — they wouldn’t look right as a pair — and he was able to convince Willis to come back.\n\nOne thing they’d fought about was Coppola’s insistence that actors not be tethered to their marks but made free to roam in and out of the frame of a stationary camera that takes in the entire section of a room — the desk area of Michael’s office, for instance. Something in Willis repelled at the notion of working this way, and once he ended up storming off set, while Coppola put his fist through a door. It was like that. Say what you will, though: Coppola has remained consistent over the years in his fondness for this volatile approach, extolling it in the commentary track to the most recent reissue.\n\nBut it’s easy to see why — in spite of the obstacles Willis tried to put between Coppola and his vision’s realization — the latter would be determined to have the former onboard once again. The filters, the shallow depth of field, the patience of the camera, the particular color palette, the top lighting — these all contributed to the Godfather aesthetic, and it could not just be taken for granted that these elements would remain consistent, that you could simply plug another cinematographer into Willis’s place and have everything still glow the same.\n\nAnd Willis delivered, creating not just a companion piece but a striking visual achievement in its own right. Turn-of-the-century Sicily and New York, of course, are what distinguish Part II visually from its predecessor, as well as the Lake Tahoe scenes of the present day. Filmed in winter, we see how ice has begun to bury Michael’s son’s bicycle and other accoutrements of family life. When Michael is indoors with Fredo, before the big picture window giving out onto snowy Tahoe, he has murder on his mind — murder for his own brother — and although the lips he kisses him with aren’t telling the story, the chilly vista beyond tells us everything we need to know about the chill that’s come over Michael’s soul.\n\nWe should be careful, however, not to give too much credit to Willis for the movie’s mise-en-scene. The truth is, Coppola had a very strong, lucid vision for what he wanted to exist within Willis’s frames, and he made sure to put it there. It may have been Willis who shot the snow so beautifully, but without Coppola’s concept of how to suggest Michael’s ice-encrusted soul, it wouldn’t exist at all. The same applies to what Coppola called “the many repeated visual sequences between the two pictures,” going so far as to suggest that every scene in Part II has a parallel in its predecessor. We see these parallels from the beginning, when the New York wedding of The Godfather is, in Part II, a First Communion party in Reno, except that now the cops in the parking lot are receiving champagne rather than photographing license plates, so legitimate and prosperous has the Corleone clan become. The bright, resplendent festivities outside are once again offset by the nefarious deals simultaneously being cut in the caverns of Corleone’s office — Michael, of course, instead of Vito this time. There are examples of this kind of thing all throughout.\n\nThen you’ve got Coppola’s (none-too-subtle) allusions to capitalism — which he’s always insisted is the real, secret subject of the Godfather movies — and his (altogether-more-subtle) symbolic use of oranges. One could hardly be more comprehensive on the subject of these “dangerous oranges” than The Film Spectrum’s Jason Fraley, who coined the term for these signals of imminent danger:\n\nThe Don kicks over a basket of oranges when he’s attacked by Sollozzo’s men. Fanucci tosses an orange during his final stroll through Little Italy. Clemenza grabs a pitcher of wine with floating oranges as he tells Paulie to go do his job, then later kills Paulie for not doing his job. Tessio reaches across Mama Corleone to grab an orange during the wedding, literally crossing the Corleone Family, which later has him killed.\n\nJohnny Ola brings an orange to Michael, who seems hip to the motif and flips it, saying Johnny and his men look hungry — then killing them. There’s a bowl of oranges on the table when Woltz turns down Johnny’s role in the film, leading to the famous horse head scene. A bowl of oranges also sits on the table during the meeting of the Five Familes, where the Don literally reaches out to shield the oranges between he and Barzini as he stands up to make the peace. Finally, the Don puts orange pieces in his mouth to scare his grandson just moments before he drops dead in the garden.\n\nIt started out as an unintentional thing, these ominous appearances of oranges, but eventually, Coppola remembered, “the orange…began to emerge as some sort of a symbol — having actors eating oranges and stuff. We knew the orange was mythic. Although it started accidentally, by this point we understood there was some significance.” Coppola makes this comment three hours into the commentary track for Part II, during a scene that didn’t even make The Film Spectrum’s rundown. He goes on to reckon that the orange had significance among Sicilians in America as a fruit that prompted memories, both good and bad, of the old country — a kind of talismanic memento. Whatever the case, whenever you take in all this — or some of the other (voluminous) oranges-in-The Godfather commentary — the ominous orange glow of Willis’s cinematography becomes something by which you see things in an even more ominous new light.\n\nWhen the film came out, many critics — even some of the very best — had a problem with Part II’s twinned structure, saying that each thread of the story pulled something away from the other. Now, of course, it’s generally understood that the two strands strengthen each other, as we see the sins of the son and the virtues of the father inhabiting the same filmic space. This had been something like Coppola’s intention all along. Back, even, before he’d begun thinking about a second Godfather, it was his idea to tell the stories of a father and a son, and to tell them back-to-back, as companion pieces. It just so happened that in the Godfather franchise is where he found the means of doing so.\n\nIt’s genuinely thrilling to see how young Vito became the Don, doing so by sheer wits and strength of character. The revenge he takes on Fanucci is a patient revenge, externally cool even as it burns furiously within. His refusal to be bullied, even as he’s desperate to provide for his family, and then the power he leverages as a result of it all — it’s a hell of an origin story, and there’s no properly respecting the Don of the first movie without understanding how he first wrested power to attain the title.\n\nDe Niro-as-Vito isn’t the only bit of krazy kasting to be found in Part II. You’ve also got Lee Strasberg, the Father of Method Acting, who for so many years presided over the Actors Studio, mentoring seemingly all the great talents to come out of mid-century New York theater, up to and including Marlon Brando and Al Pacino. Having him here as Hyman Roth is a plump, bright Easter egg, easy for the plucking, as he exudes and evokes, emotes and emits, all by the simple application of his famed sense-memory technique.\n\nIn the prequel strand of the movie, we get to see the young Clemenza (Bruno Kirby), but there is no Clemenza in the sequel strand. According to Coppola, Richard Castellano — Clemenza in the first movie — asked for too much money, and even insisted on writing his own dialogue. Castellano tells the story somewhat differently, but whatever the case, it was all too much for Coppola, who instead simply had the character killed, thereby providing another perfect Easter egg, about the dire fate that befalls those who stand too stubbornly in their negotiations.\n\nFurther discussion of Godfather casting will have to wait for an essay about the first movie — the movie that Stanley Kubrick, for one, considered the best-cast movie of all time. That movie’s cast was at least equaled by Part II’s, even without the participation of Marlon Brando.\n\nAbout that. Coppola needed Brando for the coda, that final-scene flashback of the family gathered at dinner as young Michael tells of his intentions to join the Army. When Brando, pissed at Paramount over what he considered ill treatment on the first picture, refused to participate, Coppola had just the workaround, portraying the Don’s absence from his own birthday party as an unexpected bit of family business — and, indeed, his physical absence does somehow seem to enhance his spiritual presence.\n\nBut that’s not what I want to talk about. I want to talk about Michael, and how his decision to serve in the war, against his whole family’s objections, is seen as proof of his fundamental virtue — virtue that of course has been corrupted by the end of the picture we just saw. This is how everybody seems to interpret the scene, but I’d like to suggest an alternate interpretation, one that I’ve not seen in all the critical analysis I’ve read of this movie. What if the scene’s really trying to show that Michael has always been a fighter, even when the imperative to fight is not necessarily imminent — that he’s really a killer at heart, that he has the need to kill, and that this need will find expression however it can, whether it’s in his own self-interest or not, never mind the interests of his family."
