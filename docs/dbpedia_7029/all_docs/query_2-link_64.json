        "text": "A sequel equal if not superior to its predecessor, scripted as a two-tiered journey into the Corleone family’s origin story and the heart of darkness that consumes heir Michael (an iconic Al Pacino). Six Academy Awards, including Best Picture, Director, and Supporting Actor (Robert De Niro) resulted. For Kael it “enlarges the scope and deepens the meaning of the first… It’s an epic vision of the corruption of America.”"
