        "text": "Regent University is a private Christian research university located in Virginia Beach, Virginia, United States. The university was founded by Dr. M.G. \"Pat\" Robertson in 1977 as Christian Broadcasting Network University, and changed its name to Regent University in 1990. A satellite campus located in Alexandria, Virginia, was sold in 2008. Regent offers an extensive distance education program in addition to its traditional on-campus programs. Through its eight academic schools, Regent offers associate's, bachelor's, master's, and doctoral degrees in over 70 courses of study. Regent University is accredited by the Commission on Colleges of the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools, and additionally accredited by CHEA (School of Education), ABA (School of Law), CACREP and CoA (School of Psychology and Counseling), TEAC (School of Education), ACBSP and ASEL (School of Business and Leadership), ATS (School of Divinity) and is a member of NASPAA (Robertson School of Government).\n\nHistory\n\nPlans for the university (originally named CBN University) began in 1978 by Christian Broadcasting Network founder and current Chancellor Pat Robertson. In 1990, the name was changed to Regent University. The university's name is designed to reference a regent, a person who exercises power in a monarchical country during the absence or incapacity of the sovereign; according to the school's catalog, \"a regent is one who represents Christ, our Sovereign, in whatever sphere of life he or she may be called to serve Him.\" The university's current motto is \"Christian Leadership to Change the World.\"\n\nThe first class, consisting of seventy-seven students, began in fall of 1978 when the school leased classroom space in Chesapeake, Virginia. The first students were all enrolled in what is now the School of Communication & the Arts. In May 1980, the first graduating class held its commencement, while the School of Education opened the following October. Simultaneously, the university took residence for the first time on its current campus in Virginia Beach, Virginia. The school proceeded to open its Schools of Business, Divinity, Government, and Law by the mid-1980s. In 1984, Regent University received accreditation from the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools. In 1997, what would later become the School of Business and Leadership piloted an online Master of Arts program, an antecedent to the university's development of online education.\n\nIn 1995, the university opened a secondary campus in Alexandria, Virginia, following an outreach program geared toward teachers in the Washington, D.C. area. This facility was later sold. In 2000, Regent began an undergraduate degree-completion curriculum under the auspices of a new program, the Center for Professional Studies. This would later become the School of Undergraduate Studies, before finally being renamed as the College of Arts and Sciences in 2012.\n\nAcademics\n\nUndergraduate Studies\n\nThe College of Arts & Sciences houses many undergraduate majors designed for traditional and distance students. Regent's College of Arts & Sciences (formerly the School of Undergraduate Studies) offers associates and bachelor's degrees in Accounting, Biblical and Theological Studies, Business, Christian Studies, Christian Ministry, Communication, Criminal Justice, English, General Studies, Government, History, Human Resource Management, International Business, Marketing, Mathematics, Organizational Leadership and Management, Psychology, and Religious Studies. Furthermore, five bachelor's programs are offered exclusively on-campus: Animation, Cinema-Television, Mathematics, Theatre and Interdisciplinary Studies (Elementary Education).\n\nGraduate Studies\n\nRobertson's original vision for Regent University was that of a graduate institution. In 2006, an undergraduate degree completion program was started, and has grown into a full-fledged undergraduate program for full-time traditional age students. Regent is now working toward developing Undergraduate Studies more fully, and it has plans to expand and extend the amount of majors it offers, as well as facilities for more students. Regent hopes to one day have about 2,000 on-campus students.\n\nSchool of Divinity\n\nThe School of Divinity offers Master's degrees in Biblical Studies, Missiology, Church Doctrine and History and the traditional seminary degree, the Master of Divinity. The School also offers the Doctor of Ministry degree along with a Ph.D in Renewal Studies with concentrations in Biblical Studies, Theology and Church History. The School of Divinity is accredited by the Association of Theological Schools in the United States and Canada (ATS).\n\nSchool of Education\n\nThe School of Education offers an undergraduate Bachelor of Science degree in addition to its Master and Ed.D. degrees in Education along with teaching certificate programs.\n\nSchool of Business & Leadership\n\nThe School of Business & Leadership provides a Ph.D. in Organizational Leadership. Additionally available is a Doctor of Strategic Leadership offering three concentrations: Strategic Leadership, Leadership Coaching, and Strategic Foresight. The school also provides Masters in Organizational Leadership, Strategic Foresight and a Master of Business Administration.\n\nSchool of Communication & the Arts\n\nThe School of Communication & the Arts offers undergraduate degress in animation, cinema-television, journalism, theatre, and communication.

The School of Communications and the Arts also offers students opportunities through the year with seasonal plays, Reel Dreams Film Festival and the OTIS Film Festival.\n\nFeature film projects\n\nIn 2014, Regent University and the School of Communication & the Arts announced a collaborative feature film project with actor, writer, and director Corbin Bernsen. The film, starring Marilu Henner, Chelsey Crisp, Joe Williamson, and Bernsen, is Jesse & Naomi, a romantic comedy loosely based on the biblical story of Ruth. The project afforded students from the School of Communication & the Arts opportunities to work alongside the cast and crew, gaining experience on the set of a feature film.\n\nRobertson School of Government\n\nThe Robertson School of Government offers a Masters of Arts in Government with specializations in Public Administration, Political Management, and Law and Public Policy among others.\n\nSchool of Law\n\nRegent University School of Law, located in Virginia Beach, Va., was established in 1988 and was accredited by the American Bar Association (ABA) in 1989, allowing students to sit for the bar examination in any jurisdiction in the nation.\n\nIts mission is to provide an excellent legal education from a Christian perspective, to nurture and encourage its students toward spiritual maturity, and to engage the world through Christian legal thought and practice.\n\nRegent Law recently celebrated its 25th anniversary with keynote speakers Supreme Court Justice Samuel Alito and former United States Attorney General John Ashcroft.\n\nThe total cost of attendance (indicating the cost of tuition, fees, and living expenses) at Regent Law for the 2014-2015 academic year is $53,310 for full-time students living on campus. The Law School Transparency estimated debt-financed cost of attendance for three years is $206,595.\n\nFaculty\n\nDistinguished faculty include former United States Attorney General John Ashcroft and Dr. Jay Sekulow, Chief Counsel for American Center for Law and Justice. John Warwick Montgomery served as distinguished professor of law from 1997 to 1999.\n\nBar Pass Rates\n\nRegent Law's first-time Virginia Bar Exam takers achieved a 100% pass rate on the February 2012 exam.\n\n2011 Regent Law graduates who took the Virginia Bar Exam had a first-time taker pass rate of 79.6%. The Virginia state average for all first-timer takers was 79.1%.\n\nRegent's 2011 nationwide first-time Bar takers (all states) passed at an average rate of 82.3%. The national average for all testers, all schools, was 79%.\n\nThe most recent first-time bar pass rates for all 2011 Regent Law graduates, all states, with corresponding LSAT breakdowns, are as follows:\n\nLSAT 150 or above 86.9%\n\nLSAT 155 or above 95.0%\n\nLSAT 160 or above 100%\n\n(the average LSAT score for the 2011 entering class was 154)\n\nThe 2010 bar passage rate for students taking the Virginia State Bar Exam was 85.7 percent, the highest Bar pass rate in the school's history. The passage rate has improved every year from at least 2001, when the Regent University pass rate was 43.9 percent, compared to the state average of 73 percent.\n\nEmployment\n\nAccording to Regent Law's official 2013 ABA-required disclosures, 58% of the Class of 2013 obtained full-time, long-term, JD-required employment nine months after graduation. Regent's Law School Transparency under-employment score is 23.2%, indicating the percentage of the Class of 2013 unemployed, pursuing an additional degree, or working in a non-professional, short-term, or part-time job nine months after graduation.\n\nCenter for Global Justice, Human Rights, and the Rule of Law\n\nRegent Law Students with a passion for the protection of human rights can gain valuable resource training along with other advocates around the world from Regent Law’s Center for Global Justice, founded in 2011.

The SBA Student Senate represents the law school’s student body to the school’s administration and the University. The Council of Graduate Students (COGS) and Regent Undergraduate Council (RUC) serve a similar function for the balance of the student population. The groups, in addition to their organizational responsibilities, hold social and religious events.\n\nStudent organizations\n\nStudent organizations at the school include the student divisions of the American Bar Association and the Virginia Trial Lawyers Association, Association of Black Psychologists, Black Law Student Association, To Write Love On Her Arms UChapter, Business Transactions Law Society, Christian Legal Society, College Republicans, Young America's Foundation (Young Americans for Freedom), Regent Democrats, Intellectual Property & Entertainment Law Society, Federalist Society, International Law Society, International Student Organization, Law Wives Association, Moot Court Board, National Law Student Association, Newman Club, Public Interest Law Association, Regent Students for Life, Students in Free Enterprise, Student Alumni Ambassadors, and The King's Knights.\n\nStudent housing\n\nRegent Village houses graduate students and graduate student families with children.

Regent's moot court program was ranked 6th in the nation in 2015.\n\nEducation and film awards\n\nAlumni of the School of Education have built a sterling reputation in the Hampton Roads area, having been awarded Hampton Roads Teacher of the Year more than 630 times. Other notable awards won by School of Education alumni include National Outstanding Principal of the Year (2012), Milken Educator Award Winner (2012), History Teacher of the Year for Virginia (2006), National Principal of the Year (2006), and National School Board Association Black Caucus's Educational Leadership Award (2005). The School of Communication & the Arts and its alumni have been the recipients of more than 360 national and international film and television awards, including wins at the Emmys, the Telly Awards, the Aurora Awards, Indie Fest, Accolade Global Film Competition, and the Virginia Independent Film Festival.\n\nIdeology\n\nIn 1995, Harvey Cox, the liberal Harvard theologian, wrote that Regent has been called \"the Harvard of the Christian Right\" but noted that \"Regent, it appears, is not so much a boot camp for rightist cadres as a microcosm of the theological and intellectual turbulence within what is often mistakenly seen as a monolithic 'religious right' in America\".\n\nWhile expressing concerns about Robertson's alleged past expressions of antisemitism (faculty blamed this on poorly chosen ghost writers) and associations with dominion theology promoting Christian control of secular institutions that some critics believe inspired the school's name, Cox said the faculty insisted that Regent did not support Dominionism, pointing to the firing of Herbert Titus, the founding dean of the Law School, who was inclined to such a philosophy. Cox pointed to historian Bruce Barron's suggestion that the Regent faculty serve as a \"moderating influence\": \"They are pragmatists who accept religious pluralism and do not insist on the universal applicability of Old Testament law\" while preferring to focus on constitutional issues. Cox characterized Regent's mission as continuing in the tradition of religiously trained professionals by various Catholic and Protestant faiths such as Jesuit universities and (originally) Harvard. He found that academic freedom was promoted and that although half of the student body considered themselves affiliated with renewal theology, there existed a wider range of political attitudes than he first imagined.\n\nWith the goal of expanding its mission beyond a solely conservative base and to “posture itself as a broadly evangelical institution”, the Regent School of Divinity convened a scholarly colloquium with the more liberal National Council of Churches and the Virginia Council of Churches, associations of mainline Protestant churches in 2008. The conference discussed their common approaches to evangelizing.\n\nFreedom of expression controversy\n\nIn September 2007, Adam Key, a second-year law student at Regent, posted a photograph on the social networking website Facebook of the school's chancellor, Pat Robertson, making an obscene gesture. Key also criticized Robertson for urging the assassination of Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez. School officials asked Key to remove the still, publicly apologize and withhold public comment or, alternatively, defend the posting. While Key did remove the photograph, he refused to apologize and submitted his defense on the grounds it was protected speech. Regent rejected his argument and Key was subsequently suspended and later removed. In November 2007, Key filed a lawsuit against Regent claiming fraud, violation of his right to free expression as governed by rules tied to Federal funding, and defamation. Robertson said that, in general, freedom of speech does not encompass the use of these kinds of images. The university stated that Key violated the school's standards of conduct. However, Key's attorney countered with examples of racist images posted on Facebook by other Regent students about which the school took no action.\n\nThe school later claimed its actions were unrelated to the photograph and that he was a \"security risk\"; Key's attorney countered with an internal memo sent the day before the suspension indicating that Robertson was concerned with Key's \"complaints\".\n\nIn June 2009, the lawsuit was dismissed. The judge ruled that despite federal funding, Regent's decisions were not state actions and hence not governed by the First Amendment. He also found that Robertson had not defamed Keys and that \"generic recruiting correspondence\" from the school could not be considered a contract and thereby dismissed the fraud complaint. In November 2007, a civil rights lawyer representing Key sent a complaint to the American Bar Association calling for them to revoke the school's accreditation. Key claimed the university suspended him for his political and religious views in violation of ABA accreditation standards.\n\nBush administration hires\n\nAccording to Regent University, more than 150 of its graduates had been hired by the federal government during the George W. Bush presidency including dozens in Bush's administration. As it was previously rare for alumni to go into government, journalist Charlie Savage suggested that the appointment of Office of Personnel Management director Kay Coles James, the former dean of Regent's government school, caused this sharp increase in Regent alumni employed in the government. An article about a Regent graduate who interviewed for a government position and Regent's low school rankings were cited as an example of the Bush administration hiring applicants with strong conservative credentials but weaker academic qualifications and less civil rights law experience than past candidates in the Civil Rights Division. In addition to Savage, several other commentators made similar assertions. contrasted the employment of Regent employees by Bush to the hiring practices of his successor Barack Obama who tended to select from higher secular colleges.\n\nHowever, Savage noted that the school had improved since its days of \"dismal numbers\" and that the school has had recent wins in national moot-court and negotiation competitions. Though a prominent critic of the school, Reverend Barry Lynn of Americans United for the Separation of Church and State advised against \"underestimat[ing] the quality of a lot of the people that are there.\"\n\nLawsuit against the University System of Georgia\n\nOn August 22, 2012, Regent University announced its intentions to file a lawsuit for a trademark dispute against the Board of Regents of the University System of Georgia over the name of , the adopted name of the consolidation between the institutions of Augusta State University and Georgia Health Sciences University, stating that the name infringes on the Regent University trademark and would create marketplace confusion; however, the USG Board of Regents contend that the name is broad enough where Regent's lawsuit would be dismissed. The Georgia Regents name is unpopular with students and alumni within the two Augusta universities as well as the Augusta community at-large; those protesting against the name hoped the lawsuit would force the University System to reconsider the name. Additionally, Augusta attorneys against the Georgia Regents name attempted to contact Regent University about assisting in the lawsuit; however, the university stated that they will use their regular trademark counsel.\n\nOn October 22, 2012, Georgia Attorney General Sam Olens filed motions in federal court to have Regent University's lawsuit dismissed, citing sovereign immunity as well as the broadness of the \"Regent\" name as the basis for dismissal. Regent University and the USG Board of Regents reached a settlement in late June 2013, allowing the use of the Georgia Regents name.\n\nFaculty\n\nRegent has 165 full-time and 465 part-time faculty members, who are graduates of Yale, Harvard, Oxford, Duke, Johns Hopkins, Notre Dame, Vanderbilt, and others; five of whom are Fulbright Scholars. Faculty are responsible for lecturing classes, advising both graduate and undergraduate students, and sitting on academic committees.\n\nSeveral members are drawn from high levels of government. Former U.S. Attorney under the Bush administration, John Ashcroft, was named Distinguished Professor in 2005 teaching a two-week course each semester in the Robertson School of Government and lecturing on national security law. Also named Distinguished Professor was former Chief of Naval Operations Admiral Vern Clark who teaches courses in leadership and government. In 2006, former Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak was a visiting faculty member for the School of Undergraduate Studies. Herb Titus, founding dean of the Law School, was the 1996 vice-presidential candidate of the Constitution Party and a drafter of the Constitutional Restoration Act to permit government officials to acknowledge \"God as the sovereign source of law, liberty, or government\". Titus was fired in 1993 for being \"too extreme\".\n\nThe School of Divinity includes both biblical scholars and religious practitioners, notably the theologian Graham Twelftree, Dean Emeritus H. Vinson Synan, Pentecostal theologian Amos Yong and church historian Stanley M. Burgess. The late J. Rodman Williams was Professor Emeritus.\n\nNoted alumni\n\nRegent University alumni include ex-Virginia Governor and convicted felon Bob McDonnell, former Assistant U.S. Secretary of Labor Lisa Kruska, and Democratic Louisiana State Senator Sharon Weston Broome.\n\nBrennan Swain, a 1996 graduate of Regent Law, was the winner of the CBS television show The Amazing Race Season 1 and also appeared on Camp Reality on Fox Reality Channel.\n\nMonica Goodling, 1999 graduate of Regent Law and former Director of Public Affairs for the U.S. Department of Justice from 2001 to 2007, is best known for her involvement in the dismissal of U.S. attorneys controversy as was her press aide, 1998 law graduate, John Nowacki, and Goodling's predecessor, 1998 School of Business and 1999 Robertson School of Government graduate Susan Richmond.\n\nJay Sekulow, a Ph.D. graduate, is Chief Counsel for Pat Robertson's American Center for Law and Justice, a non-profit public interest law firm specializing in constitutional issues of religious freedom.\n\nTroy A. Titus, Regent Law graduate, son of the founding dean of the school, Herb Titus, and previously a nationally known asset protection expert, is best known for losing his law license for defrauding his clients, many of them elderly.\n\nTerrance Bridges, a dissertation away from earning a doctorate from the School of Education, was featured in The Star Press's Black History Month profile for his ministerial work with children and youth."
