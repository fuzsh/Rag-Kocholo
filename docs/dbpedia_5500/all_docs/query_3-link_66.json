        "text": "Regent's University London Overview\n\nRegent’s University London offers a personal, well-connected, entrepreneurial, future-facing and cosmopolitan education that strives to shape learners into tomorrow’s global leaders.\n\nWith more than 140 nationalities on campus, it’s a meeting place for people from all over the world and delivers a one-of-a-kind student experience – a hive for innovative thinkers who thrive in an intimate and supportive environment. With just 3,000 students on campus, Regent’s feels like a home-away-from-home – with a tight-knit community, where staff and students get to know each other by name.\n\nRegent's take a personal approach to teaching, with students benefitting from small classes, regular one-to-one contact with tutors and tailored support. Lessons are designed with industry-leaders and are bought to life with live client briefs, site visits, London tours, workshops, and opportunities to study abroad – enabling students to develop cutting-edge industry skills.\n\nGraduates go on to build successful global careers in a wide range of industries (securing multi-million-pound investments, topping Forbes’ 30 Under 30 list, winning BAFTA nominations), as well as becoming entrepreneurs, starting their own companies or returning to family businesses.\n\nRegent's University London Location\n\nSurrounded by 11 acres of private gardens in royal Regent’s Park, and with gated access and a 24/7 security presence, our secluded campus offers a serene oasis in which to live and study, right in the heart of bustling central London.\n\nWithin walking distance of the city’s amenities and landmarks, its unrivalled location gives students access to all that the capital has to offer – from museums, galleries and archives to food and flower markets, Michelin-star restaurants, shopping streets and major sporting and entertainment venues.\n\nWithin half an hour from St Pancras International and just over an hour from London’s airports, it’s also a great base for students looking to explore the UK and beyond."
