        "text": "Regent University was founded with the specific purpose to prepare leaders who were not only successful in their industry but would also advance Christian beliefs in order to impact others. The university was founded in 1977 under the leadership of M.G. \"Pat\" Robertson and incorporated in Virginia Beach as Christian Broadcasting Network University.\n\nIn 1990, the school was renamed Regent University and the new name was in reference to someone who served in power when a sovereign is absent, indicating that the college was representing Christ, the Sovereign. There were 77 students in the first class at the university, all enrolled in what was then called the School of Communication & the Arts. Classes were held in leased space in Chesapeake, Virginia and the first students graduated in May 1980. That same year, the college moved to its current campus in Virginia Beach. A secondary campus opened in Alexandria in 1995 with a program designed for teachers in the Washington, DC area, but that facility was sold at a later date.\n\nThe university's Divine Mission continues today with more than 6,000 students enrolled in undergraduate and graduate degrees at the school's campus and online. The academic programs are rigorous, but rewarding and the school remains a premier educational institution dedicated to combining higher education with biblical learning.\n\nRegent University Accreditation Details\n\nRegent University is accredited by the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools Commission on Colleges.
