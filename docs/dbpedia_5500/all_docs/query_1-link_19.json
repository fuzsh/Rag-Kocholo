        "text": "VIRGINIA BEACH, VA\n\nRegent University, established in 1978, is a fully accredited Christian university located in Virginia Beach, Virginia. Offering associate, bachelor’s, master’s and doctoral degrees, Regent is dedicated to preparing future leaders, scholars and professionals to make a positive impact around the world.\n\nWith more than 20,000 alumni already trained and equipped to excel personally and professionally, Regent is more than an outstanding university. It is a launching pad for tomorrow’s inspired leaders. From CEOs and teachers to senators, judges, entrepreneurs, media professionals and more, Regent graduates are found in virtually every discipline, working with integrity and cultural relevance.\n\nThe university’s roots as the nation’s first freestanding graduate school dedicated to applying faith-based principles to rigorous academic instruction attest to Regent’s solid graduate-level foundation. Guiding students in their pursuits is a community of practitioners and scholars whose knowledge base and experience prepare graduates to richly influence the nation and the world.\n\nGuest lecturers and distinguished professors include: President and CEO of Forbes, Inc., Steve Forbes; former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani; former U.S. Attorney General John Ashcroft, distinguished professor of law and government; former Chief of Naval Operations for the U.S. Navy Admiral Vern Clark, distinguished professor of leadership and government; and many others.\n\nRegent’s beautiful 70-acre Virginia Beach campus, featuring Georgian-style architecture, is a tribute to excellence in learning—with high-tech classrooms and state-of-the-art facilities.\n\nStudents may choose from a host of on-campus or online classes, or a combination of both, making it easier for them to complete their educational goals their way.\n\nNot only is Regent ranked 11th in the nation for its online bachelor’s programs (U.S. News & World Report, 2015), but the university is also a top military-friendly university (G.I. Jobs and Military Advanced Education magazines). The American Council of Trustees and Alumni also recognizes Regent in the top two percent of liberal arts “A” rated universities.\n\nRegent’s diverse student body of nearly 7,500 students represents all 50 states, 46 countries and 39 denominations. Its graduate degree programs include the following disciplines: business, communication and the arts, divinity, education, government, law, leadership, and psychology and counseling. Regent’s School of Undergraduate Studies also offers degrees in each of these disciplines, as well as history, technology, health care, biophysical sciences, mathematics, and more.\n\nRegent invites prospective students to discover how the university can prepare them to achieve their fullest potential."
