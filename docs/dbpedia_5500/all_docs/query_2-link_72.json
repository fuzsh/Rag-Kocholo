        "text": "Regent University School of Law, located in Virginia Beach, Virginia, offers skills-intensive, Christian faith-based legal education that equips students to be excellent lawyers and leaders in the legal profession.\n\nIts goal is to lay a foundation of first principles of law, the Western Legal and Common Law traditions, and American Constitutionalism. Regent Law also equips students with the contemporary knowledge base and practical skills necessary to thrive in law-related disciplines.\n\nThe school’s religious affiliation is emphasized in the classroom through devotions and substantive integration. The faculty, educated at some of the nation’s top law schools, serve as mentors for students and provide excellent instruction.\n\nRegent prepares students to be practice-ready when they graduate. Through various clinical and experiential learning opportunities, and outstanding Moot Court and Trial Advocacy Programs, Regent Law graduates are equipped with the skills they need to succeed in practice. Regent also has an excellent writing program, with a focus on preparing students for judicial clerkships. Regent is competitive with the top schools in the nation for judicial clerkships and jobs.\n\nRegent alumni practice law in nearly every state in the nation and in 24 countries.\n\nThe Center for Global Justice gives students the opportunity to partner with human rights organizations across the world and provides a number of students each year with grant money to travel domestically and abroad to combat human trafficking, secure religious freedom, and protect vulnerable women and children. And through the Robertson Center for Constitutional Law, students have the opportunity to work on amicus briefs to the Supreme Court and Federal Appellate Courts in high-profile freedom of speech, separation of powers, and religious liberty cases."
