        "text": "An Innovative Graduate School of Theology\n\nRegent College was founded in 1968 as the first graduate school of theology in North America to make education of the laity its central focus. Our Christ-centred graduate programs and courses bring together vibrant evangelical faith and rigorous academics.\n\nOver 600 students join us every term (full- and part-time), from over 40 countries, representing more than 30 denominations. These students come from every vocation and field, with a breadth of perspectives, cultures, and ages. They leave transformed—spiritually and academically—and stay members of a thriving alumni community far beyond graduation.\n\nRegent is truly transdenominational—welcoming students from all ends of the theological spectrum. As an institution, Regent is both evangelical and orthodox, but our first priority is to remain true to orthodox faith as recorded in the Scriptures.\n\nThe College is home to some of the most influential theological thinkers and remains one of the world’s foremost graduate schools of Christian studies.\n\nLearn more about our mission and values, our history, and our theological position.\n\nQuick facts"
