The school's motto is Christian leadership to change the world. Come here to grow.\n\nAustin\n\nTwo important factors in my choosing Regent were convenience and Christian atmosphere and my first semester here has been better than I imagined. The Christian atmosphere is great with friendly students and professors (and other staff!). Regent has been a setting for my growth in faith this past semester (through in/out of class discussions, friendships, and other experiences) and of course academic study.\n\nDavid from Virginia Beach, VA\n\nRegent University has a fantastic online degree program whereby non-traditional students can obtain a degree without ever having to set foot on campus. The online program is a US News and World Reports top 100 and provides challenging courses and coursework to all students. Additionally, Regent has lowered their tuition in order to make higher education more affordable for everyone.\n\nStephanie from Richmond, VA\n\nRegent University has displayed professionalism throughout the application process and during my first year of school. The university not only teaches excellence, it practices it through it's staff and faculty. Regent sets a standard for others to follow.\n\nCatherine from Virginia Beach, VA\n\nRegent is a very engaging and rigorous school. The faculty are extremely accessible and helpful. I very much enjoy their programs construction and instruction.\n\nBrenden from Vienna, VA\n\nSimilar Colleges\n\nNewport News, VA\n\nFairfax, VA\n\nHampton, VA\n\nHarrisonburg, VA\n\nLynchburg, VA\n\nNorfolk, VA\n\nNorfolk, VA\n\nRadford, VA\n\nRichmond, VA\n\nCharlottesville, VA\n\nVirginia Beach, VA\n\nNew York, NY\n\nSee All"
