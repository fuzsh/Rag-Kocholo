        "text": "Regent’s University London is a private university based in Royal Regent’s Park. Set in 11 acres of secluded private garden, just minutes away from all that this exciting city has to offer.\n\nRegent’s offers both master’s and bachelor’s degrees (some also offering a Foundation year) within five key subject areas:\n\nBusiness & Management\n\nFashion & Design\n\nFilm, Media & Performance\n\nLiberal Arts & Humanities\n\nPsychotherapy & Psychology\n\nBritish Council-accredited English Language Centre.\n\nStudents at Regent’s are part of one of the most international educational communities in the United Kingdom, with more than 140 student nationalities on campus. You can study one of 9 languages as part of your degree and, on some courses, study abroad in the 2nd semester of your 2nd year in countries like Mexico, France, Japan, Australia and many more.\n\nInternships are an important complement to academic learning, and many opportunities are offered to develop their skills, both in and outside the classroom. This makes you very attractive in the job market. Thanks to this, 12.6% of Regent’s graduates form their own companies. This is the highest percentage of founders out of all other UK universities.\n\nWe are unique in London because our class sizes are small, and we take a personalised approach to teaching. We’re able to do so with a 15:1 student-staff ratio. We emphasized plenty of one-to-one interaction and the practical application of academic learning. As a student, you have close contact with and will receive personal guidance and support from the university’s academics, all industry-savvy experts in their disciplines.\n\nCourse Areas"
