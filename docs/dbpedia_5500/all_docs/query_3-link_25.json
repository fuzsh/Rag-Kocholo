It aims to enhance students' language skills, including reading, writing, speaking, and listening.\n\nCentre for Academic Writing: This newly established center focuses on assisting students with their academic writing skills. It provides guidance, workshops, and resources to help students improve their writing abilities across disciplines.\n\nFurthermore, the University College offers interdisciplinary programs that transcend the boundaries of schools and disciplines. These programs likely involve collaboration between different faculties or schools and integrate multiple areas of study."
