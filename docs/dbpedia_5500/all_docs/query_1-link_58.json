Each graduate school offers fully accredited master's and doctoral degrees online and on campus, with a commitment to transforming students with knowledge and faith, together. Since its establishment in 1978, Regent has prepared more than 20,000 students from over 110 countries to become accomplished professionals. Its alumni serve as top leaders and mentors, including a former governor, a National Middle School Principal of the Year, a Virginia State Teacher of the Year, more than 400 award-winning film and communication professionals, respected lawyers, judges, counselors, CEOS and more.\n\nOther accomplishments include Regent's School of Law faculty being named as among the Top 10 in the Nation by the Princeton Review, 2013, 2014 and 2015 and the Regent Law moot court program being named among the top five in the nation (University of Houston Law Center, 2016). Not only is Regent recognized among the top 20 schools nationally for online bachelor’s programs, the university also ranks in the top 5 online MBA programs in Virginia and is the top-ranked graduate school in Virginia for Online Graduate Education Programs (U.S. News & World Report, 2015). The university is also a top military-friendly university, offering generous support and benefits to veterans, active duty military and their families.\n\nOn average, Regent’s annual tuition is less than that of other private institutions.
