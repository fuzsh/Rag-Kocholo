        "text": "The braille System is the most adopted writing and reading process in relief worldwide and includes the writing of the alphabet and of mathematical, chemical, phonetic, computer, and musical symbols. This text aims to explain what the braille System is and its importance for the independence of the blind person. In addition to demonstrating the appropriate distance between the points and proving that writing on the conventional slate is the best resource for correct writing in braille, the main objective of the research is to emphasize the importance of using the braille System and to value the conventional slate as a braille writing instrument. From the reading of theoretical texts and writings performed using both slates, the result is even more evident that writing on the conventional slate meets the tactile reading of the blind person, who uses the pad of the index finger to feel the braille dots. Article visualizations:\n\nDifferent countries of the world have adopted the Braille System to suits their language. The main focus of the paper is the conversion of Tamil to Braille Conversion System. The paper provides a detail description of a system for Tamil Braille and different grades of Braille contraction. The Tamil Braille is designed to facilitate Tamil-speaking visually impaired people interaction with computers, as well as helping sighted users to communicate with the visually impaired person.\n\nNearly 161 million persons live with a disabling visual impairment, of whom 37 million are blind. About 90 % of them live in developing countries of Africa, Asia, Latin America and the Pacific Regions. 9 out of 10 blind children in developing countries have no access to education. The system of embossed writing invented by Louis Braille gradually came to be accepted throughout the world as the fundamental form of written communication for blind individuals. This paper is concerned about the transliteration of English and Hindi text to Braille. Braille is a dotted pattern used by the blind people for reading and writing. In this paper we have discussed the possible ways to teach Blind people [11]..Braille has become the pre-eminent tactile alphabet. Its characters are six- dot cells, two wide by three tall. Any of\n\nBraille alphabet is an important tool that enables&lt;br&gt; visually impaired individuals to have a comfortable life like those&lt;br&gt; who have normal vision. For this reason, new applications related to&lt;br&gt; the Braille alphabet are being developed. In this study, a new&lt;br&gt; Refreshable Braille Display was developed to help visually impaired&lt;br&gt; individuals learn the Braille alphabet easier. By means of this system,&lt;br&gt; any text downloaded on a computer can be read by the visually&lt;br&gt; impaired individual at that moment by feeling it by his/her hands.&lt;br&gt; Through this electronic device, it was aimed to make learning the&lt;br&gt; Braille alphabet easier for visually impaired individuals with whom&lt;br&gt; the necessary tests were conducted."
