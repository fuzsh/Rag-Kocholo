        "text": "IDNYC's Language and Disability Access\n\nIDNYC works to ensure language spoken, limited English proficiency (LEP), and disability are not barriers to accessing services. This language and disability access information describes how IDNYC makes its program accessible to applicants who have LEP and for those who have disabilities. Please review the below as well as IDNYC's Frequently Asked Questions for information about services that may be available.\n\nFor additional information about how the Department of Social Services (DSS)/Human Resources Administration (HRA) provides language access, see the DSS Language Access Implementation Plan.\n\nFor more information about IDNYC's language and disability access, please call 311 and say \"IDNYC\". People who are deaf or hard of hearing and use a video phone should refer to the Disability Access section below for more information.\n\nLanguage Access - Services\n\nLanguage Identification and Translated Printed Materials\n\nIDNYC applicants can self-identify their preferred language while at an Enrollment Center using Language Cards, which are provided during the application process. IDNYC staff can also use telephonic interpretation to assist with language identification.\n\nIDNYC permits cardholders to indicate their primary language preference on the back side of the card to assist cardholders during interactions with City agencies and private organizations.\n\nApplications are available in 35 languages and services can be provided to applicants in their preferred language through bilingual staff at IDNYC Enrollment Centers or through telephonic support.\n\nIDNYC's public documents and signage, including the public website, benefit-related material, and the list of enrollment center locations are available in all designated citywide languages of Local Law 30 of 2017 (Spanish, Chinese, Russian, Bengali, Haitian Creole, Korean, Arabic, Urdu, French, and Polish). Some of these materials are also available in additional languages. Printed brochures in all designated citywide languages of Local Law 30 are available upon request at Enrollment Centers, as well as on IDNYC's website.\n\nInterpretation Services to Communicate With Applicants\n\nIDNYC communicates with applicants with LEP through bilingual staff, telephonic interpretation, and in-person interpretation. Applicants and cardholders will be assigned to bilingual employees whenever practicable. When bilingual staff are unavailable, free interpretation services are available to all applicants and IDNYC staff are responsible for ensuring that applicants are connected to interpretation services as soon as possible. Telephonic interpretation services are available at every Enrollment Center during all hours of operation and IDNYC Enrollment Centers are equipped with dual headset phone systems to aid with telephonic interpretation. Interpretation services can also be requested prior to an appointment through IDNYC Customer Service, which may be accessed through 311.\n\nTranslation Services for Applicants' Documents\n\nIDNYC contracts to provide on-site, in-person document translation services for applicants who present foreign documents that cannot be translated by IDNYC staff. If during an appointment a document needs to be translated, an applicant may be given a future appointment on a date that is convenient to the applicant and an in-person translator will be made available at the Enrollment Center. Translation services can also be requested prior to an appointment through IDNYC Customer Service, which may be accessed through 311. Documents submitted to the Online Portal will be translated as needed.\n\nDisability Access - Services and Reasonable Accommodations\n\nWheelchair Access at Enrollment Centers\n\nAll permanent Enrollment Centers are wheelchair accessible and have at least one accessible counter for ease of access.\n\nPeople Who Are Blind or Low-Vision\n\nThe IDNYC program provides the following services for individuals who are blind or low-vision:\n\n\"idnyc\" will be embossed on the front of all new IDNYC cards to help IDNYC cardholders to identify and utilize the card. Only the word \"idnyc\" will appear in braille. Cards without \"idnyc\" embossed in braille may be replaced with a new card at no cost by visiting any Enrollment Center and requesting a replacement. For more information, see Frequently Asked Questions 50-53.\n\nMagnifying page readers are available upon request from Enrollment Center staff for those who are low-vision.\n\nApplications and document guides in large-type font are available on the IDNYC website and upon request from Enrollment Center staff for those who are low-vision.\n\nApplications in braille are available upon request from Enrollment Center staff for those who are blind and able to read braille.\n\nIf an applicant is not able to read the large print or braille application or use the magnifying page reader, IDNYC staff will read through the application with the applicant and help them complete it.\n\nService animals are permitted at all Enrollment Centers.\n\nPeople who are Deaf or Hard of Hearing\n\nThe IDNYC program provides the following services for individuals who are deaf or hard of hearing:\n\nA portable Induction Loop system is available at every Enrollment Center.\n\nSign language interpretation services will be provided through Purple Video Remote Interpreting Service (Purple VRI). This service is available on-demand at most Enrollment Center locations. Note that this service is not available at the Department of Finance Business Centers in Brooklyn (210 Joralemon St, 1st FL) and Manhattan (66 John St, 2nd FL). At these two locations, in-person American Sign Language (ASL) interpretation will be provided upon request.\n\nFor more information, please see Frequently Asked Question 7 or call 311 and say \"IDNYC\".

For more information, please see Frequently Asked Question 22.\n\nDisability Access - Homebound Services\n\nNote: Homebound service has been temporarily suspended.\n\nIDNYC provides homebound visits for applicants with disabilities and/or limitations that make it difficult for them to visit or have their photo taken at an Enrollment Center.
