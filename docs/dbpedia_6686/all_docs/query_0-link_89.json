        "text": "Information Communication Technology (ICT) has become an essential industry in today’s world, since it provides an overarching enabling platform for the human development process. ICT is used for achieving business goals as well as macro development goals owing to its transformative power. Digital content also plays a vital role as ICT has become a part of life for all human beings throughout the world. Today, Sri Lanka is on a strategic path, aiming to become a digitally inclusive nation. To achieve this national goal, the ICT Agency of Sri Lanka implements e-Swabhimani, the National Best e-Content Award with the aim of recognizing the creativity and skills of local digital content and application developers. It is expected that national recognition would spur a greater interest in leveraging ICT for the social and economic development of the country. The e-Swabhimani Award process is being conducted along the lines of the World Summit which is the global follow-up initiative of the United Nations World Summit on Information Society and the e-Swabhimani award is a stepping stone to other regional and international awards. This book contains white papers selected from applicants of e-Swabhimani 2016.The main objective of this book is to benchmark the best e-content and applications developed in Sri Lanka in the year 2016 and take the products/ services and the developers to a national and international levels. It has been identified that most of e-content and applications are innovative in answering a problem in today’s world. This book presents 41 white papers on ICT innovations under nine categories, namely, Government & Open Data, Health & Environment, Learning & Science, Entertainment & Lifestyle, Culture & Tourism, Media & News, Business & Commerce, Inclusion & Empowerment and m-Content.\n\nWith the popularity of Android smart phones everyone finds it convenient to make transactions through these smart phones. And the users of these smart phones, in most cases unaware of different types of threats. The purpose for this survey paper is to conduct a survey on users to get the information about the security vulnerabilities they are creating unknowingly, bringing forward some security frameworks for these threats & giving a basic knowledge to the new comer to the android about android OS architecture and the threats to this architecture.\n\nNowadays Smartphone and other mobile devices have become incredibly important in every aspect of our life. Because they have practically offered same capabilities as desktop workstations as well as come to be powerful in terms of CPU (Central processing Unit), Storage and installing numerous applications. Therefore, Security is considered as an important factor in wireless communication technologies, particularly in a wireless ad-hoc network and mobile operating systems. Moreover, based on increasing the range of mobile application within variety of platforms, security is regarded as on the most valuable and considerable debate in terms of issues, trustees, reliabilities and accuracy. This paper aims to introduce a consolidated report of thriving security on mobile application platforms and providing knowledge of vital threats to the users and enterprises. Furthermore, in this paper, various techniques as well as methods for security measurements, analysis and prioritization within the peak of mobile platforms will be presented. Additionally, increases understanding and awareness of security on mobile application platforms to avoid detection, forensics and countermeasures used by the operating systems. Finally, this study also discusses security extensions for popular mobile platforms and analysis for a survey within a recent research in the area of mobile platform security.\n\nMobile devices are becoming a method to provide an efficient and convenient way to access, find and share information; however, the availability of this information has caused an increase in cyber attacks. Currently, cyber threats range from Trojans and viruses to botnets and toolkits. Presently, 96% of mobile devices do not have pre-installed security software while approximately 65% of the vulnerabilities are found within the application layer. This lack in security and policy driven systems is an opportunity for malicious cyber attackers to hack into the various popular devices. Traditional security software found in desktop computing platforms, such as firewalls, antivirus, and encryption, is widely used by the general public in mobile devices. Moreover, mobile devices are even more vulnerable than personal desktop computers because more people are using mobile devices to do personal tasks. This review attempts to display the importance of developing a national security policy created for mobile devices in order to protect sensitive and confidential data."
