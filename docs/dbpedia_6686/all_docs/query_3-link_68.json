Others in this list can be downloaded using Font Book, which is in your Applications folder. Fonts that haven't been downloaded appear dimmed in Font Book. New and updated fonts might be included with future macOS Sonoma updates.\n\nDocument-support fonts\n\nThese fonts are available only to documents that already use the font, or to apps that request the font by name. Some are older fonts that were included with earlier versions of macOS or Apple apps.\n\nLearn more\n\nYou can use Font Book to install and remove fonts, validate and resolve duplicate fonts, and restore the standard fonts that came with macOS Sonoma. For more information about Font Book, choose Font Book Help from the Help menu in Font Book.\n\nmacOS Sonoma installs fonts in these folders on your Mac:"
