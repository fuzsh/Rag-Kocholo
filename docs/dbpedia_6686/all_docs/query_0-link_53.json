        "text": "Online English To Sinhala Typing\n\nThis section of our website hindityping.info is dedicated for free Online English to Sinhala Typing. Here you can write in English and it will automatically get converted or transliterated into Sinhalese Language. 19 million people in Sri Lanka speak Sinhala, of which 16 million are native speakers. Along with Tamil, it is one of Sri Lanka's officially recognised official languages. The writing system used for Sinhala is a derivative of the Indian Brahmi script. The earliest surviving literary works in Sinhala originate from the ninth century AD, while the earliest inscriptions date to the third and second centuries BC. Dhivehi, the language of the Maldives, is the closest relative of Sinhala. Like many other Asian languages, the Sinhala language uses the SOV (subject-object-verb) word order. With a little time and practise, speakers of that particular language style might easily learn Sinhala.\n\nFor Example, if you type \"likhati\" in Sinhala Conversion box it will be changed automatically to \"लिखती\" after pressing \"space bar\".\n\nIf you type \" | \" pipe (Shift + \\ Key) in Sinhala Conversion box it will give \" । \" Purn Viram.\n\nWord & Character Suggestions\n\nYou can also change between Word Suggestions & Character Suggestions. In word suggestions mode you will get suggestion when you type whole word and release space bar but in character suggestions you will start getting suggestions the moment you start Sinhala typing.\n\nSave as Text & Doc File\n\nYou can also download whatever you have typed on your pc as a notepad text file or word document file by simply clicking the button below Sinhala text area."
