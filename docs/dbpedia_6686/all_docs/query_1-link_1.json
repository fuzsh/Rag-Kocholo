Along with Pali, it played a major role in the development of Theravada Buddhist literature.[1]\n\nEarly forms of the Sinhala language are attested as early as the 3rd century BCE.[7] The language of these inscriptions, still retaining long vowels and aspirated consonants, is a Prakrit similar to Magadhi, a regional associate of the Middle Indian Prakrits that had been used during the time of the Buddha.[8] The most closely related languages are the Vedda language (an endangered, indigenous creole still spoken by a minority of Sri Lankans, mixing Sinhala with an isolate of unknown origin and from which Old Sinhala borrowed various aspects into its main Indo-Aryan substrate), and the Maldivian language. It has two main varieties, written and spoken, and is a conspicuous example of the linguistic phenomenon known as diglossia.[9][10]\n\nEtymology\n\n[edit]\n\nSinhala (Siṃhala) is a Sanskrit term; the corresponding Middle Indo-Aryan (Eḷu) word is Sīhala. The name is a derivative of siṃha, the Sanskrit word for 'lion'.[12] The name is sometimes glossed as 'abode of lions', and attributed to a supposed former abundance of lions on the island.[13]\n\nHistory\n\n[edit]\n\nAccording to the chronicle Mahāvaṃsa, written in Pali, Prince Vijaya of the Vanga Kingdom and his entourage merged in Sri Lanka with later settlers from the Pandya kingdom.[14][15][16] In the following centuries, there was substantial immigration from Eastern India, including additional migration from the Vanga Kingdom (Bengal), as well as Kalinga and Magadha.[17] This influx led to an admixture of features of Eastern Prakrits.[citation needed]\n\nStages of historical development\n\n[edit]\n\nThe development of Sinhala is divided into four epochs:[18]\n\nElu Prakrit (3rd c. BCE to 4th c. CE)\n\nProto-Sinhala (4th c. CE to 8th c. CE)\n\nMedieval Sinhala (8th c. CE to 13th c. CE)\n\nModern Sinhala (13th c. CE to the present)\n\nPhonetic development\n\n[edit]\n\nThe most important phonetic developments of Sinhala include:\n\nthe loss of aspiration as a distinction for plosive consonants (e.g. kanavā \"to eat\" corresponds to Sanskrit khādati, Hindustani khānā)\n\nthe loss of original vowel length distinction; long vowels in the modern language are found in loanwords (e.g. vibāgaya \"exam\" < Sanskrit vibhāga) or as a result of sandhi, either after elision of intervocalic consonants (e.g. dānavā \"to put\" < damanavā) or in originally compound words.\n\nthe simplification of consonant clusters and geminate consonants into geminates and single consonants respectively (e.g. Sanskrit viṣṭā \"time\" > Sinhalese Prakrit viṭṭa > Modern Sinhala viṭa)\n\ndevelopment of /tʃ/ to /s/ and/or /ɦ/ (e.g. san̆da/han̆da \"moon\" corresponds to Sanskrit candra) and development of /dʒ/ to /d/ (e.g. dæla \"web\" corresponds to Sanskrit jāla)\n\ndevelopment of prenasalized consonants from Sanskrit nasal + voiced stops (see han̆da)[19]\n\nWestern vs. Eastern Prakrit features\n\n[edit]\n\nAccording to Wilhelm Geiger, an example of a possible Western feature in Sinhala is the retention of initial /v/ which developed into /b/ in the Eastern languages (e.g. Sanskrit viṃśati \"twenty\", Sinhala visi-, Hindi bīs). This is disputed by Muhammad Shahidullah who says that Sinhala Prakrit branched off from the Eastern Prakrits prior to this change. He cites the edicts of Ashoka, no copy of which shows this sound change.[20]\n\nAn example of an Eastern feature is the ending -e for masculine nominative singular (instead of Western -o) in Sinhalese Prakrit. There are several cases of vocabulary doublets, one example being the words mæssā (\"fly\") and mækkā (\"flea\"), which both correspond to Sanskrit makṣikā but stem from two regionally different Prakrit words macchiā (Western Prakrits) and makkhikā (as in Eastern Prakrits like Pali).\n\nPre-1815 Sinhalese literature\n\n[edit]\n\nIn 1815, the island of Ceylon came under British rule. During the career of Christopher Reynolds as a Sinhalese lecturer at the School of African and Oriental Studies, University of London, he extensively researched the Sinhalese language and its pre-1815 literature. The Sri Lankan government awarded him the Sri Lanka Ranjana medal for his work. He wrote the 377-page An anthology of Sinhalese literature up to 1815, selected by the UNESCO National Commission of Ceylon[21]\n\nSubstratum influence in Sinhala\n\n[edit]\n\nAccording to Wilhelm Geiger, Sinhala has features that set it apart from other Indo-Aryan languages. Some of the differences can be explained by the substrate influence of the parent stock of the Vedda language.[22] Sinhala has many words that are only found in Sinhala, or shared between Sinhala and Vedda and not etymologically derivable from Middle or Old Indo-Aryan. Possible examples include kola for leaf in Sinhala and Vedda (although others suggest a Dravidian origin for this word.[23][24][25]), dola for pig in Vedda and offering in Sinhala. Other common words are rera for wild duck, and gala for stones (in toponyms used throughout the island, although others have also suggested a Dravidian origin).[26][27][28] There are also high frequency words denoting body parts in Sinhala, such as olluva for head, kakula for leg, bella for neck and kalava for thighs, that are derived from pre-Sinhalese languages of Sri Lanka.[29] The oldest Sinhala grammar, Sidatsan̆garavā, written in the 13th century CE, recognised a category of words that exclusively belonged to early Sinhala. The grammar lists naram̆ba (to see) and koḷom̆ba (fort or harbour) as belonging to an indigenous source. Koḷom̆ba is the source of the name of the commercial capital Colombo.[30][31]\n\nSouth Dravidian substratum influence\n\n[edit]\n\nThe consistent left branching syntax and the loss of aspirated stops in Sinhala is attributed to a probable South Dravidian substratum effect.[32] This has been explained by a period of prior bilingualism:\n\n\"The earliest type of contact in Sri Lanka, not considering the aboriginal Vedda languages, was that which occurred between South Dravidian and Sinhala. It seems plausible to assume prolonged contact between these two populations as well as a high degree of bilingualism. This explains why Sinhala looks deeply South Dravidian for an Indo-Aryan language. There is corroboration in genetic findings.\"[33]\n\nInfluences from neighbouring languages\n\n[edit]\n\nIn addition to many Tamil loanwords, several phonetic and grammatical features also present in neighbouring Dravidian languages set modern spoken Sinhala apart from its Northern Indo-Aryan relatives. These features are evidence of close interactions with Dravidian speakers. Some of the features that may be traced to Dravidian influence are:\n\nthe loss of aspiration\n\nthe use of the attributive verb of kiyana \"to say\" as a subordinating conjunction with the meanings \"that\" and \"if\", e.g.:\n\nඒක\n\nēka\n\nit\n\nඅලුත්\n\naḷut\n\nnew\n\nකියලා\n\nkiyalā\n\nhaving-said\n\nමම\n\nmama\n\nI\n\nදන්නවා\n\ndannavā\n\nknow\n\nඒක අලුත් කියලා මම දන්නවා\n\nēka aḷut kiyalā mama dannavā\n\nit new having-said I know\n\n\"I know that it is new.\"\n\nඒක\n\nēka\n\nit\n\nඅලුත්\n\naḷut\n\nnew\n\nද\n\nda\n\nQ\n\nකියලා\n\nkiyalā\n\nhaving-said\n\nමම\n\nmama\n\nI\n\nදන්නේ\n\ndannē\n\nknow-EMP\n\nනැහැ\n\nnæhæ\n\nnot\n\nඒක අලුත් ද කියලා මම දන්නේ නැහැ\n\nēka aḷut da kiyalā mama dannē næhæ\n\nit new Q having-said I know-EMP not\n\n\"I do not know whether it is new.\"\n\nEuropean influence\n\n[edit]\n\nAs a result of centuries of colonial rule, interaction, settlement, intermarriage and assimilation, modern Sinhala contains many Portuguese, Dutch and English loanwords.\n\nInfluences on other languages\n\n[edit]\n\nMacanese Patois or Macau Creole (known as Patuá to its speakers) is a creole language derived mainly from Malay, Sinhala, Cantonese, and Portuguese, which was originally spoken by the Macanese people of the Portuguese colony of Macau. It is now spoken by a few families in Macau and in the Macanese diaspora.[citation needed]\n\nThe language developed first mainly among the descendants of Portuguese settlers who often married women from Malacca and Sri Lanka rather than from neighbouring China, so the language had strong Malay and Sinhala influence from the beginning.\n\nAccents and dialects\n\n[edit]\n\nThe Sinhala language has different types of variations which are commonly identified as 'dialects and accents'. Among those variations, 'regional variations' are prominent. Some of the well-known regional variations of Sinhala language are:[34]\n\nThe Uva Province variation (Monaragala, Badulla).\n\nThe southern variation (Matara, Galle).\n\nThe up-country variation (Kandy, Matale).\n\nThe Sabaragamu variation (Kegalle, Balangoda).\n\nUva regional variation in relation to grammar\n\n[edit]\n\nPeople from Uva province also have a unique linguistic variation in relation to the pronunciation of words. In general, Sinhala singular words are pluralized by adding suffixes like O, hu, wal or waru. But when it comes to Monaragala, the situation is somewhat different as when nouns are pluralized a nasal sound is added.[34]\n\nSouthern variation\n\n[edit]\n\nThe Kamath language (an indigenous language of paddy culture) used by the Southerners is somewhat different from the 'Kamath language' used in other parts (Uva, Kandy) of Sri Lanka as it is marked with a systematic variation; 'boya' at the end of the majority of nouns as the examples below show.[34]\n\nCrops: Kurakkan boya (bran)\n\nRambakan boya (banana)\n\nTools: Thattu boya (bucket)\n\nOther words: Nivahan boya (home)\n\nHere the particular word 'boya' means 'a little' in the Southern region and at the end of most of nouns, 'boya' is added regularly. This particular word 'boya' is added to most words by the Southern villages as a token of respect towards the things (those things can be crops, tools etc.) they are referring to.\n\nKandy, Kegalle and Galle people\n\n[edit]\n\nThe contrast among the regional variations used by Kandy, Kegalle and Galle people in relation to pronunciation[34] The common Sinhala variation Different regional variations of Sinhala language Notes Ayye heta wapuranna enwada?\n\n(Elder Brother, Are you coming to sow tomorrow?)\n\nAyya heta wapuranta enawada? (Kandy)\n\nAyye heta wapuranda enawada? (Kegalle)\n\nAyye heta wapuranna enawai? (Galle)\n\nHere the Kandy people say 'Ayya' while the Kegalle and Galle people say 'Ayye'.\n\nAlso, Kandy people add a 'ta' sound at the end of verbs while the Kegalle people add a 'da' sound. But Galle people's regional variation is not visible in relation to this particular verb; 'wapuranawa' (to sow). Yet their unique regional variation is visible in relation to the second verb which is 'enawai' (coming) as they add 'ai' at the end of most verbs.\n\nEven though the Kandy, Kegalle and Galle people pronounce words with slight differences, the Sinhalese can understand the majority of the sentences.\n\nDiglossia\n\n[edit]\n\nIn Sinhala there is distinctive diglossia, as in many languages of South Asia. The literary language and the spoken language differ from each other in many aspects. The written language is used for all forms of literary texts but also orally at formal occasions (public speeches, TV and radio news broadcasts, etc.), whereas the spoken language is used as the language of communication in everyday life (see also Sinhala slang and colloquialism). As a rule, the literary language uses more Sanskrit-based words.\n\nSinhala diglossia can also be described in terms of informal and formal varieties. The variety used for formal purposes is closer to the written/literary variety, whereas the variety used for informal purposes is closer to the spoken variety. It is also used in some modern literature (e.g. Liyanage Amarakeerthi's Kurulu Hadawatha).\n\nThe most important difference between the two varieties is the lack of inflected verb forms in the spoken language.\n\nSinhala also has diverse slang. Most slang words and terms were regarded as taboo, and most were frowned upon as non-scholarly. However, nowadays Sinhala slang words and terms, even the ones with sexual references, are commonly used among younger Sri Lankans.\n\nWriting system\n\n[edit]\n\nMain articles: Sinhala script and Sinhala Braille\n\nThe Sinhala script, Sinhala hodiya, is based on the ancient Brahmi script, and is thus a Brahmic script along with most Indian scripts and many Southeast Asian scripts. The Sinhala script is closely related to Grantha script and Khmer script, but it has also taken some elements from the related Kadamba script.[35][6]\n\nThe writing system for Sinhala is an abugida, where the consonants are written with letters while the vowels are indicated with diacritics (pilla) on those consonants, unlike alphabets like English where both consonants and vowels are full letters, or abjads like Urdu where vowels need not be written at all. Also, when a diacritic is not used, an \"inherent vowel\", either /a/ or /ə/, is understood, depending on the position of the consonant within the word. For example, the letter ක k on its own indicates ka, realized as /ka/ in stressed syllables and /kə/ in unstressed syllables. The other monophthong vowels are written: කා /kaː/, කැ /kæ/, and කෑ /kæː/ (after the consonant); කි /ki/ and කී /kiː/ (above the consonant); කු /ku/ and කූ /kuː/ (below the consonant); කෙ /ke/ and කේ /keː/ (before the consonant); and lastly, කො /ko/ and කෝ /koː/ (surrounding the consonant). For simple /k/ without a following vowel, a vowel-cancelling diacritic called හල් කිරීම (/hal kiriːmə/, hal kirima) is used, creating ක් /k/.\n\nThere are also a few diacritics for consonants, such as /r/ in special circumstances, although the tendency now is to spell words with the full letter ර /r/, with a hal kirima on whichever consonant has no vowel following it. One word that is still spelt with an \"r\" diacritic is ශ්‍රී, as in ශ්‍රී ලංකාව (Śri Lankāwa). The \"r\" diacritic is the curved line under the first letter (\"ශ\" → \"ශ්‍ර\"). A second diacritic representing the vowel sound /iː/ completes the word (\"ශ්‍ර\" → \"ශ්‍රී\").\n\nSeveral of these diacritics occur in two or more forms, and the form used depends on the shape of the consonant letter. Vowels also have independent letters, but these are only used at the beginning of words where there is no preceding consonant to add a diacritic to.\n\nThe complete script consists of about 60 letters, 18 for vowels and 42 for consonants. However, only 57 (16 vowels and 41 consonants) are required for writing colloquial spoken Sinhala (śuddha Sinhala).[citation needed] The rest indicate sounds that have been merged in the course of linguistic change, such as the aspirates, and are restricted to Sanskrit and Pali loan words. One letter (ඦ), representing the sound /ⁿd͡ʒa/, is attested in the script, although only a few words using this letter are known (වෑංඦන, ඉඦූ).\n\nThe Sinhala script is written from left to right, and is mainly used for Sinhala. It is also used for the liturgical languages Pali and Sanskrit, which are important in Buddhism and academic works. The alphabetic sequence is similar to those of other Brahmic scripts:\n\na/ā æ/ǣ i/ī u/ū [ŗ] e/ē [ai] o/ō [au] k [kh] g [gh] ṅ c [ch] j [jh] [ñ] ṭ [ṭh] ḍ [ḍh] [ṇ] t [th] d [dh] n p [ph] b [bh] m y r l v [ś ṣ] s h [ḷ] f\n\nPhonology\n\n[edit]\n\nExternal audio \"The Sound of the Sinhala language\" (ILoveLanguages!)\n\nSinhala has a smaller consonant inventory than most Indo-Aryan languages, but simultaneously has a larger vowel inventory than most. As an insular Indo-Aryan language, it and Dhivehi have features divergent from rest of the Indo-Aryan languages. Sinhala's nasal consonants are unusual among Indo-Aryan languages for lacking the retroflex nasal /ɳ/ while retaining nasals in the other four positions. Sinhala and Dhivehi are together unique for having prenasalised consonants, which are not found in any other Indo-Aryan language.\n\nConsonants\n\n[edit]\n\nSinhala has so-called prenasalised consonants, or 'half nasal' consonants. A short homorganic nasal occurs before a voiced stop, it is both shorter than a nasal alone and shorter than a sequence of nasal plus stop.[36] The nasal is syllabified with the onset of the following syllable, which means that the moraic weight of the preceding syllable is left unchanged. For example, tam̆ba 'copper' contrasts with tamba 'boil'.\n\nAll consonants other than the prenasalised consonants, /ŋ/, /ɸ/, /h/, and /ʃ/ can be geminated (occur as double consonants), but only between vowels.[36] In contexts that otherwise trigger gemination, prenasalised consonants become the corresponding nasal-voiced consonant sequence (e.g. /ⁿd/ is replaced with nd).[37]\n\nLabial Dental/\n\nAlveolar Retroflex Palatal Velar Glottal Nasal m n ɲ ŋ Stop/\n\nAffricate voiceless p t ʈ tʃ k voiced b d ɖ dʒ ɡ prenasalised ᵐb ⁿd ᶯɖ (ⁿdʒ) ᵑɡ Fricative (f~ɸ) s (ʃ) h Trill r Approximant ʋ l j\n\n/ʃ/ is found in learned borrowings from Sanskrit, including in the honorific ශ්‍රී (śrī), found in phrases including the country's name, Sri Lanka (ශ්‍රී ලංකා, /ʃriː laŋkaː/). /f~ɸ/ is restricted to loans, typically for English. They are commonly sometimes replaced by /p/ and /s/ respectively. Some speakers use [f], as in English, and some use [ɸ] due to its similarity to the native /p/.\n\nVowels\n\n[edit]\n\nSinhala has seven vowel qualities, with a phonemic vowel length distinction between long and short for all qualities, giving a total inventory of 14 vowels. The long vowel /əː/ is not present in native Sinhala words, but instead is found in certain English loanwords. Like in non-rhotic dialects of English, this long vowel can be represented by the short vowel followed by an r (ර්), as in ෂර්ට් /ʃəːʈ/ (\"shirt\").[36]\n\nFront Central Back short long short long short long Close i iː u uː Mid e eː ə (əː) o oː Open æ æː a aː\n\n/a/ and /ə/ have a largely complementary distribution, found primarily in stressed and unstressed syllables, respectively. However, there are certain contrasting pairs between the two phonemes, particularly between homographs කර /karə/ (\"shoulder\") and කර /kərə/ (\"to do\"). In writing, /a/ and /ə/ are both spelt without a vowel sign attached to the consonant letter, so the patterns of stress in the language must be used to determine the correct pronunciation. Stress is largely predictable and only contrastive between words in relatively few cases, so this does not present a problem for determining the pronunciation of a given word.[38]\n\nMost Sinhala syllables are of the form CV. The first syllable of each word is stressed, with the exception of the verb කරනවා /kərənəˈwaː/ (\"to do\") and all of its inflected forms where the first syllable is unstressed. Syllables using long vowels are always stressed. The remainder of the syllables are unstressed if they use a short vowel, unless they are immediately followed by one of: a CCV syllable, final /j(i)/ (-යි), final /wu/ (-වු), or a final consonant without a following vowel. The sound /ha/ is always stressed in nouns, adjectives, and adverbs, and so is not pronounced /hə/ except in the word හතලිහ /ˈhat̪əlihə/ (\"forty\"), where the initial /ha/ is stressed and the final /hə/ is unstressed.[39]\n\nNasalisation of vowels is common in certain environments, particularly before a prenasalised consonant. Nasalised /ãː/ and /æ̃ː/ exist as marginal phonemes, only present in certain interjections.[36]\n\nPhonotactics\n\n[edit]\n\nNative Sinhalese words are limited in syllable structure to (C)V(C), V̄, and CV̄(C), where V is a short vowel, V̄ is a long vowel, and C is a consonant. Exceptions exist for the marginal segment CC.[37] Prenasalised plosives are restricted to occurring intervocalically, and cannot end a syllable. Much more complicated consonant clusters are allowed in loan words, particularly from Sanskrit and English, an example being ප්‍රශ්‍නය praśnaya (\"question\").[40] Words cannot end in nasals other than /ŋ/.[41] Because of historical loss of the fricative /h/ in the suffix /-hu/, /-u/ at the end of a word behaves as its own syllable.[37]\n\nMorphology\n\n[edit]\n\nNominal morphology\n\n[edit]\n\nThe main features marked on Sinhala nouns are case, number, definiteness and animacy.\n\nCases\n\n[edit]\n\nSinhala distinguishes several cases. The five primary cases are the nominative, accusative, dative, genitive, and ablative. Some scholars also suggest that it has a locative and instrumental case. However, for inanimate nouns the locative and genitive, and instrumental and ablative, are identical. In addition, for animate nouns these cases formed by placing atiŋ (\"with the hand\") and laᵑgə (\"near\") directly after the nominative.\n\nThe brackets with most of the vowel length symbols indicate the optional shortening of long vowels in certain unstressed syllables.\n\nanimate inanimate singular plural singular plural nominative miniha(ː) minissu potə pot accusative miniha(ː)və minissu(nvə) dative miniha(ː)ʈə minissu(ɳ)ʈə potəʈə potvələʈə genitive miniha(ː)ge(ː) minissu(ŋ)ge(ː) pote(ː) potvələ locative miniha(ː) laᵑgə minissu(n) laᵑgə ablative miniha(ː)geŋ minissu(n)geŋ poteŋ potvaliŋ instrumental miniha(ː) atiŋ minissu(n) atiŋ vocative miniho(ː) minissuneː - - Gloss 'man' 'men' 'book' 'books'\n\nNumber marking\n\n[edit]\n\nForming plurals in Sinhala is unpredictable. In Sinhala animate nouns, the plural is marked with -o(ː), a long consonant plus -u, or with -la(ː). Most inanimates mark the plural through disfixation. Loanwords from English mark the singular with ekə, and do not mark the plural. This can be interpreted as a singulative number.\n\nSG ammaː deviyaː horaː potə reddə kantoːruvə satiyə bus ekə paːrə PL amməla(ː) deviyo(ː) horu pot redi kantoːru sati bus paːrəval Gloss 'mother(s)' 'god(s)' 'thie(f/ves)' 'book(s)' 'cloth(es)' 'office(s)' 'week(s)' 'bus(es)' 'street(s)'\n\nOn the left hand side of the table, plurals are longer than singulars. On the right hand side, it is the other way round, with the exception of paːrə \"street\". [+Animate] lexemes are mostly in the classes on the left-hand side, while [-animate] lexemes are most often in the classes on the right hand.\n\nIndefinite article\n\n[edit]\n\nThe indefinite article is -ek for animates and -ak for inanimates. The indefinite article exists only in the singular, where its absence marks definiteness. In the plural, (in)definiteness does not receive special marking.\n\nVerbal morphology\n\n[edit]\n\nSinhala distinguishes three conjugation classes. Spoken Sinhala does not mark person, number or gender on the verb (literary Sinhala does). In other words, there is no subject–verb agreement.\n\n1st class 2nd class 3rd class verb verbal adjective verb verbal adjective verb verbal adjective present (future) kanəvaː kanə arinəvaː arinə pipenəvaː pipenə past kæːvaː kæːvə æriyaː æriyə pipunaː pipunə anterior kaːlaː kaːpu ærəlaː ærəpu pipilaː pipicca simultaneous kanə kanə / ka kaa(spoken) arinə arinə / æra æra(spoken) pipenə pipenə/ pipi pipi(spoken) infinitive kannə/kanḍə arinnə/arinḍə pipennə/pipenḍə emphatic form kanneː arinneː pipenneː gloss eat open blossom\n\nSyntax\n\n[edit]\n\nLeft-branching language (see branching), which means that determining elements are usually put in front of what they determine (see example below).\n\nAn exception to this is formed by statements of quantity which usually stand behind what they define.\n\nex.\n\nමල්\n\n/mal\n\nflowers\n\nහතර\n\nhatərə/\n\nfour\n\nමල් හතර\n\n/mal hatərə/\n\nflowers four\n\n\"the four flowers\"\n\n(it can be argued that the numeral is the head in this construction, and the flowers the modifier, so that a more literal English rendering would be \"a floral foursome\")\n\nSOV (subject–object–verb) word order, common to most left-branching languages.\n\nAs is common in left-branching languages, it has no prepositions, only postpositions (see Adposition).\n\nex.\n\nපොත\n\n/potə\n\nbook\n\nයට\n\njaʈə/\n\nunder\n\nපොත යට\n\n/potə jaʈə/\n\nbook under\n\n\"under the book\"\n\nSinhala has no copula. There are two existential verbs, which are used for locative predications, but these verbs are not used for predications of class-membership or property-assignment, unlike English is.\n\nex.\n\nමම\n\n/mamə\n\nI\n\nපොහොසත්\n\npoːsat/\n\nrich\n\nමම පොහොසත්\n\n/mamə poːsat/\n\nI rich\n\n\"I am rich\"\n\nThere are almost no conjunctions as English that or whether, but only non-finite clauses that are formed by the means of participles and verbal adjectives.\n\nex.\n\nපොත්\n\n/pot\n\nbooks\n\nලියන\n\nliənə\n\nwriting\n\nමිනිසා\n\nminisa/\n\nman\n\nපොත් ලියන මිනිසා\n\n/pot liənə minisa/\n\nbooks writing man\n\n\"The man who writes books\"\n\nSemantics\n\n[edit]\n\nThere is a four-way deictic system (which is rare): There are four demonstrative stems (see demonstrative pronouns):\n\nමේ /meː/ \"here, close to the speaker\"\n\nඕ /oː/ \"there, close to the person addressed\"\n\nඅර /arə/ \"there, close to a third person, visible\"\n\nඒ /eː/ \"there, close to a third person, not visible\"\n\nUse of තුමා (thuma)\n\n[edit]\n\nSinhalese has an all-purpose odd suffix තුමා (thuma) which when suffixed to a pronoun creates a formal and respectful tone in reference to a person. This is usually used in referring to politicians, nobles, and priests.\n\ne.g. oba thuma (ඔබ තුමා) - you (vocative, when addressing a minister, high-ranking official, or generally showing respect in public etc.)\n\nex.\n\nජනාධිපති\n\njanadhipathi\n\nතුමා\n\nthuma\n\nජනාධිපති තුමා\n\njanadhipathi thuma\n\nthe president (third person)\n\nDiscourse\n\n[edit]\n\nSinhala is a pro-drop language: Arguments of a sentence can be omitted when they can be inferred from context. This is true for subject—as in Italian, for instance—but also objects and other parts of the sentence can be \"dropped\" in Sinhala if they can be inferred. In that sense, Sinhala can be called a \"super pro-drop language\", like Japanese.\n\nex.\n\nකොහෙද\n\nkoɦedə\n\nwhere\n\nගියේ\n\nɡie\n\nwent\n\nකොහෙද ගියේ\n\nkoɦedə ɡie\n\nwhere went\n\ncan mean \"where did I/you/he/she/we... go\"\n\nSee also\n\n[edit]\n\nSri Lanka portal\n\nLanguages portal\n\nSinhala honorifics\n\nSinhala idioms and proverbs\n\nSinhala keyboard\n\nSinhala numerals\n\nSinhala slang\n\nMadura English–Sinhala Dictionary\n\nList of Sinhala words of Tamil origin\n\nReferences\n\n[edit]\n\nBibliography\n\n[edit]\n\nGair, James: Sinhala and Other South Asian Languages, New York 1998.\n\nIndrapala, Karthigesu (2007).
