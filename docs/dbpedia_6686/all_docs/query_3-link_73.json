        "text": "The braille System is the most adopted writing and reading process in relief worldwide and includes the writing of the alphabet and of mathematical, chemical, phonetic, computer, and musical symbols. This text aims to explain what the braille System is and its importance for the independence of the blind person. In addition to demonstrating the appropriate distance between the points and proving that writing on the conventional slate is the best resource for correct writing in braille, the main objective of the research is to emphasize the importance of using the braille System and to value the conventional slate as a braille writing instrument. From the reading of theoretical texts and writings performed using both slates, the result is even more evident that writing on the conventional slate meets the tactile reading of the blind person, who uses the pad of the index finger to feel the braille dots. Article visualizations:\n\nThe learning system for blind people has been a field of interest for researchers for many decades. Arthur (2000) holds that ancient Egyptians were the first community to show interest to have a talk on these issues relating to visually impaired learners. All the inventions till today, in this field, have been possible by the thorough researches by the experts. Researches are being made and new technologies are being added to thisphenomenon every day. Ranging from Braille to today’s JAWS (a talking software) are the result of those researches. Berthold Lowenfeld (1973) said, “Education must aim at giving the blind child knowledge of the realities around him, the confidence to cope with these realities, and the feeling that he is recognized and accepted as an individual in his own right.” Today the tendency of keeping the visually impaired students separate from the sightedones has been changed: researchers are now thinking about integratedlearning where all the students may get an equal environment for learning.Now, it has come to the researchers’ realization that the blinds have thepotentiality to attend regular schools. With the help of ICT based classroom,it is quite possible to engage the visually impaired learners in a regularclassroom with sighted students. In this integration process, some barriersand limitations have been experienced by the visually impaired learners,especially in developing countries, such as inaccessible classroomenvironment, lack of study material, inappropriate teaching techniques, andshortcoming of resources etc. As a result, in the low and middle-incomecountries, the blind learners are not being able to get the maximum benefitsfrom the use of ICT. However, the main focus of my research is to show the effects of using theeducational technologies to promote learning for the blind learners in lowand middle-income countries i.e. south Asian and African countries. Besides,I intend to analyze the adaptive ability of the visually impaired students inclass rooms and to make necessary suggestions to accelerate the usages ofvarious techniques in this field. In terms of the type of research, this will be an action research asDenscombe (2010, p. 6) maintains that an action research strategy's purposeis to solve a particular problem and to produce guidelines for best practice. Amixed methodological approach will be taken to study the problems. Theresearch will look for finding out the techniques to provide a bettereducational environment for the visually impaired learners in the low andmiddle-income countries. The main objectives of my research are aimed at:Ensuring equal educational environment to provide quality education toall.Removing the barriers between the sighted and the blind students so thatthe blind learners can study more likely as the sighted counterparts. Pave the way to make the education process for the visually impairedlearners more self-dependent. Studying the problems and shortcomings of the usage of ICT in the low and middle-income countries. Finally, making necessary recommendations to make education for theblinds more accessible and less expensive for the people living in themiddle and lower income countries.\n\nOne of the most crucial problems affecting the world today is the scarcity of quality education. In the present era primary education is a basic need but in developing and under developed countries illiteracy is spreading like a plague. The scarcity of education is expected to worsen in the future due to lack of interest, even in countries with significant human resources. The government is providing end numbers of facilities for improving the literacy rate of their country. The paper here proposes a technology which is sufficient to change the slogan from “Each one Teach one” to “Each one Teach everyone”. This paper focuses on providing quality education to each one of us without the help of teacher in the classroom. It also helps in internal assessment of every individual using advanced and flexible storage data base along with their attendance record and behaviour in classroom."
