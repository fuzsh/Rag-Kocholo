It belongs to the Indo-Aryan language family and is closely related to other languages spoken in the Indian subcontinent, such as Hindi and Bengali.\n\nSinhalese is a tonal language with three distinct tones that change the meaning of words. It uses the Sinhalese script, which is a descendant of the Brahmi script used to write ancient Indian languages. Sinhalese has a rich literary tradition, with a long history of poetry, prose, and religious texts written in the language.\n\nSinhalese has a relatively complex grammar, with subject-object-verb word order and the use of particles to indicate tense, aspect, and mood. The language also includes several honorific and polite forms of address, reflecting the hierarchical nature of Sri Lankan society."
