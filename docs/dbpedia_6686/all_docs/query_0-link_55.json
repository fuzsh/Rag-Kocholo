        "text": "Data Aggregation (Roll-Up)\n\nKaiser Permanente’s collection framework is asking the two part question separately (Combined Format and Granular Ethnicity), thereby eliminating the need/use of automatic linkage and data aggregation (commonly known as “roll-up”). Data aggregation should be specific to the research and/or reporting needs for the population groups under study/report.\n\nAutomatic linkage or aggregation would produce deteriorated or inaccurate data if patients are linked/aggregated in a way that contradicts or misrepresents their personal self-identification, especially for multiracial persons who identify with more than one federal ‘Race’/’Ethnicity’ standard.\n\nThe effects of globalization, population displacement, and social movements are undermining the capacity of one nation to fix a person's identity. Simply, national or geographic origin does not automatically determine one's race or ethnicity, nor does ethnicity determine race, nor does race determine ethnicity.\n\nData aggregation without the consideration of the intersecting layers that construct identity would be similar to suggesting that 'American' or being born in the United States could be automatically linked/aggregated into 'White'.\n\nThe Combined Format and Granular Ethnicity fields were developed as two separate questions to achieve health care, research, compliance, reporting, and resource allocation needs. As importantly, it ensures the patient's right to self-identify as well as ensures the highest data quality and integrity."
