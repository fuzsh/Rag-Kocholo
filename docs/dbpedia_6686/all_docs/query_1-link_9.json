They are largest ethnic group of Sri Lanka. It belongs to the Indo-Aryan language family.\n\nSinhala has two varieties/forms - Spoken and Written, the former being the most popular form. Spoken Sinhala is easier to learn and use because it is so much relaxed in grammatical formality and rigidity.\n\nSinhala is spoken by about 19 million people in Sri Lanka, about 16 million of them are native speakers. It is one of the constitutionally-recognised official languages of Sri Lanka, with Tamil. Sinhala has its own writing system (see Sinhala script) which is an offspring of the Indian Brahmi script.\n\nThe oldest Sinhala inscriptions were written in the 3rd and 2nd centuries BC; the oldest existing literary works date from the 9th century AD.\n\nThe closest relative of Sinhala is Dhivehi, the language of the Maldives, .\n\nThe word order of Sinhala language is SOV (subject-object-verb) just like Japanese, Korean and many other languages in Asia. It would be easy for people from that particular language style to learn Sinhala with a little time and practice.\n\nEx 1 : I home go Mama gedara yanawa. Ex 2 : beautiful dress Lassana anduma\n\nMorphologically, the words are built with the stem followed by a particle. The particle can vary so that it adds more grammatical change into the word connecting it to the whole sentence.\n\npusa yanawa - kitten is going. pusath yanawa - kitten is also going.\n\nballata denawa - giving (it) to the dog ballatath denawa giving it to the dog as well ballatama denawa giving it to the dog itself.\n\nIf you really take a good look at these sentences, you may easily find the stem of the words: pusa, pusath; ballata, ballathath, ballatama.\n\npusa- is the stem of the subjectival phrase. (kitten)\n\nPusa + th - as well\n\npusa + ta - to kitty\n\npusa + ta + th - to kitty as well\n\npusa + ta + ma - to kitty itself ^^\n\nWriting system\n\nMain articles: Sinhala script and Sinhala Braille\n\nImages for kids\n\nLetters of the Sinhala script.\n\nSee also"
