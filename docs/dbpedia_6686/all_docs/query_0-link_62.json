A research project conducted in the field of economics, engineering, international development, mathematics, political science, public health, science, comparative or international education, or technology. Invitational Priority: For FY 2017, this priority is an invitational priority. Under 34 CFR 75.105(c)(1), we do not give an application that meets this invitational priority a competitive or absolute preference over other applications. This priority is: Applications from Minority-Serving Institutions. For purposes of this invitational priority, Minority-Serving Institution means an institution that is eligible to receive assistance under part A of title III, under part B of title III, or under title V of the Higher Education Act of 1965, as amended. Program Authority: 22 U.S.C. 2452(b)(6). Applicable Regulations: (a) The Education Department General Administrative Regulations (EDGAR) in 34 CFR parts 75, 77, 81, 82, 84, 86, 97, 98, and 99. (b) The OMB Guidelines to Agencies on Governmentwide Debarment and Suspension (Nonprocurement) in 2 CFR part 180, as adopted and amended as regulations of the Department in 2 CFR part 3485. (c) The Uniform Administrative Requirements, Cost Principles, and Audit Requirements for Federal Awards in 2 CFR part 200, as adopted and amended as regulations of the Department in 2 CFR part 3474. (d) The [[Page 4318]] regulations for this program in 34 CFR part 662. Note: The regulations in 34 CFR part 86 apply to institutions of higher education (IHEs) only. II. Award Information Type of Award: Discretionary grants redistributed as fellowships to individual beneficiaries. Estimated Available Funds: $3,477,151. Estimated Range of Awards: $15,000 to $60,000. Estimated Average Size of Awards: $33,461. Estimated Number of Awards: 98. Note: The Department is not bound by any estimates in this notice. Project Period: The institutional project period is 18 months, beginning October 1, 2017. Students may request funding for a period of no less than six months and no more than 12 months. III. Eligibility Information 1. Eligible Applicants: IHEs. As part of the application process, students submit individual applications to the IHE. The IHE then officially submits all eligible individual student applications with its grant application to the Department. Note: As part of its FY 2017 budget request, the Administration proposed to continue to allow funds to be used to support the applications of individuals who plan both to utilize their language skills in world areas vital to United States national security and to apply their language skills and knowledge of these countries in the fields of government, international development, and the professions. Therefore, students planning to apply their language skills in such fields and those planning teaching careers are eligible to apply to IHEs for funds from this program. 2. Cost Sharing or Matching: This program does not require cost sharing or matching. IV. Application and Submission Information 1. Address to Request Application Package: Both IHEs and student applicants can obtain an application package via the Internet or from the Education Publications Center (ED PUBS). To obtain a copy via the Internet, use the following address: www.G5.gov. To obtain a copy from ED Pubs, write, fax, or call the following: ED Pubs, U.S. Department of Education, P.O.

Content and Form of Application Submission: Requirements concerning the content and form of an application, together with the forms the applicant must submit, are in the application package for this program. Page Limit: The application narrative is where the student applicant addresses the selection criteria that reviewers use to evaluate the application. The student applicant must limit the application narrative to no more than 10 pages and the bibliography to no more than two pages, using the following standards: A ``page'' is 8.5'' x 11'', on one side only, with 1'' margins at the top, bottom, both sides, and portrait orientation. Note: For purposes of determining compliance with the page limits, each page on which there are words will be counted as one full page. Double space (no more than three lines per vertical inch) all text in the application narrative. However, student applicants may single space all text in charts, tables, figures, graphs, titles, headings, footnotes, endnotes, quotations, bibliography, and captions. Use a font that is either 12 point or larger, or no smaller than 10 pitch (characters per inch). Student applicants may use a 10-point font in charts, tables, figures, graphs, footnotes, and endnotes. However, these items are considered part of the narrative and counted within the 10-page limit. Use one of the following fonts: Times New Roman, Courier, Courier New, or Arial. An application submitted in any other font (including Times Roman or Arial Narrow) will not be accepted. The page limits only apply to the application narrative and bibliography. The page limits do not apply to the Application for Federal Assistance face sheet (SF 424), the supplemental information form required by the Department of Education, or the assurances and certification. However, student applicants must include their complete responses to the selection criteria in the application narrative. We will reject a student applicant's application if the application exceeds the page limits. 3. Submission Dates and Times: Applications Available: January 13, 2017. Deadline for Transmittal of Applications: March 14, 2017. Applications for grants under this program must be submitted electronically using G5, the Department's grant management system, accessible through the Department's G5 site. For information (including dates and times) about how to submit an IHE's application electronically, or in paper format by mail or hand delivery if an IHE qualifies for an exception to the electronic submission requirement, please refer to Other Submission Requirements in section IV of this notice. We do not consider an application that does not comply with the deadline requirements. Individuals with disabilities who need an accommodation or auxiliary aid in connection with the application process should contact the person listed under FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT in section VII of this notice. If the Department provides an accommodation or auxiliary aid to an individual with a disability in connection with the application process, the individual's application remains subject to all other requirements and limitations in this notice. 4. Intergovernmental Review: This program is not subject to Executive Order 12372 and the regulations in 34 CFR part 79. 5. Funding Restrictions: We reference regulations outlining funding restrictions in the Applicable Regulations section of this notice. 6. Data Universal Numbering System Number, Taxpayer Identification Number, and System for Award Management: To do business with the Department of Education, you must-- a. Have a Data Universal Numbering System (DUNS) number and a Taxpayer Identification Number (TIN); b. Register both your DUNS number and TIN with the System for Award Management (SAM), the Government's primary registrant database; c. Provide your DUNS number and TIN on your application; and d. Maintain an active SAM registration with current information while your application is under review by the Department and, if you are awarded a grant, during the project period. [[Page 4319]] You can obtain a DUNS number from Dun and Bradstreet at the following Web site: http://fedgov.dnb.com/webform. A DUNS number can be created within one to two business days. If you are a corporate entity, agency, institution, or organization, you can obtain a TIN from the Internal Revenue Service. If you are an individual, you can obtain a TIN from the Internal Revenue Service or the Social Security Administration. If you need a new TIN, please allow two to five weeks for your TIN to become active. The SAM registration process can take approximately seven business days, but may take upwards of several weeks, depending on the completeness and accuracy of the data you enter into the SAM database. Thus, if you think you might want to apply for Federal financial assistance under a program administered by the Department, please allow sufficient time to obtain and register your DUNS number and TIN. We strongly recommend that you register early. Note: Once your SAM registration is active, it may be 24 to 48 hours before you can submit an application through G5. If you are currently registered with SAM, you may not need to make any changes. However, please make certain that the TIN associated with your DUNS number is correct. Also note that you will need to update your registration annually. This may take three or more business days. Information about SAM is available at www.SAM.gov. To further assist you with obtaining and registering your DUNS number and TIN in SAM or updating your existing SAM account, we have prepared a SAM.gov Tip Sheet, which you can find at: www2.ed.gov/fund/grant/apply/sam-faqs.html. 7. Other Submission Requirements: Applications for grants under this program must be submitted electronically unless an IHE qualifies for an exception to this requirement in accordance with the instructions in this section. a. Electronic Submission of Applications. Applications for grants under the Fulbright-Hays DDRA Fellowship Program, CFDA number 84.022A, must be submitted electronically using the G5 system, accessible through the Department's G5 site at: www.G5.gov. While completing the electronic application, both the IHE and the student applicant will be entering data online that will be saved into a database. Neither the IHE nor the student applicant may email an electronic copy of a grant application to us. We will reject an application if an IHE submits it in paper format unless, as described elsewhere in this section, the IHE qualifies for one of the exceptions to the electronic submission requirement and submits, no later than two weeks before the application deadline date, a written statement to the Department that the IHE qualifies for one of these exceptions. Further information regarding calculation of the date that is two weeks before the application deadline date is provided later in this section under Exception to Electronic Submission Requirement. Please note the following: The process for submitting applications electronically under the Fulbright-Hays DDRA Fellowship Program has several parts. The following is a brief summary of the process; however, all applicants should review and follow the detailed description of the application process that is contained in the application package. In summary, the major steps are: (1) IHEs must email the following information to [email protected]: Name of university and full name and email address of potential project director. We recommend that applicant IHEs submit this information as soon as possible to ensure that they obtain access to G5 well before the application deadline date. We suggest that IHEs send this information no later than two weeks prior to the closing date in order to facilitate timely submission of their applications; (2) Students must complete their individual applications and submit them to their IHE's project director using G5; (3) Persons providing references for individual students must complete and submit reference forms for the students and submit them to the IHE's project director using G5; and (4) The IHE's project director must officially submit the IHE's application, which must include all eligible individual student applications, reference forms, and other required forms, using G5. The IHE must complete the electronic submission of the grant application by 4:30:00 p.m., Washington, DC time, on the application deadline date. G5 will not accept an application for this competition after 4:30:00 p.m., Washington, DC time, on the application deadline date. Therefore, we strongly recommend that both the IHE and the student applicant not wait until the application deadline date to begin the application process. The hours of operation of the G5 Web site are 6:00 a.m. Monday until 9:00 p.m., Wednesday; and 6:00 a.m. Thursday until 3:00 p.m., Sunday, Washington, DC time. Please note that, because of maintenance, the system is unavailable between 3:00 p.m. on Sundays and 6:00 a.m. on Mondays, and between 9:00 p.m. on Wednesdays and 6:00 a.m. on Thursdays, Washington, DC time. Any modifications to these hours are posted on the G5 Web site. Student applicants will not receive additional point value because the student submits his or her application in electronic format, nor will we penalize the IHE or student applicant if the applicant qualifies for an exception to the electronic submission requirement, as described elsewhere in this section, and submits an application in paper format. IHEs must submit all documents electronically, including all information typically provided on the following forms: The Application for Federal Assistance (SF 424), the Department of Education Supplemental Information for SF 424, Budget Information--Non- Construction Programs (ED 524), and all necessary assurances and certifications. Both IHEs and student applicants must upload any narrative sections and all other attachments to their application as files in a read-only, non-modifiable Portable Document Format (PDF). Do not upload an interactive or fillable PDF file. If you upload a file type other than a read-only, non-modifiable PDF (e.g., Word, Excel, WordPerfect, etc.) or submit a password-protected file, we will not review that material. Please note that this could result in your application not being considered for funding because the material in question--for example, the application narrative--is critical to a meaningful review of your proposal. For that reason it is important to allow yourself adequate time to upload all material as PDF files. The Department will not convert material from other formats to PDF. Student transcripts must be submitted electronically through the G5 system. Both the IHE's and the student applicant's electronic applications must comply with any page limit requirements described in this notice. Prior to submitting your electronic application, you may wish to print a copy of it for your records. After the individual student applicant electronically submits his or her application to the student's IHE, the student will receive an automatic [[Page 4320]] acknowledgment. After a person submits a reference electronically, he or she will receive an online confirmation. After the applicant IHE submits its application, including all eligible individual student applications, to the Department, the applicant IHE will receive an automatic acknowledgment that will include a unique PR/Award number for the IHE's application. Within three working days after submitting its electronic application-- (1) Print SF 424 from G5; (2) The applicant IHE's Authorizing Representative must sign this form; (3) Place the PR/Award number in the upper right-hand corner of the hard-copy signature page of the SF 424; and (4) Fax the signed SF 424 to the Application Control Center at (202) 245-6272. We may request that you provide us original signatures on other forms at a later date. Application Deadline Date Extension in Case of System Unavailability: If an IHE is prevented from electronically submitting its application on the application deadline date because the G5 system is unavailable, we will grant the IHE an extension until 4:30:00 p.m., Washington, DC time, the following business day to enable the IHE to transmit its application electronically, by mail, or by hand delivery. We will grant this extension if-- (1) The IHE is a registered user of the G5 system and the IHE has initiated an electronic application for this competition; and (2)(a) G5 is unavailable for 60 minutes or more between the hours of 8:30 a.m. and 3:30 p.m., Washington, DC time, on the application deadline date; or (b) G5 is unavailable for any period of time between 3:30 p.m. and 4:30:00 p.m., Washington, DC time, on the application deadline date. We must acknowledge and confirm these periods of unavailability before granting the IHE an extension. To request this extension or to confirm our acknowledgment of any system unavailability, an IHE may contact either (1) the person listed under FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT in section VII of this notice or (2) the e-Grants help desk at 1-888-336-8930. If G5 is unavailable due to technical problems with the system and, therefore, the application deadline is extended, an email will be sent to all registered users who have initiated a G5 application. Extensions referred to in this section apply only to the unavailability of the G5 system. Exception to Electronic Submission Requirement: An IHE qualifies for an exception to the electronic submission requirement, and may submit its application in paper format, if the IHE is unable to submit an application through G5 because-- The IHE or a student applicant does not have access to the Internet; or The IHE or a student applicant does not have the capacity to upload large documents to G5; and No later than two weeks before the application deadline date (14 calendar days or, if the fourteenth calendar day before the application deadline date falls on a Federal holiday, the next business day following the Federal holiday), the IHE mails or faxes a written statement to the Department, explaining which of the two grounds for an exception prevents the IHE from using the Internet to submit its application. If an IHE mails a written statement to the Department, it must be postmarked no later than two weeks before the application deadline date. If an IHE faxes its written statement to the Department, we must receive the faxed statement no later than two weeks before the application deadline date. Address and mail or fax this statement to: Mariam Ouhamou, U.S. Department of Education, 400 Maryland Ave. SW., Room 3E207, Washington, DC 20202-4260. Telephone: (202) 453-6764 or by email: [email protected]. The IHE's paper application must be submitted in accordance with the mail or hand delivery instructions described in this notice. b. Submission of Paper Applications by Mail. If an IHE qualifies for an exception to the electronic submission requirement, the IHE may mail (through the U.S. Postal Service or a commercial carrier) its application to the Department. The IHE must mail the original and two copies of the application, on or before the application deadline date, to the Department at the following address: U.S. Department of Education, Application Control Center, Attention: (CFDA Number 84.022A), LBJ Basement Level 1, 400 Maryland Avenue SW., Washington, DC 20202-4260. The IHE must show proof of mailing consisting of one of the following: (1) A legibly dated U.S. Postal Service postmark. (2) A legible mail receipt with the date of mailing stamped by the U.S. Postal Service. (3) A dated shipping label, invoice, or receipt from a commercial carrier. (4) Any other proof of mailing acceptable to the Secretary of the U.S. Department of Education. If the IHE mails its application through the U.S. Postal Service, we do not accept either of the following as proof of mailing: (1) A private metered postmark. (2) A mail receipt that is not dated by the U.S. Postal Service. Note: The U.S. Postal Service does not uniformly provide a dated postmark. Before relying on this method, the IHE should check with its local post office. We will not consider applications postmarked after the application deadline date. c. Submission of Paper Applications by Hand Delivery. If an IHE qualifies for an exception to the electronic submission requirement, the IHE (or a courier service) may deliver its paper application to the Department by hand. The IHE must deliver the original and two copies of the application, by hand, on or before the application deadline date, to the Department at the following address: U.S. Department of Education, Application Control Center, Attention: (CFDA Number 84.022A), 550 12th Street SW., Room 7039, Potomac Center Plaza, Washington, DC 20202-4260. The Application Control Center accepts hand deliveries daily between 8:00 a.m. and 4:30:00 p.m., Washington, DC time, except Saturdays, Sundays, and Federal holidays. Note for Mail or Hand Delivery of Paper Applications: If an IHE mails or hand delivers its application to the Department-- (1) The IHE must indicate on the envelope and--if not provided by the Department--in Item 11 of the SF 424 the CFDA number, including suffix letter, if any, of the competition under which the IHE is submitting its application; and (2) The Application Control Center will mail a notification of receipt of the IHE's grant application. If the IHE does not receive this grant notification within 15 business days from the application deadline date, the IHE should call the U.S. Department of Education Application Control Center at (202) 245-6288. V. Application Review Information 1. General: For FY 2017, student applications are divided into seven categories based on the world area focus of their research projects, as described in the absolute priority listed in this notice. Language and area studies experts in discrete world area-based panels will review the student applications. Each panel reviews, scores, and ranks its applications separately from the applications assigned to the other world area panels. However, all fellowship applications will be ranked together from the highest to lowest score for funding purposes. 2. Selection Criteria: The selection criteria for this competition are from the [[Page 4321]] regulations for this program in 34 CFR 662.21 and are listed in the application package. 3. Review and Selection Process: We remind potential applicants that in reviewing applications in any discretionary grant competition, the Secretary may consider, under 34 CFR 75.217(d)(3), the past performance of the applicant in carrying out a previous award, such as the applicant's use of funds, achievement of project objectives, and compliance with grant conditions. The Secretary may also consider whether the applicant failed to submit a timely performance report or submitted a report of unacceptable quality. In addition, in making a competitive grant award, the Secretary requires various assurances including those applicable to Federal civil rights laws that prohibit discrimination in programs or activities receiving Federal financial assistance from the Department of Education (34 CFR 100.4, 104.5, 106.4, 108.8, and 110.23). Under 34 CFR 662.22(b), no applicant may receive grants from the Fulbright U.S. Student Program (FUSP) and the Fulbright-Hays DDRA Fellowship Program concurrently. Once a candidate has accepted an award from FUSP and FUSP has expended funds on the student, the student is then ineligible for a grant under the Fulbright-Hays DDRA Fellowship Program. A student applying for a grant under the Fulbright-Hays DDRA Fellowship Program must indicate on the application if the student has currently applied for a FUSP grant. If, at any point, the candidate accepts a FUSP award prior to being notified of the candidate's status with the Fulbright-Hays DDRA Fellowship Program, the candidate should immediately notify the program contact person listed under FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT in section VII of this notice. If, after consultation with FUSP, we determine that FUSP has expended funds on the student (e.g., the candidate has attended the pre-departure orientation or was issued grant funds), the candidate will be deemed ineligible for an award under the Fulbright-Hays DDRA Fellowship Program at that time. 4. Risk Assessment and Special Conditions: Consistent with 2 CFR 200.205, before awarding grants under this program the Department conducts a review of the risks posed by applicants. Under 2 CFR 3474.10, the Secretary may impose special conditions and, in appropriate circumstances, high-risk conditions on a grant if the applicant or grantee is not financially stable; has a history of unsatisfactory performance; has a financial or other management system that does not meet the standards in 2 CFR part 200, subpart D; has not fulfilled the conditions of a prior grant; or is otherwise not responsible. 5. Integrity and Performance System: If you are selected under this competition to receive an award that over the course of the project period may exceed the simplified acquisition threshold (currently $150,000), under 2 CFR 200.205(a)(2) we must make a judgment about your integrity, business ethics, and record of performance under Federal awards--that is, the risk posed by you as an applicant--before we make an award. In doing so, we must consider any information about you that is in the integrity and performance system (currently referred to as the Federal Awardee Performance and Integrity Information System (FAPIIS)), accessible through SAM. You may review and comment on any information about yourself that a Federal agency previously entered and that is currently in FAPIIS. Please note that, if the total value of your currently active grants, cooperative agreements, and procurement contracts from the Federal Government exceeds $10,000,000, the reporting requirements in 2 CFR part 200, Appendix XII, require you to report certain integrity information to FAPIIS semiannually. Please review the requirements in 2 CFR part 200, Appendix XII, if this grant plus all the other Federal funds you receive exceed $10,000,000. VI. Award Administration Information 1. Award Notices: If a student application is successful, we notify the IHE's U.S. Representative and U.S. Senators and send the IHE a Grant Award Notification (GAN); or we may send the IHE an email containing a link to access an electronic version of the GAN. We may notify the IHE informally, also. If a student application is not evaluated or not selected for funding, we notify the IHE. 2. Administrative and National Policy Requirements: We identify administrative and national policy requirements in the application package and reference these and other requirements in the Applicable Regulations section of this notice. We reference the regulations outlining the terms and conditions of an award in the Applicable Regulations section of this notice and include these and other specific conditions in the GAN. The GAN also incorporates the approved application as part of the binding commitments under the grant. 3. Reporting: (a) If you apply for a grant under this competition, you must ensure that you have in place the necessary processes and systems to comply with the reporting requirements in 2 CFR part 170 should you receive funding under the competition. This does not apply if you have an exception under 2 CFR 170.110(b). (b) At the end of your project period, you must submit a final performance report, including financial information, as directed by the Secretary. If you receive a multiyear award, you must submit an annual performance report that provides the most current performance and financial expenditure information as directed by the Secretary under 34 CFR 75.118. Grantees are required to use the electronic data instrument International Resource Information System (IRIS) to complete the final report. The Secretary may also require more frequent performance reports under 34 CFR 75.720(c). For specific requirements on reporting, please go to www.ed.gov/fund/grant/apply/appforms/appforms.html. 4. Performance Measures: Under the Government Performance and Results Act of 1993 (GPRA), the objective for the Fulbright-Hays DDRA Fellowship Program is to provide grants to colleges and universities to fund individual doctoral students to conduct research in other countries in modern foreign languages and area studies for periods of 6 to 12 months. The Department will use the following measures to evaluate its success in meeting this objective: DDRA GPRA Measure 1: The percentage of DDRA fellows who increased their foreign language scores in speaking, reading, and/or writing by at least one proficiency level. DDRA GPRA Measure 2: The percentage of DDRA fellows who complete their degree in their program of study within four years of receipt of the fellowship. DDRA GPRA Measure 3: The percentage of DDRA fellows who found employment that utilized their language and area studies skills within eight years of receiving their award.
