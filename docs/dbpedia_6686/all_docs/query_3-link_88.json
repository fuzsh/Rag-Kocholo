        "text": "Welcome to the website about keyboard layouts in Windows.\n\nWindows distinguishes input languages, keyboard layouts and keyboard drivers. Input language informs the system what language is the typed text supposedly in, which is used for features like spellchecking. Technically any keyboard layout can be used for any input language, but recent Windows versions started limiting which layouts can be selected for a given language in the user interface. All supported keyboard layouts are defined in the registry, under HKLM\\SYSTEM\\CurrentControlSet\\Control\\Keyboard Layouts. The subkeys identify the keyboard layouts (using KLID) and contain layout names as seen by the user, as well as references to the keyboard driver that defines which keys produce which characters. Several keyboard layouts can share one keyboard driver.\n\nThis data come from Windows 10.0.26241.5000, which contains 214 keyboard drivers and supports 215 keyboard layouts. Pick the one you are interested in:\n\nBy features\n\nBy KLID or layout name\n\nJump to: A B C D E F G H I J K L M N O P R S T U V W Y\n\nBy driver file name or description\n\nJump to: A B C D E F G H I J K L M N O P R S T U V W Y\n\nNote that the following drivers are not referenced by any of the supported layouts:\n\nkbd101.dll, kbd101a.dll, kbd101b.dll, kbd101c.dll, kbd103.dll, kbd106.dll, kbd106n.dll, kbdax2.dll, kbdibm02.dll, kbdlk41a.dll, kbdnec.dll, kbdnec95.dll, kbdnecat.dll, kbdnecnt.dll.\n\nCustom made keyboard layouts\n\nI am happy to include any custom keyboard layouts created by users, either with the help of Microsoft Keyboard Layout Creator or the Windows Driver Kit. If you would like to share your layout this way, feel free to e-mail me and include the details to put in the table below. Please note I cannot support IMEs or any other drivers that do not use KBDTABLES.\n\nThese drivers can be installed on any Windows NT version, including Windows XP and newer."
