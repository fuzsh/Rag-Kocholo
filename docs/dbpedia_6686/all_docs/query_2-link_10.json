        "meta_description": "The Braille system is a tactile format of written communication for visually-impaired people worldwide. Early days Braille embossed on papers done manually and now use machines as well. Sighted people do not understand these codes. Sighted society motivated the development of Optical Braille Recognition for different languages such as English, Arabic, and Chinese. Mostly, in Sri Lankan context, this problem occurs in education systems such as universities, schools because the documents written by blind students such as exam papers, evaluation works has to send to a braille translator before marking. This research addresses the issue of written communication gap between Sinhala blind and sighted people. Braille dots composing characters are identified on single sided documents of average quality with maximum accuracy. Work present executable system including proposed methods in order to transcript to recognized braille characters. Introduce of new extraction methods of Braille characters from a Braille document and decoding them into Sinhala characters. Then the decoded Sinhala characters are normalized to Sinhala text which is in human-understandable form.",
