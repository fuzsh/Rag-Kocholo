        "text": "Sound fiscal management; to ensure that the revenue to support investments in Sri Lankaâs social and economic priorities is raised and spent in a fair, responsible and efficient way.\n\nPrecision poverty reduction; allocation of modern technologies to identify poor households through 50 indicators evaluating key factors that contribute to poverty in these households; and allocate investments to reduce poverty levels to that of a developed nation.\n\nDevelopment of human capital; prioritise upgrading of primary, secondary and tertiary education, and ensure enrolment of 50% of total 360,000 students per annum to public and private universities. Rebrand and upgrade the quality of Technical, Vocational and Educational Training (TVET) and ensure enrolment of 40% of total 360,000 students per annum to TVET education, thereby only 10% of total students per annum fall into the unskilled labour market.\n\nSound social policy framework; to support the Governmentâs efforts to promote equal opportunities for all citizens across the country and to meet the Governmentâs priorities for promoting jobs, transforming the agricultural sector (inclusive of increasing agricultural productivity of farmers, farmersâ household income, equitable consumption of a safe, affordable, nutritious diet year around and womenâs empowerment in agriculture) and economic growth.\n\nInclusive and sustainable economic growth; to create the conditions necessary for a strong, longâterm and clean economic growth, thereby increasing the standard of living and wellâbeing of Sri Lankans.\n\nSri Lankan population growth per annum is an average of 190,000. Therefore, in order to maintain the current economy, it is necessary to create an additional 62,400 jobs per annum.\n\nOkunâs law states that for every 1% decrease in the unemployment rate, gross domestic product increases by 3%.\n\nEstablish and implement a district-wise job generation plan to decrease unemployment. This is to be monitored monthly and Government to aid private sector investments.\n\nThe Laffer curve illustrates a relationship between rates of taxation and the resulting levels of Government revenue. It illustrates the concept of taxable income elasticity i.e., taxable income changes in response to changes in the rate of taxation.\n\nA key reason for the lack of investments into the Country at present is due to incorrect tax rates as our current rates tax investors higher than our competitors, thereby discouraging investments into the country.\n\nTherefore, it is required to maintain a tax rate at the revenue maximising point in order to attract the highest possible investments into the country.\n\nChanging the tax and customs duty policies, to increase greenfield and brownfield, local investments and foreign direct investments, is necessary for economic growth, increased district-wise job generation and goods and service exports.\n\nItem Income Tax\n\n(Direct Tax)\n\n(Rs. million) Total Government Revenue\n\n(Rs. million) % of Direct Tax of Total Government Revenue % of Indirect Tax of Total Government Revenue Exchange loss as a result of Rupee Depreciation Foreign Debt\n\n(Rs. million) 2005 52,535 379,747 13.80% 86.20% 117,785 956,620 2006 79,693 477,833 16.70% 83.30% 108,579 1,103,418 2007 107,169 565,051 19.00% 81.00% 71,646 1,326,487 2008 126,541 655,260 19.30% 80.70% 117,785 1,448,734 2009 139,558 699,644 19.90% 80.10% 23,114 1,760,467 2010 135,624 817,279 16.60% 83.40% -10,028 2,024,583 2011 157,310 967,862 16.30% 83.70% 90,335 2,329,280 2012 172,594 1,051,462 16.40% 83.60% 230,642 2,767,299 2013 205,666 1,137,447 18.10% 81.90% -15,361 2,960,424 2014 198,115 1,195,206 16.60% 83.40% -89,335 3,113,116 2015 262,583 1,454,878 18.00% 82.00% 285,091 3,544,031 2016 258,857 1,686,061 15.40% 84.60% 186,650 4,045,796 2017 274,562 1,831,531 15.00% 85.00% 225,223 4,718,618 2018 310,450 1,919,974 16.20% 83.80% 1,063,218 5,959,547 Total 2,481,257 2,405,344\n\nIncome Tax\n\n(Direct Tax)\n\n=\n\nCorporate and Non-Corporate Tax\n\n+\n\nPay As You Earn Tax (PAYE)\n\n+\n\nEconomic\n\nService Charge\n\n+\n\nTax on Interest\n\nIncome\n\nACTION PLAN\n\nDuring the past 14 years direct Government tax revenue on a cumulative basis was Rs. 2,481 billion whereas Rs. 2,405 billion was incurred as an additional payment due to rupee depreciation to make foreign borrowings increase to Rs. 5,959 billion by last year. Therefore, to stop the rupee depreciating beyond 2% - 3% it is essential to bring in investments, especially foreign direct investments and enhance exports regardless of the direct tax revenue.\n\nPolicies relating to the Department of Inland Revenue\n\nTotal Government revenue in 2018 was Rs. 1,919 billion. Introduce an Artificial Intelligence (AI) based monitoring system to both Customs and the Department of Inland Revenue for the purpose of monitoring evasions (after introducing IBM Watson in Switzerland Customs revenue increased by 10%) after which, Government revenue will be increased by 15%, generating an additional Rs. 287 billion.\n\nMaintain the current rate of corporate tax for the following industries;\n\nFinancial services, except insurance and pension funding\n\nWholesale trade except of motor vehicle and motor cycles\n\nManufacture of tobacco products\n\nTelecommunication\n\nGambling and betting activities\n\nWhilst reducing the current rate of dividend tax and capital gain tax to 0%\n\n(which will help in additional job generation).\n\nReduce the current rate of corporate tax to 0% and provide a guarantee for new ventures through an agreement with the BOI, at the reduced rate for the next 25 years for industries;\n\nEducation\n\nInformation service activities\n\n(Any type of BPO, KPO, provision of infrastructure for hosting, data processing services and related activities, web portals, news syndicates and news agency activities furnishing news, pictures and features to the media, computer based telephone information services, information search services on a contract or fee basis and news clipping services, press clipping services and other digital services)\n\nHuman health activities\n\nAir transport\n\nManufacture of motor vehicles, trailers and semi-trailers\n\nWaste collection, treatment and disposal activities; materials recovery\n\nWater collection, treatment and supply\n\nSewerage\n\nManufacture of other transport equipment\n\nFishing and aquaculture\n\nRemediation activities and other waste management services\n\nReduce the current rate of corporate tax to 12% for existing ventures not mentioned in points 1 and 2.\n\nReduce the current rate of corporate tax to 12% for new ventures not mentioned in points 1 and 2 and provide a guarantee for the reduced rate for the next 25 years for all sectors (in the Western Province) and for the other eight provinces to be granted a discount of 80%, thereby charging an effective rate of 2.4% (which will help in additional rural district-wise job generation).\n\nPAYE tax of 12% will only be charged starting from a monthly income bracket of Rs. 500,000.\n\nPolicies relating to Sri Lanka Customs\n\nTotal Government revenue in 2018 was Rs. 1,919 billion. Introduce an Artificial Intelligence (AI) based monitoring system to both Customs and the Department of Inland Revenue for the purpose of monitoring evasions (after introducing IBM Watson in Switzerland Customs revenue increased by 10%) after which, Government revenue will be increased by 15%, generating an additional Rs. 287 billion.\n\nOut of the prevailing 7,162 HS Codes in Customs, 90% of the Customs revenue is generated through 500 HS codes (6-digit). The tax structure of these 500 HS codes that generate 90% of the Customs revenue is to be restructured, benchmarking that of Malaysia, Thailand and India (that will help local industries and create additional jobs). As a result, Customs revenue can be increased by 10%.\n\nGovernment capital investments\n\nGovernment capital investments, also known as the Public Investments Programme (PIP), where the benefits span many generations of Sri Lankans, paying for them through some borrowing is fairer and more efficient.\n\nBorrowings will be made in a responsible and sustainable manner to help instil financial discipline and distribute the share of funding more equitably across current and future generations.\n\nGovernment recurrent spending\n\nRecurrent spending needs in areas such as precision poverty reduction, primary, secondary, university, technical and vocational (TVET) education is to be recognised as necessary expenditures.\n\nCurrently Sri Lanka takes the easier route by funding some of these recurrent expenditures through borrowings. This is not ideal in the long-run, as such borrowings shift the burden of paying for todayâs needs onto future generations. A fairer and more robust approach is to meet recurrent spending with recurrent revenue. Hence, we must continually review our tax system to ensure its resilience.\n\nFuture policy and strategy planning for Sri Lanka\n\nThe Ministry of Finance and Planning should be responsible for future policies and strategic planning for Sri Lanka.\n\nAny policy proposed in the budget to have an economic analysis, that the Ministry of Finance can use to validate proposed policies.\n\nImplement a Management Information System (MIS) to track the progress of budget promises.\n\nAsset management systems to be implemented to monitor and ensure maximum utilisation of Government assets and resources.\n\nAllocate an additional budget of Rs. 200 billion with a 10% annual increment for primary, university and technical and vocational education.\n\nIntroduce five new types of biscuits for the five days of the week which can be obtained free of charge by producing the coupon provided under the precision poverty reduction programme for school children who cannot afford breakfast. These new types of biscuits also to be made available for purchase through markets.\n\nAlso, continue the provision of free text books, and further provide, school uniforms, socks and shoes from preschool to secondary school level, through the precision poverty reduction programme.\n\nFund private sector to build, standardise and upgrade preschools.\n\nFacilitate video-based and other necessary teacher training for pre-schools.\n\nDevelop 771 schools under provincial councils with fully-fledged facilities to match the standards of national schools.\n\n2 schools each from the 276 divisional councils (552 schools).\n\n3 schools each from the 41 urban councils (123 schools).\n\n4 schools each from 24 municipal councils (96 schools).\n\nSame national level popular school names and management to be followed at these 771 schools.\n\nSelect schools with sufficient land and build infrastructure in order to increase student capacity by 1,500. As a result, in all 771 schools, capacity will increase by an average of 1,500 students resulting in a total increase by 1,156,500 students.\n\nFollowing which, competition for grade 1 student entrance will be reduced from current 80,000 students to 0 students.\n\nEnsure availability of branches of two popular schools in each district.\n\nIn total, 50 schools will be built, each with a capacity of 6,000 students, increasing total capacity by 300,000 students.\n\nEncourage establishment of international schools through 0% corporate tax and 0% VAT incentives to encourage professionals to serve outstation.\n\nAt present English-speaking professionals are reluctant to work outstation due to the lack of English medium schools for their children.\n\nEncourage establishment of private universities, excluding medical colleges, through 0% corporate tax and 0% VAT incentives to achieve the goal of 50% university degree holders from total students per annum (Sri Lanka at present has 360,000 students per annum).\n\nIntroduce an online portal excluding data charges, which contains instructional videos for all school subjects.\n\nUtilise video tutorials to teach students life and social interaction skills.\n\nProvide career counselling for all A/L students\n\n×\n\nSri Lanka had 99,036 unconvicted prisoners in 2017, of whom 6.8% had no schooling, 52.9% had studied only up to grade 5 and 85.1% had studied only up to grade 8. However, the total percentage of unconvicted prisoners who passed A/Ls and progressed in education beyond A/Ls was only 3.1%.\n\nTherefore, if every child is educated at least up to A/Ls, 50% of prisons can be shut down.\n\nGeo-tag the 5,000 children who do not attend school and increase the income of their families through help desks under the precision poverty reduction programme, so that these children are able to go to school. Thereby reducing the number of students who do not attend school from 5,000 to 0.\n\nDecrease school dropouts from 30,000 to 0 through precision poverty reduction and implementation of required social development initiatives.\n\nIdentify schools that require immediate refurbishment from the 10,194 Government schools across the Island.\n\nIdentify and closely monitor schools with low numbers of students and teachers.\n\n1,486 schools with less than 50 students\n\n1,560 schools with 50-100 students\n\n3,133 schools with fewer than 9 teachers\n\nEnsure all schools have access to clean water and toilet facilities.\n\nIntroduce 0% VAT and 0% corporate tax on private education.\n\nThis tax benefit scheme will be guaranteed for the next 25 years to build private schools and private international schools.\n\nOpen branches of popular schools in the 6 main corridors to Colombo â Galle, Piliyandala, Homagama, Kaduwala, Nittambuwa, and Negombo. This would reduce road traffic and raise standards of schools outside Colombo.\n\nDouble dose of Mathematics from Grade 6 for underperforming students by replacing time allocated for another subject.\n\nFrom Grade 6 onwards, introduce the option of learning Science in English.\n\nEncourage Grade 10 and 11 students to choose commerce subjects for personal financial management.\n\nRecognise English as the âlink languageâ of Sri Lanka.\n\nE.g. Provide Sinhalese students studying Tamil language the option of studying English language during that period. Likewise, provide Tamil students studying Sinhala language the option of studying English language during that period.\n\nEnsure availability of teacher training and learning videos for students for all subjects taught from Grade 1 to 13.\n\nEncourage the selection of Science, Mathematics, Commerce, Biology and Engineering streams for A/L to match job market trends.\n\nIncrease student enrolment in Grade 12 and 13 from 210,000 to 300,000, while increasing capacity at schools with Science and Technology labs.\n\nCreate a portal to monitor the quality of the district level school education system.\n\nThe portal includes general school statistics (no. of schools, no. of teachers, and no. of students, both urban and rural) and a performance dashboard (dropout rate, schools with functional toilets, schools with drinking water, etc.).\n\nForm a committee to ensure quality of education across Government, private, international and other schools and pre-schools.\n\nIntegrate ICT into education, increase the number of computers, and ensure Internet connectivity in schools.\n\nEnsure availability of ICT-related teaching materials through the online portal.\n\nShare instructional videos among teachers on methods of teaching ICT.\n\nUtilise video conferencing to conduct simultaneous live classes for rural schools which suffer from a shortage of teachers.\n\nDevelop an online application system for teachers featuring their qualifications and schools with job vacancies.\n\nLaunch a teacher training certification programme.\n\nUpdate student vacancies from Grade 6 to Grade 13 in every school on an online portal.\n\nCreate a website with athletic records from district, national, regional, and international level and update with the current status of each districtâs student athletes.\n\nEstablish an online academy with training videos, for students to train for sports and improve their performance to reach international levels.\n\nDevelop existing school cricket grounds.\n\nMake supplementary Math classes compulsory after O/L, either in school or via online learning.\n\nAllow students who have passed six subjects but failed Math in their O/L, to continue with their A/L studies while attending additional Math classes to re-sit the O/L Math exam.\n\nBased on the pass rate for their O/L Math, students can attempt the final A/L exam.\n\nPredict the dropout risk at school through the analysis of data such as attendance, performance and behaviour.\n\nAllocate a period in the school timetable for student engagement programmes such as weekly arts and crafts programmes, sports, reading and storytelling to increase student enjoyment at school.\n\nProvide after-school tutoring programmes in key subject areas to students at risk of dropping out.\n\nAllocate funds for students at risk of dropping out, in the form of bursaries and scholarships.\n\nUpgrade school library facilities.\n\nIntroduce virtual libraries with free access.\n\nIntroduce project-based STREAM curriculum (Science, Technology, Reading, Engineering, Arts and Mathematics) in primary and secondary schools.\n\nStudents to learn in teams and Math, Science, Reading and Engineering are integrated into each lesson.\n\nImplement mandatory health lessons where students, especially young girls, are taught about menstruation and proper menstrual hygiene.\n\nEnsure availability of emergency sanitary products and proper toilet facilities with sanitary napkin disposal systems.\n\nPromote education of students, teachers and parents about menstruation hygiene to reduce the stigma around menstruation.\n\nEnsure all teachers have adequate first-aid training and include first-aid training in the school curriculum.\n\nPrioritise establishment and upgrading of girlsâ schools. In addition, provide bursaries for girls to encourage education.\n\nIntroduce mandatory environmental education on being eco-friendly, reducing waste and recycling as part of the Geography and Science syllabi.\n\nAllow children of Sri Lankan families who are living abroad to attend local schools and sit for local exams when they come to Sri Lanka.\n\nIntroduce curriculum resources for early learning, primary and secondary students to promote reconciliation and strengthen knowledge and understanding of history and culture.\n\nEnsure availability of science laboratories for schools that teach up to O/L.\n\nIncrease science stream schools by 1,000 from 1,029 to 2,029 schools.\n\nTake part in Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA) to evaluate the current standard of the education system.\n\nProvide duty-free permits to owners of old school buses and vans that are over 15 years old.\n\nProvide 2,000 mini-school buses to villages where children walk over 2 km to access the main road to reach their schools.\n\nReduce the waiting time for local O/L exam results to 2 months.\n\nIntroduce pre-A/L classes for all students awaiting their O/L results.\n\nCurrent waiting time to obtain results in Sri Lanka is 4 months. An additional 2 months is spent at home until A/L schooling starts. Therefore, a total 6 months of student time is spent in an unproductive manner.\n\nReduce the waiting time for A/L exam results to 2 months.\n\nCurrent the waiting time in Sri Lanka is 4 months.\n\nReduce the waiting time for university entrance after A/Ls to 6 months.\n\nCurrent the waiting time in Sri Lanka is 17 months, including 4 months waiting for results."
