        "text": "Try modifying the registry settings for the cmd console (run regedit).

Hopefully you can experiment some and determine what number corresponds to a Sinhala font you have installed on your machine.\n\nAdditionally, you can select fonts using the cmd window's property dialog, illustrated in the screen shot below. Possibly you already have a font installed that you can use:"
