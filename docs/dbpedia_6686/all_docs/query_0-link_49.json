The paper adopts the framework used by Suh Cheong-soo in the article titled “A Cultural Perspective on the Korean Language”. Through this review we get to identify that some of the sentiments which are included in the Korean “jeong” concept can be found in the Sinhala culture as well. Hence those similar sentiments have given rise to similar language patterns in both Sinhala and Korean. In the same way different cultural sentiments have given rise to vastly different patterns of language usage between the two languages.\n\nThe study of South Asian music falls under the purview of ethnomusicology, whereas that of South Asian literature falls under South Asian studies.

As a consequence of this academic separation, scholars rarely take notice of connections between South Asian song and poetry. Modernizing Composition overcomes this disciplinary fragmentation by examining the history of Sinhala-language song and poetry in twentieth-century Sri Lanka. Garrett Field describes how songwriters and poets modernized song and poetry in response to colonial and postcolonial formations. The story of this modernization is significant in that it shifts focus from India’s relationship to the West to little-studied connections between Sri Lanka and North India.\n\nThis is a Sinhala translation of David Lodge's essay \"Bakhtin Dostoevsky Lawrence\" which is considered useful to the Sinhala reader of modern literary theory.

I situate this twinned discourse against the backdrop of domestic and institutional spaces that articulate exclusive identity formations and heteronormative ideals. I argue that Arjie’s engagement in a gender-bending game of ‘Bride-Bride’ in the beginning of the novel and his intentional mangling of a British poem at the end re-appropriates, or ‘queers’, the hegemonic, institutional spaces of home and school. Despite his youth and the trauma of civil war that functions as a\n\nmetaphor for the inner turmoil of erotic awakening, Arjie’s sexual transgressions within the heteropatriarchal spaces of home and school challenge the masculine nationalism that drove the pogrom. As such, this essay meaningfully departs from previous studies of this novel that read it as either a ‘coming out’ bildungsroman in the Western tradition or a chronicle of communal strife between Sinhalese and Tamil\n\nnationalism. Indeed, my close reading of the novel recognizes it as occupying an inbetween narrative space that often reflects both Radha Aunty and Arjie’s liminal gender and sexual identities.\n\nThis article addresses the question of how one may historicize aesthetic change, especially in the context of the third-world novel, by conceiving the aesthetic as a historically contingent category that mediates between the singularity... more\n\nThis article addresses the question of how one may historicize aesthetic change, especially in the context of the third-world novel, by conceiving the aesthetic as a historically contingent category that mediates between the singularity of form and the particularity of content. This question is supplemented by a discussion of the aesthetic modes of two Sinhala novels: Martin Wickramasinghe’s Gamperaḷiya (1944) and Virāgaya (1956). The method of historicizing that is proposed involves two interpretative levels that follow the contours of Dipesh Chakrabarty’s categories of History 1, or history posited by capital, and History 2, or histories outside the life processes of capital. While History 1 enables a totalizing interpretation which allows Gamperaḷiya and Virāgaya to be thought of as embodying a narrative/realist aesthetic and affective/modernist aesthetic respectively, History 2 enables a close scrutiny of specific aspects of aesthetic mediation and play which complicate History 1’s totalizing and often Eurocentric thrust.\n\nIn this paper we proposed a system; Optical Braille Translator (OBT), that identify Sinhala Braille characters in single sided Braille document and translates to Sinhala language.

This system also capable of identifying Grade1 English Braille characters, numbers, capital letters and some words in Grade 2 English Braille system. Image processing techniques were used to developed the proposed system in MATLAB environment. The translated text displayed in a word application as the final outcome. Performance evaluation results reflect that the proposed method can recognize Braille characters and translated to user selected language either Sinhala or English efficiently, over 99% of accuracy.\n\nDuring empirical sociolinguistic research this correlational study statistically compares quantitative scores of an independent variable Proficiency in English against the quantified dependent variable Rate of occurrence of deviations... more\n\nDuring empirical sociolinguistic research this correlational study statistically compares quantitative scores of an independent variable Proficiency in English against the quantified dependent variable Rate of occurrence of deviations from Standard Sri Lankan English (SSLE) pronunciation across the 185 users of Other Varieties of Sri Lankan Englishes.

Vernacular traditions of writing and worshipping emphasized the island’s differences from the mainland, despite (or perhaps because of) the invasions and cultural imports from South India. Examining the use of a literary vernacular, praise poetry, and messenger poetry in Sinhala, this article explores medieval Sri Lankan efforts to appropriate and ultimately rival the literary and religious cultures from the neighboring subcontinent.\n\nSwiss naturalists Paul and Fritz Sarasin visited Sri Lanka on five occasions.

Their later visits were focused on anthropological research on the Indigenous Wannila Atto (‘Vedda’) people and exploration of prehistoric settlements in Sri Lanka. Among the Sarasins’ anthropological and archaeological collections are skeletal material of several ethnic groups of Sri Lanka belonging to the 19th and early 20th centuries. This collection is curated at the Natural History Museum of Basel, Switzerland. The\n\nethnolinguistic groups represented in the Sarasins’ collection include the ‘Vedda,’ Tamil, and Sinhala people of Sri Lanka, and it constitutes the largest ‘Vedda’ cranial collection housed at a single institution.\n\nThe objective of this paper is to compare cranial variation of the Indigenous ‘Vedda’ and other Sri Lankan ethnic groups using this important dataset, while publishing the raw craniometric data for further studies. Observations on the dentition show that the Tamil and Sinhala individuals had high incidences of caries and dental abscesses that are typically associated with agriculturalists and that cribra orbitalia associated with iron deficiency was relatively common among all three ethnic groups. Betel quid chewing for recreational and cultural purposes, a practice that is widespread even today, had left dark stains on the teeth of many individuals of all groups in the sample. Multivariate statistical analyses on the craniometric data show that there is significant overlap among the three ethnic groups in terms of cranial shape. These findings underscore the importance of considering the ‘Vedda,’ Tamil, and Sinhala groups from Sri Lanka as closely related, due to gene flow over millennia.\n\nThe Sri Lankan state’s power to narrate the war and characterize the enemy is an expression of “triumphalist nationalism” and is a selective remembering of war.

Based on photographs taken during several field visits to these sites by both authors between December 2012 and January 2014, we analyze the relationship of war and tourism and how a particular Sinhala nationalist remembering of the war and landscape of memory are being constructed in post-war Sri Lanka. Today, Sri Lanka is a former war zone where the Government’s troops defeated the rebel Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE or Tamil Tigers) and ended 26 years of violent conflict in May 2009.\n\nThe end of the war came at a huge cost to civilian life in the northern part of the country; the UN estimates that over 40,000 people were killed,most of whom were Tamils who form the majority in Northern Sri Lanka. Despite the end of military conflict, war continues by other means, and its representation encapsulates a nationalist politics of victory that at once vilifies the defeated LTTE “terrorists” and excludes Northern Tamils from the Sri Lankan polis. The LTTE’s former hideouts, training facilities, weapons, and vehicles are now tourist sites on display for public viewing.\n\nEarly European explorers studied and collected skeletal remains of diverse ethnic groups they encountered in their travels and expeditions.

The Sarasins cousins of Switzerland visited Sri Lanka (then Ceylon) on five occasions between 1883-1925. Their first visit was primarily a zoological expedition. In their latter visits the Sarasins' focus was on anthropological research on the indigenous Vedda people and the exploration of prehistoric settlements of the island. Among the data and collections acquired by the Sarasins are about 400 artifacts, 500 photographs and skeletal remains of over 90 individuals affiliated with diverse ethnic groups of Sri Lanka. The ethnic groups represented in the Sarasins' collection include the Vedda, Tamil, Sinhala and Rodi people. Of these groups, the indigenous Vedda people of Sri Lanka have been highlighted for study by the Sarasins, as a society and a life way on the verge of extinction and a larger sample of Vedda artifacts and skeletal material had been collected. This collection constitutes the largest collection of Vedda skeletal remains curated in any single museum collection. The skeletal series is also unique due to its size, completeness and integrity of the specimens, where many individuals are named, aged and sexed by the collectors. We present basic descriptive statistics and observations on the Sri Lankan skeletal material collected by the Sarasins, curated at the Natural History Museum in Basel, Switzerland.\n\nOggetto principale di questo elaborato è lo Sri Lanka, una piccola isola dell’Oceano Indiano tristemente nota per una sanguinosa guerra civile durata 26 anni e terminata ufficialmente nel maggio del 2009.

Alla base del conflitto, che ha visto contrapporsi l’organizzazione paramilitare delle Tigri Tamil (Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam) e l’esercito regolare srilankese, vi è la rivalità etnica fra la comunità maggioritaria dei singalesi e quella minoritaria dei tamil. I due gruppi, con caratteristiche linguistiche, religiose, geografiche e genealogiche differenti, vengono spesso considerati in storico e perenne conflitto, presentando la guerra civile quale esito scontato ed inevitabile di una società fondata sull’ostilità etnica.\n\nObiettivo principale di questo lavoro è proprio quello di scardinare una simile convinzione: dimostrando la natura multiculturale e tollerante dello Sri Lanka, collocando l’emersione della rivalità etnica nel contesto storico del primo Novecento ed inquadrando la sua definitiva esplosione nel periodo relativo al processo d’indipendenza del 1948. Si cercherà, inoltre, di valutare la credibilità di un eventuale ritorno all’antica stabilità, attraverso l’analisi delle iniziative di riconciliazione nazionale verificatesi dal termine ufficiale della guerra civile ad oggi.\n\nLa prima parte si incentrerà sulla struttura sociale dello Sri Lanka, sia passata che presente. Si illustrerà dapprima la composizione di una popolazione estremamente variegata ed eterogenea, evidenziando le principali caratteristiche della sua composita suddivisione interna e dimostrando quanto sia ingannevole la sua riduzione ad una semplicistica ed omogenea bipolarità. Verrà documentato, inoltre, quanto la matrice etnica sia solo una parte della stratificazione sociale srilankese, nella quale si inseriscono molteplici fattori dalle peculiarità differenti. Infine, verranno analizzate le complesse dinamiche interne ed interazionali delle diverse comunità nel corso dei secoli, sottolineando principalmente l’esistenza di un passato contraddistinto dalla pacifica convivenza e dalla mutua tolleranza.\n\nLa seconda parte, invece, si occuperà dell’influenza esercitata dalla gestione amministrativa della colonia britannica sullo sviluppo della tensione interetnica. In particolare, si descriverà il passaggio dal riconoscimento delle diverse identità e dal coinvolgimento di tutti i gruppi presenti sull’isola nella conduzione della colonia ad un’impostazione eurocentrica basata\n\nsulla costruzione di un sentimento di unità nazionale e sul desiderio di omogeneità sociale del multiforme Ceylon. Verrà dimostrata l’inesistenza di scontri di matrice etnica e l’emersione di un generale collaborazionismo interetnico durante la prima fase della gestione britannica dell’isola, per poi analizzare lo sviluppo graduale della tensione tra le diverse comunità nella sua seconda parte, coincidente con l’alba del XX secolo. Si cercherà di sottolineare la natura di un simile scontro, che cede definitivamente alla propaganda del nazionalismo etnico a causa delle problematiche legate ad un’equa distribuzione della rappresentanza politica ed alla crescente insoddisfazione degli strati medi ed inferiori della popolazione ceylonese circa le proprie condizioni sociali. Infine, si mostrerà la definitiva esplosione del dualismo singalese-tamil nell’ultimo periodo del processo d’indipendenza e la responsabilità britannica nell’aver lasciato l’isola in possesso dei requisiti necessari alla costruzione del moderno conflitto etnico, in grado di smembrare l’intero tessuto sociale dello Sri Lanka e dividere profondamente la propria popolazione.\n\nUna divisione che le barbare violenze della guerra civile e le criminali violazioni dei diritti umani hanno alimentato ed accresciuto, tanto da apparire insanabili. La terza ed ultima parte, infatti, intende analizzare l’attendibilità di un ritorno alla tollerante convivenza interetnica attraverso elementi essenziali all’eventuale costruzione di una riconciliazione sociale, ossia: l’accertamento delle responsabilità per i crimini internazionalmente puniti; la garanzia di un adeguato e credibile processo giudiziario; l’effettiva tutela delle libertà individuali per la popolazione srilankese. Si farà riferimento, quindi, alle azioni dei governi in carica sull’isola dalla fine del conflitto e la pressione delle Nazioni Unite per la realizzazione di tali obiettivi. In particolare, si presenteranno le risoluzioni adottate sinora dal Consiglio per i Diritti Umani delle Nazioni Unite nei confronti dello Sri Lanka, sottolineando l’evoluzione della collaborazione fra questi due attori della comunità internazionale per giungere all’effettiva stabilità dell’isola.\n\nThere is a rapid growth on Information Technology through e-Government concept and the usage of mobile phone is also increasing day by day.

The majority of SMS writers in Sri Lanka transliterate messages because of language barriers, which create various communication problems and ambiguity of messages. Computing in Sinhala language is an emerging trend in Sri Lanka. This research is an attempt to predict Sinhala sentences in mobile short messages. This is a timely necessity in Sri Lanka."
