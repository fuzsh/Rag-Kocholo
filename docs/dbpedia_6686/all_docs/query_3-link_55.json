        "text": "Access the information you need, the way you need it.\n\nHave you ever found content in your course that was difficult to read, or you wish came in a different format? Now, if your school uses Anthology Ally, you can download alternative formats of instructor content directly from your course.\n\nMany classrooms today, both physical and digital, are integrated. Students with diverse needs are expected to complete exactly the same work in exactly the same manner. Alternative formats provide greater opportunities for everyone to access the information they need in the way they need or want it. With alternative formats, all students can meet the same learning objectives using resources that are built to target the needs of the individual student. For example, Anthology Ally creates audio and electronic braille alternatives for students with visual impairments.\n\nAlternative formats aren't just for a select group of students. Alternative formats benefit everyone. For example, maybe you have a lot of course material to read and get eye strain, or maybe you’re an auditory learner. Listen to an audio format of the learning materials instead.\n\nDon’t stick to just one format! Use as many formats as you want. For example, if the content isn’t in your first language, you could follow along in the ePub as you listen to the audio file. All from the comfort of your favorite coffee shop or study corner.\n\nChoose the format, or formats, that best suit your learning needs.\n\nBy downloading an alternative format, you agree with the terms of service. Select the Terms of Use link in the download panel to learn more.\n\nVideo: Ally Alternative Formats\n\nThe following narrated video provides a visual and auditory representation of some of the information included on this page.

For more information visit Microsoft's Immersive Reader Language Support.\n\nMicrosoft Immersive Reader is a solution that supports learners with different needs, taking online learning to a whole new level.\n\nThe following section dives into the Immersive Reader's features.\n\nHow to use Immersive Reader\n\nUsing the Immersive Reader alternative format is simple.

Take advantage of the multiple features it offers, leverage your reading comprehension and enhance your overall experience.\n\nWatch a video about Ally Immersive Reader\n\nThe following narrated video provides a visual and auditory representation of some of the information included on this page. For a detailed description of what is portrayed in the video, open the video on YouTube, navigate to More actions, and select Open transcript.\n\nVideo: Ally Immersive Reader provides an overview of Ally Immersive Reader.\n\nAudio\n\nThe audio alternative reads aloud the text in the original content. This also includes alternative descriptions for images, if they are provided.\n\nThe audio format is saved as an MP3. MP3s are compressed, high-quality sound files that can be played on any computer or mobile device.\n\nAudio formats fail, if the original document contains more than 100,000 characters.\n\nWhy use audio?\n\nNot only does audio benefit individuals with visual impairments, research has also proven that audio can increase learning (Boyle et al., 2003).\n\nMaybe these sound like you. If so, audio is a good option.\n\nYou prefer to listen than read.\n\nYou’re an auditory learner.\n\nYou want to read and listen to the content at the same time.\n\nYou have a lot of material to read and find your eyes get tired.\n\nYou read on your commute.\n\nYou don’t want to, or can’t, carry print materials for any length of time.\n\nYou have a visual impairment.\n\nYou want to adjust the speed of the audio.\n\nMost players allow you to adjust playback speed. For example, Windows Media player, VIC, Audacity, and iTunes.\n\nAudio language\n\nAlly detects the language of the original content and selects a matching language for the audio format file. If you want the original content in a different language, try the Translated Version format.\n\nThese are the languages available:\n\nArabic female\n\nChinese, Mandarin female\n\nDanish female\n\nDutch female\n\nEnglish (US) female\n\nEnglish (UK) female\n\nEnglish (Australian) male\n\nEnglish (New Zealand) female\n\nEnglish (Indian) female\n\nEnglish (South African) female\n\nEnglish (Welsh) male\n\nFrench female\n\nFrench (Canadian) female\n\nGerman male\n\nHindi female\n\nIcelandic female\n\nItalian female\n\nJapanese male\n\nKorean female\n\nNorwegian (bokmaal) female\n\nPolish female\n\nPortuguese (Brazilian) female\n\nPortuguese (Portugal) female\n\nRomanian female\n\nRussian female\n\nSpanish (European) male\n\nSpanish (American) female\n\nSpanish (Mexican) female\n\nSwedish female\n\nTurkish female\n\nWelsh female\n\nElectronic braille\n\nThe electronic braille alternative creates a BRF file that can be read on a refreshable Braille display (RBD), other Braille reading devices, or within a Braille software like Duxbury.\n\nThink of a Refreshable Braille Display (RBD) as a monitor-less computer. Most RBDs can connect to internet, create documents, access calendar, and a lot of the basic functionality a computer provides. RBDs can be a standalone device. They can also be connected to a smartphone, iPad, or laptop. Most RBDs are limited to reading one line of Braille at a time.\n\nWatch these videos to learn more.\n\nBraille Me Demo\n\nRefreshable Braille Display and the iPad\n\nRefreshable Braille Device\n\nWhy use electronic braille?\n\nWhile audio is excellent for reading comprehension, those who read braille acquire higher literacy rates on average. With braille, users with visual impairments can know the spelling, punctuation, and format of text on a page.\n\nMaybe these sound like you. If so, electronic braille is a good option.\n\nYou have a visual impairment.\n\nYou are familiar with braille.\n\nYou prefer to read.\n\nYou want to read and listen to the content at the same time.\n\nePub\n\nThe ePub alternative creates a digital publishing file that can be viewed on mobile devices. ePub files are reflowable. Reflowable means that the content displayed automatically adapts to the device it is viewed on.\n\nHere are a few suggested apps for ePubs.\n\nApple: EasyReader, iBooks, Voice Dream, NaturalReader, and Thorium Reader\n\nAndroid: EasyReader, Lithium and Voice Aloud Reader\n\nWindows: Calibre, Icecream Ebook Reader, NaturalReader, and Thorium Reader\n\nLinux: Thorium Reader\n\nWhy use ePub?\n\nePub is powerful. With it, readers can take notes, highlight content, adjust text and background, and in some cases use text-to-speech.\n\nMaybe these sound like you. If so, ePub is a good option.\n\nYou want to adjust font size and background color.\n\nYou want to highlight content, take notes, and bookmark important pages.\n\nYou want to be able to copy, paste, and search text.\n\nYou want to use text-to-speech and adjust the speed of the speech.\n\nYou prefer to read.\n\nYou read on your commute.\n\nSemantic HTML\n\nWhat is Semantic HTML? Tags and elements—such as blockquote, paragraph, and headings—are added to add meaning to a page. These tag and elements aid screen reader users with good content structure.\n\nSemantic HTML is viewed in a browser and adapts to the device you are viewing it on.\n\nSemantic HTML is available offline on your mobile device, if you don't close your browser.\n\nWhy use Semantic HTML?\n\nSemantic HTML is ideal when the content has complex layouts.\n\nMaybe these sound like you. If so, Semantic HTML is a good option.\n\nYou want to adjust font size and background color.\n\nYou want to highlight content, take notes, and bookmark important pages.\n\nYou want to be able to copy, paste, and search text.\n\nYou want to use text-to-speech and adjust the speed of the speech.\n\nYou prefer to read.\n\nYou use a screen reader.\n\nOCR PDF\n\nOCR stands for Optical Character Recognition. The OCR PDF alternatives are created when the original content is a PDF of an image. OCR technology analyses the content and converts the image into searchable text.\n\nThe conversion is only as good as the quality of the original content. If the content is difficult to analyze, there may be mistakes.\n\nWhy use OCR PDF?\n\nMaybe these sound like you.
