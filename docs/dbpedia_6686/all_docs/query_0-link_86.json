        "text": "Publisher of Indic fonts, who set up Ethno fonts. He studied mechanical engineering at University of Sri Lanka in Peradeniya, Sri Lanka (1978) and chemical engineering at the University of Toronto (1981). He settled in Canada, and obtained a Ph.D. in chemical engineering from the University of Toronto in 2005. He had a lifelong interest in mathematical modeling and type design. Vijayakumar died in 2017.\n\nSome of his Tamil fonts could be found at R. Padmakumar's archive. In 2017, after his death, Vijayakumar's family granted me permission to place the collection on my site for free download. There are sometimes multiple versions of the same font, with minor changes. All of these are included too. The list:\n\nAabohi Adaanaa (1993)\n\nAnantha Shanmugathas (1993, with Ranjan Shivakumar&EPICS)\n\nAnanthabairavi (1994, with Ranjan Shivakumar)\n\nBoopalam (1994)\n\nChunnakan (1995)\n\nDenukaPC (1995)\n\nDheepa\n\nGayathri.\n\nGeethapria (1993)\n\nHamsathvani (1995, with B.

Gnanapandithan), Sindhu (1993), Sngarabaranam (1993), TML Helv Plain (1992).\n\nHis fonts were developed on Commodore 64, on which one could not make the long N (Moonu suzhi N) as a single character and the result was a non-symmetric placement of the pulli (the dot). Vijayakumar continued that style in his fonts so he could easily recognize his work anywhere. That asymmetric pulli also led to the demise of his typefaces. A link has been set up to raise funds for the Vijayakumar scholarship at the University of Toronto to honour his memory.\n\nDownload link.

He set up a foundry in Sri Lanka in 2015 that published a few Sinhala + Latin libre font families in collaboration with Sri Lanka's only other foundry. Creator of Amma (2013-2015), an experimental fusion of Tamil and Sinhala letters. This project was started as Other-Letter by Pathum Egodawatta as a partial fulfillment of Final year Proffesional Collaboration module of the Bachelor of Arts (Graphic Design) degree programme at Academy of Design, Colombo presented at Nothumbria Unversity, UK in July 2013.\n\nPathum graduated from the MATD program in Type Design at the University of Reading in 2016. His graduation typeface was Maname about which he writes: Maname is a versatile typeface family made of nine compatible instances for multiscript publishing in Sinhala, Tamil and Latin. The family contains text and title styles in Latin, Sinhala and Tamil; a secondary text style for Sinhala and Latin italic style. The Sinhala and Tamil design explore the possibilities of novel stroke modulation, drawing inspiration from a variety of sources from early 19th century. Rather than providing predefined relationships between the styles and scripts, Maname intends to provide a family of compatible components with greater flexibility for typographers.
