        "text": "For other uses, see Rex (disambiguation).\n\nRex was a veteran clone trooper captain who led the Grand Army of the Republic's acclaimed 501st Legion during the Clone Wars. Bred and trained on the planet Kamino, he was designated CT-7567 and entered into Republic service at the Battle of Geonosis in 22 BBY. He gained respect from Jedi officers and clone troopers alike as an honorable commander, becoming known as one of the best and toughest clone troopers in the Grand Army. He was even selected for special command training under Advanced Recon Commando Alpha, following which he took the name Rex. As the captain of the 501st, Rex served as second-in-command to Jedi General Anakin Skywalker, whose bravery and unorthodoxy in battle he came to share. He was close friends with Marshal Commander Cody, with their relationship mirroring that of their respective Jedi Generals, Skywalker and Obi-Wan Kenobi. The four of them often received joint assignments to coordinate front-line campaigns against the Confederacy of Independent Systems.\n\nAt the Battle of Christophsis, Rex became a mentor to Skywalker's newly assigned Padawan, Ahsoka Tano, with whom he forged a strong bond. He also managed to rebound from the following Battle of Teth, an engagement he would never forget due to the near-complete eradication of his 501st unit, Torrent Company. While on a listening post inspection tour with Cody, Rex rallied a small team of rookie soldiers to retake Rishi Station, which they thereafter destroyed to thwart Confederate General Grievous's planned invasion of Kamino. He was soon deployed on tour aboard Skywalker's flagship, the Resolute, and joined Skywalker and Tano in leading 501st offensives at Bothawui, JanFathal, and other flashpoints across the galaxy. He took part in countless campaigns in the galactic theater of war, from the containment of the Blue Shadow Virus on Naboo and the liberation of Ryloth to other hard-won victories like the Battle of Malastare, the Second Battle of Geonosis, and the Battle of Kamino.\n\nThroughout his career, Rex proved to be an effective leader who truly cared for the men under his command, even as he began to doubt his own future—and those of his clone brethren—in the Republic. The Battle of Saleucami of 21 BBY saw him meet the clone deserter Cut Lawquane, whom he came to respect despite their striking differences. His leadership was put to the ultimate test at the Battle of Umbara, when he was forced to unite the 501st Legion under an interim Jedi General, the obstinate and aggressive Pong Krell. Rex did not see eye-to-eye with Krell and found himself having to balance his troops' well-being with Krell's high-casualty plans. When Krell manipulated the 501st into a fatal confrontation with their comrades from the 212th Attack Battalion, Rex realized their general was a traitor to the Republic, and he risked charges of treason to lead his men in arresting Krell. The ordeal refined his hard-line obedience to orders, as he also learned the value of making his own decisions as a soldier.\n\nRex's unwavering dedication to the Republic kept him on the front lines over the three-year span of the Clone Wars. He aided Skywalker, Tano, and Kenobi in rescuing Togruta colonists from the Zygerrian Slave Empire and, in 20 BBY, offered his soldier's expertise to help the Jedi train local insurgents on Onderon to emancipate their world. In a stark turn of events, he and Skywalker apprehended Tano on Coruscant after she was framed for a bombing of the Jedi Temple, an incident that culminated in her departure from the Jedi Order. In addition, Rex and Skywalker gave pursuit of a longtime comrade, ARC trooper Fives, who had gone rogue after unearthing an anti-Jedi directive that had been bred into all of the Republic's clone troopers. Before Fives could prove his findings to Rex and Skywalker, the Coruscant Guard gunned him down for resisting arrest. By war's end in 19 BBY, Rex ceded his command over the 501st to another officer, Commander Appo, who oversaw the unit into the rise of the Galactic Empire.\n\nBiography[]\n\nA number and a name[]\n\nTraining and Geonosis[]\n\nA Human male clone of the acclaimed bounty hunter Jango Fett,[3] Rex was born as a clone trooper with the designation CT-7567[1] around the year 32 BBY[2] on the planet Kamino for service in the Grand Army of the Republic.[3] Granted advanced growth by the Kaminoan cloners,[3] he was part of one of the first batches of clone troopers,[11] and his early life largely incorporated Kaminoan flash training.[3] As was the case with other clones who became officers, the Kaminoans spotted his natural leadership abilities early on, and over the next decade, he was put through additional command training and intensive programmed learning to develop his skills.[1][12] By 22 BBY, he had begun training as a squad leader.[11]\n\nThat same year,[13] CT-7567 served on the planet Geonosis[14] in the opening battle of the Clone Wars,[15] fighting on the side of the Galactic Republic against the native Geonosians and the Droid Army of the Confederacy of Independent Systems.[6] He survived[15] the First Battle of Geonosis[16] and continued his Grand Army service in the resultant intergalactic conflict, swearing to defend all Republic citizens from harm[17] as part of his oath of loyalty to the Republic state.[18] He served with Jedi Generals on multiple occasions and learned to respect their abilities;[12] in turn, Jedi officers came to rely on him. Thanks to his aggression on the battlefield, he earned a reputation as one of the Republic Military's best and toughest clone troopers.[16][19] Such was his prowess and performance that he was withdrawn from his unit[11] and was among the 100 clone officers recalled to Kamino to undergo specialized command training.[20]\n\nUnder the hardened eye of Advanced Recon Commando Alpha, CT-7567 and his fellow soldiers endured grueling exercises to develop independent thought,[20] improvisation, and individuality.[4] The ARC program led CT-7567 to befriend another officer, Marshal Commander CC-2224.[20] After Alpha rewarded their individualism by granting them proper names,[4] CT-7567 and CC-2224 became known as Rex and Cody, respectively,[20] with the former keeping the origins of his nickname to himself.[12] Rex often found himself working with Cody, particularly in a number of dangerous campaigns.[16][20] One example was the Battle of Tibrin, in which they tried and failed alongside several Jedi to oust a Separatist military presence from Tibrin. Although the battle was a crushing Republic defeat, Rex and Cody managed to survive.[21][22]\n\nEarly Clone Wars[]\n\nWithin several weeks of the First Battle of Geonosis,[3][23] Rex, having become well respected by clones and Jedi officers alike,[24] was given the rank of clone trooper captain. In addition, the Mandalorian veterans who trained clone officers on Kamino bestowed on him the battle honor of Mandalorian Jaig eyes, and he had the adornments emblazoned on his clone trooper armor's helmet.[16] In the same year, a new elite unit was formed within the Grand Army: the 501st Legion, whose members' training surpassed even that of the lethal Advanced Recon Commandos.[25] Rex was given command of the core group of the 501st Legion, with which he was tasked with patrolling the galaxy's lawless Outer Rim Territories.[26][27] As part of his designated 501st detachment, Rex received his own troop detail—Torrent Company,[3] which became based out of the GAR clone barracks on the Republic capital world of Coruscant.[28] He and his men were placed under the overall command of Jedi General Anakin Skywalker,[12] who accepted his officer's commission after being appointed as a Jedi Knight four weeks into the war.[23][29]\n\nAs Skywalker's second-in-command,[12] Rex learned much from his commanding officer,[30] developing a certain friendship with him.[19] He operated with Skywalker on the front lines, with the two frequently turning unconventional tactics into Republic victories.[27] As Skywalker later recalled, Rex, as a rookie trooper, was initially eager to follow every order to the letter[31] but became less wound tight with the passage of time.[10] The 501st Legion garnered fame and veteran status under their leadership,[1][26] and Supreme Chancellor Palpatine took notice of how Rex and his men adopted Skywalker's unorthodox strategies with repeated success. Under Palpatine's direction, the 501st grew into an amalgamation of clone units whose members underwent secret training and were moved across the galaxy's battlefields as the war effort required.[32] Besides his friendship with Cody, Rex formed a working relationship with Denal, a fellow 501st member,[33] and befriended Advanced Recon Force Sergeant Boomer.[34] He also became acquainted with Cody's own Jedi General, Obi-Wan Kenobi.[3] On one assignment, Rex and his battalion teamed up with a squad of elite Advanced Recon Commandos to attack a battle droid army that had captured a strategic city.[35]\n\nAt some point during his service, while equipped with a JT-12 jetpack, Rex was along a pathway and encountered an A-DSD advanced dwarf spider droid, which he fired upon from the air.[19] Shortly after the Battle of Skye, Rex and Cody were sent to the planet to collect the remains of the genetic terrorist Zeta Magnus, who was seemingly killed by Jedi Commander Halagad Ventor. However, the being slain by Ventor was merely a clone of the real Magnus. Rex and Cody escorted the two vast halves of the fallen terrorist on separate grav-stretchers, while other clone troopers loaded the remains of Magnus' lab-instruments and cloning tanks into a Republic gunship. During the battle, Obi-Wan Kenobi, Anakin Skywalker, and Ventor were betrayed by clone commandos of Tark Squad, who turned out to be Thyrsian mercenaries working for Magnus. Upon learning that, Rex remarked that Mandalorian-trained soldiers were more trustworthy than those trained by Thyrsians. He also advised Skywalker to start wearing a helmet upon noticing a fresh scar on his face.[36]\n\nCaptain of the 501st[]\n\nBattle of Christophsis[]\n\nA suspicious ambush[]\n\nSeven weeks into the war,[23][29] Rex and Cody were dispatched with a Republic battle group under the command of Skywalker and Kenobi to liberate the planet Christophsis, which had fallen to the Confederacy[37] and its Retail Caucus conglomerate.[19] En route to Christophsis aboard a Venator-class Star Destroyer, Rex witnessed a holographic broadcast alongside Skywalker, Kenobi, and Cody in which General Whorm Loathsom, the leader of the enemy invasion, pressured the Christophsian populace into submitting to Separatist rule.[38] After reaching the Christoph system, the Republic forces defeated Confederate Admiral Trench's naval blockade[39] and established a base on the surface.[37]\n\nSkywalker and Kenobi then took a clone contingent led by Rex and Cody[37] into the capital, Chaleydonia, more commonly known as Crystal City.[40][41] Once there, the Jedi and clones prepared an ambush to offset the Confederacy's advantage in troop strength. They moved into a business complex with two north- and south-facing towers,[38] from which they intended to intercept a Separatist droid battalion set to pass through the major plaza below. Rex and Skywalker stationed their men in the north tower's forty-sixth level, while that of the south tower housed the detail led by Kenobi, Cody, and Clone Sergeant Slick.[37]\n\nAs the Separatist battalion commanded by the T-series tactical droid[37] TJ-55[42] marched through the business complex's plaza, the troop column unexpectedly split in half. The Republic's strategy was thus compromised when numerous B1-Series battle droid squads ambushed Kenobi's men in the south tower. After signaling clone trooper pilot Hawk for an evacuation, Skywalker, Rex, and their men used their DC-15A blaster rifles' ascension cables to rappel over to the south tower. They avoided laser fire from the droid infantry below and arrived to reinforce Kenobi and Cody, who were holding out against overwhelming numbers. Once Kenobi temporarily impeded the droids' advance by Force-pushing a blaster cannon at them, the combined clone detachment took a turbolift to the roof for their evacuation. TJ-55 pursued them to the roof with more droid troops, and Rex, Cody, and the clones provided cover fire for Skywalker and Kenobi to cut through the droids. Hawk's LAAT/i gunship soon arrived, and Rex and his comrades escaped with TJ-55's cranial unit,[37] which trooper Gus had pilfered.[43]\n\nBack at the base that night, Rex and Cody analyzed TJ-55's cranial unit in the command center under a robolobotomy, but they only confirmed that the Confederacy had been aware of their plan before the unit stopped processing. Upon being apprised of their clone officers' findings, Skywalker suggested that a security breach was the cause for the Separatists' acquisition of their strategy, but Kenobi went so far as to suspect that there was a spy among their men. Skywalker and Kenobi decided to investigate behind enemy lines, ordering Rex and Cody to keep their mission confidential and remain behind to apprehend the potential traitor.[37]\n\nA spy among the clones[]\n\nShortly after the Jedi departed, Cody was alarmed to find a Hush-98 comlink deliberately left activated on a nearby table with the troops' other equipment, indicating that someone had remotely eavesdropped on their conversation with the Jedi. Rex then noticed a figure in the hallway too far away to be identified: Sergeant Slick, who had become a spy for the Dark Acolyte Asajj Ventress and the Confederacy out of a grudge against the Jedi. Slick immediately broke into a run and ignored Rex's commands to halt, forcing Rex and Cody to pursue him through the base. Despite losing their target, the two officers were able to follow his path through the complex's hallways to the clones' mess hall, where they realized that the traitor was one of their own brethren.[37]\n\nReturning to the command center, Rex and Cody attempted to contact Skywalker and Kenobi but found that communications were being blocked, potentially by the spy in their camp. Rex resolved to use Skywalker's astromech droid, R2-D2, to check the station's outgoing transmission logs[37] from the past few days.[44] Musing through R2-D2's findings with a datapad, Rex traced an odd spike in wavelength interference to a computer terminal located in the barracks of Slick's platoon. Inferring that one of Slick's men was the spy, Rex and Cody decided to individually interrogate the platoon's members despite protest from Slick.[37]\n\nThough troopers Jester, Punch, Sketch, and Gus all passed interrogation with credible alibis, trooper Chopper was forced to reveal that he had broken war protocols by stealing battle droid fingers from the battlefield and stringing them into a necklace. While attempting to derail Chopper's trustworthiness, Slick inadvertently revealed his knowledge of the Jedi's mission—information he could only have obtained via the open comlink that Cody had found in the command center. When put on the spot, Slick attacked Cody and Chopper and promptly fled from the barracks, leaving his platoon charges, as well as Rex and Cody, shocked with the revelation of the sergeant's true allegiances.[37]\n\nThe traitor exposed[]\n\nRex and Cody immediately gave chase to the exposed Slick, tracing a signal from his utility belt to the gunship landing platform. Instead of Slick, they found his utility belt attached to a primed thermal detonator, and they scrambled for cover just before the explosive triggered a series of others. The resulting explosion decimated the landing platform and the weapons supply depot,[37] as well as the base's power generators.[43] Upon learning from Gus and Chopper that Slick had been spotted running into the command center, Rex headed with Cody to apprehend the saboteur, leaving Slick's platoon and the other troops to seal the perimeter. In the command center, Rex and Cody noticed that Slick was hiding in the above ventilation shaft and engaged in a ploy to bait him out of his hiding place. While Cody secretly removed the ammunition from his DC-15S and left the weapon on the holotable console, Rex appeared to leave for the south exit[37] to restart the base's power generators.[43] Once the blast doors had closed behind him, he reentered the room and assisted Cody in confronting Slick, who had forsook his cover to steal Cody's empty blaster. Although held at blasterpoint, Slick refused to surrender, grabbing Rex's DC-15S and bowling him over.[37]\n\nIn the ensuing brawl, Cody and Slick disarmed each other and engaged in unarmed combat. When Rex joined in, he received a blow to the head, and Slick knocked him to the floor[37] and used the \"groin popper\" maneuver to dislocate his leg.[44] Nevertheless, Cody swiftly knocked out Slick, and the enemy agent was detained and locked in handcuffs. When Skywalker and Kenobi returned, Rex and Cody presented them with Slick, who, no longer comatose, attempted to justify his actions with his hatred for the Jedi. Slick's accusations elicited rebuttals from his clone officers, who countered that his exploits had endangered the lives of the clone brothers he claimed to love. Once Slick had been ushered away to lockup, Rex and Cody reported the sabotage of the weapons depot to Skywalker and Kenobi, who replied that they had discovered the full strength of the on-world Separatist invasion force, numbering close to a thousand units.[37]\n\nBattle in the streets[]\n\nWhorm Loathsom soon launched his first assault on the Republic forces, which became based out of Crystal City. After several days of battle, the Jedi and clones were able to beat back the Separatists, forcing them into retreat for the time being. Rex took advantage of the lapse in fighting to shave his hair and review casualty reports on his datapad near the Republic's temporary forward aid station. He conferred and joked there with the medic on duty, Clone Sergeant Coric, as well as trooper Ged, who was being treated for a shoulder injury. The moment the Confederate forces initiated another attack, Rex grabbed his rifle and joined Skywalker and Kenobi in the streets. While Cody assisted Kenobi in marshaling a defense of their base, Rex took a clone platoon to accompany Skywalker along a route parallel to the city's main street.[3]\n\nAs the clones made their way behind enemy lines, Rex recalled how the antebellum Crystal City had been glittering with beauty just days prior until the fighting crippled the city. He followed Skywalker and the rest of their men, including Coric and a patched-up Ged, to an energy sphere tower, where they divided their troops. While most of the platoon was tasked with targeting the street-level droids, Rex and Skywalker took several troopers to the roof to surprise a trio of advancing[3] octuptarra magna tri-droids[45] from above. Rex and his men used JT-12 jetpacks to reach the street below, while Skywalker landed on one of the tri-droids himself.[3][8]\n\nRex and his comrades' combined efforts brought down the three droids, and they turned their attention to the droid infantry's exposed rear flank, pressing on without haste. Once Loathsom and his droid army had been driven into another retreat, a Republic Nu-class attack shuttle landed in Crystal City's Central Plaza. Although Kenobi believed that his new Padawan learner was on board, he and Skywalker found that instead of delivering some expected reinforcements, the shuttle had brought the young Padawan Ahsoka Tano, who had been apprenticed not to Kenobi, but to Skywalker. Rex was introduced to Tano at the base's observation post and was surprised to meet the new Padawan, as Skywalker had previously sworn never to take a Padawan. Rex could not help but chuckle when Tano nicknamed her new Master \"Skyguy,\" but Skywalker, annoyed with her hubris and arrogant behavior, told his captain to give her an \"acquaint of the position\"[3][8] while taking her on his inspection rounds of Central Plaza's lookout points.[46] Rex complied and ushered Tano away to confer with her privately.[3][8]\n\nHarnessing various elements of his training, Rex helped Tano to better understand her role as a commander in the Grand Army, and they were able to reach an understanding of each other—although Tano was still eager to prove that she was ready to be Skywalker's apprentice, she learned to be more appropriate and respectful to her superiors. While near the Republic's setup of AV-7 Antivehicle Cannons, Tano noticed that the Confederacy was deploying a deflector shield, a development that alarmed Rex, who knew that such a shield would render the Republic's artillery useless. Both of them joined Skywalker and Kenobi at the comm station to devise a tactic to repel the imminent Separatist counterattack.[3]\n\nUnlikely victory[]\n\nThe group decided that Skywalker would take his Padawan behind enemy lines to eliminate the shield generator, while Rex and Kenobi would engage the droids to stall for time. After Skywalker and Tano departed, Rex and Kenobi attempted to use the heavy cannons against the enemy's expanding shield but only confirmed that they were indeed useless.[3][8] Using an unencrypted comlink channel to appear more convincing to the Separatists, Rex ordered the clone forces to fall back before switching back to a secure channel. Via eavesdropping on Confederate voice traffic, he learned that Loathsom had ordered his infantry to target the heavy cannons, which had impeded his troops earlier in the battle but were now ineffectual and vulnerable.[3]\n\nAs soon as the deflector shield passed over them, Kenobi led a forward charge on Loathsom's front lines, while Rex and his men lured the droids into the buildings along the main street. When the droids fired a missile at the comm post that Rex was using as cover, the explosion winded him and knocked him to the ground. After being forced to pull back his men, he met with Kenobi at the command center. Although Rex proposed that they use the heavy cannons in spite of the shield, which would cause fatal overpressure and result in severe collateral damage, Kenobi instead ordered him to mobilize a defense of the cannons while the Jedi Master delayed the droids. Despite his reluctance to leave Kenobi to fend for himself, Rex obeyed orders and retreated while Kenobi confronted the oncoming droids. As the shield approached the heavy cannons, Rex, Coric, and their men countered the advancing droids' fire from some rubble near the main street. Rex soon learned that Kenobi had surrendered to Loathsom, but he deduced that the Jedi General was simply stalling and rallied his men to hold the line.[3][8]\n\nAs Rex and his men withstood the onslaught from the droids' overwhelming numbers, Skywalker and Tano eliminated the shield generator. Rex was aiming at a Kerkoiden tank commander when he caught a glimpse of the receding shield, and he killed the enemy officer out of sheer relief at the sight. He quickly ordered the heavy cannons to commence firing on the exposed Separatists and their Armored Assault Tanks, to great effect. With Republic Admiral Wullf Yularen and Jedi Grand Master Yoda arriving with reinforcements to complete the process of securing Christophsis, Rex allowed himself to breathe and personally feel the deaths of his men, acknowledging the pain that came with losing them. Although LAAT/i gunships flew in and began to bombard the nearby droid lines, he braved the incoming fire to help Coric search through the debris for two surviving troopers whom they had located via their helmets' heads-up displays. Rex later took a gunship to pick up Skywalker and Tano from the shield generator site, then returned with them to the command base in Crystal City. During the flight back, he congratulated Skywalker and Tano on their successful mission—making a point to commend the young Tano,[3][8] who was slowly earning his respect.[1]\n\nBattle of Teth[]\n\nFollowing the victory on Christophsis, Skywalker and Tano were assigned to rescue Rotta, the son of the Hutt crime lord Jabba Desilijic Tiure, from enemy kidnappers. Their orders came as part of the Republic's overall effort to convince Jabba to grant the Grand Army access to hyperspace lanes running through Hutt-controlled space. Rex and Torrent Company accompanied the two Jedi to the planet Teth—where Republic Advanced Recon Force trooper scouts had tracked the Huttlet—in an Acclamator-class transport. Because the clifftop monastery where Rotta was being held[8] was a half-mile off the ground[12] and was being guarded by a detachment of battle droids, Skywalker elected to launch a vertical assault up the cliff face to reach the monastery. LAAT/i gunships ferried Torrent Company to the surface, and LAAT carriers brought a pair of AT-TE walkers along as extra support. When the monastery's droid defenders opened fire on the approaching craft, Clone Lieutenant Hawk—the pilot of the gunship carrying Skywalker, Tano, Rex, and their men—closed the gunship's blast shields to deflect the incoming fire. The gunships landed in the forest below the cliff, and the AT-TEs returned fire at the droids, providing cover for the Jedi and clones to take refuge in an overhang.[3][8]\n\nRex soon sighted an object falling from the cliff, and what he initially believed was an explosive device turned out to be a fallen battle droid. Following Skywalker and Tano's lead, the men of Torrent Company employed their blasters' ascension cables to scale the cliff, with Rex using his rappel line to ascend it. As a vertical crossfire commenced, the droid cannonades felled one of the AT-TE walkers, severing its grip on the cliff. Rex watched in horror as the AT-TE plummeted to the ground, taking all of the troops beneath along with it. When B1 battle droids on Single Trooper Aerial Platforms flew in to attack the clones in mid-climb, Rex trained his blasterfire at the airborne droids before Skywalker eliminated them. Torrent Company reached the monastery and destroyed the remainder of the droid infantry, albeit at the loss of half of its men. Upon arrival at the summit, Rex called in a gunship to casevac their fifteen wounded troopers, assigning several men to look after them in the meantime. He and Skywalker deduced from the heavy droid presence that the Separatists were the Huttlet's captors.[3][8]\n\nLeaving most of the men outside in the event of another assault,[47] Rex took Sergeant Coric and troopers Lunn, Vaize, and Ayar to help Skywalker and Tano scour the monastery for the missing Huttlet. Entering the dimly lit castle, Rex and his men activated their helmet's headlights for better vision. Inside, the protocol droid 4A-7, claiming to be the monastery's caretaker, greeted and thanked them for liberating him from the battle droids. Learning from the protocol droid that the Separatists had kept their prisoners on the detention level, Skywalker and Tano proceeded there to rescue the Huttlet while Rex and his men stayed behind to guard the entrance.[3][8] Though unable to confirm his suspicions, Rex correctly suspected that 4A-7 was not what he appeared to be[47]—the droid was aiding the Dark Acolyte Asajj Ventress as part of a Separatist plot to frame the Republic and the Jedi Order for Rotta's kidnapping. Rex returned to the monastery courtyard and finished securing the castle with his troops. As midday approached, he learned from Skywalker that Rotta had been found and sent Coric to help transport the Huttlet with a backpack. Upon their return, Skywalker and Tano prepared to leave Teth with Rotta aboard a gunship that Rex had on standby for them. However, Tano's discovery that the Huttlet was ill halted their preparations for an evacuation and forced them to consider another solution.[3][8]\n\nWhile Skywalker and Tano were delivering a status report to Kenobi through R2-D2's holoprojector link, a pair of Confederate C-9979 landing craft approached the monastery and deployed Vulture droid starfighters and ground troops. With battle droids invading the courtyard, Rex and Skywalker mobilized Torrent Company to defend their position while Tano returned inside with Rotta. After briefly conferring with Skywalker on the weak chances of getting Tano and Rotta safely off-planet, Rex dispatched Sergeants Coric and Hez and their squads to provide covering fire for the rest of the company. Their remaining AT-TE walker was shot down, and Torrent Company began to take heavy losses. Rex joined his men in retreating into the monastery, and with everyone else inside, Skywalker ordered his captain to shut the entrance door. He initially refused, as Skywalker would be locked outside with the droids, but when his general tersely repeated the order, he complied and fired a blaster round at the controls. Skywalker used the Force to propel himself through the closing gap and into the entrance chamber, sealing all of them inside. With three-quarters of their men dead, several wounded, and only three medic-trained troopers remaining, Tano convinced her Master that it was best to find medical attention for the sick Rotta. Skywalker and his Padawan left with R2-D2 to escape from the castle while Rex remained with Torrent Company to hold their position.[3][8]\n\nRex and his men braced themselves as the Separatist battalion—under the command of Asajj Ventress—disabled the door's lock mechanism, allowing B1, B2, and DSD1 dwarf spider droids to flood into the stronghold in overwhelming numbers. Rex watched as his men fell to enemy fire one by one before being knocked to the ground himself. Feigning death, he secretly contacted his surviving comrades through their private comm frequency and learned that only five of his men, including Coric, remained. As Ventress entered the antechamber and gave orders to an OOM command battle droid, Rex destroyed the droid with one of his DC-17 hand blasters and then targeted the Dark Acolyte. However, Ventress immediately drew her double-bladed lightsabers and deflected his laser shots. She telekinetically disarmed him of his blaster pistol and Force-choked him, demanding that he reveal Skywalker's whereabouts. Having been trained in mental resistance, Rex kept repeating his name, rank, trooper designation, and battle group to avoid succumbing to her influence. She finally gave up her interrogation and, after dropping the defiant Rex to the floor, performed a mind trick, ordering him to contact Skywalker and ask for his general's location.[3][8]\n\nRex resisted Ventress's influence and commed Skywalker of his own accord, using a false voice and addressing him as \"Anakin\" instead of his usual \"General Skywalker\" to allude to Ventress's presence.[48] Unaware of his exploit, Ventress threw him aside and departed to personally confront Skywalker, tasking her battle droids with guarding the survivors of Torrent Company. Though he suspected that his ribs had been broken, Rex mimicked unconsciousness to avoid attracting the droids' attention. He repeatedly checked in with his men over their private frequency, keeping them prepared to mount a last stand. Skywalker soon made contact via comlink, and because Rex had forgotten to divert the signal to his helmet, the battle droids overheard the device. As the enemy units converged on him, he destroyed several of the droids closest to him and stole an E-5 blaster rifle from one of them.[3][8] Moving as one, the other 501st survivors—Coric, Nax, Zeer, Del, and Attie—sprang to their feet and also attacked their captors, pilfering blasters for themselves. Using the fallen AT-TE as cover, they engaged the droids in a crossfire. Rex took a painkiller from his utility belt medpac before reporting their situation to Skywalker. Eventually, Zeer planted explosives in an eviscerated super battle droid and detonated the unit once it had been sent back into the Confederate lines. The trap droid destroyed many of its comrades, but only a few minutes elapsed before the droids regrouped to resume their attack.[3]\n\nRex and his comrades were able to bring down an advancing Vulture droid starfighter, using it as cover to combat the droids at a closer proximity. Nevertheless, the clone troopers were seriously outnumbered, and the battle droids demanded their surrender. At that moment, Obi-Wan Kenobi arrived at Teth with Commander Cody, the 212th Attack Battalion, and an armada under the command of Wullf Yularen. Leading an aerial assault on the droids, Kenobi jumped out of his Delta-7B starfighter to assist Rex and the other Torrent Company survivors while LAAT/i gunships deployed Cody and his men. Learning from Rex that Skywalker was most likely still in the stronghold, Kenobi left to find his fellow Jedi General.[8] Eventually, Skywalker—having found and commandeered the Twilight, an old spice freighter, with Tano and Rotta—contacted Rex, reluctantly telling him that they would be unable to give support since returning Rotta to his father on Tatooine was still their priority. Rex understood his general's dilemma and replied that he and his men would be able to hold out thanks to Kenobi's aid.[3][8] Under covering fire from his men, Rex charged at an advancing dwarf spider droid and planted a primed thermal detonator on it, jumping away in time to avoid the explosion that engulfed it.[8]\n\nAs Rex and his men cut through the battle droids, Kenobi returned from a duel with Ventress. Rex voiced his doubt that Skywalker and Tano would be able to reach Tatooine in their dilapidated freighter, but Kenobi was confident that Skywalker's expertise at a starship's controls would prove adequate.[8] After the Republic finally emerged victorious on Teth, Rex conferred with Cody amidst the settling dust, venting his frustration with the poorly handled operation. Although Rex was still devastated with the loss of Torrent Company, his friend stated that their efforts had not been in vain, as Skywalker and Tano had reached Tatooine with Rotta.[3] The two clone officers[8] accompanied Masters Yoda and Kenobi to Jabba's Palace on Tatooine to retrieve Skywalker and Tano, who had returned Rotta to his father and established a treaty with the Hutts for Grand Army access through Hutt Space. Upon meeting with Rex, Skywalker and Tano wanted to hear all the details of the battle's end, of the men who had won and paid the ultimate price for the victory. Despite his distress, Rex agreed to recount it to them.[3] Though Torrent Company was replenished with new troops,[29] the defeat of the original unit stayed with Rex for a long time.[15][49]\n\nShipyards of Gwori[]\n\nAs warfare continued to devastate the galaxy, the Confederate Navy, outnumbering the Republic Navy fourfold, put the Republic's war effort at a supreme disadvantage. With the likelihood of being prematurely defeated in the war, the Jedi High Council decided to impair Separatist starship production by targeting the InterGalactic Banking Clan's Confederate-allied Gwori shipyards. Because the shipyards' exact location on Gwori's planetary surface had yet to be determined, the task of pinpointing it fell to Rex, Skywalker, and Kenobi. To penetrate Gwori's defenses—namely, a droid-operated blockade and a radiation beam that eradicated all life forms bound for the planet—Skywalker chalked out a plan for a small strike force to be temporarily frozen in carbonite. R2-D2, whose presence would not cause much suspicion to the blockade's droid security, would then pilot the team to Gwori. After locating the shipyards, they would relay the coordinates to Generals Plo Koon and Saesee Tiin, who would eliminate the facility with a Republic squadron. Initiating preparations on Coruscant, Rex gathered a clone squad at carbonite freezing plant CT-642, where Skywalker assured his captain that they would not be frozen long enough for hibernation sickness to take effect. Rex and his men, along with Skywalker and Kenobi, were encased in carbonite with the addition of Tano, who had been ordered not to participate in the mission but nonetheless manipulated Admiral Yularen to grant her clearance.[50]\n\nRex and the strike team proceeded to Gwori aboard the freighter VX-391, with R2-D2 at the controls. When the blockade's battle droids discovered that the ship was unregistered, R2-D2 was forced to release the task force and jettison from the vessel just before the battle droids shot down the freighter. The astromech droid freed Tano from her carbonite slab, and she in turn released Rex and the others. Once they had found the enemy facility, Skywalker and Kenobi sent Rex, Tano, R2-D2, and two other clone troopers to contact Koon and Tiin from a nearby communication tower. After the group broke into the station, Tano transmitted the shipyards' coordinates to Koon, Tiin, and Yularen, who were waiting in the Moskk system. Before Rex and his comrades could arrange to be evacuated from Gwori, the transmission was cut off when the shipyards' supervisor, Overseer Juhm, contacted the station and discovered the presence of the Republic strike team. Rex, Tano, and their men managed to flee with R2-D2 just before Juhm remotely destroyed the station, and Tano relayed the developments to Skywalker and Kenobi. While their superiors infiltrated the shipyards, Rex, Tano, and their team went to find cover on Gwori's plains, where a squad of jetpack-equipped[50] B2-RP battle droids[51] attacked them.[50]\n\nAfter escaping from the droids, Rex and his comrades took refuge in a cave that they soon found was the current residence of a large lizard-like creature, which killed one of the clones before Tano could eliminate it. As time passed, the extended lack of communication from Skywalker and Kenobi led Tano to conclude that their commanders were in trouble. She decided that it was time to \"alter\" Skywalker's orders of staying concealed, and though Rex voiced some doubt, he left the cave with Tano and the other trooper. However, Juhm was waiting for them just outside with a squad of B2 super battle droids and killed their clone companion on sight. Presented with the choice of capitulating or being immediately gunned down, Rex and Tano decided to comply with Juhm's demands and were taken away, leaving R2-D2 back in the cave. As night fell, Juhm had Rex and Tano attached to electrically charged frames alongside Skywalker and Kenobi, who had been captured at the shipyards. Before departing, Juhm left a trio of IG-100 MagnaGuards to guard them from a horde of local spiders, his intent being to let them survive as a reminder to the shipyards' slaves of his absolute superiority. Although the four were tortured and electrocuted in turn, Rex grudgingly expressed his gratitude for the MagnaGuards' protection from the spiders.[50]\n\nIn an attempt to free themselves, Skywalker, Tano, and Kenobi used the Force to destroy the MagnaGuards, and R2-D2 arrived and cut them and Rex from their frames before the spiders could attack. The team proceeded to the shipyards and convinced Juhm's slaves, who numbered over a thousand, to emancipate themselves from their servitude. At dawn the next day, Rex, Skywalker, Tano, and Kenobi stole one of the shipyards' near-completed Munificent-class star frigates and escaped aboard it with the ex-slaves, just as Koon and Tiin arrived with their team of bombers. Koon and Tiin led the BTL-B Y-wing starfighters of Hunter Squadron on their strike on the Banking Clan facility, dropping their munitions on the site. Skywalker, meanwhile, used their frigate's tractor beam to retrieve trooper Toomer, who had been left behind at the drop zone when his carbonite slab's controls malfunctioned, and headed for the Separatist blockade. However, the battle droids overseeing the blockade detected the multitude of life forms aboard the stolen frigate, and at Juhm's behest, they activated the radiation beam. Before the beam could vaporize Rex and the other passengers, Koon and Tiin intervened, disabling the scan gate that was projecting the beam. The two Jedi Masters hitched a ride on the vessel, as their hyperdrive booster rings had been destroyed, and they left the Gwori system for Coruscant, where Juhm's ex-slaves found employment with the Republic. Once Toomer had been freed from his carbonite, Rex reassured the disappointed trooper that there would be more fighting to come.[50]\n\nOutpost inspections[]\n\nNew assignments[]\n\nRex was stationed with Skywalker, Tano, and Admiral Yularen aboard[53] Skywalker's flagship, the Venator-class Star Destroyer Resolute,[54] when it was deployed to the Bith system during the emerging threat of a new Separatist superweapon. After the enemy weapon executed a devastating assault on Plo Koon's forces in the nearby Abregado system, the Resolute was reassigned to protect the Republic's supply convoys alongside Kenobi;[53] his flagship, the Negotiator;[54] and the rest of their fleet. Skywalker thereafter divided his armada to increase their defensive perimeter and departed with Tano to scout ahead for enemy activity. Rex was present on the Resolute's bridge with Yularen when Kenobi contacted them to check on their progress as well as Skywalker's whereabouts. Yularen reported that the convoys were on schedule and also informed Kenobi of Skywalker's orders. Skywalker and Tano soon discovered that the Separatist superweapon was the Malevolence,[53] a powerful Subjugator-class heavy cruiser that was equipped with an ion pulse cannon.[19] Rex later reviewed the file on the Abregado incident, hoping that it would give him an edge in future battles against the Separatists.[55] The Resolute was again reassigned, this time to join a Republic naval strike on the Malevolence near the Kaliida Nebula.[56] The ensuing Battle of the Kaliida Nebula[51] saw the battleship eradicated, its threat to the Republic ended.[57]\n\nRex and Commander Cody were next assigned to inspect several small but integral Republic bases and listening posts.[58] Their first inspection site was a tracking station in the Pastil system. Upon arrival on Pastil[52] aboard Rex's Nu-class attack shuttle, the Obex,[12] Rex began assessing the outpost with Cody and commented on the station's extreme cleanliness. Trooper Stripe informed them that an MSE-series droid nicknamed \"Rodent\" maintained the base, mentioning that the droid had a glitch and spent hours cleaning the outpost. Recognizing the droid's characteristics as those of a spy droid, Rex called out a Code Aurek alert and ordered the facility's troopers to track down Rodent. The rookie clones were unaware of Rex's suspicions and initially thought he was crazy, but when Rex found the droid and blasted its body, the droid's wheels activated of their own accord and fled, a feature uncommon in regular MSE droids. The troopers eliminated three of the wheels, and when the fourth made for a grate, Stripe destroyed it with a thermal detonator; the resulting explosion caused a significant amount of damage to the hallway. Amused with Stripe's solution, Rex told the troops to clean up the mess before leaving the station with Cody.[52]\n\nRishi station[]\n\nAfter Cody reported their successful inspection to Skywalker and Kenobi, who were aboard the Resolute,[59] he and Rex proceeded to Rishi Station,[51] an outpost in the Outer Rim's Rishi system. They were unaware that Confederate BX-series droid commandos had just overrun the base. When Cody contacted Rishi Station for landing authorization, a droid commando posing as a clone trooper answered the transmission. Hearing the trooper's droid-like responses, Rex sensed that something was amiss but continued with Cody to the moon where the outpost was located, with Cody placing him in charge of the inspection. Upon landing at the station, Rex noted the absence of an on-duty deck officer, remarking that such an error was sloppy. A droid commando disguised in clone armor came out to greet Rex and Cody. When Rex caught sight of a droid attack flare launched from close by, he promptly shot the \"trooper\" who had greeted them in the head. At first, Cody was shocked with his brazen behavior, but Rex removed his victim's helmet to unmask the disabled droid.[21]\n\nMore droid commandos appeared and ambushed Rex and Cody, who exchanged fire with them while using some of the surrounding crates as cover. The droids tossed a series of thermal detonators at the Obex, forcing the two officers to jump off the landing platform. They fired their blaster cables at the underside of the platform and rappelled to the ground below; the droids, meanwhile, presumed that the explosion had claimed their lives. With the Obex destroyed, Rex and Cody mused over being stranded on the Rishi moon, recalling their similar situation on Tibrin. They came across the three survivors of the droid assault—Hevy, Fives, and Echo, who had also launched the warning flare—and Rex ordered them to take off their helmets to verify that they were clones. After the three did so, a predatory Rishi eel emerged from a nearby crevice; Rex impressed the three rookie troopers by expertly killing the eel with a single blaster shot to its eye. Once they introduced themselves, Rex and Cody learned from Echo that their sergeant had died in the initial attack. Dubbing Echo, Hevy, and Fives \"shinies,\"[21] a derogatory term for their as-yet-unspoiled armor,[12] Rex placed a handprint of blood from the eel's carcass on Echo's armor to commemorate his valor.[21][60]\n\nWhen Hevy expressed the rookies' shared desire to recover their outpost regardless of their inexperience, Rex stated that there was hope for them yet. The five troopers climbed up the canyon wall to Rishi Station, with Rex and Cody offering the carbines of their DC-15S blasters to the rookie troopers. Rex devised a plan to gain access to the enemy-held base, posing as Commando Unit 26 in clone armor and mechanically walking toward the blast doors' surveillance systems.[21] He conferred with Droid Units 07, 08, and 09,[59] who were guarding the entrance from inside. He maintained his cover by pretending to adjust his \"vocabulator\" and using an inert droid head as visual verification of his identity. Although Cody doubted the tactic would work, the droids admitted Rex entry, and he and the others gunned down the guards with celerity. Taking point despite Hevy's request for the lead position, Rex led the assault on the droids in the command center. He gunned down several of the droid commandos manning the central computer before the droid commando captain targeted him from atop a perch on a higher level. Rex blasted the droid's blaster out of his hand, which only caused his opponent to draw a vibroblade, but he quickly snapped the droid's neck with his gloved hands.[21]\n\nThough Rex and the others triumphed over the droid commandos, their victory was short-lived. The group of five discovered that a Separatist fleet—led by General Grievous—was passing over the moon, and they deduced that the droids had hot-wired the station's all-clear signal to prevent the Republic from learning of the impending invasion. To investigate the lack of response from the droid commandos, Grievous dispatched a C-9979 troopship, which landed at the base and deployed droid infantry reinforcements. As Cody noted their slim chances of success, Rex decided that they had to destroy Rishi Station: Despite the plan's lack of convention, the subsequent cessation of the all-clear signal would alert the Republic to the invasion. Echo contributed to Rex's plan, offering that they could repurpose the station's supply of liquid Tibanna gas as explosives to raze the facility. Before setting the operation into motion, Rex and Cody spoke with Echo, Fives, and Hevy to prepare them for the forthcoming battle. Rex stated that the Confederacy's main target could only be Kamino and cited its personal importance to the clones, rallying the rookie troopers with the knowledge that they were fighting for all of their brethren back home on Kamino.[21]\n\nWhile Cody, Hevy, and Fives confronted the battle droids at the entrance, Rex and Echo ushered several[21] PLNK-series power droids, or \"plunk droids,\"[61] containing the liquid Tibanna into the command center. As they wired the three plunk droids together,[59] Rex encountered problems with the detonator's remote handset. Hevy offered to stay and repair the remote, allowing Rex, Cody, Echo, and Fives to escape outside via a maintenance pipe. Rex assumed that Hevy had summarily fixed the remote and was right behind them, but when he told Hevy to detonate the explosives, he discovered that the trooper had not yet joined them. He contacted Hevy and ordered him to vacate the base, but Hevy stated that he would have to manually activate the charges due to the remote's defectiveness, ignoring Rex's protests. Although Rex and the others backtracked to help their comrade, Hevy sacrificed himself to destroy the base and warn the Republic of the Separatist invasion. The termination of the all-clear signal elicited an immediate reaction from the Republic fleet, which arrived and drove Grievous's invasion force out of the system. LAAT/i gunships collected Rex, Cody, Fives, and Echo from the moon and brought them aboard the Resolute. In the Star Destroyer's hangar, Skywalker and Kenobi commended Echo and Fives for their valor, awarding them medals, and also honored Hevy's sacrifice. Rex, impressed by the efforts of the former \"shinies,\" inducted Fives and Echo into the 501st Legion.[21]\n\nRedeployment[]\n\nRex and Skywalker soon returned to Coruscant,[29][62] where Rex manned a blaster training range to maintain his troops' marksmanship skills.[63] Just over a week after their return, word reached the Jedi High Council that General Grievous was targeting the planet Bothawui, home to the key Republic-affiliated Bothan Spynet. Skywalker was subsequently given command of his own battle group to defend the strategic world from the Confederacy. Kenobi, who was out of action due to being injured in a recent terrorist bombing, had Rex and the 501st Legion put on standby, knowing that Skywalker would want them for his strike force. After receiving his orders, Rex got his men settled on the Resolute, which was being prepared for Skywalker's fleet along with two other Venator-class Star Destroyers, the Pioneer and Dauntless. He enjoyed a brief reunion with Skywalker and Tano, who were pleased that he had been assigned to their task force. Once all was ready, they set off for the Both system, with Grievous and an armada of four Munificent-class star frigates pursuing them there. Although they beat Grievous to Bothawui, Rex, Skywalker, and Tano learned from Kenobi that Grievous had not abandoned his pursuit of them.[29]\n\nAs Kenobi told them, Grievous was still on course to the Both system, having merely stopped to take on two additional frigates, which he had used to overwhelm Republic forces on the planet Falleen. Despite being outnumbered two-to-one in vessels, Skywalker was intent on protecting Bothawui and was unwilling to let it fall to the Confederacy.[29] He deployed a detachment of AT-TE walkers under Rex's command to the asteroid belt surrounding[64] the gas giant Bothawui Prime,[65] from where they would be able to outflank Grievous once his fleet passed through the asteroids. After Grievous's frigates arrived in the system, proceeded through the asteroid belt—as well as the AT-TEs hidden there—and opened fire on the Republic Star Destroyers, Rex and his men turned the tide of the battle by attacking the frigates, targeting their aft sections. The ambush was all the more successful because the unsuspecting Grievous had diverted all of his frigates' power to their forward shields instead of their rear ones. The Resolute, Pioneer, and Dauntless annihilated the trapped Separatist armada but not before Grievous could flee from his command ship. Skywalker's Delta-7B starfighter took on damage while pursuing Grievous's personal starfighter, Soulless One, and veered off-course toward the asteroid belt.[64]\n\nRex led a search-and-rescue mission into the asteroid belt;[66] he managed to save Skywalker from his crippled starfighter but could not retrieve R2-D2, who had served as the Jedi General's astromech co-pilot. Rex and Tano met with Skywalker in the Resolute's medbay once he had regained consciousness and brought him up to date with the battle's success, albeit with the loss of R2-D2. After conducting an unsuccessful search for his astromech droid,[64] Skywalker was forced to declare R2-D2 missing in action. Believing that the Resolute, Dauntless, and Pioneer could use modifications, Skywalker took his fleet back to the Allanteen Six shipyards, where they had been manufactured. Eventually, Kenobi contacted Skywalker and Tano and tasked them with finding a new Confederate listening post[29] that was intercepting Grand Army transmissions.[64] Departing from the shipyards on his new assignment, Skywalker elected to personally reconnoiter space suspected of Confederate activity[67] while the rest of his forces concentrated on a more central path. Upon being informed of Skywalker's reconnaissance plan, Rex questioned whether he was sure about scouting ahead alone, but Skywalker was certain that more than one fighter would attract too much enemy attention.[64]\n\nSkywalker brought along the replacement astromech droid R3-S6 and departed from the Resolute in his retrieved Delta-7B starfighter,[64] unaware that R3-S6 was a spy working for Grievous.[68] Not long after Skywalker left, Tano received a signal from the homing beacon of her Master's interceptor—his covert position had been compromised. Rex quickly gathered a squad of troopers to accompany Tano aboard the Twilight, and they arrived to reinforce Skywalker, whom Grievous was cornering with two Munificent-class frigates and a squadron of Vulture droids. Because enemy fire had ruptured his hyperspace docking ring, Skywalker piloted his starfighter into the Twilight's cargo bay to retreat aboard the freighter.[64] With Rex and his men providing covering fire as gunners,[67] Tano maneuvered the Twilight right between the adjacent wings of the enemy frigates. As soon as they were clear, Rex engaged the Twilight's hyperdrive, executing a successful escape.[64] A short while later, R2-D2, whom the scavenger Gha Nachkt had captured, was able to get a message through to the Twilight. Rex tracked the transmission's origin to Ruusan 2,[51][68] a moon of the planet Ruusan, where they proceeded to investigate the source.[68]\n\nWithin the upper atmosphere of Ruusan 2, Rex and his comrades found Skytop Station, the Separatist listening post that they were after, and they concluded from R2-D2's message that the astromech droid was aboard the station. Despite orders from Kenobi to focus on sabotaging the enemy outpost, Skywalker resolved to mount a dual operation to destroy the base and save R2-D2. Once the Twilight entered the gassy atmosphere of the moon, Skywalker, Tano, Rex, and four other troopers used the Force and JT-12 jetpacks, respectively, to safely land on the station many meters below. Rex carried R3-S6 to the station at Tano's behest, a job he was not enthusiastic about undertaking because of the astromech's substantial weight. Upon landing with the heavy R3-S6 in his arms, he insisted that he would never lug around an astromech droid again. Rex entered the station with the squad and joined another trooper in shooting down two B1 battle droid guards in their path. At a nearby computer terminal, R3-S6 accessed the building schematics of the battlesphere, which Rex used to brief their team on the location of the station's reactors. If its reactors were destroyed, Skytop Station's repulsorlift generators would be compromised, which would consequently plummet the battlesphere to Ruusan 2's surface.[68]\n\nWhile Skywalker left to rescue R2-D2 on his own, Rex, Tano, and their men went to plant explosives at the reactor room thirty levels below, where they found that an alarm had triggered the door's ray shield. R3-S6 plugged into a terminal and tried to bypass the shield, but as time went on, Rex became doubtful of R3-S6's abilities and questioned them. Though Tano admonished him, telling him to be patient, R3-S6 was actually stalling to give a battle droid patrol time to ambush the Republic team. The astromech droid's efforts succeeded when a squad of B1 battle droids reached their location and attacked them. While Tano deflected laser shots with her lightsaber, Rex and his men used the hallway's supports as cover and opened fire on the battle droids. Meanwhile, R3-S6 activated the reactor room's secondary door, sealing off the Jedi and clones from the reactors. When B2 super battle droids arrived from the other direction, effectively outgunning the clone troopers and trapping them in a crossfire, Tano had Rex utilize electromagnetic pulse grenades—nicknamed \"droid poppers\"—against their adversaries. A grenade tossed in both directions deactivated all of the droids, though the ensuing respite in fighting did not last long. Immediately thereafter, Grievous arrived and confronted the team, batting Tano aside and attacking Rex and the clone troopers. They targeted their blasterfire at Grievous but were knocked aside, and all of the troopers save for Rex[68] and Denal[69] were killed.[68]\n\nAs Grievous prepared to kill the unconscious Rex, Tano intervened mid-strike to block the cyborg general's blow with her own lightsaber. She continued to distract Grievous by drawing him into a storage room; Rex and Denal learned of her exploits after regaining consciousness. Although Rex protested to Tano's course of action over a comlink transmission, he complied with her orders to complete their mission. He and Denal broke into the reactor room and planted the explosives, then departed for the landing bay to rendezvous with Skywalker and the Twilight. The Jedi General was alarmed to learn that Tano had engaged Grievous in single combat and insisted that they take him to assist her. As Rex and Denal headed for the hangar's exit with Skywalker and the Twilight's clone trooper pilot, R3-S6 sealed the blast doors and the rest of the exits.[68] The astromech droid also activated several Vulture droids hanging from recharge racks on the roof[14] to prevent the Jedi and clones from escaping, revealing his loyalties to Grievous and the Separatists. Surrounded by Vulture droids on one side and super battle droids on the other, Rex, Skywalker, and the troopers ran for cover behind several nearby crates while returning the droids' blasterfire.[68]\n\nDuring the ensuing firefight, Skywalker ordered Rex to activate the explosives at the reactors even though they were still in the station. Rex complied and detonated the charges, beginning Skytop Station's gravity-pulled descent into the atmosphere of Ruusan 2. Presently, Tano—having escaped from Grievous—reached the hangar via a ventilation shaft and joined the fight, eliminating two of the Vulture droids. When Rex noticed several fuel cells close by, Skywalker called on the Force to hurtle one of them at the droids, and Rex placed a well-aimed shot on the cell. The resulting explosion obliterated all of the battle droids. Once R2-D2 opened the hangar door via an external terminal, the Jedi and clones escaped from the doomed Skytop Station aboard the Twilight, and Skywalker completed their successful operation by finally retrieving his astromech droid.[68]\n\nWhile Rex, Skywalker, Tano, and Kenobi were serving aboard the flagship of the Republic Navy, Tano intercepted a Rebel SOS signal from Tatooine. Determined to prove herself, she secretly took a shuttle to investigate the transmission's source. Rex, Skywalker, and Kenobi soon discovered her absence and also learned that the signal had been fake—Tano had fallen into a Separatist trap. The two Jedi Generals quickly took the Twilight to Tatooine, where they rescued Tano from a battle droid detachment.[70]\n\nMission to JanFathal[]\n\nAt least six months into the war,[23] Rex agreed to relieve Skywalker of his Padawan for a few days by taking her along on a three-day shakedown cruise aboard Republic Navy Captain Gilad Pellaeon's newly refitted assault ship, Leveler, in the Dantus sector. After Pellaeon, an old acquaintance of his, permitted him to take part in Leveler's testing session, Rex departed to join the cruise with Tano, Sergeant Coric, and six clone troopers new to Torrent Company—Ross, Boro, Joc, Hil, Vere, and Ince, who had completed their training several days prior. En route to Leveler aboard a shuttle, Tano questioned if her Master had taken a respite from training just for a break from her, but Rex abstained from directly answering to avoid speculating about Skywalker. He was more concerned about his new troops: He was considering using the inconsiderate tally sensor to tell the six apart because they had so far failed to display unique personalities. After Rex and his men arrived aboard Leveler, Pellaeon greeted them and allowed them to move into their barracks. At Tano's request, Rex took her to examine Leveler's experimental concussion missiles, and Pellaeon joined them at one of the missile bays.[15]\n\nRex and Pellaeon were cut off from a discussion about Leveler's new weapons by an alert that a flotilla of Confederate ships had exited hyperspace in the nearby Fath sector. While Rex and Pellaeon monitored the Separatist activity, Tano sensed a disturbance in the Force that, at Rex's advice, Pellaeon took seriously. Despite the possibility that the enemy activity would not result in anything, Rex took precautions and went to round up his men in case they were needed. After Rex returned to Torrent Company's barracks and relayed the situation, Joc's inquiries into Pellaeon's private life sparked a debate between Tano and the rookie clones about the Jedi Code's ban on emotional attachment. Rex ended the argument by putting his men on standby, while Tano departed to check out the ops room at his suggestion. Once she had left, Rex reproved his men for putting her on the spot but was also pleased that they were settling in and expressing themselves. In an effort to keep them occupied, he took his men to the hangar deck to perform some deck circuits and familiarize themselves with the Fath system, where Leveler was headed to keep a closer eye on the active Separatist armada.[15]\n\nRex contacted Skywalker to inform him of their diversion to the Fath system, and Skywalker responded by setting off to rendezvous with Leveler despite his captain's admission that his involvement was unnecessary. After taking a moment to shave his hair from a blue-dyed haircut—in support of the Sullustan Bylluran Athletic bolo-ball team—Rex joined Tano and Pellaeon on the bridge just as the warship became host to the Altisian Jedi sect. Jedi Master Djinn Altis, who spoke for the group, asked for permission to dock his freighter, Wookiee Gunner, on the grounds of receiving a distress signal from a Republic agent on the nearby planet JanFathal. Republic Intelligence confirmed Altis's story and reported that the agent had been captured during a Separatist-allied rebel uprising. Pellaeon approved the rendezvous with Altis, and Rex promised his men for the hostage extraction that they would soon be performing. However, matters were complicated when the captive operative was identified as Hallena Devis, a close acquaintance of Pellaeon. While Rex and his men were examining JanFathal's capital of Athar—where Devis was being held—via a holochart in Leveler's meeting room, Altis and fellow Jedi Callista Masana and Geith Eris convened with them, Pellaeon, and Tano to formulate a plan to rescue Devis.[15]\n\nAs Pellaeon briefed the impromptu team on the objective at hand, Rex objected when Pellaeon implied that he intended to participate in the mission; the clone captain cited that in the absence of embarked troops, the responsibility fell to him and his men. He noted that all they could hope for was a successful rescue operation and not a full-scale ouster of the Separatists from JanFathal. Eris and Masana voiced their desire to reconnoiter Athar on their own, as they did not approve of clone trooper production on account of their beliefs, but Rex and his men insisted that it was their job. With a plan in place, the team headed down to Leveler's hangar bay, where a replenishment shuttle was prepared for them to take to JanFathal. Rex refused Pellaeon's suggestion to use civilian clothing, stating that he preferred armor advantages to stealth, and also assured the distressed Pellaeon that they would rescue Devis. Once the sensor technician Benb finished outfitting the shuttle, Rex and his men boarded the craft alongside Tano, Altis, Masana, and Eris. As Sergeant Coric flew them to Athar, Rex attempted to mediate a heated conversation between Tano and the Altisian Jedi, whose controversial beliefs conflicted with the orthodox Jedi principles upon which she had been raised. He also checked in with his rookie troopers over their private circuit and took pity on the new inductees, as they had not been prepared to be confronted with Jedi of such incongruous beliefs and behavior.[15]\n\nAfter bypassing a Separatist landing craft, Coric landed the team's shuttle in the south district of Athar. Rex immediately disembarked with the others and headed for a nearby building, where Altis and Ross worked with a recording remote to observe the surrounding enemy deployments in the city. Rex, Tano, and Masana then moved in to reconnoiter the vicinity of the building where the Separatist-backed rebels were holding Devis. Rex formed a plan for a standard hostage extraction, electing to first secure the building's exit and then deploy teams to infiltrate the structure via the roof and front entrance. After the rest of the team joined them, Rex sent Altis with Joc, Ince, and Ross to cover the exit and led the others to enter the building via the roof. Once Altis had distracted Devis's captors—the young insurgents Merish Hath, Shil Kaval, and Varti—Rex and his men used explosives to open a hole in the roof and joined the Jedi in confronting the rebels. Though Varti, holding his blaster to Devis, tried to bargain with him, Rex surprised everyone by laconically shooting down Varti, subsequently freeing Devis. He used a vibroblade from his gauntlet to sever Devis's handcuffs and ushered her toward the exit, ignoring her attempts to retrieve her comlink from the badly wounded Kaval.[15]\n\nAfter Devis had been moved to safety, the building began to crumble, and Rex charged out of the structure with Altis, Vere, and Boro. While Ince headed to Coric's shuttle with Devis, Rex joined the fight against an incoming force of battle droids. In the ensuing battle, Vere was wounded beyond help, leaving Rex pained with the loss of the rookie trooper. Although Boro tried to revive Vere, Rex told him to continue fighting, as Boro endangered his own life with every second he spent trying to help Vere. Launching grenades at the droid infantry with his rifle, Rex prepared to lay charges and sacrifice himself so that the others could escape, despite protests from both Tano and Boro. Before Rex could execute his plan, Altis, Masana, and Tano focused through the Force, toppling an adjacent building onto the droids and barricading the enemy's path with rubble. Rex contacted Coric and was surprised to learn that the sergeant—despite having been ordered to wait only for Devis and the Jedi—was landing nearby to extract the rest of the team. Although Coric had disobeyed orders, Rex was grateful that he had decided to return for them.[15]\n\nOnce all of the Jedi and clones were on board, Coric piloted the shuttle out of the area, barely evading the pursuant battle droids. En route to Leveler, Devis thanked Rex for his men's efforts, but he avoided initiating a conversation with her so as to reflect on Vere's death. He noticed that Ross, Boro, Joc, Hil, and Ince had opened up a private comlink frequency and respected their privacy, knowing they needed to discuss personal matters, including the painful loss of Vere, without him overhearing. He instead voiced his congratulations to his men on the successful rescue, though he noted that JanFathal was lost to the Republic. Meanwhile, the Separatist destroyer Reaper attacked Leveler and forced Pellaeon's warship to flee to hyperspace before Coric's shuttle could dock, leaving Rex and his team to fend for themselves. With their main source of life support—Leveler—gone, Rex ordered Coric to disable all nonessential systems. Boro calculated that with their limited oxygen supply, they would only be able to make it halfway to the shipyards at Kemla Yard, the closest Republic-allied location. Instead, they elected to return to Athar and mount a last stand against the Separatist army there. Shortly thereafter, Skywalker arrived in the system aboard the V-19 Torrent starfighter Echo-97 and contacted Rex, who updated him on their situation. Rex and the others rendezvoused with Skywalker in Athar, where Skywalker was introduced to the rookie clones and the Altisian Jedi.[15]\n\nRex and his men's spirits were lifted when Skywalker told them he had spotted several of the Separatists' hyperdrive-equipped CR-20 troop carriers, which could be used to escape off-world. Altis presently received word from his colleague Ash Jarvee that Leveler was returning to the system from a miscalculated hyperspace jump. In the meantime, Skywalker sent Rex, Masana, and the clone troopers to a road bridge along the Cadaman Royal Highway while he and the other Jedi seized a CR-20. Rex and his comrades would provide covering fire until the troop carrier lifted off and would then board the ship. Once Rex, Masana, and the clones were in position, Skywalker commandeered the troop carrier with Tano, Altis, Eris, and Devis and arrived to rescue them. Yet Ince was injured in battle with the droids, and Hil hurriedly treated him for his wounds. A Vulture droid approached and fired at some paving behind them, but Masana diverted the falling debris with the Force and edged over to attend to Ince. While Masana and the others carried the injured Ince onto the hovering troop carrier, Rex and Ross remained on the ground to keep the droid starfighter occupied.[15]\n\nThe Vulture droid landed and advanced on the two clones in walking mode, and Ross got the droid's attention while Rex tangled its legs with his rappel line, pulling himself toward the droid. He hung on despite its attempts to throw him off, causing the droid to become increasingly more tangled in the line. Rex and Ross's combined blasterfire brought down the droid, and they escaped to the CR-20, which Skywalker promptly piloted toward Leveler. While the wounded Ince was stabilized, the battle-weary Rex manned the CR-20's blaster cannons with Tano, returning fire at the attacking Separatist armada. As soon as their CR-20 landed aboard Leveler, the assault ship escaped to hyperspace; Ince, meanwhile, was rushed to the medbay. Rex joined his comrades there, trying to endure the aggravating wait for developments in Ince's case. When Ince died from blood loss, Rex, devastated and furious with the loss of a second soldier within a single day, took refuge in the mess hall. Tano found him there and consulted him about the Altisian Jedi views on the Clone Army, a discussion that soon undermined Rex's own beliefs as well as Tano's. Accepting that he and his comrades were making the best of an unwanted situation, Rex finally regained stability with his principles, though Tano found it more difficult to do so.[15]\n\nFurther campaigns[]\n\nAs the war continued, Rex participated in a battle on a world against anti-Republic forces with Skywalker and Tano. During the fighting, Rex oversaw the operation of the Republic's AV-7 Antivehicle Cannons and had them return bombardment to the enemy artillery. Eventually, Skywalker learned that Trade Federation Viceroy Nute Gunray, a member of the ruling Separatist Council, had been arrested on the planet Rodia. While Tano departed to assist Jedi Master Luminara Unduli in transporting Gunray to Coruscant for trial, Skywalker and Rex stayed to maintain the Republic's position on the embattled world.[72] When the Republic launched a later campaign to capture Confederate Head of State Count Dooku, Rex served with Skywalker, Tano, and Kenobi aboard the Resolute, searching for traces of the Sith Lord in the hopes that removing him from the Confederate leadership would effect a quicker end to the war. Once they located Dooku's Munificent-class star frigate in the Vanqor system, Skywalker and Kenobi infiltrated the frigate to detain the Separatist leader[73] while Rex, remaining behind with Tano, took Wullf Yularen's place of commanding the Resolute, as the admiral was recovering from the previous run-in with the Malevolence.[74]\n\nAs soon as Skywalker and Kenobi were aboard Dooku's frigate, Rex had the Resolute move into position and open fire, crippling the enemy vessel. However, Dooku escaped aboard his solar sailer, and Skywalker and Kenobi gave pursuit in a stolen Sheathipede-class transport shuttle, ordering Rex and Tano to follow in any available craft. Although Skywalker and Kenobi crash-landed on the planet Vanqor alongside Dooku, a band of pirates brought the Sith Lord to their base on Florrum. After Tano retrieved Skywalker and Kenobi from Vanqor, Rex was present on the Resolute's bridge when Masters Yoda and Mace Windu of the Jedi Council delivered new orders to them. Hondo Ohnaka, the leader of the pirate gang that had captured Dooku, had issued a ransom of a million credits for their prisoner, and Skywalker and Kenobi were to verify that the Florrum pirates had custody of Dooku so that the Republic could pay the ransom.[73] Yet Ohnaka's pirates also briefly captured Skywalker and Kenobi, who failed to prevent Dooku from escaping from Florrum.[75]\n\nWhile liberating the planet Queel from the Confederacy alongside Skywalker, Kenobi, and Tano, Rex accompanied the latter to eliminate the enemy's artillery encampment. Rex used a jetpack to cross a swamp to the artillery base, while Tano rode a large dragon-like creature. Attacking the battle droids guarding the blaster cannons, Tano threw a blaster battery at the artillery stations with the Force, and Rex detonated the explosive by shooting the flying target, annihilating the cannons. He and Tano then returned to the Republic's forward command post with Skywalker and Kenobi to receive an incoming message from the Jedi Temple on Coruscant. In a conference with Jedi Masters Yoda and Ki-Adi-Mundi, Skywalker and Tano were assigned to intercept the Separatist agent Messo—who had stolen a Republic data file—in the Mon Gazza system, while Kenobi was to finish the campaign on Queel. Rex went with Skywalker and Tano aboard the Twilight to undertake their assignment on the planet Mon Gazza, where Skywalker left to find Messo while Rex and Tano stayed behind to secure the freighter. After changing out of his usual armor, Rex donned a heavily covered-up disguise and traveled with Tano to find her Master. When Skywalker confronted Messo in a Podracing arena, he discovered that the enemy agent had already transferred the data file. To further complicate matters, Messo was killed in a collision with a Podracer before he could reveal any more information.[71]\n\nRex and Tano joined Skywalker in the stands to watch the race and learned that Skywalker, who believed that Messo's contact belonged to one of the teams in the racing circuit, had entered Tano as a contestant to go undercover with the other racers. They proceeded to the Podracing stalls to begin outfitting Tano's Podracer, with Rex, Skywalker, and R2-D2 posing as her pit crew. The skilled Podracer Kidd Kareen became their prime suspect for being Messo's correspondent, as Tano learned via Jedi intelligence that several recent espionage incidents had coincided with the racing circuit's presence in the same system, with Kareen and his crew being present for each of the events. Once Kareen's crew had left their stall for the day, Tano kept Kareen occupied while Skywalker took a look around the stall, with Rex and R2-D2 on lookout. However, Kareen's fellow crew member San Maxus caught Skywalker snooping around, and a fistfight erupted between the Jedi and Kareen's crew. Shortly after Rex joined the fray, Tano and Kareen returned and halted the fight, and Tano was forced to apologize for her crew's actions. Rex and his comrades hurriedly left to prepare when they learned that the Padawan's debut race was next.[71]\n\nAt the race, Rex and Skywalker tracked Tano's progress through the course via R2-D2's hololink, rushing to her aid when another Podracer rammed her from behind near the finish line. Although Tano's Podracer had been demolished in the crash, Kareen offered to loan her one of his spare Podracers. Rex and Skywalker later trailed Maxus into a pub and used R2-D2 to eavesdrop on him. They discovered that Maxus was the Separatist spy when he contacted Count Dooku, and they also overheard Dooku arranging to have another agent collect the stolen Republic datachip from Maxus the next day. That day, during Tano's next race alongside Kareen and Maxus, Rex and Skywalker noticed Maxus recovering the stolen datachip from the Podracing pits and chased after him. Though Maxus escaped, he left the rest of Kareen's crew to engage them in blaster combat. While Rex and R2-D2 fought off the Podracers, Skywalker departed to help his Padawan, and the Jedi managed to prevent Maxus from handing over the datachip to Asajj Ventress thanks to assistance from Kareen. With their task completed, Rex, Skywalker, and Tano bid farewell to Kareen before leaving Mon Gazza aboard the Twilight. The three reported their success to Kenobi, who was still on Queel.[71]\n\nWhen rumors abounded of a new Confederate project in the Outer Rim, Rex became involved with sending Denal on various missions to counter the menace. While Denal was on Rodia investigating the rumors, Rex contacted him and ordered him to make way for Republic reinforcements by purging a nearby jungle clearing of battle droids. Once Denal had done so, Rex sent him to destroy a transport factory by activating its self-destruct mechanism. At Rex's behest, Denal next took a squad to Tatooine to scout out an allegedly deserted Separatist base, which was discovered to be teeming with droid forces. After Denal's team cleared the outpost of hostiles, Rex relayed the news that another enemy base—this time a research station—had been discovered on Tatooine. As the outpost was reportedly connected to the new Separatist project, Rex told Denal to act quickly before the facility could be evacuated and any evidence destroyed. Denal infiltrated the station and uncovered plans for a superweapon that could cloak entire armies from the Republic. He later destroyed the superweapon at its construction site on the ice world Orto Plutonia. Shortly after Denal returned to the Republic fleet and received commendations from Kenobi, Rex dispatched the trooper on yet another assignment.[76]\n\nRex was sent with Skywalker and Tano to the planet Taronda to secure raw materials that the Republic desperately needed. However, Taronda's resources were also of interest to the Separatists, who targeted a mining settlement on the world to divert the Republic's attention. With Vulture droid starfighters attacking from overhead, Skywalker had Rex gather the miners and prepare the encampment's deflector shield. Though Tano fell down a crevice leading to a mineshaft, Rex informed Skywalker of a more pressing matter: the arrival of a Separatist assault force composed of a C-9979 troopship, Multi-Troop Transports, and multiple Armored Assault Tanks. After bringing the wounded civilians to safety, Rex triggered the shield and called in Republic reinforcements. Asajj Ventress materialized just beyond the shield and revealed that she had sent dwarf spider droids after Tano, but Rex told Skywalker to have faith in his Padawan and restrained him from confronting Ventress. She withdrew her droid forces from Taronda upon discovering that a Republic Star Destroyer was inbound. Rex thereafter deemed it safe to disable the shield, and Tano, who had defeated the spider droids on her own, soon rejoined him and Skywalker.[77]\n\nWhen the Republic Ninth Fleet received a distress call from the Deyvus, a malfunctioning merchant starship locked on course with an unstable nebula, Rex, Skywalker, and Tano were sent to rescue the ship aboard the Twilight, as their craft was the nearest and fastest one available. On approach to the Deyvus, Rex noted that the damage appeared to be severe, with its ion drive gone critical and it's stabilizers offline. As they prepared to send R2-D2 to access the Deyvus's maintenance systems, the vessel revealed a number of battle droid–manned laser cannons, leading Rex, Skywalker, and Tano to realize that it was a Separatist trap. Before they could maneuver the Twilight out of range, the droids targeted its engines; Rex used a fire extinguisher to put out the accompanying flames in the cockpit. He informed Skywalker that another impact would cripple the Twilight, as its hull could not withstand further damage. While the Twilight began to be pulled toward the collapsing nebula, General Grievous holographically contacted Rex, Skywalker, and Tano and lured them aboard the Deyvus, from where he claimed to be watching their deaths. Skywalker had R2-D2 begin repairing the Twilight's engines and took Rex with him to the Deyvus to capture Grievous.[78]\n\nRex and Skywalker used a pair of grappling hooks to pull themselves toward the Deyvus through the void of space. Along the way, Rex questioned the boldness of their plan, to which Skywalker replied that it was boldness that distinguished them from the Separatists. Sneaking past the heavy laser cannons, Rex and Skywalker boarded the gun deck and proceeded into the Deyvus's system of hallways. Before they could get far, B1 battle droids and shielded droidekas surrounded them. Skywalker responded by slicing a hole in an adjacent wall with his lightsaber to blaze a detour to the bridge, where they assumed Grievous was sequestered. They passed through three floors, eliminating all of the battle droids in their path. On the bridge, they discovered that Grievous was not aboard the Deyvus; instead, a plethora of primed thermal detonators greeted them. Grievous contacted them from the safety of a Separatist cruiser and taunted their predictability before severing the connection. Skywalker quickly cut intersecting slices in the cockpit's roof with his lightsaber, and Rex blasted a hole through the weakened metal, allowing them to return to the Twilight moments before the Deyvus exploded. Though they failed to capture Grievous, they had foiled his trap for them.[78]\n\nEventually, the Jedi Order learned—via a datachip that Ros Lai, an outcast of the Nightsisters clan of Dathomir, had provided—that the Confederacy had entered into an alliance with the Nightsisters. Rex returned to Christophsis with Republic Senator Padmé Amidala, her protocol droid C-3PO, and R2-D2 to pursue Lai's leads about the new enemy partnership for the Jedi High Council. During their investigations, Amidala discovered that the Separatist Droid Army was mining for something on Christophsis, though she was unable to determine what. Amidala reported her findings to the High Council and prepared to leave Christophsis with Rex and her droids. Before they could get off-world, enemy forces shot down their ship, and Rex was injured in the subsequent crash. He, Amidala, C-3PO, and R2-D2 were imprisoned in the Separatist base, where the battle droids were conducting their mining operation. While there, they overheard their guards saying that the Confederacy was harvesting crystals from the planet core, which were to be used to power the Devastation,[79] a newly constructed warship and the sister ship of the Malevolence.[51]\n\nSkywalker and Kenobi—who had been sent with Clone Commander CC-1004, nicknamed \"Gree,\" to rescue Amidala—soon freed Rex and his friends from their prison cell. While C-3PO and R2-D2 remained behind to assist in the Jedi's continuing investigation, Amidala helped Rex to Gree's LAAT/i gunship, which had a medical console on standby for him. The Jedi later destroyed the Devastation before it could assault Coruscant, killing the Nightsister leader, Sai Sircu, and terminating her alliance with Dooku and the Confederacy.[79][80]\n\nFrom Quell to Maridun[]\n\nWhile stationed aboard the Resolute, Rex accompanied Skywalker, Tano, and Yularen to aid Jedi General Aayla Secura, whose fleet was being ambushed by Confederate forces in the Quell system. By the time the Resolute arrived over Quell, two of Secura's Star Destroyers had fallen to a fleet of Munificent-class frigates; only Secura's command ship,[82] the Liberty, was maintaining altitude.[83] As the Separatists launched jetpack-equipped B2-RP battle droids[51] to board the Liberty, Rex, Skywalker, and Tano took several LAAT/i gunships with troops[82] from the 501st Legion to evacuate Secura and her 327th Star Corps personnel[84][85] from her crippled flagship. After Skywalker reached the cruiser ahead of the others, a B2-RP battle droid intercepted the gunship carrying Rex and Tano, who pulled their clone trooper pilot to safety in the troop bay after the battle droid forced him out of the cockpit. The droid also sabotaged the gunship's controls, plunging the craft uncontrollably toward Secura's flagship. As soon as they crashed through the Liberty's hull, Rex, Tano, and their squad jumped out of the burning transport without pause and began sprinting through the cruiser's corridors, disabling droids on their way to rendezvous with Skywalker and Secura.[82]\n\nRex and Tano caught up with Skywalker, Secura, and Marshal Commander CC-5052, nicknamed \"Bly,\" in one of the Liberty's hallways, and they headed to the ventral hangar to escape aboard a Consular-class cruiser that Skywalker had called in. As the gangway was extended to the frigate, the Confederate fleet's intensifying cannonades caused an inferno to rage through the Liberty. Sacrificing himself, Skywalker Force-pushed Rex and the others into the airlock, sealing the blast doors shut in both directions, then used the Force to hold back the advancing flames. Despite his efforts, the inferno finally blasted through, throwing him against the airlock. Once Tano and Secura had brought the wounded Skywalker aboard, Bly and a co-pilot detached their Consular-class cruiser from the Liberty. Just as Bly was docking their frigate to the Resolute, a Vulture droid attack inadvertently activated the frigate's hyperdrive. Although the Resolute maneuvered away in time, the frigate jumped to hyperspace with the Jedi, clone officers, and other troop evacuees aboard.[82]\n\nWhile Skywalker was treated in the medbay, Bly discovered that the navigation computer's incorrectly inputted coordinates had locked them on a collision course with a star in the Maridun system. Rex and Bly joined Secura and Tano on the bridge, and they decided to disengage the hyperdrive by shutting down all primary power units so that they could avoid colliding with the star. With Tano at the controls, Secura deactivated the frigate's power, bringing them out of hyperspace. Due to the vessel's uncontrollable speed and the lack of artificial gravity, Rex lost his grip on the back of Tano's seat and was smashed against Secura, breaking her hold on the power switch. Secura telekinetically reactivated the switch, enabling Tano to pilot the frigate out of its collision course with the star. Yet she could not stop the ship from heading toward the nearby planet Maridun. The frigate suffered damage while entering the planet's atmosphere before finally crash-landing. Rex, Bly, and the clones escaped first, and Rex helped another trooper out of the frigate while Tano and Secura jumped out with Skywalker, just before the ship exploded. Once they had erected a makeshift shelter for Skywalker from the wreckage, Secura, Tano, and Bly took their only surviving troopers—Cameron, Lucky, and Flash—to seek out medical aid for Skywalker while Rex stayed to watch over him. Before Tano left with the others, Rex assured her that he would take good care of her wounded Master and also wished her luck.[82]\n\nRex diligently guarded Skywalker through the night. When Skywalker finally awoke and tried to get up, Rex ran over and checked on his condition. However,[82] a carnivorous mastiff phalone[86] that had been watching the two for hours[83] attacked Rex, pinning him and trapping his blaster hand under one of its claws. Rex managed to fire a shot, startling the creature and scaring it away, and aimed several final blasts at its retreating form. Skywalker fell back asleep and did not reawaken until the next morning. When he did, Rex insisted that he maintain his rest, but Skywalker told him that he could hear the mastiff phalones returning. Both of them drew their weapons just as two of the creatures arrived and attacked. Rex gunned one of the beasts down, but the other charged into the makeshift shelter, knocking both him and Skywalker aside. At that moment, Tano and Bly returned with Wag Too, a healer from Maridun's village of Lurmen colonists. Too wrapped a rope around the feet of the remaining mastiff phalone, and Tano assisted Too—as did Rex, despite an arm injury—in tugging on the rope to topple the creature. Once it had fallen to the ground, Too secured the rope around its legs, preventing it from inflicting further harm. Rex then followed Tano, Bly, and Too back to the Lurmen village, with Skywalker in tow[82] on a stretcher cobbled together from the shelter's remains.[83]\n\nWhile the Lurmen tended to Skywalker's wounds, Rex kept watch on the outskirts of the settlement. During his shift, he noticed the arrival of a Confederate troopship and reported it to Bly, who was back at the colony with the Jedi and ordered him to return. Rex joined the others in the seedpod hut where Skywalker was being treated. Given that Maridun was a neutral world, the Jedi and clones decided to abscond before the Separatists found them so as to ensure that the Lurmen did not suffer for hosting them. Rex and Bly aided Skywalker and, with Tano and Secura following behind, made for a nearby field of tall grass behind the village. While there, Rex and Tano discussed the Lurmen's pacifism, denouncing the colonists as cowardly until Secura intervened and asserted that it took courage to follow one's beliefs. When Skywalker suggested that they pilfer a shuttle from the Confederacy to escape off-world, Rex agreed with his Jedi General, eager to steal from the Separatists. Tano then noticed that a Separatist recon droid was spying on them. Rex joined her and Bly in pursuing the probe droid, but it was Secura who disabled the probe by maneuvering in front of it through the grasses. Searching for the probe's origin from atop a nearby tree, Rex and his comrades discovered the Separatists' base and watched as General Lok Durd held a test run of his Defoliator, an experimental cannon capable of liquidating organic matter while leaving mechanical units unharmed.[81]\n\nAs Rex and Bly moved in for a closer look at the Defoliator, Durd sent two B1 battle droids—inadvertently, in the direction of the approaching clone troopers—to serve as test subjects.[81] When the Defoliator Deployment Tank[87] fired a capsule at the battle droids' location, it birthed an expanding wave of fire that decimated all life in the area, flora or otherwise. Rex and Bly turned and fled for higher ground, firing their blasters' ascension cables at the tree. Rex made it to safety, and though Bly tripped and misfired his cable, Secura swung down on a vine and pulled him to refuge. They watched as Durd departed with several squads of troops, and Skywalker concluded that Durd intended to test the Defoliator on the Lurmen village. Rex and the others resolved to protect the Lurmen, waiting until after nightfall to raid the Separatist base for a starship. Once Rex, Skywalker, and Bly had cut down the droid guards outside the facility, Tano and Secura opened the door, enabling the others to infiltrate the base. Using various crates as cover, Rex, Skywalker, and Bly reached the communication center and destroyed the droids in command. Rex noticed a pair of mobile shield generators and, at Skywalker's behest, helped Bly bring them aboard the Sheathipede-class shuttle that the Jedi had commandeered.[81]\n\nWhen Rex and the others landed at the Lurmen village at daybreak, the Lurmen chieftain, Tee Watt Kaa, did not appreciate their return, as he believed that they had brought the Clone Wars to Maridun. Rex soon caught sight of Durd's inbound battle group from the village's perimeter. In spite of protest from Kaa, Rex and his comrades formed a seedpod barrier to protect the village from the imminent engagement with Durd, working in teams to haul the seedpods in front of the settlement. Once Bly and Tano had moved the shield generators into place, Rex noted that Durd's battle droids were holding position a considerable distance away; Skywalker theorized that Durd would attempt to use his long-range artillery before mounting a charge. Sure enough, Durd had his droids fire a Defoliator shell, but the deflector shield proved effective in repelling the wave of destruction. Unable to do anything from afar, Durd sent in his first squad. While Skywalker, Tano, and Secura waded into the enemy ranks, Rex and Bly, remaining in front of the shield, provided covering fire with their DC-15A blaster rifles. Although they defeated the first wave of droids, the second wave—comprising Durd's second and third squads—swiftly followed.[81]\n\nDue to their superior numbers, numerous battle droids slipped past the three Jedi, forcing Rex and Bly to retreat behind the seedpod barrier. Despite the clones' efforts, the droids breached both the deflector shield and the seedpod wall and marched into the village, eliminating the shield generators. Secura and Tano joined Rex and Bly in defending the Lurmen, while Skywalker disabled the Defoliator Deployment Tank and captured Durd. Aided by Too and several other Lurmen, who sacrificed their pacifist upbringings to repel the invaders from their colony, Rex and his comrades eradicated the battle droids, preventing them from demolishing the village. With the battle over, Rex and Bly ushered the captured Durd and his Aqualish aide,[81] Pune Zignat,[88] into the Sheathipede-class shuttle. Too thanked the group for their efforts, as did Kaa, who nonetheless questioned the cost of the victory. As the Jedi and clones prepared to leave Maridun,[81] Admiral Yularen arrived in orbit with a fleet of Star Destroyers, having finally tracked the Jedi there from Quell.[89]\n\nWar on Orto Plutonia[]\n\nWhen the Republic lost contact with Glid Station, a base on Orto Plutonia, Rex went with Skywalker, Kenobi, and a detail of cold assault troops to investigate the lack of response. They were accompanied by Chairman Chi Cho and Senator Riyo Chuchi from the orbiting moon of Pantora, which claimed the ice world as a protectorate due to its lack of sentient life.[90] Upon arrival over Orto Plutonia aboard the Resolute,[51] Rex, Skywalker, Kenobi, and the Pantoran dignitaries proceeded to Glid Station aboard a landing force of LAAT/i gunships. Rex and his men were forced to use cold assault armor that,[90] while necessary for protection from the icy conditions, heavily restricted their movements in battle.[51] After landing at the base and having his men place sensor beacons to survey the area, Rex followed Kenobi inside, where they discovered that the clone troopers within had been slaughtered, though there was no evidence of a battle with Separatist droids. Following their scouts' discovery of a nearby Confederate base, Rex took several troopers aboard Freeco bikes to examine the facility with Skywalker and Kenobi.[90]\n\nAt the enemy outpost, which was composed of two connected XT Beetle Transports,[91] Rex assisted Skywalker in placing sensors around the building before entering the complex with his general. Sorting through the communication records in the control center, Kenobi uncovered a holorecording of a large life form attacking a B1 battle droid. While Skywalker and Kenobi speculated as to what had attacked the droid, Rex reported that the droids' log indicated that it had last been scouting the southern canyon. He returned to Glid Station with the other troopers while Skywalker and Kenobi followed up on the lead. As a storm brewed outside, the Jedi returned with news of their discovery—contrary to the findings of previous scouting parties, sentient life inhabited Orto Plutonia: a colony of the Talz species. Upon learning of the Talz, Cho sought to preserve Pantora's claim to Orto Plutonia and immediately ordered Rex to prepare his troops for battle with the Talz, but both Skywalker and Kenobi intervened and told him that they had arranged a meeting with the Talz to negotiate peace, much to Cho's chagrin. As the Republic forces prepared to leave for the rendezvous, Rex reported to Skywalker that their gunships would not be able to take off in the storm. Skywalker ordered the rest of the clone platoon to remain at Glid Station—despite Cho's aggressive claim to Orto Plutonia, the Jedi did not intend to go to war with the Talz.[90]\n\nRex set off with Cho, Chuchi, Skywalker, Kenobi, and their clone troops for the Confederate base, which was to serve as the neutral meeting ground with the Talz. Once there, Cho told Rex to position his men on a nearby ridge from which to ambush the Talz, but Kenobi countermanded the order, as the Talz had already arrived. Leaving Rex and the clone troopers outside with an explicit directive to avoid provoking the Talz, the Jedi and Pantorans entered into negotiations with Chieftain Thi-Sen. Despite the efforts of all other parties to prevent armed conflict, Cho declared war on the Talz in an effort to expunge them from Orto Plutonia, with no one present holding sufficient political authority to revoke his decision. While Skywalker, Kenobi, and Chuchi returned to Glid Station to determine a solution for the hostilities, Rex and his men took Freeco bikes and BARC speeders to accompany and protect Cho. When they encountered several narglatch-mounted Talz scouts near an ice ridge, Cho ordered the clones to open fire on the spot. Although Rex reminded Cho that they were only there for his protection, not to fight his crusade against the Talz, the captain and his troops were forced into battle when more Talz appeared and ambushed them. After a Talz warrior and his narglatch forced him out of his Freeco swoop, Rex retaliated by gunning down his attackers. He kicked over his bike for cover, ordering his men to do the same to form a defensive perimeter around Cho and his bodyguards from the Pantoran Guard.[90]\n\nAs the Talz flung spears at them, Rex ordered his men to retreat. Though Cho refused to pull back, one of the spears soon hit him, impaling him through the back. Acting with celerity, Rex slammed a BARC speeder into an advancing Talz and defended the wounded chairman from more of the warriors,[90] doing his best to fend off Cho's attackers.[1] He carried Cho onto a spare speeder and joined the rest of his men in their retreat. Yet further on, the collapse of an ice bridge across a gorge compromised their only path to safety. Despite being trapped between the ravine and the line of Talz warriors,[90] Rex was ready to fight to the last man.[91] As spears began to fly, he signaled the few survivors of his uni"
