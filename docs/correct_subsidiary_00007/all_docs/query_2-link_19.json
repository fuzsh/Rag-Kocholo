        "text": "ByteSphere® is a Boston based software company specializing in Global IT Management solutions. Our products are designed to optimize your IT infrastructure's performance, availability, and increase ROI, all while decreasing the complexity of IT management. In addition, we have ensured that our products are easily extensible and can integrate effortlessly with your existing infrastructure or network management software provider. This allows you to keep your investment in your existing data warehouse, monitoring and/or reporting solutions while implementing our next generation Integration Engine Units to perform critical collection, discovery, alerting with SNMP Traps and correlation functions.\n\nNetwork Management Software are needed to administer and monitor your networks, systems, and applications. OidView SNMP MIB Browser is a network management tool that uses the SNMP protocol to talk to various agents and devices on a computer network (e.g. applications, routers, switches, printers, servers, probes, etc). Engineers can use OidView to look at Interfaces, Memory and CPU Utilization, Bandwidth Utilization, User Accounting, Buffer and Interface statistics (including Errors, Discards, Octets, etc.) Our professional toolset includes MIB Browser, MIB Manager, MIB Compiler, Performance Poller, PDU Trace module, Entity MIB, and Interface Grid. All modules are available with the Enterprise license.\n\nFault Management solutions are needed to proactively capture, report, and act on SNMP Traps happening inside your network. Our Fault Management engine is capable of capturing and matching thousands of SNMP Traps each second and storing millions of matched and unfiltered alarms. The platform includes out-of-the-box pre-defined trap filters for many enterprise hardware vendors like Cisco, Juniper, IBM, etc. In addition, complex filters can be created by using multiple condition-based rules, providing to the administrator an unrivaled SNMP Trap matching and filter definition capability.\n\nPerformance Management uses a number of collection techniques to determine network, device, and resource utilization as well as a variety of other critical metrics; coupled with predictive modeling algorithms collected data can be used to determine MTBF, leveraged for capacity planning, or exported and shared with 3rd-party applications and systems for a wide range of functions. Jaguar's Monitor Engine (ME) can be used by itself or integrated with any 3rd-party NMS; allowing for efficient data collection and delivery to a variety of data and reporting sources. ByteSphere has also solved the scale issue, and our design allows for efficiently polling millions of network elements and utilizes a very small footprint.\n\nApplication Management is crucial to determine the health and availability of your mission critical applications and websites. ByteSphere Agent, our desktop prototype, can watch protocol utilization on any machine on a particular segment, and trace network traffic. The Jaguar App Management Engine (AME), will perform passive collection of application traffic and allow alerting and reporting of application related events and detect attacks when they occur. The AME can be standalone or will easily integrate with 3rd-party network management software and reporting packages.\n\nInventory Management uses a powerful, extensible discovery engine to get a holistic view of the agents, devices, and network applications, how they communicate, interact, and depend on one another. Once the topology of the network and the applications that run on it is defined, network maps and diagrams can be automatically created from the discovered information and overall dependency information can be determined. This in turn helps with Event Correlation.\n\nEvent Correlation determines how disparate events are related and makes predictions and alerts based on pre-defined heuristics. These heuristics can be created and extended by the user to allow for ultimate control of event reporting in the IT infrastructure. The Jaguar Event Correlation Engine (ECE) will be performing these tasks."
