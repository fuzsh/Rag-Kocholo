Bonjour. We will start.\n\n2 Good morning. I'm very pleased to be here at last, shall I say. We have been waiting for this hearing for a long time.\n\n3 Welcome to the Canadian Radio-Television and Telecommunications Commission public hearing to consider an application by three corporations -- namely, CanWest Global Communications Corporation, Corus Entertainment Inc., and Shaw Communications Incorporated -- for the ownership of various broadcasting undertakings of WIC, Western International Communications Limited.\n\n4 Je suis FranÃ§oise Bertrand, PrÃ©sidente du CRTC. Je prÃ©siderai cette audience.\n\n5 I would like now to introduce to you my colleagues who will form the Panel with me.\n\n6 On my right is AndrÃ©e Wylie, Vice-Chair, Broadcasting; on her right is Cindy Grauer, Regional Commissioner of British Columbia; on my left, David Colville, Vice-Chair, Telecommunications; and on his left, Joan Pennefather.\n\n7 The CRTC staff assisting us at this hearing are: Robert Ramsay, Hearing Manager; Karen Moore, Legal Counsel; and, Marguerite Vogel, Hearing Secretary.\n\n8 Also present from the Broadcasting Directorate are: Jean-Pierre Blais, Executive Director, Broadcasting; Neil Ketchum, Director, English and French Language Radio and Television; and, Lyne Renaud, Senior Corporate Officer.\n\n9 Please feel free to approach them with any procedural questions you might have.\n\n10 As you are no doubt aware, the proposed transactions are important and will have many consequences. Many have said, rightly so, that if accepted they would change significantly the Canadian broadcasting landscape. In summary, here is a quick description of the applications that we have before us.\n\n11 CanWest has applied to gain control of WIC's conventional television broadcasting undertakings, WIC's interest in ROBTv and WIC's remaining VOD asset.\n\n12 Corus has applied to acquire control of all of WIC's radio broadcasting undertakings. Corus has also applied to acquire control of some of WIC's pay and specialty television undertakings, WIC's interest in the Family Channel Inc., and control of one of WIC's video-on-demand undertakings.\n\n13 Shaw has applied to acquire control of Cancom Canadian Satellite Communications Inc.\n\n14 In light of the scope and complexity of the proposed deal, and the extent of the involvement of these companies in the Canadian broadcasting industry, this Panel would like to explore with the parties and the intervenors the impact and the benefits that the proposed deal might have on the broadcasting industry and on the choices available to Canadian consumers of radio and television and also the value, the contribution and the enhancement it represents for the companies that are applying.\n\n15 In looking at these applications, the Commission will also consider whether the proposed transactions will be of benefit from a programming perspective to the markets in question, cette Ã dire, the Canadian viewer, as well as to the broadcasting system as a whole.\n\n16 With these and other concerns in mind, this Panel would like to address a number of issues including:\n\n17 The level of concentration and consolidation of ownership and whether and how this could benefit the broadcasting system as a whole.\n\n18 The multiple ownerships that could result from the transactions, particularly in Vancouver, Victoria and Ontario, and the market dominance that could result for some of the parties.\n\n19 The diversity of voices in the radio sector resulting from this transaction, both overall and in specific markets such as Calgary, Edmonton and southern Ontario.\n\n20 And issues relating to vertical integration as Corus is affiliated with Shaw, a distributor and a television producer, and is involved in the pay and specialty sector. On this point I note that the Commission specifically requests Shaw to be available during the Corus phase of the hearing to discuss issues that are relevant to Shaw's role as a distributor.\n\n21 Comme je l'ai dÃ©ja mentionnÃ©, cette transaction est complexe et suscite beaucoup d'intÃ©rÃªt. Indeed, the Commission has received more than 1,000 interventions among which 30 of those intervenors will appear at the hearing during the next few days. In order to provide us with a clearer understanding of the proposed transaction and to make sure we get through all the material and presentations in the time allotted, this hearing will be organized as follows:\n\n22 First, we will hear the presentation from CanWest. The Panel will then question CanWest.\n\n23 After the questioning of CanWest is completed, we will then hear from and question Corus.\n\n24 Following Corus, Shaw will then make their presentation and be questioned in turn.\n\n25 Once the presentation and question sessions have been completed for all three, we will then hear the interventions in the same order.\n\n26 First, we will hear all interventions regarding CanWest. CanWest will then give its reply to the interventions.\n\n27 Following the interventions for CanWest, we will hear the interventions regarding Corus, the Corus reply and then, in turn, the interventions relating to Shaw and the Shaw reply.\n\n28 After we have heard all the presentations, we will then begin this process of considering all the information in order to come to a decision. We expect to issue a decision on this transaction this summer.\n\n29 I will now ask Marguerite Vogel, Hearing Secretary, to explain the procedures to be followed during this hearing. To all, I wish you a very good hearing, which I'm sure will be an interesting one.\n\n30 Thank you.\n\n31 MS VOGEL: Thank you, Madam Chairperson.\n\n32 Just a note that the applicants will have a maximum of 20 minutes to make their presentation to the Commission and that includes any video/audio presentation aids. Intervenors will have 10 minutes in which to address the Commission.\n\n33 Now some general administration. The public files associated with this hearing are available in the public examination room, which is Granville B, down the hall and to your left. However, the applications that are being addressed by the Commission in the hearing room will not be available in the public examination room as they will be in this room instead. But any of the other files are open for viewing by the public.\n\n34 Transcripts are being taken of this hearing. It is a verbatim transcript. Should you have any questions about getting copies of the transcript or parts of it, please talk to our court reporter who is sitting to my left. Thanks.\n\n35 We will be pleased to take telephone messages for people concerned with this hearing. Our phone number in the public examination room is of course area code (604) 666-6136. And if you want to have messages left, please do so. Commission staff will be pleased to post them outside the room as they come in.\n\n36 And I believe that completes the administrative details.\n\n37 Madam Chairperson, with your leave, we will call the first applicant, which is CanWest Global. CanWest Global has several applications pertaining to matters described in Public Hearing 2000-1, Notice of Public Hearing.\n\n38 I would ask you to start when you are ready.\n\n39 CHAIRPERSON OF THE COMMISSION: Before you start -- good morning -- maybe we could ask you, because there has been many questions and that could save a lot of time during the hearing, if we could have an update of the situation of the transaction as we speak and then we can go into the presentation.\n\n40 I believe you have been informed of that request from the Commission.\n\n41 MR. ASPER: Madam Chair, I will ask Glenn O'Farrell to respond to that.\n\n42 MR. O'FARRELL: Good morning, Commission.\n\n43 In effect, we have filed with the Commission a narrative describing the transactions that were executed and completed in accordance with the master agreement, and we are happy to advise you that all transactions have been executed as contemplated by the master agreement.\n\n44 With regards to ROBTv, WIC Television has purchased the Cancom interest and we will be in discussion with the Commission to have that interest placed in trust, the current trust that is approved by the Commission, subject to a discussion as to whether or not an amendment is necessary.\n\n45 Lastly, CTEQ. The Board of Directors of CTEQ assigned the company into bankruptcy on April the 11th.\n\n46 MS MOORE: If I could just confirm that you will be in a position to copy the appearing intervenors with the document as well.\n\n47 MR. O'FARRELL: Yes.\n\n48 PRÃSIDENTE DU CONSEIL: Alors, Ã vous.\n\nPRÃSENTATION / PRESENTATION\n\n49 M. ASPER: Bonjour madame la prÃ©sidente, membres du Conseil, membres du personnel. Mon nom est Leonard Asper. Il me fait plaisir du comparaÃ®tre devant vous en ma capacitÃ© de prÃ©sident et chef de la direction du CanWest Global Communications Corp.\n\n50 While our new President of Global Television Network, Kevin Shea, to my immediate right, will introduce our panel, I want to acknowledge some very important people that are with us in the audience today.\n\n51 By the way, if you think this took you a long time, if you think you were waiting a long time for this, I have had two children since this transaction started, so --\n\n--- Laughter / Rires\n\n52 MR. ASPER: And they are both out of diapers.\n\n53 But first and foremost, I want to acknowledge my father Israel Asper, the company's founder and the Executive Chairman, who is with us today.\n\n54 Also here is my brother, David Asper, a Member of the Board of CanWest and a Member of the Executive Committee of the Board.\n\n55 Peter Viner is here, the Vice-Chairman and former chief executive officer of CanWest, as well as Jim Sward, the Head of our Canadian Operations for the past seven years.\n\n56 I want to personally and publicly thank Jim as well as Loren Mawhinney for what they did in putting Global on the map of Canadian programming over the last seven years, because in those seven years we won more Gemini awards and had more Gemini nominations for excellence in Canadian programming than Global did over the past 20 years -- or the preceding 20 years before Jim came to the helm of Global. So I want to thank him for that, for bringing us to this point where we are ready to ascend to the national stage.\n\n57 Finally, I would like to welcome Gerry Noble, a Canadian who is coming home after a collective seven years in the South Pacific looking after CanWest operations in that region. Last week Gerry was named the new President and CEO of Global Communications, which is the company in which all of CanWest media operations in Canada reside.\n\n58 I wish to point out that I'm also here on behalf of and as a representative of my family, the controlling shareholders of CanWest, which in turn controls the licensees that are part of this application.\n\n59 We come before you today with an exciting plan. The transaction before you is one of the largest and most significant in the history of our industry. It represents the culmination of more than 25 years of building a company brick by brick and bringing it to the point where it is now ready to ascend to the national stage, and to be in a position to meet the severe threats and challenges that face our industry, including specifically the challenges of maintaining and increasing not only the presence but the prominence of Canadian programming and Canadian stories in our homes.\n\n60 This transaction began in concept more than eight years ago and took many twists and turns -- as you all know -- took steps backward and forward, and it sank and rose phoenix-like many times over the years. As the final act unfolds, let me say that we have appreciated the Commission's patience with all the parties involved as we tried to and finally did sort out the complexities.\n\n61 But the tragedy of this transaction is that when it began in earnest it was a daring, leading-edge idea that was ahead of its time. The length of time it has taken to reach this point has diminished that and now the circumstances are completely different.\n\n62 As a result, if we were here before you today four years or even two years ago, the questions that the Commission would be asking would be very different than they are today. There was no Internet to speak of when this began, no digital cable. There was no satellite. There was not even a third tier of specialty channels. Moreover, there was certainly no possibility of the potential addition of 450 new Canadian specialty channels, and not to mention the certain addition of U.S. channels to the Canadian cable systems and satellite systems which will accompany the new Canadian channels.\n\n63 In addition, during the last year media mergers, both within and outside of Canada, have now clearly become events that affect Canadians directly. Each of the following transactions, AOL Time Warner, CBC/Viacom, Pearson/CLT in Europe, Carlton United News in the United Kingdom, and even \"@home\", the Rogers giant that includes ATT and Microsoft and their proposed acquisition of VidÃ©otron, and, finally, Bell Canada's acquisition of CTV, which will be before you for approval in the coming months -- none of these transactions can be ignored in considering the applications before you today.\n\n64 We are believers that it is possible to make our Canadian broadcasting system stronger and in order to face the realities of international consolidation trends approval of our application will do that.\n\n65 But the benefit of the long gestation period of this application, after all of that has been said, is that the extent to which the landscape is being redefined is now becoming clearer and, as a result, CanWest is now able to put before you a comprehensive proposal that is without a doubt in our minds a home run for the Canadian broadcasting system.\n\n66 The conventional television industry is becoming and will continue to be radically revolutionalized by both globalization and technological innovation. Yet we are the foundation for quality Canadian programming and we want to remain so. To accomplish this we must collectively recognize, though, that the 20th century rule book for regulating the television and broadcasting industry needs to be reformed as we look at things through new, old, innovative and visionary eyes that see across the 21st century. We believe this application offers you that opportunity.\n\n67 So the only questions before you are: Should CanWest be strengthened to meet the challenges brought about by fragmentation and the consolidated positions of our domestic competitors and the disappearing borders with the resultant power that foreign companies can exert in Canada without contributing to the Canadian broadcasting system? Should we be allowed to own more television stations in Canada? Should we be allowed to converge as others are converging around us?\n\n68 We believe that the answer to these questions, each and every one of them, is a definitive yes. There are six principal reasons, Commissioners.\n\n69 Number one, the CanWest application is the best possible in the circumstances. Indeed it is the only one possible. No one else stepped forward to solve the WIC situation.\n\n70 Number two, the application is good for all components of the industry as well as the broadcast system as a whole.\n\n71 Number three, we are willing to accept safeguards to create winning conditions for everybody should the CRTC find that necessary.\n\n72 Number four, CanWest's unblemished record and history of good corporate and industry citizenship is such that our commitments are credible, reliable and certain to be delivered upon.\n\n73 Number five, denial of all or part of this application will be harmful to the communities served by the licensees involved who would not benefit from CanWest's ownership and who will once again be thrust into the uncertainties as to their ownership for yet another extended period of time.\n\n74 Finally, number six, Canada needs strong media companies who can invest in Canadian programming and, in order to do so, companies like CanWest need more platforms across which to amortize the cost of that programming and to promote Canadian programming.\n\n75 Therefore, let me be clear that we support growth for all companies in our industry, not just ours, provided that such growth does not at the same time weaken other companies who are essentially the broadcast system. We submit that this application meets that standard in all respects.\n\n76 Commissioners, this transaction is good not only for CanWest, it is good for Canadians and good for the broadcast system.\n\n77 I would now like to turn the microphone over to Kevin Shea to introduce our panel and elaborate upon my comments.\n\n78 MR. SHEA: Madam Chairperson, Members of the Commission, with us today in the front row from the left are: Katie Fullerton, from CanVideo Sales; as well as Glenn O'Farrell, our Legal Counsel; and, Loren Mawhinney, representing the Global Television Network.\n\n79 In the row behind me, from the left, are: Katherine Browne, who is our Financial Analyst for the Global Television Network; Art Reitmeyer, representing WIC; as well as Ken MacDonald, our Vice-President of News; and, Charlotte Bell, Regulatory Affairs, representing the Global Television Network.\n\n80 At the side table, representing our panel of experts, from the left are: Doug Hoover, our Vice-President of Programming; Jack Tomik, our Vice-President of Sales and Marketing; as well as Jim Rusnak, who is the President of our Western Operations. Also is: Ken Goldstein, President of Communications Management; and Craig Gibson, Senior Vice-President and Director for KPMG. And during your questions, these are the real experts that we may call upon.\n\n81 This proposal is all about bringing solutions to the Canadian Broadcasting system. First and foremost, this transaction will bring ownership stability to the WIC stations by providing a vision for the future and clear strategic and programming plans.\n\n82 The strong leadership of CanWest's management team will restore certainty for WIC employees and, more importantly, their communities. After many years of being a relative bystander, CHCH will re-emerge as a strong contributor to the Canadian broadcasting system.\n\n83 We believe that our Canadian system can only be strengthened and improved by financially strong players. We are making a substantial commitment to strengthen the Canadian conventional broadcast sector, both through the completion of the Global Television Network and by revitalizing local stations in other markets to create strong, relevant, independent stations.\n\n84 Glenn O'Farrell.\n\n85 MR. O'FARRELL: Through this application we are seeking approval with respect to four complementary initiatives:\n\n86 Number one, completion of the Global Television Network's national system through our acquisition of WIC's television stations in Calgary, Edmonton and Lethbridge.\n\n87 Number two, continuation of a strong, viable television service in Vancouver/Victoria by bringing CHAN into the Global television network and revitalizing CHEK-TV into a distinctively local television service.\n\n88 Third, revitalization of a strong, distinctive regional voice from the Hamilton market through the acquisition of CHCH-TV Hamilton.\n\n89 And, number four, continuing to provide CBC service in Red Deer and Kelowna.\n\n--- Short pause / Courte pause\n\n90 MR. SHEA: I'm sorry.\n\n91 In our response to interventions, we offered a series of safeguards and a code of conduct that we believed addressed the key competitive and policy issues they raised, but these parties are here still objecting. We indicated that if the Commission felt it was necessary we would be prepared to discuss our offering relating to safeguards.\n\n92 Among the key safeguards are a clear commitment on the eight hours of priority programming, a series of reports to the CRTC on our conduct and certain commitments to the industry at large. We submit that this application is the best available under the circumstances, consistent with the Commission's policy related to the transactions of this nature.\n\n93 In fact, the benefit package proposed in the context of this application far exceeds the Commission's policy in this regard. We have proposed a package of clear, unequivocal and tangible benefits valued at $84.2 million or 12.16 of the value of this transaction. In other words, we have exceeded the benchmark set by the Commission by more than 20 per cent. As a result, the communities in question, the broadcasting systems as a whole, and indeed the public interest would be well served by approval of this application.\n\n94 The approach that we have taken in building our benefits proposal falls into five broad categories. Together they are designed to address our overall strategy for building audiences to Canadian programming and creating an incubation opportunity for new programming concepts for local television in Hamilton and Victoria.\n\n95 Loren.\n\n96 MS MAWHINNEY: Thanks, Kevin.\n\n97 The whole philosophical thrust to our benefits package is to build more and better Canadian content and to ensure that this content reaches more Canadian viewers. In an environment characterized by the multiplicity of channels, content remains key. Producers continually advocate that they need more shelf space and incremental financing sources in order to create competitive and marketable programs. Our proposal directly addresses this issue by creating a number of new funds and opportunities for the creation of new Canadian content. In fact, more than one third of our benefits package of $84 million has been set aside to create new production opportunities for Canada's vibrant, independent production sector.\n\n98 For some time we have heard that western producers need dedicated production dollars. We have addressed this issue head on with the creation of the $23 million Western Independent Production Fund that will be available exclusively to producers west of the Ontario border. In addition, we have set aside more than $3 million for new productions in the areas of health, aboriginal programming, and new joint CBC initiatives.\n\n99 While the Commission's new television policy has ensured that a significant portion of our Prime Time schedules will be devoted to Canadian programming, we wanted to address the need for increasing audience to Canadian programs. If we are to remain strong and relevant in the face of fierce and increasing competition for viewership, then we must find innovative ways of increasing viewing to our Canadian schedules. This is why we have set aside $8 million to create a series of initiatives to do just that.\n\n100 These range from dollars dedicated to produce vignettes on successful and entrepreneurial Canadians to promotions to help build our star system to a special $5 million fund that will be administered by the CTF and dedicated solely to fund third-party promotion of Canadian programs appearing on all domestic broadcasting schedules.\n\n101 We have also set aside $1 million to help small and medium-sized producers market their products internationally.\n\n102 Further, we have sought to benefit the public in our new communities in other ways.\n\n103 Ken.\n\n104 MR. MacDONALD: Thank you, Loren.\n\n105 One of the fundamental components of our proposal is to restore local service to CHCH-TV in Hamilton and CHEK-TV in Victoria. In the face of increased competition, and in the case of CHCH-TV continuous ownership uncertainty and instability, these stations have all but lost their local focus.\n\n106 Now, throughout this process we have had numerous discussions with residents and key decisionmakers in these communities. The one resounding plea we have heard loud and clear in both markets is that residents want local service restored. In short, they want to see themselves reflected on their home town television station.\n\n107 Through significant investments and new local programming initiatives, CanWest has pledged to give these stations back to these communities and provide service and leadership to viewers in both Hamilton and Victoria. Our resolve is clear. We have made commitments of more than $18 million in the creation of new local programming for Hamilton, Victoria and Kelowna, in addition to more than $2 million in grants and endowments to key local arts groups in B.C., Alberta and Hamilton.\n\n108 We have also put forward a $10 million plan to produce an early evening national newscast originating from Vancouver and a weekend national public affairs program originating from Alberta.\n\n109 Now, both of these initiatives will bring to the entire Global Television Network a comprehensive news and public affairs component with a strong western-based editorial presence providing a true alternative to viewers across Canada, another national voice.\n\n110 MS BELL: Thank you, Ken.\n\n111 As the Commission knows, the growth of Canadian film, television and new media industries has exploded in the last few years. As the media sector continues to grow rapidly, we need, more than ever, qualified young people with the necessary training and skills to meet the demands of these new employment opportunities. This is why we have established a series of academic chairs, research grants and scholarships in Canadian colleges and universities, as well as a number of grants to key industry training centres such as the NSI, the Canadian Film Centre, the Film Circuit and Media Awareness. Together, these initiatives represent investments of more than $7 million.\n\n112 Finally, we believe that the only way to ensure that a country retains its cultural diversity and voice is by investing in national associations whose work is dedicated to that end. This is why we have made a number of significant contributions of more than $3 million to Canada's key national and regional cultural associations. These include the prestigious Banff Television Festival, Concerned Children's Advertisers, and Canadian Women in Communications.\n\n113 With respect to our support for the National Reading Service for the Blind, NBRS, they have approached us with a request to advance the promised $500,000 in its entirety upon approval of our application given their current severe financial situation. Today we are prepared to make that commitment.\n\n114 MR. REITMEYER: Good morning, Madam Chairperson and Members of the Commission. As you are aware, I am the President and CEO of WIC Television Limited. I have been with the WIC group for a number of years and prior to that worked at CanWest.\n\n115 I do not wish to dwell on the past number of years other than to say that for the employees of WIC it has been a period of uncertainty and insecurity. It is our view that the CanWest proposal will change this and bring to our group of stations and management a future of prosperity, hope and certainty.\n\n116 The plans that have been built by CanWest in their application call for an exciting number of initiatives that include direct participation in network programming and real commitments to local revitalization in Hamilton and Victoria. Our stations, our staff and our viewers cannot afford any more uncertainty and we hope for a speedy and positive decision emanating from our discussions this week. They are highly supportive of this transaction and are anxious to join the CanWest team. Another term of uncertainty would be devastating to them personally and to the communities they serve.\n\n117 MR. ASPER: We would like to now draw your attention to a short video presentation.\n\n--- Video presentation / PrÃ©sentation vidÃ©o\n\n118 MR. ASPER: I'm certain you might have one or two questions. We will now be prepared to answer those.\n\n119 Thank you for your attention.\n\n120 CHAIRPERSON OF THE COMMISSION: Thank you very much for the presentation.\n\n121 I will have the pleasure of starting. I will be asking questions concerning how the world has evolved. You said that if it had been two years ago it would have been a very different question, so we will see what kind of questions you would have seen fit then and that you see more fit today.\n\n122 Then we will talk about, more specifically, the strategy of Global: Where do you see, in this world that is evolving, being capable of drawing on the transactions that you are proposing here?\n\n123 I will then focus my attention on the dual ownership issue, mainly talking about the situation of course of Victoria and Hamilton but also trying to understand how it fits with your national strategy itself.\n\n124 Then I will turn to my colleagues for help. Mrs. Wylie will be talking with you about the national scene in terms of programming and profile, as well as the individual markets. Then Commissioner Grauer will talk about the benefits, the intangible and the tangible ones.\n\n125 Our colleague, Karen Moore, the legal counsel, will, in the case we would need to, go for an hypothesis of a divestiture, what would be the dimensions there. She will cover that with you.\n\n126 So this is the plan of the questioning. I will start. Probably we will then break and then come back with the rest of the questioning.\n\n127 So let's start slowly with the world that evolved so rapidly. I would like to get your understanding.\n\n128 You know, not so long ago we were doing the third national network. We went for the TV Policy, where we felt that the world had changed. I often say when I do now the preparation for the new Strategic Plan at the Commission that we didn't wait for the AOL transaction to tell us that the world was changing. I think the third Network Hearing was a sign of that, the TV Policy, and also of course the New Media Policy. So those are certainly elements for you that are significant.\n\n129 Can you tell us what you see so dramatically different from the last two years and where do you see -- how many groups do you see? You tend to be a preacher of bigger, better. You know, how many bigger do you see in Canada? And can you describe, if you were take us by the hand, what kind of world would you see in the next three years in the broadcasting scene, of course, for Canada?\n\n130 MR. ASPER: Well, starting with your first question, what's different, I think you are right in saying that AOL Time Warner wasn't -- it may be a watershed but it was preceded by several ripples that became waves that finally became the megadeals of AOL Time Warner and CBC and Viacom and others that I have mentioned.\n\n131 Over the last three years media companies have been doing several things. They have been -- number one, any company that was in the exhibition business, the business of owning a channel or two, has been seeking to have as many exhibition platforms as they possibly can over the electronic medium, the television spectrum. They have also been building other, what I would call, horizontally integrated enterprises, enterprises that include not only television, whether it's conventional or specialty, but radio, print, magazines, possibly outdoor advertising.\n\n132 At the same time these companies, particularly companies in the United States, have been -- that would be what I would call horizontally integrating, but they have also been vertically integrating, which is producing and owning and exploiting the rights to their own content, and using those exhibition platforms to exploit that content and promote the content that they own.\n\n133 This really didn't start to accelerate until the capacity on the distribution systems was able to accommodate it.\n\n134 For years there have been some television and radio co-ownership, particularly in the United States, but it really hasn't gotten to the pace where it is today until the cable systems and the distribution systems, and, in some sense, not yet, but to a small extent -- but to a much larger and growing extent, the Internet showed up. The Internet allows an unlimited number of exhibition platforms, if that's what you went with. That's what we call them.\n\n135 So companies are now saying, \"Gee, we used to own 50 per cent of the market. We were one of two channels. We used to own 33 per cent of the market. We were one of three channels. Now we are one of 70 channels.\" And what most companies are trying to do and have done in the past -- the larger companies and the survivors in the last three years -- is to reaggregate those audiences they have lost, the fragmentation, and try to group it back and try to have some remote proximity to the kind of share they used to have before.\n\n136 So turning to Canada, I think there will be about five to ten major media groups in Canada who will have all of these components. And I haven't come to distribution yet, the pipelines, because there are content companies in this world and there are pipeline companies. There are people who deliver the content over some sort of infrastructure, whether it be wireless, cable, satellite, telephony. Those companies; the second part of convergence. There's the convergence of all the different exhibition platforms or advertising platforms and then there's the second part of convergence, which is the joining of those with the distribution. That's where convergence becomes, in our view, potentially something of serious concern because there's the issue of is the distributor controlling what goes into people's homes.\n\n137 We are not in that game yet. CanWest is a content company. We are not a pipeline company. As there become other mergers and alliances and joining of distribution pipeline companies with content companies, CanWest too will have to seek strategic partners and alliances. And I think you will see in the next few years all of the content players joining together and joining with pipeline players, just as, you know, Bell Canada has sought to do with CTV, just as in Europe the largest cable operator in Europe has bought an 11-country network of stations. It's happening all over the world.\n\n138 In Canada, as I say, there will probably be five to ten major companies. There will be an underlayer of several start-up and new and growing companies that will be fostered by these companies, because these larger companies can't possibly do everything in-house. They can't create this walled garden that is an island unto itself. They have to always go outside for -- they have to outsource, whether it's facilities; they have to outsource programming. They may have to outsource sales and marketing. So there will be a second layer of a whole bunch of new companies or companies that exist today that will grow with the growth of the five to ten major companies.\n\n139 CanWest's view is to be -- CanWest's strategy is to be one of those five to ten companies but to also be able to draw on the resources of those other companies that exist, that produce the content that we are going to need for the various platforms we seek to own.\n\n140 I'm not sure what your third question was. Something in regard to three years from now, is that -- are you saying: What does CanWest look like three years from now?\n\n141 Well, it's very simple. We want to be -- we focus more on what I call the horizontal integration side than the vertical integration side for the reasons I have said earlier.\n\n142 I think our strongest position and the position we intend to go to is being a company that has a very large number of exhibition outlets. When I say \"exhibition outlets\", I mean Global television, I mean Prime TV, I mean medbroadcast.com, which is a health Web site that we bought into, and hopefully, if you grant us approval for the Health Channel, which we have partnered with Medbroadcast to apply for, that, and many other specialty channels just like our competitors have.\n\n143 It means being in the out-of-home, outdoor advertising business, having closed-circuit networks in airports like other companies in Canada already do. It means having magazines. It means maybe starting new magazines that derive from a global program. Oprah Winfrey has a magazine called \"O\" which is derived from her program. It means taking content we own the rights to, such as FOX has done. FOX has a show called the \"X-Files\", as we know. They have 30 books that derived from the show.\n\n144 What we have got to try to do is take that horizontally integrated company and take the content that we have within that company and use those platforms to generate more revenue and generate more content for that company.\n\n145 I would also add radio to that. The horizontally integrated media company of the future will have radio, it will have exhibition outlets, it will have print -- and when I say \"exhibition\" I also mean Internet-based exhibitions -- and it will have some sort of content supply machine in-house, but it will not be exclusive.\n\n146 The content that is created in-house will be distributed over the platforms. It will be sold to other companies who may wish to pay more or maybe have a better use for the content, but it will always be available within the group. But there can never be a walled garden of content that's exclusive because, as we do every year when we sit down to decide our Canadian programming schedule and our foreign programming schedule, we find that Laslo Barnett has the best idea this year and Forefront has the best idea next year, and Salter Street has a good idea. So there is no monopoly on good ideas in one shop.\n\n147 So the purpose of the horizontal integration is to be able to promote the content that we do exhibit and that we do own and generate as much as we possibly can from it. And that's where I think everybody is getting to, whether they are coming at it from different means.\n\n148 Alliance Atlantis was a producer. They sought to own exhibition outlets. They started on the ownership of content end and they have gravitated towards their integration by coming and acquiring and offering very well specialty channels.\n\n149 Radio companies, you know, take Shaw, take Corus, Corus started with radio and now it's trying to acquire specialty channels.\n\n150 So I think there will be a similarity of these five to 10 companies that will be competing in the same space and we'll be in that space we hope.\n\n151 CHAIRPERSON OF THE COMMISSION: Tell me, in that universe some say that broadcasters will not be necessary any more. I'm not saying that's the Commission's view, but some have said in the Internet world there will not be any need for broadcasters any more. What's your view and why do you see, being a conventional broadcaster today, the necessity to reinforce your position? Why do you see that as promising into the evolving world you're describing?\n\n152 MR. ASPER: Well, number one, I think broadcasters will always be the bastion of local programming, of local reflection in people's markets. We will be the only ones who are willing to invest primarily because we are already there and it does not make sense for most players to try to start and take that niche away from broadcasters.\n\n153 I'm heartened by my travels in the United States where I look at -- we look at local -- we spend a lot of time with local broadcasters, and they're investing more money in local programming. They're starting local offshoots. Because of the way the regulation works, they can go to the local cable company and start a local weather network and a local regional news network. They're taking their programming and their local reflection plans and expanding and putting more resources into it, and with great success.\n\n154 I think it's ironic that national players like CBC are pulling out of local. We see that as a very strong niche that we can exploit and we can be a bigger player in, and we can generate more viewership to our local programming. That's why the kind of plans that are before you today are before you today. We see a very valuable service being provided to the local communities as specialty channels proliferate which are only national.\n\n155 So we think there's a very strong role for the Canadian broadcaster. I think the Internet is a factor, but it's a long way away in terms of being able to provide the kind of service that a local broadcaster provides. It will be five to seven years at best before the Internet is even in 50 per cent of people's homes as a broadband tool.\n\n156 And there are still 25 per cent of Canadians who don't have multichannel television. Who provides them that service? Local broadcasters. And there are only three -- sometimes less than three in the case of Hamilton -- there are less than three people who provide that service to them. We think there's a valuable service to be provided.\n\n157 So there's a long-term role for the broadcaster. Whether he is called a broadcaster in five years is another thing. It's a programming service. Internet Web sites are programming services. They're primitive compared to what a broadcaster can provide, but the brand and the local reflection is what we think is going to be our specialty and where we will have our success.\n\n158 CHAIRPERSON OF THE COMMISSION: In your brand, what do you see as driving your brand, then, in that universe?\n\n159 MR. ASPER: The local content. The fact that people can turn on and find out what is going on in their town. We have found always that people come back to: What's going on around me? What's going on within a kilometre of me? I mean, we have something on our Web site now that is a weather service that Gary Maavara dug up that provides weather within half a kilometre of your home. And that's something that has been tried in the U.S. and has been very, very popular. The closer it is to home, the more people want to find out about it.\n\n160 People care more about local news than they do about national news and certainly more than international news. Our research, our experience has been that. That's the niche that other people are abandoning and we find, especially based on our studies of how it's worked in the United States, that's a niche that will remain there forever. It's human nature.\n\n161 CHAIRPERSON OF THE COMMISSION: So what you see in what you seem to think is five to seven years, in that world, that could be more programming services on the Net. When people will come for your brand, it will be for getting the information that is close to their home.\n\n162 MR. ASPER: M'hm. Yes.\n\n163 CHAIRPERSON OF THE COMMISSION: And whatever domain around the news area.\n\n164 MR. ASPER: M'hm.\n\n165 CHAIRPERSON OF THE COMMISSION: That's how you see --\n\n166 MR. ASPER: Not just news but news and information and even coverage of local events, local sports, local theatrical and entertainment events. We have found there has always been an interest in those kinds of things and, to some extent, being there first, developing the local brand, is a very powerful tool because we have come into markets, like New Zealand, where we acquired a bankrupt third network that was not first in people's minds -- number one in mind shares they call it -- and we have, for ten years, not been able to put that station into the number one or two position in the market. To some extent, it's been complicated by the fact that we are competing against a government network, but the fact is it's been number three for 30 years or 20 years and it's very hard to break into people's minds once they have got a certain place they go for their trustworthy news and whatever else they get.\n\n167 So we think that we have got a golden opportunity, particularly in the stations we are seeking to acquire, to become that number one source of information and news in the markets where we seek to acquire these stations. Once you have that brand, it is very difficult for other people to dislodge you. And we think that, when we come back to why we want to grow, it's the ability to put the resources into that kind of programming that will be the engine of those stations.\n\n168 MR. SHEA: If I may, Madam Chair. I think the question was posed of broadcasters being relevant, and I think what Mr. Asper has been trying to articulate is our strategy specific to how to remain relevant as a brand in the years ahead. We see it as twofold.\n\n169 One, to be the strongest in local information so that if we are ever retransmitted on the Net as a full-up station, that people would go there as well as cable, but to have a national overlay of content that is very, very high in entertainment that is, in effect, the national brand of the company, programming that people can't get anywhere else but Global Television Network and Prime Time. That's a challenge I think all of us broadcasters face in this country and the years ahead because, as has been articulated time and time again, we are renters of content. We rent shows for two or three years.\n\n170 We are exposed in the long term with respect to that as certain international networks become more international in their distribution and could, in effect, replicate the kinds of programming that we currently get from them. That's why we have undertaken the strategy with Fireworks, because in the long term we have to be owners of our own content, because it's the only element of our brand that we can ultimately protect.\n\n171 While we see that as our mainstream strategy with respect to Global, we have specific strategies with respect to CH and Victoria, which we will talk about later, but we have also elected other areas of content where we see vacuums at the moment, more Net-related at the moment.\n\n172 With respect to medbroadcast.com, health is the number one reason or among the number one reasons why people go to the Web for information. We invested in a company a year ago called Lifeserve in the United States which is also a Web-based health and lifestyle service because we see a combined strategy of having to be relevant with tomorrow's technology, the Net, while protecting and building our brand for Global for tomorrow.\n\n173 I think one of the answers that crossed my mind with respect to your opening question, and that is what's different about today that may not have been there two or three years ago, one of the most significant differences for me is that our business is no longer predictable. In all fairness, conventional broadcasting, and to some degree specialty broadcasting, was a very predictable business. You bought a schedule, you knew in advance what advertisers were looking for in terms of their demographic needs and you could build a business plan for one or two or three years.\n\n174 Today you can't do that. We are sitting here in April. We have no real sense of what the advertising market next year is going to be like, primarily because there are now so many new technology users in the primary business of advertising that we are seeing new niches of content go at the same advertising pool that is the primary economic driver of our business. And it is no longer predictable. It used to be.\n\n175 MR. ASPER: Let me just summarize when I said we were a content company.\n\n176 The reason we are a content company is because we believe no matter what the distribution mechanism it will find its way to people's homes. If it's good content people will want it and they will find a way to get it and distributors will want to distribute it.\n\n177 When I say \"content\", I really mean three streams of content: it's the news and information content, whether it's local or national, like public affairs that concern the country as a whole; it's drama/entertainment programming, which was the reason we acquired Fireworks -- and that's the one fear where I said earlier that that's not an exclusive situation because that's -- one can simply not produce all of the programming one needs in one's own shop -- and the third one is, as I have said before, sports information, coverage of sports events. That is something that people -- people have their home teams, they want to see their home team. There are national teams as well, but that's another area we do plan to get into in greater depth.\n\n178 But in the entertainment programming area, it's more of a defensive strategy than an offensive strategy. I think Kevin hit the nail on the head. It's the concern that someday the other players, when there's unlimited channels, the suppliers of our content, the traditional suppliers, will say, \"No, CanWest, we are distributing it on our own channel. We own the FOX channel. We own the Alliance channel. Why would we sell to you?\"\n\n179 There will be some point in time where the intersection occurs between the price that these players get for selling the territorial rights to Canada and the price they can generate by putting it on their own channels and selling their own advertising. So that's somewhat more of a defensive strategy.\n\n180 But those are the three streams of content: news and information, drama/entertainment and sports. That's what we intend to build.\n\n181 CHAIRPERSON OF THE COMMISSION: As you can imagine, from the Commission's responsibility point of view of the objectives of the Broadcasting Act, that's not bad news because then it will leave probably the best incentive for creation of Canadian content.\n\n182 MR. ASPER: M'hm.\n\n183 CHAIRPERSON OF THE COMMISSION: I would like to know your views about serving -- you know, there has been a lot of discussion of the larger groups, and I don't want to talk about what CBC can do because that's not the matter at all in front of us today, but going into the strategy you're proposing, what do you see as being, in this country, the rights of the people who don't live in the urban centres? Even with your strategy -- you're in certain centres. What happens to the other people in other communities in Canada?\n\n184 What's your view about that? Do you think there should be other players playing that role or do you see that eventually Global, if granted those licences, would expand and serve all -- you know, is it a right for every Canadian to have information closer to home, in all parts of the country?\n\n185 MR. ASPER: Well, I think it's -- I'm not sure of the connotations of a right because I think Canadians should, as a matter of principle, have as much information as they possibly can, especially Canadian information, and dramatic programming as well -- Category 7 programming, to use your categorizations.\n\n186 If Global could, Global would expand, and we have tried to before, to all over Canada. There is probably a million Canadians, half a million Canadians that even if all of this were granted we still wouldn't cover and we would like to cover and we would like to have access to.\n\n187 Now, the Internet and satellite systems to a large extent are resolving that issue to the extent people can afford them. But it's true that there are still a number of people who can't afford service other than what they are getting from over-the-air, from CBC, but if there's ever an opportunity for Global to grow and expand and reach those people, we would seek it.\n\n188 CHAIRPERSON OF THE COMMISSION: But don't you think, in the universe you were drawing, that in five years, seven years from now the over-the-air won't mean that much and that there will be other ways for those citizens to get services?\n\n189 MR. ASPER: I think it's going to be a longer period of time before that happens. I think there's going to be -- in terms of universality, of being able to see all of these services. In the meantime, I think that people can't -- people operating Web sites today, for example, are not spending fives or tens or twenties of millions of dollars programming these Web sites. They're going to the financial markets, they're raising a few million dollars and they're spending it on computers and they're putting very limited information on their service, if that's what you can call it.\n\n190 I think it's a long time before there will be this unlimited plethora of quality, first-class choice in people's homes. I think the conventional broadcaster, for many years to come, will have a role to play in being the main provider for these communities.\n\n191 MR. SHEA: Madam Chairperson, the principal reason today that a consumer elects to take either cable or satellite services is principally for the receipt of conventional television programs. That hasn't changed too much, although our share of audience with respect to where we were 10 or 15 years ago versus where we are today has declined. But we are still the principal reason why people connect to cable.\n\n192 The trick for us in the long term will be to ensure that we still have a similar type of content, the more higher end and more relevant entertainment programming, to ensure that we remain the number one pick for consumers. I think what clearly is going to happen in the next four to five years is that conventional broadcasters are going to have to think long and hard about the method of their own distribution.\n\n193 It's very costly, analog technology, and it's clearly becoming outdated. And we have a significant investment ahead of us with respect to the move to digital. As we all know, there isn't an economic model yet that says the investment in digital will bring about a new stream of revenue, because it's essentially just replicating our signals and services today. No doubt, in the hearings ahead, when we look at the longer term policy aspects of conventional television, I think, Madam Chairperson, that there is going to be a demand by conventional broadcasters shifting to digital to have the right or to have the opportunity to actually have new streams of content in order to see some kind of revenue return.\n\n194 But it also comes back to, when one clearly looks at what's happening with regard to the future of conventional, and the investments ahead of it, that unless we have very strong economic-based companies in this country, we will not be allowed -- we will not be in a position to afford that kind of investment for tomorrow.\n\n195 But one thing is absolutely paramount, and that is we also have to have access on a continuum of the higher end content, whether we make it or buy it. Our emphasis I think will remain much the same as it is today, and that is it's typically in news, both local and national, because we are the best people in that position today to do that -- I say \"we\" as conventional broadcasters -- and access to entertainment that people cannot get elsewhere. And that's the challenge ahead.\n\n196 CHAIRPERSON OF THE COMMISSION: Well, I guess we can certainly understand that. Some time ago, we granted Global a licence in Quebec. I don't think in our mind, you know, there's much questioning around the Alberta station. Of course the questions arise around the dual ownership in some markets, and it's important that we do understand what's your view but strategy as well.\n\n197 You know, although we can understand that somewhat bigger is better and that you're not seeking a position for only yourself, that you see that there is space for other important players in Canada, yet it is really in that domain that there is a particular question. It would be important to understand why you think that owning those two stations in the extended market in Vancouver and the one in Hamilton versus the regional situation in Ontario is important to make Global a stronger player? How does it bring you to be a stronger player?\n\n198 You know, for some time we thought, especially after the third Network Hearing, that you're ambition and your strategy was to become a national player. Why didn't you stop with strictly the transaction that dealt with the Calgary station? Why do you go and make a case for Hamilton and Victoria? Why is it important? What kind of leverage is it for you?\n\n199 MR. SHEA: Madam Chairperson, this is the question that we have rehearsed for two weeks.\n\n--- Laughter / Rires\n\n200 CHAIRPERSON OF THE COMMISSION: I just thought about it. I'm glad I did.\n\n--- Laughter / Rires\n\n201 MR. ASPER: I lost my briefing notes, so --\n\n202 CHAIRPERSON OF THE COMMISSION: It's a good thing I rehearsed it in English too.\n\n--- Laughter / Rires\n\n203 MR. SHEA: And it was very well presented.\n\n204 I have about seven or eight people who are now prepared to jump in on the answer to this question and, with your permission, I think this is the way we would like to start.\n\n205 I would like Doug Hoover and Loren Mawhinney to address the issue of branding and ensure that we leave the Commission with the impression that we have a distinct approach as to how to brand Global, now that it will become a national network upon your approval of Alberta, and a distinct approach as to how we plan to program what we call the independents in Hamilton and Victoria. I would like to start there with their vision of how we plan to program those.\n\n206 Then I would like to ask Ken Goldstein to comment on market impact, dominance, the issues that have been raised by many of our learned intervenors with respect to what this would amount to should the Commission, and hopefully it will, approve us.\n\n207 Then I would like Leonard Asper to also comment on why, from a corporate perspective, more shelf space is necessary for our company going forward, and I'll see how we have come at the answers with respect to those and I might supplement with some others.\n\n208 CHAIRPERSON OF THE COMMISSION: Okay. To be clear, I will not be questioning thoroughly all the programming matters. The one I'm interested in is the overlapping, the 10 per cent and what will be different. And the other elements are exactly -- you prepared for the right answer.\n\n209 MR. SHEA: I respect that.\n\n210 MR. HOOVER: Madam Chair, when we speak of the two services, we look at them with the benefits that each provides that is unique from the other. When we speak of Global, we speak of a service that is strong, national, national information, national programming, and one that serves all of Canada with the inclusion of the Alberta stations, of course.\n\n211 Global will position itself to a younger audience than that of the independent stations. Global has tended to be a service that's targeted more through a demographic that we characterize as 18 to 34.\n\n212 By contrast, the independent stations will focus its audience to the older demographic, more akin of a 25 to 54 demographic.\n\n213 The independent stations will focus on localism, local programming, local news, local information, so that there's separation between their targets. Global will continue on its current program strategy of being series program, appointment television, consistent. We have tended to stay away from and will continue to stay away from miniseries or events or theatrical movies. We have no intention to purchase theatrical movies, where the independent stations will tend to provide miniseries, made-for-television movies, event television.\n\n214 Hamilton in its heyday was known as the event television station, and so we would like to take it back to providing that type of service.\n\n215 In terms of the eight hours of priority programming, they will be unique and distinct and different on both services. I would like to have Loren Mawhinney elaborate as to how those two will be targeted to separate and distinct audiences.\n\n216 MS MAWHINNEY: Thanks, Doug.\n\n217 So as Doug says, the eight hours on CHCH and CHEK will be completely discrete and separate from the eight hours that are on the Global Television Network. The independent stations, our programming plans obviously aren't as solidified as they are for the Global Television Network because we knew what we were going to be ordering from the funds for those stations. So for the Global Television Network we have continuation of \"Bob and Margaret\", we have two new sitcoms because we are trying to get to a younger audience, the 18 to 34 audience, as Doug says.\n\n218 Programs that are set. Across the country we have got a sitcom set in Vancouver called \"The Agency\" where we have repatriated two of our most successful Canadian writers living in Los Angeles, David Steinberg and Frank VanKeegan, who are going to run this. We are doing 22 half hours with them. Then we are doing another half hour comedy with Salter Street out of Halifax, a very politically incorrect, historical drama called \"Blackfly\". And we have an hour long police series that's produced by Laslo Barnett in Toronto.\n\n219 So all those are continuing with Global's philosophy of appointment television/series television. The only exception to that is a signature series of documentary specials. So we just did the \"Hockey Riots\" with Rocket Richard. In May, we are launching a two-hour feature on the Reichmans, and we did another one on the holocaust called \"Each of Us has a Name\". So those give us programming hits during the season when we can't get covers because we have already launched our series. So it gives us an opportunity to have some -- create more attention and create more publicity for our stations.\n\n220 With the independents, we are looking for family viewing, general family viewing, so we have a series in development with Crescent Entertainment that is a Canadian \"Northern Exposure\". A small, quirky town shot in Tofino. Something that would also work is a series called \"Cliff Hangers\" -- 22 hours about troubled youths and they use \"Outward Bound\" philosophy in order to help get them back into the mainstream.\n\n221 In addition to that, we would run movies and miniseries. So we would have event programs over there that we wouldn't have on the Global Television Network. That would also give us an opportunity to work with smaller producers who tend to produce long forms as opposed to series just because it's such a heavy capital investment to make in those series.\n\n222 MR. SHEA: I would now like to call upon Mr. Goldstein.\n\n223 MR. GOLDSTEIN: Madam Chairperson, Leonard Asper, in his initial response to your question, talked about the need for broadcasters to reaggregate audiences as a result of fragmentation, and to reaggregate those audiences both within the broadcasting system and horizontally to other media by being able to operate across a number of platforms. It is of course partly a matter of reaggregating the audience to achieve a certain size, and it's also a matter of being able to use those multiple platforms to cross-promote to make the sum really greater than the simple -- or the result simply greater than the sum of the parts.\n\n224 So, in that context, the proposal to retain the independent stations in Hamilton and Victoria represents a strategy to acquire another platform within a world where a number of the players around the world, and of course a number of the players in Canada, have also got multiple platforms. Some have multiple platforms based on one conventional and multiple specialty services. Others have more than one conventional and multiple specialty services. And so in this context we see that this is a way of building up a requisite number of platforms in order to compete successfully in this marketplace.\n\n225 We have of course looked at a number of different market share criteria, and we can discuss those in detail if you wish, but the resulting market share relationship from the proposal that is before you would see CTV, as you have approved its going-forward structure, with about a 29 per cent share of revenue through its various platforms, and CanWest, if you approve this proposal, with about a 25 per cent share of revenue across its platforms.\n\n226 So we tend to see this as a question of platforms and a question of how the various pieces can fit.\n\n227 MR. ASPER: I'll try and put this also into context.\n\n228 It comes back to some measure of defensive issues, because if you look at the Canadian dial today, simply the number of channels on the Canadian dial, you have CHUM with nine, you have CTV with six and others that are -- the licences they have that have not yet been launched and may be launched soon.\n\n229 You have Time Warner, an American company, with three. More than CanWest. You have NBC, another American company, with more channels on the dial than CanWest. What they're doing with those channels is they are cross-promoting, cross-promoting, cross-promoting. They are in a much stronger position to create more revenue, more viewers for their programming, than CanWest is today. We are one channel.\n\n230 In 85 per cent of urban Canadian homes and 75 per cent of Canadian homes overall, nobody knows how they get their channels. All they see is CTV, CTV, CTV, CHUM, CHUM, CHUM and then Global. And we are now in a position where we need to survive and to prosper and to be able to make the investments we have to make in the kind of content I was referring to earlier. We need to have the ability to use those platforms. As I said, they extend beyond platforms on the dial. As a corporate strategy it may mean magazines or print or some other form of bolstering, or our integration strategy, but on the dial where a great number of Canadians go each night when they come home, we are at a significant disadvantage to the other players.\n\n231 If you look at Hamilton in particular, or the Toronto-Hamilton marketplace in particular, there are cable channels that before they start their day, January 1, before their year begins, they have more revenue from subscription revenues than Hamilton will get all year from advertising revenues. So they have bigger programming budgets than Hamilton has.\n\n232 That's the kind of world we are facing, and that's why, you know, we think Hamilton alone, never mind other channels we hope to acquire or start up in the future, is something that is simply a step forward for us in catching up to our competitors.\n\n233 CHAIRPERSON OF THE COMMISSION: (Off microphone / sans microphone...) pursue on -- there are three elements of the answer.\n\n234 I will start with you, Mr. Asper. When you talk about the multiplatform, still I hear you say that the conventional broadcaster is there to stay. Although we have seen many specialty channels there, and they have taken certainly an increased place in the market shares and advertising revenues as well, we see that the revenues of the conventional broadcasters are still much more important and significant in this country, so although you can say it's windows, the significance of windows has to be weighted in, and you cannot say two windows equals two windows. It depends which windows they are. And the specialty channels, by the fact, for example, that there is no simultaneous substitution, certainly don't have the same weight as owning two conventional broadcasters.\n\n235 So I can certainly understand your argument about the necessity, and the one of Mr. Goldstein about saying multiple platforms is important, but yet how do you figure out or take into account not the strict number of windows, but rather the importance that represents still today and for some years, given, you know, the future you were drawing for the next few years, the importance of owning conventional broadcasting stations?\n\n236 MR. ASPER: Well, I think it's worth reiterating that while conventional broadcasters have simultaneous substitution they do not have subscription revenues, and that is a big disadvantage. If you look at even TSN, TSN is the number four station in the market from time to time depending on what they're airing. They're ahead of WIC. They're ahead of the WIC stations in some markets, particularly Hamilton in the Ontario market. So they are not only a strong window, they are a window that starts out with probably $100 million of revenue before they open they doors for business January 1. Having had a close association with TSN over the past three years, having some insight as to how their business operates, I can say that that gives them a serious leg up in programming.\n\n237 And the other channels, the comedy networks, the discovery networks, the YTVs of the world are always increasing in subscriber revenues, because as digital satellite systems come on and 500,000 new subscribers became available to them they are getting stronger. We have to look at what they will be in three years.\n\n238 The Comedy Network, for example, has no restrictions on its licence. It can be Global. Why can't it own Seinfeld? It's got subscription revenues coming in the door day one knowing exactly what it can spend on programming. There's no reason why some of these specialty channels, because their so general, can't be out of conventional stations.\n\n239 And the second point I think is worth making is that while conventional revenues are still very strong today they are declining, period. Look at our financial statements. Look at CTV's financial statements. What CTV's got the benefit of is they have got ramping up of specialty channel revenues, so on an overall basis, to my knowledge, they don't break it down, but I can tell you in our shop Global Television's revenues are declining this year in a very weak conventional market which has been weakening over the last several years.\n\n240 Manitoba, Winnipeg, Regina, Saskatoon, Halifax, they make less money collectively than Prime Television. A two-year old specialty channel. They're being subsidized by Global. We have always taken the view that because we do want to be a national entity and we want to ascend to the national stage, as I said, we are willing to take those risks in those smaller markets, but those smaller markets don't make sense to own a conventional station in unless they have a partner, unless they have somebody helping support them who's got enough resources to bring the local investment, investment in local programming.\n\n241 So you do have to look at specialties as not what they are today but what they can be and you have to look at the -- just the graph, the line where conventional revenues are going and where specialty revenues are going. Conventional is going down; specialty is going up.\n\n242 And there may be today a point where specialty revenues as a whole are not as great as conventional revenues, but they are going up 30 per cent a year while conventional is going down 1 or 2 or 3 per cent a year. At some point the intersection will occur where specialty is a much stronger force than conventional.\n\n243 CHAIRPERSON OF THE COMMISSION: So you want to save the world. Conventional broadcasting is going down, but you will save it.\n\n244 MR. ASPER: The Asper Foundation is willing to step forward and save the world.\n\n245 CHAIRPERSON OF THE COMMISSION: I see.\n\n--- Laughter / Rires\n\n246 MR. ASPER: You know, as I said, we are not going to go extinct, but the conventional -- one of the things that's I think coincidental -- or not coincidental this year is that because CTV has so many specialty channels, and if you look at the number of promotions on NewsNet for Ally McBeal and E.R. and their hit programming and all of -- over all of their platforms, how they use that to promote each other, it's no coincidence that they caught us in the ratings this year. We think that had a -- and it's no coincidence that -- even on a much smaller basis.\n\n247 We looked at investing in this medical health Web site called medbroadcast.com. I think I was a minority with some multiple votes in the management group that caused that investment to occur. Nobody wanted to do it because they didn't want to go up against Web MD and Doctor Koop and some of the U.S. medical Web sites who are being promoted on CNN. Because there's a powerful force on Channel 15 in my home, which is a very often watched channel, that's promoting American Web sites, an American health Web site and we have to build Canadian companies that are willing to make those investments in Canadian content. The conventional platform will always be a very major part of our business, but it needs to be bolstered by other platforms.\n\n248 CHAIRPERSON OF THE COMMISSION: But, Mr. Asper, I understand what you're saying, but earlier on in our exchange you told me that you thought that the world or Canada could hold probably five to 10 players, so there's place for variation here. Let's take the lower of that scale, five. Don't you think that one of the important windows, not the only one, and I certainly recognize that bouquet of specialty channels is an interesting possibility of exploiting on the marketing side as well as exhibition side, but the owning of conventional broadcasting stations today and for the next -- let's be modest and just take our crystal ball of three years -- will be certainly important still, and when you kind of go for important markets like Vancouver and Toronto, with two, don't you think that the possibility of even having five major players in this country goes down to four and maybe three?\n\n249 MR. ASPER: No. I mean, when you think of major players, you have to think of companies like QuÃ©bÃ©cor. You have to think of companies like maybe even Powercorp, who has had some broadcasting assets and may come back into the market. Corus. There are probably seven to ten major companies in this market who, as I have said to you, I think should all be allowed to grow. I don't think it will ever come -- I think four will be too small a number.\n\n250 There may be alliances in between intertwining all these companies. I think, because nobody is going to be able to just buy up everything, it's much simpler to try to strike strategic alliances, which is what people are doing today as we speak. There are lots of conversations going on in the industry about: How can we work together? You're in this part of the country, we are in this part of the country; how can we work together? You own these kinds of assets, we own these kinds of assets; how can we do something together?\n\n251 So I don't think it will ever get to be that small a market.\n\n252 And the other thing is what's the purpose -- and one of the stated purposes is that there is supposed to be diversity. That's something often stated. It's right in the Act.\n\n253 There will always be diversity, even within corporate groups, because Prime Television operates quite autonomously from Global Television. It's got a managing director, it's got a sales force, it's got its own team, and they program the way they want to program. They share facilities, they share back office costs. But globaltv.com is another entity within Global, the Global communications group, that operates on its own. It went and hired 25 people. It's set a strategy of being a breaking news site, consistent with our plan on being a major player in news and information, and it does its own thing.\n\n254 So even within these large corporate groups, you can't look at even the Viacoms of the world or the -- you know, with MTV and Nickelodeon, they're located in different places and they operate on their own. So diversity, I think, will always be protected, even as corporate groups become larger.\n\n255 CHAIRPERSON OF THE COMMISSION: But in order for corporate groups to develop, wouldn't you say that owning conventional broadcasting undertakings is still an important part of the development and of growth and of significance, not being the only way of doing it, but being one of the keys in order to be significant?\n\n256 MR. ASPER: Yes. Yes.\n\n257 CHAIRPERSON OF THE COMMISSION: And the diversity that you are saying you're proposing through the programming that was kind of described earlier, certainly diversity can be there, but what about competition and healthy competition and, you know, the kind of emulation that occurs through competition?\n\n258 MR. SHEA: Madam Chairperson, if I may. Just a few things for the record.\n\n259 Specialty services are entitled to substitution. They have not been successful in taking full advantage of it. But I think as we look forward we see more and more specialty services are potentially going to be owned by distributors, the Shaw group, in the case of the CTV-Bell Canada merger, ultimately ExpressVu. You can see that with the prospect of more specialties being owned by distributors the likelihood of them getting full substitution, which is allowed in the regulations, would happen. I just thought I should raise that because they certainly are, from a regulatory perspective, allowed.\n\n260 Secondly, I'm going to ask Ken Goldstein to chime in too in a moment with respect to your last question.\n\n261 We are not seeking -- and I don't mean this to sound in any way tricky, because it is our fundamental belief with our strategy -- we are not seeking licences in Toronto and Vancouver to operate duplicate signals. We are attempting to get an additional licence in Hamilton and Victoria, two very distinct markets, and our programming strategies address real market issues, real market needs.\n\n262 Hamilton tried, for the last ten years, to become a Toronto station and it failed, If it failed under the leadership of WIC, in its day an incredibly run company with incredible resources -- and Mr. Reitmeyer behind me will explain that even under WIC they could not find a programming strategy or have the resources from a programming perspective to make CHCH successful, and in Victoria, they elected it to be purely a retransmitter of Vancouver programming.\n\n263 That's not our strategy. Our strategy is to have distinct services in two very distinct markets, Hamilton and Victoria, not Toronto-Vancouver. And it's a strategy that goes to the heart of what conventional broadcasters do: provide full-up local service and an entertainment menu that entertains and enlightens Canadians.\n\n264 Also, it's our strategy, as a conventional broadcaster, having two independents with your new Television Policy which we are just going to be entering our first year, gives us an opportunity to experiment far more in the likes and types of new Canadian content. We need outlets to experiment. We need outlets to try to see if we can't come up with better and more innovative programming that Canadians will watch. That again, as a conventional broadcaster gives us that opportunity to experiment a bit more, which we all need.\n\n265 But I would now like to call upon Ken Goldstein, because he, I think, with respect to one of your earlier questions and your last question about dominance and conventional versus specialty and where the universe is unfolding I think can be helpful in maybe showing you his crystal ball and where things are going.\n\n266 CHAIRPERSON OF THE COMMISSION: We may be showing him ours too.\n\n--- Laughter / Rires\n\n267 MR. GOLDSTEIN: Before I get to the crystal ball, let me deal with, I think, a very important point.\n\n268 When we are measuring questions of competition and the relative positions of the various groups in a marketplace, we look at a number of criteria. Obviously, one looks at what one might call shelf space. You have in front of you a little chart that's a bunch of stacked little TV sets -- and it took hours to do that, I have to tell you, to get those little names inside each television set -- but when I mention those relationships of the percentage share of the revenue in the television market, across specialties and across conventional, that relationship of the percentage shares basically is the answer to the question, because if you add a conventional service of a certain size and a certain character to the mix and you get a result that still puts CanWest in second place in market share, albeit closer to CTV, that's a different result than if you would have added a different kind of conventional service.\n\n269 So all conventional stations aren't the same, all specialty services aren't the same and we have to look at the total mix.\n\n270 In this particular case, I think we also have to view this against the backdrop of what might be the alternatives. I think that if one were to restrict the growth of CanWest in this case by not looking across the whole group of platforms, one would leave CTV -- a terrific company, well run -- in a dominant position.\n\n271 So the question here is not just kind of an absolute question but it's a question of will we go forward with two strong, competitive private sector players in this television business, each with the tools granted by the Commission to compete, and from that competition get more content and a better system, or will we arbitrarily divide it up and in fact not get the benefit from that competition?\n\n272 I don't think there is a question of dominance here at all.\n\n273 MR. ASPER: Madam Chair, just to sum up in one sentence. If CTV or CHUM would wish to trade their position with ours, with what we are proposing here. Done. I will sign those papers tomorrow.\n\n274 CHAIRPERSON OF THE COMMISSION: Well, they will be intervening and we will see what they say. I doubt -- but, you know, there are two ways of looking at your application.\n\n275 One is to say there's no other way, and you kind of came at it with that kind of argument saying, \"Unless we take it, it's the end of the world\", and you were talking about it like it's the only strategy and Global is like the player to do it. That's one way. That's one dimension.\n\n276 The other one is, \"It's the strategy of Global. This is what we intend to do. It will benefit the company, but it will benefit also the broadcasting system, and this is why we want to do it.\"\n\n277 You're kind of on the two dimensions in terms of the approach. Very clever. I recognize that.\n\n278 But let's stay on the only one to do it. You know, that the world has changed so much that it's not the same question, given that it's two years after the transactions did occur, but the world hasn't changed to the point that we should split CHEK and CHAN and we should even extend that kind of understanding to Hamilton. So somehow the world changes and it doesn't change.\n\n279 Please tell me why you feel that in Victoria, for example, it hasn't changed although it was a strong group, I think it was a strong group, but certainly the leadership, that was kind of in limbo for awhile during the -- you know, until we heard about the transactions, and the pleasure that we have to be together this morning certainly could be a reason why in four years there is still a station there. That is a plus.\n\n280 You know, there are reasons. It seems to me that there was not the possibility or full possibility to return the situation of Ontv or of CHEK because of the situations there.\n\n281 So tell me why you think the world, although it has changed there, it hasn't changed, that you are to be the saviour and unless you're there it will be -- you know, it's not clear to the reading of the material and the application despite everything you have said, Mr. Goldstein, and everything you have written as well.\n\n282 MR. ASPER: I think that, first and foremost, Hamilton CHCH needs a partner. It needs a partner who is already in the market, in the general market because for 20 years, not 10 years, under the ownership of Selkirk, MacLean Hunter and then finally WIC, this company has teetered between profitability and loss, lack of service to its community. Although it started with high and laudable objectives, which it achieved in its very early years, over the last 20 years it has not achieved those objectives. It has not been the contributor to the Canadian broadcast system that it could and should have been. It's tried every type of strategy, go Ontario, go local, but it has never had the resources and the market promotion power to be able to compete.\n\n283 And it goes back to what I said earlier about our experience in international markets with TV3 in New Zealand and to some extent Network 10 in Australia, which is when you are the number three out of three channels in a market it is virtually impossible, without spending obscene amounts of money, which no business person would do, to get to the next stage. And given the goals of the Canadian broadcast system -- which are what? -- they're diversity, they're about putting Canadian programming on our screens, and diverse Canadian programming on our screens, not repeating what others are doing, if Hamilton were bought by a smaller player who were (a) not required by the Broadcast Act to do the eight hours of priority programming or by the policy, or a player who, in other words, who was also not in the market with any other platforms, it would not be able to compete.\n\n284 If it were bought by a larger player, a behemoth who came in and was ready to throw lots of money at it, it still would not be able to compete. It's been owned by these behemoths that have multiple platforms like MacLean Hunter with its magazines. What it needs is a partner who is in the business, in the business of conventional television or the business of owning other platforms that are in that market that can promote Hamilton.\n\n285 Let me give you an example. They spent almost $2 million last year, over the last 18 months, on a promotion campaign. It did nothing for them. They didn't move in the ratings one little bit and they have programming, U.S. programming, that is top 10 in the U.S., it's among the best programming in the U.S., and it's not even on the map in the Canadian rating system. Why is that? It's a non-factor in the minds of the Hamilton market, other than the local news it does do today, and it's a non-factor in the Ontario market.\n\n286 So even though it is a channel on the dial, it needs a partner who can bring the resources to it that can put a Canadian choice, bring a Canadian choice -- it's on the dials in the Hamilton and the rest of Ontario market -- new programming, diverse programming that they're not seeing right now.\n\n287 CHAIRPERSON OF THE COMMISSION: But you're saying in your presentation Global is, you know, a strong player in the Canadian system, has had strong leadership. You're good business people. Why would it work with you? You know, what will be the ingredients that will make it work and that you would be the only one to make it work, because that's what I hear as well?\n\n288 MR. SHEA: Madam Chair, I think, as you have witnessed in the cable industry, there are now two or three very strong players as a consequence of consolidation. It was intentional I think in two ways, intentional by the entrepreneurs to become bigger, because they needed to, and I believe it was intentional from the regulators' perspective to ensure that we did have, structurally, strong players in order to compete with impending and new technologies.\n\n289 Our argument is quite similar, that over the course of the next couple of years, as the Commission hears a number of future mergers and certain structural changes, that where we have to end up is that there are two or three very strong,national, vital players. Opportunities in our regulated system come two ways, by the luck of licensing -- and we haven't had a lot of luck in terms of specialty -- or they come through acquisition -- and we have had much more luck I guess in acquisition. But structurally, that's the only way we can grow, and, structurally, the only opportunities that are currently in front of us, CanWest, is the full acquisition of WIC, because structurally it will make us stronger. And we believe that it is in the regulators' interest and in the industry's interest to ensure that there are two or three very strong players.\n\n290 Lastly, I would say the reason why we are requesting which in effect would be an exception to a policy, and that is common ownership of stations in a market -- although you have heard that we are arguing they're not necessarily the same market, but we will leave that aside for the moment -- is because we believe that under the circumstances this is the best application in front of you at the moment. We have gone, we believe, a very long way in the types and the nature, and more importantly, the total benefits which exceed your minimum policy.\n\n291 We have advanced a certain number of safeguards, because we respect the fact that this policy, while we would argue might be somewhat outdated, but that's the subject for another hearing -- but we have tried to come at this in a constructive way by putting the package of elements in front of you that would seek to ensure that this exception is allowed.\n\n292 But I will close by saying it's currently the only opportunity that we see in front of us, and what we do see around us is a world consolidating where CanWest is no longer going to be the largest entity in the country, from a broadcasting perspective.\n\n293 CHAIRPERSON OF THE COMMISSION: I understand what you are saying as kind of building upon what Mr. Asper had said, that although there are specificities in that market there is still the strategy of Global and the necessity you have recognized on growing and being a stronger player in Canada. What is not clear is what will it bring and how will you do it? You know, why will it work? What will be the kind of big that will be useful for your strategy and why that kind of big will help you be the kind of player in Ontario and in B.C.?\n\n294 If you don't like the reference of the extended market of Toronto and Vancouver, rightly so. I understand given your application. But, you know, still, you will have a strong presence in those two provinces. How will it work so that it's really a leverage? I guess that always comes back to that notion. You know, in your application and in your brief you talk about leverage, you did talk about leverage today. It's not clear how you will use that leverage. You will bring diversity by the kind of programming, that's one thing, but what kind of leverage does it give you? Is it the advertising force in the markets?\n\n295 MR. ASPER: Well, there are a few areas.\n\n296 Number one, it does give us programming leverage in the acquisition of foreign programming. When I say \"leverage\", I mean it allows us to at least be on an equal footing with our major competitor. The increases in foreign programming prices I think are well known to the Commission and they have --\n\n297 CHAIRPERSON OF THE COMMISSION: We don't buy American. We buy Canadian.\n\n298 MR. ASPER: Well, they're certainly publicized in our financial statements.\n\n299 This has been going on for many years, and the greatest thing that can happen to the Canadian broadcasting system, as well as its participants, be it CTV or CHUM or Craig or Global, is that we are spending less money by virtue of the supply-demand dynamics in the United States and having more money to put toward Canadian programming in Canada.\n\n300 By simple mathematics, when there go down to be a lesser number of buyers for foreign programming, that's good for Canada by definition, because the prices will not increase at least as much as they have in the past. But the leverage, again, it allows us is the promotional leverage. The ability to take a program that we have bought the rights for, whether it's on Hamilton or on Global, and promote it and create better audiences for that programming.\n\n301 I mean, one of the things we pride ourselves upon over the past few years is that we have spent a lot of money on promotion of Canadian programming and as a result we have typically been -- had four out of the five top Canadian programs. In fact, one of our Canadian programs \"Bob and Margaret\", frequently made it into the top 15 of all programs. That's quite an accomplishment, and that's because we put significant promotion resources behind it. But in going forward, in the future, as our competitors have more and more platforms, we need to have more and more platforms to promote that programming.\n\n302 Kevin, do you want to add to that?\n\n303 MR. SHEA: One additional thought, Madam Chairperson, is that to some degree the marketplace did decide, because it has brought us here today. In other words, if there were other interested players in the WIC assets, they could have outbid Shaw and ourselves if they were really interested in advancing their own corporate plans and notions, and that hasn't happened. It is the consequence, it is the by-product of how we have ended up here.\n\n304 But I do want to echo what Leonard said, and that is our ability to cross-promote our Canadian and foreign schedules. I think it goes to the heart of that, in many respects, some of the benefits that we have put forward in the area of promotion of content is absolutely fundamental to our future. We are limited at the moment by the nature and the type of channels that we have to do that. It's essentially Global and Prime. So the more outlets in key markets that we have to provide very costly cross-promotion of content is useful to our overall strategy and structure.\n\n305 CHAIRPERSON OF THE COMMISSION: What about the buying -- the acquisition itself, buying a package and using different windows; is that part of your strategy as well?\n\n306 MR. SHEA: Madam Chair, yes it is. We have mentioned in both our safeguards and our application that we would limit the utilization of content to 10 per cent. These channels have to be different in order to be successful. But take the recent example of our documentary that we ran on Global last week. We would want to take advantage of promotion, a very high end programming, Canadian programming, to have a rebroadcast within a week or two for those people who didn't get a chance to see it, but it would be far more event driven.\n\n307 And if we were ever to do a -- ever to use the example that I have just used with respect to a Canadian documentary, I would want to make it very clear that that wouldn't count as part of our eight hours that week, it would be incremental to the eight hours, because we do not plan to duplicate our Canadian programming between stations in either Hamilton or Victoria.\n\n308 CHAIRPERSON OF THE COMMISSION: So the 10 per cent would be for foreign?\n\n309 MR. SHEA: The 10 per cent, in a large part --\n\n310 CHAIRPERSON OF THE COMMISSION: The overlap.\n\n311 MR. SHEA: -- is going to be for Canadian programming, principally daypart, but to take advantage of the promotion of higher end Canadian specials within a week or two of their original broadcast on either station.\n\n312 CHAIRPERSON OF THE COMMISSION: But were you saying that it would be over and above the eight hours, then --\n\n313 MR. SHEA: If we were to use --\n\n314 CHAIRPERSON OF THE COMMISSION: -- when it would be overlapping?\n\n315 MR. SHEA: That's correct. If we were to take a documentary, which is currently our only strategy, and run it on either station that week, it would not count as part of the eight hours on that station. It would be incremental to it.\n\n316 CHAIRPERSON OF THE COMMISSION: But you answered to one dimension of my question. What about the acquisition of foreign programming where you can buy some packages and use some of the material on one window and other material on the other window. Is that part of, you know, what you're contemplating doing?\n\n317 MR. SHEA: From an economic efficiency perspective of joint buying, absolutely, yes. However, it is absolutely essential that these stations be different to attract advertisers. If they're purely a replay of each other, we are not adding any diversity to the market from a consumer or advertising perspective. So programming would be bought jointly but scheduled differently.\n\n318 MR. ASPER: I think just to clarify, it's no different than CFMT today in the Toronto marketplace, which is that they say to us, \"We would like to get these programs so, Global, when you're buying for yourself buy for us too.\" That works to some extent no different than, you know, the program supply agreement we had with WIC, the WIC Alberta stations. We bought for them, for Alberta. They took some of the Global schedule. Not all of it, but they took some of it. And so really we become the agent for some of these stations, which would include CHCH in this and CHEK in this situation.\n\n319 So it's a way to ensure that instead of five or six companies all seeking to buy various territorial rights going down to Los Angeles and buying a bunch of programming and competing with each other, it boils it down to CTV and its group, CHUM and its group, and CanWest and its group. That makes for a more efficient buying market. That's really where there is a significant benefit to CanWest just as there has been to CTV and others buying -- like CHUM buying for Citytv and Space, things like that.\n\n320 CHAIRPERSON OF THE COMMISSION: As a viewer, that means that I will have a signal that will be what I'm used to with Global. I will have Prime and I will have, if I am in Hamilton, another signal, which will be Hamilton. Totally different --\n\n321 MR. ASPER: Yes.\n\n322 CHAIRPERSON OF THE COMMISSION: -- with only 10 per cent overlapping between them.\n\n323 MR. ASPER: Yes. There's no point for us to have a repeat of Global. That would be the worst strategy we could possibly deploy.\n\n324 CHAIRPERSON OF THE COMMISSION: Tell me, talking about local, there's concern about -- you seem very devoted to serving Hamilton today and certainly we can believe that, but certainly you will recognize that there is concern as well that slowly but surely you will be contemplating Toron"
