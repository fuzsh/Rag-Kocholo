        "text": "REGISTER AS AN EMPLOYEE OF AN EXISTING PEPPM VENDOR\n\nTo learn of bidding opportunities and to enjoy access to exclusive vendor content, suppliers must register with PEPPM. You can use the form on the left if you are the employee of an existing, registered business and want to affiliate with your company’s PEPPM account. If your company is new to PEPPM, click the button on the right to begin an application for access as a new member. All registrants will be vetted. You will be notified when your application has been approved — usually within one business day. Mere registration does not qualify vendors to be a PEPPM supplier. For more information about becoming a PEPPM Vendor, please review the How to Become a PEPPM Vendor webpage. Thank you for your interest in PEPPM."
