        "text": "RESEARCH EFFORTS: Intel 2 Gbps pure silicon based optical modulator smashes previous optical switching record of 20 Mbps held by Graham Reed, University of Surrey, UK. OXC \"fastest\" optical cross connects promise to be the fastest switching technology between high speed fibers, but it is not yet clear how well they integrate into IP over optical networks. MPLS multiprotocol label switching is an effort to traffic engineer high volume flows and may ease the integration of ATM, VCs and IP. It may be more efficient to utilize load sensitive IP streams if they could be implemented without instabilities for example by optimising OSPF weights or e.g. using an ensemble Riccati state controller. Avici fast IP-in-silicon fast IP router. BBN Labs 50 Gbps research effort based on the Butterfly switching matrix, ARPA funded, Craig Partridge involved, forwards 6 to 42 million packets per second depending on configuration. This was one of the earliest multigigabit routers built. British Telecom 100 Gbps research effort, pure optical routing, read header in optical IC and marked packets are optically switched into another fiber, 100 Gbps expected for the first light box. Broadcom 9 Gbps world's first single chip switch with routing (L3) and quality of service. The Strataswitch BCM5600 (CMOS) can filter up to 6.6 Mpps and supports 24 10/100 interfaces and two 100/1000 interfaces which can all run at wire speed. The chip can run data, voice and video simultaneously. Caspian Networks very fast next generation scalability, control and management of ISP's IP optical networks, Lawrence Roberts involved. Chiaro Networks very fast developped optical switching, eliminating the capacity bottleneck (due to electronics using slow large electrons instead of light and fast photons) at the carrier's end of the fibers. Cisco 7600 OSR 256 Gbps The 7600 Optical Services Router (OSR) has a parallel eXpress forwarding engine, non ASIC based, which can handle up to 30 million packets per seconds. A variety of configurations with gigabit ethernet and ATM interfaces etc are available. Introduced in February 2001 and put on hold in April 2001. i-data/Exbit 32 Gbps The Heathrow 16-port-switch-on-a-chip can handle 10/100/1000 speeds on each port, 24 million packets per second and has an internal engine up to 32 Gbps. Lucent gigabits The Packet Star terabit switch is an IP-in-silicon router using PGAs without the traditional CPU and software lookups on each incoming packet. It using a clever packet queuing scheme and includes QoS (ATM). Moby Router 350 Gbps research effort based on silicon, parallel Pluris architectures, Vadim Antonov is founder of Pluris, 2 Tbps targeted. IP routing in silicon, not the traditional CPU and software approach. Pluris core technology works by splitting aggregated streams into parallel flows, like 'colored liquids'. Expected to have advantages over simple IP best efforts routing on the one side and complicated virtual circuit management on the other. (When circuits aren't over- loaded traffic engineering has zero benefits. The TE apostles promise more \"miracles\" for unfilled pipes.) Nexabit/Lucent acq. gigabits developping the capability to route up to 10 billion bits per second real world on each interface. Procket fast the next generation router, faster than the GSR 12000 or M160, using MPLS. Rapid City Communic. 7 Mpps startup in Mountain View, Gigabit ethernet routing switches can route 7 million packets per second, uses ASICs, expected to ship end of 1997, was purchased by Bay Networks, now Nortel Networks. Rumor by Bill Manning 600 Mbps 'thingie with PCI interface', box needed to plug this into, to get a reasonable ExchangeNG(tm) box, hopefully with multiple OC-3c interfaces. Update 2001: Or simply four gigabit PCI cards, although it's nontrivial to get this box to work with present day hardware, due to memory bandwidth constraints, which is only 4.2 Gbps in a PC and requires 2 Gbps for each PCI card, in and out; packet header lookup and route processing etc.; but it could become a future alternative to custom hardware solutions; before $200 four port gigabit ASIC boxes take over. SNRC SupraNodes 100 Tb/s SupraNodes scalable to 100 Tb/s and beyond are investigated using scalable architectures and emerging optical & electrical technologies at the SNRC (Stanford Network Research Center) here in town.

Cisco CRS-1 92 Tbps The Carrier Routing System 1 uses up to 40 Gbps fiber ports, up to 1.2 Gbps per box. 72 boxes can be connected resulting in an aggregate bandwidth of 92 Tbps. Cisco GSR up to 80 Gbps The Gigabit Switch Router is a crosspoint switch and router available with 4, 8 and 12 slots. Supports IP over SONET as well as ATM. Connects directly into fiber infrastructure with OC-3 or OC-12 speeds, lateron OC-48. During development it was known as the BFR (Big Fast Router). GSR 12012 15-60 Gbps 12 slots, interface cards with 4 x OC-3 GSR 12008 10-40 Gbps 8 slots or 1 x OC-12 GSR 12004 5 Gbps 4 slots Probably the best architecture: IP over SONET on long distance links, Gigabit ethernet on the LAN and in between ATM may not be all that bad for citywide connections. Can do 2.5 billion bits per seconds full duplex real world traffic on each interface. Cisco 7500 series 160 Mbps popular at MAEs, FIXs and backbones, >1 Mpps dual MIPS processors, supports many protocols and options suitable for NSPs, about 160 Mbps real world performance (in Cisco HSSI/FDDI testbed, possibly limited by slow test equipment); they are widely used on present day backbones and can barely handle present day traffic; can do about 300,000 packets per second; and up to 1 Mpps with recent upgrades; performance is negatively impacted by route updating; route damping can alleviate it by reducing the load on the processors. SSH available in 12.xT IOS. Cisco 7200 series > 16 Mpbs popular with ISPs, 8 Mbps on one, maybe two, ports of a 4T card. Cisco 4700 series > 10 Mbps recommended for full BGP4 routing with about 34,000 routes and using 32 MB RAM; 100 MHz 64bit IDT Orion RISC processor; can do fewer than 47000 pps; 8 Mbps on one, maybe two, ports of a 4T card but not on a 2T card. [General note: Advanced 64 bit operating systems (SGI IRIX, Digital Unix, HP-Convex) have a usable memory limit of roughly 16 GB ensuring that memory size is not restricting router table growth. Also note that adressable memory can be much larger (SGI IRIX 1 TB) but can't be used due to memory bandwidth restrictions; sometimes also called memory latency; a path requires about 110 bytes and a BGP-4 route about 370 bytes of memory. Generally the proccessing power limits the number of routes since the required power increases much faster than the number of additional routes.] Cisco 3620/3640 16 Mbps router with 2 or 4 expansion slots; 8 Mbps on one port of a 4T card.

IPSILON invented IP switching, a method to efficiently put TCP/IP over any network fabric, routing calculation on AMD/Intel, can be used e.g. over ATM, alliance with DEC, developped IGRP, competitor to Cisco, but seems to have flamed out recently and was purchased by Nokia. Livingston Enterprises 3 Mbps IRX routers have up to 2 T1/E1 sync ports and 2 low speed 56/64k sync ports. RIPv1, OSPF and recently BGP-4 became available. Memory can be upgraded beyond 16 MB if desired (but all four must be equal). Livingston remote access servers are popular with ISPs, for modem and ISDN aggregation. National 2.5 Gbps National introduces industry's first LVDS-compliant 4X4 Crosspoint Switch: DS90CP04. : The 2.5 Gbps speed allows the new device to be used in a broad variety of applications from OC12 (622 Mbps) to OC48 rates (STM-16) July 2002 NortelNetworks Accelar 15 Gbps Layer 3 switch, routing, filtering, policy in silicon, Model 1200 has been shipping for 12-18 mths, with 6 I/O slots, dual-gig blades, (optionally linksafe) SX or LX.
