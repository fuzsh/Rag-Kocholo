        "text": "In “Vergangenheit,” the sixth episode of The Crown’s second season—named for the German word for “past”—Queen Elizabeth finds herself face to face with the person responsible for imprisoning her in “that miserable mausoleum,” Buckingham Palace: her uncle, the Duke of Windsor, whose 1936 abdication put her in direct line to the throne.\n\nThe Duke of Windsor, played impeccably by Alex Jennings, has grown bored with his post-crown life: “I never thought I’d find myself saying it, but a life of pleasure really has its limits,” the former King Edward VIII complains to his wife, Wallis Simpson, after trying on pirate costumes for another dreaded masquerade ball. Determined to find a life more meaningful than the pug-ensconced, poker-playing perma-holiday he has been living out in France, the Duke of Windsor receives permission from his niece to return to London, where he tries to shake up some sort of ambassadorship. Alas, his plan is thwarted when Queen Elizabeth discovers incriminating documents about the Duke of Windsor’s reported relations with Nazi Germany. But what is the real story of the Duke of Windsor’s visit with Adolf Hitler, and his alleged Nazi sympathies?\n\nAs depicted on The Crown, Nazi officials are said to have concocted a 1940 plan to kidnap the Duke of Windsor and re-install him as a puppet leader after invading Britain. The strategy was formed three years after the Duke and Duchess of Windsor visited Nazi Germany as guests of Adolf Hitler at Berchtesgaden—a visit which proved to be embarrassing to Edward’s brother King George VI and, according to The New York Times, “confirm[ed] Hitler’s view that the Duke of Windsor was an advocate of the Nazi cause and could be of future use.”\n\nThe kidnapping strategy, according to The Guardian, was uncovered when the U.K. intercepted telegrams from Germany. While the plot obviously was not successful, Winston Churchill worked frantically to bury evidence of the telegrams after discovering that a copy of the documents had been sent to the U.S. State Department. Churchill pleaded with U.S. President Eisenhower to suppress the telegrams, claiming that the information they contained was “unreliable” and suggested that the duke “was in close touch with German agents and was listening to suggestions that were disloyal.”\n\nAccording to since-released state documents, Eisenhower agreed with Churchill, determining that the telegrams were “obviously concocted with some idea of promoting German propaganda and weakening western resistance.” Among the telegrams’ claims was the idea that the duke and duchess were told about Nazi Germany’s plot to re-install the duke as king. “The Duchess in particular became very thoughtful,” one telegram stated. Another telegram seconded the suggestion that the Duchess of Windsor was particularly interested in the prospect of becoming queen, stating, “Germans expect assistance from the Duke and Duchess of Windsor, the latter desiring at any price to become queen.”\n\nThe telegrams also contained statements allegedly made by the Duke of Windsor, one stating that the former king was “convinced that had he remained on throne war would have been avoided” and “a firm supporter of a peaceful compromise with Germany.” Another telegram stated that the “Duke believes with certainty that continued heavy bombing will make England ready for peace.” (When the telegrams came to light in 1957, the Duke of Windsor declared their contents to be “complete fabrications.”)\n\nChurchill further told Eisenhower that the Duke of Windsor had been appointed governor of the Bahamas in 1940, in order “to get him away from Europe beyond the reach of the enemy.” Before the 1940 relocation, according to The New York Times, the Duke and Duchess of Windsor had “moved to neutral Spain and Portugal, where they were often seen in the company of German agents. The duke lived in the home of a banker in Lisbon with close German Embassy contacts.”\n\nIn Operation Willi: The Nazi Plot to Kidnap the Duke of Windsor, author Michael Bloch claims that the Germans attempted to keep the Windsors from moving to the Bahamas. The Windsors did not seem to appreciate the assignment either. The Duke of Windsor is said to have called the Bahamas “a third-class British colony.” According to released wartime documents in Britain, as reported by The New York Times, the Duke of Windsor “asked for a large sum of money to refurbish his residence. It was refused with a reminder that the amount would have been enough to buy a fighter aircraft.”\n\nThe Duke and Duchess of Windsor, accustomed to the finer things in life, were also prohibited from traveling aboard a yacht “belonging to a Swedish magnate, Axel Wenner-Gren, whom American intelligence considered to be a close friend of Hermann Goering, Hitler’s second in command.” When the Duke and Duchess of Windsor visited Palm Beach, Florida, in April 1941, they were under close surveillance by the F.B.I., which had reason to believe that the couple was being used by the Nazis to “obtain secrets which could wreck the allies’ war effort.”\n\nIn state papers, Churchill claimed that the Duke of Windsor was not aware of the telegrams—though Elizabeth’s father, King George VI, was, and he too hoped that they would be suppressed.\n\nWhen the telegrams finally came to light in 1957, the Duke of Windsor denounced their contents as “complete fabrications . . . and gross distortions of truth.”\n\nThe British government, meanwhile, supported the Duke of Windsor, stating that “he never wavered in his loyalty to the British cause.”\n\nQueen Elizabeth and Prince Philip’s Seven-Decade Marriage, in Photos\n\n1 / 24"
