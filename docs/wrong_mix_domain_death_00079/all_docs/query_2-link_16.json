        "text": "What does the suicide-by-cyanide of Nazi Germany’s Vice Chancellor and Field Marshal Hermann Goering have to do with major league baseball and American football?\n\nOddly enough, plenty.\n\nThis Thursday makes it a full 70 years since Goering was captured by the Allies, specifically the U.S. 36th Infantry, on May 6, 1945.\n\nObese, drug-addicted and delusional, Goering was under the impression that U.S. Gen. Dwight Eisenhower would seek Goering’s advice for German-U.S. reconciliation and assign him to a high-ranking position in post-war Germany.\n\nThe only post-war position the Allies had in mind for him, however, was incarceration as a Nuremberg war crimes defendant, which became preface for his scheduled hanging, Oct. 16, 1946.\n\nEnter, Protestant U.S. Army Chaplain, Capt. Henry Gerecke, and Catholic Army Chaplain, Capt. R.J. Sixtus O’Connor — both fluent in German.\n\nGerecke, an ordained minister in his early 50s when he left his St. Louis congregation to fill a growing need for military chaplains, was tasked with ministering to the Protestant war crimes defendants.\n\nO’Connor, a priest in his mid-30s, was to serve the Catholic defendants. All were housed in cells at the Nuremburg prison/court/castle complex.\n\nThe Geneva Convention mandated that all prisoners of war have steady access to ministers of their religion. Nuremberg, in a sustaining irony, was the city in which Adolf Hitler declared laws that were designed to eradicate — mostly by murder — all Jews from the European continent.\n\nPastor Gerecke wouldn’t take “no” from Goering, the two, the Lutheran came to shamefully admit, having developed mutual and daily good regard. But despite Gerecke’s urgings for Goering to follow the surrender of his body with the surrender of his soul, Goering, still haughty and imperious within his cell, refused.\n\nNo, the former Protestant protested, he would go to the gallows as his own God in the early morning of Oct 16, with 10 other Nazi monsters of mass murder.\n\nIt was in those nighttime hours of Oct. 15 when Pastor Gerecke and Father O’Connor were most active in their spiritual mission to serve the condemned. They patrolled Death Row, Father O’Connor providing Last Rites to those so inclined.\n\nThe two U.S. Army chaplains couldn’t have been more attendant to the accused in their final hours, except for one thing that was going on in the daylight:\n\nThe 1946 World Series.\n\nOn Oct. 15, Game 7 between the Red Sox and Cardinals was played in St. Louis. Gerecke, from St. Louis, and O’Connor, from Upstate New York, had a $10 bet on the Series. And with the Cards up, 3-1 after seven innings, the chaplains made frequent trips to the radio room for updates.\n\nFrom here, we enter the realm of maybe bordering on probably.\n\nThough Gerecke maintained a steady vigil with Goering, the Nazi still was able to find the solitude to “cheat the hangman” by ingesting a hidden cyanide capsule — still thought to have been slipped to him by a star-struck U.S. Army prison guard — that would kill him in minutes.\n\nIt was in those minutes, as told by author Tim Townsend in his 2013 book, “Nuremberg: An Army Chaplain and the Trial of the Nazis” (Harper-Collins), that Gerecke and O’Connor were pulled away and kept away from the condemned by fresh, exciting news: The Red Sox had tied the game in the eighth!\n\nSo, then, it is possible to pinpoint the time and explain the opportunity for Goering’s suicide: It happened moments after — and perhaps because of — Dom DiMaggio’s two-run double off Harry Brecheen.\n\nAnd between the time of Goering’s suicide and the first hanging — Foreign Minister Joachim von Ribbentrop went first, at 1:11 a.m. within what otherwise was used as a gymnasium — the Cardinals won the World Series.\n\nThere’s more. The Allies wanted the bodies of all 11 Nazis cremated, and at some secret site, so as not to provide Nazi shrines or pilgrimage sites.\n\nSo all 11 bodies were placed in coffins then driven off in trucks. And to each coffin was attached a phony name, just in case.\n\nThe casket that held Goering’s body was identified as holding the remains of George Munger. George Munger? Why George Munger?\n\nGeorge Munger, at the time, was the well-known head football coach at the University of Pennsylvania. Some sports-minded U.S. officer or G.I. — perhaps from Philadelphia — chose that for Goering.\n\nAnd it all began with the capture of Herman Goering on May 6, 1945, 70 years ago this Wednesday.\n\nIf info is useless and bloated, trim the stat\n\nWe all would see more clearly — we would see what’s in front of us, what we otherwise can’t miss — if TV eliminated about 80 percent of its stats and many of its experts.\n\nRate the NFL draft? How? Who was the expert who in 2000 declared that with the their sixth-round, 199th-overall pick the Patriots just selected one of the greatest quarterbacks in history, Tom Brady, from ground-game-driven Michigan?\n\nAnd who, on the 2006 night the Titans selected Texas QB Vince Young as the third overall pick, expertly declared Young would be just a flash on the grid iron, soon the be a backup washout.\n\nWith the first pick in the 1992 supplemental draft, the Giants chose Duke QB Dave Brown. “Did you see his stats! Holy moley! The guy threw for 10 million yards! Giants win the next 10 Super Bowls!”\n\nBrown was a very good college QB whose gaudy stats were in large part a matter of circumstance.\n\nAt Duke, he quarterbacked teams that frequently not only trailed, but trailed early and large. He regularly was forced to throw 40-plus times per games, often against defenses that allowed as many 5- to 15-yard throws as he could complete.\n\nSo stats not only have a way of blurring reality, but destroying it, as well.\n\nConsider NBC’s preoccupation with “hits” totals throughout these Stanley Cup playoffs. Hits, however, mostly tell no greater story and carry no greater significance than checks delivered as a matter of opportunity.\n\nIf “hits” are a good thing, as per NBC’s count, the hit that draws a penalty that leads to the power play that leads to the winning/losing goal is important — but not as a good thing.\n\nThe NBA playoffs have provided us with multiple networks trying to “break down” games by breaking out points-off-whatever stats. But every possession in every game carries the same intent: to score. And there are no bonus points awarded for points off steals, turnovers, rebounds, etc.\n\nTo that end, reader Mitch Madden, Pompano Beach, Fla., writes that basketball telecasts are missing one significant stat: “Points scored after players slam-dunk the ball then showboat for the camera rather than get back on defense.”"
