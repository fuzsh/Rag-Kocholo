        "text": "(1893–1946). A leader of the Nazi Party, Hermann Göring became one of the primary architects of the Nazi police state in Germany during World War II. He was tried and condemned to death as a war criminal by the International Military Tribunal at Nuremberg, Germany, in 1946; before the sentence was carried out, however, he committed suicide.\n\nGöring (also spelled Goering) was born on January 12, 1893, in Rosenheim, Germany, to the German consul general in Haiti. He was brought up near Nuremberg, in the small castle of Veldenstein. The castle’s owner was a Jew who was until 1913 the lover of Göring’s mother and the godfather of her children. Trained for an army career, Göring received his commission in 1912 and served with distinction during World War I, where he joined the fledgling German air force. In 1918 he became commander of the celebrated squadron in which the great German aviator Manfred, Baron von Richthofen, had served. After World War I ended, Göring spent time as a commercial pilot in Denmark and Sweden.\n\nGöring met Adolf Hitler in 1921 and joined the small Nazi Party late in 1922. As a former officer, Göring was given command of Hitler’s Storm Troopers (the SA), a paramilitary organization whose methods included violent intimidation. Göring took part in the abortive Beer Hall (Munich) Putsch of November 1923, in which Hitler tried to seize power prematurely. During the putsch, Göring was badly wounded in the groin. His arrest was ordered, but he escaped into Austria. Given morphine to deaden the pain from his wounds, he became so severely addicted that he had to undergo treatment in 1925–26 at a mental hospital in Sweden.\n\nIn 1927 Göring returned to Germany and was taken back into the party leadership. He was elected to the Reichstag in 1928, becoming the president in 1932. As president of the Reichstag he helped bring Hitler to power as chancellor. During the rest of the decade, Göring held a series of other offices that he used to establish such elements of the Nazi state as the Gestapo (secret police) and the concentration camps for the “corrective treatment” of difficult opponents. He also became the commissioner for aviation and the head of the newly developed German air force, the Luftwaffe. In 1934 Göring ceded his position as security chief to Heinrich Himmler, thus ridding himself of responsibility for the Gestapo and the concentration camps.\n\nIt was Göring’s Luftwaffe that helped conduct the blitzkrieg that smashed Polish resistance and weakened country after country as Hitler’s campaigns progressed. But Göring was not capable of influencing Hitler’s preference for the production of bombers rather than fighter planes. As a result, the Luftwaffe’s capacity for defense declined as Hitler’s battlefronts extended from northern Europe to the Mediterranean and North Africa, and Göring lost face when the Luftwaffe failed to win the Battle of Britain or to prevent the Allied bombing of Germany. On the plea of ill health, Göring retired—as much as Hitler would let him—to a luxurious private life. He also underwent recurrent treatment for drug addiction.\n\nHitler was blind to Göring’s faults and maintained a close association with him. In 1939 Hitler declared him his successor and in 1940 gave him the special rank of Marshal of the Empire. The other Nazi leaders both resented Göring’s favored position and despised his self-indulgence. Hitler, however, did not displace him until the last days of the war, when, in accordance with the decrees of 1939, Göring attempted to assume the Führer’s powers, believing him to be encircled and helpless in Berlin. After Hitler’s suicide, Göring surrendered himself to the Americans.\n\nCured finally of his drug addiction during his period of captivity awaiting trial as a war criminal, Göring defended himself ably before the International Military Tribunal. He denied any complicity in the more hideous activities of the regime, which he claimed to be the secret work of Himmler. After Göring was sentenced to death, he asked to be shot instead of hanged. His request was denied, and on October 15, 1946, the night his execution was ordered, he took poison and died in his cell at Nuremberg."
