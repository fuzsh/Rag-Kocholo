On November 12, 1938, two days after “Kristallnacht” Field Marshall Hermann Göring, second in command to Hitler, calls a meeting of the Nazi elite. For two hours as they drink coffee and eat pastries, they vie for power in the Third Reich. Göring, the Minister of Propaganda Dr. Josef Paul Goebbels, SS Grupenfuhrer Reinhard Heydrich, Foreign Minister Ernst Woermann, Minister of Economics Walther Funk and Austrian Minister of Economics Hans Fishboeck argue with increasing vehemence on how to remove Jews from all aspects of German life and leave them destitute. As the meeting progresses, a battle of personalities and power breaks out between Göring, Goebbels and Heydrich.\n\nLos Angeles Times Review\n\nBy David C. Nichols\n\nSpecial to The Times\n\nMay 12, 2006\n\nHistory forgotten is history repeated, and \"All Steps Necessary,\" Michael Halperin's cautionary tale about the post-Kristallnacht doings at Field Marshal Hermann Goering's house in 1938, leaves no trenchant chill untilled. This resolute Inkwell Theater production at 2100 Square Feet depicts a top-echelon Third Reich meeting in a Berlin shattered by the national wave of pogroms led by Nazi storm troopers three days earlier.\n\nBased on the notes taken by Goering's secretary (Addie Daddio), \"All Steps Necessary\" follows the field marshal (Richard V. Licata) as he orchestrates the crisis to consolidate his second-to-Hitler position and further disenfranchise Jews. Goering's adversaries, Dr. Josef Goebbels (Michael Oberlander) and Gen. Reinhard Heydrich (Larry Reinhardt-Meyer), keep their genocidal agendas vested, barely.\n\nDirector Jim Ortlieb and his fervid crew treat this pivotal juncture with utmost gravity, pointing up current pertinence. Such phrases as \"new world order\" and gestures like the gift of a toy train car from Geoffrey Wade's Dr. Hans Fishboeck send shudders through the audience, and the authentic documents that wallpaper Nathan Matheny's set bespeak the highest intentions.\n\nConvincingly costumed by Valerie Laven-Cooper, the players eschew dialects and visually suggest their real-life counterparts. Tom Carroll's Dr. Ernst Woermann, Warren Davis' Edouard Hilgard and Ben Shields' Walther Funk complete a representative portrait.\n\n“All Steps Necessary,\" 2100 Square Feet Theater, 5615 San Vicente Blvd., L.A. 8 p.m. Fridays and Saturdays, 2 p.m. Sundays; June 4, 7 p.m.. Ends June 4. $20. (866) 811-4111 or www.theatermania.com. Running time: 1 hour, 30 minutes.\n\nFREEDOM, TEXAS by Michael Halperin\n\nRecommendations: 1\n\n·\n\nCast:\n\n7\n\n·\n\nGenre: comedy\n\nGenre: comedy\n\n1953.

Eighteen year-old Jewish college dropout Steve Weisbart travels from Los Angeles to Freedom, Texas for an unlikely job as a disk jockey/announcer with a small, run down, marginally profitable 1000 watt daytime radio station in the Panhandle that specializes in broadcasting to passing semis on their way to deliver cattle in Oklahoma.

His brash speeches and writing raise the fearful specter in his community of the possibility of a new Inquisition. Spinoza’s angry and jealous sister, Rebekah, eager to inherit their father’s business, uses her brother’s passion for social justice and charges him with heresy. The leaders of the community, anxious to avoid the stigma of disloyalty to the state, latch on to her accusation as a tool for ridding themselves of the young troublemaker. Spinoza falls in love with Clara van den Ende, an outspoken, liberated woman who attempts to turn him away from his dogged determination. Failing that, she abandons him to the wrath of his people who wage a devastating battle against Spinoza. His teacher, Saul Levi Morteira, begs him to recant. When the young man refuses, Morteira becomes his chief inquisitor at a trial that will eventually affect society, politics, religion and science.\n\nDANCING WITH WILLIAM BLAKE by Michael Halperin\n\nCast:\n\n6\n\n·\n\nGenre: drama\n\nGenre: drama\n\nAfter fifty years of marriage, the death of William’s wife forces him to reflect on compromises made; opportunities lost.
