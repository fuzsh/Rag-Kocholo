My mother in law (Janice) was very close to him but he never much cared to discuss what happened. Although this is quite understandable she remembers waking up to him screaming from nightmares and having to tip toe about a room if he was sleeping. She would like some information on him if at all possible but she has no access to a computer, and I being a student do.

I am trying to locate any information on the above named persson who is my father. The last he was heard of was in Kenora Ontario in 1949 or at least I have a post-card from he and my mother stamped from there. My father was born in Edmonton Alberta in December between 1909-1918. His parents were GEORGE AND MARGARET PHILLIPS. He had three brothers, GEORGE, WALTER AND ROBERT and one sister CLARA. Of his siblings only his sister Clara is still alive. My father was in WW 11 having signed up in Edmonton and was at some point stationed in Ontario. He was wounded in Sicily possibly in the Knee. Upon his return to Canada he married? my mother BLANCHE DIANE PELLETIER and lived on Dundas St in Toronto Ontario. I was brought to my grandparents at the age of six months old and they raised me. I don't remember ever seeing him and I believe the last contact my grandparents had with him was the aforementioned postcard. He may have been with the IRISH REGIMENT but I am not certain. I also heard that he may in the latter years lived in Vancouver British Columbia and went by the name of Michael Taylor but this is just heresay. I know that at one point my late uncle George lived in a rooming house in Kitsilano late 70's early 80's and there was a Michael Taylor living there as well according to the city directory, but whether this had any bearing on the relationship brother to brother is unknown. I hope the someday someone will read this and possibly have some information. I don't know if my father would still be alive but I sure would like to know what happened.
