        "text": "The discovery of five mutilated corpses under Herman Goering's house at a Nazi headquarters in Poland has prompted an investigation into the identity of the corpses, German media reported on Monday.\n\nLocated in the wooded moorland of northern Poland, then southern Prussia, lies a Nazi headquarters made famous by the 2008 film Valkyrie, the Wolf's Lair (Wolfsschanze).\n\nThe base was one of the main headquarters for the German military and government during the Second World War; as a result, the compound contained homes for all of the high-ranking German leadership.\n\nIt was here that local hobby archaeologists uncovered the remains of five people of various ages, including a newborn, buried under the floorboards of Herman Goering's residence in the Wolf's Lair.\n\nThe discovery\n\nThree adults were discovered, one of which was elderly, a teenager, and a baby.\n\nThe bodies were found beneath some pipes under the floorboards of Goering's house, naked, without clothing or jewelry.\n\nArchaeologist Okatvian Bartoszewski, whose team led the excavation, the bodies must have been buried after the house had already been built, told Der Spiegel, \"Those who laid the pipes should have discovered the human remains.\"\n\nAll of the bodies were found without hands or feet, although the archaeologists caution that these \"delicate\" bones may have simply decomposed, although there is also the possibility they were amputated before death.\n\nFollowing their discovery, the team called the police, who confirmed that the bodies were not connected to a recent crime.\n\nHitler spent more time at Wolf's Lair during the Second World War than at any other location, totaling more than 800 days."
