Hermann Göring committed suicide just a few hours before the execution of his sentence. After the hangings, the bodies were transported to Munich and cremated in the crematorium of the Ostfriedhof Cemetery. The ashes were then strewn in a tributary of the Isar River.\n\nThose sentenced to imprisonment remained first in Nuremberg and were then transported on July 18, 1947, to the Allied War Criminals Prison in Berlin-Spandau, where they remained until their terms were served."
