        "text": "A document that changed the course of World War II collected dust for years inside a safe in South Carolina, allegedly because the owner couldn't read German. The Washington Post reports that a telegram from Nazi second-in-command Hermann Goering to Adolf Hitler just sold for $55,000 at auction.\n\nThe message came during the last gasps of the war, nearly a year after D-Day. Hitler had issued a secret command that if anything bad happened to him, Goering would take over. In the telegram, Goering responds to that decree, despite the fact that their relationship had cooled at that point.\n\nHere's what the telegram said, translated into English:\n\nMy Fuhrer: General Koller today gave me a briefing on the basis of communications given to him by Colonel General Jodl and General Christian, according to which you had referred certain decisions to me and emphasized that I, in case negotiations would become necessary, would be in an easier position than you in Berlin. These views were so surprising and serious to me that I felt obligated to assume, in case by 2200 o'clock no answer is forthcoming, that you have lost your freedom of action. I shall then view the conditions of your decree as fulfilled and take action for the well being of Nation and Fatherland. You know what I feel for you in these most difficult hours of my life and I cannot express this in words. God protect you and allow you despite everything to come here as soon as possible. Your faithful Hermann Goring\".\n\nPeople close to Hitler used the telegraph to turn the fuhrer against Goering, calling it \"high treason,\" and he eventually spiraled into depression. Hitler dismissed Goering, telling him if he gave up his power, he'd be spared his life. A few days later, Hitler committed suicide. Goering was convicted at Nuremberg, but killed himself before his execution."
