The materials vary from servicemen’s correspondence to scrapbooks assembled by civilians to personal papers recovered from the office of Nazi leader Hermann Goering.\n\nThe documents can be loosely divided into the following categories: correspondence, printed materials, and memorabilia collected by American servicemen and civilians; political documents; materials concerning the end of the war on both the German and the Japanese fronts; information on home-front war production; and German documents written or compiled by Nazi leaders. The materials collected by American servicemen and civilians include: scrapbooks on Iwo Jima, the Potsdam Conference, and the war crimes trials at Nuremberg; correspondence with servicemen; thank-you messages from President Harry S. Truman; the records of the 58th Bomb Wing Association; the memoirs of Justus “Jock” Lawrence, a member of General Dwight D. Eisenhower’s staff; and the newspapers or newsletters of military units. The political documents include memoranda from former President Herbert Hoover to President Truman and a draft of President Franklin Roosevelt’s message to Congress asking for a declaration of war against Japan. Materials on the end of the war include: President Truman’s proclamation announcing the surrender of Germany; Emperor Hirohito’s proclamation announcing the surrender of Japan; and a certificate of attendance at the Japanese surrender ceremonies in Tokyo Bay. Home-front production is documented in reports, statements, and printed materials relating to the Petroleum Administration, the Brewer Aeronautical Corporation, and the Lake City Ordnance Plant. Among the documents written or compiled by Nazi leaders are materials obtained from Goering’s personal files by the American journalist William Hillman; the last will and testament of Adolf Hitler; and a complaint written by war criminal Rudolf Hess in his cell in Nuremberg.\n\nThe collection contains both original documents and copies, arranged alphabetically by donor name or topic. Most of these materials were originally opened for research as part of the Miscellaneous Historical Documents Collection (MHDC) or the General Historical Documents Collection (GHDC). The MHDC and GHDC numbers are included in the folder title list.\n\nRelated manuscript collections at the Truman Library include the papers of Harry S. Truman (Official File, President’s Secretary’s Files), Dean Acheson, Mark Andrews, Paul Baade, Eleanor Bontecou, and James Quirk.\n\n[ Top of the page | Administrative Information | Collection Description | Series Descriptions | Folder Title List ]\n\nSERIES DESCRIPTIONS\n\nContainer Nos.\n\nSeries\n\n1-6\n\nSUBJECT FILE, 1932-1996\n\nPrinted materials, scrapbooks, correspondence, reports, memorabilia and other items.
