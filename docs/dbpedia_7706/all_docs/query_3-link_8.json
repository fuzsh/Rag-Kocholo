        "text": "1950 film by John Sturges\n\nThe Magnificent YankeeDirected byJohn SturgesWritten byEmmet Lavery (play)\n\nFrancis BiddleProduced byArmand DeutschStarringLouis Calhern\n\nAnn Harding\n\nEduard Franz\n\nPhilip OberCinematographyJoseph RuttenbergEdited byFerris WebsterMusic byDavid RaksinDistributed byMetro-Goldwyn-Mayer\n\nRelease date\n\nRunning time\n\n89 minutesCountryUnited StatesLanguageEnglishBudget$639,000[1][2]\n\nThe Magnificent Yankee is a 1950 American biographical film adapted by Emmet Lavery from his 1946 play of the same title, which was in turn adapted from the 1942 book Mr. Justice Holmes by Francis Biddle. The story examines the life of United States Supreme Court Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes Jr.\n\nThe film was directed by John Sturges, with stars Louis Calhern, Ann Harding, Eduard Franz, and Philip Ober. Calhern created the role of Oliver Wendell Holmes in the original Broadway production. Calhern began as a leading man in silent films but became primarily a character actor with the arrival of the sound era. His portrayal of Holmes was his only true starring role in a sound film. A grateful Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer purchased the film rights to the play specifically for Calhern in appreciation for his consistently fine work in many supporting roles during his years with the studio.\n\nThe film was nominated for Academy Awards for Best Actor in a Leading Role (Louis Calhern) and Best Costume Design, Black-and-White.\n\nA Hallmark Hall of Fame television production of the same title was broadcast in 1965 starring Alfred Lunt and Lynn Fontanne.\n\nPlot\n\n[edit]\n\nSupreme Court Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes spends his leisure time at his home, where he entertains guests with the assistance of his loving wife, Fanny. His most trusted friend is Judge Louis Brandeis, with whom he spends hours debating the law. When Fanny dies, Holmes is heartbroken and aimless, but he finds direction again by dedicating himself to his court duties and teaching the Harvard law clerks who come to work for him.\n\nCast\n\n[edit]\n\nLouis Calhern as Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes Jr.\n\nAnn Harding as Fanny Bowditch Holmes\n\nPhilip Ober as Owen Wister\n\nEduard Franz as Justice Louis Brandeis\n\nIan Wolfe as Henry Adams\n\nEdith Evanson as Annie Gough\n\nJimmy Lydon as Clinton\n\nRichard Anderson as Reynolds\n\nHerbert Anderson as Baxter\n\nHayden Rorke as Graham (uncredited)\n\nDan Tobin as Dixon (uncredited)\n\nRelease\n\n[edit]\n\nThe film was well received by critics. While produced on a relatively modest budget, the movie initially earned just $487,000 in the US and Canada and $76,000 elsewhere, resulting in a loss to MGM of $471,000.[1]\n\nMusic\n\n[edit]\n\nFor his score for this film, David Raksin incorporated the songs \"The Battle Hymn of the Republic\", \"Auld Lang Syne,\" and a portion of \"A Nightingale Sang in Berkeley Square.\" Raksin also conducted the score.[3]\n\nThe complete score was issued on CD in 2009, on Film Score Monthly records.\n\nReferences\n\n[edit]"
