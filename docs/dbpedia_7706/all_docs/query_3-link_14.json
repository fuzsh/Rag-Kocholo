        "text": "On CALHERN: articles—\n\nCurrent Biography 1951 , New York, 1951.\n\nHouseman, John, \"Filming Julius Caesar ,\" in Films in Review (New York), April 1953 and Sight and Sound (London), July/September 1953.\n\nObituary in New York Times , 13 May 1956.\n\n* * *\n\nIn the first half of the 1950s it seemed as if Louis Calhern was in every other MGM picture released. He had signed with that studio in 1949 and immediately began creating character roles that were always interesting and occasionally more. One of his first portrayals was Buffalo Bill, long white hair flowing, in the musical Annie Get Your Gun .\n\nIn 1950 Calhern recreated for the cinema his acclaimed stage role in The Magnificent Yankee , in which he had definitively impersonated—or perhaps reincarnated—Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes. The previous year he had returned to Broadway to play the role he had prepared himself for most of his professional life: the great mad King Lear.\n\nDespite the actor's gray-haired and dignified mien he was not always cast as a rock of probity. It was John Huston's crime drama The Asphalt Jungle that gave Calhern one of his few truly memorable film parts. With an inexperienced but plainly nubile Marilyn Monroe in a supporting role as his decades-younger mistress, he brought both understated menace and a sad world-weariness to his sleazy, crooked lawyer Emmerich. To her he euphemistically may have been \"Uncle Lon\" but he was far from avuncular.\n\nThis was somewhat of a return to Calhern's film roots. He began his sound film career in 1931 and throughout the decade he played villains or at least men with morality in various shades of gray. When he wasn't plotting dirty work in melodramas he was sometimes found doing it in such comedies as Paramount's Duck Soup in which the formidable Groucho Marx was his adversary.\n\nCalhern was also subjected to indignities by the comedy team of Wheeler and Woolsey in Diplomaniacs and by Danny Kaye in Up in Arms . In viewing those films one is led to wonder whether Calhern really had much sense of humor. He seems to have a puzzled look on his face that may or may not have been called for in the script. Either he wittingly played against his persona in comedies or it was played against without his complicity.\n\nCalhern usually essayed authoritative characters, helped by a powerful physical presence with a height in the 6'2\" to 6'3\" range. This imposing physique was topped by a face like that on some ancient coin. His was a Roman nose incarnate and indeed it was seen at least twice above a Roman toga in The Last Days of Pompeii and the title role in the all-star Julius Caesar .\n\nCalhern had begun his illustrious career humbly enough trouping in a Bronx stock company about 1912. He gradually made his way upward through vaudeville and repertory, eventually joining a stock company in Los Angeles. He was discovered for the cinema in the very lair of the movie industry and taken under the wing of director Lois Weber.\n\nIt was in 1921 that Louis Calhern made the first three of his five silent movies. He partnered the beauteous Weber star Claire Windsor who got far more mileage out of their pictures together than he did. With such unprepossessing titles as What's Worth While? , Woman, Wake Up! , and Too Wise Wives to his dubious credit, he soon headed east again. This time it was to a career as a Broadway matinee idol.\n\nWith the success of The Song and Dance Man in 1923 and the romantic lead in the next year's even more popular The Cobra , the decade of the Roaring Twenties was Calhern's. His reappearance in movies during the 1930s did not necessarily bring him greater fame but aging theater idols do not have great job security. He certainly did not give up the theater; a road company of Life with Father later provided him with another born-to-play role.\n\nLouis Calhern's film career had its ups and downs but he proved himself to be a distinguished character actor. If he had to endure Charlie McCarthy, Detective and The Gorgeous Hussy there were also the rewards of The Life of Emile Zola and Heaven Can Wait. Indeed, as fine wines do, Calhern got better as he aged. His once arrogant screen persona softened and grew more likable. Good roles still came, such as that of the once great actor George Lorison in The Bad and the Beautiful , Executive Suite and High Society , his last completed film, also provided him with worthy assignments. He was, as he wanted to be, still in harness and still in demand when he died in Japan during the making of what would have been his 73rd film, The Teahouse of the August Moon ."
