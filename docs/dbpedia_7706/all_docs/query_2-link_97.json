        "text": "Duck Soup (17-Nov-1933)\n\nDirector: Leo McCarey\n\nWriters: Bert Kalmar; Harry Ruby\n\nKeywords: Comedy\n\nThe wealthy Mrs. Teasdale has donated $20M to the bankrupt country of Freedonia, insisting that Rufus T. Firefly be named President. Traded insults with Ambassador Trentino of Sylvania, who like Firefly also covets the hand of Mrs. Teasdale in marriage, threaten to escalate into warfare between the two nations. Vaudeville comedy brought effectively to the screen, including the famous mirror sequence, make this a truly superior Marx Brothers offering. Entered 1990 into the National Film Registry.\n\nNameOccupationBirthDeathKnown for Edmund Breese Actor 18-Jun-1871 6-Apr-1936 Duck Soup Louis Calhern Actor 19-Feb-1895 12-May-1956 Duck Soup Margaret Dumont Actor 20-Oct-1882 6-Mar-1965 Foil to the Marx Brothers Edgar Kennedy Actor 26-Apr-1890 9-Nov-1948 Mad Wednesday Chico Marx Actor 22-Mar-1887 11-Oct-1961 An Italian con-man of a Marx Brother Groucho Marx Comic 2-Oct-1890 19-Aug-1977 You Bet Your Life Harpo Marx Actor 23-Nov-1888 28-Sep-1964 Silent harp-playing Marx Brother Zeppo Marx Actor 25-Feb-1901 30-Nov-1979 Straight man of the Marx Brothers\n\nCAST\n\nThe Four Marx BrothersGroucho Marx ...

All four of Marx Brothers are in great roles as leaders of countries, advisors, and spys. Duck Soup is a great American classic with a lot of memorable moments, and wisecracks.\n\nReview by anonymous (posted on 27-Apr-2006)\n\nDuck Soup was voted one of the top 10 funniest films of all time and is a riot from beginning to end. It is set in the mythical kingdom of Freedonia where Groucho is installed as President, Chico his Secretary of War and Harpo is a spy and peanut seller! Through Grouchos' ineptitude they end up at war with neighbouring Sylvania. Groucho is at his wisecracking best, as usual Chico is a funny straight man and Harpo drifts through the film like a magical pixie. There are many comic routines with the mirror sequence going down into film history. It also stars their marvellous foil Margaret Dumont and the inimitable Edgar Kennedy. Incidentally, Duck Soup is the only one of the Marx Brothers films where Chico and Harpo don't do their musical solo numbers on piano and harp. If you can, open a couple of beers, cook a pizza and sit back and watch an old, black and white, FUNNY film. Then look up Animal Crackers, Horse Feathers and Monkey Business.\n\nHave you seen this film?
