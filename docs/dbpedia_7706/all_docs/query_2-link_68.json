        "text": "The Magnificent Yankee\n\nLouis Calhern’s remarkable career as a Broadway and film actor from the 1920s through the 1950s (he died in 1956 at the age of 61) included memorable performances in such diverse classics as Duck Soup, Notorious and The Asphalt Jungle, as well as the title character in Julius Caesar (1953). Yet his greatest acting showcase may have been his performance as U.S. Supreme Court Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes (1841–1935) in The Magnificent Yankee, a role he created on the stage and reprised for the 1950 film version.\n\nThe credited source material for The Magnificent Yankee is the 1942 book Mr. Justice Holmes by Francis Biddle, who had been one of Holmes’s law clerks and went on to serve as attorney general under Franklin Roosevelt during most of World War II. In 1943, Voldemar Vetluguin (later the producer of the films East Side, West Side and A Life of Her Own) wrote a script treatment for M-G-M, based on the Biddle book, but playwright Emmet Lavery ultimately played the pivotal role in bringing Holmes’s life to the stage and screen. While researching Holmes’s life, Lavery consulted with Biddle as well as with John Gorham Palfrey, the executor of Holmes’s estate, Tom Corcoran, another of Holmes’s former law clerks, and Supreme Court Justice Felix Frankfurter. Lavery asked Frankfurter if he felt there would be any “impropriety” in his writing a play about Holmes and Frankfurter replied, “No, the only impropriety would be if it were not a good play. I go on the theory that Holmes belongs to the country, and anyone who wants to know about him should be encouraged.” Lavery’s play covered: Holmes’s 30-year career as a Supreme Court Justice (1902–1932); his relationship with his wife, Fanny Dixwell Holmes (her maiden name was mysteriously changed to “Bowditch” for the film version); and the parade of law clerks who Holmes viewed as the sons he never had (Frankfurter saw this as a bit of dramatic license on Lavery’s part).\n\nThe play opened on New Year’s Eve 1945 in Washington D.C., with Calhern as Holmes and Dorothy Gish as Fanny; Biddle was unable to attend, as he was in Germany presiding over the Nuremburg war crimes trials. The play moved to the Royale Theater on Broadway, opening on January 22, 1946, and running for 159 performances, but despite the show’s relatively brief run, United Artists producer Benedict Bogeaus (The Bridge of San Luis Rey, The Diary of a Chambermaid) purchased the screen rights with the intention of casting a younger actor as Holmes, possibly Gregory Peck. That same year, Lavery managed to use his appearance at the House Un-American Activities Committee hearing to promote Yankee: refusing to name names, he told the committee that a better way to advance the cause of anti-Communism would be to “dramatize the American way of life,” feeling it would be better to demonstrate “how good Mr. Holmes was than how bad Mr. Stalin is.”\n\nShepard Traube acquired the film rights to Yankee in 1949 and announced plans to produce and direct an independent film version, with Lavery adapting his play and Calhern reprising his stage role. Ultimately, the film would go into production at M-G-M in the summer of 1950, with John Sturges directing the Armand Deutsch production and Lavery writing the script. The 89-minute screen version understandably shortened Lavery’s three-act play but added scenes in the Supreme Court’s chambers as well as location footage of Washington D.C. Lavery consulted with the young actors playing Holmes’s “sons,” while a piece in Time magazine listed several of Holmes’s traits left out of the movie version—such as his “regular excursions to Washington’s burlesque houses, his well-thumbed library of spicy stories, his ear-curling, off-the-bench vocabulary”—and noted that Holmes’s personal secretary in 1929, the accused spy Alger Hiss, unsurprisingly went unmentioned in the film.\n\nThe film version of The Magnificent Yankee begins in 1902, when Holmes and his wife Fanny (Ann Harding) move to Washington D.C. as he begins his tenure as a Justice of the Supreme Court. A visit from Congressman Adams (Ian Wolfe), grandson of President John Adams, reminds Fanny of the loss they feel over being unable to have children, but soon Holmes views his parade of law clerks, a new one every year, as the sons he never had. During his 30 years on the Supreme Court, Holmes sees his close friend Louis Brandeis (Eduard Franz) join him on the bench, and while disappointed that he will never be named Chief Justice, he becomes one of the most respected Justices in the Court’s history. Fanny falls ill and dies, but not before making him promise to stay on the Court as long as he feels able. He keeps his word, not retiring until he nears his 91st birthday, and as the film ends he is back at home, preparing for a visit from the new President, Franklin Delano Roosevelt.\n\nCalhern discussed his work on Yankee (and his plans to star in a Broadway revival of King Lear) in an August 1950 Los Angeles Times profile, claiming that he was featured even more in the film than in the stage version, where Holmes was offstage for a total of three minutes: “I advised Metro executives and our director, John Sturges, on the Magnificent Yankee set about my qualms. I said, ‘Now you have even eliminated my three minutes offstage in this version. How on earth are people going to stand seeing big-nosed Calhern throughout this entire picture?’ ‘Ah,’ they said, ‘but we can cut away from you; center on some other character; do just what you were able to accomplish on the stage; manage it technically.’ So you may hear the voice of Calhern booming in the background, but you’ll be watching the reactions of beautiful Ann Harding. That is definitely where pictures have an edge on the theater and can make things easier on the actor.” A month later, the Times announced that actor Philip Ober, who played Holmes’s friend Owen Wister (best known as the author of The Virginian) was being brought back to add narration to the film, but the narration in Yankee serves such an important function in tying incidents spread out over 30 years into a 90-minute narrative that it is strange to think this could have been an afterthought.\n\nThe film premiered on December 20, 1950, just in time for Academy consideration, and reviews were mixed to favorable, with Newsweek terming Calhern’s work “a robust, theatrically effective characterization of the great man,” and Cue praising it as “a splendid portrait.” Even Merle Miller in the Saturday Review of Literature, who called the film “The Magnificent Disappointment” and accused the filmmakers of making “one of this country’s intellectual and spiritual giants into a dull-witted midget,” saw Calhern’s work as “something of a miracle.” The New Yorker was particularly harsh in its view of the film’s abridgment of Holmes’s lengthy career, remarking that “the film plainly has little time for Holmes’s forensic activities, most of it being devoted to the Great Dissenter’s whimsicalities, such as chasing fire engines, trespassing on lawns to pick flowers for his wife, and figuring out his theory of clear and present danger in relation to free speech by chatting with Justice Brandeis and a parrot at the Washington Zoo.” Their reviewer was even critical of Calhern, who ”seems dead set on making Justice Holmes a lovable old codger, so full of chuckles and mischief and general euphoria that it is hard to believe he ever worried about any legal problems more serious than those usually handled by desk sergeants.”\n\nThese criticisms are not unwarranted, for it is a little frustrating that—73 years after Holmes’s death—the only film to feature him as a major character gives such short shrift to his great work on the bench. If nothing else, however, the film proves an excellent showcase for Calhern, who showed admirable restraint in adapting his stage performance for the screen and made one truly believe in the greatness of Holmes. Yankee was the second of four films John Sturges directed for Deutsch in fairly rapid succession, coming right between Right Cross and Kind Lady, and while the opening scenes demonstrate some impressive camera movements, the rest of the film betrays its stage origins fairly clearly: the entire play is set in Holmes’s library, and the majority of the film retains that setting. Calhern earned a Best Actor nomination for his performance, his only Oscar nod, with the award ultimately going to José Ferrer in Cyrano de Bergerac (Walter Plunkett’s costumes were also nominated).\n\nThe Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences began announcing pre-nomination short lists in the technical categories in 1950, and David Raksin’s music for Yankee made the 10-film short list but ultimately failed to earn a nomination. (Variety called Raksin’s score “effective without intruding.”) Raksin scored all four of the Sturges-Deutsch collaborations of the early 1950s, and just as Calhern’s performance dominates The Magnificent Yankee, Raksin’s theme for Holmes dominates his score. This Americana-tinged melody first appears in the lively main title, and Raksin varies it impressively throughout the score, the versatile theme proving both thoughtful and festive depending on the needs of the scene.\n\nAs Holmes’s relationship with his wife is one of the story’s principal threads, Raksin develops the Holmes theme into a charming waltz for Fanny, which features an interpolation of the standard “A Nightingale Sang in Berkeley Square” (a surprising choice, since the song was not published until 1940, five years after Holmes’s death).\n\nBefitting the importance of history in the film, both Holmes’s memories of the Civil War and his groundbreaking judicial decisions, Raksin incorporates some classic tunes into his score: “The Battle Hymn of the Republic” for a scene in which Holmes visits the Civil War battlefield where he fought four decades earlier (track 15); and “Auld Lang Syne” for the film’s sentimental centerpiece, where Holmes is visited on his 80th birthday by all his “sons” (track 19). For the introductory shots of Washington D.C., Raksin uses a third principal theme, a somber melody suggesting the gravity of Holmes’s responsibilities on the Supreme Court; the score concludes with a stirring reprise of this theme over the final cast credits. —\n\nDavid Raksin’s score for The Magnificent Yankee is mastered from ¼″ monaural tapes of what were originally 35mm optical masters, with a few cues (otherwise lost) filled in from acetates."
