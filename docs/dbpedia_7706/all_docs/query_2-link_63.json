        "text": "Those mad clowns, the Marx brothers, are now holding forth on the Rivoli screen in their latest concoction, \"Duck Soup,\" a production in which the bludgeon is employed more often than the gimlet. The result is that this production is, for the most part, extremely noisy without being nearly as mirthful as their other films. There are, however, one or two ideas in this sea of puns that are welcome, and Groucho, Chico, Harpo and Zeppo reveal their customary zeal in striving to get as much as possible out of these incidents.Groucho is the latest of the performers to indulge in a mythical kingdom story, for he, as the more or less illustrious Rufus T. Firefly, after being referred to as possessing the statesmanship of Gladstone, the humility of Lincoln and the wisdom of Pericles, is made the dictator of Freedonia. Slapping the face of Ambassador Trentino, Sylvania's representative, means little to Firefly, even though it may result in war. As one might imagine, there is not only friction between Freedonia and Sylvania during most of this story, but also among other persons in the country ruled over by Groucho, or Mr. Firefly. Mrs. Teasdale, whose husband was a serious thinker who once held Firefly's job, is keen to see that Firefly gets full support from other worthies.During one important juncture for Freedonia, one discovers that two of the brothers Marx—Chico and Harpo—have decorated their faces with black mustaches and spectacles, so that they look like doubles of Groucho. This gives the performers a chance for many stunts, including the idea that one of them is the reflection of the other in a mirror. The insanity persists until a third, or the real Groucho, appears on the scene, which yesterday aroused a torrent of laughter.Another equally hilarious morsel is where the dumb Harpo does a Paul Revere ride for Freedonia's sake. It happens, however, that Harpo, unlike the original, has an eye for a pretty face, and therefore when he perceives a girl in the window the ride comes to an abrupt end. Wild activities ensue, however, for the husband of the young blonde turns up and Revere's imitator has to hide under the water in a bathtub. Subsequently, when the frightened husband has made himself scarce, Harpo thinks that it would be a good idea to bring his horse into the house.In another episode Groucho works himself up into a state of frenzy over a supposed insult, and when Ambassador Trentino appears with a hope of avoiding war, Groucho again slaps Sylvania's envoy. A certain amount of fun is furnished by Harpo's being constantly busy with a pair of scissors. He cuts the tails off Trentino's well-tailored coat and also uses his shears to cut a panama hat in half and to despoil other articles of clothing.Now and again the governmental activities in Freedonia are interrupted with music and song. Besides the characteristic work of the Marx brothers, Louis Calhern gives an adequate interpretation as Trentino. Margaret Dumont is satisfactory as the eminent Mrs. Teasdale and Edwin Maxwell officiates as Secretary of War.\n\nDUCK SOUP, based on a story by Bert Kalmar and Harry Ruby; directed by Leo McCarey; a Paramount production.
