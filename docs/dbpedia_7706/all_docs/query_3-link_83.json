        "text": "In The Iron Mask, we saw the end of Douglas Fairbanks’s career as an adventure hero. The coming of sound brought down the curtain on the swashbuckling tradition in silent film. Audiences wanted to see movie stars talking. Additionally, since early sound equipment was so cumbersome and the new technology so crude, making large-scale adventure films became impractical, especially at the height of the Depression. The genre went dormant. Instead, Hollywood turned to contemporary material based on stagey Broadway plays. There were early musicals, too, that often featured static cinematography with a camera that never moved. The advent of sound also engendered suggestive dialogue. The movies entered the pre-Code era of adult subject matter in which themes that had been previously taboo were now depicted regularly for the first time. In the early 1930s, sin was in, and the movies glamorized it.\n\nHowever, by 1934, church groups and civic organizations had put sufficient pressure on Hollywood to censor motion pictures. The studios responded to the “Legion of Decency” by enforcing their Production Code, which strictly monitored the content of films. In the wake of the Code, studios began to turn to safe material. Literary classics reappeared on movie screens. Films like MGM’s Treasure Island showed the tremendous popularity of the genre. Also, with advancements in sound technology, studios were now able to dramatize historical subjects. In this new era, the spirit of adventure and the hero tradition returned. In 1934, The Count of Monte Cristo heralded a new wave of swashbuckling cinema. It is one of the great adventure classics of all time.\n\nBased on the 1845 novel by Alexandre Dumas, The Count of Monte Cristo is one of the most famous stories about revenge in all of literature. It’s been made into several film versions, but many people, including myself, consider this the definitive version. Set during the Napoleonic era, Robert Donat portrays a sailor, Edmond Dantes, who falls into a political trap and is accused of treason against the King of France. He is subsequently tossed into prison—the notorious Chateau D’If. It is here where he plans an escape. With renewed hope sparked by the companionship of a saintly prisoner, Dantes vows to bring justice against the three men who wronged him. Each villain had their own motive for wanting him dead. Donat makes a convincing transformation in the film from the innocent young sailor to the cool and calculating avenging angel. He is terrific in what has become one of the great movie adaptations.\n\nThroughout the 1920s, British star Robert Donat acted on the stage and performed in a Shakespearian company. He was signed by film producer Alexander Korda and made his film debut in 1932. But it was his appearance in The Private Life of Henry VIII that caught the eye of Hollywood. Today, Donat is best known for Alfred Hitchcock’s The 39 Steps, and for his role as the schoolmaster in Goodbye, Mr. Chips, for which he won the Best Actor Oscar of 1939. Charles Laughton, who had played Henry VIII opposite Donat, later called him “the most graceful actor of our time.”\n\nDonat made very few films in his career—only twenty to be exact—but that was due in part to poor health. He suffered from asthma for most of his life, and this curtailed his film output. As mentioned in my introduction, he dropped out of Captain Blood. (It was reportedly a three picture contract with Warners that would’ve also included Anthony Adverse and, according to one source, The Adventures of Robin Hood.) His health problems most likely would’ve prevented him from becoming a popular swashbuckler. In addition, he did not care much for the Hollywood scene, so for the rest of his career he made films only in his native England. The Count of Monte Cristo was his only film in Hollywood.\n\nRobert Donat was one of Britain’s finest actors whose life was sadly cut short at the age of 53. But in that abbreviated film career, he was a screen presence who radiated charm, modesty, and the ability to make audiences sympathize with him.\n\nThe excellent supporting cast in this film includes Elissa Landi as Mercedes. Landi was an Italian-born actress who appeared in many Hollywood films in the 1930s. Besides acting, she was a writer and even wrote a novel at the age of 20. It was the first of six that she would write throughout her life. Landi is probably best-known for her performance in Cecil B. DeMille’s The Sign of the Cross as the fair-haired Christian who fascinates Fredric March.\n\nIn the role of Abbe Faria, Dante’s fellow prisoner, is Australian actor O.P. Heggie. Heggie was born in 1877 and made his stage debut at the turn of the century. Being primarily a theatre actor, he did not appear in films until 1928. His most famous role is that of the blind hermit in 1935’s The Bride of Frankenstein. Director James Whale specifically requested Heggie for this part, perhaps influenced by his performance in tonight’s film, which came out the year before. Heggie always brought humanity to his characters, infusing them with wisdom, tenderness, and a spiritual strength.\n\nIn the role of young Albert Mondego is Canadian-born Douglas Walton. Never a major star, Walton usually played effeminate intellectuals. He was Percy Shelley in the opening prologue to The Bride of Frankenstein. But here he shows a greater range as the son looking to restore some degree of honor to the family name.\n\nSidney Blackmer, Louis Calhern, Robert Donat, and Raymond Walburn\n\nThe Count of Monte Cristo features a trio of villains played by terrific character actors. Sidney Blackmer, as the rejected suitor Mondego, appeared in over 120 films– from a small part in The Perils of Pauline in 1914 to Rosemary’s Baby in 1968. He starred with Shirley Temple in Heidi and played Teddy Roosevelt in several films. In 1950 he won a Tony award for Best Actor in the play Come Back, Little Sheba. Danglars, the banker, is portrayed by Raymond Walburn, who made a career mostly in comedies throughout the 1930s and 1940s. He worked with such directors as Frank Capra and Preston Sturges. Finally, in the role of the magistrate, De Villefort, is Louis Calhern. Like many other actors of the time, Calhern started out on the stage and then debuted in silent movies. He is probably best-known for his performance as Ambassador Trentino in Duck Soup. But his filmography also includes Notorious and The Asphalt Jungle.\n\nThe Count of Monte Cristo was directed by Rowland V. Lee—a name many horror fans associate with 1939’s Son of Frankenstein, which is the last of the great Frankenstein films. Another film of his I’d recommend is the romantic Zoo in Budapest, which is currently unavailable on dvd. But I hope 20th Century Fox will release it one day as part of their Archive series. Zoo in Budapest stars Loretta Young as a runaway orphan in a zoo, but in a supporting role as the zoo director is O.P. Heggie.\n\nRowland V. Lee would direct a sequel to The Count of Monte Cristo in 1941; Louis Hayward starred as The Son of Monte Cristo. Lee also contributed to the screenplay of The Count of Monte Cristo. Since the unabridged version of the novel is about as large as War and Peace, storylines had to be condensed and subplots omitted. The story is told very economically—sometimes in very short scenes– but without it appearing rushed or as though corners had been cut.\n\nThe Count of Monte Cristo was produced by Edward Small for Reliance Pictures and released through United Artists. Some movie fans associate Small with the film noirs he produced in the 1940s like Raw Deal, but in the 1930s he was making swashbucklers like tonight’s film as well as The Man in the Iron Mask in 1939. Even though The Count of Monte Cristo has a lower budget compared to studios like MGM and Paramount, it looks beautiful, and a large part of the credit goes to its cinematography by J. Peverell Marley, who had been Cecil B. DeMille’s primary cameraman. Whether it’s in the French prison or the catacombs in Rome, a viewer gets a strong sense of place and atmosphere.\n\nThe film also features a dramatic musical score by one of the great screen composers, Alfred Newman. I think a few modern viewers might critique some of the film’s religious underscoring in the final scene with the Abbe, but it’s one of the most dramatic moments in the film, and Newman would use this motif again a year later when he incorporated “Ave Maria” into the score for 1935’s Les Miserables with Fredric March.\n\nNow for many years, this film was available only in shortened versions or in colorized VHS copies. It’s rarely screened, but tonight you are the ones who will find the treasure—a cinema treasure. It took the saintly Abbe Faria years to reach Edmond Dantes, but tonight you will find him with far less effort. Our search to find the true face of The Count of Monte Cristo is over as we present this wonderful movie the way it was originally intended.\n\n* * * * * *\n\nWe had another week of long lines and another full house!\n\nProgram host Matthew C. Hoffman addressing the audience on 3/21/13."
