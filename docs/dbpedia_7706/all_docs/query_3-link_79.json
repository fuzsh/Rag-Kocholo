        "text": "My first motion picture experience took place in the early 1930s. The movie played in an upstairs dance hall on Main Street in my town of Montgomery, Minn.\n\nI don’t remember the name of the movie, but we sat on folding chairs on the wooden floor that showed wear from many Saturday night wedding dances.\n\nA white screen up front brought to life the figures and the story. I don’t remember anything more about this first experience and little did I imagine how big movie-making would become.\n\nNot long after, single-screen movie theaters began to appear in the small towns. One of ours was named the Monty. Tiny blue lights mimicking stars peered down at us from a rounded deep blue sky ceiling.\n\nWe were awed by this new wonder that had come to town. The latest movies were shown for 35 cents for adults and 10 cents for children. Showings were in the evening except on Sunday afternoons.\n\nKids came to school the next day excited about the previous night’s movie, some of them reporting that they had stayed in their seats for the second showing.\n\nOne movie I have never forgotten is “The Last Days of Pompeii.” I watched it on a Sunday afternoon in 1935 with my twin sister, Dorothy, and two of our second cousins, Dick and Doug.\n\nThe movie about the ancient Italian city being destroyed by the eruption of Mount Vesuvius totally impressed me. When I visited Pompeii in 1977 it reinforced my awe of what happened there.\n\nFor a while I thought the film was lost but I saw it on television a few years ago. The actors were Preston Foster, Basil Rathbone, Alan Hale and Louis Calhern.\n\nMom and dad liked to take us to the New Prague on Saturday nights for the cowboy movies where the price was 10 cents for adults or children. These were the days of Gene Autry, Ken Maynard and others.\n\nWe didn’t have to sit through the trash advertising that we are subjected to today. Before the movie started there were newsreels of recent events and/or a short cartoon, which we kids enjoyed.\n\nWhen there was a world championship heavyweight boxing match, we listened to the blow-by-blow account of the event on radio and then waited for the film to come to our local theater.\n\nFights were held in Madison Square Garden in New York City by promoter Mike Jacobs. My dad and his friends gathered around the radio and tried to visualize what was happening. I especially remember the accounts of the Max Schmeling, Jack Sharkey, Primo Carnera, Max Baer, James Braddock and Joe Louis fights.\n\nAll took place in the 1930s and all were world champions in that order. Joe Louis, in my opinion, was the most devastating puncher of all time. He knocked out six world champions: Carnera, Sharkey, Braddock, Baer, Schmeling and Walcott and defended his title 25 times, more times than the preceding eight champions together.\n\nHis fights against the German, Max Baer, were probably the most publicized. When these fights came to the theaters we were anxious to see them on film, even though we knew the outcome.\n\nWhile all this was happening, movies continued to become a greater part of American life. My wife, Jokki, reminds me that the first movie we saw together was “For Whom the Bell Tolls,” starring Gary Cooper, Ingrid Bergman and Akim Tamiroff.\n\nThe movie was made in 1943 and we met in 1944. She insists we saw it, so I suppose the timing is correct. Women usually are right about such things.\n\nHundreds, maybe thousands of movies later, we are still watching the silver screen on our televisions and at the theaters.\n\nDon Peyer is a 44-year Carson resident and the former president of the United Amateur Press Association."
