Maxwell had been listed among the bit actors on a CBCS bulletin dated Jan 1950. Actor Strother Martin made his feaure film debut in the film.\n\nThe Asphalt Jungle, one of the first motion pictures to realistically show the criminal world from the criminal's viewpoint, is widely regarded by film critics as one of John Huston's best. The film received mostly favorable reviews in 1950, with particular praise given to Huston's direction and the performances of the leading actors. One of the film's detractors, however, was M-G-M production head Louis B. Mayer, who is quoted in a modern source as having once said, \"That Asphalt Pavement thing is full of nasty, ugly people doing nasty things. I wouldn't walk across the room to see a thing like that.\" The film received the following Academy Award nominations: Huston for Best Direction, Sam Jaffe for Best Suporting Actor, Huston and Ben Maddow for Best Screenplay, and Harold Rosson for Best Black and White Cinematography. Jaffe also received the Cannes Award for Best Performance of the Year. Producer Arthur Hornblow, Jr., stars Louis Calhern and Jean Hagen, and novelist Burnett received \"Edgar\" Awards from the Mystery Writers of America for their work on the film, which was chosen as the outstanding mystery film of 1950.\n\nA biography of Huston indicates that Lola Albright was Huston's first choice for the part played by Marilyn Monroe, but that Albright was unavailable. In his autobiography, Huston noted that he consulted with Burnett several times during the development of the script, and that Burnett gave his approval of the final screenplay. The film was colorized by Turner Entertainment Co. in the late 1980s. In Jul 1989, Huston's heirs made an unsuccessful attempt to prevent a colorized version of the film from being broadcast on French television, but Huston's heirs lost their case in French court. The case pitted the country's longstanding legal protection of authors' rights against the legal standing of contracts signed in the United States between directors and studios. The colorized version was broadcast in 1989, but in 1994, the appeals court in Versailles reversed the 1989 ruling and fined Turner 400,000 francs (then about $74,000) for having broadcast the colorized version.\n\nM-G-M released three remakes of The Asphalt Jungle: the 1958 western, The Badlanders, directed by Delmer Daves and starring Alan Ladd and Ernest Borgnine; the 1963 British production, Cairo, directed by Wolf Rilla and starring George Sanders and Richard Johnson (see AFI Catalog of Feature Films, 1961-70; F6.0625); and the 1972 all-black cast film, Cool Breeze, written and directed by Barry Pollack and starring Thalmus Rasulala and Judy Pace. An ABC television series entitled The Asphalt Jungle ran from 2 Apr to 24 Sep 1961 and starred Jack Warden and Arch Johnson.\n\nLess\n\nWhen police track hoodlum and ex-convict Dix Handley to a caf√©, Dix's friend, the owner, Gus Minissi, saves him from arrest by hiding his gun.

At Cobby's, he meets Doc, who has heard that Emmerich has gone bankrupt spending all his money on Angela.

Emmerich asks Cobby to advance him the fifty thousand dollars, and on the night of the crime, manages to pull himself away from his lonely wife May to meet Brannom. Meanwhile, Doc, Dix, safe cracker Louis Ciavelli and driver Gus rob the store expertly, but when a watchman happens by, Dix hits him and fires his gun accidentally, wounding Louis. Gus, afraid to take Louis to a doctor, delivers him to his home, where his wife Maria cries helplessly watching him die. Dix and Doc go to Emmerich's as planned and realize he is trying to cheat them when Brannom pulls out his gun. Brannom and Dix end up shooting each other, and as Brannom dies, Doc advises a terrified Emmerich to ask the insurance company to pay for the return of the jewels, no questions asked, or else Dix will kill him. Soon after, Emmerich dumps Brannom in the river, and Dix and Doc escape to Doll's new apartment, where Dix refuses to see a doctor, though he is bleeding. Soon, the police find Brannom's body with a piece of Emmerich's stationery in his pocket, and though Emmerich uses Angela as his alibi, his story is quickly destroyed when a taxi driver tells Hardy that he once dropped Doc off at Cobby's, and Cobby confesses the whole scheme. Hardy then pushes a willing Angela to tell the truth about Emmerich, who immediately shoots himself. After Doc hears about the suicide, he says goodbye to Dix and leaves town. By lingering at a caf√© outside of the city in order to leer at a young girl dancing, however, Doc gives the police just enough time to catch him. Meanwhile, the weakening Dix agrees to let Doll escape with him to Kentucky, barely making it to his family farm. As he dies in the pasture, Hardy speaks to the press about the pervasiveness of crime in the urban jungle.\n\nLess"
