        "text": "Post by teleadm on\n\nLouis Calhern had been a matineé idol of Broadway since the early 1920s, according to unconfirmed sources hired becase he was tall and handsome, other sources say the whole team was hired on the spot.\n\nIn 1924 on Broadway in a play named Cobra, he became a female idol, making them faint.\n\nWhen sound movies came around, talking actors became attractive, for some but not Louis, since he was put into the foppish roles.\n\nAmbassador Trentino in Duck Soup 1934.\n\nIn Heaven Can Wait 1943 he solved problems by always \"keep a stiff upper lip\"\n\nCary Grant's \"boss\" in Notorious 1946\n\nDuring the 1946-1947 season he had a great success on Broadway in this play, In the movie version his role was played by Curd Jurgens 1958.\n\nIn the late 1940s Louis Calhern got an offer from MGM for a long time contract, he agreed on one condition, make a movie of his latest theatrical role of The Magnificent Yankee, and MGM made it but waited a year to premiere it.\n\nAs Buffallo Bill in hit Annie Get Your Gun 1950\n\nMomentararly having his eyes on something else in classic heist movie The Asphalt Jungle 1950\n\nHaving success on Broadway as King Lear 1950-1951\n\nAs Julius Caesar in Julius Caesar 1953\n\nWhile under contract there was a few duties too, like playing King Ferdinand of Karlsberg in The Student Prince 1954\n\nUncle Willie in High Society 1956, with a crooner and princess that was famous. and that was his goodbye.\n\nHis next role was supposed to be in The Teahouse of the August Moon, had a heart attack and passed away 1956. Paul Ford took over the role at short notice.\n\nLouis Calhern was a lifelong alcoholic, refusing any help, but by the time he sign a contract with MGM he was clean, declaring that he was an atheist.\n\nWhen MGM turned 25 there was a lot of fancy pics with contractual stars, but when they turned 30 this was it?\n\n125 years since his birth! This Year\n\nThanks for watching!\n\nOppinionons of all kinds are very welcome!\n\nPost by london777 on\n\nWhile under contract there was a few duties too, like playing King Ferdinand of Karlsberg in The Student Prince 1954\n\nProbably the best Student Prince in the world.\n\nLouis Calhern was a lifelong alcoholic, refusing any help, but by the time he sign a contract with MGM he was clean, declaring that he was an atheist.\n\nYep, nothing can drive you to drink like religion (except women or following an unsuccessful soccer club).\n\nThe movie I first noticed him in, when I was a child, was \"Executive Suite\" (1954) dir: Robert Wise. (1954). No idea why. He must have been way down the billing as, to quote \"2001\", it was \"full of stars\":"
