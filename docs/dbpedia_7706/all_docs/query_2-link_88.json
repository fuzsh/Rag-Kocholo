        "text": "(Originally posted on Channel Awesome on January 5, 2015)\n\nThe Marx Bros. are at their wildest and zaniest in this hilarious anti-war comedy Duck Soup.\n\nThe five Marx Bros. - Leonard (Chico), Adolph (Harpo), Julius Henry (Groucho), Milton (Gummo), and Herbert Manfred (Zeppo) - were born into a German-French Jewish family living in the Upper East Side of New York City. They weren't the first in their family to go into showbiz; their maternal uncle was comedian Al Sheen, and their grandfather had been a ventriloquist. The five Marx Bros. made their debuts on the vaudeville circuit as early as 1907, originally performing musical numbers before segueing into comedy. Over the years, each of the brothers developed their own typical stage persona, said to be mostly based on their real-life personalities, and started improvising most of their acts. Despite their talents, they struggled professionally for a number of years, and a silent comedy short filmed in 1920 (Humor Risk) didn't help - especially since Humor Risk was never actually shown in theaters. Fortunately, in 1923, they had their first real success with the show I'll Say She Is, which ended up making it to Broadway. From that point on, they became huge hits on the stage, and it wasn't long before Hollywood came calling. Not only that, but from 1932-1933, Groucho and Chico also starred in the short-lived radio comedy Flywheel, Shyster, and Flywheel.\n\nIn 1929, the Marx Bros. signed on with Paramount and made their (official) film debut with The Cocoanuts, featuring songs by none other than Irving Berlin. It apparently wasn't an easy shoot, with Groucho being particularly disdainful of directors Robert Florey and Joseph Santley. The Marx Bros. even tried to stop the film from being released, but Paramount refused. The Cocoanuts ended up being a huge financial success, (it was one of the most profitable of the early all-talking movies made up to that point) and drawing strong critical praise. Despite a rocky relationship with the studio, the Marx Bros. made four more films for Paramount: Animal Crackers (1930), Monkey Business (1931), Horse Feathers (1932), and Duck Soup (1933). Duck Soup was directed by Leo McCarey, who had previously worked on an early Laurel and Hardy comedy of the same name in 1927 as a supervising director. McCarey's later directing credits include The Awful Truth (1937) and Going My Way (1944), both of which earned him Academy Awards for Best Director, as well as An Affair to Remember (1957).\n\nThe Cocoanuts (1929)â€‹\n\nWARNING: Here be spoilers! Read further at your own risk!\n\nOur story opens in Freedonia, a bankrupt nation kept financially solvent solely because of the wealthy Mrs. Teasdale (Margaret Dumont). Freedonia needs another loan from her, but she refuses unless the current leader resigns and Rufus T. Firefly (Groucho Marx) is appointed in his place. However, Firefly barely seems interested in the job, although he does sing a song in the midst of his swearing-in ceremony about what's in store for Freedonia. Freedonia has other problems, though - Ambassador Trentino of Sylvania (Louis Calhern) has his eye on conquering Freedonia. He plans to do so by marrying Mrs. Teasdale, but she's sweet on Firefly. Trentino dispatches a pair of spies - Chicolini (Chico Marx) and Pinky (Harpo Marx) to spy on Firefly and see if there's any potential to start a scandal that would make Mrs. Teasdale ditch him. Lots of hilarious hijinks ensue that no summary can do justice to, our leads' antics eventually leading Freedonia and Sylvania into all-out war with each other for the flimsiest of reasons.\n\nNo matter how many times I see this movie, the jokes and the gags still make me laugh, and knowing they're coming doesn't make them any less funny. This is the Marx Bros. movie that gave us the often-imitated but inimitable mirror scene, where Harpo (dressed as Groucho) pretends to be the real Groucho's reflection. It's some of the best live-action physical comedy I've ever seen. This gag has been done before and since then - even Errol Flynn did it in Never Say Goodbye (1946) - but this version is hard to top. Not only that, but the Marx Bros.'s familiar stage and screen personas are on full display here: Groucho as the rapid-fire snarker, Chico as the smooth-talking con man, Harpo as the voiceless clown, and Zeppo (playing Firefly's secretary Bob Roland) as...um...the guy who does the...the thing...yeah, I have no idea how to describe Zeppo. I guess as the guy who takes all the madness in stride without batting an eye. I'd call him the straight man of the group, but that role clearly belongs to Margaret Dumont and Louis Calhern, the fall-guys for the Marx Bros.'s antics, and I don't know how they kept it together long enough to shoot a complete take. Dumont was a Marx Bros. regular, and Calhern would later rack up a number of supporting roles in such films as The Life of Emil Zola (1937), Alfred Hitchcock's Notorious (1946), and Blackboard Jungle (1955).\n\nAt 70 minutes long, barely more than an hour, Duck Soup manages to get the laughs in without overstaying its welcome, as a few comedies I've seen have managed to do. The film manages to fit in the plot details well enough that you can follow what's going on, as long as you don't think too much about whose side Chicolini and Pinky are supposed to be on. The only parts that drag for me are the songs, which I didn't like all that much, but you all might feel differently. The story is only an excuse to set up the gags, but because they're so well done and well delivered, I can forgive the movie for this, and the pot-shots at political cronyism and incompetence are timeless. The production design manages to parody the grandeur and spectacle of an elaborate set, looking surreal enough that it doesn't feel out of place in a comedy like this.\n\nAs much as I enjoy this movie, there are some serious issues with Duck Soup that can't be ignored. For one thing, except for Zeppo, the Marx Bros.'s characters are too detached from what's going on around them. I know it fits their characters and the political satire, but they go just a little too far with this. (This was a criticism the film received at the time of its release as well.) Even in a farce, there should still be some sense of investment on the part of the main characters - otherwise, how can the audience care about what's going on? Also, the anti-war theme, now that we have World War II's historical context available to us, might bother some people. (I actually do know people who have this attitude towards Duck Soup, and I completely understand where they're coming from.) The biggest strike against Duck Soup is a couple instances of racist humor, including a segue into a spiritual in the middle of the song \"This Country's Going to War,\" straight out of a minstrel show. Regardless of the intended anti-war message of this scene and the absence of black-face makeup, there's no getting around what it is. Reportedly, this bit was almost cut from the film's DVD release, but it ended up being left in. As distasteful as the scene is, I personally don't think cutting it out would have accomplished anything other than sweeping it under the rug and pretending racist attitudes like this didn't (and don't) exist in popular culture. I don't bring this up to get you to hate on this movie - it's merely to give fair warning and let you know what you're in for should you decide to check it out.\n\nDuck Soup has been described as being a box office flop, which it certainly wasn't - it was among the highest grossing films of 1933. However, it wasn't as profitable as the Marx Bros.'s previous films, which I guess in Hollywood means the same thing as flopping. Also, it wasn't exactly a critical darling when it was released, derided as being too zany and irreverent for Depression-era audiences, not to mention the criticism I pointed out before. On a stranger note, the city of Fredonia in New York actually complained about the name \"Freedonia\" being used in the movie, saying it reflected badly on the town. (Groucho's response was that the town's name reflected badly on the movie.) Also, Benito Mussolini had Duck Soup banned in Italy because he thought it was a personal shot against him - the Marx Bros. were delighted by this. This film also marked the end of the Marx Bros.'s association with Paramount, eventually moving on to MGM. Zeppo and Gummo left the act around this time to become talent agents, helping a number of A-list names get their feet in the door. Today, however, Duck Soup is deservedly one of the Marx Bros's best-remembered comedies. It's the highest-ranked of three Marx Bros. comedies that made the AFI's 100 Funniest Movies list, alongside A Night at the Opera (1935) and A Day at the Races, (1937). Even the name Freedonia has been used in a whole bunch of stuff, from Doctor Who (\"The Shakespeare Code\") to The West Wing (\"Freedonia\")."
