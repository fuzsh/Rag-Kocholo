        "text": "John Steinbeck adapted his own 1933 novella into this charming coming of age tale, one that takes an empathetic look at childhood. What’s especially striking here is how well this seems to understand that POV, told from Tom (Peter Miles)’s level rather than trying to condescend to it.\n\nMixing in some incredibly imaginative fantasy sequences, director Lewis Milestone imbues everything with a strong sense of innocence, all while steadily adding in a more bittersweet side underneath. The older cast’s subtle acting really compliments that style: each gets across so much non-verbally, their little underplayed reactions adding weight to the corners of this story.\n\nIt’s all driven by this boy and his connection with the titular animal, the film using…\n\nMy second \"watched a whole-ass feature for about 10 seconds of effects animation by UPA\" movie in a month, which it feels like at some point I will need to listen to what the universe is telling me about being a completionist. I'll say that at least this one also has Myrna Loy in the cast, so I likely would have gotten to it at some point anyway. Kind of a weird overall experience: the first 40 minutes or more are selling absolutely nothing other than \"charming kiddie story about being an enthusiastic dreamer\", and director Lewis Milestone is really leaning into the froth of it. And then the last 25 minutes raise their hands to say \"you did see…\n\nSappy, rambling and slight but very agreeable nonetheless, the script for The Red Pony was assembled by Steinbeck himself from a collection of short stories and has a lot in common with several other films about young boys adopting animals who then learn hard lessons of life through tragedy—The Yearling, Old Yeller and Kes come to mind, though narratively this is odd and tonally uneven with some interesting subplots that are barely developed and improperly resolved, namely the marital friction between Myrna Loy's country loving housewife and Shepperd Strudwick's frustrated patriarch.\n\nThe Technicolour visuals are the biggest draw here alongside Aaron Copland's luscious musical score, it being unusual for a smaller studio like Republic Pictures to invest in such a…\n\nPeter Miles plays a lonely farm boy who takes refuge from his squabbling parents in his love for a beautiful red foal. Also starring Robert Mitchum and Myrna Loy. Directed by Lewis Milestone.\n\nThe Red Pony is adapted from the novel of the same name by John Steinbeck, which was published 12 years earlier – and the final product is a good one.\n\nSet in the Salinas Valley of California, juvenile Tom Tiflin (Peter Miles) exists on his family’s farm with his parents, Fred (Shepperd Strudwick) and Alice (Myrna Loy), who are continuously at odds, and with his confused grandfather (Louis Calhern).\n\nApprehending Tom’s respect, however, is the appointed ranch hand, Billy Buck (Robert Mitchum), an esteemed horse veteran. As…\n\nDamn, this family keeps sassing the hell out of one another and for what? The dad sassed the grandpa and left, then the grandpa sassed the mom for the dad’s leaving.\n\nThis family needs a therapist.\n\nAnd jeez, I wasn’t prepared for a horse tracheotomy.\n\nTHE RED PONY is derived from the amalgamated scatterings of Steinbeck novellas and plays exactly how you'd expect it to -- a meditation on morals and masculinity set in the rolling, rural hills of the Salinas Valley. It's prosaic and simple, but at times deeply profound with its ruminations on life, death, and the dualistic fragility and stoicism inherent to human nature.\n\nThe film operates around five main characters (excluding the titular horse) that comprise a pretty vivid (and surprisingly melodramatic) household. There's the main kid, of course, whose parents are seemingly on the brink of estrangement. Then, grandpa makes his arrival, full of cyclical harangues singing the praise of his old glory days trekking out west. The most grounded…"
