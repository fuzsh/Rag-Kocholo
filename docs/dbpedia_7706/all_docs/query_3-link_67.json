        "text": "Criterion Collection Spine #847\n\n\"People are being cheated, robbed, murdered, raped. And that goes on 24 hours a day, every day in the year ... But suppose we had no police force, good or bad. Suppose we had ... just silence. Nobody to listen, nobody to answer. The battle's finished. The jungle wins. The predatory beasts take over.\"\n\nI was going to tease that this was just the American remake of 'Rififi', but it might be the other way around since this came out 5 years earlier. The Asphalt Jungle is pretty much your standard heist flick, but I suppose it should be given credit for being one of the early entries in the genre with great performances, and the…\n\nwe are all human, so why are some of us seen as though we are not so?\n\nin a film that seems like a oh-so-subtle takedown of the stereotypical convention of ‘male-immortality’ in the face of extreme, gangster-related danger, Huston manages to create a perfect masterpiece for Hollywood’s golden age.\n\nsometimes, at least for me anyway, things just feel as though they’re just not going your way. no matter how hard you try, anything you do will never seem as though it is enough for those around you, it will seem as though you’d be better off being dead rather than wallowing around in desperate attempts to please.\n\nthe sadness that pursues from this alone can feel all too much…\n\nThe Asphalt Jungle is a very harsh noir drama that describes in minute detail a jewelry heist and the subsequent double games between the participants. It is remarkable for the psychological analysis of the characters and for the realistic description of the environment of the urban underworld. John Huston realizes a story of greed, paranoia and bad luck, wrapped in the night of an alienating and corrupt metropolis. Central part of the plot, the city is represented as an oppressive space that nullifies any desire to escape and prevents the protagonists' dreams from materializing. In addition to Huston's talent, the great result of the film is due to the quality of the novel from which it is based. William R.…\n\nAn ensemble cast including Sterling Hayden, Louis Calhern, Jean Hagen and Sam Jaffe (with an early appearance from Marilyn Monroe) star in a noir from John Huston about the lead-up, execution and aftermath of a jewel robbery by a group of veteran criminals.\n\nReleased at the very beginning of the decade, this crystallised the heist genre into the form we know it today; in much the same way that The Maltese Falcon didn’t invent private eye movies there were lots of other films that had focused on robberies before, but it’s here that Huston set the rules and laid the groundwork for countless stories to come in his tale of an intricate theft that bit-by-bit goes drastically wrong for those…\n\nI have to admit that I was a bit predisposed to like this movie, I might say even giddy. It stars Sterling Hayden, and he plays two of my favourite characters in two of my favourite films; The Killing, and Dr. Strangelove. While it could be argued, successfully, that he plays the same character every time, I don’t really care. I just love his no nonsense tough guy delivery. Probably even more than James Cagney or Humphrey Bogart.\n\nThe first thing that struck me was the absence of score. Beyond the opening, there is none. The second thing that struck me was the sumptuous cinematography. This is a master plying his trade. This is the best looking and photographed Noir…\n\n62/100\n\nAnother semi-casualty (I do still like it) of my taste gradually evolving away from movies that are 95% plot. Hard to miss the theme, of course—Huston might as well have written it out in big flashing letters, Noé-style: LE HASARD DÉTRUIT TOUT—and Sam Jaffe's jukebox scene near the end encapsulates it beautifully (while also providing a proto-R&B erotic charge that even Marilyn Monroe* can't match). Other than that, though, spikes on the emotional EKG are few and far between; the two most poignant moments—Jean Hagen's heartbreakingly hopeful expression when Dix calls Doll back after she leaves his apartment, and Emmerich's wife hastily brushing her hair when she hears him returning to finish their card game—both involve women who are…\n\n\"After all, crime is only a left handed form of human endeavor\"\n\nThe Art of the Caper is simply Sterling Hayden squinting and glaring, his voice growling as though it were soaked in bourbon and rolled in tobacco.\n\nYet, W.R. Burnett's novel is adaptated here into something much more than just a caper. It's a crime story that's a heist picture, that's a character melodrama, that has a noir sensibility because it seeks out the dark side of town just as much as it seems out the dark side of its characters. John Huston knew how to make an exciting picture and here he gave us somehow one of his of his most undervalued films simply in the way the…"
