        "text": "The Oscar winner for best picture of 1930, Lewis Milestone’s “All Quiet on the Western Front,” established the template for many of the Oscar winners in the years since. Based on an internationally best-selling novel by Erich Maria Remarque, adapted to the screen by a variety of literary and theatrical figures, including Maxwell Anderson and George Abbott, and directed by Mr. Milestone with a firm finger constantly underlining the antiwar message, “All Quiet” is a model of Oscar seriousness. And because it tells the story of a brutal war from the point of view of the enemy, the film has been evoked by more than one contemporary Oscar pundit as proof that Clint Eastwood’s “Letters From Iwo Jima” stands a chance in this year’s best-picture race.\n\nUniversal issued a disappointing disc of “All Quiet” some years ago, but now the title is back in a technically impeccable transfer taken from the restoration by the Library of Congress. It is still not a great movie, marked as it is by heavy-handedness and a wandering, anecdotal structure, but it certainly looks and sounds better than it has in living memory.\n\nUnlike Mr. Eastwood’s characters, Mr. Milestone’s look and talk like Americans, from the feckless high school student Paul Bäumer (Lewis Ayres), who enlists during the first days of patriotic fever, to the gruff but lovable veteran sergeant (Louis Wolheim, his New York accent undisguised) who leads his innocent charges through the inferno of trench warfare.\n\nMr. Milestone remains what contemporary Hollywood calls a “run and gun” director, who brings a maximum amount of energy and technique to every scene regardless of its position in the overall narrative structure. But some of his gunning is spectacularly creative, like the early shot that begins with the residents of Paul’s small town filling the streets in a patriotic frenzy, then pulls back through an open window into the classroom where Paul’s teacher is filling his students’ heads with dangerous notions of honor and glory.\n\nThe festivities continue behind them, still visible through the windows that frame the professor’s blackboard. According to official Hollywood history, this is the kind of deep-focus shot that wouldn’t be invented until “Citizen Kane,” but Mr. Milestone was hardly alone in using such radical stylistic figures in the early, anything-goes years of the talking film.\n\n“All Quiet” is one of four titles that Universal Studios Home Entertainment is releasing today as part of a new Cinema Classics line, which seems to be meant as a challenge to the prestige productions of the Criterion Collection and Warner Home Video. The transfers of the other three films — William Wyler’s elegant, underplayed Jamesian melodrama, “The Heiress” (1949); Leo McCarey’s extreme exercise in Irish sentimentality, “Going My Way” (1944); and John Rawlins’s opera buffa version of the “Arabian Nights” (1942) — reveal the same care.\n\n“Arabian Nights,” which was Universal’s first film in three-strip Technicolor, is a burlesque that leans heavily on the far more dashing and atmospheric “Thief of Bagdad” (1940), produced by Alexander Korda. The self-conscious camp of “Arabian Nights” wanes in comparison with the straight-faced absurdity of future Universal Technicolor extravaganzas like “White Savage” (1943) and “Cobra Woman” (1944); like those two films, “Nights” stars the ravishing and utterly humorless Maria Montez, the only person involved in the production who does not seem to be in on the joke. In any case, the color registration is perfect, the tones are correctly muted, and the image is sharp and detailed without any obvious digital manipulation.\n\nThe Cinema Classics line comes with no extras other than introductions from the Turner Classic Movies host Robert Osborne and the original theatrical trailers, but at these low prices, the bells and whistles will not be missed. Universal Studios Home Entertainment, $14.98 each, not rated.\n\nALFRED HITCHCOCK\n\n3 Disc Collector’s Edition\n\nIt’s always a happy day when an orphan film is adopted by a major company, and that’s what happened in 2005 when the French conglomerate Canal Plus managed to recover the rights to several of the early British films of Alfred Hitchcock: minor but historically important works that had been circulating only in genuinely awful public-domain prints. The American company Lionsgate has now licensed five of the Canal Plus Hitchcocks and issued them in a bare-bones, three-disc set. Though the supplementary material of the French editions is missing (the alternative ending of “Murder!,” the introductions by the critic Noël Simsolo, the still galleries), the transfers appear to be identical, which is to say, vastly better than anything currently on the market.\n\nThe most important film among these early efforts is “Rich and Strange” (1931), a cautionary tale about a middle-class couple who try to relieve the boredom of their existence by taking a trip, physically and sexually adventurous, to the Far East. Structurally, the film looks forward to Hitchcock’s later series of couples films, including “Mr. and Mrs. Smith” (1941), “The Man Who Knew Too Much” (1956) and “Marnie” (1964), in which mere marriages are transformed into sacred unions through the shared experience of suffering and temptation.\n\nBut the real Hitchcock fan will also be intrigued by the atypical, nonsuspense films that Hitchcock directed before his brand name had completely come together. “The Skin Game,” released the same year as “Rich and Strange,” is introduced with a title card that reads “A Talking Film by John Galsworthy,” and follows the stolid dramaturgy and class-warfare themes dear to the author of “The Forsyte Saga.”\n\nIt is fascinating to see Hitchcock directing the most prosaic dialogue sequences without any recourse to creative cutting or camera angles; he is there to play by the rules, and, contrary to his reputation, he is fine enough a director of actors to win the game. There is a palpable tension between the story by the aristocratic Galsworthy, who plainly identifies with the upper-class Hillcrists, and the direction of the cockney Hitchcock, who casts his lot with the lower-class real estate developer (played by Edmund Gwenn) who wants to engulf and devour the Hillcrists’ estate and way of life.\n\nThe other films in the Lionsgate box are “The Ring” (1927), the rural drama “The Manxman” (1929) and the backstage mystery “Murder!” (1930). That leaves five more titles from the Canal Plus collection — “Champagne” (1928), “The Farmer’s Wife” (1928), “Blackmail” (1929), “Number 17” (1932) and “Foreign Correspondent” (1940) — along with the fervent hope that a second volume is on the way. Lionsgate, $39.98, not rated.\n\nALSO OUT TODAY\n\nFLAGS OF OUR FATHERS The first panel of Clint Eastwood’s Iwo Jima diptych, starring Ryan Phillippe and Adam Beach.
