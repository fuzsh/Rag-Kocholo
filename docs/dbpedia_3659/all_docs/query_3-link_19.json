        "text": "This post may contain affiliate links\n\nIf you are a fan of the master of suspense, Alfred Hitchcock, you need to see these classic James Stewart Hitchcock films.\n\nHow many Hitchcock films was James Stewart In?\n\nJames Stewart collaborated with Alfred Hitchcock on 4 films over a period of 10 years. The 4 films are:\n\nThe Rope (1948)\n\nRear Window (1954)\n\nThe Man Who Knew Too Much (1956)\n\nVertigo (1958)\n\nTwo of these James Stewart Hitchcock films really stand out as being better than the others: Rear Window, and of course, Vertigo.\n\nThe Rope is like a play, with the entire movie taking place in one room, similar to other Hitchcock movies like Rear Window and Dial M for Murder, but The Rope doesn’t have the same dynamic as Rear Window and Dial M for Murder.\n\n(Of course having Grace Kelly as the star in those two films doesn’t hurt any!)\n\nJames Stewart Hitchcock Films #1: The Rope\n\nThe first James Stewart Hitchcock Film is the 1948 movie the Rope.\n\nThe movie centers around two men who believe they have pulled off the perfect murder.\n\nThey strangle a man with—you guessed it—a rope, then hide his body and proceed to throw a dinner party in the same room with the body, confident they have pulled off the perfect crime.\n\nOf course what they didn’t count on was James Stewart showing up and questioning things.\n\nIf you’re new to Hitchcock films, this isn’t one I would recommend to start with as it feels very “stage-like” and really isn’t the best James Stewart Hitchcock film to start with.\n\nJames Stewart Hitchcock Films #2: Rear Window\n\nThe second James Stewart Hitchcock Film is Rear Window.\n\nAlso starring alongside James Stewart is the gorgeous Grace Kelly and Raymond Burr.\n\nRear Window also feels a bit like a stage play, but if you can get past the first 30 minutes which are very slow, then the suspense gradually begins to build and you can see why it is such a stylish classic.\n\nThe movie centers around Jeff (James Stewart) who is wheel-chair bound after a photography accident.\n\nSince he’s stuck at home and doesn’t have anything else to do, he fills his time by spying on the neighbors from his window.\n\nHis girlfriend Lisa (Grace Kelly) comes over in the evenings after work and together the two of them piece together a murder that happened in the neighbor’s apartment.\n\nOther posts you might like:\n\nGrace Kelly Rear Window - the Wardrobe Fit for a Princess\n\n3 Insanely Chic Ways to copy Grace Kelly Rear Window Jeans Outfit\n\nJames Stewart Hitchcock Films #3: The Man Who Knew Too Much\n\nThe third James Stewart Hitchcock Film is The Man who knew too Much with Doris Day as as James Stewart’s co-star.\n\nThis film is basically a re-make of an earlier film that Hitchcock made 20 years earlier by the same name, The Man Who Knew Too Much (1934) but the earlier film starred Peter Lorre and Leslie Banks.\n\nIn our opinion this is probably only the third best James Stewart Hitchcock film, trailing behind Vertigo and Rear Window.\n\nJames Stewart Hitchcock Films #4: Vertigo\n\nApparently in this case, Hitchcock believed in saving the best for last….drumroll!\n\nThe final James Stewart Hitchcock film is the best and maybe Hitchcock’s best film: Vertigo, with Kim Novak and James Stewart’s co-star and love interest.\n\nAlthough the film is riddled with plot holes, and is slow to get started, it still comes together as a great haunting, suspenseful, romance.\n\nThe movie was actually quite the flop when it was first released, but now it is considered to be one of Hitchcock’s best films.\n\nHighly recommend!\n\nOther posts you might like:\n\nVertigo Plot Holes — and did Judy commit suicide in the end?"
