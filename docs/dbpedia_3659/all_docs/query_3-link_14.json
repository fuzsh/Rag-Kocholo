        "text": "“In many of the films now being made, there is very little cinema: they are mostly what I call ‘photographs of people talking.’ When we tell a story in cinema we should resort to dialogue only when it’s impossible to do otherwise. I always try to tell a story in the cinematic way, through a succession of shots and bits of film in between.”\n\n—Alfred Hitchcock\n\nNothing quite ushers in the holidays like the films of Alfred Hitchcock. I’m a big fan of The Criterion Channel and this month they are running 21 Hitchcock movies. While this includes some classics (Vertigo, Rope, Lifeboat) it also includes some of his lesser known silent film work (The Lodger, Downhill).\n\nIt’s easy to look at a masterpiece like North by Northwest (1959) and miss that Hitchcock was 60 when that film was released. Like everyone else had to learn to be a filmmaker. If you look back on his early 20s you begin to see how he evolved as a filmmaker. He loved watching movies as a kid, but being a filmmaker wasn’t on his radar. He studied engineering and through his skills as a draftsman, started doing some side work title design work and art directing on two reeler silent movies.\n\nIt was while working with the Famous Players—Lasky in London where he says he learned screenwriting from ”some middle-aged ladies.” Mix that with his appreciation of the silent films by Chaplin, Keaton, and D.W. Griffith and he was prepared to start directing himself. Perhaps the real take away for the young filmmaker/content creator today watching Hitchcock’s British-era films is to see how he engineered his shot selection. Working with film and lower budgets in his early days forced him to think though where he was going to place the camera for maximum impact.\n\nOscar-winning writer/ director Guillermo del Toro (The Shape of Water) was greatly influenced by Hitchcock and only started his featuring film directing career after a three year study of the films by the master of suspense. Here’s what he had to say about The Man Who Knew Too Much (which is also available on The Criterion Channel this month).\n\nScott W. Smith is the author of Screenwriting with Brass Knuckles\n\nRead Full Post »\n\n“The perfect movie doesn’t have any dialogue. So you should always be striving to make a silent movie.”\n\nDavid Mamet\n\nOn Film Directing\n\n“One of my notions [in making Mad Max] was that if I make the action sequences as a silent movie, and it reads as a silent movie, then it can only get better with sound.”\n\nMad Max director/co-writer George Miller\n\nToday is the last day of a month of posts centered around filmmaker Robert Rodriguez (with help from a few of his director friends and acquaintances). And we end with the bang looking at the journey of George Miller, the 70-year-old director of Mad Max: Fury Road (2015) who not only started working with an unusual career for a film director (medical doctor), but was raised in an unlikely place (Chinchilla, Queensland, Australia—population 5,000 today).\n\n“I grew up in a remote, rural town in the Outback of Australia. And there was no television then. There was a Saturday matinée and there were comics. And I grew up with brothers and we’d play out what we saw in movies and the comics. It was an invisible apprenticeship to make movies. I’d read American Cinematographer magazines and we’d scrutinize them about, and go, ‘Oh, that’s how they did the car rigging,’ and anything Hitchcock said became a little dictum. I learned where I think we should all learn— in the cinema. I just consumed everything…The big influence on me was Buster Keaton because cinema—the silent era—they were able to do things you could see nowhere else. It wasn’t a recording device, it was actually creating a language. And I suddenly thought, wow, this is amazing.”\n\nProducer/writer/director George Miller\n\nThe Director’s Chair with Robert Rodriguez interview\n\n(On the El Rey Network and available on iTunes)\n\nWhile in medical school he entered a one-minute silent film contest with his brother which led to winning the competition and both attending a filmmaking workshop. Within ten years he made his debut feature film Max Max starring Mel Gibson.\n\nTwo remarkable things about that low-budget feature is its strong action photography (shot by director of photography Dean Semler and the lack of dialogue by Gibson. (Under 20 lines of dialogue in the entire film for the lead role.)\n\nMiller told Rodriguez of Mad Max, “I definitely had the Hitchcock dictum in my head, he said, ‘I try to make movies where they don’t have to read the subtitles in Japan.’ And as it turned out, the Japanese took to it.” (It’s important to remember that while Alfred Hitchcock is known for his classic films Psycho (1960), North By Northwest (1959), and Vertigo (1958), that he actually began making films in the early 1920s— in the silent era of movies. Read Hitchcock Loved ‘The Hurt Locker’ to see some of his takeaways of visual storytelling.)\n\nAs the global market today is more important than ever in the Hollywood film industry, there is much to learn from Hitchcock about visual storytelling. As well as from another director who bridged the silent era into “the talkies” with great effectiveness—John Ford. He also informed Miller’s visual style. In fact, the Mad Max movies have been called “Westerns on wheels.” Watch an action scene from Stagecoach (1939) and compare any of the four Mad Max films. (By the way, Orson Welles watched Stagecoach 40 times before making Citizen Kane.)\n\nOne of my all time favorite movie entrances by a character is in Mad Max 2:The Road Warrior. The surprise intro of Gyro Captian doesn’t quite have the same impact on DVD or You Tube as it did on the big screen when I first saw it, but here’s a clip of it I found online:\n\nHere’s the dynamic character intro of John Wayne in John Ford’s Stagecoach.\n\nThe movie Ben Hur (1959) also informed Miller’s visual style.\n\nAnd lastly, to show the diversity of Miller, he directed Lorenzo’s Oil, and was the one responsible for bringing prolific author Dick King-Smith’s Babe to the movies, and he won his sole Oscar for his 2006 animated feature Happy Feet. When asked the connection between Babe, Happy Feet, and Mad Max. Miller said they all follow the classic hero-myth story.\n\nThe real inspiration from Miller is if you’re from a remote, rural town in the Outback or a farm in Iowa, if you’re closer to 7 or 70, or if you just graduated from medical school or grammar school— some interesting things can happen if you take that first step and make a one-minute movie. (Start Small…but Start Somewhere.) For Miller, it eventually led him down Fury Road.\n\n“George and Brendan McCarthy and a couple of other storyboard artists basically wrote [Mad Max: Fury Road] in storyboards.”\n\nColin Gibson\n\nProduction Designer\n\n“There were 3,500 [storyboard] panels around the room and I would say a good 80% of those panels are reflected in the images that you see on the screen today…It was something that was very non-verbal. People obviously speak in the movie, but they speak only when it’s necessary.”\n\nGeorge Miller\n\nP.S. If you can combine classical mythical storytelling with classical silent movie visual storytelling you will be tapping into powerful stuff. Two core books on the mythical journey are Joseph Campbell’s The Hero with a Thousand Faces and Christopher Vogler’s The Writer’s Journey.\n\n10/8/14 Update:\n\nHere’s a video from the post The Editing of Mad Max: Fury Road by Vashi Nedomansky where he explains how Miller, DP John Seale, and editor Margaret Sixel used a “crosshair framing” or “center framed” technique in Mad Max: Fury Road so the quick cutting action would be visually friendly for audiences.\n\nAlso, it appears that later in the day after wrote this post that George Miller did a live stream Q&A with Michael Radford after a screening of Mad Max:Fury Road. So if you haven’t had your George Miller fill yet the Q&A begins at the 5:04 mark:\n\nRelated posts:\n\n‘Storytelling Without Dialogue’ (Tip #82)\n\nThe Best Film School\n\nMr. Silent Films\n\nProfessor Jerry Lewis (Great Filmmakers)\n\nHarold Loyd vs. Buster Keaton\n\nEmotionally Silent Dialogue\n\nDirecting Tips from Peter Bogdanovich “Silent looks between people—to me, that’s what movies are about.”—Peter Bogdanovich\n\nShow, Don’t Tell (Tip #46) “One of the cardinal sins for a scriptwriter, when he runs into some difficulty, is to say ‘We can cover that by a line of dialogue.”—Hitchcock\n\nShow, Don’t Tell (Part 2)—Chaplin\n\nScott W.

Think of the stories you have encountered where we, the audience, are aware of circumstances of which of the onstage characters are ignorant and are thus kept in a state of ‘anticipation mingled with uncertainty’ as we wait for some turn of events (peripeteia*) in which the suspenseful situation is resolved. Can you think of any dramatic work that does not make use of this structure, however indirectly? It seems to me that as students’ projects are offered to me, it is the absence of clearly structured dramatic irony (especially in visual terms) that is their weakness. There is a sense in which the most basic elements of film grammar have potential for dramatic irony…As you explore some of the great classics of stage and screen, you will see that most have a ‘bomb under the table.'”\n\nAlexander Mackendrick (Former director—Sweet Smell of Success—and one time dean of California Institute of the Arts)\n\nOn Film-making: An Introduction to the Craft of the Director\n\nPages 93-94\n\nP.S. “The bomb under the table” is a famous Hitchcock illustration found in the above video, and in the Francis Truffaut book Hitchcock.\n\n*Peripeteia: a sudden or unexpected reversal of circumstances or situation especially in a literary work (Merriam-Webster)\n\nRelated post:\n\nIrony in Movies (Tip #79)\n\nIrony Playground\n\nDramatic Irony (Ibsen & Shakespeare)\n\nDramatic Irony (Paul Lucey)\n\nTicking Clock (Tip #103)\n\nScott W.

When Alfred Hitchcock used coincidence in The Birds he didn’t try to hide it or underscore it in any way. Heck, he highlighted it in a key part of the script and then used it as an expositional dump.\n\nHere’s the crazy thing, he pulled it off like the theft of a car in front of a police station. I guess when you’re known as the master of suspense you can pull off things that mere mortals can’t.\n\nThe scene in question is in the restaurant after children have been attacked by birds at the school yard. For some reason there just happens to be a woman at the restaurant who at the right moment overhears a conversation about birds and says “Ornithology happens to be my avocation.” (Ornithology being the study of birds.)\n\nSpielberg and his writing team handled this much better in JAWS when a shark expert (Richard Dreyfuss) is drawn to the town because of the shark attack of the girl on the beach. He didn’t just happen to be there. So he becomes the perfect person to explain shark behavior to the others in the film (and that is how the audience is also informed).\n\nBut Hitchcock just has a lady buying a pack of cigarettes in a restaurant just happen to be a bird expert. Granted she does say avocation rather than vocation, but still. Keep in mind that The Birds was made after Vertigo, North by Northwest and Psycho.\n\nSeems like I recall Hitchcock once being asked about why the bird expert was there and his response was in line with he thought it would be a fun break between all of the suspense activity, and that people wouldn’t notice. (If I can find that quote I will post it later. And if you find that exchange post it in the comments and I’ll add it here.)\n\nGuess the key lesson learned there is if you do use coincidence (on top of an expositional dump) make sure the rest of your film is good enough that no one notices or cares.\n\nP.S. A fun Hitchcock fact via his daughter Patricia; A couple of Alfred Hitchock’s guilty pleasures were two films from the 70s— Benji and Smokey and the Bandit.\n\nRelated Posts:\n\nScreenwriting & Exposition (Tip#10)\n\nCary Grant & Exposition (Tip #38)\n\nScott W.

Several different TV versions of the play have been done and it was the basis for the 1998 film A Perfect Murder starring Michael Douglas and Gwyneth Paltrow. Here’s an exchange from the ’54 version—directed by Hitchcock— between Tony (Ray Milland), Mary (Grace Kelly), and Mark (Robert Cummings).\n\nTony: How do you go about writing a detective story?\n\nMark: Well, you forget detection and concentrate on crime. Crime’s the thing. And then you imagine you’re going to steal something or murder somebody.\n\nTony: Oh, is that how you do it? Interesting.\n\nMark: Yes, I usually put myself in the criminal’s shoes and then I keep asking myself, “what do I do next?”\n\nMary Do you really believe in the perfect murder?\n\nMark: Yes, absolutely. On paper that is. And I think I could plan one better than most people but I doubt if I could carry it out.\n\nTony: Why not?\n\nMark: Well because in stories things usually turn out the way the author wants them to and in real life the don’t always. No, I’m afraid my murders would be something like my bridge, I’d make some stupid mistake but not realize it until everybody was looking at me.\n\nFor low-budget filmmakers, Hitchcock’s Dial M for Murder is an excellent film to study because most of it takes place in one apartment. Hitchcock said filmmakers often go wrong when they try to “open up” a play by adding exterior scenes and business. Hitchcock, of course, embraced limitations of locations in shooting Rope, Rear Window and Lifeboat. (One could imagine Hitchcock watching Buried (which takes place in a coffin) and thinking, “Now why didn’t I think of that?”\n\nOne of Hitchcock’s trademarks in many of his classic films his visual storytelling. But Dial M for Murder is dialogue driven. It’s more intellectually based than the emotional films such as Birds, Psycho and North by Northwest. Francis Truffaut remarked to Hitchcock that he took something that’s hard to do and somehow made it look easy:\n\n“I just did my job, using cinematic means to narrate a story taken from a stage play. All of the action in Dial M for Murder takes place in a living room, but that doesn’t matter. I could just as well have shot the whole film in a phone booth. Let’s imagine there’s a coupe in that booth. Their hands are touching, their lips meet, and accidentally one of them leans against the receiver, knocking it off the hook. Now, while they’re unaware of it, the phone operator can listen in on their intimate conversation. The drama has taken a step forward. For the audience, looking at the images, it should be the same as the reading the opening paragraphs of a novel or hearing the expositional dialogue of the stage play. You might say that the film-maker can use a telephone booth pretty much in the same way a novelist uses a blank piece of paper.”\n\nAlfred Hitchcock\n\nTruffaut/Hitchcock\n\nDial M for Murder was also filmmed in 3-D.\n\nScott W. Smith\n\nRead Full Post »\n\nHitchcock loved The Hurt Locker? As in Alfred Hitchcock? Really? Hasn’t he been dead for like 30 years? Yes, I guess I should have said that “Hitchcock would have loved The Hurt Locker”—but that’s a long title, and less interesting. So why do I think the master of suspense and a psychological thrillers would have appreciated the film that picked up the best picture Oscar Sunday?\n\nWell, in part because The Hurt Locker was suspenseful and psychological. But there are three other reasons that come to mind of why I think director Kathryn Bigelow and screenwriter Mark Boal tapped into the Hitchcock creative mindset as filmmakers.\n\n1) Hitchcock said that the difference between shock and suspense was the difference between having a bomb suddenly going off surprising the audience (shock) and the audience seeing that there is a bomb under a table with a timer ticking down (suspense). The later being able to hold your attention for a long time no matter what the conversation is above the table. Bigelow and her editors knew they didn’t need to rush certain scenes and used the built in suspense to their advantage.\n\n2) Little dialogue/strong visuals—Hitchcock came from the world of silent films and believed you only used words when the visuals didn’t tell the story. (Watch Psycho, North by Northwest, Vertigo, and The Birds to see excellent examples.) Bigelow studied painting before she became a filmmaker and The Hurt Locker is strong on visuals. Hitchcock embraced simplicity at times sometimes using little or no sound effects. Sometimes pulling the effects and music altogether for a dramatic effect. I’ve only seen The Hurt Locker once so far but I seem to recall the music and effects track being spartan at times. I’m sure much effort went into the sound design of The Hurt Locker but it didn’t overpower the track and at times seemed to be just actor Jeremy Renner breathing in his protective suit.\n\n3) Hitchcock didn’t care about reality. There have been a few articles about how some bomb experts in Iraq don’t feel like the film was realistic. One used the words “grossly exaggerated.” Bigelow wasn’t making a documentary. She was making a movie. And movies as I learned in film school are “heightened reality.” Some cops never shoot their gun in their whole career, but that tends not to make for good drama. Hitchcock didn’t worry about reality and I’ll let him explain his reasoning, after all he’s the guy who had a chase scene on top of Mount Rushmore, a killing inside the UN building, as well as many other “grossly exaggerated” situations;\n\n“To insist that a storyteller stick to the facts is just as ridiculous as to demand of a representative painter that he show objects accurately…We should have total freedom to do as we like, just so long as it’s not dull. A critic who talks to me about plausibility is a dull fellow…I don’t want to film a ‘slice of life’ because people can get that at home, in the street, or even in front of the movie theater. They don’t have to pay money to see a slice of life. And I avoid out-and-out fantasy because people should be able to identify with the characters. Making a film means, first of all, to tell a story. That story should never be banal. It must be dramatic and human. What is drama, after all, but life with the dull bits cut out.”\n\nAlfred Hitchcock\n\nHitchcock: The Definitive Study of Alfred Hitchcock by Truffaut\n\nOf course, the military leadership has to go on record saying that they aren’t looking for lone-ranger, hotshot cowboys on their bomb squads. And they probably don’t. But I image they realize this will do a little for recruiting what the cocky, hotshot pilot Tom Cruise and Top Gun did back for Navy recruiting in the 80s. Bigalow and Boal have made rock stars of guys that risk their life to defuse bombs. (I read one reviewer who went as far as to say the movie felt like an Army recruitment film.) The movie hasn’t been seen any where near as much as Top Gun and flying a jet plane seems a little more glamorous, but I think that bomb disposal experts should be sending thank you notes to Bigelow and Boals because they have brought dignity and awareness to a job most Americans knew little about.\n\nAnd if any bomb disposal experts in Iraq or Afghanistan read this, thank you for what you’re doing. I hope you come home safely soon.\n\nAnd congrats to Bigelow and the whole Hurt Locker crew on the Oscar wins.\n\nRelated post: Pandora vs. Baghdad\n\nScott W. Smith\n\nRead Full Post »"
