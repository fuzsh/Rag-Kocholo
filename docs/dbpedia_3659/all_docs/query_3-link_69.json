        "text": "Welcome!\n\nWelcome to the Playhouse Mobile Unit’s 2023 production of Scaredy Kat Presents by Janine Sobeck Knighton. It is our hope that this study guide enhances your experience before, during and after you see the show!\n\nIf you have other questions, that are not answered in the guide, please feel free to reach out to us. We are here to make sure you have an enriching and positive experience at the show. Email our Director of Education, Jenny Nelson, at jnelson@westportplayhouse.org, and she’ll be happy to answer your questions.\n\nAbout the Playhouse Mobile Unit\n\nTheater belongs to everyone. At the Playhouse, we believe that theater is not just a physical space. It is something much more than brick and mortar. Through theater, we make connections and open ourselves to new possibilities. We believe theater can happen anywhere and should be accessible to all. Specifically designed to be adaptable and accommodate any type of indoor space, the Playhouse Mobile Unit (PMU) is a fully-staged play that will travel to you for a live theatrical performance. It is our hope to bring live theater into our community for years to come.\n\nWHAT WE BELIEVE\n\nLand Acknowledgement\n\nThe Playhouse sits on land once forcibly taken from the Paugussett people. The Westport Country Playhouse acknowledges the indigenous peoples and nations of the Paugussett that stewarded the land and waterways of Westport, Connecticut. We honor and respect the enduring relationship that exists between these peoples and nations and this land.\n\nAnti-Racism Statement of Purpose\n\nWe resolve to place anti-racism at the center of our work. We are committed to holding ourselves accountable to short-and long-term goals, while realizing that this work has no endpoint and will evolve and change. We realize and acknowledge that this is an educational process for which we ourselves are responsible.\n\n.Spotlight on Alfred Hitchcock\n\nAlfred Hitchcock was born in Leytonstone, England on August 13, 1899. He was the youngest of three children born to William and Emma Jane Hitchcock.\n\nAfter attending a technical school at 15, Hitchcock spent the first years of his career as a draftsman, advertising designer, and writer. An interest in photography led to him working in London’s film industry, first as a title card designer for silent movies and, just five years later, as a director.\n\nIn 1926, Hitchcock married his assistant director, Alma Reville, and in 1928 they had a daughter, Patricia.\n\nHitchcock quickly gained notoriety as a director who delivered suspense, twist endings, and dark subject matter. His own personality and dark humor were embedded in popular culture through interviews, film trailers, and cameo appearances in his own films. He was popular with audiences at home and abroad, and in 1939 the Hitchcock family moved to Hollywood. In the three decades that followed he would cement his legacy by directing and producing his most successful and enduring works. His television anthology, Alfred Hitchcock Presents, ran from 1955 to 1965 and made him a household name.\n\nDuring his career, he created over fifty feature films in a career that saw not only the development of Hitchcock’s own distinctive directorial style, but also landmark innovations in cinema. In 1929, Blackmail was his first feature film with sound and in 1948, his first color film was Rope. Hitchcock himself has been credited with pioneering many camera and editing techniques for peers and aspiring directors to emulate.\n\nHitchcock collected many professional accolades including two Golden Globes, eight Laurel Awards, and five lifetime achievement awards. He was a five-time Academy Award nominee for Best Director and in 1940, his film Rebecca won the Oscar for Best Picture. In 1980, he received a knighthood from Queen Elizabeth II.\n\nA husband, father, director, and the Master of Suspense, Sir Alfred Hitchcock passed away on April 29, 1980.\n\nSource material: http://www.alfredhitchcock.com/\n\nEXTENSION ACTIVITIES\n\nBreathing exercises (source: uhs.berkeley.edu/bewellatwork)\n\nBreathing Breaks\n\nSeveral times a day, take breathing breaks to help refresh your energy, let go of distractions, and increase focus. Stand and take a deep breath while you raise your arms slowly over your head. Exhale as you lower your arms. Repeat 3 times.\n\nPaced Breathing\n\nPaced Breathing is a technique that can help to relieve stress or anxiety. To begin, take a normal breath and then take a deep breath. Breathe in slowly through your nose, letting your chest and lower belly expand. Breathe out slowly through your mouth. Then, we will begin counting out the breath. The basic technique is to inhale for a count of 4 seconds, hold your breath for 4 seconds and exhale for a count of 4 seconds. As you exhale, make a “swoosh” sound. If your mind wanders, gently redirect your focus back to counting and breathing.\n\nMeditation\n\nWhat is meditation? Meditation is to engage in reflection for the purpose of reaching a heightened level of awareness. Meditation has been shown to improve sleep, reduce stress and promote an overall sense of well-being. So, what is guided meditation? It is meditation with the help of a guide or teacher. Guided meditation can be a great way to start meditating. Simply listen to the guide/teacher and follow their prompts. That’s all there is to it.\n\nWant to try to meditate?
