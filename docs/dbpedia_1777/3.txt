U.S. Maj. Gen. Charles H. Swannack Jr. visits the Iraqi hydro-electric power station in Haditha, 200 km (136 miles), northwest of Baghdad, in this Wednesday, Nov. 19, 2003 photo. Swannack is among a growing number of commanders who served under Donald Rumsfeld who say he has botched the Iraq operation, ignored the advice of his generals and should be replaced. Swannack told CNN on Thursday, April 13, 2006 that Rumsfeld micromanaged the war. (AP Photo/Anja Niedringhaus)
