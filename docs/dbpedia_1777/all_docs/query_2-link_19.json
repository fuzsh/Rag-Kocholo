        "text": "thedrifter\n\nA Letter to All Hands\n\nMarch 23, 2004\n\nThe First Marine Division recently returned to Iraq. This is a letter from the Commanding General of the Division to the Marines of the First Marine Division.\n\nLetter to all Hands:\n\nWe are going back in to the brawl. We will be relieving the magnificent Soldiers fighting under the 82nd Airborne Division, whose hard won successes in the Sunni Triangle have opened opportunities for us to exploit. For the last year, the 82nd Airborne has been operating against the heart of the enemy's resistance. It's appropriate that we relieve them.\n\nWhen it's time to move a piano, Marines don't pick up the piano bench- we move the piano. So, this is the right place for Marines in this fight, where we can carry on the legacy of Chesty Puller in the Banana Wars in the same sort of complex environment that he knew in his early years. Shoulder to shoulder with our comrades in the Army, Coalition Forces and maturing Iraqi Security Forces, we are going to destroy the enemy with precise firepower while diminishing the conditions that create adversarial relationships between us and the Iraqi people.\n\nThis is going to be hard, dangerous work. It is going to require patient, persistent presence. Using our individual initiative, courage, moral judgment and battle skills, we will build on the 82nd Airborne's victories.\n\nOur country is counting on us even as our enemies watch and calculate, hoping that America does not have warriors strong enough to withstand discomfort and danger. You, my fine young men, are going to prove the enemy wrong - dead wrong. You will demonstrate the same uncompromising spirit that has always caused the enemy to fear America's Marines.\n\nThe enemy will try to manipulate you into hating all Iraqis. Do not allow the enemy that victory. With strong discipline, solid faith, unwavering alertness, and undiminished chivalry to the innocent, we will carry out this mission. Remember, I have added, \"First, do no harm\" to our passwords of \"No Better Friend, No Worse Enemy.\" Keep your honor clean as we gain information about the enemy from the Iraqi people. Then, armed with that information and working in conjunction with fledging Iraqi Security Forces, we will move precisely against the enemy elements and crush them without harming the innocent.\n\nThis is our test - our Guadalcanal, our Chosin Reservoir, our Hue City. Fight with a happy heart and keep faith in your comrades and your unit. We must be under no illusions about the nature of the enemy and the dangers that lie ahead. Stay alert, take it all in stride, remain sturdy, and share your courage with each other and the world. You are going to write history, my fine young Sailors and Marines, so write it well.\n\nSemper Fidelis\n\nJ.M. Mattis\n\nMajor General U.S. Marines\n\nEllie\n\nthedrifter\n\n1st Marine Division colors fly again in Iraq\n\nSubmitted by: 1st Marine Division\n\nStory Identification Number: 20043239164\n\nStory by Cpl. Paula M. Fitzgerald\n\nCAMP BLUE DIAMOND, Iraq(Mar. 20, 2004) -- The scarlet and gold of 1st Marine Divisions colors was unfurled and a new page in the history book was begun as the Camp Pendleton, California-based unit relieved the Armys 82nd Airborne Division during a relief-in-place ceremony here March 20, 2004.\n\nMaj. Gen. James N. Mattis, 1st Marine Divisions commanding general, formally assumed responsibility of the Al Anbar and Northern Babil provinces from Army Maj. Gen. Charles H. Swannack Jr., 82nd Airborne Divisions commanding general. The relief-in-place ceremony was held at the divisions headquarters in Ar Ramadi, about a two-hour drive west of Baghdad.\n\nUsing our individual initiative, courage, moral judgment and battle skills, we will build on the 82nd Airbornes victories, said Mattis, who led the division during the fight to Baghdad and subsequent operations in southern Iraq last year. The soldiers with the 82nd Airborne have been magnificent.\n\nThe 18,000 soldiers of the 82nd Airborne Division making up Task Force All American, based out of Fort Bragg, N.C., served in Iraq since the middle of last year and accomplished a multitude of operational achievements.\n\nAccording to Swannack, the unit conducted nearly 600 company-size or larger operations resulting in the capture of more than 30 high-value enemy targets. The division also trained and equipped 10 Iraqi Border Police battalions, six Iraqi Civil Defense Corps battalions, and nearly 5,000 local policemen. Almost 24,000 jobs were created for the citizens here in order to ease chronic unemployment issues.\n\nThe soldiers of the 82nd Airborne along with our Iraqi partners have helped to shape Iraq into a sovereign country with strong economic growth, Swannack said. First Marine Division is just as committed to building on the relationship we have made with the Iraqis.\n\nAddressing the Iraqi leaders who attended the ceremony, Mattis added Marines have come to listen, to learn and to assist the people here, especially the civil defense and police warriors.\n\nHe reassured the audience of Iraqi government and military officials as well as sheiks and prominent civic officials that anyone who attempts to thwart 1st Marine Divisions plans to help the people here will pay severely.\n\nWorking in conjunction with fledgling Iraqi Security Forces, Mattis explained, we will move precisely against the enemy elements and crush them without harming the innocent.\n\nMost of the Marines from the Blue Diamond were here in 2003 during the war and are prepared for the challenges that lie ahead.\n\nMattis said his goal is to maintain the friendly relationship with the Iraqis in order to secure the countrys future and, more importantly, the future of Iraqs children.\n\nHe closed his speech by saying, The division is ready to carry out any and all orders.\n\nhttp://www.usmc.mil/marinelink/image1.nsf/Lookup/200432465138/$file/mattis.jpg\n\nMaj.

In all, nearly 20,000 Marines will conduct security and stabilization operations in the region to turn over full power of Iraq to its citizens.\n\n(Official USMC photo by Cpl. Paula M.

Marine Maj. Gen. James Mattis is now the top coalition commander in Multinational Division-West, taking over Saturday for Army Maj. Gen. Charles Swannack, the commander of the 82nd Airborne Division.\n\nFor the Marines, who left the country in the fall only to return half a year later, Iraq is familiar territory. Almost two-thirds of the force served in the country last year.\n\nMattis said that experience is invaluable, especially for junior leaders. These young corporals and sergeants make the difference.\n\nHe said the region itself is different from what it was when his Marines left, and he gave credit for that to the 82nd, which ran MND-West for the last seven months.\n\nMattis said his Marines initially faced a repressive government regime we were trying to tear down. This time, were trying to build up.\n\nSince Task Force All-American took over operations in Al Anbar province, 68 American servicemembers lost their lives and so did hundreds of Iraqis  many of them serving in the fledgling security forces.\n\nIn his remarks during the transfer of authority ceremony, Swannack paid tribute to those who gave their lives as well as to the more than 500 servicemembers who were injured. He said their sacrifices helped make the region a better place for the Iraqi people.\n\nWe can be justifiably proud we have set the people of Iraq in this region on a new course, he said.\n\nFor his part, Mattis told the Iraqi dignitaries attending: I have confidence that we can work together for Iraqs future and for the good of your children.\n\nAfter the ceremony, he said that those who resort to violence wont be a part of that future.\n\nThose who want to fight ... theyll regret it, Mattis said. Well handle them roughly.\n\nBoth commanders said the two divisions have plenty in common.\n\nSwannack said that airborne soldiers often jump into a hostile area, while the Marines take boats. But once in theater, were both here doing infantry tasks.\n\nBoth divisions have been heavily deployed since Sept. 11, 2001. While the Marines begin their second stints in Iraq, no other unit in the military has been as busy as the 82nd, with continuous missions in Afghanistan and Iraq.\n\nIn fact, when the divisions last brigade heads back to the States in early April, Swannack said it will mark the first time in his command that hes had all his soldiers at Fort Bragg, N.C., at the same time.\n\nWith the Armys current missions, he doesnt expect that to last for long.\n\nMuch of the division needs to regain jump status, and artillery units need to retrain as well, he said. Both of those operations could take months.\n\nStill, he expects to have a brigades worth of troops ready to deploy anywhere by May 7.\n\nMattis said his Marines took advantage of their brief time back in the States to train as well. Units went through weeks of courses on language and culture to try to help them better understand the Iraqi people.\n\nHe said Marines would interact with local residents constantly and learn more about them along the way. Knowing their mission is making a difference for those people will give his troops a sense of purpose that keeps morale high.\n\nThe Marines actually will have more troops in the region than the 82nd had in their task force, with an increase to around 22,000 from about 18,000. Mattis said some of the Marines who just arrived in Iraq would rotate out in seven months. The Pentagon has yet to announce a schedule following the current rotation, which is still taking place.\n\nhttp://www.estripes.com/article.asp?section=104&article=20361&archive=true\n\nEllie"
