        "text": "John Moran Auctioneers is pleased to present California Living—an auction that encompasses the California aesthetic through a selection of important art and design. Highlighting the California Living auction is the Estate of Oscar and Barbara Leidenfrost, whose decades of international travel and collecting in their Southern California home curated a modern assemblage, unlike many others. Their collection evolved over the decades into an example of sophisticated, global California elegance highlighted by postmodern and contemporary works from Ed Ruscha, Vija Celmins, Richard Wyatt Jr., Takashi Murakami, Yayoi Kusama, Robert Longo, Adolph Gottlieb, Patssi Valdez, and Edward Kienholz. In dialogue with the postmodern is a large collection of turned wood vessels with works by prominent woodworkers Edward and Philip Moulthorp, an array of Chinese Yixing ceramic wares, Georg Jensen silver, and furnishings by leading designers George Nelson, Mario Bellini, Ray and Charles Eames, Richard Schultz, Knoll, Le Corbusier,"
