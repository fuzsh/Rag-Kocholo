        "meta_description": "Current understanding of sea turtle nesting, hatching, and emergence events has been largely limited to observable events on the surface of the sand, though recent approaches using audio or visual equipment have allowed scientists to better understand some underground nest phenomena. We used a technology-based approach to define motion-related Caretta caretta hatching and emergence nest events. We describe a novel low-cost, accelerometer-based system called TurtleSense that can detect movement and temperature within sea turtle nests remotely. TurtleSense is successfully able to specifically detect motion within sea turtle nests over the entire course of incubation. This system allows for the identification of infertile nests and the detection of four predictable sequential developmental activity patterns in viable nests, including a hatch and posthatch period, the timing of which can be used to tightly predict hatchling emergence events almost to the day. TurtleSense provides a much better understanding about what is happening in the nest before emergence and allows for the generation of a theory of the mechanism that triggers mass emergence. Our results suggest that motion plays a large role in hatchling communication and that the timing of emergence events may be related to the cessation of movement within the nest. Current management of sea turtle nesting events is primarily driven by counting the number of days since the nest was laid, with further safeguards placed at the nest upon subsequent visual observation of depression or emergence events. Use of TurtleSense technology can impact nest management and conservation efforts, allowing organizations to use this motion data to more tightly predict emergence dates for sea turtle hatchlings and to use viability data to inform nest management decisions.",

        "text": "Processing of change in motion data\n\nEach accelerometer reading is a vector that measures the magnitude and direction of the force acting on the sensor at the time of the reading. The readings are reported as X, Y and Z Cartesian coordinates, and each coordinate can vary from positive 2 g to negative 2 g in magnitude. Each coordinate is reported as a 12-bit signed number, so the lowest bit corresponds roughly to a force of 0.001 g. If the sensor is static (not moving), the magnitude of the X, Y and Z readings of the accelerometer roughly correspond to 1 g of force and should have a magnitude of about 1024.\n\nThe sensor constantly analyzes the readings from the accelerometer to create a profile of the energy from the motion in the nest over time. The microprocessor compares successive readings from the accelerometer to calculate the change in acceleration [or \"jolt\"]. The jolt is calculated by computing the magnitude of the difference of the two acceleration vectors. The formula for the calculation is: Joltn = _√(_xn−xn−1_)_2_+_(_yn−yn−1_)_2_+_(_zn−zn−1_)_2_ _.\n\nThe microprocessor can easily and quickly add and subtract and has a built-in math coprocessor, so except for the square root function, the Jolt can be easily and quickly calculated. Because calculating a square root is quite complicated, we do not store information about the magnitude of the jolts recorded. Instead, a calculation for the square of the Jolt (Jolt2) is done: (Joltn)2 = (xn−xn−1)2+(yn−yn−1)2+(zn−zn−1)2.\n\nThe magnitude of each Jolt2 is placed on a logarithmic scale divided into 29 different ranges (based on the highest bit of the 29 bit binary number from the Jolt2 calculation). The program has counters for each of the 29 different ranges. Each counter can be thought of as a bin. If a magnitude is in range, it is added into the bin for that range. After the programmed amount of time (typically a few minutes), the bin counts are stored in a record along with a temperature and orientation reading, and a new set of bin counters is started. Each record provides a profile of what happened during that period of time.\n\nThe number of readings in each bin reflect the jolt information that occurred while the bins for that record were being filled. The reports uploaded to the TurtleSense server are 20,834 bytes/day/nest, resulting in a compression ratio of approximately 2500:1. However, even when set at 6 minute intervals, the 240 records created each day provide adequate information about daily nest events.\n\nIn order to easily read the motion information, these approximate average energy levels (Jolt2) over a preprogrammed period of 1–6 minutes are consolidated into graphical data for each nest over time. Due to the small scale of the readings, only very small motion changes are graphed. Large disturbances, like from predation or human disturbances, are way off the chart. These graphs are maintained online and updated in real time as the reports come in (A data flowchart is depicted in Fig 1). In effect, the data processing integrates the raw data, providing a profile of the total energy of the motion that is sensed.\n\nA motion detector in the sensor placed in the nest constantly measures and computes changes in acceleration. The Micro Processor Unit (MPU) in the sensor counts the readings in 29 counters after sorting them by magnitude based on powers of 2. After a period of either one or six minutes, the 29 counts are stored as a record and the counters are reset. After 240 records have been created, the Cell Phone Unit is turned on and the data are sent to a dedicated server. The new data are stored, combined with the previous data, and graphed for internet access.\n\nhttps://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0275088.g001\n\nPosthatch\n\nThe fourth detectable nest event, termed the posthatch phase, shows a very inactive period that lasts from a few hours to a few days, spanning the time between the end of hatching and emergence onto the sand. On average, this a quiet posthatch/pre-emergence period lasts approximately 1.5 days, and can be modulated by nest depth, though we see no evidence of increased motion during this time that could indicate digging activity.\n\nVideo from Olive Ridley nests in Costa Rica also showed that when a hatchling emerged from its shell and made its way to the top of the clutch of eggs, it caused most or all of the hatchlings already assembled to adjust their position to accommodate the new arrival. This assembly at the top of the clutch was where the egg sensor was placed. After the disruption by the new arrival, all the hatchlings stopped moving until the next disruption. This repeated disruption and quieting corresponds to our repeated readings of much greater activity followed by things getting quieter during the hatching period.\n\nSurprisingly, there were very few or no dramatically large motions recorded when actual emergence happened. The sensors were placed just beneath the top 10 eggs in the nest based on the assumption that hatchlings congregate at the top of the nest before a boil. The expectation was that when the hatchling moved past the sensor egg, that motion would cause very high readings. Although this sensor placement allowed for precise detection of hatching activity and the posthatch phase, it was difficult to determine the precise time when boils occur from collected data. Hatchlings surrounding the sensor could very well be the reason that environmental noises were attenuated. The bodies of hatchlings, being soft and mostly inelastic, would absorb sounds and impacts from their surroundings. The implication of this, though, is that the hatchlings surrounding the sensor are not moving.\n\nIt could be that the hatchlings that had already started moving up through the sand were already above the sensor, but observations from the field seem to contradict that theory. Data from one nest, NH047, showed that the erratic period had ended, motion had quieted down, and a boil was imminent. Several nest inspections in the three days before the boil showed that the hatchlings had congregated around the sensor, and all the readings for those last few days were low and undramatic. Our sensor placement was chosen in order to not disturb hatchling emergence, but to also allow the sensor to move down and still detect movement rather than be dangling in the air as hatching activity caused the nest to collapse. Alternative sensor placement or the use of multiple sensors (where a first sensor is placed among the top few eggs and a second sensor just beneath the sand surface) could provide even more information about nest events and potentially detect precisely when the hatchlings climb to the surface to signal a boil in real-time.\n\nPrevious findings show that larger groups dig their way out faster than smaller groups in relocated nests [11]. While it is possible that nests with more hatchlings have a longer incubation and prehatch period, our results show that nests with more hatchlings do not have longer hatching periods, nor is the time between egg hatching and emergence onto the sand faster than in nests with fewer hatchlings. In fact, we find a weak positive correlation between more hatchlings and longer hatch to emergence periods, meaning that more hatchlings actually take longer to emerge.\n\nThough previous findings report that the depth of the nest has no effect on the hatching period [17], we observe a weak negative correlation between hatching period and nest depth, where deeper nests take longer to hatch. In addition, we confirm previous findings that the deeper the nest, the longer it takes the hatchlings to emerge once hatching is completed [17]. We also observe a quite strong positive correlation between the posthatch phases and nest depth, though it is important to note that we saw no evidence of more digging activity during this time-period. It is possible that differences exist in hatching and emergence behaviors between in situ and relocated nests, but we did not observe noticeable differences in our activity monitoring.\n\nFuture analysis of collected temperature data from the sensors can provide information about whether seasonal temperature fluctuations can impact detected hatching or post-hatch duration periods, as well as monitor precise temperature when emergence occurs. Asynchronous emergence events (“trickles”), rather than large synchronous “boils,” can be associated with large within nest temperature ranges [38], so this information could possibly be used to predict boils.\n\nMore research is needed to elucidate exactly what other factors can impact the length of the posthatch period, though temperature may be an important variable. We found that the accelerometer readings alone provided ample data to accurately pinpoint emergence dates and we did not need to use the collected temperature information as a predictor of emergence.\n\nWe theorize that motion disruptions within the nest allows hatchlings to synchronize nest activity. When incubation nears completion, hatchlings start to hatch at about the same time, but not completely simultaneously, resulting in a small wave of detectable activity after each individual hatching that rises and then settles during the hatching period. As motion ceases within the next, it is possible that this final quieting down might be the cue to the hatchlings that all their siblings have hatched and it is time to leave the nest. The ability of hatchlings to sense a sufficiently long period of calmness after hatching and a drop in temperature might be what triggers a boil. These two simple biological inputs might be all that is necessary for the instinctual programming that synchronizes the behavior of all the hatchlings.\n\nOur results also call for a careful investigation of vibration/motion-based sea turtle sibling communication. Vibration cues for hatching have been isolated in other reptiles, including the pig-nosed turtle (Carettochelys insculpta) [39], where groups of eggs hatch faster than single eggs treated in the same way, indicating a function of sibling vibrations [40]. The length of time between the movements within vibrational cues can signal embryos within a clutch to hatch, as seen in predator-induced early hatching of red-eyed treefrogs (Agalychnis callidryas), where vibrations were enough to induce early hatching and embryos were able to differentiate between different vibration stimuli [41]. Future research could combine vibration data collection with vocalization monitoring to generate a more complete picture of embryo-to-embryo communication.\n\nBecause sea turtles are a threatened species, each municipality or locality must adopt a nest management strategy, most of which are labor intensive and relatively inaccurate at predicting day of emergence. As an automated system, TurtleSense can accurately predict hatching events and send alerts to wildlife managers and researchers. This is particularly important, since depressions, the standard way of identifying a hatching nest, were present in less than half of our monitored nests. In addition, current protocols mandate that protections be given for all nests, despite the fact that hatching success between 2009–2014 ranged from 33–77% in sea turtle nests (depending on month laid and if they were relocated) in Cape Hatteras National Seashore [42]. TurtleSense can accurately predict infertile nests and eliminate the unnecessary funneling of resources towards their protection. TurtleSense can also provide information to remotely notify conservation teams about nest dangers posed on beaches in real-time, including predation, potential poaching activity, or tidal inundation, and allow management to make decisions about whether a nest contains hatchlings instead of eggs that now need to be rescued from storm surges.\n\nTurtleSense has the ability to transform sea turtle nest management, providing useful real-time data to enable more efficient utilization of resources, better hatchling protection, and fewer volunteer hours. Accurately pinpointing emergence events allows for “just in time” barrier erection, reducing the impact of turtle management induced beach closures on beach goers, tourism, and the fishing industry. We primarily examined Caretta caretta nests, though we did also monitor pilots in Olive Ridley and Green Turtle nests. We saw the same basic patterns in these nests, so we anticipate an easy transfer of this predictive model to other turtle species. This was the case in Costa Rica, where we were able to detect and predict Olive Ridley hatchling emergence accurately, even though all nests were relocated and we had not previously used TurtleSense in this species.\n\nTurtleSense seeks to both preserve the health of endangered sea turtle hatchlings and lessen the impact of beach closures for people, freeing up valuable volunteer resources. Annually, in the state of North Carolina, the NPS spends $2.0 million dollars to support coordination of more than 600,000 volunteers statewide [43]. Specifically on Hatteras Island, nest sitting includes the following tasks: arriving at dusk to clear any off road vehicle tracks in the sand and sitting with the nest from 7:30pm to 12:00am. Generally, crowds can form around the sea turtle nests located near villages. In these situations, nest sitters are required to maintain crowd control, while also ensuring the nest stays safe during emergence. Nest sitters typically work in pairs assigned to one nest, where they wait for emergence each night (approximately 5 hours) ranging from 4–8 days for each nest beginning on a specific date after the nest was laid. We estimate that this protocol of 2 volunteers for 4–8 days per nest requires approximately 40–80 volunteer hours per nest.\n\nOn Hatteras Island, nest sitters typically only begin sitting on a nest when a depression has formed, the nest is beginning to be within the average emergence day for the season, or other clear indicators that emergence is imminent. TurtleSense can instead use motion data to provide a clear signal if the volunteers need to begin nest sitting based on when hatching is completed. Through the use of TurtleSense, the end of hatching activity would signal the need for nest sitters the following day for shallow nests, and two days later for deep nests. This potentially reduces the volunteer hours to 10–20 hours for each monitored nest, based on 1–2 days of nest sitting for 2 volunteers. Some turtle may still emerge after this date, but the volunteer resources would be “just-in-time” and importantly, TurtleSense would eliminate the need for volunteers to sit with nests that have not hatched yet or that are nonviable.\n\nTurtleSense provides more predictable opportunities to engage in public outreach for emergence events from nests, which is important for both conservation and awareness efforts, as turtle-based ecotourism has positive indirect impacts on the sea turtle population sustainability and conservation efforts [44]. TurtleSense can decrease the number of volunteer hours needed, benefit the park service by providing tighter windows for emergence events, and aid fishermen with shorter beach closures. Although TurtleSense is a useful tool for many reasons, it does not mitigate the need for other turtle conservation tactics. Initiatives such as turtle-friendly lighting should be encouraged or enforced so that interference to nests can be reduced in general, lessening the need for heavy nest management tactics and the potential for misoriented hatchlings."
