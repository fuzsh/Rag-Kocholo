        "text": "Ancestral Pueblo People and Their World\n\nAbout AD 550, long before Europeans explored North America, some of the people living in the Four Corners region decided to move onto the Mesa Verde. For over 700 years these people and their descendants lived and flourished here, eventually building elaborate stone communities in the sheltered alcoves of canyon walls. In the late 1200s in the span of a generation or two, they left their homes and moved away.\n\nMesa Verde National Park preserves a spectacular reminder of this ancient culture. Archeologists have called these people Anasazi, from a Navajo word sometimes translated as \"the ancient foreigners.\" We now call them Ancestral Pueblo people, reflecting their modern descendants.\n\nLocal ranchers first reported the cliff dwellings in the 1880s and since then archeologists have sought to understand the lives of the people who lived there. Despite decades of excavation, analysis, classification, and comparison, our knowledge is incomplete. The cliff dwellings speak eloquently of a people adept at building, artistic in their crafts, and skillful at making a living from a difficult land. The structures are evidence of a society that, over centuries, accumulated skills and traditions and passed them on from generation to generation. By the Classic Pueblo Period, from 1150 to 1300, Ancestral Pueblo people were heirs of a vigorous civilization, whose accomplishments in community living and the arts must be ranked among the finest expressions of human culture in North America.\n\nUsing nature to their advantage, about AD 1200 Ancestral Pueblo people began to build their villages beneath the overhanging cliffs. Their basic construction material was sandstone that they shaped into rectangular blocks about the size of a loaf of bread. The mortar between the blocks was a mix of dirt and water. Living rooms averaged about six feet by eight feet, space enough for two or three people. Isolated rooms in the rear and on the upper levels were generally used for storing crops. The construction testifies they were experienced builders.\n\nMany daily activities took place in open courtyards in front of the rooms. Fires built in summer were mainly for cooking. In winter, when alcove rooms were damp and uncomfortable, fires probably burned throughout the village. Smoke-blackened walls and ceilings are reminders of the biting cold these people lived with for several months each year.\n\nAncestral Pueblo people spent much of their time getting food, even in the best years. They grew most of their food, but supplemented crops of beans, corn, and squash by gathering wild plants and hunting deer, rabbits, squirrels, and other animals. Their only domestic animals were dogs and turkeys. Fortunately, Ancestral Pueblo people tossed their trash close by. Scraps of food, broken pottery and tools, anything not wanted, went down the slope in front of their homes. Much of what we know about daily life here comes from these garbage heaps.\n\nSpruce Tree House was one of the largest villages in Mesa Verde. It had 130 rooms and eight kivas. Some 60 to 90 people lived here at any time. Autumn was the villagers' busiest time of year. The harvest is underway. Some men are still gleaning the fields, while others are spreading the crops on a rooftop to dry. These are the stores that will see them through the long winter and even the next year or two if there is drought. Women are making pottery and grinding corn. Children scamper about, and old men sit in the sun telling stories.\n\nFamily Life at Mesa Verde\n\nAncestral Puebloan families wore hides, warm footwear, and feather-cloth robes for winter. The turkey was important in their economyproviding food, feathers used in weaving, and bones used for tools.\n\nArcheology has yielded some facts about Mesa Verde's ancient people, but without a written record we cannot be sure about their social, political, or religious ideas. We must rely for insight on comparisons with modern Pueblo people of New Mexico and Arizona.\n\nIn the Classic Pueblo Period at Mesa Verde (from 1150 to 1300) several generations probably lived together as a household.\n\nEach family occupied several rooms and built additional rooms as it grew. Several related families likely made up a clan, probably matrilineal, that traced descent through the woman's line. Based on current Hopi practices, each clan would have had its own kiva and its own agricultural plots.\n\nTools\n\nAncestral Pueblo people used all available materials, with no metals. From locally available trees, plants, animals, and stone they made tools for grinding, cutting, pounding, chopping, scraping, perforating, polishing, and weaving.\n\nThey used the digging stick for farming, stone axe for clearing land, bow and arrow for hunting, and sharp-edged stones for cutting. They ground corn with the metate and mano and made wooden or clay spindle whorls for spinning. From bone they fashioned awls for sewing and scrapers for working animal hides.\n\nOther than the mano and metate, most stone tools were made from stream cobbles, not the soft cliff sandstone.\n\nTrade\n\nMesa Verde's economy was more complex than you might think. Even in a small farming community, some people would have more skill than others at weaving, working leather, or making pottery, arrow-points, jewelry, baskets, sandals, or other specialized articles. A surplus would be shared or bartered with neighbors.\n\nExchanges also took place between communities. Seashells from the Pacific Coast and turquoise, pottery, and cotton from the south came to Mesa Verde, passed from village to village or carried by traders on foot over a far-reaching network of trails.\n\nBasketry and Pottery\n\nThe finest baskets made at Mesa Verde were created before the people developed fired ceramic pottery. Using the spiral twilled technique, they wove handsomely decorated baskets of many sizes and shapes and used them for carrying water, storing grain, and even for cooking. They made baskets waterproof by lining them with pitch and cooked in them by dropping heated stones into the water. The most common coiling material was split willow, but sometimes rabbitbrush or skunkbush was used. As pottery-making techniques advanced about AD 550 basket-making declined. The few baskets found here from the Classic Period are not as well made as earlier baskets.\n\nThese accomplished potters made vessels of many kinds, including bowls, canteens, ladles, jars, and mugs. Corrugated ware was used mostly for cooking and storage. Elaborately decorated, smooth-surfaced black-on-white wares may have had both ceremonial and everyday uses. Women were probably the potters. Designs tended to be personal and local and most likely were passed down from mother to daughter. Design elements changed over time, which helps archeologists and modern descendants date and possibly track locations of early populations.\n\nBefore the Cliff Dwellers\n\nThe first Ancestral Pueblo people settled in Mesa Verde (Spanish for \"green table\") about AD 550. Archeologists call this early period \"Basketmaker\" to reflect the finely crafted baskets made then. The people farmed corn, beans, and squash, hunted wild animals, and gathered a wide variety of edible and useful plants. They made ingenious tools from stone, wood, and bone, and built pit houses for homes. Pit houses were often clustered as small villages on mesa tops and in cliff alcoves. The people became prolific potters and acquired the bow and arrow, a more efficient hunting weapon than the atlatl, an ancient type of spear thrower.\n\nOn the Mesa Tops\n\nAncestral Pueblo people grew crops and hunted game on the mesa tops. Hand-and-toe-hold trails connected the mesa-top fields to alcove villages and canyons below. The soil was fertile and, except in drought, about as well watered as today. The vegetation is probably about the same. There may have been fewer standing trees and snags. The ancient people cut pinyon and juniper for building materials, firewood, and to clear fields; recent wildfires have left many standing snags.\n\nPit houses People lived in pit houses here from about AD 550 to 750. The pit house was dug into the ground and featured four corner timbers that supported the roof. The firepit had an air deflector to help air circulate through the room. An antechamber might contain storage bins or pits. Some pit houses included a sipapu, a small hole in the floor, which may have had important symbolic meanings.\n\nThese were fairly prosperous times for the people, and their population grew. About AD 750 some people began to build houses above ground, with upright walls fashioned of poles and mud. They built their houses one against another in long, curving rows, often with a pit house or two in front. Pit houses would later evolve into kivas. Archeologists call this period \"Pueblo,\" Spanish for town or village, to reflect this architectural change.\n\nKiva\n\nKiva comes from the Hopi language and is used in Mesa Verde to refer to round chambers, usually underground, built in or near almost every village or homesite. Most have similar features and were likely used for combined religious, social, and utilitarian purposes. Entry was by ladder through a hole in the center of the roof.\n\nThe roof, made of timbers, juniper bark, and mud, often formed part of a plaza or public space. In modern Pueblo communities the kiva is still an important ceremonial structure.\n\nBy AD 1000, architectural skills had advanced from pole-and-adobe construction to stone masonry. Walls of thick, double-coursed stone often rose two or three stories high and were joined as units of 50 rooms or more. Pottery also evolved, as black drawings on a white background replaced simple designs on a dull gray background. Farming accounted for more of their diet than before, and much mesa-top land was cleared for agriculture.\n\nFarming\n\nAt Mesa Verde the people grew their staple crops of squash, corn, and beans in fields scattered across the mesa tops. They worked the soil with digging sticks and often built check dams across draws to catch and hold rain and snow.\n\nBetween 1150 and 1300, the Classic Pueblo Period, thousands of people lived on Mesa Verde. Many lived in compact villages of several rooms, often with kivas or courtyards. Carefully shaped building stones, finely built and plastered wall surfaces, and advancing artistry in pottery-making characterize this period. About 1225, another major population shift saw people moving back into the cliff alcoves that sheltered their ancestors centuries before. Why did they make this move? We don't know: perhaps for defense; perhaps for better protection from the elements; perhaps for religious or other reasons. Whatever the events and circumstances, the people began to build the cliff dwellings for which Mesa Verde is most famous.\n\nMost of the cliff dwellings were built from the late 1190s to late 1270s. They range from one-room houses to community centers of about 150 rooms: Cliff Palace and Long House. There is no standard ground plan. Builders fit the structures to the available space. Most walls were single courses of stone, perhaps because alcove roofs limited height and protected the walls from weather erosion. Masonry work varied in qualityrough construction is found alongside walls of well-shaped stones. Many rooms were plastered on the inside and decorated with painted designs.\n\nExploring Mesa VerdeA World Heritage Site\n\n(click for larger map)\n\nMesa Verde National Park was created in 1906 to preserve the archeological heritage of the Ancestral Pueblo people, both atop the mesas and in the cliff dwellings below. The park includes over 4,500 archeological sites; only 600 are cliff dwellings. Plan to spend at least a full day discovering the opportunities in the park.\n\nGetting Here Mesa Verde National Park can be reached by air, with daily flights into Cortez and Durango, and from rail terminals in Grand Junction, CO, and Gallup, NM; buses from those points serve Cortez. The park's only entrance and main park road are open 24 hours all year.\n\nVisitor Centers To get the most from your trip, start at the Visitor and Research Center, located just east of the park exit ramp off US 160. Open year-round. Rangers, exhibits, and a bookstore. Chapin Mesa Archeological Museum, 21 miles (45 minutes) from the park entrance, is open all year. Exhibits and dioramas trace the development of the Ancestral Pueblo people.\n\nInterpretive Programs To see Balcony House, Cliff Palace, and Long House, you must join a ranger-guided tour. Tickets are required and are sold at the Visitor and Research Center. Interpretive programs are offered year-round. Check the park website and visitor guide for more information.\n\nVisitor Services Far View Lodge and associated services (lodging and restaurant, cafeteria and gift shop nearby) are available from late April through late October. For reservations contact: Aramark Mesa Verde, PO Box 277, Mancos, CO 81328; www.visitmesaverde.com. Concession bus tours of Chapin Mesa leave from Far View Lodge.\n\nSpruce Tree Terrace, near the Chapin Mesa Archeological Museum, sells food, gifts, and souvenirs year-round.\n\nCamping Morefield Campground, open mid-May to mid-October, has single and group campsites, first-come, first-served. Campsites have tables and fireplaces with grills. Some have utility hookups. There is an RV dump station. Campground services: groceries, carry-out food, firewood, showers, and laundromat. Camping limited to 14 days. Commercial campgrounds are near the park entrance.\n\nHiking and Backpacking Hike on designated trails only. No overnight backpacking or crosscountry hiking is allowed in the park. Hikers must register at the trailhead or museum for Petroglyph Point and Spruce Canyon trails. Hikers must carry water in summer. Trails can be muddy and slippery after rain; proper footwear is essential. Visitors with health problems should be aware that all trails except Soda Canyon Overlook Trail and Knife Edge Trail include steep elevation changes. Trails are closed by snow in winter.\n\nBicycles Bicycling is permitted on the park road to Chapin Mesa; use extreme caution due to sharp corners, narrow shoulders, and rocks and large vehicles on the road. Wetherill Mesa Road is closed to bicycles. The Long House Loop, a paved six-mile loop that begins at the Wetherill Mesa kiosk, is open to bicycles.\n\nFor Your Safety and Protection Visits to cliff dwellings can be strenuous. Trails are steep and uneven, with steps and ladders to climb. Visiting cliff dwellings or hiking is not recommended for those with heart or respiratory problems. Major cliff dwellings can be seen from overlooks. Parents: Watch carefully for your children's safety, especially near canyon rims and in archeological sites. Do not throw anything into the canyons; there may be people below. Emergency first aid is available; check with a ranger.\n\nPark roads have sharp curves and steep grades. Be alert for falling rocks. Do not park on roadways; use pullouts. Roads and trails may be hazardous in winter; ask for details at the entrance station.\n\nNever leave valuable items unattended and visible in your car. Take valuables with you if possible; lock large items in your trunk. Lock car doors and windows.\n\nAccessibility We strive to make our facilities, services, and programs accessible to all. For information go to a visitor center, ask a ranger, call, or check our website. Overlooks are wheelchair-accessible with assistance. Wheelchairs with wide-rim wheels are recommended. Trails may not meet legal grade requirements.\n\nRegulations Visitors to cliff dwellings must be accompanied by a park ranger during scheduled tours or open hours. • Camp only in the designated campground. • Feeding, capturing, or teasing wildlife, and picking, cutting, or damaging plants are prohibited. • Pets must be physically restrained and are not allowed in public buildings or on trails. • Be careful with fire. One careless match can wipe out the growth of a lifetime. • Firearms regulations are on the park website. • Motor vehicles are allowed only on roadways, pullouts, or parking areas. • Report all accidents or injuries to a park ranger.\n\nStewardship and Preservation Most cliff dwellings are unexcavated and closed to the public. The Antiquities Act of 1906 and the Archeological Resources Protection Act of 1979 prohibit the excavation, injury, or destruction of any archeological site on federal land and the defacing, destruction, or removal of any object of antiquity in the park. Fines up to $100,000 and imprisonment up to 20 years are possible. Sites in the park are fragile. Please help us protect them for future generations.\n\nVisiting Chapin Mesa and Wetherill Mesa\n\nMay through September, visit both Chapin Mesa and Wetherill Mesa.
