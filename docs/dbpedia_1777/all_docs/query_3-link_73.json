        "text": "Intra-guild predator dynamics: the effects of recolonizing gray wolf populations on cougars in northeast Oregon. June 2019 Since the reintroduction of wolves in Idaho, Montana, and Wyoming in 1996, recovering wolf populations have expanded their distributions into Oregon, and other western states where they have largely be extirpated (since 1940's in Oregon). Consistent wolf sign was observed in northeastern Oregon in 2006 and now 8-10 packs exist in this region. Since near extirpation of cougars in Oregon in the 1960's, cougar populations have now recovered to stable levels throughout the state and their ecology and population dynamics prior to the arrival of wolves is well studied. The recolonization of wolves into Oregon raises important questions regarding their impacts on prey populations (deer and elk), livestock depredation, and interspecific competition with cougars.<br><br>Within this context, we will address the following objectives:<br>1) Determine prey selection of wolves in multiple packs in Oregon where prey availability differs among packs.<br>2) Determine effects of presence of wolf pack(s) on population dynamics and habitat use of cougars in the Mt.

The recolonization of wolves into Oregon raises important questions regarding their impacts on prey populations (deer and elk), livestock depredation, and interspecific competition with cougars. Within this context, and in collaboration with Oregon Department of Fish and Wildlife this study will investigate prey selection of co-occurring wolves and cougars, and the impact of wolves on the demographics, habitat use, and movement patterns of cougar. The results from this study will provide information that will aide in the management of these two large carnivores in Oregon. Developing Non-Invasive Methods to Monitor Burrow-nesting Seabird Populations January 2017 We will develop, test, and validate multiple new, efficient, and minimally invasive techniques to monitor populations of a representative burrow-nesting seabird, Leach's Storm-petrel, and to generate and compare new indices to traditional methods of determining burrow occupancy. Specifically, we will use upward viewing remote cameras and acoustic recorders to generate indices of activity (abundance) within plots where concurrent traditional surveys of audio playback, burrow camera, and grubbing will also occur. None Conservation of the Critically Endangered Chinese Crested Tern: Restoration of a Lost Breeding Colony March 2019 In the latter half of the 20th Century, Chinese Crested Terns (Sterna bernsteini) were presumed to be extinct, with no documented observations after 1937. In 2000, however, Chinese Crested Terns were rediscovered nesting in the Matzu Islands of the Taiwan Strait. Subsequent surveys by Chinese ornithologists revealed an additional breeding site in the Jiushan Islands of Xiangshan County, Zhejiang Province. Human disturbance – fisherman collecting eggs - later caused the abandonment of this colony. Despite their recent rediscovery, Chinese Crested Terns are still considered one of the most endangered seabird species in the world and one of the most critically endangered vertebrate species. Recovery of this species is possible, however, if nesting habitat can be established and protected. The goal of this project is to restore the Chinese Crested Tern to the Jiushan Islands, using techniques of social attraction and colony monitoring successfully applied to seabird restoration projects throughout the world. The specific proposal to the Wildlife Without Borders program was to fund the manufacture of Chinese Crested Tern decoys and solar-powered audio playback systems to play recordings of Chinese Crested Tern calls. Terns are highly gregarious colonial-nesting species which can be attracted to sites with suitable nesting habitat using decoys and recorded calls. This equipment would play an important role in the effort to restore Chinese Crested Terns to a former nesting area. The restoration project is a collaborative effort of several Chinese and American institutions (Xiangshan County Marine and Fishery Bureau, Zhejiang Natural History Museum, Oregon State University, and the U.S. Geological Survey – Oregon Cooperative Fish and Wildlife Research Unit). Support from the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service Wildlife Without Borders program has furthered this international collaboration to save one of the world’s most critically endangered animals. Chinese Crested Terns are likely the most endangered seabird species in eastern Asia, and a flagship species for seabird conservation in China. The estimated global population of breeding adult Chinese Crested Terns is barely 100. The main threats to the species are illegal egg harvest and the increasing intensity and frequency of typhoons in the East China Sea. This restoration project seeks to establish a dispersed network of safe, protected breeding colony sites for the common colony associate species for Chinese Crested Terns, the Greater Crested Tern, as a means to provide nesting habitat and enhance reproductive success of Chinese Crested Terns. The project is a collaboration since 2010 with the Zhejiang Museum of Natural History, Hangzhou, PR China, and a variety of bird conservation NGOs in China. The research project seeks to identify those factors currently limiting the reproductive success and population size of Chinese Crested Terns, their migratory routes, and over-wintering range using a combination of satellite telemetry and field readable leg band technologies. Monitor and Evaluate Caspian Terns and their Impacts on the Survival of Juvenile Salmonids in the Columbia River Estuary November 2015 This project is a continuation of previously funded work in 2008 through 2012 that investigated the nesting ecology and food habits of Caspian terns at prospective Corps-constructed Caspian tern sites in interior Oregon and northeastern California to assess the potential impacts of new or larger tern colonies on local stocks of forage fishes, particularly fish species of special concern (e.g., juvenile salmonids, Warner suckers, shortnose suckers, Lost River suckers; BRNW 2009, 2010, 2011, 2012, 2013). This study is important for evaluating the efficacy of the Caspian Tern Management Plan in reducing predation on Columbia Basin salmonids and for evaluating impacts to ESA-listed fish outside the Basin. None Develop Baseline Information on Double-crested Cormorants Relative to Their Impacts on Survival of Salmonid Smolts in the Columbia River Estuary September 2015 AVS-P-08-02 is a continuation of previously funded work in 2008 through 2012 that investigated the nesting ecology, food habits, and predation rates on juvenile salmonids by double-crested cormorants nesting at the colony on East Sand Island in the Columbia River estuary. During the 2011 and 2012 contract years, research on the feasibility of methods for limiting or reducing the size of the double-crested cormorant colony on East Sand Island was conducted. None Mapping Physical Characteristics of the Columbia River Mouth Using Transmittered Diving Waterbirds December 2015 We propose to use two species of diving waterbirds, double-crested cormorants and Brandt’s cormorants (Phalacrocorax auritus and P. penicillatus), as sampling platforms to map a variety of physical characteristics at the mouth of the Columbia River (MCR; e.g., temperature, conductivity, depth, and bedform morphology). This work would enhance the physical characterization at the MCR, which is a primary objective of the RIVIT II DRI, and expand on the animal-based sampling that the RIVIT II DRI has previously supported. The study would leverage off of our telemetry and other research experience with cormorants and other waterbirds at the MCR. None Evaluation of Caspian tern management to reduce predation on ESA-listed salmonids in the Columbia Plateau region March 2019 This study is designed to evaluate the foraging behavior and colony connectivity of Caspian terns (Hydroprogne caspia) nesting on Goose Island in Potholes Reservoir, with particular emphasis on predation by terns from this colony on ESA-listed juvenile salmonids (Oncorhynchus spp.) from the upper Columbia River. Caspian terns nesting at the two largest breeding colonies for the species on the Columbia Plateau have been shown to cause significant mortality to out-migrating juvenile salmonids in the Columbia and Snake rivers. Demographics and habitat use of Greater Sage-Grouse in wildfire-affected habitats in Oregon. June 2025 Southeast Oregon contains part of one of the largest contiguous sage-brush steppe habitats remaining within the extant range of greater sage-grouse. During the summer of 2012, several large wildfires included more than 1 million acres of Oregon sage-grouse habitat within their perimeters. In collaboration with Oregon Department of Fish and Wildlife we designed a long-term study to evaluate acute (short-term) and chronic (long-term) effects of large-scale wildfire on female greater sage-grouse demographics and habitat use and selection. Accomplishing these objectives will inform the prioritization of areas for post-fire habitat rehabilitation and restoration, and help identify areas requiring further protection and/or active management to reduce risk of wildfire and ensure sage-grouse population persistence.

Survival rates and causes of mortality for black-tailed deer and mule deer in Oregon. June 2015 Both black-tailed deer and mule deer provide important hunting opportunities and associated economic benefits to the state of Oregon. Perceived declines in both species have highlighted the need for a better understanding of the factors affecting population dynamics of these species in Oregon. Long-term data collection on black-tailed deer in southwestern Oregon and mule deer in eastern Oregon has resulted in extensive telemetry data set for a large number of individuals over 6-7 years. This project seeks to analyze these retrospective data to gain a better understanding of the factors influencing survival, home range size and movements of black-tailed deer in southwestern Oregon and mule deer in eastern Oregon.

None Seabird Telemetry Project - BSIERP March 2013 Project investigates the impact of climate change in the Bering Sea on the foraging ecology and reproductive success of piscivorous colonial seabirds on the Pribilof Island. None Evaluate the Impacts of Avian Predation on Salmonid Smolts from the Columbia and Snake Rivers March 2014 This project focuses on the impact of piscivorous colonial waterbirds that nest in the Columbia Plateau region on the survival of juvenile salmonids out-migrating from the Upper Columbia River and the Snake River. None Evaluate Management of Caspian Terns and Develop Baseline Information on Double-crested Cormorants Relative to their Impact on Salmonid Smolts in the Columbia River Estuary February 2013 This project focuses on investigating the impact of predation by double-crested cormorants nesting in the Columbia River estuary on the survival of ESA-listed salmonids, and monitors the implementation of the Caspian Tern Management Plan for the Columbia River Estuary None Avian Predation on Juvenile Salmonids in the Lower Columbia River January 2019 Long-term research, monitoring, and evaluation project investigating the impact of piscivorous colonial waterbirds on survival of ESA-listed salmonids from the Columbia River basin. Avian predation on juvenile salmonids has been identified as a limiting factor for restoration of a number of ESA-listed salmonid species in the Columbia River basin. In particular, several species of piscivorous colonial waterbirds, including Caspian terns, double-crested cormorants, California gulls, and ring-billed gulls, have been found to consume more than 2% of out-migrating smolts in some listed populations. The research, monitoring, and evaluation funded by this project is intended to quantify the magnitude of smolt losses to avian predators, design and in some cases implement management actions, when warranted, to reduce avian predation rates on ESA-listed salmonids, and evaluate the efficacy of management actions for enhancing survival of juvenile salmonids. The RM&E that is part of this project is supported by the Bonneville Power Administration, the Northwest Power and Conservation Council, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, NOAA Fisheries, and the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. The research results from this project have been used to design and implement three different management plans to reduce avian predation rates on Columbia Basin salmonid smolts, including two management plans in the Columbia River estuary and one in the Columbia Plateau region. These management plans have substantially reduced predation rates by Caspian terns and double-crested cormorants on some populations of Columbia Basin salmonids. Structured Decision Making for Brown Bears on National Park Service Lands in Alaska: Integration of Monitoring to Inform Management December 2013 Brown bears, or grizzlies (Ursus arctos horribilis), are widely distributed, abundant, and their management is of interest throughout much of their Alaskan range. Brown bears are regulated as a game species by the Alaska Department of Fish and Game (ADFG) and occur in large numbers on lands managed by the National Park Service (NPS). Depending on the status of the park, NPS involvement in bear management ranges from regulating access to full involvement with ADFG in regulating harvest. By its nature, this problem involves tradeoffs between competing interests (sport hunting, subsistence hunting, and potential release of ungulates from predation) with other values such as wildlife viewing, with uncertainty about the impacts of harvest activities and human encroachment from mining and other activities on these respective values. Thus, NPS and ADFG managers face difficult decisions in establishing a balance between these conflicting needs. To aid the decision-making process, we propose to build decision-support models consisting of relationships among management actions, sources of uncertainty, and potential outcomes. Because existing knowledge of the dynamics of bear populations is imperfect, the models will allow for the formal incorporation of inventory and monitoring data to reduce uncertainty and improve the understanding of the dynamics of bear populations and future decision-making. None The Development of an Adaptive, Decision-Support Tool for the Conservation and Recovery of Least Chub, Iotichthys phlegethontis December 2013 The least chub, Iotichthys phlegethontis, is a small endemic fish species native to Bonneville Basin, Utah. The species was reportedly common in the beginning of the 20th century and was found in streams, freshwater ponds, wetlands, and springs throughout the Great Basin. However, the species began to decline mid-century and has continued to decline for the last two decades. Currently, five wild populations of the species exist. Reasons for the species decline are varied and include: habitat loss and degradation due livestock, energy exploration and development, and groundwater withdrawal; interactions with nonnative species; and isolation and fragmentation of extant populations. To reverse the declines, natural resource managers need explicit tools to identify the most effective conservation strategies. . The goal of this project is to develop decision support tools for assisting biologists to manage the least chub. None Hatchery Program Viability Assessment June 2024 Oregon Department of Fish and Wildlife (ODFW) operates 33 hatchery facilities in Oregon, 14 of which are state-owned. Statewide, these facilities produce fish for over 70 salmon and steelhead hatchery programs (i.e., releases of a specific anadromous species/run type in one or more locations within a basin or sub-basin). They also produce several million resident trout that are stocked in waterbodies throughout the state. The impacts of climate change (e.g., increasing stream temperatures, higher disease incidence, decreasing stream flow, and reduced ocean survival) will affect the ability of hatchery programs to meet fishery and conservation objectives. The goal of this project is to assess vulnerability to climate change impacts, including risks to program viability, for a sample set of hatchery programs representing different geographic areas of the state and the primary species raised in Oregon hatcheries. Findings will be presented to the Oregon Legislature as part of a third-party assessment of the operations, sustainability, and climate vulnerability of state-owned fish hatcheries. A completed report will be presented to the Joint Committee on Ways and Means during the 2025 legislative session, and will directly inform policy decisions at the state level. None Elucidating the practice of interdisciplinary and actionable science June 2025 This project addresses three research questions: (1) What skills and abilities (including specific behaviors, cognitive habits and emotional approaches) are helpful and/or necessary to do user- focused applied science, particularly in collaborative and/or interdisciplinary settings? (2) How did scientists currently using user-focused applied science, transdisciplinary, and team science approaches develop the skills and abilities upon which they currently rely?

In recent years, USFWS staff have engaged in a variety of internal efforts to prioritize supporting a diverse workforce. However, there has yet to be a concerted cross-program assessment that captures the voices of agency staff to understand their narratives on how the Service is reconceptualizing conservation, or how these efforts are—or are not—moving the needle towards the goal of a more inclusive agency who reflects the multiple values of the American public. To aid the agency in their assessment of these efforts, our main project objectives are to: (1) To conduct a discourse analysis of conservation narratives in the USFWS that might include or exclude conservationists from historically underrepresented and underserved groups. (2) To understand how efforts to recruit and retain staff from historically unrepresented groups can scale up across multiple initiatives and programs to create organizational change.

We will use a two-pronged research approach combining 1) an online representative survey of Oregon residents and 2) visitor intercept surveys of visitors to the Oregon coast. In the first research phase we will identify the degree to which a) climate action behavior and behavioral intentions and b) climate adaptation policy support are related to beliefs about ocean acidification and feelings of connectedness to the Oregon coast and, more specifically, the Oregon Marine Reserves. We will use these results to inform the second research phase, in which we will assess the salience of ocean acidification and climate adaptation needs among coastal visitors, and test the impact of different climate nudges on coastal visitors’ future climate action. Results from this research will inform Oregon Marine Reserves Program and other ODFW communication strategies related to coastal and marine ecosystems, including climate adaptation.

Investigating practitioner organization communication with landowners about human-beaver coexistence June 2025 Beavers are landscape engineers. They create habitat for other species, and change the landscape in ways that often help buffer ecosystems and people from the damaging effects of climate change, including drought, flood, and wildfire risks. In part because of these benefits, there is a movement to restore beaver and beaver-modified habitat on the landscape in Oregon. However, beavers can also be controversial because of the damage they can cause to human structures and crops. As such, beavers are a useful case study for how to equitably engage Oregonians in wildlife habitat restoration efforts while simultaneously mitigating human-wildlife conflict and promoting coexistence. In situations like these, social science can support engagement programs that are a) tailored to key audiences’ needs, b) coordinated across organizations and agencies, and c) targeted at the specific moment when action is taken. However, this kind of participatory evidence-based approach to behavioral design has not yet been applied to human-beaver coexistence in Oregon. We propose to answer the question: How can private landowners be supported to take coexistence actions that are mutually beneficial for their needs and beaver populations in Oregon? We will assemble a community of practice comprising groups that work with private landowners on two dimensions of coexistence in Oregon: human-beaver conflict management and beaver-modified habitat restoration. Together, we will identify a) best practices for landowner engagement (both tried and true strategies and creative new approaches), b) pinch points limiting landowner engagement, and c) opportunities to coordinate future outreach and engagement campaigns. We will use social science methods to execute this project, combining baseline and follow-up interviews, facilitated workshops, and pre-post social network analysis. Results and lessons learned from this project will be shared with ODFW, the community of practice, other stakeholders and rightsholders, and the broader conservation science community to catalyze wider discussion and adoption of human-beaver coexistence strategies, and guide strategic implementation of ODFW’s Beaver Habitat Action Plan in the future.<br> Beavers are landscape engineers.

Habitat managers can maximize restoration efficiency and effectiveness if they account for how restoration actions will interact with other factors, for example: How will hydropower-related modifications in sediment regimes impact the restoration area’s functional value as salmon habitat? Will the restoration area play a role in mitigating potentially negative effects of hatchery salmon? What effect could the restoration have on the number of returning adult salmon and commercial, recreational, and tribal harvest rates? Put simply, H-Integration is a concerted effort to account for all H-factors when pursuing the goal of a self-sustaining, harvestable salmon run. This goal of this project is to demonstrate how managers can use an H-integrated approach to maximize the efficiency and effectiveness of restoration. We believe that an H-Integrated approach can maximize the efficiency and effectiveness of ongoing and future restoration projects. This is because it allows managers to identify restoration actions that are most likely to mitigate negative interactions between different species and stocks of salmon, bolster harvest rates, and maintain habitat function in the face of climate change and shifts in hydropower-mediated sediment delivery regimes.

Black-tailed deer use of winter range in southern Oregon June 2025 Oregon Department of Fish and Wildlife (ODFW) manages Black-tailed Deer (BTD) populations through evaluation of trend indices, primarily spotlight route and hunter harvest data. In recent years, BTD spotlight survey data suggest populations are declining across the state, but numbers are generally higher near residential/urban locations than beyond the urban growth boundary. When survey data from residential/urban areas is combined with data from public land, deer density estimates (deer/mile) are often inflated. Thus, deer populations from urban areas are impacting overall population counts on which hunting tag allocations are based, yet most residential/urban deer are likely not available for harvest. In collaboration with ODFW, this project was designed to address several questions of management concern for BTD in southern Oregon, including an increased understanding of habitat use, spatial and temporal migration behavior, habitat characteristics of migration corridors and winter range areas, and seasonal and annual survival rates. These data will aid in the development of hunting regulations, management of migrating BTD and their habitat, and provide resources for management biologists faced with urban development of BTD winter ranges in Oregon.

Mapping ungulate migration corridors in Oregon June 2024 Understanding the costs and benefits of migration, and the location of areas in the landscape where important migration behaviors occur, is critical to sustainable management of ungulate populations that are of high economic value and cultural importance in western states like Oregon. This is particularly important as habitat loss and fragmentation continue to increase in association with human activities and development across ungulate ranges in the west. These landscape changes can disrupt ecosystem function and increase the cost of migration for target populations. The identification and prioritization of migration corridors throughout Oregon would address a critical data gap for the state and facilitate conservation and management of these populations. In collaboration with the Oregon Department of Fish and Wildlife (ODFW) and the USGS, Wyoming Cooperative Fish and Wildlife Research Unit, the following objectives were developed to address these needs for mule deer and pronghorn antelope in Oregon:<br><br>1). Compile all available GPS collar data on migratory and non-migratory mule deer and pronghorn antelope in Oregon and conduct an analysis using Brownian Bridge Movement Models. <br>2).

In collaboration with Oregon Department of Fish and Wildlife (ODFW) and a USGS team at the Wyoming Cooperative Fish and Wildlife Research Unit a general framework to map ungulate migration routes and identify portions of routes to prioritize for conservation has been developed to use GPS location data in a standardized framework. Landscape changes can disrupt ecosystem function and increase the cost of migration for target ungulate populations. The identification and prioritization of migration corridors throughout Oregon would address a critical data gap for the state and facilitate conservation and management of important mule deer and pronghorn antelope populations across the West. Pacific Lamprey Overwintering Habitat Research in North Umpqua River Basin September 2011 The research goal is to assess the autecology and diversity of upstream migratory behaviors (including holding, migration, aestivation, overwintering, and spawning phases), the key environmental variables that influence and shape these various migratory behaviors, as well as the various habitat needs of the adult Pacific lamprey in various phases of their upstream migration in North Umpqua River basin. Using coded radio tags, this project will assess the habitat use of adult Pacific lamprey at the landscape level (large scale) and site level (small scale). A variety of landscape level habitat variables (gradient, stream width, cover, etc.) and site level habitat variables (habitat type, substrate, water depth, etc.) will be analyzed in depth to determine their significance in phase-specific lamprey habitat selection. An assortment of temporally-sensitive environmental variables (water temperature, discharge, dissolved oxygen, etc.) will also be evaluated in terms of their significance for Pacific lamprey optimal habitat range as well as their role as cues for migration behavior. The project will also examine whether the migratory behavior patterns are associated with run timing, morphological, and physiological features of lamprey. Assessing the proportion of radio tagged lamprey that migrate through the counting station vs. other routes at Winchester Dam will be critical to provide a better estimate for the total population of adult Pacific lamprey in the North Umpqua River basin above Winchester Dam. This work will bridge the knowledge gap that exists in Pacific lamprey research and help fishery resource managers focus restoration activities for Pacific lamprey in key, essential habitat within the basin and other local watersheds. The outcomes from this research will help fishery managers prioritize on lamprey habitat conservation even under changing climate conditions. None Maturation Timing and Run Identification of Adult Pacific Lamprey, Entosphenus tridentatus, at Willamette Falls, Oregon January 2011 Objective 1: Describe the body morphology, including body size, of adult Pacific lamprey for the purpose of discerning sexual dimorphisms and stage of maturation. Objective 2: Estimate the fat content of Pacific lamprey for the purpose of discerning sexual dimorphisms and maturation characteristics. Objective 3: Identify the sex and status of reproductive maturation of adult Pacific lamprey through gonad histology and hormone assays. Objective 4: Identify potential links between the energetic status and reproductive development and the seasonal river flow and thermal regimes of adult Pacific lamprey collected at Willamette Falls and compare this information with lamprey recently returned from the sea (to be used as a baseline comparison) for the purposes of identifying runs of Pacific lamprey at Willamette Falls. None Long term fish disease monitoring program in the Lower Klamath River (2007-2012) September 2012 Because the life cycles of these parasites are complex, predicting the severity of disease in fish requires understanding how life cycles are affected not only by water temperature, nutrient levels and flow, but also by numbers of spores contributed back to the system by infected fish as well as the distribution and abundance of the polychaete host receiving those spores. Data on disease incidence and severity from monitoring of trapped migrating smolts provides the baseline for evaluation of data from other monitoring objectives. The researchers have a variety of tools to determine how these variables affect parasite levels and subsequent disease. A quantitative PCR assay (QPCR)(Hallett and Bartholomew 2006) provides measures of parasites in water samples, in fish or in polychaetes. Sentinel fish studies (Stocking et al. 2006) provide data on disease severity throughout the river and over time. Methods developed for monitoring polychaete populations (Stocking et al. 2006) provides data both on abundance and infection prevalence in that host. These studies are linked to monitoring water quality (Susan Corum, Karuk Tribe; Paul Zedonis, USFWS). By relating information from all of these studies The researchers hope to provide a means to predict disease severity and to provide tools for rapid assessment that would enable decisions to be made on potential pathogen effects. To accomplish these objectives, the researchers have defined a set of locations that will serve as index sites, providing long-term and detailed information on infection in fish and polychaetes, polychaete populations and numbers of parasites in water samples. In 2006, exposures of Klamath River strains of Chinook and coho salmon were included along with disease susceptible rainbow trout to develop correlations between measured parasites in water (a rapid assessment method) and disease outcome. This will be continued in subsequent years to determine disease outcome under what the researchers expect to be different sets of environmental conditions. Developing data sets at identified sites will also allow the researchers to monitor populations of polychaetes in an effort to predict changes that might occur under different environmental conditions and over time. OBJECTIVE 1: Development of a multi-year dataset on infection prevalence in both host populations at selected locations to monitor how changes in flow, temperature and other variables alter parasite infection rate. This objective will provide crucial integration with data from out-migrant populations conducted by USFWS and will address the following research questions: 1. What is the annual variation in disease prevalence and severity in outmigrant Chinook salmon 2. What is the relationship between parasite numbers measured in water samples, infection prevalence in polychaete populations and biological effects in salmon? 3. How do polychaete-parasite populations change (density, abundance, prevalence of infection) and in response to what ecological variables? 4. What are the relative susceptibilities of Chinook and coho salmon and what are their roles in supporting parasite life cycles? OBJECTIVE 2: The goal of this objective is first to create a model to assess the transmission potential of the parasite between the polychaete host and the vertebrate host. Secondly, a community model will be used to examine how this potential is affected by species outside of the transmission cycle and to account for unexpected outcomes that might result from change. The community model allows the researchers to examine how perturbations can affect the basic transmission model. Both together would allow the researchers to do risk analysis following change and to examine the potential for management interventions None Condition and Spawning Success of Adult Spring Chinook Salmon in the Willamette River June 2011 1. Evaluate condition of adult spring Chinook salmon returning to Willamette Valley Projects and relate condition to spawning success and pre-spawn mortality levels. 2. Evaluate arriving and post-spawning spring Chinook salmon for other potential pre-spawning mortality causes including environmental stressors, disease, and parasites. 3. Develop methods for sampling adult migrants at Willamette Falls adult trap. 4. Compile and synthesize available literature for anadromous adult salmonid migration in the Willamette Valley ecosystem to identify current knowledge, identify critical knowledge gaps, and to provide a context to prioritize future research needs. The review will include analysis of radio-telemetry data collected by USACE personnel on the North Fork Middle Fork Willamette River in 2004-2007 None Pigeon guillemot restoration research in Prince William Sound December 2011 1. Determine the feasibility of restoring the breeding population of Pigeon Guillemots on Naked Island using mink control. Researchers propose answering the following questions: a) Is the mink population on Naked Island introduced, or is it the result of natural colonization? b) Is mink predation currently a significant factor limiting guillemot nest success on Naked Island? c) How feasible is it to trap and remove all mink from Naked Island and, if the removal is successful, how long will Naked Island likely remain mink-free? 2. Determine whether the size and productivity of the breeding population of Pigeon Guillemots on Naked Island is limited by food supply. Researchers propose answering the following questions: a) What is the current size of the Pigeon Guillemot breeding population on Naked, Peak, Storey, Smith, Little Smith, and Lone islands in central PWS? b) Do the diets of most pairs of nesting guillemots consist primarily of nearshore demersal fishes (i.e., blennies, sculpins, pricklebacks), and include few high-lipid schooling forage fish (i.e., sand lance)? c) Do less than half of all successful nesting pairs of guillemots raise 2-chick broods? d) Are chick meal delivery rates, chick growth rates, and chick fledging masses below average? 3. Design a restoration plan for the Pigeon Guillemot population on Naked Island that is feasible, effective, and associated with a reasonable cost-benefit ratio. Potential restoration alternatives include: a) removal of all mink from Naked Island b) institute a lethal mink control program on Naked Island to drastically reduce the size of mink population c) Iinstallation of artificial guillemot nest sites on Naked Island to reduce vulnerability to predation d) lethal mink control and installation of artificial nest sites on Naked Island to further reduce vulnerability to predation e) no action None Evaluating the translocation of albatross chicks as a mechanism for establishing a new breeding colony and determining albatross habitat associations in the North Pacific November 2009 1) Determine the efficacy of chick translocation as a management technique; 2) Address multi-scale questions of habitat use (at the coarse scale, researchers will determine foraging patterns and habitat use of breeding birds and fine scale analyses will include direct observations of short-tailed albatross aggregations in known habitat \"hot spots\" (Piatt et al. 2006) in the North Pacific, including the Bering Sea). None Diet Composition and Reproductive Energetics of a Rare and Declining Seabird, the Kittlitz's Murrelet December 2010 Our primary objectives for this specific project are to: (1) Characterize and describe the pre-breeding and post-breeding diet of adult KIMU in Icy Bay, Alaska, and, if permitting allows, evaluate long-term variation in diet using historical museum specimens; (2) Understand the relationship between physiological factors (e.g., reproductive status) and diet of individual adult KIMU; and, (3) Develop a reproductive energetics model to quantify energy and food requirements of adults during the breeding season. None Biological Investigations of Yaquina Head Outstanding Natural Area December 2009 This project is designed to enhance inter-agency collaboration, customer service to hundreds of thousands of visitors at YHONA, and land stewardship in identifying causes and consequences of the biological trends. The long-term benefits of this work are multi-fold. This would establish a partnership between agencies for future biological monitoring needs at YHONA, while continuing some of the efforts in this project to address long-term variation in biological trends related to changing ocean conditions and climate effects. Additionally, updating and disseminating the most current information through innovative outreach avenues greatly enhances visitor experience and perception of agency stewardship of public resources. None Effects of push-up dams on survival and production of redband trout in the South Fork John Day River December 2009 In order to evaluate the benefits to steelhead of replacing push-up dams with LFS dams, researchers propose to: 1) Characterize movement and habitat use patterns of juvenile steelhead. 2) Determine habitat quality in terms of its capacity to produce juvenile steelhead (individual growth and survival will be used as the main indicators of this). 3) Compare movement and distribution patterns between juvenile steelhead not affected by movement barriers and those that may be affected by partial and total barriers. 4) Estimate the loss of production that can result from the direct effect of barriers. 5) Examine the influences on steelhead production of potentially indirect factors, such as: i) Stream temperature. Ii) Prey availability and distribution. Iii) Fish community structure and dynamics. Iv) Geomorphic features, riparian conditions, and land uses. None Competitive interactions and resource partitioning between northern spotted owls and barred owls in western Oregon September 2011 The purpose of this research project is to develop a better understanding of the competitive relationships between northern spotted owls and barred owls, including exploitation of common resources and behavioral interactions. Specific objectives are to: 1) Describe size and spatial overlap of home ranges in areas where the species co-occur. 2) Compare diets and habitat associations of the two species with respect to: a) differences among seasons, b) assessment of prey preference, and c) computation of habitat selection. 3) Investigate resource partitioning based on indices of overlap in use of space, habitats, and food resources. 4) Investigate behavioral interactions between the two species to determine dominance-subordinance relations. 5) Estimate survival rates of the two species None Occupancy status of Northern Spotted Owls in southern Oregon. December 2027 The Northern Spotted Owl (<i>Strix occidentalis caurina</i>) is listed as Threatened under the Endangered Species Act, primarily because of the loss of old growth forest habitat due to timber harvest. The impact of management activities that may remove or modify spotted owl nesting, roosting or foraging habitat on federal lands is required because of the federally threatened status of the northern spotted owl. The purpose of this study is to conduct surveys to locate resident spotted owls and identify owl territories that might be affected by a proposed management activity in the Fremont-Winema and Rogue Siskiyou National Forest in southern Oregon. These data will continue to be used to understand trends in occupancy status of northern spotted owls and barred owls and increase our understanding of owl ecology and habitat use within the region. The purpose of this study is to conduct surveys to locate resident spotted owls and identify owl territories that might be affected by a proposed management activity in the Fremont-Winema and Rogue Siskiyou National Forest in southern Oregon. The impact of management activities that may remove or modify spotted owl nesting, roosting or foraging habitat on federal lands is required because of the federally threatened status of the northern spotted owl. This is a continuation of Northern spotted owl population monitoring that has been accomplished thru nearly 3 decades of collaborations and partnerships between the USDA Forest Service Region 6, Pacific Northwest Research Station, the Oregon Cooperative Fish and Wildlife Research Unit, and Oregon State University. These data will continue to be used to understand trends in occupancy status of northern spotted owls and barred owls and increase our understanding of owl ecology and habitat use within the region. Assessment of white sturgeon recruitment in John Day reservoir August 2024 The construction of dams on the Columbia River has fragmented Pacific White Sturgeon (Acipenser transmontanus) habitats, producing essentially isolated populations between mainstem impoundments. Observations of young-of-the-year (YOY) White Sturgeon in the lower three Columbia River reservoirs (Bonneville, The Dalles, and John Day) have been declining over the past two decades. The John Day reservoir appears to be particularly vulnerable, where only 1 YOY sturgeon has been observed since 2012 during annual reservoir sampling. Based on the current length frequency distribution of sturgeon in the John Day reservoir, conservation metrics are likely not being met for the desired proportion of juveniles and subadults within the population. To address potential recruitment bottlenecks conceivably associated with spawning activity, we will use acoustic telemetry receivers throughout the John Day reservoir to characterize seasonal movements of adult White Sturgeon and formulate a habitat utilization model to identify likely spawning habitats. Additionally, if measurable YOY recruitment occurs within the next 6-9 years (estimated acoustic tag life), we hope to refine our understanding of environmental parameters conducive for spawning success. As effects of climate change become increasingly prevalent, having a contemporary understanding of White Sturgeon spawning patterns is essential. This research not only addresses critical uncertainties for lower Columbia River White Sturgeon, but also for North American sturgeon populations in general. Recruitment declines are being observed in many sturgeon populations—most famously in the Fraser River—and insights gained from this research may benefit other management agencies to help conserve these ancient fish that many people refer to as “living fossils.” The construction of dams on the Columbia River has fragmented Pacific White Sturgeon (Acipenser transmontanus) habitats, producing essentially isolated populations between mainstem impoundments.

Many seabird populations, including the iconic tufted puffin (<i>Fratercula cirrhata</i>), have significantly declined along the Oregon Coast over the past few decades. Oregon Islands, Three Arch Rocks, and Cape Meares National Wildlife Refuges are designated National Wilderness Areas set aside in part to promote the protection, stewardship, and enjoyment of Oregon’s seabird populations and their habitats in perpetuity. Currently, baseline monitoring data to support the adaptive management of seabirds and seabird habitat is sparse. Managers have little to no knowledge regarding how seabird habitat has changed over the last few decades, inadequate information about what characteristics constitute suitable habitat for some burrow-nesting seabirds, and are facing a lack of reliable baseline information on burrow occupancy and habitat use. The proposed research directly addresses these knowledge gaps by investigating the specific habitat requirements of tufted puffin, establishing a baseline of vegetative habitat dynamics, and developing a structured decision-making model. Assessing how suitable seabird breeding habitat characteristics have changed over time will provide necessary information to guide refuge managers in habitat restoration and support adaptive management decisions.

Incorporating climate, disease and invasive species into the conservation of a First Food, Klamath redband trout September 2024 This research will provide actionable science to incorporate the interacting threats of climate change, disease, and invasive species into conservation plans seeking to restore subsistence fisheries for the Klamath Tribes. To address specific knowledge gaps expressed by our partners, we will identify the redband trout habitats most susceptible to both invasive trout and the salmonid parasite Ceratonova shasta. In doing so we will evaluate an unrecognized ecosystem dynamic, in which native pathogens restrict the thermal niche of invasive species, conferring indirect benefits to a native fish.

Wildlife response to the 2020 Labor Day fires in the Oregon Cascade Mountains June 2024 In Oregon State and throughout the Pacific Northwest, there is an urgent need to document how wildlife species and their habitats recover from severe, large-scale fires. 2020 was an unprecedented wildfire season in western Oregon with five wildfires each exceeding 100,000 acres in size, all in the Cascade Mountains. Understanding how these large-scale disturbances influence wildlife resources in Oregon is extremely important for their conservation and management. To date, there is limited information on how wildlife have responded to these major fire events, primarily because megafires were not as abundant and did not present as great a challenge to the future of wildlife as they do now. With long-term projections of longer, hotter, drier summers, megafires may be inescapable. Understanding how wildlife recolonize areas with different burn intensities and management histories, the length of time it takes for population recovery, and what species fail to recolonize in wildfire affected areas will be extremely important for agencies to manage wildlife resources and for informing forest management practices. In 2021 and 2022, ODFW established 120 long-term monitoring sites (60 for Archie Creek and 60 for Beachie Creek) including trail camera units, audio recording units, and cover boards. Monitoring sites will be maintained for two full years, with continued monitoring at 5- to 10-year intervals conducted by ODFW. Habitat assessments using UAS and remotely sensed data will provide valuable information on vegetation response to fire and management practices near each monitoring site.

Improving outcomes for hatchery-reared Chinook salmon through microbiome monitoring and enhancement January 2024 Hatchery rearing and release programs have long been integral to salmon fisheries management as a way to supplement commercial and recreational harvests, and these programs have become increasingly important to fishers as wild stocks continue to decline. However, hatchery programs are also fraught with major challenges including poor hatchery fish performance. Improving the success of hatchery salmon and reducing the risks they present for wild populations could lead to greatly improved economic and ecological outcomes for Pacific salmon fisheries. This project directly addresses this management need by investigating the impacts of hatchery rearing on the microbial communities that populate the gastrointestinal (GI) tracts of Pacific salmon, specifically juvenile Chinook salmon. In salmonid species, the gut microbiome has shown potential as a useful tool for monitoring hatchery fish health and for reducing disease risk through probiotic enhancement. The goal of our research is to identify hatchery rearing practices that result in improved gut microbiomes for hatchery-reared juvenile salmon (i.e., gut microbiomes that are more likely to resemble those of wild fish). This information will inform hatchery management practices to improve disease resistance, enhance fitness, and potentially mitigate some of the negative effects of hatchery fish on wild populations by reducing disease transmission and competition. This work will be the first to address the causes and consequences of microbiome differences between hatchery and wild Pacific salmon and will lay the groundwork for future studies assessing the long-term effects of gut microbiome disruption on Pacific salmon populations.

Integrated population modeling to improve forecasting for coho salmon and steelhead returns and the status of their habitat in Oregon June 2024 We are using more than 20 years of salmonid monitoring data from the ODFW Aquatic Inventories project, Western Oregon Rearing Project, Salmonid Life Cycle Monitoring project, and Oregon Adult Salmonid Inventory and Sampling projects to 1) develop a population model that will assist ODFW and partner agencies in predicting adult returns of Oregon Coast coho salmon and steelhead populations, thus providing managers with improved forecasts to set fish harvest recommendations and 2) develop Oregon Coast coho and steelhead juvenile habitat models using remotely sensed and modeled covariates to describe the productivity and suitability of juvenile salmon habitat. These valuable tools will inform habitat and harvest management by allowing ODFW to anticipate adult salmon returns and to identify optimal instream habitats to which current and future management actions should be focused.

Native fish species distribution and population status in Goose Lake Basin, Oregon March 2027 The Goose Lake Basin is an endorheic desert valley that runs north-to-south on the border of Oregon and California. The Basin’s watersheds drain into Goose Lake—a slightly alkaline system that has historically dried up during severe drought years (e.g., 2015), and drains into the Pit River to the south during very high-flow years. There are several endemic fish species that occupy Goose Lake and its adjacent rivers, marshes, and riparian areas: the Goose Lake redband trout, Goose Lake lamprey, Goose Lake tui chub, and Goose Lake sucker. These endemic species coexist with a variety of native and non-native species. Because Goose Lake and its surrounding watershed are highly sensitive to drought conditions, an increased frequency of drought events in the region may limit the accessibility, quantity, and quality of available habitat for native fishes, thereby putting undue stress on vulnerable species. The goal of this project is to aid agency partners in conducting a population assessment for at-risk native species in Oregon’s closed lakes basin ecosystem and to determine which systems are most at risk of declining populations due to disturbances such as drought and invasive species. This research is timely because consistent surveys have not been conducted in many of Oregon’s high desert basins for more than a decade. Updated abundance and distribution estimates will inform state and federal managers as to the population status of at-risk native species, while the population risk assessment will support actionable management outcomes.

An assessment of post-restoration trajectories of geomorphological and vegetative change in the Nisqually River Delta, Washington June 2023 The Nisqually River Delta provides important feeding and rearing habitat for a variety of fish and wildlife. Between 1996 and 2009, the Nisqually Tribe and Billy Frank Jr. Nisqually National Wildlife Refuge collaborated to restore over 365 ha of estuarine habitat to tidal influence in the Delta for the benefit of juvenile Chinook salmon and other estuary-dependent species. Pre- and post-restoration monitoring datasets have highlighted clear increases in connectivity between the Nisqually River mainstem and the restored estuary, especially at mid-to-high tide; however, low-elevation areas in the most recent (2009) and most subsided restoration area have experienced relatively slow vegetation colonization and growth. In light of the decadal anniversary of the 2009 restoration, the Tribe, the Refuge, and USGS have collaborated to collect new data, including LIDAR imagery (2020), aerial photography (2019), SET (Surface Elevation Table) readings (2019, 2021), and vegetation surveys (2019, 2021) to supplement 2009-2015 monitoring datasets. These new data will facilitate a full evaluation of restoration progress using metrics of habitat connectivity, spatial analyses of sediment deposition and erosion, and vegetation colonization and growth. Results will inform future habitat management decisions to preserve and enhance habitat for sensitive fish and wildlife species.

Habitat Use and Survival of Ringtail in Southwest Oregon August 2023 The ringtail (<i>Bassariscus astutus</i>) is a small, secretive, omnivorous, nocturnal relative of the raccoon (<i>Procyon lotor</i>) that occurs in southwesthern Oregon, the most northern portion of the species range. Ringtail are listed as “Sensitive” and a Conservation Strategy species in Oregon with identified knowledge gaps including the need for an assessment of the species distribution and abundance, and basic information on habitat use and selection across all life stages. In collaboration with Oregon Department of Fish and Wildlife, this project focused on estimating annual and seasonal survival rates, home range size, movement patterns and vegetation characteristics of home ranges and den sites for ringtail in Oregon. These data will aid in the development of a large-scale monitoring program for ringtail in Oregon, and add to our basic understanding of ringtail ecology and demographics at the most northern edge of their distribution.

Large Downed Wood as Post-fire Refugia for Terrestrial Salamanders in Pacific Northwest Forests August 2023 Downed wood on the forest floor does more than provide habitat for amphibians, reptiles, birds and mammals. These decomposing habitat structures modify the temperature and moisture conditions in the forest itself. Inside and around downed wood, local climate conditions, or microclimates, provide wildlife with stable habitats that allow for persistence during and after wildfires. Cooler, wetter microclimates buffer the effects of wildfire in Oregon’s forests, making microclimate an important component of forest management. Despite the significance of downed wood to forest ecosystem function, forest management practices require only two downed logs to be retained for every acre harvested. To better inform forest management and species conservation efforts, it is vital that we better understand the role of downed wood in post-fire recovery of forest-dependent species. We propose a three-year study that explores the relationship between downed wood, microclimate, and wildfire on terrestrial salamander diversity. Terrestrial salamanders are sensitive to environmental change, dependent on moist habitats, and are strongly associated with downed wood. We will compare salamander diversity and abundance in forests that vary in time since fire in forests across western Oregon, capturing the inherent climate variation from the moist northern end to the drier southern end of the state. We will relate salamander presence and abundance with microclimates associated with downed wood, expecting to find more salamanders, including rare and threatened species, in forests with cooler, wetter microclimates. In areas with recent, high severity fire, we expect downed wood to facilitate salamander persistence, particularly in the drier forests of southern Oregon. This research will provide managers with important information on the quantity and quality of downed wood needed to maintain microclimate conditions that can protect and buffer forests from the ever-increasing threat of climate-driven wildfires. By modifying the temperature and moisture conditions in the forest itself, downed wood in forest ecosystems provide wildlife with local climate conditions, or microclimates, that allow for persistence during and after wildfires. To better inform forest management and species conservation efforts, it is vital that we better understand the role of downed wood in post-fire recovery of forest-dependent species. In collaboration with Oregon State University and the Northwest Climate Science Adaptation Center, we propose a three-year study that explores the relationship between downed wood, microclimate, and wildfire on terrestrial salamander diversity. Terrestrial salamanders are sensitive to environmental change, dependent on moist habitats, and are strongly associated with downed wood. This research will provide managers with important information on the quantity and quality of downed wood needed to maintain microclimate conditions that can protect and buffer forests from the ever-increasing threat of climate-driven wildfires. Chinook salmon passage and recovery on the Willamette River September 2024 Willamette River basin adult spring-run Chinook salmon (<i>Oncorhynchus tshawytscha</i>) are prevented from returning to their historic spawning grounds by large dams managed jointly by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE), Bonneville Power Administration, and Bureau of Reclamation. In response, USACE and Oregon Department of Fish and Wildlife biologists initiated an adult transportation program in the 1990’s with an objective of facilitating natural spawning of these populations above the dams. Unfortunately, annual rates of pre-spawn mortality (PSM) in adult Chinook salmon transported upstream of dams are high (often >40%), and could limit the ability to establish a natural population of spring Chinook if not reduced. The progeny of these outplanted adults face similar downstream passage difficulties that is further complicated by very high parasitic infection rates (>90%) of a native copepod (<i>Salmincola californiensis</i>). The infections affect the ability of outmigrating juvenile to swim, withstand stressors, and survive in saltwater during their ocean transition. This is an integrated project whose ultimate goal is the safe passage of juvenile and adult spring-run Chinook salmon to assist in the recovery of this listed stock. Stream fragmentation and water development are among the greatest threats facing Chinook Salmon in the Pacific Northwest.<br><br>Recovery of this iconic species will require the development of effective fish passage strategies to facilitate juvenile and adult passage to and from their historic spawning grounds.<br><br>This project is a collaboration of an interdisciplinary team of researchers and managers from USGS, USACE, Pacific Northwest National Laboratory, Oregon State University, and Oregon Department of Fish and Wildlife.<br><br>Water resource managers will be provided with the information needed to develop safe and efficient passage systems for juvenile and adult Chinook salmon. The development of integrated adaptive management for restoration of freshwater-estuarine ecosystems December 2025 California Central Valley is the largest basin-estuary comoplex on the Pacific Coast that supports more than 500 fish, wildlife and plant species. It is also the home of millions of people that depend on the freshwater resources of the area . By its nature , the management of water resources in the Central Valley involves the evaluation of potential tradeoffs between conservation objectives, such as restoring or conserving at-risk species, and other values, such as providing reliable water supply to the public. This can result in conflict among competing objectives making the decision-making difficult. We are integrating management, science, and monitoring using the structured decision making process to develop an adaptive framework for restoration of aquatic ecosystems. Most natural resource problems are complex, and decision makers and stakeholders often disagree on the best decision. The process by which decision makers traditionally arrive at decisions also tends to be difficult to explain, which in turn makes it difficult to communicate the decision-making process to stakeholders and the general public resulting in conflict.<br><br>A structured adaptive, approach can help mitigate these problems and reduce their effect by fostering better communication and knowledge transfer and facilitator the integration of new information for improved decision making.<br><br>This project is a collaboration with researchers and managers in multiple state and federal agencies including the US Fish and Wildlife Service, the US Bureau of Reclamation, the National Marine Fisheries Service CA Department of Fish and Wildlife, CA Delartment of Water Resources, non-governmental organizations, and local municipalities operating in the Central Valley.<br><br>Structured decision making process has allowed decision makers to develop and evaluate restoration strategies, identify factors that largely drive restoration decision-making helping them focus on those aspects that are most important and prioritize research and monitoring to reduce critical uncertainties and improve decision making. The development and evaluation of monitoring protocols to inform water resource decision making December 2022 Natural resource managers invest a considerable amount of resources on surveillance monitoring programs to track the distribution and abundance of species. Although these data can be useful when evaluating spatial and temporal trends for populations, using these data directly assumes the population dynamics signal is greater than the noise in the data that stems from the sampling process. This assumption is frequently unmet. An equally important consideration is the integration of monitoring and natural resource decision-making. Here we are evaluating the adequacy of long term monitoring data from San Francisco Bay-Delta to depict the status of fish populations and developing alternative estimators that can be integrated with water resource decision-making. Effective water resources management requires depends upon the quality of monitoring and research data.<br><br>Unfortunately, the adequacy of sampling protocols are rarely assessed. Managers need reliable and cost-efficient survey protocols that are formally integrated with management decision-making.<br><br>This project is a collaboration with researchers in multiple federal agencies including the US Fish and Wildlife Service, the US Bureau of Reclamation, the National Marine Fisheries Service and CA State and Federal managers in the San Francisco Bay Delta.<br><br>The quality of existing long-term monitoring data will be evaluated. Alternative sample designs and estimators that are integrated with water management decision making will be developed and evaluated. These data will then be integrated with decision support models. Integrating monitoring, modeling, and management for amphibian conservation in the western United States September 2021 Amphibians play an important role in ecosystems, providing a critical link in the food web across aquatic and terrestrial habitats and used as indicator species to gauge overall ecosystem health. However, there is an accumulation of evidence that amphibian communities are facing global declines in abundance and diversity. Although these declines are related to a suite of interrelated factors, habitat modification is the most implicated source of amphibian declines. The strong link between habitat modification and loss of amphibians is probably related to the complex life cycle of amphibians, where individuals rely on both aquatic and terrestrial habitats to meet life history demands. We are developing a framework for integrating information from monitoring, remote sensing, and research to better information managers in the Pacific Northwest. Amphibians are the most threatened class of vertebrates. Global declines in amphibians are related to a variety of factors including habitat, climate change, disease, contaminants, and invasive species.<br><br>As nongame vertebrates, amphibians received little direct research or management until the last few decades when declines became well documented and recognized. An integrated, adaptive framework is needed in the Pacific Northwest for identifying information gaps and developing management strategies for amphibians and their habitats.<br><br>The project is a collaboration of researchers across multiple agencies and includes the USGS Forest and Rangeland Ecosystem Science Center and State and Federal natural resource managers in the Pacific Northwest.<br><br>A useful decision-making model will be developed that will reasonably approximate the complex life cycle of amphibians while balancing the complexity with available information. The model will integrate subsequent amphibian monitoring data to reduce uncertainty about the factors affecting amphibians and their habitats and to improve reliability of the model predictions. Assessing the value of prior and novel information in managing a mixed-stock recreational Chinook Salmon fishery June 2021 Mixed-stock fisheries are systems that consist of multiple populations of fish with sizes amenable to resource management and are harvested simultaneously. When different stocks have varying levels of abundance, productivity, and vulnerability to fishing pressure, fishery managers often are faced with the competing objectives of protecting the more vulnerable stocks while maximizing sustainable harvest on remaining healthy stocks. The challenges associated with managing a mixed-stock fishery are typified by the Columbia River fall-run Chinook fishery at the mouth. The fishery includes numerous fall-run stocks with eight separate fall-run management components, including two protected stocks: Snake River wild brights and Lower Columbia River tules. The recreational fishery is an important economic benefit to the surrounding communities, generating over $25M/year depending on season length.To further complicate the management, a growing number of the recreational anglers believe that they can identify tule Chinook from upriver brights and purport to release an unknown portion of their catch (those identified as tules) to ensure that the season is open as long as possible. Thus, management of the fishery requires reliable estimates of in-season harvest, while taking into account changes in angler behavior. Our objectives are to develop the tools (including novel assessment methods and regulatory options) and systemic understanding necessary to promote effective management of the mixed-stock fishery in the face of existing conservation priorities and changing angler behavior. Mixed-stock fisheries are notoriously difficult to manage. When different stocks have varying levels of abundance, productivity, and vulnerability to fishing pressure, fishery managers often are faced with the competing objectives of protecting the more vulnerable stocks while maximizing sustainable harvest on remaining healthy stocks.<br><br>The efficacy of mixed-stock fishery management is challenged by the degree of uncertainty in preseason run size forecasts, creel surveys, and tagging data to assess in-season exploitation rates for the different management stocks and changes in angling behavior. An integrated approach is needed to incorporate these sources of information to more effectively manage mixed stock fisheries.<br><br>The project is a collaboration with State and Federal natural resource managers in the Columbia River Basin.<br><br>The goal of this study to develop the tools (including novel assessment methods and regulatory options) and systemic understanding necessary to promote effective management of the a mixed-stock fishery in the face of existing conservation priorities and changing angler behavior. Adaptively Manageing Instream Flows for Ecological Needs August 2020 Sustaining the ecological integrity of aquatic ecosystems while meeting human needs for water resources is a major challenge facing today’s society. In many regions, including much of the western US, the growing demand for water supply and energy and increased human development have altered hydrologic regimes in streams and rivers that society depends upon for ecosystem services, including support of native biodiversity. Meeting the challenge of balancing human needs for water resources with protecting aquatic ecosystems requires the identification of management objectives and the integration of science-based information to help managers evaluate tradeoffs and identify optimal management strategies. Here we are working with managers and scientists to develop a framework for informing flow management in the Willamette River Basin. Stream flow regulation is one of the most important issues facing natural resource managers and planners. Aquatic resource managers need tools for assessing the potential impacts of river regulation and water development on ecological systems.<br><br>Several tools have been developed for assessing the effects of streamflow alteration but none have been integration with decision making and monitoring to reduce critical uncertainties.

Fire refugia in late-successional forests: Predicting habitat persistence to support land management in an era of rapid global change June 2021 Recent stand-replacing wildfires in late-successional and old-growth and the threat of increasing wildfire extent and severity predicted under climate change for the US Pacific Northwest (PNW), have increased land manager interest in fire refugia in late-successional and old-growth (LSOG) forests. Forest fire refugia (i.e., places that remain unburned or experience minimal tree mortality compared to surrounding areas) - are key components of contemporary burn mosaics, and can provide vital habitat for threatened and endangered species, including northern spotted owl, marbled murrelet and red tree voles. However, conservation practitioners lack information on which locations are protected from, versus vulnerable to, high-severity, stand-replacing fire. Contemporary refugia have been identified as priority locations for biodiversity conservation and climate change adaptation strategies at both regional and national scales. However, little is known about the predictability of LSOG forest fire refugia in the PNW.The overall goal of this project is to work with land managers to produce maps of the probability of contemporary fire refugia and stand-replacing fire in LSOG forests based on topography, fuels, fire weather, and climate. Leveraging the skills and expertise of a collaborative research team from OSU, USDA FS-PNW, USGS-FRESC, and USGS-CRU, we will model, map, and share information essential for the conservation of LSOG forest ecosystems in the PNW. These maps and associated products will provide timely information about the likely persistence and loss of LSOG forests under current and future climate conditions.
