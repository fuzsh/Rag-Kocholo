Jeanette was the oldest of four siblings; Sidney was the second of four brothers. Joseph was named for his paternal grandfather, Joseph Knee, who emigrated from Austria in the early 1900s and for his uncle, Leonard (Louie), Sidneys younger brother, who was killed at the end of WWII when, as bombardier over Japan, his plane crashed on its way home.\n\nJoes mom, Jeanette, was a homemaker and part-time bookkeeper. Dad, Sidney, had been a professional basketball player and court stenographer prior to WWII. After serving in the army in England and France during the war, Dad continued on in career employment as a civilian auditor for the U.S. Army. Mom passed away in 1987 at age 70, having been ill for many years.\n\nDad passed away in 2004 at age 91. He had been ever the athlete and Joe and Dad shared a close bond and the enjoyment of sports together, especially tennis and golf, for decades.\n\nJoe attended P.S. 217, Ditmas J.H.S., and Midwood H.S. in Brooklyn until dads job took the family first to Yokohama, Japan, when Joe was eleven, in what was then, still American Occupied Japan. Later, the family would move to France and Germany. Joes schooling was, therefore, multiply interrupted, but was, nevertheless, a pivotal and wonderful part of his life.\n\nThe familys move to Verdun, France, when Joe was fifteen and, later, to Orleans, had a profound impact on the whole family - especially Joe. His love of history began in that small northeast corner of France where, right next to the familys small apartment building at the end of a single lane road across from a farm with mooing cows, was a warning sign in French which read, CAUTION! You are prohibited from digging in this area. There may still be unexploded ordinance buried here from WWI. There was, as yet no TV or phone service whatsoever in the area, and it would be several months before the family would even have a car, so Joe got used to walking or running anywhere he wanted or needed to go, other than school. As a result, and to everyones delight, Joe made the track team during that, his junior year in high school! Clearly, in 1962, the family had landed somewhere really far from Brooklyn!\n\nThe following year, the family moved to Orleans, approximately an hour and a half south of Paris. Joe loved Orleans and in 1964, he graduated from Orleans American High School where he had developed not only several lifelong friendships, but his strongest and fondest memories. This truly beautiful cosmopolitan city, which Joan of Arc had saved from the English in 1429, had now also captured Joes heart.\n\nJoe attended the University of Maryland extension in Munich for two years, as the family was now residing in Germany. He subsequently transferred to the colleges main campus in College Park, Maryland, where he met his future wife, Rochelle Snee. Joe shared some harrowing stories about protesting the war in Vietnam, still raging at the time. He graduated in 1968 with an undergraduate degree in Asian History.\n\nJoe and Rochelle married in 1977, and while embarking on their respective careers, they spent many of those early years together, traveling through Europe, the Middle East, and North Africa. Rochelle became a professor of Classics, Greek and Latin. Joe completed a graduate degree in Public Administration and Finance at the University of Washington in Seattle where the two finally settled.\n\nJoe worked for decades in an administrative/finance capacity for the City of Seattle and spent many of those same years actively involved in Democratic politics. Joe was a hard-core Democrat and maintained friendships with his like-minded political and work buddies until the end.\n\nJoe loved the Pacific Northwest. He cultivated a beautiful garden at their home in Burien. He was especially proud of his palm and kiwi trees. The spectacular view of Mt. Rainier and South Puget Sound from their home gave Joe and Rochelle many years of pleasure. Inside, Joes great green thumb was always at work developing beautiful plants, some of epic size.\n\nWhile Joe was, in fact, a longtime Washingtonian, he was, nevertheless, never far from his roots. He was always the Jewish kid from Brooklyn who craved a really good bagel, an authentic New York pastrami sandwich or a genuine knish from Coney Island. Joe wasnt religious, but always ended phone conversations, short or long, with his sister, Alice, with the Yiddish expression, Sei Gesund! (Go in Health).\n\nRochelle passed away in Sept. 2020. Joe suffered a bout with Covid and slowly declined in health. He was, however, wont to enjoy a good meal with good friends. He cherished the knick-knacks and paintings he and Rochelle had collected over the years and, took contentment in his librarys worth of history books he would knowingly never read, but from which he also could never part. Toward the end, Joe watched classic movies and mysteries, sitting in his favorite Adirondack chair, always recommending the foreign ones he knew Alice would appreciate. He delighted in fixing up the house he intended to age in. The Mediterranean wall colors made him happy.\n\nJoe had a more than wonderful sense of humor. He had a most generous heart and delighted in story-telling and always giving gifts with meaning. His generosity, to all who knew him, was only matched in magnitude by his trademark ubiquitous over-sized hats. Joe will be terribly missed by all who knew and loved him.\n\nJoes dear friend, Cassidy Summer, has been increasingly and unceasingly helpful to and supportive of Joe during what was to be his final few years and, for that, his family is ever grateful.\n\nJoe is survived by his sister, Alice Miller and her husband, Fredric Miller, and his niece, Melissa Miller and nephew, Jonathan Miller, as well as by twelve cousins.\n\nJoes ashes will be laid to rest beside the Loire River in Orleans, France.\n\nDonations, should you wish to honor Joes life: World Central Kitchen or Greenpeace\n\nCondolences to: Alice Miller\n\n2040 Winding Brook Way\n\nScotch Plains, New Jersey 07076\n\n30 May 2022 CANDACE \"CANDY\" ROGERS Reynolds ('65) on May 23, 2022 in Alpharetta, Georgia.

Partlow Jr: husband, dad, grandpa, friend, army officer, entrepreneur, and author died peacefully on Friday, November 20 in Allen, Texas at the age of 82.\n\nFrank is survived by the love of his life: his wife of 60 years, Kay Partlow of Texas; his daughters: Michele Caruso of New Jersey and Tamara Sakuda of Texas; his sons in law: Jim Caruso of New Jersey and Kent Sakuda of Texas; his brother: Jerry Partlow of California; his sister and brother in law, Mada and Jim Henderson of North Carolina; his grandchildren: Chelsie and James Caruso of New Jersey and Emily Zoscak and Cody Sakuda of Texas; his nieces: Jennifer Ruiz of Germany, Katie Nygren of North Carolina, and Jennifer Hartsook Howell of Ohio; and his nephew: David Hartsook of Ohio.\n\nFrank was preceded in death by his parents: Frank and Nina Partlow of California and his sister, Rosa Hartsook of Ohio.\n\nFrank was born on September 1 in San Francisco, California to Nina and Frank Partlow. He graduated from the United States Military Academy at West Point, NY with a BS in Engineering in June of 1960 where he was known for his love of baseball and pitched for the Army West Point baseball team. He was then commissioned to serve in the United States Army as a 2nd Lieutenant. Frank married Kay Sunderman, his high school sweetheart, at Ft. Benning, GA in November of 1960. He met Kay when she was a sophomore in high school. He often said, \"It may not have been love at first sight, but whatever it was, it has lasted over 60 years.\" Frank then began his 30-year career serving in the United States Army. As a decorated veteran, his career highlights included stints at West Point as an assistant professor and baseball coach; tours of duty in Vietnam and Cambodia; an assignment as General Ed Rowny's executive officer in Brussels, command posts at Fort Lewis, WA and Ft. Leonardwood, Mo; Chief of Staff Multinational Force and Observers, Sinai, Egypt; and the Joint Chiefs of Staff Representative to the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces (INF) Treaty process where he worked under the direction of General Colin Powell. His military career also included earning his MA in European Studies from Stanford and being a Senior Fellow at Harvard University.\n\nNot one to sit still for very long, Frank then went on to a second career by starting the consulting firm Northern Nevada Network. His work focused on providing information about state and local government for local businesses to support growth in his beloved Reno, NV where he and Kay chose to retire. However, Frank was always dedicated to serving his country, so in 2002, when he was asked to lead the strategic turnaround of the Government Printing Office as its Chief of Staff, he readily accepted. On June 4, 2004, the United States House of Representatives formally recognized Frank's contributions with an official proclamation of his service. Frank was also an adjunct professor at University of Nevada, newspaper columnist, and the author of 5 books. In addition, Frank devoted time in Reno to volunteering in school literacy programs.\n\nOutside of work, Frank was dedicated to his wife and family. Holidays and vacations were important ways for him to connect with his loved ones. He always made time for his 4 grandchildren even dedicating a book to them. In addition, when reflecting on his life and career, Frank commented, \"intolerance is the flip side of moral courage and folks can respect your leadership without always liking the way you exercise it.\" He will be remembered as someone who was \"Frank by name and by nature.\"\n\nHis family plans to lovingly honor and celebrate Frank's life when a service can be safely scheduled in 2021.\n\nDonations honoring Frank's life can be sent to the United Service Organization, USO. (https://www.uso.org/) The USO works to strengthen military service members by keeping them connected to family throughout their service to our country.\n\n12 DEC 2020 CHERYL SWANNACK ('64) on 15 March 2020 in Washington, DC.

Obituary from DignityMemorial.Com follows:\n\n8 May 2020 LEA HORNE Loftis ('65) on 10 April 2020 in Winston-Salem, North Carolina. Her obituary reads as follows:\n\nLowry Lea Loftis, 73, passed away at her home on Saturday, April 11, 2020. She was born in Amarillo, TX, the firstborn child of Col. Carlton R. Horne and Mrs. Arleen M. Horne. Granny Lea would want you to know that, above all else, she loved her grandchildren most in the world and would gladly do anything within her power to make them happy. Which she did, regularly and without regard to what their mothers had to say about it.\n\nShe was the older sister to Holly Behen and Steve Horne and was by far the most responsible of the bunch. Being the oldest \"brat\" in a military family meant that she was expected to be a model of exemplary behavior wherever they moved, all over the world. And she was, except for the singular occasion she skipped school while a teenager in France. To be fair, that shouldn't even count against her because she went to the library, for heaven's sake. (Her love of books was the only thing that could have driven her to be so impetuous).\n\nIf you had the great fortune to know her, you will agree that she was the best-read person you knew. She was an unapologetic book hoarder and staunch opponent of e-readers and digital books of any kind. She loved the heft and feel of honest-to-god ink on paper.\n\nMom was a traveler; she adored the prospect of learning the history and culture of each place she visited. At any destination, she would arrive prepared to throw herself (and others) fully into whatever adventures were afoot. A lifelong gourmand, she carefully picked the restaurants she most wanted to explore on these trips. If you were lucky enough to be a traveling companion, you were assured a dining experience you weren't likely to forget; ranging from the most elegant places to the most obscure holes-in-the-wall. Then, when she arrived home, she often searched out the recipes she had just tasted and re-created them in her own kitchen for friends and family.\n\nIf you were interested in talking - or arguing! - politics, Mom was more than happy to oblige. These conversations/debates could go on for hours and days, and she loved every hot-blooded minute of it. She believed in the need for us all to always consider \"the greater good\". That empathy drove her to become a lifelong activist, supporting the causes she cared most about, especially women's issues. She was a constant volunteer, sponsor, fundraiser extraordinaire, and friend to the YWCA and championed their mission always.\n\nMom was the best friend you could have hoped for. Her kindness, thoughtfulness, empathy, and support made her countless friends wherever she went. Her friends hailed from every facet of her life and she kept those bonds throughout the course of her remarkable existence. There would be no way to list all those who called her a dear friend, but her two longest friendships were also the ones most precious to her: our beloved honorary Aunts, Janice and Joyce. They were one another's confidantes and co-conspirators for fifty years, and we just counted ourselves lucky to be in their presence.\n\nMom fell in love with her husband Randy after we moved to Winston-Salem when mutual friends from Morganton set them up on a blind date. That was 36 years ago, so we think they must have clicked. They built a lovely life together in an old house which they treasured.\n\nOur mom was quite simply our favorite person. We knew that she would do anything for us, and she often did. We are left with a million memories of her - her laugh, her voice, her smile, and especially her twinkling grey-green eyes.\n\nShe is survived by her husband, Randy Loftis; her daughters, Elizabeth Brown (John) and Dana Stallings (James); and six grandchildren whom she loved most of all, Sean Loftis, Liam Loftis, Quinn and Georgia Stallings, and John Parker and Mason Brown.\n\nWe know you can't capture an entire person in one obituary (even one this long), but we've tried to honor her by recognizing at least some parts of her amazing life. We'd love to hear your memories of her too - please feel free to send us your memories, stories, and pictures. We want to keep her with us in that way.\n\nWe plan to honor mom's life at a later date, when she can be properly celebrated.\n\n**In lieu of flowers, please consider a donation to the Gateway YWCA, Heifer International, or any organization that works for the \"greater good\".

Pat then went on to co-found Green & Associates in Roanoke and worked there for 25 years until its sale in 2001. He took great pleasure in support of his university, the Moss Arts Center, and school football and basketball teams. Pat was active in the Hokie Club for many years and was a Golden Hokie and a member of the Legacy Society. He made a number of lifelong friends through his fraternity, Pi Kappa. Pat retired as a lieutenant colonel with over 25 years of service in the United States Army, the U.S. Army Reserves, and the Virginia Army National Guard. He served in the Vietnam War. Pat was active in a number of organizations that support the active and retired military.

For his work with the MOAA-Virginia Leadership team in 2006  2007, the Virginia General Assembly recognized Pat with an award presented by the Governor. The Rotary Club of Roanoke Valley was very important to Pat. He enjoyed the friendships he there through 30 years of membership. Pat enthusiastically participated in their many activities from attending a district conference to picking up trash along side of their adopted roadway. He served the club as president in the early years and later led a group exchange trip to Bangladesh. Pat was a Paul Harris Fellow who tried to live his life according to the Rotary motto of, \"service above self,\" as much as possible. Pat served a term as president of the local chapter of the Sons of the American Revolution (SAR). In 1997 he was recognized for his service as a fellow of the Thomas C. Sorensen Institute for Political Leadership at the University of Virginia. Pat was a member of St. John's Episcopal Church. There he was on a Sunday usher team and volunteered with the interfaith hospitality program regularly. He was proud to have completed the four-year Education For Ministry (EFM) course offered by the School of Theology at The University of the South.

Her obituary from the Bryn Athyn College website reads as follows:\n\nCommunity\n\nDr. Jane Williams-Hogan, 75, Professor and Scholar\n\nDr. Jane Williams-Hogan, Professor of Sociology at Bryn Athyn College, and the leading international scholar of the life and influence of 18th century scientist and theologian Emanuel Swedenborg, passed away on Sunday February 11th of cancer.\n\nJane Williams-Hogan was born Jane Kintner in Abington, PA on October 26th 1942, the daughter of Lt. Colonel William R. Kintner and Xandree Hyatt Kintner. When she was born her father was serving in WWII, and she did not meet him until she was 2 years old. Their family moved almost every year with Colonel Kintners postings, living for a time in Virginia, Washington D.C., Pennsylvania, and Orleans, France.\n\nDr. Williams-Hogan attended University of Pennsylvania for all of her degrees, graduating in 1964 with a BA in English and in 1969 with a Masters Degree in Human Relations. She was awarded a PhD in Sociology in 1985 for her dissertation: A New Church in a Disenchanted World: A Study of the Formation and Development of the General Conference of the New Church in Great Britain. This work began her long career of distinguished scholarship in religious studies and sociology of religion.\n\nShe was hired as an instructor at the Bryn Athyn College in 1975, and was named a professor there in 2003. She held the Paul Carpenter Chair of History of Religions at that college from 1997-2011. She established the Masters Program in Religious Studies at the Bryn Athyn College, and served as the advisor and then director of that program for many years. In addition she held many key administrative roles at Bryn Athyn College, always working to expand the reach and vision of the school. Most importantly, she taught generations of students at the college, and was well-loved as a teacher and a mentor.\n\nIn 1988 she chaired the landmark SS88 Swedenborg Symposium in Bryn Athyn, PA, the first major international symposium focused on the influence of Emanuel Swedenborg on 19th and 20th century thought. She brought together scholars who discussed the impact Swedenborg had on artists and thinkers such as William Blake, Immanuel Kant, Henry James, Sr., George Innes and many others. Jane edited the proceedings of this conference, which were published in 1998 in the volume Swedenborg and His Influence.\n\nThese connections led to the establishment of a Swedenborg Seminar at the American Academy of Religion annual conference from 1993-1997, which Dr. Williams-Hogan chaired. She became an in-demand presenter at conferences and symposiums, and authored the entries on Emanuel Swedenborg in the Encyclopedia of Religion, Religions of the World: a Comprehensive Encyclopedia of Beliefs and Practices, and several other publications. She became an important voice in CESNUR, the Center for Studies on New Religions, presenting papers at the annual conferences and chairing conferences and panels for them.\n\nShe continued to work at a furious pace to the end of her life, and last June, 9 months after her diagnosis with cancer, she chaired the very successful Swedenborg and the Arts conference at Bryn Athyn College. This conference brought together 40 scholars from around the world to discuss Swedenborgs influence on painting, poetry, architecture and literature.\n\nJane was married to Michael Hogan for 35 years, and had 6 children. Her son Daniel predeceased her in 1998. She is survived by her husband Michael; her sisters Kay and Gail and brother Carl; her children Kira, Michael, Jacob, Berith and Joshua; and 15 grandchildren.\n\nHer influence on the community of scholars of religious studies, on her students and community, and on her family is immense. She will be dearly missed.\n\n3 August 2018 BOB HARTYE ('64) on 14 April 2018, in Houston, Texas. His obituary from integrityfuneral.com reads as follows:\n\nRobert Albert (Bob) Hartye, Jr., 71, of Puerto Vallarta, Mexico, passed away peacefully Saturday, April 14, 2018 in Houston, Texas from complications following heart surgery.\n\nBob Hartye was born November 21, 1946 in Irvington, New Jersey, the second of four children to Bob and Helen Hartye. An Army brat, Bob got to grow up around the world  from his early years in New York, Virginia, Pennsylvania, and Yokohama, Japan to his high school years in Orleans, France - all of which began to shape his appreciation for lifes rich experiences.\n\nMoving back to the states, Bob married high school sweetheart Christine Hartye (Philquist) in 1966 and graduated from Texas A&M University with a degree in Math. Their son Robert Albert Hartye III was born in Indianapolis in 1969, just before Bob deployed overseas with the US Army where he attained the rank of Captain and would gain some early career experience in computer data processing systems and logistics.\n\nFrom his Army years in Zweibrucken, Germany in the early 1970s, to civilian life in Colorado Springs and Denver, Colorado, and later Puerto Vallarta, Mexico, Bob cultivated lifelong friendships and memorable times with family members. Among his special legacies are his absolute love of life, laughter, and experiences, telling a good story or joke (like nobody else can), music, movies, fishing, dancing and singing....to name just a few. He truly cared about keeping in touch with all the people in his life.\n\nBob and Lisa Hartye (Pagaza) were married in Puerto Vallarta in 1997 and soon built a rich life together in the PV bay area and gained a unique expertise in the local real estate market while working with Coldwell Banker and later with their own firm. Together, Bob & Lisa became welcoming ambassadors to their town for friends and family, and made new friends all the time. They traveled as often as they could to Europe, particularly France, as well as across the US to regularly stay with family and friends. At home, they loved enjoying gourmet dinners or getting together almost daily with friends around town - and Bob could always be counted on to get up and sing a song with the band or piano player anywhere there was music. And if there was a group of people laughing and having a genuinely good time in a restaurant or poolside in PV, its a good bet Bob Hartye was at the epicenter of it.\n\nBob is survived by his wife Lisa of Puerto Vallarta, son Robert (Bobby) Hartye III and his wife Valerie Morgan, two grandsons, William Hartye and Wyatt Hartye, all of Houston, two sisters, Carolyn Dorman and her husband Charlie (Chuck) Dorman of Snow Hill, MD, and Connie Merrell and her husband Dean Merrell of Branson, MO, and his beloved nephews and nieces.\n\nBobs rich life will be celebrated at a private party with family and friends on Monday 4/23 in Houston as well as in Puerto Vallarta upon Lisas return home.\n\n25 July 2018 BRUCE ANDERSON ('64) on October 29, 2016 in Deland, Florida.

We all know how people come and go in our Brat lives. Gayle came and went in mine. We met the first time in Beppu, Japan, when we were little girls about 8 years old. I had blonde braids; Gayle had black curls. She used to tell me I was mean to her then. We met again in Orleans when we were teenagers, and we were friends. Years sped by. She went to nursing school and worked as an RN. She married and had a big family, lovely girls who swirled around on holidays and birthdays and were one of Gayle's greatest joys. A few years ago Gayle and Lee Brubaker (also OHS '57) were married. Those of us who knew them in Orleans silently said \"finally,\" remembering how crazy they were about each other in those long-ago days. I wish their late-in-life happiness had lasted longer. I wish Gayle hadn't had stage IV breast cancer (and a drug trial that saved her life but brought its own set of problems). I wish so many things, and wish them with such passion that sometimes I forget to celebrate the wonder of it all. And she was a wonder, my ol' friend Gayle. She died on Friday, May 18, 2018. I am going to miss her. I think I already do. The pictures are of Gayle in Orleans, about 1955.\n\n18 April 2018 DONALD R. \"RICK\" BLOYER, JR. ('65) on April 13, 2018 in Henderson, Nevada.

I was informed by her brother-in-law, George Rotblut, on 28 July 2017, that Martine died from cancer. She had worked at Trinity University. The following, heart-felt rememberance of Martine was provided by her daughter, Jessica Myers Marcum:\n\nMy mother married Gerald E. Myers, an Aerospace Engineer originally from Ohio. They lived and travelled throughout Asia, hosting parties, playing bridge, and enjoying each other and their surroundings. Bruce Myers was born in 1971 and Jessica Myers was born in 1975, and life became a little more domestic. Eventually, we moved to the United States in 1978 because my parents wanted to provide more stability for us, than moving every time my father had a new assignment in a different part of the world. My father continued to work overseas, coming home as often as possible, leaving my mother to spend most of her time on her own, raising children and running a household. When we first arrived in the U.S., we moved to California, then to New Jersey, then to New York. Over this time, my mother continued her passion for reading and developed an intense love of professional sports: football, basketball, baseball, tennis. My mom would keep statistics on all of the sports and the teams and their players, every weekend filling her notebooks with numbers and facts. However, as my brother and I grew older and more independent, she was able to pursue more of her interests so my mother joined a bridge club. She became so advanced, that she began attending bridge tournaments throughout NY, and was quite successful. If mom wasnt watching sports or playing bridge then it must have been summer because then she could sunbathe in the hot sun! She loved to relax in the heat of the sun!\n\nIn the summer of 1990 we moved to San Antonio, and my brother went to Marquette University to study law. Her whole life, my mother said she wished she could get paid to be around books. Since I was high school aged, Mom was content to rejoin the workforce. She applied to be a Librarian at Trinity University, and got the job! She finally had her dream job, she found some friends to start playing bridge with, and my mother was able to rediscover herself, after devoting so much time to her family.\n\nAs lifes paths changed directions so did my parents paths -they divorced in 1993. The next year, I was in college, and I moved to Ohio to care for my ailing father. Within weeks of my arrival, my father passed away from cancer. My mother stayed in Texas and remarried a year later in 1995, to a man named Timothy Roseland. They spent the remainder of their lives in San Antonio, very much in love.\n\nMy mother was having a blast! She lived near her parents in the warmth of the Texas sun, she was getting paid to be with her books, in love, and enjoying another stage of life. However, her enjoyment didnt last long enough. My mother fell sick, and passed away from cancer in 1999, just weeks before my wedding. If she were alive today, my mom could enjoy her three grandchildren: my daughter Sydney, now 15 years old, my son Robert now 13 years old, and the latest addition: Bruces daughter born in winter of 2017, and her name is Phoebe Thomas Martine.\n\nMy mother was very gentle, sweet, and accepting of everyone, almost to a flaw. She didnt try to impose her beliefs on others, nor did she discourage anyone from believing in what was true to them. That is of course, unless the game was on and someone was rooting for the other team .

David had been taking ROTC at the school, and because of this was drafted to serve in Panama, along the canal, moving ordinance with donkeys over the rough terrain. He was given this assignment because he played polo at the U of I and was able to ride horses, hopefully donkeys too.

C.\n\nBefore David left for Panama, he married his high school sweetheart, Emily L. Ruth from Urbana. Emily passed away in 1988. He is survived by his son Hugh & Alicia (Wilson) Mulliken, daughter Amanda (De Witt) Mulliken, three granddaughters, two grandsons, and three great grandchildren.\n\nDavid had a wonderful life doing what he liked without hurting others. He had few demands in terms of material wealth and truly mastered the art of zen without know what zen is. A man of few demands he excelled in many things during his life, enjoying every minute to its fullest.\n\nA Memorial Service will be held on Saturday February 18, 2017 at 11:00 A.M. at the \"The Meadows \" Gathering Room at Scandia Village in Sister Bay, WI.\n\n27 MAR 2017 NANCY MALOY Bozenhard ('66) on March 9, 2017 in Limington, Maine.\n\n11 FEB 2017 JANE CRASE Carlton ('59) on 30 December 2016 in Meadowlakes, Texas.

As her sister, I will share some of her life events.Libby Ann Fairchild nee Graves was born January 13, 1949 in Claremore, Oklahoma at the Franklin hospital. Her proud parents were T. Jack and Norma Catherwood Graves. Libby lived on 9th street with her mother while her father was stationed in the US Army in Linz, Austria. When Libby was about 9 months old, she and her mother were able to join her father in Linz. Living in a foreign country with a baby was a challenge for her parents but it was an adventure. Upon returning to Claremore, I was born. Libby, Mom, and I and lived in the Bell Apartments across from the Claremore city library while our father was stationed in Korea. As a military family, we enjoyed traveling and living abroad. We moved around about every 3 years residing in Orleans, France, Washington DC, Aberdeen, Maryland, Falls Church, Virginia, Indianapolis, Indiana, San Antonia, Texas, to name just a few. As a family, we made many friends and had the opportunity to visit many countries. For Libby and I as teenagers, it was difficult at times, leaving friends, and moving so often, and not establishing permanent roots.\n\nLibby graduated from Aberdeen High School, Aberdeen, Maryland in 1967. After graduation, she attended Oklahoma State University. While on summer vacation in Claremore, Libby met and married Ronald Wallis. Ron was finishing up Pharmacy school so they moved to Weatherford, Oklahoma.

Libby loved her home, decorating it in French décor reminiscent of things from our years living in France. She also had a green thumb and grew fantastic flowers.\n\nLibby, Steve and I were pals, shopping together, eating out together, and making plans to visit museums, new towns, antique shops, and just hanging out. We planned to revisit San Diego, see Crystal Bridges in Bentonville, and see the Ocean again.\n\nDespite the challenges that Libby faced from her Cancer, she was not bitter. She remained positive and hopeful until the end. She referred to her plight as the circle of life.\n\nWe will grieve and mourn for our beloved sister, mother, grandmother and friend. She was "
