        "text": "Posthatch\n\nThe fourth detectable nest event, termed the posthatch phase, shows a very inactive period that lasts from a few hours to a few days, spanning the time between the end of hatching and emergence onto the sand. On average, this a quiet posthatch/pre-emergence period lasts approximately 1.5 days, and can be modulated by nest depth, though we see no evidence of increased motion during this time that could indicate digging activity.\n\nVideo from Olive Ridley nests in Costa Rica also showed that when a hatchling emerged from its shell and made its way to the top of the clutch of eggs, it caused most or all of the hatchlings already assembled to adjust their position to accommodate the new arrival. This assembly at the top of the clutch was where the egg sensor was placed. After the disruption by the new arrival, all the hatchlings stopped moving until the next disruption. This repeated disruption and quieting corresponds to our repeated readings of much greater activity followed by things getting quieter during the hatching period.\n\nSurprisingly, there were very few or no dramatically large motions recorded when actual emergence happened. The sensors were placed just beneath the top 10 eggs in the nest based on the assumption that hatchlings congregate at the top of the nest before a boil. The expectation was that when the hatchling moved past the sensor egg, that motion would cause very high readings. Although this sensor placement allowed for precise detection of hatching activity and the posthatch phase, it was difficult to determine the precise time when boils occur from collected data. Hatchlings surrounding the sensor could very well be the reason that environmental noises were attenuated. The bodies of hatchlings, being soft and mostly inelastic, would absorb sounds and impacts from their surroundings. The implication of this, though, is that the hatchlings surrounding the sensor are not moving.\n\nIt could be that the hatchlings that had already started moving up through the sand were already above the sensor, but observations from the field seem to contradict that theory. Data from one nest, NH047, showed that the erratic period had ended, motion had quieted down, and a boil was imminent. Several nest inspections in the three days before the boil showed that the hatchlings had congregated around the sensor, and all the readings for those last few days were low and undramatic. Our sensor placement was chosen in order to not disturb hatchling emergence, but to also allow the sensor to move down and still detect movement rather than be dangling in the air as hatching activity caused the nest to collapse. Alternative sensor placement or the use of multiple sensors (where a first sensor is placed among the top few eggs and a second sensor just beneath the sand surface) could provide even more information about nest events and potentially detect precisely when the hatchlings climb to the surface to signal a boil in real-time.\n\nPrevious findings show that larger groups dig their way out faster than smaller groups in relocated nests [11]. While it is possible that nests with more hatchlings have a longer incubation and prehatch period, our results show that nests with more hatchlings do not have longer hatching periods, nor is the time between egg hatching and emergence onto the sand faster than in nests with fewer hatchlings. In fact, we find a weak positive correlation between more hatchlings and longer hatch to emergence periods, meaning that more hatchlings actually take longer to emerge.\n\nThough previous findings report that the depth of the nest has no effect on the hatching period [17], we observe a weak negative correlation between hatching period and nest depth, where deeper nests take longer to hatch. In addition, we confirm previous findings that the deeper the nest, the longer it takes the hatchlings to emerge once hatching is completed [17]. We also observe a quite strong positive correlation between the posthatch phases and nest depth, though it is important to note that we saw no evidence of more digging activity during this time-period. It is possible that differences exist in hatching and emergence behaviors between in situ and relocated nests, but we did not observe noticeable differences in our activity monitoring.\n\nFuture analysis of collected temperature data from the sensors can provide information about whether seasonal temperature fluctuations can impact detected hatching or post-hatch duration periods, as well as monitor precise temperature when emergence occurs. Asynchronous emergence events (“trickles”), rather than large synchronous “boils,” can be associated with large within nest temperature ranges [38], so this information could possibly be used to predict boils.\n\nMore research is needed to elucidate exactly what other factors can impact the length of the posthatch period, though temperature may be an important variable. We found that the accelerometer readings alone provided ample data to accurately pinpoint emergence dates and we did not need to use the collected temperature information as a predictor of emergence.\n\nWe theorize that motion disruptions within the nest allows hatchlings to synchronize nest activity. When incubation nears completion, hatchlings start to hatch at about the same time, but not completely simultaneously, resulting in a small wave of detectable activity after each individual hatching that rises and then settles during the hatching period. As motion ceases within the next, it is possible that this final quieting down might be the cue to the hatchlings that all their siblings have hatched and it is time to leave the nest. The ability of hatchlings to sense a sufficiently long period of calmness after hatching and a drop in temperature might be what triggers a boil. These two simple biological inputs might be all that is necessary for the instinctual programming that synchronizes the behavior of all the hatchlings.\n\nOur results also call for a careful investigation of vibration/motion-based sea turtle sibling communication. Vibration cues for hatching have been isolated in other reptiles, including the pig-nosed turtle (Carettochelys insculpta) [39], where groups of eggs hatch faster than single eggs treated in the same way, indicating a function of sibling vibrations [40]. The length of time between the movements within vibrational cues can signal embryos within a clutch to hatch, as seen in predator-induced early hatching of red-eyed treefrogs (Agalychnis callidryas), where vibrations were enough to induce early hatching and embryos were able to differentiate between different vibration stimuli [41]. Future research could combine vibration data collection with vocalization monitoring to generate a more complete picture of embryo-to-embryo communication.\n\nBecause sea turtles are a threatened species, each municipality or locality must adopt a nest management strategy, most of which are labor intensive and relatively inaccurate at predicting day of emergence. As an automated system, TurtleSense can accurately predict hatching events and send alerts to wildlife managers and researchers. This is particularly important, since depressions, the standard way of identifying a hatching nest, were present in less than half of our monitored nests. In addition, current protocols mandate that protections be given for all nests, despite the fact that hatching success between 2009–2014 ranged from 33–77% in sea turtle nests (depending on month laid and if they were relocated) in Cape Hatteras National Seashore [42]. TurtleSense can accurately predict infertile nests and eliminate the unnecessary funneling of resources towards their protection. TurtleSense can also provide information to remotely notify conservation teams about nest dangers posed on beaches in real-time, including predation, potential poaching activity, or tidal inundation, and allow management to make decisions about whether a nest contains hatchlings instead of eggs that now need to be rescued from storm surges.\n\nTurtleSense has the ability to transform sea turtle nest management, providing useful real-time data to enable more efficient utilization of resources, better hatchling protection, and fewer volunteer hours. Accurately pinpointing emergence events allows for “just in time” barrier erection, reducing the impact of turtle management induced beach closures on beach goers, tourism, and the fishing industry. We primarily examined Caretta caretta nests, though we did also monitor pilots in Olive Ridley and Green Turtle nests. We saw the same basic patterns in these nests, so we anticipate an easy transfer of this predictive model to other turtle species. This was the case in Costa Rica, where we were able to detect and predict Olive Ridley hatchling emergence accurately, even though all nests were relocated and we had not previously used TurtleSense in this species.\n\nTurtleSense seeks to both preserve the health of endangered sea turtle hatchlings and lessen the impact of beach closures for people, freeing up valuable volunteer resources. Annually, in the state of North Carolina, the NPS spends $2.0 million dollars to support coordination of more than 600,000 volunteers statewide [43]. Specifically on Hatteras Island, nest sitting includes the following tasks: arriving at dusk to clear any off road vehicle tracks in the sand and sitting with the nest from 7:30pm to 12:00am. Generally, crowds can form around the sea turtle nests located near villages. In these situations, nest sitters are required to maintain crowd control, while also ensuring the nest stays safe during emergence. Nest sitters typically work in pairs assigned to one nest, where they wait for emergence each night (approximately 5 hours) ranging from 4–8 days for each nest beginning on a specific date after the nest was laid. We estimate that this protocol of 2 volunteers for 4–8 days per nest requires approximately 40–80 volunteer hours per nest.\n\nOn Hatteras Island, nest sitters typically only begin sitting on a nest when a depression has formed, the nest is beginning to be within the average emergence day for the season, or other clear indicators that emergence is imminent. TurtleSense can instead use motion data to provide a clear signal if the volunteers need to begin nest sitting based on when hatching is completed. Through the use of TurtleSense, the end of hatching activity would signal the need for nest sitters the following day for shallow nests, and two days later for deep nests. This potentially reduces the volunteer hours to 10–20 hours for each monitored nest, based on 1–2 days of nest sitting for 2 volunteers. Some turtle may still emerge after this date, but the volunteer resources would be “just-in-time” and importantly, TurtleSense would eliminate the need for volunteers to sit with nests that have not hatched yet or that are nonviable.\n\nTurtleSense provides more predictable opportunities to engage in public outreach for emergence events from nests, which is important for both conservation and awareness efforts, as turtle-based ecotourism has positive indirect impacts on the sea turtle population sustainability and conservation efforts [44]. TurtleSense can decrease the number of volunteer hours needed, benefit the park service by providing tighter windows for emergence events, and aid fishermen with shorter beach closures. Although TurtleSense is a useful tool for many reasons, it does not mitigate the need for other turtle conservation tactics. Initiatives such as turtle-friendly lighting should be encouraged or enforced so that interference to nests can be reduced in general, lessening the need for heavy nest management tactics and the potential for misoriented hatchlings.\n\n31 Jan 2022\n\nPONE-D-21-39727The secret life of baby turtles: A novel system to predict hatchling emergence, detect infertile nests, and remotely monitor sea turtle nest eventsPLOS ONE\n\nDear Dr. Clabough,\n\nThank you for submitting your manuscript to PLOS ONE.

(Please upload your review as an attachment if it exceeds 20,000 characters)\n\nReviewer #1: This is an interesting manuscript describing the application of novel technology to a problem in sea turtle management. While I am convinced that the technology described could prove to be useful, the manuscript, especially the Results, which does not conform to the Results section of a typical scientific manuscript, needs work. My specific comments follow:\n\nLine 100: delete ‘emergence’\n\nLine 111-112: citations?\n\nLine 122-133: Here or elsewhere in the introduction the authors should provide information on the conservation status of sea turtles and explain the role of nest monitoring in sea turtle management. Perhaps this should constitute the first paragraph of the manuscript followed by the review of what is known about sea turtle emergence (lines 67-120). After all, the manuscript is more about management strategies than it is about cues for emergence.\n\nLines 156-178: It seems like citation 19 should be referenced throughout these sections. I found the figures in that citation to be exceedingly helpful in understanding the design of the TurtleSense system.\n\nLine 211: delete second ‘instead’\n\nLine 194-233: a flow chart might be helpful.\n\nLines 252-256: this information seems out of place here.\n\nLines 296-301: more information needs to be provided on how ‘periods of activity’ were identified. How were they distinguished from background? How were the onset and end of such periods defined? Was there ambiguity in some recordings (not captured in the figures)?\n\nLines 306-307: some explanation of how hatched eggshells are counted should be provided. Given the large number of eggs per nest, can this be done accurately? Do shells remain as a single piece or do they get fragmented?\n\nLines 310-315, 418-421: an image captured from these videos would be and interesting figure!\n\nLines 353: “there is there is”\n\nLines 314-466, Results: I found the results section of this manuscript to be non-traditional for a scientific paper in that it lacked detailed results and included material that more typically belongs in the Discussion. For example, lines 320-326 consist of a series of assertions without reference to specific observations to back them up. Similarly, lines 334-354 describe four activity pattern stages but do not provide objective criteria by which one stage is distinguished from the next. A table showing means, standard deviations, and ranges of the duration of these stages (as well as nest depths and hatchling numbers) should be provided. Because of ambiguity in how these periods are determined, the patterns revealed by correlational analyses (Fig 5 and 6) are difficult to interpret. It may also be difficult for managers of other sea turtle populations at other beaches to use the nest prediction steps described in lines 372-416, thus limiting the utility of the approach described here.\n\nLines 379-380 and elsewhere: I am confused by the terms ‘popping’, ‘boil’, and ‘trickle’; they should be defined.\n\nLine 436: a citation should be provided regarding what previous investigators found and this should be moved to the introduction. If possible, a priori predictions regarding nest depth and number of hatchlings should be made explicit in the introduction. The interpretation of these analyses (e.g., line 459) should be saved for the discussion.\n\nLines 496-502: Can arrows or other symbols be added to Fig. 4 corresponding to the description provided here? Why not include the video and trace as supplemental material?\n\nLines 504-513: does this suggest that a different sensor placement should be considered?\n\nLines 540-545: why not include those analyses here?\n\nLines 547-557: the popcorn metaphor seems to be a bit of a stretch. Popcorn kernels are not responding to what other kernels are doing – but you suggest that turtles do.\n\nLines 570-590: to what degree can the predictive model described here be used elsewhere? Will it take multiple hatching seasons to recalibrate the predictive model for each turtle species and location? It would be helpful to provide information on cost and effort necessary to deploy TurtleSense. How does the cost and effort compare to current monitoring methods. Funds for management are always limited!\n\nLines 593-664: reference formatting needs careful editing.\n\nLine 606-607: citation is incomplete\n\nFig. 5 and 6: Statistical analyses consisted of tests for significant correlations but the figures show (presumably) regression lines, even in cases when the correlation was non-significant. While the lines allow visualization of the correlation, they are typically omitted in the case of non-significance. Alternatively, if nest depth and number of hatchlings are thought to have a causal effect on period length, why not use regression from the outset? Then the magnitude of the effect (number of days in for shallow vs. deep nests) could be included in the results.\n\nOther: I did not see information on funding sources or Institutional Animal Use and Care approval.\n\nReviewer #2: Summary -\n\nThe authors use a novel system to detect movement inside sea turtle nests which can signal activity levels at various stages in the nest. They show it is possible to detect when nests are non-viable and can ascertain the timing of hatching from eggs. However, the technology failed to determine when hatchlings are crawling up and about to emergence from the sand, but the authors suggest further changes in the study methods could improve this flaw. They explore the process of mass emergence and report their findings that hatching from eggs occurs over a period of a couple of days and that movement within the nest may play an important role in hatchling communications. They consider factors such as nest depth and number of hatchlings which could influence the timing of the hatching and emergence stages and report a way of predicting emergence based on their data. This is an interesting study which other sea turtle conservation programmes may find useful, but the paper requires major revisions as I found many discrepancies, some of which just require better clarification, for it to fit into the requirements of the journal\n\nIntroduction\n\nGeneral comments: Literature cited is limited throughout. For example, a key reason to use this technology is to prevent misorientations from artificial lighting, but there is very little explanation of this and its severity for the reader to understand - there are many studies on this particular topic which should be cited. Check font - sometimes inconsistent.\n\nLine 119: It is mentioned that the device is 'wireless' yet in the methods it states that it needs to be attached to a 6-meter cable that plugs into the communication unit. Please correct or clarify.\n\nLines 118 - 120:This final sentence should be at the end of the introduction, where you introduce TurtleSense.\n\nLine 143: ...enable the erection 'of' \"just-in-time\" barriers.\n\nMethods\n\nGeneral comments: It would be useful for the reader to know the approximate cost for the materials to build one unit, especially as it is said to be cost effective. In addition, does the unit itself (that is placed into the nest) give off any heat / have potential to impact hatch success? It would be useful to compare hatches of nests with TurtleSense to those without (removing nests that were relocated or had impacts from inundation/erosion or other threats).\n\nLine 185 - 186: The sensor sends data to the commications unit when it is ready to upload a report to the internet - It isn't clear what this is based on, is it when the storage reaches a certain limit or is it at regular time intervals?\n\nLine 290: \"motion readings from 79 nests between 2014-2017..\" but on line 236 it states that 74 nests were monitored with TurtleSense between 2013-2017. Are these different nests? please clarify.\n\nLine 291 - 292: Please add in sample sizes for how many nests were relocated and how many were in-situ. There is also no mention of whether the differences in activities were tested between relocated nests and in-situ nests which is important. Methods on how nest relocations were carried out should be included (was the depth and shape of the natural chamber taken into account etc).\n\nLine 291 - 297: It is mentioned that data from 79 nests are analysed. 72 are loggerhead and 2 are green, what about the other 5?

Introduce these terms in the introduction if they are to be used as not all readers will understand.\n\nFig. 2: Day 47 seems too early to be excavating eggs, given hatching was ccurring between 47.5-50.7 days. What was the reason to excavate at this point?\n\nLine 402: Explain what 'swings' are.\n\nFig.3: Needs to be clearer on the diagram that the +1 and +2 days are used instead of, not as well as, the original 1.5 day estimation.\n\nLine 434: How was nest depth measured? Was it depth to the base of the chamber or the top? Should be in methods.\n\nDiscussion\n\nGeneral comments: It should be mentioned that although this is a useful tool for many reasons, other initiatives, such as turtle friendly lighting' should be encouraged (or enforced as many ) so that interference to nests can be reduced in general, rather than allowing the issue to persist and increase. Terminology is switched between 'baby turtles', 'hatchlings' and 'turtles'. Best to choose one - I prefer 'hatchlings' as a more scientific term to baby turtles.\n\nLine 472: I somewhat disagree that this is reliable estimate of when hatchlings are emerging onto the beach as it could be up to 7.5 days. It is providing more of a reliable estimate than previous methods but is still not a method that could be relied upon really for an exact emergence.\n\nLine 525: It needs to be noted that there are likely differences in relocated and in-situ nests as relocated nests will not entirely reflect natural conditions.\n\nLine 576: This is incorrect based on the report referenced. The report states that the average hatch success ranged from 33 - 77% (based on the month) with lower success being linked to storm erosion and nest inundation (which is different to nest infertility). The report referenced does not mention nest infertility.\n\n**********\n\n6. PLOS authors have the option to publish the peer review history of their article (what does this mean?).

We have addressed your comments below.\n\nSincerely,\n\nErin Clabough, PhD\n\nReviewer #1:\n\nThis is an interesting manuscript describing the application of novel technology to a problem in sea turtle management. While I am convinced that the technology described could prove to be useful, the manuscript, especially the Results, which does not conform to the Results section of a typical scientific manuscript, needs work. My specific comments follow:\n\nLine 100: delete ‘emergence’\n\nAUTHOR RESPONSE: This is now corrected.\n\nLine 111-112: citations?\n\nAUTHOR RESPONSE: This statement now contains citations.\n\nLine 122-133: Here or elsewhere in the introduction the authors should provide information on the conservation status of sea turtles and explain the role of nest monitoring in sea turtle management. Perhaps this should constitute the first paragraph of the manuscript followed by the review of what is known about sea turtle emergence (lines 67-120). After all, the manuscript is more about management strategies than it is about cues for emergence.\n\nAUTHOR RESPONSE: The introduction has been revised to include this important information. Information has specifically been added to a new information about conservation of sea turtles and nest management with citations.\n\nLines 156-178: It seems like citation 19 should be referenced throughout these sections. I found the figures in that citation to be exceedingly helpful in understanding the design of the TurtleSense system.\n\nAUTHOR RESPONSE: This citation has now been included in the beginning of the TurtleSense hardware subsection in the Materials and Methods section.\n\nLine 211: delete second ‘instead’\n\nAUTHOR RESPONSE: This is now corrected.\n\nLine 194-233: a flow chart might be helpful.\n\nAUTHOR RESPONSE: We agree and we have created a flowchart to depict how the accelerometer data is handled and included it as a new figure (now Fig 1).\n\nLines 252-256: this information seems out of place here.\n\nAUTHOR RESPONSE: This protocol approval information was moved up to the beginning of the TurtleSense field testing section.\n\nLines 296-301: more information needs to be provided on how ‘periods of activity’ were identified. How were they distinguished from background? How were the onset and end of such periods defined? Was there ambiguity in some recordings (not captured in the figures)?\n\nAUTHOR RESPONSE: We have updated the results section to include specific details about how the accelerometer readings were interpreted. We have also included a new figure that illustrates what various external nest events look like, as TurtleSense can detect these as well. This is now Figure 2\n\nIn summary, early on during the first in-the-nest trials of the Turtle Sense technology, the developers had no idea what the data would look like. The first nests started recording data early on, starting at day one or day two. For many weeks the data showed slow oscillations of the readings at a very low level. Because we did not know what these oscillations were, we tried to correlate them (unsuccessfully) with tides, temperature and weather conditions. We wondered if the oscillations might be related to the developing eggs. To test that theory, a sensor was buried in the sand at the same depth of a typical nest, in a location where we knew that there was no nest. The readings we measured were virtually identical to the sensors in a nearby nest, so it was assumed that the readings were the result of background noise. The source of the noise might be a combination of temperature, surf noise, beach traffic, blowing sand, and weather. The actual source was determined to be unimportant from that point on. What became important were readings that did not fit the gentle pattern of those oscillations.\n\nThere were several new data patterns that emerged over time. One pattern was a sharp sudden discontinuity in the readings of the background noise. Over time we were able to correlate these with nest overwashes. The sudden addition of water to the sand around the sensor may have changed the acoustic properties of the sand causing the discontinuity.\n\nAnother new pattern was data that showed very large spikes in readings – many times higher than the background noise – for a short amount of time and occurring at random times during gestation. These were frequently correlated with predation events. These predatory events by animals such as ghost crabs could be confirmed in most cases by visual examination of the nests the subsequent day. We also noticed similar readings after nest checks by members of the National Park’s Turtle Patrol.\n\nWith the very first nest we kept looking for data that would indicate nest hatching activity after 40 days of gestation. We quickly identified periods of activity that looked nothing like the other patterns we had seen. These “periods of activity” were identified by data swings that were both higher and lower than the slow background noise oscillations, but not nearly as big in magnitude or as sudden as the predation events. The oscillations were more frequent than the background noise oscillations, occurring at least 3 times a day or more. These oscillations stayed roughly in the same range and frequency for the several days they were noticed. From our first nest we correlated this activity with hatching activity, since it was always followed by hatchlings emerging from the nest a few days later.\n\nThe onset of a period of activity was often preceded by a slow drop in the readings. This was not noticed in all of the nests, and we don’t know what this might indicate, if anything.\n\nThe conclusion of a period of activity was defined by an abrupt stop in the oscillations. The data readings from that point on remained relatively flat or once again looked like background noise. No patterns were noticed in the data from that point until the hatchlings emerged.\n\nLines 306-307: some explanation of how hatched eggshells are counted should be provided. Given the large number of eggs per nest, can this be done accurately? Do shells remain as a single piece or do they get fragmented?\n\nAUTHOR RESPONSE: Both hatched and unhatched eggs were counted at nest excavation. The eggs do not shatter, but typically a relatively intact egg casing can still be detected after hatching, which makes counting successful hatchlings possible based on eggshells. This information has been added to enhance information originally provided in Lines 306-307.\n\nLines 310-315, 418-421: an image captured from these videos would be and interesting figure!\n\nAUTHOR RESPONSE: We agree that this would make an interesting figure. We have provided a video clip as Supplemental Video 1 to better illustrate the visual confirmation techniques. The supplemental video will also visually address the shape and texture of the eggs for the reader.\n\nLines 353: “there is there is”\n\nAUTHOR RESPONSE: This is now corrected.\n\nLines 314-466, Results: I found the results section of this manuscript to be non-traditional for a scientific paper in that it lacked detailed results and included material that more typically belongs in the Discussion. For example, lines 320-326 consist of a series of assertions without reference to specific observations to back them up. Similarly, lines 334-354 describe four activity pattern stages but do not provide objective criteria by which one stage is distinguished from the next. A table showing means, standard deviations, and ranges of the duration of these stages (as well as nest depths and hatchling numbers) should be provided. Because of ambiguity in how these periods are determined, the patterns revealed by correlational analyses (Fig 5 and 6) are difficult to interpret. It may also be difficult for managers of other sea turtle populations at other beaches to use the nest prediction steps described in lines 372-416, thus limiting the utility of the approach described here.\n\nlines 320-326 consist of a series of assertions without reference to specific observations to back them up.\n\nAUTHOR RESPONSE: We revised this section to remove some of these assertions and provide more information to support the types of motion events the sensors are able to detect.\n\nlines 334-354 describe four activity pattern stages but do not provide objective criteria by which one stage is distinguished from the next. A table showing means, standard deviations, and ranges of the duration of these stages (as well as nest depths and hatchling numbers) should be provided.\n\nAUTHOR RESPONSE: We have updated the manuscript to eliminate ambiguity about what sorts of patterns are detectable in the data to characterize these different periods and how we sorted that into stages. We have also inserted a table including specifics about this information in our observed nests as a new Table 1.\n\nLines 379-380 and elsewhere: I am confused by the terms ‘popping’, ‘boil’, and ‘trickle’; they should be defined.\n\nAUTHOR RESPONSE: “Popping” has been replaced as a term by “hatching” in line 379. We have defined “boil” and “trickle” the first time they are mentioned, housed under the section “Nest Predictions.”\n\nLine 436: a citation should be provided regarding what previous investigators found and this should be moved to the introduction.If possible, a priori predictions regarding nest depth and number of hatchlings should be made explicit in the introduction.\n\nAUTHOR RESPONSE: We cannot include a priori information in the introduction because we did not make predictions, but the introduction includes information about what previous research has found regarding nest depth, with citations.\n\nThe interpretation of these analyses (e.g., line 459) should be saved for the discussion.\n\nAUTHOR RESPONSE: Interpretation of these analyses (including line 459) was moved to the discussion.\n\nLines 496-502: Can arrows or other symbols be added to Fig. 4 corresponding to the description provided here? Why not include the video and trace as supplemental material?\n\nAUTHOR RESPONSE: Yes, we agree that a visual is a wonderful addition to the manuscript. We did include a new supplemental video that displays the oscillations in the data more clearly.\n\nLines 504-513: does this suggest that a different sensor placement should be considered?\n\nAUTHOR RESPONSE: Yes, certainly that could be considered. Our sensor placement was chosen in order to not disturb hatchling emergence, but to also allow the sensor to move down and still detect movement rather than be dangling in the air as hatching activity caused the nest to collapse. Different sensor placement could be considered, as can the use of more than one sensor per nest. This section has been updated to reflect that information.\n\nLines 540-545: why not include those analyses here?\n\nAUTHOR RESPONSE: We found that the accelerometer readings alone provided ample data to accurately predict emergence and we did not need to use the collected temperature information. As such, we did not analyze temperature fluctuations as a predictor of emergence, though we did collect the data and it is available for analysis if another research group is interested in temperature. The manuscript has been updated to explain that in the discussion.\n\nLines 547-557: the popcorn metaphor seems to be a bit of a stretch. Popcorn kernels are not responding to what other kernels are doing – but you suggest that turtles do.\n\nAUTHOR RESPONSE: We agree that the removal of this metaphor makes the data more clear. The popcorn references have been taken out of the discussion.\n\nLines 570-590: to what degree can the predictive model described here be used elsewhere? Will it take multiple hatching seasons to recalibrate the predictive model for each turtle species and location?\n\nAUTHOR RESPONSE: We primarily examined Caretta caretta nests, though we did also monitor pilots in Olive Ridley and Green Turtle nests. We saw the same basic patterns in these nests, so we anticipate an easy transfer of this predictive model to other turtle species. This was the case in Costa Rica, where we were able to detect and predict Olive Ridley hatchling emergence accurately, even though all nests were relocated and we had not previously used TurtleSense in this species. This information has been added to the discussion.\n\nIt would be helpful to provide information on cost and effort necessary to deploy TurtleSense. How does the cost and effort compare to current monitoring methods. Funds for management are always limited!\n\nAUTHOR RESPONSE: We have added cost of construction information to the Methods section under Hardware, and we have added information about the comparative cost of volunteer hours to the Discussion section.\n\nLines 593-664: reference formatting needs careful editing.\n\nAUTHOR RESPONSE: The reference formatting has been edited to conform to Vancouver style.\n\nLine 606-607: citation is incomplete\n\nAUTHOR RESPONSE: This citation is now corrected.\n\nFig. 5 and 6: Statistical analyses consisted of tests for significant correlations but the figures show (presumably) regression lines, even in cases when the correlation was non-significant. While the lines allow visualization of the correlation, they are typically omitted in the case of non-significance. Alternatively, if nest depth and number of hatchlings are thought to have a causal effect on period length, why not use regression from the outset? Then the magnitude of the effect (number of days in for shallow vs. deep nests) could be included in the results.\n\nAUTHOR RESPONSE: The regression lines have been removed from the last 2 figures for nonsignificant results. The regression analyses were performed and the correlation coefficient (r) is reported as a measure of effect size.\n\nOther: I did not see information on funding sources or Institutional Animal Use and Care approval.\n\nAUTHOR RESPONSE: The animal study was reviewed and approved by the National Park Service. NPS permit numbers updated in the Methods section. This project was not grant-supported, but was funded by volunteer work and supported by agreements between the Hatteras Island Ocean Center nonprofit and the National Park Service.\n\nReviewer #2:\n\nSummary -\n\nThe authors use a novel system to detect movement inside sea turtle nests which can signal activity levels at various stages in the nest. They show it is possible to detect when nests are non-viable and can ascertain the timing of hatching from eggs. However, the technology failed to determine when hatchlings are crawling up and about to emergence from the sand, but the authors suggest further changes in the study methods could improve this flaw. They explore the process of mass emergence and report their findings that hatching from eggs occurs over a period of a couple of days and that movement within the nest may play an important role in hatchling communications. They consider factors such as nest depth and number of hatchlings which could influence the timing of the hatching and emergence stages and report a way of predicting emergence based on their data. This is an interesting study which other sea turtle conservation programmes may find useful, but the paper requires major revisions as I found many discrepancies, some of which just require better clarification, for it to fit into the requirements of the journal\n\nIntroduction\n\nGeneral comments: Literature cited is limited throughout. For example, a key reason to use this technology is to prevent misorientations from artificial lighting, but there is very little explanation of this and its severity for the reader to understand - there are many studies on this particular topic which should be cited. Check font - sometimes inconsistent.\n\nAUTHOR RESPONSE: The introduction has been revised to include this important discussion about current reasons for good nest management, including artificial lights (with citations).\n\nLine 119: It is mentioned that the device is 'wireless' yet in the methods it states that it needs to be attached to a 6-meter cable that plugs into the communication unit. Please correct or clarify.\n\nAUTHOR RESPONSE: The system is wireless but the sensor itself is not. The term “wireless” has been removed from this particular sentence to eliminate confusion.\n\nLines 118 - 120:This final sentence should be at the end of the introduction, where you introduce TurtleSense.\n\nAUTHOR RESPONSE: This sentence has been moved closer to the end of the introduction.\n\nLine 143: ...enable the erection 'of' \"just-in-time\" barriers.\n\nAUTHOR RESPONSE: This is now corrected.\n\nMethods\n\nGeneral comments: It would be useful for the reader to know the approximate cost for the materials to build one unit, especially as it is said to be cost effective. In addition, does the unit itself (that is placed into the nest) give off any heat / have potential to impact hatch success? It would be useful to compare hatches of nests with TurtleSense to those without (removing nests that were relocated or had impacts from inundation/erosion or other threats).\n\nIt would be useful for the reader to know the approximate cost for the materials to build one unit, especially as it is said to be cost effective.\n\nAUTHOR RESPONSE: All the plans for creating the circuitry and assembling the units are on the Nerds without Borders website (http://nerdswithoutborders.net/index.php?title=Turtle_Sense/Phase_Two). The cost of parts is approximately $300 per unit to build independently ($50/sensor and $250/communication tower). Each nest needs its own sensor for the duration of the incubation (placed on the day the nest is laid), though the communication tower does not need to be installed until hatching is more imminent, so can be moved from nest to nest as needed). This information is now in the methods section.\n\nIn addition, does the unit itself (that is placed into the nest) give off any heat / have potential to impact hatch success?\n\nAUTHOR RESPONSE: The sensor that is placed into the nest does not give off any heat.\n\nIt would be useful to compare hatches of nests with TurtleSense to those without (removing nests that were relocated or had impacts from inundation/erosion or other threats).\n\nAUTHOR RESPONSE: During the first several seasons of TurtleSense use, we were in a proof-of-concept mode where we tried and modified many variables. During this time, we placed sensors in both relocated and in situ nests to anecdotally observe any impact. No differences were observed in the number of hatchlings that emerged or overall nest motion tracings, so we did not distinguish between relocated and in situ nests in subsequent seasons when we collected data for this paper.\n\nLine 185 - 186: The sensor sends data to the commications unit when it is ready to upload a report to the internet - It isn't clear what this is based on, is it when the storage reaches a certain limit or is it at regular time intervals?\n\nAUTHOR RESPONSE: The sensor sends data when there are 240 records, which is either one day (using 6 minute records) or 4 hours (using 1 minute records). The methods section has now been updated under “TurtleSense software” to reflect this.\n\nLine 290: \"motion readings from 79 nests between 2014-2017..\" but on line 236 it states that 74 nests were monitored with TurtleSense between 2013-2017. Are these different nests? please clarify.\n\nAUTHOR RESPONSE: These are the same nests. The lines have been updated to clarify this.\n\nLine 291 - 292: Please add in sample sizes for how many nests were relocated and how many were in-situ. There is also no mention of whether the differences in activities were tested between relocated nests and in-situ nests which is important. Methods on how nest relocations were carried out should be included (was the depth and shape of the natural chamber taken into account etc).\n\nAUTHOR RESPONSE: There were 9 Caretta caretta relocated nests in the data that were used for analysis and the rest were in-situ. The relocated nests were relocated due to unsafe original nest placement near the water’s edge and reburied near the dunes at the same nest depth and with the same egg placement. This section of the methods has now been updated to include this information, as well as information on how the nest relocations were handled. In addition, a disclaimer has been added to the discussion acknowledging that there could be hatchling behavioral differences between relocated and in situ nests, though we did not observe noticeable differences in the motion data.\n\nLine 291 - 297: It is mentioned that data from 79 nests are analysed. 72 are loggerhead and 2 are green, what about the other 5? Is it the olive ridley nests that are mentioned below? clarify.\n\nAUTHOR RESPONSE: These are the same nests. The lines have been updated to clarify this.\n\nLine 296: More detail needed here on what data were analysed, was it just motion or did this include temperature/other measures?\n\nAUTHOR RESPONSE: This paragraph says that motion data was analyzed. TurtleSense does collect temperature, but we did not need to analyze it in order to predict emergence accurately. As such, we did not analyze temperature fluctuations as a predictor of emergence, though we did collect the data and it is available for analysis if another research group is interested in temperature. The manuscript has been updated to explain that in the discussion.\n\nResults\n\nGeneral comments: It is not always immediately clear when talking about emergence if the authors mean emergence from eggs or emergence from the sand. Please make this clearer throughout, including in Figure 1. Was every infertile nest detected before excavating? How many times was the model correct for predicting the emergence date (from the sand)?\n\nAUTHOR RESPONSE: Thank you for pointing out the confusion in the use of the terms “hatching” and “emergence.” We have updated the use of these terms throughout the manuscript to make them more clear (hatching is always coming out of the eggs within the nest, while emergence is always coming out of the nest onto the sand).\n\nEvery infertile nest was detected before excavating based on the absence of hatching activity. The predictive model was generated based on the described data, and can be used whenever hatching activity is present. The ability of the predicted emergence date to continually be narrowed based on hatching data is the strength of this model, as the 3.8 day window can be shortened to a 1 or 2 day window (based on nest depth) when the real-time data shows that hatching activity has ceased within the nest. This information has been added to the discussion.\n\nFig.1: Needs to be higher quality with larger font used.\n\nAUTHOR RESPONSE: We have revised this figure to be higher quality with larger font.\n\nLines 373 - 374: In methods it should be added that nests were checked (and how frequently) and that depressions were noted.\n\nAUTHOR RESPONSE: Nests were checked daily each morning and depressions were noted when present. This information has been added to the methods. Emergence count methods were also added.\n\nLine 376: Repetitive...reword.\n\nAUTHOR RESPONSE: This has been reworded to be less repetitive.\n\nLine 379 - 380: This is the first time introducing 'popping' and 'boiling'. Introduce these terms in the introduction if they are to be used as not all readers will understand.\n\nAUTHOR RESPONSE: To be more clear, we have replaced “popping” with “hatching” throughout the manuscript and defined the terms “boil” and “trickle” when they first appear in the manuscript.\n\nFig. 2: Day 47 seems too early to be excavating eggs, given hatching was ccurring between 47.5-50.7 days. What was the reason to excavate at this point?\n\nAUTHOR RESPONSE: In this Figure, Day 47 (B) and Day 46 (C) are both too early to excavate based on standard protocols, but this figure illustrates how the TurtleSense system was able to assist when standard methods are challenged (due to the impending overwash from the tropical storm). Both nests were in vulnerable areas and so decisions were made to excavate them early. The figure legend has been updated to include this information.\n\nLine 402: Explain what 'swings' are.\n\nAUTHOR RESPONSE: We have updated the beginning of the results section to more clearly describe what the data looked like in each stage, including defining “swings.” Early on during the first in-the-nest trials of the Turtle Sense technology, the developers had no idea what the data would look like. The first nests started recording data early on, starting at day one or day two. For many weeks the data showed slow oscillations of the readings at a very low level. Because we did not know what these oscillations were, we tried to correlate them (unsuccessfully) with tides, temperature and weather conditions. We wondered if the oscillations might be related to the developing eggs. To test that theory, a sensor was buried in the sand at the same depth of a typical nest, in a location where we knew that there was no nest. The readings we measured were virtually identical to the sensors in a nearby nest, so it was assumed that the readings were the result of background noise. The source of the noise might be a combination of temperature, surf noise, beach traffic, blowing sand, and weather. The actual source was determined to be unimportant from that point on. What became important were readings that did not fit the gentle pattern of those oscillations.\n\nThere were several new data patterns that emerged over time. One pattern was a sharp sudden discontinuity in the readings of the background noise. Over time we were able to correlate these with nest overwashes. The sudden addition of water to the sand around the sensor may have changed the acoustic properties of the sand causing the discontinuity.\n\nAnother new pattern was data that showed very large spikes in readings – many times higher than the background noise – for a short amount of time and occurring at random times during gestation. These were frequently correlated with predation events. These predatory events by animals such as ghost crabs could be confirmed in most cases by visual examination of the nests the subsequent day. We also noticed similar readings after nest checks by members of the National Park’s Turtle Patrol.\n\nWith the very first nest we kept looking for data that would indicate nest hatching activity after 40 days of gestation. We quickly identified periods of activity that looked nothing like the other patterns we had seen. These “periods of activity” were identified by data swings that were both higher and lower than the slow background noise oscillations, but not nearly as big in magnitude or as sudden as the predation events. The oscillations were more frequent than the background noise oscillations, occurring at least 3 times a day or more. These oscillations stayed roughly in the same range and frequency for the several days they were noticed. From our first nest we correlated this activity with hatching activity, since it was always followed by hatchlings emerging from the nest a few days later.\n\nThe onset of a period of activity was often preceded by a slow drop in the readings. This was not noticed in all of the nests, and we don’t know what this might indicate, if anything.\n\nThe conclusion of a period of activity was defined by an abrupt stop in the oscillations. The data readings from that point on remained relatively flat or once again looked like background noise. No patterns were noticed in the data from that point until the hatchlings emerged.\n\nFig.3: Needs to be clearer on the diagram that the +1 and +2 days are used instead of, not as well as, the original 1.5 day estimation.\n\nAUTHOR RESPONSE: We have updated this figure to make the phases and the predictions more clear.\n\nLine 434: How was nest depth measured? Was it depth to the base of the chamber or the top? Should be in methods.\n\nAUTHOR RESPONSE: Nest depth is measured to the top of the nest chamber. This has now been included in the methods sections.\n\nDiscussion\n\nGeneral comments: It should be mentioned that although this is a useful tool for many reasons, other initiatives, such as turtle friendly lighting' should be encouraged (or enforced as many ) so that interference to nests can be reduced in general, rather than allowing the issue to persist and increase. Terminology is switched between 'baby turtles', 'hatchlings' and 'turtles'. Best to choose one - I prefer 'hatchlings' as a more scientific term to baby turtles.\n\nAUTHOR RESPONSE: We agree that the inclusion of turtle friendly lighting initiatives is beneficial and we have updated the intro and the discussion to reflect the importance of this issue. We have changed the terminology throughout the manuscript to read as “hatchlings” in most cases for consistency.\n\nLine 472: I somewhat disagree that this is reliable estimate of when hatchlings are emerging onto the beach as it could be up to 7.5 days. It is providing more of a reliable estimate than previous methods but is still not a method that could be relied upon really for an exact emergence.\n\nAUTHOR RESPONSE: While we agree that our data still cannot allow us to predict a trickle vs a boil, the ability of the predicted emergence date to continually be narrowed based on hatching data is the strength of this model, as the 3.6 day window can be shortened emergence the following day (+1) or in 2 days (+2) day window (based on nest depth) when the real-time data shows that hatching activity has ceased within the nest. This allows protection barriers to be erected in real time instead of solely based on the day count from the time the nest is laid, shortening the amount of time that the nest needs to be closely monitored. This information has been added to the first paragraph in the discussion for clarity.\n\nLine 525: It needs to be noted that there are likely differences in relocated and in-situ nests as relocated nests will not entirely reflect natural conditions.\n\nAUTHOR RESPONSE: Yes, it is possible that differences exist in hatching and emergence behaviors between in situ and relocated nests, but we did not observe noticeable differences in our activity monitoring. This information has been added to the discussion section.\n\nLine 576: This is incorrect based on the report referenced. The report states that the average hatch success ranged from 33 - 77% (based on the month) with lower success being linked to storm erosion and nest inundation (which is different to nest infertility). The report referenced does not mention nest infertility.\n\nAUTHOR RESPONSE: Thank you for your review of this reference. The data presented in the manuscript was updated to better reflect the descriptive statistics in the reference.\n\nAttachment\n\nSubmitted filename: CLABOUGH_Reviewer Comments.docx"
