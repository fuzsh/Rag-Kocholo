        "text": "The Perfect Hard Boiled Egg\n\nIt’s a age old debate, and there are likely as many methods as there are stars in the sky, but I recently tried this method from a great book I’ve started devouring that was recommended by a friend, Deep Run Roots by Vivian Howard. This book is as much a story as it is a cookbook and as much an inspiration as it is picture book. I am thoroughly enjoying it. Vivian also has a PBS Series called A Chef’s Life and a restaurant called Chef & the Farmer.\n\nSo I tried Vivian’s method and loved it. Complete simplicity and success. A hard boiled egg generously topped with more salt and pepper than seems reasonable and a dab of Cholula hot sauce served on a bed of sprouts drizzled with fresh lemon juice = the perfect quick breakfast!\n\nHere’s how to make them:\n\nThat’s it! Simple! Success! The perfect food.\n\nEnjoy!"
