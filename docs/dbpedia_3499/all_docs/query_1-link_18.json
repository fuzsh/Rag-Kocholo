I think this is John Woo's best film to date. his style fits better into this story than any of his other works for me.\n\nIt is the story of a couple of cops played by Chow Yun-Fat and Tony Leung. Both are trying, unbeknownst to one another, to bring down a arms dealer. One is undercover and the other is more of the \"wildcard\" type cop. But plot here isn't the focus. The focus is on action. Balls to the wall, all out action.\n\nWhile I was watching this I thought how similar John Woo's look and style is to Michael Mann's and the late Tony Scott's. Cinema comes from a Greek word \"cinema\", which meant \"movement\". Cinema is we know it is capturing and presenting movement. Using this definition, HARD BOILED is pure cinema. There are very few shots where the characters are not in motion. Even fewer when the camera is not in motion. This is a movie about moving objects.\n\nI watched a trailer for this film, and it is basically two minutes of gunfire and explosions. Which is fitting, because this film is basically two hours of just that. The use of slow motion, stylistic gun play, and an 80's soundtrack (even in 1992) has become synonymous with Woo. And I say that is a good thing."
