        "text": "Julia Child was a legend and I can only appreciate her content from what I watch online. I have to admit it, I even loved that movie Julia & Julia. Having only learned how to cook from teaching myself, I am always on the lookout for new ways to get better. That is how I learned how to make these perfect poached eggs.\n\nJulia’s tip is quite simple, yet the payoff is huge. All it takes is three easy resources to make it happen — a pin, a timer, and 10 seconds.\n\nPerfect Poached Egg every time\n\nThis tip for perfect poached eggs for your high calorie breakfast from Julia Child will completely change your breakfast for the rest of your life. I have always loved poached eggs but only ordered them at restaurants because I didn’t think I could make them. With this recipe, you will be making flawless poached eggs forever. You can even start impressing your family and friends.\n\nAll you will need to make perfect poached eggs is:\n\nA Pin\n\nA timer\n\n10 seconds\n\nYou’ll need eggs, a pot of water, and a slotted spoon of course, but it’s the pin, timer, and extra few seconds that really make the magic happen.\n\nWhy Julia Childs Tip Works\n\nThe real key to this recipe is the 10 second boil. That boil produces perfectly poached eggs every time. The reason I have never made poached eggs at home was because every attempt ended with a pan full of egg whites and no poached egg at the end.\n\nThe egg whites were always wispy and would pull away from the egg when I added it to the water.\n\nUsing this recipe for a perfect poached egg, you can say goodbye to those wispy egg whites. After poking the hole in the egg and boiling for 10 seconds, the egg holds its shape.\n\nNow it’s your turn. Leave me a comment after you make this letting me know what you thought!"
