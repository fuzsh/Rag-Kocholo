        "text": "Perfectly cooked eggs that are easy to peel by steaming them in an instant pot pressure cooker. You can make either hard or soft boiled eggs!\n\nEggs come out perfectly cooked and very easy to peel by steaming them in a pressure cooker, like an instant pot. This might not be a new discovery for you but it is for me and I’m so excited to share my results!\n\nI’ve been wanting to share some instant pot recipes, but first I need to start with these eggs. Yes, eggs are easy to make on the stove. But I’ve constantly struggled with peeling soft boiled eggs. I’ve tried all the tips out there: adding baking soda to the water, puncturing a small hole in the bottom of the egg, ice bath, etc. While the tips help, the eggs are still hard to peel and I can’t ever seem to get them out of their shell completely whole.\n\nAnd then I discovered the instant pot method for making eggs. Not only is it quick and easy, but the soft boiled eggs peel as easily as the hard boiled eggs. When eggs are steamed, there is a pressure difference from the exterior of the egg, separating the egg white from the shell. While this can also be achieved through traditional steaming, I’ve read that the results aren’t quite as consistent, but with the pressure cooker, you have a more controlled environment making it much easier to achieve good results.\n\nLook at the beautiful whole peeled egg! Now if only my knife had been sharp enough to cut through smoothly.\n\nMy instant pot has been a beloved kitchen appliance in my kitchen for about a year now. The multi-pressure cooker acts as a pressure cooker, slow cooker, rice cooker, yogurt maker, steamer and more. I love being able to cook dishes faster in it, but my favorite uses have been for the more basic things. For instance, it cooks rice in half the time and the rice comes out fluffy and perfectly cooked, like the rice in nice ricer cookers.\n\nI only learned about the instant pot methodology for cooking eggs recently and it’s been a game-changer. I can’t wait to use this to make soft boiled egg recipes like my potato salad and deep-fried eggs. It’s also great for making hard-boiled eggs too.\n\nThe top eggs are the hard boiled at 5 minutes. The next is cooked at 4 minutes. They are cooked but still a little bit soft in the yolk. The next one down is at 3 minutes. Here, the egg yolks are partially cooked and partly runny. This is my ideal for soft boiled. The final one is at 2 minutes, where the yolk is very runny.\n\nUpdate! Now updated with video:\n\nFor those of you in the market for buying an Instant Pot, I own this version here*.\n\n*Some of the links contained in this post are affiliate links.
