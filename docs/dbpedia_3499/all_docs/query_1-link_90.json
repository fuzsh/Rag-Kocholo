Whether you're making hard boiling eggs for Easter, deviled eggs, or just want an easy snack, this recipe is your answer.\n\nI love hard boiled eggs.\n\nThey're really versatile and great as a low-calorie, high-protein snack or as a topping for your favorite salad. If you're in a hurry, just have a couple for breakfast.\n\nRegardless of your how you are using your eggs, you'll be happy to know you have a hard boiled eggs recipe that delivers consistent results every time.\n\nFeel free to jump around to any of the topics below, or read the entire post for some great tips for making the perfect hard boiled eggs.\n\nJump to:\n\nHow to hard boil eggs\n\nBest way to crack hard boiled eggs\n\nHow to peel hard boiled eggs\n\nHow to make easy peel hard boiled eggs\n\nHow long do hard boiled eggs last?\n\nAre hard boiled eggs good for you?\n\nCommon hard boiled egg issues\n\nWhat recipes use hard boiled eggs?\n\nEasy Hard Boiled Eggs\n\nMy egg salad recipe is another great use for these eggs!\n\nHow to hard boil eggs\n\nMaking hard boiled eggs is pretty simple, right? After all, it's just a matter of boiling some eggs.\n\nNot so fast, my friend…there is a bit more to it. Do it wrong and you get those dreaded greenish-grey yolks, rubbery egg whites or undercooked, jammy yolks?\n\nFollow my simple steps below and these concerns all go away.\n\nStep 1 - Add eggs to a pan\n\nFirst, use cold eggs straight from your refrigerator. Second, only add enough eggs to make a single layer on the bottom of the pan. Finally, make sure not to pack them in too tight: allow for a little breathing room.\n\nStep 2 - Add COLD WATER\n\nAdd enough COLD WATER so that you have a minimum of 1 inch above the eggs.\n\nUsing cold water allows the eggs to cook slowly as the water heats up. This is especially important for the egg whites: the gradual temperature increase produces the perfect tender egg white texture. Adding eggs to boiling water can produce rubbery egg whites and green yolks. Want the science behind it? Go here.\n\nStep 3 - Bring eggs to a boil\n\nTurn the burner on high and bring the water to a boil.\n\nI always set a timer for 8 minutes to remind me to start checking on this boil.\n\nStep 4 - Remove from heat\n\nThe moment the water reaches a rolling boil, immediately remove the pan from the heat.\n\nYou will know a rolling boil is achieved at the very moment you begin to hear the eggs rumbling in the bottom of the pan.\n\nThen cover and let the eggs rest in the hot water for the appropriate time depending on their size.\n\nAgain, set a timer. You don't want to miss your timing.\n\nStep 5 - Place eggs in an ice bath\n\nAfter the eggs have rested their allotted time in the hot water, it’s important to immediately stop the cooking process. To do this, place the eggs in an ice bath.\n\nIn a large bowl, place equal parts cold water and ice cubes. Make sure the water level will be high enough so that the eggs are fully submerged by an inch.\n\nThen, using a skimmer or slotted spoon, carefully remove the eggs from the pan and place them into the ice bath.\n\nKeep the eggs submerged for a minimum of 10 minutes before peeling. If the ice completely melts during this process, just add more.\n\nOnce cooled, peel and eat right away or store in the fridge up to 7 days.\n\nBest way to crack hard boiled eggs\n\nYes, you can always crack the eggs on the counter or even roll them around with a little bit of pressure.\n\nThe problem is that it is hard to control the pressure being applied. Many times you will end up with eggs whites that have split open.\n\nThere is a better way...\n\nUse the backside of a spoon and gently tap it around the entire egg.\n\nThis allows you to control the pressure and you will see it is just as fast as doing it on the counter.\n\nHow to peel hard boiled eggs\n\nI find that peeling eggs in a sink under running water works best. Always make sure that the water is landing on the egg section that you're peeling. The water helps create separation from the shell and the egg.\n\nAs you stand at the sink, use your fingers to peel away the cracked shell from one end of the egg.\n\nNow, very carefully, insert a small spoon between the shell and the egg white.\n\nHolding the egg under the water, gently guide the spoon across the egg. You'll see the egg shell separating from the egg as you work.\n\nDo this in small batches and don’t rush it.\n\nYes, you will notice that sometimes the shell can stick to the egg and make the process a bit difficult.\n\nYou may now be asking yourself, \"How do I make eggs that are easy to peel?\"\n\nHow to make easy peel hard boiled eggs\n\nDon't peel your eggs right after cracking them.\n\nBut rather, place the cracked eggs back into the ice bath and let them soak for 15 minutes.\n\nThe water will seep underneath the shell and create some separation allowing the peel to come off much easier.\n\nAnother strategy is to buy older eggs. Older eggs peel easier than newer eggs: it's as simple as that.\n\nGrocery stores can stock their eggs up to 4 weeks before their use-by date. With this being the case, you should shop for these eggs 2-3 weeks before you actually boil them.\n\nI always try to boil my eggs 7-10 days before this expiration date.\n\nImportant: Do not eat eggs that have passed their use-by date.\n\nHow long do hard boiled eggs last?\n\nHard boiled eggs will last 7 days in the refrigerator, regardless of whether they're peeled or unpeeled.\n\nIt's important to keep the eggs in a sealed container. If they're peeled, it's best to line the bottom of your container with a damp paper towel.\n\nTo remove any guesswork, I always write the boil date on a piece of tape to label my storage container:\n\nAre hard boiled eggs good for you?\n\nQuick answer: YES!\n\nHard boiled eggs are low in calories and are packed with protein, vitamins and minerals. The eggs whites are almost exclusively protein while the yolks contain vitamins and other nutrients.\n\nYou may be asking “what about all the cholesterol in eggs?”\n\nTrue, eggs are high in cholesterol, but...\n\nAs always, everything in moderation. In other words, don't re-enact the egg scene from Cool Hand Luke.\n\nRecent studies have shown that eating foods that are high in cholesterol does not negatively impact blood cholesterol for most people. There is even evidence showing that eggs can actually improve a person's good HDL cholesterol levels.\n\nHealthline has a great article on the health benefits of eggs.\n\nCommon hard boiled egg issues\n\nAll issues you encounter will either be under- or overcooking the eggs.\n\nUndercooked eggs will have a jammy yolk centers. The likely reason for this is because you didn't allow the water to come to a full boil before removing the eggs from the heat to rest.\n\nThe opposite of this is the reason for overcooked eggs. If you get green-ish egg yolks or rubbery egg whites, you likely left them in the boiling water a bit too long.\n\nNot removing the eggs from the hot water and into the ice bath at the specified times would also result in under- or overcooked eggs.\n\nWhat recipes use hard boiled eggs?\n\nMany potato salad recipes use hard boiled eggs, like my Potato Salad with Relish.\n\nHard boiled eggs are amazing if you marinate them, as in Soy-Miso Marinated Ramen Eggs.\n\nSome folks like to add hard boiled eggs to their gravy at Thanksgiving (check out my Easy, Rich Turkey Gravy, which does not include eggs—but they're easy to add).\n\nDeviled Eggs with Relish\n\nEgg salad\n\nThat's all there is to it!\n\nThis is a great technique to have in your arsenal. Enjoy!\n\nStay safe. Stay well.\n\n—xoxo Michelle"
