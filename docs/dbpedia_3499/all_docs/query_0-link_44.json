        "text": "(Photo by Warner Bros/ Everett Collection)\n\nThe 50 Best Action-Comedy Movies, Ranked By Tomatometer\n\nThe action-comedy is one of the of the more playful, exciting genre hybrids out there, though it didn’t really come into shape until the 1980s, when buddy-cop films like Lethal Weapon and 48 Hrs. exploded onto the scene, along with Midnight Run, The Blues Brothers, and the rise of Jackie Chan. In Police Story, Drunken Master, and rest of his peak output, Chan is essentially a living, breathing homage to Buster Keaton, whose absurdly dangerous slapstick prowess powered the original action-comedy: 1926’s The General.\n\nChan and Chris Tucker revitalized the action-comedy formula for the ’90s with the Rush Hour movies.

And though most superhero movies these days are humorous on some level, we’ll be highlighting the ones that really flex their comedic muscles, like The Suicide Squad and Deadpool. Ryan Reynolds seems molded for this wisecracking genre, wherein he has played the Merc With a Mouth and starred in Free Guy.\n\nNow, see the 50 best-reviewed Certified Fresh action-comedies! —Alex Vo\n\n#50\n\nRed (2010) 72%\n\n#50\n\nAdjusted Score: 80744%\n\nCritics Consensus: It may not be the killer thrill ride you'd expect from an action movie with a cast of this caliber, but Red still thoroughly outshines most of its big-budget counterparts with its wit and style.\n\nSynopsis: After surviving an assault from a squad of hit men, retired CIA agent Frank Moses (Bruce Willis) reassembles his old...
