To this day and by some measure Hard Boiled remains the benchmark for relentless, thrilling, visceral action. Still the most action packed 2 hours of celluloid in cinematic history. John Woo hits a delirious high in his Cantonese career with a fistful of amazing set pieces that put other directors whole careers to shame. From the white knuckle teahouse opener to the relentless hospital closer, the film has more show stoppers than an MGM musical.\n\nClench your toothpick in gritted teeth and enjoy all over again.\""
