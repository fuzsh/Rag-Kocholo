Directed by Orson Welles. 111 minutes. 35mm.\n\nDETOUR\n\n(1945) Starring Tom Neal, Ann Savage, Edmund MacDonald. Directed by Edgar G. Ulmer. 68 minutes. DCP.\n\nLast year, film critic Gerry Peary was conducting a poll of the ten best film noirs ever made.

I’m one of those guys who likes Touch of Evil better than Citizen Kane because it’s bigger and it’s sleazier, and it’s tawdrier and it’s weird. And in the final scene that tinkling player-piano music and Marlene Dietrich take me to a place of great sadness and regret. “Adios.”"
