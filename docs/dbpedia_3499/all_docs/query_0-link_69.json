        "text": "Al dente cooking is a transitional state that lasts for a very short amount of time (one minute longer in boiling water makes pasta too soft, one minute shorter and it's still crunchy). For this reason, authentic Italian pasta packages state a precise cooking time, which is very reliable to make a good al dente pasta. A cooking time interval (e.g. \"7 to 10 minutes\") is usually given to accommodate to other countries taste, who may prefer a softer pasta, and therefore its presence could be a good indicator of an Italian look-alike pasta brand. In this case the lower figure indicates the al dente cooking.\n\nLacking this information, a good cooking time can be figured by cross section size, length and shape of pasta: obviously, thicker and squat formats require more time. Complex shapes, such as farfalle, can be trickier because a thick core could reach the al dente cooking while the thinner edges are already too soft.\n\nAs a rule of thumb, cooking times for common pasta formats are:\n\nLong and very thin (spaghettini, bavette): 6 min\n\nLong and thin (spaghetti, linguine, bucatini): 8 min\n\nShort and thick (maccheroni, rigatoni, fusilli): 12 min\n\nSmall and thick (farfalle) : 8 min\n\nSmall and thin (pasta usually boiled straight into broth): 6 min\n\nThese cooking times apply only for dry durum-wheat pasta; other types (such as fresh egg pasta) usually have a shorter cooking time.\n\nAfter straining the boiling water, pasta continues to cook by its own heat; for this reason it has to be eaten as soon as possible. Only for some Italian regional recipes (typically pasta boiled straight into a thick vegetable juice, e.g. pasta with beans, pasta with potatoes) you may want to let it rest for up to 5 minutes after straining to let the juices coagulate.\n\nAlso, for recipes where pasta has to undergo a second cooking after boiling (e.g. stir frying in a pan with vegetables, shrimps, mushrooms, etc.) a better result is obtained by boiling pasta just one minute less than the cooking time given on the package.\n\nother tips from an other Italian:\n\n\"With any type of pasta, if when you bite you can still see a white \"core\", that means it is not done. The white core is pasta that has not been hydrated yet.\" that's generally right.\n\nFirst, you have to distinguish what type of pasta you have. And mainly which kind of flour has been used. The main used are\n\na. durum wheat flour (used for dry pasta, orecchiette, semolino, couscous, some type of bread)\n\nb. soft wheat flour (and also chopped finer, called 00 flour from the extent of the tool for chopping, used for sweets, cakes, fresh pasta, like taglierini, tagliatelle, ravioli, agnolotti, lasagne, trenette [with pesto])\n\nc. a dough prepared with two-thirds of buckwheat flour (grano saraceno), which denotes their gray color, and a third of wheat flour (pizzoccheri)\n\nd. many other different types of flour, regional specific, or specific for some special preparations,most of all sweeties and cakes specials (pasta di mandorle).\n\nThe cooking depends on the type of flour used, on the texture, on the purpose and the results you want.\n\na. The dry pasta, made with durum wheat flour, have to be cooked \"al dente\".\n\n(!) You need a tall, narrow pot, plenty of water up to 2/3 of the pot. Boil over high heat and strong. Once you put the pasta should be turned quickly because otherwise the pieces are glued to one another. The fire must remain high, but when the water resumes boil the fire goes a little lowered, so that the foam that forms no bait from the pot, but remains strong boiling up to the edge. This is one of the secrets.\n\n\"Al dente\" means that you have to see in your plate spaghetti move like little snakes, as if they were alive. In the mouth must feel separately. This is achieved by controlling \"the clock\" time. Just before the exact moment, you take off a piece of spaghetti with a fork, cut in two with his nails, and you look at the center. If you see a white dot, it is uncooked flour. You'll try again almost immediately and the white point will be smaller. As soon as the white point disappears, you must act quickly.\n\nDrain the pasta very quickly, put into a bowl (pre-hot) with a little sauce. Add the rest of the sauce and stir quickly. Serve immediately while hot in hot plates. It is a race with time. The residual heat should remain in the plate but should not increase the cooking.\n\nb. Soft pasta is a northern product, very typic and traditional, often hand made, almost always made with one or two fresh eggs. soft pasta done with tendre wheat flour need a different cooking method. Past should NEVER be cooked \"al dente\", need to be soft, tendre and delicate.\n\nTaglierini, tagliolini and tagliatelle are usually made for soupe. The pasta cooked in broth should always be tender and it would be impossible to keep al dente (tender that with the pasta would not even be good).\n\nSimilarly, the filled pasta (ravioli, agnolotti, ravioli, and also lasagne) must obtain the softness required to blend better with the other ingredients. The cooking should be longer and the cooking time is less rigid. The boil does not have to be strong, the ravioli are to be turned over very gently with a slotted spoon. They must be drained gently, trying not to break them.\n\nThe lasagne, in the traditional recipe are cooked separately, al dente, one by one, and place on a clean towel to dry. Then they put in the baking dish, alternating the filling already cooked. We adds a little milk or white sauce (besciamelle, but little) because it does not dry out too much in the oven and sprinkle with parmesan au gratin.\n\n\"Throwing pasta on walls is for clowns. Don't do it. We don't.\" I agree. What film have you seen lately?\n\nThough I always just taste it myself, one way to tell that's pretty foolproof is to take a piece of the pasta out and cut through it with a knife. Then look at the cut ends--if the inside looks whiter or more opaque than the outside, it's not done yet. You don't necessarily want it to be the same all the way through, but when it's still partly dry inside it will look different.\n\nThis is harder to do with really thin pastas (angel hair, for example) because it's hard to see the center clearly. But for thicker ones it works pretty well. Like all these things, practice is the way--start checking and cutting the pasta early and you'll see how the inside changes as you go along. Over time you'll start to know what you want it to look like inside for the doneness you prefer.\n\nWhen it comes to spaghetti and sauce, I am finicky. Three things must be true.\n\nThe pasta noodles must be 'al-dente'.\n\nThe meat sauce must be thick enough to stand a metal ladle up in.\n\nThe two must never be mixed together until serving.\n\nMy first priority: Pasta must be al-dente. The taste method is the only thing that determines proper cooking time. The slight bit of stickiness that would cause a 'newbie' to try to make it 'stick to the wall' can be much more accurately determined by the ultimate, perfect testing tool... the mouth.\n\nUsing a 12-quart stockpot and WAY more water than the recipe for a 32oz. package of pasta would have recommended... put your dry noodles in the boiling water and reducing to simmer, until determining the doneness.\n\nSee Jason P Sallinger Mar 3 '16 at 17:50 (preparation instructions)\n\nNow it's time to slow down the cooking process...\n\nJust remove the noodles from the hot water with a colander and immerse the, still internally cooking, pasta in the cooler water, long enough to stir once or twice. When satisfied with the feel and doneness and temperature, remove with a colander and place on top of one or two, clean dish towels on a cookie sheet. Until it is time to serve the noodles, keep them in the oven at a low warming temperature.\n\nPut the meat sauce and ladle in a large serving bowl on the table with the other dishes. Serve the noodles, piping hot and dry from the oven, on each person's plate.\n\nPlace on the table.\n\nPerfect."
