        "text": "It's almost as easy as boiling water. Almost.\n\nHard-boiled eggs are pretty much the easiest thing you can make in a kitchen.\n\nAll you need is a pot of water and a timer.\n\nBut beware the pitfalls! That green ring around the yolk? That's an overcooked egg. Hard to peel? Yeah, there's a trick for that.\n\nRead on to unlock all the secrets behind the perfect hard-boiled egg.\n\nStart by placing eggs in a medium pot in a single layer and covering them with water. It's important they don't overlap and the pot isn't too crowded so they all cook at the same time. Bring them to a boil, remove from heat and cover. Let sit 10 minutes.\n\nYou know that creepy green-grey color that sometimes appears around the egg yolk? Well, there's a whole science-y reason behind why that happens.\n\nWhen cooked or heated, egg whites produce hydrogen sulfide. When this mingles with the iron in the egg yolk, it creates a reaction = green-grey color and sulfur-y smell.\n\nThe good news: It only happens when eggs are over-cooked or not cooled quickly enough. So it's preventable. You have the power. That's why this next step is IMPORTANT.\n\nTransfer the eggs to a bowl full of ice water to cool them down quickly. This will keep the yolks *bright* yellow.\n\nTo peel, crack an egg all over on a counter, then give the egg a little roll, pressing slightly till it's cracked all over. Then peel.\n\nThe fresher the egg, the harder it will be to peel. (Annoying, I know, but that's just how it is.) If your eggs are giving you trouble, take a deep breath and run them under cold water. The water will loosen the shell from the egg.\n\nThen you can make THESE deviled eggs.\n\nOh look! A video!\n\nBut what if you'd rather have a soft, delicious, just-a-little gooey yolk? Read on!\n\nThe perfect soft boiled egg has a just-set yolk, with a center that's still slightly runny, almost jammy.\n\nTo me, it's kind of like if a fried egg and a hard boiled egg had a baby. So, yeah, it's the perfect food.\n\nSo, just cook it like a hard-boiled egg but for less time, right?\n\nNot exactly. This technique is different than the hard-boiling above because It's easier to know for certain how long an egg is cooking when you drop it into boiling water rather than bring it up from cold. When you're aiming for a perfectly almost-cooked-but-still-kinda-runny center, the timing needs to be exact.\n\nTo start, bring a medium pot of water to a boil. Then, using a large spoon, gently lower in a few eggs (keep them in an even layer and don't crowd the pot). Boil them, uncovered, for 6 minutes.\n\nThen chill in an ice bath to stop the cooking (lest the yolk become...hardboiled), and peel as usual.\n\nThen you can really fancy-up your store bought ramen, like THIS.\n\nAnd a video for you, too!\n\nFor more tips on how to perfectly cook every type of egg, head HERE.\n\nShare This Article"
