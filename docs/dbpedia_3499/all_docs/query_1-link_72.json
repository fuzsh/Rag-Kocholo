        "text": "I love eggs and I love cooking them. They have been a constant in my cooking even before I took on cooking more seriously later on. Since I was little I loved cooking eggs. I remember hard boiling eggs with my mom, making omelettes, etc. Today‚Ä¶ on a skillet, eggs have to be cooked as gently as possible‚Ä¶ I love walks on the beach and sunsets and all that and I also love egg whites with no browning at all and egg yolks runny but not cold. It‚Äôs a fine balance and a fun challenge when making eggs for breakfast. My house could easily be an all-day breakfast joint. I love breakfast and I mostly it at non-breakfast times because either I‚Äôm too late for work or I feel way too lazy until about noon on weekends. Although‚Ä¶ that‚Äôs not true‚Ä¶ but some would disagree.\n\nDo you need boiling water to cook eggs?\n\nThe terms hard-boiled or soft-boiled are a bit misleading. Specially at sea level üôÇ Eggs don‚Äôt need to reach 212F (100C) to get cooked. They cook way below boiling temperature but for the purpose of this post, let‚Äôs assume we‚Äôre using boiling water to cook them eggs which is what we‚Äôre all most familiar with. We can get into sub-boiling temp egg cooking at another time. Sous vide time can wait. You sous vide enthusiasts out there are familiar with the concept of waiting, so let‚Äôs wait.\n\nThe 10 minute egg.\n\nCooking soft boiled eggs can be tricky. There are way too many variables. Specially temperature-related variables which are difficult to control if not impossible, but let‚Äôs just say that within a reasonable margin of error they can be controlled. The more we know about the variables we wanna control the better. Let‚Äôs for now only focus on 2:\n\nTemperature of the egg.\n\nTemperature of the water.\n\nWhat‚Äôs the internal temperature of an egg?\n\nCold eggs? room temperature eggs? somewhere in between? yeah.. I‚Äôm overwhelmed my self thinking about it and it‚Äôs not like we can stick a probe thermometer into an egg. Some people are ok with surprises and would ‚Äúwing‚Äù it being ok with whatever outcome‚Ä¶ sometimes, soft boiled eggs will be there, sometimes, overcooked rubbery HARDboiled instead‚Ä¶yay. Some people like you and me‚Ä¶ we prefer to predict the result. Just like roasting or baking‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs all the same. Controlling the outcome.\n\nSo what‚Äôs the internal temperature of an egg‚Ä¶. I don‚Äôt even wanna think about it. I usually store eggs in the fridge because cold eggs are more ‚Äúrobust‚Äù, the yolks don‚Äôt break as easily and that makes handling eggs easier. I don‚Äôt think eggs necessarily need to be store in the fridge though. They are just fine a room temperature for a long time. Anyways, if you store your eggs in the fridge which most people do‚Ä¶ then you‚Äôre half way there. That‚Äôs the temperature of our 10 minute egg before cooking. Fridge temp.\n\nHow much water do I need?\n\nThis is a tricky one. The number of eggs you‚Äôre cooking determines the cooking time period. It‚Äôs like microwaving water cups, time goes up as you add more water cups which means‚Ä¶ more heat will need to be applied for longer to get to the same to the temperature. So, what‚Äôs the formula? how much water do I need? well‚Ä¶ cooking science isn‚Äôt perfect‚Ä¶ at least not in my kitchen‚Ä¶ but say you have a pot that can hold 8 eggs. If the eggs are fresh they will sink to the bottom which means they will displace water equal to their volume which also means, you probably won‚Äôt need to add more water. The eggs should all lay in one layer at the bottom of the pot and the water level should cover them. That‚Äô how much water you need.\n\nDoes the water need to boil before I add the eggs?\n\nNo, that‚Äôs the beauty of this approach. Add fridge-cold eggs to a pot over hight heat with enough tap water to cover them, set the timer to 10 minutes and go away. There isn‚Äôt much else to it. I love simplification. Keep reading if you wanna soft-boil more than 1 or two eggs at a time.\n\n10 minutes for 10 eggs?\n\nOk, you‚Äôre right, 10 minutes for ONE egg doesn‚Äôt mean 10 minutes for 10 eggs or however many eggs you wanna cook. Like I said, there are many variables and the pot size is one of ‚Äôem. If you had a pot full of water the size of the planet it would never boil by applying heat from your little kitchen stove. So the size of the pot is important. The amount of water is important and the temperature of the eggs is important. To simplify things, let‚Äôs assume your eggs are fridge temperature, your pot fits the eggs snuggly and they all lay in one layer at the bottom of the pot barely covered with water. Then, add about 30 seconds per additional egg to the end cooking time. So 1 egg = 10 minutes then 10 eggs = 14.5 minutes. I hope I got that right.\n\nWhy is the math linear?\n\nI don‚Äôt think it is. But non-linear math would be a horrifying thing to calculate specially for me. So as long as the number of eggs being cooked isn‚Äôt more than a few‚Ä¶ 10 or so, you should be good (batch cooking, anyone?!). If you‚Äôre doing 1000 eggs in one pot‚Ä¶ good luck to you. The same methodology doesn‚Äôt apply to larger number of eggs mainly because the heat source remains the same as you add more stuff to the pot to heat up so things like dissipation, entropy and other cool concepts come into play and will ruin your day. The water amount might remain the same but the surface area will increase as more eggs get added to the pot meaning more energy will be required to cook them eggs not to mention the eggs are cold from the fridge and that ‚Äúcarryover coldness‚Äù will require more heat to warm them eggs up. It‚Äôs like heating up and ice bath as opposed to heating up tap water. More energy. More heat. Anyways, who needs to soft boil more than 10 eggs at a time, right? üôÇ\n\nIf you guys have any ideas on soft boiling eggs by the numbers or any egg cooking science, let me know. I‚Äôd love to get your input!\n\nHave fun!\n\nWanna get more sous-vide cooking guides and cool cooking how-to‚Äôs in your mailbox? You know what needs to be done!\n\nWe never spam.
