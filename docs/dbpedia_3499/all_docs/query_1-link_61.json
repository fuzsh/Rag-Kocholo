        "text": "Wong Jing delights and baffles with his filmmaking antics like never before for a crazily concocted “sequel”…\n\nThe wondrous world of Hong Kong movie marketing during its most flourishing 70s-90s decades never ceased to amaze. For example, I’ve previously spoken about how tangled of a mess the labeling for the Police Story series (and other Jackie Chan movies that had nothing to do with them) became in the US; or how amazing it was that the makers of Rich and Famous (1987) actually finished and released its sequel Tragic Hero (1987) before the original. But the international marketing genius behind a certain Wong Jing 1991 directorial effort took it even a step further: You see, John Woo’s Hard Boiled (1992) was so incredibly successful and acclaimed that they decided to make and release the sequel before it even existed!\n\nHence fans were finally given the retro-temporally long-awaited sequel Hard Boiled II (1991). But in all fairness (including for the many Western purists complaining about said marketing as a travesty and the epitome of local labels exploiting HK cinema), for this case they were actually just following the footsteps and style of those very HK elements they were working with. After all, Wong Jing knew more than a few things about questionable and manipulative marketing himself, and in fact also even knew about it specifically for John Woo movies, as the same producer-director-writer who put out the completely unrelated “sequel” Return to a Better Tomorrow (1994 — with the original title 新英雄本色 meaning no one can blame overseas marketing for it). That said, if this really had come out later, I wouldn’t have put it past Wong to name it Hard Boiled II either. So let’s not dwell on that! It’s what’s on the inside that counts — and brings even more questionable things up for discussion…\n\nFor keeping in mind the power with which the introduction to this film expresses the gravity of the situation at hand, I shall simply quote it:\n\nDue to the break out [sic] of the Gulf War, worldwide terrorists launch a series of attack [sic] aimed to arouse terror and confusion. Every political and religious influential leaders [sic] become [sic] their target. Thus, all the organizations of peace and security have to devote themselves in every horrible hours… [sic]\n\nUnder that tense atmosphere, the spiritual leader known as the Daka Lama (Law Shu-Kei, Troublesome Night 17) is under credible terror threat by the Japanese Red Army for his scheduled trip to Singapore. In addition to there being a huge bounty on his head, since it’s during the National Holiday, the police warn they’re already too stretched with the crowded celebrations (watching over them, that is) to really be bothered protecting him. Nevertheless, the lama heedlessly refuses to postpone his visit or even lay low. Fortunately, Interpol is on the scene to keep watch with a special anti-terror operation led by methodical officer Tai (Alan Tam, Rich and Famous) and his more aggressive partner Stone (Leung Kar-Yan, Dreadnaught), with the former having taken up the dangerous task of infiltrating a JRA cell.\n\nThe terror outfit is led by the vicious, heartless, inhuman “Kamakura” (Chin Ho) with particularly powerful support from the inhuman, heartless, vicious Saburō (Jackson Lau) and the heartless, inhuman, vicious Ayaka (???). Proving too slippery and slimy for Interpol to keep track of, before you know it, the JRA launches a relentless assault that lands the Lama in the hospital. To make things worse, the Lama turns out to have the ultra-rare blood type “P” that only a few others in Singapore and Hong Kong who can be counted on two hands have. With a mere projected 12 hours to live if he can’t get the blood transfusion, that leaves Tai and Stone in a frantic rush to locate those P-people for a chance to save the Lama before the JRA can to erase that chance.\n\nIn the midst of all of this, small-time triad mini-boss Big B (Andy Lau — not Amitabh Bachchan) is just trying to have a peaceful vacation away from troubles and away from the law with his girlfriend May (May Lo) in Singapore, though he can’t escape his own few loyal goons who decide to tag along. As always though this time for once by no fault of his own, BB lands in serious trouble that also leaves him wanting to make serious trouble when he and his girlfriend get inadvertently mixed up in all the Interpol-Lama-Red Army business. The end result renders him and his gang a rather dangerous wildcard at loggerheads with all three involved parties. Oh, and somewhere in the equation also lies liar/swindler extraordinaire Fatty (Eric Tsang, Gen-X Cops) who’s already on the run from gangsters he’s indebted to before running into all the aforementioned chaos.\n\nWith His Koliness, the Daka Lama in ICU, Singapore not giving a damn as they’re busy ensuring their own people a happy, peaceful new year, a useless hood from back home annoying them, and the Japanese penetrating the Impenetrable Fortress yet again, will two mismatched cops have any chance to save the day (no, half of a day) at all?\n\nFor action-oriented movies in particular, Japanese villains and heavies were an absolute linchpin of HK’s most pivotally flourishing 60s-70s period, hence their key pernicious presence in several of the most famous and iconic movies alone — Fist of Fury, Five Fingers of Death, Hapkido etc. So by the 80s and 90s when the industry made a major pivot towards modern settings, the best excuse to keep Japanese villains in the loop was either via the yakuza for triad movies, or the Japanese Red Army for anything else. It wasn’t a poor excuse, as the JRA were no joke and played a brief outsized role in global terror. While their targets included as wide a national and transnational business array as (in rough order of priority) the US, Japan, Israel, the UK, and France, their targeting sites spread far wider from Italy to Turkey and in one case, indeed Singapore.\n\nSo while the JRA never targeted anyone along the lines of a “Daka Lama,” it was within a fairly reasonable realm of possibility. And for having a marketing savvy ahead of his time for better and worse, Wong Jing always kept an eye on what was “trending” so to speak and had people talking for ways to make a quick HK buck or two or twenty million off it. So it could just as easily be another movie (A Better Tomorrow), a videogame (Future Cops) or contemporary terrorist threats and violence. For that, Wong also makes a strong allusion to the JRA’s most notorious and deadly attack (for those who don’t know I won’t “spoil”) — and turns it into an action movie scene for the entertainment of all.\n\nEven with all of that noted, it’s hard to believe just how much nonsense, madness and asininity is already crammed into the first 5 minutes of Hard Boiled II. For starters, while certainly by the 1990s even Japanese villains had at least begun to be consistently portrayed as human, HB2 has the most roundly demonic yet also cartoonlike caricature of them from any non-WWII setting HK film from the era I can think of. Hammily scowling in front of the Japanese flag, making death pledges while surrounded by guns, bombs and whores, licking on their weapons like animals, oral harakiri by uzi and [WARNING: MILD SPOILER] unhesitatingly killing not just one but two of their own girlfriends makes for an impressive introduction, no? And then there’s the whole “$100,000,000 bounty,” an offer that would normally be quite implausible; but since the movie specifies they’re talking about American dollars rather than HK or Singapore, it’s absurdly implausible.\n\nBack to that part about the flag again, let’s not forget that the Japanese Red Army’s highest stated goal after (as always) the destruction of the United States was the destruction or at least overthrow of the Japanese monarchy to make Japan part of a global revolution. In other words, they’d be the very last ones to be prominently hanging/wrapping/waving Yamato flags around. Oh yeah, and they also have distinctly yakuza tattoos here for some reason. In short, combining elements of international left-wing terror, right-wing fascist dictatorship and apolitical gangsterism and contract killing, we’re just dealing with an indomitably amalgamated composite of all there ever was to fear from modern Japan.\n\nNow returning to semantics and with respect to all the disappointed and flabbergasted fans from back in the day, claiming the actually non-existent Hard Boiled pedigree had a bigger problem than just the inaccuracies of following Wong’s own myopic vision. For some the issue was no doubt more about the audacity of the equation itself. But this need not be a matter of sizing films up against each other either; comparing John Woo putting his all into a project right before leaving HK filmmaking (and HK altogether) for about a decade and a half to Wong Jing screwing around for what was merely one of the five movies from 1991 he directed (and six more he wrote) just ain’t fair. So one is better to just appreciate HB2 for what it is… whatever it is.\n\nIf there’s one thing HB2 really is following the later original’s footsteps in, it’s the very frequent, unbridled, super-extended barrages of violence including one major scene that really does have strong similarity in setting to it. But while Hard Boiled had rhyme and reason even to its excesses, some of HB2’s violence is not so much excessive as outright pointless to a point less than flattering to its own narrative. For example, one scene where an innocent hostage is taken at gunpoint (not a spoiler since it happens so bloody much anyway) for a standoff only to be suddenly shot doesn’t serve any function in increasing the scene’s suspense (if anything, it’s the opposite) and doesn’t even show a logical purpose for the criminal’s plan to escape. The ludicrous level of violence is only made more glaring by the variety of lighthearted hijinks that are placed around it (or occasionally even alongside it).\n\nFamily comedy, pop culture jokes, sex jokes, political figure parody with pseudo-philosophical debate, and most unusually for this case, HK celebrity jokes including about the stars here are the jumbled order of the day. Even with my saying all of that, especially by Wong Jing screwing around standards, the story is actually well-conceived: I didn’t say that it was logical, let alone immaculately designed; it just has an appreciably madcap appeal. Even when they’re thin, the plot provides excellent excuses to run and fight all over town, with clusters of coincidences so contrived that they could make the most shameless 60s Taiwan director blush. HB2 has a winning way with connecting its improbabilities in order to squeeze out dramatic, suspenseful, and comedic impact about as far as can capably (if also cheaply) be done from the material. The preposterously coincidental outcome for one character targeted in a subway station is a complete delight in daftness.\n\nNeed we even get into the physics here? If there’s one thing Wong gets even more fixated with on this movie than exploring the entertainment value of the human toll from terror, it’s making stuff go boom. For people who don’t even know or like each other, police, street punks and random grifters sure have damned good coordination and synchronisation when they need to. Consistently being able to shoot speeding vehicles from speeding vehicles while they’re (as in cars) drifting while they’re (as in people) hanging out the window so that they immediately explode almost every time is superhuman acumen on the level of… I don’t know, Trigun? But other moments like Tai’s physics-defying (or worse yet, continuity-defying) acrobatics in pulling and flipping himself up in any situation make one think more wuxia than anime. Whatever the case, it’s not anything vaguely resembling reality or related plausibility even by 90s HK action standards.\n\nA surprise great asset to HB2 is the cinematography from none other than Jingle Ma, who by the end of the decade would also be a money-makin’-machine of a director himself. With photography both flashy and substantial, the way he showcases Singapore signals what would become one of his own directorial trademarks. But while Ma’s movies would tend to be among the most lighthearted of modern overseas romps and romances, here he turns Wong’s senseless carnage and demolition into scenic affairs all the same. So the bullets, blades and grenades follow everywhere, from the malls Singapore is famous for to the beaches to a cable car fight that’s far more comically crammed than dramatic like on say, A Man Called Tiger (1973).\n\nThen there’s the equally front-and-centre action choreography from Blacky Ko. In addition to doing martial arts (that we get some of here) and gunfights (that we get lots of here), Ko specialised above all as a vehicular action director of sorts including with memorable c[h]ases for Yes, Madam! (1985) and Armour of God (1986). So with Ma and Ko coordinating (with additional respect to HK cyclist-stuntmen for what looks like one of their most heavy-duty scenes of the period), the highlight of this whole movie comes in the form — and formation — of a beautifully shot and staged motorcycle chase sequence that’s even more of a sight before all the shooting and skidding starts. Their work together is invaluable in lifting the movie.\n\nEvidently, this whole star cast was shuffled around in other Wong movies from the same period. To be playing a gangster in a highly violent and at least thematically dark movie about terrorism, it may be a surprise that this was probably the movie and performance Andy Lau took himself the least seriously on up to then. In fact, his performance and lines get even sillier than on what were supposed to be pure comedy or mou lei tau movies he led from the time like What a Hero! (1992). But when noting the certified superstar he had become with his previous few movies, the willingness he still showed to dive into nonsense like this is if nothing else, testament to his open-mindedness, as Chow Yun-Fat for example was always too cool to let himself go on this level [note: that is not criticism]. While Lau was really just starting with this shtick, Tsang’s loud, annoying, cowardly conman was by this point all too typical (even if Wong added random absurd acrobatic feats to it).\n\nIn what becomes that much bigger of a problem for one of the only major characters that’s supposed to be taken seriously all through, Ho’s villain sometimes looks silly, acts silly, and good heavens does he sound silly (not to mention his silly name and silly “shakuhachi” theme). One absurdity most international audiences will be spared from for the blessing of not being able to notice, at least, is the bloody ridiculous “Japanese” accent he speaks Mandarin with that could hold its own against any from 1960s Hollywood. Also from the sound of it I think the fellow phonetically memorised a lot of his Japanese dialogue in addition to striving to get down all the growling and snarling and whatnot; so to his defence, the actor himself is not even really the one to blame for the rather risible results of his role. Jackson Lau and Ms. ??? actually do better as less hyperbolic subordinates.\n\nIt would probably be a stretch to call Hard Boiled II: The Last Blood a *good* movie or anything. But for whatever it isn’t and whatever it’s supposed to be, it sure is entertaining. It’s way more entertaining than it is good, way more clever than it is intelligent, and crafted with way more creativity than actual craft. So it’s easy to understand why it ultimately made way more dollars than it did sense, from the story to the action to the characters all the way down to the title. For those looking for a fun time while also specifically wanting to look away from logic, or sanity, or good taste for a while — and most of us have such a mood on occasion at least — and don’t mind Wong Jing being Wong Jing even more than Wong Jing on the average day, just boil those eggs hard and break them over someone’s head until they at last bleed.\n\n“Don’t die, please don’t die! We didn’t get to make babies!”\n\nHard Boiled II: The Last Blood is available now from 88 Films.\n\nSide notes\n\nThe longtime leader/figurehead of the JRA, Fusaku Shigenobu — who just happened to be released from prison a year before this release — became probably the most [in]famous female terrorist in modern history alongside (her friend) Leila Khaled, going on after “retirement” to become a bestselling author, getting speaking engagements through many parts of the world and even having a fragrance named after her. Also reflective of that, I’m convinced she and the more general JRA’s real history not only inspired this film, but others including Patrick Tam’s Nomad (1982), which while by all means being stylised in its depiction still made considerably more sense than what’s seen here.\n\nWhile there’s clearly a decent bit of graininess to the look of this edition, I’m betting the most was made of what was available which is quite good enough for this movie. And as Wong Jing is not exactly Wong Kar-Wai or even Taylor Wong as far as being finicky about the preservation, presentation or restoration of his films goes, he probably didn’t even expect us to be watching this stuff like this by this time. On another note, the subtitler sometimes makes amusing efforts to assuage Wong’s less graceful dialogue (for example, when a character proclaims, “The whole world wants to see Brigitte Lin naked,” the subtitles replace it with, “Many men want to…”)\n\nWong Jing Schlock Stats [NOTE: these calculations are probably too low for only having considered them late in]:"
