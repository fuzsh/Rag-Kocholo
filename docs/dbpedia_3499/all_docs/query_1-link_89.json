        "text": "Happy October, everybody! Welcome to our new menu. Last year we spent the month of Halloween making spooky Dracula recipes, but this year we‚Äôre taking a murder mystery approach: an Agatha Christie menu! As many of you know by now, I‚Äôm a die hard Christie groupie‚Ä¶so I didn‚Äôt need much of an excuse to dedicate a menu to her.\n\nOur first dish will delight Hercule Poirot fans. We‚Äôre making Poirot‚Äôs breakfast! Every single morning the detail-oriented detective eats the same thing: two symmetrical boiled eggs and a piece of toast cut into perfect squares, trimmed of crust. And in the TV show, the toast squares are topped with perfect circles of jam. We made our own jam using this recipe and decorated the eggs to look like the famous detective himself (after all, he‚Äôs said to have a head shaped just like an egg). I‚Äôm sure Poirot would find this breakfast to be tres magnifique!\n\nPoirot‚Äôs Breakfast\n\n‚ÄúOrder and method are my gods. For my breakfast, I have only toast which is cut into neat little squares. The eggs ‚Äì there must be two ‚Äì they must be identical in size ‚Ä¶‚Äù\n\n‚Äî A letter from ‚ÄúHercule Poirot‚Äù to Agatha Christie‚Äôs American publishers in 1936\n\nINGREDIENTS:\n\nFor the Jam: 8 oz fresh strawberries, 3/8 cup sugar, 1 tbsp lemon juice\n\n2 hard or soft boiled eggs (the books don‚Äôt specify, though in the show it looks like they may be soft)\n\n1 slice of bread\n\nFor the egg decorations you‚Äôll need a fine-tipped permanent marker, thin black ribbon, and super glue.\n\nMakes breakfast for 1\n\nINSTRUCTIONS:\n\nFirst, wash and coarsely chop your strawberries.\n\nPlace them in a saucepan with the sugar and lemon juice. Heat on medium-low and stir until the sugar dissolves.\n\nTurn the heat up to medium-high and bring to a rolling boil. Turn the heat down to medium and heat for about 10 minutes, stirring and mashing the strawberries frequently until the jam has thickened and bubbles cover the surface of the jam. I used a potato masher to help crush the berries, but you can also use the back of a spoon.\n\nPour the thickened jam into a jar, seal it, and let it cool to room temperature (refrigerate once cooled if you don‚Äôt plan to serve it right away). For a faster cooling time, leave the lid off the jam jar and place the jar in an ice bath.\n\nWhile you wait, decorate your eggs. I used a fine-tipped black Sharpie to draw the mustaches and eyes, but make sure the egg is room temp before you start (otherwise the egg will sweat, and the marker won‚Äôt draw properly). Tie little bows out of thin black ribbon and use a dot of super glue to fix them onto the eggs.\n\nLightly toast your bread. With a tape measure and small, sharp knife trim away the crust in perfectly straight lines and cut the toast into 4 identical squares. It doesn‚Äôt really matter how big they are as long as they‚Äôre the same size.\n\nWhen your jam is cool, spoon it into a sandwich bag. Seal the bag and cut off one of the corners. Pipe 4 identical circles of jam into the exact center of your toast squares.\n\nServe in order to stimulate your little grey cells before going out to solve a murder!\n\nYou have no idea how long I‚Äôve wanted to make an Agatha Christie menu! I spent ages planning this one, since finding the right combination of foods was a bit difficult. I think I‚Äôve finally settled on a well-composed set of recipes, but if there are any specific Christie recipes you really want to see, let me know and I‚Äôll try to fit them in! üôÇ\n\nLike this:\n\nLike Loading...\n\nRelated"
