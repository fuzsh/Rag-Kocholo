        "text": "REGISTRATION FOR THIS EVENT IS CLOSED DUE TO CAPACITY!\n\nMajor League Eating is proud to announce the inaugural Radcliff Days World Hard-Boiled Egg Eating Championship—an 8-minute, all-you-can-eat celebration of the egg-based lifestyle. This event will be held as part of Radcliff, KY's annual fall festival, Radcliff Days.\n\nThe hard-boiled egg is a simple food and yet it is the one that for years presented the greatest challenge to competitive eaters. For if you say something for long enough it becomes accepted law. To wit: After actor George Kennedy muttered the line, \"Nobody can eat 50 eggs,\" in the 1967 Paul Newman prison hunkfest Cool Hand Luke, no one tried. Why would you? Eating 50 eggs? That was like leaping from a cliff edge and expecting to fly. A madness.\n\nBut that was before a young lady from Alexandria, VA, named Sonya Thomas took to the MLE stage in exhibition on September 13, 2003 and put down 65 hard-boiled eggs in 6 minutes and 40 seconds. If that sounds like an odd time limit for a sanctioned MLE event, you would be right—she ate the event out of eggs. Someone eating 65 eggs was preposterous. And then it happened. A Black Swan moment that shifted the global mindset forever; Nassim Nicholas Taleb commented on Sonya's feat in his New York Times bestseller of the same name.\n\nTen years hence the record still stands and it still amazes. History will be made at the first-ever Radcliff Days World Hard-Boiled Egg Eating Championship. This is the first open hard-boiled egg eating competition sanctioned by MLE and the first to be held at the new official 8-minute time length. So, come one, come all to the Radcliff Days World Hard-Boiled Egg Eating Championship! At the table or in the crowd, there's no better place to be than an MLE event! Don't you ever miss it!\n\nThis contest will take place at 2pm Eastern, on Saturday, October 5, 2013 at City Park North, City Park Drive, Radcliff, KY!\n\nTOTAL PRIZE PURSE: $3,000! 1st - $1,500 2nd - $1,000 3rd - $500\n\nAbout Radcliff Days! Radcliff Days is the annual fall festival for the City of Radcliff, KY. The day of festivities will start off at 10 a.m. with a parade down Dixie Highway, the main street in Radcliff. When the parade ends, head over to Radcliff City Park North and join us for more fun, such as our October Village, including a beer tent. At 2 p.m., Major League Eating hosts the Radcliff Days World Hard-Boiled Egg Eating Championship, then stay for live music and end the night with a family movie night in the park at 8 p.m.\n\nCLICK HERE to find out more about Radcliff Days and the City of Radcliff, KY!\n\nBecome a fan of the MLE Facebook Page\n\nFor instant results to all Major League Eating Contests, follow @eatingcontest.\n\n*All applicants must be 18 years of age or older and fully acknowledge and understand the inherent dangers and risks associated with participating in an eating contest.
