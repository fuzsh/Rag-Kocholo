        "text": "Last month’s column on the senior prank “The Last Laugh” that was painted on Springfield High’s old smokestack in 1962 went over pretty well, so here’s another classic SHS episode that happened six years later.\n\nI stumbled across this by accident, but in the winter of 1968, a couple of SHS seniors engaged in an “egg-off.” This was inspired by the famous hard-boiled egg-eating scene in “Cool Hand Luke,” which had been released a few months earlier.\n\nFirst up was SHS senior Tim Dunham, who ate 55 hard-boiled eggs in one hour. It made the front page of this newspaper on Monday, Feb. 26, 1968, under the obligatory headline: “Claims Title of Eggspert.” Insert collective groan here.\n\nAccording to the article, “His mother and official egg chef reported today the youth hadn’t eaten anything all day Sunday and took only a few sips of water and a soft drink as he consumed the eggs. Mrs. Dunham reported her son was a little queasy after he finished breaking the record. ‘He doesn’t even care for eggs,’ Mrs. Dunham said.”\n\nIn the article, Tim’s mother, Imo Dunham, says her son decided to go for it after he and friends saw the movie and wondered if it could be done. “I tried to talk him out of it,” she said, “but he was very determined.” The article concludes by noting that Tim left for school on Monday with no eggs for breakfast.\n\nThe newspaper declared Tim’s accomplishment a world record. Doing so was much easier then.\n\nAnother Springfieldian, Herb Kaiserman, had claimed the title after eating 53 hard-boiled eggs in one hour on Feb. 12 on the campus of McKendree College in Lebanon. It’s all Hollywood’s fault.\n\nSo, I said to myself, I wonder where this Tim Dunham is today and whether he recalls his legendary feat of eating 55 eggs in an hour. I found him. He is still in Springfield, having worked for Ameren for 40 years.\n\n“It was a crazy thing,’ says Tim. “We were high school kids and sometimes we weren’t the smartest kids in the world. But it was presented to me as a challenge.”\n\nWell, then, that explains it.\n\n“I thought, well, it was only one egg every minute. I could do that,” Tim recalls. But it turned out to be more of a problem.\n\nIn the movie, actor George Kennedy plays Dragline, the fellow convict who eggs on (another groaner — forgive me) Luke as he lay flat on his back eating egg after egg. In Tim’s case, his friend Jim Lanham played the part of Dragline.\n\n“I remember laying in the back seat of a car,” Tim says. “Jim Lanham was giving me sips of water and putting another egg down my mouth every five minutes.”\n\nGeorge Kennedy won an Oscar. Jim Lanham? Probably not.\n\nTim says that after the article appeared, a Springfield doctor took the liberty of calling the Dunham home.\n\n“He said, ‘Tell that young man to never do that again,’ “ Tim says. He didn’t really need the advice because he had already made up his mind.\n\nBut as they used to say in the Old West, there’s always a faster gun. Two days later. Parking lot of Springfield High. The challenger? Dennis Rowe, another senior, armed with five-dozen eggs. It was on.\n\nThe best part, for me anyway, is that the subsequent story about Dennis gave the paper another chance at the “eggspert” headline. It didn’t disappoint. “New eggspert!” it read.\n\nAnd so there was. Dennis ate 60 eggs in an hour to dethrone Tim Dunham. There were 30 SHS students gathered in the parking lot just to watch the spectacle. The official timekeeper was SHS student Danny Hirstein. Danny is quoted as saying Dennis ate an amazing 30 eggs in the first 10 minutes and hung on from there.\n\nSad to say that Danny Hirstein, son of Wally Hirstein of Two Brothers tavern fame, died of illness in 1992. I could not find Dennis Rowe to ask if he recalled what he did.\n\nBut, then, how could he ever forget?\n\nKnow of something quirky? Emotional? Funny? Inspiring?
