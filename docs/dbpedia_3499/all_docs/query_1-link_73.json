        "text": "While making hard boiled eggs is not a difficult task, this method makes it even more simple!\n\nOver the years, I’ve tried many methods of making hard-boiled eggs. I even shared my favorite method with you last year. That method is still the one I would choose if I didn’t have an Instant Pot. (and you can find my deviled eggs recipe at that link!)\n\nSince I do have one of these magic pots, this is my most-used method to make hard-boiled eggs. Typically, in the time it would take to get a pot of water boiling and place the eggs in the pot, the IP has already completed the cook cycle and is on the natural pressure release stage.\n\nWe have hens, so our eggs are very fresh. Anyone who has ever tried to make pretty hard-boiled eggs from very fresh eggs can attest to the difficulty in this job. With the Instant Pot, it doesn’t matter how fresh the eggs are, they peel beautifully!\n\nIt’s as simple as adding water to the IP insert, adding a rack, adding eggs, securing the lid, moving the vent to pressurize, and pushing a few buttons. That’s it!\n\nNeed an organized place to keep all of those notes you’re acquiring for your magic pot? Enter your e-mail address below and download my two cheat sheets!\n\nYou can find all of my Instant Pot recipes and tips at this page!\n\nTypically, I make a dozen eggs at a time. I’ll turn those eggs into egg salad, add them to tuna or macaroni salad, or store them in a container for quick snacks.\n\n*Tip- when storing peeled hard boiled eggs (and I do recommend peeling them before storage!), add a paper towel to the container. The towel will absorb the water and keep your eggs from getting soggy bottoms.\n\nSuper Simple Hard Boiled Eggs in the Instant Pot:\n\nTo make these super simple hard-boiled eggs, I’ve included a printable “recipe” card for you. Truly, this is one of the first foods that I recommend new Instant Pot owners make. It’s the one that I had my eldest daughter make and now she’s a pro!\n\nWhat is your favorite food to cook in your Instant Pot?"
