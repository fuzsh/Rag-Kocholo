        "text": "Perfectly peeled hard boiled eggs have eluded me forever, until now! I know that I am not only person on Earth that gets excited over perfectly peeled hard boiled eggs. Donâ€™t be shy, I see you smiling because you know exactly what I am talking about.\n\n*This post contains affiliate links and you can read my full disclosure here.\n\nLast fall I purchased and Instant Pot (affiliate link) and one of the suggested beginner recipes (besides boiling water) is to make hard boiled eggs. My first thought was why would anyone want to make hard boiled eggs in a pressure cooker?\n\nWhen I make hard boiled eggs on the stove top I set the timer for 16 minutes to bring the eggs to a boil. Then I turn them off and let them sit for 18 minutes. Then they get cold water for 5 minutes. Then I have to pick and peel the egg shells off and my eggs look like a mess. Thatâ€™s a total of 39 minutes with me babysitting a pot of eggs.\n\nBut then I tried making hard boiled eggs in the Instant Pot and it forever changed my egg making ways.\n\nNeedless to say, Facebook and Pinterest are filled with tons of opinions and recipes on how to make hard boiled eggs in the Instant Pot.\n\nSince I was still an Instant Pot newbie I decided to give it a try and use the 2-10-5 method which means cook for 2 minutes with 10 minutes of natural pressure release (NPR) and 5 minute ice bath.\n\nHow to Make Perfectly Peeled Hard Boiled Eggs\n\nWhen I make eggs in the Instant Pot I put them on the metal trivot that came with the pot (some people use a steam basket to keep the eggs from touching the pan). Then I add one cup of water to the pot, set the timer for 2 minutes on manual high pressure and I walk away.\n\nIt takes the Instant Pot a few minutes to come to pressure and then it cooks the eggs for 2 minutes. After the 2 minute cooking time is done I let the pot sit and do a natural pressure release (NPR) for 10 minutes. After the NPR process the eggs get a ice cold water bath for 5 minutes.\n\nNow here is where the magic happens, I crack the egg shell and when I start the peeling process the shell practically falls off of the egg. I am not kidding, it literally falls off. Take a look at my pile of shells in picture above and note how big the shell pieces are.\n\nEvery single time I have made eggs in my Instant Pot I get perfectly peeled hard boiled eggs. Oh itâ€™s the little things in life that make me smile. ðŸ™‚"
