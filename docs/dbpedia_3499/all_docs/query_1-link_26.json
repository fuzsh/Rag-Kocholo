        "text": "English subtitles do not go well with a foreign-language action film. If you spend time reading the titles, then you can't really appreciate the action. But if you stare raptly at the action, then you often don't know the reasons behind what's going on.\n\nThis was one of my problems watching \"Hard-Boiled,\" the 1992 Hong Kong melodrama opening today at the Cinema Village with a Mandarin Chinese soundtrack. \"Hard-Boiled\" is the work of John Woo, who, in his mid-40's, is being celebrated by a number of critics here and abroad as the new master of the action-film genre. His first Hollywood movie, Jean-Claude Van Damme's \"Hard Target,\" is due for release later this year.\n\n\"Hard-Boiled\" is being presented here in what's described as the \"full-length director's cut,\" which means that it runs 127 minutes. The movie was apparently abbreviated by the Hong Kong censors, who objected to the violence. Just why, I'm not sure. Films as packed with violence as this, but with little in the way of a coherent story to give the violence meaning, are no less serene than \"Swan Lake,\" if somewhat more instructive.\n\nAlso adding to the film's running time is Mr. Woo's tendency to slip into slow motion every time his characters aim guns at each other, are blown up, catch fire or deal with other mortal tests. Virtually every action scene in \"Hard-Boiled\" becomes a mini-homage to the slow-motion blood ballets Sam Peckinpah introduced in \"The Wild Bunch.\""
