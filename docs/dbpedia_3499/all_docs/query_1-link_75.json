        "text": "Cooking food takes time, and every food must be cooked for a certain amount of time to bring out the desired flavour. However, since desirability is subjective, there is no single correct cooking time. The same principle applies to eggs, one of the healthiest and most widely consumed foods on the planet. Boiled eggs are a preferred choice for a lot of egg lovers, but the desired consistency of the yolk and albumin varies from person to person.\n\nBoiling eggs is an easy task. Simply take the desired amount of eggs, place them carefully in a pot, and fill the pot with enough water to submerge the eggs completely. Then place the pot on the stove, and leave it on a high flame. Eggs usually boil in seven minutes, but depending on how you like them, you can leave them to boil for longer. To help every individual get their desired boiled eggs, here is a guide to tell you how long you should boil an egg.\n\nFor a soft, dark, and runny yolk, along with a slightly watery albumin, seven minutes is the perfect amount of boiling time. For a less runny but semi solid egg yolk with a slightly firmer white, boil the egg for eight minutes. For a soft yolk and firm albumin, boiling the egg for ten minutes should do the trick. For a fully hard-boiled egg with a firm yolk and firm albumin, boil the egg for twelve minutes.\n\nThe time taken for eggs to boil varies with size. Smaller eggs will cook quicker as compared to large ones, and this guide was based on standard medium sized eggs. Also, the time taken to cook eggs varies with altitude due to changes in atmospheric pressure. Water boils at a lower temperature in higher altitude, therefore boiling eggs may require more time to cook."
