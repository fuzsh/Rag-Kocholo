        "text": "While they're great all year long, if there was a season for hard-boiled eggs, it would surely be springtime. As Easter Sunday approaches and the annual egg decorating spree, followed by a friendly Easter egg hunt, gets underway, many of us are boiling up big batches to decorate, and later to eat (be sure to use food safe food coloring if you plan on eating your dyed eggs). In need of a boiling refresher? Here's how to make absolutely perfect hard-boiled eggs every time.\n\nBut before you go gobbling up your Easter table displays, red on to find out how long hard-boiled eggs last either unrefrigerated or in the refrigerator. Wondering if you can eat a 10 day old hard-boiled egg? How long do they last shelled vs unshelled? We've got all the nitty gritty details for you. That way, no one has to spend April 9—or any other day of the year, for that matter—feeling ill over a rotten egg.\n\nHow long do hard-boiled eggs last in the refrigerator?\n\nAs with raw eggs, hard-boiled eggs last longest when stored in the refrigerator. According to The American Egg Board, hard-boiled eggs, still in their shell or peeled, will remain tasty for about a week when properly stored (which means in a fridge that is no warmer than 40°F). The USDA, which is in charge of food safety, agrees. Neither site recommends freezing hard-boiled eggs, whether in the shell or not: While it won't cause sickness, it'll ruin the egg.\n\nWhat's the best way to store hard-boiled eggs in the fridge?\n\nYou should let your hard-boiled eggs come to room temp (about 10 to 15 minutes) and then put them in the fridge. If you put too many in the fridge hot, and they don't have enough air to circulate around them, it could warm up nearby food and lead to other things spoiling. Hard-boiled eggs can be stored in the same packaging you bought them in, as long as none of the eggs you bought were broken.\n\nHow long do hard-boiled eggs last at room temperature?\n\nAccording to the USDA, unpreserved food, whether or not it's cooked, should never be left in what is called \"the danger zone\"—temperatures between 40 and 140°F for more than two hours. That's because that is the temperature range where dangerous bacteria grow the most quickly. And in fact, if it's over 90°F (say, at a backyard barbecue or summer picnic), easily spoiled items needed to be discarded after just one hour.\n\nSo if you're trying to be food-safe, you may want to stick to hiding the candy-filled plastic eggs or use \"blown\" eggs for dying. If you insist on using a hard-boiled dozen for decorating hide them right before the hunt, and make them all very easy to find!\n\nWhat can you do with leftover hard-boiled eggs?\n\nHard-boiled eggs make great healthy snacks or additions to lunch, and we'll never say no to a good-old egg-salad sandwich, but one of our favorite ways to use up all our Easter eggs is by making a giant platter of one (or more) of our deviled-egg recipes for Easter brunch!\n\nCan you store hard-boiled eggs in vinegar?\n\nIf you've got far too many hard-boiled eggs to eat within a week (it happens!) and just can't stomach the thought of tossing them, there's an easy solution: simply pickle them! Peeled hard-boiled eggs can be quick-pickled and will last three or four months in the fridge. They make a delicious snack!\n\nTo quick-pickle hard boiled eggs, simply put the eggs in a heat-proof sealable glass jar (such as a wide-mouth mason jar), and add some dill, garlic, or both, if you like. Bring some white vinegar to a boil along with any other pickling spices or flavors you want: cloves, black pepper, salt or sugar. When the vinegar has just boiled, pour it over the eggs, let cool, seal the jar(s), and then store in the fridge. You're all set!\n\nHow can you tell if a hard-boiled egg has gone bad?\n\nIf you've ever discovered an Easter egg days (or more) later, then unfortunately, you know how easy it is to tell when they go bad. Even mildly rotten eggs will give off that sulfurous smell of, well, rotten eggs! This is because of a chemical reaction: Naturally occurring sulfur in egg whites breaks down to Hydrogen sulfide, which creates that noxious odor.\n\nBut, frankly, if you're unsure whether an egg has been sitting out too long, just toss it — it's not worth the risk.\n\n.."
