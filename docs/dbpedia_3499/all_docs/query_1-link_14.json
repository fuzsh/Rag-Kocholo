        "text": "I think this is definitely one of the best action movies ever made? Anybody else agree?\n\nI love the Hospital Shootout, it last for atleast thirty minutes. Chow Yun-Fat’s character Tequila is a classic John Woo character…as always he kicks some ass. There are a lot of great shootouts, but I’d have to say the Teahouse shoot out is my favorite, I love the way it ends 8)\n\nThe shoot-out is so cool. I like Hard Boiled better than the Killer I think. I haven’t seen that many Woo movies but thus far I think he’s a little overrated. I like Johnny To’s films more…\n\nA Better Tomorrow is one of the best HK movies ever. ABT II is over-rated. It’s good but not great by any means. Leslie Cheung’s and Ti Lung’s scenes are great, but anything with Chow Yun Fat or Dean Shek sucks. Except the ending of course.\n\nbtw, Woo originally wanted to concentrate on Cheung and Lung, but Tsui Hark demanded screentime for Dean Shek\n\nAPOLOGIZE TO THE RICE, RIGHT NOW!\n\nYeah I know, he even disowned it, except for the mansion shoot out… But I loved it, overrated or not. I liked every scene, but I’ll have to admit I did like the Kit-Ho scenes better.\n\nI’ve seen a better tomorrow(and Hard-Boiled, the Killer and MI:II) and that was the movie I was especially dissapointed in. I don’t remember much now though so maybe I’ll have to see it again.\n\nActually I think I need to be bit more specific. A Better Tomorrow is\n\n[quote=“Hung Fist”]\n\none of the best HK movies ever.\n\n[/quote]\n\none of the best Movies ever\n\nbut each to their own\n\n[quote=“Hung Fist”]\n\none of the best Movies ever\n\n[/quote]\n\nYeah 8)\n\nI like all of his last Hong Kong films… I should be getting Last Hurrah for Chivalry sometime soon. I’ve heard that his earlier films aren’t that good, I’ll have to see.\n\n[quote=“Hung Fist”]\n\nLast Hurrah is a masterpiece. 4,5/5\n\nHand of Death is also a very good old school movie. 4/5\n\n[/quote]\n\nyea hand of death is really good. a solid jackie chan film before he came here to the USA and his career in my opinion went to shit.\n\nI was gonna buy the Criterion version until I found this was coming out a little while ago.\n\nAnd that’s the best DVD cover for Hard Boiled that I’ve seen, usually they have CYF with the baby in his arm.\n\nThat is one kick ass cover, I have the one with the baby in his arms and it just looks cheesy. When I want my friends to watch it they think it just looks dumb"
