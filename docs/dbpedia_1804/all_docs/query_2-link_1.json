        "text": "Discussion\n\nIn this study, the most common alterations in chest CT scan of GL-ILD patients (observed in more than 50% of cases) were bronchiectasis (commonly central and of low severity), small nodules (without a perilymphatic distribution) (Figure ), consolidations (Figure ), GGO, parenchymal scars/bands and enlarged mediastinal lymph nodes. At variance, previous works reported consolidations and GGO as less usual findings [13, 28]. In our opinion, this difference could be related to different phases of the disease and/or enrollment criteria for CT evaluation: in our study, the low frequency of fibrotic ILD (Figure ) compared to consolidation and GGO, suggests that these latter were usually sustained by early-inflammatory disease, while features of fibrotic ILD may be expression of an end-stage ILD. When comparing with CVID patients without GL-ILD, we found that small nodules (especially if >3), GGO, consolidations, reticulations, fibrotic ILD and lymph nodes enlargement should raise the suspicion of GL-ILD with more confidence, matching what was previously observed by Cinetto et al. [9].\n\nGL-ILD was usually predominant at lower fields (Figure ), confirming that lung bases are the most involved parts, as firstly observed by Torigian et al. [21] and confirmed by Pac et al. [20] in a small cohort of subjects with primary immunodeficiency, mostly CVID. Moreover, considering the chronic evolutions of ILDs, the observation that reticulations and fibrotic ILD were significantly more frequent in lower fields raises the hypothesis that lung bases are firstly involved in a temporal perspective.\n\nAnother interesting finding regards the distribution of nodules. Radiologically, nodules centered in the secondary lobule without contact with pleural, peri-bronchovascular surfaces or interlobular septa may be described as centrilobular, usually sustained by a bronchiolar spread of inflammation. Conversely, nodules that are predominantly located along pleural, peri-bronchovascular surfaces or interlobular septa may be described as peri-lymphatic. Lastly, if they are distributed without any predominance, a random pattern is defined, usually due to hematogenous metastatic or infective spread [29]. In our study, nodules were usually non-perylymphatic. This result was partially unexpected, since a perilymphatic distribution is the hallmark of lung diseases involving the lymphatic structures and data in literature, derived from small cohorts, are conflicting [20, 21, 30]. However, in our opinion, in CVID patients, small inhaled antigens could determine a peribronchiolar reaction with an increase in centrilobular nodules, justifying the relative lower frequency of perilymphtic nodules.\n\nTherefore, a predominant lower field involvement and a predominant non-perilymphatic nodules distribution may be helpful in differential diagnosis, in particular with sarcoidosis [5, 18, 30]. In fact, the typical radiologic features of pulmonary sarcoidosis are perylimphatic nodules involving middle-upper fields [18, 30]. Moreover, in sarcoidosis, bronchiectasis is part of the fibrotic stage, actually representing traction bronchiectasis inside fibrosis [18]. In our patients, fibrotic ILD was a way less common than bronchiectasis; this suggests that, in GL-ILD, bronchiectasis may be observed as a “pure” finding (Figure ) rather than secondary to fibrosis. In line with this hypothesis, we did not find a relationship between bronchiectasis and DLCO reduction [31]. Non-traction bronchiectasis may thus be not a specific feature of GL-ILD, but the result of chronic airway damage [1]. Lastly, although enlarged lymph nodes may be observed in both affections (Figure ), we found no mediastinal lymph nodes calcifications, a finding that might instead suggest sarcoidosis [18]. Other potential concerns for differential diagnosis are represented by consolidations, tree in bud appearance, bronchial wall thickening and mucous plugs, all possible signs of infections that may also be present in GL-ILD. Similarly, we often observed a halo sign surrounding solid lung nodules that can be a manifestation of both organizing pneumonia and different infections, e.g. opportunistic infection, as invasive aspergillosis [23]. However, we did not observe cavitation/necrosis that could instead support the hypothesis of a superimposed infective pneumonia [1, 19]. Another challenging differential diagnosis may be represented by lung lymphomas, in this at-risk population. Unfortunately, lymphomas have a polymorphic appearance [17] and we are not aware of any feature for a confident CT differential diagnosis.\n\nIn terms of correlation between radiologic findings and lung function, we also observed that reticulations and fibrotic ILD were associated with a reduction of FEV1%, FVC%, TLC% and DLCO% predicted, as observed in pulmonary fibrosis [31, 32]; the high proportion of patients with reticulation that had also features of fibrotic ILD could justify the results. Alternatively, reticulations might also be the expression of tiny fibrosis in the absence of traction bronchiectasis and parenchymal distortions. Moreover, we identified some peculiar immunological features related to the CT abnormalities. As already reported, low IgA and IgG are associated with GL-ILD diagnosis [9], and low IgA are described also in CVID patients with bronchiectasis [3, 33]. Thus, the correlation between some radiological items (fibrosis, GGO and bronchiectasis) and low immunoglobulin levels in our GL-ILD cohort was not surprising. On the contrary, the association of low white blood cells count and higher CD4+ T cells in peripheral blood with GGO may reflect a GL-ILD-related perturbation in leukocytes trafficking, with preferential accumulation of CD4+ T cells in the lungs airways [34] and parenchima [35], and a possible expansion of memory CD4+ T cells differentiated towards a CXCR3+CCR6− Th1 phenotype [36].\n\nWe then focused on identifying the relevant factors, available at the time of the first GL-ILD radiological suspicion, possibly related with the likelihood of subsequent GL-ILD specific treatment. In literature, we found no similar approaches regarding this specific topic, as the available studies focus mainly on longitudinal evaluation of pulmonary function tests prior to GL-ILD treatment, in order to define progressive disease. A recent study [37] also reported the performance of a CT scoring system in predicting progressive vs stable disease, which is, in our knowledge, the only attempt made to identify radiological elements related to GL-ILD worsening. At present, even though no guidelines provide specific indication for the beginning of GL-ILD immunosuppressive treatment, it is accepted that immunosuppression is required in patients with deteriorating pulmonary function, and/or with relevant symptoms and/or with worsening radiological abnormalities [38]. We thus considered our CT findings, clinical and immunological parameters, finally identifying a small number of immunological and radiological variables functional to obtain a better model performance to possibly foresee the need for a specific GL-ILD therapy, even before evidence of radiological progression or decline of lung function parameters. As radiological parameters, we selected the presence of parenchymal consolidations that was superior to any baseline lung function parameter in increasing the model performance for GL-ILD treatment prediction, and mediastinal lymph nodes enlargement. These two findings may provide not only evidence of active GL-ILD, but are also useful and easy-to-detect elements for evaluating treatment response [38]. In terms of immunological variables, we included, in our model, serum IgA levels at CVID diagnosis and circulating MZ B cells at the time of the CT scan. MZ B cells are functionally considered a first line defense, especially against encapsulated bacteria, and a housekeeping B cellular subset, because of self-antigen and foreign-antigen clearance activity (through their poly-reactive B cell receptors) and secretion of natural IgM antibodies. Given the intrinsic auto reactivity and high sensitivity to stimulation through Toll-like receptors, MZ B cells compartment is tightly regulated, and currently available evidence suggests that it may be implicated in human autoimmunity [39]. Furthermore, extra splenic MZ B cells can localize in tertiary lymphoid structures, including ectopic germinal centers that are often formed in target tissues of autoimmune processes [40] and, interestingly, have also been described in GL-ILD[35]. In this environment, MZ B cells can favor antigen delivery to ectopic germinal centers [41] and/or directly present antigens to T cells [41]. Such peculiar migration may explain our finding of reduced circulating MZ B cells in patients who subsequently needed GL-ILD treatment. On the contrary, CD21low B cells have been found to be expanded in CVID patients with immune dysregulation (and to correlate with GL-ILD diagnosis), probably because of the strong T cell-derived IFN-gamma environment in blood and secondary lymphoid organs [42]. Accordingly, in our study, radiological signs of active lung inflammation (like GGO) and GL-ILD treatment itself correlated with increased CD4+ T cells percentage and CD21 low B cells expansion, respectively. However, we decided not to include CD21low expansion in the multivariate model for predicting the GL-ILD treatment in order to minimize the number of variables entered and because its elimination resulted in a minimal loss of the explained variance. These results need further confirmation; however, in addition to the already known relevance of CD21low, MZ B cells could in the future gain importance if studied ad hoc to verify their prognostic impact on the need for treatment.\n\nLung function parameters were not found helpful in improving the model performance; this is possibly due to the single measurement at the time of CT scan, with no possibility to evaluate decline, and/or to the potentially earlier evaluation compared to other studies.\n\nOur study presents some limitations. Firstly, being a retrospective study, laboratory and pulmonary function tests, as well as CT parameters, were performed in different centers without a previous definition of shared protocols/settings. Then, most of the CT alterations were not assessed with a quantitative or semiquantitative score that may be useful to better define, for instance, the prevalence of alterations between upper and lower fields. Moreover, to confirm the usefulness of the provided elements for a differential diagnosis, a comparison with patients with the other aforementioned diseases is needed. Finally, because this study was not designed to specifically investigate the impact of the different B cell subpopulations on the physiopathology of GL-ILD, further studies are needed to specifically address these findings."
