A dedicated multidisciplinary team operates in accordance with a patient-centred approach and takes charge of the patients holistically, through providing them with accurate pre-operative assessment, medical and surgical treatment, post-operative care and follow-up. In light of the incidence of BA in Western countries (1 in 15,000-20,000 live births) and the birth rate in Italy (approximately 450,000 birth per year), we ensure the management of about 25-30% of all expected cases of BA in our Country. This qualifies our Department as a key referral centre for the treatment of these patients at national level; as a matter of fact, more than 75% of our patients are referred from other Italian Regions. In our centre, consistency in diagnostic assessment, in surgical approach and follow-up protocol throughout a 45-year period, has enabled the examination of what is currently the largest cohort of BA patients in Italy. The Pediatric Surgery Department is involved in single-center and collaborative national and international studies of translational research and clinical trials about rare liver diseases, resulting in publications on distinguished peer-reviewed medical journals. The main areas of expertise in rare liver disorders include biliary atresia, congenital choledochal maformations, non-cirrhotic portal vein thrombosis/extrahepatic portal vein obstruction and congenital porto-systemic shunt (CPSS).</p>",
