        "text": "PRODUCT NEWS\n\nPROPER ALIGNMENT OF THE DENTAL X-RAY MACHINE BY LUNALITE DENTAL X-RAY POSITIONER\n\nThe positioning of the dental X-ray machine and the correct placement of the X-ray sensor is an essential part to obtain quality images for the diagnosis of the teeth and the surrounding anatomical support structures of patients.\n\nThe correct alignment of the X-ray machine is important for several reasons:\n\n– patient safety during radiography\n\n– reducing the risk of relapses and a lower exposure to radiation\n\n– creating an overall safer environment for staff safety\n\n– better planning of dental treatment\n\n– monitoring the progress of various dental treatments, such as orthodontic treatments, caries, bone loss, implant placement and root canals\n\n– providing quality images necessary for diagnosis.\n\nTo ensure proper alignment of the dental x-ray machine, Suzanne Cano invented an advanced MedTech safer positioning device for dental and veterinary imaging called the LunaLite. It is stated that wirelessly positioning with this device ensures an optimized X-ray workflow, adds confidence, accuracy and efficiency in seconds to the user. The device provides accuracy, with minimal to zero taper and taper cuts, and without the user having to use a Rinn holder.\n\n|read PDF|\n\nEDITORIALS\n\nReport from the European Regional Organization of the FDI (ERO-FDI)\n\nSimona Dianišková\n\nERO President\n\nI feel very priviledged to share with you my impressions from the wonderful ERO Plenary session that was held in Istanbul in April, 28-29th, 2023. Currently, ERO represents dentists from 34 countries and has 42 Dental associations as members. The 2023 Spring meeting was attended by 49 delegates. A special welcome was extended to the guests professor Ihsane Ben Yahya President of the FDI, FDI-CEO Enzo Bondioni and some of his staff members, former FDI and ERO-President Gerhard Seeberger, former FDI-President, Michèle Aerden, former ERO-Presidents Anna Lella and Michael Frank. The delegates appreciated the presence of Freddie Sloth-Lijsberg, Council of European Dentists (CED) President, who addressed a few words to the assembly. Both organisations share the same goals, as he mentioned in his short speech, to improve and maintain oral health in Europe.\n\nA very interesting presentation was the one by the President of the Turkish Dental Association Ahmet Tarık Işmen who expressed his pleasure as host of this meeting in is country, which celebrates the 100th anniversary of its foundation in 2023.
