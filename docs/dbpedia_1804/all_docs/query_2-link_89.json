        "text": "In the 1850s, factories increasingly spread across the world just as they did in the Ottoman State, especially in Istanbul. However, by the end of the 20th century most of these factories were empty and dilapidated. Due to the city’s growth, the factories that had once been built on large premises at the peripheries have now become dysfunctional industrial heritage sites in the city center. It is important to reintegrate these sites to society. While the city’s rapid growth and lack of resources render the re-functioning of existing buildings meaningful and necessary, it is also crucial to preserve the left traces that document the factory’s production and development processes. This paper studies the historic development and re-functioning process of the Bomonti Beer Factory based on visual and written sources and on-site observations, while discussing the re-functioning of industrial heritage sites as educational, social and cultural spaces with contributions to the city’s sustainability and preservation.\n\nThe Iberian Peninsula has an important set of castles because of its historical vicissitudes, an important set of castles. They are a few fortifications of public property belonging to the city councils of those municipalities where they are placed. One of the most privileged Spanish administrative divisions, in this respect, is the Province of Alicante, in the south-east of the Iberian Peninsula, which has 46 fortifications of municipal property. Actually, they present different degrees of management with a bad, regular and good condition of preservation. Taking as a starting point the Castalla Castle Heritage Site, between whose cultural and natural assets is Castalla Castle, its management is announced on the part of the City Council. This is the reason to study different crucial aspects in order to understand their management within the councils of the Province of Alicante, such as the historical context and the Spanish and Valencian legal context.\n\nBuildings tell the truth: Fener-Balat as a case of vernacular in the midst of Istanbul House is a reflection of culture, values, knowledge of building techniques, human interactions, feeling of security, etc. A group of houses discovered in Balat, built by an ethnicity reflect insecurity. This is read from the outlook of specific precautions taken in the addition of gaze windows. Is it a fear for antagonistic behavior or are they hiding something inside which only a permitted minority can observe\n\nAs all cultural artifacts, architecture is the result of the dialectical interrelations between temporal codes and social experience. Cultural accumulation, social relations and individual identity concretize and materialize in buildings, and at this point architecture starts talking; expresses itself in formal tectonic and spatial organization with abstract-concrete, hidden-clear signs, reveals its origins and causalities. In order to hear the buildings and understand their language, authors, bear the traces through the civil architecture in Fener and Balat districts in Istanbul ranked in UNESCO World Heritage List by a dual reading on architecture and social life. These districts are not onlytwo adjacent historical neighborhoods; they particularly accommodateunique samples of vernacular architecture, which are the schemes of a very genius interpretation of an architect with participation of the local ethnic groups. The distinctive features of the vernacular have been uncoveredafter random observations on various buildings in the research area and the specific gaze-windowsare identified as character-defining elements. As entrance alcoves also represent an affective domain, these windows are considered as a measure that is the result of the security concerns and needs of the ethnic groups living in these districts due to social unrest and their minority positions in society. Gaze-windows illustrate the socio-psychological subtext of the vulnerability of the ethnic groupsand whole Ottoman society as they were built to see the person at the door before welcoming and serve as the measure for potential intruders. In this context, main focus of this paper is the gaze-windows while bearing the trace of social life and relations in the exclusive heritage in Istanbul. The paper is designed through a case study on the purpose of determining the repeating language of mentioned residential identity and revealing the social inferences of their architectural essence.\n\nHalf of the entries from Turkey in the UNESCO World Heritage List (WHL) are archaeological sites: Hattusha, Nemrut, Xanthos-Letoon, Hierapolis-Pamukkale, and Troy. Since mid-19th century, archaeological research in all but one has been conducted by foreign missions with substantial foreign budgets. After a century dominated by strong figures like Fellows at Xanthos or Schliemann at Troy, in a period of national identity formation, multi-disciplinary and multi-national teams have taken over. A parallel shift of interest from cultural to contemporary socio-economic values of archaeological remains has resulted in a change in the motivation of intervention in site scale, from an interest first in the material then in a knowledge of the sites, up to the local policy of preserving through use and the following con-cern for integrity due to excessive and improper use. In following this trajectory, this paper will aim to test a chronology earlier outlined by the author for the Ancient Theatre of Ephesos.\n\nEdgar Wood, notable Middleton architect, emphasised the importance of balanc- ing a reverence for the past with a desire to create something original in the present – what he described as the true meaning of ‘tradition’. In applying Wood’s conception of tradition to the broader notion of heritage, it becomes a ‘tradition-based creation’ in a state of constant recreation – traits commonly associated with intangible cultural heritage. Using Wood’s grade II* Long Street Methodist Church and Sunday Schools, this paper is concerned with exploring the contem- porary practices and activities that Edgar Wood and Long Street are central to. It explores how the restoration approach chosen for the building relates to the dynamic conception of tradition that Wood supported, facilitating the synthesis of tangible and intangible heritage. An idealised version of both the building and its associated collective memory are restored, in order to transmit Wood’s past progressiveness and present legacy into the future."
