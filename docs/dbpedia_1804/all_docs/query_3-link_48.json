        "meta_description": "Somatostatin analogues inhibit in vitro cell proliferation via specific membrane receptors (SSTRs). Recent studies on transfected cell lines have shown a ligand-induced formation of receptor dimers. The aim of this study is 1) to evaluate the role of specific ligands in modulating receptor interactions in the androgen-dependent prostate cancer cell line, LNCaP, and in the non-small cell lung cancer line, Calu-6, by co-immunoprecipitation and immunoblot; and 2) to correlate the antiproliferative effect of these compounds with their ability in modulating receptor interactions. In LNCaP, we have demonstrated the constitutive presence of sstr1/sstr2, sstr2/sstr5, sstr5/dopamine (DA) type 2 receptor (D2R), and sstr2/D2R dimers. BIM-23704 (sstr1- and sstr2-preferential compound) increased the co-immunoprecipitation of sstr1/sstr2 and significantly inhibited proliferation (−30.98%). BIM-23244 (sstr2–sstr5 selective agonist) significantly increased the co-immunoprecipitation of sstr2/sstr5, and induced a −41.36% inhibition of proliferation. BIM-23A760, a new somatostatin/DA chimeric agonist with a high affinity for sstr2 and D2R and a moderate affinity for sstr5, significantly increased the sstr5/D2R and sstr2/D2R complexes and was the most powerful in inhibiting proliferation (−42.30%). The chimeric compound was also the most efficient in modulating receptor interaction in Calu-6, increasing the co-immunoprecipitation of D2R/sstr5 and inhibiting cell proliferation (−30.54%). However, behind BIM-23A760, BIM-53097 (D2R-preferential compound) also significantly inhibited Calu-6 proliferation (−17.71%), suggesting a key role for D2R in receptor cross talk and in controlling cell growth. Indeed, activation of monomeric receptors did not affect receptor co-immunoprecipitation, whereas cell proliferation was significantly inhibited when the receptors were synergistically activated. In conclusion, our data show a dynamic ligand-induced somatostatin and DA receptor interaction, which may be crucial for the antiproliferative effects of the new analogues.",

        "text": "Introduction\n\nSomatostatin (or somatotropin release-inhibiting factor, SRIF) acts through five specific G-protein-coupled membrane receptors (SSTRs), code named sstr1–5, expressed in SRIF-target cells (Patel 1999, Møller et al. 2003). SRIF mainly exerts an inhibitory effect on cell functions, such as secretion and proliferation (Lamberts et al. 2002). The inhibitory activity of SRIF is replicated by the SRIF analogues octreotide and lanreotide, already used in the clinical practice to control hormonal hypersecretion by the pathological tissues highly expressing sstr2, such as GH-producing pituitary adenomas or certain neuroendocrine tumors (Weckbecker et al. 2003). The stimulation of SSTRs by SRIF analogues may also produce an antiproliferative effect in vitro, due to either cell cycle arrest or induction of apoptosis (Danila et al. 2001, Ferone et al. 2002, Ferrante et al. 2006, Florio 2008).\n\nIn the past years, the knowledge about SSTRs physiopathology has been extended by the discovery that SSTRs can interact on cell membrane forming receptor dimers (Rocheville et al. 2000a). A series of studies, carried out on transfected cell lines, have shown that dimers can consist of two identical SSTR subtypes (homodimers) or two different subtypes (heterodimers), with a range of possible combinations depending on the specific subtype and, probably, on the specific SSTR-expressing cell population. SSTR dimerization can be a ligand-dependent phenomenon, since natural SRIF and subtype-specific SRIF agonists have different effects on dimerization, leading to formation or, on the contrary, dissociation of SSTR dimers (Rocheville et al. 2000a, Pfeiffer et al. 2001, Patel et al. 2002, Grant et al. 2004a,b, 2008). SSTR homo- and heterodimerization also involve cellular events beyond the membrane, since it modifies SSTR internalization and trafficking (Baragli et al. 2007), as well as signal transduction (Kidd et al. 2008). SSTRs can also heterodimerize with other G-protein-coupled receptors, such as the μ-opioid receptor (Pfeiffer et al. 2002) and dopamine (DA) type 2 receptor (D2R; Rocheville et al. 2000b, Baragli et al. 2007).\n\nThe heterodimerization of these G-protein-coupled receptors and the related cellular events open a new possible scenario in the field of treatments targeting SSTR-expressing tumors (Papotti et al. 2002). In fact, new SRIF analogues, which bind more than one SSTR subtype (Weckbecker et al. 2003) and chimeric compounds binding SSTRs and D2R, have been developed and are now available for phase 2 studies (Ferone et al. 2007). Indeed, SSTRs and D2R are frequently co-expressed in those diseases for which therapies with SRIF analogues have already been approved (O'Toole et al. 2006, Ferone et al. 2008, Srirajaskanthan et al. 2009). However, only few studies have been performed to evaluate the final consequences of G-protein-coupled receptors dimerization on cell functions so far (Ferone et al. 2005, Grant et al. 2008), and the clinical relevance of SSTR and D2R heterodimerization must be proved.\n\nIn this study, we analyzed the effects of different SRIF analogues and of one SRIF/DA chimeric compound on SSTRs and D2R interaction on cell membrane and cell proliferation in a cell line constitutively expressing four out of five SSTRs, the androgen-dependent prostate cancer cell line LNCaP (Ruscica et al. 2010), and in a cell line constitutively expressing three out of four SSTRs and the D2R, the non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) line Calu-6 (Ferone et al. 2005).\n\nDiscussion\n\nSeveral studies focusing on the effect of SRIF and DA analogues on the control of cell secretion and proliferation have demonstrated a broad profile of action, both in vivo and in vitro, in different tissues besides the neuroendocrine ones (Lamberts et al. 2002, Schally & Nagy 2003). There are also increasing evidences that SRIF and DA receptors can interact on cell membrane forming homo- or heterodimers with an enhanced functional activity (Ferone et al. 2009). Moreover, almost all studies carried out on cell lines showed receptor dimerization in transfected models highly expressing at least two receptor subtypes (Rocheville et al. 2000a, Pfeiffer et al. 2001, Ren et al. 2003). In this study, we have used two tumor cell lines constitutively expressing four (LNCaP) and three (Calu-6) out of the five SRIF receptors (Ferone et al. 2005, Ruscica et al. 2010) and the D2R. These non-neuroendocrine cell lines, because of their constitutive and relatively low receptor expression, represent a useful model to investigate the physiological mechanisms involved in protein membrane interaction, such as receptor dimerization. Since recently new SRIF analogues with a specific affinity for given receptor subtypes, and SRIF/DA chimeric compounds have been developed (Ferone et al. 2005, Saveanu & Jaquet 2009), in this study we have investigated the effect of these compounds on receptor interaction, and correlated the occurrence of co-immunoprecipitated receptors with the impact on cell proliferation. Since we already demonstrated a dose–response effect of these compounds in the inhibition of cell proliferation (Ferone et al. 2005), in this study, we have performed all experiments using the concentration of compounds that demonstrated about a 50% inhibitory effect (10−9 M).\n\nAccording to the baseline expression of SSTR subtypes in the two cell lines (Ferone et al. 2005, Ruscica et al. 2010) and to the ineffectiveness of a 24 h treatment on receptor expression, we tested specific SRIF analogues in order to study the different combinations of (potential) receptor interaction. Indeed, in LNCaP cell line, we tested the bi-specific SRIF compounds targeting sstr1, sstr2, and sstr5, and in Calu-6 cell line, the bi-specific SRIF compounds targeting sstr2 and sstr5.\n\nSince we have demonstrated the expression of D2R in both the cell lines, we also tested the sstr2/sstr5/D2R chimeric compound and the D2R analogue in order to evaluate the involvement of D2R in membrane receptor interaction.\n\nThe results of western blot and co-immunoprecipitation experiments clearly demonstrated that all SSTRs investigated were able to co-immunoprecipitate with other SSTRs and/or with D2R. Moreover, the results of this study confirmed the ability of SSTRs and D2R to interact on plasma membrane, even in the absence of ligands. On the basis of a strong specificity of the receptors subtype antibodies we used, we considered the co-immunoprecipitated receptor as an expression of the presence of constitutive heterodimer. Moreover, besides observing receptor co-immunoprecipitation in basal conditions, we found that treatment with SRIF analogues and with an SRIF/DA chimeric compound can differently modulate the amount of the potential dimers on plasma membranes.\n\nAs far as LNCaP cell line is concerned, all compounds targeting sstr2 showed the ability to increase the interaction between almost all the receptors studied, in particular the interaction between SSTR and D2R. As a matter of fact, we observed that lanreotide was able to increase the amount of sstr5 co-immunoprecipitated with D2R, as well as BIM-23704, despite its prevalent affinity for sstr1/sstr2/sstr3. As expected, the chimeric compound BIM-23A760 drastically increased the amount of SSTR co-immunoprecipitated with D2R, resulting in one of the most effective antiproliferative agents among all tested molecules. This last finding suggests a crucial role of D2R in the mechanism involved in the control of tumor growth in these cells, as confirmed by the significant antiproliferative effect and by the increase in the amount of sstr2 co-immunoprecipitated with D2R exerted by the monospecific D2R compound, BIM-53097. Since the sstr2 monospecific compound failed to display a significant antiproliferative effect, and sstr1 and sstr3, but not sstr2, are the receptor subtypes mostly involved in the pathophysiology of prostate cancer, we deduced that sstr2 might mainly function as a ‘scaffold’ for other receptors in the formation of heterodimers.\n\nAs far as Calu-6 cell line is concerned, we observed that sstr2 and sstr5 receptors exert a role in the inhibition of cell growth only when activated synergistically. This finding is supported by the effect of the sstr2/sstr5 bi-specific compound, BIM-23244, either in the inhibition of cell growth or in the increase in sstr2 co-immunoprecipitated with sstr5. Moreover, Calu-6 cell line displayed a greater sensibility to the chimeric compounds compared with that observed in LNCaP cells, showing an increase in the amount of sstr5 co-immunoprecipitated with D2R. Moreover, even though the chimeric compound BIM-23A760 was basically ineffective in modulating sstr2/D2R co-immunoprecipitation, it displayed a significant antiproliferative effect. However, considering the affinity of BIM-23A760 for sstr5 as well, this apparent discrepancy can be explained by the predominant involvement of this latter receptor subtype and of D2R, instead of sstr2, in this cell line. Indeed, the inhibition of cell proliferation exerted by the sstr2-preferential compound, BIM-23120, was negligible. This finding is in agreement with the increase in sstr5 co-immunoprecipitated with D2R induced by BIM-53097 (D2R-preferential compound), supporting again the important role of D2R in the induction of SSTR/D2R interaction, probably correlated to the inhibition of cell proliferation as well.\n\nThese data highlight the concept of SSTRs as receptors with different functions depending on the different cells in which they are expressed, and not only from the different receptor subtype (Ferone et al. 2001, Zatelli et al. 2001, 2005).\n\nIn this study, we have found that the amount of SSTRs co-immunoprecipitated with D2R correspond to an enhanced antiproliferative activity. Nevertheless, it remains to be established whether only one receptor of the dimer accounts for the antiproliferative activity, or both receptors (dimer) modulate cell proliferation. Furthermore, we have found that the influence of different dimers on cell proliferation varies in the two different cell types. Dimers with a direct correlation with the antiproliferative effect probably act on the complex cellular system dedicated to the control of cell cycle and apoptosis (Kidd et al. 2008). The evidence that the compounds able to induce receptor dimerization show a strong antiproliferative effect may be partially explained by the cross talk either on the cell membranes, or even at the postmembrane level, of these G-protein-coupled receptor families (Ferone et al. 2009). Indeed, some authors have demonstrated a reduction in receptor internalization rate, due to the ability of one receptor, implicated in the heterodimer, to retain the second receptor on the cell membrane. In this latter phenomenon, an interference with the β-arrestin system is probably involved (Grant et al. 2008). Another possible explanation of the enhanced antiproliferative action of heterodimers (especially SSR/DR dimers) may be the increased D2R activity observed in the cell lines transfected with sstr2 and D2R after the treatment with SRIF (Baragli et al. 2007). Studies focused on signal transmission at the postmembrane level showed that SRIF/DA receptor activation (largely sstr2/D2R) may result in the phosphorylation of c-Jun N-terminal kinase(B) and inhibition of transcription of the cyclin Ki-67, resulting in growth arrest (Kidd et al. 2008).\n\nOn the other hand, the presence of enhanced dimers without a direct correlation with cell proliferation sheds light into the complexity of the ‘dimer system’ that shows a peculiar behavior (far from being completely understood) both at the membrane and postmembrane levels.\n\nIn conclusion, the results of this study confirm that the activity of SSTRs and DA receptors could be driven by the specific cell types in which they are expressed, and demonstrate that the dimers behave similarly. Therefore, not only the receptor profiles but also the cell types, as well as the dimerization, are responsible for the final effect of a given ligand. Moreover, in the two cell systems evaluated in this study the only dimer positively correlated with an enhanced antiproliferative effect is the sstr5/D2R one. This finding opens new perspectives for the use of the new chimeric compounds, already used in phase 2 studies in neuroendocrine tumors. However, further studies are warranted to characterize the postreceptor mechanisms involved in the enhanced potency following receptor dimer activation."
