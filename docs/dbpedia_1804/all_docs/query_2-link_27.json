Several gadolinium-based MR imaging contrast agents were subsequently introduced into the clinical arena, but each was very similar to previously FDA-approved gadolinium-based MR imaging contrast agents (GBMCAs) in the mechanism of action, biodistribution, and biologic half-lives. They even shared similar safety profiles until the more recently discovered associations with the subsequent development of nephrogenic systemic fibrosis in patients with renal failure.2–5 Gadobenate dimeglumine, approved by the FDA in November 2004, represents the first FDA-approved GBMCA with noticeably higher R1 and R2 relaxivities and slightly different biodistribution and excretion pathways from those seen in the 4 older FDA-approved GBMCAs.6–8\n\nBecause of weak and transient protein binding, this agent has been reported to possess enhanced (R1 and R2) relaxivities and, therefore, faster transverse and longitudinal relaxation and recovery rates compared with the other FDA-approved GBMCAs.7–10 In clinical trials, it has been found to confer greater conspicuity and detectability to lesions within the central nervous system and associated cerebral vasculature, among other reported benefits.11–16 However, even in the intraindividual crossover studies, biodistribution of contrast within each patient, therefore the local concentration of contrast, cannot be determined or controlled. This was of particular interest, given the slightly different biodistribution reported for gadobenate relative to the other agents, with 3%–5% of the administered gadobenate dose undergoing biliary clearance.6,17–19 An in vitro study would potentiate more precise measurements of contrast concentration and correlation with corresponding signal intensities on any given MR imaging sequence. Such a study would allow more precise and quantifiable detection of differences between GBMCAs and optimization of imaging sequences to maximize the clinical benefits of each agent.\n\nTo this end, we designed an in vitro serial dilution study of each of the 5 FDA-approved GBMCAs currently available for clinical practice in the United States. These solutions would be simultaneously imaged with numerous MR imaging pulse sequences and imaging parameters to assess their relative signal intensities. These imaging studies would be repeated on both 1.5T and 3T MR imaging systems to evaluate the relative behavior of these agents at field strengths commonly used in clinical practice. It was hypothesized that these experiments would confirm published claims of relative relaxivities for these various agents and would demonstrate similar signal-intensity measurements at a given concentration, field strength, and pulse sequence for the older 4 GBMCAs and different values for gadobenate that would reflect its published higher R1 an R2 relaxivity values.\n\nResults\n\nAt TR values that were short relative to the anticipated T1 values of the materials tested, all contrast agents demonstrated the lowest intensities at the highest concentrations/lowest dilution factors studied. For all agents, signal intensities increased, peaked, and subsequently diminished as dilution factors ranged from high to low (Fig 2). The dilution factor at which signal intensity peaked varied across each GBMCA, TR, and TE studied. For example, at TR = 100 and TE = 14, peak signal intensity for gadodiamide was seen at a dilution factor of 1:128, whereas it peaked at 1:256 for gadobenate.\n\nWith parameters typical for clinical contrast-enhanced T1WI, Figure 2 shows that the highest signal intensities measured were for gadobenate, followed by gadopentetate and gadoteridol, followed by gadoversetamide and gadodiamide. Figure 3 demonstrates that at similar dilution factors, increasing TR yielded higher signal intensities for all 5 agents until it reached or exceeded 1000 ms. Although the relative order of signal intensities among the agents studies was maintained, the percentage increase in signal intensity (relative to the lowest measured value) decreased as the TR was lengthened.\n\nWith low dilution factors typical for PWI, Figure 2 demonstrates that the lowest signal intensities and greatest T2(*) shortening effects were observed for gadobenate, followed by gadopentetate and gadoteridol, followed once again by gadoversetamide and gadodiamide. For PWI applications, plotting signal intensity versus TE for a given TR (Fig 4) demonstrated that the rate of signal-intensity decrease with increasing TE values was greatest for gadobenate. As T2-weighting was increased with longer TEs, signal-intensity loss was greatest for gadobenate. This was demonstrated by the use of 95% confidence intervals (Table 2), in which no significant differences existed between the measurements at TE = 20 and no overlap existed between the confidence intervals of gadobenate and the other agents at TE = 100. Most interesting, significant differences were also observed between gadoteridol and gadopentetate versus gadodiamide and gadoversetamide (Table 3).\n\nBy comparing signal intensities for a physiologic concentration with scanning parameters representative of contrast-enhanced T1WI at field strengths of 1.5T and 3T, Figure 5 demonstrates (as expected) higher signal intensities for all agents at 3T than at 1.5T. The relative benefit of gadobenate compared with the other agents was maintained at 3T as it had been seen at 1.5T. The signal-intensity benefit at 3T for gadobenate compared with the other agents was statistically similar to that seen at 1.5T for this agent compared with the other agents."
