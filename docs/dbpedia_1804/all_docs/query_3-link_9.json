The term “tumour heterogeneity” encompasses a broad range of tumour features that have arisen as a result of different mechanistic processes including stem-cell origin, tumour evolution (linked to genetic mutations and adverse tumour microenvironment) and clonal resistance (as a consequence of treatment). Tumour heterogeneity may be intra-tumoural (i.e. within the same tumour), inter-tumoural (i.e. between lesions in the same patient) and inter-individual (i.e. between patients).\n\nThe understanding of tumour heterogeneity is important because it is a barrier to curing cancers; and improved understanding can lead to better individualised treatments. Tumour heterogeneity is linked to treatment resistance and the emergence of aggressive tumour phenotypes. There is thus a need for biomarkers to identify relevant tumour sub-clones to which specific therapies may be directed.\n\nCurrent approaches to enhance our understanding of tumour heterogeneity include genomics analysis using either multi-tumoural region and/or longitudinal tumor tissue sampling. However, non-invasive imaging using CT, MRI and PET imaging can provide an overview of the imaging characteristics of multiple disease sites across the body, thereby provide critical information about intra- and inter-tumour heterogeneity.\n\nUsing functional and molecular imaging techniques, imaging can be used to quantitatively measure different aspects of tumour biology; thus identifying imaging phenotypes linked to different stem-cell origins, gene expression, tumour evolution, treatment efficacy (including differential treatment response) and the emergence of clonal resistance. The emerging evidence for the use of imaging to explore and understand tumour heterogeneity will be presented and discussed.\n\nO2 Skeletal sequelae in adult survivors of childhood cancer\n\nSue Creviston Kaste1,2,3 (sue.kaste@stjude.org)\n\n1Department of Diagnostic Imaging, St. Jude Children’s Research Hospital, 262 Danny Thomas Place, MSN #220, Memphis, TN 38105, USA; 2Department of Oncology, St. Jude Children’s Research Hospital, 262 Danny Thomas Place, Memphis, TN 38105, USA; 3Department of Radiology, University of Tennessee Health Science Center, 920 Madison Ave, Memphis, TN 38103, USA\n\nImproved diagnostic methods, treatment and understanding of the biology of childhood tumors over the past several decades have led to improved patient survival. In 2009, the U.S. population of childhood cancer survivors was estimated at one in 570 young adults aged 20 to 34 years [1]. This rapidly growing population underscores the importance of studying long-term complications of cancer therapy. While childhood cancer patients are returning to the mainstream of life, toxicities from prior therapy may compound or potentiate changes typically seen with the normal aging process. Physical consequences of disease and therapy (e.g., surgery, chemotherapy and radiation therapy) such as scoliosis, craniofacial dysplasia, and limb-length discrepancy, may present functional limitations, psychosocial challenges, and require extensive surgical interventions.\n\nHowever, skeletal toxicities [2] such as osteonecrosis [3-5] and deficits in bone mineral density [6, 7] are typically silent until they reach advanced stages when attempts at amelioration may be unsuccessful. These two sequelae result from multifactorial interactions including genetic predisposition, disease, therapy (chemotherapy and radiation therapy) and physical activity. As both bone mineral density deficits and osteonecrosis may occur in a single patient, therapeutic interventions may be complex and standard treatment practices for one of these sequel may exacerbate the other toxicity.\n\nOsteonecrosis is an important long-term toxicity that can compromise joint functionality and, thus, quality of life in survivors of childhood cancer in whom it develops. Its development is multi-factorial but understanding of this process in pediatric oncology is complex and incomplete. Osteonecrosis affects up to one-third of pediatric leukemia patients and is typically asymptomatic in its early stage when most susceptible to treatment [3]. Despite this fact, it is only when pain occurs that osteonecrosis is typically suspected. MR imaging is the diagnostic modality of choice for screening, follow-up and risk prediction of functional deterioration in early stages and readily demonstrates osteonecrotic parameters such as size of the lesion, involvement of articular surface, presence of a crescent sign, etc. Clinical symptoms and demographics are predictive of disease progression in pediatric steroid-induced hip osteonecrosis [3].\n\nThis presentation will concentrate on what is known, factors as yet unknown, and potential implications of such toxicity. It will focus on bone mineral density deficits which may predispose childhood cancer survivors to earlier onset and more severe osteopenia and osteoporosis than the normal population. Also detailed, will be osteonecrosis which predisposes survivors to impairment of joint function. Therapeutic interventions for osteonecrosis are currently limited and ultimately, may lead to joint resurfacing or replacement at a young age.\n\nAcknowledgements\n\nSupported in part by grant P30 CA-21765 from the National Institutes of Health, a Center of Excellence grant from the State of Tennessee, the Le Bonheur Foundation (Memphis TN), and the American Lebanese Syrian Associated Charities (ALSAC).\n\nReferences\n\n1.

However, the majority of breast cancers are still treated with a combination of surgery and radiotherapy, generally with some form of axillary procedure. Thus, the commonest locoregional effects of breast cancer treatment are secondary to surgery and to a lesser extent, radiotherapy.\n\nSurgical effects can be acute or chronic. Acute effects include post-operative seromas, haematomas, and infection. Postoperative seromas are extremely common and can persist for years [2]. Occasionally they may be very uncomfortable, especially in the axilla, necessitating ultrasound-guided aspiration, often repeated. Rare consequences of autologous reconstructions secondary to inadequate tissue perfusion include wound breakdown and necrosis, but in the chronic phase, the commonest complication of surgery by far is fat necrosis, which can present with a symptomatic lump. Though the imaging appearances of mature fat necrosis are characteristic, it can cause diagnostic confusion initially, with solid-appearing masses on mammography, ultrasound and MRI, and indeterminate or suspicious mammographic microcalcification [3]. Together with the less common epidermal inclusion cysts, the major issue with these benign complications is the resultant patient anxiety, since the main differential diagnosis is obviously local recurrence [4]. However, post-surgical complications tend to occur earlier than recurrent disease and the imaging differentiation is usually straightforward.\n\nThe short-term effects of whole breast radiotherapy are predictable, with radiation-induced oedema, skin and trabecular thickening, which is readily apparent at mammography and ultrasound. Such changes peak around 18 months post radiotherapy and then generally diminish. However, patients may be symptomatic with tenderness and focal thickening for years after radiotherapy. The longer-term effects are less predictable, particularly the development of radiation induced angiosarcoma [5]. The latency for this condition ranges from 3 to 20 years but with breast cancer increasingly becoming a chronic disease, it is likely that it will be seen more often. The other devastating effect of radiation to the axilla and supraclavicular fossa is radiation induced brachial plexopathy [6]. This highly debilitating iatrogenic complication is mercifully much less common with modern conformal radiotherapy techniques and careful observance of fields and dosages. Nonetheless the differentiation between radiation induced and malignant plexopathy can be challenging and may necessitate MRI and PET scanning [7, 8].\n\nRecognition of the long-term sequelae of conventional treatment of breast cancer has resulted in a move towards more breast conservation, (with oncoplastic surgical techniques if necessary), less axillary intervention (with less resultant lymphoedema) and accelerated partial breast irradiation techniques. These all result in specific imaging findings on surveillance mammography which the breast radiologist needs to be aware of, for example more frequent fat necrosis at the site of the surgical excision after intra-operative radiotherapy [9]. Finally, it is important for the general cross-sectional radiologist to be aware of the spectrum of normal imaging findings at CT after complex reconstructive surgery and to recognise when a finding needs further evaluation [10].\n\nReferences\n\n1.

Advanced imaging modalities such as, Diffusion Weighted Imaging, Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy and Perfusion Weighted Imaging, as well as Positron Emission Tomography with amino-acid tracers, may substantially improve the ability to orient a proper diagnosis and to guide patient management. When MRI is unavailable or contraindicated, Computerized Tomography (CT) remains an alternative diagnostic tool, even though its role in acute settings is mainly limited to rule out haemorrhage.\n\nEvaluation and depiction of the most common neuroimaging patterns of brain injury induced by cancer therapy is the focus of the present work.\n\nReferences\n\n1.

Herold\n\nDepartment of Biomedical Imaging and Image Guided Therapy, Medical University of Vienna/Vienna General Hospital, 1090 Vienna, Austria\n\nThe most compelling evidence supporting the use of low dose computed tomography in the screening of high risk populations for lung cancer was generated by the National Lung Cancer Screening Trial carried out in the United States by the National Cancer Institute and the American College of Radiology Imaging Network. This trial was a randomised prospective study which included over 53,000 participants. Data from the NLST demonstrated that screening reduced mortality by 20 % in the CT arm [1]. Other smaller studies carried out in Europe have reported no mortality benefit. However, these studies included a younger screening population, had a smaller number of participants and probably did not have the power to show a mortality benefit. Major medical societies and US government agencies such as US Preventative Services Task Force and the Center for Medicare Services have now recommended LDCT. These decisions not only recommend screening but require US insurance companies and Medicare in the US to provide reimbursement.\n\nIn the United States, the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) decision to provide reimbursement for lung cancer screening with low dose CT included a number of specific criteria for the establishment of lung cancer screening programs [2]. It requires a written order from a physician for the initial and subsequent screens and a required office visit with the referring physician in which the patient would be counseled concerning lung cancer screening and a shared decision making would be implemented. Also included are criteria for radiologist eligibility including certification by the American Board of Radiology or equivalent and the interpretation of at least 300 chest CTs in the past 3 years and documentation of continuing medical education. Radiology imaging centers must be accredited as well. The American College of Radiology is providing such accreditation. CMS is also requiring collection and submission of data by an approved national registry for each screen performed.\n\nThe American College of Radiology has developed a reporting system for lung cancer screening designated “Lung Rads” [3]. It is very similar to Bi-Rads that includes numeric categories. It associates CT findings with guideline based management decisions. LDCT findings are categorized from 1-4 according to the likelihood of malignancy. 1 and 2 are considered benign findings and 3 and 4 have a higher probability of malignancy. There are descriptions for each of the 4 categories plus an enumeration of findings. The categories include characterization of nodules including size and density (solid, part-solid, or non- solid ground glass). In addition to the categories and findings there are guidelines for management in each category with estimates of the probability of malignancy and the estimated population prevalence.\n\nSome of the caveats of screening result from the limits of generalization of the NLST results based on risk groups and demographics. There are also potential harms and complications from the LDCT screening which include radiation exposure, overdiagnosis/overmanagement, the use of invasive procedures for diagnosis and the high false positive rate [4]. Nevertheless, these potential limitations, harms and complications seem to be outweighted by the benefits of screening.\n\nIn the future, we will see a consolidation of the body of evidence and gain new insights through the pooling of the European trial data (Nelson [5]), and the UK Lung Cancer Screening trial pilot study [6].\n\nReferences:\n\n1) Aberle DR, Adams AM, Berg CD, Black WC, Clapp JD, Fagerstrom RM, et al, National Lung Screening Trial Research Team.

McLoud\n\nDepartment of Radiology, Massachusetts General Hospital, Harvard Medical School, 55 Fruit Street, Boston, MA 02114, USA\n\nRisk stratification is important for large and small nodules. Special issues arise with small pulmonary nodules defined as less than 8 mm. The vast majority of these are benign.\n\nThere are both clinical and imaging risk factors for malignancy that should be taken into account. Clinical risk factors include older age, history of smoking, history of extrathoracic cancer within 5 years, and family history of cancer. The CT characteristics that indicate risk from malignancy include a size of greater than 8 mm, certain border characteristics, density features, growth, and location. A presumptive benign diagnosis can be made on the basis of 2 year stability excluding ground glass nodules which require longer follow-up. Benign calcification (diffuse, central, laminated, and popcorn), the presence of fat, a size less than 4 mm and perifissural location are very strong predictors of benignity and no further evaluation of such nodules is required.\n\nAdequate evaluation of solitary pulmonary nodules requires thin section CT with a 1.5 to 2 mm slice thickness.\n\nThe solidity of nodules is important in determining their malignant potential. Among purely solid nodules, a size greater than 8 mm, location in the upper lobes, spiculated or lobulated contour, and internal characteristics such as eccentric calcification, air bronchograms and cavitation are helpful predictors of malignancy in addition to the growth rate. Small nodules less than 4 mm have less than a 0.5 % chance of malignancy even in smokers. Nodules in the range of 8-10 mm or greater have a 10-20 % chance of malignancy. The management of small solid nodules less than 8 mm often consists of imaging follow-up according to current recommendations by the Fleischner Society.\n\nSubsolid nodules represent the spectrum of peripheral adenocarcinomas of the lung and may be mixed part solid/part ground glass or pure ground glass nodules. Part solid nodules have the highest likelihood of malignancy in the range of 60 to 70 %. Malignancy in subsolid nodules is associated both with lesion growth and the development and growth of the solid component.\n\nIn summary, small solitary pulmonary nodules commonly detected on CT are mostly benign. It is imperative that clinical risk factors which are mostly socio-demographic be evaluated. Important imaging findings in determining the risk of malignancy includes size, location, morphology and classic benign features, growth rate, and solidity.\n\nReferences:\n\n1.

It is evident that FDG-PET does not replace the need for pathologic examination, but contributes to decisions about when to obtain tissue and from what location(s). Studies have shown repeatedly that overall patient survival and progression-free survival in NSCLC are predicted by the lesion intensity in FDG-PET at initial characterization [2-4]. Thus, although many non-neoplastic lesions can be FDG-avid, and while many instances of low-grade malignancy may be FDG “negative”, use of serial anatomic imaging in the latter patients may suffice to characterize lesions, without significant risk of upstaging when malignancy is found in a growing lesion. Presence of avid FDG uptake in a new pulmonary lesion identifies cases where tissue diagnosis should be expedited, and may serve simultaneously to stage the malignancy. More recent evidence suggests an added role of FDG-PET in directing needle biopsy of pulmonary lesions, improving diagnostic yield [5].\n\nAn emerging application of FDG-PET in NSCLC is in the assessment of therapeutic response [6], and in the possibility of applying individualised, adaptive therapy. Studies in the use of external beam radiotherapy have identified predictive value of initial FDG activity patterns in NSCLC lesion(s) with the likelihood of post-therapeutic relapse [7]. Other studies have identified that early tumor response to radiotherapy may be predicted well before completion of dose delivery [8], supporting the novel development of protocols based on re-planning and re-targeting of remaining radiation dose midway during treatment. A similar strategy can be envisioned surrounding the use of targeted chemotherapies in advanced stage NSCLC, where FDG-PET monitoring of response at all sites of involvement could distinguish effective versus futile treatments.\n\nReferences\n\n1.

Therapeutics usually used for transarterial tumour therapy are usually small particles, chemotherapeutics and radionuclides. Transarterial tumour therapy is most often performed in primary and secondary liver tumours, and less often in other organs, like kidney, lung, prostate, uterus, etc.\n\nFor primary or secondary hepatic tumours either transarterial (bland) embolisation (TAE), transarterial chemoembolisation (TACE), hepatic arterial infusion (HAI) therapy or transarterial radioembolisation (RE) are the typical transarterial tumour therapies. A recent method that is still experimental is chemosaturation [1].\n\nTransarterial Chemoembolization (TACE) is the standard treatment for intermediate stage (BCLC B) hepatocellular cancers (HCC). TACE utilises the fact that HCCs are perfused to 80 % by the liver artery and only to 20 % by the portal venous system. TACE uses the arterial perfusion of HCCs to introduce ischemia and chemotherapeutics into the tumour to kill tumour cells and to minimise systemic effects for the patient. TACE was developed in the early 1980s in Japan and traditionally was a mixture of lipiodol (ethyl ester of iodized fatty acids of poppy seed oil) and a chemotherapeutic agent (water-in-oil emulsion) [2]. This so called conventional or lipiodol TACE (cTACE) is usually completed by intraarterial application of gelatin sponge and this technique is established as the standard treatment for HCCs without portal vein invasion as a result of 2 randomised studies using doxorubicin [3] or cisplatium [4] as a chemotherapeutic agent. Both studies demonstrated a significant superiority of cTACE compared to best supportive care.\n\nIn the last 15 years 2 new TACE techniques were developed, TACE with drug-eluting microspheres (DEB-TACE) and TACE using degradable starch microspheres (DSM-TACE). In DEB-TACE the chemotherapeutic agent is released slowly from the embolising microparticles reducing the systemic side effects of TACE [5]. This technique showed a reduction of post-procedural abdominal pain, but failed to demonstrate a survival benefit compared to cTACE [6].\n\nTACE is also used to stabilize HCC tumors in patients on the waiting list for liver transplantation, so called “bridge to transplantation”, and as an adjunctive to thermal local ablative techniques (e.g. radio frequency ablation (RFA) or microwave ablation (MWA)). The addition of a TACE before thermal ablation reduces the perfusion induced “cooling” of the ablation zone and significantly increases local tumour control and survival when combined with thermal ablation in HCCs from 3.5 to 7 cm [7].\n\nIn recent years TACE spread to other secondary liver tumour, specially to liver metastasis from gastroenteropancreatic neuroendocrine tumors (GEP-NETs) and from colorectal cancers (CRC) [8, 9]. In GEP-NET either a transarterial bland embolisation (TAE) without chemotherapeutic agent or a cTACE with doxorubicin is performed in specialised centers. For CRC liver metastasis DEB-TACE using irinotecan as loading drug is the established technique for TACE.\n\nReferences\n\n1. Vogl TJ, Zangos S, Scholtz JE, Schmitt F, Paetzold S, Trojan J, et al.

In many centres image-guided biopsy has essentially replaced surgical biopsy for the diagnosis of extracranial solid tumours in children.\n\nAttempts to introduce newer therapeutic techniques into paediatric practice have been hindered by practical, legislative and cultural obstacles [2]. Although a 2014 systematic review found reports of only 28 children treated with ablation techniques for malignant or aggressive benign lesions [3], many more relevant publications have appeared since then. For the present, at least, the most likely application of such techniques is in children with recurrent (or perhaps unresectable) tumors. Other indications may appear as paediatric oncologists become more familiar with the value of these procedures. One such possibility would be the use of radiofrequency ablation or cryoablation as an alternative to partial nephrectomy for treatment of bilateral nephroblastoma (Wilms’ tumour).\n\nTreatment of malignant liver tumours in children with chemoembolization (TACE) was investigated as long ago as the early 1990s, with promising results [4]. Three principal indications for TACE in children have been identified: conversion of unresectable tumours to resectability, as a bridge to transplantation, and as a part of palliation. Despite this, chemoembolization has not so far been incorporated into any major paediatric liver tumour trial.\n\nSome other IR procedures have an occasional role in the palliative care of children with cancer [5]. These include techniques for the management of malignant pleural effusions or ascites, and methods for delivering analgesic drugs or nerve blocks.\n\nReferences\n\n1.

Fütterer\n\nDepartment of Radiology and Nuclear Medicine, Radboud University Medical Center, Nijmegen, 6500HB, The Netherlands\n\nWith the widespread use of prostate-specific antigen screening and increasing life expectancy, more men are being diagnosed with localized, low-risk, low-grade prostate cancer [1]. As a result, men with localised prostate cancer and physicians who advise them face a difficult therapeutic dilemma: surveillance versus radical whole-gland therapy [2]. The available evidence from randomized controlled trials demonstrates that there is little to no difference between these choices in terms of overall and cancer-specific survival after a median of 10 years of follow-up [3]. Consequently, deferred treatment such as active surveillance is an appealing management solution which maximize the quality of life [4]. Conversely, radical treatment options, i.e. definitive radiotherapy or radical prostatectomy, come with considerable side effects such as erectile dysfunction and/or incontinence. Focal therapy is a strategy by which the overtreatment burden of the current prostate cancer pathway could be reduced [2]. This therapy concept has already been successfully applied to kidney [5], liver, breast, and lung cancer.\n\nFocal therapy is an emerging local treatment option, which offers great hopes in term of decreased morbidity associated with standard whole-gland therapy without jeopardising cancer control [6]. The challenge of focal therapy is to treat the tumour, sparing the rest of the prostate, especially near the neurovascular bundles, bladder neck, rectum and the urethral sphincter, to minimize the potential morbidity. Concern regarding focal therapy has centered on the knowledge that prostate cancer is multifocal in origin. In prostate cancer, a larger dominant lesion is often accompanied by two or three smaller low-grade lesions. A hypothesis has emerged that the largest lesion in the prostate — the index lesion — drives disease progression [7]. The index lesion tends to be associated with the highest Gleason grade, harbours other pathological determinants of progression, and has been associated with lymph node metastases on genetic profiling. If the index lesion could be isolated with reasonable precision and treatment directed to it alone, then the oncological efficacy of whole-gland treatment might be matched while minimizing the risk of side effects.\n\nReferences:\n\n1.

Towbin\n\nCincinnati Children’s Hospital, Department of Radiology, 3333 Burnet Avenue, MLC 5031, Cincinnati, OH 45229, USA\n\nOver the past five decades, researchers have begun to unravel many of the molecular pathways that lead to development of cancer. Through this work we have learned that 90 % of cancers occur as a result of an acquired somatic mutation while the remaining 10 % of cancers occur as a result of a hereditary, germline mutation [1]. Patients with a hereditary cancer predisposition syndrome often present younger in life than those patients with a somatic mutation [1].\n\nTo date, there are at least 114 known cancer predisposition syndromes [2]. The purpose of this talk is to describe several of the more common cancer predisposition syndromes including Li-Fraumeni syndrome, DICER 1 syndrome, Beckwith Wiedemann syndrome, tuberous sclerosis, and Down syndrome [3-7]. For each syndrome, the common tumours will be described and the current guidelines for screening will be discussed.\n\nReferences\n\n1. Saletta F, Dalla Pozza L, Byrne JA.

Correct diagnosis of chest or chest wall masses is often challenging. Differentiation between malignant and benign processes including congenital abnormalities is of essential importance. Overall, primary pediatric pulmonary malignancies are uncommon. However, mediastinal masses and chest wall masses are not uncommon and should prompt thorough investigation.\n\nIn this interactive session we will use a case based approach to discuss various common and rare pediatric chest neoplasms as well as non-neoplastic differential diagnoses. In particular we will discuss the value of correlating the most likely primary site or epicenter of the lesion with the imaging characteristics as seen on radiography, ultrasonography, computed tomography, or magnetic resonance imaging as well as the age and gender of the child in narrowing down the differential diagnosis.\n\nO13 Abdominal masses: good or bad?\n\nAnne MJB Smets (a.m.smets@amc.uva.nl)\n\nDepartment of Radiology, Academic Medical Center, University of Amsterdam, Amsterdam, The Netherlands\n\nImaging plays an important role in the diagnosis of an abdominal mass in a child. Imaging studies need to be performed and interpreted in the light of the age of the child, clinical presentation and history, physical examination and laboratory results.\n\nUltrasound is a valuable technique for examining the pediatric abdomen and should always be the first imaging test to be performed. Both CT and MRI are modalities with a high burden for the child. The dose of ionizing radiation that comes with an abdominal CT is considerable. For abdominal MR, young children will need to be sedated or anaesthetized.\n\nAbdominal malignancies in children are rare, with an incidence of 1-9 per million children per year. The most frequent malignant abdominal tumours of childhood are neuroblastoma, originating from the adrenal gland or anywhere from the sympathetic nervous system, nephroblastoma (Wilms’ tumour) from the kidney, hepatoblastoma from the liver [1-3]. Benign lesions of hemorrhagic, inflammatory or infectious origin as well as congenital malformations may mimic a malignancy and a malignant tumour may be mistaken for a benign lesion [4].\n\nIn some cases ultrasound imaging will demonstrate the benign nature of a mass, and exposure of the child to imaging modalities with a high burden will hence be unnecessary. Whenever ultrasound findings are inconclusive or suggestive of a malignancy, complementary cross-sectional imaging studies are necessary. CT or MRI should then be carried out with the highest possible yield of diagnostic information and with the ALARA principle in mind [5].\n\nIn order to avoid pitfalls, it is important to be aware of the complementarity of the different imaging modalities and to include all information in the conclusion of the report.\n\nReferences\n\n1.

HCC is the endpoint of a serial transformation beginning from a dysplastic nodule, often triggered by chronic liver inflammation and cirrhosis. The progression from dysplastic nodule to HCC implies not only morphological changes but also vascular transformations, with process of neoangiogenesis leading to an increased number of unpaired arteries, progressive reduction of hepatocellular function [1].\n\nDynamic T1w during the arterial phase is of outmost importance for the detection of small HCCs [2]. Typically, HCCs demonstrate arterial enhancement and venous washout showing later hypointensity. However, HCCs smaller than 2 cm and well-differentiated HCCs frequently have atypical enhancement patterns [3]. In these situations, the use of liver-specific contrast agents (Gd-BOPTA or Gd-EOB-DTPA) can be helpful. While dynamic imaging of HCC with liver-specific MR contrast agents is similar to what observed with conventional CA, delayed hepatobiliary phase (HBP) imaging reveals a number of different enhancement patterns, with both iso-, hypo- and hyperintense patterns possible.\n\nThe signal intensity of HCCs on the HBP images has been recently considered as a potential imaging biomarker [4]. HBP hyper-intense HCCs have been reported to have histologic features related with favorable outcomes more frequently than HBP hypointense HCCs, showing higher grades of tumor differentiation, a lower rate of microvascular invasion [4], lower levels of expression of several kinds of poorer prognostic immunohistochemical markers [5].\n\nThe hepatobiliary phase images can increase the value of Gd-enhanced MRI in the diagnosis of early stage HCC. The use of liver specific contrast agents increase the sensitivity and accuracy for small HCCs either with Gd-EOB-DTPA [6] and with Gd-BOPTA [7].\n\nReferences\n\n1.
