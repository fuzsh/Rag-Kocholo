        "text": "[Differential chronic hepatitis diagnosis].\n\nPubMed\n\nHinterberger, W\n\n2000-01-01\n\nChronic hepatitis comprises a group of disorders of the liver exhibiting a chronic necroinflammatory process that differs in etiology, clinical course and treatment strategies. A diagnosis of chronic hepatitis is usually made when inflammation and liver cell necrosis persist for longer than 6 months. Clinical manifestations range from asymptomatic patients to those with advanced hepatic failure. Both sexes and all age groups are affected. Chronic hepatitis may emerge as a sequelae of hepatitis C and less often after hepatitis B. Both diseases are treatable and require rapid and exact diagnosis. The differential diagnosis must exclude autoimmune hepatitis, chronic steatohepatitis, congenital metabolic hepatopathies and drug-induced hepatopathies. Laboratory tests, histologic investigations and clinical differential diagnosis must exclude other causes of chronic liver disease.\n\nDifferential Diagnosis of Jakob-Creutzfeldt Disease\n\nPubMed Central\n\nPaterson, Ross W.; Torres-Chae, Charles C.; Kuo, Amy L.; Ando, Tim; Nguyen, Elizabeth A.; Wong, Katherine; DeArmond, Stephen J.; Haman, Aissa; Garcia, Paul; Johnson, David Y.; Miller, Bruce L.; Geschwind, Michael D.\n\n2015-01-01\n\nObjectives To identify the misdiagnoses of patients with sporadic Jakob-Creutzfeldt disease (sCJD) during the course of their disease and determine which medical specialties saw patients with sCJD prior to the correct diagnosis being made and at what point in the disease course a correct diagnosis was made. Design Retrospective medical record review. Setting A specialty referral center of a tertiary academic medical center. Participants One hundred sixty-three serial patients over a 5.5-year period who ultimately had pathologically proven sCJD. The study used the subset of 97 patients for whom we had adequate medical records. Main Outcome Measures Other diagnoses considered in the differential diagnosis and types of medical specialties assessing patients with sCJD. Results Ninety-seven subjectsâ records were used in the final analysis. The most common disease categories of misdiagnosis were neurodegenerative, autoimmune/paraneoplastic, infectious, and toxic/metabolic disorders. The most common individual misdiagnoses were viral encephalitis, paraneoplastic disorder, depression, vertigo, Alzheimer disease, stroke, unspecified dementia, central nervous system vasculitis, peripheral neuropathy, and Hashimoto encephalopathy. The physicians who most commonly made these misdiagnoses were primary care physicians and neurologists; in the 18% of patients who were diagnosed correctly at their first assessment, the diagnosis was almost always by a neurologist. The mean time from onset to diagnosis was 7.9 months, an average of two-thirds of the way through their disease course. Conclusions Diagnosis of sCJD is quite delayed. When evaluating patients with rapidly progressive dementia with suspected neurodegenerative, autoimmune, infectious, or toxic/metabolic etiology, sCJD should also be included in the differential diagnosis, and appropriate diagnostic tests, such as diffusion brain magnetic resonance imaging, should be considered.

The water deprivation test with assessment of AVP activity is currently the gold standard for differential diagnosis in patients presenting polyuria-polydipsia syndrome. Nevertheless, it can be dangerous without proper surveillance and its interpretation may be challenging. Other markers have been suggested. Direct quantification of circulating AVP is not sufficient for diagnosis: vasopressin is unstable, analysis is complex. AVP comes from prohormone preprovasopressin with concomitant release of copeptin (C-terminal moiety) in the equimolar ratio. Copeptin is stable in vitro, with easy and rapid measurement (<4h). Past studies have shown greater sensitivity and specificity of copeptin versus AVP to discriminate etiologies of polyuria in adults, but its value has not been demonstrated in infants yet. A 7-month-old infant presented polyuria-polydipsia syndrome with poor weight gain. Laboratory tests pointed out hypernatremia (170mmol/L) and blood hyperosmolarity (330mOsm/L) with inappropriate urinary hypoosmolarity (168mOsm/L). Plasmatic copeptin measurement was found at a very high level, 303pmol/L (1-14pmol/L). DdAVP administration did not improve the polyuria, confirming the final diagnosis of NDI. Hyperhydration with a hypoosmolar diet normalized the hydration status and circulating levels of copeptin within 1 week. Copeptin, a stable peptide reflecting AVP secretion, could be a safer and faster biomarker for etiological diagnosis of polyuria-polydipsia syndrome in children. Before regularization of hydration status, a single baseline measurement may be enough to discriminate NDI from other etiologies without the water deprivation test.

Three distinct viruses may cause them: camelpox virus (CMLV), camel parapox virus (CPPV) and camelus dromedary papilloma virus (CdPV). These diseases are often difficult to differentiate based on clinical presentation in disease outbreaks. Molecular methods such as PCR targeting species-specific genes have been developed and used to identify these diseases, but not simultaneously in a single tube. Recently, multiplex PCR has gained reputation as a convenient diagnostic method with cost-and timesaving benefits. In the present communication, we describe the development, optimization and validation of a multiplex PCR assay able to detect simultaneously the genome of the three viruses in one single test allowing for rapid and efficient molecular diagnosis. The assay was developed based on the evaluation and combination of published and new primer sets and was validated with viral genomic DNA extracted from known virus strains (nâ=â14) and DNA extracted from homogenized clinical skin specimens (nâ=â86). The assay detects correctly the target pathogens by amplification of targeted genes, even in case of co-infection. The method showed high sensitivity, and the specificity was confirmed by PCR-product sequencing. This assay provide rapid, sensitive and specific method for identifying three important viruses in specimens collected from dromedary camels with varying clinical presentations.\n\nRapid Whole-Genome Sequencing for Genetic Disease Diagnosis in Neonatal Intensive Care Units\n\nPubMed Central\n\nSaunders, Carol Jean; Miller, Neil Andrew; Soden, Sarah Elizabeth; Dinwiddie, Darrell Lee; Noll, Aaron; Alnadi, Noor Abu; Andraws, Nevene; Patterson, Melanie LeAnn; Krivohlavek, Lisa Ann; Fellis, Joel; Humphray, Sean; Saffrey, Peter; Kingsbury, Zoya; Weir, Jacqueline Claire; Betley, Jason; Grocock, Russell James; Margulies, Elliott Harrison; Farrow, Emily Gwendolyn; Artman, Michael; Safina, Nicole Pauline; Petrikin, Joshua Erin; Hall, Kevin Peter; Kingsmore, Stephen Francis\n\n2014-01-01\n\nMonogenic diseases are frequent causes of neonatal morbidity and mortality, and disease presentations are often undifferentiated at birth. More than 3500 monogenic diseases have been characterized, but clinical testing is available for only some of them and many feature clinical and genetic heterogeneity. Hence, an immense unmet need exists for improved molecular diagnosis in infants. Because disease progression is extremely rapid, albeit heterogeneous, in newborns, molecular diagnoses must occur quickly to be relevant for clinical decision-making. We describe 50-hour differential diagnosis of genetic disorders by whole-genome sequencing (WGS) that features automated bioinformatic analysis and is intended to be a prototype for use in neonatal intensive care units. Retrospective 50-hour WGS identified known molecular diagnoses in two children. Prospective WGS disclosed potential molecular diagnosis of a severe GJB2-related skin disease in one neonate; BRAT1-related lethal neonatal rigidity and multifocal seizure syndrome in another infant; identified BCL9L as a novel, recessive visceral heterotaxy gene (HTX6) in a pedigree; and ruled out known candidate genes in one infant. Sequencing of parents or affected siblings expedited the identification of disease genes in prospective cases. Thus, rapid WGS can potentially broaden and foreshorten differential diagnosis, resulting in fewer empirical treatments and faster progression to genetic and prognostic counseling.

Imaging plays a crucial role in the diagnosis, differential diagnosis and planning of treatment. Methods âThis review article presents the different types of hydrocephalus und their typical imaging appearance, describes imaging techniques, and discusses differential diagnoses of the different forms of hydrocephalus. Results and Conclusion âImaging plays a central role in the diagnosis of hydrocephalus. While magnetic resonance (MR) imaging is the first-line imaging modality, computed tomography (CT) is often the first-line imaging test in emergency patients. Key points â Â· Occlusive hydrocephalus is caused by obstruction of CSF pathways.. Â· Malabsorptive hydrocephalus is caused by impaired CSF absorption.. Â· The MR imaging protocol should always include sagittal high-resolution T2-weighted images.. Â· When an inflammatory etiology is suspected, imaging with contrast agent administration is necessary..

M.; Vogeser, M.\n\n2015-07-01\n\nPorphyrias are rare genetic metabolic disorders, which result from deficiencies of enzymes in the heme biosynthesis pathway. Depending on the enzyme defect, different types of porphyrins and heme precursors accumulate for the different porphyria diseases in erythrocytes, liver, blood plasma, urine and stool. Patients with acute hepatic porphyrias can suffer from acute neuropathic attacks, which can lead to death when undiagnosed, but show only unspecific clinical symptoms such as abdominal pain. Therefore, in addition to chromatographic methods, a rapid screening test is required to allow for immediate identification and treatment of these patients. In this study, fluorescence spectroscopic measurements were conducted on blood plasma and phantom material, mimicking the composition of blood plasma of porphyria patients. Hydrochloric acid was used to differentiate the occurring porphyrins (uroporphyrin-III and coproporphyrin-III) spectroscopically despite their initially overlapping excitation spectra. Plasma phantom mixtures were measured using dual wavelength excitation and the corresponding concentrations of uroporphyrin-III and coproporphyrin-III were determined. Additionally, three plasma samples of porphyria patients were examined and traces of coproporphyrin-III and uroporphyrin-III were identified. This study may therefore help to establish a rapid screening test method with spectroscopic differentiation of the occurring porphyrins, which consequently allows for the distinction of different porphyrias. This may be a valuable tool for clinical porphyria diagnosis and rapid or immediate treatment.\n\nNeutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio in the differential diagnosis of acute bacterial meningitis.\n\nPubMed\n\nMentis, A-F A; Kyprianou, M A; Xirogianni, A; Kesanopoulos, K; Tzanakaki, G\n\n2016-03-01\n\nThe differential diagnosis of acute community-acquired meningitis is of paramount importance in both therapeutic and healthcare-related economic terms. Despite the routinely used markers, novel, easily calculated, and rapidly available biomarkers are needed particularly in resource-poor settings. A promising, exponentially studied inflammatory marker is the neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR), albeit not assessed in meningitis. The aim of this study was to investigate the utility of the NLR in the differential diagnosis of acute meningitis. Data on cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and blood leukocyte parameters from more than 4,000 patients diagnosed with either bacterial or viral meningitis in Greece during the period 2006-2013 were retrospectively examined. The diagnostic accuracy of the NLR and neutrophil counts in CSF and blood were evaluated by receiver operating characteristic curves. The discrimination ability of both the NLR and neutrophil counts was significantly higher in CSF than in blood. The optimal cutoff values of the NLR and neutrophil counts were 2 in CSF vs 8 in blood, and 287 cells in CSF vs 12,100 cells in blood, respectively. For these values, sensitivity, negative predictive value, and odds ratio were statistically significantly higher in CSF than blood for both markers. Logistic regression analysis showed that the CSF NLR carries independent and additive information to neutrophil counts in the differential diagnosis of acute meningitis. This study is the first one to assess NLR in acute meningitis, providing promising results for its differential diagnosis.\n\nRapid diagnosis of pulmonary tuberculosis\n\nPubMed Central\n\nSarmiento, JosÃ© Mauricio HernÃ¡ndez; Restrepo, Natalia Builes; MejÃ­a, Gloria Isabel; Zapata, Elsa; Restrepo, Mary Alejandra; Robledo, Jaime\n\n2014-01-01\n\nIntroduction World Health Organization had estimated 9.4 million tuberculosis cases on 2009, with 1.7 million of deaths as consequence of treatment and diagnosis failures. Improving diagnostic methods for the rapid and timely detection of tuberculosis patients is critical to control the disease. The aim of this study was evaluating the accuracy of the cord factor detection on the solid medium Middlebrook 7H11 thin layer agar compared to the Lowenstein Jensen medium for the rapid tuberculosis diagnosis. Methods Patients with suspected tuberculosis were enrolled and their sputum samples were processed for direct smear and culture on Lowenstein Jensen and BACTEC MGIT 960, from which positive tubes were subcultured on Middlebrook 7H11 thin layer agar. Statistical analysis was performed comparing culture results from Lowenstein Jensen and the thin layer agar, and their corresponding average times for detecting Mycobacterium tuberculosis. The performance of cord factor detection was evaluated determining its sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive value. Results 111 out of 260 patients were positive for M. tuberculosis by Lowenstein Jensen medium with an average time Â± standard deviation for its detection of 22.3 Â± 8.5 days. 115 patients were positive by the MGIT system identifying the cord factor by the Middlebrook 7H11 thin layer agar which average time Â± standard deviation was 5.5 Â± 2.6 days. Conclusion The cord factor detection by Middlebrook 7H11 thin layer agar allows early and accurate tuberculosis diagnosis during an average time of 5 days, making this rapid diagnosis particularly important in patients with negative sputum smear.

They affect nearly 80 thousand of Brazilians. In recent years, the increased scientific knowledge on NF has allowed better clinical management and reduced complication morbidity, resulting in higher quality of life for NF patients. In most cases, neurology, psychiatry, dermatology, clinical geneticists, oncology and internal medicine specialists are able to make the differential diagnosis between NF and other diseases and to identify major NF complications. Nevertheless, due to its great variability in phenotype expression, progressive course, multiple organs involvement and unpredictable natural evolution, NF often requires the support of neurofibromatoses specialists for proper treatment and genetic counseling. This Part 1 offers step-by-step guidelines for NF differential diagnosis. Part 2 will present the NF clinical management.\n\nDifferential diagnosis of suspected multiple sclerosis: a consensus approach\n\nPubMed Central\n\nMiller, DH; Weinshenker, BG; Filippi, M; Banwell, BL; Cohen, JA; Freedman, MS; Galetta, SL; Hutchinson, M; Johnson, RT; Kappos, L; Kira, J; Lublin, FD; McFarland, HF; Montalban, X; Panitch, H; Richert, JR; Reingold, SC; Polman, CH\n\n2008-01-01\n\nBackground and objectives Diagnosis of multiple sclerosis (MS) requires exclusion of diseases that could better explain the clinical and paraclinical findings. A systematic process for exclusion of alternative diagnoses has not been defined. An International Panel of MS experts developed consensus perspectives on MS differential diagnosis. Methods Using available literature and consensus, we developed guidelines for MS differential diagnosis, focusing on exclusion of potential MS mimics, diagnosis of common initial isolated clinical syndromes, and differentiating between MS and non-MS idiopathic inflammatory demyelinating diseases. Results We present recommendations for 1) clinical and paraclinical red flags suggesting alternative diagnoses to MS; 2) more precise definition of âclinically isolated syndromesâ (CIS), often the first presentations of MS or its alternatives; 3) algorithms for diagnosis of three common CISs related to MS in the optic nerves, brainstem, and spinal cord; and 4) a classification scheme and diagnosis criteria for idiopathic inflammatory demyelinating disorders of the central nervous system. Conclusions Differential diagnosis leading to MS or alternatives is complex and a strong evidence base is lacking. Consensus-determined guidelines provide a practical path for diagnosis and will be useful for the non-MS specialist neurologist. Recommendations are made for future research to validate and support these guidelines. Guidance on the differential diagnosis process when MS is under consideration will enhance diagnostic accuracy and precision.

The theme of this paper is the differential diagnosis between dissociative disorders and schizophrenia. Schneiderian first-rank symptoms in schizophrenia are common in dissociative disorders, especially in dissociative identity disorder (DID). Many DID patients have been misdiagnosed as schizophrenics and treated with neuroleptics. We compared and examined Schneiderian symptoms of schizophrenia and those of dissociative disorders from a structural viewpoint. In dissociative disorders, delusional perception and somatic passivity are not seen. \"Lateness\" and \"Precedence of the Other\" originated from the concept of \"Pattern Reversal\" (H. Yasunaga)\" is characteristic of schizophrenia. It is important to check these basic structure of schizophrenia in subjective experiences in differential diagnosis between dissociative disorders and schizophrenia.\n\nSpecific phobias in older adults: characteristics and differential diagnosis.\n\nPubMed\n\nCoelho, Carlos M; GonÃ§alves, Daniela C; Purkis, Helena; Pocinho, Margarida; Pachana, Nancy A; Byrne, Gerard J\n\n2010-08-01\n\nDifferential diagnosis implies identifying shared and divergent characteristics between clinical states. Clinical work with older adults demands not only the knowledge of nosological features associated with differential diagnosis, but also recognition of idiosyncratic factors associated with this population. Several factors can interfere with an accurate diagnosis of specific phobia in older cohorts. The goal of this paper is to review criteria for specific phobia and its differential diagnosis with panic disorder, agoraphobia, post-traumatic stress disorder and obsessive compulsive disorder, while stressing the specific factors associated with aging. A literature search regarding specific phobia in older adults was carried out using PubMed. Relevant articles were selected and scanned for further pertinent references. In addition, relevant references related to differential diagnosis and assessment were used. Etiologic factors, specificity of feared stimulus or situation, fear predictability and the nature of phobic situations are key points to be assessed when implementing a differential diagnosis of specific phobia. First, age-related sensory impairments are common and interfere both with information processing and communication. Second, medical illnesses create symptoms that might cause, interfere with, or mimic anxiety. Third, cohort effects might result in underreporting, through the inability to communicate or recognize anxiety symptoms, misattributing them to physical conditions. Finally, diagnostic criteria and screening instruments were usually developed using younger samples and are therefore not adapted to the functional and behavioral characteristics of older samples.\n\nThe use of real-time polymerase chain reaction for rapid diagnosis of skeletal tuberculosis.\n\nPubMed\n\nKobayashi, Naomi; Fraser, Thomas G; Bauer, Thomas W; Joyce, Michael J; Hall, Gerri S; Tuohy, Marion J; Procop, Gary W\n\n2006-07-01\n\nWe identified Mycobacterium tuberculosis DNA using real-time polymerase chain reaction on a specimen from an osteolytic lesion of a femoral condyle, in which the frozen section demonstrated granulomas. The process was much more rapid than is possible with culture. The rapid detection of M tuberculosis and the concomitant exclusion of granulomatous disease caused by nontuberculous mycobacteria or systemic fungi are necessary to appropriately treat skeletal tuberculosis. The detection and identification of M tuberculosis by culture may require several weeks using traditional methods. The real-time polymerase chain reaction method used has been shown to be rapid and reliable, and is able to detect and differentiate both tuberculous and nontuberculous mycobacteria. Real-time polymerase chain reaction may become a diagnostic standard for the evaluation of clinical specimens for the presence of mycobacteria; this case demonstrates the potential utility of this assay for the rapid diagnosis of skeletal tuberculosis.\n\nRapid Diagnosis of Rhabdomyolysis with Point-of-Care Ultrasound.\n\nPubMed\n\nNassar, Alicia; Talbot, Richard; Grant, Ashley; Derr, Charlotte\n\n2016-11-01\n\nIt is important to rapidly diagnosis and treat rhabdomyolysis in order to decrease morbidity and mortality. To date there are no reports in the emergency medicine literature on the use of point-of-care ultrasound in the diagnosis of rhabdomyolysis. This unique case describes how ultrasound was used in the emergency department (ED) to quickly diagnose and treat rhabdomyolysis prior to confirmation with an elevated serum creatine kinase. When coupled with a high index of suspicion, ultrasound can be one of the most portable, readily available, low cost, and minimally invasive techniques for making a rapid diagnosis of rhabdomyolysis in the ED.\n\n[The usefulness of in vitro interferon-gamma assay for differential diagnosis between intestinal tuberculosis and Crohns disease].\n\nPubMed\n\nLee, Jung Nam; Ryu, Dong Yup; Park, Sung Han; You, Hyun Seok; Lee, Bong Eun; Kim, Dong Uk; Kim, Tae Oh; Heo, Jeong; Kim, Gwang Ha; Song, Geun Am; Kim, Suk; Park, Do Youn\n\n2010-06-01\n\nIt is difficult to clinically and endoscopically differentiate intestinal tuberculosis (ITB) and Crohns disease (CD). The aim of this study was to evaluate the usefulness of in vitro interferon-gamma (INF-gamma) assay for differential diagnosis between ITB and CD. Sixty patients for whom differential diagnosis between ITB and CD was difficult were enrolled between January 2007 and January 2009. The INF-gamma-producing T-cell response to early secreted antigenic target 6 and culture filtrate protein 10 were measured by T-SPOT.TB blood test in vitro. We evaluated the usefulness of T-SPOT.TB blood test by comparing its results with the final diagnosis. Twenty and forty patients were revealed to be positive and negative in T-SPOT.TB blood test, respectively. Of the 20 patients found to be positive, 12 patients (60%) were finally diagnosed as ITB, 6 patients as CD, and 2 patients as Behcets enterocolitis. Of the 40 patients with negative results, 38 patients (95%) were diagnosed as CD; one as Behcets enterocolitis; one as nonspecific colitis; none as ITB. The sensitivity and specificity of T-SPOT.TB blood test for ITB were 100% and 83.3%, respectively. Positive and negative predictive values of T-SPOT.TB blood test for ITB were 60.0% and 100%, respectively. When differential diagnosis between ITB and CD is difficult, T-SPOT.TB blood test may be a helpful and rapid diagnostic tool to exclude ITB. Prospective large-scaled studies are required for further evaluation of the usefulness of T-SPOT.TB blood test for differential diagnosis between ITB and CD.\n\nOrbital inflammatory disease: Pictorial review and differential diagnosis\n\nPubMed Central\n\nPakdaman, Michael N; Sepahdari, Ali R; Elkhamary, Sahar M\n\n2014-01-01\n\nOrbital inflammatory disease (OID) represents a collection of inflammatory conditions affecting the orbit. OID is a diagnosis of exclusion, with the differential diagnosis including infection, systemic inflammatory conditions, and neoplasms, among other conditions. Inflammatory conditions in OID include dacryoadenitis, myositis, cellulitis, optic perineuritis, periscleritis, orbital apicitis, and a focal mass. Sclerosing orbital inflammation is a rare condition with a chronic, indolent course involving dense fibrosis and lymphocytic infiltrate. Previously thought to be along the spectrum of OID, it is now considered a distinct pathologic entity. Imaging plays an important role in elucidating any underlying etiology behind orbital inflammation and is critical for ruling out other conditions prior to a definitive diagnosis of OID. In this review, we will explore the common sites of involvement by OID and discuss differential diagnosis by site and key imaging findings for each condition. PMID:24778772\n\nDeveloping a semantic web model for medical differential diagnosis recommendation.\n\nPubMed\n\nMohammed, Osama; Benlamri, Rachid\n\n2014-10-01\n\nIn this paper we describe a novel model for differential diagnosis designed to make recommendations by utilizing semantic web technologies. The model is a response to a number of requirements, ranging from incorporating essential clinical diagnostic semantics to the integration of data mining for the process of identifying candidate diseases that best explain a set of clinical features. We introduce two major components, which we find essential to the construction of an integral differential diagnosis recommendation model: the evidence-based recommender component and the proximity-based recommender component. Both approaches are driven by disease diagnosis ontologies designed specifically to enable the process of generating diagnostic recommendations. These ontologies are the disease symptom ontology and the patient ontology. The evidence-based diagnosis process develops dynamic rules based on standardized clinical pathways. The proximity-based component employs data mining to provide clinicians with diagnosis predictions, as well as generates new diagnosis rules from provided training datasets. This article describes the integration between these two components along with the developed diagnosis ontologies to form a novel medical differential diagnosis recommendation model. This article also provides test cases from the implementation of the overall model, which shows quite promising diagnostic recommendation results.\n\nThe value of electrocardiography for differential diagnosis in wide QRS complex tachycardia.\n\nPubMed\n\nSousa, Pedro A; Pereira, SalomÃ©; Candeias, Rui; de Jesus, IlÃ­dio\n\n2014-03-01\n\nCorrect diagnosis in wide QRS complex tachycardia remains a challenge. Differential diagnosis between ventricular and supraventricular tachycardia has important therapeutic and prognostic implications, and although data from clinical history and physical examination may suggest a particular origin, it is the 12-lead surface electrocardiogram that usually enables this differentiation. Since 1978, various electrocardiographic criteria have been proposed for the differential diagnosis of wide complex tachycardias, particularly the presence of atrioventricular dissociation, and the axis, duration and morphology of QRS complexes. Despite the wide variety of criteria, diagnosis is still often difficult, and errors can have serious consequences. To reduce such errors, several differential diagnosis algorithms have been proposed since 1991. However, in a small percentage of wide QRS tachycardias the diagnosis remains uncertain and in these the wisest decision is to treat them as ventricular tachycardias. The authors' objective was to review the main electrocardiographic criteria and differential diagnosis algorithms of wide QRS tachycardia. Copyright Â© 2012 Sociedade Portuguesa de Cardiologia.

Thirty patients were hospitalized with diagnosis of gastric and/or duodenal ulcer. Helicobacter pylori was identified morphologically or with a rapid urease test. Syphilis was rejected when microprecipitation reaction was negative and confirmed with Wassermann reaction. The patients received standard treatment including a course of eradication therapy. Endoscopic examination discovered single and multiple ulcers in 25 and 5 patients, respectively, located in the stomach and duodenum. A rapid test for syphilis produced negative and positive results in 28 and 2 patients, respectively. Twenty two patients tolerated eradication therapy well. Positive results were achieved in 19 (84.6%) patients. Six patients had side effects (pruritus, urticaria, dyspepsia) on eradication treatment day 2-3. Jarisch-Herxheimer reaction (elevated body temperature 38-38.6 degrees C) and roseola eruption were observed in 2 (6.7%) patients with positive serological reactions for syphilis on the first day of eradication therapy. Diagnostic criteria of EGS are the following: serologically confirmed manifest or latent syphilis, poor effect of standard antiulcer treatment, rapid elimination of the disease symptoms in antisyphilis therapy and positive changes in pathological alterations in gastric mucosa.\n\nDifferential diagnosis of food protein-induced enterocolitis syndrome\n\nPubMed Central\n\nFiocchi, Alessandro; Claps, Alessia; Dahdah, Lamia; Brindisi, Giulia; Dionisi-Vici, Carlo; Martelli, Alberto\n\n2014-01-01\n\nPurpose of review To assess all the possible differential diagnosis of food protein-induced enterocolitis syndrome (FPIES), both in acute and chronic presentation, reviewing the data reported in published studies. Recent findings There is an increase of reported cases of FPIES in recent years. As the disease presents with nonspecific symptoms, it can be misunderstood in many ways. The differential diagnosis includes, in acute presentations, the following: sepsis, other infectious diseases, acute gastrointestinal episodes, surgical emergencies, food allergies. In its chronic forms, FPIES may mimic malabsorption syndromes, metabolic disorders, primary immunodeficiencies, neurological conditions, coagulation defects, and other types of non-IgE-mediated food allergy. Summary A thorough clinical evaluation, including symptoms, signs, and laboratory findings, is necessary to lead the clinicians toward the diagnosis of FPIES. The major reason for delayed diagnosis appears to be the lack of knowledge of the disease.

Few descriptions of the cytologic features of this neoplasm are available. This study describes the cytologic features of three subependymomas, as well as their differential diagnosis based on cytology. Three men, aged 52, 56, and 63 years, presented with headache. Magnetic resonance imaging revealed a nodular intraventricular mass in all three patients. Intraoperative squash cytology specimens from the three intraventricular tumors showed nodular clusters with microcystic changes. Nuclei were round to oval in shape, but showed no evidence of severe nuclear atypia or mitoses. Histological examination showed features of subependymoma. Squash cytology findings, including nodular clusters, mild cellular atypia, microcystic changes, and mucoid material, are useful in the rapid intraoperative diagnosis of subependymoma.

In this study, we evaluated the process of defining the differential diagnosis for inhalational anthrax using electronic communication within a practice-based research network (PBRN) and compared the results with those obtained from a nationwide random sample of family physicians with a mailed instrument. We distributed survey instruments by e-mail to 55 physician members of the Wisconsin Research Network (WReN), a regional PBRN. The instruments consisted of 3 case vignettes randomly drawn from a set describing 11 patients with inhalational anthrax, 2 with influenza A, and 1 with Legionella pneumonia. Physicians provided their most likely nonanthrax diagnosis, along with their responses to 4 yes-or-no management questions for each case. Physicians who had not responded at 1 week received a second e-mail with the survey instrument. The comparison group consisted of the nationwide sample of physicians who completed mailed survey instruments. Primary outcome measures were response rate, median response time, and frequencies of diagnostic categories assigned to cases of inhalational anthrax. The PBRN response rate compared favorably with that of the national sample (47.3% vs 37.0%; P = not significant). The median response time for the PBRN was significantly shorter than that for the national sample (2 vs 28 days; P < .001). No significant differences were found between the PBRN and the Midwest subset of the national sample in the frequencies of major diagnostic categories or in case management. Electronic means of creating differential diagnoses for rare infectious diseases of national significance is feasible within PBRNs. Information is much more rapidly acquired and is consistent with that obtained by conventional methods.\n\nHow to Differentiate Borderline Hepatic Nodules in Hepatocarcinogenesis: Emphasis on Imaging Diagnosis.\n\nPubMed\n\nPark, Hyun Jeong; Choi, Byung Ihn; Lee, Eun Sun; Park, Sung Bin; Lee, Jong Beum\n\n2017-06-01\n\nRapid advances in liver imaging have improved the evaluation of hepatocarcinogenesis and early diagnosis and treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). In this situation, detection of early-stage HCC in its development is important for the improvement of patient survival and optimal treatment strategies. Because early HCCs are considered precursors of progressed HCC, precise differentiation between a dysplastic nodule (DN), especially a high-grade DN, and early HCC is important. In clinical practice, these nodules are frequently called \"borderline hepatic nodules.\" This article discusses radiological and pathological characteristics of these borderline hepatic nodules and offers an understanding of multistep hepatocarcinogenesis by focusing on the descriptions of the imaging changes in the progression of DN and early HCC. Detection and accurate diagnosis of borderline hepatic nodules are still a challenge with contrast enhanced ultrasonography, CT, and MRI with extracellular contrast agents. However, gadoxetic acid-enhanced MRI may be useful for improving the diagnosis of these borderline nodules. Since there is a net effect of incomplete neoangiogenesis and decreased portal venous flow in the early stage of hepatocarcinogenesis, borderline hepatic nodules commonly show iso- or hypovascularity. Therefore, precise differentiation of these nodules remains a challenging issue. In MRI using hepatobiliary contrast agents, signal intensity of HCCs on hepatobiliary phase (HBP) is regarded as a potential imaging biomarker. Borderline hepatic nodules are seen as nonhypervascular and hypointense nodules on the HBP, which is important for predicting tumor behavior and determining appropriate therapeutic strategies.\n\nRapid immunohistochemistry based on alternating current electric field for intraoperative diagnosis of brain tumors.\n\nPubMed\n\nTanino, Mishie; Sasajima, Toshio; Nanjo, Hiroshi; Akesaka, Shiori; Kagaya, Masami; Kimura, Taichi; Ishida, Yusuke; Oda, Masaya; Takahashi, Masataka; Sugawara, Taku; Yoshioka, Toshiaki; Nishihara, Hiroshi; Akagami, Yoichi; Goto, Akiteru; Minamiya, Yoshihiro; Tanaka, Shinya\n\n2015-01-01\n\nRapid immunohistochemistry (R-IHC) can contribute to the intraoperative diagnosis of central nervous system (CNS) tumors. We have recently developed a new IHC method based on an alternating current electric field to facilitate the antigen-antibody reaction. To ensure the requirement of R-IHC for intraoperative diagnosis, 183 cases of CNS tumors were reviewed regarding the accuracy rate of diagnosis without R-IHC. The diagnostic accuracy was 90.7 % (166/183 cases) [corrected] in which definitive diagnoses were not provided in 17 cases because of the failure of glioma grading and differential diagnosis of lymphoma and glioma. To establish the clinicopathological application, R-IHC for frozen specimens was compared with standard IHC for permanent specimens. 33 gliomas were analyzed, and the Ki-67/MIB-1 indices of frozen specimens by R-IHC were consistent with the grade and statistically correlated with those of permanent specimens. Thus, R-IHC provided supportive information to determine the grade of glioma. For discrimination between glioma and lymphoma, R-IHC was able to provide clear results of CD20 and Ki-67/MIB-1 in four frozen specimens of CNS lymphoma as well as standard IHC. We conclude that the R-IHC for frozen specimens can provide important information for intraoperative diagnosis of CNS tumors.\n\nAuto-immune encephalitis as differential diagnosis of infectious encephalitis\n\nPubMed Central\n\nArmangue, ThaÃ­s; Leypoldt, Frank; Dalmau, Josep\n\n2014-01-01\n\nPurpose of review To describe the main types of autoimmune encephalitis with special emphasis on those associated with antibodies against neuronal cell surface or synaptic proteins, and the differential diagnosis with infectious encephalitis. Recent findings There is a continuous expansion of the number of cell surface or synaptic proteins that are targets of autoimmunity. The most recently identified include the mGluR5, DPPX, and the GABAAR. In these and previously known autoimmune encephalitis (NMDAR, AMPAR, GABABR, LGI1, CASPR2), the prodromal symptoms or types of presentations often suggest a viral encephalitis. We review here clues that help in the differential diagnosis with infectious encephalitis. Moreover, recent investigations indicate that viral encephalitis (e.g., herpes simplex) can trigger synaptic autoimmunity. In all these disorders immunotherapy is usually effective. Summary Autoimmune encephalitis comprises an expanding group of potentially treatable disorders that should be included in the differential diagnosis of any type of encephalitis.

In the differential count there was a shift to the left and an increase of monocyte-like cells (35%). Differential diagnosis included leucemoid reaction, infectious mononucleosis, myelo-proliferative disorder with a missing C chromosome and chronic myeloid leucemia. Clinical symptoms, cytochemistry and caryotype of bone marrow cells suggested infantile chronic myeloic leucemia and normal ALP index and possibly normal HbF. Treatment with 6-mercaptopurine was followed by partial remission. The therapeutic consequences of exact differential diagnosis are discussed.\n\nMagnetic resonance imaging differential diagnosis of brainstem lesions in children\n\nPubMed Central\n\nQuattrocchi, Carlo Cosimo; Errante, Yuri; Rossi Espagnet, Maria Camilla; Galassi, Stefania; Della Sala, Sabino Walter; Bernardi, Bruno; Fariello, Giuseppe; Longo, Daniela\n\n2016-01-01\n\nDifferential diagnosis of brainstem lesions, either isolated or in association with cerebellar and supra-tentorial lesions, can be challenging. Knowledge of the structural organization is crucial for the differential diagnosis and establishment of prognosis of pathologies with involvement of the brainstem. Familiarity with the location of the lesions in the brainstem is essential, especially in the pediatric population. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is the most sensitive and specific imaging technique for diagnosing disorders of the posterior fossa and, particularly, the brainstem. High magnetic static field MRI allows detailed visualization of the morphology, signal intensity and metabolic content of the brainstem nuclei, together with visualization of the normal development and myelination. In this pictorial essay we review the brainstem pathology in pediatric patients and consider the MR imaging patterns that may help the radiologist to differentiate among vascular, toxico-metabolic, infective-inflammatory, degenerative and neoplastic processes. Helpful MR tips can guide the differential diagnosis: These include the location and morphology of lesions, the brainstem vascularization territories, gray and white matter distribution and tissue selective vulnerability.

For this, smooth and tight cooperation between physician and laboratory where medical technologists are working will become to the key. Rapid diagnosis for infectious diseases can contribute on the patient care, however the laboratory has a self-limitation. That is a seesaw phenomenon; rapidity vs accuracy, rapidity vs sensitivity, rapidity vs easygoing, rapidity vs carefulness, etc. From the laboratory aspect, medical technologists should function as the effective access-point in the evidence-based medicine (EBM), and should have a reasonable balance in judging seesaw phenomena, and should be keeping up their knowledge and technical skill.\n\nRapidly Progressive Dementia\n\nPubMed Central\n\nGeschwind, Michael D.\n\n2016-01-01\n\nPurpose of Review: This article presents a practical and informative approach to the evaluation of a patient with a rapidly progressive dementia (RPD). Recent Findings: Prion diseases are the prototypical causes of RPD, but reversible causes of RPD might mimic prion disease and should always be considered in a differential diagnosis. Aside from prion diseases, the most common causes of RPD are atypical presentations of other neurodegenerative disorders, curable disorders including autoimmune encephalopathies, as well as some infections, and neoplasms. Numerous recent case reports suggest dural arterial venous fistulas sometimes cause RPDs. Summary: RPDs, in which patients typically develop dementia over weeks to months, require an alternative differential than the slowly progressive dementias that occur over a few years. Because of their rapid decline, patients with RPDs necessitate urgent evaluation and often require an extensive workup, typically with multiple tests being sent or performed concurrently. Jakob-Creutzfeldt disease, perhaps the prototypical RPD, is often the first diagnosis many neurologists consider when treating a patient with rapid cognitive decline. Many conditions other than prion disease, however, including numerous reversible or curable conditions, can present as an RPD. This chapter discusses some of the major etiologies for RPDs and offers an algorithm for diagnosis.

Phocomelia is an abnormality in which the limbs are not fully formed. It may be inherited as an autosomal recessive or dominant disorder. This case concerns a 12-year-old Afghan boy with multiple skeletal anomalies, most prominently of his right arm, including aplasia of the entire proximal humerus, hypoplasia of the clavicle and scapula, and absence of the radial ray and thumb. A hypoplastic left thumb was also present. Other anomalies included thoracic scoliosis, upper thoracic hemivertebrae, and mild cardiomegaly.

It has symptoms in common with affective and anxiety disorders, with which it can co-occur, and these are delineated for purposes of differential diagnosis. Possible reasons for the preponderance of the condition in women are discussed, along with suggested intervention strategies.\n\nRapid diagnosis of liver cancer by ultrasound-guided fine-needle aspiration biopsy.\n\nPubMed\n\nHuber, K; Heuhold, N\n\n1987-01-01\n\nBecause of the relatively favorable prognosis to the patient with early detected hepatocarcinoma followed by surgical treatment if resection is possible, it is important to differentiate quickly between primary and secondary liver cancer. Ultrasound-guided percutaneous fine needle aspiration biopsy (US-FNAB) was used as a first diagnostic measure in patients with sonographic evidence of liver tumors. Biopsies were done under sonographic control and antiseptic conditions from the center and the border zone of solid tumors of the liver, and the aspirated cell material was air dried on glass slides and Giemsa stained. The cytologic diagnosis was proved by clinical course and in most cases by surgical or autoptic histology. Cytologic evaluation lead in 15 cases to the diagnosis of definitive or suspicious malignant liver disease; the sensitivity was 93% and the specificity was 87%. One case classified as suspicious for malignancy by cytologic examination could be identified as cirrhotic nodule by further investigations. In none of the patients did we find complications from the biopsy procedure. From these data it is concluded that US-FNAB can serve as a rapid, inexpensive, safe, and highly accurate first diagnostic step in patients with solid lesions of the liver.\n\nDifferential diagnosis of cough: focus on lung malignancy.\n\nPubMed\n\nBrashers, V L; Haden, K\n\n2000-01-01\n\nEvaluating cough in the primary care setting can be very difficult and requires a thorough look through a long list of potential differential diagnoses. The most worrisome diagnosis is that of a lung malignancy. Primary care providers must assess each patient carefully in a logical, precise manner to determine a working diagnosis for acute versus chronic cough in smokers and nonsmokers. Early detection leads to a diagnosis of lung cancer at earlier stages and may offer the only possibility of cure. This article provides primary care providers with an overview of the most common causes of cough, an algorithm to assist with the diagnosis, and a brief overview of the staging, diagnostic workup, treatment, and management of lung cancer.\n\nDifferential diagnosis and treatment of periodontitis-mimicking actinomycosis.\n\nPubMed\n\nKim, Nam Ryang; Park, Jun-Beom; Ko, Youngkyung\n\n2012-12-01\n\nActinomycosis is an uncommon chronic granulomatous disease that presents as a slowly progressive, indolent, indurated infiltration with multiple abscesses, fistulas, and sinuses. The purpose of this article is to report on a case of actinomycosis with clinical findings similar to periodontitis. A 46-year-old female presented with recurrent throbbing pain on the right first and second molar of the mandible three weeks after root planing. Exploratory flap surgery was performed, and the bluish-gray tissue fragment found in the interproximal area between the two molars was sent for histopathology. The diagnosis from the biopsy was actinomycosis. The clinical and radiographic manifestations of this case were clinically indistinguishable from periodontitis. The patient did not report any symptoms, and she is scheduled for a follow-up visit. The present study has identified periodontitis-mimicking actinomycosis. Actinomycosis should be included in the differential diagnosis in cases with periodontal pain and inflammation that do not respond to nonsurgical treatment for periodontitis. More routine submissions of tissue removed from the oral cavity for biopsies may be beneficial for differential diagnosis.\n\nDifferential Diagnosis of Stuttering for Forensic Purposes\n\nERIC Educational Resources Information Center\n\nSeery, Carol Hubbard\n\n2005-01-01\n\nPurpose: This case study demonstrates the application of an assessment protocol for differential diagnosis of psychogenic stuttering, neurogenic stuttering, developmental stuttering, and malingering.

Tuberculosis (TB) is widely popular in the world and it is difficult to cure. The fundamental treatment is to clear the types of TB pathogens such as Mycobacterium bovis (M. bovis), Mycobacterium tuberculosis (M. tuberculosis). In order to detect and diagnose TB early, we constructed the differential diagnostic method of TB. In this study, we used LAMP for detection of M. bovis, based on amplification of the mpb70 gene which is a unique gene in M. bovis strain. The LAMP assay was able to detect only seven copies of the gene per reaction, whereas for the conventional PCR, it was 70 copies. The LAMP was evaluated for its specificity using six strains of five Mycobacterium species and 18 related non-Mycobacterium microorganism strains as controls. The target three Mycobacterium strains were all amplified, and no cross-reaction was found with 18 non-Mycobacterium microorganism strains. TB was detected by two methods, LAMP and conventional PCR (based on mpb70 gene); the positive rates of the two methods were 9.55 and 7.01Â %, respectively. Our results indicate that the LAMP method should be a potential tool with high convenience, rapidity, sensitivity and specificity for the diagnosis of TB caused by M. bovis. Most importance is that the use of LAMP as diagnostic method in association with diagnostic tests based on mpb70 gene would allow the differentiation between M. bovis and other Mycobacterium in humans or animals. The LAMP method is actually in order to detect human TB, and it can be used for differential diagnosis in this paper.\n\nRapid evaluation by lung-cardiac-inferior vena cava (LCI) integrated ultrasound for differentiating heart failure from pulmonary disease as the cause of acute dyspnea in the emergency setting\n\nPubMed Central\n\n2012-01-01\n\nBackground Rapid and accurate diagnosis and management can be lifesaving for patients with acute dyspnea. However, making a differential diagnosis and selecting early treatment for patients with acute dyspnea in the emergency setting is a clinical challenge that requires complex decision-making in order to achieve hemodynamic balance, improve functional capacity, and decrease mortality. In the present study, we examined the screening potential of rapid evaluation by lung-cardiac-inferior vena cava (LCI) integrated ultrasound for differentiating acute heart failure syndromes (AHFS) from primary pulmonary disease in patients with acute dyspnea in the emergency setting. Methods Between March 2011 and March 2012, 90 consecutive patients (45 women, 78.1âÂ±â9.9âyears) admitted to the emergency room of our hospital for acute dyspnea were enrolled. Within 30âminutes of admission, all patients underwent conventional physical examination, rapid ultrasound (lung-cardiac-inferior vena cava [LCI] integrated ultrasound) examination with a hand-held device, routine laboratory tests, measurement of brain natriuretic peptide, and chest X-ray in the emergency room. Results The final diagnosis was acute dyspnea due to AHFS in 53 patients, acute dyspnea due to pulmonary disease despite a history of heart failure in 18 patients, and acute dyspnea due to pulmonary disease in 19 patients. Lung ultrasound alone showed a sensitivity, specificity, negative predictive value, and positive predictive value of 96.2, 54.0, 90.9, and 75.0%, respectively, for differentiating AHFS from pulmonary disease. On the other hand, LCI integrated ultrasound had a sensitivity, specificity, negative predictive value, and positive predictive value of 94.3, 91.9, 91.9, and 94.3%, respectively. Conclusions Our study demonstrated that rapid evaluation by LCI integrated ultrasound is extremely accurate for differentiating acute dyspnea due to AHFS from that caused by primary pulmonary disease in the\n\n[Pancytopenia and hemolysis--diagnosis, differential diagnosis and therapy of pernicious anemia].\n\nPubMed\n\nMeier, N; Lipp, E; Solenthaler, M\n\n2007-07-29\n\nPernicious anemia and Vitamin B12 deficiency have a wide range of symptoms and are a common finding in the elderly. A 73 year old female is admitted to the hospital because of dyspnea, fatigue and loss of appetite and weight. While previous medical history and physical examination are inconspicuous, laboratory findings show severe pancytopenia with macrocytosis, low reticulocyte count and marked signs of hemolysis. A very low serum level of vitamin B12 and chronic atrophic type A gastritis upon endoscopy with presence of parietal cell antibodies in the serum lead to the diagnosis of pernicious anemia. Complete restitution is achieved by parenteral vitamin B12 substitution. Nowadays, severe pernicious anemia is only rarely seen. The differential diagnosis of pancytopenia (with macrocytic anemia) combined with hemolysis and the essential hints to the diagnosis of pernicious anemia are discussed, and thereby practical aspects including therapy actualized.\n\nClinical and histopathological differential diagnosis of eosinophilic pustular folliculitis.\n\nPubMed\n\nFujiyama, Toshiharu; Tokura, Yoshiki\n\n2013-06-01\n\nEosinophilic pustular folliculitis (EPF) is an inflammatory disease characterized by repeated pruritic follicular papules and pustules arranged in arcuate plaques, and folliculotropic infiltration of eosinophils. The diagnosis of EPF is occasionally difficult and problematic because EPF may share the clinical appearance and histological findings with other diseases. Moreover, EPF has several clinical subtypes, including the classical type, infantile type and immunosuppression-associated type. Because the therapies of EPF are relatively specific as compared to eczematous disorders, accurate diagnosis is essential for the management of EPF. Clinical differential diagnoses include tinea, acne, rosacea, eczematous dermatitis, granuloma faciale, autoimmune annular erythema, infestations and pustular dermatosis. Histologically, cutaneous diseases with eosinophilic infiltrates can be differentially diagnosed. Follicular mucinosis, mycosis fungoides and other cutaneous T-cell lymphomas are the most important differential diagnoses both clinically and histopathologically. It should be kept in mind particularly that the initial lesions of cutaneous T-cell lymphoma resemble EPF.

The significant problem in dermatology and pathology is the differential diagnosis of malignant melanoma and other pigmented skin lesions, especially of dysplastic nevi. Malignant melanoma is the most malignant skin neoplasma, with increasing incidence in various parts of the world. It is hoped that the methods of quantitative pathology, i.e. morphometry, can help objectification of the diagnostic process, since early discovery of melanoma results in 10-year survival rate of 90%. The aim of the study was to use fractal dimension calculated from the perimeter-area relation of the cell nuclei as a tool for the differential diagnosis of pigmented skin lesions. We analyzed hemalaun-eosin stained pathohistological slides of pigmented skin lesions: intradermal naevi (n = 45), dysplastic naevi (n = 47), and malignant melanoma (n = 50). It was found that fractal dimension of malignant melanoma cell nuclei differs significantly from the intradermal and dysplastic naevi (p â¤ 0. 001, Steel-Dwass Multiple Comparison Test). Additionaly, ROC analysis confirmed the value of fractal dimension based evaluation. It is suggested that the estimation of fractal dimension from the perimeter-area relation of the cell nuclei may be a potentially useful morphometric parameter in the medical differential diagnosis of pigmented skin lesions.\n\nPulmonary infections in critical/intensive care - rapid diagnosis and optimizing antimicrobial usage.\n\nPubMed\n\nDouglas, Ivor S\n\n2017-05-01\n\nDiagnosis of pulmonary infection, including hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP) and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) in the critically ill patient remains a common and therapeutically challenging diagnosis with significant attributable morbidity, mortality, and cost. Current clinical approaches to surveillance, early detection and, conventional culture-based microbiology are inadequate for optimal targeted antibiotic treatment and stewardship. Efforts to enhance diagnosis of HAP and VAP and the impact of these novel approaches on rational antimicrobial selection and stewardship are the focus of recent studies reviewed here. Recent consensus guidelines for diagnosis and management of HAP and VAP are relatively silent on the potential role of novel rapid microbiological techniques and reply heavily on conventional culture strategies of noninvasively obtained (including endotracheal aspirate samples). Novel rapid microbiological diagnostics, including nucleic acid amplification, mass spectrometry, and fluorescence microscopy-based technologies are promising approaches for the future. Exhaled breath biomarkers, including measurement of VOC represent a future approach. Further validation of novel diagnostic technology platforms will be required to evaluate their utility for enhancing diagnosis and guiding treatment of pulmonary infections in the critically ill. However, the integration of novel diagnostics for rapid microbial identification, resistance phenotyping, and antibiotic sensitivity testing into usual care practice could significantly transform the care of patients and potentially inform improved targeted antimicrobial selection, de-escalation, and stewardship.\n\nAnosmia: Differential diagnosis, evaluation, and management.\n\nPubMed\n\nScangas, George A; Bleier, Benjamin S\n\n2017-01-01\n\nThe ability to scrutinize our surroundings remains heavily dependent on the sense of smell. From the ability to detect dangerous situations such as fires to the recollection of a fond memory triggered by an odor, the advantages of an intact olfactory system cannot be overstated. Outcomes studies have highlighted the profound negative impact of anosmia and parosmia on the overall quality of life. The National Institute on Deafness and Other Communication Disorders estimates that â¼1.4% of the United States population experiences chronic olfactory dysfunction and smell loss. Efforts have focused on improving both the diagnosis of olfactory dysfunction through olfactory testing and improved reporting of treatment outcomes of olfactory training. The purpose of this article was to review the differential diagnosis, workup, and current treatment strategies of anosmia and smell disorders.\n\nFirst step in the differential diagnosis of folliculitis: cytology.\n\nPubMed\n\nDurdu, Murat; Ilkit, Macit\n\n2013-02-01\n\nFolliculitis is a superficial inflammation of the hair follicles, and can be observed in individuals of any age or race. The incidence of folliculitis is unknown because most patients only consult a doctor in cases of increasing lesions. There are various infectious and non-infectious causes of folliculitis, and the most common causative agent is Staphylococcus aureus. In addition, several Gram-negative bacterial, fungal, parasitic, and viral pathogens can cause follicular papules and pustules. In routine practice, however, these lesions are usually thought to be bacterial. Therefore, topical and/or systemic antibacterial treatment is recommended, but this involves the risk of being misused for months or even years. Cytology, a simple, rapid, inexpensive, and repeatable diagnostic method, can reveal various bacterial, fungal, viral, and parasitic pathogens. This review discusses the use of clinical sampling and staining of cytologic samples for the differential diagnosis of folliculitis, cytologic findings, and the frequency with which dermatologists use cytology to diagnose folliculitis, particularly in the age of molecular biology and more expensive, sophisticated investigations.\n\nDisease of the year: juvenile idiopathic arthritis--differential diagnosis.\n\nPubMed\n\nHu-Torres, Sandra; Foster, C Stephen\n\n2014-02-01\n\nThe purpose of this review is to comprehensively explain the differential diagnosis of juvenile idiopathic arthritis-associated uveitis.

Its frequency and location is analysed in 32,829 subjects of 40 or more years of age, apparently in good health, finding gastric ulcers in 2.98% been unique in 2.3% and multiple in 0.68%. A symptomatic group of 8,765 people of 40 or more years, showed gastric ulcer in 7.11% been unique in 5.18% and multiple in 1.93%. It is also reported the frequency of gastric cancer in both studied groups, which leads to permanently propose the differential diagnostic with benign lesions, underlying by its frequency those of ulcerated type. The value of the gastric biopsy in differential diagnosis represents finally an aid of major importance because its high yield.\n\nDifferential diagnosis of common tremor syndromes\n\nPubMed Central\n\nBhidayasiri, R\n\n2005-01-01\n\nTremor is one of the most common involuntary movement disorders seen in clinical practice. In addition to the detailed history, the differential diagnosis is mainly clinical based on the distinction at rest, postural and intention, activation condition, frequency, and topographical distribution. The causes of tremor are heterogeneous and it can present alone (for example, essential tremor) or as a part of a neurological syndrome (for example, multiple sclerosis). Essential tremor and the tremor of Parkinson's disease are the most common tremors encountered in clinical practice. This article focuses on a practical approach to these different forms of tremor and how to distinguish them clinically.

Diagnosis of meningitis must take into account numerous items of patient history and symptomatology along with regional epidemiology and basic cerebrospinal fluid testing (protein, etc.) to allow the clinician to stratify the likelihood of etiology possibilities and rationally select additional diagnostic tests. Culture is the mainstay for diagnosis in many cases, but technology is evolving to provide more rapid, reliable diagnosis. The cryptococcal antigen lateral flow assay (Immuno-Mycologics) has revolutionized diagnosis of cryptococcosis and automated nucleic acid amplification assays hold promise for improving diagnosis of bacterial and mycobacterial meningitis. This review will focus on a holistic approach to diagnosis of meningitis as well as recent technological advances.

Methods: Totally 124 consecutive patients with suspected oral candidiasis were enrolled from Department of Oral Medicine, Peking University School and Hospital of Stomatology, Beijing, China. Exfoliated cells of oral mucosa and saliva or concentrated oral rinse) obtained from all participants were tested by three rapid smear methods(10% KOH smear, gram-stained smear, Congo red stained smear). The diagnostic efficacy(sensitivity, specificity, Youden's index, likelihood ratio, consistency, predictive value and area under curve(AUC) of each of the above mentioned three methods was assessed by comparing the results with the gold standard(combination of clinical diagnosis, laboratory diagnosis and expert opinion). Results: Gram-stained smear of saliva(or concentrated oral rinse) demonstrated highest sensitivity(82.3%). Test of 10%KOH smear of exfoliated cells showed highest specificity(93.5%). Congo red stained smear of saliva(or concentrated oral rinse) displayed highest diagnostic efficacy(79.0% sensitivity, 80.6% specificity, 0.60 Youden's index, 4.08 positive likelihood ratio, 0.26 negative likelihood ratio, 80% consistency, 80.3% positive predictive value, 79.4% negative predictive value and 0.80 AUC). Conclusions: Test of Congo red stained smear of saliva(or concentrated oral rinse) could be used as a point-of-care tool for the rapid diagnosis of oral candidiasis in clinical practice.

Doing this can be difficult, since various signs and symptoms may not be specific for 1 particular problem or disorder. One initially should formulate a broad differential diagnosis that can be narrowed after analysis of the history and examination. In this article, orofacial pain is categorized as being caused by: intracranial pain, headaches, neuropathic pain, intraoral pain, temporomandibular disorder, cervical pain, pain related to anatomically associated structures, referred pain, or mental illness.

The main aim of the work is criteria definition and evaluation of diagnostic significance of endosonography in the differential diagnosis of benign and malignant common bile duct stenosis. The paper presents a methodology of endoscopic ultrasound and basic criteria for the differential diagnosis of tumors and other lesions of the extrahepatic bile ducts. A comparative analysis of endosonography, ultrasound, CT, MRCP was conducted. The sensitivity of endosonography in determining the nature of the common bile duct stenosis was 97.7%, a specificity 100% and accuracy 98.2%, which is superior to other methods of radiological diagnosis. In comprehensive surgical centers endosonography should be used as a method of specifying the final diagnosis to determine the nature of the common bile duct stenosis, particularly at low constriction location.\n\nPathology and differential diagnosis of chronic, noninfectious gastritis.\n\nPubMed\n\nPolydorides, Alexandros D\n\n2014-03-01\n\nThe histologic finding of chronic inflammation in an endoscopic mucosal biopsy of the stomach (chronic gastritis) is very common and usually reflects the presence of Helicobacter pylori infection. However, infectious organisms are not always present in biopsy material, and some cases of chronic gastritis do not result from H. pylori infection. Thus, the differential diagnosis of this finding is an important one for pathologists to keep in mind. This review presents the three most common and clinically significant causes of chronic, noninfectious gastritis, namely, autoimmune atrophic gastritis, lymphocytic gastritis, and gastric involvement in the setting of inflammatory bowel disease, especially Crohn disease. For each entity, a brief discussion of its etiology and pathogenesis, a review of the clinical and endoscopic features, and a description of the microscopic findings are presented in the context of the differential diagnosis of chronic gastritis with emphasis on helpful histopathologic hints and long-term sequelae.

A tiny prefoveal floater, only detectable by OCT, was found responsible for the symptoms in three patients, one of whom had been referred with unilateral delayed visual evoked potentials. This case series suggests that with increased use of OCT in routine clinical care, entoptic phenomena can be demonstrated as a relevant differential diagnosis to optic neuritis. Patients should be explained the benign nature of their symptoms.\n\nThe differential diagnosis of ritual abuse allegations.\n\nPubMed\n\nBernet, W; Chang, D K\n\n1997-01-01\n\nBecause psychiatrists do not have a consistent way to classify and define the forms of child abuse that may be mistaken for ritual abuse, the objective of this paper is to create a comprehensive differential diagnosis of allegations of ritual abuse. The authors reviewed 60 articles, chapters, and books that contained allegations of ritual abuse or behaviors that might be mistaken for ritual abuse, that were made by patients or caretakers. This paper clarifies the behaviors that represent or may be mistaken for ritual abuse: Cult-based ritual abuse, pseudoritualistic abuse, activities by organized satanic groups, repetitive psychopathological abuse, sexual abuse by pedophiles, child pornography portraying ritual abuse, distorted memory, false memory, false report due to a severe mental disorder, pseudologia phantastica, adolescent behavior simulating ritual abuse, epidemic hysteria, deliberate lying, and hoaxes. The differential diagnosis of allegations of ritual abuse is important in both clinical and forensic psychiatry. In some cases, it will not be possible to tell whether a particular allegation is factual or what the underlying mental processes are. It is important to separate the role of the mental health professional as therapist from the role as an expert witness in court.\n\nThe Differential Diagnosis of Functional Symptoms in Adolescence.\n\nERIC Educational Resources Information Center\n\nSilber, Thomas J.\n\n1982-01-01\n\nFunctional complaints constitute the major reason why adolescents visit the physician's office.

Proposes a definition of functional disorders, sets forth a classification of the differential diagnosis of these disorders and suggests techniques for their management.â¦\n\n[Differential diagnosis of febrile exanthema].\n\nPubMed\n\nAramÄ, St S; Anca, Ioana Alina; Munteanu, Daniela-Ioana; AramÄ, Victoria; Hristea, Adriana; Moroti, Ruxandra; Ion, Daniela Adriana\n\n2007-01-01\n\nFebrile exanthema (FE) is an extremely polymorphous clinical entity, frequently seen in daily clinical practice. FE is characterized by diffuse rash and fever. FE is classified in 4 types, depending on the primary skin lesion: macular, maculopapular, vesicular, and bullous exanthema. It is of infectious and non-infectious cause. Among the infectious causes the most frequent is the viral one. FE may affect all ages, but especially children and young people. Usually, FE raises important issues of differential diagnosis, because its clinical and etiological complexity. To decide the most appropriate therapeutic and prophylactic measures for FE, it is important to know the clinical criteria and the specific diagnostic methods.\n\nContrast-Enhanced Ultrasonography in Differential Diagnosis of Benign and Malignant Ovarian Tumors\n\nPubMed Central\n\nQiao, Jing-Jing; Yu, Jing; Yu, Zhe; Li, Na; Song, Chen; Li, Man\n\n2015-01-01\n\nObjective To evaluate the accuracy of contrast-enhanced ultrasonography (CEUS) in differential diagnosis of benign and malignant ovarian tumors. Methods The scientific literature databases PubMed, Cochrane Library and CNKI were comprehensively searched for studies relevant to the use of CEUS technique for differential diagnosis of benign and malignant ovarian cancer. Pooled summary statistics for specificity (Spe), sensitivity (Sen), positive and negative likelihood ratios (LR+/LRâ), and diagnostic odds ratio (DOR) and their 95%CIs were calculated. Software for statistical analysis included STATA version 12.0 (Stata Corp, College Station, TX, USA) and Meta-Disc version 1.4 (Universidad Complutense, Madrid, Spain). Results Following a stringent selection process, seven high quality clinical trials were found suitable for inclusion in the present meta-analysis. The 7 studies contained a combined total of 375 ovarian cancer patients (198 malignant and 177 benign). Statistical analysis revealed that CEUS was associated with the following performance measures in differential diagnosis of ovarian tumors: pooled Sen was 0.96 (95%CI = 0.92â¼0.98); the summary Spe was 0.91 (95%CI = 0.86â¼0.94); the pooled LR+ was 10.63 (95%CI = 6.59â¼17.17); the pooled LRâ was 0.04 (95%CI = 0.02â¼0.09); and the pooled DOR was 241.04 (95% CI = 92.61â¼627.37). The area under the SROC curve was 0.98 (95% CI = 0.20â¼1.00). Lastly, publication bias was not detected (t = â0.52, P = 0.626) in the meta-analysis. Conclusions Our results revealed the high clinical value of CEUS in differential diagnosis of benign and malignant ovarian tumors. Further, CEUS may also prove to be useful in differential diagnosis at early stages of this disease.

Dolores; MÃ²dol, Josep M.; ArmÃ©star, Fernando; Blyn, Lawrence B.; Cummins, Lendell L.; Ausina, Vicente; MartrÃ³, Elisa\n\n2013-01-01\n\nAchieving a rapid microbiological diagnosis is crucial for decreasing morbidity and mortality of patients with a bloodstream infection, as it leads to the administration of an appropriate empiric antimicrobial therapy. Molecular methods may offer a rapid alternative to conventional microbiological diagnosis involving blood culture. In this study, the performance of a new technology that uses broad-spectrum PCR coupled with mass spectrometry (PCR/ESI-MS) was evaluated for the detection of microorganisms directly from whole blood. A total of 247 whole blood samples and paired blood cultures were prospectively obtained from 175 patients with a suspicion of sepsis. Both sample types were analyzed using the PCR/ESI-MS technology, and the results were compared with those obtained by conventional identification methods. The overall agreement between conventional methods and PCR/ESI-MS performed in blood culture aliquots was 94.2% with 96.8% sensitivity and 98.5% specificity for the molecular method. When comparing conventional methods with PCR/ESI-MS performed in whole blood specimens, the overall agreement was 77.1% with 50% sensitivity and 93.8% specificity for the molecular method. Interestingly, the PCR/ESI-MS technology led to the additional identification of 13 pathogens that were not found by conventional methods. Using the PCR/ESI-MS technology the microbiological diagnosis of bloodstream infections could be anticipated in about half of the patients in our setting, including a small but significant proportion of patients newly diagnosed. Thus, this promising technology could be very useful for the rapid diagnosis of sepsis in combination with traditional methods.

The manual medical diagnosis can make a valuable contribution in such cases for determination of structural and functional pathology. Early application of manual medical therapies seems to be effective for peracute complaints. The mobilization of restrictions of the pelvic visceral attachments should be included. In the following review manual medical syndromes are presented that summarize the findings from the musculoskeletal and visceral system. This is intended to facilitate the primary differential diagnostic evaluation, as well as treatment planning. The combination with osteopathic methods is very profitable. A necessary specialist differential diagnosis remains essential.\n\nOptical coherence tomography in differential diagnosis of skin pathology\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nGladkova, Natalia D.; Petrova, Galina P.; Derpaluk, Elena; Nikulin, Nikolai K.; Snopova, Ludmila; Chumakov, Yuri; Feldchtein, Felix I.; Gelikonov, Valentin M.; Gelikonov, Grigory V.; Kuranov, Roman V.\n\n2000-05-01\n\nThe capabilities of optical coherence tomography (OCT) for imaging in vivo of optical patterns of pathomorphological processes in the skin and use of their optical patterns in clinical practice for differential diagnosis of dermatoses are presented. Images of skin tissue 0.8 - 1.5 mm deep were acquired with a resolution of 5, 12 and 20 micrometer using three compact fiber OCT devices developed at the Institute of Applied Physics RAS. The acquisition time of images of skin regions 2 - 6 mm in length was 2 - 4 s. The OCT capabilities were analyzed based on the study of 50 patients with different dermatoses. OCT images were interpreted by comparing with parallel histology. It is shown that OCT can detect in vivo optical patterns of morphological alterations in such general papulous dermatoses as lichen ruber planus and psoriasis, a capability that can be used in differential diagnosis of these diseases. Most informative are OCT images obtained with a resolution of 5 micrometer. The results of our study demonstrate the practical importance of OCT imaging for diagnosis of different dermatoses. OCT is noninvasive and, therefore, makes it possible to perform frequent multifocal examination of skin without any adverse effects.\n\nEvaluation of the OnSite (Pf/Pan) rapid diagnostic test for diagnosis of clinical malaria\n\nPubMed Central\n\n2012-01-01\n\nBackground Accurate diagnosis of malaria is an essential prerequisite for proper treatment and drug resistance monitoring. Microscopy is considered the gold standard for malaria diagnosis but has limitations. ELISA, PCR, and Real Time PCR are also used to diagnose malaria in reference laboratories, although their application at the field level is currently not feasible. Rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs) however, have been brought into field operation and widely adopted in recent days. This study evaluates OnSite (Pf/Pan) antigen test, a new RDT introduced by CTK Biotech Inc, USA for malaria diagnosis in a reference setting. Methods Blood samples were collected from febrile patients referred for malaria diagnosis by clinicians. Subjects were included in this study from two different Upazila Health Complexes (UHCs) situated in two malaria endemic districts of Bangladesh. Microscopy and nested PCR were considered the gold standard in this study. OnSite (Pf/Pan) RDT was performed on preserved whole blood samples. Results In total, 372 febrile subjects were included in this study. Of these subjects, 229 (61.6%) tested positive for Plasmodium infection detected by microscopy and nested PCR. OnSite (Pf/Pan) RDT was 94.2% sensitive (95% CI, 89.3-97.3) and 99.5% specific (95% CI, 97.4-00.0) for Plasmodium falciparum diagnosis and 97.3% sensitive (95% CI, 90.5-99.7) and 98.7% specific (95% CI, 96.6-99.6) for Plasmodium vivax diagnosis. Sensitivity varied with differential parasite count for both P. falciparum and P. vivax. The highest sensitivity was observed in febrile patients with parasitaemia that ranged from 501â1,000 parasites/Î¼L regardless of the Plasmodium species. Conclusion The new OnSite (Pf/Pan) RDT is both sensitive and specific for symptomatic malaria diagnosis in standard laboratory conditions.

A rare differential diagnosis of rheumatic diseases].\n\nPubMed\n\nHofheinz, K; Ganzleben, I; Schliep, S; Wacker, J; Schett, G; Manger, B\n\n2016-03-01\n\nIn December 2014 a patient presented to our clinic with the clinical symptoms of vasculitis. However, treatment with glucocorticoids did not lead to any improvement; therefore, the differential diagnostics were extended to other indications and ultimately led to the diagnosis of scurvy. This article describes the clinical picture of scurvy and its relationship to rheumatic diseases based on a clinical case and additional information from the literature. Differences and similarities with important rheumatological disease symptoms are presented. Scurvy is a rare hypovitaminosis disease which can be manifested in different forms. In addition to vasculitis the symptoms can also resemble arthritis and hemarthrosis is a typical finding. These symptoms can be accompanied by unspecific manifestations, such as muscle pain and due to impaired collagen synthesis characteristic features, such as corkscrew hair can be observed. The causal therapy of scurvy is substitution of ascorbic acid. Scurvy is a rare differential diagnosis in the context of rheumatic diseases. The indications for scurvy can be a lack of response to immunosuppressive and immunomodulatory drugs as well as individual symptoms, such as corkscrew hair.\n\nHIV associated eosinophilic folliculitis--differential diagnosis and management\n\nPubMed Central\n\nSimpson-Dent, S.; Fearfield, L. A.; Staughton, R. C.\n\n1999-01-01\n\nEosinophilic folliculitis (EF) is a chronic, intensely pruritic condition of unknown pathogenesis that causes marked morbidity in those HIV patients whom it affects. There is a wide differential diagnosis of itchy skin conditions in HIV which are amenable to different treatments. It is therefore essential to take a biopsy of each suspected case and examine multiple sections of the biopsy to confirm or refute a diagnosis of EF. Treatment of EF can be difficult but we hope that by suggesting a rational approach to this and considering possible therapeutic options more patients may be helped with this troublesome dermatosis. â¨â¨â¨ PMID:10616350\n\n[Desmoplastic fibroma.

A Lebanese tertiary care center experience.\n\nPubMed\n\nItani, Lina Y; Cherry, Mohamad A; Araj, George F\n\n2005-01-01\n\nRapid detection of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB), especially multidrug-resistant strains, is of importance for prompt clinical management and initiation of public health control measures. Culture remains the \"gold\" standard in the confirmatory laboratory diagnosis of mycobacterial infections. The reliability of the automated radiometric BACTEC 460 TB (BACTEC) system for the rapid detection of mycobacteria in clinical specimens was evaluated and compared to the conventional culture on Lowenstein-Jensen (LJ) medium. All clinical specimens submitted for mycobacterial culture were processed and simultaneously cultured on both BACTEC broth medium and LJ solid medium. Acid-fast bacilli (AFB) smears were also performed on the sediments. Differentiation of mycobacterial isolates as MTB or Mycobacterium sp. other than tuberculosis (MOTT) was based on the BACTEC NAP test. All positive culture findings recovered between January 1997 and December 2003 were analyzed in this study. A total of 3300 specimens were tested of which 355 (10.7%) yielded positive cultures consisting of 233 (65.6%) MTB and 122 (34.4%) MOTT. The percentages of AFB smear-positive were 45% and 49% in clinical specimens yielding MTB & MOTT, respectively. Though several types of specimens were cultured, most isolates (72% of MTB & 91% of MOTT) were recovered from respiratory specimens. Overall, the BACTEC showed significantly higher mycobacteria recovery rate (91%) than LJ (77%). In terms of times to detection, BACTEC showed significantly shorter detection time of isolates than LJ for the overall (mean 9.6 days for BACTEC vs. 22.8 days for LJ) and for each category of AFB smear finding. The detection time is shortened for BACTEC with the increasing grade of smear positivity. BACTEC is substantially more sensitive, efficient and rapid than LJ in the laboratory diagnosis of mycobacterial infections. This system also provides rapid differentiation of MTB from MOTT and susceptibility test results on MTB\n\nAdvances in rapid diagnosis of tuberculosis disease and anti-tuberculous drug resistance.\n\nPubMed\n\nAlcaide, Fernando; Coll, Pere\n\n2011-03-01\n\nRapid diagnosis of tuberculosis (TB) and multidrug-resistant (resistance to at least rifampin and isoniazid) Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MDR-TB) is one of the cornerstones for global TB control as it allows early epidemiological and therapeutic interventions. The slow growth of the tubercle bacillus is the greatest obstacle to rapid diagnosis of the disease. However, considerable progress has recently been made in developing novel diagnostic tools, especially molecular methods (commercial and 'in-house'), for direct detection in clinical specimens. These methods, based on nucleic acid amplification (NAA) of different targets, aim to identify the M. tuberculosis complex and detect the specific chromosome mutations that are most frequently associated with phenotypic resistance to multiple drugs. In general, commercial methods are recommended since they have a better level of standardization, reproducibility and automation. Although some aspects such as cost-efficiency and the appropriate setting for the implementation of these techniques are not yet well established, organizations such as the WHO are strongly supporting the implementation and universal use of these new molecular methods. This chapter summarizes current knowledge and the available molecular methods for rapid diagnosis of TB and anti-tuberculous drug resistance in clinical microbiology laboratories.

Mutation in calcium sensing receptor gene (CaSR) clinically manifests as familial hypocalciuric hypercalcemia (FHH) or as the much more serious neonatal hyperparathyreosis. Hypercalciuric hypocalcemia is extremely rare. Prognosis for the most frequent mutations in the CaSR gene FHH is considered benign; nevertheless, if overlooked it can lead to an incorrect diagnosis of primary hyperparathyreosis, which has a fundamentally different prognosis and treatment. Familial hypophosphatemia sometimes occurs as hereditary rickets, which is a consequence of insufficient production of vitamin D-hormone or abnormal function of vitamin D receptors (VDR). The disease manifests as X-linked dominant hypophosphatemic rickets or autosomal dominant hypophosphatemic rickets. Autosomal recessive form is very rare. Oncogenic hypophosphatemia should be excluded in differential diagnosis. In this review the issues of pathogenesis, differential diagnosis and treatment of FHH and hypophosphatemic rickets are discussed.\n\nRapid diagnosis and differentiation of microbial pathogens in otitis media with a combined Raman spectroscopy and low-coherence interferometry probe: toward in vivo implementation.\n\nPubMed\n\nZhao, Youbo; Monroy, Guillermo L; You, Sixian; Shelton, Ryan L; Nolan, Ryan M; Tu, Haohua; Chaney, Eric J; Boppart, Stephen A\n\n2016-10-01\n\nWe investigate and demonstrate the feasibility of using a combined Raman scattering (RS) spectroscopy and low-coherence interferometry (LCI) probe to differentiate microbial pathogens and improve our diagnostic ability of ear infections [otitis media (OM)]. While the RS probe provides noninvasive molecular information to identify and differentiate infectious microorganisms, the LCI probe helps to identify depth-resolved structural information as well as to guide and monitor positioning of the Raman spectroscopy beam for relatively longer signal acquisition times. A series of phantom studies, including the use of human middle ear effusion samples, were performed to mimic the conditions of in vivo investigations. These were also conducted to validate the feasibility of using this combined RS/LCI probe for point-of-care diagnosis of the infectious pathogen(s) in OM patients. This work establishes important parameters for future in vivo investigations of fast and accurate determination and diagnosis of infectious microorganisms in OM patients, potentially improving the efficacy and outcome of OM treatments, and importantly reducing the misuse of antibiotics in the presence of viral infections.\n\nRapid diagnosis and differentiation of microbial pathogens in otitis media with a combined Raman spectroscopy and low-coherence interferometry probe: toward in vivo implementation\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System ("
