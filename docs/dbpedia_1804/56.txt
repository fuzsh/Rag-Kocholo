From 28 September to 12 October 2019 the Auditorium Giovanni Arvedi at the Museo del Violino will welcome some of the most acclaimed violinists from around the world for their debut performances at STRADIVARIfestival. This is, perhaps, to be expected from an event named after the greatest violin maker the world has ever seen, and founded essentially to promote the instrument that symbolises Cremona. But this year the festival will also involve four renowned pianists, albeit, naturally, in concerts that also feature a significant number of stringed instruments. The seventh STRADIVARIfestival sees big names playing some of the best-loved concertos in the repertoire and directing and performing Classical and Romantic symphonic and chamber pieces. Violinists including Giuliano Carmignola, Daniel Hope and Guido Rimonda will play on extraordinary masterpieces of classical Cremonese violin making, each with their own fascinating voice and story. Rimonda’s ‘Leclair’ Stradivari of 1721 (also known as ‘Le noir’), for example, was once owned by Jean-Marie Leclair, the French violinist and composer who was murdered in 1764. The pianists, including Krystian Zimerman, Alexander Lonquich, Ramin Bahrami and Uri Caine, showcase a range of different styles and characteristics, with Caine taking on the highly original project of transcribing symphonic scores by Wagner for a café concert-style ensemble.
