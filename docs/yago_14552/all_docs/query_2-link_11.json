        "text": "Observations on Architectural Styles, Part 1\n\nLake of the Isles Hike\n\nAssembled by\n\nLawrence A. Martin\n\nWebpage Creation: April 10, 2003\n\nGeneral.\n\nThe Lake of the Isles was named for its islands (now two, but formerly four, as mapped in the Andreas Atlas in 1874.) The island to the north is called Mike's Island, and the island to the south is Raspberry Island. The other two were located in a marshy area to the south that has now been filled in, so that they are now part of the mainland. They were jointly called Maple Islands. The lake was originally a large wetland. Extensive dredging occurred during the period 1889-1911 to create the lake. The access to Lake Calhoun was created in 1911. The lake covers 102 acres, with 2.86 miles of shoreline. The maximum depth of the lake is 54 feet. The sport fish community in the lake consists of bluegill, black crappie, green sunfish, pumpkinseed, hybrid sunfish, largemouth bass, northern pike, tiger muskellunge, walleye, and yellow perch. Lake of the Isles has been stocked every third year with tiger muskellunge since 1994. Northern pike, walleye, and largemouth bass were low in abundance. Northern pike size was good. Bowfin (dogfish,) black bullheads, common carp, and white suckers are also located in the lake.\n\nNearby Lake Calhoun was originally known as \"Mde Mdoza\" or \"Lake of the Loons.\" It was renamed by Army surveyors sent by then Secretary of War, John C. Calhoun, to map the western lands in 1817. John Caldwell Calhoun was also the Vice-President of the United States from 1825 to 1832. Missionaries Samuel Pond and Gideon Pond arrived in 1834 on the eastern shore of the marshy lake at the large village \"Marh'piya Wicasta,\" the village of Dakota chief Cloud Man. In 1911, the Park Board dug the channel linking Lake Calhoun, Lake of the Isles, and Cedar Lake.\n\nThe Kenwood section of Minneapolis, in which Lake of the Isles is located, was originally a suburb, and today is one of the most affluent neighborhoods in the city.\n\nSome interesting examples of Prairie Style architecture and the designs of architect William Gray Purcell also are located on Lake of the Isles Parkway and on nearby streets.\n\nAn 1874 city map indicates that only six people owned the property around Lake of the Isles, with John Green owning the land on the north end of the lake, __?__ Reed and __?__ Goodrich owning the land on the northeast portion of the lake, R. P. Purcell owning the land on the southeast portion of the lake, Thomas Haleran owning the land on the west portion of the lake, __?__ Barber owning the land on the northwest portion of the lake, and S. H. Smith owning the land on the north northwestern portion of the lake.\n\nSpecific Structures.

W. Backus & Company, sold the circular sawmill, rated at one million feet per season, and bought two other plants that in 1892 produced 76 million feet. In 1893, a fire that swept a large part of the sawmill district destroyed both of the Backus plants along with 60 million feet of lumber. The Backus firm survived and rebounded the following year with the purchase of a large North Minneapolis mill from the C. A. Pillsbury interests. Under Backus' leadership, five major lumber companies then formed a syndicate to acquire extensive timberlands in an area north of Brainerd, Minnesota, to assure a supply for their mills. Along with the timber purchase came plans for a railroad to haul the logs to the mills, the Minnesota & International Railway, which reached International Falls, Minnesota, in 1907. Some 60 miles of track were laid northward from Brainerd, Minnesota, in 1894. In 1899, Backus acquired a partner, William F. Brooks (1863-1928,) a mechanical engineer formerly associated with one of Backus' competitors. The new firm was incorporated in 1902 under the name Backus-Brooks Company. It became the parent company for numerous subsidiaries that developed International Falls, Minnesota, Fort Frances, Ontario, and Kenora, Ontario. Brooks moved to Minneapolis in 1875, was educated in the Minneapolis public school system, graduated from the Worcester Institute of Technology, Worcester, Massachusetts, in 1884, was treasurer and carried numerous executive responsibilities in the Backus-Brooks Company, married Caroline Langdon, was a Republican, was elected in 1918 to represent his Minneapolis district (District 31) in the State Senate, and served until his death. Backus-Brooks sawmill operations in Minneapolis continued until 1906, when the remaining mill was sold. In the middle 1920's, Backus was a director of the Northern Pacific RailRoad, the Northwest National Bank of Minneapolis, and several other firms in addition to being president of the Backus-Brooks Companhy. Backus built the Koochiching Falls, Minnesota, dam between 1905 and 1910, with delays in acquiring riparian rights on the international boundary waterway, and the Falls paper mill. The International Lumber Company sawmill was erected on the riverfront just east of the Falls, and it started up in 1911, with its peak in 1917, when it sawed the timber harvest of 23 logging camps in Koochiching, Itasca and St. Louis counties. Backus-owned lumber operations in the 1920's included the Spooner, Minnesota, mill, which Backus acquired from a Shevlin firm. Backus organized the Minnesota, Dakota & Western Railway, a common carrier connecting with the Minnesota & International Railway at the Falls and the Duluth, Winnipeg & Pacific Railway at Ranier Junction, Minnesota. Backus also began manufacturing insulation from paper mill byproducts, called Universal Insulite. Backus built a paper and insulation mill in Karhula, Finland, in 1930. Backus purchased the Keewatin Lumber Company in 1906, acquired the Norman dam in 1913, acquired the Kenora, Ontario, municipal dam in 1920, built the Fort Frances, Ontario, paper mill in 1912-1914, built the International bridge across the Rainy River in 1912, built the Kenora pulp and newsprint mill in the 1920's, became affiliated with the Great Lakes Paper Company and built a large, modern mill at Fort William (mergered with Port Arthur and renamed Thunder Bay,) Ontario. Backus' plans for hydro-electric development in the Rainy Lake watershed, with a planned series of power and storage dams stretching eastward from Lac La Croix to increase and stabilize power generation at Koochiching dam and prevent flooding, were blocked by the Quetico-Superior Council, formed in 1928 by Ernest C. Oberholtzer, a Rainy Lake resident and dedicated conservationist, Frank Hubacheck of Chicago, Sigurd Olson of Ely, and other wilderness advocates, and by the passage of the Shipstead-Nolan Act in 1930, prohibiting further power developments in the Superior National Forest in Minnesota. Edward W. Backus was a partner in E. W. Backus & Company from 1886 until 1894, was a partner in E. W. Backus Lumber Company from 1894 until 1900, was the president of Backus-Brooks Company, was the president of the Koochiching Company, was the president of the First National Bank of International Falls, Minnesota, was the president of the Rainy River Improvement Company, was the president of the Columbia Gold Mining Company, was the president of Keewatin Lumber Company, was a member of the board of directors of the Rainy River Lumber Company, was a member of the board of directors of the Northwestern National Bank of Minneapolis, was a member of the board of directors of the Minnesota & International Railway Company, was a member of the Minnesota Club, was a member of the Lafayette Club, was a member of the Minikhada Club of Minneapolis, was a Republican, and was a presidential elector from Minnesota in 1904. In 1907, Edward W. Backus resided at 75 Oak Grove Street. In 1931, the Minnesota & Ontario Paper Company, the principal Backus company, was forced into receivership after defaulting on a large obligation. In the subsequent reorganization of the company, Backus, as the principal common stock owner, lost an estimated $50 million. Backus died of a heart attack in New York. Backus' biographers were not always not entirely complimentary of him and his approach, indicating that he could be brutal, remorseless, ruthless, and not always ethical at times and at other times that he was exactly the opposite. E. W. Backus married Elizabeth Horr (1862-1956) and the couple had two sons, Edward Raymond Backus ( -1912,) who graduated with honors from Yale University before he lost his life in a hunting accident on Rainy Lake, and Seymour W. Backus, who joined the Backus-Brooks organization in 1916 and became vice president with various executive responsibilities at the Minneapolis headquarters and for the mill towns. Elizabeth S. \"Lizzie\" Horr, the daughter of Augustus E. Horr (1838- ) and Emily Elizabeth Leavitt Horr (1841- ,) was born in Maine, married Edward Wellington Backus in Minnesota, died in Minnesota, and was buried in Lakewood Cemetery. Their son, Seymour W. Backus ( -1936,) married Ruth Towle. Backus' Rainy Lake dam proposal would have affected 14,500 square miles, an area larger than Massachusetts, Connecticut and Rhode Island combined, and it contained within it the Superior National Forest and the areas that were to become Voyageurs National Park, the Quetico Provincial Park, and the Boundary Waters Canoe Area Wilderness. Water levels would be raised significantly above natural. It was estimated that Little Vermilion Lake would be raised by 80 feet, Loon Lake would be raised by 33 feet, Lac La Croix Lake would be raised by 16 feet, and Lake Saganaga and Crooked Lake would be raised by 15 feet. Backus had a habit with the previously constructed Rainy River dam of raising and lowering the lake's water level to maximize his mill's production and those tactics had already destroyed a significant amount of property and natural features that lined the lake. Backus' paper mills were the world's second-largest in terms of total production in the 1920's. Backus attempted to thwart conservation efforts by using his influence to affect the content of newspaper editorials, stall legislative bills in committee and influence legislators. Seymour Backus owned preferred stock in the St. Louis & San Francisco RailRoad in 1923. Edward Backus died in his rooms at the Vanderbilt Hotel in New York City. Artist Brian Romangnoli created the Edward Wellington Backus Mural, the first heritage mural in Fort Frances, Ontario, that depicts industrialist E. W. Backus. Backus, Minnesota, a city in Cass County, in the Brainerd metro area, latitude 46.820N and longitude -94.516W, had an estimated population of 317 in 2003, was named for Edward W. Backus. Edward W. Backus resided at 75 Oak Grove Street and was associated with the Koochiching Realty Company, the Minnesota & Ontario Power Company, and the International Lumber Company according to the 1917 city directory.

The Northwestern Knitting Company was founded in 1886 by George D. Munsing, Edward Tuttle, and Frank Page, graduates of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, who developed a new textile application that involved the plating of silk and wool and eliminated the itch of wool. During the 1890's, they advertised women's underwear in The Ladies' Home Journal, a scandalous marketing strategy in an age when underwear was viewed as an \"unmentionable,\" and the Company became a major player in the lingerie business. In 1891, the Northwestern Knitting Company introduced the one-piece, full-length union suit, also known as \"long johns.\" In 1897, a dye department was added and the public was offered a choice of underwear colors. In 1912, the Northwestern Knitting Company acquired the Vassar Swiss Underwear Company, a high-priced full-fashioned underwear manufacturer. Clinton Morrison, son of Minneapolis' first mayor, Dorilus Morrison, was the president of the company before his death in 1913, when he was succeeded by Frederick Moody Stowell, an employee of the company since 1890. By 1914, Page & Tuttle's enterprise employed 1,700 and was the largest employer of women in Minnesota. During World War I, the Northwestern Knitting Company supplied nearly all the union suits worn by the U.S. armed forces. In 1919, Page & Tuttle's Northwestern Knitting Company changed its name to The Munsingwear Corporation. In 1923, Munsingwear became the first Minnesota company to be listed on the New York Stock Exchange and introduced silk hosiery and artificial silk (rayon) hosiery in stocking sizes that accounted for leg shape as well as length. In 1932, the Company introduced elastic girdles. The company acquired Rollins Hosiery Mills, Inc. in 1945. In 1947, nylon tricot and men's stretch briefs were introduced. In 1955, Munsingwear introduced the knit golf shirt, with the famous Penguin® emblem. In 1958, the Company introduced Slenderella hosiery for women. Munsingwear was acquired in 1996 by Supreme International. In the late 1990's, Munsingwear became PremiumWear, Inc. In mid-2000, PremiumWear, Inc. became a wholly owned subsidiary of New England Business Service, Inc. In 2005, the Company was acquired by The John Forsyth Shirt Company LTD.

Emery Mapes, George Bull ( -1897) and George Clifford, who owned a small flour mill, the Diamond Flour Mill, in Grand Forks, North Dakota, fought successfully to keep their business alive during the 1893 panic, and were approached by either Frank Amidon or Tom Amidon, the plant's head miller, in 1895 to pitch a \"breakfast porridge\" that he had developed from the \"middlings,\" the part of wheat that produces the highest-grade flour, that he had been using at home, and that he thought might be packaged and marketed to others. They called the cereal \"Cream of Wheat\" and the name stuck. When samples were sent to New York City, the product flourished and demand for Cream of Wheat was so great that the milling company, then the North Dakota Milling Company, outgrew its Grand Forks, North Dakota, plant by 1897. The company then moved to Minneapolis, which offered the best source of necessary raw material and was a good shipping point with advantageous freight rates, and renamed itself the Cream of Wheat Mill. In 1929, the company was reorganized as The Cream of Wheat Corporation and its stock listed on the New York Stock Exchange.

Annie Ziegler was a long time companion of Catherine Gray. The Catherine Gray house, Purcell's first built example of a progressive structure, was to be a home for both of them. It was also an important work for the fledgling progressive architecture firm of Purcell and Feick. Purcell's future partner, George Elmslie, advised the young architect during the design process. The rectangular, two-story structure closely resembled Frank Lloyd Wright's 1907 Ladies' Home Journal design for a \"Fireproof House for $5000.\" Purcell defined and varied the monolithic exterior by using brick on the first floor and by using natural-colored stucco on the second floor. The firm incorporated progressive features in the building, such as casement windows and an asymmetrical entry, that eventually became standard in the subsequent homes it designed. A partially open floor plan and a system of interior wood trim throughout the rooms unified the interior. The house has been altered significantly over the years, including the removal in 1918 of a screened pavilion to the south. Annie M. Ziegler ( -1953) died in Hennepin County. The 1909 city directory indicates that William G. Purcell, associated with Purcell & Feick, resided at 2311 Humboldt Avenue South and the architectural firm with George Feick, Jr., was located at the New York Life Building. A recent owner was Margaret Von Blon Otis. Margaret Von Blon Wurtele, a 1967 Smith College graduate, suffered the death of her 22-year-old son, Philip J. Otis, in a 1995 climbing accident during a rescue attempt in Mount Rainier Park and now divides her time between Minneapolis and California's Napa Valley. Margaret Wurtele is the wife of Angus Wurtele and is the daughter of Joanne Von Blon. The Wurteles donated a \"significant portion\" of the $1.7 million sale price to MPR's capital campaign. The Wurteles are longtime supporters of MPR, the Guthrie Theater, and the Walker Art Center, among other local arts organizations. The house was renovated, with new furniture, rugs, window treatments, paint, plants and outdoor furniture with donations from Valspar, Schneiderman's Furniture and other local businesses, but no structural changes, and was put on the market as part of MPR's new capital fund-raising campaign. Angus Wurtele, a 1956 graduate of Yale University, became Valspar's CEO after the death of his father, Valentine Wurtele, when Angus Wertle was 27. Valspar is the successor to the Valentine & Company, an early American varnish maker that made its reputation manufacturing the varnish for the spars of clipper ships. The Valspar Corporation is the fifth largest North American manufacturer of paints and coatings. C.

The Legislature finally established Frontenac Park in 1957, but actual development did not begin until 1964 when a road was built to the top of Garrard Bluff and camping and picnicking facilities were constructed. Frontenac was classified under the 1975 Outdoor Recreation Act (ORA) as a natural state park, which means that the land should be preserved for biological values rather than recreational development. The state park, which now encompasses approximately 2,600 acres, was established in 1957. The initial proposal for a state park at Frontenac was presented to legislative committees in the mid-1930s. This proposal suggested establishing a state park so that a Civilian Conservation Corps camp could be located within it. The proposal was rejected because it was decided that Goodhue County did not have enough relief labor available to warrant a CCC camp. In 1954, the Frontenac State Park Association was formed to lobby for a state park. The first bill was presented to the legislature in 1955, but met with citizen opposition. In its continuing pursuit of a state park, the Frontenac State Park Association purchased the 160-acre Munro Estate in 1955. The Daily Market Record was published from 1880 to 1984. George D. Rogers ( -1984) also was the author of the article \"History of flour manufacture in Minnesota\" in the Collections of the Minnesota Historical Society, Volume 10, part 1, published in St. Paul in 1905.
