        "text": "History of Thomas Harris\n\nTheir story begins far away from Walton County, Georgia…\n\nBy the year 1774, the resentment of British rule over the colonies in the “new world” drew many men together. This was a rebellion unlike any the world had ever seen. It was planned by prosperous, educated, free thinking men such as George Washington, a Virginia plantation owner who had the most military experience of the rebel colonials; Samuel Adams of Massachusetts, an outspoken activist and leader of the Boston Tea Party in 1773; Thomas Paine, a Briton whose principles helped to shape the Declaration of Independence; Virginia’s Thomas Jefferson, who wrote the Declaration of Independence in three weeks. Jefferson was aided by John Adams of Massachusetts, a lawyer who would become the nation’s second President.\n\nWhen they crafted the Declaration of Independence, it was a vision of each person’s individual claim to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.\n\nDuring the the time of the birth of our nation, the call for colonial patriots to free themselves from ties to Great Britain brought people from near and far to serve the Continental Army under General George Washington. One of these patriots was William Harrris’ Revolutionary War grandfather, Thomas Harris, of Orange County, Virginia. He was married to Sabra Harris, and had six children: Lindsey, Thomas, John, Lewis, Betty and Mary. John Harris, third child born in 1768, was the father of William Harris. Thomas Harris served in the Revolutionary War in Taylor’s Virginia Regiment, as a Corporal in Captain Garland Burnley’s Company of the Regiment of Guards.\n\nLittle is known about the lives of William’s grandparents, Thomas and Sabra Harris. Thomas and Sabra lived near the north Anna River, which forms the border between Louisa County and Orange County, Virginia. This district was home to other families—the Bells, Bollings, and Bledsoes—whose members played a part in the Harris family history. In 1776, Thomas and Sabra Harris and their family moved from Louisa County to Orange County, and they lived there until Thomas died in 1782.\n\nIn 1803, Sabra decided to give up the land that had been left to her in Thomas’ will. This generated a court case to partition the land among the heirs. In the will, Thomas named his children. One son, John Harris, was given a bequest of land, which was to be distributed to him, “when he comes of age or marries.” This was proof that when Thomas died in 1782, John was a minor. The first time John shows up on the tithable tax rolls was in 1785, but not as a tithable. John’s name was listed with his brother, Thomas, as head of household, which meant that John was over sixteen but under twenty-one years of age. In 1789, according to tax records, John paid a tithable tax for the first time, so he was twenty-one by that date. This places his birth date between 1765 (under twenty-one in 1785) and 1768 (twenty-one by 1789). Following the court case in 1803, John received a well-described piece of land bordering the parcel where Sabra, his mother, lived.\n\nJohn and Milly Harris\n\n​John Harris was born between c.1768. On July 17, 1792 John married Mary (Polly) Walker, daughter of Peter Walker. John and Mary (Polly) had five children: (1) Charles W. Harris (married Polly Strong), (2) James Walker Harris (married Sarah Strong Thompson), (3) Sarah (Sally) Harris (married William Thompson), (4) Polly Harris (married James Smith), (5) Nancy Harris (married John Kilgore).\n\nMary (Polly) Walker Harris died before or during 1800.\n\nOn November 2, 1800, John married Milly Bolling Price, a widow born about 1772, who also lived in Louisa County, Virginia. She was the daughter of John and Ursula Bell Wisdom Bolling. Milly’s father, John Bolling, owned property on the banks of the Pamunky River, land that he inherited from his father, William Bolling. John Bolling was a patriot in the Revolutionary War, along with his four brothers,, Thornberry, Samuel, William and Jesse. Brother William died at Valley Forge on August 20, 1778.\n\nMilly’s parents, John and Ursula Bolling, eventually moved to Oglethorpe County, Georgia. Milly married Thomas Price, who was from Oglethorpe County, in the late 1790’s, and he died shortly afterwards. As far as can be determined, Milly and Thomas did not have any children. According to the Oglethorpe County Administration Guardian Book, 1799-1807, Milly was in court on August 26, 1799, asking for twelve months support from Thomas Price’s estate. Sometime after that date, she moved back to Orange County, Virginia. In 1800, she married John Harris, widower.\n\nJohn and Milly Harris had ten children: (1) Elizabeth Harris, (2) John D. Harris (married Lucy Hawkins), (3) Lewis Harris (married Nancy Stroud), (4) Patsy (Martha) Harris (married Ransome Kimball), (5) Clary Harris (married Seaton Cochran), (6) Thomas Harris (married Caroline Brown), (7) Susannah Harris (married Willis Kilgore), (8) William Harris (married Harriet Amanda Davenport), (9) Jourdan Harris (married Comfort Whaley), (10) Jesse Mercer Harris.\n\nIn 1803, John and Milly sold the property he had received from his mother’s court petition. The deed said that “Mildred” was unable to come to the courthouse to be examined concerning her dowager rights, so they went to her at home. It is thought that she was pregnant or had just delivered. This could explain why “Milly” got recorded as “Mildred” by the court clerk. This 1803 sale of land coincides with their move to Oglethorpe County, Georgia by 1805-1806.\n\nMoving to Georgia\n\n​According to deeds, census records and yearly returns, John and Milly were living in the Big Creek area of Oglethorpe County, Georgia by 1806. In a deed dated May 14, 1806, John bought 350 acres of land, including the house where he was already living, from Ruben Radford. This same deed speaks of a cotton machine on the property. After John’s death in 1821, the yearly returns state that the mill wheel was repaired, cotton bagging was bought, along with ink for a printing machine. These items indicate that John probably ran a cotton gin. Perhaps some of his sons were helpers and may have continued the cotton gin operations after his death. One of John’s grandsons was a wheelwright by trade, and another grandson was a mechanic.\n\nAt the time John Harris arrived in Oglethorpe County, the main cash crop was cotton. The years following the War of 1812 were very prosperous for the residents of Oglethorpe County. It was during this time that the plantation system was well-established in Georgia . Just prior to John and Milly’s arrival to the area, several early churches were formed. Many congregations met in the homes of its members. It is thought that the Harris’ attended Big Creek Primitive Baptist Church. The Bolling family records show that members of John and Milly’s family were some of the first members. The church was close to their home. After Milly moved to Walton County, Georgia (around 1836), she was a charter member of the Sorrells Springs Primitive Baptist Church.\n\nBackground on the Harris farm"
