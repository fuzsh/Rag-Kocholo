Paterson\n\nextracts from\n\nMarriage Record to 1876\n\nIn 1865, after emancipation, William A. Cobb, the Ordinary for Upson County, was confronted with the unprecedented requirement to issue marriage licenses to ex-slaves. He composed his own marriage license form which differed from that given to whites in that it asked the marrying official to supply, not only the names of the bride and groom, but also the names of their previous owners. These licenses were transcribed into the book now titled Marriage Record to 1876. Original licenses that were returned to the court were filed and preserved as loose papers (some licenses were not returned, and it may be presumed that the intended marriage was not performed). Cobb used this unique marriage license form from October 1865 until the end of December 1869; thereafter, reverting to the same form for colored marriages as was used for white marriages.\n\nThese unusual marriage licenses have particular historical value because documents that specifically link freedpeople to their former owners are rare. Furthermore, they add to the data from which we can analyze the freedpeople's choices of surnames after freedom. My examination of these records suggests some interpretations along with certain cautions:\n\n(1) In some of the licenses, the clerk supplied a supposed previous owner's surname, but the rest of the owner's name was never filled in. In all but one instance (Sarah Williams/Weaver), this supposed owner's surname was identical to the freedperson's surname. It is possible that the clerk was merely anticipating that the former owner's name would coincide with the surname of the ex-slave, rather than recording an actually-reported previous owner's name. Without corroborating evidence, former owners' surnames that lack a complete name should be treated as speculative.\n\n(2) In six cases (four of them involving persons named Graves), the bride or groom is reported to be \"a free man [or woman] of color,\" with no former owner indicated. I suggest that this wording was deliberately chosen to contrast with the terms \"freedman\" or \"freedwoman,\" so that a free person of color was a person regarded as free before the general emancipation, while the term \"freed\" specifically referred to ex-slaves.\n\n(3) There is nothing in the words \"previous owner\" that unambiguously required the name of the ex-slave's last owner. Although William A. Cobb, the Ordinary, surely intended that the last owner's name be recorded, researchers should not rule out the possibility of finding a more distant owner's name instead.\n\n(4) Because Cobb had been the Clerk of Inferior Court (later changed to Ordinary) since 1844, besides being a Thomaston merchant whose customers would have included persons from throughout the community, he would undoubtedly have been familiar with most persons (including slaves) in the county. Some of the record book entries show evidence of changes or corrections to the names given on the original licenses (see footnotes). Doubtless, these corrections and alterations are the work of Cobb.\n\nThe table below extracts the first 238 marriage licenses, plus license #258, from the record book Marriage Record to 1876. These are all the marriage licenses that contain names of previous owners.\n\nNote: In most cases, record book spellings have been checked against original licenses. Except in cases of obvious error, spelling of groom's and bride's names follows the original license. When completeness of information differs between the book and the original, I follow the most complete version. Where former slaveowners' christian names were abbreviated, I have spelled them out (ex: Wm. is William, Jas. is James). Dates are the dates that marriages were performed, except in cases where the licenses were issued but not returned, in which cases I give the date the license was issued.\n\n91\n\n258\n\nLockett, Shade\n\nLockett, Sol\n\n5/26/1870\n\n91\n\n258\n\nWilliams, Martha Ann\n\n[not given]\n\n5/26/1870\n\nProblems, suggestions, or ideas?\n\nUpson County Page last updated: Friday, 12-Jan-2001 10:08:48 MST"
