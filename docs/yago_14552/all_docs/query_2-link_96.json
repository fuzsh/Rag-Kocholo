Waggoner (1879-1939) [Philip, Haakon County] did speeches for political equality/franchise club events in Philip in 1910, 1914, and 1916 [Bad River News (Philip SD), May 19, 1910, May 26, 1910; Philip Weekly Review (SD), May 19, 1910; Philip Weekly Review and Bad River News (SD), October 29, 1914; November 12, 1914, November 2, 1916]. Waggoner was born in Illinois, educated in Illinois and Michigan, and, in 1907, “landed at Philip on the day before the town lot sale, after a somewhat tiresome walk from Rapid City.” He married Harriet Elizabeth Brown in 1908 in Illinois. Alvin was an attorney and, in the spring of 1908, formed a law partnership with former classmate George Philip who worked out of an office in Fort Pierre. Waggoner was also editor of the Bad River News in 1907-1910, held various town offices off-and-on from 1907 to 1920, was active in the Republican party and commercial booster efforts, served as states attorney 1910-1913, was on the school board 1915-1918, was county chair for the Red Cross in 1917-1921, was appointed by the governor to the Board of Regents in 1921 until at least 1923, was an editor of the S.D.

Harriet Elizabeth Brown was born in Illinois. In June 1908, she married Alvin Waggoner in Albion IL and moved to Philip SD. Harriet was involved with church ladies’ aid groups, Sunday schools, the parent-teacher club/association, and the local woman’s club. She was also active with the Red Cross in 1917-1922 and a school election judge in 1918-1921. In 1920, she supported the county-level Republican presidential nomination campaign for Frank Lowden of Illinois. Before 1945, Harriet moved to Rapid City [Bad River News (Philip SD), June 25, 1908, July 9, 1908, February 4, 1909, January 6, 1910, March 28, 1912, April 25, 1912; Philip Weekly Review and Bad River News (SD), May 21, 1914, April 22, 1915, January 6, 1916, October 18, 1917; Philip Weekly Review (SD), August 28, 1919, March 18, 1920; The Pioneer (Philip SD), August 23, 1917, February 14, 1918,, May 23, 1918, June 6, 1918, April 24, 1919, May 15, 1919, May 22, 1919; The Pioneer-Review (Philip SD), November 11, 1920, February 17, 1921, March 17, 1921, May 12, 1921, June 9, 1921, April 13, 1922, April 27, 1922, October 12, 1922, December 14, 1922, December 21, 1922; Argus Leader (Sioux Falls SD), October 15, 1927; 1900-1930 US census, 1915-1945 SD census, IL Marriage Records, and NY Passenger Lists, via Ancestry.com; “Harriet F Waggoner,” Findagrave.com].\n\n* Jane Waldron (1861-1941) [Ft. Pierre, Stanley County] was a delegate to the 1907 and 1910 NAWSA conventions, state superintendent for press work in 1907-1909, and was on the state finance committee in 1910. Waldron, born Jane Elizabeth Van Meter, spent her early childhood with her mother’s family–Santee Dakota around the Ihanktonwan area–and was later enrolled with the Two Kettle Band (Lakota) at the Cheyenne River Sioux Agency.\n\n* Gertrude Walker (1857-1943) [Bruce, Brookings County] was an auditor for the state suffrage organization from 1909 to 1916, and did organizing work in Brookings County in 1910, a little in 1914, and in 1915-1916 (until moving to California).\n\nEli C. Walton (1838-1915) [Huron, Beadle County] participated in and made remarks at an event in Huron celebrating the birthday of Susan B. Anthony [Huron Dakota Huronite (SD), February 20, 1890; Leavenworth Times (KS), March 11, 1890; Huron Daily Times (SD), February 17, 1890, “Page 26 : Susan B. Anthony Honored,” Emma Smith DeVoe: 1880-1890 (Scrapbook D), Manuscripts, MS 171, Box 10, Washington State Library]. “Dr.” Eli C. Walton was born in Illinois and served in the Civil War as a sergeant/private in Company B of the 54th Illinois infantry from November 1861 to October 1865. He married Priscilla E. in Illinois in 1866. By about 1873, they had moved to Gayville Township in far southeastern Dakota Territory. Walton was a justice of the peace, school district/township clerk, was in the territorial House of Representatives in 1879, and may have had a drug store. In the spring of 1880, they moved to the new settlement at Huron where Eli Walton was named one of the first Beadle County commissioners, was clerk of the district court, and opened a drug store in Huron. In the 1870 and 1880 censuses, he was marked as a physician (in 1900 as an attorney). In the later 1880s, he became active in the Grand Army of the Republic and was a soldiers pension agent for the district. With a variety of other fraternal organizations, the Waltons were also active with the Odd Fellows, Priscilla serving as state president of the Rebekahs in c.1892. She was also a member of the WCTU in 1886-1890. Eli Walton died in 1915 at the State Soldiers’ Home in Hot Springs [(Yankton) (Daily) Press and Dakotaian (SD), April 29, 1875, October 14, 1875, October 5, 1877, November 20, 1877, October 4, 1878, April 3, 1880, April 19, 1880, June 10, 1880, August 3, 1880, September 17, 1880, June 1, 1881, November 6, 1886; Warner Sun (SD), September 17, 1886; Turner County Herald (Hurley SD), November 22, 1888, December 19, 1895, December 16, 1897; Custer Weekly Chronicle (SD), January 8, 1898; Madison Daily Leader (SD), September 18, 1890, May 17, 1892, May 19, 1892; Pierre Weekly Free Press (SD), September 30, 1915; The Citizen-Republican (Scotland SD), October 7, 1915; History of Southeastern Dakota (1884), 32, 148-149, 153; Gayville History, gayvillesd.org website; IL Marriage Records, 1870-1910 US Census, IL Civil War veterans indexes, 1890 Veterans Schedule, 1895-1915 SD census, and 1907-1909 Huron city directory, via Ancestry.com; “Eli C Walton,” Findagrave.com].\n\n“Messrs.

Anthony Honored,” Emma Smith DeVoe: 1880-1890 (Scrapbook D), Manuscripts, MS 171, Box 10, Washington State Library.\n\n* Jennie D. Walton (1877-1961) [Huron, Beadle County] signed a suffrage petition in 1910, served as state corresponding secretary from 1910 to 1913, and was involved in the short-lived discussions about forming a women’s political party in the winter of 1910 [Daily Huronite (Huron SD), July 11, 1910, August 25, 1910; Union County Courier (Elk Point SD), September 1, 1910; Pierre Weekly Free Press (SD), December 8, 1910, March 2, 1911; Argus-Leader (Sioux Falls, SD), July 26, 1912; Forest City Press (SD), July 11, 1913; RD04998, Constitution of the South Dakota Universal Franchise League, Pyle Papers USD; Pickler to Woman’s Journal c/o Agnes E. Ryan, December 1, 1913, Gen. Corr., 1839-1961, mss34132, box 28, reel 19, NAWSA Records, Library of Congress]. Jennie M. Douglas was born in Minnesota and was a school teacher in Emmett MN. In September 1901, she married Miles E. Walton, a dentist from Huron SD and son of Eli C. Walton (above), and they moved to Huron. Jennie Walton was also involved with various sororal organizations in the 1910s. Around 1924, having divorced from Miles, Jennie moved to 3153 31st Ave. S., Minneapolis with her daughter Dorothy (b.1902) and son George D. (b.1914). In Minneapolis, Jennie was a teacher at Roosevelt High School. Between 1940 and 1948, she and Dorothy moved to Vallejo CA, where George was living with his family [Minneapolis Tribune (MN), September 11, 1901; Pierre Weekly Free Press (SD), June 2, 1910; Daily Huronite (Huron SD), January 9, 1914; Huron Weekly State Spirit (SD), June 17, 1915; 1880-1940 US census, MN Marriages Index, 1907-1965 city directories for Huron, Minneapolis, and Vallejo, 1915 SD census, CA Death Index, via Ancestry.com].\n\nRev. Richard C. Walton (1858-1918) [Highmore, Hand County] supported suffrage in a sermon in 1889 and was one of those in Highmore to welcome and host Henry Blackwell of Boston during his 1890 suffrage campaign tour [The Woman’s Journal (Boston MA), August 24, 1889, p.269, and September 13, 1890, p.292, Schlesinger Library, Harvard University]. Richard C. Walton was born in England and immigrated with his wife to the U.S. in around 1881. By 1884, he was the Congregational minister at Volga, relocating to the church at Highmore in 1887. In the 1890s, he also became involved with the SD Sheep Breeders’ Association and the Republican party. Around 1894, he and his family moved south, ending up at Kansas City, Missouri [Press and Daily Dakotaian (Yankton SD), October 18, 1884, January 15, 1887; Hand County Press (Miller SD), June 9, 1892, March 9, 1893; The Home Missionary 58(8) (December 1885), 304, 60(2) (June 1887), 73; Sully County Watchman (Onida SD), May 14, 1892, October 8, 1892; Turner County Herald (Hurley SD), May 11, 1893, June 16, 1892; Kansas City Journal (MO), February 5, 1898, April 25, 1898, February 18, 1899; “Richard C Walton,” Findagrave.com; 1900-1910 US census and 1900-1903 Kansas City directories, via Ancestry.com].\n\nLulu S. Wanzer (1862-1931) [Armour, Douglas County] contributed to Mabel Rewman’s fundraising efforts late in the 1918 suffrage campaign, in the midst of the influenza epidemic [Pyle to McMahon, November 5, 1918, RA11691-RA11693, Wanzer to friend, November 1, 1918, RA11631, Pyle to Wanzer, November 4, 1918, RA11677, Wanzer to Pyle, November 4, 1918, RA11679, and Wanzer to Pyle, November 7, 1918, RA11740, Box 4, Correspondence, 1918, November 1-7, and Wanzer to Pyle, December 12, 1918, RA12046, Wanzer to Pyle, December 14, 1918, RA12050, Wanzer to Pyle, December 26, 1918, RA12067, and Pyle to Stevens, December 27, 1918, RA12071-RA12073, Box 4, Correspondence, 1918, December, Pyle Papers USD]. Lulu Swallow was born in Ohio and married Edwin P. Wanzer in April 1887 in Hardin OH; they moved to Armour shortly thereafter. The Wanzers both taught at the first schoolhouse in 1887; her husband continued teaching until passing the bar to become an attorney (he was also later state senator c.1917-1919). In 1913-1915, she chaired the committee working to get a Carnegie library for Armour and continued on the library board. In November 1913, she was instrumental in organizing and leading the state Red Cross Seal Commission, selling Christmas seals to raise funds for tuberculosis prevention and treatment. From then until 1920, she expanded the job by branching into the coordination of public nurses and leading “health tournament” programs for school children around the state. She prepared the bill and worked to lobby for a public nursing law, which passed in 1919, and she became the state director of public nursing under the State Board of Health. When the SD Public Health Association was created in the fall of 1920, she was retained for a few months; she named her replacement in February 1921. As the commission’s chair, its headquarters were her home at 1203 Main St. (built 1895) in Armour–by the time she resigned, the Armour post office’s status had been upgraded to third class for the volume of mail that her position engendered. “Camp Wanzer, the South Dakota Tuberculosis Association’s summer preventorium in the Black Hills is named for her” [WPA (1938)]. Wanzer was also treasurer of the SD Federation of Women’s Clubs in 1916-1918, president of the Ladies Cemetery Association for the Pleasant Ridge Cemetery in Armour in 1918, a county chair for Leonard Wood’s campaign for the presidential nomination in 1920, a state officer and Worthy Grand Matron for the Eastern Star in 1920-1922, and was named to the State Board of Regents (possibly the first woman on that board) in January 1931 on which she served until her death later that year [Madison Daily Leader (SD), January 4, 1907, March 19, 1913, November 26, 1913, July 1, 1915, August 27, 1918, January 28, 1919, October 25, 1919, August 17, 1920, February 23, 1921, September 28, 1922; Brookings Register (SD), December 4, 1913, October 30, 1919; Turner County Herald (Hurley SD), September 17, 1914; Hot Springs Weekly Star (SD), December 3, 1915; The Citizen-Republican (Scotland SD), March 23, 1916, March 4, 1920, June 10, 1920; Mitchell Capital (SD), May 4, 1916; Pierre Weekly Free Press (SD), May 18, 1916, October 12, 1916; Miller Press (SD), January 30, 1919, November 20, 1919, May 27, 1920, June 17, 1920, May 4, 1922; The Pioneer-Review (Philip SD), November 11, 1920; Journal of the American Medical Association 73(15) (October 11, 1919), 1146; Gunderson to Pyle, February 13, 1918, RA07801, Box 1, Correspondence, 1918, February 9-18, Pyle Papers, USD; William David Wanzer, The Wanzer Family in America (Medford MA: Madford Mercury Press, 1920), 61; WPA, Federal Writers’ Project.

The Wanzers in 1910, 1920, and 1930 censuses had a live-in domestic servant in the household as well.\n\nThere’s a photograph of Wanzer at the dedication of the Carnegie Library in 1915, in Robert Karolevitz, Douglas County “The Little Giant” (Armour SD: Douglas County Historical Society, 1983), 108.\n\nJames P. Ward (1834-1916) [Parker, Turner County] supported Pickler’s 1885 suffrage bill as a member of the Territorial House of Representatives. Ward also supported a prohibition bill in 1885. In the spring of 1890, Ward and his wife were officers of the Turner County Equal Suffrage Association, J.P. Ward serving as president (his brother Rev. Z.R. Ward may have taken over later in 1890). In June 1890, he also supported a new “Brotherhood of Purpose” political movement that included support for equal pay for equal work among its principles, along with free silver, anti-trusts, and public ownership of railroads and telegraph, etc. [Canton Advocate (SD), February 19, 1885, March 19, 1885; Turner County Herald (Hurley SD), March 27, 1890, April 17, 1890; The Herald-Advance (Milbank SD), June 6, 1890; “Page 70 : Programme of W.C.T.U.

James Parmelee Ward was born in Ohio, lived in Massachusetts and Wisconsin. He married Orra J. Hulet in Berea OH in 1862. They lived in Wisconsin for a time until he came to homestead in the area of Parker SD, in 1878, and brought his family out shortly thereafter. The Wards had a large farm of 320 acres that they sold in February 1893. Ward ran for and was elected to the territorial House in 1884 and 1886, and he was active with the county Republican committee in 1889-1890. Ward was president of the Farmers Mutual Protective Association of Plankinton in 1885-1890, until it hit financial failure in August 1893. In 1890, Ward was elected to the board of trustees of the State Normal School in Madison and was appointed by the governor to the state Board of Regents in 1892. In 1893, he visited California and Mexico on the Pacific Coast and bought land for a ranch / fruit farm in Santa Clara County, California, an area he reportedly named as Paradise Valley, near Morgan Hill. His wife and daughter lived at Huron for a time and then joined him in 1894 [Press and Daily Dakotaian (Yankton SD), October 22, 1884, November 7, 1884; Mitchell Capital (SD), December 11, 1885, March 28, 1890; Turner County Herald (Hurley SD), January 14, 1886, October 28, 1886, November 4, 1886, January 17, 1889, August 22, 1889, October 10, 1889, October 23, 1890, August 10, 1893, February 15, 1894, August 22, 1901; Hot Springs Star (SD), March 7, 1890; Madison Daily Leader (SD), May 12, 1890, August 17, 1893, April 2, 1894; Hand County Press (Miller SD), January 14, 1892, October 26, 1893; Sully County Watchman (Onida SD), February 3, 1893; Eugene T.

Ward (1835-1917) [Parker, Turner County] signed on as second vice-president of the Turner County Equal Suffrage Association organized in April 1890 [Turner County Herald (Hurley SD), April 17, 1890]. Orra Jane Hulet was born in Ohio. In 1861, she graduated with a B.S. from Baldwin University in Berea OH (I believe her uncle was closely involved with the university). She married James P.

Willhoyte (1881-1958) [Lead, Lawrence County] was vice-president of the Lead suffrage club in 1910, tresurer of the Lawrence Co. ESA in 1916, and involved with the local League of Women Voters in 1925-1926 [Lead Daily Call (SD), January 15, 1910, April 17, 1916; Daily Deadwood Pioneer-Times (SD), April 29, 1916; The Discerning Voter 1(3) (October 1925), 2, and 1(8) (April 1926), 2]. Fairrie Lucretia Willhoyte was born in Kentucky (or Texas?) and was a teacher specializing in teaching speech to the deaf. By one account she had training with a woman named Mary Garrett in Philadelphia, started her first day school for teaching the deaf in Columbus OH in 1903, and was in Danville KY in 1905. By 1908, she had moved to Lead and was ‘governess’ for the family of Dr. John W. and Harriett Freeman at 514 W. Main. She became guardian of their son Howard. Educational directories listed her as superintending the Black Hills School for the Deaf. She was also active with the WCTU in 1908-1909 and the Sunshine Society in the 1930s-50s [The Association Review 5(2) (April 1903), 212, 7(4) (October 1905), 373; Black Hills Wnion and Western Stock Review (Rapid City SD), October 23, 1908, August 13, 1909; Lead Daily Call (SD), March 13, 1915, June 21, 1934, January 14, 1939, April 24, 1939, December 17, 1950, September 17, 1952, July 2, 1964; Department of the Interior, Bureau of Education, Educational Directory, 1919-1920, Part 4.

Williams (1858-1925) [Brookings / Watertown] campaigned for suffrage through the WCTU and became state secretary for the SDESA for the 1898 campaign. She spoke to local and district WCTU meetings, participated in the state suffrage convention in Mitchell in the fall of 1897, and in August 1898 set up a headquarters in Brookings in an office over the Collins’ clothing store. As secretary, she handled much of the state correspondence about speakers and campaign literature, which is part of the Pickler Papers at the SD State Archives. She remained state secretary into 1899. After the Williams’ moved to Watertown, she perhaps was also on the county committee for the 1918 campaign [Semi-Weekly Register (Brookings SD), May 29, 1897, June 16, 1897, October 9, 1897, October 23, 1897, August 9, 1898, October 25, 1898, November 4, 1898, December 2, 1898; Mitchell Capital (SD), September 24, 1897, October 1, 1897, September 1, 1899; Kimball Graphic (SD), October 14, 1898; Topeka State Journal (KS), November 5, 1898; Williams to Pyle, February 20, 1918, RD07936, and Pidgeon to Pyle, February 8, 1918, RD07721, Pyle papers USD; Avery, ed., Proceedings of the 32nd Annual Convention of NAWSA, held at Washington, D.C., Feb. 8, 9, 10, 12, 13, and 14, 1900 (Philadelphia: Alfred J.

They lived in Willow Lakes c.1891, and moved to Brookings by 1897 (maybe while/because son Losey was a student at SDSU). In 1891-1892, she published the White Ribbon Journal and did press work for the WCTU. In 1898, she was local WCTU president. The Williams’ moved to Glenwood, Deuel County for a few years, then returned to Brookings in 1902. She was also involved with the Degree of Honor.
