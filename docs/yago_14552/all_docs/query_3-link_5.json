She began to recite in public when about eight years old, winning a $50 prize in an elocution contest at Chickering Hall, New York, when she was thirteen years old. She studied music during next two years with Max Maretzek and James Alden, New York, making her debut in comic opera as “Fiametta” in “The Mascot” in September 1882. She remained on the stage for a number of years as prima donna and comedienne, starring through the United States and Eastern Canada. She retired from the stage and took up song and sketch writing for M. Witmark & Sons, New York.\n\nShe came to Manitoba in 1897. She never appeared on the stage professionally but she produced musical comedy, light opera, and drama in Winnipeg for many years.
