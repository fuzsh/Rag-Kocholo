Theirs was an ideal marriage. They were near the same age and both loved farm life. They were blessed with good health, a fine family background and a rich spiritual heritage. They shared the large farm house with his parents, George Washington and Ann Greer Walker. He was a Cilvil War Veteran. They were of Irish Extraction.\n\nThe first child to bless the home was a girl. She was christened Augusta Ann for her two grandmothers. What a pride and joy to both parents and grandparents. When a boy was born, he was also a pride and joy. He was named for his grandfathers, William George. When Mary Isla came to bless the home, she was named for her mother's sister Mary. Nellie Edna was named for her grandfather Walker's Aunt Nellie and her Aunt Edna Beech. Another boy joined the family, James Walter, named for his father's brother James and his mother's brother Walter. When John Benjamin came, he was named for his great-great grandfathers, John Greer and Benjamin Walker. Then Farris Rowland. He was named for the District Superintendent of the Methodist Church at that time - the church the family attended. Ellis Granville was given his great-grandmother's maiden name, Ellis, with Granville added for double initials. His twin brother, who did not survive, would have been called Dellis Stanley. Allie Eudora, a bundle of joy to the whole family, arrived after the family had moved to a new home about two miles from the Grandparents. She was named for her mother's sister Dora Craig.\n\nThese sketches have been collected from parents, grandparents and other relatives who were interested in family history.\n\nName: Harriet Ella Beech.

(Sullivan) Jeffreys - In the summer time that Aunt Nell lived with Grandma Walker, she either went to school or she would go on trips. So the grandchildren took turns staying with Grandma. All of her grandchildren took turns staying with Grandma, Uncle Ferris's children, Uncle Ellis's children, Uncle Willie's (William George) children and our family. Grandma had a spring that had a \"water perpetual pump\", I think they called it, that pumped the water all the time up to the spring house beside the house. I liked it because I didn't have to go to the spring to bring up water, and she had an icebox so I didn't have to go to the spring to bring up milk. She always had biscuits every night, and we would have hot biscuits and jelly before we went to bed, which Mama didn't do.\n\nShe had a beautiful garden, all around it were herbs and flowers. She had a lot of Sweet Williams in her garden and she grew sweet peas and peonies. She had a large orchard with tame crabapples. She did a lot of apple drying each summer.\n\nShe always made the wine for church for sacrament, and the unleavened bread for sacrament. She taught the elementary or grammar school children's Sunday School as far back as I can remember. And could preach as good a sermon as any person I ever heard.\n\nSources\n\n↑ 1.0 1.1 1.2 1.3 Source: Find A Grave, database and images (https://www.findagrave.com : accessed 12 February 2019), memorial page for Harriet Ella “Hattie” Beach Walker (18 Jul 1867–19 Jul 1951), Find A Grave Memorial no. 80322059, citing Walker Cemetery, Hickman County, Tennessee, USA ; Maintained by bbarnhill (contributor 47395133) .\n\n↑ Source: Ancestry.com Tennessee, Marriage Records, 1780-2002 Publication: Name: Ancestry.com Operations Inc; Location: Lehi, UT, USA; Date: 2008;\n\n↑ 3.0 3.1 Source: \"United States Census, 1910,\" database with images, FamilySearch (https://familysearch.org/ark:/61903/1:1:MGNV-8NC : accessed 12 February 2019), Hattie E Walker in household of William F Walker, Civil District 1, Williamson, Tennessee, United States; citing enumeration district (ED) ED 138, sheet 5A, family 69, NARA microfilm publication T624 (Washington D.C.: National Archives and Records Administration, 1982), roll 1526; FHL microfilm 1,375,539.\n\n↑ 4.0 4.1 4.2 Source: \"Tennessee Deaths, 1914-1966,\" database with images, FamilySearch (https://familysearch.org/ark:/61903/1:1:N9GN-SRF : 15 October 2018), Hattie Beech Walker, 19 Jul 1951; Death, Nashville, Davidson, Tennessee, United States, Tennessee State Library and Archives, Nashville.\n\n↑ 5.0 5.1 5.2 5.3 Source: Ancestry.com Tennessee, Deaths and Burials Index, 1874-1955 Publication: Name: Ancestry.com Operations, Inc.; Location: Provo, UT, USA; Date: 2011;\n\n↑ 6.0 6.1 6.2 Source: \"United States Census, 1900,\" database with images, FamilySearch (https://familysearch.org/ark:/61903/1:1:MSZ2-JB9 : accessed 12 February 2019), Hattie Walker in household of Washin*** Walker, Civil District 1, Williamson, Tennessee, United States; citing enumeration district (ED) 109, sheet 17A, family 319, NARA microfilm publication T623 (Washington, D.C.: National Archives and Records Administration, 1972.); FHL microfilm 1,241,605.\n\n↑ Source: \"United States Census, 1870,\" database with images, FamilySearch (https://familysearch.org/ark:/61903/1:1:MD8D-C6P : 12 April 2016), Hariett Beach in household of William Beach, Tennessee, United States; citing p. 10, family 63, NARA microfilm publication M593 (Washington D.C.: National Archives and Records Administration, n.d.); FHL microfilm 553,070.\n\n↑ Source:\"United States Census, 1880,\" database with images, FamilySearch (https://familysearch.org/ark:/61903/1:1:MDWK-B3X : 15 July 2017), Harritte Beech in entry for William B Beech, 1880; citing enumeration district ED 228, sheet 6C, NARA microfilm publication T9 (Washington D.C.: National Archives and Records Administration, n.d), roll 1285; FHL microfilm 1,255,285.\n\n↑ Source: \"United States Census, 1920,\" database with images, FamilySearch (https://familysearch.org/ark:/61903/1:1:MNG5-576 : accessed 12 February 2019), Hattie E Walker in household of William T Walker, Civil District 1, Williamson, Tennessee, United States; citing ED 151, sheet 3B, line 51, family 49, NARA microfilm publication T625 (Washington D.C.: National Archives and Records Administration, 1992), roll 1769; FHL microfilm 1,821,769.\n\n↑ Source: \"United States Census, 1930,\" database with images, FamilySearch (https://familysearch.org/ark:/61903/1:1:SP7T-4K4 : accessed 12 February 2019), Hattie Walker, District 01, Williamson, Tennessee, United States; citing enumeration district (ED) ED 2, sheet 7A, line 18, family 119, NARA microfilm publication T626 (Washington D.C.: National Archives and Records Administration, 2002), roll 2285; FHL microfilm 2,342,019.\n\n↑ Source: \"United States Census, 1940,\" database with images, FamilySearch (https://familysearch.org/ark:/61903/1:1:K4H2-7M7 : 14 March 2018), Hattie E Walker, Civil District 1, Williamson, Tennessee, United States; citing enumeration district (ED) 94-2, sheet 1A, line 30, family 7, Sixteenth Census of the United States, 1940, NARA digital publication T627.
