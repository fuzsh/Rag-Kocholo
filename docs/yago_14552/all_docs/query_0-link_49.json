Mr. W.M. Walker, the present collector of Saline county, was born in Smith county, Tennessee, October 22, 1833, coming to Miami with his parents when but three years old, and was raised on a farm in Moniteau county, in this state. His father, Samuel Walker, was born in 1798, in North Carolina; his grandfather, Edward Walker, was a native of Virginia, born about 1745, and was an orderly sergeant in the Revolutionary war, and was present at the battle of Cowpens. His father came from England. When a young man, Samuel Walker moved with his parents to Tennessee. Mrs. Agnes Walker, nee Bradford, the mother of William M., was born September 6, 1793, in Tennessee. Her father, Bocker Bradford, was born in Virginia, about 1750, and was also of English descent and a soldier in the Revolutionary war. Nine children blessed the marriage of Samuel Walker and Agnes Bradford, (one of them dying in infancy). They moved to Moniteau county, Missouri, in 1836, and there spent the rest of their lives. She died October 11, 1857, and he June 16, 1865. At the age of twenty-two, December 20, 1855, William M. Walker was married to Miss May Isabel Garrett, of Saline county, where she was born, February 5, 1834. Her father was a native Virginian, and his father, Abel Garrett, of Scotch origin, was also a soldier in the Revolution. In 1859 William M. commenced farming for himself in Moniteau county, which he continued for six years, and then, in 1865, moved upon a farm in Saline county. After about four years, he moved to the neighborhood of Orearville. Industry, economy, perseverance, and a genial disposition will readily account for the steady increase of his estate and of his influence in the county. In 1876 he was elected county collector in a hotly contested canvass, and the next year, 1877, he moved his family to the county seat, where he now resides. In 1878, he was re-elected, almost without opposition, and in 1880 was elected again, though there was a keen contest for the office this year. His election to the third term demonstrates the satisfaction he has given his constituents as collector of the county. His integrity is above suspicion, and the people can find no fault with him as an official. Mr. Walker is a Royal Arch Mason, a granger and a member of the Baptist Church, as are also Mrs. Walker and the two elder daughters. Seven children have been born to them, all living, as follows: Narcissa, born November 1, 1857; Mary Helen, born February 16, 1861; Samuel Lee, born August 19, 1862; William Madison, born September 26, 1866; Viola Belle, born April 16, 1869; Thomas Rooker, born August 15, 1870; Nannie S., born February 22, 1873.

[May. 16, 1834], the worthy Elmore Walker who was a citizen of this place and brother to the venerable Jesse Walker who has spent so much of his life in the service of western missions. Our departed friend was also the husband of an affectionate and aged companion who is yet living and the father of several children who are now scattered over the wide west, the most of whom, I am happy to say, have bright prospects of meeting their father where parting will be no more. The departed father and friend has been a member of the Methodist E. Church since an early period of his life. . . . Hence his examples have been many and wonderful to the rising generation. He appeared to be perfectly sensible of his death several weeks or months previous to his departure as he was gradually wasting down with a final consumptive disease though not entirely confined to house or bed until the last eleven or twelve days when strength and reason were entirely withdrawn; once, however, about three days previous to his departure, being raised in bed, in apparently tolerable good reason commenced one of the most beautiful songs of Zion; thus departed our friend, without leaving a remaining doubt concerning his future state.

L. Walker, now deceased - Several months ago a notable gathering took place in the Stokes- Walker family burial ground located on the estate of Miss Martha Stokes. The Daughters of the American Revolution, ably assisted by Dr. and Mrs. W. J. Flanders unveiled a United States Marker on the grave of Elisha Walker, a soldier of the War of the American Revolution. Seven generations of this distinguished soldier were present and took part in the unveiling exercises, among thos were Mrs. Amelia Stokes Walker and Miss Martha Stokes, great granddaughters of the Honorable Elisha Walker. At the noon hour dinner was served by the descendants of the soldier in a beautiful grove not far from the \"Silent Home\" of him in whose honor this celebration was given. In the afternoon appropriate services were held and prayer offered by the Rev. Reese Griffin and the Rev. Chester Olliff. Dr. W. J. Flanders was master of ceremonies and opened the exercises, briefly reviewing the life of the American patriot. He said in part:\"No ordinary occasion calls us together today. We are assembled to remember the fact in the worthy life of Elisha Walker who lived in the perilous time of British invasion and Indian massacre. The span of Mr. Walker's life extended over a period of years without any record or legendary word of evile or aspersion thereon: surely that life was so lived as to need no other epitaph, for virtue alone outbuilds and is more endurable than stone, marble or burnished brass.\" Elisha Walker was married to Elizabeth Bowers in the year of our Lord 1787. They had the following children: Noah, Jerymiah, Henry, Jordy, Milly, Ann, and Lott. All of the seven children grew to manhood and womanhood and reared large families of their own, many of whom are among some of the best children in Georgia. Some of the earliest settlers of Richmond County were related to the Johnson and Washington County families of Walker. There is an old church yard in Richmond County known as the Walker burial ground and only members of this family are allowed to be buried there. The first record that we have of Elisha Walker is that he joined No. 47 Richmond County's first Battalion and on his military record is the following: \"This is to certify that Elisha Walker hath steadfastly done his duty from the time of pasing (sic) an act at Augusta to wit: On the 20th of August 1781, until the total expulsion of the British from the State and the said Elisha Walker can not to my knowledge or belief, be convicted of blundering or distressing the country: and therefore under the said act, entitled to a bounty of two hundred and fifty acres of good land free from taxes fourteen years. Given under My Hand and Seal and Savannah, the 24th day of February in the Year of Our Lord One Thousand Seventeen Hundred and Eighty Four (signed) J. Houston. Attest D. Reese, Sect. (On the back of the certificate) to the Honorable, The President and the members of the Land Court, your petitioners prays a warrant for the within certificates in Washington County, (signed) Elisha Walker. The two hundred and fifty acres of land that was drawn by Elisha Walker in Washington County for services in the Revolutionary War is still owned by the descendants of the Walker-Stokes families. Elisha Walker signed the \"Oath of Allegiance\" and did his part most heroically, assisting in banishing the British Yoke fo Autocracy from our American soil.
