        "text": "David Walker (born 1796/97?, Wilmington, North Carolina, U.S.—died August 6, 1830, Boston, Massachusetts) was an African American abolitionist whose pamphlet Appeal…to the Colored Citizens of the World… (1829), urging enslaved people to fight for their freedom, was one of the most radical documents of the antislavery movement.\n\nBorn of an enslaved father and a free mother, Walker grew up free, obtained an education, and traveled throughout the country, settling in Boston. There he became involved in the abolition movement and was a frequent contributor to Freedom’s Journal, an antislavery weekly. Sometime in the 1820s he opened a secondhand clothing store on the Boston waterfront. Through this business he could purchase clothes taken from sailors in barter for drink and then resell them to seamen about to embark. In the copious pockets of these garments, he concealed copies of his Appeal, which he reasoned would reach Southern ports and pass through the hands of other used-clothes dealers who would know what to do with them. He also used sympathetic Black seamen to distribute pamphlets directly.\n\nWhen the smuggled pamphlets began to appear in the South, the states reacted with legislation prohibiting circulation of abolitionist literature and forbidding enslaved persons to learn to read and write. Warned that his life was in danger, Walker refused to flee to Canada. His body was found soon afterward near his shop, and many believed he had been poisoned. (Official records, however, indicate that he died of tuberculosis.)\n\nWalker’s Appeal for a slave rebellion, widely reprinted after his death, was accepted by a small minority of abolitionists, but most antislavery leaders and free Blacks rejected his call for violence at the time."
