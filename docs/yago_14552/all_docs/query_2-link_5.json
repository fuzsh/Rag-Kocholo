Walker Chalkley's\n\n__________________________\n\nThis page collects information about the Walker Family in the \"Carolina Cradle\". The \"Cradle\", as used here, includes the area in the Yadkin Watershed, north to the Carolina line. A particular focus is on:\n\nJohn Walker III of the Wigton Line\n\nSamuel Walker\n\nBut information on other Walkers will be added as the data comes to hand.\n\nCaswell County\n\nSamuel Walker \"YDNA Group 33\". Settled in Caswell Co, NC - his son, James went to Robertson county, TN. The name Samuel Walker shows up in Robertson Co but as far as we know he never left NC before he died there in 1798. However, he might have had some land in his name there since the name pops up once in a while in early records.\n\nJohn III. Settled in Caswell Co, NC about 1756, coming there for Borden's Grant (modern Rockbridge County) during the French and Indian War. John III, and his sons Samuel and John IV, left the area about 1771, settling on the Clinch River in Southwest Virginia.\n\nMy brother, Robert Lee Walker, Jr. did the DNA testing that showed we are in group 33 and related to Alexander Walker. (from Roberta Walker Butler, butlerfrw@msn.com)\n\nJordan Creek Walkers\n\n[From David Walker Fide Ann Hubbell] WalkerShort List, 17 September 2009\n\nFrom a family history: \"John and his brother, Phillip, came to America from Ireland before the Revolutionary War. They settled in Maryland, then on to Pennsylvania and finally to Orange County, NC.\" Phillip, Walker Sr. and John lived along Jordan Creek in Orange County. After Orange County was subdivided John lived in Caswell County and Phillip, Sr. in Alamance County, NC.\n\nThe Walkers settled along Jordan creek in old Orange County, NC. Jordan Creek originates in today's Caswell County and flows into Alamance County, then along and parallel to the Caswell County border. The Jordan Creek connects to Stoney Creek and eventually flows into the Haw River. Two other creeks of interest were referenced in the deeds: Owens Creek, which flows into Jordan Creek, and County Line Creek.\n\nJohn Walker, Sr. = Nancy Ashford: Children: William, Phillip, John, Aaron, Abner, Rev. Hugh, George, Ashford, James, Job, Joshua.\n\nson Ashford died in Haywood County, TN\n\nson Job, died in Fayette County, TN. Others died in NC.\n\nSon Phillip, Jr., reported in the 1850 Census (Henderson Co., TN) that he was born in PA. A likely candidate, among several, is the Phillip Walker living in Lack Township, PA in 1775. Lack Township area became a part of Mifflin County, PA in 1789, later part of Juniata County in 1831. Phillip Walker listed as HOH in present Township of Woodbury, in 1778\n\nSome have attempted to identify this John Walker with one or another Walkers in the Wigton Walker lineage, but a comparison of YDNA shows that neither of the two alternative branches of the group known as the Wigton Walkers, match this line.\n\nyDNA Comparison\n\nLineageYDNA Marker results Natural Bridge Branch of the Wigton Walkers TBD Walkers Creek Branch of the Wigton Walkers 13 25 14 11 11 14 12 12 12 13 13 29 Ashford 1324 14 11 12 14 12 12 11 13 14 29\n\nMrs White's book makes no reference to the John Walker who married Nancy Ashford, nor of any of his descendants. But his line would probably be in DNA GR-6, under \"Ashford Walker\". I am assuming (tsk tsk) that a person named Ashford Walker would be the same Ashford Walker who was indeed one of this couple's sons; I have never seen another Ashford Walker of this vintage. This Ashford Walker's relationship to them as their son is documented in many deeds. This John Walker died 29 March 1810, intestate. His 11 children were all sons. See below for what little I know about the source documentation. Nevertheless, I set about documenting every single son, and everything the DAR record claimed turned out to be correct and verifiable by primary documentation except for two things: 1. the aide-to-George-Washington claim for John himelf; and 2. the wife of eldest son William Walker, given in the DAR record vaguely as \"Miss Lloyd\" with no elaboration. John Walker and Nancy Ashford did indeed have an eldest son named William Walker. I cannot prove that he did not marry a \"Miss Lloyd\", but I can find no record of her or of this marriage. I do know that he married a Deborah McCulloch, and the DAR record makes no mention of her. This William Walker died testate in about 1816 in Caswell Co NC, and the only children named in his will were the three he had by wife Deborah McCulloch. I should point out that this John Walker's land lay on Jordan's Creek in Orange Co NC and that in 1777 when Caswell Co NC was created from Orange Co, NC, the new county line was driven right through his property, so that from 1777 onwards, he found himself owning land in both counties. John's surviving sons worked out an agreeable partitioning of John's land, and they documented this in 11 deeds, some filed in Caswell Co NC and some filed in Orange Co, NC (this part of Orange Co NC became ca 1849 Alamance Co NC). In each deed, 10 sons (one son predeceased, so in his case, his heirs) were grantors, and one of the sons was the grantee, a different grantee in each deed. William Walker's two daughters married men named MCCULLOCH and SMITH, and both couples moved to Clay Co MO. His son remained in Caswell Co NC.</font>\n\nPhillip Walker\n\nPhillip Walker, Sr.'s and unknown wife's known children are as follows:\n\nAlexander (abt. 1765-1835)\n\nCounley (Conley, Connally) (1768-1845)\n\nWilliam (1770-1819)\n\nMary (abt. 1775-after 1850) m. Samuel Crawford\n\nJohn (abt. 1775-?, still living in 1845)\n\nPhillip, Jr. (1780-1858)\n\nJames (1785-1853)\n\nJinney (abt. 1790-bef 1835)\n\nPhillip purchased three tracts of land in Orange County:\n\n22 Feb 1788, 209 acres;\n\n30 Apr 1795, 32 acres;\n\n20 Feb 1800, 163 acres.\n\nThese parcels were not \"proven\" until 1802. Phillip Walker, Sr.'s will of 1826, leaves the largest part of this land to son Alexander; at Alexander's death, it was passed on to Phillip, Sr.'s other children. Based on the will Alexander is thought to be the oldest son and James was the youngest son. A smaller land bequest was left to James. The other children received a token inheritance.\n\nPhillip Walker Jr. Phillip, Jr. owned a farm on Jordan Creek, Orange County, NC, purchased in 1805. He married to Rebecca King in 1816 in Orange County, NC, in Hillsboro, NC; the marriage bond was signed by Phillip Walker and J. Taylor. He was listed as head of household in the Orange County 1820 and 1830 Census. [Note this conflicts with information that he moved to TN c. 1820] Their children are believed to have all been born in Orange County, NC, but grew up to adulthood and lived in Henderson County, TN.\n\nMary Ann Elizabeth (birth and death dates unknown)\n\nNancy, (1818-1874) m. Robert R. Dennison\n\n(Ezeriah) Washington (1d820-1908) m. Catherine McCall\n\nLevi (1823-1876) m. Nancy B. Douglas Rosser\n\nWilliam Bedford (1824-1843)\n\nMinerva (1827-1909) m. John Bray\n\nLouise Oakley prepared a booklet about the family in 1940. Stating that about 1820, Phillip Walker and Dave Engraham came down the Tennessee River from North Carolina, stoping at what is now known as Perryville, then traveled westward to Chesterfield.\n\nThe family probably moved to Henderson County, TN after when he received approval of a petition for a land grant in 1833. He appeared on Henderson County's poll tax records in the year 1836 and 1837. In 1836, he was listed as having 512 acres of land and one slave. Phillip, Jr. died in 1858 and Rebecca died in 1870; they are buried in Union Baptist Church Cemetery, Henderson County, TN.\n\nFrom WRWalker 23 June 2010\n\nPhillip Walker b. 1 Apr 1766 Orange Co., NC d.bef.

He left bequests to sons\n\nWilliam,\n\nJames,\n\nJohn,\n\nAlexander and\n\nAbraham.\n\nAlexander (died 1794) and James Walker (died 1803), received land grants on Hogan's Creek in the 1780s in an area in southeastern Rockingham County. Hogan's Creek and Country Line Creek originate in this area, and Big Troublesome Creek flows into Haw River. William Walker (1737-1800) established a home on Country Line Creek just a few miles from Alexander and James. A John Walker, known to be a brother of James and Alexander) immigrated to Davidson County in the Southwest Territory (present-day Tennessee) some time prior to 1793. These four, Alexander, James, William, and John may be the sons of William who died in 1769.\n\nCorrespondance of James Walker and wife Ann survives, and shows a clear connections to Cumberland County, Pennsylvania. Descendants of James Walker Generation No. 1 Walker-Waynick Papers establish link to Cumberland Co. PA. 1793 letter in that collection shows that James' brother John was then living in Davidson Co. in the Southwest Territory, in an area that would later become Tennessee.\n\nJAMES WALKER\n\ndied Abt. 1803 in Rockingham County, NC, USA 2.\n\nmarried ANN MCCLINTOCK 3,4.\n\napplied for land grants in 1778 & 1779 - Guilford Co.

He married JANE BARR12,13,14, daughter of ROBERT BARR and ISABELLA. We know of Alexander from the will of his father James (Old Wills Discovered in Office Dated Prior to 1804, p. 226). One may assume that he is the one Alexander Walker listed in the U.S. Census 1800 for Rockingham County, a record that gives the impression he was married but childless. From James Walker's will, dated May, 1803, we know that Alexander had a son named James, undoubtedly born between 1800 and 1803.\n\nThe year of his death and information about his wife come from the following county court record: Minutes, Court of Pleas and Quarter Sessions for Rockingham County, NC, Book 4, p. 1, May Term, 1804\n\nOrder of the court that Jiney Walker and Robert Barr administer upon Alexander Walker's estate and gave William Jones and John Winder security in the sum of eight hundred pounds.\n\nAccording to the book History of Buffalo Presbyterian Church and Her People (Greensboro, NC: Jos. J. Stone and Co. [no date]) by the Rev. S.M. Rankin, Robert Barr had a sister, Jean, who married a Mr. Walker and subsequently married Adam Scott following the death of her first husband. However, Robert Barr's 1832 will names, as legatees, grandson Robert Walker and several other children with the surname Scott. A Rockingham County marriage bond issued in 1811 bears the names Adam Scott and Jane Walker as groom and bride.\n\nIt would seem that Jane \"Jiney\" Barr was Robert's daughter, not his sister. It is not clear from Rankin's book how he concluded that the woman who married \"Mr. Walker\" was Barr's sister. Barr apparently did have a sister named Jean (a variant spelling of Jane in that era).\n\nThe linkage of the Alexander Walker of this court record with the son of James Walker is bolstered by a comment from an 1805 letter to James' widow Ann from Jean and Daniel McDannell: \"We can inform with pleasure that we Recd aleatter from you bearing date May the 13 1804 which give us great satisfaction to hear of your health and well fair tho we Sympathise with you with the lose of your husband and son.\" For the entire text of the letter, see the Notes for James Walker (died 1803).\n\nThat Alexander also had a son named Robert is suggested by the will of Robert Barr, which names one Robert Walker as Barr's grandson. A county court entry in 1818 confirms the identification:\n\nMinutes, Court of Pleas and Quarter Sessions for Rockingham County, NC, May 1813 to November 1819, p. 313, February Session 1818\n\nIt is ordered by the court that Samuel Young, John Reed and William Donnal Esqs or any two or them be a committee to settle with Robert Barr guardian for Robert Walker son of Alexander Walker decd and that report thereof be made at next court.\n\nNotes for JANE BARR: Rockingham Co. court appointed Jiney Walker and Robert Barr to administer Alexander's estate (Court of Pleas & Quarter Sessions, Book 4, p. 1, May Term, 1804). Acc. to History of Buffalo Presbyterian Church and Her People by Rev. S.M. Rankin, Jean Barr, dau. of James & Agnes, 2 settlers of the Nottingham Colony, married a Mr. Walker, then married Adam Scott after Walker's death. Robert Barr, Jean's brother, also lived in Rockingham Co. However, Robert Barr's will names Robert Walker as grandson.\n\nChildren of ALEXANDER WALKER and JANE BARR are: i. JAMES3 WALKER15, b. Abt. 1801, Rockingham County, NC, USA16. 7. ii. ROBERT WALKER, b. January 04, 1804, Rockingham County, NC, USA; d. August 28, 1862, Rockingham County, NC, USA.\n\n3. JANE2 WALKER (JAMES1)17. She married JOHN HERRON18 December 20, 1790 in Rockingham County, NC, USA18. Jane Herron successfully contested the purported will of her husband, John, in 1809. The relevant documentation follows.\n\nMinutes, Court of Pleas and Quarter Sessions for Rockingham County, NC, November 1808 to May 1813, p. 71 November Session 1809\n\nA paper writing purporting to be the last will and testament of John Herron, deceased, was offered for probate by Wm Wright one of the persons named executors therein. Whereupon came Jane Herron widow and relict of the said John deceased and caveated the probate of said paper writing: and it appearing to the court that the following children of the said John Herron decd are minors viz David, Amos, Isabel, James, Jenny, it is ordered that William Walker Esquire be appointed guardian pending the trial of this caveat to the children Amos, Isable, James, John and Jenny and the said William Walker being in court and agreeing to act as guardian aforesaid, he is in that character made a caveator to the aforesaid suit and Robert Barr who is the guardian of David Heron one of the children aforesaid being also in court is made a party caveator in that character to the said suit.\n\nThe court appointed Jane Herron and William Conner to be administrators of the estate pending the trial. They gave 3,000 pounds security. They were authorized to sell off the perishable portion of the estate (not further identified).\n\nMinutes, Court of Pleas and Quarter Sessions for Rockingham County, NC, November 1808 to May 1813, p. 84</Source>\n\nFebruary Session 1810\n\nJane Herron and others | Caveators | vs | Jury No. 2 Wm Wright | Find that the paper writing offered offered for probate is not the last will and testament of John Herron.\n\nChildren of JANE WALKER and JOHN HERRON are: i. DAVID3 HERRON19.Minutes, Court of Pleas and Quarter Sessions for Rockingham County, NC, November 1808 to May 1813, p. 71November Session 1809 Ordered that Robert Barr be appointed guardian to David Herron son of Jo. Herron deceased he having entered into bond in the sum of 500 pounds with Wm Conner security. ii. AMOS HERRON20. iii. ISABEL HERRON20. iv. JAMES HERRON20.James Herron was a minor in May 1818, according to a county court record. The Minutes Docket of the Court of Pleas and Quarter Sessions for Rockingham County, February Session 1818 records that John Reed, Esq., and Samuel Young, Esq., were appointed to settle with and audit the account of William Conner, the legal guardian of James and John Herron, sons of John Herron, deceased. At the May Session of the court, Conner returned his settlement. See Minutes Docket May 1813 to November 1819, pp. 372 and 393. v. JOHN HERRON20. vi. JENNY HERRON20.\n\n4. WILLIAM2 WALKER (JAMES1)21 was born May 12, 1766 (22), and died March 18, 1838 in Rockingham County, NC, USA (23). He married JEAN (24).\n\nNotes for WILLIAM WALKER: The will of James Walker reveals two bits of information about his son, William: he was still living in July 1803 at the writing of the will and he had a son named James. Haw River Presbyterian Church cemetery has at least two gravestones bearing the name William Walker: one William was born in 1767, the other in 1766. Since the Walker pioneers William (died 1800) and James both had a son named William, it's not entirely clear which tombstone goes with which son. If the idea that families bury their dead close together is at all valid, however, then the one closer to the grave of the pioneer William (it bears only the initials W.W., the date of his death and his age at death) would likely be his son. As it turns out, the tombstone of the William born in 1767 is the closer, so we assume the other was the son of James, by default. It is not clear whether James Walker himself was buried in this cemetery, but there seems to be a general grouping of graves by family -- the William Walker grouping on one side of the trunk of a fallen tree, the James Walker descendants on the other side.\n\nWilliam, son of James, was likely married to Jean, the name on the grave marker immediately to the right of his.\n\nThe names of the children come from the 1844 will of Ann Walker, which lists her sisters Elizabeth, Mary and Jane Starrat and brothers Denny, James, John, Abraham and Alexander, deceased. A number of these names match gravestones at the Haw River cemetery, which are physically close to the graves of William and Jean. We can be sure that William had at least a son named James, based on the elder James' will.\n\nEvidence from county court records strengthens the association between William and the siblings listed in Ann Walker's 1844 will. An entry in the Minute Docket for the August Session 1838 of the Court of Pleas and Quarter Sessions notes that one John Walker was appointed to administer the estate of William Walker. Ann Walker listed a John Walker as one of her brothers. The text of the court record follows:\n\nMinutes, Court of Pleas and Quarter Sessions for Rockingham County, NC, May 1835 to February 1840, August Term 1838, fourth page from the beginning of the term\n\nTuesday court met: Present John Lawson, Joel Fagg and T.B. Wheeler, Esqs. Administration on the estate of William Walker is granted to John Walker who entered into bond in the sum of eight hundred dollars with Joseph Pritchett, S.C. Edwards and G.W. Garrett. The admr was thereupon duly qualified.\n\nNotes for JEAN: Name and vital statistics are from the tombstone immediately to the right of William Walker's (1766-1838). Both markers have the same form - a flat, rectangular slab with a semicircular knob protruding from the top. Both bear the same style of script. The pairing of the 2 graves leads to the conclusion that they might have been married.\n\nChildren of WILLIAM WALKER and JEAN are: i. MARY3 WALKER25,26, b. 179427; d. May 02, 1851, Rockingham County, NC, USA27.Principal information on Mary Walker comes from the will of her sister Ann, dated 31 January 1844, probated November 1848; her own will, written on same date, probated May 1851 and the tombstone at Haw River Presbyterian Church. The 1850 U.S. Census shows that Mary was living with her sister, Jane Starrat, at the time. Mary Walker apparently never married. ii. ANN WALKER28, b. 179629; d. July 10, 1848, Rockingham County, NC, USA29. Principal data on Ann Walker comes from her will, dated 31 January 1844, probated November 1848 and the tombstone at Haw River Presbyterian Church. She apparently never married. Although her will identifies her brothers and sisters, the identification of William Walker (1766-1838) as her father results from analysis of 1810 & 1820 U.S. Census records. Furthermore, will of James Walker (d. 1803) shows that William had a son James. Ann had a brother named James. iii. JAMES WALKER30,31, b. Abt. 179832. iv. ELIZABETH WALKER33, b. 180034; d. August 22, 1845, Rockingham County, NC, USA34. Principal data on Elizabeth Walker comes from the will of her sister Ann, dated 31 JAN 1844, probated NOV 1848 and the tombstone at Haw River Presb. Church. Elizabeth apparently never married. v. JANE WALKER35,36, b. December 14, 180337; d. August 29, 1888, Rockingham County, NC, USA37; m. JAMES STARRAT38, November 10, 1834, Rockingham County, NC, USA38. Will of Ann Walker (31 JAN 1844) identifies Jane Starrat as her sister. Haw River Presb. Church cemetery has tombstone bearing the name Jane Starret. Jane's sister Mary lived with the Jane and James Starrat in the last years of her life. 8. vi. ALEXANDER WALKER, b. April 19, 1807; d. February 12, 1839, Rockingham County, NC, USA. 9. vii. JOHN WALKER, b. April 19, 1808; d. January 08, 1864, Rockingham County, NC, USA. viii. DANIEL WALKER39,40, b. Abt. 1809. ix. ABRAHAM WALKER41, b. Abt. 1810.\n\n5. JOHN2 WALKER (JAMES1)42 was born October 21, 176843, and died September 07, 1851 in Rockingham County, NC, USA43. He married NANCY44,45. Burial: Haw River Prebyterian Church cemetery\n\nChild of JOHN WALKER and NANCY is: 10. i. MARY R.3 WALKER, b. January 08, 1814, Rockingham County, NC, USA; d. November 08, 1904, Rockingham County, NC, USA.\n\n6. ABRAM2 WALKER (JAMES1)46 was born January 04, 178047, and died December 05, 1843 in Rockingham County, NC, USA47. He married ELIZABETH SMITH48,49 November 02, 1833 in Caswell County, NC, USA50. Abram Walker was to inherent the northern half of his father's property, as indicated in the 1803 will of James Walker.\n\nA county court record of early 1844 provides solid evidence that Abram Walker was not only married, but had 4 children.\n\nMinutes, Court of Pleas and Quarter Sessions for Rockingham County, NC, August 1843 to May 1846, p. 82, February Session 1844\n\nIt is ordered that administration on the estate of ...... Walker decd be granted to John Walker, Elizabeth Walker having renounced his administration, and has entered into bond in the sum of ...... with Saml H. Walker. Also in the same court term, there is a record relating to the children:\n\nMinutes, Court of Pleas and Quarter Sessions for Rockingham County, NC, August 1843 to May 1846, p. 92, February Session 1844\n\nNathan Wright appointed guardian of James Thompson Walker, William Pinckny Walker, Nancy Jane Walker and Priscilla Ann Walker. John Walker and D.L. Wright provided securities.\n\nNOTE: The first name of the deceased in the record on page 82 was smudged. Nevertheless, the first letter of the name was partially visible and could have been 'A'. Evidence to support the reading of \"Abram\" as the first name is as follows:\n\n1. From tombstone at Haw River Presbyterian Church cemetery, we know of an Abram Walker who died in December\n\n1843. This record follows closely on the death of this Abram;\n\n2. The 1850 U.S. Census for Rockingham County lists the 4 children named in the second record with an Elizabeth Walker\n\nas the head of family;\n\n3.

He married SARAH (SALLY) MOORE59,60 August 30, 1825 in Rockingham County, NC, USA61. Identification of father as Alexander Walker based on reference to court record (date not known) in which Robert Barr was appointed guardian of Robert Walker, \"orphan son of Alexander Walker.\" Burial: Fair Grove Methodist Church cemetery Children of ROBERT WALKER and SARAH MOORE are:\n\ni. ALEXANDER ALLISON4 WALKER62, b. May 27, 1828, Rockingham County, NC, USA63; d. November 13, 1895, Alcorn County, MS, USA63. Will of Robert Walker, Will Book C, p. 346, establishes Alexander A. Walker as his son. Allison, as he was called, eventually migrated to Tishomingo County, Mississippi. Burial: Hinkle Cemetery, Alcorn Co., MS ii. EMILY WALKER64, b. March 03, 1833, Rockingham County, NC, USA65; d. April 13, 1875, Rockingham County, NC, USA65. Will of Robert Walker, Will Book C, p. 346, establishes Emily Walker as his daughter.

ALEXANDER3 WALKER (WILLIAM2, JAMES1)74 was born April 19, 180775, and died February 12, 1839 in Rockingham County, NC, USA75. He married ANN NELSON76 November 22, 1836 in Guilford County, NC, USA76. Principal data from will of Ann Walker (31 JAN 1844), tombstone at Haw River Presb. Church. Ann Walker's will identifies Alexander's 2 daughters, who were beneficiaries, since Alexander was already deceased. Alexander's wife, Ann, following his death, married Sullivan Pearson.\n\nANN NELSON: Ann Walker celebrated her second marriage, to Sullivan Pearson, on 5 DEC 1853. The U.S. Census 1860 shows that Cornelia Walker, Alexander's daughter, was living in their home at the time. Guilford County, NC, marriage bond of Alexander Walker & Ann Nelson, dated 22 NOV 1836, is consistent with other data on Alexander and Ann Walker. However, there is no absolute confirmation that they are the same individuals. Burial: Lowes Methodist Church cemetery\n\nChildren of ALEXANDER WALKER and ANN NELSON are: i. LAURA ANN4 WALKER77, b. 1838, Rockingham County, NC, USA78. 12. ii. CORNELIA JANE WALKER, b. January 17, 1839, Rockingham County, NC, USA; d. March 08, 1907, Rockingham County, NC, USA.\n\n9. JOHN3 WALKER (WILLIAM2, JAMES1)79 was born April 19, 180880, and died January 08, 1864 in Rockingham County, NC, USA80. He married MARY C.81. Principal data from the will of Ann Walker (31 JAN 1844) and a tombstone at Lowes Methodist Church. It is not confirmed that the individual named on the tombstone is the same as Ann Walker's brother, but seems likely. John's name appears in census records in 1850 & 1860, but not later, consistent with the death date on the tombstone. The year of birth is consistent with what is known about the family of William and Jean Walker. Occupation: Factory Worker\n\nNotes for MARY C.: Possibly Mary Maynard, who married John Walker in Orange County, NC, in 1842 (Orange Co. Marriage Bond dated 3 SEP 1842). This date possibly conflicts with year of birth, 1842, of their oldest child, Margaret J. Walker. Since this date comes from U.S. Census records, it may be inaccurate. She may have been born in 1843. There is no mention of Mary Walker in any census records after 1860.\n\nChildren of JOHN WALKER and MARY C. are: i. MARGARET J.4 WALKER81, b. 1842, Rockingham County, NC, USA82. ii. MARY A. E. WALKER83, b. 1846, Rockingham County, NC, USA83. iii. WILLIAM A. WALKER84, b. 1851, Rockingham County, NC, USA84. iv. NANCY P. WALKER84, b. 1856, Rockingham County, NC, USA84.\n\n10.

Will of James Walker, 21 May 1803, Rockingham County, NC. Due to Walker's statement, in the preamble, that he was weak of body, it seems likely that he died soon after he composed his will. 3.

WILLIAM1 WALKER 1 was born 1737 (2), and died December 14, 1800 in Rockingham County, NC, USA (2). He married MARY (3). William Walker bought 320 acres, as a land grant, on Country Line Creek in Rockingham (then Guilford) County, next to the property of Jeremiah Poston, on 1 March 1780 (Guilford Co. Deed Book 2, p. 140). He had applied for the grant in 1778. He sold a 61-acre portion of that land to Peter O'Neal in July, 1786 (Rockingham Co. Deed Book A, p. 121). William left a will, dated 13 December 1800, probated February 1801 (Book: Old Wills Discovered in Office Dated Prior to 1804, p. 258 - a collection of wills found at Rockingham Co. Courthouse dated before those of Will Book A).\n\nWilliam was buried at Haw River Presbyterian Church; his tombstone is still to be seen there. It is a thin slab of stone with a semicircular top at the approximate center of the grove where the cemetery is located. The marker reads as follows:\n\n14 DECEMBER 1800 W.W DC THIS LIFE IN THE 63 YEAR OF HIS AGE This stone is located with other Walker graves. The tombstone roughly 3' to the left of it bears the following inscription: M. WALKER 23 NOV 1813 IN THE 67 YEAR OF HIR AGE M. Walker is William's wife, Mary. The date tracks well with the probate date of her will. See information for Mary Walker.\n\nWill of William Walker, 13 December 1800 \"Old Wills Found In Office Dated Prior To 1804,\" Rockingham County, NC Divisees: Mary, his wife: 200 acres lying west of their home, All his stock and household furniture, All his plantation utensils, His slaves, except the one chosen by son Abram.

Walker of the same name is not certain, although there is a reasonably strong circumstantial case for it (see Notes for William W. Walker). Burial: Haw River Presbyterian Church cemetery\n\nNotes for MARY: Mary Walker left her own will, dated 13 November 1813, probated November 1813 (Rockingham Co. Will Book A, p. 98).

WILLIAM2 WALKER (WILLIAM1)3 was born 17674, and died March 11, 1835 in Rockingham County, NC, USA4. He married VILET5. William Walker was to receive $125 inheritance, according to his father's will (Will of William Walker, 13 December 1800, recorded in \"Old Wills Discovered in Office Dated Prior to 1804, p. 258). William was likely the same as the individual whose grave marker at Haw River Presbyterian Church indicates he died in March 1835.\n\nA county court record of March 1836 seems to correlate with this date. It describes a hearing held outside of the normal term schedule. At this hearing, one Talmon Walker was appointed to administer the estate of William Walker, deceased. Given that a family member was usually selected to act as the administrator of an estate, it is probable that Talmon was William's son.\n\nMinutes, Court of Pleas and Quarter Sessions for Rockingham County, NC, May 1835 to February 1840, p. 97 November Term 1835 At a called court held in the Clerk's Office on the 21st day of March A.D. 1836 Present Reubin Reed, Thomas Roach, Josiah Roberts and A.B.

Walker security - It was thereupon ordered by the court that the administrator have leave to sell such of the estate of said deceased as may be liable to waste, and return an inventory of the same to the next county court.

ALEXANDER1 WALKER1,2,3 died 1794 in Rockingham County, NC, USA4. He married ELIZABETH5. The earliest reference in public records to Alexander Walker was in 1778, the year he applied for a colonial land grant. That application came to fruition in October 1783 when the State of North Carolina sold him a 340-acre lot on Hogans Creek in Guilford County. The property eventually fell under the jurisdiction of Rockingham County when it was created by an act of the State Assembly in December 1785. It was in the southeastern corner of the county near the sources of Hogans Creek, Jiles Creek and Country Line Creek. A landmark of the region that existed in that era was Lennox Castle, a popular resort.\n\nWe know of Alexander Walker's wife Eliza(beth) and sons William E. and James from a 1794 court record and the division of his land by his two sons in 1835. An entry in the 1790 U.S. Census for Rockingham County suggests he may have had daughters, but there are no further references in that regard. Data from other census entries suggest that Elizabeth was born probably between 1750 and 1755. The partition of the land in 1835 may signal that she died in that year. Given these conclusions, Alexander was born probably in the late 1740's to early 1750's and died in 1794.\n\nMinutes, Court of Pleas and Quarter Sessions for Rockingham County, North Carolina, Book 2, p. 341, November Term 1794\n\n\"Eliza. Walker widow and relict of Alexander Walker decd and James Walker son came into court no will to be found and admd on said estate gave William Walker son in the sum of 500 pounds.\"\n\nRockingham County, NC, Deeds, Book 2G, p. 167, No. 5576, August Term 1836\n\nJames Walker & William Walker from Alexander Walker \"Whereas Alexander Walker late of Rockingham County State of North Carolina Intestate (1 word garbled) and possessed of a tract of land on both sides of Hogan's Creek in said county and whereas the existing laws of the county at the time of death of the said Alexander Walker caused or prescribed that lands of intestates should dec... to heirs male, the said Alexander leaving two sons him surviving, to wit William Walker and James Walker.... the said William and James Walker mutually agree to divide the said tract of land as follows:\"\n\nCourt appointed surveyor to divide the property equitably. William Walker received the western half of the property, which contained 162 acres. Dimensions: 139 poles from northwestern corner to northeastern corner, 180 poles from northeastern corner to southeastern corner, 149 poles from southeastern corner to southwestern corner, 182 poles from southwestern corner to northwestern corner. The lot was almost square, except that the eastern border was about 4 degrees off the perpendicular. Lot was adjoined on the west by property owned by Pierson, on the south by Pierson and Dellarce and on the east by his brother James.\n\nJames Walker's portion contained about 162 acres and was bordered on the east by Robert H. Scales and by a another property James already owned, on the south by Hill's and Dellarce's lines and on the west by his brother William. It was an oddly shaped lot, as if some land had been shaved off the eastern end. It measured 139 poles from northwestern corner to northeastern corner, \"south 8 degrees east 139 to his corner\" from the northeastern corner, 3 poles east, 45 poles to the southeastern corner and 149.5 poles from the southeastern corner to the southwestern corner. Hogan's Creek flowed through the boundary between James property and that of Robert Scales.\n\nThe deed is dated 12 December 1835 and was signed by William E. Walker and James Walker.\n\nCompare the overall dimensions of the lot described in the 1835 deed with the description in the land grant that Alexander Walker received in 1783:\n\nGuilford County, NC, Deed Book 2, p. 408 State of North Carolina Alexander Walker, 340 acres on both sides of Hogan's Creek at a cost of 50 shillings per hundred acres. Lot measured 299 poles east-to-west and 182 poles north-to-south.\n\nAlexander Walker was a brother of James Walker (died 1803). James gave a small property to Alexander's son James in 1803. The deed is clear that the younger James was the son of Alexander, who was already deceased. A summary of the deed follows:\n\nRockingham County, NC, Deed Book O, pp. 176, 177, No. 1781, August Term 1811\n\nWalker James, son of Alexr decd, from Walker James, Deed 49 acres of land\n\n\"This indenture made this 22nd day of May in the year eighteen hundred and three between James Walker in the County of Rockingham and State of North Carolina of the first part and James Walker son of Alexander Walker deceased in the same county and state aforesaid of the other part, Witnesseth that the said James Walker for and in consideration to him of the natural love and affection which he beareth unto his brother Alexander Walker's son James Walker, as also the consideration of the sum of ten pounds current and lawful money in hand paid, at and before the signing and sealing of these presents the receipt whereof he doth hereby acknowledge, hath given...unto the said James Walker, his heirs and assigns, forty-nine acres of land situate and lying on the waters of Hogans Creek in the County of Rockingham....\"\n\nA rectangular lot measuring 132 poles east-to-west by 60 poles north- to-south, bordered on the east and north by Nathaniel Scales, on the west by Alexander Walker and on the south by William Kellor.\n\n[Witnesses] Francis Hodge, Samuel Herron Walker, Robert Walker\n\n<Court Validation> Proved in open court by the oath of Robert Walker.\n\nThe identification of Alexander with the son of William W. Walker of the same name is not certain, although a circumstantial case can be made to support it (see Notes for William W. Walker).\n\nMore About ALEXANDER WALKER: Residence: October 14, 1783, Received grant of 340 acres on Hogans Creek in Guilford County, NC.\n\nNotes for ELIZABETH: Although Alexander Walker's widow is identified as Eliza in the 1794 court record, there is reason to believe that it is an abbreviation for Elizabeth. There appears to be a period at the end of the name in the court record. Additionally, the name Elizabeth Walker first appears in U.S. Census records for Rockingham County in 1800, and continues in census data through 1820.\n\nIn the 1800 record, the oldest female in the household is in the 45 years and older bracket. If this individual is indeed the widow of Alexander Walker, she could have been born no later than 1755. Her name is near William E. Walker in 1810 (hers is on page 231, his on page 232) and immediately preceeds his in 1820 (page 622). In this last reference, there is a single male person in the 26 to 44 year age bracket - James would have been 26 in 1820. Elizabeth's name does not appear in the 1830 Census, but the household of James Walker has a female member in the 70-79 age bracket, consistent with the earlier proposed date of birth. If this member of James' family were indeed his mother, this record would establish the earliest year of birth at 1750. One might assume that she died in 1835, the year that her sons divided their father's property.\n\nChildren of ALEXANDER WALKER and ELIZABETH are: 2. i.

In Dec. 1835, he and brother James divided the real estate of their father, Alexander, who had died intestate (Deed Book 2G, #5576, p 167). William, James and others donated land to Lowes Methodist Church in 1848. Following his death, William's estate was sold at auction for $3,995 to Jesse Waynick; the proceeds were presumably divided among Walker's children, as specified in his will.\n\nWill of William E.
