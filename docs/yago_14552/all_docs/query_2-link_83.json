        "text": "1852\n\nOn January 1, 1852, the Third Territorial Legislative Assembly created Hennepin County and a map filed at the Surveyor General’s office on, February 27, 1854, shows we belonged to Township No. 29 N., Range No. 24 W., 4th Meridian which included territory east of the Mississippi River and south of Cedar Lake. (Copy at Minneapolis Public Library). An 1860 map at the Minneapolis Public Library shows a lake just north of Crystal Lake and straight east of the southern tip of Lower Twin, named Armstrong. (Area of 44th and Drew Avenue). Nothing seemed to be platted; however, claims were being made starting in 1852. An 1874 map shows Crystal Township to be much smaller, extending only to the Mississippi and south to about 26th Avenue, North. (IHA) Mr. E. K. Jaques, in 1891, gave a beautiful description of Crystal Lake Township, “bound on the east by the Mississippi River, on the north by Brooklyn, on the west by Plymouth and on the south by Minneapolis, originally as far south as 26th Avenue North.” He describes the lakes and says they “abound in fish and from the southeast end of Lower Twin, a beautiful stream, the south branch of Shingle Creek, flows eastward through Armstrong Lake and empties into the Mississippi at Camden Place . . . Armstrong is the smallest of the four lakes in this town.” He describes Crystal Prairie, “four miles long and one mile wide starting at the southwest end of Crystal Lake extending northwesterly to the town line. Between this, prairie and the chain of lakes is a fine grove of timber, a favorite resort for and pleasure parties from Minneapolis.” (Later the site of MWA Park). The early settlement of Crystal Lake was almost coincident with that of Minneapolis itself. John Ware Dow was the first to file a claim in Crystal Lake Township. March 26, 1852. John C. Bohanon filed the next day. Later in the year came Mrs. Rhoda Bean and family, Joel and Eben Howe, John M. Snow. Hiram Armstrong. David Smith, George Camp and L. P. Warren. (The established price was $1.25 per acre.)\n\nArrivals to the Area\n\n1853\n\nC.Young\n\nC.

District # 1 was located in the village of Minneapolis, District #2 included nearly the whole northern section of the county. Mr. John Dow was notified of the fact by Colonel John H. Stevens, Clerk of the Board of County Commissioners. A school, taught by a Miss Smith was opened that same summer in a claim shanty, with less than a dozen pupils. This was the first school north of Minneapolis in Hennepin County.\n\nColonel John H. Stevens describes the history of the township as being “as uneventful and prosaic as that of any new community could possibly be. The settlers simply came in and took claims and made farms with little to annoy or trouble them, or to make them afraid, excepting the grasshopper raid of 1857. These pests did not make a total clean-up in Crystal Lake Township, as they did in some of the other new communities, and the people, fore, had something else besides ginseng to keep the wolf from the door during the long cold winter of 1857-58.”\n\nBut it is impossible to dismiss the pioneering days so quickly. The story of a few of the first settlers is suggestive of the industry and vision of group.\n\n1854\n\nAlfred Parker was born in Maine, in 1824, the son of a Methodist clergyman He served in the Mexican War, and went to California in the gold rush of ’49. After returning east, he came to Galena, Illinois, by rail, then up the river to St.Paul. He came to what is now Robbinsdale in 1854 and homesteaded a farm, which included the site of the former depot, just south of 42nd Avenue. His home stood near the former Howard Lumber Company office.The next year he married Elizabeth Malbon, daughter of Jonathan Malbon. During the early days the Indians often made raids on the Parker farms taking cattle, corn and other provisions. His new house, formerly at 4109 Lakeland was built by his father-in-law, J. S. Malbon, who turned it over to the Parkers. Then Mr. Malbon built the one north of it, 4115 Lakeland, for his own use. The Parker place was used as a stop over by travelers and teamsters hauling on the Bottineau road, now West Broadway. Both houses were torn down in the 1970’s as they were then in the center of the “commercial” area of the city.\n\nHoratio R. Stillman was born in 1832 in Ohio, and when he was 21, his father gave him $200 (to make his fortune). By making oars for boats, he was able to double it in the same year. In the fall he set out for Minnesota with his brother. To help pay the expenses of the journey, the party transported live stock with them, and after crossing the state of Illinois, were able to complete the trip by water. Upon arrival here, Mr. Stillman secured a span of horses and engaged in teaming, selling wood, and so on. He homesteaded (in 1854) the tract of land where the house (once the Stillman home, now the Faith Lilac Way Church) had stood for over 50 years. He erected a shanty and put in a wheat crop. After the spring of ’56 he devoted his entire attention to farming, clearing, and breaking land. After the fertility of the soil was exhausted for wheat, he found that it would produce a fine quality of hay. He equipped the farm for the dairy business, finding a ready market. for butter and cheese in nearby Minneapolis. In 1864, he served with the Eleventh Regiment. He was willing to take his part in civic affairs, serving at various times as Township Supervisor, Justice of the Peace, and School Board member. He died in 1920. He had one daughter, Maude Stillman Huston, who lived at 4155 Quail Avenue until 1963. A table from the Stillman farm was donated in 1982 to the Robbinsdale Historical Society by the William Driver, ]r. family. The table is on display at the Robbinsdale History Museum. Look for it to the left of the door when you walk in.\n\n1855\n\nMr. John P. Shumway, a native of Connecticut. took a claim in 1855 in Wright County, cleared five acres, and erected a bark shanty. Working without a team, he put in a small crop, sold it, and then went back to Connecticut. In 1856, he returned, purchased 45 acres at $25 each in Crystal Lake Township, where his home later stood, near Twin Lake. It was wild land and as a protection against the strong winds he often had to reinforce the walls of his house with props. He purchased a yoke of oxen, adding to his debt, and by the end of the year his deficit was $1,100. But by sturdy perseverance and hard work—sometimes setting out posts and building fences by moonlight—he managed to get 20 or 30 acres under cultivation, later increasing it to 70 acres.\n\nn 1890, he donated a half acre on the corner of Shumway Avenue and Shingle Creek Road (now Lakeland and 42nd) for the Congregational Church and parsonage. He was a charter member of the church and an active one for the rest of his life. He served as Township Treasurer for 20 years. In memory of his wife who died in 1914, he donated a stained-glass window for the original Congregational Church. His twin granddaughters, Esther and Evelyn, were well known in Robbinsdale as keepers of historical records.\n\n1860\n\nIn 1857 a State Constitution was ratified by the people and on May 11, 1858, Minnesota was admitted into the Union by an Act of Congress”, the 32nd State. The population in 1857 was 150,037. For some reason this community was not organized then as most of the towns were. It was a farming community and the settlers were more eager to clear the land and plant crops than in starting towns to make reading for later historians; but after a portion of the township was assigned by the County Commissioners to the town of Brooklyn, and another portion to Minneapolis, the residents decided to protect their interests. On March 24, 1860, a caucus was held in the home of J. S. Malbon to organize the township of Crystal Lake and commence its civil history. At that time it consisted of 24 sections (over 15,000 acres). Two tiers of sections from Brooklyn and two from Minneapolis were taken for this purpose. Crystal Lake Township was bounded on the east by the Mississippi River, on the south by the village of Minneapolis, on the north by Brooklyn township and on the west by Plymouth township. On April 3, 1860, again at Malbon’s home, an election was held and the following were named to offices:\n\nSupervisors;\n\nS. Plummer, Chairman\n\nJohn B. Johnson\n\nHenry S. Warren\n\nSupt. of Schools:\n\nR. Thompson\n\nTreasurer;\n\nZachariah GiIIespie\n\nConstables;\n\nWarren Willey\n\nS. Kales\n\nAssessor;\n\nLuther Bartlow (who failed to qualify and Josiah Dutton was appointed later.)\n\nJustices:\n\nS. Camp\n\nDavid Jones\n\nThe total vote cast at the meeting was 55 and when one considers that 55 represented the male population which had settled here within 8 years it is more impressive. The tax voted for all township purposes $200.00. A story told of the earliest town meeting (Township and town were used “rather loosely m the records but the civil unit was a township”) exemplifies the primitive political state. Every settler was so busy with his own affairs that none desired to serve as an officer. As soon as “men were nominated, they would decline to serve. N. R. Thompson was moderator. He examined the law and found that any freeholder unwilling to serve could be fined $50 and costs. “Gentlemen,” he announced, “I have no desire to interfere with any private affairs, but the next man elected as an officer of Crystal Lake Township who refuses to serve shall be fined $50” and read the’law. The offices were soon filled. Of the early settlers few became prominent in state or county affairs, but N. R. Thompson, who was the first moderator of the first town meeting, also became the first Superintendent of Schools in the town. He later was Sheriff of Hennepin County for four years and served several terms on the Minneapolis City Council.\n\nThe first religious group to organize was the Crystal Lake and Brooklyn Free Will Baptist Church. It was started in 1860 with six members, including the Stillmans, Merritts, and Thompsons. A church (pictured with the 1860 township map at the top of this post) was built in 1875 on land donated by Josiah Dutton (who came from Vermont in 1853) on the corner of Bass Lake Road and West Broadway, formerly called Jefferson Highway and earlier Bottineau Road. It was commonly called “The Little White Church.” The Robbinsdale Historical Society has a chair from that church. Some of the early settlers sold farms to a colony of Germans who were mostly Catholics, and in 1863 built their first building, using it for a school house as well as for services. In 1873 it was remodeled for exclusive church use and named St. Marie’s Catholic Church. Services were held there until 1914 when the parish was consolidated with Sacred Heart and the church torn down. Peter and John Schuller and Bernard Hommes had donated a five-acre tract for the church and cemetery, familiar to those who decorate the graves of veterans of so many wars on Memorial Day each year. The cemetery at 45th and Xylon Avenue North, originally St. Marie’s, is now called Assumption Cemetery and is managed by Gethsemane Cemetery.\n\n1861\n\nThe year following the organization of the township, the Civil War commenced. The town paid no bounties, but furnished its quota of men. In the Hennepin County “Roster of Military Men” are many familiar names:\n\nAnthony Trump\n\nJones\n\nBen and Samuel Rice George Forsaith\n\nEben, Samuel\n\nJoel Howe Horace Bohanon\n\nJoseph Gagne, Jr.\n\nIsrael Parker\n\nHamilton Bartlett\n\nCharles Libby Gilbert\n\nMerritt James Nash\n\nP. Shumway\n\nR. Stillman\n\nAnd others…\n\nRobbinsdale was just a twinkle in the eye Andrew B. Robbins when he joined the “Boys in Blue,” enlisting in the Eighth Regiment of Minnesota Volunteers, with which he served until the close of the Civil war. His company was on active duty in connection with the suppression of the Indian uprising under General Sully, going to the relief of Captain Fisk and later was sent south, where it was attached to General Schofield, Twenty-third Army Corps, participating in the second battle of Murfreesboro, and also in the battle of Franklin, Tennessee. Afterward the command was joined to General Sherman’s forces. Robbins saw active duty on some of the most hotly contested battle fields of the South. The future Mrs. Andrew B. Robbins, Adelaide Walker the Civil War helping her mother and her sister Helen with diets, linen room, dressings and “home letters” at Camp Chase and Tripler General Hospitals through Civil War and was granted “honorable discharge” by Dorothy Dix, chief of volunteer nurses.\n\n1862\n\nFollowing a cold spring in 1861, hard times came along. The Dakota War of ’62 did not affect the settlers here except to make them nervous. Horartio Stillman bundled his family into his wagon and took them to Minneapolis. A few pioneers gathered at the Dutton homestead north of town (near the Bass Lake Road and Jefferson Highway intersection), converted it into a small fortress, and resolved to fight it out. After several anxious days, the danger passed without a sight of any of the marauding bands that were terrorizing the communities. (In a 1938 interview, the Duttons recalled the tribal wars of the Sioux and Chippewas, when their campfires burned brightly within a few miles of the city. Frequent bands of Indians would ride up to the homestead, sometimes to demand lodging, sometimes food—the requests were always granted!)\n\nhe Dakota War of 1862 completely destroyed whole towns—such as New Ulm. Settlers like those pictured at the top of this post fled to escape violence. Perhaps our area was spared because Pierre Bottineau’s mother was a Native American, so he no doubt was a peace “go-between.” Bottineau was a scout for General Sibley and visited the Osseo area in 1852 and later came back to claim what was once known as Bottineau’s Prairie. The 1854 Pierre Bottineau House, located near the chalet in Elm Creek Park Reserve has been restored and is in use as a museum. The road to Osseo (West Broadway up to Osseo was, as late as 1904, called Bottineau Road; later, Jefferson Highway; and now, West Broadway.\n\n1863\n\nIn all pioneer communities there comes a time when people decide to bury their loved ones in an official cemetery — rather than under a favorite tree on the home farm. On November 20, 1863, a group of citizens from Brooklyn and Crystal Townships met to organize an association for the “purpose of a cemetery and burriel of the dead.” Many meetings were held; the first land purchased from W. G. Jaques was determined to be too low and the present site was purchased from Thomas P. Hill. It was called Brooklyn-Crystal Cemetery and located four and a half miles north of Rockford Road on West Broadway. The first lots were sold in 1867 and several bodies were moved in from scattered locations, including five Getchell children. Alvah Getchell, age 19, was killed in action against the Indians in 1862. Four younger children died the next year. No record could be found as to the cause. This cemetery is the final resting place of many early (and later) Robbinsdale residents Shumway, Nassett, Malbon, Crandall, Jaques, Parker, Newell, Stillman, Patch, Johnson, and Bartlett, to name a few.\n\nAccording to the Brooklyn-Crystal Cemetery Association‘s website, The initial tract of land where the cemetery is now located was purchased from Thomas P. Hill for $30.00. On September 1, 1896, an additional tract was purchased from Adolph Hartkopf.\n\nOver the years many Robbinsdale people have been officers of the association including D. C. Crandall, Wm. Stinchfield, Pierce Malbon, W. H. Johnson, V. D. Crandall, Thomas Kirkwood, G. Merritt, A. J. Coulter, Julius Sessing, and E. N. Russ.\n\nIn recent years it has become difficult to identify the living owners of many of the grave sites. Ownership within families is passed to the surviving spouse, oldest living child or another designated person. Owners often sell or donate unused grave sites back to the Association. The cemetery and the memory of those who now rest there is a gift to anyone interested in the early days Robbinsdale and the surrounding area.\n\nThe Brooklyn-Crystal Cemetery Association is a non-profit organization. All donations are very welcome and help fund their expenses and grounds maintenance.\n\n1865\n\nAfter the Civil War ended and the military reservation was reduced, the settlement of Minneapolis, Crystal Lake, and other towns developed rapidly. The first school for District No. 24 was built in 1865 was located on the Stillman farm at about 4342 Adair Avenue, it served for 25 years as a school, later being used for a dwelling then torn down and the lumber used in the construction of a barn. The school was a focal point for grange meetings, spelling bees, singing school, Sunday school, town meetings and elections. School was held off and on during the year when the children were not needed to work in the fields. Often school was closed because there was no wood for the stove or when there was an epidemic of measles or diphtheria. On the last day of school, parents were invited to a program and sometimes the pupils received a little gift from the teacher—such as a pencil. (Pencils were sharpened by a knife in those days.)\n\n1870\n\nThe population of Crystal Lake township was 718. Besides farming, a few industries developed. The first was a shingle mill at Shingle Creek, built in 1852 (everyone needed shingles!) and then a flour mill in 1859. In 1876 brickyards were opened near the Mississippi River. Then in 1878 the Camden area was, by the legislature, attached to Minneapolis. In 1875 a hotel was built on the south shore of Crystal Lake by Anton Wolf (above) . It was used especially by sportsmen during the hunting season. Other similar places opened, not only for hunters, but as a halfway house for those going to and from Minneapolis with produce from places as far away as Corcoran, Osseo, and Buffalo, as these were too far for a one-day round trip with horses and wagons.\n\n1880\n\nThe first railroad through the community was called the Minneapolis Branch of the St. Paul, Minneapolis, and Manitoba Railroad , later the Great Northern Railroad Company. In 1880 a flag station was established, merely a designated spot and if you wished a ride, you would “flag” the train. A depot was built about 1887. It was called Parker Station in honor of Mr. Alfred Parker who donated three acres of land for its site. When the depot was built, Mrs. H. W. Downs (above) was depot master. In 1888 double tracks were laid so trains could pass each way. On November 14, 1888, a telegraph office was installed and by 1893 Great Northern trains went all the way to the West Coast .\n\nJoseph “Ed” Riddell was telegrapher from 1927 to 1947. A larger station was built in 1948 with a freight house to serve the lumber yards. The depot was torn down in 1967 after the railroad discontinued its use as a freight station.\n\n1887\n\nIn 1886 Minneapolis made an effort to annex all bordering townships to secure more taxable property and money for improvements and perhaps to outclass St. Paul in population. At once, the people of Crystal arose to action and got a special act of the Legislature early in 1887 to incorporate. Thus the village of Crystal was incorporated in January 11, 1887, and included 16 of the original 24 sections (square miles) having already lost much to Minneapolis, including the beautiful area from Xerxes to the Mississippi. By this time the homes were no longer the rough board shanties of 33 years before, but spacious well appointed houses and barns, belonging to the white haired men who by years of toil had won them from the earth. This was a highly favored section, never visited by pestilence (since the 1857 grasshoppers) or famine: there was always a seed time and a harvest. The new village included Crystal and Twin Lakes, Crystal Prairie, and on the west the timber already mentioned. The election held March 8, 1887, selected these officers:\n\nPresident:\n\nArthur Sandborn\n\nTrustees;\n\nThomas Gearty\n\nH. White\n\nPhilip Kuch\n\nRecorder;\n\nF. Russ\n\nTreasurer;\n\nB. Johnson\n\nJustices of the Peace:\n\nC. Crandall\n\nR. Stillman\n\nConstable:\n\nCharles Hommes\n\nAssessor;\n\nThomas Kirkwood\n\n(In 1888, 0. W. Newell and George Swift were named Justices; E. K. Jaques, a trustee; W. H. Johnson, President of the Board; and these were reelected each year for the next five years.)\n\nOn January 9, 1887, school was cancelled because a tramp had broken into the school house on the Stillman farm, burned the teacher’s Bible and some of the scholars’ books and stole the teacher’s watch. A few days later Mr. and Mrs. Stillman canvassed the town for money and presented Louise Kirkwood, the teacher, with a gold watch.\n\nIn 1887, local legends report that while passing through the village on a train, Mr. Andrew B. Robbins was so pleased with the beauty of this part of the country that he could not get the memory out of his mind. He saw that because of its proximity to Minneapolis, and its many natural advantages, scenic and otherwise, it could become the best residential section in the Northwest. So he bought 90 acres of land from Alfred Parker, John Shumway, George Brimhall, and David Malbon and proceeded to plat what he called Robbinsdale Park, planning to make it the site of a suburban town such as is found close to the larger cities of the East. He was concerned with everything connected with the advancement of the village. He chose the location because it was slightly rolling, a well-drained tract, with a fine view of the lakes from many points. He personally set out long lines of trees to add to the natural beauty of the village.\n\nIn 1890 he built a large home near Twin Lake, on a twenty-acre tract which he landscaped with a great variety of trees and shrubs. (When the Highway Department was forced to cut many of them to make way for the new highway in the early thirties, the workers said they had never seen such a variety of trees in one place.) Andrew Robbins was born in Maine in 1845, His family moved to Anoka in 1855 where his father built the first steam saw mill. Robbins married Adelaide Walker and moved to Willmar where he later became Mayor and served in the State Senate. In 1887 he bought the 90 acres and moved to Robbinsdale and was the village’s first council president in 1893. In his real estate ventures he also platted A. B. Robbins Brookside Park in Richfield at West 54th Street between Thomas and Vincent Avenues South which included a bit of Minnehaha Creek. He died in 1910.\n\nLars I. Nasett came from Wisconsin with his uncle, L. J. Nasett, who was drawing plans for the Lutheran Seminary. His wife and family came a year later. The streetcar line ended at 18th and Washington Avenues North, and the Nasetts were obliged to hike the rest of the five or six miles. Lars bought land from A. B. Robbins in July,. 1888, and immediately erected the first store in what is now Robbinsdale and opened for business September 21, 1888. The family lived in rooms over the store for 40 years. Advertisements from the 1893 “Picturesque Robbinsdale” say, “Nasett and Bro.—General Merchandise – groceries a specialty – tinware made and repaired – all kinds of jobbing and tinwork done.” Mr. P. J. Linde was his partner for a time, in charge of the repair shop. Mr. Nasett vas much involved in early Robbinsdale. He was a Trustee on the village council for two terms, village assessor off and on for 22 years and also serveded as Village Health Officer. He was succeeded as assessor by J. Clifford Boies. Mr. Nasett was the first Postmaster of Crystal Village, cantilling his first letter in 1888. (Until then the post office had been located at Shingle Creek, now Camden.) He alternated being Postmaster with George Swift who owned the drug store; when the Democrats were in office, he had the job, but when Republicans were in, Mr. Swift had the job at his drug store. By 1910 he was station agent for the Great Northern Railroad and after World War I his son, Lawrence, returned from service and took the job of postmaster until 1934. Lars died in 1937.\n\nMr. Nasett had a well and a pump in front of the store. People came from miles around for water. He had the water tested at the University and it was found to be some of the best in the state. The pump needed repairs because of its hard use and, getting tired of paying the bills for this public service, he asked the village to pay for the upkeep. Getting “no” for an answer, he buried the pump under the sidewalk where it no doubt still is. The Nasett store stood on the north side of 42nd Avenue just west of West Broadway.\n\n1888\n\nThe late 1880’s were busy ones for this area. Haakon Christensen, born in Oslo, Norway, in 1859, first visited Robbinsdale to attend the laying of the cornerstone of the Seminary. He returned shortly after, bought land from Mr. Robbins, and built his blacksmith shop in 1888. This shop stood for a long time at the southeast corner of Crystal Lake Avenue and Shingle Creek Road, now West Broadway and 42nd. He was actively engaged “in business here for over fifty years He shod thousands of horses, repaired farm tools, etc. He fulfilled his civic duties as well by serving on the board of trustees of the village from 1893 for at least 20 years. (According to the RobbinsdaJe Post, December 8, 1938, he was still in business, at age 79.) He died in March 1945, at the age of 85.\n\nIn 1888 the Village Hall for Crystal Village was erected on Jefferson Highway (now West Broadway) from plans drawn by Mr. L. J. Nasett, uncle of Lars. The hall was described by Mrs. Stillman, 47 years later, as “our pride and joy.” When it was dedicated, she said she had never seen so much food in her life—everyone in town furnished! It was a two-story brick building, costing between $2,500 and $3,000, on a quarter-acre lot donated by Mr. Jonathan S. Malbon and his son-in-law, Alfred Parker. When the village of Crystal, was dissolved in 1893, Parker purchased the hall The VilIage Hall of for $500 and the land went back to the Parkers and the Malbons. When Robbinsdale officially became a village in 1893. Parker offered the hall back for $500, but the Malbon family received $2000 for the two lots. In 1936 a $5,000 addition was made. In spite of the fact that the land was to be always used for public purposes, the Village Hall was torn down in 1954 to make way for a municipal liquor store that was never built. The land became for a much-needed parking lot for a Red Owl grocery store. The Village Hall stood on the other side of the driveway north of Ace Hardware and the Urban Block on West Broadway. The Village Hall was used for many things: by the Salvation Army for Sunday afternoon and evening services, by the Congregational Church on Sunday mornings before their church was built, for school entertainments and plays on the tiny stage, for library books before the library was built. for fire equipment in the shed behind, and for frequent dance parties because it had the best floor in the area. Voters had to climb the long, dark, steep stairs in the rear to cast their ballots. The summer of 1888 brought our first land boom. The result was that thirteen houses were built. Mr. Nasett manufactured much of the tinware for them. [A dwelling would cost about $1,200,) The “Big Three” in the founding of the village were Mr. Nasett, Mr. Parker, and Mr. Robbins. They were all so modest [or so they said) that no one wanted the town named after him. Mr. Parker eventually sent the papers for a post office, calling it ROBBINSDALE. Difficulties arose—the Government insisted that the same name be used for the post office and the railroad station! However, it was comparatively easy to get the railroad to change the name from Parker to Robbinsdale, but for a while we were blessed with three names. Crystal Village, Parker Station and Robbmsdale Post Office! The name of the civil organization was not changed until 1893.\n\n1889\n\nMr. Robbins’ second business in Robbinsdale was a street car factory. It was near the car barn on Hubbard Avenue. The new factory began work on October 15, 1889, and by December 19, there were six cars ready to ship to Ohio. Expansion soon was needed and an addition was built in 1891, but on May 7, 1892, it burned down and it was thought best not to rebuild. The Northern Car Company manufactured street railway and other cars, employing 150-200 men and could manufacture seven cars per week. The cars were equal to, if not superior to, any in the country. Mr. Robbins was president of the company.\n\nThe first religious services in what is now Robbinsdale were held in the Village Hall by a band of Salvation Army workers from Minneapolis. On May 5, 1889, the Congregational Sunday School was organized with 70 members. 0. W. NeweII was the Superintendent, and the teachers were Mrs. J. P. Shumway, N. F. Russ, Elder Woodworth, L. C. Roth. The church was called the First Congregational Church of Parker and was organized June 16, 1889 with 28 charter members. The Christian Endeavor Society was started July 22, 1889; and the Ladies Aid on July 8, with 16 charter members. The Ladies Aid met at the home of Mrs. H. W. Downs. Their first meeting was in the new Village Hall, July 31. 1889.\n\nDuring the early days, the children came an hour each time to learn to sing. The first disbursement was $11.00 for singing books. A Pulpit Bible, carpet for the platform, and dishes were among the first purchases. At the twentieth anniversary party held at the Shumway home in 1909, Mrs. Shumway, the first president, presided and eight of the sixteen charter members answered roll call. In twenty years they had raised $3,000, and met every week, rain or shine. Rev. Votaw was the acting pastor until 1891 when Rev. A. D. Fanning became the regular pastor. In 1890 the congregation voted to erect a church building. It was built on land donated by John Shumway at 42nd Avenue and Bottineau Boulevard after the building was ready for occupancy the church was dedicated on May 24, 1891. An impressive dedication service was held, with the Silver Lake Choir furnishing the music, and four pastors doing the preaching. Pastors with long service records were Donald G. Colp (later an M.D. practicing in Robbinsdale), James E. Ball, W. W. Dale, George Macauley and Wayne B. Robinson.The First Congregational Church of Parker later became the First Congregational Church of Robbinsdale In 1961 the church building was sold to another church group (demolished in 1965) and a beautiful new church was built at 4200 Lake Road. Other property was platted. Mr. Alfred Parker platted Parker’s Addition to Robbinsdale Park and Mr. Brimhall platted Brimhall’s Addition to Robbinsdale Park. The business tact and persuasive powers of these men and others attracted several institutions to the community: The Northern Car Shops, near the present water tank site; Hubbard Specialty Manufacturing Company, north of the Car Shops, along the tracks, which made wheelbarrows, furniture, awnings, and so on; and Luther Seminary.\n\nThe Luther Theological Seminary Seminary, was situated on a ten-acre tract on College, now Regent Avenue, on land donated by George Brimhall, Alfred Parker, and A. B. Robbins. The school stood at 4001 Regent. It was a Seminary of the Norwegian Lutheran Church and was dedicated on September 8, 1889, before an audience of 5,000 people, programs in those days demanded a rugged audience; there were addresses by Governor Merriam, Senator Knute Nelson, University President Cyrus Northrop, sermons by the Seminary faculty and others. German, Swedish, Norwegian, and English were used in the talks. The buildings were planned to accommodate 700 students eventually, but 45 was the enrollment for most of its existence. The lodging and instruction were free—board was $1.50 to $2 a week. Mrs. Etta Gates described the school as a massive brick building, imposing with its towers, stone trimming, and curving drives, beautifully landscaped with trees and shrubs. The Ylvisaker home, later the Swift home, was nearby. The basement of the Seminary housed the eating and cooking facilities; the president of the Seminary had his apartments and library on one of the upper floors. The Luther Theological Seminary was destroyed by fire on the very cold morning of January 11, 1895—in less than one hour. It was later rebuilt on Como Avenue in St. Paul.\n\nMr. Robbins was also president of the Hubbard Manufacturing Company. Hubbard had sold out to the Sweatt Manufacturing Company which enlarged the plant and made grocery boxes, wooden wheelbarrows, camp furniture and wooden washing machines. In 1891 William R. Sweatt also invested $1,500 in the Electric Thermostat Company which made a control connecting a thermostat to a motor to operate home “dampers flappers”. He became a director of the company. After the fire in 1892 in Robbinsdale, Sweatt expanded his office on East 26th Street to include the Sweatt Manufacturing Company. By 1902 Sweatt owned the Electric Heat Regulator Company, and changed the name to Minneapolis Heat Regulator Company in 1912. In 1927, it merged with Honeywell Heating Specialties Company Sweatt as Chairman of the Board and Mark C. Honeywell as president- This is.included in our history because it is often said that Sweatt Manufacturing Company was the forerunner of Honeywell. That’s not really correct, but William R. Sweatt was certainly involved.\n\n1890\n\nThis was a busy year for the Robbinsdale area. John Trump built a general merchandise store where the Wicked Wort is today. He enlarged his store, selling hardware in half of it. In 1896 he bought a feed mill from Mr. Cannon. He paid $850 for it and operated it for many years to serve the local farmers. He probably was most widely known for his boats and boat landing on Twin Lake. Oars, fishing poles, and bait were available at his store. He served on the fire department and his bulldog took an especial delight in following the fire department to all fires. He was village treasurer for 15 years. Mrs. Trump was active, too. She was a charter member of Library Club and the first president of the Sacred Heart Rosary Society. Mr. Trump died in 1927. His son, John Trump, served as Village clerk for eight years.\n\nA new grade school was built, a necessity because of the added homes. The citizens thought the new building would be large enough for all timeThe School Board consisting of L. A. Taylor Chairman; H.R Stillman, Clerk; and Jarius Russ, Treasurer. authorized the raising of $10,000 in taxes “District 24 secured one of the finest school buildings in the state, known as the Parker School, in honor of Alfred Parker.\n\nA brick building, with stone basement and trim. elegant in design, convenient in arrangement, supplied with all modern equipment, consists of eight rooms—four large school rooms, besides cloak rooms, office, and so on—exquisitely finished in oak. The basement contains the gymnasium and furnace room. It is well graded and will probably become one of the State High Schools within the next year.” So ran the account in the 1895 report of Hennepin County. It was heated with steam. There was a pond behind the school, especially deep in the spring, and Robert W. Girod, now a pastor living in Polar, Wisconsin, recalls a boy drowning in the pond.\n\nThere was no high school in the area until 1936 so those students who wished a high school education had to attend either North, Edison, or Marshall High Schools in Minneapolis. Students from area farms often stayed in town, working for room and board, and could then take the streetcar to high school. If they didn’t have the three cents streetcar fare (five cents by 1916), some would walk home from North High-some four or five miles.\n\nThe Hotel Georgia Temperance House, a beautiful three-story wooden structure, was erected by C. T. Griffith a cost of $7,000, started in August, 1890. It was ready for occupancy on November 1, 1890. The hotel was was located near where Wuollet Bakery now stands (4139 West Broadway). It had 23 bedrooms, a large double parlor and meals were served family style. Many of furniture workers stayed here as well as the Seminary students after the 1895 fire. In 1903 it was owned by J. Coulter and the name changed to Columbia Hotel (pictured above). Later it was purchased by W. D. Bartlett who remodeled it. School classes were held there during the expansion of the Parker School in 1921. It had a large front porch where elderly citizens liked to sit. In the Robbinsdale Park Progress in 1904, Coulter advertised “Special attention given to entertainment of sleighing or trolley parties from the city.” It was finally torn down to make room for a drug store owned by Henry J. Barnett. This he sold to Morris W. Henney about 1939. His son, William Henney, ran the drugstore from 1953 to 1963. . It was then sold to Braun’s Bakery and then the Wuollet Bakery.\n\nBy 1890, in addition to the Trump Grocery Store, the Nasett and Linde Store, J. J. Coulter’s Meat Market, Christensen’s Blacksmith Shop, Irwin’s Wagon Making Shop, the town could now boast of a Barber Shop (Mr. Mitchell), Peter Yarkanson’s Shoemaking Shop, George Swift’s Drug Store and Post Office. There were two railroads— the Great Northern which ran south to north, and the Soo, an east to west line And then a physician, Dr. C. A. Donaldson, known for his gentlemanly qualities and professional skill, came and had a residence on Crystal Lake.\n\n1891\n\nMr. Robbins was interested in attracting people to the village and in order to make it more convenient for those who might live here and continue to carry on business in the city, he tried to secure better transportation facilities. He was unable to convince the Minneapolis Street Railway Company of the desirability of extending their lines to Robbinsdale, so he organized the North Side Street Railway Company (Mr. Robbins was the president), and in early 1891, built a road from the city limits to Robbinsdale Park, using the same weight of rails and the same gauge as that used for Minneapolis streetcars. On June 1, 1891, the line opened for business, operated by horsecars for some time. By 1893 a gasoline motor replaced the horses. It connected with the Minneapolis line at Penn and 32nd Avenue (Lowry) and came out as far as Johnson Road (36th Avenue North). Later it was extended via Hubbard Avenue to 42nd Avenue North and later via West Broadway to 42nd. Turntables were installed at 42nd Avenue and West Broadway and at Penn Avenue and a barn was built for shelter. The cars carried 20 people. In the winter a stove was put in the center of the car for warmth. By 1893 there was a separate engine car and a trailer car for the passengers. On January 14, 1897, the car barns and equipment were destroyed by fire. At the next election, February 13, 1897, voters approved an electric line by a unanimous vote and new cars started running on April 18.\n\nGus Urban, an employee of J. J. Coulter Meat Market, joined with Ed Bodem to purchase the meat market. In 1882 Urban became sole owner until 1922 when Kurt Hoffman bought it. In 1938 prices listed in ads were pork loin roasts, 20 cents a pound; pork chops, end cut, 18 cents a pound; sugar cured picnics, 18 cents a pound. In 1960 Herbert, Harold, and Reinhart Hackenmueller bought the meat market from Kurt Hoffman’s son, Kurt, and changed the name to Hackenmueller Meats (4159 West Broadway). They ran the meat market for twenty years, selling to Gordon Lindenfelsor in 1980. The meat market is by far the oldest continuing business in Robbinsdale in the same spot.\n\n1892\n\nAt this time our area of Crystal Village seemed to be referred to as Robbinsdale Park because the platted areas were named A. B. Robbins First Addition to Robbinsdale Park,” “Brimhall’s First Addition to Robbinsdale Park,” etc. John Shumway, Nathan Russ, Alfred Parker, Charles Sandborn, H. R. Stillman, C. E. Tyler and others still had large unplatted areas, evidently were still farming, according to an 1898 Atlas. This map showed no Armstrong Lake, possibly it had become a marsh by then. The house pictured above at about 44th and West Broadway was owned by A.B. Robbins and rented to the village blacksmith, Haakon Christensen. Pictured out front in 1890 from left to right are Alfred Parker, Elizabeth and Raleigh Parker, Fred Baker, Jr. and his aunt, Mrs.Guptel, and Mrs Christensen. The house was struck by lightning and burned to the ground in the early 1900’s.\n\n1893\n\nThomas H. Girling, born in England in 1865, had considerable impact as a publisher and civic leader in Robbinsdale. He had learned the printing business and in February, 1893, started publishing the weekly “Picturesque Robbinsdale.” He took the lead in getting the Crystal Hill cut down nine feet and the road graded and later paved. The steep hill on Crystal Avenue (now West Broadway near Minneapolis) was a much-travelled road those days, with teams lining up in caravans, ten or twenty in a line. The steep hill was a real problem. The saloon fund was in good condition, then as now, and the council voted $1,000 out of this fund if the County Commissioners would vote $2,000, which they did, for cutting down the hill.\n\nHe later worked to get the road to Osseo paved (now West Broadway) and later the Rockford Road in 1922. He was also Robbinsdale’s second mayor.\n\nIn a March, 1893, issue of “Picturesque Robbinsdale” edited by Mr. Girling, this news item appeared: “A telephone has been ordered and now is in place in the Drug Store of George Swift. This is something the village has needed and will be very useful in case of fire or sickness and will save a good many trips to Minneapolis for those who can very often transact their business by telephone.” George Swift had been the town druggist for many years and the Robbinsdale Village Treasurer in 1893 and 1894. He had been born in Boston in 1848 and at age 13 enlisted as drummer boy at Ft. Snelling and in 18621865 marched with General Sherman through Georgia. He retired in 1914 and died in 1936 at the age of 88. He was also postmaster when the Republicans were “in power.” The Stillman’s new house was completed that summer, a house with exceptional equipment for those days. It had fourteen rooms and hot water heat, something not many homes even in the city had in 1893.\n\nn December 4, 1893, the editor, Mr. Girling, became the proud father of a baby girl, Amy, the first child born in the village of Robbinsdale. He apologized for any omissions in the issue and promised to furnish all his “lady acquaintances with chewing gum and his gentlemen friends with a high grade Chandler Cheroot.” Amy died in 1976. Another daughter, Elizabeth (Betty) was a well-known story teller and radio announcer for 33 years, on WLB, KUOM, the Minnesota School of the Air.\n\nH. Girling was also a state legislator for about 10 years until his death following an automobile accident on Bass Lake Road in 1924. The weekly started by Thomas Girling in February, 1893, “Picturesque Robbinsdale,” contains many fascinating items. When one reads an advertisement such as this one, how could one resist?\n\nTo Shrewd Investors who desire a Suburban Home\n\nEither for a Residence or for Speculation\n\nOne which has the advantages of\n\nPURE AIR, PURE WATER, FINE DRIVEWAYS\n\nFINE LAKES, AND BEAUTIFUL SCENERY\n\nGRADE SCHOOLS, CHURCHES, STREET CAR LINE\n\nMaking direct connection on Hennepin Avenue\n\nCall on Alfred Parker, Robbinsdale.\n\nImprovements, such as new roads, which made life more pleasant for the residents of the urban community, led to resentment by the people in the thinly settled, strictly agricultural areas. A special election was held on March 24, 1893 and the vote to dissolve the Village of Crystal carried unanimously. On April 19, 1893, Robbinsdale was organized as a village, consisting of three sections of the original twenty-four of the township. The name ROBBINSDALE was made official.\n\nThe new officers were:\n\nPresident; A. B. Robbins\n\nRecorder: John Hayes\n\nTreasurer: George Swift\n\nTrustees;\n\nLars J. Nasett\n\nThomas H. Girling\n\nHaakon Christensen\n\nThe farm owners on the margins of the village made their choices as to whether they would stay with the old village of Crystal or come with the new village of Robbinsdale. Mr. Stillman chose to come with Robbinsdale, thereby creating a jog in the western boundary of the village. After the Village of Crystal was dissolved and Robbinsdale was organized, the remaining land reverted back to the original township of Crystal Lake. The Town Board in 1895 consisted of Paris Reidhead, Chairman: Philip Kuch and V. D. Crandall, Supervisors; Jarius Russ, Clerk; C. F. McCausland, Treasurer. According to Col. Stevens, writing in 1895 “The township has just completed a creditable town hall.” (At about 54th and West Broadway.)\n\n1894\n\nIn January people in Robbinsdale were advised to arm themselves when traveling on Crystal Lake Avenue to Minneapolis after dark, after B.J. Browning had been held up by robbers while returning home after selling a load of hay. With drawn guns, three men took his money and watch. They were caught and sentenced to five years in jail.\n\nWilliam Randall and George “Don” Johnson (above) started Robbinsdale Ice and Fuel Co. and began cutting ice on Crystal Lake in the 1890’s. Johnson is standing nearest the horses. Over on Twin Lake the Crystal Ice Company cut up to 25,000 tons. In the 1920’s the Cedar Lake Ice Company began staking out territory on Crystal Lake. The ice was packed in sawdust and usually lasted through the summer. Many private parties and ice companies were cutting ice in Crystal Lake. On account of the “extreme clearness and purity, this ice is considered the best that can be had around Minneapolis.\n\nThere were parties and dances galore in the Town Hall that winter but all was not sweetness and light in those early days either. The dumping of trash, especially dead animals, on Crystal Lake Avenue and the Johnson Road (36th Avenue) caused Thomas Girling to warn Health Officer Kelly of Minneapolis to steer clear of the village limits as the streets mentioned, “are lined with decayed fish, over-ripe eggs, one long-deceased hog, several dogs, cats, garbage, etc.\n\nIn June Miss Edith Robbins graduated from the University of Minnesota with a Bachelor of Science degree. All five of the Robbins daughters graduated from the University, with two of them earning Masters Degrees as well. It was a splendid sight to see Mr. Robbins and his five daughters, all so beautifully dressed, sitting together in the congregational church, filling the pew completely. Edith (Mrs. Daniels) served this school District No. 24, for many years as a Board Member.\n\nIn July, 1894, Girling reported a step in the right direction: “The citizens have organized a fire company with a membership of 44. The chief is J. J. Coulter, with Thomas H. Girling as Secretary. The company will equip itself with ladders, hooks, axes, buckets, etc., and in a short time will get a chemical. Regular meetings will be held to drill.” There were several benefits given, one a supper and entertainment which netted $32, with the donations all listed and the donors as well. Five gallons of potato salad, three gallons of ice cream, fifteen pounds of ham, a bushel of apples, pies, besides buns, pickles, and twenty-nine cakes! Another benefit held on December 21, 1894, emphasized the program and confined the refreshments to coffee and sandwiches. The program included a harmonica solo; L. I. Nasett; Recitation—”Flash, the Fireman’s Horse”—Roy Shumway; Tableau—”The Lovers Discovered”—Howard Russ, Hattie Coulter, Anna Johnson, J. J. Coulter; A farce—”Is the Editor In?”—Hattie Hawkins, Hattie Coulter, and others.\n\nEarlier that fall a benefit for the Hinckley fire sufferers was held and a Fair and Supper by the Ladies’ Aid was a “complete success” with the receipts going to the church debt. All this, mind you, when hard times were on the people. Houses built by Mr. Robbins and others were practically deserted or renting for $1.50 a month.\n\nLicensing the saloons was the main campaign issue in 1894. Nathan Russ, who ran for recorder and H. R. Stillman, who was a candidate for council, were both defeated largely because they favored licensing. It was rumored that Mr. Stillman even favored prohibition. The “drys” were never able to make Robbinsdale “Dry” until the 18th Amendment to the Federal Constitution was passed. Victors in the election were Andrew B. Robbins, president; John W. Hayes, recorder; Thomas H. Girling, Lars I. Nasett and Haakon Christenson, Councilmen; George E. Swift, treasurer; Thomas J. Helmick and William Forsyth, justices of the peace; Martin Garrett and John Peterson, Constables; and Alfred Malbon, street commissioner. Robbins was also Superintendent of the Robbinsdale Congregational Church at this time.\n\n1895\n\nThe new year brought a great loss to the village in the destruction of the Lutheran Seminary building by fire on January 11, 1895. It was a severely cold, windy disagreeable day and the flames spread rapidly; in less than an hour only a smoldering ruin remained. The loss of the building and its contents, valued at $30,000 was total. No insurance was carried. Professor Stub’s large library and elegant piano were lost as well as nearly all the possessions of the students. Many were injured by bums and others had frozen hands or feet. Arrangements were made to house the students in private homes and at the Hotel Georgia for the rest of the year. School was held at the hotel. The Seminary students worked at roadwork and helped lay the street car tracks. At election times (between 1889 and 1895) some citizens grumbled because the students had the right to vote—after all they “don’t pay taxes and aren’t interested in the affairs of the village,” according to Jack Coulter. The school was rebuilt on Como Avenue in St. Paul.\n\n1896\n\nThe February 22, 1904, issue of the Robbinsdale Park Progress gave tribute to a pioneer, George L. Brimhall, who died on September 17, 1896. In 1876 he purchased a farm of 160 acres on the southeast comer of Crystal Lake. He was largely instrumental in securing the location of Luther Seminary, was the treasurer of the Hubbard Specialty Manufacturing Company, and helped financially with the Robinson Moen Car Company (afterwards the Northern Car Company).\n\n1897\n\nThe North Side Street Railway company which operated a “dummy railroad” between Minneapolis and Robbinsdale changed it’s motor from gasoline to electricity after residents of Robbinsdale had subscribed $2000 stock in the concern which allowed the change to be made. A handsome new trolley car was been placed on the track and made half hour trips each way between Robbinsdale and 32nd Avenue North and Penn Avenue.\n\n1898\n\nIn 1898, John Bloberger, Sr. came to Robbinsdale, and was the first Chief of Police. He was also one of the first fire chiefs in the state. Bloberger was a resident of Robbinsdale for 46 years. Many of them were spent in his home at 3850 Noble Avenue. The life of a fireman was not easy in those days—it was often necessary to pull the truck by hand through snow drifts to reach the other side of the tracks. Bloberger’s son John Bloberger, Jr. followed in his father’s footsteps as a constable and a patrolman.\n\n1899\n\nDuring the winter of 1899-1900, Isaac Patch (pictured above), concerned about the availability of reading matter, toured, by horse and buggy, the farms between Robbinsdale and Medicine Lake and got the required fifty signatures requesting rural free delivery of mail. It was started in 1900 under local Post Office Authority until October l, 1901, when the Federal Post Office Department formally approved the route, authorizing $500 per annum. The area was so large that two routes were established and Isaac Patch(above) and Charles Heiff were the first two postal men, delivering by horse and buggy. The Minneapolis papers, the Tribune and the Daily News, competed for subscriptions by offering free mail boxes as premiums—the Daily News offering blue and the Tribune, silver. The farmers had to mount them on posts by the road. Patch’s parlor was piled high with mail boxes waiting to be delivered; and his five year old daughter, Ina, remembers people waiting by their new boxes”with cookies for the mailman’s little girl who often rode along.\n\n1900\n\nCensus 520\n\nThe first decade of the Twentieth Century was a busy one for our “small town.” A library club was formed. An official volunteer fire department was organized. There was an active Commercial Club pushing for improvements such as city water and better streetcar service. A recreational park and tent city were set up. The Masons were organized. The bank was reorganized and an official town band was started.\n\n901\n\nCounty commissioners paid contractor, D.J. Falvey $150 dollars per mile to build a new bike path was built between Robbinsdale and Champlin, 10 miles to the north. Artic explorer Charles E.S. Burch spent two months in Robbinsdale experimenting with a triple expansion steam engines and a rotary skate and screw mechanism. Burch hoped his “Automobile Sleigh” allow him to reach the North Pole. Burch won fame exploring the Yukon Territory and Alaska in 1897. The experiments in Robbinsdale were conducted in order to ascertain the necessary horsepower needed to propel the screws. Articles in the Minneapolis Journal and the Minneapolis Tribune reported that Burch and all those associated with him were greatly pleased with the uniform success of their results on the Crystal Lake. Burch was awarded a patent for what he called an “Ice Locomotive.” in 1901. He later filed his patent for the “Automobile Sleigh” on June 20, 1907.\n\n1902\n\nJohn Ruble became the railway mail clerk and served over thirty years. In the early years he sorted mail using kerosene lanterns for light. He also served on the school board and was a Justice of the Peace for 14 years. In October, Miss Mary A. Russ, 90 years of age returned to her room after a few moments absence and found that a thief had entered and stole her purse. She found the man in the closet and without a moments hesitation she demanded that the purse in all of its contents be returned to her. The man delivered the property to her and escaped before an officer could be summoned.\n\n1903\n\nThomas Girling was elected to the State Legislature and stopped his activities as editor. On December 16, 1903, a new paper, Robbinsdale Park Progress edited by A.S. McMillan, an ardent Robbinsdale booster.\n\n1904\n\nThe idea for a library for Robbinsdale took its first concrete step at a meeting April 6th, at the home of W. S. Sayre. Dr. D. G. Colp was elected president and Maude Stillman (Huston) secretary. Others attending were Mr. Cranston, Mr. McMillan, Thomas Girling, Mrs. W. H. Grenell, Mrs. Fred Eddy and Frances Pollard. This group became known as the Library Board. A Grenell minstrel program was planned which raised $57.80. Dr. Leonard of Minneapolis had already donated two bookcases and some books. Other local people donated books which were first housed in the office of the Columbia Hotel, Mrs. J. Coulter was the first librarian, followed by Charles Scharf who received $4 a month. Having to pay this large salary, fundraising was needed. One concert netted 35 cents. W. I. Nolan gave a lecture netting $11.50, a basketsocial raised $15, and the Board members pledged one dollar a month. The annual membership dues for the Robbinsdale Historical Society in 2017 are only $15.00.\n\nDonald G. Colp, pastor of the First Congregational Church, began studying medicine and about 1908 began practicing medicine here. He had a lovely home overlooking Crystal Lake (where Crystal Lake Health Care Center now stands) and after his first wife died in 1929, he married Countess Utta Larisch of Bavaria in 1931. Robbinsdale residents were excited about having a countess in their midst. Dr. Colp, born in Nova Scotia, died in 1948, at age 78.\n\nThe first recorded Arbor Day ceremony in Robbinsdale was April 29, 1904. Andrew B. Robbins addressed the gathering as the tree planting efforts were celebrated.\n\nThe Robbinsdale Park Progress mentioned Mud Lake which was not big enough to show on any map. By 1950 it was just a swamp, and later was developed into Manor Park.\n\nFor a picnic and camping grounds for the Modem Woodsmen of Hennepin\n\nCounty, resorts in the vicinity of Minneapolis. A Tent City was established south of Johnson Road (36th Avenue) and the MWA (Modern Woodsmen of America) Park was to be subdivided into lots and rented to city people for outings. In June, Sorter and Jones were residents of Tent City for the summer. The lots were 40′ x 40′ and the rent for the entire summer was $5. Advertisements bragged that the tent city was on the electric line, near Crystal and Twin Lakes (see photo at the top of the post) and under the police protection of Robbinsdale. The Robbinsdaie Park Progress devoted much space to advertising this venture—”see A. S. McMillan, Editor, for purchasing lots.” This project lasted for several years. In 1905, Arthur Jones, a veteran of the Spanish-American War, married Mae Cole. moved to Robbinsdale, bought a house on Hubbard Avenue, practiced law and became an active citizen, serving on the Village Council from 1913-1918.\n\nIn 1904, the Robbinsdale Commercial Club was organized with Albert Gullette, president David Hasten, vice president; Willard Randall, secretary, and J. J. Coulter, treasurer. (HH) This was the forerunner of the Robbinsdale Businessmen’s Association, now the Chamber of Commerce.\n\nThe July 21, 1904, issue of the RobbinsdaJe Park Progress reported the annual meeting of School District No. 24. The report of the treasurer, W. H. Johnson, was read and accepted, showing a balance of $600. E. T. Kirkwood was re-elected director for three years. Only thirteen votes were cast. A school tax of four mills was voted for the ensuing year. There was a grand Fourth of July celebration with addresses, music, bicycle races, foot races, fat-man’s race (over 215 Ibs.), a ball game, sack race, ladies nail driving contest and a ladies egg race.\n\n1905\n\nRobbinsdale pioneer, Alfred Parker passed away on April 7th. Compass Lodge 265 A. F. & A. M. was organized September 6. George Swift, Sr. as first master. The charter was granted in January, 1906. The Temple, built in 1922, was dedicated September 30. In January, Gus Urban was again President of the Village. Other officers were N. F. Russ, Recorder; John Trump, Treasurer; and A. M. Gullette, R. D. Smith and Henry Scott, Trustees. Robbinsdale became a busy place on Sundays after Minneapolis a Sunday saloon closing rule went into effect in Minneapolis. The Minneapolis Tribune reported that Robbinsdale was the busiest place in the county on Sunday and, ” Every on of the cars running into the town is loaded to guards with thirsty ones who make bee lines for the village thirst parlors there to load themselves to the guards.” In December, Mayor Urban announced that the conduct of the saloon owners was disgraceful and that Robbinsdale would follow the example set by Minneapolis and close saloons on Sundays.\n\n1906\n\nRobbinsdale’s Northside Street Railway Company purchased four new double-truck cars and improved the road bed with heavier steel. April Village Council minutes mention that a dog shot in the village was found to have rabies and all dogs should be either muzzled or tied up for 60 days. Council minutes record Robert Gifford asking for a road in Manitoba Park; A. B. Robbins for grade establishment for a sidewalk, also a cement curb; liquor licenses to remain at $650 per year; cost estimates to be obtained for a parkway between Crystal and Twin Lakes as requested by A. B. Robbins; the appointment of Ralph Stipe, a trustee on the council, to be janitor and lamplighter. There were many applications for street lighting and the janitor was paid $10 a month for lighting the lamps. In November, Shortly after Andrew B. Robbins had secured franchises from Anoka to Osseo the Wall Street Journal reported that Twin City Rapid Transit had purchased the Robbinsdale Trolley line.\n\n907\n\nTo support the Library Board, the Library Club was organized on January 3, 1907, with 26 members. Mrs. C. W. G. Hyde was first president. At that time books were available from 9 to 4pm on week days at the Robbinsdale State Bank. The members voted to contribute an additional dollar a month to the salary of the Librarian. For a while the Village Council gave one dollar per month but decided it could not afford this expense. It did allow the books to be placed in the Village Hall free of charge, including lights. Previously, the books, mostly donated by citizens, had been kept in the Hotel and later in the drug store. Miss Clara Sessing served as Librarian. Books began to disappear from the shelves faster than they could be replaced. Finally, the ones that were left were placed in storage for two years. In November, 1917, a small\n\nbuilding on Main Street was purchased for $225 and moved to lots on Rockford Road west of the railroad tracks. These lots had been donated and purchased earlier. It was stuccoed, given hardwood floors, redecorated and opened to the public on June 28, 1920. The Village Council gave $100 to buy 38 books. Mrs. E. N. Russ and Mrs. E. Forsaith took care of the Library for one year, each donating her salary to buy books. In 1921, Frances Pollard became Librarian and served over thirty years.\n\nThe Library Club maintained the Library until January 7, 1922, when it was turned over to the Hennepin County Library system with 1,500 volumes. However, the club still owned the building and grounds and maintained them. After Miss Pollard’s death, the Library Club set up a memorial fund in 1962 to purchase books for the Library. For 70 years the devoted women of the Library Club worked hard to see that this service be provided to Robbinsdale and the surrounding area.\n\nWe honor those first 26 members:\n\nMrs. Donald G. Colp , Mrs. Robert Craig , Mrs. Eudora Donaldson , Mrs. J. Dutton,\n\nMrs. S. J. Franklin, Mrs. H. I. Horton, Mrs. C. E. Howard, Mrs. David Huston, Mrs. C. W. C. Hyde, Miss Emily Hyde, Mrs. E. K. Jaques, Mrs. Arthur L. Jones, Mrs. Carl Jones\n\nMrs. E. Peteler, Mrs. Willard Randall, Miss Amy Robbins, Mrs. John Ruble, Mrs. W. S. Sayre, Mrs. Harry G. Shrimpf, Mrs. H. R. Stillman, Mrs. George E. Swift, Miss Ruth Donaldson, Mrs. Kate Howe, Mrs. John Trump, Miss Lillian Trump, Mrs. Nelson Nash.\n\n1908\n\nThe year 1908 was a busy one for Robbinsdale. Many citizens wanted better streetcar service and streetcars, so the village council had many contacts with the Twin City Railway Company and got promises of improvements. Parents were given warning about the diphtheria epidemic, which plagued Minneapolis.\n\nOn July 8, the new newspaper, Robbinsdale Tellit ($1.50 per year) was published by F. A. Harvey, editor and publisher. It contained both national and local news. Ads of new businesses included: “The American Suburbs Company is using every honorable means of inducing investors and prospective home builders to become new citizens.” From October 3rd, it sold one lot each day in Robbinsdale Park at one-half price or less. Standard price was $300, $5 down and $5 per month. Other ads were: G. J. Urban, Meat Market; Columbia Hotel, J. J. Coulter, Proprietor; Russ Grocery; Charles SchuIIer, implements, garden tools and general hardware; Bossert’s Cement Works, foundations dug and basements put in. W. G. Bossert built his new concrete block house on Hubbard Avenue in 1908. It was finally demolished by the Housing Authority in 1979 and a new house built in 1982.\n\nF. Grenell organized and managed the Robbinsdale baseball team. known as “The Robbinsdale Cubs,” with E. N. Joyce, manager.\n\nMr. J. C. Lund, President of the Robbinsdale State Bank, died in August.\n\nMany assurances were given in the Tellit about the safety of the money. In 1909, W. A. Farr moved from Iowa to head the reorganized Robbinsdale State Bank, until 1919.\n\nAlso in 1908 J. H. Morse was busy teaching Sunday School at the Congregational Church; George Swift was Master of the Compass Lodge of the A. F. and A. M.; Several houses were broken into and robbed of money and jewelry (Perle Malbon, G. H Johnson, and Mrs. Thomas Howard among the victims); horses would become frightened and dash for home. Horses becoming alarmed and running “somewhere” was a real problem in those days. Edgar Patch remembered a team “clattering” out Rockford Road dragging the wagon behind and a nearby farmer standing on the road to herd them into his yard to quiet them. In the winter Theodore Christianson, principal at Parker School, 1907-09, scheduled a lecture series with out-of-town speakers to benefit the piano fund. The events were well advertised in the Robbinsdale TeJlit but in the spring of 1909, the financial report indicated that the receipts were $84.20 and the expenses were $94.10. Theodore Christianson was the school principal while attending law school. He later served as Governor of Minnesota from 1925 through 1930 when he was defeated by Floyd Olson. In 1935, he published a five-volume Minnesota History.\n\nAfter the 1895 Luther Seminary fire, John Jones, a local carriage maker, built for the village a hook and ladder rig with places on the side for water buckets. These were used by the “Bucket Brigade” which at that time was the most modem fire fighting apparatus known. Water would be drawn from cisterns. By 1908, the original volunteer fire department was defunct, so in August, Village Trustees J. B. Scott, Perly Hoff and Charles Schuller, along with George Nash and W. H. Rodgers of the Commercial Club were appointed by the council to form a new volunteer fire department. About 30 men were willing to serve. W. H. Rodgers was chief and Irwin Russ, assistant chief. The new fire department was officially organized September 19, 1908, and on November 11 there was a benefit Grand Ball and supper for the fire department. By 1909, the fire department had acquired a hand-drawn, chemical rig\n\n(with soda and ash). After many years of service, the rig was buried in the dump behind the village hall and is now paved over by the McDonald’s parking lot.\n\nIn 1914, Minneapolis’s offer of a horse-drawn, chemical rig was accepted and housed in an addition to the village hall. Due to the urgings of George Nash, a two-horse, power siren was installed in the Village Hall in April, 1917. Previously the Village Hall bell was rung to announce fires. The number of rings indicated the section of the village where the fire was located. Six years after the fire department was organized, the members decided to form a relief association. G. Nash, Sr.; William Rodgers; N. L. Nash; T. P. Howard; J. V. Ruble; R. L. Sayre; J. Bloberger, Sr.; Ben Knoll; F. A. Harvey; J. A. Trump; W. D. Bartlett; W. S. Randall and Perly Hoff wrote the artides of incorporation for the Robbinsdale Fire Department Relief Association. The purpose of the relief association was to give aid to disabled firemen, to defray funeral expenses and pay pensions to firemen who serve the required number of years. In 1983, all 28 volunteer firemen belonged to the association.\n\nEvelyn Nash Pearson, daughter of George Nash, who was fire chief and for many years the owner of Nash Hardware remembers her father calling the Minneapolis Weather Bureau to find out the weather predictions and signal this with various colored flags above his store\n\nIn the summer of 1908, William F. Grenell started soliciting donations for band instruments for a band about to be formed, reported the Robbinsdale TeIlit. He presented a petition to form a band to the Village Council on September 4. At a public meeting on November 5, the Robbinsdale Military Band was formally organized. George Swift was elected leader and W. F. Grenell, treasurer. On November 16 a big benefit entertainment by the GreneII Minstrels was held at the Village Hall to raise more money for instruments. The Band started practicing immediately and in February, 1909, played at the Firemen’s Benefit and Entertainment Dance. In May, 1909, a Grand Concert was held with George Swift, director. A dance followed. A 1909 photo of the Band dressed in military uniforms of the day shows five Grenell family members and two of the Swift family, among others. The Grenells were a very musically talented family.\n\nLater the name of the organization was changed to the Robbinsdale Civic Band. There was also a Robbbinsdale Civic Club that among other things put on skits and plays for the town’s entertainment.\n\n1909\n\nPerly Malbon was a mail carrier for many years. As the train slowed down, mail bags were tossed off, piled into a cart and pushed a block to the post office for sorting. In April, Grenell’s Pool Hall was opened “to be run in a strictly up-to-the minute fashion” said the Tellit. It was located on the second story of the J. B. Scott building.\n\nBy August the newspapers were reporting that the town was divided to a child into factions. One either agreed with the Mayor Charles Schuller and the Village Council that Robbinsdale was a law abiding hamlet or believed the town was on the road to perdition and the authorities were in league with evil. The dispute arose around the enforcement of liquor laws. Several saloons, but mostly one known as “The Point”, were accused of staying open past closing time on Sundays. Minnesota Attorney General, David F. Simpson issued an ultimatum. He told Mayor Schuller that he must either rigidly enforce the village liquor laws or resign. Simpson received additional complaints. A hearing was held in St. Paul on August 18th, the Attorney General asked the Mayor to resign over this matter and threatened to began proceedings against the mayor on the grounds of malfeasance. Mayor Schuller lawyered up and prepared to fight the Attorney General in court. Feelings were high strung. Village Councilman, T.A. Tyler, fainted on street corner while discussing that matter with residents. A a rowdy town hall meeting held on August 25th, the father of the village, Andrew B. Robbins rose to restore order beseeching the crowd,\n\n” Gentleman let us act in a businesslike way. Our town has been given much ill repute over this matter. Let us not besmirch it any further.”\n\nThe liquor trouble was finally settled in September after another hearing with the Minnesota Attorney General. The Village Council promised it would appoint a special policeman to keep watch and ensure that laws against selling liquor after 11:00pm on Sundays were strictly enforced.\n\n1910\n\nCensus 765\n\n(a 4% increase since 1900)\n\nThe decade of the “teens” showed continued growth of our small village. Another church, a new bank, a P.T.A., concerts, a new band stand, a bath house, an addition to Parker School, World War I, the formation of the American Legion and the fight over women’s suffrage all made life interesting.\n\nOn June 16th, 1910, Andrew B. Robbins passed away from the complications of stomach cancer. He was sixty-five years of age. His contemporaries noted that Robbins life had been of great service and benefit to his fellowmen. Robbins was elected to the state Senate at the age of 30 and he worked tirelessly to improve the material, intellectual, social, religious and moral progress of his community. Through his labors Robbins advanced those interests which lift the individual above the more sordid things of life. Robbins was a man securely settled in the realm where contemplation leads to the development and adoption of ideals. His loss was deeply mourned by his family and the village that was named for him. Robbins is buried with his wife and daughters in the family plot at Lakewood Cemetery in Minneapolis.\n\nOn June 29th, the Minneapolis Tribune reported a tremendous explosion blew the Point Bar at Crystal Lake to bits. A defect in the saloon’s acetylene generator was the suspected cause. Both the first and second floors of the bar shot skyward carrying with them the contents of the basement and the occupants bar room. The roof withstood the terrible upheaval and splintered and the splintered wreckage fell back into the basement. Four elderly women and two men who were in the back room were carrying out through the buildings remaining exit. Five men in the main room were killed.\n\n1911\n\nSouvenir Robbinsdaie, published in 1911, says: “The little village has an electric light system which includes nearly all residences as well as the stores and provides arc lights for the streets. There is a village hall at which public meetings are held and entertainments frequently given. A large park, baseball grounds, bathing beach, pleasure boating and fine fishing are literally ‘right in the town. There is telephone and telegraph service, carrier postal delivery and, in fact, all the conveniences that are attainable in the city.”\n\nOn April 23rd, Robbinsdale farmer and pioneer, Nocholas Foegen celebrated his 90th birthday with daughter Mrs Raskop and his 92 year old friend, Mrs Roehl of St. Paul.\n\nRobbbinsdale boosters built a beautiful float for the Minneapolis Industrial Parade in July of 1911. The parade was part of the Minneapolis Civic Celebration was held during the week of July 2 to July 8. The festivities emphasized the prosperity of the Northwest and illustrated many of the area’s notable achievements. An estimated 25,000 visitors arrived in Minneapolis during the week. The celebrations included parades, musical programs, military maneuvers and the linking of Lake of the Isles and Lake Calhoun. The signs on the horses that pulled the Robbinsdale float read:\n\n“Robbinsdale, Best Suburban Homes, Schools Second to None, Come Out To See Our Lakes, Purest Water and Lots of Fresh Air”\n\nOn Christmas Day a small wooden church was dedicated which was the beginning of the Sacred Heart parish. The parish consisted of 38 families. John Reimer and Joseph Boies were the first Trustees. Father William H. BIum was the first resident pastor serving 19 years until his death in 1931. The church was enlarged and resurfaced in red brick, a rectory was built in 1914, a school added in 1926 and a convent in 1927, all under Father BIum’s direction. Father Francis Nolan succeeded Father Blum and served until his death in 1966. People admired Father Nolan for his teaching, love of people and his pious way of life.\n\nOn the last Friday in April, Arbor Day at Parker school was celebrated with songs and recitations at morning assembly. Forty silver maple and elm trees were planted by the first grade boys and girls and assisted by the eighth grade boys who had dug the holes.\n\nBits of interest reported in the Robbinsdale Times, published by C.A. French from March to August in 1912:\n\nIn March—horse racing on Crystal Lake was over for the season.\n\nMuch concern was shown about oak trees and the deadly German barer.\n\nCost of living was going up—”veal now l0 cents a pound.”\n\nQuiet and sane Fourth of July—no village celebration.\n\nThe Catholic Church people had a picnic at Manitoba Park and netted “a handsome sum of money.”\n\nD. Crandall had invested $10,000 in his auto livery— stalls for 30 horses and ample room for autos and carriages.\n\nOn April 1st, the Girling Warner Company resumed service to Anoka, St. Michael and Lake Charlotte. Three cars with six round trips daily.\n\nThere was much news about the sinking of the Titanic in April. It was thought to be the greatest tragedy of the seas.\n\nMitchell roadsters were pictured and advertised. Thirty horsepower. Cost $950.\n\nThe Robbinsdale Tellit reported that a would be passenger waiting for the train at the Robbinsdale Depot asked the station agent how long before the train would arrive. The agent looked up the track and said, ” Pretty soon now. Here comes the engineer’s dog”\n\nShortly after the dedication of Sacred Heart Church in 1911, a group of women formed a club which in October, 1912, officially became The Rosary Society. Mrs. J. A. Boies was the first president. Money-raising events helped with the church expenses and when the convent was completed in 1927, the Society provided the furnishings.\n\n1913\n\nIn 1913 Parker School, built in 1890, was no longer adequate for over 200 pupils. Fourteen thousand dollars in bonds were issued to add four additional rooms to the front of the original school and the name was changed to Robbinsdale Public\n\nSchool. Many additions have been built since, including an adjoining high school, an auditorium, a north wing, and a south wing. A major remodeling in the 1970’s included a swimming pool and removal of the auditorium for increased gymnasium space. It became a junior high school after a new high school was built in 1956.\n\nThe P. T. A. was organized in 1913, one of the first in the state. Mrs. Robert Craig (Carrie Swift) was instrumental in starting the group and was its first president. Child welfare in all its many branches has been the program of the Parents and Teachers Association. Hot lunches, milk for needy children, clothing projects, library facilities have been secured as they became necessary. “Each president left an imprint on the organization by carrying out some worthy objective,” said Esther Loe, in a December 8, 1938 paper. Esther Loe was a long-time, favorite teacher in School District No. 24. Her students both loved and feared her for being a strict disciplinarian. Another well-loved teacher at that time was Tekkla Thote who taught mathematics.\n\nThe Village Council set wages for labor in the Village: “a man and team’\n\n$4.50 for a nine-hour day and for a man, $2 for a nine-hour day.”\n\nOn December 11th, The Commercial Club of Robbinsdale was organized with a membership of 45 and W.A. Farr as president. The club’s announced purpose was to boost first for Robbinsdale, then for Minneapolis.\n\n1914\n\nThe November 1, 1914, Minneapolis Tribune describes the new through street-car service just inaugurated. ‘It leaves Hennepin and Sixth Street and arrives thirty minutes later in Robbinsdale, at the end of a 3800-foot stretch of concrete pavement, replacing the old Jumper stub line, which had operated for over twenty years.” There was a gala celebration ending in a burst of oratory from various officials. Mr. Girling claimed the old jumper was a great character builder—”Getting off the Penn car late at night just in time to see the tail light of the ‘dinky’ disappearing over the hill was great schooling in the virtues of resignation, patience and self-control.”\n\nAccording to a Sunday feature in the June 28th, 1914 Minneapolis Tribune, Robbinsdale had an electric light plant, sidewalks, curb and gutters. The volunteer fire department could call on additional fire protection from the Crystal Lake Avenue station of the Minneapolis fire department. The village was free of debt. and government was by a council composed of a president and four Councilman. Robbinsdale had one factory operated by E.M. Pearson for 20 years. Pearson manufactured a patent nailer for shingle nails and in 1914 he began tack nailer. production. These nailers were unique in that they were only ones manufactured at the time. Pearson owned the basic patents. In 1914 the demand was so far above the production that Pearson was usually months behind orders.\n\n915\n\nIn 1914 under the auspices of George 0. Johnson, Arthur L. Jones and J. H. Morse, many money-raising events were held for a bandstand for Robbinsdale Civic Club Band. These included events such as the ice cream social in the Robbinsdale Village Hall on July 28, 1914—”Plates, 10 cents.” On July 29, 1915, the Robbinsdale Civic Club Band, W. F. Grenell, director, held the first of many Open Air Concerts in the new bandstand. It had been erected with the help of many public spirited citizens at the corner of West Broadway and 42nd Avenue. The stand was later moved to a site near the present water tower on Hubbard Avenue and still later to 40th Avenue and West Broadway. It was demolished in the late 1940’s and in the 1960’s a portable bandstand was purchased. By 1926, there were two bands functioning: the Robbinsdale Concert Band which replaced the Civic Club Band (in name at least) directed by W. F. Grenell and the South Town Community Band, Louis Spotten, leader. About 1929 or 1930 a Junior Band was.organized with Dr. E. J. Lillehei as committee chairman. It was sponsored by the American Legion to act as a feeder for the Concert Band. Louis Spotten was the first leader, followed by Arthur Johnson. After the high school was built in 1936, the need for a Junior Band was met through the school’s musical activities. Robbinsdale has always been proud of its bands. When Robbinsdale became a city in December, 1938, the band again changed its name to the Robbinsdale City Band. Eventually it was divided into two groups—the Concert Band and the Marching Band, the latter consisting of those wanting (and able) to march in the annual Aquatennial Parades We should give honor to other directors of the band who have served so well: Miles Sery, Clarence Hegg, Paul Larson, William Alien Abbott, Robert Mendenhall (17 years), Roy Olson, Donald Schiermer and Roger Thompson, since 1969. The band has taken many honors, and we are very proud of the many top honors earned in the Aquatennial competitions.\n\nThe June 18 edition of the RobbinsdaJe Teilit, “an Independent (but not neutral) Newspaper,” reported local news: a frost reported two nights earlier; H. M. Grenell suffering from a sprained foot; Mrs. Sarah Smith will launder your curtains for only 20 cents the pair; the Loose Wiles Biscuit Company will have a demonstration of its goods at the Russ-McDonald store and everyone is invited to sample the many delicious articles; the Russ-McDonald Store has been remodeled and a “new and commodius front put in”; the Girling Warner Auto Bus line announced a change of running time between Robbinsdale and Osseo and special terms are made for picnic and fishing parties; J. B. Russ has purchased a new Ford; the Crystal Baths have not had a very good season thus far, as summer has not arrived yet. Robbinsdale had a particularly heavy blizzard in 1915. This issue also included a long quote from the Texas Farmers’ Union on “Why Should Women Vote.” Some quotes: “We are opposed to equal rights of woman—we want her to ever remain our superior.” “We are opposed to a woman in the field, in the factory or in the army and for the same reasons we had rather see her plant flowers—gather bouquets—and rear children than raise political issues.” Women did get the vote in 1920.\n\nThe Village Council minutes record some street name changes in 1915. “County Road” (now Shoreline) was changed to Lake Street, to be a continuation of the then Lake Street (now 40th Avenue North) to Vilas (now Noble). The street, then known as Minneapolis-Bottineau Road (now Broadway) was changed to Crystal Lake Avenue. Several other name changes occurred but have again been changed. Crystal Lake Avenue was paved with concrete in 1916.\n\nIn September, 52 members of the Eighth Minnesota Volunteer Infantry gathered at the home of Mrs. A.B. Robbins. Andrew B. Robbins was one of the youngest members of the Civil War regiment when he enlisted at the age of 17. The veterans were received by the citizens of Robbinsdale, the band, veterans from other regiments and sons of veterans. After the group was escorted through decorated streets to the big house on Twin Lake, a program was held on the lawn where an army camp with a big camp fire was made.\n\n1916\n\nCivil War veteran, farmer, politician and businessman, Jay Elijah Nash was born on March 29, 1843, in Hadley, Massachusetts. At the age of 18, he enlisted in the Union serving with Company D of the 27th Regiment Massachusetts Volunteer Infantry. Nash re-enlisted in 1863. During the long bloody course of the war Nash fought in twenty battles and was promoted to the rank of Sergeant. He was wounded in action at Petersburg on in 1864. The following year Nash was captured in North Carolina, and held as a prisoner of war for 19 days before he was exchanged. After the war was over, Nash returned home to Hadley. On April 8, 1865 he married a woman from Springfield, Massachusetts named, Martha M. Davis. Four years later Jay and Martha Nash moved to Minnesota, taking up residence in Minneapolis. In 1874, Martha gave birth to George S. Nash. In 1880, Nash purchased 40 acres of land in what was then Crystal Lake Township. He established a dairy farm with 82 head of cattle. Nash opened a hardware store a coupe years later. Martha and Jay divorced in 1885. The following year Nash remarried, a Vermont native Clara Louise Cooper. Four years later, Clara gave birth to Jay’s younger son and the couple’s first child together, Floyd E. Nash. In 1895, their daughter, Ruby L. Nash was born.\n\nNash spent a great deal of time reflecting upon his Civil War Experience and decided that war was little more than organized murder. He advocated pacifism and argued that socialism was the best way to guarantee peace. In 1899, Nash became one of the founders of the Social Democratic Party of Minnesota and in 1902, Nash became the gubernatorial nominee for the Socialist Party of Minnesota. He received less than one percent of the vote, but Nash’s star continued to rise. On February 22, 1904 the state convention of the Public Ownership (Socialist) Party of Minnesota, meeting in Minneapolis, elected Nash as State Secretary and later that year he became party’s nominee for the office of Governor. Nash did a little better the second time around. He received 1.91% of the vote. The party grew during Nash’s tenure as State Secretary, In 1905 the Public Ownership (Socialist) Party of Minnesota averaged 791 members in good standing by 1908, there were 1,837. By 1915 the party had 5,600 members. They managed a few victories during Nash’s tenure winning a seat in the legislature and mayor elections in Brainard, Two Harbors, Crookston and Bemidji. In 1912, Nash ran for the office of State Treasurer. He won 12.65% of the vote. Undeterred Nash, took to the speakers’ circuit and gave speeches all over the state. Nash ran for the office of State Treasurer again in 1914. He won8.96 percent. On July 30, 1915 At the age of 72, Nash was thrown from his wagon and died. George Nash took over the family hardware store. Clara continued live in Nash’s Crystal Lake home until she passed away in 1944. Their daughter Ruby lived in the family home until her death in the 1960s.\n\nn 1916 Floyd E. Nash built a bath house on his family’s property at Crystal Lake. The new bath house opened with 24 lockers, later increased to 100 and still later, 900 lockers. It was a recreation center, widely known for good, clean, wholesome fun—bathing, toboggan slides into the water, boating, fishing, picnics, dancing, and cottages. He also operated the Nash Land and Fuel Company for about 10 years.\n\nEach vote counted, even in the 1916 village council election, when a recount on March 16 showed Leo M. Kuch was elected Trustee by four votes. Others elected were William H. Johnson, President; Arthur Jones and J. A. Peterson, Trustees; J. A. Trump, Recorder; C. H. Hubbell, Justice of the Peace; and S. E. Sinclair, Constable.\n\n1917\n\nDuring the World War of 1917 and 1918, Robbinsdale’s growth was at a standstill. As in other wars, Robbinsdale furnished a generous share of soldiers. The first contingent to leave the village in a truck bearing a huge banner “Robbinsdale to Berlin” consisted of Eddie Lacomb, William Schlundt, Julius Sessing, Dave Parkhill, John Nasett, and Nick Clasen.\n\nOn January 15 the Civic Club requested the council to pay $50 to help make up the deficit on the bandstand, which it did, provided the Civic Club turn the bandstand over to the Village.\n\nOn April 27th, funeral services for John P. Shumway were held at The Congregational Church. A pioneer and Civil War veteran, Shumway was the town treasurer for 20 years.The Robbins family “served with the colors,” for generations.\n\nDespite the challenges of difficult marriages and running the family businesses, it was inevitable that Amy Robbins Ware and Edith Robbins Daniels, the daughters of Andrew B. Robbins would throw themselves into the war effort. Both women were in their 40’s at the time. April 6, 1917, (the day the United States declared war), Amy entered the American School of Telegraphy, studying Morse and Radio Telegraphy, remaining until July, 1917. She conducted the Radio Department, Women’s Naval Service Inc. Training School, teaching both day and night classes at Fort Snelling. Edith volunteered for the Red Cross and supervised the production of several thousand garments made from dozens of bolts of new materials donated for the purpose for all of which Edith either cut or directed the cutting and making. She kept scores of sewing machines supplied with material and volunteer workers. All these garments were sent parcel post direct to the scenes of need in France and Belgium.\n\n1918\n\nOn January 19 Mr. J. Bloberger, Hall Custodian, reported “his supply of wood and coal was running short and he didn’t know if he could get any more” so the Council instructed him not to rent the hall to outside parties and to conserve fuel as much as possible.\n\nThe Council also in 1918 voted to pay $3.25 per week for admission of a Robbinsdale resident (name withheld by editor) to the poor farm as his relatives refuse to care for him any longer.

When the Red Cross called for volunteers to the front, September, 1918, Mrs. Ware went and served in emergency canteen and nursing throughout St. Mihiel and Argonne drives, “under fire” with Field Hospital No. 41, where there were no other women than her unit, at Sorcey-sur-Meuse. She had learned the manoeuvers of the aviators at the Aviation Center, and in her book “Echoes of France,” describes the first air battle she saw, at Sorcey, under the title “Birds of the Night.” She continued with Evacuation Hospital, No. 9, Vaubricourt; and No. II, Brizeaux-Forestierre in the Argonne, until December 8, 1918.\n\n1919\n\nThe Security Bank was incorporated December 16, 1918, opening for business January 16, 1919, in the same one-story building which had housed its predecessors, two banks which were once described by Mrs. Stillman as “very disappointing,” a most lenient description. The first officers were T. M. Antony, President; Arthur Ovrum, Vice-president; J. W. Roche, Cashier. Mr. Roche was the sole employee, so when he left the building, it was necessary to lock the bank. Mr. T. P. Howard (who had come to Robbinsdale from Anoka in 1914, and had purchased the lumber yard) was elected president on January 4, 1921 and held the office until January, 1953.

Howard furnishing the uniforms several times), planted several thousand trees in parts of the village, erected “Protect Robbinsdale Children” signs, sponsored the School Safety Patrol, given school award medals, and contributed to many charitable funds and drives.

The Fawcett family moved to North Dakota three years later. At the age of 16, Wilford Hamiliton Fawcett, better known as Captain Billy, ran away from home, joined the army, and shipped out to the Philippines. Fawcett served as a private during the Philippine Insurrection. After the kris blade of a Moro tribesman tore through his leg, army doctors recommended an amputation. Fawcett rejected the operation, returned home, and found a backwoods Doctor who had a reputation for saving doomed limbs. When he was back up on his feet, Fawcett married Viva Claire Meyers. In 1906 the couple settled in Minnesota where Fawcett took a job as a railway clerk. Soon his wife gave birth to twins and Fawcett took a second job as a police reporter for a Minneapolis newspaper. At the outbreak of World War I he returned to the army where he worked on the military newspaper, Stars and Stripes. Fawcett rose to the rank of captain and adopted his famous nickname, “Captain Billy.” When he returned from the war Fawcett opened a bar called the Army Navy Club. Unfortunately, prohibition became the law of the land in 1919. The bar closed and Fawcett was left scrambling to support his growing family. During his army days Fawcett collected saucy stories he didn’t dare print in Star and Stripes. Inspired by a North Dakota periodical called Jim Jam Jems, Fawcett decided to risk $500.00 and print a humor magazine for veterans. Named after himself and the sound of an incoming artillery shell, the first issue of Captain Billy’s Whiz Bang sold out in less than a week. By the time the fourth issue hit the newsstands, the little magazine had sold over 500,000 copies. Fawcett became rich and famous almost overnight.\n\n1920\n\nCensus 1,369—a 79% increase since 1910\n\nThe decade of the “twenties” is remembered by many as the very best decade of their lives. The war to end wars was over and times were booming\n\n(until the stock market crash in 1929). Many got their first radios. Model\n\n“T’s” were replacing horses and the “flappers” were in style—and short dresses for the first time in history, we think The Charleston was the popular dance; and women “bobbed” their hair, thus no longer needing to brush it 100 strokes every day. Gas stoves were replacing the old iron wood stoves. and gas furnaces began replacing coal furnaces.\n\nRobbinsdale had an unprecedented building boom and by 1930 its population had increased 223% to 4,427. Robbinsdale also got a public water supply. Times were looking up and people thought it would last forever.\n\nThe Robbinsdale Airport opened in 1920. The facility played hot to a variety of aviation entertainments including barnstorming, parachute jumping exhibitions. The airport’s grass runway stretched from Fairfax Avenue to 44th Avenue North. The field and hangers were just east of West Broadway\n\nMarch, T. P. Howard was elected president President of the Village Council.\n\nThe American Legion Auxiliary to Westphal Post #251 was organized with 31 charter members, August 6, 1920, with Mrs. F. R. Stinchfield serving as first president. Its purpose was to aid the Post in serving the disabled comrades and in caring for the needy children of veterans; to assist in community activities, especially along the lines of youth and health activities.\n\nRobbinsdale Girls Scouts at Camp\n\nIt also sponsored Girl Scout Troops, Scholarship medals, Garden Clubs for school children, essay contests, sewing for veterans and their families and the hospital, selling articles made by disabled veterans—all have been part of the program from the beginning to the present.\n\nAn early paper tells about the Sunday night supper served to 135 disabled men at Asbury Hospital. Hospital visiting was carried on, too, from the beginning, first at Asbury, later at Ft. Snelling. Mrs. L. I. Nasett and Mrs. Lena CIasen were the first hospital visitors, with Mrs. T. P. Howard active there for many years, first as a visitor, then as State Chairman. National honors came to the Unit in 1933 when Miss Elizabeth Youssi won the State and National Essay Awards, a $200 scholarship prize, in an essay contest sponsored by the unit. Perhaps the most ambitious undertaking of the local post and unit was the Tenth District Convention held June 19 and 20, 1937. Mrs. Frank P. Hosterman was co-chairman and P. J. Connoy and Henry Hartig were official greeters. Early meetings were held at the Robbinsdale City Hall.\n\nAt the Auxilia"
