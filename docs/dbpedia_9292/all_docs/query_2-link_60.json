        "text": "My Timeline for Charles and Emma: The Darwins’ Leap of Faith\n\nWhile I was working on the book, I made up my own time line and had it thumb-tacked to my bulletin board above my desk, along with a map of England. This way I could glance up and check out a date or a location without having to search through piles on my desk or documents on my computer. Here’s a photo of my bulletin board in case you don’t believe me. (But why wouldn’t you?) The salmon-colored pages are the time line. The white pages are comments on an early draft from my editors. The paintbrushes are a page from a quilt calendar (my friend made the quilt and it got into a calendar!) If you look hard you can also see: a cut-out of a photo of my younger son playing keyboard in a band, a knitting needle, a box of dominoes from my childhood, a schedule from University of Chicago where my older son was then in school, and who knows what else. But the main things to notice are the timeline and the map.\n\nHere is a reproduction of the timeline, for your use. As you should with any source, double check me. I double checked myself if I used a date in the book. (I’ve cleaned it up a little, but it is still idiosyncratic-with facts in there that I wanted for the book, and notes to myself. I thought of cleaning it up more, but I thought you’d like to see inside my mind…)\n\nFor the purposes of this web page I’ve put in links to other web sites I think you might find interesting. Some of them are things I could not fit into the book and some are just other things you might like to explore. You can also check out the research I did for the book.
