        "text": "1832 Reform Act\n\nThe Act brought widespread reform to the electoral system in England and Wales. The Act gave seats in the House of Commons to new industrialised cities and removed them from rotten boroughs.\n\nWhile it increased the number of voters from 400,000 to 650,000, most men and all women remained unable to vote.\n\n1833 Slavery Abolition Act\n\nThe UK Act was to abolish slavery throughout the British Empire (with initial exceptions of the territories held by the East India Company, Ceylon and St Helena).\n\nThe Act applied only to those under the age of six. Those older were forced to become apprentices until 1838, when enslaved men, women and children from the British Empire became free.\n\nThe Government paid out Â£20 million in compensation (roughly 40% of annual expenditure) for the loss of business assets."
