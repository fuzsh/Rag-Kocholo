Beagle. 2d edition. 1845.\n\nText Image PDF\n\nThis is Darwin's classic account describing his travels and discoveries during the five-year Beagle voyage (often called 'Voyage of the Beagle').\n\n'Nothing can be more improving to a young naturalist, than a journey in a distant country'\n\n'The natural history of these islands is eminently curious, and well deserves attention...we seem to be brought somewhere near to that great fact—that mystery of mysteries—the first appearance of new beings on this earth.'\n\nOn the origin of species. 1859.\n\nText Image PDF\n\nDarwin's most famous work, and one of the most important ever written. It revolutionized our understanding of life on earth. Darwin brings together many convincing kinds of evidence and arguments to show that living things change over time and that they are related to one another genealogically.\n\n'When the views entertained in this volume on the origin of species, or when analogous views are generally admitted, we can dimly forsee that there will be a considerable revolution in natural history.'\n\n'It may be said that natural selection is daily and hourly scrutinising, throughout the world, every variation, even the slightest; rejecting that which is bad, preserving and adding up all that is good; silently and insensibly working'\n\nThe descent of man. 1871.\n\nVol. 1. Text Image PDF\n\nVol. 2. Text Image PDF\n\nIn this work Darwin demonstrates that the difference between mankind and animals is not one of kind, but of degree. He also argues that sexual selection explains human racial differences.\n\n'The early progenitors of man were no doubt once covered with hair, both sexes having beards; their ears were pointed and capable of movement; and their bodies were provided with a tailâ¦and were arboreal in their habits'"
