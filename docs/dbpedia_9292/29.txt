19 April marks the anniversary of the death of naturalist Charles Darwin in 1882.

Charles Robert Darwin, born in 1809, established that all species of life have descended over time from common ancestry and proposed the theory that the branching pattern of evolution was a result of a process he called natural selection.

He published his theory in the book On the Origin of Species in 1859. On his death, aged 73, he was given a state funeral and buried in Westminster Abbey alongside John Herschel and Isaac Newton, one of only five non-royals to be granted a state funeral during the 19th century.
