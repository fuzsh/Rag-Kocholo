        "text": "One of Prince Dimitri’s favorite family stories involves King Louis XIV of France. Louis, Dimitri’s great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-grandfather, was undergoing surgery so painful that he fell unconscious. When the Sun King finally awoke, his subjects gathered around his bed in the palace at Versailles and asked how he felt. Even as he lay in agony, by Prince Dimitri’s recounting, Louis XIV stammered: “The man is suffering. But the king is all right.”\n\nFour centuries later in the kingdom of Manhattan, Dimitri Karageorgevich, the 51-year-old son of Prince Alexander of Yugoslavia and Princess Maria Pia of Savoy, must also reconcile his identities. The man awakes in a two-bedroom apartment on Sutton Place, uses the elliptical trainer at Equinox and spends most days working in his jewelry business. The prince works in an office filled with photographs of moments with famous friends like Pope John Paul II (Dimitri’s family gave the pope the Shroud of Turin), and he welcomes impromptu guests like the aged lady-in-waiting for Princess Marianne Bernadotte of Sweden. On weekends, the man shops for lettuce at Food Emporium and indulges in croissants from the patisserie Financier. The prince glides across the dance floor at a Carnival ball with the heiress Catherine Forbes by his side.\n\n“There’s always the duality,” he said while leaning back on his living room couch surrounded by paintings and photographs of his ancestors. “There’s the prince and the man.”\n\nNew York royalty can mean many things. The Astors and the Vanderbilts are self-made brand names that ruled society circles for at least a couple of generations. The streets are also dotted with Papaya Kings and Bedbug Kings, cartoon crowns of commercial credibility. And the place was, after all, named for the Duke of York, though he apparently never visited, said Christopher L. Brown, a historian at Columbia.\n\nAt the turn of the 20th century, some New York socialites traded their industrial fortunes through marriage for titles and royal affiliations. Today, the city is still filled with dreamers who climb into tall Christian Louboutins and head to A-list parties in hopes of meeting handsome princes before their heads hit their pillows.\n\nMr. Karageorgevich, whose friends call him P. D., is the rarefied real thing: Calculations vary widely, but Wikipedia puts him 1,375th in the line of succession to the British throne. He says he is related to each of the 11 reigning royal families in Europe — among his great-grandparents were Duchess Elizabeth of Bavaria, King Albert I of Belgium, Grand Duchess Elena Vladimirovna of Russia and Prince Nicholas of Greece. Lean and dignified, he could pass for an older brother of the white-suited, beauty-kissing princes of storybooks and Disney movies. He speaks French, Spanish and Italian — and English with a hybrid accent of the three. He is agile enough to chat graciously about books and charm paparazzi.\n\nThe unofficial ambassador for royal relatives who live here or pass through town, P. D. believes that royals serve as a source of aspiration for hoi polloi and cannot take their birthright lightly. So he admires Queen Elizabeth II — Aunt Lillibet — for her “wonderful sense of humor” matched by a clear understanding of duty and protocol.\n\n“She is a role model,” he explained. “That’s why she never had a face-lift. She never dyes her hair. Her values are that she belongs to her country, like priests there to protect their flock.”\n\nNot so much the queen’s former daughter-in-law, the late Princess Diana, whom P. D. chastises for publicly airing her marriage troubles and letting them distract from her royal responsibilities. “You can’t just go around and feel sorry for yourself,” he said.\n\n“It’s all about marketing and keeping the crowds dreaming,” Prince Dimitri added. “Americans have a very Hollywood view of royals. They don’t realize we have a very military view of life. We have to be role models.”\n\n•\n\nNew York has a long history of welcoming royals in exile, whether by choice or decree, to stay or simply to see the sights.\n\nJoseph Bonaparte, former King of Naples and Spain, arrived here in 1815 after his brother Napoleon’s defeat at the Battle of Waterloo. He first stayed at a boarding house and went on to help found Le Courrier des États-Unis, a French-language newspaper, according to Patricia Tyson Stroud, author of “The Man Who Had Been King.”\n\nEdward VII, son of Queen Victoria, was the honorary guest at one of the greatest social events of his time, a ball at the New York Academy of Music in November 1860. His grandson Edward VIII found haven in Manhattan social circles after abdicating his throne in 1936 to marry the divorcée Wallis Simpson. Queen Elizabeth the Queen Mother, who first visited New York in 1939 for the World’s Fair, came back in 1954, two years after the death of her husband.\n\n“It was her first trial run as a widow, and she was really thrilled to see how much the American people took to her and supported her,” said Will Swift, the former owner of a royalty bookstore in Manhattan.\n\nNoting that both Diana and the Duchess of York, Sarah Ferguson (known as Fergie), spent considerable time in New York and considered making it their home, Dr. Swift added, “It’s a place where they can live a more relaxed lifestyle, where they’re not treated with such formality.”\n\nPrince Dimitri counts members of at least a half-dozen royal families living in the tri-state area, most to little fanfare. Among them are Prince Philippos of Greece, who recently arrived in Manhattan to work at the EIM hedge fund; Count Riprand Arco-Zinneberg and his wife, Archduchess Maria Beatrice of Austria, who live in Greenwich, Conn., and run a commercial real estate business; and Geza von Habsburg, a descendant of Marie Antoinette’s mother and an expert on the jeweler Fabergé who lives in Westchester County.\n\nCount and Countess Arco, fourth cousins in the Habsburg dynasty, wed in 1980, a marriage that she said has been made “easier when you have a lot of common values.” His great-grandfather was Ludwig III of Bavaria; her grandmother was the Empress Zita. She grew up in Paris, he near Munich.\n\nThey came to the United States in 1983 and, six years later, started buying shopping centers from their kitchen table in Charlotte, N.C., where they were raising six daughters. Yes, the family has a 15th-century castle near Munich on the Danube and a summer place in the Dominican Republic. But these properties were paid for through their hard work in business, Count Arco said, not an inherited fortune. In his nondescript conference room in Midtown, the only sign of royalty was the family crest on Count Arco’s coffee mug.\n\n“People love their dreams and they romanticize things,” he said. “There is a great discrepancy between the clichés and the reality.”\n\nFor Dr. Habsburg, the 69-year-old son of Archduke Joseph Francis of Austria and Princess Anna of Saxony, living in the United States has freed him from many of the social obligations that come with his pedigree. Here, he can cook at a homeless shelter every Saturday and spend time antiquing, rather than attending ceremonial events.\n\nIn the living room of his comfortable Bronxville home, over the chirping of birds outside and the ticking of his grandfather clock, Dr. Habsburg remembered a childhood of “bombardments, fleeing, hunger, living in this gigantic royal castle in South Germany,” and described how his mother begged for food from peasants. As he has worked his way up through the auction world, Dr. Habsburg has bought back some of the paintings and sculptures that his family lost during World War II.\n\n“My life has been so much more fulfilling,” he said. “Back in Hungary, if nothing had changed, I would be just another rich royal with no mission in life.”\n\nSome, of course, come to New York to escape their august ancestry. Peter Karadordevic, the 30-year-old son of Crown Prince Alexander of Yugoslavia who moved to the East Side in 2009, shrugged off questions about his background as “a touchy subject.” He emphasized that he wanted to build a graphic design business without help, and he recently landed two interviews without using family connections.\n\n“I don’t like using my name,” Prince Peter said. “I don’t have to be the main event.”\n\n•\n\nMr. Karageorgevich credits his comfort at balancing the worlds of the prince and the man partly to his upbringing. While growing up in Paris, he said, his mother taught him that paparazzi make money when royals look less than royal. “Smile and don’t look annoyed,” she advised. “Just look as boring as possible.” He religiously followed this mantra when photographers followed him during his days at boarding school in Switzerland, and today continues a studied expressionlessness.\n\nPrince Dimitri moved to New York in 1984 for an 18-month training program at E. F. Hutton, and spent years working at Sotheby’s, ending up as senior vice president in the fine jewelry department. In 2003, he started his own jewelry line, Prince Dimitri, designing pieces with imported stones inspired in part by those worn by his ancestors, including a $620,000 necklace based on Greek geometry with 45 carats of diamonds.\n\nHis lineage has opened many doors in the city, and he does not hesitate to exploit it. Edgar Mitchell, an astronaut on Apollo 14 and a family friend, wrote his reference for his co-op board application; he was approved without an interview. He is flooded with party invitations and has appeared on best-dressed lists in Vanity Fair. He has a cameo in the coming movie “Wall Street: Money Never Sleeps.”\n\nAnd he is not above embarrassing impostors. At one Manhattan dinner, Prince Dimitri recalled, a man who called himself Michael de Savoia claimed to be the son of the King of Italy; when P. D. said that that would make him his mother’s brother, Mr. de Savoia abruptly fled. Another time, a Frenchman named Patrick D’Orleans said he was related to the Count of Paris, whom Prince Dimitri pointed out was related to his godmother.\n\n“He turned bright red, stood up and left,” P. D. said.\n\nIn his sunny eighth-floor apartment, Prince Dimitri has created a little fief of royal memorabilia. The walls, shelves and tables are crowded with photographs and paintings of princesses and queens decked in gossamer gowns or wrapped in furs, smiling, staring and sometimes scowling.\n\nCatherine the Great, an ancestor on his father’s side, grins comfortably in her portrait, while the Duchess of Orleans looks on the verge of tears in a work by a painter of the Van Dyck school. (Nonsense, said Prince Dimitri, insisting that the duchess was a happy royal because she was the favored sister-in-law of Louis XIV.) His grandmother Princess Olga of Greece, a long-limbed goddess with eyes sparkling more brightly than her jewels, sits near her equally beguiling sister, the Duchess of Kent. Then there are more modern photographs of his mother taken by Cecil Beaton, and one of the prince himself with Carla Bruni, the wife of the French president.\n\nWhen P. D. casually refers to the last family reunion, at “the wedding in England,” he means the Sept. 12, 2009, affair at Hampton Court uniting Princess Michael of Kent’s son, Lord Frederick Windsor, and the actress Sophie Winkleman. He recalls an earlier family wedding where the Queen Mother kept playing practical jokes and “her eyes were always glistening.” Then, when his cleaning woman interrupts to hand him the mail, he notices that a French tabloid has announced the coming wedding of another cousin, Prince Nicholas of Greece.\n\nPrince Dimitri, whose parents divorced when he was 7, sees marriage as a “prison,” and said he was not looking to crown some lucky princess. But if he were to marry, he said, he would want it to be to another royal, something he recognizes is unlikely.\n\n“Perhaps when I am old,” he said.\n\n•\n\nOn a February Friday at Cipriani’s high-ceilinged event space in Midtown, guests arrived adorned in feathers and gowns so wide they required attendants to hold open the doors. Dr. Ruth Westheimer was dressed as Groucho Marx. The Cake Boss, in his baker’s whites, showed off his latest confection, a five-tiered cake festooned with Mardi Gras beads.\n\nThe Serbian royal family had flown in for a Princes Ball, hosted by Princess Katherine of Belgrade — Prince Peter’s stepmother — whose mother once lived in New York, and whose sister still lives on Long Island. Prince Dimitri helped sell the $250 tickets, filling the ballroom with 350 people and helping to raise $100,000 for breast cancer research."
