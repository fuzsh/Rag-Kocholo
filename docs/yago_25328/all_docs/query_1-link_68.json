        "text": "It helps that their husbands, King Philippe of Belgium and King Willem-Alexander of the Netherlands, are also friends. In fact, Maxima visited Mathilde in hospital right after she gave birth to Princess Elisabeth, and Mathilde is the godmother of Máxima’s daughter Princess Alexia (she’s also godparent to Princess Isabella of Denmark).\n\n2. Crown Princess Victoria of Sweden and Crown Prince Frederik of Denmark\n\n“Frederik always comes into a room with sparkling eyes and sees people, both privately and officially,” Victoria is quoted as saying in a biography about the prince. “It is as if he meets one with his eyes and is very present, genuinely engaged and curious. There are people who ask questions, but never take time to wait for the answer. Frederik always waits for the answer.”\n\n3. Britain’s Queen Elizabeth and Queen Margrethe of Denmark\n\n4. Former Princess Tessy of Luxembourg and Prince Harry, Duke of Sussex\n\nFormer Princess Tessy of Luxembourg has regularly shared public messages of support for Prince Harry and his wife Meghan Markle, Duchess of Sussex. Tessy Antony de Nassau separated from Prince Louis in 2017, and lost her title when she divorced him in 2019.\n\nShe pointed to her close friendship with Harry in November 2021, when she shared a video from her work with the Oscars for Social Change, which champions minority groups and challenges homophobia, among other causes. “I have been the guest of honour and speaker for two years in a row along with my dear friend, fellow advocate and inspiration HRH Prince Harry,” she captioned the post.\n\n5. Queen Letizia of Spain and Queen Rania of Jordan\n\nAside from their husbands, King Felipe and King Abdullah II, showing public support for each other in statements of congratulations, or occasions when the two women work together on foreign trips, these women famously get along despite living continents apart.\n\nThe European and Middle Eastern royals are such good friends that people have noticed the pair have even started to look and dress alike, with the women often appearing to coordinate outfits and even being dubbed lookalikes. During a 2015 trip to Spain, the Jordanian royals were said to have received special treatment from their friends, who rushed to meet them at the airport instead of greeting them at the palace."
