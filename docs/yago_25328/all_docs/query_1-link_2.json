        "text": "He was born at the Chateau of Laeken on July 18 1942 and christened Alexandre Emmanuel Henri Albert Marie Leopold. The eldest of the three children of Leopold's second marriage, to Liliane Baels, he was also half-brother to the late King Baudouin.\n\nDespite, or perhaps because of, this gilded heritage, Alexandre's life was difficult from the start. The Belgian people resented their king marrying again. They had been devoted to Queen Astrid, his Swedish wife, and her death in a car accident in 1935 prompted great public grief. Many had sympathised with the king in his period of lonely dedication to his work, but few felt the same when he remarried in 1941. A banner headline in a Belgian paper read: \"Sire, we thought you shared our grief, but you buried your sorrow in the shoulders of another woman.\"\n\nAlexandre and his younger sister Marie-Christine were born of the marriage when their father was still king. He was deemed unfit to reign by his government after surrendering to the Nazis and ultimately abdicated in 1951. Another sister, Princess Maria-Esmeralda, was born in 1956. All three were recognised as members of the Belgian Royal family, but excluded from any rights to the throne.\n\nShortly before Belgium was liberated by the Allies in September 1944, the Belgian Royal family were deported to Nazi Germany and guarded by 70 members of the SS. They ate inadequate food and lived in fear of imminent death (not without reason, with one of their captors apparently attempting to feed them cyanide disguised as vitamin pills). Later they were transferred to Austria, and, after liberation by the US Army, settled at Pr√©gny, in Switzerland.\n\nKing Leopold was eventually allowed back to Brussels in July 1950, but, after serious rioting, was soon forced to abdicate in favour of Prince Baudouin. After the marriage of King Baudouin in 1960, Leopold moved his young family to Argenteuil House, near Waterloo, causing a serious rift by taking furniture and pictures with him. Leopold was denied access to his grandchildren when they were born to his first family. Thereafter he dropped out of public life and died in 1983.\n\nIn 1957 Alexandre was taken to Boston, where he underwent successful heart surgery, as a result of which his mother took a great interest in cardiology and founded a cardiological foundation which enabled many children to go to the United States for life-saving operations.\n\nAlexandre planned to study medicine but settled on a business career. After attending the Royal Military School in Belgium, he gained a degree from the Catholic University in Louvain.\n\nOn March 14 1991 he married Lea Inga Dora Wolman, who was twice-divorced, in a civil ceremony at Debenham, Suffolk. His mother was aware of the marriage, but disapproved; and despite having suffered ostracism herself, thereafter chose to invite her son to social occasions without his wife. The marriage was made public only in 1998.\n\nLast year Prince Alexandre's wife gave an interview in which she said her husband had wanted to assume some official responsibilities, but had been excluded from these. Instead he led the life of a bon vivant, enjoying fine food and the game of bridge."
