        "text": "Great Advanced EU Competition Law conference in London this week with an amazing line-up of regulators, competition law practitioners and inhouse counsel. Yesterday we closed the conference with a panel discussion on Compliance Best Practices. Thank you to Jamie Cooke for the engaging moderation to my fellow panelists Eva Krogh Dr. Gordon Christian Russell Hunter and Dr. Tobias Kruis, LL.M., CCEP-I for their excellent contributions. Some insights from our panel: üé§ We are yet to figure out the right use of technology in competition law compliance. Yet, as regulators increasingly use AI-based detection tools, companies cannot stay behind and should increasingly consider these to become part of their compliance program (but for now, do not leave that chatbot to give competition compliance advice alone...!) ü•Å Keeping internal stakeholders engaged on compliance takes creativity and a solid understanding of the business - do not underestimate the power of a market visit, strong personal relationships ,an appealing visual message and genuine tone-from-the top buy-in. üî® Building competition law compliance frameworks across jurisdictions takes thorough reflection on the right risk assessment criteria and a solid understanding of the local markets, product, etc. -- while still ensuring a consistent base. In the end, compliance programs can never fully close a gap but being clear to your board on what you prioritize and why is what compliance practitioners need to do. Informa Competition Law #informacompetitionlaw\n\nTo my in-house counsel colleagues across Europe: the annual ACC Europe ‚Äì Association of Corporate Counsel conference is fast approaching! I have the fondest memories of every time I attended the conference. It's for sure on of the most valuable fora for in-house counsel in Europe to connect, exchange best practices, get inspired and learn... and make new friends! This year, the incredible Maria Rocha Barros has acted as the program chair which can only mean this will be an EPIC edition -- spoiler alert: there will be keynotes from Lucy Parker, the author of ‚ÄúThe Activist Leader‚Äù , Dan McCrum (FT investigative journalist who wrote ‚ÄúMoney Men‚Äù), and Sue Williams, a seasoned hostage negotiator. So, not just a conference \"inside the legal box\" but bringing insights on mindset, leadership, and high stake negotiations. (PS this year, I have a different exciting gathering (my first GS1 General Assembly, bringing together our GS1 Member Organizations in the eternal city of Rome) so I'm wishing you all a great conference, and look forward to hearing how ACC went ;))\n\nNEW JOB ALERT Happy New Year! Thrilled to announce that I have joined the GS1 family as General Counsel Global Office. GS1‚Äôs history goes back 50 years ago, when its barcode launched a digital revolution that forever changed the way the world does business. Yes, that sound of a beep at the checkout counter (even known to my three-year old who effortlessly self-scans at the supermarket!). Since then, GS1‚Äôs reach has expanded to become the most widely used standards system in the world, telling the story behind products - where they originated, what they contain and where they have been during their journey. GS1 has Member Organizations in 116 countries, over two million user companies and 10 billion daily transactions. It is active in retail, e-commerce, healthcare and beyond, and is here to help address the world‚Äôs sustainability and transparency challenges. Many thanks to my fellow GS1 Leadership Team members for the trust and the warm welcome. Looking forward to the collaboration with everyone at the GS1 family across the globe ‚Äì see you at the Global Forum in February!\n\nJupiler is now official sponsor of the Belgian women's national soccer team, the Red Flames! We're proud to extend our long-standing partnership with the Royal Belgian Football Association and unite Belgians behind both the Red Devils & the Red Flames. With this partnership, Jupiler sets to champion the Red Flames in their ambition to become a top international team and makes a commitment to support the Red Flames in the same way it has always supported the Red Devils. It starts now! Let's get all behind the Red Flames this Friday 22/09 for their first important Women‚Äôs Nations League's game against the Netherlands!\n\nA leader can only be as good as their team. As I feel honored to be on thelegal500's GC Powerlist for Benelux, I can't help thinking of the energy, hard work and passion of our team and colleagues here at AB InBev legal & corporate affairs, some of whom I've worked together with for years now. üçª So, I'll celebrate the occasion with this extract of our team manifesto (yes, it has a football ‚öΩ metaphor -- we are the Belgium's national team official sponsor after all üòà ) \"Being at Legal & Corporate Affairs in AB InBev BeNeFraLux is special. Our Company's culture of dreaming big inspires us to be a innovative, creative and challenging team that is not just a goalkeeper but plays the entire soccer pitch and shapes direction together with our colleagues. Our commitment to quality and expertise combined with our bigger picture view enable us to challenge perceived boundaries while being able to create a framework that provides direction. We connect teams while doing so. We dare to be bold. We stand behind the positivity and optimism that our company purpose of ‚ÄúA Future with more Cheers‚Äù brings and play a key role in communicating on it.\" Hope you're inspired! Let me know what you think ;) #legal #team #bestbeerjob\n\nWhat a joy to have met friends old and new at this week's ACC Europe ‚Äì Association of Corporate Counsel conference in Brussels. Some of the many insights I took back home: üåÅ \"Building Bridges\" is key to be succesful as a corporate counsel. Communication is a critical skill for in-house counsel who must seek to listen actively and connect, and it is often undervalued ‚ùìÔ∏è\"If you give only legal answers, expect legal questions\": the legal team can be a trusted advisor also beyond legal. Great in-house counsel have a deep understanding of their business and do not hesitate to weigh in üöÄ To make an impact on legal operations, one must run the legal department as a business, focusing on people, processes and technology. It takes bright people with an excellent understanding of process to make a true impact with #legalops üîÑ Getting outside of and connecting with other counsel is critical to keep providing strong and innovative advice. Learned a bunch of best practices at the conference (ranging from advocacy to contracting over ESG) and am determined to reach out more to peers when in doubt! üôè And last but certainly not least: help yourself before helping others. Resilience requires more than ever a conscious effort and I believe that is especially true in leanly staffed legal teams! My small commitment: do a simple 10 min breathing exercise every day - thanks to the insights from The Resilience Institute It's been a true honor to have been on the conference advisory board this year, in the fine company of Tarik Gause Yves Heijmans Cristina Alexandrescu Afonso Cardoso de Menezes Fiona de Kerckhove Russell Hunter M√ºge Bulat √áetinkaya Bruno Jean-Etienne Alessia PRIMICERI El-Hassan Maamoun and of course the unforgettable Stefanie Blankestijn who has done much more than keeping us honest to the schedule! Thank you to the speakers and ACC Europe - looking forward to the Milan edition next year!"
