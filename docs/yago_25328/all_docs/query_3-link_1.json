        "text": "Princess Lea of Belgium (born Lea Inga Dora Wolman on 2 December 1951) is the widow of Prince Alexander of Belgium.\n\nEarly Life and Family\n\nPrincess Lea was born on 2 December 1951, the daughter of Sigismund Wolman and Lisa Bornstein.\n\nMarriages and Issue\n\nShe married Serge Victorovich Spetschinsky in 1975 (son of Victor Sergeyevich Spetschinsky, President of the Russian Nobility Association in Belgium), from whom she was divorced in 1980. They had a daughter, Laetitia Spetschinsky (born in 1976), who is now married to Didier Nagant de Deuxchaisnes and mother of two sons (Charles-Albert b.2009) and Alexandre (b.2013) and a daughter (b.2010)\n\nIn 1982 Lea married Robert Bichara, and they had a son, Renaud Bichara, on 1 September 1983.\n\nAfter her second divorce she wed Prince Alexander, in Debenham, Suffolk, on 14 March 1991. They had been introduced in 1986 by former defense minister Leon Mundeleer. Alexander asked her to accompany him to the cinema. She vacillated initially, but they began to enjoy dining out together, Alexander being a gourmet, according to his future wife.\n\nThe couple had no children together, and the marriage was kept secret until 1998, as reportedly the prince feared his mother would disapprove.\n\nAlexander's marriage contravened Article 85 of the Belgium constitution, which deprived of the right of succession to the throne any descendant of King Leopold I who marries without the sovereign's permission.\n\nIn 2008 published a book of photographs from the life of her husband and his family, titled Le Prince Alexandre de Belgique, because she felt that he was too little-known in Belgium.\n\nTitle\n\n2 December Her Royal Highness Princess Lea of Belgium"
