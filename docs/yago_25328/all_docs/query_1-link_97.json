        "text": "Advertisement\n\nThe Grand Duchy of Luxembourg doesn't get a lot of turns in the spotlight.\n\nIt's an independent country tinier than Rhode Island, the smallest U.S. state, and it would fit inside Germany, its neighbor to the east, 138 times with room to spare. It won no medals at the 2012 London Olympics - in fact it hasn't won a medal at the summer Games since 1952.\n\nBut now, it is Luxembourg's turn to shine.\n\nPrince Guillaume, the heir to the throne - the grand duke-to-be - married Belgian Countess Stephanie de Lannoy in a civil wedding this afternoon.\n\nThe two-day affair includes fireworks, concerts and a religious ceremony tomorrow morning.\n\nScroll down for video\n\nCountess Stephanie de Lannoy and Crown Prince Guillaume of Luxembourg are seated prior to their civil ceremony this afternoon at the Hotel De Ville in Luxembourg\n\nThe couple wave to the adoring crowed outside the City Town Hall\n\nA glittering array of European royalty attended a gala dinner in the couple's honour this evening.\n\nThe guest list for the religious ceremony includes kings, queens, princes and princesses from European countries including, among others, Belgium, Norway, Sweden, Lichtenstein, Denmark, the Netherlands, Romania and Britain, which is sending Prince Edward, Queen Elizabeth's youngest child, and his wife, Sophie.\n\nNon-European royalty will be attending, as well, from Morocco, Japan and Jordan and elsewhere.\n\nWith all those royals coming to Luxembourg, can international attention be far behind?\n\nA glittering array of European royalty attended a gala dinner in the couple's honour. Left, Dutch Prince Willem-Alexander and Princess Maxima; right, Belgium's King Albert II and Queen Paola arrive\n\nAlso in attendance were Princess Mathilde and Crown Prince Philippe of Belgium\n\nNorway's Crown Princess Mette-Marit and Crown Prince Haakon arrive for the dinner; right, Norway's King Harald V and Queen Sonja enjoy the celebrations\n\n'It's good for Luxembourg,' said Nadine Chenet, a 46-year-old street cleaner who was picking up cigarette butts with pincers in front of the grand ducal palace. 'Many people will come now.'\n\nBesides, she just plain likes the royal family, she said: They give a good impression of the country.\n\nThat's a sentiment common in Luxembourg. To all appearances, the bride and groom are a lovely couple. He is 30, with dark hair and an immaculate beard. She is 28, blonde and smiling. In public appearances, including at the London Olympics, they have appeared besotted with each other.\n\nAccording to biographies distributed by the royal court, each has an array of interests befitting those who are to the manner born.\n\nPrincess Marie Chantal, Prince Pavlos, King Constantine and Queen Anne Marie of Greece at the wedding\n\nPrince Nicolaus of Liechtenstein\n\nPrincess Margaretha of Liechtenstein\n\nArch duchess Marie Astrid of Austria\n\nBelgium's Queen Fabiola is helped in to the function; right, Grand Duchess Maria-Teresa and Grand-Duke Henri of Luxembourg\n\nGuillaume speaks four languages, has studied international politics, is a lieutenant colonel in the Luxembourg army (a force of 900 soldiers), and has been engaged in humanitarian work in other countries, including Nepal.\n\nHis bride has studied the influence of German romanticism on Russian romanticism, plays piano and violin, swims, skis, and says she reads three books at a time.\n\nIn the language department, she already speaks French and German - two of Luxembourg's three official languages - and, perhaps more importantly, is studying the third, which is called Luxembourgish. She plans to renounce her Belgian citizenship in order to become, eventually, Luxembourg's grand duchess.\n\nLuxembourg is a linguistically complicated country, a reflection of its complicated past. It began as a Roman fortress. It has, at one time or another, fallen under the control of Spain, France and Austria.\n\nIn 1839, it gained its independence from the Netherlands, but lost more than half its territory to Belgium, which now has a province of the same name. In the 20th century, Germany swept through Luxembourg twice despite its protestations of neutrality.\n\nFrom left, Prince Sebastien, Prince Louis and Prince Felix of Luxembourg ; right, Princess Martha Louise of Norway\n\nPrince Emanuele Filiberto of Savoy and wife Clotilde Courau; right, Crown Prince Alexander II and Crown Princess Katherine of Serbia\n\nLuxembourgish is related to German, but it is primarily a spoken language. In the country's schools, elementary students take all their classes in German.\n\nWhen students reach their teens, gradually all classes are converted to French. And English is studied the entire time.\n\nBut the language dearest to their hearts is Luxembourgish. As 71-year-old retired engineer Rene Ries - a typical Luxembourger, with a French first name and a German last name - said, Luxembourgish is generally spoken in the home.\n\nWhen there is a complaint, the police file their reports in German. Then the lawyers litigate the case in French.\n\nAsked in which language he felt most comfortable, Ries replied without hesitation that it was Luxembourgish. But he admitted he had trouble writing it.\n\nUnder duress, he could write his daughter a postcard, he said, but the language is most commonly spoken, not written.\n\nGrand Duke Henri of Luxembourg, Countess Stephanie de Lannoy and Hereditary Grand Duke Guillaume of Luxembourg at the gala dinner\n\nEsteemed guests raised a toast to the happy couple\n\nLuxembourg, an important financial centre and home to the world's largest steel manufacturer, continues to prosper despite Europe's economic trouble.\n\nThe country has the second-highest gross domestic product per capita in the world, more than £50,000 ($80,000) - though its population of about 510,000 people is still smarting from having lost the No. 1 spot to Qatar. The capital city has 80,000 inhabitants and 120,000 jobs.\n\nFor that reason, more than 43 per cent of the people in Luxembourg are foreign nationals, compared to a European Union average of 6.4 per cent.\n\nWhen he greets people in the public square, Ries speaks not German, not French, not English, but Luxembourgish. It is not to shame the others. It is to show he is a genuine Luxembourger.\n\nNatives of the Grand Duchy, heavily influenced by Catholicism, are very proper and can be dour.\n\n'When we say, \"It's not too bad,\"' Ries said, 'we mean it's good.'\n\nBut above all, they are proud. Proud of their multilingualism. Proud of their grand duchy. And proud of their royal family.\n\nThe current grand duke, Henri, who is 57, is popular. People can greet him on the street without bowing down before him.\n\nHis 31-year marriage to Grand Duchess Maria Teresa appears to be very happy. Showcasing the royal family, as the country will do this week, allows Luxembourg to put its best foot forward.\n\nFor, as Ries emphasised more than once, the Luxembourgish royals - in contrast to some others - do not sunbathe topless. And for him, that is a source of pride, one he is happy to share with the rest of the world.\n\n'It is a good family,' he said."
