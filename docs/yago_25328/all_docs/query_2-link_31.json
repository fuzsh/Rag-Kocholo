        "text": "Princess Léa of Belgium (b. Etterbeek, 2 December, 1951), Princess Alexandre of Belgium (French: princesse Alexandre de Belgique), \"née\" Léa Inga Dora Wolman, is the wife of Prince Alexandre of Belgium, younger half-brother of King Albert II of the Belgians, of the late King Baudouin I, and of the late Grand Duchess Joséphine-Charlotte of Luxembourg.\n\nBorn the daughter of Sigismund Wolman and wife Lisa Bornstein (Nuremberg, 1916 - Brussels, 29 October, 1996), in 1975 she married Serge Victorovich Spetschinsky, born in Léopoldville, Belgian Congo, on 25 April, 1951, from whom she was divorced in 1980. They had a daughter Laetitia Spetschinsky, born in 1976 and married to Didier Nagant de Deuxchaisnes. In 1982 she married Robert Bichara, and they had a son Renaud Bichara on 1 September, 1983.\n\nAfter her second divorce she wed Prince Alexander, in Debenham, Suffolk, on 14 March, 1991. They had been introduced in 1986 by a former defence minister Léon Mundeleer. Alexandre asked her to accompany him to the cinema. She vacillated initially, but they began to enjoy dining out together, Alexandre being a gourmand, according to his future wife.

Apparently the prince feared his mother would disapprove.

She explained in a May 2008 interview with \" [http://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Point_de_vue_%28hebdomadaire%29 Point de Vue] \", \"On 2 December 1991, a royal decree declared that henceforth the title of Prince or Princess of Belgium would no longer be transmitted by marriage, but would be created by royal decree.
