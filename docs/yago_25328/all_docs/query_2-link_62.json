        "text": "Prime Minister Pierlot spoke on French radio, saying that the King’s decision to surrender went against the Belgian Constitution. The decision, he said, was not only a military decision but also a political decision, and the king had acted without his ministers’ advice, and therefore contrary to the Constitution.\n\nIt was impossible, however, to summon the Belgian Chamber of Representatives or Belgian Senate at this time, or to appoint a regent. After the liberation of Belgium in September 1944, the government asked Leopold’s brother, Prince Charles, to serve as regent.\n\nAfter Leopold’s surrender, the British press denounced him as “Traitor King” and “King Rat”; the Daily Mirror published a picture of Leopold with the headline “The Face That Every Woman Now Despises”. A group of Belgian refugees in Paris placed a message at King Albert’s statue denouncing his son as “your unworthy successor”. French Prime Minister Paul Reynaud accused Leopold of treason.\n\nUpon Leopold’s surrender, the government ministers left for exile, mostly in France. When France fell at the end of June 1940, several ministers sought to return to Belgium. They made an overture to Leopold but were rebuffed:\n\nPierlot and his government saw that Western Europe had been conquered by the Germans completely and tried to make amends to their king. Would it be possible for them to return to Belgium and form a new government? Leopold showed his stubborn nature; he was insulted by his ministers… His reply was short: “The situation of the king is unaltered; he does not engage in politics and does not receive politicians.\n\nBecause of the great popularity of the king, and the unpopularity of the civil government from the middle of 1940, the government crisis persisted\n\nOn 2 August 1940, several ministers conferred in Le Perthus in France near the Spanish border. Prime Minister Pierlot and Foreign Minister Spaak were persuaded to go to London, but they were able to start out for London only at the end of August and could travel only via neutral Spain and Portugal. When they reached Spain, they were arrested and detained by the regime of Francisco Franco; they finally arrived in London on 22 October.\n\nMeeting with Hitler\n\nLeopold rejected cooperation with the government of Nazi Germany and refused to administer Belgium in accordance with its dictates; thus, the Germans implemented a military government. Leopold attempted to assert his authority as monarch and head of the Belgian government, although he was a prisoner of the Germans. Despite his defiance of the Germans, the Belgian government-in-exile in London maintained that the King did not represent the Belgian government and was unable to reign. The Germans held him at first under house arrest at the Royal Castle of Laeken.\n\nHaving since June 1940 desired a meeting with Adolf Hitler in respect of the situation of Belgian prisoners of war, Leopold III finally met with him on November 19, 1940. Leopold wanted to persuade Hitler to release Belgian POWs, and issue a public statement about Belgium’s future independence. Hitler refused to speak about the independence of Belgium or issue a statement about it. In refusing to publish a statement, Hitler preserved the King from being seen as cooperating with Germany, and thus engaged in treasonous acts, which would likely have obliged him to abdicate upon the liberation of Belgium. “The [German] Chancellor saved the king two times.”\n\nOn this day 60 years ago:\n\nKing Baudouin of the Belgians (1930-1993) marries Spanish aristocrat Doña Fabiola de Mora y Aragón (1928-2014)\n\nDoña Fabiola de Mora y Aragón was born in Madrid, Spain, at the Palacio Zurbano, the main residence of the Marqués de Casa Riera. She was the daughter of Don Gonzalo de Mora y Fernández y Riera y del Olmo, 4th Marqués de Casa Riera, 2nd Count of Mora (1887–1957), and his wife, Doña Blanca de Aragón y Carrillo de Albornoz y Barroeta-Aldamar y Elío (1892–1981), daughter of the 6th Marchioness of Casa Torres and Viscountess of Baiguer. Her godmother was Queen Victoria Eugenia of Spain.\n\nOn December 15, 1960, Fabiola married Baudouin, who had been King of the Belgians since the abdication of his father, Leopold III, in 1951. At the marriage ceremony in the Cathedral of St. Michael and St. Gudula, she wore a 1926 Art Deco tiara that had been a gift of the Belgian state to her husband’s mother, Astrid of Sweden, upon her marriage to Leopold III.\n\nHer dress of satin and ermine was designed by the couturier Cristóbal Balenciaga. Fabiola was a hospital nurse at the time of her engagement; TIME magazine, in its 26 September 1960, issue, called Doña Fabiola the “Cinderella Girl” and described her as “an attractive young woman, though no raving beauty” and “the girl who could not catch a man.” On the occasion of her marriage, Spanish bakers set out to honour Fabiola and created a type of bread, “la fabiola”, which is still made in Palencia.\n\nThe explorer Guido Derom named the Queen Fabiola Mountains – a newly discovered range of Antarctic mountains – in her honour in 1961. She also has several varieties of ornamental plants named after her.\n\nThe royal couple had no children, as the Queen’s five pregnancies ended in miscarriage in 1961, 1962, 1963, 1966 and 1968. Fabiola openly spoke about her miscarriages in 2008: ‘You know, I myself lost five children. You learn something from that experience. I had problems with all my pregnancies, but you know, in the end I think life is beautiful’.\n\nLeopold III (November 3, 1901 – September 25, 1983) was King of the Belgians from 1934 until 1951, when he abdicated in favour of the heir apparent, his son\n\nPrince Leopold was born in Brussels, the first child of King Albert I of the Belgians and his consort, Duchess Elisabeth in Bavaria.* In 1909 his father became King of the Belgians, as Albert I, and Prince Leopold became Duke of Brabant, the title of the heir to the Belgian throne.\n\nAstrid (far right) with her mother and sisters\n\nPrince Leopold married Princess Astrid of Sweden in a civil ceremony in Stockholm on November 4, 1926, followed by a religious ceremony in Brussels on November 10. Princess Astrid was the third child and youngest daughter of Prince Carl, Duke of Västergötland, and his wife, Princess Ingeborg of Denmark.\n\nHer father was the third son of Oscar II, King of Sweden and Norway, by his wife, Sophia of Nassau. Her mother was a daughter of King Frederick VIII of Denmark by his wife, Louise of Sweden. Astrid’s father was a younger brother of King Gustav V of Sweden, and her mother was the younger sister of kings Christian X of Denmark and Haakon VII of Norway. The marriage produced three children:\n\n1. Princess Joséphine-Charlotte of Belgium, (October 11, 1927 – January 10, 2005) Grand Duchess consort of Luxembourg, through married on to Prince Jean, Grand Duke of Luxembourg.\n\n2. King Baudouin of Belgium, Duke of Brabant, Count of Hainaut, (September 7, 1930 – July 31, 1993).\n\n3. King Albert II of Belgium, Prince of Liège, (June 6, 1934 -) He abdicated in July 2013.\n\nOn August 29, 1935, while the king and queen were driving along the winding, narrow roads near their villa at Küssnacht am Rigi, Schwyz, Switzerland, on the shores of Lake Lucerne, Leopold lost control of the car which plunged into the lake, killing Queen Astrid.\n\nLeopold married Lilian Baels on September 11, 1941 in a secret, religious ceremony, with no validity under Belgian law. The new Princess of Réthy was soon expecting their first child, the ceremony took place on December 6, 1941. They had three children in total:\n\n1. Prince Alexandre of Belgium, (July 18, 1942 – November 29, 2009) married Léa Wolman.\n\n2. Princess Marie-Christine of Belgium, (February 6, 1951 -) Her first marriage, to Paul Drucker in 1981, lasted 40 days (and formally divorced in 1985); she subsequently married Jean-Paul Gourges in 1989.\n\n3. Princess Marie-Esméralda of Belgium, (September 30, 1956 – ) a journalist, her professional name is Esmeralda de Réthy. She married pharmacologist Salvador Moncada in 1998. They have a son and a daughter.\n\nThe Duke of Brabant succeeded to the throne of Belgium on February 23, 1934, as King Leopold III following the death of his father King Albert I.\n\nThe controversial reign of Leopold III would need several blog entries to detail this complex topic and which I will do in the future. Therefore today, I will simply summarize the information.\n\nKing Leopold III during World War II\n\nLeopold’s controversial actions during the Second World War resulted in a political crisis known as the Royal Question. The Royal Question was a major political crisis in Belgium that lasted from 1945 to 1951, coming to a head between March and August 1950. During Leopold’s exile from 1944 until 1950, Leopold’s brother, Charles, served as prince regent while Leopold was declared unable to reign.\n\nThe “question” at stake surrounded whether King Leopold III could return to the country and resume his royal duties as King of the Belgians amid allegations that his actions during World War II had gone contrary to the provisions of the Belgian Constitution. In 1950, following a referendum, Leopold was allowed to return from exile to Belgium, but the continuing political instability pressured him to abdicate on July 16, 1951 in favor of his eldest son Baudouin.\n\nIn retirement, he followed his passion as an amateur social anthropologist and entomologist and travelled the world, collecting zoological specimens. Two species of reptiles are named after him, Gehyra leopoldi and Polemon leopoldi. He went to Senegal and strongly criticized the French decolonization process, and he explored the Orinoco and the Amazon with Heinrich Harrer.\n\nLeopold died in 1983 in Woluwe-Saint-Lambert aged 81, following emergency heart surgery. He was interred next to Queen Astrid in the royal vault at the Church of Our Lady of Laeken. Leopold’s second wife, the Princess de Réthy, was later interred with them.\n\nNotable royal descendants\n\nAs of 2020 two of Leopold’s grandsons are reigning monarchs: Grand Duke Henri of Luxembourg since 2000, and King Philippe of Belgium since 2013.\n\n* Duchess Elisabeth in Bavaria was the daughter of Karl-Theodor, Duke in Bavaria, head of a cadet branch of the Bavarian Royal Family and an ophthalmologist. She was named after her father’s sister, Empress Elisabeth of Austria, better known as Sisi, wife of Emperor Franz Joseph of Austria-Hungry. Her mother was Maria Josepha of Portugal, daughter of exiled Miguel I of Portugal and his wife Adelaide of Löwenstein-Wertheim-Rosenberg.\n\nOfficial announcement from the Court of Luxembourg.\n\nIn English:\n\n“It is with great sadness that I inform you of the death of my beloved father, His Royal Highness Grand Duke Jean, who has left us in peace, surrounded by the affection of his family.”\n\n-Henri, Grand Duke of Luxembourg\n\nMy sympathies to his family and the people of Luxembourg….\n\nHRH Jean, Grand Duke of Luxembourg\n\nJean (Jean Benoît Guillaume Robert Antoine Louis Marie Adolphe Marc d’Aviano; 5 January 5, 1921 – April 23, 2019) reigned as Grand Duke of Luxembourg from 1964 until his abdication in 2000. He was the first Luxembourg grand duke of French agnatic descent.\n\nJean was the eldest son of Grand Duchess Charlotte and Prince Félix of Bourbon-Parma (Prince Félix was one of the 24 children of the deposed Robert I, Duke of Parma, being the duke’s sixth child and third son by his second wife, Maria Antonia of Portugal). Jean’s primary education was initially in Luxembourg, before attending Ampleforth College in England. In 1938, he was officially named Hereditary Grand Duke as heir to the throne of Luxembourg. While Luxembourg was occupied by Germans during the Second World War, the grand ducal family was abroad in exile. Jean studied at the Université Laval in Quebec City.\n\nHRH Jean, Grand Duke of Luxembourg\n\nJean later volunteered to join the British army’s Irish Guards in 1942, and after graduating from the Royal Military Academy Sandhurst, received his commission in 1943. He participated in the Normandy landings and the Battle for Caen, and joined the Allied forces in the liberation of Luxembourg. From 1984 until 2000, he was colonel of the Irish Guards.\n\nOn April 9, 1953, Jean married Princess Joséphine-Charlotte of Belgium (the oldest child and only daughter of the King Leopold III of the Belgians and his first wife, Astrid of Sweden) Jean and Joséphine-Charlotte had five children:\n\nPrincess Marie Astrid of Luxembourg (b. February 17, 1954)\n\nHenri, Grand Duke of Luxembourg (b. April 16, 1955)\n\nPrince Jean of Luxembourg (b. May 15, 1957)\n\nPrincess Margaretha of Luxembourg (b. May 15, 1957)\n\nPrince Guillaume of Luxembourg (b. May 1, 1963)\n\nOn November 12, 1964, Grand Duchess Charlotte abdicated and Jean succeeded her as Grand Duke of Luxembourg. He then reigned for 36 years before he himself abdicated on 7 October 2000 and was succeeded by his son, Grand Duke Henri.\n\nGrand Duke Jean taking the oath to the Constitution.\n\nBetween 1959-72 Grand Duke Jean was also 5th in line of succession to the defunct throne of the Duchy of Parma. At his death Jean, Grand Duke of Luxembourg was 98 years old.\n\nAs I write this post it was announced that HM King Albert II of Belgium will abdicate the throne on July 21 due to health. The king is 79 years old and his 53 year old son, Prince Philippe, the Duke of Brabant will take the throne. I wonder if the abdication by the Dutch monarch in April is what started Albert II to think of abdication?\n\nAlbert came to the throne 20 years ago in 1993 when his brother, King Baudouin died at the age of 62. Many were surprised that Albert to the throne because it has been assumed for years that Prince Philippe, the Duke of Brabant, would succeed his childless uncle, King Baudouin. Albert did become king and it has been a difficult 20 years on the throne.\n\nBelgium has seen political crises and ethnic and cultural strife. Like all of the constitutional monarchs Albert doesn’t have any real political power and his role is mostly ceremonial, he did, at one point in his reign exercised some political authority. In 2010-2011 the Belgian Parliament was at a stalemate unable to form a government for 541 days after elections failed to find a clear winner. The king took an advisory role with the political leaders helping to resolve the stalemate. Although it was a difficult time for him he demonstrated the positive role a neutral head of state can play in the daily running of the government.\n\nRespect for the royal family seems to be one of the forces holding the country together. There has often been tensions between the two main language communities of Flemish and French in Belgium. This issue divisive issue has brought down several governments, creating frequent political instability.\n\nThis will be the second abdication of a Belgian monarch. Albert II was the 6th Belgian monarch since the creation of that throne in 1831. In 1830 a revolution in the Netherlands happened and the Southern Provinces separated from the Netherlands forming the state of Belgium. In 1831 they selected Prince Leopold of Saxe-Coburg-Gotha as their king. Leopold was the uncle to both Queen Victoria of Great Britain and her husband Prince Albert. For a time Prince Leopold was married to Princess Charlotte of Wales who was second in line to the British throne until her death in childbirth in 1817.\n\nIn 1951, King Leopold III abdicated shortly after his return from exile which occurred during World War II. Many in Belgium felt his actions during the war were treasonous so in an effort to avoid tearing the country apart, and to preserve the monarchy, Leopold decided on August 1, 1950 to withdraw in favour of his 20-year-old son Baudouin. The abdication went into effect on July 16, 1951.\n\nThis will be the third abdication this year following Pope Benedict XVI and Queen Beatrix of the Netherlands. I have softened my view on abdication. I f you look at the list of any monarchy in Europe you will see that people are living much longer than they used to. With that in mind I am beginning to see that there is no valid reason why a monarch should carry the burdens of state when their health declines. Now some may prefer that the monarch retire, keep the title, and allow the hier to take the throne as regent. This is similar to how the future George IV took over for his ailing father. This makes the regent king…or queen…in all but name.\n\nI still like that arrangement and prefer it actually, but I do not feel so rigidly attached to it as I have in the past. I have no problem when a monarch feels the need to step down and pass the crown to the next in line.\n\nThe King was born on June 6, 1934 the second son of King Leopold III (1901–1983) of Belgium and his first wife Princess Astrid of Sweden (1905–1935). Albert was not expected to be king. His elder brother, King Baudouin (1930-1993), succeeded his father upon his abdication in 1951. King Baudouin was married to Fabiola de Mora y Aragón and although the union was a happy one, they did not have any children. Even then Albert was not expected to be king. It was understood that Albert’s son, the Prince Philippe, Duke of Brabant, would eventually succeed his uncle the king. I was surprised, and read that many Belgians were also surprised, when Albert assumed the kingship upon his brothers death in 1993. The king is first cousin to the reigning King Harald V of Norway and the uncle of the reigning Grand Duke Henri of Luxemburg.\n\nHe was born in Stuyvenberg Castle, Brussels. In 1940 when Belgium was occupied by Germany, Prince Albert, his elder sister Princess Joséphine-Charlotte and his brother Prince Baudouin, left the country where they spent time first in France and then later Spain. When they returned to Belgium later that year the young Belgian royals continued their studies at school until they were deported byu the Germans in 1944. Liberated by the American troops in 1945. But because of political unrest in Belgium, which would even tally lead to his father’s abdication, King Leopold and his family moved to the villa “Le Reposoir” in Pregny, Switzerland, and then they moved to Austria where they remained until returning to Belgium in July of 1950. .\n\nKnown as Prince Albert of Liege he represented Belgium (a Catholic country) at the Vatican for the papal coronation of Pope John XXIII in 1958. While at a reception at the Belgian embassy Albert met Italian Princess Paola Ruffo di Calabria. The two soon became an item and were married on July 2, 1959 and have three children. The eldest child and heir to the throne is Prince Philippe, Duke of Brabant (1960-) and is married to Mathilde d’Udekem d’Acoz . Their next child is Princess Astrid (1962-), married to Archduke Lorenz of Austria-Este, Duke of Modena. Princess Astrid was falsely rumored to be the future bride of Prince Charles, the Prince of Wales, back in the late 70s. Their youngest child is Prince Laurent (1963-) who is married to Claire Coombs who was created a princess of Belgium. The five children of Princess Astrid and Archduke Lorenz were also created princes and princesses of Belgium.\n\nPrior to becoming king Albert’s main job was the Honorary President of the Board of Directors of the Belgian Foreign Trade Office. He held this office for 31 years where he presided over trade missions throughout the world and visited Belgian companies that were operating in the field export. As king his duties are representative. Here is the section on his duties as king from the website of the Belgian Royal Family.\n\nhttp://www.monarchie.be/monarchy-today\n\nThe Monarchy today\n\nThe King of Belgium’s duties include contacts with a wide range of representatives of Belgian society: members of the federal government, of the community and regional governments, MPs and political leaders, representatives of the economic, social, cultural and scientific sectors, academia, the media …\n\nThe King and the members of the Royal Family also keep in close touch with the citizens of Belgium, promoting private and public initiatives that help bring about social improvements. The King and the members of the Royal Family represent Belgium abroad at the highest levels (State visits, trade missions, participation in international meetings).\n\nThe king has been on the throne for 19 years and has been a solid representative of the Belgian nation. In 2010-2011 when the was no government for 451 days the king was a stabilizing presence while the politicians worked through their deadlock.\n\nMay he continue in good health and long may he reign."
