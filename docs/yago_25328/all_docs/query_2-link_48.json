Petrucella, December 16, 1994\n\nRevisions: Updated December, 2006; Reorganized by Edith Serkownek and additional materials integrated, December, 2007; Last Update: October 2020\n\nDescriptive Rules: DACS\n\nOrigination (principal individuals): Marie, Queen, consort of Ferdinand I, King of Romania, 1875-1938; Alexandra, Mother, 1908-; Harris, Ray Baker, 1907-; Stefan Habsburg, Archduke\n\nInclusive Dates: 1793-1991\n\nBulk Dates: bulk 1918-1991\n\nExtent: 30 cubic feet (29 boxes = 13 record storage boxes, 3 half size record storage boxes, 1 document box, 1 slim document box, 10 flat boxes and 1 oversized box) and 2 inscribed marble monuments\n\nPhysical Location: 11th floor\n\nLanguage of Materials: Significant portions of the collection are in Romanian and English, with some material in French, German and Spanish.\n\nAbstract: The Queen Marie of Romania papers contains correspondence, photographs, newspaper clippings, personal belongings and other miscellaneous items related to the lives of Queen Marie and her daughter, Princess Ileana. In addition, the collection contains literary pieces by Romanian authors and poets, literary journals, newspapers and books.\n\nBiography: Queen Marie was born Marie Alexandra Victoria on October 29, 1875 in Kent, England. She was the daughter of Alfred, Duke of Edinburgh and the former Grand Duchess Marie Alexandrovna of Russia. Marie was the granddaughter of Queen Victoria and married Ferdinand of Romania in 1893. Marie, who became Queen of the Romanians in 1914, was popular among the Romanian public and served as a nurse during World War I. Queen Marie had six children of which Princess Ileana was fifth, being born in 1909. Queen Marie died in 1938.\n\nPrincess Ileana and her husband, Anton Habsburg, Archduke of Austria, also had six children with Stefan being the oldest. Princess Ileana moved to the United States after her deportation from the communist state of Romania. Divorcing Anton, she moved her family to Newton, Massachusetts and began a writing career and made several public appearances to support the family. Much of her writing reflected on her life in Romania and her mother. Princess Ileana entered the religious life in 1959 and founded the Monastery of the Transfiguration, an Orthodox convent located in Pennsylvania, in 1968. She eventually became known as Mother Alexandra. She died in 1991.\n\nScope and Content: The bulk of the Queen Marie of Romania papers date from 1918-1991 and contain correspondence, photograph albums, newspaper clippings, personal belongings and other miscellaneous items of Queen Marie and her daughter, Princess Ileana. This collection documents the Romanian royal family's personal and public activities during much of the 20th century including Queen Marie's involvement during World War I, her trip to the United States and Canada in 1926 and her death in 1938. It also documents Princess Ileana's activities during World War II, her exile from Romania and her church involvement. In addition, the collection contains literary pieces by Romanian authors and poets, literary journals, newspapers and books. The collection was donated in several installments, and at varying times by Queen Marie, Princess Ileana, Stefan Habsburg (the son of Ileana) and Ray Baker Harris. The collection was processed at the item level. Throughout the inventory Ileana is referred to as Princess Ileana rather than Mother Alexandra. Attempts have been made when possible to put in parenthesis the relationship of an individual to Princess Ileana or Queen Marie.\n\nStatement of Arrangement: This collection has been divided into eight series. Series 1 includes correspondence of Queen Marie, documents related to Queen Marie, and materials collected by researchers Hector Bolitho and Ray Baker Harris memorializing and documenting Queen Marie's life.
