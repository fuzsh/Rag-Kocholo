        "text": "Albert confirmed that he was her father a few years later in 2006. Now she travels the world thanks to her film roles and philanthropic work with the United Nations and with The Jazmin Fund, her own charity that helps women in remote villages in Fiji.\n\nGrace Grimaldi enjoys a close relationship with her half-siblings and they were recently all pictured together.\n\n2. Prince Albert of Monaco’s son Alexandre Grimaldi-Coste\n\nHis mother, Nicole Coste, met the royal on a flight to Nice in 1997 when she worked as cabin crew and the pair enjoyed a five-year romance. Like his half-sister Jazmin, Grimaldi-Coste is not an heir to the throne but does have rights to Albert’s billion-dollar fortune. He also has two half-siblings on his mother’s side.\n\n3. King Albert II of Belgium’s daughter Delphine Boël\n\nAnother Albert II had an illegitimate child under different circumstances. The Belgian monarch was married to Paola Ruffo di Calabria, an Italian princess, when he had an affair with Baroness Sybille de Selys Longchamps. Delphine – who now has two teenage children, Princess Josephine and Prince Oscar, with her American husband – was born in 1968.\n\nHer legal battle to be recognised as “legitimate” and claim her title as princess only started in 2013 but eventually, in October 2020, she won after Albert admitted he was her dad. But that was not before the artist made a name for herself on Belgium’s Dancing With the Stars and created controversial artwork with the slogans “Love Child” and “F*** You, I Exist”.\n\n4. Prince Carlos Duke of Parma’s son Prince Carlos Hugo Klynstra\n\nKing Willem-Alexander of the Netherlands’ cousin Prince Carlos, head of the House of Bourbon-Parma, had a son with his childhood friend Brigitte Klynstra but claimed that the pair had agreed the child would not get a title. In 2018, when their son was aged 21, Bridgette and her son won a 19-year battle to claim the title of His Royal Highness Prince Carlos Hugo Roderik Sybren de Bourbon de Parme.\n\n5. Mark Phillips’ daughter Felicity Tonkin\n\nPrincess Anne married Captain Mark Phillips in 1973 and the pair had two children – Peter and Zara. However, in 1991 – while the couple were separated but had vowed to stay married – it was revealed that he had fathered a child with New Zealand teacher Heather Tonkin in 1985.\n\nThe equestrian publicly denied the love child but it soon emerged that he had been sending them US$8,000 annually for five years and a court-ordered DNA test proved the paternity. He ended up paying a US$475,000 settlement, though Felicity – who reportedly thought her father was dead until she was eight years old – still has little contact with her half-siblings, according to the British tabloids. But she still had a royal stepmother until 1992 when Anne and Phillips divorced. Now Tonkin is married and has a child with polo player Tristan Wade."
