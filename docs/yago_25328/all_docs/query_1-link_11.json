        "text": "As posted by EricvdV at the Benelux Royals MB:\n\n[FONT=verdana, arial]Princess Léa of Belgium composed a picture book on her husband Prince Alexander of Belgium, first as a surprise on the 65th birthday of the prince in July, but Princess Léa decided to publish it, because Prince Alexander is too much unknown to the Belgians.\n\nThe result is beautiful; lots of unpublished pictures.\n\nBook so far only in French, but a picture book, entitled: \"Le Prince Alexandre de Belgique\". [/FONT]\n\n​\n\nPrincess Lea asked Flimish singer Helmut Loti to read from her new fairytale book 'The Friends of Valdi and Rush'. The money made from the book of princess Lea and of the CD with Helmut Lotti will go to a cause to support handicapped people.\n\nPrincess Lea comments that writing the tales was easy enough, she liked to tell tales to her children when they were small. She also says that in these world there is still so little to dream about, and she wanted to do something about that.\n\nArticle from Het Laatste Nieuws here.\n\nAnd here a picture of prince Alexandre and princess Lea.\n\nWhen I still lived in Manaus, Amazon, I had the chance to meet ex-King Leopold III and Princess Lilianne. He was a gentleman, extremely kind and approachable, but she was a very proud and disagreable person. As my Father was the representative Consul of Belgium in Manaus, we saw them all the time of their visit. Later, ex-king Leopold III returned to Manaus, but this time in a scientific visit. He struck a friendship with my Father and they wrote to each other for many years. He was a fantastic, bright, intelligent man a real aristocrat, and the second visit was very different, because without Princess Lillianne around, he was much more at ease. I will always keep in my mind and heart, what a wonderful handsome man he was and how nice and simple towards anybody. I remembered him showing us pictures of his three younger children, especially Marie Christine and Esmeralda. His son Alexandre suffered from a serious heart problem when he was young and had to be operated (open heart surgery) in the US , I think.\n\nWhatever happened to the other daughter of King Leopold III, Princess Marie-Christine? The last I heard of her was at least 5 or 6 years ago, she was married to an American for a while I think and living in the U.S., mostly estranged from her own family. Did she attend her father's or mother's funerals? Is she still estranged from her brother and sister?\n\nYou are most welcome, Marengo\n\nHere are some updates on Prince Alexandre's and Princess Lea's\n\nengagements during the last months, including the hair event\n\nyou've mentioned:\n\nNovember 18, 2008:\n\nPrincess Lea of Belgium and Stephane Bern at the presentation of a\n\nbook ( The friends of Valdi and Rush) for children written by the wife\n\nof Prince Alexandre with a cd with the voices of Stephane Bern,\n\nHelmut Lotti and Princess Léa in the three languages on 18 Nov.2008:\n\n** Pic 1 ** Pic 2 ** Pic 3 **\n\nDecember 22, 2008:\n\nPrincess Lea is pictured at Jean D Coiffure on the place de la Chatelein/\n\nChâtelainplein in Brussels, Belgium on 22 December 2008. She had her\n\nhair cut and donated it to women who have lost their own hair due\n\nto treatment for cancer.\n\n** Pic 1 ** Pic 2 ** Pic 3 ** Pic 4 **\n\nJanuary 14, 2009:\n\nPrincess Lea and Prince Alexandre during a visit to the new buildings\n\nof the \"Zeepreventorium\" care center in De Haan, Belgium, 14 Jan.2009.\n\n** Pic 1 ** Pic 2 ** Pic 3 ** Pic 4 **\n\nI am afraid , absolutely not , he is small and a bit fat , nothing to do with his half-brothers which are and were Kings.. What did he do in his life ?\n\nBefore his wedding , he did not tell to his mother , we never saw him , now he is seen because his wife is everywhere...\n\nI am afraid , absolutely not , he is small and a bit fat , nothing to do with his half-brothers which are and were Kings.. What did he do in his life ?\n\nBefore his wedding , he did not tell to his mother , we never saw him , now he is seen because his wife is everywhere...\n\nI'm sorry if I couldn't express my thoughts properly.\n\nI did not refer to Prince Alexandre's over-all habitus, nor his career,\n\nnor his family history, nor his position in the royal house.\n\nMy understanding of him is that he is an intellectual, shy and nice person.\n\nSimply, on that particular photo I saw at first time something similar to his brothers, same facial features. That's all."
