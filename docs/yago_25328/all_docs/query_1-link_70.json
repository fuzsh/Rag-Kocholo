        "text": "King Willem-Alexander of the Netherlands who ascended to the throne after the abdication of his mother, Princess Beatrix, in 2013, is a father of three daughters, including heir-to-the-throne Princess Catharina-Amalia, and Princess Alexia, who studies at UWC Atlantic, in Wales. He is also a loving husband to Queen Máxima, whom he married on 2 February 2002. Here, as King Willem-Alexander celebrates his birthday, Tatler looks back at their royal wedding.\n\nRoyal wedding bells pealed across Amsterdam, as the then Prince Willem-Alexander, heir to the throne, wed his Argentine fiancée of just under a year, Máxima Zorreguieta Cerruti. The couple’s engagement had been announced in 2001 by the prince’s mother, Queen Beatrix of the Netherlands, and the ring featured a unique orange oval-shaped diamond – perhaps a nod to the family’s House of Orange name. It was the Netherlands’ second royal wedding that decade, with Prince Willem-Alexander’s younger brother Prince Constantijn tying the knot the year prior to him.\n\nAll the men Princess Diana was ever romantically linked to\n\nRead More\n\nFor her wedding tiara, she got creative, completely customising her own design. The base was the Pearl Button Tiara, but rather than wearing the pearls, she removed them and replaced them with star brooches from the queen’s collection.\n\nGuests on the day included those from the royal households of Europe, including the then Prince Charles, the Earl and Countess of Wessex, King Albert II and Queen Paola of Belgium, Queen Margrethe II of Denmark, Crown Prince Pavlos and Crown Princess Marie-Chantal of Greece, Princess Caroline and Prince Ernst-August of Hanover, Queen Noor of Jordan and Prince Albert II of Monaco.\n\nRoyals at the Met Ball\n\nRead More\n\nThe bridesmaids, who wore duchesse satin red dresses, included Máxima’s childhood best friend and her younger sister, as well as two of the prince’s cousins.\n\nRead More\n\nFact vs fiction: Five things that Scoop got wrong\n\nThe Netflix film dramatising the royal Newsnight interview premiered on Friday 5 March - but how much of it is really accurate? Here, Tatler reveals all\n\nMuch like with British royal weddings, the couple rode through the streets waving at well-wishers after the ceremony, being driven around in the Golden Carriage, which had been given to Prince Willem-Alexander’s great-grandmother, Queen Wilhelmina, in 1898. From there, they waved to the crowds from the Royal Palace, sharing a kiss.\n\nThey spent their honeymoon in St Moritz, before travelling to Argentina to spend time with the bride’s family, finally finishing up in New Zealand."
