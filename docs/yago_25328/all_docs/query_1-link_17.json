        "text": "It was a major event in the European royal calendar this weekend, as Archduke Alexander of Austria and Countess Natacha Roumiantzoff- Pachkevitch were wed at Eglise Saint Pierre in Belgium.\n\nThe bride, Countess Natacha, claims to descend from Russian nobility, while the Archduke is the son of Archduke Carl-Christian and Archduchess Marie Astrid of Austria. He is the great-grandson of Charles I, the last Habsburg emperor of Austria and King of Hungary. He also hails, through his grandmother Archduchess Yolande of Austria, from one of the oldest noble families in Belgium, the Princess of Ligne. His esteemed grandmother died just a few weeks before the wedding, on 13 September, aged 100.\n\nRead More\n\nInside the Downton-worthy, star-studded wedding of Michelle Dockery and Jasper Waller-Bridge\n\nThe great and the good gathered at Orleans House, a Palladian villa in southwest London, to toast the nuptials of Dockery and Waller-Bridge\n\nThe brothers of the groom, Archduke Christoph of Habsbourg-Lorraine and Archduke Imre of Habsburg-Lorraine smiled proudly on arrival, the latter walking to the church with his wife, Archduchess Kathleen of Habsburg-Lorraine, their daughter in tow and new baby in arms.\n\nThe countess arrived in a periwinkle blue classic car, on the arm of her father. The bride kept things simple, in a diaphanous long-sleeved dress with lace details and a plunging neckline. Her hair was also a laid-back affair, with half-tied up loose waves and a floor length veil attached. Jewellery was kept to a minimum, with pearl drop earrings and a matching necklace and a pearl headpiece. The groom opted for classic chic, with a contrasting morning suit and a red and black striped tie with floral boutonnière.\n\nThe service was held at Eglise Saint Pierre and included touching moments between the bride and groom. It was an especially poignant affair as the church had, just a few days before, played host to the funeral of the family matriarch, Archduchess Yolande.\n\nFollowing the ceremony, the couple were doused in celebratory confetti and whisked away to the reception, held at the Château de Belœil, the seat of the Princes of Ligne. The House of Ligne is one of the oldest Belgian noble families and the castle has been the seat of the Princes of Ligne since 1394. Though vestiges of the original building remained, the castle was reimagined over the years in an increasing ‘chateau’ style and, tragically, had to be completely restored in 1900, after a devastating fire destroyed it almost completely.\n\nRead More\n\nKnebworth’s heir, the Hon. Edward Lytton Cobbold, married Dr. Helena Meyer-Johann, in a fairytale wedding at the Gothic Manor this weekend\n\nEdward Lytton Cobbold, the heir to the most fabled rock manor in British history, was married at home this weekend in a quintessentially British ceremony. All it took was a Geneva-based Historic House conference in 2019 to seal their romantic fate\n\nThe couple were greeted on arrival by the sound of traditional Picardy bagpipes as guests made their way across the moat to the stunning chateau. The wedding party, replete with flower girls in pink-hued traditional dress, amassed on the château’s ornate staircase, before the party continued well into the night.\n\nRead More\n\nRediscover Crown Prince Hussein of Jordan’s spectacular royal wedding\n\nCrown Prince Hussein, son of King Abdullah II and Queen Rania, married Rajwa Al Saif in a beautiful ceremony on 1 June 2023. Here, Tatler opens their wedding album in honour of the occasion\n\nThe château is surrounded by gorgeous baroque gardens which date back to 1664, full of geometrical ponds, landscaped gardens and a folly, which was installed by the seventh Prince of Ligne, in the late eighteenth century. It was here, later that evening, that the newlyweds were spotted taking some romantic snapshots, as the sun dipped beneath the horizon of the historic castle’s vast lake."
