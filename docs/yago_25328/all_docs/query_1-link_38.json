        "text": "Three-part documentary series “Delphine: The Secret Princess” tells how the artist Delphine Boël, the illegitimate daughter of King Albert II of Belgium, fought for legal recognition, and is now known as Princess Delphine of Saxe-Cobourg. It has been sold to multiple territories, Warner Bros. announced at MipTV in Cannes Tuesday.\n\nHBO Max has picked up the show in numerous territories in Europe. It will be broadcast on its service from May 1 in Central and Eastern Europe, in Spain, Portugal and Andorra, the Nordics, and the Netherlands. It has also been acquired by Sbs in Australia, where it will air from April 23. The series aired in Belgium in January on Vrt and Rtl Tvi. The series, from Warner Bros. International TV Production, was directed by Belgian documentary filmmaker Chris Michel.\n\nVariety sat down with Princess Delphine and her husband Jim O’Hare in Cannes to discuss the documentary.\n\nDelphine’s father was...\n\nBelgium's King Philippe and Queen Mathilde appear with their four children in new official portraits to mark five years since he ascended the throne. Philippe, 58, came in power in July 2013 to become the country's seventh monarch after his father King Albert II abdicated at age 79. While the monarchy is largely ceremonial in Belgium, a ruling monarch bears the power to sign legislation and appoint mediators to help form government coalitions after national elections. The royals will celebrate the five-year anniversary of the king's ascension on Belgian National Day on Saturday. In photos released on Thursday, Philippe and Mathilde pose with...\n\nBelgium's line of succession is getting a little bump. The country's Prince Amedeo and wife Elisabetta Maria Von Wolkenstein Rosboch will have their first child this year, the royal palace confirms exclusively to People. The couple have been married since July 2014. Amedeo, the eldest son of Princess Astrid and first grandchild of former King Albert II and Queen Paola, is sixth in line for the country's throne. The child - which Belgian media believes is due in May - will be Princess Astrid and Prince Lorenz's first grandchild. The couple's child will become seventh rank of succession - but will...\n\nWhen the Princess met the Pope! Princess Charlene and her husband, Prince Albert II, stepped out in Vatican City on Monday morning for an official visit with Pope Francis. It's the fourth visit to the small country for the wife of Monaco's monarch: She previously met Pope Benedict in 2013. Wearing all-white - she's only one of seven people worldwide who are allowed to wear the color to meet His Holiness - Charlene stunned in a collarless white coat and a cream dress paired with a white lace head covering. The exclusive tradition of wearing white to meet the pope is...\n\nKing Philippe I became Belgium's seventh monarch during a national holiday on Sunday after his father Albert abdicated as the head of the fractured nation. After he took the oath at the parliament filled with representatives of the 6 million Dutch-speaking Flemings and 4.5 million Francophones, Philippe insisted \"the wealth of our nation and our institutions consists in turning our diversity into a strength.\" The ceremony capped a day of transition which started when Philippe's father, the 79-year-old Albert, signed away his rights as the kingdom's largely ceremonial ruler at the royal palace in the presence of Prime Minister Elio Di Rupo,...\n\nWe have confirmed that Prince Alexandre, the half-brother of Albert II, King of the Belgians, passed away at age 67 on Sunday. He had a pulmonary embolism. The King and his late half-brother became close during and immediately following World War II, when their father, the then-king Leopold III of Belgium, was in exile. A palace official told us that King Albert II was \"very affected by the news\" of his half-brother's death. Prince Alexandre's funeral will be held on December 4 at Our Lady of Laeken, a Roman Catholic church in Laeken, Brussels, which sits atop the crypt where all members of the royal family are interred. Prince Alexandre will not be buried in the royal crypt, but rather in an adjacent chapel. Many Belgium royals will be in attendance, including King Albert II and his wife, Queen Paola.\n\nThe funeral for Belgium's Prince Alexander will take place on Friday (04.12.09). The Royal Palace in Brussels confirmed that most members of the royal family, including King Albert II - Alexander's half brother - Queen Paola, Queen Fabiola, Prince Philip and his wife Mathilde Princess Astrid and Prince Lorenz, Prince Laurent and Princess Claire will attend the service. It is unclear whether Princess Astrid and Prince Lorenz will attend as they are currently in Columbia, with the princess scheduled to give a speech on Thursday (02.12.09). Alexander - who died suddenly on Saturday (28.11.09) aged 67 - will be interred in a chapel next to the Royal Crypt in the Church of Our Lady, which is close to the royal...\n\nBelgian's Prince Alexander is believed to have died. The royal - who was the half-brother of King Albert II - reportedly passed away suddenly yesterday (29.11.09) aged 67, after suffering from an acute pulmonary embolism, a blocked artery in his lung. According to Belgian news website flandersnews.be, his death is being mourned by members of the Belgian royal family. Alexander was the only son of King Leopold III and his second wife Lilian Baels, and had two younger sisters, Marie Christine and Marie Esmeralda. He also had two half-brothers, current monarch Albert and the late King Boudewijn. His father was never forgiven for marrying Lilian following the death of his first wife, Queen Astrid - who was hugely popular with...\n\nBelgium's King Albert II and Queen Paolo have attended a ceremony to see new saints canonised. The royal couple attended the Vatican service at St. Peter's Basilica to represent Belgian-born Jozef Fe Veuster - more commonly known as Father Damien - who died of leprosy in 1889 after contracting the disease from patients he was working with on Hawaii's Molokai island. Pope Benedict XVI said Father Damien and the other four new saints had \"heeded Jesus' call to the heroism of sanctity, sacrificing themselves for others without calculation or personal gain.\" He added: \"Their perfection, in the logic of a faith that is humanly incomprehensible at times, consists in no longer placing themselves at the centre, but choosing to go..."
