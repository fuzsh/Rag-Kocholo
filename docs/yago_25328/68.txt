[FONT=verdana, arial]Princess Léa of Belgium composed a picture book on her husband Prince Alexander of Belgium, first as a surprise on the 65th birthday of the prince in July, but Princess Léa decided to publish it, because Prince Alexander is too much unknown to the Belgians.

The result is beautiful; lots of unpublished pictures.

Book so far only in French, but a picture book, entitled: "Le Prince Alexandre de Belgique". [/FONT]

​

Princess Lea asked Flimish singer Helmut Loti to read from her new fairytale book 'The Friends of Valdi and Rush'. The money made from the book of princess Lea and of the CD with Helmut Lotti will go to a cause to support handicapped people.

Princess Lea comments that writing the tales was easy enough, she liked to tell tales to her children when they were small. She also says that in these world there is still so little to dream about, and she wanted to do something about that.

And here a picture of prince Alexandre and princess Lea.

When I still lived in Manaus, Amazon, I had the chance to meet ex-King Leopold III and Princess Lilianne. He was a gentleman, extremely kind and approachable, but she was a very proud and disagreable person. As my Father was the representative Consul of Belgium in Manaus, we saw them all the time of their visit. Later, ex-king Leopold III returned to Manaus, but this time in a scientific visit. He struck a friendship with my Father and they wrote to each other for many years. He was a fantastic, bright, intelligent man a real aristocrat, and the second visit was very different, because without Princess Lillianne around, he was much more at ease. I will always keep in my mind and heart, what a wonderful handsome man he was and how nice and simple towards anybody. I remembered him showing us pictures of his three younger children, especially Marie Christine and Esmeralda. His son Alexandre suffered from a serious heart problem when he was young and had to be operated (open heart surgery) in the US , I think.

Whatever happened to the other daughter of King Leopold III, Princess Marie-Christine? The last I heard of her was at least 5 or 6 years ago, she was married to an American for a while I think and living in the U.S., mostly estranged from her own family. Did she attend her father's or mother's funerals? Is she still estranged from her brother and sister?

I am afraid , absolutely not , he is small and a bit fat , nothing to do with his half-brothers which are and were Kings.. What did he do in his life ?

Before his wedding , he did not tell to his mother , we never saw him , now he is seen because his wife is everywhere...

I'm sorry if I couldn't express my thoughts properly.

I did not refer to Prince Alexandre's over-all habitus, nor his career,

nor his family history, nor his position in the royal house.

My understanding of him is that he is an intellectual, shy and nice person.

Simply, on that particular photo I saw at first time something similar to his brothers, same facial features. That's all.
