Did I hear you right ?\n\nStick to the game plan man, it's gon' be aight\n\nThis can't be our last song now\n\nNow I know you're confused\n\nToo Phat breaking up be blowing up in the news\n\nAin't prepared to leave this rap game only roll with the best\n\nOnly gon' stop rapping when they lay me to rest\n\nAnd no less I'm a handle this test you talking crazy son\n\nAin't no problem we can't solve and this 'ish ain't no reason\n\nFor you to be gone gots to look beyond and ahead\n\nWe've come a long way and spread this hip hop ish\n\nNot from a negative aspect but in a positive way\n\nKids in small towns freestyling when they parlay\n\nAnd the thousands of fans that rock when we blaze stages\n\nLine up for hours to get autographs later\n\nAnd think of how we took the industry by storm\n\nAnd got all kinds of people buying our album\n\nYou ain't gon' quit now you gotta think this through\n\nI got ya back for real son now stop acting a fool\n\nImma hit you back later ain't gonna take that long\n\nPeep the new chorus that I did for the song\n\nThis can't be our last song trust me son you got all wrong\n\nBefore you know it ya problems will be all gone\n\nKeep it together don't mess up your mind\n\nI know this stress ain't but a bless in disguise\n\nThis can't be our last song trust me son you got all wrong\n\nBefore you know it ya problems will be all gone\n\nKeep it together don't mess up your mind\n\nI know this stress ain't but a bless in disguise\n\nBeen doing a lotta thinking need to get this off my chest\n\nToo Phat breaking up might be for the best\n\nGetting sick of cameras under tight scrutiny\n\nDashing out of arena surrounded by security\n\nAnd groupies roaming lobbies just ain't fun no more\n\nThey stalking as hobbies and I ain't gon' run no more\n\nPlus one more think that I need is a new challenge\n\nA long vacation b'fore I pursue my education\n\nMade a promise to my moms and go study abroad\n\nMaybe some day we'll hit 'em back with an encore\n\nYou go show them yanks how us cats rock them crowds\n\nThen you best blow up and make your potna proud\n\nTakeover Bad Boy go buyont P.Diddy\n\nAnd maybe Illion will become reality\n\nI know you worried about you boo yo I'm sure she'd fine\n\nYou go handle your's and Imma handle mine\n\nI guess it's bout time we lead different paths\n\nListen to the chorus it's gonna be our last\n\nThis could be our last song I know I wanted this to last long\n\nBut somehow yo we both gosta move on\n\nHell yeah we had fun while it lasted\n\nBut now Too Phat's a thing of the past."
