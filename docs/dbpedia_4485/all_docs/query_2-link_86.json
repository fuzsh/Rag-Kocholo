        "text": "Share the love!\n\nA Rough Guide to Australian Slang\n\nAustralian English (or Aussie slang, really) is a language of subtle poetry. A beautiful tongue made up of colourful metaphors and delicately constructed witticisms, but it is also a language of simplicity. It is the language of a people who call things what they are while simultaneously looking to limit the amount of time it takes to get a point across. It’s a contrasting tongue – a mix of the obvious (calling soda ‘fizzy drink’) and the almost indecipherable (‘putting it on the Never Never’ means paying on a credit card).\n\nAustralian English is a language that takes a little getting used to, but I’m hoping this far from complete guide to Australian slang will put you in good stead for those awkward few days where it’s all ‘G’day’ and ‘Strewth’ and you’ve got no idea what’s going on. But damned if it doesn’t sound sexy in that Aussie drawl.\n\nAfter my recent trek to the US showed me just how confusing our language can be, I’ve gone ahead and put through a (far from complete) dictionary of Australian slang for your reading pleasure. Please do let me know if I’ve missed any and I’ll be sure to update.\n\nFood & Drink\n\nAustralian food and Australian slang have quite a bit in common. We’re a people of relatively simple tastes, and you’ll notice that virtually everything gets shortened down. I’m certain I’ve missed more than a few here – particularly when it comes to regional variations. Help a brother out!\n\nAvo: Short for avocado.\n\nBarbie: Short for barbeque.\n\nBeetroot: Beet. Popular on hamburgers.\n\nBilly: Tea pot. Sometimes also refers to a bong.\n\nBiscuit/Bickie: Cookie.\n\nBooze: Alcohol.\n\nBottle Shop/Bottle-O: A liquor store.\n\nBrekkie: Short for breakfast.\n\nBush Tucker: Food made from Australian native plants and animals.\n\nCapsicum: Bell pepper.\n\nCarton/slab: A pack of 24 beers (cans or bottles).\n\nChewie: Chewing gum. Bubble gum.\n\nChips: Used for both potato chips and fries (sometimes called hot chips).\n\nChook: Chicken.\n\nCuppa: A cup of tea.\n\nDamper: Bread baked in campfire coals.\n\nDevon/Luncheon: Bologna.\n\nDog’s eye with dead horse: Rhyming slang for meat pie with sauce.\n\nEsky: Cooler or ice box.\n\nFairy floss: Cotton candy.\n\nFizzy Drink: Soda. Pop. Sometimes called Soft Drink.\n\nFrankfurt/Saveloy/Cheerio: Weiner.\n\nGoon: Cheap wine, usually purchased in a 4L box or cask.\n\nGrog: Alcohol of any kind. See also grog bog.\n\nHamburger: It should be noted that all cases of something served between buns are called hamburgers in Australia. There are no chicken or fish sandwiches. Only chicken and fish burgers.\n\nIceblock/Icy Pole: Non dairy popsicle.\n\nIcecream: Specific to the variety served in a cone.\n\nJug: Electric kettle.\n\nLamington: A square of sponge cake covered in chocolate icing (frosting) and coconut.\n\nLolly: Candy.\n\nLong neck/tall boy: A 750ml beer bottle.\n\nMaccas: McDonalds.\n\nMiddy (NSW & WA)/Handle (NT)/Schooner (SA)/Pot (All other states): A beer glass measuring 285mls (10 oz).\n\nMorning Tea: Similar to recess or brunch. A light meal between breakfast and lunch.\n\nOn the piss: Drinking alcohol.\n\nPavlova/Pav: A dessert made of meringue, fresh fruit, and cream.\n\nPaw Paw: Papaya.\n\nPint (All states bar SA)/Imperial Pint (SA): A beer glass measuring 570mls (20 oz).\n\nPiss: Alcohol. Ex: Nah mate, I was on the piss all weekend.\n\nPluto Pup/Dagwood Dog: Akin to a corn dog, but made using flour instead of corn meal.\n\nPrawn: Large shrimp. Not eaten fresh from the barbie.\n\nRoast: Sometimes called a baked dinner. A roast meat with vegetables.\n\nRock Melon: Cantaloupe.\n\nRoo: Kangaroo meat.\n\nSanger: Short for sandwich.\n\nSchooner (All states bar SA)/Pint (SA): A beer glass measuring 425mls (15 oz).\n\nSilverside: Corned beef.\n\nSkull: To ‘chug’ a beer.

Each state generally has its own terms for various glass sizes and, to confuse matters more, these names sometimes mean completely different things in different states.\n\nA ‘schooner’ is 15oz/425mls in all states except South Australia, where it is a 10oz/285ml drink. Meanwhile, a ‘pint’ in South Australia is 150oz/425mls, but measures 20oz/570ml in every other state.\n\nConfused? We all are.\n\nFriendships & Dating\n\nYou may notice that Australians are a sometimes coarse people, and that is true of Australian slang and of dating in Australia. We’re not afraid to call a spade a spade and a prawn a prawn, nor do we shy away from discussing our sexual exploits with our mates.\n\nI’m always surprised when I notice just how commonly used the ‘C word’ is in Australian day to day language. Hell, we drop the F-Bomb like it’s just another word.\n\nB&S: Bachelors and Spinsters ball. A dance where singles meet.\n\nBastard: Often used as a term of endearment between friends.\n\nClacker: Anus.

It’s also, sadly, a language littered with racial slurs – a few of which I’ve included today. And like all Australian slang, it bounces from the imaginative to the painfully unoriginal.\n\nBanana Bender: A resident of Queensland.\n\nBattler: An ‘Aussie battler’ is somebody who works hard against the odds.\n\nBludger: A lazy person.
