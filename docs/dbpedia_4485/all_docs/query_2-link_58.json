Please read our disclosure policy.\n\nCarbonara is one of the four classic Roman pastas dish; the other three being Cacio e Pepe, Amatriciana, and Pasta alla Gricia. My authentic recipe results in a silky, creamy, and decadent dish that uses zero cream — just a couple fool-proof tips and techniques will have you enjoying the creamiest, most delicious Carbonara that only takes 15 minutes to make!\n\nWatch the Carbonara Recipe Video Below!\n\nIngredients for Carbonara\n\nAuthentic, traditional Carbonara calls for only a few ingredients – let’s break it down!\n\n8 oz spaghetti – You can use any long pasta but spaghetti is the most commonly used type. You can use either fresh or dried pasta; I like bronze die-cut pasta because the surface of the pasta has a rougher texture to allow for more sauce to cling to it.\n\nPecorino Romano and Parmigiano Reggiano – I like to use a combination of Pecorino Romano and Parmigiano Reggiano.\n\nWhile these two cheeses ARE similar, I strongly recommend you use BOTH (and not sub one for the other), as it adds a layer of complexity to the flavors. Pecorino is made from sheep’s milk and is saltier than Parmesan, so if you end up subbing one for the other, make sure to adjust the salt accordingly.\n\nThe most crucial part is that you must grate your own cheese – whatever you do, do not use the store bought pre-grated cheese. Pre-grated cheese contain preservatives to keep the cheese shreds from clumping and I find they don’t melt together as well. You can also taste the grainy texture from the additives. I like to keep a couple wedges of high quality cheese at home and my favorite place to buy them from is Costco! The quality and price is unbeatable.\n\n2.5 oz Pecorino Romano, finely grated\n\n1.5 oz Parmigiano Reggiano, finely grated\n\n1 whole egg + 3 egg yolks\n\nThe eggs vigorously mixed with the guanciale fat and pasta water is what creates the magical sauce! Notice there is NO cream in this Carbonara – you won’t need it! I like to use a ratio of 1 whole egg to 3 egg yolks because it balances the richness.\n\nIf you are looking to avoid using raw eggs, I would recommend making my Cacio e Pepe recipe – this is another one of the four classic Roman pastas but requires only three ingredients (cheese, pepper, and pasta).\n\nYou can also try my authentic Fettucine Alfredo recipe – this is another creamy cheese-based pasta that uses zero eggs!\n\n6 oz guanciale – Guanciale is a KEY ingredient in carbonara! It is a cured fatty pork jowl that is similar to bacon or pancetta. I love the flavor it adds to the dish.\n\nMany people ask me where I find guanciale. I look for it at Italian delis (such as Bay Cities in Santa Monica or Eataly in Century City, if you are based in Los Angeles).\n\nIf you cannot find guanciale, you can substitute with bacon or pancetta. The main difference between guanciale and pancetta or bacon is that guanciale has a richer fat content that is needed for the authentic recipe.\n\n1-2 tbsp guanciale fat after cooking – Make sure to save the guanciale fat, as you will use this with the eggs and pasta water to make your creamy, luxurious Carbonara sauce!\n\n1/2 tbsp whole black peppercorn – I highly recommend using whole black peppercorns that you can ground fresh. I find that pre-ground black pepper lacks the flavors of freshly ground. You can add more if desired.\n\nSalt (for the pasta water) – Don’t forget to add salt to your pasta water! Because of the salt content in the cheese and guanciale, I recommend 1 tablespoon of kosher salt per quart of water.\n\nCarbonara: Recipe Instructions\n\n1. Preparing the Guanciale\n\nThe first step in this recipe is to prepare the guanciale, which is an Italian cured pork jowl. You can find this at any specialty Italian market or butcher, but if you can’t find it, you can easily sub for pancetta or bacon.\n\nWhen buying guanciale, be sure to remove the hard, tough outer layer prior to cutting the meat into even thin strips. This outer layer of the guanciale is inedible. You want to cut the guanciale as even as possible so they cook in the pan and crisp up evenly.\n\nPlace the guanciale in a cold pan and turn the heat to medium high. Continue stirring until the fat has rendered and the guanciale are crisp, about 4-5 minutes. Remove from the pan to a paper towel to drain and set aside, keeping the fat in the pan.\n\n2. Preparing the eggs, cheese, and pepper\n\nWhen grating the cheese, be sure to use the finest side of the cheese grater. Trust me, this definitely makes a difference! You want the cheese to be almost snow-like, which will allow the cheese to more easily emulsify into the sauce.\n\nI use about a 2:1 ratio of Pecorino Romano cheese to Parmesan cheese for this recipe, which in my opinion provides the most balance of saltiness to the final sauce.\n\nIf using freshly ground peppercorns, I will toast the peppercorns in a dry pan for about 1-2 minutes over medium heat or until fragrant before grinding them in a mortar and pestle. This extra step is NOT necessary but I find it adds a beautiful aroma and complexity to the dish.\n\nAdd the freshly ground pepper to a large mixing bowl with the below ingredients and mix well.\n\n1 large egg and 3 egg yolks\n\ngrated parmesan and pecorino cheese\n\nthe crispy guanciale\n\n2 tbsp of the guanciale fat that was rendered out from the guanciale\n\n3. Add the pasta and form the Carbonara\n\nIn a pot of boiling salted water, add your pasta and follow the package instructions to achieve your desired doneness. I prefer my spaghetti “al dente” which has a satisfying bite and chew.\n\nAdd your al dente pasta directly into the sauce and stir vigorously to emulsify the sauce. The warm pasta will generate enough heat to create a rich sauce that will cling to the pasta. The sauce will continue to further thicken upon sitting.\n\nIf the sauce is too thick, add pasta water 1 tbsp at a time until the correct sauce consistency is achieved.\n\nWatch the recipe video for reference!\n\nKEY TIP\n\nRunny Sauce?\n\nIf you have a runny sauce that is too loose at this point, place the metal bowl with the pasta and sauce over the pot of pasta water and bring the water to a low boil. Use the steam from the pasta water to gently thicken the egg and cheese sauce until you’ve achieved the creamy consistency show in the video.\n\n4. Plate your carbonara and enjoy!\n\nCarbonara is best eaten freshly made – so if cooking for someone else, don’t make it ahead of time. As the dish sits, the sauce will continue to thicken and congeal with the pasta (while still delicious in flavor, it won’t be nearly as good as enjoyed fresh).\n\nPlating Tip\n\nServe the Pasta in Warm Bowls\n\nCheese and dairy based pastas have a tendency to clump up and congeal once they’ve sat out for a few minutes. Prevent this from happening by serving the pasta in a warm bowl! I fill a bowl with hot water then dump it out and dry it before plating the pasta. It will keep the pasta and sauce hot and creamy while enjoying it!\n\nPro TipS\n\nExpert Tips for Making the BEST Carbonara At Home!\n\nSalt Your Pasta Water – this is a KEY tip for all pasta dishes but you must salt your pasta water! This first step will help ensure your dish is properly seasoned. The Italians believed in adding flavor at every step of the cooking process; salting your pasta water is seen as your ‘foundation’. Because this pasta has natural salt coming from the cheese and guanciale, I recommend only using 1 tablespoon of salt per quart of water.\n\nCook Your Guanciale in a COLD Pan – I like to start the guanciale in a cold pan to render out the fat. If you cook it in a hot pan, it’ll result in the guanciale being seared. This rendered fat is a key component to how delicious this dish is, as you’ll be reserving some of this fat for your sauce.\n\nCan’t Find Guanciale? Substitute with BACON or PANCETTA! Make sure it has enough fat, as you’ll need to render out the fat to thicken the sauce.\n\nPre-Warm your bowls with hot water (so it retains the heat when serving your delicious Carbonara). Carbonara is a dish best enjoyed freshly made, so try to avoid making it ahead for guests. The sauce will continue to thicken and congeal as it sits with the pasta.\n\nLeftovers can keep in an airtight container in your refrigerator for up to 3 days.\n\nI usually enjoy Carbonara as my main dish; but if you are planning a more decadent meal, it can be served alongside another main dish, such as my Braised Beef Short Ribs recipe. This is the PERFECT date night formula!\n\nI absolutely love pasta, so if you are looking to try other pasta dishes, check out my Cacio e Pepe recipe – this is another one of the four classic Roman pastas and one that is even easier than Carbonara!\n\nA crowd favorite is my Spicy Vodka Pasta – this is my go-to recipe for dinner parties and is always a hit! Lastly, a super easy weeknight dinner option is Cherry Tomato Pasta!\n\nIf you tried this Carbonara or any other recipe on my website, please leave a 🌟 star rating and let me know how it went in the comments below!\n\n4.98 from 79 votes\n\nAuthentic 15-Minute Carbonara\n\nBy: Chris Joe\n\nServings: 2\n\nPrep: 5 minutes mins\n\nCook: 10 minutes mins\n\nThis authentic Roman carbonara recipe is easy and delicious!
