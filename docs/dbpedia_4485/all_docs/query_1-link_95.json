        "text": "The first time the name Butterfingers was brought to my attention was back in 1996. My classmate introduces me to the wonderful world of the Malaysian underground scene. Up to that point, I only knew a handful of local act singing in English. Mainly OAG, Saturnine and Lost Souls.\n\nIt was through him that I learned about other bands such the Bollocks, Basic Rights, Spiral Kinetic Circus, Pilgrims and of course Butterfingers. Just to know that there is a scene where punk, grunge, indie pop, metal and a whole other non-mainstream genre bands can perform is an overwhelming thought for me.\n\nDuring that same year Galaxy, the famous local entertainment magazine did a review on one of the gigs that took place in Kuala Lumpur. I remember in the writer’s own words that listening to Butterfingers reminded him of songs from Nirvana’s Bleach album. Very raw and unpolished grunge. I felt goosebumps when reading that.\n\nAt the end of 1996, I begin to venture even deeper into the underground scenes. My main sources back then was a column from Joe Kidd (yes the very same guy from Carburator Dung) in the Sun newspaper every Wednesday. In his column, Joe will review the latest albums from the local scenes and also fanzines.\n\nI still recall the review he did on Butter’s debut album 1.2 Milligram. Overall it was very positive which prompted to go out and get the album. But fate has its own course.\n\nOn the way back home from a cancelled tuition class, I was walking back home with a guy who attends the same class with me. Despite knowing each other for almost a year we barely spoke a word. Often we bump each other on the same bus on the way back home. I would get that suspicious stare from him and vice versa.\n\nBut that day, everything changed. The first question from his mouth was what kind of music are you into, the rest is history. To my surprise, he actually bought Butter’s debut album. Asked him what prompted to buy, apparently, he was recommended by the shop owner.\n\nHe had no clue who the hell is Butterfingers! Much to his horror was finding out there is an address which states somewhere in Kampung Pandan in the album sleeves. But as soon as he heard the first track from the album, he was blown away by it.\n\nI loved the album too. Felt that the pure, crude and vehement fuzzy guitar they brought here had plenty reminiscent of a pre-Nirvana Seattle sound. And the released of this album couldn’t have come at a better time.\n\nThe likes of Pilgrims DC, the Beads, Boys & Girls 1+1=3 compilation, a hardcore compilation from Tang Records and many others were being released at the same time.\n\nSlowly, the mainstream was beginning to take notice that there is potential in the undercurrent of Malaysian music. There were this strong youthfulness and energy that is never been felt before. A generation of kids who were fed up with rock bands depending on M.Nasir songwriting.\n\nI remember when the band appeared on the legendary Alternative Rock Show on THR (back then it was known as Time Highway Radio before it got reformat into TH Ragga) hosted by the rock guru himself, Kamil Othman. The band members seem to be a bit shy and bashful during the entire show. Well, can’t blame them as they weren’t the rock stars they would eventually become.\n\nA year later, the band released their second album Butter Worth Pushful. My word, this time there is a giant leap of improvement in terms of production, songwriter and music arrangement. The band had everything. The looks, the catchy sound from songs like Girl Friday and a cool music video to go along with it.\n\nKamil Othman invited the band again for another interview, this band members have fully embraced their rock star stature. They were very mature, confident and cool-headedness in their replies. You could tell if they have learned a lot of lesson from the music business in a space of a year. From then on, I knew this band was poised for big things.\n\nSome of you may still remember the Pepsi Generation Next commercial which came about sometime in 1997 or 1998. The soundtrack to the advert was actually from KRU. But you would have noticed a band playing to an audience from which lead singer Emmett (if I’m not mistaken) will do a stage dive, Ala Kurt Cobain in the video for Love Buzz with his guitar.\n\nFrom the on the band continue to release more highly acclaimed albums. I’m not going to dwell into this so much as Taman Bunyi has perfectly documented this on their Twitter account. But with each record, you could tell how much the band is evolving in every aspect. The band looks to be shredding of its teen angst grunge style which brought them to the forefront in the first place. To me, it’s part of an artist musical journey as time goes by.\n\nThroughout my lifetime I have attended three different Butterfingers gig. I’m sure that’s a modest number compared to the rest who will be reading this article. And all three gigs I was with the same guy who I became best friend with after our conversation from a tuition class.\n\nThe first was a one-day festival held in Sunway Lagoon 1999. Inspired by Perry Ferrell (Jane’s Addiction front-man) creation Lollapalooza, the festival was named, oh well ….. Lagoonpalooza. Among the bands featured that day were Lyme, Metalasia, Koffin Kanser, Cyberwerk and OAG.\n\nBy the time Butter took the stage, it was almost late in the evening. But the wait was worth it, the performance was solid as expected. It all went smoothly until a small fracas between a skinhead and grunge kid broke out that go on everyone’s nerve. Music is all about unity and has no place in fights.\n\nA year later, we saw them again. This time at the open car park in One Utama Shopping Centre. If your guess is as good as mine, then you’re right. We are talking about the first edition of Rock the World show. By now, I’ve kind of loosen up the grunge look in favour of a nu-metal style. Yes, I used to wear the baggy t-shirt, three-quarter pants together with the classic Adidas superstar show.\n\nTo be honest, we were there for Lyme. But like most underground people, we will also support any other act on the day. In my view, most of the crowd were there for the Positive Tone (John’s Mistress, Juliet the Orange) or Synchronized Studio (28 Days, Amigone) acts. It’s fair to say the bill was meant to be a launching pad to promote the career of a certain Irish-Sarawakian born named Jason Lo.\n\nThe dude who has been making headlines with his Evening News did fairly well to please the crowd. After all, if you’re song gets plenty of airwaves on Hitz FM, you’re bound to be famous. However, the night didn’t belong to Jason Lo. That’s a true fact.\n\nWhen Butterfingers took the stage as the final act, it was as if a tsunami has just washed away every other act on the bill. They didn’t disappoint at all. Fair to say, they also win over new fans who perhaps had no clue about them before but were there because of the hype created by Hitz FM.\n\nWe were supposed to watch them at the mega Bukit Jalil Y2K festival. If memory doesn’t fail me, the show had to be cut short before Butterfinger could take the stage. The reason is the show had been delayed and the organizer didn’t have the required permit to continue beyond the deadline at 12 am.\n\nAs such, I had to wait for another to catch my final show of them. Somewhere in August 2001, the now-defunct Tone magazine organized their own one-day festival at KL Life Centre. The festival was called Tonedef, it featured many of the best local acts at the time comprising from various genre.\n\nIt was my first time watching hip hop acts such as Teh Tarik Crew and Too Phat live. The crowd wasn’t too pleased about the latter, boos and bottles were raining from all over.\n\nBut as soon as the Butterfingers took the stage, you knew they could do no wrong. The belted out some of their classic numbers. The crowd whether it was someone wearing the classic FUBU jersey or a vintage Converse t-shirt, were all mingling around in the mosh pit.\n\nThat show turned out to be my last outing at an underground gig/show. Commitment on both personal and work took a big part of my life in the 17 years or so. But writing this article has given me a newfound interest in the underground scene. The feeling of rekindling with an old flame seems to be tempting as I was finishing this piece.\n\nI have to make a confession, that I have no clue of what the scene is like these days. But not to put off the younger generation, it is impossible that there will be another Butterfingers. In my books, what is Led Zeppelin to rock music, this band on the same page in Malaysian music.\n\nAnyway, if anyone, who is willing to share with me an invitation to the latest gigs in town, I would very much appreciate that. Sure, I will invite that friend of mine to join as well. Hope you guys enjoy my write up."
