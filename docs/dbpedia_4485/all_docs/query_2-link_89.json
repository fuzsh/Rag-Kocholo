        "text": "Based on an unofficial tally, there are roughly 582 rappers out there today whose name begins with “Lil’.” It’s true. You can look it up. I know this, because I just did. My friend Elyse said, “Hey Ryan, check out Lil’ Pump.” So I did, then fell down a Lil’ rabbit hole on Lil’ Spotify and ended up on Lil’ Internet, wondering how many rappers there are with names that start with “Lil.”\n\n582.\n\nIn my research I learned that some rap historians, or rapstorians, believe the first rapper to go with Lil’ (Insert Name Here) as their rap name was Lil Troy. DJ Booth points out that “the Houston rapper famous for the single “Wanna Be Baller,” seems to be the first nationally recognized rapper to don the tag way back in 1988.” I don’t know that song and the only Troy I know is in New York. I know the movie Troy. It wasn’t that good.\n\nLook…\n\nLil Uzi Vert\n\nLil Wayne\n\nLil Pump\n\nLil Yachty\n\nLil Xan\n\nLil Dicky\n\nLil Jon\n\nLil Durk\n\nLil Peep\n\nLil Kim\n\nLil Baby\n\nLil Bibby\n\nLil Reese\n\nLil Wyte\n\nLil Scrappy\n\nLil Mo\n\nLil Rob\n\nLil Pete\n\nLil Tracy\n\nLil Debbie\n\nLil Geniuz\n\nLil Snupe\n\nLil Phat\n\nLil Yee\n\nLil Blood\n\nLil Lonnie\n\nLil Cray\n\nLil Wop\n\nLil Boom\n\nLil Windex\n\nLil Deuce Deuce\n\nLil B Tha Grinda\n\nLil Ugly Mane\n\nLil B (x53)\n\nLil Dude\n\nOkay, that’s enough.\n\nWhat’s the point of this? There is no point. I just thought it was interesting.\n\nHold on, there’s some more.\n\nLil Trill\n\nLil Goofy\n\nLil GiGi\n\nLil Dred\n\nLil Suzy\n\nLil Toenail\n\nLil AJ\n\nLil Twist (did I get him already…checks…nope, just seems that way)\n\nLil Happy Lil Sad\n\nLil Bo Weep\n\nLil’ Flip\n\nLil Yung Pharaoh\n\nLil C\n\nLil Stitch\n\nLil Wicked\n\nLil Skeet\n\nA couple more…\n\nLil Ronny Motha F\n\nLil Rick\n\nLil Mouse\n\nLil Rue\n\nLil Cobaine\n\nLil Raider\n\nLil Supa\n\nGood Lord, there are still so many. We’ll just stop there.\n\nIf Lil Troy was the first rapper to go by Lil something back in 1988, then at what point does it become played out to have Lil in your name? Isn’t the point of a band name, or rapper name in this case, to stand out? If you just type in “Lil” into Spotify’s search box, all these names, all 538 582 names, show up. Lil Windex? That names going to stick out because that’s a dumb effin’ name.\n\nAlso, look at this dude.\n\nI thought Lil Durk was Lil Dunkirk at least five times before convincing myself it wasn’t. Although let’s be honest, there very easily could be a Lil Dunkirk out there and their debut album is probably called Stranded or Raining Bombs, something super tacky.\n\nLil GiGi? Dude, my daughter calls my mom GiGi and she’s about as un-street as you can get. And you know what else? She’s not even the only GiGi I know. I know one other one. I also then kind of know that GiGi is a name you can go by if you’re a grandmother. Is Lil GiGi a grandmother? Who knows? But in 2013 a thirteen year old named Lil Poopy scored a record deal with Sony.\n\nLil Poopy. An hour ago that would have been surprising. Not anymore. You know, kind of like Lil Poopy’s career.\n\nMy Top 5 Lil Names:\n\nLil Twist\n\nLil Boom\n\nLil Yachty\n\nLil Deuce Deuce\n\nThere isn’t a fifth one.\n\nWhat’s up with Lil Happy Lil Sad? At the very least, shouldn’t he have…wait, is it a he…maybe, I think he’s Swedish. But shouldn’t he have some grammar in his name?\n\nLil Happy, Lil Sad\n\nLil Happy? Lil Sad?\n\nLil Happy! Lil Sad.\n\nLil Happy…Lil Sad\n\nLil Happy/Lil Sad\n\nI feel like I’m missing something with just Lil Happy Lil Sad. I’m Lil Confused. I’m Lil Bummed. Wait, I’m Lil Confused Lil Bummed.\n\nLil Goofy…Lil Skeet…and then there’s Lil Dude and I feel like that Lil Dude isn’t even trying. Lil Debbie is a female getting into the Lil act, not quite a trailblazer though because without doing any fact-checking here, Lil Kim was the first female rapper to go with Lil in her name.\n\nLil will never die out when it comes to nicknames and where there’s a neighborhood and a little kid…a Lil Dude if you will…there will be a Lil (Insert Name Here.) But in the rap game, hey rappers, don’t you think it’s time to maybe give the Lil moniker a break? There are so many of you, so, so, so many of you. You’re blending in when you should be blending out. What if you all just dropped the Lil from your name?\n\nUzi Vert\n\nWayne\n\nPump\n\nYachty\n\nXan\n\nDicky\n\nJon\n\nDurk\n\nPeep\n\nKim\n\nBaby\n\nBibby\n\nReese\n\nWyte\n\nScrappy\n\nMo\n\nRob\n\nPete\n\nTracy\n\nDebbie\n\nGeniuz\n\nSnupe\n\nPhat\n\nYee\n\nBlood\n\nLonnie\n\nCray\n\nWop\n\nBoom\n\nWindex\n\nDeuce Deuce\n\nB Tha Grinda\n\nUgly Mane\n\nB\n\nDude\n\nOkay, it doesn’t work for everyone. Lil Pete now just sounds like a guy named Pete and our boy Lil Windex now just sounds like your run-of-the-mill cleaning product. Maybe it works for 40% of the Lil-named rappers.\n\nLet’s try some other adjectives.\n\nBig Uzi Vert\n\nChilly Wayne\n\nTasty Pump\n\nSmooth Yachty\n\nHot Xan\n\nSalty Dicky\n\nSpicy Jon\n\nGiant Durk\n\nLoud Peep\n\nShriekingKim\n\nDumb Baby\n\nTipsy Bibby\n\nWily Reese\n\nBlank Wyte\n\nHeavy Scrappy\n\nTasty Mo\n\nTasty Rob\n\nTasty Pete\n\nWacky Tracy\n\nDebbie Snuggles\n\nHoarse Geniuz\n\nTipsy Snupe\n\nSkinny Phat\n\nHappy Yee\n\nChubby Blood\n\nIndigo Lonnie\n\nSmooth Cray\n\nFlop Wop\n\nBumping Boom\n\nWindex (nothing would make this one cool)\n\nTasty Deuce Deuce\n\nMaster B Tha Grinda\n\nMustard Ugly Mane\n\nOnly B\n\nTasty Dude\n\nSo, not bad. It’s a start.\n\nIt’s a Lil Start to employ the parlance of our times.\n\nJust Google adjectives, there’s plenty to choose from. We can make these names pop y’all. We can do it, for each and everyone of you.\n\nWell, except for Lil Windex.\n\nYou’re on your own."
