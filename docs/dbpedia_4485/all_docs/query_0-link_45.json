        "text": "Too Phat is a Malaysian hip-hop duo, consisting of Joe Flizzow (born Johan Ishak in Kuala Lumpur, 16 October 1979, aka The President) and Malique Ibrahim (born in Johore Bahru, 21 August 1977, aka The General).\n\nContents\n\n1 Career\n\n2 Recent developments\n\n3 Discography\n\n3.1 Albums\n\n3.2 Solo albums\n\n3.3 Singles\n\n4 Awards and achievements\n\n5 External links\n\nCareer\n\nIn the late 1990s Joe Flizzow and Malique Ibrahim formed a musical duo under the Positive Tone label. Their first big break came in 1999 when their first singles, Li'l Fingaz and Too Phat Baby entered normal rotation on local radio.\n\nOn the back of the success of these first singles, work soon began on an album entitled Plan B. So far, Plan B has sold over 45,000 copies, earning double platinum status in Malaysia. Cashing in on the duo's fame, recording label Positive Tone, a subsidiary of EMI International, produced a re-issue of Plan B entitled Plan B Platinum Edition, including two new songs, \"Clap to This\" and \"Last Song\". Song lyrics were also included in the Platinum Edition and all albums and singles thereafter.\n\nThe music video for a track from Plan B, \"Just a Friend\", was produced in collaboration with Maxis Hotlink and debuted on Malaysian television channel ntv7. The video features cameo appearances from local artistes M. Nasir, Fauziah Latiff and Ferhad, and Malaysian track and field athlete Watson Nyambek. Most of the scenes were shot locally, in the city of Kuala Lumpur. The group controversially used their video to confront issues regarding homosexuality, addressing a topic which is usually avoided in conservative Malaysia. \"Just a Friend\" became the first music video produced by a local music act to be shown on national television. Too Phat have also collaborated with American hip hop artist Warren G.\n\nIn 2005, they produced their latest album Rebirth Into Reality featuring various hip-hop artists from East Asia. The album's first single Dua Dunia features award winning Malaysian singer Siti Nurhaliza.\n\nRecent developments\n\nThe group are now signed to Kartel Records, a label that Joe Flizzow created. The duo launched Phatcaps, a merchandising label for Too Phat, where the first editions of the KL caps was introduced (Baseball style in Black & White, Baseball style in Red & White, Trucker style in camouflage and baby pink only). In 2007, Joe Flizzow re-launched the 'KL cap' under his own label called State Of Mine Caps, by Kartel Clothing with Limited Edition KL caps in black and gold and white and gold combinations.\n\nAfter their album Rebirth into Reality, the duo announced of their intention to explore their musical tastes as solo artists.\n\nJoe Flizzow released his first solo album, The President, in December 2008. The album features hip hop legend KRS-One. Malique is now married with Melissa Maureen, and has recently released his solo album, OK.\n\nDiscography\n\nAlbums\n\nWhuttadilly\n\nPlan B\n\nPhat Family\n\n360°\n\nToo Phat: The Classics\n\nRebirth Into Reality\n\nToo Phat Too Furious\n\nToo Phat : The Greatest Hits\n\nTBA,2011\n\nSolo albums\n\nThe President, 2008 (Joe Flizzow solo album)\n\nOk, 2008 (Malique Ibrahim solo album)\n\nMalique & Dj Fuzz: K.O The Mixtape, 2009 (Malique Ibrahim solo album)\n\nTKO:Peace Out, 2011 (Malique Ibrahim's solo album)\n\n50\", 2011 (Malique Ibrahim's Solo Album)\n\nSingles\n\nLi'l Fingaz\n\nToo Phat Baby\n\nJezzebelle\n\nAnak Ayam\n\nTell Shorty (feat.
