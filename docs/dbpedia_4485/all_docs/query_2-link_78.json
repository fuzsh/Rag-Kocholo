        "text": "''They used to wear that stuff, y'know, back in the day,'' says one teen-ager.\n\n''It's not just phat,'' observes another. ''It's da bomb.''\n\n''Jiggy,'' the first agrees. ''But the way she wears it is all that. Musta cost a scrillion.''\n\nWelcome to the evanescent village of teen-age slang, land of fleeting meanings and laid-back superlatives. In the interest of transgenerational interaction, here is a translation of some recent usages, which by the time they get to me are probably on the way out.\n\nAll that means ''conceited.'' It is a shortening of all that and a bag of chips, with the emphasis on the and. The rhythm is similar to the ancient pretty please with a cherry on top, but the reference is to fast-food excess, as if to complain ''too much.'' Although The Los Angeles Times Magazine wrote of Leonardo DiCaprio that ''Hollywood's newest heartthrob is all that and a bag of chips,'' the primary meaning is not ''overpowering'' but ''stuck up.''\n\nBack in the day is an updating of ''in olden times.'' To teen-agers, this can reach back six months to a year. ''My students use back in the day to impart a nostalgic feel,'' reports Marcia Tanner, a teacher in Michigan. ''It seems to apply to anything that happened prior to their own involvement, as far back as last season.'' Reporting from Woodstock, N.Y., James Cobb wrote in The New York Times that ''Eric Halpern, 21, a student at Rockland Community College, shouted, 'That is phat!' when he spotted the New Beetle [a reintroduced Volkswagen] at a filling station.'' Though some have postulated the origin of phat as an acronym for ''pretty hips and thighs'' or even more lascivious constructions, the word is more likely a deliberate misspelling of fat, which has for centuries had a slang meaning of ''rich,'' as in ''fat and happy.''"
