        "text": "What is buccal fat removal?\n\nBuccal fat is the fat between your cheekbones and jaw bones that help make up the shape of your face. Everyone has buccal fat, but some people have more than others.\n\nBuccal fat removal is a surgery to remove the fat in this area of your face. Removing this fat can highlight the bone structure in your face, especially your cheekbones and the hollowed-out areas between your cheeks and jawline. This procedure is also sometimes called a cheek reduction.\n\nBuccal fat removal surgery is a type of plastic surgery. The decision to have plastic surgery is a personal one. It’s best to consider plastic surgery only if you truly desire to modify your appearance and not because someone else wants you to. It’s also important to consider the possible benefits and risks of having plastic surgery.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCleveland Clinic is a non-profit academic medical center. Advertising on our site helps support our mission. We do not endorse non-Cleveland Clinic products or services. Policy\n\nWho is a good candidate for buccal fat removal?\n\nSome people may feel the roundness in their cheeks creates a fullness to their face they don’t like. Having a cheek reduction can alleviate the sense of fullness or “chubbiness” of your cheeks.\n\nYou may consider having this procedure if you:\n\nDon’t like the appearance of fullness in your cheeks.\n\nAre otherwise healthy and have a stable weight.\n\nYou may not be a good candidate for buccal fat removal if your face is narrow or if you’re over a certain age, as buccal fat naturally diminishes with age.\n\nBuccal fat removal surgery is usually performed by a healthcare provider with special training in plastic surgery procedures such as a licensed plastic surgeon.\n\nWhat happens before a buccal fat removal surgery?\n\nBefore buccal fat removal surgery, you’ll meet with your healthcare provider. They’ll discuss with you what you’d like to achieve from surgery, as well as what to expect during and after your procedure.\n\nDuring your initial visit, your provider will examine you and likely take photographs of your face. They’ll also ask you general questions about your overall health, such as your family health history and any past surgeries you’ve had. They’ll take basic health information such as your blood pressure and discuss any current medications you take. It’s important for you to tell your provider about all of your medications, including herbs and supplements. For best outcomes, they may want you to stop smoking or using tobacco products prior to surgery.\n\nDuring this time, your healthcare provider will address any questions you have and explain what to expect during the surgery. They can provide recommendations tailored to your specific goals and discuss any risks for the procedure.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhat happens during a buccal fat removal procedure?\n\nBuccal fat removal can be done in a hospital or in your healthcare provider’s office, and you’ll go home the same day.\n\nDuring your procedure, you can expect the following:\n\nYou’ll receive a local anesthetic to numb the skin on your face so you won’t feel any pain. You’ll remain awake during the procedure. If you’re having more than one procedure done at the same time, you may receive general anesthesia. Your provider will want you to arrange for transportation afterward if you receive general anesthesia.\n\nYour plastic surgeon will make a small incision on the inside of your mouth on both sides of your face to expose the buccal fat pads.\n\nYour provider will press gently on the fat pads to further expose them, then cut and remove the fat pads.\n\nFinally, your provider will close the incisions with sutures. Often, the sutures are dissolvable. Your provider will let you know if you need to come back for suture removal after your procedure.\n\nWhat happens after this procedure?\n\nAfter your procedure, your healthcare provider will explain how to care for your incisions. They may give you a special mouth rinse to help with healing and prevent infection. You’ll be on a liquid diet for a day or two while your incisions start to heal. Gradually, you can add soft foods to your diet as your provider says it’s OK.\n\nSome things you can expect after surgery:\n\nSwelling.\n\nBruising.\n\nNumbness at the incision sites.\n\nThese should gradually fade as your body heals. Healing time is usually about three weeks. It will take time — usually several months — before you’ll see the final results.\n\nWhat are the risks associated with buccal fat removal surgery?\n\nWith any surgery, you must weigh the risks and the potential benefits of having the procedure. Your healthcare provider will discuss with you any risks so you can make an informed decision.\n\nSome risks associated with buccal fat removal surgery are:\n\nInfection at the incision site.\n\nInjury to facial nerves and/or salivary duct injury.\n\nNumbness or sensation changes.\n\nAsymmetry.\n\nWhat is the recovery time for buccal fat removal surgery?\n\nAfter your procedure, your provider will give you instructions on what to do to promote healing. It’s important to follow your provider’s after-care instructions, including any follow-up appointments. Healing time after this procedure is usually about three weeks, but it will take several months to see the final results.\n\nWhen can I go back to work/school/drive/eat?\n\nYou can return to normal activities when your provider says it’s OK — usually after a few days to a week."
