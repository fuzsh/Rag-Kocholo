(LetÃ¢â¬â¢s avoid the hated and hatred)\n\nSyakkireena a’ kulli ni’ma (Let’s remain thankful with what we have)\n\nBa’ ideena anil fattana (Let’s avoid all lies and sins)\n\nVerse 1\n\nI feel the heat\n\nFrom these 4 candles burning\n\nAs I’m staring out the window\n\nIn solitude I look at life\n\nFrom different angles\n\nThoughts strangled\n\nMy mind is suffocatin’\n\nIn this truth quest\n\nA greed law\n\nThat we abide by is ruthless\n\nEnough will never satisfy\n\nUntil we toothless\n\nFilthy millionaires\n\nAre gamblin’ until they muflis\n\nA sad fact of life\n\nBut mankind approved this\n\nI gotta call Him\n\nSajadah is where the booth is\n\nI’ll make it clear that\n\nI ain’t even tryin’ to preach ya\n\nBy sharing thoughts I hope\n\nTo find a little peace here\n\nI thank Allah for blessing me\n\nTo be creative\n\nSo here’s a diss for me\n\nFor bein’ unappreciative\n\nWanted a perfect life\n\nYeah smile then die old\n\nFame, money, women\n\nPhat cribos and white gold\n\nDrive my own Beemer\n\nBefore I hit two six\n\nA straight pink bitin’ toothpicks\n\nWho walk around town wit’ two chicks\n\nAnd doin’ new hits to woo tricks….\n\nNow that’s wrong\n\nPleasure from partyin’\n\nAnd bullshit don’t last long\n\nA lotta yuppies sneakin’\n\nCars out when dad’s gone\n\nCrackin’ bottles in clubs\n\nFrontin’ designer fashion\n\nBut I ain’t about\n\nTo trade happiness for a Jag\n\nSo stop smilin’ with your ragtop down\n\nCause for a fact\n\nI don’t care about your money\n\nOr how slick your car\n\n‘Cause no matter how rich and big you are\n\nIt’s still Allahuakbar…\n\nChorus\n\nUlt li albi bissaraha (I’m opening up my heart with honesty)\n\nHayya nab’idil karaha (LetÃ¢â¬â¢s avoid the hated and hatred)\n\nSyakkireena a’ kulli ni’ma (Let’s remain thankful with what we have)\n\nBa’ ideena anil fattana (Let’s avoid all lies and sins)\n\nVerse 2\n\nI know that all this\n\nAin’t the right thing\n\nPartying, chasing moneys\n\nAnd material things\n\nFlying high\n\nThink nobody gonna\n\nClip my wings\n\nI’m lying to myself\n\nKnowing that\n\nI’ve been neglecting\n\nResponsibilities\n\nAs a healthy Muslim\n\nRiches and loot\n\nAin’t nothing\n\nWe frontin’\n\nDiamonds and scrilla\n\nBut forget to say\n\nAlhamdulillah\n\nMade my album a killer\n\nPlan B\n\nNow 2-3 droppin’\n\nAnd I wish to\n\nAsk for forgiveness\n\nYour guidance\n\nProtection and strength\n\nFor humbleness and faith\n\nTo make me a better man\n\nSuccess in foreign lands\n\nNever dreamt of that\n\nI remember being 18\n\nWhen we started Too Phat\n\nNow let’s go back\n\nThree years before that\n\nSometimes I forget\n\nMe and my parents\n\nTook a trip with granddad\n\nI remember ’95\n\nWhile performing Umrah\n\nMade my wish in Mecca\n\nRight in front the Kaabah\n\nDear God\n\nYou made it possible\n\nWhen facing obstacles\n\nPlease let me do good\n\nBefore I pass on\n\nIn the hospital\n\nAnd keep reciting\n\nThe Testimony of Faith\n\nAnd find the right way\n\nOut of this life’s maze\n\nChorus\n\nUlt li albi bissaraha (I’m opening up my heart with honesty)\n\nHayya nab’idil karaha (LetÃ¢â¬â¢s avoid the hated and hatred)\n\nSyakkireena a’ kulli ni’ma (Let’s remain thankful with what we have)\n\nBa’ ideena anil fattana (Let’s avoid all lies and sins)\n\nVerse 3\n\nAy yoÃ¢â¬Â¦\n\nTwo candles go out\n\nThat’s when\n\nI feel the wind blow\n\nI haven’t met Fatim\n\nFor two years\n\nBeen livin’ like I’m single\n\nEvaluatin’ all the friendships\n\nRelationship\n\nThe reason it’s the tenth year\n\nIs ’cause she’s a patient chick\n\nAnd as far as friends are concerned\n\nMany I’ve had it all\n\nFrom those who cried for my pain\n\nTo those who plotted my fall\n\nI learned to differentiate\n\nFakes from the great\n\nMates from the snakes\n\nApes wanna beef\n\nHate’s all it takes\n\nFor me to blow\n\nA diss song for you\n\nNot even worthy\n\nAs an album filler\n\nSo now it’s smiles\n\nAnd Alhamdulillah\n\nYeah, love me\n\nOr hate me\n\nThis who I am\n\nLook at the past at times\n\nI wish that I was born again\n\nSo I can rectify mistakes\n\nAnd my wrong doings\n\nAttempts on minimizing my sins\n\nBefore my story ends\n\nI ain’t no Eddie Murphy\n\nTryin’ to sound as a holy man\n\nBut if I tried to be a better person\n\nNow I prolly can\n\n(Wait…)\n\nWho am I to advise you\n\nI ain’t been the best\n\nOf God’s slaves\n\nJust a poet writin’\n\nWhat my thought says\n\nA little house\n\nA little car\n\nA little sweet girl\n\nThank you Lord\n\nI’ll try to slow it down\n\nOn the cheap thrills\n\nThis song will prolly stir\n\nA little controversy\n\nAt least I ain’t be rappin’\n\nBout the stuff\n\nAs tho’ I’m born in Jersey\n\nStage name is Malique\n\nAnd lost name is Cairel\n\nMama told me\n\nStop complaining too much,\n\nSo I will…\n\nChorus\n\nUlt li albi bissaraha (I’m opening up my heart with honesty)\n\nHayya nab’idil karaha (LetÃ¢â¬â¢s avoid the hated and hatred)\n\nSyakkireena a’ kulli
