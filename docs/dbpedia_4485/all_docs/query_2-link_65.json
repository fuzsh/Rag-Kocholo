        "text": "Overview\n\nGallery\n\nSynopsis\n\nRelationships\n\nRemember this lesson, Red Riot!! When fighting villains... quickly making them lose the will to fight is everything!!\n\nTaishiro Toyomitsu to Eijiro Kirishima in \"Let's Go, Gutsy Red Riot\"\n\nTaishiro Toyomitsu (豊 (とよ) 満 (みつ) 太 (たい) 志 (し) 郎 (ろう) , Toyomitsu Taishirō?),[2] also known as BMI Hero: Fat Gum (BMI (ビーエムアイ) ヒーロー ファットガム, Bīemuai Hīrō Fatto Gamu?), is the current No. 58 Pro Hero.[3]\n\nHe employed Suneater and Red Riot during the Shie Hassaikai Arc and Endeavor Agency Arc with the addition of Real Steel.\n\nAppearance[]\n\nIn his fat form, Taishiro is a large, round man, easily towering over other adults. In this form, his mouth is wide, and his nose is smaller, which gives him an odd look alongside his odd body proportions. After burning through his fat, however, it is revealed that he is pretty muscular, and his body adapts to conventional proportions.\n\nHis hero costume consists of black pants and an orange, zippered hood, which has the initials of his alias on the front of Fat Gum, written with a clear F, G and an inverted F. Alongside them, he also wears gloves, metallic boots, and a mask that goes around his eyes and over his forehead.\n\nHis hero costume in My Hero Academia: Vigilantes, which takes place several years ago, is the same, except that the initials of his alias are written with only a black F and G. In addition, he wears dark forearm guards.\n\nGallery[]\n\nPersonality[]\n\nTaishiro appears to be constantly hungry, which leads him to eat a lot. He is very friendly towards civilians and other heroes, appearing to be a playful and carefree person. However, he gets earnest when the situation demands it, always having the work ethic of a hero.\n\nWhenever Taishiro is focused on doing the right thing, he becomes impulsive and determined, especially when life is at stake. In this case, he becomes utterly enraged, impatient, and disapproves of lengthy operations.\n\nDue to his time working with the police, Taishiro is very knowledgeable about Japan's underworld. He can recognize potential when he sees it, complimenting Tamaki's prowess as a hero, though the latter thinks of it as harassment. Taishiro also extends this to Eijiro after he held his own against a villain and praised his will to continue.\n\nTaishiro is kind and will prioritize helping people and saving lives first. He cares deeply about the well-being of others, especially those in his care, which is why he becomes so angry when villains threaten the lives of others. After the fight with Eight Bullets, he was perturbed about Eijiro's state and cried tears of relief when he realized Eijiro was fine.\n\nAbilities[]\n\nOverall Abilities: Taishiro is very capable, possessing impressive formidability, even for his rank as the No. 58 Pro Hero. Taishiro uses Fat Absorption to effectively restrain criminals in his line of work, enveloping them with his prominent figure. Despite his size, Taishiro makes sure to subdue targets quickly. Taishiro frequently acts as a human shield for his allies in combat since most attacks barely faze him anyway. Should he find himself against an enemy that can bypass his defenses through sheer power alone, Taishiro can trade his fat away for a counterattack powered up by the sum of all the impact energy dealt by the foe on his body.\n\nTaishiro's abilities were pushed to the limit when he and Eijiro battled against Kendo Rappa and Hekiji Tengai of the Eight Bullets. Kendo first sent a body-hardened Eijiro flying a reasonable distance away with a single punch before turning his attention to Taishiro (who was distracted by Eijiro being hurled away) and repeatedly barraged him with a volley of punches throughout their battle. Taishiro attempted to punch Kendo but was blocked by a Barrier erected by Hekiji. Once Eijiro regained his resolve and stepped in to better endure Kendo's flurry of punches, Taishiro was bought enough time to transfer all of the accumulated energy he absorbed from the impact of Kendo's attacks into one final punch to ultimately defeat the 2 Shie Hassaikai members. In the Final War against the villains, Taishiro was chosen to take command of the forces to defeat the stragglers left behind by Operation Troy.\n\nEnhanced Strength: Taishiro is shown to have incredible strength, as he can grab hold of multiple villain mechs and keep them in his grip while using his Quirk. He can also crush two pieces of hard candy with his bare hand.\n\nEnhanced Durability: Taishiro has excellent durability thanks to the amount of fat he has compiled. He can take several assaults from Kendo Rappa's powerful bullet punches and keep standing, whereas Eijiro's \"Unbreakable\" Ultimate Move was barely able to defend against one of Kendo's punches.\n\nEnhanced Speed: Despite his stature, Taishiro's speed is rather impressive, as he can react quickly against troubling situations.\n\nEnhanced Stamina: Despite being highly injured, Taishiro continued to battle Kendo Rappa, showing incredible stamina when even the powerful Ejiro Kirishima could not stand after just one barrage of punches.\n\nKeen Intellect: Taishiro possesses a very keen intellect and analytical mind. After witnessing the Quirks of Kendo and Hekiji, Taishiro realized the duo was not on the Quirk roster for the Shie Hassaikai Raid Team and that battling the pair would be difficult. Following his second endurance of Kendo's bullet punches, Taishiro surmised that getting in close doesn't give the BMI Hero a chance to dodge the assault, and due to the amount of strength behind the brawler's attacks, Taishiro's Fat Absorption couldn't absorb all of the damage. With his deductions, Taishiro concluded that Kendo would wear him down until the hero was out of sight. And, despite the bickering he noticed between Kendo and Hekiji, Taishiro knew that Hekiji would still produce a barrier if Kendo needed it, rendering the defeat of the Yakuza dyad near impossible with Hekiji still standing.\n\nWithstanding Kendo's onslaught a third time, Taishiro noticed that the Eight Bullets member's punches were getting faster, and each blow was stronger than the last, making the obese hero question whether he could hold out against Kendo as long as he intended. In the aftermath of the battle, Kendo could rise to his feet, making Taishiro deduce that Hekiji's barrier had cushioned his energy-stockpiled attack. When Kendo told the battle-worn BMI Hero there was a medical supplies room that he and the present heroes could use to treat their injuries, Taishiro, taking note of the candidness of the brawler's words, understood that Kendo wasn't leading him and Eijiro into a trap, as he skeptically believed was the case at first.\n\nPolice Intuition: Taishiro is a successful hero with extensive experience working alongside Japan's Police Force, granting him a greater understanding of both police body functions and protocol compared to the average Pro Hero. This intuition is shown by how Taishiro was able to understand complex drug trafficking networks and forensics by how he collected a prototype Quirk-Destroying Drug for testing, making him a significant asset to the Nighteye Agency's investigation and raid of the Shie Hassaikai.\n\nQuirk[]\n\nFat Absorption (脂 (し) 肪 (ぼう) 吸 (きゅう) 着 (ちゃく) , Shibō Kyūchaku?): Taishiro's Quirk allows him to make anything adhere to his obese body on contact and sink into his body fat. His fat can also store kinetic energy, which he can convert into offensive muscle at the cost of his fat, thus weakening his defense.\n\nUltimate Moves[]\n\nFataxi (個 (こ) 人 (じん) タクシー, Kojin takushī?): Taishiro can use his Quirk to hold anyone smaller than him within his body as passengers. He uses this move to escort his allies in or out of battles.\n\nStats[]\n\nPower 5/6 A Speed 2/6 D Technique 4/6 B Wits 4/6 B Absorbability 5/6 A\n\nTaishiro's stats, according to the Ultra Analysis Book\n\nBattles & Events[]\n\nBattles & Events\n\nShie Hassaikai Arc\n\nHero Work-Studies I\n\nFat Gum Agency vs. Villains\n\nShie Hassaikai Raid\n\nBattle of Spears & Shields\n\nPro Hero Arc\n\nHero Billboard Chart JP\n\nEndeavor Agency Arc\n\nHero Work-Studies II\n\nMy Hero Academia: World Heroes' Mission\n\nMission: Humarise\n\nPro Heroes vs. Humarise\n\nParanormal Liberation War Arc\n\nParanormal Liberation War\n\nGunga Mountain Villa Raid\n\nVilla Raid Team vs. Paranormal Liberation Front\n\nVilla Raid Team & Trainees vs. Paranormal Liberation Front\n\nFinal War Arc\n\nFinal War\n\nOperation Troy\n\nTroy Team vs. Kunieda\n\nBattles & Events\n\nOsaka Incident Arc\n\nFat Gum & Police Force vs. Number 6\n\nSky Egg Arc\n\nOnomura Pharma Corp.

His given name contains the Kan'yo-on reading for \"plump, healthy\" (太 tai), both the Go-on and Kan-on reading for \"purpose, determination\" (志 shi), and the common male suffix of \"son\" (郎 ro).\n\nAccording to Betten Court, the illustrator of the spinoff, My Hero Academia: Vigilantes, Fat Gum's design is one of Kohei Horikoshi's personal favorites. As a result, Betten states he takes extra care when drawing him in the spinoff series.\n\nTaishiro's rankings in the Popularity Polls are as follows:\n\nRanked 20th in the Third Popularity Poll.\n\nRanked 30th in the Fourth Popularity Poll.\n\nTaishiro's English voice actor, Kyle Hebert, also voices Timothy Agpar.\n\nReferences[]\n\nSite Navigation[]"
