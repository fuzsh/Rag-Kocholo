        "text": "Chapter 7\n\n|Alyana Owens|\n\nI was finally going back to school today. I took my time walking I wasn't in a rush. I left the house early, well not really my uncle made me leave because he was having company over. Like nigga it's 6 am. That's when they should be leaving not arriving.\n\nI made my way to my locker. I know I had a lot of work to turn in due to my absence. I closed my locker and screamed.\n\n\"Oh shit y'all scared me.\" I said holding my hand over my beating heart. Cosmo didn't say anything. I know I owe her an apology for the way I treated her. Keith was just starting at me. He was making me feel uncomfortable. It's let he could read me.\n\n\"We sorry girl. Where have you been?\" Lonnie asked.\n\n\"Oh my uncle had to have surgery and then I caught a bad cold.\" I lied. Cosmo scoffed. Keith was still staring at me.\n\n\"Well I'm glad your better and tell your uncle I hope he makes a speedy recovery.\" Lonnie said. I nodded.\n\n\"Let's go to class we don't want to hear Mr. Johnson mouth about being late.\" Lonnie said. I nodded. The walk to class was awkward. I just hope today go by fast.\n\n‚óè‚óè‚óè‚óè‚óè‚óè‚óè\n\nWe were now sitting at our lunch table laughing and just having fun. Yet Keith still hasn't said anything to me.\n\n\"Hey Kush.\" I hear some girl say. She walked over and hugged Keith. He hugged her back. Who was she?\n\n\"Wassup ma?\" He smiled at her. You could tell they had history together.\n\n\"Nothing, but can I talk to you about something in private?\"\n\n\"Yeah.\" He said. They walked away. I watched as the walked out of sight. I'm not give lie my heart broke.\n\n\"So why did your uncle have to go to the hospital?\" Lonnie said. I know she noticed my face.\n\n\"Uhh oh yeah. He had to have surgery on his knee.\" I lied. Really his knee? That's all I had to come up with? I mentally face palmed myself.\n\n\"Oh.\"\n\n\"What have I missed?\" I asked changing the subject.\n\n\"Nothing really. We all just missed you tons.\" Cosmo said. Yeah we made up in fifth period.\n\nThe rest of lunch Keith never came back. I'm not gone lie I was a little disappointed. He wasn't even in sixth or seventh period.\n\nWe all had to catch a ride with Rony since Keith was gone. I wonder who that girl was. She probably was his girlfriend. She looked better then me I know that much. Yeah she was on the plus side, but she looked so confident. Let's not forget how she carried herself. I wanted to be her. I envied her because she got the man that I've always wanted.\n\nOnly if things were different.\n\nWe all walked into Keith office and the bitch had the nerve to be sitting on his desk laughing and giggling. I rolled my eyes. I didn't even bother to look at him. I just grab some work and left.\n\n|Keith \"Kush\" Daniels|\n\nI was so happy when I found out Shantel was moving back to our home town. I missed her like crazy. Shantel was always there for me when we were younger. Anything I needed she helped me with. We might be a year apart, but we as real as they come. I'd give her the back off my shirt. I got mad love for this big headed ass lil girl.\n\n\"So what brought you back home?\" I asked. She moved away when we were ten and I didn't hear from her in years until she hit me up on Facebook.\n\n\"I was tried of living in Cali. I wanted to come back home.\" She said. I nodded.\n\n\"You sure you just didn't miss me?\" I said. She rolled her eyes.\n\n\"Nigga ain't nobody missed your big headed ass.\" She said.\n\n\"The lies.\" I said.\n\nWe were at the trap catching up on the shit we missed when the crew walked in. Alyana just walked in grabbed a bag and walked out slamming the door. The fuck her problem?\n\n\"So when we gone do this shit?\" Rony asked with an attitude. What's wrong with his ass?\n\n\"Saturday night. I got Mac them watching them Northside niggas.\" I said. I could sense the tension in the air, but I didn't know why.\n\n\"Who the fuck is this bitch?\" Cosmo asked pointing at Shantel. One thing about Shantel she don't let nobody disrespect her. She'll shoot first and ask questions later, if you still alive.\n\n\"Don't worry about who the fuck I am. What you need to worry about is called minding your fucking business.\" Shantel snapped.\n\n\"Who the fuck is this telly tubby as hoe?\" Cosmo said. Shantel laughed. Shit bout to get real.\n\n\"Not a hoe, but it's funny how a true hoe can try to call the next female a hoe.\" Shantel said.\n\n\"All y'all get out.\" I said. This shit not about to go down in my office. Cosmo and Lonnie stormed out like Alyana did.\n\n\"Bruh you fucked up big time.\" Rony said. What the hell he talking about?\n\n\"Bruh what the hell you talking about?\"\n\n\"You brung some random hoe here and you left with her.\" He said looking at Shantel.\n\n\"Okay she not a hoe and so what she here?\"\n\n\"She disrespected Cosmo and you not gone do nothing about it?\"\n\n\"First all y'all work for me. I don't work for y'all. Who I bring in my shit is my business. Secondly Cosmo came at her wrong first. Cosmo and everybody else that was in here always jumping to fucking conclusions about shit they don't know. I don't give a fuck who mad or who don't like it. Shantel gone be around for a long time. If somebody don't like it then too damn bad.\" I said irritated. They can miss me with the bullshit. I don't have time for it. He looked at me and walked out.\n\n\"That went well.\" Shantel said. I chuckled.\n\n\"Better then I expected.\" I replied getting back to work."
