        "text": "Causes\n\nThere are several different causes for excessive fat around the neck. The most common being the same for excess fat on any other part of the body, being overweight. But what if you are not overweight and have just accumulated excess neck fat?\n\nYes, even people who are at their ideal weight can suffer with face and neck fat. The causes for this can be anything from water retention to more serious causes such as hormonal, thyroid or gland problems. Or, it could simply be genetic, some people are genetically predisposed to the appearance of neck fat. The cause being that their family has a history of skin with little elasticity and if the skin loses its elasticity it cannot hold the fat around the chin and neck firmly.\n\nAside from being generally overweight or genetic, another common cause is aging. There is a large muscle in the neck called the Platysma which starts at the jaw and ends at the collar bone. Over time we forget to engage this muscle in our day to day activities and as a result the muscle loses tone. This combined with loose subcutaneous tissue on our face and neck, which is more prone to fat deposition, can leave us open to a double-chin or fat neck beginning to take shape.\n\nImpact on Life\n\nHaving excess neck fat, particularly if it’s due to obesity can be associated with certain risks. Overweight people with a fat neck tend to have more narrow airways in the throat which can increase the risk of sleep apnea. Excess neck fat caused by thyroid or hormone issues such as PCOS have their own complications (which you would need to see a doctor about if you suspected this was the cause of yours) but a common factor across all causes is that a fat neck can have a huge impact on the sufferers’ self-esteem.\n\nNeck fat can seriously effect a person’s well-being, knocking their confidence sometimes to the point where they no longer feel good about themselves or want to leave the house. While an effect this severe on a person’s confidence is extreme and would require some additional support, visible insecurities on a person’s face and neck tend to have a larger effect on the sufferers self-esteem as they are harder to hide or disguise.\n\nTreatments Available & How they work\n\nThe good news is there are now a number of revolutionary treatments which can improve the appearance of neck fat.\n\nAs a first port of call we would always recommend to attempt to remove neck fat using conventional methods such as living a healthy lifestyle, eating a good and balanced diet and exercising regularly. There are exercises you can do specifically to target the neck area in order to help reduce a build-up of neck fat.\n\nIf you believe your neck fat could be caused by water retention or another medical or hormonal issue ensure you see a doctor to get the best medical advice.\n\nIf you have tried both of these options or don’t believe either of these are the root cause then there are a number of aesthetic and surgical treatments available to you.\n\nSculpSure Submental – Non-Surgical\n\nSculpSure Submental is a pioneering neck sculpting treatment by Cynosure. It is the newest treatment available on the market for the treatment of the neck and chin area and has achieved a 100% patient satisfaction rate at clinic trials.\n\nSculpSure works by using laser technology to target and destroy fat cells. The damaged cells are then removed from the body over 4-6 weeks via the body’s lymphatic system resulting in permanent elimination.\n\nPatients have reported fantastic results from just two SculpSure Submental procedures when treating neck fat.\n\nThe SculpSure Submental treatment is completely non-invasive and virtually pain free. The treatment takes just 25mins and there is absolutely no down time following treatment.\n\nBOTOX – Non-Surgical\n\nBOTOX can be used cosmetically to reduce or remove wrinkles by paralyzing (temporarily) certain areas of facial expression. The treatment can also be used to achieve a temporary neck lift.\n\nThis would involve injecting BOTOX into the submental area and neck cords, redefining both the neck and jawline resulting in a lift effect.\n\nThis particular treatment requires a number of injections in different areas of the jaw and neck, a consultation would be required to assess your individual needs but typically BOTOX injections take less than 20 minutes and there is no downtime following the procedure.\n\nThe effects of BOTOX injections last between 4-6 months.\n\nPelleve Skin Tightening\n\nThe Pellevé®system can treat aging related problems on the facial and neck areas such as wrinkles, skin laxity, jowls and loose neck skin.\n\nThis treatment is perfect for treating the remaining loose skin which can be caused by ageing or left following fat loss or a fat removal treatment.\n\nThe system uses radio frequency energy to build a level of heat which targets the point where skin meets the fatty layers. This process encourages the growth of new collagen and therefore improves conditions related with skin elasticity and reduces the appearance of wrinkles by tightening the skin.\n\nLiposuction – Surgical\n\nIf none of the above options are deemed suitable for you a surgical option is liposuction.\n\nLiposuction involves making a small incision under the chin where a tube is inserted and fat is removed via a suction method. The procedure would usually be carried out under general anaesthetic or in some cases local anaesthetic. Typically a patient would expect a few weeks of recovery in which swelling, bruising and sometimes numbness can occur.\n\nIn the vast majority of cases no repeat treatments are required unless the patient experiences further weight gain due to lifestyle choices."
