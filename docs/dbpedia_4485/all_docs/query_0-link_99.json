        "text": "General Booty, the nephew of former USC quarterback John David Booty, has been a mainstay on the all-name team since his arrival at the FBS level and remains the cornerstone of this squad in 2024. The former Oklahoma backup was stuck behind some of the nation's best signal-callers over the last two seasons and transferred this spring to ULM. Booty, who opened his career in the junior college ranks and led the nation in passing yards as a freshman, made two appearances for the Sooners during his redshirt sophomore campaign.\n\nRocky Beers debuts on the all-name team in 2024 due in large part to his brother, Rowdy Beers, stepping away from football to pursue a career as a firefighter. The former started his career at Air Force but moved to FIU last season and joined his brother in the Panthers' tight end room. He saw action in 11 games and made four starts during that debut season with the program, posting 18 catches for 158 yards and a touchdown. The Beers brothers also have a highly successful sister in Raegan Beers, who starred on the Oregon State women's basketball team and transferred this offseason to Oklahoma.\n\nTulane lost numerous contributors to the transfer portal this offseason amid its coaching change, but Phat Watts is back with the Green Wave for a fifth year. He was one of the team's top pass-catchers in 2020 and 2021 on the heels of his junior college career, but injuries derailed his career. He made his last catch in 2022 before sustaining a season-ending ACL tear and played in just three games last year. A return to full strength, however, could help Watts re-emerge as a rotational wideout during his final year of eligibility.\n\nIt took until his fourth year at Ohio, but Parker Titsworth became an integral part of the Bobcats' offense late in his career. He returns in 2024 for a sixth year of college football as the cornerstone of the offensive line. Titsworth developed for three years in a backup role but flourished in 2022 and started each of the last 27 games ahead of his final year of eligibility. The Ohio offense fired on all cylinders behind Titsworth's blocking over the last two years as one of the top groups in the Group of Five.\n\nKentucky boasts a formidable defensive front for the 2024 season, and while Deone Walker gets most of the attention as a preseason All-American, Octavious Oxendine is a regular force on the defensive line, too. A knee injury in 2021 disrupted a breakout redshirt freshman year for Oxendine, but he bounced back in 2022 as a Comeback Player of the Year candidate and kept things rolling last season when he logged 21 tackles, 5.5 tackles for loss and 2.5 sacks. He started the majority of Kentucky's games over the last three years.\n\nShitta Sillah hit the transfer portal this offseason after a five-year run at Boston College and will be counted upon at Purdue to make an immediate impact. The Boilermakers lost reigning Big Ten sack leader Nic Scourton to Texas A&M and need Sillah to help prevent a major dropoff on the edge. The three-star transfer was a regular in the lineup over each of his first five years, save for the 2022 season in which he sustained a season-ending injury in Week 1, and he posted a pair of sacks in his most recent campaign.\n\nChief Borders became a two-time transfer this offseason when he landed at Pittsburgh as a three-star prospect and the No. 99 edge rusher in the portal. The Panthers list him as a defensive lineman, but he came up to the college level as a linebacker and could play in a hybrid role on our hypothetical all-name team roster. Borders was primarily a special teams player at Florida, saw defensive action across all 12 games at Nebraska last season and will close out his eligibility in his third different power conference.\n\nMajor Burns is the top player on the 2024 all-name team. The veteran LSU leader will be one of the most impactful players on the Tigers roster this fall at the STAR position and is fresh off the best campaign of his career, in which he led LSU with 93 tackles and added 3.5 tackles for loss, a sack, and an interception. Burns initially signed with Georgia and sustained injuries in his first two years at LSU but developed over the latter stages of his career into one of the SEC's most reliable defensive backs.\n\nPig Cage, born Quinton Cage, is no stranger to the transfer portal. Louisiana Tech is his fourth school in five years, and barring an additional year of eligibility, it will be his last. Cage opened his career at the FCS level and was an immediate star at Nicholls, where he racked up 11 tackles for loss as a true freshman. That performance earned him an SEC opportunity at LSU, but after he posted modest production, he landed at the Group of Five level. Cage spent two years at UTSA and now projects as a contributor for Louisiana Tech.\n\nIs there a better fit on the all-name team than Willie Nelson and the Cowboys? The Oklahoma State true freshman exists in the shadow of the country music legend but could make a name for himself in college football over the coming years. Nelson was a three-star prospect and the No. 138 safety in the 2024 recruiting class and starred in Texas 5A high school football during his time at Longview (Texas). A redshirt year may be in order this season, though, given the Cowboys' experience at the safety position.\n\nOnly time will tell if Prince Williams becomes San Diego State football royalty. As one of 18 freshman enrollees in the Aztecs' 2024 recruiting class, Williams picked SDSU over four FCS offers. Though he was overlooked as an FBS prospect, Williams brings plenty to the table as a versatile defensive back who can play anywhere in the secondary. He projects to settle in at cornerback and flashed electric speed at Westlake Village (Calif.) Oaks Christian.\n\nK: COLTON BOOMER, UCF\n\nColton Boomer proved over his first two years at UCF that his last name is indicative of his leg strength. Not only is he 26-of-34 on field goals for his career, but Boomer is outstanding from long range and last year became just the second kicker in program history to hit two 50-yard attempts in one game. The lone miss of his freshman season in 2022 came on a 64-yard attempt in which the ball was not supposed to be snapped.\n\nP: MAX VON MARBURG, SYRACUSE\n\nMaximilian Von Marburg, who goes by Max for short, is a Wagga Wagga, New South Wales, Australia native. He made his American football debut in 2022 during his freshman season at Syracuse, and it was a strong one as he landed on the Ray Guy Award Watch List. Von Marburg did not play last season but showed plenty of promise two years ago when he maxed out at 55 yards and averaged just shy of 40 yards per punt."
