        "text": "Interstate Mobility\n\nEffective Date: July 1, 2024\n\nSB 1600 (Bill Information)\n\nSummary:\n\nThe bill creates the “Mobile Opportunity by Interstate Licensure Endorsement Act” (MOBILE Act) within Chapter 456, F.S., which establishes a new universal process for licensure by endorsement for health care professions regulated by the Florida Department of Health’s (the Department’s) Division of Medical Quality Assurance. To qualify, the health care practitioner must meet specific criteria, including various testing, training, and experience qualifications for their profession. The bill also repeals existing licensure by endorsement statutes from various individual practice acts.\n\nThe bill establishes criteria under which health care practitioners can be licensed by endorsement.\n\nThe bill mandates that applicants comply with the required fingerprint-based criminal history checks for professional licenses, outlines grounds for ineligibility for licensure under this act, such as pending disciplinary proceedings or criminal convictions related to the health care profession, and directs the Department to utilize the National Practitioner Data Bank for verifying applicant credentials.\n\nEach applicable board, or the Department if there is no board, shall adopt rules incorporating application forms for the MOBILE Act licensure pathway within six months after its effective date.\n\nThe bill amends current law for licensure by endorsement in various practice acts to conform to the provisions of the MOBILE Act. The bill does not alter current law relating to licensure by endorsement for radiologist assistants, radiologic technologists, or respiratory therapists.\n\nThe bill provides that, notwithstanding the changes made to the Florida Statutes by the MOBILE Act, a board or the Department, as applicable, may continue processing applications for licensure by endorsement as authorized under the Florida Statutes (2023) until the rules adopted by such board or the Department to implement the changes made by the MOBILE Act take effect or until six months after the bill’s effective date, whichever occurs first.\n\nThe bill requires the Department to submit an annual report to the Governor, the President of the Senate, and the Speaker of the House of Representatives which details, by profession, the number of applications received, licenses issued, denials, complaints received, and disciplinary actions taken against health care practitioners licensed under the MOBILE Act.\n\nHealth Care Practitioners and Massage Therapy\n\nEffective Date: July 1, 2024\n\nHB 197 (Bill Information)\n\nSummary:\n\nThe bill amends quorum requirements for the Board of Massage Therapy to be a majority of current membership and requires the Department of Health (Department) to include specific data on massage therapists and establishments in their annual report.\n\nThe bill authorizes the Department to issue an emergency suspension order, suspending the license of massage therapists and establishments upon receipt of information that the therapist, designated establishment managers, or employees have been arrested for their involvement in certain crimes.\n\nThe bill also establishes new grounds for emergency suspension that broadly applies to all health care practitioners and requires the Department to issue an emergency order suspending the license of any licensee upon a finding that probable cause exists to believe that the licensee has committed sexual misconduct.\n\nThe bill revises definitions relevant to the operation of massage establishments, including “employee,” “designated establishment manager,” “sexual activity,” and “advertising medium.”\n\nThe bill amends massage establishment requirements related to sexual activity prohibition, prohibited conduct and devices, window transparency, signage, employee dress code, and the maintenance and display of employee and customer records. The bill specifies advertising requirements for massage therapists and establishments and prohibits advertisements related to prostitution services. The bill also prohibits massage establishments from being used as a principal or temporary domicile, as a shelter or harbor, or be used as sleeping or napping quarters for any person unless the establishment is zoned for residential use under a local ordinance.\n\nThe bill requires Department investigators to request valid government identification from all employees while in a massage establishment and requires the Department to notify a federal immigration office if they fail to do so. The bill also specifies the documents operators of massage establishments must provide to Department investigators and law enforcement officers upon request. The bill provides that massage establishments in violation of new regulations are a nuisance, subject to abatement or injunction.\n\nHealth Care\n\nEffective Date: March 21, 2024\n\nSB 7016 (Bill Information)\n\nSummary:\n\nThe bill aims to grow Florida’s health care workforce by establishing various health care-related programs and initiatives, removing regulations to increase workforce mobility, and expanding access to quality, efficient health care. Specifically, the bill:\n\nExpands Florida Reimbursement Assistance for Medical and Dental Education: The bill updates and expands the Dental Student Loan Repayment (DSLR) Program and the Florida Reimbursement Assistance for Medical Education (FRAME) Program by allowing mental health professionals, dental hygienists, and private dental practices in areas where there are shortages of practitioners serving Medicaid patients to qualify, increasing loan repayment award amounts for all qualifying health care professionals, and requiring 25 hours of volunteer health services per year to qualify. The bill requires the Department of Health (Department) to provide an annual report detailing loan repayment through both the DSLR and FRAME programs to the Governor and the Legislature through July 1, 2034. The Department is also required to facilitate a study evaluating the impact of student loan repayment programs on health care provider shortages and to submit the study’s results to Governor and the Legislature by January 1, 2023.\n\nExpands the Areas of Critical Need Program: The bill allows Advanced Practice Registered Nurses and Physician Assistants to be issued temporary certificates to practice in these underserved areas, as is currently allowed for physicians.\n\nEstablishes Limited Licensure for Graduate Assistant Physicians: The bill creates a new limited license as a graduate assistant physician (GAP) for medical school graduates who have passed their exams but have not yet been matched into a residency program.\n\nRevises Regulations for Autonomous Nurse Midwives: The bill amends requirements for certified autonomous nurse midwives by replacing the requirement for a transfer agreement with a requirement to maintain a written policy for the transfer of patients who need a higher level of care or emergency services and includes rulemaking authority and monitoring provisions.\n\nLicensure Compacts: The bill provides that Florida will enter into the Interstate Medical Licensure Compact, the Audiology and Speech-Language Pathology Interstate Compact, and the Physical Therapy Licensure Compact.\n\nReduces Barriers for Psychologists/Psychiatric Nurses to Work in Baker Act Facilities: The bill reduces and repeals post-licensure clinical requirements for clinical psychologists and psychiatric nurses to work in Baker Act facilities, includes a three-year clinical experience requirement for more advanced acts performed by a clinical psychologist, and requires a psychiatric nurse to practice within an established protocol.\n\nExpands Access to Free and Charitable Clinics: The bill increases the eligibility threshold to 300% of the federal poverty level, allowing more low-income Floridians access to care.\n\nCreates a Health Screening and Practitioner Volunteer Portal and Grant Program: The bill establishes a health screening portal online where information on low or no-cost health screening opportunities and information for health care practitioners on volunteer opportunities related to such health screenings can be found. The bill also creates a Health Screening Grant Program to support nonprofit entities that are providing no-cost screenings and health services.\n\nCreates Advanced Birth Center Designation: The bill allows a licensed birth center to be designated as an advanced birth center (ABC). The ABC must operate continuously, employ two medical directors (an obstetrician and an anesthesiologist), serve Medicaid recipients, and have a formal arrangement with a nearby hospital in case of an emergency.\n\nRequires ER Diversion Partnerships and Care Coordination: The bill encourages the creation of partnerships between hospitals and primary care settings to improve coordination and encourage patients to establish a medical home to prevent future emergency department visits for non-urgent care by requiring all hospitals with emergency departments to create a plan for helping patients access appropriate care settings when those patients come to the emergency room with a non-emergent condition or indicate they lack regular access to primary care.\n\nThe bill removes the sunset date from the Florida Center for Nursing’s (FCN) duty to submit an annual report to the Governor, the President of the Senate, and the Speaker of the House of Representatives. The required report contains FCN’s analysis of nursing education programs and Florida’s nurse supply to determine if there was an increase in their availability and ability to produce quality nurses.\n\nThe bill expands eligibility for Linking Industry to Nursing Education (LINE) Funding to high-performing independent schools, colleges, or universities that meet performance metrics.\n\nThe bill creates the Training, Education, and Clinicals in Health (TEACH) Funding Program to offset lost revenue while clinical preceptors are mentoring medical, dental, nursing, and behavioral health students. The program seeks to increase the availability of clinical opportunities, improve the quality of the training sites, and promote the clinical training that prepares students for work as health care professionals.\n\nThe bill expands graduate medical education residency slots to increase the number of physicians in Florida.\n\nThe bill expands opportunities for experienced foreign-trained physicians to seek licensure in Florida.\n\nThe bill directs the Agency for Health Care Administration (AHCA) to seek federal approval to include hospital at home as a reimbursable service in Medicaid, so Floridians on Medicaid can receive hospital care at home, if appropriate.\n\nThe bill expands the Telehealth Minority Maternity Care Program statewide by expanding the capacity for positive maternal health outcomes. The program may enlist county health departments to assist with program implementation and requires annual reporting by the Department to the Governor and the Legislature on program effectiveness.\n\nAggregate data on the maternal and infant health outcomes of program participants. The bill enhances and expands mobile response teams to ensure coverage in every county.\n\nBehavioral Health Workforce\n\nEffective Date: April 14, 2016\n\nHouse Bill 977 (Full Text)\n\nSummary:\n\nDuring the 2016 Legislative Session, HB 977 passed and became law on April 14th as Chapter 2016-231, Laws of Florida. The bill expands the behavioral health workforce and recognizes the critical need for psychiatric care throughout the state.\n\nThe new law allows a Psychiatric Nurse, as defined in Section 394.455, Florida Statutes, and working within the framework of an established protocol with a Psychiatrist, to prescribe psychotropic controlled substances for the treatment of mental disorders. Grounds for discipline or denial of a license for Psychiatric Nurses are described in Section 8 of the law. Advanced Registered Nurse Practitioners are now authorized to seek certification as Psychiatric Nurses through the Board of Nursing. Existing ARNPs who hold this certification can add it to their license by writing the Board, along with a copy of the certification, at MQA.Nursing@FlHealth.gov. A revised protocol agreement with a supervising Psychiatrist will also be required unless the ARNP indicates he or she does not intend to prescribe controlled substances as indicated above. New applicants for ARNP certification will submit documentation as part of the initial licensure process.\n\nIn addition, the bill amends Chapter 893, Florida Statutes, by revising the term \"practitioner\" to include Psychiatric Nurses. The prescribing of medication on the premises of a pain-management clinic is still limited to a physician licensed under Chapter 458 or 459, Florida Statutes.\n\nAny health care practitioner wishing to prescribe controlled substances must apply for a registration number from the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA). Registration numbers are linked to state licenses and may be suspended or revoked upon any disciplinary action taken against a licensee. To apply for a registration number or for registration support, please visit the DEA Office of Diversion Control website at: http://www.deadiversion.usdoj.gov/index.html.\n\nAccess to Health Care Services\n\nEffective Date: April 14, 2016\n\n(certain sections become effective January 1, 2017)\n\nHouse Bill 423 (Full Text)\n\nSummary:\n\nBeginning January 1, 2017, Physician Assistants (PAs) and Advanced Registered Nurse Practitioners (ARNPs) can prescribe controlled substances listed in Schedule II, Schedule III or Schedule IV as defined in s. 893.03 Florida Statutes. An ARNP may only prescribe or dispense a controlled substance as defined in s. 893.03 Florida Statutes if the ARNP graduated from a program with a master’s or doctoral degree in a clinical nursing specialty area with training in specialized practitioner skills. However, all ARNPs and PAs are required to complete at least three hours of continuing education on the safe and effective prescribing of controlled substances. The bill further addresses Schedule II prescribing privileges for both ARNPs and PAs.\n\nControlled Substances Formulary Committee:\n\nIn accordance with HB 423, the Florida Board of Nursing has established a committee to recommend a formulary of controlled substances that an ARNP may or may not prescribe for specific uses or in limited quantities. The Controlled Substances Formulary Committee must consist of three ARNPs recommended by the Board of Nursing; three physicians recommended by the Board of Medicine who are licensed under chapter 458 or 459, Florida Statutes, and have experience with ARNPs; and a pharmacist licensed under chapter 465, Florida Statutes, who holds a Doctor of Pharmacy degree and is recommended by the Board of Pharmacy.\n\nAppointed members include:\n\nDoreen Cassarino, DNP, FNP-BC, BC-ADM, FAANP from Naples (who will serve as chair of the committee)\n\nVicky Stone-Gale, DNP, FNP-C, MSN from Plantation\n\nJim Quinlan, DNP, ARNP from Williston\n\nBernardo B. Fernandez, Jr., MD, MBA, FACP from Coral Gables\n\nJoshua D. Lenchus, DO, RPh, FACP, SFHM from Davie\n\nEduardo C. Oliveira, MD, MBA, FCCP from Orlando\n\nJeffrey Mesaros, PharmD, JD from Orlando\n\n\"I am confident in the committee members' ability to carefully analyze the important issues associated with implementing full prescriptive authority for ARNPs. The Board looks forward to receiving the committee's recommendations,\" stated Jody B. Newman, EdD, EdS, Board Chair.\n\nThe Board must adopt, by rule, the committee's initial recommendations no later than October 31, 2016.\n\nDepartment of Health\n\nEffective Date: July 1, 2022\n\nSB 768 (Full Text)\n\nSection 8: Designated Health Care Professionals – Information Required for Licensure\n\nThe bill requires health care professionals licensed under chapters 458, 459, 460, or 461, Florida Statutes, to provide specified information upon initial licensure or upon license renewal including the medical school attended and coursework completed; the name of each hospital where the applicant has privileges; the address of primary practice; any certification received from a specialty board; the year the applicant began practicing; any appointment to the faculty of a medical school; relevant professional qualifications; information regarding any criminal convictions; and any final disciplinary action. The bill requires submission of proof that applicants licensed under chapters 458, 459, or chapter 461, Florida Statutes, provide proof of payment of assessments to fund the Florida Birth-Related Neurological Injury Compensation Association required under section 766.314, Florida Statutes.\n\nSection 9: Chiropractic Medicine – Initial Licensure Requirements\n\nThe bill clarifies the minimum licensure requirements for chiropractic medicine. Due to recent changes in accreditation nomenclature at the U.S. Department of Education, all accreditation references in this section were changed from “regionally” to “institutionally” accredited college or university.\n\nSections 10 and 11: Nursing – Licensure by Examination\n\nThe bill removes the requirement for graduates from an approved program who have not taken the licensure examination within 6 months of graduation to complete a board-approved licensure examination preparatory course.\n\nSections 12-16: Midwifery\n\nThe bill clarifies the definitions for “approved midwifery program”, “preceptor”, and “prelicensure course”. The bill clarifies approved midwifery program education standards and clinical training requirements and aligns midwifery program approval standards with accreditation and licensing standards for direct entry midwifery programs. The bill also refines requirements for licensing midwives by examination and endorsement and clarifies requirements for temporary certification of midwives in areas of critical need and expanded access to midwifery care in areas of critical need by designating additional practice settings in conformance with other licensed health care professions.\n\nSection 17: Orthotists and Prosthetists\n\nThe bill clarifies the method for the collection and processing of applicant fingerprint records for the purpose of background screening. Due to recent changes in accreditation nomenclature at the U.S. Department of Education, all accreditation references in this section were changed from “regionally” to “institutionally” accredited college or university.\n\nSection 18: Clinical Laboratory Personnel\n\nDue to recent changes in accreditation nomenclature at the U.S. Department of Education, all accreditation references in this section were changed from “regionally” to “institutionally” accredited college or university.\n\nSections 19, 20, 21: Psychology\n\nThe bill clarifies the definitions and educational requirements for psychologists applying for licensure by examination or provisional licensure. The bill defines a “doctoral degree from an APA accredited program” as a Psy.D., an Ed.D. in psychology, or a Ph.D. in psychology from a psychology program at an educational institution that, at the time the applicant was enrolled and graduated had both an institutional accreditation from an agency recognized and approved by the U.S. Department of Education or was recognized as a member in good standing with the Association of Universities and Colleges of Canada, and had programmatic accreditation from the American Psychological Association (APA).\n\nThe bill further defines “doctoral degree in psychology” as a Psy.D., an Ed.D. in psychology, or a Ph.D. in psychology from a psychology program at an educational institution that, at the time the applicant was enrolled and graduated, had institutional accreditation from an agency recognized and approved by the U.S. Department of Education or was recognized as a member in good standing with the Association of Universities and Colleges of Canada. The bill requires psychologists applying for licensure to have obtained a doctoral degree from an APA accredited program or the equivalent of a degree from an APA-accredited program from a school or university located outside the United States which was officially recognized by the government of the country in which it is located as an institution or program to train students to practice professional psychology. Provisional licensure applicants must have earned a degree from an APA accredited program.\n\nSection 22: Clinical Social Work, Marriage & Family Therapy, and Mental Health Counseling\n\nThe bill clarifies the method for registration, payment of fees, and completion of the national examination. Due to recent changes in accreditation nomenclature at the U.S. Department of Education, all accreditation references in this section were changed from “regionally” to “institutionally” accredited college or university.\n\nThe bill creates three pathways to licensure for applicants for a marriage and family therapy license to meet the minimum educational requirements by one of the following methods:\n\nA minimum of a master’s degree from a Commission on Accreditation for Marriage and Family Therapy Education (COAMFTE);\n\nA minimum of a master’s degree with an emphasis in marriage and family therapy from a college or university that is accredited by the Council on Accreditation of Counseling and Related Educational Programs (CACREP); or\n\nA minimum of a master’s degree with an emphasis in marriage and family therapy or a closely related field, with a degree conferred before September 1, 2027, from an institutionally accredited college or university.\n\nThe bill also updates the education requirements for marriage and family therapists by correcting an obsolete reference to accreditation by Commission on Recognition of Postsecondary Accreditation (CORPA), which was dissolved in 1997. The bill replaces the CORPA with the CHEA or its successors.\n\nExisting statutory language requires that beginning July 1, 2025, mental health therapy licensure by examination applicants must graduate from a CACREP-accredited program. The bill adds the accrediting body, “Masters in Psychology and Counseling Accreditation Council,” or other equivalent accrediting body to the list of accepted programs.\n\nSections 24 and 25: Florida Birth-Related Neurological Injury Compensation Association (NICA)\n\nThe bill changes references from the “Department of Business and Professional Regulation” to the “Department of Health” as it relates to the payment of the Florida Birth-Related Neurological Injury Compensation by applicants and licensees. The bill makes the Florida Birth-Related Neurological Injury Compensation Association (“Association”) responsible for making all assessments required by the Florida Birth-Related Neurological Injury Compensation Plan except for initial assessments of physicians licensed by the Department of Health and certain casualty insurers. The bill modifies the frequency for the Department of Health to provide the Association electronic reports of all physicians licensed under Chapters 458 and 459, Florida Statutes, to monthly. The bill authorizes the Association to file suit in circuit court to collect assessments under certain circumstances and requires the Association to notify the Department of Health and the applicable board of any unpaid final judgments against a physician within seven days after the entry of a final judgment.\n\nReproductive Health\n\nEffective Date: July 1, 2020\n\nSenate Bill 698 (Full Text)\n\nSummary:\n\nThe bill requires the Department of Health (DOH), the Board of Medicine, or the Board of Osteopathic Medicine may take disciplinary action against the health care practitioner’s license if he or she intentionally transfers an embryo or reproductive material into a recipient without the recipient’s consent. Additionally, the DOH may issue an emergency order suspending the practitioner’s license if he or she is found guilty of committing the felony of reproductive battery, which is discussed below.\n\nThe bill also requires a health care practitioner, a medical student, or any other student who is receiving training as a health care practitioner to obtain the written consent of a patient or a patient’s representative before performing a pelvic exam. Written consent for the pelvic exam is not required if a court orders the exam to collect evidence or if the exam is necessary to avert a serious risk of irreversible impairment of a major bodily function of the patient.\n\nThe bill creates the crime of reproductive battery. It is a third-degree felony for a health care practitioner to intentionally transfer human reproductive material into the body of a recipient or implant a human embryo of a donor, knowing that the recipient has not consented to the use of the reproductive material or embryo from that donor. If the health care practitioner is the donor of the reproductive material, the penalty is increased to a second-degree felony.\n\nThe statute of limitations for prosecuting the crime of reproductive battery does not begin to run until the date that the violation is discovered and reported to a law enforcement agency or any other governmental agency. Additionally, it is not a defense to the crime that the recipient consented to the use of an anonymous donor.\n\nDirect Care Workers and Autonomous APRNs\n\nEffective Date: Upon Becoming a Law (March 11,2020) and July 1, 2020\n\nHB 607 (Full Text)\n\nSummary:\n\nThe Board of Nursing voted to initiate rulemaking on various aspects of HB 607 during its meetings on June 5, 2020. You can access the minutes of the full board and long-range policy planning discussions from the “meetings” link on the Board website.\n\nThe registration application for autonomous APRNs will be available after it has been adopted by rule, which is anticipated to take approximately 90 days. The Board voted to approve the application and move forward with rulemaking at its June 5th meeting. The Board also voted to define “primary care practice” to include “health promotion, disease prevention, health maintenance, counselling, patient education, and diagnosis and treatment of acute and chronic illnesses in a variety of healthcare settings”. This definition will also move through the rulemaking adoption process prior to becoming effective.\n\nThe Board determined that an equivalency to the required graduate level coursework required for registration would be 45 CE hours in each of the required subject areas. These hours must be offered by a Board-approved provider or a national organization empowered to accredit nursing CE. The courses must have been taken within the 5 years preceding the registration application. Submitted courses must have documentation of differential diagnosis and pharmacology in the course description and objectives.\n\nAppointments to the Council on APRN Autonomous Practice will be finalized by the end of June 2020 and then a meeting of the Council will be scheduled and announced. The Council is charged with developing “standards of practice” to recommend to the Board for adoption by rule.\n\nAdditional discussions on HB 607 will take place during the Board’s August 6-7, 2020, meeting.\n\nGovernor DeSantis signed HB 607 into law on March 11, 2020.\n\nSeparate portions of HB 607, now referred to as Chapter 2020-9, Laws of Florida, impact Board of Nursing licensees. Please see below for highlights of the new legislation:\n\nSections 12-14 – went into effect on 3/11/20\n\nAn authorized RN may delegate tasks to CNAs or home health aides if the RN determines that the CNA or home health aide is competent to perform these tasks, that the tasks are delegable under applicable Federal law, and the tasks meet certain criteria designated in the law. The RN is not authorized to delegate the administration of Schedule II-IV controlled substances. The Board is directed to adopt rules implementing the new law in consultation with the Agency for Health Care Administration (AHCA). We anticipate the rulemaking will commence following the Board’s June 2020 meeting.\n\nTraining coursework is required in order for a CNA to administer medication under an RN’s delegation. CNAs will also be required to have 2 hours of in-service training in medication administration and medical error prevention on a yearly basis.\n\nThe Board, along with AHCA, will also create standards and procedures for CNAs to follow when administering medication in a home health setting.\n\nSections 22-26 – go into effect on 7/1/20\n\nAPRNs will have an opportunity to register for autonomous practice, which will remove the requirement to provide patient care within the framework of an established protocol with a supervising physician or dentist. Registration eligibility requirements are established in the legislation and include: no discipline within 5 years of applying for the registration; completion of 3,000 clinical practice hours as an APRN under the supervision of physician within the 5 years immediately preceding the registration request; and, within the past 5 years, completion of graduate-level semester hours, or the equivalent, in differential diagnosis and pharmacology (3 hours in each subject). The registration application will be available after July 1, 2020.\n\nFinancial responsibility requirements are established in the new law for APRN autonomous practice. Practice requirements are also in the legislation and will be interpreted by the Board during its June 2020 meeting as part of the implementation of the bill.\n\nA Council on APRN Autonomous Practice is created within the Department of Health and will recommend standards of practice to the Board.\n\nAdditional continuing education (CE) requirements are put in place for autonomous practice. Ten hours of CE, approved by the Board, must be completed at each renewal in addition to completing the 30 hours of CE already in place, even if the APRN is exempt from existing CE requirements due to his or her national certification.\n\nAutonomous APRNs must also now report adverse incidents as outlined in the legislation and additional disciplinary actions are added to the Nurse Practice Act.\n\nUpdates on the implementation of this law will be added to the website.\n\nPractice of Pharmacy\n\nEffective Date: July 1, 2020\n\nHB 389 (Full Text)\n\nSummary:\n\nThe bill authorizes a pharmacist to enter into a collaborative pharmacy practice agreement (CPPA) with a physician to manage chronic health conditions if the pharmacist meets certain qualifications. A CPPA must meet certain terms and specify the health conditions, treatments, and tests governed by the CPPA. The bill prohibits a collaborating pharmacist from modifying or discontinuing any medication that is prescribed by a health care practitioner with whom he or she does not enter into a CPPA and from initiating or prescribing a controlled substance.\n\nThe bill authorizes a pharmacist, who meets certain qualifications, to test or screen for and treat minor, nonchronic health conditions within the framework of a written protocol with a supervising physician. The conditions are limited to influenza, streptococcus, lice, skin conditions, and minor, uncomplicated infections. The protocol must specify the patients that may be seen, instructions for obtaining a patient’s medical history, instructions for treatment, and a process and schedule for the pharmacist to provide patient information to the supervising physician and the supervising physician to review the pharmacist’s actions under the protocol.\n\nThe bill requires the Board of Pharmacy to adopt, by rule, a formulary of medicinal drugs that an authorized pharmacist may prescribe to treat minor, non-chronic health conditions. A pharmacist may not prescribe any controlled substance; however, the Board-developed formulary may include any non-controlled substance, including those that typically need a prescription to dispense, such as antibiotics, and over-the-counter medications. The bill authorizes a pharmacist to use certain laboratory or clinical tests, as well as any established screening procedures for which no test is available.\n\nA pharmacy in which a pharmacist provides services for minor, non-chronic health conditions must prominently display a sign advising a patient receiving such services to seek follow-up care from a physician. The Board of Pharmacy shall adopt guidelines for the circumstances under which the information required under this subsection shall be provided.\n\nProtection from Discrimination Based on Health Care Choices\n\nEffective Date: June 1, 2023, except as otherwise provided in the act.\n\nSB 252 (Bill Information)\n\nSummary:\n\nThe bill prohibits business entities and governmental entities from requiring a person to provide certain documentation or requiring a COVID-19 test to gain access to, entry upon, or service from such entities or as a condition of contracting, hiring, promotion, or continued employment; prohibiting business and governmental entities from refusing to hire persons, discharging persons, depriving or attempting to deprive persons of employment opportunities, adversely affecting persons with respect to employment, or otherwise discriminating against any person based on knowledge or belief of a person’s vaccination or COVID-19 post infection recovery status or failure to take a COVID-19 test. The bill requires such entities to provide exemptions and reasonable accommodations for religious and medical reasons.\n\nThe bill amends several statutes in order to prohibit mask mandates, mandates on emergency use authorizations (EUA) vaccinations, messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA) vaccinations, and COVID-19 vaccinations, and COVID-19 testing mandates in educational institutions, business entities, and governmental entities. The bill prohibits these entities and institutions from requiring proof of a vaccination with one of the specified types of vaccinations, post infection recovery from COVID-19, or a COVID-19 test to gain access to, entry upon, or service from the entity or institution. The bill also prohibits business and governmental entities from certain employment practices based on an employee’s, or a potential employee’s, vaccination or post infection status or the refusal to take a COVID-19 test.

The bill provides exceptions to these prohibitions for health care providers and practitioners, if the provider or practitioner meets specific requirements established by the bill, and for when a mask or facial covering is required safety equipment. Business entities and governmental entities that violate these provisions are subject to discipline by the Florida Department of Legal Affairs (DLA) while educational institutions are subject to discipline by the Florida Department of Health (DOH). Such discipline may include fines of up to $5,000 for each violation.\n\nThe bill establishes requirements for mandating masks in health care settings.

The bill provides legislative intent and provides that a health care provider or payor has the right to optout of participation in or payment for a health care service on the basis of a conscience-based objection (CBO). The bill establishes notification requirements for opting-out and prohibits a payor from opting-out of paying for a service it is contractually obligated to cover during a plan year. The bill also specifies that CBOs are limited to specific health care services, that the bill may not be construed to waive or modify any duty a provider or payor may have for other health care services that do not violate a provider’s or payor’s conscience, and that nothing in the bill allows a health care provider or payor to opt-out of providing health care services to any patient or potential patient because of that patient’s or potential patient’s race, color, religion, sex, or national origin.\n\nThe bill prohibits health care providers from being discriminated against or suffering adverse action for declining to participate in a health care service based on a CBO. The bill also provides whistle-blower protections for providers or payors in specific situations and specifies that the bill may not be construed to override any requirement to provide emergency medical treatment in accordance with federal or state law.\n\nThe bill allows health care providers or payors to file complaints of violations to the Attorney General (AG) and authorizes the AG to bring a civil action for appropriate relief. The bill also provides civil immunity for health care providers and payors solely for declining to participate in a health care service on the basis of a conscience-based objection, with some exceptions.\n\nAdditionally, the bill prohibits a board, or the Florida Department of Health (DOH) if there is no board, from taking disciplinary action against a health care practitioner solely because he or she has spoken or written publicly about a health care service or public policy, including on a social media platform, as long as the speech or written communication does not provide advice or treatment to a specific patient or patients and does not separately violate any other applicable law or rule. The bill also authorizes a board within the DOH to revoke approval of any specialty board for revoking the certification of an individual for the same reason.\n\nContent provided by the Florida Department of Health presented herein is for informational purposes only.
