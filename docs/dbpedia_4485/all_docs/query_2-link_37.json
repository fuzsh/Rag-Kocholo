        "text": "Ovarian cysts are very common. Often painless and symptomless, they are usually just a sign of ovulation. In some cases, they can point to an underlying condition and may need to be removed.\n\nThe ovaries are part of the female reproductive system. There are two ovaries, and they’re located in the lower abdomen on both sides of the uterus. The ovaries produce egg, as well as the hormones estrogen and progesterone.\n\nRead on to learn more about the types of ovarian cysts, what causes them, when they may need treatment, how they can be prevented, and more.\n\nThe terms “male” and “female”\n\nIn this article, we use “male and female” to refer to someone’s sex as determined by their chromosomes and “men and women” when referring to their gender (unless quoting from sources using nonspecific language).\n\nChromosomes determine sex, and gender is a social construct that can vary between periods and cultures. Both of these aspects are acknowledged to exist on a spectrum both historically and by modern scientific consensus.\n\nThere are various ovarian cysts, such as dermoid cysts and endometriomas (also called chocolate cysts).\n\nHowever, the most common type is cysts filled with fluid formed during the menstrual cycle.\n\nThese are follicular cysts and corpus luteum cysts.\n\nFollicular cysts\n\nDuring the menstrual cycle, an egg grows in a follicle sac. This sac is located inside the ovaries.\n\nIn most cases, the follicle breaks open and releases an egg. If the follicle doesn’t break open, the fluid inside the follicle can form a cyst on the ovary.\n\nLearn more about follicular cysts.\n\nCorpus luteum cysts\n\nThe corpus luteum is a benign structure that appears in an ovary after an egg is released. It’s job is to release hormones needed for pregnancy. However, it will break down after a few days unless a pregnancy starts.\n\nIn some cases, it may not dissolve. Instead, additional fluid develops inside it, resulting in a cyst.\n\nOther types\n\nOvarian cysts that aren’t formed as part of a typical menstrual cycle include:\n\nDermoid cysts: These sac-like growths on the ovaries can contain hair, fat, and other tissue.\n\nEndometriomas: Tissues that normally grow inside the uterus can develop outside the uterus and attach to the ovaries. These are also colloquially called chocolate cysts, and may affect people with severe endometriosis.\n\nCystadenomas: These growths can develop on the outer surface of the ovaries.\n\nSome people develop a condition called polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), in which the ovaries form many small cysts. PCOS can cause the ovaries to enlarge. If left untreated, polycystic ovaries can result in infertility.\n\nOften times, ovarian cysts don’t cause any symptoms. However, symptoms can appear if the cyst grows. Symptoms may include:\n\nabdominal bloating or swelling\n\npainful bowel movements\n\npelvic pain before or during the menstrual cycle\n\npainful intercourse\n\npain in the lower back or thighs\n\nbreast tenderness\n\nnausea and vomiting\n\nHow do you know if an ovarian cyst has burst?\n\nSevere symptoms can indicate an ovarian torsion or a ruptured cyst. These include:\n\nsevere or sharp pelvic pain\n\nfever\n\nfaintness or dizziness\n\nrapid breathing\n\nBoth complications are rare, but can have serious consequences if not treated early.\n\nA doctor may detect an ovarian cyst during a routine pelvic exam. They may notice swelling on one of your ovaries and order an ultrasound to confirm the presence of a cyst.\n\nAn ultrasound is an imaging test that uses high-frequency sound waves to produce an image of your internal organs. Ultrasound tests help determine the size, location, shape, and composition (solid or fluid-filled) of a cyst.\n\nOther imaging tools that may be used to diagnose ovarian cysts include:\n\nCT scan: A CT scan uses a body imaging device to create cross-sectional images of internal organs.\n\nMRI: An MRI uses magnetic fields to produce in-depth images of internal organs.\n\nBecause most cysts disappear after a few weeks or months, the doctor may not immediately recommend a treatment plan.\n\nInstead, they may repeat the ultrasound test in a few weeks or months to check your condition. In certain cases, no further monitoring will be needed, especially if you previously had a follicular cyst or corpus luteum cyst.\n\nIf there aren’t any improvements to your condition or the cyst increases in size, the doctor may request additional tests to determine other causes of your symptoms.\n\nThese may include a pregnancy test or hormone level tests. The hormone level test helps check for hormone-related issues, such as having too much estrogen or progesterone.\n\nIf you don’t already have a obgyn, you can browse doctors in your area through the Healthline FindCare tool.\n\nMost ovarian cysts are benign and naturally go away on their own without treatment. These cysts cause little, if any, symptoms. Home remedies like heat therapy can help ease any symptoms you do have.\n\nThat said, if treatment is necessary, the kind of treatment will depend on the type of the cyst. Some larger cysts, endometromas, or cancerous cysts usually need to be removed surgically.\n\nOptions for surgery include:\n\nLaparoscopy: A doctor performs a laparoscopy by making several tiny incisions near your navel and inserting a small instrument into your abdomen to remove the cyst.\n\nLaparotomy: In this procedure, a doctor can surgically remove the cyst through a large incision in your abdomen. This is known as laparotomy. They can then do a biopsy if they are concerned about cancer.\n\nIn a rare case, a doctor may detect a cancerous cystic ovarian mass during a routine examination.\n\nOvarian torsion is another rare complication of ovarian cysts. It occurs when a large cyst causes an ovary to twist or move from its original position. Blood supply to the ovary is cut off. If not treated, ovarian torsion can cause damage or death to the ovarian tissue.\n\nRuptured cysts rarely cause intense pain and internal bleeding. This complication increases your risk of an infection and can be life threatening if left untreated.\n\nIf you have recurring ovarian cysts, a doctor can prescribe oral contraceptives to stop ovulation and prevent the development of new cysts.\n\nOral contraceptives can also help reduce your risk of ovarian cancer. The risk of ovarian cancer is higher in postmenopausal females.\n\nIn addition, in a study on rats, researchers found that combining supplements of the antioxidant resveratrol and the diabetes medication metformin may help support healthy weight and hormone levels, as well as an optimized follicular cell structure within the ovaries. This may help prevent cyst formation.\n\nRoutine gynecologic examinations can also help a doctor detect ovarian cysts early.\n\nAlert a doctor to symptoms that may indicate a problem, such as:\n\nchanges to your menstrual cycle\n\nongoing pelvic pain\n\nloss of appetite\n\nunexplained weight loss\n\nabdominal fullness\n\nBenign ovarian cysts rarely become cancerous. However, symptoms of ovarian cancer can mimic symptoms of an ovarian cyst. Thus, it’s important to visit a doctor and receive a correct diagnosis.\n\nThe outlook for premenopausal people with ovarian cysts is good. Most cysts disappear within a few months. However, premenopausal people and people with hormone imbalances such as PCOS can also experience recurring ovarian cysts.\n\nIf left untreated, some cysts can decrease fertility. This really depends on the type of cyst. Ovulatory cysts indicate regular menstrual cycles, but endometriomas suggest endometriosis, which can harm fertility. Dermoid cysts can cause pain and make sexual intercourse more painful, affecting conception.\n\nTo improve fertility, a doctor can remove or shrink the cyst. However, laproscipic removal of some types of cysts could also negatively impact your fertility.\n\nDepending on cyst size and type, a “wait and see” approach may be appropriate with ovarian cysts.\n\nA doctor may recommend surgery to remove and examine any cyst or growth that develops on the ovaries after menopause. This is because the chance of developing a cancerous cyst or ovarian cancer increases after menopause. However, ovarian cysts don’t increase the chance of getting ovarian cancer.\n\nRead the article in Spanish."
