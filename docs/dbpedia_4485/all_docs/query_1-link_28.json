eloquent\n\nWith my words\n\nAnd linguistics that I abuse\n\nMC's wanna bite\n\nBut still got on\n\nSome loose baby tooth\n\nMy rhymes so hot\n\nWe got fire blankets\n\nIn the vocal booth\n\nProducers with extinguishers\n\nTo put out the blaze\n\nWhen I'm on the loose\n\nI'm rolling with the best\n\nMeeting of the minds\n\nNot a contest\n\nEvoking MC's around the globe\n\nWith finesse and skills God blessed\n\nFrom KL\n\nBut a hungry MC\n\nLike I was from Budapest\n\nToo Phat to go on diet\n\nToe to toe with Joe is ludicrous\n\nDon't fool with this\n\nYou know we fly\n\nLike a stewardess\n\nImpressing pure hip-hop purists\n\nIn every single metropolis\n\nDon't step to this listen\n\nRubbish we don't utter\n\nGot to stop the hating\n\nUnite us and start working together\n\nSo keep it butter\n\nWe'll kick it hotter\n\nThan your average MC\n\nThey'll flee\n\nWe'll make 'em stutter\n\nC'monÃƒÂ¢Ã¢Â,Â¬Ã,Â¦\n\nChorus\n\nFrom sea to sea\n\nCountry to country\n\n6
