I'm makin a decent livin' I ain't slangin' or thuggin' At first I didn't understannd though I was man enough Frontin' like I'm to tough to be sharing love Used to take em for granted, including my two little brothers Treat my home like a hotel and ignoring my mother But now I realised that I can't live without em Take away my money, honeys aiyo even the stardom But can never take away my love for my blood (whut) My big brother Farez doin' sit ups to loose his gut Iman wanna emcee and spin records at the same time While Ash wana be a rockstar, you doin fine Keep ya head up all the time know I'm feelin for you And always keep it real whatever ya'll do...ONE LOVE Chorus 2x You are my sunshine, you are my rainbow After the rain has gone Verse 2 (Malique) I spread love to all my peeps that help me make it happen Ain't talkin' 'bout the fools I knew after I started rappin' I'm talkin''bout the folks from back then when I was wack Friends and fam that kept me steady laugh when I was steady slackin' Y'all usta call me a different name, and yo it's still the same Ain't nothing changed, y'all never took advantage of my fame I got y'all free tickets to shows, y'all never asked for it But still y'all pay and stand in backrows and see me mash for it Mom and dad y'all still cuttin' those paper interviews Don't see you daily but trust me daily I think of you I know I promised to be a lawyer in a court suin' I'm sorry now but thanks for bein' proud of what I'm doin' It's impossible to spit love in 16 bars So imma cut this short just to let you know who you are Mom and dad, bro, sis and Tim, just know I love you Wish y'all were here so I could just breakdown while I hug you, ONE. Chorus\n\nStruggling with You? Become a better singer in 30 days with these videos!"
