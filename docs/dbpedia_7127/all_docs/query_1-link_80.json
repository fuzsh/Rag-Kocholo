B.\n\n2003-12-01\n\nDomestic combustion of coal for heating and cooking is mostly confined to the world's developing countries and probably involves about 1 billion persons in China, India, Indonesia, and Africa. Various endemic diseases affecting millions of people involving arsenic, selenium, and fluorine poisoning have been associated with domestic coal combustion in rural China. We have investigated the relationship between mineralized coals (and stone coals) and disease occurrences in Guizhou and Hubei Provinces. The mineralogy of the coals has been studied by a wide variety of techniques, including optical petrography, scanning electron microscopy, electron microprobe analysis, ion probe, Synchrotron XANES-EXAFS, and Raman spectroscopy. Arsenic enrichment (up to 3 weight percent) in Upper Permian Longtan Formation coals, southwestern Guizhou Province, occurs in both 3+ and 5+ valence states. Arsenic occurs in arsenopyrite, pyrite, Al-phosphate, scorodite, Fe-oxides, and as an organically-bound species. Fluorine poisoning, much more widespread than arsenic-poisoning, is related to burning F-rich coals and F-rich clays as admixtures. Mineralogical and chemical analysis suggests that the clays contain the fluorine probably substituting for the hydroxyl group. Localized selenium poisoning in Hubei Province is related to Se-rich stone coals. The selenium occurs as a native element and in rare mandarinoite. In these three cases, knowledge of the paragenesis and mineralogy of the element enrichment in coal was vital to help understand and mitigate the endemic diseases. For the situation concerning arsenic and selenium poisoning, suspect coals have been identified and mining from these deposits has been curtailed. Fluorine has been a much more difficult problem for the local public health officials as both the coal and clay in the burning admixture can contain high fluorine. Regional geochemical and mineralogical studies will help to define coal and clay with low fluorine, suitable for\n\nCathodoluminescence Petrography: A Valuable Tool for Teaching and Research.\n\nERIC Educational Resources Information Center\n\nKopp, Otto C.\n\n1981-01-01\n\nCathodoluminescence is visible light emitted from a specimen when it is bombarded with electrons. A technique known as cathodoluminescence petrography can provide information especially useful in studies or courses related to mineralogy and petrology. The technique is briefly presented, along with examples to illustrate typical results.

P.; Snead, C.; Rahman, Z.; McKeegan, K. D.\n\n2012-01-01\n\nHibonite-rich Ca- and Al-rich inclusions (CAIs) are among the earliest formed solids that condensed in the early nebula. We discovered an unusual refractory inclusion from the Allende CV3 chondrite (SHAL) containing an approx 500 micron long single crystal of hibonite and co-existing coarse-grained perovskite. The mineralogy and petrography of SHAL show strong similarities to some FUN inclusions, especially HAL. Here we report on the mineralogy, petrography, mineral chemistry and oxygen isotopic compositions in SHAL.\n\nMineralogy, mineral chemistry, and paragenesis of gold, silver, and base-metal ores of the North Amethyst vein system, San Juan Mountains, Mineral County, Colorado\n\nUSGS Publications Warehouse\n\nFoley, Nora K.; Caddey, Stanton W.; Byington, Craig B.; Vardiman, David M.\n\n1993-01-01\n\nMineralogic, lead-isotopic, and fluid-inclusion characteristics of the younger association are similar to those of ores of the southern and central parts of the Creede mining district. In contrast, the gold and manganese-silicate assemblages of the older association are rare to absent in the southern and central parts of the district. The local and early occurrence of the manganese and gold assemblages may indicate that they formed in a small hydrothermal cell that predated the extensive hydrothermal system from which ores of the central and southern parts of the Creede district are proposed to have been deposited (Bethke, 1988). If similar early-stage cells were present in the southern and central parts of the district, they may have been replaced or overprinted by later assemblages, and they may remain to be discovered. In the latter case, mineral assemblages that formed at early stages in the paragenesis hold the most promise for gold exploration.\n\nParagenesis and Geochronology of the Nopal I Uranium Deposit, Mexico\n\nDOE Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI.GOV)\n\nM. Fayek; M. Ren\n\n2007-02-14\n\nUranium deposits can, by analogy, provide important information on the long-term performance of radioactive waste forms and radioactive waste repositories. Their complex mineralogy and variable elemental and isotopic compositions can provide important information, provided that analyses are obtained on the scale of several micrometers. Here, we present a structural model of the Nopal I deposit as well as petrography at the nanoscale coupled with preliminary U-Th-Pb ages and O isotopic compositions of uranium-rich minerals obtained by Secondary Ion Mass Spectrometry (SIMS). This multi-technique approach promises to provide ''natural system'' data on the corrosion rate of uraninite, the natural analogue ofmoreÂ Â» spent nuclear fuel.Â«Â less\n\nPetrography, mineralogy, and geochemistry of lunar meteorite Sayh al Uhaymir 300\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nHsu, Weibiao; Zhang, Aicheng; Bartoschewitz, Rainer; Guan, Yunbin; Ushikubo, Takayuki; KrÅHenbÃHl, Urs; Niedergesaess, Rainer; Pepelnik, Rudolf; Reus, Ulrich; Kurtz, Thomas; Kurtz, Paul\n\n2008-08-01\n\nWe report here the petrography, mineralogy, and geochemistry of lunar meteorite Sayh al Uhaymir 300 (SaU 300). SaU 300 is dominated by a fine-grained crystalline matrix surrounding mineral fragments (plagioclase, pyroxene, olivine, and ilmenite) and lithic clasts (mainly feldspathic to noritic). Mare basalt and KREEPy rocks are absent. Glass melt veins and impact melts are present, indicating that the rock has been subjected to a second impact event. FeNi metal and troilite grains were observed in the matrix. Major element concentrations of SaU 300 (Al2O3 21.6 wt% and FeO 8.16 wt%) are very similar to those of two basalt-bearing feldspathic regolith breccias: Calcalong Creek and Yamato (Y-) 983885. However, the rare earth element (REE) abundances and pattern of SaU 300 resemble the patterns of feldspathic highlands meteorites (e.g., Queen Alexandra Range (QUE) 93069 and Dar al Gani (DaG) 400), and the average lunar highlands crust. It has a relatively LREE-enriched (7 to 10 x CI) pattern with a positive Eu anomaly (Ë11 x CI). Values of Fe/Mn ratios of olivine, pyroxene, and the bulk sample are essentially consistent with a lunar origin. SaU 300 also contains high siderophile abundances with a chondritic Ni/Ir ratio. SaU 300 has experienced moderate terrestrial weathering as its bulk Sr concentration is elevated compared to other lunar meteorites and Apollo and Luna samples. Mineral chemistry and trace element abundances of SaU 300 fall within the ranges of lunar feldspathic meteorites and FAN rocks. SaU 300 is a feldspathic impact-melt breccia predominantly composed of feldspathic highlands rocks with a small amount of mafic component. With a bulk Mg# of 0.67, it is the most mafic of the feldspathic meteorites and represents a lunar surface composition distinct from any other known lunar meteorites. On the basis of its low Th concentration (0.46 ppm) and its lack of KREEPy and mare basaltic components, the source region of SaU 300 could have been within a highland\n\nRelationships between electrical properties and petrography of El-Maghara sandstone formations, Egypt\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nKassab, Mohamed A.; Gomaa, Mohamed M.; Lala, Amir M. S.\n\n2017-06-01\n\nRealization of electrical and petrography of rocks is absolutely necessary for geophysical investigations. The petrographical, petrophysical and electrical properties of sandstone rocks (El-Maghara Formation, North Sinai, Egypt) will be discussed in the present work. The goal of this paper was to highlight interrelations between electrical properties in terms of frequency (conductivity, permittivity and impedance) and petrography, as well as mineral composition. Electrical properties including (conductivity and dielectric constant) were measured at room temperature and humidity of (â¼35%). The frequency range used will be from 10 Hz to 100 kHz. Slight changes between samples in electrical properties were found to result from changes in composition and texture. Electrical properties generally change with grain size, shape, sorting, mineralogy and mineral composition. The dielectric constant decreases with frequency and increases with increasing clay content. The conductivity increases with the increase in conductor channels among electrodes. Many parameters can combine together to lead to the same electrical properties. The samples are mainly composed of sand with clay and carbonate.\n\nMineralogy and Microstructures of Shock-Induced Melt Veins in Chondrites\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nSharp, Thomas G.\n\n2000-01-01\n\nThe applicability of phase equilibrium data to the interpretation of shock-induced melt veins can only be tested by a detailed study of melt- vein mineralogy to see how high-pressure assemblages vary as a function of shock conditions inferred from other indicators. We have used transmission electron microscopy (TEM), analytical electron microscopy (AEM), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), electron microprobe analysis (EMA) and optical petrography to characterize the mineralogy, microstructures, and compositions of melt veins and associated high-pressure minerals in shocked chondrites and SNC meteorites. In the processes, we have gained a better understanding of what melt veining can tell us about shock conditions and we have discovered new mineral phases in chondritic and SNC meteorites.\n\nMineralogy, paragenesis, and mineral zoning of the Bulldog Mountain vein system, Creede District, Colorado\n\nUSGS Publications Warehouse\n\nPlumlee, Geoffrey S.; Heald Whitehouse-Veaux, Pamela\n\n1994-01-01\n\nThe Bulldog Mountain vein system, Creede district, Colorado, is one of four major epithermal vein systems from which the bulk of the district's historical Ag-Pb-Zn-Cu production has come. Ores deposited along the vein system were discovered in 1965 and were mined from 1969 to 1985.Six temporally gradational mineralization stages have been identified along the Bulldog Mountain vein system, each with a characteristic suite of minerals deposited or leached and a characteristic distribution within the vein system; some of these stages are also strongly zoned within the vein system. Stage A was dominated by deposition of rhodochrosite along the lower levels of the Bulldog Mountain ore zone. Stage B in the northern parts of the ore zone is characterized by abundant fine-grained sphalerite and galena, with lesser tetrahedrite and minor chlorite and hematite. With increasing elevation to the south, stage B ores become progressively more barite and silver rich, with alternating barite and fine-grained sphalerite + galena generations; native silver + or - acanthite assemblages are also locally abundant within southern stage B barite sulfide ores, whereas chalcopyrite and other Cu and Ag sulfides and sulfosalts are present erratically in minor amounts. Stage C in the upper and northern portions of the ore zone is characterized by abundant quartz and fluorite, minor adularia, hematite, Mn siderite, sphalerite, and galena, and major leaching of earlier barite; to the south, some barite and sulfides may have been deposited. Stage D sphalerite and galena were deposited in the upper and northern portions of the ore zone; a barite- and silver-rich facies of this stage may also be present in the southern portions of the vein system. Late in stage D, mineralogically complex assemblages containing chalcopyrite, tetrahedrite, polybasite, bornite, pyrargyrite, and a variety of other sulfides and sulfosalts were deposited in modest amounts throughout the vein system. This complex\n\nMINERALOGY, PETROGRAPHY, AND RADIOACTIVITY OF REPRESENTATIVE SAMPLES OF CHATTANOOGA SHALE\n\nDOE Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI.GOV)\n\nBates, T.F.; Strahl, E.O.\n\n1957-01-01\n\nQualitative and quantitative mineralogical studies of the Chattanooga Shale are in progress. Problems of separation and analysis of mineral and organic components are difficult because the rock is fine-grained. However, the applicaiion of light and electron microscopy, x-ray diffraction, nuclear-track study, and other methods has provided data of interest. Megascopically, the shalc is a massive chocolate-brown sediment which displays faint indications of lamination. Some pyrite lenses, nodules, and crystals and a few mica flakes are large enough to be seen with a hand lens. In thin section the rock is seen to consist of grains of quartz and feldspar inmoreÂ Â» a matrix of yellow to red--brown organic material, which incorporates shreds of mica and probably clay particles and is dotted by small clusters of pyrite. Larger organic fragments with associated pyrite are common and take various forms. Individual mineral particles range from pyrite cubes less than 0.15 micron on a side to quartz and feldspar grains as large as 0.10 mm. X-ray studies show the clay minerals to be illite, kaolinite, and chlorite in decreasing order of abundance. Tourmaline, zircon, and apatite are the characteristic heavy minerals of the sediment. Quantitative studies, accomplished by a combination of chemical and mineralogical methods, have shown the composition of a batch sample of this rock to be approxiinately: 22% quartz, 9% feldspar, 31% illite and kaolinite, 22% organic matter, 11% pyrite and marcasite, 2% chlorite, 2% iron oxides, and l% tourmaline, zircon, and apatite. Alphatrack studies of cniulsion-covered thin sections indicate that no uranium mineral is present. Approximately 70% of the uranium atoms is randomly distributed throughout the finegrained matrix of the rock, whereas another 25% is concentrated in organic-pyrite-clay complexes such as pyrite nodules and discrete organic bodies. In unweathered samples there is no relationship between uranium distribution and textural\n\nMineralogy and petrography of HAL, an isotopically-unusual Allende inclusion\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nAllen, J. M.; Grossman, L.; Lee, T.; Wasserburg, G. J.\n\n1980-01-01\n\nResults of a detailed mineralogical and textural study of the HAL (Hibonite ALlende) inclusion of the Allende meteorite, which has been found to exhibit no Mg-26 excesses despite very high Al-27/Mg-24 ratios and large fractionation effects with small nuclear effects in its Ca, are reported. The inclusion is found to consist of three up to 1-mm diameter hibonite crystals partially surrounded by a black rim resembling a devitrified glass and containing an anisotropic Al-Fe oxide, which is in turn surrounded by a 2-mm thick friable rim sequence consisting of five layers distinguishable by mineral composition. From the available evidence, it is concluded that each of the layers of the friable rim formed by the accretion of an assemblage of condensate grains rather than by the complete reaction of a HAL precursor with a nebular gas, thus explaining its unusual isotopic characteristics and supporting the conclusion that the solar nebular contained isotopically-distinct reservoirs.\n\nParagenesis of Cr-rich muscovite and chlorite in green-mica quartzites of Saigaon-Palasgaon area, Western Bastar Craton, India\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nRandive, K. R.; Korakoppa, M. M.; Muley, S. V.; Varade, A. M.; Khandare, H. W.; Lanjewar, S. G.; Tiwari, R. R.; Aradhi, K. K.\n\n2015-02-01\n\nGreen mica (fuchsite or chromian-muscovite) is reported worldwide in the Archaean metasedimentary rocks, especially quartzites. They are generally associated with a suite of heavy minerals and a range of phyllosilicates. We report the occurrence of green-mica quartzites in the Saigaon-Palasgaon area within Bastar Craton in central India. Mineralogical study has shown that there are two types of muscovites; the chromium-containing muscovite (Cr2O3 0.84-1.84%) and muscovite (Cr2O3 0.00-0.22%). Chlorites are chromium-containing chlorites (Cr2O3 3.66-5.39%) and low-chromium-containing chlorites (Cr2O3 0.56-2.62%), and as such represent ripidolite-brunsvigite varieties. Back scattered electron images and EPMA data has revealed that chlorite occurs in two forms, viz., parallel to subparallel stacks in the form of intergrowth with muscovite and independent crystals within the matrix. The present study indicates that the replacement of chromium-containing chlorite by chromium-containing muscovite is found to be due to increasing grade of metamorphism of chromium-rich sediments. However, the absence of significant compositional gap between aforementioned varieties indicates disparate substitution of cations, especially chromium, within matrix chlorites. The chromium-containing muscovite and muscovite are two separate varieties having distinct paragenesis.\n\nSystematic variations in sinter mineralogy, microtexture and diagenesis in modern siliceous hot springs: Clues for interpreting depositional conditions in ancient deposits\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nMills, V. W.; Farmer, J. D.; Ruff, S. W.; Nunez, J.; Jahnke, L. L.\n\n2011-12-01\n\nThe deposits of siliceous hydrothermal springs are known to capture and preserve a wide range of microbial fossil information. The recent discovery of hydrothermal silica at Home Plate, Columbia Hills, Mars has once again raised interest in the potential importance of ancient spring sinters as targets for future astrobiological mission to Mars. To create additional context information to support future in situ missions to Mars, we have documented systematic changes in the mineralogy and microtexture of modern siliceous hot spring deposits, observed along gradients in temperature, pH and flow velocity. Specific objectives are to: 1) identify chemical and physical factors that promote early diagenetic transformations of amorphous silica (opal-A), to progressively more ordered and crystalline phases (cristobalite, tridymite and quartz); 2) determine the composition and abundance of minor mineral phases, especially clays, in relationship to pH, temperature and paragenesis; and 3) to assess the usefulness of sinter mineralogy and microtexture in reconstructing the paleoenvironmental records preserved in ancient deposits. Study sites for acidic (pH 2-5) sinters included Nymph Creek, located in the Norris Geyser Basin of Yellowstone National Park (YNP). Active alkaline (pH 7-10) springs included Rabbit Creek, Steep Cone and Mound Spring located in the Lower Geyser Basin, YNP. Field measurements in active springs included pH, temperature and flow velocity, along with general microfacies assignments. To better constrain types and rates of silica diagenesis, the study also sampled older (Holocene-Pleistocene-aged) deposits. Laboratory analyses included X-ray powder diffraction (XRPD), thermal infrared spectroscopy (TIR) and thin section petrography for characterizing sinter microtextures and for placing mineral phases (identified by XRPD and TIR) into a time-ordered diagenetic framework. In analyzing the phyllosilicates present in sinters, we applied clay separation and\n\nMineralogy and petrography of C asteroid regolith: The Sutter's Mill CM meteorite\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nZolensky, Michael; Mikouchi, Takashi; Fries, Marc; Bodnar, Robert; Jenniskens, Peter; Yin, Qing-zhu; Hagiya, Kenji; Ohsumi, Kazumasa; Komatsu, Mutsumi; Colbert, Matthew; Hanna, Romy; Maisano, Jessie; Ketcham, Richard; Kebukawa, Yoko; Nakamura, Tomoki; Matsuoka, Moe; Sasaki, Sho; Tsuchiyama, Akira; Gounelle, Matthieu; Le, Loan; Martinez, James; Ross, Kent; Rahman, Zia\n\n2014-11-01\n\nBased upon our characterization of three separate stones by electron and X-ray beam analyses, computed X-ray microtomography, Raman microspectrometry, and visible-IR spectrometry, Sutter's Mill is a unique regolith breccia consisting mainly of various CM lithologies. Most samples resemble existing available CM2 chondrites, consisting of chondrules and calcium-aluminum-rich inclusion (CAI) set within phyllosilicate-dominated matrix (mainly serpentine), pyrrhotite, pentlandite, tochilinite, and variable amounts of Ca-Mg-Fe carbonates. Some lithologies have witnessed sufficient thermal metamorphism to transform phyllosilicates into fine-grained olivine, tochilinite into troilite, and destroy carbonates. One finely comminuted lithology contains xenolithic materials (enstatite, Fe-Cr phosphides) suggesting impact of a reduced asteroid (E or M class) onto the main Sutter's Mill parent asteroid, which was probably a C class asteroid. One can use Sutter's Mill to help predict what will be found on the surfaces of C class asteroids such as Ceres and the target asteroids of the OSIRIS-REx and Hayabusa 2 sample return missions (which will visit predominantly primitive asteroids). C class asteroid regolith may well contain a mixture of hydrated and thermally dehydrated indigenous materials as well as a significant admixture of exogenous material would be essential to the successful interpretation of mineralogical and bulk compositional data.\n\nModeling Paragenesis: Erosion Opposite to Gravity in Cave Channels\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nCooper, M. P.; Covington, M. D.\n\n2017-12-01\n\nSediment plays an important role in bedrock channels, providing both tools and cover that influence patterns of bed erosion. It has also been shown that sediment load influences bedrock channel width, with increased sediment leading to wider channels. A variety of models have been developed to explore these effects. In caves, it is hypothesized that sediments covering the floors of fully flooded channels that are forming beneath the water table (phreatic zone) can force dissolution upwards towards the water table, leading to upward erosion balanced by gradual deposition of sediment within the channel bottom. This strange process is termed paragenesis, and while there are conceptual and experimental models of the process, no prior mathematical models of cave passage evolution has captured these effects. Consequently, there is little quantitative understanding of the processes that drive paragenesis and how they link to the morphology of the cave channels that develop. We adapt a previously developed algorithm for estimating boundary shear stress within channels with free-surface flows to enable calculation of boundary shear stress in pipe-full conditions. This model successfully duplicates scaling relationships in surface channels, and geometries of caves formed in the phreatic zone such as phreatic tubes. Once sediment flux is incorporated the model successfully duplicates the hypothesized processes of paragenetic gallery formation: the cover effect prevents dissolution in the direction of gravity; passages are enlarged upwards reducing the sediment transport capacity; sediment is deposited and the process drives a continuing feedback loop. Simulations reveal that equilibrium paragenetic channel widths scale with both sediment flux and discharge. Unlike in open channel settings, increased sediment load actually narrows paragenetic channels. The cross section evolution model also reveals that the existence of equilibrium widths in such galleries requires erosion to\n\nMineralogy of the Almahata Sitta Ureilite\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nZolensky, Michael E.; Herrin, J.; Friedrich, J. M.; Rumble, D.; Steele, A.; Jenniskens, P.; Shaddad, M. H.; Le, L.; Robinson, G. A.\n\n2009-01-01\n\nMineralogy & Petrography: Almahata Sitta, deriving from the asteroid 2008 TC3, is a coarse-grained- to porous, fine-grained, fragmental breccia with subrounded mineral fragments and olivine aggregates embedded in a cataclastic matrix of ureilitic material. Mineral fragments include polycrystalline olivine, low-calcium, pigeonite, and augite. Abundant carbonaceous aggregates containing graphite, microdiamonds and aliphatics. Kamacite, Cr-rich troilite, silica and schreibersite are abundant. The compositional range of the silicates is characteristic of the ureilites as a group, but unusually broad for an individual ureilite. The dense lithology is typical for ureilites, but the porous lithology is anomalous. In the porous lithology pore walls are largely coated by crystals of olivine. Classification: Almahata Sitta is an anomalous, polymict eucrite. Anomalous features include large compositional range of silicates, high abundance and large size of pores, crystalline pore wall linings, and fine-grained texture. Tomography reveals that the pores define thin, discontinuous \"sheets\" connected in three dimensions, suggesting that they outline grains that have been incompletely welded together. The crystals lining the pore walls are probably vapor phase deposits. Therefore Almahata Sitta may represent an agglomeration of coarse- to fine-grained, incompletely reduced pellets formed during impact, and subsequently welded together at high temperature.\n\nMineralogy, petrography, geochemistry, and classification of the KoÅ¡ice meteorite\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nOzdÃ­N, Daniel; PlavÄAn, Jozef; HorÃ¥Ã¡ÄKovÃ¡, Michaela; Uher, Pavel; PorubÄAn, VladimÃ­R.; Veis, Pavel; RakovskÃ½, Jozef; TÃ³th, Juraj; KoneÄNÃ½, Patrik; SvoreÃ¥, JÃ¡N.\n\n2015-05-01\n\nThe KoÅ¡ice meteorite was observed to fall on 28 February 2010 at 23:25 UT near the city of KoÅ¡ice in eastern Slovakia and its mineralogy, petrology, and geochemistry are described. The characteristic features of the meteorite fragments are fan-like, mosaic, lamellar, and granular chondrules, which were up to 1.2 mm in diameter. The fusion crust has a black-gray color with a thickness up to 0.6 mm. The matrix of the meteorite is formed mainly by forsterite (Fo80.6); diopside; enstatite (Fs16.7); albite; troilite; Fe-Ni metals such as iron and taenite; and some augite, chlorapatite, merrillite, chromite, and tetrataenite. Plagioclase-like glass was also identified. Relative uniform chemical composition of basic silicates, partially brecciated textures, as well as skeletal taenite crystals into troilite veinlets suggest monomict breccia formed at conditions of rapid cooling. The KoÅ¡ice meteorite is classified as ordinary chondrite of the H5 type which has been slightly weathered, and only short veinlets of Fe hydroxides are present. The textural relationships indicate an S3 degree of shock metamorphism and W0 weathering grade. Some fragments of the meteorite KoÅ¡ice are formed by monomict breccia of the petrological type H5. On the basis of REE content, we suggest the KoÅ¡ice chondrite is probably from the same parent body as H5 chondrite MorÃ¡vka from Czech Republic. Electron-microprobe analysis (EMPA) with focused and defocused electron beam, whole-rock analysis (WRA), inductively coupled plasma mass and optical emission spectroscopy (ICP MS, ICP OES), and calibration-free laser induced breakdown spectroscopy (CF-LIBS) were used to characterize the KoÅ¡ice fragments. The results provide further evidence that whole-rock analysis gives the most accurate analyses, but this method is completely destructive. Two other proposed methods are partially destructive (EMPA) or nondestructive (CF-LIBS), but only major and minor elements can be evaluated due to the\n\nIodine-xenon, chemical, and petrographie studies of Semarkona chondrules: Evidence for the timing of aqueous alteration\n\nUSGS Publications Warehouse\n\nSwindle, T.D.; Grossman, J.N.; Olinger, C.T.; Garrison, D.H.\n\n1991-01-01\n\nWe have performed INAA, petrographie, and noble gas analyses on seventeen chondrules from the Semarkona meteorite (LL3.0) primarily to study the relationship of the I-Xe system to other measured properties. We observe a range of ???10 Ma in apparent I-Xe ages. The three latest apparent ages fall in a cluster, suggesting the possibility of a common event. The initial 129I/127I ratio (R0) is apparently related to chondrule type and/or mineralogy, with nonporphyritic and pyroxene-rich chondrules showing evidence for lower R0'S (later apparent I-Xe ages) than porphyritic and olivine-rich chondrules. In addition, chondrules with sulfides on or near the surface have lower R0S than other chondrules. The 129Xe/132Xe ratio in the trapped Xe component anticorrelates with R0, consistent with evolution of a chronometer in a closed system or in multiple similar systems. On the basis of these correlations, we conclude that the variations in R0 represent variations in ages, and that later event(s), possibly aqueous alteration, preferentially affected chondrules with nonporphyritic textures and/or sulfide-rich exteriors about 10 Ma after the formation of the chondrules. ?? 1991.\n\nColor Video Petrography.\n\nERIC Educational Resources Information Center\n\nNagle, Frederick\n\n1981-01-01\n\nDescribes the production and use of color videocassettes with an inexpensive, conventional TV camera and an ordinary petrographic microscope.

It was broken into several pieces when it hit a car upon falling. The largest piece weighing about 325 g and a small piece weighing 39 g were brought to the Kanazawa University for the measurements of gamma-rays emitted by cosmogenic nuclides only 2.7 days after the fall. Thereafter, the measurement was repeated several times. Other small pieces were used for petrographic, mineralogical and chemical studies. Noble gas mass spectrometry and AMS were also conducted. The Neagari meteorite shows a distinct, recrystallized structure under the microscopic observation of the thin section. Chondrules, 0.6 to 1.0 mm in diameter, are all present as relicts, buried in the well-recrystallized matrix. The chondrule-matrix boundaries are scarcely discernible in the granulated matrix. Olivine (Fa: 25.3 +/- 0.6 mole%) and orthopyroxene (Fs: 20.6 +/- 0.6 mole%) are the most abundant minerals both in matrix and in the chondrule relicts. Diopside is present as individual grains in the granular matrix. Interstitial feldspar crystal (Or(sub)6.3Ab (sub)88.0 An(sub)5.8) are common in the matrix and chondrule relicts, and often enclose minute pyroxene grains. Main opaque minerals are kamacite, taenite, troilite and chromite, and the metal phase is more abundant than the sulfide phase in the section. Both Fa and Fs values indicate that the Neagari meteorite is an L chondrite. The well-crystallized structure of the matrix, poorly defined outline of relict chondrules in the matrix, the prevalence of clear and well-developed plagioclase grains in the matrix and chondrule relicts and the absence of glass and monoclinic low-Ca pyroxene indicate the petrologic type to be 6.

I - Mineralogy and Petrology - Evidence of crystallization from evolving magmas\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nNeal, C. R.; Taylor, L. A.; Patchen, A. D.\n\n1989-01-01\n\nThe mineralogy and petrography of very high potassium (VHK) and high alumina (HA) basalts from the Apollo 14 site provide an insight into their magmatic evolution. Generally, their parageneses are similar, with olivine and chromite the early liquidus phases, followed by plagioclase and pyroxene, which crystallized together. Although late-stage ilmenite and FeNi metal occur in both VHK and HA samples, the VHKs also crystallize K-feldspar and Fa-rich olivine. Zoning of constituent minerals is similar for both basalt types, demonstrating that the parental magmas for both HA and VHK basalts became enriched in K, Na, Ca, Fe, and Ti and depleted in Mg and Al as crystallization proceeded. Enrichment of K in the VHK basalts is above that expected from normal fractional crystallization.\n\nPetrography, mineralogy, and geochemistry of deep gravelly sands in the Eyreville B core, Chesapeake Bay impact structure\n\nUSGS Publications Warehouse\n\nBartosova, Katerina; Gier, Susanne; Horton, J. Wright; Koeberl, Christian; Mader, Dieter; Dypvik, Henning\n\n2010-01-01\n\nThe ICDPâUSGS Eyreville drill cores in the Chesapeake Bay impact structure reached a total depth of 1766 m and comprise (from the bottom upwards) basement-derived schists and granites/pegmatites, impact breccias, mostly poorly lithified gravelly sand and crystalline blocks, a granitic slab, sedimentary breccias, and postimpact sediments. The gravelly sand and crystalline block section forms an approximately 26 m thick interval that includes an amphibolite block and boulders of cataclastic gneiss and suevite. Three gravelly sands (basal, middle, and upper) are distinguished within this interval. The gravelly sands are poorly sorted, clast supported, and generally massive, but crude size-sorting and subtle, discontinuous layers occur locally. Quartz and K-feldspar are the main sand-size minerals and smectite and kaolinite are the principal clay minerals. Other mineral grains occur only in accessory amounts and lithic clasts are sparse (only a few vol%). The gravelly sands are silica rich (~80 wt% SiO2). Trends with depth include a slight decrease in SiO2 and slight increase in Fe2O3. The basal gravelly sand (below the cataclasite boulder) has a lower SiO2 content, less K-feldspar, and more mica than the higher sands, and it contains more lithic clasts and melt particles that are probably reworked from the underlying suevite. The middle gravelly sand (below the amphibolite block) is finer-grained, contains more abundant clay minerals, and displays more variable chemical compositions than upper gravelly sand (above the block). Our mineralogical and geochemical results suggest that the gravelly sands are avalanche deposits derived probably from the nonmarine Potomac Formation in the lower part of the target sediment layer, in contrast to polymict diamictons higher in the core that have been interpreted as ocean-resurge debris flows, which is in agreement with previous interpretations. The mineralogy and geochemistry of the gravelly sands are typical for a passive\n\nMorphology and petrography of volcanic ashes.\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nHeiken, G.\n\n1972-01-01\n\nStudy of volcanic ash samples collected from a variety of recent eruptions using petrography, chemical analyses, and scanning electron microscopy to characterize each type and to relate ash morphology to magma composition and the type of eruption. The ashes are placed in the broad genetic categories of magmatic and phreatomagmatic. The morphology of ash particles from magmatic eruptions of high viscosity magma is governed primarily by vesicle density and shape. Ash particles from eruptions of low viscosity magmas are mostly droplets. The morphology of ash particles from phreatomagmatic eruptions is controlled by stresses within the chilled magma which result in fragmentation of the glass to form small blocky or pyramidal glass ash particles.\n\nMineralogy\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nDyar, M.

Further, all of the known minerals have specific stability ranges in pressure, temperature, an composition. A specific knowledge of the mineralogy of a planets surface or interior therefore allows one to characterize the present or past conditions under which the minerals were formed or have existed. For the purposes of this paper, a slightly broader definition of mineralogy was adopted by including not only crystalline materials found on planetary surfaces, but also ices and classes that can benefit from in situ types of analyses. Both visual examination and the various spectroscopies available for robotic probes to planetary surfaces are discussed.\n\nApplication of organic petrography in North American shale petroleum systems: A review\n\nUSGS Publications Warehouse\n\nHackley, Paul C.; Cardott, Brian J.\n\n2016-01-01\n\nOrganic petrography via incident light microscopy has broad application to shale petroleum systems, including delineation of thermal maturity windows and determination of organo-facies. Incident light microscopy allows practitioners the ability to identify various types of organic components and demonstrates that solid bitumen is the dominant organic matter occurring in shale plays of peak oil and gas window thermal maturity, whereas oil-prone Type I/II kerogens have converted to hydrocarbons and are not present. High magnification SEM observation of an interconnected organic porosity occurring in the solid bitumen of thermally mature shale reservoirs has enabled major advances in our understanding of hydrocarbon migration and storage in shale, but suffers from inability to confirm the type of organic matter present. Herein we review organic petrography applications in the North American shale plays through discussion of incident light photographic examples. In the first part of the manuscript we provide basic practical information on the measurement of organic reflectance and outline fluorescence microscopy and other petrographic approaches to the determination of thermal maturity. In the second half of the paper we discuss applications of organic petrography and SEM in all of the major shale petroleum systems in North America including tight oil plays such as the Bakken, Eagle Ford and Niobrara, and shale gas and condensate plays including the Barnett, Duvernay, Haynesville-Bossier, Marcellus, Utica, and Woodford, among others. Our review suggests systematic research employing correlative high resolution imaging techniques and in situ geochemical probing is needed to better document hydrocarbon storage, migration and wettability properties of solid bitumen at the pressure and temperature conditions of shale reservoirs.\n\nThe Apollo 16 Mare Component: Petrography, Geochemistry, and Provenance\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nZeigler, R.

The orebodies are bound to late-stage Hercynian structures, mainly due to brittle deformation, which are superimposed on earlier ductile shear zones, cutting through various catazonal lithologies, including ortho- and paragneisses, amphibolites, eclogites, and granites. Ore mineralogy, alteration, and ore textures define a frame whose main features are common to all prospects in the area. Main minerals are arsenopyrite and pyrite â accompanied by quartz, adularia, sericite, Â± (tourmaline, chlorite, carbonates, graphite), as main gangue minerals -with subordinate amounts of boulangerite, bismuthinite, kobellite, jamesonite, chalcopyrite, marcasite, galena, sphalerite, rutile, titanite, scheelite, beryl, fluorite, and minor native gold, electrum, native bismuth, fahlore, pyrrhotite, mackinawite, etc., defining a meso-catathermal paragenesis. Detailed microscopic study allows the author to propose a general descriptive scheme of textural classification for this type of ore. Most of the ores fill open spaces or veins, seal cracks or cement breccias; disseminated ores with replacement features related to alteration (mainly silicification, sericitization, and adularization) are also observed. Intensive and repeated cataclasis is a common feature of many ores, suggesting successive events of brittle deformation, hydrothermal flow, and ore precipitation. Gold may be transported and accumulated in any of these events, but tends to be concentrated in later ones. The origin of the gold ores is explained in terms of hydrothermal discharge, associated with mainly brittle deformation and possibly related to granitic magmas, in the global tectonic frame of crustal evolution of West Galicia. The mineralogical and textural study suggests some criteria which will be of practical value for\n\nMultiple Mechanisms of Transient Heating Events in the Protoplanetary Disk: Evidence from Precursors of Chondrules and Igneous Ca,Al-Rich Inclusions\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nKrot, A.

M.; Wu, Fu-Yuan\n\n2017-08-01\n\nApatites from the Verity, Fir, Gum, Howard Creek and Felix carbonatites of the Blue River (British Columbia, Canada) area have been investigated with respect to their paragenesis, cathodoluminescence, trace element and Sr-Nd isotopic composition. Although all of the Blue River carbonatites were emplaced as sills prior to amphibolite grade metamorphism and have undergone deformation, in many instances magmatic textures and mineralogy are retained. Attempts to constrain the U-Pb age of the carbonatites by SIMS, TIMS and LA-ICP-MS studies of zircon and titanite were inconclusive as all samples investigated have experienced significant Pb loss during metamorphism. The carbonatites are associated with undersaturated calcite-titanite amphibole nepheline syenite only at Howard Creek although most contain clasts of disaggregated phoscorite-like rocks. Apatite from each intrusion is characterized by distinct, but wide ranges, in trace element composition. The Sr and Nd isotopic compositions define an array on a 87Sr/86Sr vsÂ²Nd diagram at 350 Ma indicating derivation from depleted sub-lithospheric mantle. This array could reflect mixing of Sr and Nd derived from HIMU and EM1 mantle sources, and implies that depleted mantle underlies the Canadian Cordillera. Although individual occurrences of carbonatites in the Blue River region are mineralogically and geochemically similar they are not identical and thus cannot be considered as rocks formed from a single batch of parental magma at the same stage of magmatic evolution. However, a common origin is highly probable. The variations in the trace element content and isotopic composition of apatite from each occurrence suggest that each carbonatite represents a combination of derivation of the parental magma(s) from mineralogically and isotopically heterogeneous depleted mantle sources coupled with different stages of limited differentiation and mixing of these magmas. We do not consider these carbonatites as primary direct\n\nTracking Hydrothermal Fluid Pathways from Surface Alteration Mineralogy: The Case of Licancura Geothermal Field, Northern Chile\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nCamus, E.; Elizalde, J. D.; Morata, D.; Wechsler, C.\n\n2017-12-01\n\nIn geothermal systems alteration minerals are evidence of hot fluid flow, being present even in absence of other surface manifestations. Because these minerals result from the interaction between geothermal fluids and surrounding host rocks, they will provide information about features of thermal fluids as temperature, composition and pH, allowing tracking their changes and evolution. In this work, we study the Licancura Geothermal field located in the Andean Cordillera in Northern Chile. The combination of Principal Components Analysis on ASTER-L1T imagery and X Ray Diffraction (XRD) allow us to interpret fluid conditions and the areas where fluid flow took place. Results from red, green, blue color composite imagery show the presence of three types of secondary paragenesis. The first one corresponds to hematite and goethite, mainly at the east of the area, in the zone of eroded Pliocene volcanic edifices. The second one, mainly at the center of the area, highlighting propylitic alteration, includes minerals such as chlorite, illite, calcite, zeolites, and epidote. The third paragenesis, spatially related to the intersection between faults, represents advanced argillic alteration, includes minerals as alunite, kaolinite, and jarosite. XRD analysis support results from remote sensing techniques. These results suggest an acid pH hydrothermal fluid reaching temperatures at surface up to 80-100Â°C, which used faults as a conduit, originating advanced argillic minerals. The same fluid was, probably, responsible for propylitic paragenesis. However, iron oxides paragenesis identified in the area of eroded volcanoes probably corresponds to other processes associated with weathering rather than geothermal activity. In this work, we propose the applicability of remote sensing techniques as a first level exploration tool useful for high-altitude geothermal fields. Detailed clay mineral studies (XRD and SEM) would allow us to a better characterization of the geothermal fluid\n\nGeochemistry and mineralogy of the older (> 40 ka) ignimbrites in the Campanian Plain, southern Italy\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nBelkin, Harvey E.; Raia, Federica; Rolandi, Giuseppe; Jackson, John C.; de Vivo, Benedetto\n\n2010-05-01\n\nThe Campanian Plain in southern Italy has been volcanically active during the last 600 ka. The largest and best known eruption at 39 ka formed the Campanian Ignimbrite (CI), which has the largest volume (~310 km3) and the greatest areal extent. However, significant, but scattered deposits of older ignimbrites underlie the CI and document a long history of trachytic eruptions. We examined the geochemistry and mineralogy of 11 older ignimbrite strata by optical petrography, electron microprobe, scanning electron microscope, X-ray diffraction, and various whole-rock geochemical techniques. Strata at Durazzano (116.1 ka), Moschiano (184.7 ka), Seiano Valley A (245.9 ka), Seiano Valley B (289.6 ka), Taurano 7 (205.6 and 210.4 ka), Taurano 9 (183.8 ka), and Taurano 14 (157.4 ka) have been previously dated by the 40Ar/39Ar technique (Rolandi et al., 2003, Min. & Pet., 79) on hand-picked sanidine. The older ignimbrites are trachytic, but are highly altered with LOI from 8 to 17 wt%. Whole-rock compositions reflect variable element mobility during weathering; TiO2, Al2O3, Fe-oxide, and CaO tend to be enriched relative to average CI composition, whereas Na2O and K2O are depleted. X-ray diffraction identified major chabazite, kaolinite, and illite-smectite alteration products in some samples. The phenocryst mineralogy in all of the strata is typical for trachyte magma and consists of plagioclase (~An80 to ~An40), potassium feldspar (~Or50 to ~Or80), biotite (TiO2 = ~4.6 wt%, BaO = ~0.70 wt%, F = ~0.65 wt%), diopside (~Ca47Mg48Fe5 to ~Ca48Mg34Fe18), titanomagnetite, and uncommon Ca-amphibole. Relatively immobile trace elements Zr, Hf, Nb, and Th display similar abundance, linear trends, and ratios as those measured in the Campanian Ignimbrite: Th/Hf = ~4, Zr/Hf = ~50, and Zr/Nb = ~6. The similarity of trace element systematics and phenocryst mineralogy among the Campanian Ignimbrite and the older ignimbrites suggests that the magmagenesis processes and parental source have\n\nLunar sample studies.

The first seven are shown to be chemically similar although of two main textural groups; the eighth is seen to be distinct in both chemistry and mineralogy, (4) a troctolitic clast from a Fra Mauro breccia, analyzed and contrasted with other high-temperature lunar mineral assemblages. Two basaltic clasts from the same breccia are shown to have affinities with rock 14053, and (5) the uranium-thorium-lead systematics of three Apollo 16 samples are determined; serious terrestrial-lead contamination of the first two samples is attributed to bandsaw cutting in the lunar curatorial facility.\n\nAuthentication controversies and impactite petrography of the New Quebec Crater\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nMarvin, Ursula B.; Kring, David A.\n\n1992-01-01\n\nThe literature reports that led to the current acceptance of New Quebec Crater (Chubb Crater) as an authentic impact crater are reviewed, and it is noted that, for reasons that are not entirely clear, a meteoritic origin for the New Quebec Crater achieved wider acceptance at an earlier data than for the Lake Bosumtwi Crater, for which petrographic and chemical evidence is more abundant and compelling. The petrography of two impact melt samples from the New Quebec Crater was investigated, and new evidence is obtained on the degrees of shock metamorphism affecting the accessory minerals such as apatite, sphene, magnetite, and zircon.\n\nFe-Ca-phosphate, Fe-silicate, and Mn-oxide minerals in concretions from the Monterey Formation\n\nUSGS Publications Warehouse\n\nMedrano, M.D.; Piper, D.Z.\n\n1997-01-01\n\nConcentrically zoned phosphatic-enriched concretions were collected at three sites from the Monterey Formation. The following minerals were identified: vivianite, lipscombite, rockbridgeite, leucophosphite, mitridatite, carbonate fluorapatite, nontronite, todorokite, and barite. The mineralogy of the concretions was slightly different at each of the three collection sites. None of the concretions contains all of the minerals, but the spatial distribution of minerals in individual concretions, overlapping mineralogies between different concretions, and the geochemical properties of the separate minerals suggest a paragenesis represented by the above order. Eh increased from the precipitation of vivianite to that of rockbridgeite/lipscombite. The precipitation of leucophosphite, then mitridatite, carbonate fluorapatite and todorokite/Fe-oxide indicates increasing pH. Concretion growth culminated with the precipitation of todorokite, a Mn oxide, and minor amounts of barite along microfractures. Conspicuously absent are Fe-sulfide and Mn-phosphate minerals. The concretions are hosted by finely laminated diatomite. The laminations exhibit little to no deformation around the concretions, requiring that the concretions formed after compaction. We interpret this sediment feature and the paragenesis as recording the evolving pore-water chemistry as the formation was uplifted into the fresh-ground-water zone.\n\nLunar and Planetary Science XXXV: Lunar Rocks from Outer Space\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\n2004-01-01\n\nThe following topics were discussed: Mineralogy and Petrology of Unbrecciated Lunar Basaltic Meteorite LAP 02205; LAP02205 Lunar Meteorite: Lunar Mare Basalt with Similarities to the Apollo 12 Ilmenite Basalt; Mineral Chemistry of LaPaz Ice Field 02205 - A New Lunar Basalt; Petrography of Lunar Meteorite LAP 02205, a New Low-Ti Basalt Possibly Launch Paired with NWA 032; KREEP-rich Basaltic Magmatism: Diversity of Composition and Consistency of Age; Mineralogy of Yamato 983885 Lunar Polymict Breccia with Alkali-rich and Mg-rich Rocks; Ar-Ar Studies of Dhofar Clast-rich Feldspathic Highland Meteorites: 025, 026, 280, 303; Can Granulite Metamorphic Conditions Reset 40Ar-39Ar Ages in Lunar Rocks?

This highlights the importance of detailed combined mineralogical and geological remote sensing studies to assess the heterogeneity of the lunar crust.\n\nPetrography and geochemistry of the primary ore zone of the Kenticha rare metal granite-pegmatite field, Adola Belt, Southern Ethiopia: Implications for ore genesis and tectonic setting\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nMohammedyasin, Mohammed Seid; Desta, Zerihun; Getaneh, Worash\n\n2017-10-01\n\nThe aim of this work is to evaluate the genesis and tectonic setting of the Kenticha rare metal granite-pegmatite deposit using petrography and whole-rock geochemical analysis. The samples were analysed for major elements, and trace and rare earth elements by ICP-AES and ICP-MS, respectively. The Kenticha rare metal granite-pegmatite deposit is controlled by the N-S deep-seated normal fault that allow the emplacement of the granite-pegmatite in the study area. Six main mineral assemblages have been identified: (a) alaskitic granite (quartz + microcline + albite with subordinate muscovite), (b) aplitic layer (quartz + albite), (c) muscovite-quartz-microcline-albite pegmatite, (d) spodumene-microcline-albite pegmatite, partly albitized or greisenized, (e) microcline-albite-green and pink spodumene pegmatite with quartz-microcline block, which is partly albitized and greisenized, and (f) quartz core. This mineralogical zonation is also accompanied by variation in Ta ore concentration and trace and rare earth elements content. The Kenticha granite-pegmatite is strongly differentiated with high SiO2 (72-84 wt %) and enriched with Rb (â¼689 ppm), Be (â¼196 ppm), Nb (â¼129 ppm), Ta (â¼92 ppm) and Cs (â¼150 ppm) and depleted in Ba and Sr. The rare earth element (REE) patterns of the primary ore zone (below 60 m depth) shows moderate enrichment in light REE ((La/Yb)N = â¼8, and LREE/HREE = â¼9.96) and negative Eu-anomaly (Eu/Eu* = â¼0.4). The whole-rock geochemical data display the Within Plate Granite (WPG) and syn-Collisional Granite (syn-COLG) suites and interpret as its formation is crustal related melting. The mineralogical assemblage, tectonic setting and geochemical signatures implies that the Kenticha rare metal bearing granite pegmatite is formed by partial melting of metasedimentary rocks during post-Gondwana assembly and further tantalite enrichment through later hydrothermal-metasomatic processes.\n\nUltrabasic-basic change over primary inclusions in lower-mantle diamonds: Mineralogical and experimental evidence for crucial role of stishovite paradox\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nLitvin, Yuriy; Spivak, Anna\n\n2017-04-01\n\nMelting relations of the lower-mantle magmatic system MgO - FeO - CaO - SiO2 are characterized by peritectic reaction of bridgmanite (Mg,Fe)SiO3 and melt with formation of Fe-rich phases of periclase-wustite solid solutions (MgOâ¢FeO)ss and stishovite SiO2. The reaction proceeds also in melts-solutions of lower-mantle diamond-parental system MgO - FeO - CaO - SiO2 - (Mg-Fe-Ca-Na-carbonate) - C. Xenoliths of lower mantle rocks were never found among the deep mantle derived materials. Estimation of lower-mantle mineralogy as ferropericlase+ bridgmanite+ Ca-perovskite association is inferred from high-pressure subsolidus experiments with ultrabasic pyrolite composition (Akaogi, 2007). The paradoxical in situ paragenesis of stishovite and ferropericlase as primary inclusions in lower-mantle diamonds (Kaminsky, 2012) takes its explanation from the bridgmanite peritectic reaction (effect of \"stishovite paradox\") (Litvin et al., 2014). Based on the data for inclusions, physico-chemical study on syngenesis of diamonds and primary inclusions has experimentally revealed the ferropericlase-bridgmanite-Ca-perovskite-stishovite-magnesiowustite-(Mg-Fe-Ca-Na-carbonate)-carbon compositions of the lower-mantle diamond-forming system .(Litvin et al., 2016). The generalized diagram of diamong-forming media characterizes the variable compositions of growths melts for diamonds and paragenetic phases and their genetic relationships with lower mantle matter, and it is the reason for genetic classifying primary inclusions. Fractional ultrabasic-basic evolution and continuous paragenetic transition from ultrabasic bridgmanite-ferropericlase to basic stishovite-magnesiowustite assemblages in the of lower-mantle diamond-parental melts-solutions are providing by the physico-chemical mechanism of stishovite paradox.

Petrographic data indicate the average quartz-feldspar-lithic fragments (QFL) of the sandstone is Q = 63 %, F = 22 %, and L = 15 %. Lithic fragments mainly contain volcanic clasts that derived from surrounding basement. X-ray diffraction (XRD) data reveal abundant clay and detrital minerals (e.g. quartz), as well as minor calcite in the fine-grained sediments. The Hf contents and element concentration ratios such as Al2O3/TiO2, Co/Th, La/Sc, and La/Th are comparable to sediments derived from felsic and intermediate igneous rocks. The strong genetic relationship with the igneous rocks from the northwest and northeast areas provides evidence that the sediments of the Muling Formation (K1ml) in the Laoheishan basin have been derived from this area. The chemical index of alteration (CIA) and index of chemical variability (ICV) reveal an intensive weathering in the source region of the sediments. The multidimensional tectonic discrimination diagrams indicate that the source rocks of K1ml are mainly derived from the collision system. However, they may also comprise sediments derived from the continental rift system. The results are consistent with the geology of the study area.\n\nGeochemistry, geochronology, mineralogy, and geology suggest sources of and controls on mineral systems in the southern Toquima Range, Nye County, Nevada; with geochemistry maps of gold, silver, mercury, arsenic, antimony, zinc, copper, lead, molybdenum, bismuth, iron, titanium, vanadium, cobalt, beryllium, boron, fluorine, and sulfur; and with a section on lead associations, mineralogy and paragenesis, and isotopes\n\nUSGS Publications Warehouse\n\nShawe, Daniel R.; Hoffman, James D.; Doe, Bruce R.; Foord, Eugene E.; Stein, Holly J.; Ayuso, Robert A.\n\n2003-01-01\n\nGeochemistry maps showing the distribution and abundance of 18 elements in about 1,400 rock samples, both mineralized and unmineralized, from the southern Toquima Range, Nev., indicate major structural and lithologic controls on mineralization, and suggest sources of the elements. Radiometric age data, lead mineralogy and paragenesis data, and lead-isotope data supplement the geochemical and geologic data, providing further insight into timing, sources, and controls on mineralization. Major zones of mineralization are centered on structural margins of calderas and principal northwest-striking fault zones, as at Round Mountain, Manhattan, and Jefferson mining districts, and on intersections of low-angle and steep structures, as at Belmont mining district. Paleozoic sedimentary rocks, mostly limestones (at Manhattan, Jefferson, and Belmont districts), and porous Oligocene ash-flow tuffs (at Round Mountain district) host the major deposits, although all rock types have been mineralized as evidenced by numerous prospects throughout the area. Principal mineral systems are gold-silver at Round Mountain where about 7 million ounces of gold and more than 4 million ounces of silver has been produced; gold at Gold Hill in the west part of the Manhattan district where about a half million ounces of gold has been produced; gold-mercury-arsenic-antimony in the east (White Caps) part of the Manhattan district where a few hundred thousand ounces of gold has been produced; and silver-lead-antimony at Belmont where more than 150,000 ounces of silver has been produced. Lesser amounts of gold and silver have been produced from the Jefferson district and from scattered mines elsewhere in the southern Toquima Range. A small amount of tungsten was produced from mines in the granite of the Round Mountain pluton exposed east of Round Mountain, and small amounts of arsenic, antimony, and mercury have been produced elsewhere in the southern Toquima Range.

Jr.; Buurman, J.D.\n\n1993-12-01\n\nSandstone character and reservoir quality of the Lower Mississippian Pocono Big Injun sandstone were examined in Granny Creek-Stockly field, Clay County, West Virginia. Sixty-three samples from 6 wells were analyzed using transmitted light, x-ray diffraction, and scanning electron microscopy techniques. The Pocono Big Injun formation is divided into four [open quotes]sands[close quotes] (Injun 1 through 4) based on composition and hydrocarbon productivity. The Injun 1 sand is a fine-grained, carbonate-cemented litharenite below the oil-producing zone. The oil-productive Injun 2 and 3 sands are well sorted, fine-grained litharenites which contain more authigenic and allogenic clay minerals than adjacent sands. These sandsmoreÂ Â» have produced more than 3.4 million bbl of oil from the Granny Creek part of the field since 1925. The Injun 4 sand is generally a coarse-grained sublitharenite with marginal gas production limited to the uppermost section of the sand. The paragenetic sequence consists of (1) minor quartz overgrowths, (2) illite and chlorite grain coatings, (3) quartz overgrowths, (4) early carbonate, (5) kaolinite, (6) calcite, (7) dolomite, and (8) pyrite. Porosity and permeability were not preserved once paragenesis progressed past the kaolinite stage. Porosity and permeability are variably preserved when steps in the paragenetic sequence are absent within the Pocono Group. Where any porosity is identified within the Pocono sandstones, primary porosity is dominant. However, secondary porosity and microporosity in clay-rich intervals are also important.Â«Â less\n\nSkeletal carbonate mineralogy of Scottish bryozoans\n\nPubMed Central\n\nSpencer Jones, Mary; Najorka, Jens; Smith, Abigail M.\n\n2018-01-01\n\nThis paper describes the skeletal carbonate mineralogy of 156 bryozoan species collected from Scotland (sourced both from museum collections and from waters around Scotland) and collated from literature. This collection represents 79% of the species which inhabit Scottish waters and is a greater number and proportion of extant species than any previous regional study. The study is also of significance globally where the data augment the growing database of mineralogical analyses and offers first analyses for 26 genera and four families. Specimens were collated through a combination of field sampling and existing collections and were analysed by X-ray diffraction (XRD) and micro-XRD to determine wt% MgCO3 in calcite and wt% aragonite. Species distribution data and phylogenetic organisation were applied to understand distributional, taxonomic and phylo-mineralogical patterns. Analysis of the skeletal composition of Scottish bryozoans shows that the group is statistically different from neighbouring Arctic fauna but features a range of mineralogy comparable to other temperate regions. As has been previously reported, cyclostomes feature low Mg in calcite and very little aragonite, whereas cheilostomes show much more variability, including bimineralic species. Scotland is a highly variable region, open to biological and environmental influx from all directions, and bryozoans exhibit this in the wide range of within-species mineralogical variability they present. This plasticity in skeletal composition may be driven by a combination of environmentally-induced phenotypic variation, or physiological factors. A flexible response to environment, as manifested in a wide range of skeletal mineralogy within a species, may be one characteristic of successful invasive bryozoans.

Lamprophyre and peridotite petrologic types occur in the district where altered fractionated peridotites are enriched in Rare Earth Elements (REE) and some lamprophyre facies are depleted in incompatible elements. Unusual minerals in dikes, determined by petrography and X-ray diffraction, include schorlomite and andradite titanium garnets, astrophyllite, spodumene, niobium rutile, wÃ¼stite, fluoro-tetraferriphlogopite, villiaumite, molybdenite, and fluocerite, a REE-bearing fluoride fluorescent mineral. Mixing of MVT sphalerite ore fluids accompanies a mid-stage igneous alteration and intrusion event consistent with paragenetic studies. The presence of lithium in the spodumene and fluoro-tetraferriphlogopite suggests a lithium phase in the mineral fluids, and the presence of enriched REE in dikes and fluorite mineralization suggest a metasomatic event. Several of these rare minerals have never been described in the fluorspar district, and their occurrence suggests deep mantle metasomatism. Several REE-bearing fluoride minerals occur in the dikes and in other worldwide occurrences, they are usually associated with nepheline syenite and carbonatite differentiates. There is an early and late stage fluoride mineralization, which accompanied dike intrusion and was also analyzed for REE content. One fluorite group is enriched in LREE and another in MREE, which suggests a bimodal or periodic fluorite emplacement. Whole-rock elemental analysis was chondrite normalized and indicates that some of the dikes are slightly enriched in light REE and show a classic fractionation enrichment. Variations in major-element content; high titanium, niobium, and zirconium values; and high La/Yb, Zr/Y, Zr/Hf, and Nb/Ta ratios suggest metasomatized lithospheric-asthenospheric mantle-sourced intrusions.

The principal purpose of the core study is to correlate variations in chemistry, mineralogy and texture with engineering properties throughout the weathering profile. Coring sites were chosen to obtain a maximum depth of weathering on diverse lithologies. The rocks investigated include pelitic schist, metagraywacke, granite, diabase and serpentinite. Four to twelve samples per core were selected, depending on thickness of 1) the weathering profile (from about 1 m in serpentinite to more than 30 m in pelitic schist) and on 2) megascopic changes in saprolite character for analysis of petrography, texture, clay mineralogy andd major element chemistry. Shear strength and compressibility were determined on corresponding segments of core. Standard penetration tests were performed adjacent to coring sites to evaluate engineering properties in situ. Geochemical changes of saprolite developed from each rock type follow predictable trends from fresh rock to soil profile, with relative Increases in Si, Ti, Al, Fe3+ and H20; variable K; and relative loss of Fe 2+, Mg, Ca, and Na. These variations are more pronounced in the weathering profiles over mafic and ultramafic rocks than metagraywacke. Clay minerals in granite, schist and metagraywacke saprolite are kaolinite, dioctahedral vermiculite, interlayered micavermiculite, and minor illite. Gibbsite is locally developed in near-surface samples of schist. Standard penetration test data for the upper 7 m of saprolite over schist and metagraywacke suggest alternations between stronger and weaker horizons than probably reflect variations in lithology including the presence of quartz lenses. Results for granite saprolite are most consistent but indicate lower strength. Shear strength increases fairly regularly\n\nNew insights into the mineralogy of the Atlantis II Deep metalliferous sediments, Red Sea\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nLaurila, Tea E.; Hannington, Mark D.; Leybourne, Matthew; Petersen, Sven; Devey, Colin W.; Garbe-SchÃ¶nberg, Dieter\n\n2015-12-01\n\nThe Atlantis II Deep of the Red Sea hosts the largest known hydrothermal ore deposit on the ocean floor and the only modern analog of brine pool-type metal deposition. The deposit consists mainly of chemical-clastic sediments with input from basin-scale hydrothermal and detrital sources. A characteristic feature is the millimeter-scale layering of the sediments, which bears a strong resemblance to banded iron formation (BIF). Quantitative assessment of the mineralogy based on relogging of archived cores, detailed petrography, and sequential leaching experiments shows that Fe-(oxy)hydroxides, hydrothermal carbonates, sulfides, and authigenic clays are the main \"ore\" minerals. Mn-oxides were mainly deposited when the brine pool was more oxidized than it is today, but detailed logging shows that Fe-deposition and Mn-deposition also alternated at the scale of individual laminae, reflecting short-term fluctuations in the Lower Brine. Previous studies underestimated the importance of nonsulfide metal-bearing components, which formed by metal adsorption onto poorly crystalline Si-Fe-OOH particles. During diagenesis, the crystallinity of all phases increased, and the fine layering of the sediment was enhanced. Within a few meters of burial (corresponding to a few thousand years of deposition), biogenic (Ca)-carbonate was dissolved, manganosiderite formed, and metals originally in poorly crystalline phases or in pore water were incorporated into diagenetic sulfides, clays, and Fe-oxides. Permeable layers with abundant radiolarian tests were the focus for late-stage hydrothermal alteration and replacement, including deposition of amorphous silica and enrichment in elements such as Ba and Au.\n\nVesta Mineralogy: VIR maps Vesta's surface\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nCoradina, A.; DeSanctis, M.; Ammannito, E.; Capaccioni, F.; Capria, T.; Carraro, F.; Cartacci, M.; Filacchione, G.; Fonte, S.; Magni, G.;\n\n2011-01-01\n\nThe Dawn mission will have completed Survey orbit around 4 Vesta by the end of August 2011.

D.\n\n2015-12-01\n\nMajor priorities for Mars science include assessing the preservation potential and impact of diagenesis on biosignature preservation in aqueous sedimentary environments. We address these priorities with field and lab studies of playa evaporites of the Verde Formation (upper Pliocene) in Arizona. Evaporites studied include bottom-nucleated halite and displacive growth gypsum in magnesite-rich mudstone. These lithotypes are potential analogs for ancient lacustrine habitable environments on Mars. This study aimed to understand organic matter preservation potential under different diagenetic histories. Methods combined outcrop-scale field observations and lab analyses, including: (1) thin-section petrography to understand diagenetic processes and paragenesis; (2) X-ray powder diffraction to obtain bulk mineralogy; (3) Raman spectroscopy to identify and place phases (and kerogenous fossil remains) within a microtextural context; (4) Total Organic Carbon (TOC) analyses to estimate weight percentages of preserved organic carbon for each subfacies endmember; and (5) electron microprobe to create 2D kerogen maps semi-quantifying kerogen preservation in each subfacies. Results revealed complex diagenetic histories for each evaporite subfacies and pathways for organic matter preservation. Secondary gypsum grew displacively within primary playa lake mudstones during early diagenesis. Mudstones then experienced cementation by Mg-carbonates. Displacive-growth gypsum was sometimes dissolved, forming crystal molds. These molds were later either infilled by secondary sulfates or recrystallized to gypsum pseudomorphs with minor phases present (i.e., glauberite). These observations helped define taphonomic models for organic matter preservation in each subfacies. This work has the potential to inform in situ target identification, sampling strategies, and data interpretations for future Mars Sample Return missions (e.g., sample caching strategies for NASA's Mars 2020 mission).\n\nThe mineralogy of global magnetic anomalies\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nHaggerty, S.

An integrated program, ranging from the chemistry of materials from 100 or more km depth within the Earth, to an examination of the MAGSAT anomaly maps at about 400 km above the Earth's surface, was undertaken. Within this framework, a detailed picture of the pertinent mineralogical and magnetic relationships for the region of West Africa was provided. Efforts were directed toward: (1) examining the geochemistry, mineralogy, magnetic properties, and phases relations of magnetic oxides and metal alloys in rocks demonstrated to have originated in the lower crust of upper mantle, (2) examining the assumption that these rocks portray the nature of their source regions; and (3) examining the regional geology, tectonics, gravity field and the MAGSAT anomaly maps for West Africa.\n\nA mineralogical instrument for planetary applications\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nBlake, David F.; Vaniman, David T.; Bish, David L.\n\n1994-01-01\n\nThe mineralogy of a planetary surface can be used to identify the provenance of soil or sediment and reveal the volcanic, metamorphic and/or sedimentological history of a particular region.

Olson; Woodhead, J.D.; Smith, Kathleen S.\n\n2013-01-01\n\nMineralogy is the link between ore formation and ore extraction. It is the most fundamental component of geomet programs, and the most important aspect of a life-of-project approach to mineral resource projects. Understanding orebodies is achieved by understanding the mineralogy and texture of the materials, throughout the process, because minerals hold the information required to unlock the value they contain. Geomet mineralogy programs absolutely require the appropriate expertise and at least three steps of mineral characterisation prior to using semi-automated or other methods: field examination, thorough core logging, and optical microscopy. Economic geological inputs for orebody characterisation are necessary for orebody understanding, and are exemplified by current research in the Zambian Copperbelt, where revised sequence stratigraphy and understanding of alteration, metasomatism and metamorphism can be used to predict topical issues at mine sites. Environmental inputs for sustainability characterisation are demonstrated by recent work on tailings from the Leadville, Colorado, USA area, including linking mineralogy to water quality issues. Risk assessments need to take into account the technical uncertainties around geological variability and mineral extractability, and mineralogy is the only metric that can be used to make this risk contribution.\n\nStable isotopes in mineralogy\n\nUSGS Publications Warehouse\n\nO'Neil, J.R.\n\n1977-01-01\n\nStable isotope fractionations between minerals are functions of the fundamental vibrational frequencies of the minerals and therefore bear on several topics of mineralogical interest. Isotopic compositions of the elements H, C, O, Si, and S can now be determined routinely in almost any mineral. A summary has been made of both published and new results of laboratory investigations, analyses of natural materials, and theoretical considerations which bear on the importance of temperature, pressure, chemical composition and crystal structure to the isotopic properties of minerals. It is shown that stable isotope studies can sometimes provide evidence for elucidating details of crystal structure and can be a powerful tool for use in tracing the reaction paths of mineralogical reactions. ?? 1977 Springer-Verlag.\n\nSulfur Mineralogy at the Mars Phoenix Landing Site\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nMing, Douglas W.; Morris, R.V.; Golden, D.C.; Sutter, B.; Clark, B.C.; Boynton, W.V.; Hecht, M.H.; Kounaves, S.P.\n\n2009-01-01\n\nThe Mars Phoenix Scout mission landed at the northernmost location (approx.68deg N) of any lander or rover on the martian surface.

Michael\n\n2016-09-01\n\nIncreasing industrial demand of rare earth elements (REEs) stems from the central role they play for advanced technologies and the accelerating move away from carbon-based fuels. However, REE production is often hampered by the chemical, mineralogical as well as textural complexity of the ores with a need for better understanding of their salient properties. This is not only essential for in-depth genetic interpretations but also for a robust assessment of ore quality and economic viability. The design of energy and cost-efficient processing of REE ores depends heavily on information about REE element deportment that can be made available employing automated quantitative process mineralogy. Quantitative mineralogy assigns numeric values to compositional and textural properties of mineral matter. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) combined with a suitable software package for acquisition of backscatter electron and X-ray signals, phase assignment and image analysis is one of the most efficient tools for quantitative mineralogy. The four different SEM-based automated quantitative mineralogy systems, i.e. FEI QEMSCAN and MLA, Tescan TIMA and Zeiss Mineralogic Mining, which are commercially available, are briefly characterized. Using examples of quantitative REE mineralogy, this chapter illustrates capabilities and limitations of automated SEM-based systems. Chemical variability of REE minerals and analytical uncertainty can reduce performance of phase assignment. This is shown for the REE phases parisite and synchysite. In another example from a monazite REE deposit, the quantitative mineralogical parameters surface roughness and mineral association derived from image analysis are applied for automated discrimination of apatite formed in a breakdown reaction of monazite and apatite formed by metamorphism prior to monazite breakdown. SEM-based automated mineralogy fulfils all requirements for characterization of complex unconventional REE ores that will become\n\nPetrography and Geochemistry of the Zamora Batholith in the south of the sub-Andean zone (Ecuador)\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nVillares, F. M.\n\n2013-05-01\n\nThe Zamora Batholith is an intrusive complex that is located in the extreme south-east of Ecuador. It has dimensions of 200 x 50 km approximately. It is mainly located in the Zamora Chinchipe province from which it takes its name. This study consisted in the petrographic and geochemical characterization of the Zamora Batholith in the area covered by 1: 50,000 geological maps of Centro Shaime, Guayzimi, Paquisha, Los Encuentros and El Pangui. Fieldwork was done by the \"Proyecto Mapeo GeolÃ³gico escala 1:50.000 (zonas prospectivas mineras)\" of the Instituto Nacional de InvestigaciÃ³n GeolÃ³gico, Minero, MetalÃºrgico of Ecuador. This research was performed with 59 thin sections and 10 whole - rock chemical analysis done in the C.I.C of the Granada University. The Zamora Batholith intrudes Triassic to Jurassic volcanic rocks. It is overlaid by sandstones of the Hollin Formation of the Upper Aptian age and shale and limestone from the Napo Formation. Post-cretaceous deposits of ash and lava flows of andesitic to rhyolitic compositions cover the batholith. The petrography of the Zamora Batholith ranges from tonalite to monzogranite with the same qualitative mineralogy. The rocks are composed by different proportions of plagioclase, amphibole, feldspar K, quartz, biotite, opaque, pyroxene and epidote, as accessory minerals has zircon, sphene and apatite. To the south of the Conguime and Guayzimi towns, the dominant petrography is medium to coarse grained amphibole granodiorite with tonalitic and monzogranitic subordinates. To the north monzogranites are dominant rocks and subordinate granodiorites. To the East of Santa Elena the sienogranites are associated with El Hito porphyritic granite that intrudes to Zamora Batholith. Frequently the batholith has propylitic alteration; which produces a primary association of chlorite, epidote, calcite and pyrite. The granitoids have dioritic to granitic compositions (60.09 to 73.6 wt.% SiO2) and are I - type, medium to high-K calc\n\nNASA Moon Mineralogy Mapper\n\nNASA Image and Video Library\n\n2008-12-17\n\nDifferent wavelengths of light provide new information about the Orientale Basin region of the moon in a composite image taken by NASA Moon Mineralogy Mapper, a guest instrument aboard the Indian Space Research Organization Chandrayaan-1 spacecraft.\n\nX-ray Spectroscopy and Magnetism in Mineralogy\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nSainctavit, Philippe; Brice-Profeta, Sandrine; Gaudry, Emilie; Letard, Isabelle; Arrio, Marie-Anne\n\nThe objective of this paper is to present the kind of information that can be gained in the field of mineralogy from the use of x-ray magnetic spectroscopies. We review some of the questions that are unsettled and that could benefit from an interdisciplinary approach where magnetism, spectroscopy and mineralogy could be mixed. Most of the attention is focused on iron and some other 3d transition elements. The mineralogy of planetary cores and its relation with known meteorites are exemplified. The various oxide phases in the mantle and the nature of iron in these phases is also underlined. The presence of transition elements in insulating minerals and its relation with macroscopic properties such as the color of gemstones are reviewed. Finally an introduction to paleomagnetism is given with a special attention to nanomaghemites.\n\nPetrography and geochemistry of granitoids from the Samphire Pluton, South Australia: Implications for uranium mineralisation in overlying sediments\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nDomnick, Urs; Cook, Nigel J.; Bluck, Russel; Brown, Callan; Ciobanu, Cristiana L.\n\n2018-02-01\n\nThe Blackbush uranium deposit (JORC Inferred Resource: 12,580 tonnes U), located on the north-eastern Eyre Peninsula, is currently the only sediment-hosted U deposit investigated in detail in the Gawler Craton. Uranium is hosted within Eocene sandstone of the Kanaka Beds, overlying Mesoproterozoic granites of the Samphire pluton, affiliated with the Hiltaba Intrusive Suite ( 1.6 Ga). These are considered the most probable source rocks for uranium mineralisation. By constraining the petrography and mineralogy of the granites, insights into the post-emplacement evolution can be gained, which may provide an exploration indicator for other sediment-hosted uranium systems. Three geochemically distinct granite types were identified in the Samphire Pluton and correspond to domains interpreted from geophysical data. All granites show complex alteration overprints and textures with increasing intensity closer to the deposit, as well as crosscutting veining. Alkali feldspar has been replaced by porous K-feldspar and albite, and plagioclase is overprinted by an assemblage of porous albite + sericite Â± calc-silicates (prehnite, pumpellyite and epidote). This style of feldspar alteration is regionally widespread and known from Hiltaba-aged granites associated with iron-oxide copper-gold mineralisation at Olympic Dam and in the Moonta-Wallaroo region. In two granite types biotite is replaced by calcic garnet. Calc-silicates are indicative of Ca-metasomatism, sourced from the anorthite component of altered plagioclase. Minor clay alteration of feldspars is present in all samples. Mineral assemblages in veins include quartz + hematite, hematite + coffinite, fluorite + quartz, and clay minerals. Minor chlorite and sericite are found in all vein types. All granite types are anomalously rich in U (concentrations between 10 and 81 ppm). Highly variable Th/U ratios, as well as hydrothermal U minerals (mostly coffinite) in granites and veins, are clear evidence for U mobility.

This model can reconcile climate models with mineralogical and geomorphological evidence.\n\nMineralogy: a modern approach to teaching a traditional discipline\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nCook, G. W.\n\n2011-12-01\n\nMineralogy has traditionally been a primary component in undergraduate geoscience curriculum. In recent years, there has been a trend in which mineralogy and petrology have been combined into Earth Materials courses. This is unfortunate as these disciplines each have much to offer students, and content once considered essential is eliminated out of necessity. Mineralogy is still fundamental to students' understanding of the Earth and Earth processes. Using a modern approach to time-honored concepts, I teach a quarter-long Introductory Mineralogy class offered through the Scripps Institution of Oceanography at the University of California, San Diego. Student evaluations of this course unequivocally indicate a high degree of learning and interest in the material, confirming that mineralogy continues to be a valuable class into the 21st century. While much of the content remains similar to what has been taught over the last century, my strategy involves a well-balanced approach to old and new. The first third of the course is background including the relevance of mineralogy, crystal chemistry, and crystallography; the second third of the course is systematic mineralogy using the Dana system; the last third of the course is devoted to understanding optical mineralogy, using modern analytical equipment such as XRD and SEM, and learning to use the petrographic microscope. Throughout the quarter, a strong emphasis is placed on the importance of hand-sample identification. Field work, traditionally not emphasized in mineralogy courses, has been re-introduced to the curriculum. I use modern technology to facilitate and support student learning. A lecture-based approach is employed with carefully crafted and organized PowerPoint presentations. PowerPoint lectures can be effective and highly engaging. The key is to ensure that the lectures are not overly reliant on text, instead relying"
