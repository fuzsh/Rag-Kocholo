        "text": "We present the results of a 3D seismic survey acquired near Schneeberg in the western Erzgebirge (Germany). The aim of the project is to use seismic exploration methods to image and to characterize a major fault zone in crystalline rock, which could be used as a natural heat exchanger at a target depth of about 5-6 km with expected temperatures between 160-180°C. The region itself is dominated by the NW-SE striking Gera-Jáchymov fault system. The main geological features in the survey area are well known from intensive mining activities down to a depth of about 2 km. The seismic investigations aimed at imaging the partly steeply dipping fault branches at greater depth, in particular a dominant NE dipping fault in the central part of the survey area with displacements up to 500 m. Beside this main structure, the Gera-Jáchymov fault zone consists of a couple of SW dipping conjugated faults. For the purpose of imaging and characterizing this fault zone, a high resolution 3D Vibroseis s..."
