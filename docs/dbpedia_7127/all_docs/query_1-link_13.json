        "text": "December 21, 2023 | For climate protection and science: „Soil of the Year“ 2024 lies in Dresden forest.\n\nAfter arable soil or mudflats in previous years, the choice for \"Soil of the Year\" in 2024 fell on the forest - and on Dresden: the soil from Tharandt Forest was chosen to represent the great diversity of the 11.4 million hectares of forest in Germany. This is because it provides important data for climate research and sustainable forest management. It serves as an \"open-air laboratory\" for the forestry sciences at TU Dresden and provides deep insights: Through freely accessible pits, it offers insights into the usually hidden underground part of the forest ecosystem.\n\nThe forest floor - which exists in countless different forms - is a real all-rounder: its importance for humans, animals, plants and the climate is enormous. More organisms live in a handful of soil than there are people on earth, it is a greater carbon store than vegetation, absorbs heavy rainfall and thus contributes to flood protection. And it is the largest freshwater reservoir in Germany.\n\nThe soil in the Tharandt Forest serves as an „open-air laboratory“ for the forest sciences at the Faculty of Environmental Sciences at TU Dresden. It is also part of a soil nature trail that the soil scientists at TU Dresden have created on behalf of the Saxon State Office for the Environment, Agriculture and Geology (LfULG). Here, visitors can take a look beneath the surface of the forest ecosystem in six soil profile pits. Several display boards provide information about the soil, the plants rooted in it, the geology of the Tharandt Forest, the regional climate and climate development. Several degree programmes at TU Dresden, TU Bergakademie Freiberg and other universities use the soil nature trail. Extensive analysis material is available for this purpose.\n\n„High-resolution information on the nature of the ground cover is indispensable for sustainable forest management, especially in changing climatic conditions,“ explains Prof Karl-Heinz Feger from the Institute of Soil Science and Site Ecology at TU Dresden. „But soil data is also essential for complex calculation models, for example for deriving climate change scenarios and planning corresponding adaptation measures. The basis for this is still a precise soil description and targeted sampling in the field.“\n\nFederal Minister of Agriculture Cem Özdemir is the patron of the „Soil of the Year“. On this year's World Soil Day, 5 December 2023, the Federal Ministry of Food and Agriculture (BMEL) solemnly declared forest soil to be Soil of the Year 2024.\n\nMore information\n\nTUD News\n\nDecember 11, 2023 | Strong together: Eleven Saxon cooperation partners for „Future Mobility“\n\nBeing faster on the market and working more energy-efficiently – that is the goal: in future, Dresden will join forces to work on technologies for „Future Mobility“. Semiconductor manufacturer Infineon, three medium-sized companies and seven research institutions from Saxony have joined forces for the research and development project „Green Mobility 'made in Saxony' - Innovative solutions for future-oriented automotive and industrial applications“. The project is now starting its work.\n\nThe results for green mobility \"made in Saxony\" are to be incorporated into automotive and industrial applications - for example through significantly more efficient and functional microcontrollers for cars. Due to the increasing digitalisation of car mechanics, these are becoming more and more in demand. The new technologies from Saxony should not only help to save energy in the future, but also resources thanks to increased functionality and a longer service life. They will therefore make an important contribution to climate protection.\n\nThe project is also researching new technology concepts to enable the development and manufacture of these semiconductor products with the highest quality and reliability. This makes the production process more controllable - and therefore more sustainable. Ultimately, the aim is to find solutions for manufacturing the electronic components that are so sought-after by the automotive industry in high quantities, with excellent quality and under attractive working conditions in Saxony, which will enhance the value of the business location.\n\n„Cooperation between important stakeholders from research and industry in Saxony to create innovative semiconductor solutions is of great importance for the business location,\" says Martin Dulig, Saxon State Minister for Economic Affairs, Labour and Transport. „The work of the partners in the joint research project is an important building block for the next innovations 'made in Saxony'. The project results will form the basis for future-oriented products that improve people's quality of life and contribute to achieving climate targets.\"\n\nThe project is funded by the EU and the Free State of Saxony. Following the symbolic handover of the funding decisions totalling around 17.7 million euros for three years, the project can now really get underway. Although the funding decisions had already been available since the end of October, the official go-ahead has now been given with the ceremonial handover.\n\nIn addition to Infineon, the project partners include the Dresden companies Fabmatics GmbH and SYSTEMA Systementwicklung Dipl.-Inf. Manfred Austen GmbH, LEC GmbH from Eibenstock as well as Chemnitz University of Technology, Dresden University of Technology, Dresden University of Applied Sciences, Zwickau University of Applied Sciences, Helmholtz Centre Dresden-Rossendorf, the Fraunhofer Institute for Photonic Microsystems Dresden and the Fraunhofer Institute for Material and Beam Technology IWS Dresden.\n\nMore information\n\nSaxon State Ministry of Economic Affairs, Labour and Transport\n\nDecember 5, 2023 | Sustainable building: Dresden and Saxony lead the way\n\nConstruction and climate protection: do they go together? The figures are sobering: the construction industry accounts for more than a quarter of global CO2 emissions. It also accounts for a whopping 40 percent of global energy consumption. In Germany, construction waste accounts for almost 60 percent of the annual waste volume. High time for innovative concepts for sustainable construction! The “Living Art of Building” (LAB) research center, initiated by the TU Dresden, will soon be developing such concepts. The LAB is to be based in Bautzen and set up at various locations across Germany.\n\nThe multi-year development of the LAB is set to begin in 2024. Through intensive basic research into climate-neutral and resource-efficient construction, solutions and ideas for the development of new materials, technologies and processes are to be found on a large scale. “Research at the LAB can create technology leadership from Germany for new construction,” says initiator Prof. Manfred Curbach from TU Dresden. “If you want to have a positive impact on climate change, you have to start with construction.”\n\nIn the future, a total of around 1,250 employees from science and technology will conduct research and development in laboratory facilities that are unique in the world. Close cooperation with industry will create up to 40,000 jobs in and around the LAB in the long term. All interested parties throughout Germany who can contribute the necessary expertise and resources can participate. The aim is also to cooperate with strong partners from science and industry across Germany, Europe and worldwide.\n\nSince 2021, the LAB concept has been developed by a multidisciplinary team of experts. In addition to Prof. Curbach, the team includes Jan Wörner, President of acatech, Dr. Birgit Beckmann from TU Dresden and Prof. Edeltraud Günther and Franziska Stölzel from the United Nations University.\n\nThe Budget Committee of the German Bundestag recently decided to provide a total of 3.6 million euros for the establishment of the LAB in the 2024 federal budget. For the following four years, up to 65 million euros have also been anchored as so-called commitment appropriations. In addition, the districts of Bautzen and Görlitz have pledged to make up to 450 million euros of their structural change funds available with the help of the cities and municipalities.\n\nMore information\n\nTUD News\n\nNovember 21, 2023 | When do algae grow best - and how loud do ship engines roar? The Dresden \"Minilab\" finds out!\n\nA major appearance for innovative power from Dresden at the Baltic Sea this week: the Fraunhofer research group Smart Ocean Technologies (SOT) presented the “Minilab” service and test platform at the “Rostock Ocean Convention”. The mobile underwater laboratory was successfully tested under the leadership of the Dresden-based Fraunhofer Institute for Ceramic Technologies and Systems IKTS. It can be used in a variety of ways at depths of up to 100 meters in lakes, rivers and oceans - from testing new coatings for ship hulls or monitoring ship noise to monitoring algae cultures for the green smoothies of tomorrow. And it helps to bring innovative future technologies to market more quickly.\n\nHow long does it take for algae, sea snails and small crustaceans to colonize the fresh underwater paint on a yacht? How do underwater ecosystems react to new offshore constructions? Important questions like these can now be answered quickly and easily with the help of the “Minilab”.\n\nThe underwater laboratory consists of an open tubular steel construction with basic sensor equipment that can be flexibly equipped with samples and other sensors and measuring devices. Thanks to an edge length of only around 70 centimeters, it can be easily transported by car. It is equipped with four cameras and a temperature and pressure sensor as well as various sensors. It can use these, for example, to determine whether a body of water is acidic or alkaline, how high the oxygen content or UV radiation is. The energy required for this still comes from land via a power line and the recorded data is also sent by cable to an electronic measuring case above the water. “However, we are already planning a self-sufficient follow-up solution,” reveals SOT research group leader Dr. Kathrin Baumgarten. The laboratory will be powered by batteries in a buoy. The recorded sensor data is then forwarded directly to a mobile router in the buoy.\n\nDue to the many possible applications, the “Minilab” is not only interesting for sensor manufacturers and developers of new underwater materials, but also for aquatic farmers, for example. In view of climate change, population growth and changing eating habits, attempts are now also being made to produce sugar kelp and edible large algae in the Baltic Sea. These algae cultures are used to the cooler temperatures of the world's oceans. The “Minilab” could monitor the water temperature and other vital parameters to ensure that such green settlements succeed. “We bring the samples and equipment to be analyzed into the water for our partners,” says Baumgarten. “This helps them to bring innovations to the market more quickly.”\n\nNovember 9, 2023 | Fraunhofer IKTS from Dresden presents innovative technology for shorter root canal treatments\n\nRoot canal treatments are one of the most unpleasant things we can expect at the dentist: Painful and almost always lengthy. Researchers at the Fraunhofer IKTS in Dresden have now discovered how the file, which penetrates deep into the root canal, does not stick so quickly, thus speeding up the treatment. A huge relief for dentists and a blessing for patients! Next week, IKTS will be presenting the innovative technology, which is based on the special material piezoceramic, at COMPAMED in Düsseldorf.\n\nWhen deep-seated caries and inflammation have attacked the tooth roots, root canal treatment is usually unavoidable. The doctor then opens the tooth to remove inflamed tissue. The problem is that the rotating file used for this has to be constantly cleaned in between. Researchers at the Fraunhofer Institute for Ceramic Technologies and Systems IKTS in Dresden have now developed a tiny piezoceramic stack actuator as part of the joint research project “IPUCLEAN”, which means that the file no longer sticks so often and the treatment ends more quickly.\n\nIn so-called stack actuators, several layers are placed on top of each other and interconnected. This enabled the scientists to design the device so small that it can still be moved easily in the confined space of the oral cavity.\n\nPiezoceramics are ceramic materials that exhibit a so-called charge separation as soon as they are deformed by an external force and this is precisely what the Dresden team is taking advantage of: The rotation of the file is superimposed by an oscillating movement, so the file rotates and oscillates at the same time.\n\n“By superimposing the rotation with an axial oscillation, the file becomes clogged less quickly,” says Dr. Holger Neubert, Head of the Intelligent Materials and Systems department at IKTS. “The dentist can concentrate much better on the already difficult work in the root canal. The risk of file breakage is also reduced.”\n\nThe company Gebr. Brasseler GmbH & Co. KG was the coordinator of the project, which was funded by the German Federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF). Doctors from the Faculty of Dentistry at the University of Rostock have already tested the technology on plastic teeth and have given positive feedback!\n\nThe technology can also be used for other medical applications, for example in diagnostics or cancer treatment. “Piezoceramic components enable a wide variety of different applications and are attractive for medical technology due to their compactness and performance,” says Dr. Neubert. “We are able to develop individual solutions for customers that are tailored to their specific needs.”\n\nFrom November 13 to 16, Fraunhofer IKTS, which is a leader in working with piezoceramic materials, will be presenting its innovative technology for shorter root canal treatments – and the further potential of piezoceramic technology – at the COMPAMED medical technology trade fair in Düsseldorf.\n\nMore information\n\nIKTS News\n\nNovember 9, 2023 | Impulses for green energy: 3D printer unique in Europe in Dresden\n\nCombustion chambers for hydrogen energy systems or blade wheel enclosures for turbines: These and other complex components made of metal are the specialty of the new 3D printer at the Fraunhofer Institute for Material and Beam Technology (IWS) in Dresden. Thanks to a special layering process, it produces large components with complicated geometry in a short time. This makes it unique in Europe - and opens up great opportunities, especially for medium-sized companies.\n\nAdditive manufacturing is becoming increasingly important. This is a particularly innovative and resource-saving manufacturing process: Unlike conventional methods, in which material is removed - comparable to the sculptor's block - here material is added step by step. Exemplary for this process is 3D printing.\n\nNow the Fraunhofer IWS in Dresden has installed an industrial 3D printer that is unique in Europe. The manufacturing system is based on selective laser beam melting in a powder bed. In this process, a laser beam melts fine metal particles. From this melt, the system creates the desired component layer by layer according to a computer model. Components made of titanium, copper and other metals or their alloys can be produced in this way.\n\nThe special feature of the new IWS 3D printer is that it can also produce large and complex components - volumes of up to 62 by 62 by 110 centimeters are possible. This opens up great opportunities for SMEs: \"With this kind of system technology, SMEs in eastern Germany can develop special unique selling points with the help of the Fraunhofer IWS,\" emphasizes institute director Prof. Christoph Leyens. The state-of-the-art plant also plays a key role in the \"SpreeTec next\" project. It is to contribute to the development of new manufacturing processes and value chains.\n\n\"SpreeTec neXt,\" initiated by the Brandenburg University of Technology Cottbus Senftenberg (BTU) and the Fraunhofer-Gesellschaft, sees itself as a bridge between industry and research to help small and medium-sized companies in the plastics and metal processing industries make the transition to green energy technology. By 2029, the project partners want to establish an innovation center in Lusatia for this purpose and provide advice on the use of advanced technologies related to additive manufacturing. The German Federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF) is funding these specific subtasks of \"SpreeTec neXt\" with five million euros each.\n\nMore information\n\nFraunhofer IWS News\n\nOctober 27, 2023 | New surgical robot \"HUGO RAS\" consolidates Dresden's status as an important smart health location.\n\nGerman premiere in Dresden: At the University Hospital Carl Gustav Carus (UKD), the robot HUGO RAS has performed a urological operation for the first time. It is a new member of the UKD's robotics park, which also includes three Da Vinci models. This creates the best conditions for setting up a versatile range of therapies. The new \"Robotic diversity\" also makes the UKD an even more attractive place for research and teaching.\n\nAn incision no larger than a keyhole: Minimally invasive surgery is characterized by its gentle handling of the body. In recent years, the technique has undergone rapid development. The main drivers are new technologies, especially high-end surgical robots.\n\nOne of the most advanced in the evolution of these devices is the HUGO RAS, where RAS stands for \"robotic assisted surgery\". It has been part of the UKD's impressive robotics park since recently and was put to the test right away: it was the first HUGO in Germany to perform a urological operation. The patient was a 78-year-old man whose prostate had been reduced in size.\n\nThe UKD already had three Da Vinci surgical robots before the arrival of the high-end robot. Both the HUGO and the Da Vinci consolidate Dresden's position as a major location for care, research and teaching. For patients, the various robotic systems open up new opportunities. Depending on the findings, the surgical teams can choose between the two systems.\n\nThe HUGO has four highly individually adjustable arms and an open console. This allows the surgeon to work close to the patient and in the middle of his team. The device also ensures a better view of the overall scene in the OR. By comparison, the four arms of the Da Vinci surgical robot are operated via a separately standing console away from the operating table. Both systems enable minimally invasive and thus gentle interventions.\n\n\"The new robotic system takes Dresden University Medical Center to a new surgical level,\" says Saxony's Minister of Science Sebastian Gemkow. Prof. Michael Albrecht, Medical Director at the University Hospital, is also excited about being able to offer the \"two most highly developed robotic systems\" under one roof: \"This is an enormous advantage when it comes to attracting employees to us.\" Prof. Christian Thomas, Director of the Clinic and Polyclinic for Urology, gives the specific reasons for this. In the future, for example, he says, they want to offer training in the use of the Hugo and conduct research with AI. \"Robotic diversity at the university hospital should ensure that modern minimally invasive surgery is not automatically associated with a manufacturer in the future,\" says Prof. Thomas.\n\nUKD staff in abdominal, lung and vascular surgery will also benefit from the support of both robotic systems in the future. In addition to clinical use, the device will also be used scientifically. Patients can be included in studies and treated accordingly.\n\nMore information\n\nCarus News\n\nOctober 23, 2023 | Dual-ion technology with Dresden participation as a game changer?\n\nBalcony power units are booming – not least because bureaucratic hurdles are currently being removed for private energy generation in miniature power generation. However, the question of how to store surplus electricity has not yet been answered satisfactorily. This is where dual-ion batteries (DIBs) as rechargeable stationary energy storage devices come into play. With the participation of Dresden's Fraunhofer IKTS and TU Dresden, the novel technology is now being made fit for industrial application.\n\nWith these small power units, tenants and property owners can easily produce solar power – much more cheaply than with rooftop photovoltaic systems. But how can unused electricity in the home be stored in a cost-effective and environmentally friendly way?\n\nThe answer could be a real game changer: Emerging dual-ion technology. Unlike previous lithium-ion storage systems, this technology uses graphite and materials available in Germanyrather than environmentally harmful and expensive metals such as nickel or cobalt. Their charging and discharging process is also faster. Dual-ion batteries thus promise lower costs, more safety, greater independence - and above all: more sustainability! However, research to date has focused on the production of laboratory cells. Industrially relevant cell formats have remained largely unexamined.\n\nThe \"TransDIB\" project (Development and Transfer of Cost-efficient, Sustainable and Safe Dual-Ion Batteries for Stationary Energy Storage Solutions) now aims to improve the industrial transfer of this battery cell technology. To this end, the project partners intend to produce prototypes on a pilot plant for lithium-ion batteries. The planning of industrial cell production for DIBs is to be based on this, so that graphite electrodes can later be produced on a large scale.\n\nTo this end, partners from industry (VARTA Microbattery GmbH, SGL Carbon GmbH, E-LYTE Innovations GmbH, Sixonia Tech GmbH) and research (Dresden University of Technology, Fraunhofer Institute for Ceramic Technologies and Systems IKTS, Westphalian Wilhelms University Münster) are working hand in hand on the project. “TransDIB” runs from February 2023 to January 2026 and is funded by the German Federal Ministry of Education and Research with 2.3 million euros.\n\nMore information\n\nIKTS News\n\nOctober 19, 2023 | Biotype analysis device from Dresden revolutionizes cancer therapy and forensics\n\nPrecision medicine is currently creating a new industry of the future - and Saxon companies, hospitals and research institutions are leading the way. One of them is the biotech company Biotype from Dresden. The improved version of its Modaplex analysis device is now paving new paths - both in cancer therapy and in tracking down criminals.\n\nDresden is increasingly becoming the most important hotspot and driving force in precision medicine. It is already one of the top three locations in Germany in terms of artificial intelligence and data expertise - two key technologies for the development of state-of-the-art diagnostic procedures.\n\nA key player in this field is Dresden-based biotech company Biotype, which is setting new standards in the analysis of blood samples with Modaplex. It has now launched an improved version of the procedure: the table-sized device enables individualized treatment methods for cancer patients. Blood samples are fed into the device. Small biomarkers then evaluate the results and design personalized therapies.\n\nIn less than four hours, the automated workflow of the Modaplex platform delivers fast and accurate results. In this time, the decision-relevant RNA and DNA biomarkers are measured simultaneously from one sample. On this basis, the best possible therapy can be initiated. Biotype thus makes a significant contribution to relieving the burden on the healthcare system.\n\nHowever, the device is not only suitable for the treatment of cancer patients, but is also used in forensics: Thanks to the technology, tissue, blood or urine can now be used to determine precisely whether or not a crime suspect was present at the scene of the crime. On the one hand, this opens up new opportunities for prisoners who may have been convicted in error to be pardoned. On the other hand, cases that have already been closed and not uncovered can be taken \"out of the fridge\" and reopened with the help of the Modaplex.\n\nMore information\n\nBiotype News\n\nOctober 5, 2023 | Membranes for climate-neutral waste incineration from Dresden\n\nWorldwide, 280 million tons of waste are incinerated every year. In many countries, energy is generated from the resulting heat. The problem is that the resulting flue gas contains climate-damaging carbon dioxide (CO2). The joint project “KlimProMem”, coordinated by Fraunhofer IKTS in Dresden, therefore aims to separate the CO2 from the flue gas in order to use it for production in the basic materials industry. An innovative membrane technology is used for this purpose.\n\nThe “KlimProMem” project focuses on the further development of climate-neutral processes in the basic materials industry, i.e. those areas of industry that extract basic materials and prepare them for further processing. For these, the project participants are testing membranes, plant and process concepts to enable the climate-neutral production of important basic materials.\n\nIn this case, special carbon membranes are being developed for separating CO2 from flue gas at Fraunhofer IKTS in Dresden and scaled up for large plants. The special feature: To make the process as energy-efficient as possible, geothermal energy is being combined for the first time with energy-efficient membrane distillation – a thermally driven separation process. The principle is to be tested at two waste incineration plants.\n\nCompared to the polymer membranes usually used in this process, carbon membranes offer more favorable chemical and mechanical stability. They can be used in the project to test the further processing of the separated CO2 into soda, soda ash or other products by means of electrochemical membrane processes. Soda and soda are basic chemicals that are used in many areas of industry and everyday life (e.g. glass production, cleaning agents, water treatment).\n\nIn addition to the Dresden Fraunhofer IKTS as coordinator, “KlimProMem” involves E.S.C.H. Engineering Service Center und Handel GmbH, Vulcan Energie Ressourcen GmbH and the CIECH Group. With IQONY GmbH and PreZero Energy, the field trials are being carried out at waste treatment plants in Lauta (Saxony) and Zorbau (Saxony-Anhalt). The German Federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF) is supporting the project with around 1.5 million euros over three years.\n\nMore information\n\nwww.frauenhofer.de\n\nSeptember 28, 2023 | Dresden-based start-up “HolyPoly” expands and plans recycling pilot plant\n\nThe Dresden-based start-up “HolyPoly” for innovative plastics recycling has been growing for three years. Now the company is planning a so-called “closed-loop factory” and wants to finance it with a crowdinvesting campaign. Through the recycling pilot plant, the Dresden-based company wants to further expand its competitive advantage.\n\nHolyPoly develops ideas, concepts and processes to fully exploit the potential of recycled plastics: recycling thus creates high-quality products with high utility value and good market opportunities. The start-up's team brings a broad range of expertise to the table in all relevant disciplines, from product development and material selection to sustainable design and manufacturing, logistics and marketing.\n\nThis has made the young company so successful that it is now expanding: A planned production and research center will provide enough space and comprehensive equipment for the upcoming projects. In the closed-loop factory, new plastic recycling cycles are to be developed on an industrial scale. Closed-loop manufacturing is understood as a closed manufacturing and measurement process for an entire value chain in which new data sources collaborate and are connected.\n\nHolyPoly is also breaking new ground in financing the 750,000-euro investment by relying on crowdinvesting. Whereas the company had still been financing its first two rounds by acquiring larger investment sums, investors can now also participate with smaller amounts starting at 100 euros. A corresponding campaign will start in the first week of November.\n\n“When we started three years ago, we would not have expected that we would already realize such extensive projects for renowned brands such as Mattel or Bosch,” says HolyPoly Managing Director Fridolin Pflüger. “But the spectrum of our service offering is obviously unique and the demand for individual recycling solutions very high.”\n\nThe first machines are scheduled to start up in the closed-loop factory this year. The modern hall will then be able to accommodate prototype production, test procedures, material analyses, recycling processes and sample production using the latest technology. The site will be opened as early as October 2, and Saxony's Prime Minister Michael Kretschmer has also announced his attendance.\n\n“It is absurd how many high-quality materials from unused end-of-life products will be destroyed in our waste systems even in 2023 and how old-fashioned recycling still is,” says Fridolin Pflüger. “This has to change, and we are starting to do it at this site.”\n\nMore information\n\nwww.holypoly.co\n\nSeptember 22, 2023 | Is magnesium the key? IFW Dresden receives 1.5 million euros for further development of thermoelectrics?\n\nWhen waste heat from large industrial plants is turned into electricity, the thermoelectric effect is behind it: two unequal temperature levels generate a voltage that enables current to flow and vice versa. This effect has been known for 200 years. And yet the development of the technology has stagnated for half a century. Among other things, because it requires the extremely rare element tellurium. With funding from the European Research Council (ERC), Dr Ran He from the Leibniz Institute is now doing everything he can to overcome this standstill - for example, by replacing tellurium with magnesium.\n\nThere is great potential in thermoelectric technology (TE). If you look at the use of industrial waste heat, for example, this becomes particularly clear: according to the UBA, Germany's central environmental authority, only seven per cent of district heating has been generated from it so far. Yet the theoretical potential of industrial waste heat is about 226 terawatt hours - which is significantly greater than the entire current district heating sales.\n\nThe problem: Until now, most heat-to-electricity converters have required the extremely rare element tellurium. It occurs in less than 0.001 parts per million in the earth's crust - which is why the development of the technology has stagnated for half a century.\n\nDr. Ran He from the Leibniz Institute for Solid State and Materials Research Dresden is researching the solution. As part of the TENTATION project (Tellurium-free Thermoelectric Technology for Near-room-temperature Applications), the physicist is working on the development of a new generation of thermoelectric modules - which are based on the abundant element magnesium instead of tellurium and are intended to surpass the performance of previous technology. This is because, until now, the efficiencies of thermoelectrics have been low compared to other methods of energy generation. \"I am aiming to double the conversion efficiency to about 12 per cent,\" says Ran He, who has been at IFW since 2017. He has just received the \"ERC Starting Grant\" for his work from the ERC, a research grant worth 1.5 million euros.\n\nRan He has his sights set high - but if he actually succeeds in achieving his project goal, he will pave the way for sustainable energy generation and temperature regulation with a wide range of applications based on a long-known principle.\n\nMore information\n\nIFW News\n\nSeptember 19, 2023 | Gigantic direct current measurement facility: Dresden sets new impetus for energy transition\n\nTU Dresden has commissioned a test facility for measuring direct current, the size of which there are only a few of its kind in Germany. Researchers want to use it to answer important questions about the power grids of the future. After all, by 2030, at least 80 percent of our electricity is to come from renewable energies - according to the German government's plan. This also involves converting the power grid from alternating to direct current. This poses special challenges for which solutions are now being developed in Dresden.\n\n\"Electricity highways\": this is the name given to the cable routes that will supply Germany with green electricity in the future. Most of the electricity generated from the sun and wind will be generated in the windy north and east and in large offshore parks off the coasts. However, it is mainly used in the industrially strong southwest and south of Germany. Thick cables are needed to transport it several hundred kilometers across the country - and they are designed for direct current. This is because it is significantly more efficient than alternating current, can be transmitted without major losses, and is virtually predestined for large amounts of electricity and long distances.\n\nThe TU Dresden has its eye on the growing importance of direct current for the future of our power supply: Its high-voltage hall has recently been home to a gigantic measuring system that looks a bit like science fiction with its rings and spheres. It is a good eight meters high, generates voltages of up to 1.2 million volts and cost just under one million euros. The money comes from the large-scale equipment initiative of the German states, which is dedicated to financing large-scale equipment with outstanding, innovative technology.\n\nWith the help of the facility, Dresden University plans to significantly advance research in the field of direct current technology. \"We are grateful that we now have this modern device at our disposal,\" says Stephan Schlegel, acting head of the Chair of High Voltage and High Current Technology. A former DC system from 1994 had become obsolete and was no longer suitable for current research questions. Now Dresden is one of the few research locations in the country where this possibility exists.\n\nVarious research tasks await Stephan Schlegel's team. One involves the cables that will be used for DC voltage in the future: \"We are trying to understand physically what happens in the insulating layer of such a cable, for example,\" explains Schlegel. This layer is much thicker than, for example, in common underground cables for medium voltage. How big does the insulating body have to be? What happens during a lightning discharge? Problems like these can now be investigated with the new test facility. But Schlegel adds that it's not just about the cables, but about all the questions that arise around the technologies for direct voltage and direct current. Schlegel is convinced that precisely this knowledge will become increasingly important in the future: \"Today, we have the technical possibilities to work much more with direct current than in the past.\"\n\nThanks to the new test facility, Dresden is now an important contact when it comes to tomorrow's energy supply.\n\nMore information\n\nAbout TU Dresden\n\n14 September 2023 | Research cluster with TU Dresden: think tank for sustainable recycling management\n\nIn the past, major burdens on the environment emanated from here. Today, the site is a meeting place for sustainable ideas for the future: The research cluster “CircEcon – Green Circular Economy” is being created in the “Schwarze Pumpe” industrial park, which is located in equal parts in Saxony and Brandenburg. Here, four universities are jointly developing new ideas for a greenhouse gas-neutral circular economy. The TU Dresden is also involved. The idea is to bundle expertise along the production chain - starting from materials to production and process technologies to recycling. The project is funded with 108 million euros by the federal government and the state of Saxony.\n\nThe Schwarze Pumpe industrial park in Lusatia is emblematic of the comprehensive transformation from formerly coal-based to renewable energy: what was once the world's largest gas and lignite distribution centre is to be transformed into a green industrial location in the coming years. An important component of this transformation is the circular economy, which plays a central role in the transformation of industry and society.\n\nNow four universities and colleges want to pitch their tents here to establish a research campus for greenhouse gas-neutral recycling management that is unique in Europe. In addition to the TU Dresden, these are the Bergakademie Freiberg, the TU Chemnitz and the Zittau/Görlitz University of Applied Sciences. They have 108 million euros from the federal and state governments at their disposal for this purpose. The interdisciplinary working group wants to focus on the entire value chain from raw material extraction and processing to materials, processes and structures to reuse. The tools of choice: artificial intelligence, digitalisation, energy management and eco-hydrogen.\n\n“Bundling the expertise of the universities and colleges leads to an outstanding pooling of know-how and technology,” says Prof. Ursula M. Staudinger, Rector of TU Dresden. “This allows groundbreaking solutions to be developed for the challenges of the circular economy and at the same time strengthens the region's competitiveness.” Prof. Alexander Kratzsch, Rector of the Zittau/Görlitz University of Applied Sciences, emphasises the project's “international expertise” that leads to “sustainable solutions”. “CircEcon transforms university know-how into industrial innovations and thus directly promotes economic growth,” explains Kratzsch.\n\nThe first important step was taken with the constituent meeting of the CircEcon steering committee. With the help of pilot lines, test facilities and demonstration systems, new ideas for a highly efficient circular economy are now to be developed, tested and brought to market maturity together with companies.\n\nMore information\n\nTU Dresden News\n\nAugust 30, 2023 | Lighting specialists from Dresden solve efficiency problem with OLED displays\n\nWhether smartphone, tablet or television: OLED technology for displays is on the advance.

Such digital meters, called smart meters, can already be found in some private households. The economy, on the other hand, still has some catching up to do. But this may soon be satisfied - thanks to an innovation from Saxony: the Dresden-based Robotron Datenbank-Software GmbH, in cooperation with other partners, has successfully tested digital meters for industry, commerce and large generation plants.\n\nApproximately three quarters of the energy consumed in Germany is recorded by smart metering systems via recording load profile measurement (RLM). However, the number of RLM metering points is still very low at around one percent of the total 53 million metering points in Germany. By the end of 2028, RLM metering points should account for at least 20 percent of all metering points according to the law. Five companies from the industry have joined forces to drive forward the development: E.ON, Netze BW GmbH, Robotron Datenbank-Software GmbH, Power Plus Communications AG and Landis+Gyr GmbH.\n\nTheir innovation: By linking an RLM meter with a smart meter gateway (SMGW), they have realised the intelligent, recording load profile measurement system \"iRLMSys\". In the process, an RLM meter from Landis+Gyr was connected to Robotron's backend system via the CLS interface of PPC's smart meter gateway. The trialled solution is tailored to the specific requirements of industrial customers, which differ significantly from those for normal household customers. The latest trial has shown that the metering system is marketable, offers a high level of security and is available in a timely manner.\n\nA name with tradition\n\nWhen they hear the name Robotron, many people think of the combine from GDR times - and clunky computers from Dresden. And rightly so, because there is actually a lot of history in the Dresden company: Robotron was wound up by the Treuhand in 1990. But Dr. Rolf Heinemann, a leading employee of the former combine, founded Robotron Datenbank-Software GmbH in August 1990 with eight partners and 26 employees. The company's field of activity then as now: the realisation of projects for the effective administration and evaluation of large amounts of data on the basis of database software. Robotron's customers include energy providers. The company makes about two thirds of its turnover with their data management. More than half of all remotely read meters in Germany are now run by a Robotron system, and the company has achieved market leadership. The company, which employs 466 people, is now run by Heinemann's son Ulf Heinemann. Turnover last year was just under 63 million euros - and is expected to rise when the smart metering systems now being tested prove themselves in practice.\n\nAugust 18, 2023 | TU Dresden develops promising HIV blocker\n\nAn important success in AIDS research: scientists from Dresden and the USA have discovered how the HI virus replicates in the body. Three proteins are responsible for this. Now they have synthesized molecules as antagonists to block the invasion. This opens up opportunities for new drugs and therapies - also for other viral diseases and certain types of cancer.\n\nWorldwide, nearly 40 million people are living with HIV, the human immunodeficiency virus. Another 1.5 million are added each year. The virus invades cells, multiplies in them and finally destroys them. As a result, the immune system is significantly weakened.\n\nThe big question that interests researchers worldwide is: How does the virus manage to penetrate the cell nucleus? Scientists at TU Dresden and Touro University in Nevada now have an answer to this question: They have identified three proteins that interact via a signaling pathway and thus open the door to the virus.\n\nThis newly discovered pathway begins with HIV entering the cell wrapped in a membrane package. It pushes the protective envelope around the\n\nthe cell nucleus inward and forms a kind of invagination. The package containing the virus then moves to the tip of this invagination, where the virus slips into the nucleus.\n\nIn order for the virus to make this journey, it relies on the work of proteins: The first of them is located at the envelope of the membrane package, number two at the nuclear membrane, where invasion takes place, and number three finally links the first two proteins together.\n\nThe approach of the Dresden researchers: Invasion of the virus is only possible if all three proteins successfully interact with each other. If the chain is blocked, the virus remains locked out. Together with their American colleagues, they have therefore developed special molecules. What they observed in the laboratory raises great expectations: In the presence of the molecules, the virus was unable to replicate further.\n\nEven though the research is still at an early stage: Based on the new findings, new drugs could be developed for the fight against AIDS. Other diseases in which the transport of particles into the cell nucleus plays a role could also be the target of these therapies. These include other viral diseases and certain types of cancer.\n\nResearch is therefore far from over, as Dr. Denis Corbeil, research group leader at the Biotechnology Center (BIOTEC) of TU Dresden, points out: \"Since this new approach can also be applied to other diseases such as cancer, it is very interesting to further decipher all the molecular players involved.\" So his team continues to work on deciphering molecular processes to pave the way for new therapies in virology and oncology. The start has been made!\n\nMore information\n\nTUD News\n\nAugust 11, 2023 | B2Square and Biofabrik from Dresden want to revolutionize road construction.\n\nFrom one of the biggest emitters in the industry to a CO2 sink - what Frank Albrecht, CEO of B2Square, has in mind for the road construction sector is ambitious. The key? So-called BioBitumen, which serves as a binder for asphalt. It is made from natural raw materials and could soon replace petroleum-based bitumen. Together with the Dresden-based Biofabrik, of which Albrecht is the technical director, the company is now embarking on a global rollout. This makes B2Square the first member of the ImpactFamily, a platform from Biofabrik that aims to help greentech startups achieve a global breakthrough.\n\nConventional bitumen has replaced harmful tar as a binder and is found in virtually all asphalt roads, bridges and parking lots. The problem is that it is based on crude oil and refinery residues. Around 350 kilograms of carbon dioxide are emitted per ton of bitumen. B2Square has found a solution to this. Its bitumen substitute is not only sustainably produced, but also climate-positive because it permanently binds carbon dioxide. This turns one of the biggest emitters in the industry into a CO2 sink. With its innovation, B2Square now wants to ensure green roads worldwide - and is doing so together with Biofabrik from Dresden. The latter recently announced a strategic change of course: Since its founding more than ten years ago, it has dedicated itself to the development of sustainable technologies (WASTX Plastic, WASTX Oil). Now it has launched a new platform, the Impactfamily. It aims to enable hardware startups in the greentech sector to market their ideas globally. Its first member: B2Square. Frank Albrecht, who is also CTO of Biofabrik, says of the partnership: \"As a platform for revolutionary greentech technologies and products, Biofabrik is a very interesting multiplier for our business case. But the collaboration also holds out the prospect of a host of exciting synergies beyond that.\" What makes B2Square's BioBitumen so attractive and unique is that it can be supplied, manufactured and processed in a cold state. That's because all it takes to make the adhesive for roads is synthetic hydrocarbon resin and a viscous cashew nut extract. Both can be mixed with asphalt on site at low temperatures. Petroleum-based bitumen, on the other hand, must be heated to be used for road construction. This is not only energy intensive, but also poses a risk to workers. Hot bitumen is a recurring cause of accidents on construction sites. As a cold instant product, B2Square's BioBitumen thus brings several advantages over the conventional petroleum-based product. Pilot projects around the globe offer a first taste of the disruptive potential of the adhesive for roads. They show how versatile and accessible the product is. Now it's a matter of taking the next step and using the Biofabrik network to win over major road construction projects. A first milestone was recently made public: Strabag, one of the largest road construction companies in Europe, is cooperating with B2Square.\n\nMore informations\n\nNews of the Biofabrik\n\nAbout Biofabrik\n\nAbout B2Square\n\nJuly 28, 2023 | Dresden researchers advance superfast neural computer\n\nThey are small, powerful and indispensable for many everyday tasks: computer processors. In certain areas of application, however, they have so far struggled to recognise patterns in large data streams and to grasp their complexity. And they consume a lot of energy. So-called neuromorphic computers are superior to them. Researchers at the Helmholtz Centre Dresden-Rossendorf (HZDR) have now taken this technology a big step forward.\n\nToday's computers break down tasks in their processors and memories into long sequences of zeros and ones. They then compare them with elementary logical operations, adding and subtracting them. This binary logic and digital computing technology can solve most maths problems faster than any human. But: in many areas of automation, industry is currently struggling with fast data transmission. Examples are autonomous driving, the Internet of Things or edge computing, i.e. data processing at the edge of a network. Here, sensors deliver small data packets at high speed. Recognising patterns in them is very energy-intensive for contemporary computer architectures. The solution for the researchers at the HZDR: spin waves, also called magnons.\n\nThe idea of using magnons to create a new data processing technology is somewhat older. But the HZDR team's work has solved a problem that was hindering practical implementation. All previous concepts rely on the fact that spin waves have to propagate from A to B in order to be manageable. But so far there are no really suitable materials for this. The Dresdeners now took a different approach: they shifted the entire process into a magnetic disc only a few micrometres thick and set it oscillating. Now the whole body vibrates, simultaneously at different frequencies. You can imagine it like a drum: If you sprinkle sand on a drum and beat it rhythmically, patterns emerge. These are modes of vibration. And they exist in the entire space. So they don't move from A to B. They are standing waves that exist resonantly on the entire body. The knocking of the drum is the data input, which can come from a sensor, for example. It causes an interplay of different vibrations and resulting non-linear processes. Because the processes are similar to those in the human brain, the new technology is also called \"neuromorphic computing\".\n\nFrom the researchers' point of view, the new, extremely energy-efficient technology is not intended to replace existing computers, but to complement them. One possible field of application is traffic optimisation. For neuromorphic computers could search the mountain of data provided by services such as Google in combination with smartphones and cars for patterns and predict a traffic jam before the first car has even stopped. This is a highly complex matter that conventional computer architectures like PCs struggle with enormously. They need many computing steps. For neuromorphic computing, on the other hand, it is the ideal field of application. Intelligent maintenance could also benefit from neuromorphic computers. In wind turbines, for example, they could look for vibration patterns in the drive shafts that indicate bearing damage. This would make maintenance possible before the bearing even fails. That saves money, energy and resources.\n\nMore informations\n\nPress release of the HZDR\n\nArticle in the news portal Oiger\n\nJuly 20, 2023 | New center for semiconductor metrology in Dresden: For more precision, quality and efficiency.\n\nThey are built into laptops and smartphones, cars and washing machines, and are a key driver of digitalization: we are talking about semiconductors. In order to further advance semiconductor research and to target the next milestones in development, Dresden's Fraunhofer IPMS and Applied Materials are now joining forces. In the heart of Silicon Saxony, at the Center Nanoelectronic Technologies (CNT) of the Fraunhofer IPMS, one of the largest technology centers for semiconductor metrology and process analysis in Europe is to be established.\n\nMeasurement technology, also known as metrology, is of fundamental importance in the manufacture of microchips. This is because precise measurements enable the quality of individual steps and processes in manufacturing to be accurately monitored, controlled and thus continuously refined. Applied Materials manufactures state-of-the-art measuring equipment for the semiconductor industry, while Fraunhofer IPMS is Germany's leading research center for semiconductors on 300mm. In the new technology center, they now combine their competencies and work together to comprehensively accelerate developments in the field of semiconductor metrology and optimize process steps. New methods, algorithms and software will be developed and tested in the technology hub.\n\n\"This unique center of excellence will be able to test and qualify processes on a wide range of substrate materials and wafer thicknesses that are critical for applications in the diverse European semiconductor landscape,\" explains James Robson, corporate vice president for Applied Materials Europe. Dr. Benjamin Uhlig-Lilienthal, head of the Next Generation Computing business unit at Fraunhofer IPMS adds that his institution and other partners will benefit from \"access to Applied's industry-leading eBeam metrology systems.\" These include major chip manufacturers such as Globalfoundries, with whom Fraunhofer IPMS works closely, as well as smaller and external companies that conduct joint research with the institute. As a meeting place for industry and science, the technology center in Dresden thus brings with it the potential to be an important driver for the semiconductor industry in Europe and to play a significant role in shaping digitization.\n\nMore information\n\nFraunhofer IPMS Press Release\n\nAbout Fraunhofer IPMS\n\nAbout Applied Materials\n\nJuly 18, 2023 | Hydrogel wound dressings from Dresden promise cure for chronic open wounds\n\nAfter ten years of research: clinical trials for the novel high-tech wound dressing ResCure, developed by scientists at the Leibniz Institute of Polymer Research Dresden e.V. (IPF), will soon begin. The new dressing could solve a major problem: Unlike previous wound dressings, the hydrogel-coated wound dressing tackles the cause of open wounds instead of just reacting to the symptoms.\n\nNormally, the human body has the ability to heal wounds on the skin or mucous membranes itself within a short time. Unfortunately, however, this does not always work, for example if the affected person suffers from a circulatory disorder, a weakened immune system or diabetes. If wounds do not heal after one to three months despite treatment, they are called chronic. In Germany alone, around 900,000 people are currently affected. Giving them hope for a cure was the goal of the IPF researchers.\n\nThe hydrogel wound dressings they developed have a very special property that sets them apart from other wound dressings. Until now, excessive or chronic inflammatory processes that prevent wound healing could only be treated with systemic drugs. On the one hand, these often bring side effects and on the other hand, they are only effective to a limited extent.\n\nThe novel technology, on the other hand, combats inflammatory processes directly at their cause and can thus dissolve them. For this purpose, the researchers have developed polymer networks from derivatives of the glycosaminoglycan heparin and branched polyethylene glycol, which function like a \"molecular sponge\" and can absorb pro-inflammatory signal molecules from the wound and inactivate them. At the same time, they leave signalling molecules that promote wound healing largely in the wound.\n\nThe new therapy concept has already been successfully tested in animal models and on human wound secretions. And \"extremely successfully\", as Prof. Dr. Carsten Werner from the IPF emphasised in an interview with the Sächsische Zeitung. According to the study, wound healing is fifty percent faster than with standard therapies.\n\nThe clinical trial with around 100 patients is expected to run until the beginning of 2024. If everything goes according to plan, a company producing the ResCure hydrogel wound dressings could be founded as early as the beginning of 2025.\n\nJuly 14, 2023 | Predictable batteries: Dresden engineers extend life cycles of rechargeable batteries\n\nThe car is slow to start, the laptop won't boot up. Who hasn't experienced it: Batteries with a weak age can make life difficult for us. But there is often more to batteries than meets the eye. The Dresden-based company NOVUM engineering has developed a novel process that uses AI to check batteries in order to use them more efficiently and for longer. This saves a lot of time, money and emissions. For its development, the company won the State’s prize for Innovation this year.\n\nBatteries are a black box for many. Because until now, their state of charge has only been estimated. No one knows exactly how long they will last or when they will break. As a result, batteries are often used inefficiently. According to the German Federal Environment Agency, batteries require up to 500 times more energy to manufacture than they later make available. If they are used incorrectly or are subject to severe temperature fluctuations, performance is further compromised. Under the right conditions, however, they can be used for much longer and recycled for a second or even third life cycle. This is highly relevant not only for private consumers, but also for industries. Efficient batteries are a key issue in e-mobility, for example. The aim here is to use the expensive batteries, which require a lot of energy to produce, for as long as possible.\n\nBut how long do rechargeable batteries actually last? How large is their capacity really? And how much energy is still contained at the end of a life cycle? Engineers at NOVUM engineering can now determine these questions precisely and in seconds with their innovative process. They have developed a process that is unique in the world to date for making reliable statements about the condition, capacity and service life of batteries. And they can do this for all types of batteries and battery storage systems of any size, from smaller lithium batteries to LFP batteries installed in cars, mobile homes or motorboats, and even large-scale storage systems in industrial companies.\n\nSmart monitoring uses patented technology and AI-based processes to completely scan and monitor batteries. The AI needs just 90 seconds to test the condition of batteries used in industry, for example. The data collected in the process is uploaded to the NOVUM cloud and analyzed using neural networks. In this way, the state of charge can be determined precisely for the first time. Monitoring takes place on site or remotely via data transfers, as required. For example, a fleet management company can have its vehicle batteries conveniently checked via a mobile service tool.\n\nWith the precise assessment of the batteries, so-called predictive maintenance, operations can adjust their usage behavior and derive the ideal use of the battery. This saves a lot of energy, emissions and costs. Large-scale storage systems can be operated more economically and fast-charging processes for small electrical appliances can be optimized. Used batteries are given a second or even third life cycle thanks to diagnostics. This can save up to 90 percent of recycling costs.\n\nBattery storage and its optimization are essential for the energy transition - and NOVUM engineering has found a way to make batteries more predictable and durable. The company has already received several awards for its innovative process, including High-Tech Startup Europe 2017 and, most recently, first place at the Saxony Innovation Award 2023.\n\nMore information\n\nNOVUM Engineering\n\nSaxon Innovation Award\n\nJuly 11, 2023 | Spectral analysis: When the washing machine saves the cashmere jumper\n\nWhat's in the wool programme again? And is 40 degrees enough to get the stain out of the blouse? These are questions that we will perhaps be able to leave to our washing machine in a few years' time - thanks to the \"scanning mirror microspectrometer\" (SMMS) that has just been developed at the Fraunhofer Institute for Photonic Microsystems in Dresden. But of course, much more is possible with them than error-free laundry.\n\nThe Fraunhofer Institute for Photonic Microsystems IPMS aims to develop pioneering technological solutions and bring them into application. Also in the field of optical sensor technology. Here, the institute presented a demonstrator for the first time this year that uses spectral analysis to detect which materials textiles are made of.\n\nLight is sent onto a sample, reflected back from it and split into its spectral components. The chemical composition of the sample, from the garment to the food, changes the emitted rays so that information can be read out about it - for example, whether a jumper is really made of cashmere or an apple is already ripe enough to eat.\n\nIn Dresden, several players are working on such technology, such as \"Hiperscan\" and \"Senorics\". In the \"Sensorics\" system, the splitting is done by means of an arrangement of 16 sensor elements, each with a set spectral sensitivity. This achieves a moderate resolution that is sufficient for simple determinations such as the differentiation of textiles. \"Hiperscan\" and the \"Scanning Mirror Microspectrometer\" (SMMS) of the Fraunhofer Institute for Photonic Microsystems, on the other hand, rely on splitting the light at a diffraction grating, which allows for better resolution and more precise measurements.\n\nThe technology opens up all kinds of possibilities. Taking the value chain of textiles as an example, from material testing when buying new clothes to care, where the need for cleaning could be determined by analysing the dirt particles and the appropriate washing programme could be selected. This could enable older people in particular to manage their daily lives independently for longer. In textile recycling, the system could sort textiles by colour and material. Other areas of application would be, for example, the freshness testing of food, the sorting of plastic objects during recycling or the determination of the type and concentration of raw materials in pharmacy.\n\nWith SMMS, the recognition rates are further improved by combining them with artificial intelligence. In addition, the combination with AI software enables the development of \"intelligent\" overall systems. There are still development steps to be taken, such as reducing production costs, but smartphones with built-in microspectrometers could be possible in the future.\n\nMore Information\n\nFraunhofer IPMS\n\nJuly 5, 2023 | Revolutionary speaker technology from Dresden makes smart headphones possible\n\nWhat we still need our smartphones for today, intelligent in-ear headphones with a direct Internet interface could do in the future. Until now, however, the technology for suitable loudspeakers has been lacking – because they not only have to be small, compact and energy-saving, but also able to reach the 120 decibel volume required by the market. Researchers from Dresden have now received the Joseph von Fraunhofer Prize 2023 for the development of just such micro loudspeakers.\n\nMaking calls, playing music, having the latest e-mails read to you or making bank transfers: Our headphones could soon do all these things for us. Simply by voice command. Because the new speaker technology is so space- and energy-saving that it can fit an entire smartphone in the headphones. That's still a long way off – and when it will be depends on the technological development of various components.\n\nHowever, the Dresden team led by Dr. Bert Kaiser and Dr. Sergiu Langa from Fraunhofer IPMS and Holger Conrad from Bosch Sensortec GmbH has now succeeded in taking a decisive step toward the future: The loudspeakers they have developed meet all the conditions to form the previously missing core for intelligent in-ear headphones: They can be manufactured inexpensively using microelectronics technologies and manage the 120 decibels without high energy requirements.\n\nThe development was successful due to two novel scientific approaches: On the one hand, a completely new design of the loudspeaker, which is not based on a vertically deflectable diaphragm as usual, but in which the sound-displacing elements are located vertically in a silicon chip. And on the other hand, on a new drive technology for these elements, the Nano e-drive actuators, which make the sound generation possible in the first place.\n\nIn awarding the Joseph von Fraunhofer Prize to Kaiser, Langa and Conrad, the jury recognized, among other things, “the scientifically and technologically comprehensive approach to the development of a novel sound transducer concept.”\n\nIn order to market the loudspeakers, Arioso Systems GmbH was founded in 2019 as a spin-off of the Fraunhofer IPMS and the research work at the Brandenburg University of Technology Cottbus-Senftenberg. Last summer, Arioso Systems GmbH was acquired by Bosch Sensortec GmbH. The common goal of all players: to develop cutting-edge products for the global mass market based on loudspeaker technology.\n\nMore information\n\nIPMS News\n\nJune 23, 2023 | More than 600 guests at the 17th Silicon Saxony Day in Dresden\n\nDresden is the heart of the German semiconductor industry. This was once again impressively demonstrated at the 17th Silicon Saxony Day: More than 600 industry representatives, sector experts and researchers from 20 countries met at Dresden Airport on June 21 to discuss the future of the location. The focus was on financial resources from the EU Chips Act and the IPCEI (Important Project of Common European Interest) program. In addition, figures on the continuous growth of the industry in and around Dresden were presented.\n\nIn 2022, around 76,100 people were employed in Saxony's microelectronics and ICT sector. The figures do not yet include the announced increase in personnel from companies that are currently expanding their capacities and commitment in Saxony. Compared to 2021, the industry grew by 4.2 percent. According to Frank Bösenberg, managing director of the Silicon Saxony industry association, it is assumed that \"in 2030, around 100,000 employees in Silicon Saxony will be working on the latest developments in many demanding professions that will make our everyday lives easier and more sustainable.\" The picture is similar in Saxony's software industry, which grew by 7.6 percent year-on-year and currently employs more than 35,000 people.\n\nWith its investments, the European Commission is strengthening the microelectronics and semiconductor sector and creating investment and planning security for the industry. Semiconductors are a key technology in climate protection: In photovoltaic cells, they generate electricity from light; in converters, they convert energy in such a way that it can be transmitted to the power grid with minimal loss. Semiconductors make drives more efficient, monitor the various systems involved in the energy chain in sensors, and network sustainable energy generation and consumers with each other via the Internet of Things so that supply and demand are optimally matched. However, their production also consumes considerable resources. That is why the players along the entire semiconductor value chain are intensifying their efforts to make microchip production itself more sustainable.\n\nMore information\n\nSilicon Saxony News\n\n20 June 2023 | Smart measurement methods from Dresden against heat islands in the city\n\nIt is getting hotter and hotter: Since the 1950s, the number of days a year when the average temperature in Germany is at least 30 degrees has tripled. Large cities in particular heat up strongly in summer. So-called heat islands are a serious health hazard and cause a lot of damage due to burst asphalt surfaces. This is where the KLIPS project comes in, in which two research institutes and several companies from Dresden are involved. The aim is to localise heat islands so that the findings can be taken into account when planning neighbourhoods.\n\nKLIPS stands for \"AI-based information platform for the localisation and simulation of heat islands for innovative urban and traffic planning\". As part of the research project, sensors record temperature and humidity. An AI determines from the measured values how the temperature is distributed in the city. Applications for improved management of overheating are then created on this basis. Instead of relying on expensive meteorological standard sensors, a project team developed new types of urban climate sensors. The Dresden companies ERGO Umwelttechnik GmbH, PIKOBYTES GmbH, Contronix GmbH, the Institut für Luft- und Kältetechnik (ILK) and Leibniz-Institut für ökologische Raumentwicklung e. V. Dresden are involved. Steffen Rietzschel, Head of the Office of Economic Development: \"We are thus developing use cases that create added value for citizens and at the same time open up business models for the participating companies.\" The research project is funded with 2.3 million euros by the Federal Ministry for Digital Affairs and Transport and is accompanied in the state capital by the EU project MatchUP.\n\nAfter a successful test phase, around 300 sensors are currently being installed in the city. From summer onwards, they will measure climatic behaviour at representative locations such as the Großer Garten. At selected sensor locations, citizens can inform themselves about measurements and the project on information boards. The special feature of the project is the \"swarm sensor technology\", i.e. the use of a local sensor network that provides the measurement data via a data interface. The sensor data, which are based on the standards of the German Weather Service, enable improved microclimatic recording of overheating in the city. They are also used for training and operating specific AI models that analyse and forecast the temperature distribution in the city.\n\nThe researchers expect the models to deliver results by the end of summer or early autumn. After that, the assessment and evaluation will begin. If the data quality is sufficient, those involved in the project want to produce maps of Dresden's overheating as early as this year. By next summer at the latest, the first information should be available for urban planning and the public.\n\nFurther applications are already being considered: for example, the data will provide real-time heat reports in the future and improve the daily information on hot and cool spaces in the city, so that more attention is paid to heat development. The insights gained should also support future city planning and thus prevent overheating. Finally, the heat sensors can help monitor the long-term effects of construction measures.\n\n15 June 2023 | Team of Dresden researchers discovers possible therapeutic approach for ALS\n\nEvery year, about 2,500 people in Germany fall ill with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) - a neurodegenerative disease of the Motoneurons. So far, there is no treatment for ALS; the disease usually leads to death within two to five years. An interdisciplinary team of researchers from the Helmholtz Centre Dresden-Rossendorf (HZDR) and the Technical University of Dresden has now found a possible therapeutic approach to cure ALS.\n\nMotoneurons are certain nerve cells located in the brain and spinal cord that are responsible for controlling the muscles. ALS destroys these Motoneurons so that the muscles no longer receive instructions, can no longer work and fade away. Patients are often dependent on a wheelchair. In the later course of the disease, they also have difficulty speaking and swallowing. In the final stage, paralysis of the respiratory muscles also occurs, leading to death. The research team around physicist Dr. Thomas Herrmannsdörfer and cell biologist Dr. Arun Pal from the HZDR and medical scientist Prof. Richard Funk from TU Dresden succeeded in reprogramming skin cells from both healthy people and ALS patients into Motoneurons in the laboratory. The Motoneurons prepared in this way were then exposed to magnetic fields of different strengths for different periods of time. The series of experiments showed that the motor neurons of the ALS patients responded to the magnetic fields: The transport of mitochondria - the \"power plants\" of the cell - and other cell components was reactivated by stimulation with magnetic fields. In addition, the cells' ability to grow and network again was restored.\n\nFrom the researchers' point of view, the results are a first milestone. The scientists are now planning long-term and in vivo studies, i.e. in the living organism, to further expand the therapeutic potential of magnetic field treatments. They also want to investigate how the cell changes of other neurodegenerative diseases such as Parkinson's, Huntington's disease and Alzheimer's react to stimulation with magnetic fields. In the long term, clinical pilot studies with special devices for magnetic stimulation are planned.\n\nMore information\n\nHZDR News\n\n31 May 2023 | Dresden researchers co-invent pill that detects vulnerabilities in machines and people\n\nMachine broken? Man sick? Pill popped, error found! Impedance spectroscopy is not quite as simple as its cumbersome name suggests. But in principle, the picture with the pill comes very close to what researchers at the Fraunhofer Institute IZM have invented in cooperation with Micro Systems Technologies (MST) and Dresden-based Sensry GmbH: a waterproof Internet-of-Things sensor, as small as a candy, that reliably measures the properties of liquids even in hard-to-reach places, making the maintenance of industrial machines much easier and even helping to identify diseases.\n\nThe larger an industrial machine, the longer it takes to detect an unwanted deviation in oil pressure or even a leak from the outside in the event of a malfunction. The result: production downtime and high costs. The detection of the causes of illness in humans is similar: if the stomach hurts, a complex gastroscopy or colonoscopy is usually required.\n\nThis is where electrochemical impedance spectroscopy can help. It detects changes in materials or liquids, which can be an indication of the corrosion of a component or even a certain disease. Until now, such impedance analyzers have not been small and mobile enough to be used in this way. Fraunhofer IZM, with the support of MST and the Dresden-based company Sensry, has now developed a compact and modular IoT sensor for these applications that can measure impedances and transmit them wirelessly, waterproof and biomedically compatible.\n\nAt just 11 by 16 square millimeters, the sensor combines the two necessary electrodes with numerous components for analyzing environmental properties, making it the world's smallest impedance spectroscopy sensor! In addition to temperature, pressure, humidity and sound in the environment, the tiny multi-talent can also record its own acceleration behavior, rotation, light, colors or ambient noise. The data is transmitted wirelessly to a specially developed software with a web interface for PC and smartphone. If a point is reached where the pressure or fluid spectrum deviates from the norm, this is an indication of a problem cause.\n\nThe possibilities of electrochemical impedance spectroscopy for medical technology are far from exhausted and research into this is in full swing, including in Dresden!\n\nMore information: Fraunhofer Tech News\n\nMay 23, 2023 | Rock Cellar Laboratory in Dresden: High-tech research at a depth of 40 meters\n\nAfter years of development work, researchers from the Institute of Nuclear and Particle Physics (TU Dresden) and the Institute of Radiation Physics (HZDR) have made it: one of the most sensitive experimental setups in the world goes into operation, and research at a depth of 40 meters can begin. In the laboratory, which is hewn into a tunnel, exotic reactions of particles are provoked and observed. No less than the most powerful processes in the universe are at stake: the Big Bang, neutron stars and dark matter.\n\nA very special place in the underground laboratory is occupied by Germany's most sensitive measuring instrument, which attracts researchers from all over the world to Dresden. It can analyze samples of substances and materials with a radioactivity in the range of 100 microbequerels, which corresponds to just one hundredth of the radioactivity present in the human body.\n\nThis requires a low-radiation environment, such as that provided by the Felsenkeller brewery's former ice storage facility. Around 40 meters of rock wall shield the apparatus from cosmic radiation. In addition, a four-ton protective layer of special concrete, lead and copper ensures that the natural radioactivity of the rock does not influence the measurement results.\n\nAnd why all this effort? A central component of the research in the rock cellar laboratory is rare nuclear transformations in elements such as those that occurred at the very beginning of our universe. In the laboratory, scientists from all over the world are investigating central questions of astrophysics, such as what darkl matter is made of. Only five percent of the universe is known to us, the so-called \"normal matter\". Galaxies, stars, planets, the things of our everyday life and also we humans belong to it. Dark matter, on the other hand, is largely a mystery. Current estimates assume that it makes up 70 to 80 percent of the universe! Nevertheless, almost nothing is known about its properties, only its gravity reveals them. The Dresden Felsenkeller Laboratory has all the prerequisites to become one of the world's central research facilities for determining this mysterious substance.\n\nRead more\n\nAbout the Institute for Nuclear and Particle Physics (TUD)\n\nAbout the Institute for Radiation Physics (HZDR)\n\n12 May 2023 | Sweet bone healing turbo from Dresden\n\nAs we age, our bodies become less able to renew our bones and keep them strong. However, as we humans grow older, research has long been searching for new therapies to improve bone regeneration. An interdisciplinary team from Dresden has now achieved a breakthrough: scientists from the Biotechnology Center (BIOTEC), the Medical Faculty and the Max Bergmann Center for Biomaterials (MBC) at TU Dresden have developed novel bioinspired molecules that improve bone regeneration in mice – and perhaps soon in humans.\n\nUsing computer models and simulations, the team from Dresden developed novel bioinspired molecules that can be incorporated into biomaterials and thus delivered locally to bone defects. The novel molecules are based on glycosaminoglycans, long-chain sugars such as hyaluronic acid or heparin – a sweet solution as a bone healing turbo!\n\nThe key to success here was the interdisciplinary approach and close collaboration between the various research institutions. “Thanks to the work of our group and others, we know a specific molecular pathway that regulates bone formation and repair,” explains Prof. Lorenz Hofbauer from the Medical Faculty of TU Dresden. “We were able to narrow it down to two brake signals that work together to block bone regeneration.” The major challenge for developing drugs to improve bone healing, he said, is now to simultaneously and efficiently turn off these two blocking proteins.\n\n“For years, we have used the power of computer simulation to study how proteins that regulate bone formation interact with their receptors,” says Prof. Maria Teresa Pisabarro of the Biotechnology Center (BIOTEC). The team at Prof. Hofbauer's “Bone Lab” eventually used biomaterials loaded with these molecules on bone defects in mice to test their effectiveness. In the process, the materials loaded with the new molecules proved to be significantly more effective than standard biomaterials, increasing bone healing by up to 50 percent, indicating tremendous regenerative potential!\n\n“For each molecule, we were then able to measure how strongly it binds to the proteins as well as how it interferes with the binding of the proteins to their natural receptors,” says PD Dr. Vera Hintze of the Max Bergmann Center for Biomaterials. “In this way, we were able to empirically show how effectively they thereby switch off the inhibitory proteins.” Hofbauer's group tested the biological relevance of these interaction studies in a cell culture model and later in mice.\n\nThe results are of great value with considerable clinical relevance , to serve as a blueprint for the development of novel and better molecules in the future. Not only will this minimize animal testing. The newly developed molecules could also be used, for example, to knock out proteins that block bone regeneration - and lead to the development of new, more effective therapies for fractures and other bone diseases.\n\nLearn more:\n\nTU Dresden News\n\nMay 3 2023 | “Europe’s digital lighthouse”: Groundbreaking ceremony for Infineon’s billion-euro project in Dresden\n\nThe symbolic groundbreaking ceremony for the new Infineon chip plant in the Saxon capital was attended by a host of political VIPs – from EU Commission President Ursula von der Leyen to German Chancellor Olaf Scholz, Saxony’s Prime Minister Michael Kretschmer, Economics Minister Martin Dulig and Dresden’s Lord Mayor Dirk Hilbert. Great hopes rest on the project; after all, nothing less than Europe’s technological sovereignty is at stake.\n\n“Dresden is a digital beacon for Europe,” congratulated Ursula von der Leyen, who had come all the way from Brussels to attend the groundbreaking ceremony for the Infineon Smart Power Fab. She said it was great news that Infineon was investing massively in semiconductor production “in times of geopolitical risks.” Because any disruption to trade would “hit our internal market hard,” the EU Commission president warned, referring, for example, to the current tensions between China and Taiwan. “That's why we need more mass production in semiconductors again,” von der Leyen said. “And that’s why Dresden is so important!”\n\nGerman Chancellor Olaf Scholz emphasized that Germany not only welcomes and supports the EU Chips Act, but is also “filling it with life.” The EU member states would invest up to 43 billion euros in the coming years to double the global share of chip production “made in Europe” to 20 percent. Against this background, the Chancellor hinted that Infineon’s investment “will not be the last major investment we see in Silicon Saxony.”\n\nInfineon CEO Jochen Hanebeck also looked to the future: “Together, we are driving decarbonization and digitalization.” Starting in 2026, power semiconductors based on 300-millimeter manufacturing technology, which are needed for electricity meters and smart meter systems, wind turbines or charging columns, are to be produced in Dresden. The Munich-based group is investing five billion euros in the new factory, the largest single investment in the company’s history. And it will pay off, Hanebeck is sure: “Global semiconductor demand will grow strongly and continuously in view of the high demand for renewable energies, data centers and electromobility.” The plant is expected to create around 1,000 new jobs in Dresden and the surrounding area.\n\nThe great importance for the region was also demonstrated by the fact that Minister President Kretschmer and Economics Minister Dulig flew in specially by helicopter to be on site in time from the joint cabinet meeting with Bavaria from Munich – an extremely rare measure, according to the state chancellery.\n\nMore information: Infineon news\n\nMay 2nd, 2023 | New era for medical electronics begins in Dresden\n\nA globally unique research cluster will start work in Dresden next month. SEMECO's ambitious goal is to bring innovative medical technology into use much faster than before for the benefit of patients. To this end, institutes, the chip industry and medical technology manufacturers in and around Dresden are pooling their expertise to develop intelligent chips specifically for medical applications. The aim is to reduce long approval loops and significantly increase the pace of innovation in the medical field.\n\nThe project is based at the Else Kröner Fresenius Center for Digital Health (EKFS), with TU Dresden responsible for coordination. Financial support of 45 million euros is available from the federal government through Clusters4Future , supplemented by another 17 million euros from the Free State of Saxony. Depending on the size of the project, further funding from industry is to be added.\n\nThe cluster addresses one of the biggest problems in medical technology: obsolete electronics. Chips usually have to be assembled from other industrial sectors to create special medical applications - which costs time and money. Compared to the latest cell phones, for example, the backlog is usually ten to 20 years. \"In principle, what we find in medicine is always ancient technology,\" says project leader Gerhard Fettweis, institute director and professor of communications engineering at TU Dresden.\n\nNew chip technologies made in Dresden and developed specifically for medicine are expected to turn things around. \"Instead of kits the size of a shoebox, everything is to be shrunk down to a chip,\" reports EKFS Director Prof. Jochen Hampe, co-leader of the major project. This paves the way for completely new, miniaturized implants, sensors for analysis as well as evaluation, control and communication with other devices - \"all combined in one piece of silicon,\" Hampe enthuses. In order to also drastically reduce the number of chips used, the Dresden engineers, doctors and chip companies are focusing on medical modules. The automotive industry serves as a model here: \"This is our niche, our innovation gap,\" says Prof. Jochen Hampe.\n\nFor Dresden, as the coordinating center of the cluster, a unique opportunity is opening up to lead medical technology into the future. In addition to the TU and the EKFS, the 5G-Lab Germany and the Barkhausen Institute are other Dresden players participating in the project. In the first three years alone, those responsible expect up to half a dozen start-ups to emerge from the project. Up to 150 employees are expected to work at SEMECO itself.\n\nLearn more: saechsische.de (in german, paywall)\n\nApril 24, 2023 | Dresden Salamander Study: Zombie cells not as evil as thought!\n\nSo-called senescent cells - also known as \"zombie cells\" - have long been associated with aging and disease. The reason: unlike healthy cells, they stop dividing. A new study by the Center for Regenerative Therapies Dresden (CRTD) at TU Dresden now paints a different picture: using experiments on salamanders, the Dresden researchers demonstrated that the supposed zombie cells can also play a positive role in regeneration.\n\nSalamanders have unique regenerative abilities and can regrow organs in their bodies, including lost limbs. \"They are one of the few species that seem to resist the natural aging process,\" says research leader Dr. Maximina H. Yun. \"They don't show typical signs of aging and don't develop age-related diseases such as cancer.\" The research team wanted to know whether this was linked to the presence of senescent cells - with surprising results!\n\nTo this end, the Dresden scientists found a way to modulate the number of senescent cells in the wound. Astonishing: If more zombie cells were present in the wound, the animals developed a larger regeneration bud, a so-called blastema. This refers to a collection of cells that forms all the necessary tissue for the new limb. The larger the blastema, the more cells are available for the regrowth of the limb - and the faster the regeneration process. The physicians explain this phenomenon with special signal substances of the zombie cells. These apparently stimulate neighboring muscle tissue to regress - also known as de-differentiation in technical jargon. In the next step, they can both proliferate themselves and differentiate into new muscle cells, thus promoting the regeneration process.\n\nSenes cells are an important key to better understanding the principles of the regeneration process. Drugs could be developed to delay, halt or at least make the aging process more comfortable. Even new strategies against cancer are conceivable. An answer to whether and how the self-healing abilities of the salamander can be transferred to humans has yet to be found. It remains exciting!\n\nAbout the Yun-Group at CRTD: Yun-Group\n\nApril 21, 2023 | Fabric batteries to give e-cars more range\n\nBatteries for electric cars need to become more resource-efficient! To this end, researchers at the TU Dresden and the Fraunhofer Institute for Organic Electronics, Electron Beam and Plasma Technology (FEP) are developing novel energy storage systems that are partly made of textile materials. In the \"revoLect\" project, they are pooling their expertise with other partners from industry and business to develop a suitable process by summer 2025. The fabric design makes it possible to increase the energy density of lithium-ion batteries - which in turn increases the range of electric cars. In addition, less copper and aluminum are needed for production compared to conventional processes.\n\nThe starting point for all this is two different types of fabric, which are being developed in parallel: Porcher Industries Germany GmbH, based in southern Germany, specializes in manufacturing fabrics from glass fibers. The Institute for Textile Machinery and Textile High Performance Materials Technology at the Technical University of Dresden (ITM) is researching ultralight carbon fabric, which is being tested as a carrier material for the electrodes. Which of the two types of material will ultimately prevail has not yet been decided.\n\nAnother development focus is the use of pure silicon as anode material. Anodes in lithium-ion batteries consist of a current conductor and an active material applied to it, predominantly graphite, in which energy is stored in the form of chemical bonds. This is where the specialists at Fraunhofer FEP come in: they specialize in particularly fast processes for coating the fabric electrodes with silicon in a roll-to-roll system.\n\nLithium-ion batteries are among the key technologies for e-mobility and are thus indispensable for the energy transition. Already, around 16 percent of newly registered passenger cars in Germany have an electric drive - and demand is rising rapidly! In addition, the demand for batteries for smartphones, laptops, electric bicycles and stationary energy storage is also increasing. Together with their project partners, the Dresden researchers are working at full speed on a sustainable solution that will contribute to the success of the energy transition.\n\nLearn more:\n\nFraunhofer news\n\nAbout The Institute for Textile Machinery and Textile High Performance Materials Technology at the Technical University of Dresden (ITM)\n\nAbout Fraunhofer FEP\n\nApril 19, 2023 | Dresden researchers develop new therapy against leukemia virus\n\nIt is closely related to HIV, less well known, but similarly dangerous: the HTLV-1 virus. With the help of the TU Dresden, a group of researchers has succeeded in cutting out the so-called HTLV-1 virus from the DNA of infected cells. To do this, they used a gene scissor developed for this purpose. Unlike the well-known CRIsPR-Cas9 gene scissors, these are based on an enzyme called recombinase. Specifically, it is the designer recombinase RecHTLV, which was produced under laboratory conditions. It docks at the interface between the virus and the human DNA, separates them from each other and in this way reverses the infection. In cells in which the virus had not yet fully integrated, the gene scissors were also able to massively complicate the infection.\n\nThe HTLV-1-Virus causes aggressive forms of leukemia, an incurable spinal cord disease that leads to paralysis, and other inflammatory diseases. Between 10 and 20 million people worldwide are infected with the HTLV-1 virus, which is passed on mainly through sexual contact or via breast milk. Of those infected, ten percent develop the disease. The successful use of gene scissors technology in the laboratory is a first but important step on the way to containing the virus.\n\nThe findings must now be further intensively researched outside the laboratory: \"We have already achieved continuous improvements with designer recombinases with regard to the HI virus - now it is important to further adapt RecHTLV for the HTLV-1 virus, which also belongs to the retroviruses and therefore ticks in a very similar way,\" explains Prof. Frank Buchholz from TU Dresden. In addition to the Dresden university, biotech company Provirex Genome Editing Therapies and Nuremberg-based university Friedrich-Alexander-Universität Erlangen-Nürnberg also contributed to the success of the project.\n\nLearn more:\n\nTU Dresden news\n\nMDR\n\nAbout TU Dresden: TU Dresden\n\nMarch 31, 2023 | New radar system from Dresden's Fraunhofer IZM enables fast help in nursing care\n\nIf an elderly person falls in their own home, fast help is needed. A new radar system from the Fraunhofer Institute for Reliability and Microintegration (IZM) in Dresden provides just that. The new technology also assists in the search for lost objects and helps improve individual care in the long term. The system was developed with partners from Berlin and Oldenburg as part of the OMNICONNECT project funded by the German Federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF).\n\nIn an innovative way, the technology provides people in need of care with both more safety and more self-determination in everyday life: Four radar modules record the entire room and use artificial intelligence to detect dangerous situations. They interact with transponders known as tags, which are attached to movable objects or clothing. Each of these tags has its own target frequency, thanks to which it can be identified by the system. Depending on how long a tag's response to the system takes, this suggests the location of the object or person.\n\nThe radar modules are integrated into a ceiling lamp, which is why the system is hardly noticed in everyday life. Privacy is also maintained: instead of images, movement patterns are recorded, which are evaluated on site with the help of an adaptable integrated circuit (FPGA) and forwarded to the OFFIS computer science institute at the University of Oldenburg. The core of the research there is to create behavioral models and predictions based on the determined position data. For example, the system can remind people of a key that they keep forgetting. An overview of the tracked items is provided by an app with a floor plan of the house. The system is operated intuitively by voice control, for example by saying “Where is my key?”\n\nIn the long term, it should also be possible to use the recorded movement patterns to draw conclusions about the well-being of the individual. Thanks to the new technology from Dresden, care facilities will have an incredibly important treasure trove of data at their disposal, which they can use to tailor their care even more individually in the future.\n\nLearn more: tech-news Fraunhofer\n\nAbout the Fraunhofer IZM: www.izm.fraunhofer.de\n\nMarch 27, 2023 | Electrochromic films: Dresden-based Fraunhofer FEP develops innovative heat protection for windows\n\nWindows that turn dark at the push of a button: in Dresden, what sounds like science-fiction will soon become a reality. Coordinated by the Fraunhofer Institute for Organic Electronics, Electron Beam and Plasma Technology FEP in Dresden, six partners from all over Germany are developing so-called electrochromic films. The innovative glass coating unites a series of advantages: It can be retrofitted in existing buildings and darkens windows without the need for an additional sunshade system. Electrochromic films not only lower indoor temperatures in the summer, but conserve significant amounts of energy at the same time. And yet, the project goes beyond technological innovation: it will be organised in cooperation with a local secondary school in Dresden.\n\nOur summers are getting hotter and hotter. All too often, air conditioning is the only way to cool down indoor spaces. But what if the windows themselves could block out the warmth before it even gets inside? In the FLEX-G research project, funded by the Federal Ministry for Economics and Climate Action, Dresden-based scientists have found an answer to this question: electrochromic films. These smart coatings are applied directly to the window glass and turn dark at the push of a button, while maintaining transparency and the view outside. The objective of the successor project, FLEX-G 4.0, is to make these films fit for cost-effective mass use. In cooperation with its partners, Fraunhofer FEP is researching the entire production process – from the films’ industrial manufacture all the way to application on the construction site.\n\nThe new technology will be tested where it is needed the most: besides a Fraunhofer research laboratory that will be newly built, the windows of 46. Oberschule Dresden, a local secondary school, will be retrofitted with the innovative films as well. Over a period of twelve months, this trial will provide the project scientists with valuable insights into the films’ energy conservation potential. At the same time, laboratory measurements will be conducted for comparison. For the school’s students, the trial will provide an exciting opportunity as well: Under the Fraunhofer researchers’ guidance, they will support both the measurements themselves and their evaluation. At the same time, by providing teaching materials and job orientation, Fraunhofer FEP and ISC will promote the students’ environmental awareness and interest in the sciences.\n\nWith their extensive experience in the field and important technological solutions for the application process, the two participating Fraunhofer institutes provide the scientific base for the films’ industrial application. From the coating process and the question of how to power the films to wireless control once they have been applied: the questions the project partners are trying to answer are based on the work of the Dresden-based research institute. The important technologies of the future – they are emerging right here in Dresden.\n\nMarch 20, 2023 | Dresden Fraunhofer spin-off DIVE aims to revolutionize machine vision for the semiconductor industry\n\nScientists at the Fraunhofer IWS in Dresden have been working on 'Hyperspectral Vision Technology' for ten years.
