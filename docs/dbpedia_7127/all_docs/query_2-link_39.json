        "text": "The paper describes recent results achieved in the project AQUIN which purpose is to investigate possibilities of controlling certain complex water management situations. The research has been initiated by a practical problem related to water consumption from the river Uhlava in the Western part of the Czech Republic. On the river, there is a reservoir Nyrsko situated 95 km upstream from the consumption place in the town Plzen. It is a multipurpose drinking-water reservoir, especially used for compensation and also for energy production. Until now, flow deficiency in the consumption place was solved by over quantity of water discharge experimentally. A knowledge-based decision support system, which is being developed recently in the scope of the project, will be able to find really suitable and economically endurable manipulations in Nyrsko reservoir to reduce unused river-flows in water consumption place Plzen during dry periods. The paper is devoted to a brief presentation of the problem solved, followed by a description of the solution, which is being developed in the scope of the AQUIN project. An analysis of information and knowledge sources about the river Uhlava and its characteristics has been performed and the suitable knowledge has been codified, organized and stored in an appropriate knowledge repository. This repository serves as a basis for a knowledge-based part of the decision support system, helping the river basin operators and dispatchers to create as accurate decisions as possible. The draft architecture of the system and some details about its implementation will be presented."
