        "text": "Grain boundaries affect bulk properties of polycrystalline materials, such as electrical conductivity, melting or bulk viscosity. In the past two decades, observations of marked bulk material property changes have been associated with changes in the structure and composition of grain boundaries. This led to the term “grain boundary complexions” to mark the phase-like behaviour of grain boundaries while differing from phases in the sense of Gibbs (Cantwell 2014).\n\nHere we introduce the principles of grain boundary structure to property relations and potent methods to study these. The focus is on the combination of structural, chemical and statistical analysis as obtainable using transmission electron microscopy and electron backscatter diffraction. Data from these complementary methods will be discussed on two systems; garnet and olivine polycrystals.\n\nPast elasticity measurements showed that the Youngs modulus of garnet polycrystals changes as a function of sintering pressure (Hunt et al. 2016). Here we used high resolution transmission electron microscopy to study the structure of grain boundaries from polycrystals synthesized at low (4-8 GPa) and high (8-15) GPa sintering pressure. The HRTEM data were acquired using an image-corrected JEOL ARM 300 to achieve the highest resolution at low electron doses using a OneView camera. Our data indicate a grain boundary structural change occurs from “low-pressure” to “high pressure” grain boundaries, where the grain boundary facets change from >100 nm – 20 nm to 3-7 nm length scale, respectively. We conclude that sintering pressure affects grain-boundary strength and we will evaluate how this may influence anelastic energy loss of seismic waves through elastic or diffusional accommodation of grain-boundary sliding.\n\nPolycrystalline olivine samples show different viscosity related to grain boundary segregation of impurities. To investigate if the distribution of grain boundaries is affected by grain boundary chemistry, we analysed grain orientation data from over 4x104 grains, corresponding to more than 6000 mm grain boundary length per sample. Using stereology, we extract the geometry of the interfacial network. The thus obtained grain boundary character distribution (GBCD) is discussed in relation to bulk viscosity.\n\nHow to cite: Marquardt, K., Dobson, D., Hunt, S., and Faul, U.: Grain boundary character information via individual imaging or statistical analyses: complexion transitions and grain boundary segregation, EGU General Assembly 2021, online, 19–30 Apr 2021, EGU21-14614, https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-egu21-14614, 2021.\n\nHere we report Atom Probe Tomography (APT) analyses of grain and phase boundaries of laboratory-deformed, fine-grained mixtures of clinopyroxene and olivine (Zhao, et al., 2019). The experiments show that the mixtures deform much more rapidly than either mineral endmember. This enhanced deformation in the two-phase material is due to stress-driven reactions at the phase boundaries. Lower effective viscosities of phase mixtures may be critical to the initiation of plate tectonics and the formation of mantle shear zones.\n\nThe hypothesis presented here is that the ‘bulk rock’ – a wehrlite – deforms rapidly because conversion of one phase to the other occurs at phase boundaries (e.g., Sundberg & Cooper, 2008). In this model, grain-scale transport of the shared (slowly-diffusing) mineralogical component Si4+ is not required. The near-boundary gradients of olivine-insoluble ions are presented as evidence of the phase transformation which either dissolves olivine into clinopyroxene or vice versa.\n\nThe resolving power of the APT makes it a promising tool for investigating the microphysics of rock deformation, bridging the atomic scale all the way to the plate-tectonic scale.\n\nReferences:\n\nSundberg M, Cooper RF (2008) Crystallographic preferred orientation produced by diffusional creep of harzburgite: effects of chemical interactions among phases during plastic flow.

Needle- and lath shaped Mt micro-inclusions in plagioclase (Pl) from gabbro often have systematic crystallographic- and shape orientation relationships (CORs, SORs) with the Pl host. The SORs of Mt leads to magnetic anisotropy which may bias the NRM of the Mt-Pl inclusion-host assemblage. Thus, the origin of the CORs and SORs between Mt and Pl is important for paleomagnetic reconstructions. In this context, the atomic structures of Mt-Pl interfaces are of particular interest.\n\nThe CORs and SORs between Mt and Pl were reported earlier and the underlying systematics was revealed from correlated optical and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) including electron back scattered diffraction (EBSD) analyses [1] (and references therein). The so-called plane normal type Mt micro-inclusions extend parallel to the Mt<111> direction, which is perpendicular to the densely packed Mt{222} oxygen layers that are parallel to one of seven Pl lattice planes with nearly identical d-spacings, namely Pl(112), Pl(-312), Pl(1-50), Pl(150), Pl(100), Pl(31-2) and Pl(1-12). Direct imaging of Mt-Pl interfaces has rarely been reported due to the beam sensitivity of Pl. Here we present the microscopic structure of a Mt-Pl interface along the inclusion elongation direction using high angle annular dark field scanning transmission electron microscopy (HAADF-STEM) and integrated differential phase contrast STEM (iDPC-STEM) techniques.\n\nThe TEM foil was prepared using a focused Ga-ion beam (Ga-FIB) from a lath-shaped Mt micro-inclusion of 23 μm x 17 μm x 0.1 μm extending perpendicular to Mt{111}/Pl(-312). The foil is oriented so that the Mt<111>/Pl(-312)-pole are parallel and Mt{110}/Pl(150) planes are perpendicular to the foil.\n\nThe STEM images show that the Mt-Pl interface is perfectly straight and parallel to Mt{110}/Pl(150) and that it is devoid of steps. Electron diffraction patterns confirm that the elongation direction of the micro-inclusions is determined by the good fit of oxygen layers across the Pl-Mt interface. A 2.4% difference in the d-spacings between Pl(-312) and Mt{222} is likely accommodated by every about 42'nd Mt{222} plane forming an edge dislocation at the Mt-Pl interface. In addition, elastic strain is indicated by a deviation of d111/d110 of Mt from the strain free reference lattice. Moreover, lattice fringes in iDPC-STEM images reveal coherence between Pl(22-1) and Mt{111} planes without misfit dislocations. This additional coherence may explain the particularly strong alignment of Mt{111} and Pl(-312) reflected by the EBSD data.\n\nIn summary, the elongation directions of the Mt inclusions are determined by the alignment of important oxygen layers of both phases across the Mt-Pl interface, which is parallel to oxygen-rich lattice planes in both phases. Misfit dislocations are presumably introduced to compensate the 2.4% lattice misfit along the elongation direction. The well-organized interface structure ensures a low interfacial energy and is a viable explanation for the observed Mt-Pl CORs and SORs.\n\nAcknowledgement\n\nFunding by FWF project I 3998-N29 and RFBR project 18-55-14003 is acknowledged.\n\nReference\n\n[1] Ageeva et al (2020) Contrib.

Alteration involved fluid-induced coupled dissolution-reprecipitation processes, which resulted in compositional alteration and development of patchy zoning and porosity in the xenotime and the rim of zircon. Diffusion-reaction processes affected the metamict core of zircon and resulted in nano- to microscale patchy zoning and submicron-scale porosity. This study evaluates the alteration processes with respect to structural and compositional characteristics by using TEM and LA-ICPMS trace element analysis.\n\nNanoscale observations revealed nanoporosity in the metamict core of zircon and a continuation of patchy zoning on a submicron level, which resulted from heterogeneous metamictization correlating with variation in U and Th contents. The altered xenotime and the zircon rim are dominated by microporosity filled with a variety of secondary phases such as U, Th, Pb and Fe rich oxides and silicates. In rare cases, secondary PbS formed nano inclusions in zircon, occasionally surrounded by amorphous apatite. Aside of known substitution mechanisms in xenotime, such as thorite and cheralite components, a correlation of Zr with LREE and Si contents indicates substitution of the zircon component. Furthermore, the zircon-xenotime interface revealed dissolution pits, filled with secondary zircon that formed at the expense of primary xenotime via coupled dissolution-reprecipitation reactions. This indicates local penetration of the fluid-mineral reaction front into xenotime. Major (Si, Zr and P) and trace elements, including U, Th and Pb, which are geochronologically relevant, have been mobilized in the metamict core of zircon due to alteration induced by an alkali-rich fluid with high activities of F, Na and Ca. The altered xenotime and porous rim of zircon were affected by alteration induced by a fluid containing Fe, which resulted in precipitation of Fe-rich phases, such as Fe-oxides and silicates often accompanied by relevant contents of Pb. In conclusion, nanoscale structural observations and LA-ICP-MS trace element data support the complex geochronological implications of the altered zircon-xenotime intergrowth, emphasising the necessity of understanding alteration processes of zircon and xenotime taking into account element transport and thus the disturbance of their geochronological clock.\n\nAcknowledgements: This work was supported by the National Science Centre grant no. 2017/27/B/ST10/00813.\n\nReferences:\n\nBudzyń B., Sláma J., Kozub-Budzyń G.A., Konečný P., Holický I., Rzepa G., Jastrzębski M.

Previous research has shown that despite their apparent robustness, many zircons contain evidence for recrystallisation, such as the replacement of the primary oscillatory zoning by unzoned zircon. This replacement is characterised by rims, patches and embayments of unzoned zircon which can either completely replace the primary zoning or preserve faint remnants within the unzoned zircon. In some samples, the unzoned zircon contains lower U and Pb concentrations, implying that the zircon U-Pb age may be reset during the replacement (Pidgeon, 1992). Interestingly, zircons have also been found in which there is no apparent difference in U-Pb age between the zoned and unzoned zircon (Schaltegger et al., 1999). To better understand the replacement of zoned by unzoned zircon, it is important to study the microstructures present within recrystallised zircon to understand possible mechanisms causing recrystallisation. Multiple mechanisms may explain the trace element distribution within (partially) recrystallised zircon: annealing of radiation damaged (metamict) zircon, annealing of lattice strain imposed by alternating U concentrations in oscillatory zoning, enhanced diffusion along fast-diffusivity pathways (such as low-angle subgrain boundaries or fractures) and coupled dissolution-reprecipitation. The mechanism(s) by which zircons recrystallise remain poorly understood, as well as the effect of the formation of different microstructures on corresponding zircon U-Pb dates. Understanding these phenomena is therefore of vital importance for correctly interpreting U-Pb ages in zircon.\n\nThis work focusses on investigating the microstructures that are present within recrystallised zircons from both metamorphic and igneous environments from the Jack Hills, Australia (Pidgeon, 1992) and the island of Lewis and Harris, Scotland (Van Breemen et al. 1971). Suites of zircons from these areas have been imaged with cathodoluminescence, which is a powerful tool for obtaining high resolution images of the internal structures of zircons. Within these suites, zircons are present which show complex zoning patterns and (partial) recrystallisation; these will be studied in greater detail using EDS, EBSD and SHRIMP. Preliminary results of EDS on the inclusions show that inclusions are composed of feldspars, thorite, quartz and apatite, which were most likely included during the primary crystallisation of the zircon. EBSD measurements will provide additional data on the crystallographic orientation of recrystallized zones and the state of metamictization of the zircons, and may show if zircon has deformed crystal-plastically forming subgrain boundaries.\n\nReferences\n\nPidgeon, R.

Microstructures, including mechanical twinning and subgrain rotation recrystallization are more likely to be preserved at low-temperatures, but the systematics of chemical equilibration have not been established for these conditions. This study identifies progressive crystallographic misorientation and deformation twins in titanite porphyroclasts from the Wasatch Fault Zone, Utah, USA. The microstructures, mapped using electron backscatter diffraction (EBSD), developed at ~11 km depth during 300–400 ºC crystal-plastic deformation within the ductile fault zone. These microstructural maps were used to guide laser ablation-split stream ICP-MS analysis: U-Pb isotopes measured in tandem with major and trace element contents. Despite the low temperature, U-Pb and trace element contents in titanite equilibrated, at least partially, during deformation. Both major and trace elements in titanite also likely partitioned with a fluid and in response to the (re)crystallization of other mineral phases in the fault zone. Chemical zoning and crystal lattice recovery suggestive of fluid-aided recrystallization are absent, and the main mechanism for this resetting may instead be an enhancement of element mobility along microstructure dislocations. These processes are interpreted to record complex open-system behavior of titanite caused by crystal-plastic deformation during the initiation of the WFZ. This presentation will summarize the comparative analysis of microstructure by EBSD and titanite chemistry by LASS-ICP-MS, and how it bears on the understanding of elemental mobility in titanite during low-temperature crystal-plastic deformation.\n\nHow to cite: Udy, N. and Stearns, M.: Insights into chemical mobility in titanite driven by low-temperature crystal-plastic deformation, EGU General Assembly 2021, online, 19–30 Apr 2021, EGU21-7327, https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-egu21-7327, 2021.\n\nThermally activated processes can be described mathematically by the Arrhenius equation. The Meyer-Neldel Rule (MNR), or compensation law, linearly relates the pre-exponent term to the logarithm of the excitation enthalpy for processes that are thermally driven in an Arrhenian manner. This empirical rule was observed in many areas of materials science, in physics, chemistry, and biology. In geosciences it was found to uphold in hydrogen diffusion (Jones 2014a) and proton conduction (Jones 2014b) in minerals.\n\nTrapped charge dating methods that use electron spin resonance (ESR) or optically or thermally stimulated luminescence (OSL and TL) are based on the dose-dependent accumulation of defects in minerals such as quartz and feldspar. The thermal stability of these defects in the age range investigated is a major prerequisite for accurate dating, while the accurate determination of the values of the trap depths and frequency factors play a major role in thermochronometry applications.\n\nThe correlation of kinetic parameters for diffusion has been very recently established for irradiated oxides (Kotomin et al. 2018). A correlation between the activation energy and the frequency factor that satisfied the Meyer–Neldel rule was reported when the thermal stability of [AlO4/h+]0 and [TiO4/M+]0 ESR signals in quartz was studied as function of dose (Benzid and Timar-Gabor 2020). Here we compiled the optically stimulated luminescence (OSL) data published so far in this regard, and investigated experimentally the thermal stability of OSL signals for doses ranging from 10 to 10000 Gy in sedimentary quartz samples. We report a linear relationship between the natural logarithm of the preexponent term (the frequency factor) and the activation energy E, corresponding to a Meyer-Neldel energy of 45 meV, and a deviation from first order kinetics in the high dose range accompanied by an apparent decrease in thermal stability. The implications of these observations and the atomic and physical mechanisms are currently studied.\n\nReferences\n\nBenzid, K., Timar Gabor, A. 2020.

Garnets are often occurring in the Lešnica alluvion in a form of loosely separated crystals with preserved crystalline forms and as mildly rounded broken grains [1]. Their mineralogical determination was previously published by Milošević et al, [1]. Crystals, that have been extracted and separated from the sandy fraction, have exhibited the presence of various types of inclusions in their structure. Single and multiphase inclusions in the garnets were examined optically by petrographic methods followed by SEM-EDS method, applied for the chemical analyses of the individual inclusion, and LA-ICP-MS applied to determine distribution and content of trace elements in the host garnet.\n\nResults from SEM-EDS method show that garnets are of the spessartine-almandine type with the incorporation of irregular inclusions determined as rare earth elements (REE) minerals (monazite, xenotime, columbite-tantalite) and accessory minerals that usually incorporate REE (titanite, apatite, and zircon) together with uranium oxide minerals. Other single-phase inclusions are often quartz and rutile. Size of inclusion varieties from grain to grain, between 5 and 40 µm, while their distribution doesn’t follow any pattern, random distribution. It has been noted that zircon and uranium oxide minerals are often found coupled and as multiphase inclusions while monazite, xenotime and columbite-tantalite minerals are observed as separate, single, inclusions. Chondrite normalized REE in the host garnets plotted on spider diagram show extreme depletions of large ion lithophile elements (LILE) and enrichment in high field strength elements (HFSE), with negative Ce, Nd and Eu anomaly. Single-phase and multiphase inclusions that are occurring in the same garnet host with a random distribution are suggesting different genetic relations.\n\n[1] Milošević M., Kostić B., Vulić P., Jelić I. 2019.

One area of research that is undergoing dramatic advances is the non-destructive interrogation of samples in three dimensions through X-ray microscopy (XRM). Techniques such as ZEISS Versa and Ultra XRM can be performed at a variety of scales and resolutions, resulting in micro-to-nano scale information on geological samples. Such techniques can be correlated with each other i.e. expanding nanoscale resolution to a large sample or internal calibration of X-ray intensity to identify mineral assemblages, or even correlation with other techniques such as electron microscopy (EM). X-ray techniques are also particularly adaptable to digital resolution enhancements through software processes such as machine learning algorithms.\n\nCollecting 3D information for petrological investigations can often require ground truthing of mineralogical and compositional interpretations. The more developed the 3D microscopy becomes, the more we are increasingly interested in features that are deeply buried within our samples. This means the corresponding techniques for excavating a region of interest also need to advance in both speed and accuracy.\n\nThe ZEISS Crossbeam-Laser (XBL) system provides a unique capability of rapidly excavating to a point of interest within a 3D sample volume. The XBL is already seeing use in material sciences, with a standard XB chamber with focussed Ion Beam (FIB) and Electron Microscopy (EM), and a correlated femtosecond laser chamber for rapid material removal. Sample data collected through XRM can be correlated to the XBL stage so that any internal features located by XRM have their coordinates automatically available in three dimensions. The femtosecond laser can excavate to a region of interest (RoI) within the sample within seconds or minutes, dramatically reducing preparation time compared to standard FIB/PFIB. The laser cut surface can be used for analysis techniques such as energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) and electron backscatter diffraction (EBSD), even prior to final polishing with the focussed ion beam (FIB).\n\nHere we show the XRM-XBL workflow in high grade metamorphic rocks for identifying minerals in context for geochronology and micro-to-nano scale textures.\n\nHow to cite: Taylor, R.: Advances in 3D characterisation for correlative microscopy in geosciences, EGU General Assembly 2021, online, 19–30 Apr 2021, EGU21-9597, https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-egu21-9597, 2021.\n\nGeochemical, petrographic, and spectroscopic indices that vary with compositional changes in petroliferous organic matter (OM) during thermal maturation are key petroleum system parameters used to understand petroleum generation. In unconventional shale source-rock reservoirs, where multiple, highly dispersed OM types may be present in intimate contact with surrounding mineral phases, OM molecular composition (e.g., aromaticity) is especially useful for informing structure-reactivity relationships representative of different OM types. Here, we employ microscale, in situ, and correlative Raman and reflectance approaches to evaluate aromaticity evolution for a suite of OM types (i.e., liptinite, micrinite, solid bitumen, vitrinite, and inertinite) at the single particle level across an artificial thermal gradient. Our samples include a marginally mature (vitrinite reflectance ~0.5%) Late Cretaceous Boquillas Shale from south Texas, United States, and two hydrous pyrolysis (HP) residues following reaction of the raw Boquillas Shale sample at 300°C and 330°C for 72 hours. Our data indicate that: (i) liptinite, micrinite, solid bitumen, vitrinite, and inertinite particles exhibit different aromatic signatures in the raw shale sample and (ii) these OM types, with the exception of inertinite, effectively experience similar changes in aromatic structure with thermal advance. Data also reinforce the concept that reservoir temperature may be a secondary factor in controlling the molecular composition of inertinite. These findings inform a broader understanding of how different petroliferous OM types evolve throughout thermal reactions and further demonstrate that correlative Raman spectroscopy and reflection analyses, combined with careful organic petrography, can provide complimentary estimates of OM molecular composition and thermal maturity.\n\nHow to cite: Jubb, A., Birdwell, J., and Hackley, P.: Evaluating aromaticity changes with thermal stress at the single particle level for a suite of organic matter types from the Boquillas Shale (Texas, United States) via correlative Raman and reflection analyses, EGU General Assembly 2021, online, 19–30 Apr 2021, EGU21-259, https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-egu21-259, 2021.\n\nAlong with some other Na-minerals, carbonophosphates indicate a high initial Na activity in carbonatite and kimberlite melts, which is beneficial for petrological reconstructions. Because carbonophosphates are capable of incorporating large-ion lithophile and rare earth elements (REEs) in their structure, they can participate in the transport of these elements. Moreover, due to the presence of both [PO4]3− and [CO3]2− groups in carbonophosphates, these mineral phases play an important role in the Earth's global carbon and phosphate cycles. With all these properties, carbonophosphates have long attracted the attention of geologists. Raman spectroscopy appears to be one of the most suitable tools for their diagnosis, since they commonly present in rocks as small inclusions in other mineral grains. Despite this profit, only a few publications contain Raman characteristics of either natural or synthetic carbonophosphates.\n\nWe studied and compared Raman spectra of three natural carbonophosphate phases (sidorenkite, bonshtedtite, and bradleyite) with the general formula Na3MCO3PO4 (M = Mn, Fe, and Mg, correspondingly). These spectra showed from 21 to 24 vibrational bands, of which the two most intense (963±5 cm-1 и 1074±3 cm-1) correspond to the ν1(P–O) and ν1(C–O) modes. These two bands split due to the occurrence of isomorphic impurities. It was found that the crystallographic orientation of the sample influences the intensity of most bands. A natural increase in the Raman shift was observed for most bands assigned to the same vibrations (the smallest shift in the spectrum is characteristic of sidorenkite, an intermediate - of bonshtedtite, and the largest - of bradleyite).\n\nWe propose the following algorithm for the diagnosis of carbonophosphates:\n\nChecking minerals for belonging to the group of carbonophosphates by the main bands and the characteristic profile of the spectrum;\n\nTesting the hypothesis that the mineral of question is bradleyite based on the analysis of the estimated shift of the main bands;\n\nDiagnosis of a mineral species by peaks located between the main bands;\n\nValidation of the diagnostics by considering the position of the bands at 185±9 cm-1, 208±7 cm-1, 255±5 cm-1, and 725±6 cm-1.\n\nThe proposed algorithm allows one to perform Raman diagnostics of carbonophosphates in inclusions even in the absence of EPMA data. In the study of carbonatites, kimberlites, and other rocks, the diagnostics of the mineral species of the carbonophosphate group can be important in the petrological aspect.\n\nThis research was funded by the Russian Science Foundation, grant number 19-77-10039.\n\nHow to cite: Fomina, E., Kozlov, E., Sidorov, M., and Bocharov, V.: A Raman spectroscopic study of the natural carbonophosphates Na3MCO3PO4 (M = Mn, Fe, and Mg), EGU General Assembly 2021, online, 19–30 Apr 2021, EGU21-1528, https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-egu21-1528, 2021.\n\nRaman spectroscopy represents a novel methodology of characterising plant-fire interactions through geological history, with enormous potential. Applications of Raman spectroscopy to charcoal have shown that this is an effective method of understanding intensity changes across palaeofire regimes. Such analyses have relied on the determination of appropriate Raman parameters, given their relationship with temperature of formation and microstructural changes in reference charcoals. Quantitative assessments of charcoal microstructure have also been successfully applied to the assessment of carbonaceous maturation under alternate thermal regimes, such as pyroclastic volcanism. Palaeowildfire systems in association with volcanism may present a complex history of thermal maturation, given interactions between detrital charcoals and volcanogenic deposition. However, whilst palaeofire and volcanic maturation of carbonaceous material are well understood individually, their interaction has yet to be characterised. Here we present the first analysis of palaeofire charcoals derived from volcanic ignition utilising Raman spectroscopy. Our results indicate that complex interactions between volcanism and palaeofire systems may be better understood by the characterisation of charcoal microstructure, alongside palaeobotanical and ecosystem studies. Understanding the unique relationship between wildfires and volcanism, and the impact that this has on the fossil record, may better assist our understanding of wildfire systems in deep history. Further still, this highlights the potential for better understanding the socioecological impacts of modern and future wildfire systems closely associated with volcanic centres.\n\nHow to cite: Theurer, T., Muirhead, D., Jolley, D., and Mauquoy, D.: The Potential Applications of Raman Spectroscopy in Unravelling Complex Palaeowildfire Ecosystems, EGU General Assembly 2021, online, 19–30 Apr 2021, EGU21-2626, https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-egu21-2626, 2021.\n\nOver the last two decades, Raman microspectroscopy has known a spectacular development in various research fields of petrology opening new avenues for studies in sedimentology, metamorphism or magmatism and cosmochemistry. This has been made possible thanks to major technological improvements (e.g., Raman hyperspectral mapping) and a better theoretical approach (e.g., data processing and interpretation). Raman spectra are actually sensitive to even minor (chemical or structural) perturbations within chemical bonds in (even amorphous) solids, liquids, and gases. They can, thus, help identify, characterize, and differentiate between individual minerals, fluid inclusions, glasses, carbonaceous materials, solid solution phases, strain in minerals, and dissolved species in multi-component solutions. Such sensitivity and versatility make Raman a unique tool for petrology. Yet, it relies on a weak and subtle signal and a cautious approach is required to avoid pitfalls during the analysis and/or the interpretation of data. Some recent scientific milestones will be presented and discussed in various fields like geothermobarometry of metamorphic rocks, geochemistry of meteorites, speciation of deep fluids involved in fluid-rock interactions or the characterization of organic/mineral assemblages of astrobiological interest. For the particular c ase of petrology, Raman microspectroscopy has the immense advantage that it requires minimal sample preparation, thus it can be performed in situ preserving the original microtexture of the sample with a rather high spatial resolution for analysis, typically 1 mm at 532 nm for modern systems. Therefore, this technique is now increasingly used to study poorly crystalline and chemically heterogeneous materials involved for instance in geochemical processes occuring at Earth surface. But it faces numerous challenges due to the reactivity of such phases making them fragile under the laser beam, or due to the quasi-systematic presence of intense backgrounds in the spectra overwhelming the Raman signal. The source of this background can be multiple as it can be observed with fine-grained samples and/or it can be generated by the presence of luminescence/fluorescence emission centers. More generally such background is not well understood although it is a major issue for Raman spectroscopy in many petrological applications. However, there too, recent technological developments, sometimes based on old ideas, offer new possibilities to investigate safely and accurately such materials : time-resolved spectroscopy and surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS) will be presented as well as some applications for petrology of complex samples.\n\nHow to cite: Beyssac, O.: Raman spectroscopy for petrology : recent scientific milestones, technological trends and challenges, EGU General Assembly 2021, online, 19–30 Apr 2021, EGU21-3416, https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-egu21-3416, 2021.\n\nIn recent decades increasing evidence was found for life under extreme conditions, e.g., near black smokers on the ocean floor. The synthesis and stability of vital molecules like adenosine triphosphate (ATP) and adenosine diphosphate (ADP) are essential to maintain the metabolism of all known organisms. The lifetime of these molecules in water is limited by the non-enzymatic hydrolysis reaction that becomes dominant at elevated temperatures. A better understanding of this mechanism will provide us insights of life at extreme conditions.\n\nPrevious studies determined the hydrolysis rate constants of ATP for several compositions, temperatures and pressures using quench experiments and subsequent analysis. So far, it was not tested whether quench artefacts might have affected those results. Therefore, the current study was performed to develop a method to follow the reaction in-situ with a high sampling rate at elevated temperatures. A confocal micro-Raman spectrometer and a hydrothermal diamond anvil cell were used to perform experiments at elevated temperatures and vapour pressure. Spectra were obtained in the range of 660 cm-1 to 1157 cm-1 as a function of time. Different solutions of ATP and ADP were measured at 353 K, 373 K, and 393 K, at starting pH values of 3 and 7. First findings are consistent with previous studies and show that with decreasing pH value the hydrolysis rate increases. The data indicate hydrolysis rate constants in the magnitude of 10-3 s-1 by 393 K, 10-4 s-1 by 373 K and 10-5 s-1 by 353 K. These initial observations show that this technique produces reliable kinetic data on this reaction. It also provides much better sampling statistics than quench experiments.\n\nThe high reaction rates suggest that a mechanism exists to regulate this reaction at higher temperatures, which is necessary to allow metabolism under extreme conditions. Moreover, it is commonly known that ATP interacts with various metal ions with different effects on the reaction rate. An application of this method would be the quantification of the hydrolysis rate constant in chemically more complex systems.\n\nHow to cite: Moeller, C., Schmidt, C., Guyot, F., and Wilke, M.: A new in-situ method to determine the hydrolysis rate constant of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) by application of Raman spectroscopy in a hydrothermal diamond anvil cell, EGU General Assembly 2021, online, 19–30 Apr 2021, EGU21-3419, https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-egu21-3419, 2021.\n\nThe correct assessment of maximum temperatures experienced by rocks is an essential tool to unravel the evolution of the thermal structure of the crust during the main phases of an orogenesis. Given to broad P-T stability field of classical metamorphic mineralogical indicators, maximum temperatures derived from the analyses of carbonaceous material dispersed in rocks by means of Raman spectroscopy has shown to be a suitable alternative to classical geothermometer. Initially developed for high metamorphic rocks the use of this tools has recently been extended also at lower metamorphic degree and diagenesis. This allowed us to extend the analyses of paleotemperatures experienced by rocks from Ghomarides and Sebtides from the Internal Rif in North Morocco with respect to previous works. Ghomaride and Sebtides in this portion of the Rif-Betic-Tell chain, represent respectively the upper and lower plates of a metamorphic core complex and are composed, the first, by Paleozoic rocks with a partially preserved Mesozoic-Cenozoic cover and the second by lower Paleozoic to Triassic deep-crustal mica-schists, migmatites and granulites associated with peridotites (Beni Bousera complex).\n\nOur data suggest that the uppermost Tiszgarine Unit of the Upper Sebtides experienced warmer condition than previously observed. Moreover, we calculate the maximum temperatures experienced by the Ghomarides during both the Eo and Late Variscan cycles showing that differences in temperature exist among the vary units that compose the complex. Finally, in the southern area our data suggest a less severe alpine heating related to the emplacement of the Beni Bousera peridotite, than previously calculated.\n\nHow to cite: Schito, A., Atouabat, A., Calcagni, R., Corrado, S., Muirhead, D., Romano, C., Pozzi, A., Galimberti, R., and Spina, A.: An insight on the polyphase thermal history of the Ghomarides and Upper Sebtides in the Internal Rif (North Morocco) by means of Raman spectroscopy on organic matter, EGU General Assembly 2021, online, 19–30 Apr 2021, EGU21-7459, https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-egu21-7459, 2021.\n\nCarotenoid compounds such as β-carotene are some of the most prevalent organic molecules on Earth and are key biomarkers as there is no known abiogenic source. During diagenesis and thermal alteration, carbon undergoes well-documented changes in Raman spectra.\n\nThere has been little research into the transitional degradation of carotenoid spectra to where they are fully replaced by the carbon spectra as the main identifier of thermal maturity under Raman spectroscopy. This is an overlooked regime when discussing the search for life, terrestrial and extra-terrestrial, where current research (using Raman spectroscopy) either focuses on finding living organisms displaying common organic molecules, or looks for the elemental carbon evidence of extinct fossil life. The real world is not usually so polarised, so covering the transition between these modes of life detection will improve any detection analysis.\n\nFor this study the volcanic thermal spring system in Viterbo, Italy was used as a field-based laboratory. The high rate of carbonate precipitation in these thermal springs, the wide range of thermal regimes (58°C to 25°C), and the prevalence of fast-growing algae in the run-off streams, give excellent preservation of a range of organic matter states at directly measurable temperatures.\n\nThe results demonstrate how the Raman spectra of the carotenoid compounds change with hydration, death of the organism, and thermal alteration of the organic material. The relationship between the spectra of the carotenoid compound and the elemental carbon spectra in the transition zone is also shown.\n\nThis study expands on the use of Raman spectroscopy of carbon as a low-temperature geothermometer, and provides a framework for the spectral response of organic matter in an often-overlooked geological regime. It is anticipated that the fields of geothermal energy, climatology, geobiology and astrogeobiology, could all benefit from this study, incorporating this enhanced thermal alteration data into existing and future work.\n\nHow to cite: O'Donnell, A.: Searching for life in volcanic carbonate systems and the effect of temperature on organic molecules, EGU General Assembly 2021, online, 19–30 Apr 2021, EGU21-9659, https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-egu21-9659, 2021.\n\nAssessing the nature and evolution of the Sub-Continental Lithospheric Mantle (SCLM) is crucial to understand the dynamics of Earth’s interior and the global scale tectono-magmatic processes. The study of ultramafic xenoliths brought to the surface in specific context, such as northern Victoria Land (Antarctica), is a key to investigate how the SCLM bear witness of large-scale geodynamic episodes. Indeed, the Antarctica lithosphere was involved into three main tectono-magmatic episodes since Paleozoic, i.e. the 550-110 Ma Ross subduction, the Jurassic (~182 Ma) Ferrar magmatism and the Cenozoic alkaline magmatism responsible for the opening of the West Antarctic Rift System (WARS).\n\nIn this study, a review of the petrological and geochemical features of >200 mantle-derived and cumulate xenoliths brought to the surface at Baker Rocks, Greene Point, Handler Ridge, Harrow Peaks, Browning Pass and Mount Overlord enabled us to reconstruct the main depletion and enrichment processes that took place in the Antarctica SCLM. Strong depletion is recorded by Greene Point lherzolites and harzburgites (18-21%), which likely began melting in the garnet facies and terminated in the spinel facies (Perinelli et al. 2006), whereas mild melt extraction in the spinel stability field was hypothesized at Baker Rocks and Handler Ridge (12-16% and 7-13% melting, respectively). The onset of the Jurassic Ferrar large magmatic event is testified by both the refertilisation in Greene Point-Baker Rocks peridotites and the appearance of cumulate orthopyroxenites/olivine-websterites at Harrow Peaks and Baker Rocks. Late enrichment process/es took place in concomitance with the Cenozoic alkaline magmatism of the WARS, resulting in both cryptic and modal metasomatism and overprinting earlier chemical modifications. This metasomatism was particularly effective at Baker Rocks, as shown by the increase of clinopyroxene abundance, its trace element enrichment and the formation of amphibole disseminated and in veins. Clinopyroxene composition in Cenozoic cumulate rocks matches the enrichment path observed in the peridotites, supporting the link between the last metasomatic process and the recent alkaline magmatism.\n\nAmong mantle xenoliths populations, Greene Point record the highest T-P (870-1059 °C; 0.8-1.6 GPa) and the least oxidized conditions (fO2 down to -2/-3 ΔFMQ). Cumulate rocks yield the highest fO2 (up to +1.5 ΔFMQ), at T varying between 900 and 1150°C, approximating the conditions of crystallizing melts. No discrepancies in fO2 emerged between amphibole-bearing and amphibole-free peridotites, ruling out a strict correlation between amphibole stability, H2O activity and fO2. Nevertheless, the alkaline metasomatic event, which led to amphibole formation, caused a remarkable increase in the H2O content of the system. In fact, anhydrous peridotites preserve bulk H2O contents ≤128 ppm, while lherzolites with disseminated amphibole and hornblendites have H2O contents as up to 354-1120 ppm and 1.42 wt%, respectively.\n\nPerinelli, C., et al. 2006.

Numerous volcanoes erupted deep subalkaline to highly alkaline magmas, including the particular active natrocarbonatite Oldoinyo Lengai. On the North-South axis (Natron to Manyara basins), three highly alkaline volcanoes, Pello Hills, Lashaine and Labait, erupted melilite magmas that originated from low degree of partial melting of asthenospheric mantle (depth > 120 km). The particularity of these volcanoes is that they sampled numerous mantle xenoliths during ascent. This represents a unique opportunity to study the composition and the rheology of lithospheric mantle. Mantle xenoliths are deep garnet-bearing peridotites (120 km depth), amphibole and phlogopite peridotites and phlogopitites. They contain abundant hydrous minerals as isolated crystals or veins that attest to an important metasomatism beneath the NTD. Previous geochemical and petrological studies have highlighted interactions of alkaline magmas and the thick cratonic lithosphere as metasomatic agent. However, the presence and composition of magmas, the degree of metasomatism, and the role of metasomatism on mantle rheology below the NTD is still debated.\n\nTo characterize these previous parameters, in this study we performed geochemical and petrophysical analyses on metasomatized, fertile and refractory mantle xenoliths from Labait (on-craton volcano) and Pello Hills (in-rift volcano). Using mineral compositions and thermobarometer calibrations, we estimated the depth of mantle xenoliths between 40 and 140 km (14 to 47 kbar) and temperatures from 930 to 1340°C. EBSD analysis on thin sections indicate that peridotites and amphibole/phlogopite-bearing mantle xenoliths display a moderate to strong deformation induced crystal preferred orientation. In contrast, weak mineral orientations have been observed in phlogopite-amphibole-clinopyroxene-bearing veins. Calculation of seismic properties using MTEX program show that peridotites are seismically anisotropic, up to 12.4% for P-wave velocity (Vp) and 6.8% for S-wave velocity (Vs). The Vp and Vs in hydrous veins are lower than in peridotites (Vp: 7.5-7.9 and 8.3-9.6 km/s; Vs: 4.4-4.6 and 5.0-5.3 km/s respectively) and therefore the Vp and Vs velocities decrease with the increasing proportion of metasomatic minerals. We estimate that a peridotite with 20 vol.% metasomatic vein has a velocity decrease of 3.5% for Vp and 2.9% for Vs, compared to a fertile peridotite.\n\nThese geochemical and petrophysical approaches are important to understand P- and S-wave propagation in the lithospheric mantle beneath the NTD and more specifically in metasomatized lithospheric mantle. The new in situ data and models from mantle xenoliths will be compared to tomographic acquisition and discussed in term of temperature, presence of melt or metasomatism processes. Both petrophysical and geophysical data will help to precisely determine the structure and rheology of the lithospheric mantle, which may control the propagation of the rift at early stage rifting between the Tanzanian craton and the mobile Proterozoic belts.\n\nHow to cite: Clutier, A., Parat, F., Gregoire, M., Gibert, B., Gautier, S., and Tiberi, C.: Geochemical and petrophysical characterization of mantle metasomatism beneath the North Tanzanian Divergence, East African rift., EGU General Assembly 2021, online, 19–30 Apr 2021, EGU21-10603, https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-egu21-10603, 2021.\n\nCameroon Volcanic Line (CVL) is located in the western part of equatorial Africa and consists of volcanoes which were active from Eocene to recent, stretching ca. 1700 km from the Atlantic in the SW into the African continent in the NE. The continental part of the CVL is located on the Neoproterozoic Central African Orogenic Belt and is situated between the Congo craton and Sahara/Western Africa craton. Mantle peridotite xenoliths which occur locally in lavas of the CVL come from the spinel facies only, suggesting a relatively shallow lithosphere-asthenosphere boundary (LAB). This is supported by seismic studies, showing the LAB at 90-100 km.\n\nIn order to understand better the evolution of the lithospheric mantle beneath the CVL, we studied xenolith suite (16 xenoliths) from Befang in the Oku Massif (Tedonkenfack et al., submitted). The Befang xenoliths are almost entirely lherzolites which have cataclastic to weakly porphyroclastic texture. Harzburgites and websterites occur subordinately. Spinel is interstitial and has amoeboidal shape. The studied peridotites (14 lherzolites, 1 harzburgite) consist of minerals with almost constant composition (olivine Fo88.7-90.3, orthopyroxene Al 0.17-0.19 atoms per formula unit (a pfu), clinopyroxene Al 0.28-0.30 a pfu, spinel Cr# dominantly 0.09-0.11). Spinel of Cr# 0.15 occurs in one of the lherzolites, whereas that occurring in harzburgite has Cr# 0.19. Clinopyroxene REE patterns are similar to those of Depleted MORB Mantle (DMM) except LREEs, which vary from depleted to enriched. The A-type olivine fabric occurs in the EBSD-studied subset of 8 samples (one harzburgite and 7 lherzolites). Orthopyroxene shows deformation consistent with olivine. The fabric of LREE-enriched clinopyroxene is equivalent to those of orthopyroxene and olivine, whereas spinel and LREE-depleted clinopyroxene are oriented independently of the fabric of host rock.\n\nThese data, thermometry, phase relationships and phase equilibria diagrams suggest that the Befang mantle section was refertilised by MORB-like melt at pressures 1.0-1.4 GPa and temperatures slightly above 1200 – 1275 ºC. The olivine-orthopyroxene framework and LREE-enriched clinopyroxene preserve the fabric of protolith. On the other hand, the LREE-depleted clinopyroxene shows discordant orientation relative to olivine-orthopyroxene protolith framework, and amoeboidal spinel crystallized from the melt. The major element and REEs composition of pyroxenes occurring in the Befang peridotites indicate chemical reequilibration at temperatures 930 – 1000 ºC. Trace element modeling shows that websterites can be linked to Cenozoic volcanism. We speculate that they form veins in the lithospheric mantle. Our study therefore supports the origin of fertile SCLM via refertilization rather than by extraction of small melt fractions, and further emphasizes the involvement of depleted melts in this process, which contrasts with the incompatible element-enriched melts typically invoked in within-plate settings.\n\nThis study originated thanks to the project of Polish National Centre of Research NCN 2017/27/B/ST10/00365 to JP.

It stretches over two major Variscan basement units: the Rheno-Hercynian Zone in the NW and the Saxo-Thuringian Zone in the SE. We studied peridotite xenoliths from Breitenborn, Nidda and Dreihausen (SE, central and NW part of Vogelsberg, respectively) in order to reveal the evolution of the subcontinental lithospheric mantle (SCLM) rejuvenated during a Cenozoic rifting episode.\n\nThe Vogelsberg xenoliths are spinel harzburgites and clinopyroxene-poor spinel lherzolites. Most samples show grain size reduction leading to serial or porphyroclastic texture, or slight to well-defined foliation. All studied sites have similar major elements chemistry: olivine Fo 89.3-91.7%; orthopyroxene (opx) Mg# 0.89-0.92 and 0.06-0.25 atoms of Al pfu (per formula unit); clinopyroxene (cpx) Mg# 0.89-0.93 and 0.10-0.33 atoms of Al pfu. Spinel Cr# is highly variable: 0.18-0.45 for Breitenborn, 0.14-0.57 for Nidda and 0.11-0.61 for Dreihausen.\n\nVogelsberg peridotites exhibit a diversity of REE patterns:\n\n(1) opx with a sinusoidal pattern, no cpx (Nidda, Dreihausen);\n\n(2) cpx with flat patterns; coexisting opx with strong LREE-depletion, (La/Lu)N ~0.02 (Nidda, Dreihausen)\n\n(3) cpx with flat, spoon-shaped patterns with La-Ce-enrichment (La/Pr)N ~4.3; opx similar to (2) but partly spoon-like, (Nd/Lu)N ~0.02 (Nidda, Breitenborn)\n\n(4) cpx with different degree of LREE-enrichment, (La/Lu)N­ of 4-21.4; coexisting opx with mild LREE-depletion, (La/Lu)N of 0.1-0.3 (Breitenborn, Nidda, Dreihausen)\n\n(5) cpx with flat HREE pattern and strongly LREE-depleted, (La/Eu)N ~0.03; coexisting opx similar to (2) but with (Ce/Lu)N ~0.001 (Breitenborn)\n\nTemperatures calculated using REE content (TREE) [1] for the Breitenborn peridotites exhibit two ranges: 930-990°C and 1050-1130°C, for the Nidda ones: 880-930°C, 1000-1050°C and 1110-1150°C and for Dreihausen ones: 1140-1190°C. Temperatures calculated on the basis of pyroxene major element contents (TBKN) [2] are 40-90°C lower than TREE in Breitenborn and Nidda and lower by 10-55°C in Dreihausen.\n\nThe most common pyroxene REE patterns (type 4) are products of two-phase metasomatism: by Vogelsberg alkali basalt followed by a highly LREE-rich melt that further increased LREE contents in cpx, up to observed abundances. Strongly LREE-depleted opx (types 2, 3, 5) and cpx (type 5) patterns could be residues after partial melting of a fertile protolith, or products of metasomatism by melts derived from depleted MORB mantle. Cpx patterns of type 2 and 3 might have been once similar to type 5 but were later affected by the second phase of metasomatism: highly LREE-rich melt that increased chromatographically their LREE contents to variable degrees. The diversity of REE patterns and calculated temperatures shows that the SCLM beneath Vogelsberg is highly heterogeneous, probably due to spatial variability of deformation and percolation of hot melts connected with Cenozoic rifting.\n\nThis study was funded by Polish National Science Centre to MZ (UMO-2018/29/N/ST10/00259) and JP (UMO-2014/15/B/ST10/00095).

Therefore, to understand relations between the metal migration and metasomatism of silicate phases in the SCLM beneath SW Poland we studied sulfides in a set of mantle ultramafic xenoliths with variable metasomatic history. The xenoliths occur in the Cenozoic alkaline mafic volcanic rocks from the SW Poland (N Bohemian Massif).\n\nThe studied sulfides occur in mantle rocks of variable history: 1) strongly depleted (group A0) to weakly metasomatized peridotites (Group A1); 2) strongly melt-metasomatized peridotites (Group B); 3) pyroxenites (Group C; for details of group definition see Matusiak-Małek et al., 2014, JoP). The metasomatism was of mixed silicate/carbonatite nature. The sulfides are either interstitial or enclosed in the silicates and form mostly globular monosulfide solid solution-chalcopyrite (mss-Ccp) assemblages typical of igneous sulfides separated and crystallized from mafic magmas, with mss partially re-equilibrated to exsolutions of pentlandite (Pn) and pyrrhotite (Po) when temperature dropped to <600°C (e.g., Craig and Kullerud, 1969, Econ. Geol. Monogr.).\n\nThe sulfide abundances increase from Group A (≤ 0.008 vol.‰) through Group B (up to 0.060 vol. ‰) to Group C (up to 0.963 vol.‰) xenoliths. The sulfides of Groups C (Po15–99Pn0–20Ccp0–70) and B (Po0–85Pn14–100Ccp0–27) are generally poorer in Ni compared to Group A (Po0–74Pn24–100Ccp0–35). Consequently, Ni/(Ni+Fe) in the Group C pentlandites (0.41–0.52) is lower than in those in Group A (0.45–0.69). Moreover, the sulfide grains of Group B are enriched in chalcophile elements (e.g., the median content of Zn is 90 ppm) compared to sulfides from Groups C (52 ppm Zn) and A (51 ppm of Zn). The same relations occur in PGE contents, e.g., Pt in Group B is 1.6 ppm, while in Groups C and A it is 0.1 and 1.3 ppm, respectively. Observed differences in δ56Fe between the Groups are probably due to modal composition of bulk sulfide grains between Groups A (Ni-rich), B and C (Fe-Cu-rich). As no difference is observed between the grains of the same composition, any fractionation of Fe isotopes in sulfide melt seems to be possible only upon its differentiation from Ni-rich to Fe-Cu-rich.\n\nThe host peridotites were affected by strong depletion as the degree of partial melting was possibly ~30%. Thus, the observed enhanced sulfide modes in the metasomatized peridotites (Groups A1 and B) are most likely brought by the metasomatic melt. This is also evidenced by their Fe-Cu-rich composition, similar to that of the sulfides from the pyroxenites. In this view, melt metasomatism likely affects the chalcophile and highly-siderophile metal budget of the continental lithosphere.\n\nThe measurements of Fe isotopic ratios were financed from funds for years 2020-2024 within program “Diamond Grant” (DI2019 0093 49), the LAICPMS measurements were financed from 2016/23/N/ST10/00288 to J.C., and the EPMA analyses were done within the frame of the Polish-Austrian project WTZ PL/16 and WTZ PL 08/2018.\n\nHow to cite: Mazurek, H., Ciazela, J., Matusiak-Małek, M., Pieterek, B., Puziewicz, J., Lazarov, M., Horn, I., and Ntaflos, T.: Metal enrichment as a result of SCLM metasomatism?

Here, we present the first isotopic results for noble gases and CO2 in fluid inclusions (FI) trapped in mantle xenoliths from El Hierro the youngest island of the Canarian archipelago. Our results are based on 6 mantle xenolith samples (3 Spinel-lherzolites and 3 Spinel-harzburgites) collected from the El Julan cliff valley (Oglialoro et al., 2017), from which we hand-picked crystals of Ol, Opx, and Cpx. Isotopic determinations were performed at the INGV (Sezione di Palermo) noble gas and stable isotopes laboratories, following the preparation methods and analytical procedures described in Rizzo et al. (2018 and references therein).\n\nThe Ne-Ar isotopic compositions reveal the presence of an atmospheric component in the FI. Most of the samples exhibit 4He/20Ne ratios > 60, 20Ne/22Ne ratios between 9.84 and 10.49, 21Ne/22Ne ratios from 0.0295 to 0.0330, and 40Ar/36Ar > 800, suggesting mixing between MORB-like mantle fluids and an air-derived component. We argue this latter may (at least in part) derive from upper mantle recycling of atmospheric fluids via paleo-subduction event(s). Excluding samples possibly affected by diffusive fractionation processes, the average Rc/Ra ratio (3He/4He ratio corrected for atmospheric contamination) measured in El Hierro xenoliths is ~7.45 + 0.26 Ra, within the MORB range (8 + 1 Ra; Graham, 2002). The He homogeneous signature of these xenoliths agrees well with the 3He/4He compositions previously reported in lava phenocrysts and cumulates (Day and Hilton, 2011) and is slightly below the maximum ratios measured in groundwater samples during the 2012 volcanic unrest (~8.2 Ra; Padron et al., 2013). All these pieces of evidence argue against a primordial source involved in the local lithospheric mantle. Putting these data in the context of previous literature results for FI and surface gases in the Canary Islands (La Palma, La Gomera, Tenerife, Gran Canaria, and Lanzarote), we identify an eastward 3He/4He decreasing trend that parallels a corresponding increase of the oceanic crust thickness. In addition to the mantle heterogeneity, we propose that part of the 3He/4He east-to-west variation along the archipelago is caused by the variable thickness of the oceanic crust (and hence, different interactions with 4He-rich crustal fluids during emplacement).\n\nThe FI δ13C(CO2) isotopic composition ranges from -2.38 to -1.23‰ in pyroxenes and -0.2 to +2.0‰ in olivine. These unusually positive δ13C compositions support the existence of a recycled crustal carbon component in the local source mantle, likely pointing to mantle metasomatism (Oglialoro et al., 2017) from fluids carrying carbon from subducted sediments and/or altered oceanic crust (AOC).\n\nHow to cite: Sandoval Velasquez, A., Rizzo, A.

The latter provide evidence of magmatic processes in the lower crust and the lithospheric mantle. In this study we present textural and compositional data on twenty-eight pyroxenitic xenoliths from six localities from southern Scotland (Midland Valley and Southern Uplands Terranes).\n\nMost are interpreted as adcumulates (varying in grain size from fine to coarse) although some others are mesocumulates. They include both clinopyroxenites and websterites with variable amounts of olivine; phlogopite is present in only one sample. Cores of greenish clinopyroxene in three of the olivine clinopyroxenites are enveloped by brownish clinopyroxene, while one composite xenolith comprising coarse-grained olivine clinopyroxenite in sharp contact with harzburgite. Five groups, based on textural and mineralogical features were distinguished. Representatives of more than one group can be present in a single locality.\n\nMost of the samples from the same textural group share similar chemical composition. In general, the clinopyroxenes are Ti,Al-diopside/augite with Mg#=0.74-0.86; where clinopyroxenes are zoned the rims have lower Mg# and higher Al content. The orthopyroxene is an Al (±Cr)-enstatite with Mg#=0.78-0.89, olivine (Fo76-77) is relatively NiO-rich (0.16-0.29 wt.%). In clinopyroxenites the pyroxenes are LREE-enriched (LaN/LuN=1.31-3.17) with convex-upward REE patterns (SmN/LuN=2.48-7.37).\n\nThe temperatures and pressures of clinopyroxene crystallization in most of the clinopyroxenites are 1220-1300°C and 1.08–1.30 GPa (Putirka, 2008), respectively. Only the composite xenolith and the coarse-grained clinopyroxenites recorded higher pressures (1.42 and 1.65-2.03 GPa, respectively). As the Moho beneath S Scotland is located at ~35 km (corresponding to ~1 GPa; Davis et al., 2012), most of the clinopyroxenites are considered to come from the uppermost portions of lithospheric mantle or lowermost continental crust; the coarse-grained clinopyroxenites and the composite xenolith sample lithospheric mantle.\n\nClinopyroxenites from the southern Scotland crystallized from alkaline basaltic magmas similar to those that entrained them. Whilst Downes et al. (2007, 2001) had previously suggested this for clinopyroxenites from Midland Valley localities, our studies show that crystallization of mafic melts was more widespread. Strong chemical and textural variations in the pyroxenites together with relatively constant PT conditions of crystallization suggest that they formed either from melts of slightly different composition, perhaps in response to magma chamber processes such as magma replenishment and/ or mixing. While, the presence of mafic cumulates points to possible crustal underplating beneath S Scotland, the presence of a high-pressure clinopyroxenites and composite clinopyroxenitic-peridotitic xenolith imply that some of the pyroxenites originated in the lithospheric mantle.\n\nDavis et al.

The Indian-type mantle domain is a long-lived feature that can be traced back to, at least, the Palaeozoic Tethyan mantle domain. Little temporal constraints currently exist, however, regarding the longevity of Pacific-type mantle domain. The extinct Paleo-Asia Ocean (PAO), a subsidiary ocean of the Panthalassic Ocean that formed during the breakup of the Rodinia Supercontinent in Mesoproterozoic to Neoproterozoic, can provide a solution to this dilemma. Here, we report the first complete geochemical and Sr, Nd and high-precision Pb isotopic data set for representative mafic rock samples from ophiolites representing remnants of the PAO basement ranging in age from 275 to 624Ma to constrain the composition of their mantle provenance. Data suggest that the sub-PAO mantle has a similar long time-integrated, high Sm/Nd ratio as the global depleted upper mantle, but also shows typical Pacific MORB-like Pb isotopic compositions with lower 207Pb/204Pb(t) and 208Pb/204Pb(t) for given 206Pb/204Pb(t) ratios, and low radiogenic 208Pb*/206Pb*, indicating a long time-integrated, low Th/U ratios. Thus, the Pacific-type mantle domain, like the Indian-type mantle domain, is a long-lived secular mantle domain that can be traced back to early Paleozoic or even to the Neoproterozoic. Data further indicate that the Nd and Pb isotopic distinction between such two large-scale and long-term mantle domains is due to the different evolutionary and tectonic histories of the circum-Pacific (PAO, Paleo- and modern Pacific) and sub-Tethys-Indian oceanic mantle realms. The Panthalassic-Pacific ocean realm had remarkable permanency existing as a big ocean at lease throughout the Phanerozoic, that implies that continental materials were limit to recycle into underlying mantle, thus the underlying mantle was relative free of the continental material contamination and then produce the low time-integrated Th/U Pacific-type mantle domain. In contrast, the break-up of the Gondwana supercontinent makes the Tethys realms to experience repeated opening and closures, which transferred large volume of continental materials into the underlying mantle and then produce the high Th/U Indian-type mantle domain. Our results indicate that the high Sm/Nd and low Th/U ratio of Pacific-type mantle domain most likely are an inherited, long-standing intrinsic feature of the depleted upper mantle derived from the Earth's primordial mantle with less contamination of continental materials. In contrast, the large-scale and long-lived Indian-type mantle heterogeneity is produced by plate tectonic-driven continental material circulation in the upper mantle. Such a genetic link between plate tectonics and mantle chemical geodynamics is crucial to our understanding of how the Earth system works.\n\nThis study was financially supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (92055208，41772059) and the CAS “Light of West China” Program (2018-XBYJRC-003).\n\nHow to cite: Liu, X., Zhang, Z., Liu, P., Song, Y., and Xiao, Y.: Long-lived low Th/U Pacific-type isotopic mantle domain, EGU General Assembly 2021, online, 19–30 Apr 2021, EGU21-10496, https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-egu21-10496, 2021.\n\nMelt inclusions of very unusual nature occur in garnets of eclogites of the Granulitgebirge, Bohemian Massif. This is one of the first direct characterization of a preserved metasomatic melt responsible for the formation of eclogites enclosed in garnet peridotites. The inclusions are micrometric, from glassy to fully crystalized as nanogranitoids and randomly distributed in the garnet core. Nanogranitoids contain kumdykolite/albite, phlogopite, osumilite and kokchetavite with a variable amount of quartz, pyroxene, carbonate and rare white mica. The melt has a granitic composition rather than basaltic or tonalitic/trondhjemitic as would be expected from the partial melting of ultramafic or mafic rocks and it is as well hydrous and peraluminous. The trace elements composition is also unusual for melts in mantle rocks with elements typical of continental crust (Cs, Li, B, Pb and Rb) and subduction zone (Th and U). Similar signatures, i.e. continental crust and subduction, are visible also in the whole rock trace elements in the form of high amounts of LILE and U. The eclogite major elements composition is similar to a Ca- and Fe - rich mafic rock akin more to the crust than to the mantle.\n\nThe peculiar melt composition and the lack of a clear residue of a melting reaction in the eclogites suggest that this melt is external, i.e. metasomatic. It infiltered the peridotites during subduction of the continental crust at mantle depth and aided the transformation of basic layers, already in the peridotite, to eclogite. In addition, similar trace elements patterns to the melt reported here can be found in the so-called durbachite -ultrapotassic melanosyenite present in the high-grade Variscan basement- and in the garnet peridotites and garnet pyroxenites of the T-7 borehole. In both case metasomatism was suggested but the agent was just inferred based on the geochemical signature. All these occurrences suggest that mantle contaminated by melts from deeply subducted continental crust is widespread beneath the Bohemian Massif.\n\nHow to cite: Borghini, A., Ferrero, S., O'Brien, P.

In this study, we investigate the serpentinization of these protoliths. Numerous samples were collected in five different units, which represent ophiolitic dismembered pieces (Ty-Lan Peridotites (TLP) from the Audierne Complex, and Pont de Barel Peridotites (PBP), Folies Siffait Peridotites (FSP), l’Orgerais Peridotites (LOP) and Drain Peridotites (DP) from the Champtoceaux Complex). Field and microscopic observations together with Raman spectroscopy and electronic microprobe analysis (EMPA) allowed to identify several stages of serpentinization. All samples display a high rate of serpentinization, up to 80-90 %. Primary assemblage is represented by spinel (TLP, PBP, DP and LOP), olivine (TLP and FSP) and Ti-poor or Cr-rich pargasite (TLP and PBP). In all the samples, lizardite from olivine and bastites from pyroxene and amphibole characterize the first stage of serpentinization. It is associated with magnetite crystallization. No Al-rich lizardite meshe is identified by EMPA suggesting a low temperature (< 340°C) event. This serpentinization is followed by two generations of veins (V1 and V2). The V1 are Al-poor lizardite shear veins and crack-seal chrysotile veins characterize the V2. In PBP, microprobe mapping shows that V2 displays heterogeneous chemical chrysotile composition with significant variations of Al, Fe and Mg contents, suggesting metasomatism and/or variation of fluid composition during serpentinization. All these observations are closely similar to those of oceanic serpentinized peridotites. In the TLP, we identified a second stage of serpentinization characterized by antigorite after lizardite suggesting a high temperature event. In the OP, antigorite after lizardite was also identified. However, compared to the TLP ones, LOP antigorite is related to ductile (i.e., ultramylonite) deformations. This clearly indicates a high temperature stage of serpentinization (up to 500 °C). Furthermore, LOP ultramylonitized samples display one more chrysotile veins generation (V3) characterized by three distinct vein networks. The first one (V3a) is a crack-seal type vein network opened parallel to the main foliation. The second one (V3b) is perpendicular to the first one, whereas the third one (V3c) corresponds to tension gashes connected to C’ plans. This latter is perpendicular to V3a and V3b networks. The mylonitic foliation of LOP is similar to the surrounding micaschists schistosity, suggesting an orogenic high temperature stage of serpentinization. In the FSP, σ-type polycrystalline structures were identified. Lizardite meshes are progressively transposed and recrystallized into the foliation plan. This stage is associated with the crystallization of chlorite after tremolite, suggesting a retrograde stage of serpentinization during serpentinites exhumation. Finally, despite a great diversity of mantle-derived protoliths, our study shows that South-Armorican peridotites recorded a similar first low temperature oceanic stage of serpentinization. According to the Variscan history, it could have started during the Cambro-Ordovician for TLP, and during the Late Devonian for PBP, DP, LOP, FSP. Furthermore, some of these peridotites also recorded an orogenic serpentinization (LOP and FLP). Such observations provide new constraints that could be useful to a better understanding of the tectonometamorphic evolution of the South Armorican suture zones during the Variscan orogeny.\n\nHow to cite: Aertgeerts, G., Lahondère, D., Monnier, C., and Lorand, J.-P.: Multiple stages of serpentinization in mantle derived peridotites of the South Armorican Variscan suture zone, EGU General Assembly 2021, online, 19–30 Apr 2021, EGU21-11060, https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-egu21-11060, 2021.\n\nIn Central Evia island (Aegean-Greece) serpentinized ultramafic rocks appear as elongated thrust sheets or in the form of olistostromes incorporated within Maestrichtian-Paleocene flysch. These are crosscut by well-developed rodingite dykes that were derived from four main protoliths that include i) Boninites, ii) Island-arc Tholeiitic Basalts and Gabbros, iii) Alkaline basalts and iv) Calc-alkaline basalts. They mainly comprise of minerals that include (hydro)garnet + chlorite + clinopyroxene ± vesuvianite. Accessory minerals include spinel ± calcite ± prehnite ± amphibole ± orthopyroxene ± olivine ± quartz ± opaque Fe-Ti oxides. Rodingites that were formed at the expense of boninites and island-arc tholeiitic rocks were likely formed within a single rodingitization stage, since garnet is mainly grossular-rich and relict primary clinopyroxene has been preserved. The rodingitization of the alkaline and calc-alkaline basalts seems to have occurred as a multi-stage metasomatic process that occurred during the exhumation of the mafic-ultramafic mantle wedge complex. This resulted in the development of late-stage andradite, vesuvianite and in some cases of chlorite during derodingitization. In this case, successive reaction zones with variability in the participating mineral phases were developed. Geochemical results reveal remarkable rare earth element (REE) enrichments, especially in the inner zones, likely being the result of successive diffusion and element transfer. Few rodingites are characterized as calcite-bearing, whose stable 13C-18O isotopic data points to the restricted involvement of late-stage mixed hydrothermal and seawater-related carbonation processes.\n\nHow to cite: Karkalis, C., Magganas, A., Koutsovitis, P., and Ntaflos, T.: Rodingitization of mafic rocks from Central Evia (Greece) associated with serpentinite exhumation: Evidence from Petrological, Geochemical and Isotopic data , EGU General Assembly 2021, online, 19–30 Apr 2021, EGU21-3319, https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-egu21-3319, 2021.\n\nExtensive magmatic activities were developed in Central and Western Anatolia, since middle miocene to quaternary times, the most primitive lavas are situated in eastern end of Central (Sivas) and also western (Kula) Anatolia, besides Kula basalts are one of the most recent basaltic rocks together with basalts from south-central Anatolia. Although the magmatism is generally observed at several different locations, the recent basaltic rocks in both of the regions seem to be derived from the melting of the peridotite and pyroxenite source domains and the latter one was ignored in previous studies as source component.\n\nThe previous studies indicate that many of the basaltic rocks from Central and Western Anatolia are related with spinel-garnet transition, but typical Tb/Yb(N) (>1.8; [1]) and Zn/Fe (separates peridotite-derived (Zn/Fe <12; [2]) and pyroxenite-derived (Zn/Fe 13-20); [2] melts) Co/Fe ratios of the basaltic rocks from several volcanic centers from Central and Western Anatolia reveal that melting from the single source component are not solely capable of the producing basaltic rocks.\n\nSr-Nd and Pb isotopic compositions clearly display the distinction of samples which are linked to asthenospheric source. The lead isotopic systematic shows no siginificant differences among the Central and Western Anatolian basalts, of all the samples are above the NHRL line and close to EM II mantle component, Sr- Nd isotopes also display similar compositions as well, the majority of the samples are in and close to mantle array, but the Sr isotopic composition of Miocene aged Gediz and Simav lavas have high radiogenic values.\n\nTb/Yb(N), Zn/Fe ratios and as well as the Pb isotopic compositions and REE-based melting model reveal that Sivas, Erciyes Hasandağ, and Develidağ samples in central Anatolia, and Kula, Gediz basalt in western Anatolia seem to be derived from the amalgamated melting of pyroxenite and peridotite sources, besides, the sources melting is capable of the producing elemental variations in basaltic rocks related with either lithospheric delamination or lithospheric unstability\n\n1.Wang et al., 2002, J.Geophys.Res.vol:107,ECV 5 1-21\n\n2 .Le Roux, et al.,2011,EPSL, vol:307, 395-408\n\nThis study is financially supported by Hacettepe University, BAB project no: FHD-2018-17283\n\nHow to cite: Kurkcuoglu, B. and Yürür, T.: Sr-Nd-Pb isotopic significance of mantle source components from Central and Western Anatolia: Melting evidences from peridotite and pyroxenite source domains, EGU General Assembly 2021, online, 19–30 Apr 2021, EGU21-12162, https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-egu21-12162, 2021.\n\nFour OH stretching bands in the frequency range 3300 – 3700 cm-1 dominate the infrared spectra of lithospheric pyroxenes. Depending on their metasomatic history or geodynamic origin, they have characteristic OH signatures. Pyroxenes from continental lithosphere that undergone “wet” metasomatism have distinct signature of those having undergone “dry” metasomatism. Pyroxenes from oceanic lithosphere have yet a third type of signature. Our most recent analyses of xenoliths and a critical review of the literature show that the phenomenon is widely distributed among continents and oceans. The phenomenon affects simultaneously opx and cpx from the same rock and various lithologies: peridotites, pyroxenites and granulites. In continental lithosphere, pyroxenes affected by “wet” metasomatism are dominated by OH bands at 3600 and 3415 cm-1 for opx and 3635 and 3445 cm-1 for cpx . Whereas pyroxenes affected by “dry” metasomatism are dominated by OH bands at 3570 and 3515 cm-1 for opx and 3595 and 3515 cm-1 for cpx. Opxs from oceanic lithosphere have OH spectra dominated by the band at 3415 cm-1, and with a smaller by bands at 3520 and 3570 cm-1 (Fig. 1).\n\nIn all these observations it was not possible to correlate the signatures with a specific major, minor or trace element. Therefore, the exact nature of the observed signatures remains unidentified. Notwithstanding, these OH signatures are representative of specific lithospheric events and offer a potential new benchmark for the study of lithospheric processes.\n\nFig.1 : Schematic diagram showing the 3 types of signatures for opx.

We studied a sequence beneath the crustal section that exposes fresh, Cpx-bearing harzburgites and dunites that are underlain by serpentinized Cpx-bearing harzburgites and dunites. The rocks at the bottom are crosscut by dykes that have undergone different degrees of rodingitization. The modal compositions of peridotite from both fresh and serpentinized sections plot in abyssal upper mantle fields, with clinopyroxene modes less than 5 vol. %. Although harzburgites and dunites indicate that melt has been lost relative to primitive mantle compositions, the trace element patterns carry signatures of enrichment in incompatible elements, such as (i) “bowl-shaped” patterns of trace elements in silicate-Earth normalized spider diagrams, (ii) positive anomalies in highly incompatible trace elements such as Rb, Th, U, Ta, and (iii) enrichment of LREE in the clinopyroxenes from dunites and harzburgites. These features are indicative of complex melt transfer processes and cannot be produced by simple melt extraction. Petrographic studies reveal that harzburgite and dunite contain interstitial polyphase aggregates of olivine + Cpx + spinel + Opx and olivine + Cpx + Spinel, respectively. Experimental studies (e.g. Morgan and Liang, 2003) suggest that these aggregates represent frozen melt-rich components, indicating that fertile melt was percolating through the depleted harzburgite – dunite matrix. Presence of such “melt pods” would explain the trace element enrichment patterns of the bulk rock, as well as features such as reverse zoning (core: Cr, Fe2+ rich, rim: Al, Mg rich) of spinels in polyphase aggregates in fresh dunites. These results show that melt extraction from the mantle is not a single stage process, and that evidence of multiple melt pulses that propagated through a rock are preserved in the petrographic features as well as in the form of chemical signatures that indicate refertilization of initially depleted rocks.\n\nHow to cite: Zhao, L., Chakraborty, S., and Schertl, H.-P.: Ophiolitic peridotites in Xigaze (Tibet): Constraints on modes of melt transport in the mantle, EGU General Assembly 2021, online, 19–30 Apr 2021, EGU21-8372, https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-egu21-8372, 2021.\n\nPyroxenites constitute the major form of heterogeneity in the upper mantle. Their occurrence in supra-subduction zone settings is mostly testified by veins and layers in refractory ophiolitic peridotites, where they represent a crucial witness of melt migration in the forearc/subarc environment [1,2]. The New Caledonia ophiolite hosts one of the largest forearc mantle section worldwide, providing a unique perspective into upper mantle processes. The sequence is dominated by ultra-depleted harzburgites [3], locally overlain by mafic-ultramafic cumulates [4,5,6]. The harzburgites are highly refractory residues that register a multi-phase evolution, including fluid-assisted melting in a forearc environment and contamination by fluid- and melt inputs triggered by Eocene subduction [1]. Pyroxenitic rocks intruding the harzburgites are only known in the Bogota peninsula shear zone, which records HT deformation along a paleotransform fault [7]. In this contribution, we report a comprehensive petrological and geochemical characterization on a new set of pyroxenites from this locality. The pyroxenites (~5-15 cm-thick) generally cut the peridotite foliation at variable angles, but concordant, locally boudinaged, layers also occur. Pyroxenite textures range from cumulitic to porphyroclastic or granoblastic-polygonal. The studied samples mostly consist of amphibole-bearing (5-44 vol.%) websterites, with variable amounts of orthopyroxene (27-67 vol.%) and almost constant clinopyroxene contents (~ 25-29 vol.%). Minor olivine-bearing orthopyroxenites are also present. Accessory phases include high-Ca (An= 82-86 mol%) plagioclase, Cr-rich spinel (Cr# = 50-61), sulfides and, occasionally, apatite. Pyroxenes displays high Mg# (Mg# Opx= 91-92; Mg# Cpx= 84-93), coupled with low Al2O3 contents (0.97-1.92 wt% and 1-2.42 wt% for orthopyroxene and clinopyroxene, respectively). Amphibole is high Mg# edenite. Application of conventional pyroxene thermometry yield equilibration temperatures ranging between 930-1040°C, comparable to the enclosing harzburgites (~ 950°C), whereas amphibole-plagioclase geothermometer provides lower temperatures (~ 800°C). Bulk rock composition of the websterites show variable Mg# (82-91) and REE concentrations ranging between 1 to 10 times chondritic values. They are characterized by flat to LREE-depleted (LaN/SmN 0.28-0.92) patterns, coupled to weak MREE-HREE fractionation (GdN/YbN = 1.73-1.92) and Eu negative anomalies. By contrast, orthopyroxenites display notably lower concentrations (0.1≤REE≤1 chondrite abundances). As a whole, clinopyroxene REE patterns of the websterites mirror bulk rocks at higher absolute values. Putative melts in equilibrium with clinopyroxene indicate strongly enriched compositions (up to 300 times chondritic values) coupled to variable LREE-HREE fractionation (LaN/LuN = 3-19) and flat to fractionated HREE (GdN/LuN 1-2). Such enriched liquids, which show some analogies with pre-obduction adakite-like dikes [8], have never been recorded in the MTZ cumulitic sequence of the New Caledonia ophiolite and shed new light on the magmatic activity in the early stage of subduction.\n\n[1] Varfalvy, Canad Mineral, 1997, 35 (2), 543-570.\n\n[2] Berly et al., J.

It is formed of well-preserved mantle and crustal sections which exhibit Supra-Subduction Zone affinity (e.g. Dilek and Furnes 2009, Lithos). Lower part of the mantle section of the Kukesi massif consist mainly of harzburgites, whereas dunites are located close to Moho. Crustal section records transition from lower part formed by peridotites and pyroxenites (so called intermediate zone after Hoxha and Boullier 1995, Tectonophysics) to gabbros. In this study we focus on composition and origin of pyroxenites occurring in the mantle and lower crustal parts of the Kukesi massif.\n\nIn this study we studied 9 samples. They have composition of olivine websterite, clinopyroxenite, orthopyroxenite, hornblende-clinopyroxenite and websterite. Five of the analyzed samples have mantle origin (M): we studied (M)-olivine websterites and (M)-clinopyroxenite from harzburgitic part, as well as two (M)-orthopyroxenitic veins (one with clinopyroxenitic central part - composite vein) with minor amphibole cross-cutting dunites from one locality. From intermediate zone in crustal (C) part we collected (C)-hornblende-clinopyroxenites and (C)-websterite.\n\nClinopyroxene composition is homogeneous in (M)-olivine-websterites (Mg#=84.5-87 and 88.8-90.5; Al=0.07-0.1 and 0.05-0.07, respectively), (M)-clinopyroxenite (Mg#=84-86, Al=0.04-0.08), (C)-hornblende-clinopyroxenites (Mg#=88.5-91, Al=0.08-0.12a.p.f.u.) and (C)-websterite (Mg#=87-88; Al=0.13-0.16a.p.f.u.). It differs widely between (M)-orthopyroxenitic veins: from Mg#=85-94 and Al=0.02-0.08 a.p.f.u in clinopyroxenitic part of composite vein to Mg#=93.6-95 and Al=0.01-0.03 in the purely orthopyroxenitic one. Orthopyroxene from two samples of (M)-olivine websterites have either Mg#=83 and Al~0.07 a.p.f.u (Foolivine=81.5) or Mg#=87 and Al~0.04 a.p.f.u (Foolivine=86). Orthopyroxene composition in composite(M)-vein varies in wide ranges (Mg#=83-89; Al=0.04-0.08 a.p.f.u.); the other vein is homogeneous (Mg#=90-91, Al=0.02-0.03 a.p.f.u, Foolivine=86.8-90); in (C)-websterite orthopyroxene has Mg#=82.4-84 and Al=0.12-0.14 a.p.f.u. Amphibole has composition of tremolite-actinolite. Spinel, where present, is highly chromian (Cr#=0.59-0.80).\n\nClinopyroxene is LREE-depleted in most of the samples, the (La/Lu)N=0.03-0.08. It is also LREE-depleted in (M)-clinopyroxenite ((La/Lu)N=0.05-0.23), but the contents of trace elements are higher than in other samples (eg. LuN=0.79-2.75 vs. 0.40-0.85). In (M)-veins the LREE contents are approximately at primitive mantle level ((La/Lu)N=0.28-1.66). Clinopyroxene in all samples has positive Th-U, Pb and Sr anomalies and negative Ta and Zr anomalies, but concentrations of trace elements is significantly higher in (M) clinopyroxenite and veins.\n\nThe presence of tremolite and actinolite points to a retrogressive metamorphism which affected the rocks. The LREE-depleted nature of clinopyroxene forming all the pyroxenites and presence of orthopyroxene point to crystallization of the rocks from tholeiitic melt, but variations in Mg# and REE content in clinopyroxene may reflect formation either from different generations of melts or from melts fractionated due to reactive percolation. Variations in composition of the parental melts is visible even in a scale of one outcrop, which is demonstrated by (M)-orthopyroxenite veins with various modal composition and mineral major and trace elements compositions.\n\nThis study was financed from scientific funds for years 2018-2022 as a project within program “Diamond Grant” (DI 024748).\n\nHow to cite: Mikrut, J., Matusiak-Małek, M., Puziewicz, J., and Onuzi, K.: Pyroxenites of Kukesi Massif, Mirdita Ophiolite – geological record for magmatic system in SSZ environment – preliminary results, EGU General Assembly 2021, online, 19–30 Apr 2021, EGU21-15136, https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-egu21-15136, 2021.\n\nThe Masirah ophiolite is one of the few true ocean ridge ophiolites that have been preserved (Rollinson, 2017) and lacks any indication that it formed in a subduction environment. The Masirah ophiolite in south-eastern Oman is a different and older ophiolite from the more famous northern Oman ophiolite. Chromite and copper ores comprise large deposits in the Samail ophiolite, northern Oman. In comparison, chromite and copper deposits have not been described in previous reports or previous exploration in Masirah ophiolite. Rollinson (2017) has proposed that the apparent absence of chromitites in the mantle section of Masirah ophiolite is an important discriminant between subduction related and ocean ridge ophiolites. However, during recent studies on the Batain ophiolite mélange, and Masirah ophiolite, several chromitite pods have been discovered. The chromitites occur as separated small concordant, lenticular pods (3–10 m in thickness), which have been extensively altered and deformed, with the host pyroxenite serpentinites serpentinized harzburgites and dunites. The largest chromitite pods found within the pyroxenite and dunite of Masirah are up to 10 m across. Unusual minerals and mineral inclusions (orthopyroxene, clinopyroxene, amphibole, phlogopite, serpentine, native Fe, FeO, alloy, sulfide, calcite, laurite, celestine and halite) within chromite have been observed in the chromitites from the Masirah ophiolites. The existence of hydrous silicate inclusions in the chromite calls for a role of hydration during chromite genesis. Both phlogopite and hornblende were possibly formed from alkali-rich hydrous fluids/melts trapped within the chromite during the chromitite formation. High-T green hornblende and phlogopite included in the chromites is evidence of the introduction of water in the magma at the end of the chromite crystallization. Such paragenesis points to the presence of hydrous fluids during the activity of the shear bands. The chromitites parental magmas are rich in K, Na, LREE, B, Cs, Pb, Sr, Li, Rb and U relative to HREE, reflecting the alkalic fluids/melts that prevailed during the chromitites genesis.\n\nThe mineral inclusions in association with host peridotites may have been brought by the uprising asthenosphere at mid-oceanic ridges due to the mantle convection. It appears that this chromite has been formed through reaction between amid-ocean-ridge basalt-melt with depleted harzburgite in the uppermost mantle. The chromitite deposits have similar cr# (55-62% Al-chromitites), mg# Al2O3 and TiO2 contents to spinels found in MORB, and have been interpreted as having formed in amid-ocean ridge setting. This suggests that this chromitites is residual from lower degree, partial melting of peridotite, which produced low-Cr# chromitites at the Moho transition zone, possibly in a mid-ocean-ridge setting. The chemistry of both mineral inclusions and chromite suggests MORB-related tectonic setting for the chromitites that were crystallized at 1000 °C–1300 °C under pressures <3 GPa . The host peridotites were generated during the proto-Indian Ocean MORB extension and emplaced as a result of the obduction of the ophiolite over the Oman Continental margin during Late Cretaceous-Early Paleocene.\n\nRollinson, H., 2017.

Near the base of the ophiolite mantle section, some peridotites underwent 100% carbonation from metasomatic introduction of CO2-bearing fluids <200°C to form listvenites during the time of emplacement (97 ± 29 Ma, Falk and Kelemen, 2015). The carbonate rocks comprise mostly magnesite and/or dolomite, quartz, Cr-spinel, and Fe-(hydr)oxides; with carbonates as the sole Mg-minerals and quartz as the only silicate phase. The aim of this study is to chemically and petrographically investigate the Fe-bearing minerals within the fluid-altered mantle rocks in drill core samples from hole BT1B of the ICDP Oman Drilling Project. Sequential chemical extractions are useful for recognizing iron pools based on the minerology. We investigated the quantities of Fe-oxide/hydroxide phases through a series of chemical extractions (Poulton and Canfield, 2005) via atomic absorption spectroscopy in addition to optical microscope, SEM/EDS, EPMA/WDS and ICP analysis. Extractions performed at room temperature and one at 50°C included: carbonate-associated Fe (sodium acetate) targeting siderite, HCl-extractable Fe(II), reducible oxides (citrate-dithionite) targeting hematite and possible goethite, and magnetite (oxalate). Carbonate-based Fe in the listvenites from a sodium acetate extraction ranges from 12-28 mg/g, while the same extraction performed at 50°C for twice as long resulted in higher proportions of carbonate-associated Fe (15-35 mg/g). Easily reducible iron quantities from the diluted HCl solution extraction display the lowest overall Fe fractions (0.75-5.5 mg/g) following the room temperature acetate and 0.63-1.7 mg/g after the 50°C acetate extraction. Fe in reducible oxides extracted by dithionite ranged from 1.4-15 mg/g with similar result after both a room-temperature acetate and a 50°C acetate step. Oxalate extraction succeed"
