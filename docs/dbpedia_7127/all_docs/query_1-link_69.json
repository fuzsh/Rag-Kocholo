        "text": "hasSummary\n\nThis data set provides a stochastic event set of flood inundation depth maps (fluvial flood hazard footprints) for the German part of the Danube catchment for current and future climate in GEOTIFF format.. The maps provide inundation depth information in cm above ground level on a 100 m grid along the major rivers (4150 km) based on 2D hydro-numeric simulations. Flood event sets are derived for the historical period (1970-1990) and two RCPs (4.5 and 8.5) for the near future (2020-2049) and far future (2070-2099) for four CORDEX models. These flood event sets are created within continuous long-term simulations of a coupled model chain including the IMAGE stochastic multi-variable, multi-site weather generator, the eco-hydrological model SWIM and 1D river network coupled with 2D hydro-numeric hinterland inundation model. 10,000 years of continuous daily simulation of meteorological fields are available for each time period, rcp and climate model. The current version of the flood inundation data sets includes 100 years of simulations. 1D model cross section geometries are based on 10m DEM (BKG), adjustment of dike heights in model calibration. 2D hinterland simulation using LISFLOOD-FP inertia model on a 100m grid resampled from 10 m DEM. Key usages of the data are large-scale flood risk assessment, future flood risk assessment and flood risk management with long-term perspective. The data have been produced within the OASIS+ demonstrator project 'Future Danube Multi Hazard and Risk Model' funded by Climate-KIC in the period from January 2016 to December 2017."
