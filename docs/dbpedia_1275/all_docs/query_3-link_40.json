        "text": "Craig Thomas\n\nCraig Thomas is a young PGA of Great Britain & Ireland Fellow Professional who has held a number of roles within golf. In 2009 he became a full time coach and specialised in coaching golfers with disabilities. This lead to him achieving a number of National Awards one being Midlands PGA of GB&I Professional of the year and a number of award nominations.\n\nCraig has coached a number of European and World Disabled Champions. This has has helped him to become globally recognised in this field and given him the opportunity to help train his fellow Professionals through the PGA Inclusive Golf Coaching workshops. Craig volunteers for the European Disabled Golf Association and its Sports Committee is also a PGA Level 1 and 2 Tutor and Assessor.\n\nDan Killen\n\nFirstly it is a pleasure to be presenting along side such colleagues within the industry that have all had such a positive impact on developing the game we all love. I am lucky enough to say that I would not be where I am in my life without being introduced to golf; this is one of the main driving forces for me within my role in developing the game.\n\nMy father introduced me to golf at the age of 10, something looking back now I wish had happened earlier. Golf has always been my main passion in life from an early age. SNAG was introduced to me 6 years ago, after using the product and helping to introduce children and beginners to the game, I developed an interest in golf development.\n\nFollowing the success of this I was approached by then company responsible for SNAG to work with the product on a day-to-day basis, an opportunity I could not refuse. Although not involved in the direct delivery on a daily basis I was introduced into the broader spectrum of developing the game globally.\n\nAfter nearly 4 years I was presented with the opportunity to work at the award winning Quinta Do Lago resort in Portugal. Giving me an opportunity to experience an alternative side of the golf industry, something I thought would be a great experience, personally, professionally and the prospect of sun all year round was hard to turn down. After some time in Portugal I was offered the chance to rekindle my love of SNAG, with my current company GSA Golfsports in Germany. Even in the short time away from SNAG it is exciting to see how the concept has developed and the exciting opportunities ahead.\n\nGSA Golfsports\n\nGSA Golfsports was created to help develop and produce customized golf concepts and offer a personal consulting service for sports associations, school associations, private companies and charitable organizations.\n\nIt was always the vision of Christian Piott member of the PGA of Germany and Managing Director of GSA to offer contemporary solutions for everyone one whether young, old, experienced golfer or non-golfer and to adapt to the needs of today’s market. “We need modern concepts to get more people to play golf, today’s generation want to spend their leisure time with their friends and family”.\n\nGSA Golfsports has been the holder of the general licenses for SNAG within Germany since 2010 and then expanding on to Central Europe. Following their expansion in April 2015 they acquired the SNAG general licenses for Europe, Middle East, Africa and India. Since acquiring this license they have developed the offering of SNAG from the concepts behind it, to the complete teaching program. They have implemented several new ideas on the international development of golf.\n\nDavid Kearney\n\nDavid Kearney is a member of the Professional Golfers Association and has enjoyed a distinguished career as a teaching professional and mentor to many professional and amateur golfers.\n\nDavid began his playing career at Claremorris Golf club in Co.Mayo, in the west of Ireland and would soon move to The Royal County Down golf club where he began his apprenticeship under the watchful eye of Kevan Whitson. His passion for coaching was further fuelled by watching Kevan teach and handle pupils of varying levels.\n\n2010 saw David take up his current post at Grange Golf Club in Dublin. Home of 2014 Ryder Cup Captain Paul McGinley, Grange and David have worked diligently to improve coaching available to its members and in particular the implementation of a strong junior programme has been one of the major successes in the last 3 years. In 2010 for example the club had 1 girl U-18 years with a handicap and today they have 12 U-16 girls with a Handicap of 35 or less. Similar progress has been made on the boy’s side and part of David’s remit as a representative of the PGA and ILGU is to encourage similar progress at his fellow professional’s club when he speaks at various workshops and training days.\n\nDavid has been involved in disabled golf with his student Charlie Gannon being the poster boy for what can be achieved. Charlie was very ill in hospital with meningitis in 2010 and lost his left arm from the elbow down, fingers on his right hand and portions of his feet. In his hospital bed, Charlie announced his preferred choice for his new clubs in spite of his condition and we are happy to report 4 years on with the aid of a “Tropman Grip” which replaces his left arm, he has his new clubs and is playing off a 17 handicap in his home club, Castlebar, Co.Mayo.\n\nIn a career full of ups and downs, David is very happy in his chosen career and his main professional interest continues to be improving himself and those around him.\n\nView David’s Full Biography\n\nIan Peek\n\nFull-time golf coach and “Sports Coaching” Masters degree student Ian Peek turned professional in 1987.\n\nIn the early 1990s Ian played on the Asian, South American and European Challenge Tours before founding the Impact Golf Academy in Germany.

In June 2008 the same magazine named Ian as one of the leading 50 golf coaches in Germany.\n\nIan has developed three successful golf training-aids and his ‘Fault Fixer’, ‘PSP-Perfect Swing Plane’ and “3p” have sold to golf coaches and golfers in over 30 countries worldwide.\n\nIan has acted as the R&A golf consultant to the Golf Federations of Honduras, Chile and Bangladesh, is a British PGA swing tutor and a qualified PGA tournament referee.

After playing for many years as an amateur and after turning professional, he gave my first lessons. It was back then when he discovered his vocation in teaching.\n\n“I must say I am very lucky to continue (after 20 years in the golf industry) doing what I like, which is teaching. Throughout this time I have met many people from different countries who I am grateful for sharing experiences as they have helped me become a better professional every day.”\n\nIn 2014, after being National Coach, Training and Technical Director of the Center of Excellence of the Royal Spanish Golf Federation, Jesús decided to follow his dream of creating an efficient, dynamic and fun teaching method for both adults and children.
