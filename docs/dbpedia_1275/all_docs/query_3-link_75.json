        "text": "Two years ago, I accidentally stumbled onto an article talking about Bitcoin. While I can’t say I learned what Bitcoin was in a great level of detail from that one-pager (admittedly, it took some more research), I felt instantly captivated by the promise of seismic financial services shift. The significance of Bitcoin for me, as a proof of concept, suggested we could witness a fairer, more transparent and more inclusive financial industry – reason enough to be very, very excited.\n\nTulip fever or the new gold rush:\n\nAt the height of my honeymoon period, learning about both Bitcoin and Blockchain, I found it easy to attribute the cryptocurrency’s meteoritic price surge to growing confidence in and acceptance of the underlying technology. As time passed, many more similar assets appeared. Some built upon the original idea, aiming to resolve scalability and anonymity issues, which make Bitcoin somewhat unpalatable for mass adoption by the financial establishment. Others, however, were just more of the same. As a result, my perceptions of cryptocurrencies started to shift. While I am still a great believer in the potential of Bitcoin, Ethereum and Ripple as effective testing grounds for a new infrastructure model, I feel the current pricing is mostly rooted in speculation and financial opportunism. Moreover, in the relatively unregulated space within which these assets are traded, many of the “alt-coins” (the generic name for an alternative, lesser-known cryptocurrencies) have turned into speculative musical chairs for the bold, the brave and the stupid. Former Dutch central bank president Nout Wellink’s 2013 statement comparing bitcoin to 17th century Tulip mania started to feel increasingly prescient, with JP Morgan veteran Jamie Dimon warning in late 2017 that he would fire on the spot any of his traders caught trading Bitcoin.\n\nThat said, not everyone in the industry feels the same. Goldman Sachs has just announced it is considering opening a Bitcoin trading desk due to customer demand. It will be riveting to observe how long it will take the other big players to follow suit. While recent liquidity regulation has dampened the enthusiasm for the proprietary trading of high-risk assets, the same cannot be said when clients’ investments are concerned.\n\nWhile from a sustainable and responsible investment perspective I do somewhat agree with both Mr. Dimon and Mr. Wellink, I find the rhetoric deeply unhelpful, both for the wider investment community as well as for businesses seeking investment to grow. Given the major drive to invest in blockchain solutions, it is clear that the underlying technology, not an individual cryptocurrency, will drive the global financial realignment. For this reason, I will aim to shift the conversation away from the imminent price correction. I will be exploring the trifecta of the biggest crypto assets – Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Ripple – what they are, what they do, and why we should be excited.\n\nBitcoin:\n\nThe term first appeared in late 2008, in a white paper authored by an anonymous programmer writing under the pseudonym Satoshi Nakamoto. The paper outlined the first digital, decentralized, peer-to-peer payment system, with proof of concept coming to life in early 2009. What makes Bitcoin so noteworthy is that it was also the first electronic payment system to solve the “double spend” problem without the use of central intermediaries. Unlike cash, sending money online resembles emailing a pdf – you send a copy and keep the original. This leaves open the opportunity to spend the same amount of funds on multiple purchases and thus defraud the recipients. In the current financial system, this is resolved by the use of banks, clearing houses, credit card companies and other trusted intermediaries. Under Bitcoin’s proof-of-work settlement paradigm, however, with the help of distributed databases (not exactly a new concept) and some clever cryptography, the entire network ensures that two complete strangers can send funds to each other with virtually zero opportunity for fraud and theft.\n\nIt is worth noting that at conception Bitcoin was not intended as money or currency to rival dollars, euros or sterling. It was dreamt up as a payment system to facilitate the safe and secure exchange of value between two unknown parties. As such, the high level of encryption required to ensure the trust-less environment (read not requiring trust, as opposed to lacking trust) creates a significant scalability issue, both in terms of speed and electricity consumption, and hinders wider adoption. For comparison, the Bitcoin network is still only able to process an average of 7 transactions per second – faster than the 2 to 3 days for clearing securities, but much slower than the several tens of thousands processed by Visa per second. Moreover, it uses more energy than 159 countries.\n\nEthereum:\n\nEthereum is an open-source, public, blockchain-based distributed computing platform proposed by the Canadian cryptocurrency researcher and programmer Vitalik Buterin in 2013. Unlike Bitcoin, Ethereum allows significantly more freedom to participants in developing a number of applications on the platform. While Ethereum also offers a token that can be exchanged between different accounts on the network, known as Ether, the payment system is only one of many possibilities on offer. As of May 2017, after years of development and pushback, Ethereum’s founder has announced a new plan and implementation guide to update the algorithm that keeps its entire network in sync – from proof of work (like Bitcoin) to proof of stake. The move aims to make major advancements in both the speed of the network and the electricity consumption required to run it.\n\nBut the most exciting feature is the smart contracts functionality. Contrary to their name, smart contracts are not legal agreements but are in fact an automation tool. Smart contracts allow the execution of certain features upon meeting certain predetermined conditions. For example, if such a system is used to manage auto-lease parc, car engines will be automatically disabled when late payments occur. Similarly, in a financial services context, they can be particularly handy to manage trade finance invoices and payments, mortgage lending and automated claims processing, bringing about significant efficiency and cost-saving benefits.\n\nRipple:\n\nRipple, the smallest of the trifecta of leading cryptocurrencies, is entirely payment, remittance and currency exchange focused. When we live in an age where we can pretty much do anything on a global scale instantly and for free, why do global SWIFT payments have to be so expensive, unreliable and take so long to process? That is the question Arthur Britto, David Schwartz, and Ryan Fugger decided to answer when they founded Ripple in 2012.\n\nBuilt on a distributed open source internet protocol, a consensus register and a currency named XRP, Ripple is the third-largest player in the cryptocurrency market by market cap, with good reason: its currency, XRP, is highly optimized for institutional use in global payments. Unlike BTC, which can handle an average of 7 transaction/second, XRP can handle over 1500 transactions while being a much cheaper option.\n\nBut there are a few things that really set Ripple apart from other cryptocurrencies. It has been developed by a traditional tech firm with a leadership team bringing together decades of experience in technology, financial services and compliance (the CEO was involved in the birth of the Internet of Information!) and a team of world-class engineers. In addition, Ripple and its CEO are very transparent and communicative on social media platforms (including Twitter and Quora) regarding the latest developments of the technology.\n\nRipple is on track to become the ruler of the Internet of Money, as its technology is the most compatible with banks’ infrastructure, and would thus be easiest to implement as a solution. There has already been growing adoption by banks, with the likes of UBS, Royal Bank of Canada, Santander, and UniCredit announcing they are experimenting with Ripple.\n\nConclusion:\n\nTo answer the big question “to invest or not to invest” is always difficult. This article does not aim to convince one way or the other but I hope only to offer a little context and starting point for further investigation in the exciting world of cryptocurrencies. As much as they may be a tempting investment opportunity, I strongly feel that their historical significance greatly exceeds their ability to yield short-term returns. Moreover, they are the first step of a technological revolution to change the financial world, as we know it. If I can, however, share one piece of advice that a wise man told me, never invest what you are not prepared to lose.\n\nDisclaimer: this publication reflects my personal views and not the views of my current or former employers."
