        "text": "In every game Damozzio Harris played this season, it was just a matter of time before the standout running back from Jenkins made his presence felt.\n\nThe Warriors had arguably the best season in school history — winning the Region 3-3A title and advancing to the GHSA Class 3A state semifinals for the first time since 1966 — and Harris was a huge reason why.\n\nIn many of the Warriors’ blowout victories, Harris went off early on racking up big numbers before taking a seat on the bench to give the reserves a chance. In some of the closer games and into the postseason, Harris sometimes started a bit slower before wearing down the opponent with his relentless style and striking for a game-changing play in the second half.\n\nHarris rushed for 1,740 yards (9.1 yards per carry) and 27 touchdowns and added 11 receptions for 106 yards and another score. He is the Savannah Morning News Football Player of the Year.\n\n“What impressed me most about Damozzio this year was how unselfish he was as a person,” Jenkins coach Jason Cameron said. “We pulled him early from so many games and that really affected his stats — they could have been even higher. But he doesn’t care about his personal numbers. He has that team-first attitude.”\n\nThe 5-foot-9, 185-pounder comes from a football family. His first cousins Jakeen Harris and Chris Harris starred at Benedictine. Jakeen is now a safety with North Carolina State, while Chris is a linebacker at Georgia Southern. His uncle, Leroy Harris, starred at Savannah High and went on to play for Arkansas State before a six-year career as a running back in the NFL that started with the Miami Dolphins and ended with the Philadelphia Eagles in 1982.\n\n“My family history means a lot to me,” Harris said. “It motivates me to push myself to be as good as they are. I want to keep up the family name.”\n\nHarris transferred to Jenkins from Windsor Forest, where he rushed for 1,187 yards as a sophomore and had 402 yards receiving — scoring 15 total touchdowns to earn All-Greater Savannah first-team honors.\n\nFor the 2019 season, the junior said his most memorable game was the regular-season finale -- a 34-9 victory over Benedictine that clinched the region crown. Harris had 145 yards and a pair of scores in that win.\n\nGet high school sports news delivered to your inbox: Sign up for our morning, afternoon and evening newsletters\n\nHis biggest game statistically came in an overtime loss in Week 2 to South Effingham, when he racked up 258 yards and three scores on 22 carries.\n\n“The game against Benedictine was big — we have that rivalry aspect going with them and I’ll never forget winning that region championship,” Harris said.\n\nHarris said he improved this season by working with water aerobics to improve his speed.\n\n“I’ve been fast since I was little, and now that I’m getting older my power is catching up with my speed. Now it’s the total package,” said Harris, who has an offer from Mercer. “When I run, the first hole I see I’m going to hit it fast and go with it.”\n\nCameron thinks Harris has the potential to become a great player in college and beyond.\n\n“He’s got such great vision. It will look like nothing is there and then Damozzio will come flying out of a crease,” Cameron said. “He’s always making something out of nothing, and he’ a bruiser when he has to be. He’s a physical runner with breakaway speed.\n\n“There is no doubt in my mind he is a Division I guy,” Cameron said. “He is small, but he is strong and quick. He has all the intangibles. You can throw size away — he’s just a football player.”\n\nThe 2019-20 players and coaches of the year and first-team selections will be honored in May at the 10th annual Savannah Morning News/savannahnow.com Best of Preps banquet.\n\nTuesday: Boys cross country, Grady Coppock, Savannah Christian\n\nWednesday: Girls cross country, Kayla Gholar, Richmond Hill\n\nThursday: Volleyball, Lexi Polychrones, Savannah Christian\n\nFriday: Softball, Addie Reynolds, Effingham County\n\nSaturday: Football offense, Jalen Rouse, Richmond Hill\n\nSunday: Football defense, Taurus Simmons, Jenkins\n\nToday: Football overall player of the year, Damozzio Harris, Jenkins\n\nPLAYERS OF THE YEAR"
