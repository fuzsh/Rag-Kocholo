        "text": "Younger NFL fans can’t imagine how many great running backs played in the 1970s. Some teams had two, even three, outstanding runners on the same team. Here’s my list of some forgotten greats.\n\nWhatever happened to the running game? Call me old-fashioned, but I miss the days when offenses would pound away at defenses with a solid running game.\n\nI suppose some people see that as boring. They call it ‘Three Yards and a Cloud of Dust.” But in my opinion, today’s game is boring: pass after pass after pass…penalty after penalty after penalty.\n\nHow I miss 1970s football! It was the decade of the running back. And there were so many great running back combinations, too. Consider these combos.\n\nThe Cowboys had Walt Garrison, 1969 Rookie of the Year Calvin Hill, and 1970 ROY Duane Thomas. In Super Bowl VI those three ran for a combined 252 yards on 48 attempts. QB Roger Staubach threw just 19 times.\n\nThe Packers had 1971 ROY John Brockington and MacArthur Lane. In 1972 those two ran for a combined 1,848 yards.\n\nThe Cardinals had speedy Terry Metcalf, along with bruising fullback, Jim Otis. In 1975 they ran for a combined 1,892 yards.\n\nThe Rams had Lawrence McCutcheon alongside another bruising fullback, Jim Bertelsen. Together they combined for 1,951 yards in 1973.\n\nThe Steelers had Hall of Famer Franco Harris and Vietnam vet Rocky Blier. In Super Bowl IX against the Vikings–the famed “Purple People Eaters”–Harris ran for 158 yards on 34 carries and Terry Bradshaw threw only 14 passes. The following season Harris and Blier combined for a staggering 2,164 yards.\n\nThe Dolphins had possibly the best combination of running backs ever: Hall of Famer Larry Csonka, speedy Eugene “Mercury” Morris, and reliable Jim Kiick. In 1972 the Dolphins became the first and only undefeated team in NFL history. They also were the first team to have two running backs gain at least 1,000 yards in a season: Csonka had 1,117 yards and Morris had an even 1,000 yards. Add Kiick’s 521 yards and the trio had a combined 2,638 yards! The running game was so dominant that QB Bob Griese threw only 18 passes, combined, in two Super Bowl victories. (Compare that to today’s game. In 2015 quarterbacks threw an average of 36 times per game.)\n\nBut the sad reality, too, is that many great backs of the 70s had careers cut short by injuries, especially knee injuries. There was no arthroscopic surgery in those days and rehab and physical therapy were nowhere near what they are today.\n\nLet’s take a look back at some of those great backs–runners who might have gone onto the HOF if it were not for injuries that shortened their careers. This list is in no particular order."
