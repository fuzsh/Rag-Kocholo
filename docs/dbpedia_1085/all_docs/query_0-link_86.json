        "text": "With the Pro Football Hall of Fame Class of 2022 officially enshrined, we thought it would be fun to examine where all 354 HOF’ers attended high school. I use the word “attended” because several Hall of Famers didn’t play varsity high school football, according to our research.\n\nTim Mara, the founding owner of the New York Giants, is an example of this. The Hall of Fame Class of 1963 inductee dropped-out of school at the age of 13 to get a job to help his family.\n\nThen there’s Tim’s son Wellington, who at the tender age of 14 was given 50-percent ownership in the team, along with his old brother Jack. Wellington attended the Loyola School in Manhattan in the early 30’s. However, the school located near Central Park has never had a football program, which isn’t unusual in the city.\n\nThe State of California leads the way with 40 HOF’ers, who played football scholastically in the Golden State. Pennsylvania is second with with 37, followed by Texas 30 and Ohio with 29. Illinois is fifth on the list with 20 Hall of Famers.\n\nGeorge Washington Prep in Los Angeles is one of ten schools with two Hall of Famers. Wide receiver James Lofton was enshrined with the Class of 2003. Halfback Hugh McElhenny played for the Generals in the late 40’s.\n\nRaines High School in Jacksonville Florida has two HOF’ers — wide receiver Harold Carmichael and cornerback Brian Dawkins.\n\nIn Illinois, Crane High School boasts two Canton honorees. NFL co-founder George Halas played for the Chicago school. Hugh “Shorty” Ray, who served as the NFL’s Supervisor of Officials from 1938 to 1952, attended Crane when it was known as Crane Manual Training School.\n\nSouth River High in New Jersey was the scholastic stomping grounds for wide receiver Drew Pearson and Alex Wojciechowicz, who was a two-way NFL star at center and linebacker from 1935 to 1950.\n\nBrooklyn, New York’s Erasmus Hall High School was the starting spot for future Oakland/Los Angeles Raiders owner Al Davis and quarterback Sid Luckman, who won four NFL championships with the Chicago Bears.\n\nThere’s some mystery surrounding whether Davis actually played varsity football at the school. He claimed he did, but, in later years, research by some in the media indicate that he did not.\n\nOregon’s Jefferson High School (Portland) claims modern day player Mel Renfro and Arnie Weinmeister from the 40’s.\n\nWith the induction of Art McNally this past weekend, Roman Catholic in Philadelphia has two HOF’ers. Wide receiver Marvin Harrison was enshrined as part of the Class of 2016.\n\nThe Haverford School, in suburban Philadelphia, was home to former NFL commissioner Bert Bell, who also served as the head coach of the Philadelphia Eagles and Pittsburgh Steelers. Before becoming commissioner, Bell was the owner of the Eagles and co-owner of the Steelers.\n\nSteve Sabol, who’s father Ed, founded NFL Films, attended Haverford. Ed Sabol is also enshrined in Canton.\n\nAliquippa High School, in western Pennsylvania, could become the first school to have three Hall of Fame players. Early next year, cornerback Darrelle Revis is expected to become part of the Class of 2023, in his first year eligibility. Revis would join tight end Mike Ditka and cornerback Ty Law, who are already enshrined in Canton.\n\nWorthing High School in Houston got its second inductee this weekend when the late Cliff Branch was enshrined posthumously. Linebacker Mike Singletary was the first Worthing player to be honored in bronze in Canton.\n\nBelow is the complete state-by-state list:\n\nAlabama (9)\n\nRobert Brazile – Vigor\n\nBuck Buchanan – Parker (Birmingham)\n\nWalter Jones – Aliceville\n\nOzzie Newsome – Colbert County\n\nTerrell Owens – Russell\n\nKenny Stabler – Foley\n\nJohn Stallworth – Tuscaloosa Central\n\nBart Starr – Sidney Lanier\n\nArizona (2)\n\nCurley Culp – Yuma\n\nRandall McDaniel – Agua Fria\n\nArkansas (8)\n\nWillie Davis – Booker T.
