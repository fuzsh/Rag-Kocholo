        "text": "Ryan threw for more than 3,000 yards as a three-year starter at Penn Charter in Philadelphia, guiding a triple-option offense that didn’t specifically feature the quarterback. He also serves as a captain on the school’s basketball and baseball teams.He then chose to play at Boston College in part because of the program’s pro-style offense, following in the footsteps of one of his uncles, John Loughery, who quarterbacked the Eagles from 1979 to 1982.\n\nRyan emerged as the starter in 2005 as a redshirt sophomore, but it was his senior season that truly introduced him to a national audience. That year, he threw for 4,507 yards and 31 touchdowns as BC went 11-3 and finished No. 10 in the nation.\n\nAtlanta then identified him with the No. 3 pick in the 2008 NFL draft, and he’s since become one of the league’s most productive passers. Ryan has accumulated 55,767 passing yards and 347 touchdown passes in his first 13 pro seasons, earning four Pro Bowl selections and the 2016 NFL MVP award.\n\nHarris starred in football, basketball and baseball at Rancocas Valley High in Mount Holly, New Jersey. He became a coveted recruit as a senior and visited Michigan, Notre Dame, Syracuse, Pitt and Cornell, but he ultimately chose to play at Penn State. Despite having to share carries with another talented tailback, Lydell Mitchell, Harris rushed for 2,002 yards and 24 touchdowns in three seasons for the Nittany Lions. Harris further elevated his drafted stock at the 1972 Senior Bowl, and Pittsburgh subsequently drafted him No. 13 overall. He made his impact felt immediately by rushing for 1,055 yards and earning a Pro Bowl invitation as a rookie. That same year, he memorably scored the winning touchdown with the famed Immaculate Reception, lifting the Steelers to their first-ever playoff victory.\n\nHarris ultimately would top the 1,000-yard rushing mark eight times and receive nine Pro Bowl selections. He won four Super Bowls with Pittsburgh, earning MVP honors when the Steelers captured their first title against Minnesota in Super Bowl IX. Harris, who rushed for 12,120 career yards and scored 100 touchdowns, was inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame in 1990.\n\nKelly played quarterback, linebacker and kicker at Simon Gratz High in Philadelphia, in addition to lettering in basketball and baseball. He narrowed his focus to football in college at Morgan State, where he moved to running back and led the Bears in rushing, scoring and punting in 1962. Cleveland selected Kelly in the eighth round of the 1964 NFL draft, and he became the Browns’ starting tailback in 1966 after the retirement of Jim Brown. All Kelly did was lead the NFL in rushing touchdowns and earn first-team All-Pro status in each of the next three seasons. He recorded 7,274 rushing yards and 2,281 receiving yards while scoring 90 total touchdowns in 10 NFL seasons. He was inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame in 1994.\n\nHarrison starred as a running back and wide receiver at Roman Catholic High in Philadelphia, racking up more than 3,000 yards from scrimmage. He also played safety and helped the Cahillites with three Catholic League basketball titles. He played wide receiver at and excelled as a returner on special teams at Syracuse University, hauling in 135 receptions for 2,728 yards and scoring 21 total touchdowns in four collegiate seasons. Harrison earned first-team All-Big East honors twice and was named to Syracuse’s All-Century Team in 1999.\n\nIndianapolis drafted him in the first round in 1996, and he would ultimately team with Peyton Manning to form one of the most productive QB/WR combos in football history. Harrison registered 1,102 career receptions for 14,580 yards and 128 touchdowns, earning eight Pro Bowl selections in 13 NFL seasons. Those figures rank fifth, ninth, and fifth in NFL history, respectively. Harrison, a member of the NFL’s All-Decade Team for the 2000s, was inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame in 2016 and named to the NFL’s 100th-anniversary team in 2019.\n\nMoore played flanker and halfback with equal aplomb during his NFL career, and he slides in nicely at wideout on our Homegrown Legends roster. Moore scored 22 touchdowns as a senior at Reading High, earning a scholarship to Penn State. He would lead the Nittany Lions in rushing during all three of his varsity seasons, totaling 2,380 rushing yards and 23 touchdowns. Moore also recorded 10 interceptions on defense and excelled as a kickoff and punt returner for Penn State.\n\nThe Colts drafted him No. 9 overall in 1956, and he went on to play the entirety of his brilliant 12-year pro career with the Colts. The versatile Moore earned seven Pro Bowl invitations, was named first-team All-Pro five times and won two NFL championships. Moore racked up 5,174 rushing yards and 6,039 receiving yards, and he scored 113 total touchdowns. He was inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame in 1975 and named to the NFL’s 100th anniversary team in 2019.\n\nReed, a fearless competitor known for his ability to generate yards after the catch, completes our trio of Hall of Famers at the wideout spots. He played quarterback at Dieruff High in Allentown but was viewed as undersized at the time by major college recruiters. Reed would instead move up to nearby Kutztown University and play in a stadium that would be named for him decades later. He earned all-conference honors three times while recording 142 receptions for 2,002 yards and 14 touchdowns for the Golden Bears.\n\nBuffalo drafted Reed in the fourth round in 1985, and he played all but one of his 16 pro seasons with the Bills. He earned seven consecutive Pro Bowl selections from 1989 through 1995 and registered 951 career receptions for 13,198 yards with 87 touchdown catches. Reed, who ended his career with Washington in 2000, was inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame in 2014.\n\nTo say McGlinchey was a versatile athlete in high school would be a massive understatement. He played no fewer than 12 different positions as a senior at Penn Charter, the same school attended by his cousin, Falcons quarterback Matt Ryan. McGlinchey, who also was a prep basketball standout, earned all-state honors as a senior offensive lineman and accepted a scholarship to Notre Dame. With the Fighting Irish, he worked his way up the depth chart to become the starting right tackle as a junior and the starting left tackle as a senior. He was a team captain and earned second-team All-America status in his final college season.\n\nMcGlinchey was drafted No. 9 overall by San Francisco in 2018 and started all 16 games at right guard as a rookie. He moved to right tackle in 2019, and although he missed four games with a knee injury, he returned to play every snap from Week 9 through Super Bowl LIV. Last season, he started all 16 games for the 49ers.\n\nJones is a perfect puzzle piece for our Homegrown Legends roster, a versatile Hall of Famer who excelled at offensive guard and tackle before moving to defensive tackle late in his career. He was one of the first pro football players to use weightlifting in his training regimen, something he began doing while a student at Lemoyne High in the Harrisburg area. Jones was a standout in football, basketball and track at Lemoyne. Jones served as a pillar on the offensive and defensive lines for University of Maryland teams that went 27-3 from 1951-53, and he was a consensus All-America pick when the Terrapins won the national championship in 1953.\n\nChicago drafted him in the fifth round in 1953 as a futures selection, holding his rights as he completed his college career. Jones would play with the Bears for 12 years before spending one final pro season with Washington. He was selected to seven consecutive Pro Bowl squads from 1955 through 1961 and named first-team All-Pro three times. Jones was inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame in 1991.\n\nMunchak starred as a fullback and linebacker at Scranton High, leading the Knights in rushing, receiving, tackles and interceptions as a senior. He also competed in basketball and track. To measure his impact on his hometown and alma mater, consider that the current street address for Scranton High is 63 Mike Munchak Way – a nod to his NFL jersey number. He moved on to Penn State, where Nittany Lions coaches first envisioned him as a defensive tackle. He became a starting guard as a sophomore in 1979 but missed the following season while he recovered from a knee injury. As a senior, he rounded back into form and earned second-team All-America honors.\n\nThe Oilers drafted him No. 8 overall in 1982, and he would play his entire 12-year pro career with Houston. Munchak received nine Pro Bowl selections and was an offensive cornerstone when the Oilers made seven consecutive playoff appearances from 1987 through 1993. He played in 159 regular-season NFL games, starting 156, and also appeared in 10 career postseason games. Munchak was inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame in 2001.\n\nEvans didn’t begin playing football until he arrived at Frankford High in northeast Philadelphia. He started to get noticed by college recruiters as a junior offensive lineman, but that interest evaporated when he missed his senior season with a broken leg. He would enroll at Bloomsburg University with only a partial athletic scholarship — but a full ride for academics. Evans started at right tackle as a sophomore and left tackle as a junior and senior, developing into a Division II All-America selection.\n\nNew Orleans drafted Evans in the fourth round in 2006, and he would anchor the Saints’ offensive line for 11 seasons before finishing his career with Green Bay in 2017. Evans earned six consecutive Pro Bowl invitations from 2009 through 2014 and also receive first-team All-Pro recognition in the first four of those seasons. He missed just nine games in 12 pro seasons and won Super Bowl XLIV with the Saints in the 2009 season. Evans was named to the Bloomsburg University Athletic Hall of Fame in 2018 and the Saints Hall of Fame in June 2020.\n\nConcrete Charlie, the last of the NFL’s 60-minute men who regularly played on both sides of the ball, won’t have to play linebacker on this loaded mythical team. Bednarik played football at Liberty High in Bethlehem, Pennsylvania, before going off to fight in World War II. After serving 30 missions as an Army Air Corps gunner, he was twice named a consensus All-America pick and won the Maxwell Award as a center at the University of Pennsylvania.\n\nPhiladelphia drafted Bednarik No. 1 overall in 1949, and he would miss just three games in a 14-year career spent entirely with the Eagles. He was named to eight Pro Bowl rosters, earned first-team All-Pro recognition six times and was a key contributor to the Eagles’ 1960 NFL championship. He was inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame in 1967 and named to the NFL’s 100th anniversary team in 2019.\n\nBethea played soccer as a youth in Trenton, New Jersey, and didn’t begin playing organized football until he arrived at Trenton Central High. He played running back, offensive tackle and defensive tackle in high school and set records competing in the discus and shot put on the track team. By virtue of tenacity and talent, Bethea earned a scholarship to North Carolina A&T, where he played defensive end, linebacker and offensive tackle and guard, earning Black College All-America honors in football and track.\n\nThe Oilers selected Bethea in the third round of the 1968 draft, and he would play his entire 16-year pro career with Houston. He received one American Football League All-Star selection and seven Pro Bowl invitations. Today, the Tennessee Titans recognize Bethea as the franchise’s career leader with 105 sacks – including a team-record 17 in 1973 – even though sacks weren’t an official NFL statistic until 1982. Bethea, who played in 210 regular-season games and eight playoff contests, was inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame in 2003 and the Black College Football Hall of Fame in 2013.\n\nAlthough the Manster is best known as a legendary defensive tackle, we will slide him over to the position where he became a consensus All-America pick at the University of Maryland. White played fullback and linebacker at McKean High in Wilmington, Delaware, where the school stadium now bears his name. He initially played fullback at Maryland, but coaches eventually moved him to defensive end, where his quickness and skill allowed him to wreak havoc on opposing offenses. As a Terrapins senior, he won the Outland Trophy and Lombardi Award, was named ACC Player of the Year and received consensus All-America honors.\n\nDallas drafted White No. 2 overall in 1975, and he would miss just one game over a 14-year career spent solely with the Cowboys. He would earn nine consecutive Pro Bowl invitations, including seven first-team All-Pro selections after switching from linebacker to defensive tackle in 1977. White was named co-MVP of Super Bowl XII when the Cowboys beat Denver and earned NFC Defensive Player of the Year honors in 1978. He was inducted into both the Pro Football Hall of Fame and College Football Hall of Fame in 1994 and named to the NFL’s 100th anniversary team in 2019.\n\nKlecko took an unlikely path to football stardom. He didn’t play organized ball until his senior year at St. James High in Chester, Pennsylvania, after which he began driving trucks for a living. Klecko then played for the semipro Aston Knights of the Seaboard Football League. Playing under an alias to protect his college eligibility, he held his own against experienced opponents and received a scholarship to Temple University. Klecko emerged with five sacks and 15 tackles in a game against Delaware as a freshman, and he would go on to lead the Owls in tackles as a sophomore, junior and senior.\n\nThe Jets drafted Klecko in the sixth round in 1977, and he played 11 seasons with the franchise before finishing his pro career with the Colts in 1988. Klecko was a member of the famed New York Sack Exchange defensive front, and he earned four Pro Bowl selections and two first-team All-Pro nods with the Jets. He appeared in 155 regular-season NFL games, starting 145, and played in five career postseason contests.\n\nAt first, Maas’ parents didn’t want him to play football. They relented when he was a freshman at Marple Newtown High in Delaware County, Pennsylvania. He would develop into an all-state performer, playing tight end, linebacker and eventually defensive line. Maas’ size made him a coveted recruit, and he went on to start three years at defensive tackle for the University of Pittsburgh. He elevated his draft stock at the East-West Shrine Game and the Senior Bowl.\n\nKansas City drafted Maas No. 5 overall in 1984, and he earned Defensive Rookie of the Year honors and two Pro Bowl selections as a nose tackle. Maas also played defensive end later in his career and recorded 40 career sacks in 130 regular-season games. After nine seasons with the Chiefs, Maas concluded his career by contributing to a playoff run with the Packers in the 1993 season.\n\nDoleman earned all-state honors as a defensive end and tight end at William Penn High in York, Pennsylvania. He also averaged a double-double in basketball as a senior and even played varsity volleyball. After a postgrad year at Valley Forge Military Academy, Doleman went to play college football at the University of Pittsburgh. He would record 25 sacks in four seasons, including 12 as a freshman, and served as a team captain as a senior.\n\nMinnesota drafted Doleman fourth overall in 1985, and he would become one of the NFL’s great edge rushers over a 15-year career with the Vikings, Falcons and 49ers. He registered 150.5 career sacks, including an NFL-high 21 in 1989, and eight Pro Bowl selections. Doleman, the NFC Defensive Player of the Year in 1992, played in 232 regular-season games and 17 postseason contests – missing just two games in his entire career. Doleman was inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame in 2012.\n\nRobinson earned all-state honors while helping Moorestown High of New Jersey to back-to-back undefeated seasons and state championships – in basketball. He also was a standout in baseball and track. But his future was on the gridiron. He contributed to an unbeaten season and state football championship for the Quakers as a junior. Robinson then became one of the first Black football players at Penn State. He played the end position on both sides of the ball and developed into a first-team All-America selection.\n\nRobinson was selected No. 14 overall by Green Bay in the 1963 NFL draft and became a key contributor on Packers teams that won the first two Super Bowls. He also earned three Pro Bowl selections in 10 seasons with the Packers before finishing his career with a two-year stint in Washington, recording 27 career interceptions and 12 fumble recoveries. Robinson was inducted into the College Football Hall of Fame in 1997 and the Pro Football Hall of Fame in 2013.\n\nMillen began playing prep football as a 135-pound flanker and safety at Whitehall High in the Lehigh Valley. He beefed up to become a tight end as a sophomore and was playing fullback and defensive end at 220 pounds as a junior. Millen was coveted by major programs across the country, but he chose to play relatively close to home at Penn State. He registered 22 sacks, 36 tackles for loss and six forced fumbles in four seasons for the Nittany Lions, earning All-America honors as a defensive tackle in 1978.\n\nDrafted in the second round by the Raiders in 1980, Millen earned a Pro Bowl selection in the 1988 season and contributed to four Super Bowl championships – two with the Raiders and one each with the 49ers and Washington. He appeared in 180 regular-season games, sitting out just five times over the course of his career, and played in 16 postseason contests.\n\nAdderley is a Philadelphia native who lettered in football, basketball, baseball and track at Northeast High. He matriculated to Michigan State, where he played running back and safety. Adderley led the Spartans in rushing as a junior and earned All-Big Ten first-team recognition for his all-around excellence as a senior.\n\nGreen Bay selected Adderley No. 12 overall in the 1961 NFL draft and converted him into a cornerback, the position at which he would help the Packers win five NFL championships. He recorded 48 career interceptions and seven defensive touchdowns in nine seasons with the Packers and three years with the Cowboys. He was selected to five Pro Bowls and earned first-team All-Pro status four times. Adderley, who won two Super Bowls with Green Bay and one with Dallas, was inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame in 1980.\n\nLike Adderley, Grimes is a Philly native and former multisport star at Northeast High. Grimes was a football and basketball standout for the Vikings but was overlooked by major colleges who considered him undersized. He played college football at Shippensburg University, where he set a school record with 27 career interceptions and became a Division II All-American.\n\nGrimes signed with Atlanta as an undrafted free agent in 2006 and earned a spot on the Falcons’ roster the following year after playing a season in NFL Europa. He then impressed with 13 interceptions and a Pro Bowl selection in six seasons with Atlanta. Grimes signed with Miami as a free agent in 2013 and would earn Pro Bowl recognition in each of his three years with the Dolphins. He capped his playing days with three seasons in Tampa Bay, finishing his career with 33 interceptions and more than 500 tackles.\n\nTunnell was a running and passing threat as a prep football player at Radnor High outside Philadelphia. He would play football and basketball at the University of Toledo before serving in the Coast Guard during World War II. After the war, he played halfback at the University of Iowa for two years.\n\nNFL teams expected Tunnell to return to Iowa for the 1948 season, and he went undrafted in December 1947. He caught on with the New York Giants the following summer, becoming the first Black player in franchise history. Tunnell switched to defense with the Giants and earned nine Pro Bowl invitations and four first-team All-Pro selections in 14 seasons. He recorded 79 career interceptions (No. 2 in NFL history) and scored 10 touchdowns (five punt returns, four interception returns, one kickoff return).\n\nTunnell, who won one NFL championship with the Giants and another with the Packers, became the first Black member of the Pro Football Hall of Fame when he was inducted in 1967. He also was named to the NFL’s 100th anniversary team in 2019.\n\nHere’s a familiar face. Vincent, who played eight seasons with the Eagles, is a native of Trenton, New Jersey, who moved across the Delaware River to attend Pennsbury High in Bucks County, Pennsylvania. He lettered in football and track at Pennsbury and earned a scholarship to the University of Wisconsin. Vincent was a standout on defense and special teams for the Badgers, earning Big Ten Defensive Player of the Year honors in 1991 on his way to being drafted No. 7 overall by Miami the following spring.\n\nVincent earned five consecutive Pro Bowl selections with the Eagles from 1999 through 2003 as a cornerback and moved to safety after joining the Buffalo Bills in 2004. He recorded 47 interceptions in a 15-year NFL career with the Dolphins, Eagles, Bills and Washington. The 2002 winner of the Walter Payton Man of the Year Award, Vincent currently serves as the NFL’s executive vice president of football operations. When our team needs to shift to nickel coverage, we can look to our bench and bring in Hall of Famer and former No. 1 overall draft pick Charley Trippi.\n\nWhen you have a six-time Pro Bowl selection available, you need to find a way to get him on the field. Although LeSean McCoy is stuck behind Hall of Famers Franco Harris and Leroy Kelly on our tailback depth chart, we’re tapping him to be our secret weapon on special teams. The alum of Bishop McDevitt High in Harrisburg, who played college ball at Pitt, has gained exactly 15,000 yards from scrimmage in his first 12 pro seasons. If you prefer someone with extensive special teams experience for that role, we offer you Chichester High and Widener University alum Billy “White Shoes” Johnson, who scored eight NFL touchdowns as a returner.\n\nBrandon McManus, an alum of North Penn High and Temple University, is our place-kicker. With an 81.6% career accuracy rate on field-goal attempts, the current Denver Broncos kicker edges out Neshaminy High grads Matt Bahr and Chris Bahr.\n\nOur punter (and nickelback) is Charley Trippi, the No. 1 overall pick in the 1945 NFL draft who also played running back, quarterback and defensive back during his Hall of Fame career. He played nine seasons with the Chicago Cardinals, winning an NFL championship in 1947."
