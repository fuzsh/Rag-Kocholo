        "text": "The first thing Lawrence “Bunny” Bryan III pulled from his car was two framed photos of the late Avon Riley.\n\nThe photos: Riley as a senior football star at Savannah High School in 1977, his afro blowing in the wind; and Riley as a Houston Oilers linebacker preparing to make a tackle during a game during the 1980s.\n\nRiley, 62, died July 2 at his home in Houston, Texas. A cause of death has not been announced. Bryan, a second cousin and former teammate of Riley on the 1976 Georgia High School Association Class 3A state basketball championship team, wants both photos placed in a trophy case inside the high school. Bryan believes it is important for current and future generations to know what Riley meant to his family, his school and to the city.\n\n“It is paramount that students see this display so that they will know hard work and dedication will produce success at the highest levels,” said Bryan, founder of the LB4 and After Foundation. “Avon was a special athlete, a special man. He was all business.”\n\nThese are sentiments shared by others that knew Riley, whether from high school, during his college career in California, or during his seven years as an NFL linebacker. After his athletic exploits ended, he had a second chapter in his life in education as a 25-year employee in the Houston Independent School District.\n\nThe legacy Riley leaves behind is described with words and phrases such as hard worker, respected, tough, dedicated and big-hearted.\n\n“He was a wonderful man, an exceptional athlete, just too young to be gone,” said former UCLA teammate and 2017 Pro Football Hall of Fame inductee Kenny Easley. “We are going to miss him. Our 1980 senior class was special and he played a big part in that.”\n\n“Avon was a big man with a very big, big heart,” his younger sister Shirley B. Mackey-Crim said recently. “He was always concerned about others, always loyal to his family, to his teammates and coaches.”\n\nRiley had four brothers and five sisters, and he was one of the oldest children. His 88-year-old mother, Lucille Riley Stevens, is understandably having a hard time with the loss, according to Mackey-Crim.\n\nA lot of people are. To many, Riley was Superman.\n\n“It’s hard on mom, ” Mackey-Crim said. “It still hasn’t hit her yet. I don’t know if it has hit any of us yet.”\n\nSurvivors include Riley’s wife Kim Brown, daughter Avion Riley Frazier and son Avon Rashaun Riley.\n\n“The fullness of his life was demonstrated by his faith in God,” Mackey-Crim said.\n\nImpact player\n\nHis life including a stellar football career. A dominant player at Savannah High, Riley moved on to the College of Canyons, a junior college in Santa Clarita, California. Despite being far from home, Riley was able to focus on achieving the goals he set while playing on the football field at Hubert Middle School in Savannah.\n\n“The most disciplined athlete I ever played with,” said Riley’s high school teammate Tim Brogdon, who also played junior college and Division I football in California. “Avon was so disciplined, and as good as he was, he was very humble. He was a good man.”\n\nCharlie Smith, a former Blue Jackets head track and field coach and assistant football coach, recalled that Riley was “always about hard work and always did whatever you asked him to do.”\n\n“He was devoted to life, to school, to athletics. Avon was a very serious, focused young man,” Smith said.\n\nA young man who “was a man among boys” when he arrived as a freshman at the College of the Canyons, recalled Chuck Lyon, who was then 23 and a first-year running backs coach.\n\n“You know what I liked about Avon, he was always smiling,” said Lyon, who went on to be the program’s head football coach (1998-2006, including state and national titles in 2004) and currently is the Dean of Physical Education, Kinesiology and Athletics and the athletic director. “Watching him play taught me a lot about football.”\n\nRiley made a big impact on the junior college level, earning All-Western State Conference honors in 1977 and ’78, and second-team all-state in 1978. The linebacker was inducted into the College of Canyons Athletic Hall of Fame in 2015.\n\nHe earned a scholarship to UCLA, where he was an All-Pac-10 selection in 1980.\n\nOn to the NFL\n\nRiley became the third Savannah High Blue Jacket to play in the NFL, following former St. Louis Cardinals and Atlanta Falcons tight end Taz Anderson (1961-67) and Miami and Philadelphia running back Leroy Harris (1977-82).\n\nRiley was drafted 243rd overall by the Oilers in the ninth round of the 1981 draft, Riley played six seasons in Houston and one in Pittsburgh. Listed at 6-foot-3 and 230 pounds, he showed his durability by appearing in 16 games in four seasons and 15 in another for the Oilers. His career totals include 91 games, 61 starts and 6.5 sacks.\n\nFormer Savannah High School and Jenkins High School boys head basketball coach Larry Burke talked about Riley’s contributions to the powerhouse basketball program, which Burke coached to the Class 3A state title in 1976. As a junior, Riley came off the bench to give the Blue Jackets a lift whenever they needed it.\n\n“When Avon came into the game, we didn’t miss a beat,” said Burke, 72. “He had an important role on that team, had a great attitude about things and was always ‘yes sir, no sir’. It’s hard to find kids like that these days.”\n\nAvon Riley was rare indeed.\n\nOutside of the old Savannah High School (now Savannah Arts Academy), Bryan pulled out a copy of the program from Riley’s funeral service in Savannah at Bonaventure Cemetery on July 18. (A service also took place July 10 in Houston.) The eight-page program has a picture of Riley on the cover, smiling in a dark suit with a crisp white shirt and red tie. All business, as usual."
