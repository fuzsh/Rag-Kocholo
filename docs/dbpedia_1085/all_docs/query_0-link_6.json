        "text": "The Detroit Lions cleared more cap space Monday afternoon by releasing veteran guard Leroy Harris.\n\nThis move was expected, as Harris was due $2,062,500 against the salary cap for 2014, which would have been the final year of his deal with Detroit. Harris has $112,500 of dead money on his contract according to overthecap.com, so the move will save the Lions $1.95 million in cap room for when free agency starts March 11.\n\nHarris was brought in to compete for the right guard job eventually won by rookie Larry Warford, who then solidified the position as one of the best young guards in the league. He could have also been used as a backup center, but general manager Martin Mayhew said he planned to find one to groom for the future whenever Dominic Raiola is no longer with the club.\n\nMeanwhile, Harris played in one game in 2013, the season finale against Minnesota.\n\nIt was the fewest amount of games Harris has played in a season. He was drafted in the fourth round by Tennessee in 2007 and signed with the Lions before the 2013 season."
