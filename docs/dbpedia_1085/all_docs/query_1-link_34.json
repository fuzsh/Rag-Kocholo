        "text": "GREEN BAY – Charles Woodson must wait a bit longer to join the Green Bay Packers Hall of Fame.\n\nPackers Hall of Fame Inc. said Thursday it will postpone the induction banquet, which already was delayed once, from April to August. The specific date will be announced later.\n\nWoodson and Al Harris were elected to the hall in 2020, but that banquet was postponed because of the COVID-19 pandemic, the same reason it was postponed again. It is hoped that enough of the public will be vaccinated by August to allow large public gatherings. Individuals who purchased tickets for the banquet were notified of the change of date.\n\nWoodson is a finalist for Pro Football Hall of Fame selection this year, his first year of eligibility. Selections will be determined Saturday. Former Packers defensive Back Leroy Butler joins Woodson among the 15 finalists.\n\nWoodson and Harris will be the 163rd and 164th inductees into the hall. The two defensive backs played together in Green Bay for four years, from 2006-2009, coming to the Packers by different circumstances, but both finding a home. Harris was traded to the Packers by the Andy Reid-led Philadelphia Eagles in 2003 and Woodson signed as a free agent in 2006.\n\nHarris played seven of his 14 seasons in Green Bay, from 2003 to 2009. Fourteen of his career 21 interceptions were with the Packers, for whom he started 83 consecutive games. The other seven were with the Philadelphia Eagles, who acquired him the year after he was picked in the sixth round of the 1997 draft by the Tampa Bay Buccaneers. He played one season in Miami and one in St. Louis after his time in Green Bay.\n\nRELATED: Can you name the Packers in the Pro Football Hall of Fame? Take our quiz\n\nRELATED: Charles Woodson, Al Harris selected for Green Bay Packers Hall of Fame\n\nHarrset a Packers’ single-season record for passes defensed with 28 in 2004, and recorded 108 during this time in Green Bay.\n\nWoodson sandwiched seven years in Green Bay between stints in Oakland. He was a key member of the Packers' 2011 Super Bowl XLV championship team.\n\nWoodson, a Heisman Trophy winner as a junior at the University of Michigan, was the fourth overall pick in the 1998 NFL draft and played eight seasons with the Oakland Raiders before moving to Green Bay in 2006. Thirty-eight of his career 65 interceptions and 115 passes defensed were with the Packers. He scored 13 touchdowns, including 10 in Green Bay. He rejoined Oakland for three more seasons to finish his career.\n\nOther awards to be recognized at the banquet include:\n\nThe Bob Harlan Leadership Award to Bud Selig, former Major League Baseball commissioner, owner of the Milwaukee Brewers and Packers board member.\n\nThe Bart and Cherry Starr Recognition Award to Zeke Bratkowski, a former Packers quarterback who died in 2019.\n\nThe Media Award to Bud Lea, former Milwaukee Sentinel Packers beat reporter who died on Jan. 20. He is the first recipient of the award, which will be named for him.\n\nThe Most Memorable Moment in Packers History award, a special recognition of the creation of the Lambeau Leap by former Packers defensive back LeRoy Butler. Butler and former Packers receiver Robert Brooks will accept the award."
