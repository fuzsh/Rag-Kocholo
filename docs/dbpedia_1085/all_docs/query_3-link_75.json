        "text": "Football 6/27/2014 12:32:00 PM\n\nLeroy Vaughn - A Star Who Still Shines Bright\n\nLeroy Vaughn peered out of the large plate glass windows of the Belgium Building on the Virginia Union University campus.\n\n\"60 years, Jesus,\" he said, realizing that 2014 marks the 60th anniversary of his senior season as the VUU quarterback.\n\nHis gaze turned to Hovey Field, the exact same field on which he played from 1951 until 1954, a period where Vaughn become one of the most stellar performers in Union football history.\n\nAfter 60 years, Vaughn still ranks sixth among the all-time leaders at VUU with 18 passing touchdowns. It would be a record which would stand for 13 years, until Willie Spence passed it in 1967.\n\nThen his thoughts turned to the man who recruited him, the legendary \"Tricky Tom\" Harris.\n\n\"Tom made a good speech when he recruited me from Carver High School (in Baltimore),\" Vaughn said. \"He told me I could join the ROTC on the VUU campus. I wanted to go to a college which offered an ROTC program because I was planning on entering the service. When I arrived on campus, Tom said 'Don't worry, we're going to have it next semester.'\"\n\nVaughn was a member of the Harris' first recruiting class, and he may have been first person to learn why Harris was called \"Tricky Tom.\"\n\nAfter 63 years, Vaughn is still waiting for an ROTC chapter at VUU.\n\n\"It finally sunk in that we were not going to have ROTC,\" he said, his eyes still smiling at the thought of \"Tricky's\" speech. \"But he was always very sincere with me, and that's why I fell in love with him.\"\n\nHarris came to Virginia Union one week before the Panthers' first game in 1950. He had served as an assistant coach at Tennessee State. In a career which spanned 23 years, Harris guided VUU to 99 wins.\n\nAnother memorable moment for Vaughn came when the Panthers beat Morgan State 26-15 in Vaughn's senior year (1954). It marked the first time Morgan State had been beaten at home (in Baltimore) in seven years and the first VUU win over the Bears since 1939.\n\nVaughn, however, not only has memories of the win, but also what happened afterwards.\n\n\"I didn't come home on the bus, because I was living up there, and my mother and girlfriend were there,\" Vaughn said. \"Tom got us all in the gym the next day and said \"Good game, fellas, but we got one guy here who thinks he's above the team.' I had no idea who he was talking about. He called me 'Hoss,' and he said 'Hoss, come on down here.' He told the team that I was going to run 50 laps around the field and do some other things which were very hard to do.\"\n\nFor his efforts, Vaughn earned All-CIAA honors in 1954.\n\nAfter graduating, Vaughn put off joining the service because he was signed by the Baltimore Colts of the National Football League.\n\nIn an era when African-Americans were prohibited from playing quarterback, Vaughn became only the fourth black QB in NFL history and became the first African-American to be listed as a quarterback on an NFL team's roster since Fritz Pollard in the 1920s.\n\n\"A scout from the Pittsburgh Steelers came to practice one day,\" Vaughn said. \"He asked Tom about 'that boy playing quarterback.' Tom took two puffs from his cigar and said 'He's already taken.'\"\n\nHe joined the service and was stationed in California, and played football in the Army for College Football Hall of Fame Coach Don Coryell.\n\nAfter leaving the Army, Vaughn became a successful high school at his alma mater, Carver High School, in Baltimore.\n\nVaughn also became a father to three children, and his athleticism carried over to his only son, Mo.\n\nMo Vaughn played 12 years in the Major Leagues for the Boston Red Sox and the New York Mets. During that time he was a three-time All-Star.\n\n\"All of my children are retired now, except for my son\" Vaughn, who's now 82, said. \"He went into developing Section-8 housing, and it took off. He's now in the process of selling his part of the business and he's going to open up a trucking company in Cleveland. They'll be hauling freight.\"\n\nVaughn's story is only one of many great achievements in the history of Virginia Union athletics. Even after 60 years, his star still shines bright among those who have called Hovey Field home. Thanks to Vaughn for setting the standards for Virginia Union athletics very high. We truly salute you and thanks for sharing your story with us."
