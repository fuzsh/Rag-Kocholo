He was born September 6, 1930, the son of Mr. Leroy Harris Dart, Sr. and Louisiana Clayton Dart in San Luis Obispo, California.\n\nRoy’s personality and interests were innate. He achieved Eagle Scout and this accomplishment prefaced a life of leadership, teaching and a love of wildlife, hiking and fly fishing. While attending San Luis Obispo High School, he was accepted to The American Legion California Boys State. In his senior year of 1947 he was editor of the yearbook, president of the senior class and valedictorian. He was a modest, kind and private individual who knew as a young boy he would become a doctor.\n\nRoy attended the University of California, Berkeley graduating in 1951, Phi Eta Sigma honor society, Phi Beta Kappa and Order of the Golden Bear. In 1954 he graduated from the University of California Medical School, San Francisco, medical societies of Alpha Omega Alpha and Nu Sigma Nu.\n\nRoy began his medical career in the United States Army as a pathologist.

In 1964 he joined the United States Air Force, completing his neurosurgical residency at the Mayo Clinic in 1968.

As he did.\n\nRoy married Mary Elizabeth Smith on June 26, 1954 in Ross, Marin County California. He is survived by his wife, Mary Elizabeth, his children Stephen H. Dart and Elizabeth A. Burton, his three granddaughters the Misses Sophia and Katherine Dart and Miss Harris Jessica Burton, his brother Clayton Stuart Dart and sister Louisiana Dart Knox.\n\nA memorial service to be held in San Luis Obispo, California in the fall of 2021.\n\nMemorials or donations may be made to the Seattle Humane Society or The Nature Conservancy."
