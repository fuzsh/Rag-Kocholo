Forbes and Time Magazine agree, naming the pop princess their 2023 Person of the Year. With the accolade comes one of Swift's most in-depth interviews to date, in which she gives insight into her romance with Kansas City Chiefs tight end Travis Kelce, whom she began dating long before attending her first Chiefs game at Arrowhead Stadium. The takeaway for football fans and Taylor Swift fans is that Swift and Kelce appear to be more than a fleeting romance. Fans should expect to see Swift in the stands at Arrowhead (and on the road) for the foreseeable future. Clearly, the biggest story of the 2023 NFL season wasn't Aaron Rodgers' move to New York or Brock Purdy's dominance, but Swift herself --the NFL Person of the Year is clearly Swift herself.\n\nIs this the Cowboys year? If you are a Dallas Cowboys fan, every year is \"the\" year (the one where the team goes all the way to the Super Bowl), but this year the 9-3 Cowboys actually have a shot. At the end of the 2022 season, quarterback Dak Prescott promised to throw less turnovers (he led the league with 15). As of today's writing, Dak managed his interceptions to just six. With superstars like Brandin Cooks and Micah Parsons on the field, the Cowboys have never looked better. They're one game behind the Philadelphia Eagles for the top spot in the NFC East with the toughest part of their season ahead. The Cowboys seemed unlikely to knock the 10-2 Eagles off their perch, but a win this weekend changes everything.\n\nGood morning, Baltimore. Many hours of NFL sports broadcasts over recent years has been dedicated to arguing the talents (or lack thereof) of Baltimore Ravens quarterback Lamar Jackson. Lamar has always been a dynamic scrambler out of the pocket and this season is no different with Jackson scoring 574 rushing yards, the top for QBs in the NFL. Over halfway through the 2023 NFL, Lamar is poised to have the best season of his career. The Ravens are 9-3 coming into Week 14 and MVP chants follow Lamar (again) at every turn. The Ravens might not get the hype of the Chiefs or Eagles, but they're establishing themselves a Super Bowl contender and Lamar is already make a case to turn those chants into reality.\n\nRelated content on CBS Essentials"
