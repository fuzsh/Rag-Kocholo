        "text": "When the expectations ramped up in the playoffs last season, West’s football team didn’t exactly rise to the occasion. After beating Alta by 26 points in region play, in the 5A second round playoff rematch West lost in quadruple overtime.\n\nIt was a brutal end to the season after a perfect 6-0 region season, especially watching two other Region 6 teams advance to the semis.\n\nExpectations are just as high for West High heading into the 2024 season as it was projected to finish first by the rest of the Region 6 coaches.\n\n“I think they all know the expectation right now. We’re going into the fifth year of this growth process and there are some expectations to do well and I think they understand that,” said West coach Olosaa Solovi. “You can take it as pressure or you can embrace it, and we’re hoping they’re embracing that pressure and embracing the process and really getting them focused on us and us being disciplined and taking each rep in practice to try and get better.”\n\nIn reflecting on that playoff loss, Solovi said his team didn’t execute the critical details when it needed.\n\nAlta, meanwhile, won its ensuing quarterfinal game to advance to the 5A semifinals despite finishing region play with a 3-3 record. Their postseason success in many ways epitomized the competitiveness within Region 6 last season, something many believe will unfold again.\n\nWest went 6-0 a year ago in Region 6 but narrowly beat Brighton and Olympus, who finished tied for second with 4-2 records. Alta and East tied for fourth with 3-3 records and were competitive in nearly every game with teams at the top of the region.\n\n“Our region is very talented and will produce some great matchups. The natural rivalries promote familiarity and excitement each week. We hope to be near the top when the playoffs arrive,” said Olympus coach Brandon Burt, whose team also advanced to the 5A semifinals a year ago.\n\nWest and Olympus are the teams with the most returning experience, so it’s no surprise the coaches in the region pegged them as No. 1 and No. 2 in region.\n\nWest returns seven offensive starters and six defensively. Solovi said he feels great about his offense heading into the season, and defensively believes if the newcomers in the box rise to the occasion, his team can be really good.\n\nWest will get tested early. It travels to Colquitt County, Georgia, for its season opener on Aug. 16. The Packers went 12-1 last season and will again be one of the top teams in Georgia. In Week 2, West faces Clovis East, California, and then American Fork in Week 3.\n\nSolovi believes that difficult schedule will prepare his team for the Region 6 grind at the top.\n\nOlympus returns six offensive starters and seven defensive starters from a team that went 8-4 last year, and narrowly lost to eventual state champ Timpview in the semifinals 22-20.\n\n“Overall, we are excited about this group. We have team speed, toughness, some decent size and the willingness to prepare. We play in a great region full of talented rivals and are looking forward to the season,” said Burt.\n\nWest and Olympus will both have new starting QBs in 2024, as will projected No. 3 team Brighton. Whichever team finds the most stability at that key position by the time region play rolls around could be the team that ultimately claims the region title.\n\nEast will be looking for a bounce-back season after a a disappointing 5-6 record a year ago.\n\nAlta was projected to finish fifth as new coach Blake Burdette inherits a young team after the departure of Alema Te’o as head coach.\n\n“We are excited to start a new era of Alta Football. We won’t have the numbers that the team has had in the past, but are excited about the boys that we have. The team has been working hard to accomplish all the goals that have been set out,” said Burdette.\n\nHighland and Skyline are projected to finish at the bottom of Region 6.\n\nKautai Olevao is heading into his fourth season as head coach, and he’s hoping that with half his starters back from a year ago his team can find a way to be more competitive in 2024.\n\nSkyline is coming off a 0-10 season, but new coach Marcus Mailei is hoping he can point the program in the right direction, but he knows it won’t be easy.\n\n“We’re in the toughest region in state. Olympus has great coaches, Brighton has both great athletes and coaches. West has a great leader and is building an awesome culture. Highland has been competitive for the last two seasons, and East High always brings that smash mouth football,” said Mailei.\n\nRegion 6 projections\n\n(Preseason rankings are based on coaches’ votes)\n\n1.
