        "text": "GREEN BAY â€“ When Charles Woodson looked across the field during his playing days in Green Bay, he saw Al Harris lining up at the other cornerback position. And when he looked across the room Thursday at Lambeau Field, Harris was still there, ready to join Woodson in the Green Bay Packers Hall of Fame.\n\n\"To go in with him, I think it's the only way it could be,\" Woodson said.\n\nThe 50th Green Bay Packers Hall of Fame Inc. induction banquet, first planned for April 2020, but delayed and rescheduled multiple times because of the coronavirus pandemic, finally made Woodson and Harris the hall's 163rd and 164th members. Woodson was recently inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame, the 27th Packers player with that honor.\n\n\"My whole time here, I couldn't tell you any bad memories, honestly,\" Harris said. \"I enjoyed my time here, whether it was 70 degrees or below zero. I tell my wife all the time, 'I could live in Green Bay.' She says, 'Oh my goodness, it's so cold.'\"\n\nHarris got to Green Bay in 2003, three years ahead of Woodson. Harris was drafted by Tampa Bay in the sixth round of the 1997 draft, but the Bucs barely gave him a look. His longtime agent and friend, Jack Bechta, who introduced him Thursday at the banquet, encouraged the Philadelphia Eagles to sign Harris, which they quickly did after a brief tryout.\n\n\"I go, 'Hey, look, take a chance on him. He's got fire burning in him. Shame on Tampa, they didn't recognize it. You won't be disappointed,'\" Bechta said.\n\nHarris played five season for the Eagles, but found himself third on the cornerback depth chart. He approached Eagles coach Andy Reid, a former Packers coach, about wanting to go somewhere else because he was blocked from advancing.\n\n\"I was stuck behind two guys, athletically and financially, which we know, it's business that counts,\" Harris said.\n\nMore: The Packers will play the New Orleans Saints Sept. 12 in Jacksonville. Here's how to get tickets.\n\nMore: The internet tells us a bunch of things that Packers fans probably didn't know about themselves\n\nMore: The Packers plan a free Titletown District watch party for the season opener against the Saints\n\nReid understood and sent Harris to Green Bay, where coach Mike Sherman and the staff told him to \"go out and do what you do. They showed that they trusted me.\"\n\nHarris played seven of his 14 seasons in Green Bay, from 2003 to 2009. Fourteen of his career 21 interceptions were with the Packers, for whom he started 83 consecutive games. He set a Packers single-season record for passes defensed with 28 in 2004, and recorded 108 during his time in Green Bay.\n\nIn addition to the five years with the Eagles, he played one season in Miami and one in St. Louis after his time in Green Bay.\n\nHarris injured his knee before he was released by the Packers in 2010, while he was trying to rehab the injury. Harris said he is always goal-oriented and was determined to play again, which he did for Miami and St. Louis before the knee injury ended his playing career.\n\n\"I tell the guys I coach now ... as long as you can see the vision, it's there for the taking,\" Harris said.\n\nWoodson, who won the Heisman Trophy and a national championship at the University of Michigan before playing eight years for the Oakland Raiders, was a reluctant arrival in Green Bay. But Harris and other players quickly set him at ease.\n\n\"The first thing (coach) Lionel Washington told me was 'Al ain't going to let you outwork him.' I knew before I even talked to Al, I had another guy on the opposite side of me who was going to work just as hard or harder than I was going to work. I think we both tried to elevate each other's game. I believe that's the reason we are both here,\" Woodson said.\n\nWoodson said the young players would be irritated because he and Harris would take all the snaps in practices.\n\nWoodson, over his 18-year career, had 65 interceptions, 38 of them while playing 100 games for the Packers. He played 254 games during his career, which included 11 years with the Oakland Raiders. He was a member of the Packers' team that won Super Bowl XLV in 2011. He is tied for fourth, with LeRoy Butler, on the Packers' all-time interceptions list.\n\nHe did not think about halls of fame when he was a player, Woodson said.\n\n\"That was never my goal. My goal was always championships. If you're good enough to do that, all the other stuff will come with it,\" he said .\"For me, to hold up the Lombardi Trophy, I was good with that.\"\n\nIn their post playing careers, Woodson has many business interests, including his own wines.\n\n\"His itinerary of things he has going on is unreal,\" said Bryan Engel, Packers head athletic trainer, who introduced Woodson on Thursday. \"It's astounding he can continue to run the same way he did when he was playing. He's setting such a good example for his boys.\"\n\nHarris is a defensive backs coach for the Dallas Cowboys under former Packers head coach Mike McCarthy.\n\n\"Pound for pound, the toughest two players I've ever come across in the National Football League,\" Engel said.\n\nAt the Packers banquet, Bud Selig received the Bob Harlan Leadership Award and the late Zeke Bratkowski got the Bart and Cherry Starr Recognition Award. The first recipient of a new media award was the late Bud Lea, for whom the award will be named.\n\nButler and Robert Brooks accepted the Most Memorable Moment in Packers History recognition on behalf of the iconic Lambeau Leap.\n\nButler created the Lambeau Leap after scoring a touchdown against the Los Angeles Raiders on Dec. 26, 1993, when Reggie White recovered a fumble and before getting tackled out of bounds tossed the ball to Butler. Butler jumped into the arms of fans after the touchdown, but it was Brooks who later was the first to get all the way into the stands after a touchdown."
