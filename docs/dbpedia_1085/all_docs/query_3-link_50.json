        "text": "Tim Walz was in the midst of his interview with Vice President Kamala Harris’ vetting team when he told them there was something important they needed to know.\n\nHe doesn’t use a teleprompter, the Minnesota governor said. He doesn’t even have one, in fact. So if he was the pick, Walz said, Harris’ team would have to get him a teleprompter and teach him how to use it.\n\nIt was a lighter moment, but it was also part of an interview process with Harris’ team that Walz aced, multiple sources familiar with the meeting told CNN. The Minnesota governor was upfront about his vulnerabilities, noting he wasn’t from a swing state or a household name. He also said he was a bad debater.\n\nBut Walz made it clear he would be a team player.\n\nAsked how he saw his role as VP, Walz said he would perform the job however Harris wanted him to. Asked if he wanted to be the last person in the room before Harris made a decision, Walz said only if she wanted him to be there.\n\nAnd asked if he had ambitions to run for president himself one day, Walz said he did not, a point that sources said was not lost on a team looking to minimize the potential for any internal drama in a future Harris administration.\n\n“He had a very clear understanding that it was to be a partner, but to support the president, go out and connect with America and be that governing partner,” said Cedric Richmond, a former Louisiana congressman and Biden White House adviser who was deeply involved in the selection process. “It’s not the easiest of positions, but it’s a very important position.”\n\nThe vetting interview was a key step for Walz to ultimately lock up the selection that Harris made after sitting down with the three finalists, including Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro and Arizona Sen. Mark Kelly, for one-on-one interviews at her residence on Sunday.\n\n“It was a home run,” said one source familiar with Walz’s meeting with Harris’ vetting team. “Everyone loved him.”\n\nBeyond the personal chemistry Harris and her team felt toward Walz, people familiar with the interview process said that Walz was also someone Harris felt could attract the kinds of voters that Democrats have lost to Donald Trump— voters that Harris may not be able to connect with on her own.\n\n“He hunts, he fishes, you want to have a beer with him,” said the source familiar with Walz’s meeting. “He will play in Michigan, Wisconsin, Western Pennsylvania, Georgia, North Carolina.”\n\nA longtime Democratic operative who has known Walz for years agreed, saying: “He talks and looks like a lot of the voters we’ve lost to Trump.”\n\nBy Tuesday, staffers at the Harris campaign headquarters were already joking about the “Blue Walz,” referencing the key midwestern battleground states that they hope he will help her lock up.\n\nShapiro – who was favored by some of the Democratic Party and anti-Trump Republicans as a more moderate selection – did not go over as well with Harris’ team during his vetting interview, sources familiar with the process told CNN. While Walz came across as deferential and cooperative, Shapiro struck some as overly ambitious, with “a lot of questions” about what the role of the VP would be.\n\nAnd while Shapiro did “very well” in his in-person meeting with Harris on Sunday, multiple sources said, Walz was seen as a pick that would come with less drama and palace intrigue – both on the campaign trail and, if they win in November, at the White House.\n\n“It was a striking contrast” between the two, said the source familiar with the meeting.\n\nWalz was an unexpected contender to become the No. 2 on the Democratic ticket – he was hardly mentioned among the potential contenders when Joe Biden dropped out a little over two weeks ago. But sources familiar with the selection process described Walz as the walk-on player who was ultimately picked for the team over the five-star recruits because he was a Midwestern governor who can campaign as a natural on the stump as a fellow “happy warrior.”\n\nWalz, who was a 24-year Army National Guard veteran and high school teacher before entering politics, brought a “joy and excitement” to the process that ultimately won Harris and her team over, said another source.\n\nWalz was the running mate option that Harris knew the least — but he won over the Democratic nominee, as well as her team, by making clear he would adapt to her style and policies.\n\nHarris had not been expecting Walz to say he didn’t plan to run for president, a source familiar with her thinking told CNN. But afterward, as she sat around the same dining room table in the Naval Observatory, Walz’s answer stuck with her.\n\n“That showed his willingness to say, ‘Look I’m not concerned about my image or my approval rating or what’s next for me in the next chapter of life. I’m going to stay in this moment, be your vice president, run through walls, fight for the American people and demonstrate our values,’” said Richmond. “That’s a strong and compelling argument.”\n\n‘At ease and very natural’\n\nThe elevation of Walz was the culmination of a remarkable whirlwind, a capstone to a two-week campaign to join the Democratic ticket – first, with a goal of catching the attention of the Harris team and second, to win over the vice president herself.\n\n“He was at ease and very natural,” said a senior Democratic adviser who was briefed on Walz’s face-to-face interview with Harris. “It was a ‘know-it-when-you-see-it’ type of thing.”\n\nWhile much of the attention around the vetting process focused on the work being done by former Attorney General Eric Holder and former White House counsel Dana Remus, the questions beyond the paperwork and biographical scrubs really started last Friday with video interviews for the candidates being considered.\n\nThe Zoom calls also featured an until-now secret three-person committee: Richmond, former Boston mayor and Labor Secretary Marty Walsh and Nevada Sen. Catherine Cortez Masto.\n\nRichmond has become a top adviser to Harris. Walsh and Harris grew close during his time in the Biden administration. Cortez Masto was elected the same year to the Senate with Harris, but they’d also previously served as attorneys general together through the landmark multistate mortgage settlement that became a defining moment for both their careers in the aftermath of the 2008 financial crisis.\n\nThe three-person group was picked for geographic diversity, different skill sets and background. But most of all, they were picked because they were who Harris trusted to help figure out whom she could trust, which many who know her acknowledge is often the hardest thing for Harris.\n\nRichmond and Walsh, who both went from being elected officials to members of Biden’s administration, were there to help answer a question very much on Harris’s mind after her own experience as vice president: “She wanted to make sure that we could ask questions like, ‘You’re going to go from a principal to a hybrid principal/staffer. Can you make that transition?’” according to one source familiar with the process.\n\nOf the nine options vetted, and six who met virtually with the committee, Walz and Shapiro entered the rushed final weekend as the clear favorites, three people involved in the process told CNN. Kelly was included as a third option."
