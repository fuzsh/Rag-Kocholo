        "text": "During his 25 years being a part of the Jaguars as a player, team ambassador or radio analyst, Tony Boselli has seen his share of franchise highs and lows.\n\nAfter 10 years of mostly disappointment on the field, Boselli is hoping the start of a new decade translates into better results, beginning with his election Saturday as the first Jaguar into the Pro Football Hall of Fame.\n\nRELATED | See more Jacksonville Jaguars coverage\n\n“Hopefully, this will kick off the decade of the 2020s the right way for the Jaguars’ organization,” Boselli said. “That’d make me very happy.”\n\nAlong with LeRoy Butler, a Jacksonville native and former Green Bay Packers safety, Boselli is looking to be among five of 15 finalists who will get a knock on their hotel door around 2 to 3 p.m. from Hall of Fame president David Baker to inform them of their selection into that exclusive club.\n\nWhile Butler is a first-time finalist, this is the fourth consecutive year that Boselli has reached this stage. The five-time All-Pro offensive tackle has made the voters’ initial cut from 15 to 10 finalists, but missed out when the list was pared to the final five.\n\nOne major factor that has kept Boselli -- considered to be the best tackle of his generation -- from gaining Hall entry is he played in only 91 regular-season games. But many believe career longevity is becoming less of an obstacle than it might have been a decade ago.\n\n“It’s not an easy club to get into,” Boselli said. “Every year, there’s 15 guys who did great things in the game of football. It’s tough.”\n\nThe odds of Boselli getting into Canton could slightly improve this year because he’s one of only three offensive linemen on the ballot for modern-era candidates, along with guards Alan Faneca and Steve Hutchinson. There have been a combined 13 O-line finalists in the last three years, but only center Kevin Mawae (2019) got elected, compared to six of 12 linemen finalists being chosen from 2012-16.\n\nBoselli will wait out the vote with his wife, Angie, their five children and his parents at the Loewe’s hotel in South Beach, along with the other finalists.\n\n“All I’m thinking about is getting in,” said Boselli. “We don’t try to think about the other. I have no control over it. We just believe the best and that it’s going to happen.”\n\nDespite a crowded field with four safeties -- Troy Polamalu, San Francisco 49ers’ GM John Lynch and Steve Atwater are also finalists -- Butler likes his chances to make the Hall after finally breaking through as a finalist.\n\n“I don’t see that as an obstacle. I expect to make it, no question,” said Butler. “I’m enjoying this journey. They’re going to hear some facts about me that’s different from the other safeties. I think that could be the difference in me getting in.”\n\nIt’s been an uphill climb for Butler to reach this point. Since becoming HOF-eligible in 2007, it took the Lee High product a decade just to be among the 25 semifinalists. Until this year, he was the only member of the NFL’s 1990 All-Decade first team to not be a finalist.\n\n“Being the only All-Decade guy to not make the finals, I’m like, ‘Come on, guys,’ “ said Butler. “The voters weren’t paying much attention to the safety position for a long time.”\n\nHowever, that trend has changed recently as Cliff Harris’ election as part of the Hall of Fame’s Centennial Class of 2020 marks the fourth straight year a safety will be enshrined, including Raines High product Brian Dawkins in 2018.\n\nButler, a four-time All-Pro safety, played his entire 12-year career in Green Bay. He became the first NFL player to reach 20 interceptions and 20 sacks, which includes pulling down New England Patriots quarterback Drew Bledsoe with one arm in the Packers’ 35-21 Super Bowl XXXI victory.\n\n“If they look at covering tight ends, running backs and a third receiver on third down, I should sleep well Friday night,” said Butler. “Most of these [safety finalists] are big hitters. The safety position is exactly what the word means, you’re the last line of defense. I prevented a lot of touchdowns.\n\n“The safety is supposed to get interceptions, but what else can you do besides that? I think that makes my case amazing.”\n\nButler is trying to become the third member of the Packers’ 1996 Super Bowl champion, along with quarterback Brett Favre and pass-rusher Reggie White, to reach Canton. He’s also credited with the creation of the Lambeau Leap, where Green Bay players jump into the stands with fans to celebrate touchdowns.\n\n“This is a leap year, so maybe that’s an omen,” said Butler.\n\ngfrenette@jacksonville.com: (904) 359-4540"
