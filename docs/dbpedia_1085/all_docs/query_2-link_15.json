        "text": "The NFL celebrates its rich history with HBCUs.\n\nThe contribution of Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs) to the NFL has changed the game forever.\n\nThe elite brotherhood of HBCU players has had a tremendous impact on football and in the communities in which they have played, exemplifying excellence on and off the field.\n\nWhether it’s celebrating personal or team successes or positively impacting communities across the country, the influence of players from HBCUs is woven into the fabric of the NFL.\n\nHonoring HBCU Players\n\nThe all-time leader in career receptions, receiving yards and most career touchdowns (Jerry Rice, Mississippi Valley State). The player with the most sacks in a single season (Michael Strahan, Texas Southern). The only man to ever win both a Super Bowl ring and an Olympic gold medal (Bob Hayes, Florida A&M). And the namesake for the NFL’s most prestigious honor (Walter Payton, Jackson State).\n\nThese are just a few of the accomplishments made by HBCU players in the NFL — all players that are enshrined forever in the Pro Football Hall of Fame.\n\nCheck out HBCU athletes, coaches, and notable figures who have graced the covers of Sports Illustrated.\n\nHBCU players represent only a small portion of the total football population, yet nearly 10% of all players in the Pro Football Hall of Fame attended HBCUs (35 out of 371 members). Super Bowl rings, Pro Bowls and all-time records are attributed to these athletes; and their performance on and off the field set the standard for generations to come.\n\nBLACK COLLEGE FOOTBALL HALL OF FAME\n\nIn 2016, the Pro Football Hall of Fame and the Black College Football Hall of Fame (BCFHOF) partnered on a permanent home for the BCFHOF — the Hall of Fame Village in Canton, Ohio, which celebrates the legacy of HBCUs on the game. The partnership also includes a traveling exhibit and established an HBCU postgraduate internship.\n\nThe BCFHOF was founded in 2009 by Black pioneers and NFL quarterbacks James Harris and Doug Williams. The institution preserves the history and honors the greatest players, coaches and contributors from HBCUs. There have been 90 inductees since its creation.\n\nDoug Williams, former Grambling State University quarterback, was the first Black starting quarterback to win a Super Bowl.\n\nEXCELLENCE IN THE COMMUNITY\n\nNo honor represents the exemplary character of athletes more than the league’s most prestigious and coveted recognition — the Walter Payton NFL Man of the Year Award.\n\nNamed after the legendary Chicago Bears running back and Jackson State University alumnus, the annual award is given to the player who best represents the NFL’s commitment to philanthropy and community impact.\n\nLearn more about the Walter Payton NFL Man of the Year Award."
