        "text": "ALLEN PARK, Mich. (AP) — The Detroit Lions have cut guard Leroy Harris and signed defensive tackle Corey Irvin.\n\nHarris played in only one game last season, the last one of the regular season against Minnesota. He was signed last year by the Lions to compete to start at right guard, a job that was won by rookie Larry Warford. Harris previously started 42 of 76 games for the Tennessee Titans.\n\nIrvin played in six games as a reserve last season in Dallas. He has played in 24 career games, all as a backup, for the Cowboys, Tampa Bay, Jacksonville and Carolina. The Panthers selected him in the third round of the 2009 NFL draft out of Georgia.\n\nThe moves were announced Tuesday.\n\n(© Copyright 2014 The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved.
