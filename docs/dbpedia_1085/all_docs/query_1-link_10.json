        "text": "Every day we’ll take a look at one of the Detroit Lions heading for free agency, what he has meant to the team before and a prognosis on whether or not he’ll be back with the club in 2014.\n\nTo view the entire series to date, click this link.\n\nFree agent to be: Leroy Harris\n\nPosition: Offensive guard\n\nAge: 29\n\nYears in the league: 7\n\nWhat he made last season: $937,500 (cap number); $1,050,000 (cash value); $800,000 (base salary); $225,000 (signing bonus); $25,000 (roster bonus).\n\nWhat he did last season: Harris played in one game last season -- the season finale -- and was otherwise inactive for the majority of the season. He was brought in to be a reserve guard and possibly push -- or win -- the starting right guard spot that eventually went to rookie Larry Warford. The third-round pick from Kentucky played every snap last season and Dylan Gandy was his backup, so Harris really didn’t have a role on game day with the Lions.\n\nHis potential market value: Some team might have interest in him as a free agent past the first tier of players. He spent the first six years of his career with Tennessee and was a starter for the Titans in 2010 and 2011. So there could be some value there for him when he heads to free agency, but he won’t be someone who will be signed immediately.\n\nWill he fit the Lions still: Not much. The team barely used him last season and released him earlier this month. Detroit feels confident with what it has as its starting guards -- Warford and Rob Sims -- and also have a reserve guard in Rodney Austin that they want to give a shot to. They might look into bringing in a cheap veteran as well, but it won’t be Harris."
