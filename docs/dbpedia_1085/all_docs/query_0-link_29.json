        "text": "Listing includes NFL drafts from 1936-2019 (which followed the 1935-2018 collegiate seasons). From 1960-1966, both the NFL and AFL had drafts and this listing includes both drafts because the AFL later merged with the NFL. (F) indicates “future selection,” based on an old NFL rule prior to 1967 in which a player could be chosen if his class had graduated, even if he hadn’t completed his eligibility (he could be drafted after his fourth year and his rights would remain with the team which selected him even if he didn’t sign for a year). The AFL held a separate “redshirt” (or futures) draft in 1965-1966 and it is also included in this listing.\n\nFirst round draft picks are listed in CAPITAL LETTERS. The “overall draft selection” figures were not available for the 1960 AFL draft or the 1965 and 1966 AFL Redshirt drafts, however players are listed in correct order of selection in those years (also, no round-by-round records were available for the 1960 AFL draft). The positions listed are those projected by the pros at the time of selection.\n\nList compiled with the assistance of Beau Riffenburgh, NFL Properties."
