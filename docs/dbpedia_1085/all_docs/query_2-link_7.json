        "text": "While an official update on center Joe Hawley's status is not yet available, there isn't much encouraging news bouncing around regarding Hawley's injury. First of all, Adam Caplan played harbinger of doom with this report.\n\nThen Ian Rapoport reported that the Falcons will consider veteran center/guard Leroy Harris to fill in the blanks on their depleted offensive line.\n\nHarris was selected by the Tennessee Titans in the fourth round of the 2007 NFL Draft. He remained with the Titans through the 2012 season, then landed in Detroit in 2013, where he was a backup. The Titans reportedly considered re-signing Harris following the 2013 season, but he remains a free agent at present. Harris played pretty well in 2011, and in 2012 landed on injured reserve. He didn't get much opportunity in 2013 in Detroit as the Lions' line remained healthy throughout the season.\n\nPeter Konz isn't the most appealing choice as the starting center, but he knows the offense, which matters a great deal. If the team opts to sign Harris I would expect him to serve as a backup. Harris is versatile, with experience at center and guard, which makes him an appealing option, if healthy and in game shape, as depth that the Falcons probably sorely need after Sunday's injury-fest.\n\nWhat do you think about Harris? Share your thoughts in the comments."
