        "text": "Jim Dawson played men’s basketball for three seasons at the college under head coach Alex Ober ’63. He graduated in 1982 with a bachelor’s degree in Physical Education.\n\nAn All-Middle Atlantic Conference Southern Division selection in 1982, he still holds the program records for career assists (392) and steals (311). In 72 games, he averaged 5.4 assists and 4.3 steals per game while averaging 10.2 points and 1.8 rebounds.\n\nDawson set the single-season school record with 189 assists as a senior (an average of 8.2 per game) while also setting the record for steals with 134 (an average of 5.8 per game). That year, he also averaged 12.2 points, shot 54% from the floor and 73.2% from the free-throw line with 104 made free throws, the ninth-most in a single season in program history.\n\nDawson also set the college’s single-game record with 15 assists and nine steals as a senior. A player has totaled 10 or more assists in a game only eight times in program history, and Dawson is responsible for three of them. In addition, he holds three of the top four records for steals in a single season.\n\nDuring Dawson’s career, the Green Terror won more than 62% of its games while posting a mark of 16-6 at home and 23-13 in conference.\n\nThe winningest head coach in the history of the swimming and women’s lacrosse programs, Kim Easterday has left her mark at McDaniel College as a coach, administrator, lecturer, and parent.\n\nEasterday spent 32 seasons as the head swimming coach, amassing 288 total wins, including 145 with the men and 143 with the women. She also mentored eight All-Americans and 36 individual conference champions (17 men, 19 women).\n\nIn 24 seasons as the head women’s lacrosse coach, Easterday won over 60% of her games, leading the team to 161 wins and a Middle Atlantic Conference championship with the program’s first appearance in the NCAA Division III Women’s Lacrosse Championship in 1987. The Green Terror also had seven All-America and 33 all-conference selections during her tenure.\n\nEasterday stepped down as the women’s lacrosse coach following the 1999 season but remained as the swimming coach through the 2009-10 season. Following her head coaching career, she remained on the Hill as a lecturer in Kinesiology and director of athletics operations before retiring in 2019 after 43 years of service to McDaniel College.\n\nA graduate of Denison University, Easterday is married to Steve Easterday ’72, who coached men’s soccer and men’s golf at the college. Their three children all attended McDaniel: Matthew Easterday ’04, Mary Easterday Oravets ’04, and Catherine Easterday ’09. Matt and Mary both swam at McDaniel, and Matt is following in his mother’s footsteps as the head swimming coach at King’s College in Pennsylvania.\n\nDan Patterson was a three-time Centennial Conference champion for the wrestling team. He graduated with a bachelor’s degree in Exercise Science and Physical Education in 2005.\n\nA four-time All-Centennial Conference selection, Patterson won the 133-pound championship in 2002, 2003, and 2005, and finished as runner-up in 2004. He is one of eight wrestlers in program history and one of 23 in Centennial Conference history that have won three conference championships.\n\nPatterson was named to the Centennial Conference Silver Anniversary Team and qualified for the 2003 NCAA Division III Wrestling Championships. He ranks seventh in program history with 37 falls, 10th with 79 wins, and 10th with a .797 winning percentage.\n\nPatterson was also a member of McDaniel’s Centennial Conference championship team in 2002.\n\nStephanie McPherson Powell was a two-sport athlete, playing both women’s basketball and women’s outdoor track and field. She graduated in 2003 with a bachelor’s degree in Biology with minors in Music and Spanish.\n\nMcPherson was a five-time Centennial Conference medalist in outdoor track and field, three-time conference champion in the 4x100-meter relay, and NCAA championship qualifier in the 4x100- and 4x200-meter relays.\n\nMcPherson is a part of three program records and two Centennial Conference records that have stood for over 20 years. Along with Thea Bayly Blackburn ’02, Jamie Falcone ’01, and Aleya Horn Kennedy ’01, she is part of a 23-year-old college and conference record in the 4x100-meter relay with a mark of 47.57 seconds set at Frostburg in 2000. The four also hold the meet record in the event with a time of 48.28 seconds at the Centennial Conference Outdoor Track & Field Championships on May 7, 2000, at Swarthmore.\n\nIn 2001, McPherson, Falcone, Melissa Merson ’03, and April Brown Johnson ’04 set the program record in the 4x200-meter relay with a time of 1:42.78 at the prestigious Penn Relays. McPherson, Falcone, Blackburn, and Merson also set the program record in the 4x400-meter relay at the Penn Relays in 2001 with a time of 3:58.22.\n\nIndividually, McPherson ranks fourth in program history in the 200 meters (26.01 seconds), sixth in the 100 meters (12.64 seconds), and eighth in program history in the long jump (5.10 meters).\n\nOn the basketball court, McPherson was a member of McDaniel’s 2002 Centennial Conference championship team and holds the program record for single season games played (29) and single season steals per game by a first-year player (2.4).\n\nMcPherson is married to Teron Powell ’02, who was a three-sport standout in football, men’s basketball, and men’s outdoor track and field at McDaniel and inducted into the Athletics Hall of Fame in 2013."
