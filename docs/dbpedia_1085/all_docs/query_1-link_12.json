        "text": "PHILADELPHIA -- Fullback Leroy Harris has been released by the Philadelphia Eagles, but team officials say the decision had nothing to do with Harris' testimony this month that he used cocaine.\n\nHead coach Marion Campbell, announcing the Eagles' decision to allow Harris to become a free agent, said Wednesday it was 'strictly a football decision.'\n\n'I met with Leroy this morning and told him that he is not what I'm looking for at the fullback position and that, based on past performance, I didn't think he would make our football team this year,' said Campbell, who became coach when Dick Vermeil resigned at the end of last season.\n\n'This is a continuation of our policy of not bringing a player to training camp and then having to release him if he didn't fit into our plans in the first place,' Campbell said.\n\nHarris, 29, engaged in a bitter support battle with his estranged wife, testified March 3 at a support hearing in Camden, N.J., that he was a 'junkie.'\n\nA bench warrant had been issued for his arrest in January because he had failed to maintain support payments of $500 a week. However, Jim Solano, Harris' agent, has denied his client used drugs.\n\nHarris played sparingly with the Eagles last season, rushing the ball only 17 times for 39 yards and scoring two touchdowns.\n\nCampbell earlier released linebacker John Bunting, running back Louie Giammona and wide receiver-punt returner Wally Henry.\n\nThe action allows all four players to be claimed by another team or make their own deal as a free agent. Bunting has signed to play with the Philadelphia Stars of the United States Football League.\n\nHarris was obtained by the Eagles from the Miami Dolphins in 1979 and started at fullback in 13 games that season and 15 in 1980. In those contests, he gained 834 yards and scored five touchdowns. He missed all of the 1981 season with a broken arm.\n\nCampbell said he tried unsuccessfully to trade Harris at last week's NFL meetings."
