        "text": "JONESBORO, Ark. (11/13/14) – In honor of its 100th season fielding a football team, the Arkansas State Athletics Department announced Thursday its All-Centennial Football Team comprised of 100 total lettermen who have significantly impacted the football program and left a lasting legacy at A-State.\n\nThe Arkansas State football program's inaugural season was 1911, but the school didn't field a team during the 1918 and 1942-44 years. The 100 players named to the All-Centennial Team are among the many all-time lettermen who have had a powerful contribution to A-State's outstanding football history and heritage, which includes 88 All-America and 271 all-conference players.\n\nThe All-Centennial Team members will be recognized at A-State's home game against Appalachian State (Sat., Nov. 15) during halftime, when the team's 28 starters (12 offense/12 defense/4 special teams) will also be announced.\n\nSeventy-four all-conference performers, 50 NFL players, 46 All-Americans, 30 A-State Hall of Honor members and 11 conference player of the year choices make up the All-Centennial Team. Additionally, 27 players who hold at least one Arkansas State game, season or career record made the list, along with 22 players from the all-time A-State team chosen by fans during the 1976 campaign.\n\nWhile there are certainly far more than 100 A-State lettermen deserving of this type of recognition, the team was assembled with the utmost care and scrutiny by a distinguished selection panel made up of current and former A-State Athletics administrators, media, lettermen, Hall of Honor members and alumni close to the program.\n\n“This prestigious team was developed not only as a form of individual recognition, but also to honor all the teammates who have taken the field alongside the All-Centennial Team selections,” said A-State Director of Athletics Terry Mohajir, who was a part of the 11-person selection committee. “We have 100 All-Centennial Team members, but 100 years' worth of lettermen who everyone associated with A-State is proud to call ours!”\n\nIn addition to the 100 players, the team also includes “All-Centennial Coach” Larry Lacewell, who led the program from 1979-89 and still holds the school record for most victories. Under Lacewell's direction, Arkansas State made four consecutive trips to the NCAA I-AA playoffs from 1984-87, including an appearance in the 1986 championship game.\n\nThe All-Centennial Football Team also includes seven honorary members, including five A-State Hall of Honor members who were both players and coaches at the school. Those five members include David Mitchell, Tim Keane, Leslie Speck, Bill Templeton and Bill Davidson.\n\nA-State head certified trainer Ron Carroll, who is also a Hall of Honor member and has been working the football team's sideline for 453 consecutive games, was named an honorary member to the team as well. He is joined by former athletics director and Ring of Honor member Ike Tomlinson, who served as head football coach in 1945.\n\nThe Arkansas State football team's Saturday game against Appalachian State is scheduled to kickoff at 2 p.m. at Centennial Bank Stadium.\n\nTickets may be purchased by contacting the A-State Ticket Office at 870-972-2781 or by visiting tickets.astate.edu online.\n\nARKANSAS STATE ALL-CENTENNIAL FOOTBALL TEAM:\n\nJonathan Adams (RB, 1998-2001)\n\nRyan Aplin (QB, 2009-12)\n\nJosh Arauco (K, 2006-09)\n\nReggie Arnold (RB, 2006-09)\n\nFred Barnett (WR, 1986-89)\n\nRandy Barnhill (OL, 1984-86)\n\nBill Bergey (LB, 1965-68)\n\nEverett Bolton (ATH, 1939-40, 1946-47)\n\nGene Bradley (QB, 1976-79)\n\nJon Bradley (DL, 2000-03)\n\nDwane Brown (QB, 1984-87)\n\nRay Brown (TE, 1983-85)\n\nDan Buckley (OL, 1966-69)\n\nJohnie Burnett (ATH, 1927-29)\n\nBill Caldwell (QB, 1957-59)\n\nJeff Caldwell (K, 1993-96)\n\nRyan Carrethers (DL, 2010-13)\n\nAlex Carrington (DL, 2006-09)\n\nMaurice Carthon (FB, 1979-82)\n\nMichael Cline (DL, 1983-85)\n\nHoward Cissell (DB, 1954-57)\n\nGary Crane (DE, 1967-68)\n\nCarter Ray Crawford (DL, 1984-85)\n\nBrian Davis (K, 2010-13)\n\nDemario Davis (LB, 2008-11)\n\nTommy Davis (OL, 1958-59)\n\nDick Dixon (DL, 1972-75)\n\nDoug Dobbs (K, 1976-79)\n\nWayne Dorton (OL, 1968-71)\n\nCarlos Emmons (LB, 1992-95)\n\nFrank Farella (OL, 1954-57)\n\nRick Fishback (DB, 1981-82)\n\nDwayne Frampton (WR, 2010-11)\n\nCharlie Fredrick (NG, 1984-87)\n\nBruce Gartman (P, 1980-82)\n\nTerry Gwin (RB, 1965-66)\n\nJames Hamilton (QB, 1968-71)\n\nFoy Hammons (1913-15; 1919)\n\nCalvin Harrell (RB, 1968-71)\n\nLeroy Harris (FB, 1975-76)\n\nDavid Hines (QB, 1972-75)\n\nJoe Holliman (DB, 1971-74)\n\nTJ Humphreys (OL, 1973-76)\n\nRickey Jemison (FB, 1983-86)\n\nDavid Johnson (TE, 2005-08)\n\nLennie Johnson (WR, 1995-98)\n\nGarry Johnson (OL, 1999-2002)\n\nTyrell Johnson (DB, 2004-07)\n\nBrandon Joiner (DE, 2010-11)\n\nKen Jones (OL, 1972-75)\n\nGerald Jumper (WR, 1964-67)\n\nRobert Kilow (WR, 1998-2000)\n\nJohn Koldus (WR,1950-52)\n\nTim Langford (QB, 1980-83)\n\nHarry Larche (LINEMAN, 1946-48)\n\nGreg Lee (DB, 1984-87)\n\nQushaun Lee (LB, 2011-current)\n\nCleo Lemon (QB, 1997-2000)\n\nCorey Leonard (QB, 2006-09)\n\nJimmy Lisko (DE, 1972-75)\n\nDoug Lowery (OL, 1970-73)\n\nMike Malham Jr (LB, 1972-75)\n\nMatt Mandich (OL, 2005-08)\n\nJD McKissic (WR, 2012-current)\n\nDennis Meyer (DB, 1968-71)\n\nMike Morris (LB, 1979-82)\n\nDan Mullen (DE, 1972-75)\n\nJerry Muckensturm (LB, 1972-75)\n\nMarvin Neloms (DL, 1983-86)\n\nOkey Oldham (ATH, 1927-29)\n\nRoy Painter (DB, 1973-76)\n\nBill Phillips (OL, 1968-71)\n\nMike Ray (OL, 1987-89)\n\nTom Reese (RB, 1962-65)\n\nKyle Richardson (P, 1992-95)\n\nDon Riggs (RB, 1955-58)\n\nDick Ritchey (DB, 1964-67)\n\nScott Roper (K, 1986-87)\n\nJoe Slayton (P, 1976-79)\n\nElbert Shelley (DB, 1983-86)\n\nJames Simmons (DB, 1970-72)\n\nJerome Sims (DB, 1982-85)\n\nDanny Smith (RB, 2000-02)\n\nRobert Speer (DE, 1973-76)\n\nTommy Spiers (QB, 1954-56)\n\nRon Smith (LB, 1976-79)\n\nTaylor Stockemer (WR, 2009-12)\n\nDan Summers (OL, 1962-65)\n\nClovis Swinney (DL, 1967-69)\n\nRon Teat (TE, 1996-99)\n\n(Billy) Joe Turner (OL, 1960-62)\n\nTommy Walker (OL, 1980-83)\n\nAntonio Warren (RB, 2002-05)\n\nTerry Whiting (DB, 1968-71)\n\nSammy Weir (QB, 1960-62)\n\nClarence Williams (DE, 1995-98)\n\nCorey Williams (DL, 2000-03)\n\nH.T.
