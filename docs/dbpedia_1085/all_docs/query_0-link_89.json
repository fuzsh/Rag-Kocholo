        "text": "Editor’s note: This is the fifth story in a five-part series on the all-time high school football teams in the state of Florida.\n\nFloridians love their high school football. Almost as much as they love telling people that their high school football is the best in the nation. (Players from Florida have swag? Well, hell, so do the fans.)\n\nHigh school coaches in Florida don’t get paid like they do in Georgia or Texas. They aren’t provided with free cars or trucks like they are in some states. But the talent with which they get to work more than makes up for what they don’t get in worldly goods.\n\nThe Athletic completes its five-part series looking at past greats with the unveiling of its All-time All-Florida high school team. Not surprisingly, it’s a juggernaut.\n\nConsider:\n\n• Of the 22 position players, 15 already are in the Pro Football Hall of Fame and at least two more should get there. (And two others already should be in, which makes 19 of 22.) And we’re not even counting the reigning NFL MVP in that group. Heck, there are two Hall of Fame linebackers, the NFL’s No. 3 career rusher and three of the top 20 in career receptions on the bench.\n\n• The NFL’s all-time leading rusher is on the team.\n\n• The NFL’s leader in career solo tackles is on the team.\n\n• The No. 5 guy in NFL history in interceptions is on the team (incredibly, he is not one of the Hall-of-Famers, though he should be).\n\n• The leading return man in NFL history is on the team.\n\n• Arguably the most-feared pass rusher in NFL history — a guy whose patented pass-rush move was banned by the league for being too violent — is on the team.\n\nOK, that’s enough of us Floridians hyping this group. Just read on and see. (We already have looked at Miami-Dade, Broward/Palm Beach, Central Florida and the greater Tampa area.)\n\n(And we don’t want to hear from any Californians or Texans about how their all-time high school team would be better. Because those folks are wrong.)\n\nOFFENSE\n\nQB Lamar Jackson\n\nHigh school: Boynton Beach\n\nThe particulars: Jackson was a three-star recruit who has far exceeded his recruiting ranking. He won the 2016 Heisman as a sophomore at Louisville after accounting for 5,114 yards of offense and 51 TDs. He was a first-round pick by Baltimore in 2018, then became the starting quarterback for the Ravens in November and helped the Ravens to the playoffs. In 2019, Jackson became one of the hottest commodities in the NFL, leading the Ravens to the division title and winning league MVP honors. Jackson threw for 3,127 yards and 36 TDs and set the NFL record for rushing yards by a quarterback with 1,206; he also scored seven rushing TDs. All that in his second season in the league.\n\nRB Emmitt Smith\n\nHigh school: Pensacola Escambia\n\nThe particulars: A standout at all three levels — he was a mega-recruit out of high school, a college All-American at Florida and is the NFL’s all-time leading rusher. At Florida, he finished his three-year career with 3,928 yards (now second in school history) and 36 rushing TDs (also second). He holds the school record with 23 100-yard games, a figure that is even more significant because the Gators’ offense at the time (1987-89) can best be described as “Emmitt left, Emmitt up the middle, Emmitt right.” He was a first-round pick of Dallas in 1990 and played 15 NFL seasons (13 with the Cowboys, two with Arizona). He had 11 1,000-yard seasons, four times led the league in rushing and was a four-time All-Pro. Smith finished with 18,355 rushing yards and also is No. 1 in NFL history with 164 rushing touchdowns. He was inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame in 2010. In 2009, Smith was named to the Florida High School Athletic Association’s All-Century team, a list of the top 33 players in the then-100-year history of high school football in Florida.\n\nRB Edgerrin James\n\nHigh school: Immokalee\n\nThe particulars: James was considered an elite talent out of high school, but shaky academics kept some schools away. He signed with Miami and was a backup as a true freshman in 1996 before starting as a sophomore and junior, then turning pro; he is the only player in UM history with back-to-back 1,000-yard seasons. James rushed for 2,960 yards and 32 TDs in his Hurricanes career, figures that rank third and second, respectively, in school history. Indianapolis took him fourth overall in the 1997 draft and he started for seven seasons with the Colts; he also played for Arizona and Seattle. He was the 1999 offensive rookie of the year (and an All-Pro) after leading the league with 1,553 yards; he also led the league in 2000 with 1,709 yards. James, who was a member of the NFL’s all-decade team for the 2000s, finished his career with 3,028 carries for 12,246 yards and 80 TDs. He is 13th in NFL history in rushing yards, 20th in rushing TDs and ninth in attempts. James also had 433 receptions, and his 3,461 career touches are ninth-most in NFL history. He will be inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame this summer.\n\nWR Isaac Bruce\n\nHigh school: Fort Lauderdale Dillard\n\nThe particulars: He was one of the top receivers in Broward County as a prep senior in 1989, then went to junior college before landing at Memphis. A second-round pick of the L.A. Rams in 1994, Bruce became a big part of the franchise’s high-powered offense. Bruce played 16 seasons with the Rams and 49ers, winning the Super Bowl with St. Louis in 2000 and making four Pro Bowl appearances. He finished his career with 1,024 catches for 15,208 yards and 91 touchdowns, figures that rank 13th, fifth and 12th, respectively, in league history. He will be inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame this summer.\n\nWR Bob Hayes\n\nHigh school: Jacksonville Gilbert\n\nThe particulars: The stats aren’t all that glitzy, but his speed — he won the 100 meters in the 1964 Olympics, and he eventually became the first man to run the 100 in under 10 seconds — helped change the game. He was a running back in high school in the pre-integration days, then signed with Florida A&M to run track and play running back. He was a “future” pick by Dallas in the seventh round in the 1964 draft, then joined the team in 1965 as a wide receiver and made an immediate impact. He led the league with 12 TD receptions as a rookie, then again in ’66 with 13. He played 11 seasons and five times had double-digit TD totals. He had more than 50 catches just twice and finished his career with 371 but for 7,414 yards (an otherworldly 20.0 per catch) and 71 TDs (a Cowboys record). Hayes was a two-time All-Pro and was inducted into the Hall of Fame in 2009. “He changed the game because of his speed,” Don Shula said. “… He made you change everything on your defense when you played the Cowboys.” When it was announced he had made the Hall of Fame, the news release from the Hall said Hayes “terrorized defensive backs and demanded deep double coverage rarely seen in the NFL at that time. Often said that bump-and-run defense was developed to slow him down.”\n\nWR Michael Irvin\n\nHigh school: Fort Lauderdale St. Thomas Aquinas\n\nThe particulars: Known as “The Playmaker,” Irvin first played high school ball at Sunrise Piper before transferring to Aquinas. He signed with Miami in 1984 and became a two-time All-American; he is UM’s career leader with 26 TD receptions and is fourth in receptions (143) and third in receiving yards (2,423). After leaving Miami following the 1987 national championship, Irvin was taken with the 11th overall pick by Dallas in 1988, where he would be reunited with Jimmy Johnson the following year. Irvin helped the Cowboys to three Super Bowl titles, was an All-Pro in 1991 (when he led the league with 1,523 receiving yards) and made the Pro Bowl five times. Inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame in 2007, Irvin finished with 960 receptions, 11,904 receiving yards and 65 touchdowns. He was a member of the FHSAA’s All-Century team in 2009.\n\nT Lomas Brown\n\nHigh school: Miami Springs\n\nThe particulars: He was a stud recruit out of high school and started for three seasons at left tackle for Florida, becoming the best offensive lineman in school history in the process. He was an All-American in 1984 as a senior, when he won the Jacobs Trophy as the best lineman in the SEC. He was a big-time athlete — he had a 34-inch vertical jump as a 6-5, 280-pound senior — and a first-round pick in the 1985 draft (sixth overall by Detroit). Brown was a 17-year starter in the NFL for four different teams. He was an All-Pro in 1990 with the Lions and was a seven-time Pro Bowl selection. He started 251 games in his career, 11th-most in NFL history. He was a member of the FHSAA’s All-Century team in 2009.\n\nT Bruce Armstrong\n\nHigh school: Miami Central\n\nThe particulars: Armstrong was a tight end in his first two seasons at Louisville before he was moved to tackle by new coach Howard Schnellenberger in 1985; he started at tackle in his final two seasons on campus. New England drafted him 23rd overall in 1987 and Armstrong would spend all 14 of his pro seasons as a starter with the Patriots. In all, he started 212 games (54th in NFL history) and made six Pro Bowl appearances. He is one of only three players in league history to play with the same team in three different decades and is one of just seven players in Patriots history to have his number retired.\n\nG Steve Hutchinson\n\nHigh school: Coral Springs\n\nThe particulars: Hutchinson was an elite recruit who signed with Michigan as a defensive lineman; after redshirting as a true freshman and moving to guard, he was a four-time first-team All-Big Ten pick and a two-time All-American. He was a first-round pick (17th overall) by Seattle in 2001 and became one of the best guards in NFL history during his 12-year career; Hutchinson was a six-time All-Pro selection and went to the Pro Bowl seven times. He was named to the NFL All-Decade team for the 2000s. Hutchinson (who also played for Minnesota and Tennessee) will be inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame this summer. He was a member of the FHSAA’s All-Century team in 2009.\n\nG Larry Little\n\nHigh school: Miami Booker T. Washington\n\nThe particulars: Little played both ways on the line in high school, then played strictly defensive line at Bethune-Cookman. He signed with San Diego in 1967 as an undrafted free agent and the Chargers moved him to guard; he was traded to Miami after the 1968 season and became one of the best guards in league history. Little was the driving force behind the Dolphins’ great running attack of the early 1970s. A five-time All-Pro selection, Little was an 11-season starter for the Dolphins and was inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame in 1993. He was a member of the FHSAA’s All-Century team in 2009.\n\nC Maurkice Pouncey\n\nHigh school: Lakeland\n\nThe particulars: Pouncey and his twin, Mike, were big-time recruits and part of a seven-player contingent from Lakeland High that signed with Florida in the 2007 recruiting cycle. He started at guard as a freshman (he was the first true freshman to start a season-opener at guard in UF history), then moved to center for his final two years on campus. Pouncey won the Rimington Award as the nation’s best center in 2009, when he was a consensus All-American. He left school after his junior season and was a first-round pick in the 2010 draft by Pittsburgh. He has started every game he was healthy (121 of them) since being drafted. Pouncey is a two-time All-Pro and has made the Pro Bowl eight times in nine seasons (he missed in 2013, when he played in just one game because of an injury). He appears to be bound for the Hall of Fame.\n\nDEFENSE\n\nE Deacon Jones\n\nHigh school: Eatonville Hungerford\n\nThe particulars: The best defensive end in NFL history? You can make a case for Jones, who played high school ball in the pre-integration days; he made the FHSAA All-Century team in 2009 despite his high school not being a part of the FHSAA when he played. Jones played one season at South Carolina State and one season at Mississippi Vocational College — now called Mississippi Valley State (yep, the same alma mater as Jerry Rice) — before being selected in the 14th round of the 1961 draft by the Los Angeles Rams. He became a star on what was one of the most talented defensive lines in NFL history, the “Fearsome Foursome.” Jones played 14 years in the NFL and was a five-time All-Pro and an eight-time Pro Bowler. Sacks were not an official stat when he played, but Pro Football Weekly credits him with 173.5 of them, which would be third all time. He had a lethal helmet slap, a move that eventually was banned. He was elected to the Pro Football Hall of Fame in his first year of eligibility in 1980 and was named to the NFL’s 75th Anniversary All-Time Team in 1994.\n\nE Jack Youngblood\n\nHigh school: Monticello Jefferson County\n\nThe particulars: He was a star linebacker in high school, helping Jefferson County to a state title as a senior in 1966. He started his Florida career at offensive tackle and was moved to defensive tackle the spring before his sophomore season. He then was moved to end to start the season and became one of the best players in school history. Youngblood was an All-American as a senior in 1970, and though he played only one season in the decade, he was named to the SEC’s All-Decade Team for the 1970s. He was a first-round pick by the Los Angeles Rams in the 1971 draft. He was a part-time starter as a rookie (spending most of the season backing up Deacon Jones), split time with Fred Dryer in 1972, then started the next 12 seasons for the Rams. Youngblood was a five-time All-Pro who played in a franchise-record 201 consecutive games; he missed only one game in 14 seasons, that one miss coming in his final year in 1984. Sacks were an official stat for just three of his 14 seasons, but he unofficially had 151.5, which would rank in the top 10 in league history. Youngblood was inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame in 2001. He was a member of the FHSAA’s All-Century team in 2009.\n\nT Vince Wilfork\n\nHigh school: Lantana Santaluces\n\nThe particulars: A prep All-American and a state discus and shot-put champ in high school, Wilfork became one of the most dominating defensive lineman in NFL history after a successful career at Miami. He was a full-time starter for just one season at UM but had 14 sacks, 35.5 tackles for loss and 43 quarterback hurries in his career. He left UM after his junior season and New England made him the 21st overall pick in the 2004 draft. A two-time Super Bowl champion, Wilfork made it to the Pro Bowl five times and was selected to the 2012 All-Pro team. Wilfork spent his first 11 seasons with the Patriots before finishing his career with the Houston Texans; in all, he was a starter for 12 of his 13 pro seasons. He started 22 playoff games in his career, ninth-most in NFL history, and will be a Hall of Fame candidate in the future.\n\nT Warren Sapp\n\nHigh school: Apopka\n\nThe particulars: Sapp was a two-way standout at Apopka, starring at tight end and linebacker. He was converted to defensive tackle at Miami and became a superstar. Sapp played three seasons at UM and was a two-time All-American; he won the Lombardi and Nagurski awards as a junior in 1994 (he had 84 tackles, 10.5 sacks, four forced fumbles and three fumble recoveries that season), then turned pro. He was a first-round pick by Tampa Bay in the 1995 draft and played 13 NFL seasons. He was a four-time All-Pro selection for the Bucs and a seven-time Pro Bowler who finished his career with 96.5 sacks; he had four seasons with at least 10 sacks. Sapp was inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame in 2013. He was named to the FHSAA’s All-Century team in 2009.\n\nLB Derrick Brooks\n\nHigh school: Pensacola Washington\n\nThe particulars: Like the other Pensacola native on this list, Emmitt Smith, Brooks hit the trifecta — mega-recruit, college All-American and NFL superstar. Brooks starred at safety in high school and was one of the nation’s most heavily recruited prospects when he signed with FSU in 1991. He was recruited to be a linebacker and put his speed to good use with the Seminoles. Brooks was a three-time first-team All-ACC selection and was a consensus All-American as a junior and senior; he was the ACC Player of the Year as a senior in 1994. Tampa Bay took him in the first round in 1995, and he was a starter for the Bucs for his entire 14-season career. Brooks became a vital cog on some of the NFL’s best defenses with the Bucs and was a five-time All-Pro and an 11-time Pro Bowler. He finished his career with 1,713 tackles, 25 interceptions (including six pick-sixes) and 24 forced fumbles. His tackles total is sixth in NFL history and he is third with 1,300 solo tackles. Brooks was inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame in 2014. He was a member of the FHSAA’s All-Century team in 2009.\n\nLB Ted Hendricks\n\nHigh school: Hialeah\n\nThe particulars: He starred in football, basketball, baseball and track in high school, then attended hometown Miami. He was a three-time All-American defensive end for the Hurricanes and finished fifth in the Heisman voting as a senior in 1968. He was a second-round pick of Baltimore in the 1969 draft and was moved to outside linebacker, where “The Mad Stork” thrived. He was a four-time All-Pro selection — once with Baltimore, once with Green Bay and twice with Oakland. Hendrick won four Super Bowl rings (three with the Raiders, one with the Colts) and finished with 26 career interceptions. He didn’t miss a game in his NFL career, playing in 215 consecutive contests; his last game was Super Bowl XVIII, when the Raiders routed the Redskins in Tampa. He was inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame in 1990 and was a member of the FHSAA’s All-Century team in 2009.\n\nLB Ray Lewis\n\nHigh school: Lakeland Kathleen\n\nThe particulars: He was his high school team’s MVP as a junior and senior, playing linebacker, running back … and kick returner. He also was a standout wrestler. Still, he was not necessarily a touted recruit and his signing with Miami wasn’t considered a big deal. Well, he then got on the field at UM and everything changed. He played three years for the Hurricanes and made 393 career tackles; he was a freshman All-America selection in 1993, then earned “regular” All-American honors as a sophomore and junior. He turned pro after his junior season and was a first-round pick by Baltimore in 1996. He played 17 seasons with the Ravens and was a seven-time All-Pro and a 13-time Pro Bowler. Lewis, who is No. 1 in NFL history with 1,568 solo tackles, was inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame in 2018. He was named to the FHSAA’s All-Century team in 2009.\n\nCB Deion Sanders\n\nHigh school: North Fort Myers\n\nThe particulars: Is he the best corner in football history? Well, “Prime Time” (or “Neon Deion,” if you prefer) certainly is the most famous. He was a star in football, baseball and basketball in high school and developed into a national recruit. He signed with FSU and played three sports there, too: football, baseball and track. Sanders was a four-year starter at cornerback (his 14 picks are second in FSU history) and was a unanimous All-American as a junior and senior. He also was an All-American sprinter and a starting outfielder on a team that went to the College World Series. He was a first-round pick by Atlanta in the 1989 NFL Draft, then spent the next 12 seasons as a starter with the Falcons, 49ers, Cowboys and Redskins. (After a three-season retirement, he was a part-time starter with Baltimore in 2004 and ’05 before retiring for good.) He also was a dangerous kick and punt returner, with nine career return TDs. Sanders was a six-time All-Pro who had 53 career interceptions for 1,331 yards and nine TDs; the yardage total is fourth in NFL history and the TDs are fifth. He was inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame in 2011. Sanders also was a member of the FHSAA’s All-Century team in 2009.\n\nCB Ken Riley\n\nHigh school: Bartow Union Academy\n\nThe particulars: Riley starred at Union Academy (which had nine players make it to the NFL in its history) in pre-integration days. He played both ways in high school, then became a star quarterback at Florida A&M. Riley was drafted as a cornerback in the sixth round by Cincinnati in 1969; he became a full-time starter in 1970 and kept that role for 13 more seasons. He was an All-Pro once, in 1983, as a 36-year-old in his final NFL season. Riley spent his entire career in Cincinnati, started 201 games and had 65 career interceptions, tied for fifth-most in NFL history with Charles Woodson. He and fellow Floridian Lemar Parrish (from Riviera Beach Kennedy, also a pre-integration high school) were one of the NFL’s best cornerback duos in the 1970s. Riley later was the coach and then the AD at FAMU. He was a member of the FHSAA’s All-Century team in 2009, and there are more than a few folks who think he should be in the Pro Football Hall of Fame.\n\nS LeRoy Butler\n\nHigh school: Jacksonville Lee\n\nThe particulars: Because of a bone problem in his feet, Butler spent several years as a child in braces, casts and a wheelchair. But he was fine by the seventh grade and developed into an elite recruit at Lee High. He signed with FSU and was a reserve as a true freshman in 1986. He then started for the next three seasons, the first two at safety and his senior season at cornerback, replacing Sanders. In his final two seasons with the Seminoles, Butler had 194 tackles, nine interceptions and a huge run on a “puntrooskie” against Clemson; he was a first-team All-American as a senior in ’89 and a second-round pick by Green Bay in 1990. He was a backup as a rookie, a starter at corner in ’91, then a 10-year starter at safety for the Packers. He was a four-time All-Pro and a member of the NFL’s All-Decade team for the 1990s. Butler also is credited with originating the “Lambeau Leap.” He was a member of the FHSAA’s All-Century team in 2009 and remains a viable candidate for the Pro Football Hall of Fame.\n\nS Brian Dawkins\n\nHigh school: Jacksonville Raines\n\nThe particulars: Dawkins was a lineman as a youth league standout in Jacksonville but was a star in the secondary at Raines and became a three-year starter at safety for Clemson; he earned some All-America notice as a senior in 1995, when he had six interceptions. He was a second-round pick of Philadelphia in the ’96 draft, then became a 16-year starter in the NFL — the first 13 with the Eagles and the last three with Denver.
