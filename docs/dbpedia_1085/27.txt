The Detroit Lions worked out free agent interior offensive lineman Leroy Harris, formerly of the Tennessee Titans, on Wednesday. Harris is still recovering from ACL surgery, but he's close to 100 percent, according to The Tennessean's Jim Wyatt.

Harris was a fourth-round pick out of North Carolina State in 2007, and the Titans have used him as both a guard and center. He played in every game but two from the 2008 season through 2011 and started the first eight games of the 2012 season before suffering a season-ending ACL tear.

The Lions used their third-round selection in the 2013 draft on Kentucky guard Larry Warford, and signing Harris would provide some depth at the position, especially when he's finally fully healthy. The Lions need to help opening holes for recently-signed running back Reggie Bush and hope to boost their 23rd-ranked rushing attack from 2012 and Harris, if signed, could pair with Warford to get the job done.
