The Titans plan to move Leroy Harris from left to right guard in 2012.

Newly acquired Steve Hutchinson will be the left guard, where he’s played his entire career. Harris, 28 in June, is coming off knee and shoulder scopes, but should be 100 percent by training camp. Harris took a step forward last season, but struggled as a run blocker. He’ll need to iron that out in order to be an effective right guard, where effective run blocking is required.

Titans LG Leroy Harris is recovering from knee and shoulder scopes.

According to coach Mike Munchak, Harris will be “fine.” It’s possible Harris won’t be ready for OTAs, but he should be 100 percent before camp. After a disappointing 2010, Harris started all 16 games for the Titans last season. He graded out as the league’s sixth-best guard in Pro Football Focus’ rankings.

Coach Mike Munchak suggested the Titans will not use their first-round pick on an offensive lineman this year.

They’re purely looking for interior prospects after LG Leroy Harris, free agent RG Jake Scott, and C Eugene Amano comprised the least effective trio in the NFL last season. Scott won’t be back in 2012, and the Titans may look to upgrade at the other two spots. Wisconsin C Peter Konz, Stanford OG David DeCastro, and Georgia G/T Cordy Glenn are the top interior prospects.

Titans RG Leroy Harris (knee, shoulder surgeries) has been cleared for contact.

Harris re-joined teammates for Tuesday’s practice. Expected to move from left to right guard this season, Harris should have a lock on the starting job after the Titans failed to bring in veteran competition. He remains a weakness in the running game.

Titans RG Leroy Harris revealed Monday that he has a partially torn ACL.

The Tennessee medical team is hoping Harris’ ACL will heal with rest and rehab, and that he’ll be able to return later in the season. If the healing doesn’t go smoothly, he may require a knee reconstruction. Kevin Matthews got the right guard nod in Week 9 against the Bears and will continue to start.

Titans will place RG Leroy Harris (knee) on injured reserve, ending his season.

Harris will undergo surgery to repair a partially torn ACL after getting a second opinion on Tuesday. A free agent in 2013, Harris has an uncertain future in Nashville. His pass-blocking left a lot to be desired in the first half of the season. Kevin Matthews is expected to take over as the starter.

Seeking more than the veteran minimum, free agent OG Jake Scott has turned down several offers from teams throughout the offseason and training camp.

“I’m not angry,” said Scott. “This is my decision. It is a business and it is my decision not to be on a team right now.” Scott started 121 consecutive games through 2011 and graded out as a top-10 guard by Pro Football Focus last season. Titans RG Leroy Harris, his replacement, was yanked late in the opener in favor of Kevin Matthews.

Titans coach Mike Munchak believes RG Leroy Harris should be able to play at some point this season.

While the team initially feared the worst, the injury doesn’t sound like it will be season ending. Kevin Matthews will get the start at RG for the Titans while Harris is sidelined.

After a Monday MRI, the Titans do not believe RG Leroy Harris’ knee injury is season ending.

Coach Mike Munchak declined to provide a firm timeline. Harris “felt like his knee gave out” on the first-quarter injury against the Colts, and he did not return. OL coach Bruce Matthews’ son, Kevin, will start in the interim.
