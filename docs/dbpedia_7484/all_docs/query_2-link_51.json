        "text": "Kenny Wollesen will perform at MASS MoCA in North Adams, MA on Saturday April 26 at 4PM. Wollesen is a percussionist, bandleader, and all around wild man who wears many hats: besides being one of the most sought after jazz drummers in the world, he also fronts a frenetic, semi-spontaneous marching band that turns up at parades and other events in New York City, gathering members as it goes and leaving hilarity in its wake.\n\nWollesen wraps up a weeklong residency with a performance that combines his core group with local musicians in an ecstatic communal jamboree. Check www.massmoca.com for a schedule of Kenny Wollesenâ€™s vacation week community events.\n\nMASS MoCA schedule and ticket info:"
