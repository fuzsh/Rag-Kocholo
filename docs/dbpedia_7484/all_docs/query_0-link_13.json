        "text": "Unexpected relief floods through the generous spaces of “And It Happens Every Day,” the first single from saxophonist Ilhan Ersahin, guitarist Dave Harrington (who blew my mind with this reimagining), and drummer Kenny Wollesen’s new album, Invite Your Eye. Harrington’s quiet, inquisitive guitar progressions pull back the curtain on a world finding bright spots of color on an otherwise grayscale palette. Ersahin is at his contemplative best, choreographing sinuous sonic circles with his tenor, filling in the empty spaces Harrington leaves behind. Textures fade into gentle, inviting rhythms, and Wollesen’s recognizable cadence becomes the glue.\n\n“And It Happens Every Day” cascades across the parched landscape like a fresh lease on life. Guitar chords flicker with effervescence, imbued by the pensive light of pedal steel, and a Wollesen’s featherlight touch. Ersahin’s emotive runs are the sound of clouds dissipating during the golden hour, a mesmerizing vision spilled across an expansive aural canvas. Ersahin, Harrington, and Wollesen come together and press forward into the next dimension.\n\nInvite Your Eye is out on March 4, 2022, via Ersahin’s Nublu label. Pre-order it HERE."
