This is an excellent group which explores new-age folk through an exotica lens.\n\nJesse Harris - guitar\n\nWill Graefe - guitar\n\nKenny Wollesen - marimba\n\nJeremy Gustin - drums\n\nJames Buckley - bass\n\nCOSMO is the instrumental project of composer Jesse Harris (guitar), featuring Will Graefe (guitar), Jeremy Gustin (drums), Kenny Wollesen (marimba) and James Buckley(bass). Combining song-like structures with improvisation, they explore the meeting point of rock, exotica and new-age folk. The new album, Spring Song, was released in '23 and produced by Shahzad Ismaily. Cosmo began originally in 2010 when John Zorn invited Harris to record an album for his label, Tzadik, focusing on his instrumental writing, and was reinvigorated during a 2017 residency at the old Stone on Avenue C.\n\nOriginally from New York City, JESSE HARRIS began making records in the mid-1990s and has released more than 20 albums under his own name and with his instrumental group, Cosmo, as well as countless others with various projects and artists. In 2003, he won the Grammy Award for Song of the Year for \"Don't Know Why,\"performed by Norah Jones. He also played guitar on that recording and contributed four other songs to the album. Since then, he has collaborated with, and had his songs recorded by, a long list of performers, including: John Zorn, Maya Hawke, Petra Haden, Willie Nelson, Gaby Moreno, Julian Lage, Papooz, Smokey Robinson, Cat Power, Solomon Burke, Madeleine Peyroux, Gabi Hartmann and others."
