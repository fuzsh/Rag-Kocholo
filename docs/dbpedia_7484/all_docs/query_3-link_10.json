        "text": "A sonic arts experiment led and designed by some of New York’s most exciting sound artists and musicians in support of ISSUE Project Room.\n\nAfter having spent the last 22 years climbing eternity and traveling the metaphysical byways together, uber multi-instrumentalist Peck Allmond & super drummer Kenny Wollesen land at the Project Room.\n\nAfter two years in the East Village, we are celebrating our move into a renovated silo located in an industrial park on the Gowanus Canal.\n\nArtists, musicians, filmmakers, actors, poets, puppets, activists and many others gather inside the Project Room to fuel and inspire a ceremony of sounds, acts and visuals from sunset to sunrise.\n\nFor the 2004 HOWL Festival, ISSUE Project Room will be presenting an interpretation of seminal British avant-garde composer Cornelius Cardew’s 1969 experimental music piece The Great Learning from Paragraph Two."
