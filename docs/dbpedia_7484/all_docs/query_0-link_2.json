        "text": "Ya gotta change shit up, right? The NYC quartet has always had a fierce sound – its blend of slide trumpet, saxophone, bass, and drums is built on a sassy oomph that never blinks. Sure, they appreciate nuances just as much as any improvising quartet should, but they’re always ready to put some punch into a flourish and kick some ass with an anthem (grab some headphones and check their operatic spin on “Ruby Tuesday”). Their 10th album is about transition, however; it finds ‘em moving from their tried-and-true acoustic approach to cagey digi-matic maneuvers that are tweaked to form a rambunctious terrain. The vibe is 2025 if not 2029: there’s something cranky, cool, and cosmopolitan about the whole thing, like the soundtrack to a long stroll down down the Champs-Élysées if it felt like 14th Street and smelled like the Bowery.\n\nThe Hard Way was produced by Scott Harding, a longstanding band ally who sculpted their sonics previously but is crucial enough to this record’s personality to be deemed a fifth Mobster. In his hands, Kenny Wollesen’s drums get a robotics lesson, the horns of Briggan Krauss and Steven Bernstein are plied with fuzzy filters, and that groove machine wielded by bassist Tony Scherr comes off like Aphex Twin put James Jamerson on his payroll – psychedelic with a futuristic flava. From the chopped and screwed hijinks of “Fletcher Henderson,” to the dubby prayer of “Dominion,” the band finds several ways to connect the dots between abstraction and melody, earnestness and nonchalance, spontaneity and design. A couple guests drop by. Vijay Iyer adds spooky keybs to “You Can Take a Myth” and John Medeski’s B-3 gets ultra saucy on “Banacek” (which conjures visions of George Peppard’s dapper turtleneck). But added instruments don’t really matter; Bernstein’s brass and Krauss’ alto are at the center of the action, and Harding’s finger is always on the climate control knob. Because the band has heart to spare, his mildly aggro atmosphere seldom sounds harsh. And just because they’re messing with beats, don’t think Sexmob has abandoned the tradition they’ve been gleefully giving a hot foot since their late ‘90s romps at NYC’s Knitting Factory. The final snatch of melody heard as the record fades away is “Sunny Side of the Street.”\n\nTONE Audio"
