        "text": "Martin “Marty” Wollesen punctuates everything with exclamation points! That goes for UCSD ArtPower!, which he directs! He even puts the wowie punctuation after his signature on emails!\n\nWollesen initially started using exclamation points when he was working for Stanford University’s Lively Arts program. He doesn’t really remember why. But when he came here as artistic director of the performance program at the University of California San Diego, the personal quirk turned into a statement of purpose.\n\n“We were creating ArtPower! and creating a logo to represent the sense of fun and excitement, that the arts were thrilling,” he says. “The exclamation point came up as a way to express that. … It’s one of those little ways to remind us on a daily basis that we’re engaged in exciting work.”\n\nIt’s been an exciting seven years since Wollesen arrived at UCSD in 2004, topped by the 2008 opening of the Loft performance space and wine bar. “There’s no venue like it on a college campus,” he says. “We’ve had a lot of interest from (other universities) in duplicating it.”\n\nThis season, he is presenting 32 performance and film events. The lineup for the rest of this month is typical of ArtPower!’s multidisciplinary international fare: Trashtalk Theatre 3000, billed as “an interactive cinema experience”; Israel’s Vertigo Dance Company; the Vienna-based Hugo Wolff Quartet; the eclectic chamber ensemble Ethel; and a “Foovie” (food and a movie) featuring the film “La Graine et Le Mulet.” (Performances sponsored by the Loft are also listed on the ArtPower! website.)\n\nGiven the impossibility of being an expert in so many genres, Wollesen describes his job as a process of “constantly not-knowing.”\n\nAnd he relishes the uncertainty.\n\n“I love the new discovery and change and even the risk and fear that come with being in completely different environments,” he says.\n\nWollesen has a lifelong experience in encountering the new. His father’s job with a transistor manufacturer took the family overseas, and he attended elementary school in Singapore and high school in the Philippines.\n\n“I would see Chinese operas, religious and cultural festivals, Shakespeare in Tagalog,” he recalls. “I grew up in an environment where arts related to cultural identity.”\n\nAs a young adult, he sought out other cultures, working on a kibbutz in Israel, doing his senior year of college at the University of Cairo, teaching English for a year in Lisbon, Portugal. He initially thought of going into the foreign service, and he considers his work at ArtPower!, facilitating cultural exchanges, to be a lot like a foreign-service job.\n\nGiven Wollesen’s wanderlust and appetite for fresh challenges, seven years is a long time to be in one job. And, as a presenter who even gets raves from artists — in an admiring blog post, Cornelius Dufallo of Ethel wrote, “Mr. Wollesen offers a concert series for the 21st century” — he’s had offers to move on. And he admits to being “constantly tempted.” Fortunately, ArtPower! is continually launching new projects that keep him engaged.\n\nHe also feels a deep tie to the students at UCSD — “seeing these lives change and how we’re a part of that. … When I first got here, this was (seen as) a science campus and not as good as UCLA or Berkeley.\n\n“Because we’ve been consistent about treating our environment as a creative environment, I think there’s been a fundamental shift in the way the campus thinks about who we are.” His ultimate goal is for people to see UCSD as “a creative campus.”\n\nUCSD is also a happy campus — ranked last April as one of the Daily Beast’s 25 “Happiest Colleges” — and the university press office singled out the “social hub” of the Loft in an announcement about making that list.\n\nFor Allyson Green, chairwoman of the Department of Theatre and Dance, ArtPower! is a vital part of her curriculum. “(After a dance performance,) the conversations in class the next day are really rich,” she says. “I love walking into class and seeing people in the studio trying what they saw.”\n\nGreen sees the impact of ArtPower! extending beyond UCSD.\n\n“Marty has opened up the San Diego performing arts scene. … He’s really changed the environment for living in San Diego for all of us.”"
