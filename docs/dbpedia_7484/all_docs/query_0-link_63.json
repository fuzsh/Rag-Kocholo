        "text": "Bruce Lee Gallanter - Downtown Music Gallery Newsletter\n\nWELF DORR UNIT With DAVE ROSS / DMITRY ISHENKO / JOE HERTENSTEIN - Blood\n\n(Creative Sources 508; Portugal)\n\nFeaturing Welf Dorr on alto sax & bass clarinet, Dave Ross on guitar, Dmitry Ishenko on bass and Joe Hertenstein on drums. Local (?) reedman, Welf Dorr, just showed up here at DMG last week (5/6/18) and left us with a couple of discs. I didn’t know much about Mr. Dorr, although he has recorded with Sabir Mateen & Blaise Siwula and utilizes the talents of Downtown players we do know and love: Jonathan Finlayson, Shoko Nagai & Kenny Wolleson on Mr. Welf’s earlier CD. For this disc, Mr. Dorr has put together a serious quartet with Dave Ross on guitar (for Ras Moshe & William Hooker), Dmitry Ishenko (for Garrison Fewell & Jeff Platz) on bass and Joe Hertenstein (for HNH & Jon Irabagon) on drums.\n\nThe first thing I noticed about this disc was that the cover looks suspiciously like an earlier album cover by James Blood Ulmer, whose song they also cover and whose nickname, ‘Blood’ is the title of this disc. It should come as no surprise that the music does have that earlier Blood Ulmer-like jazz/rock/funk/punk demon drive! There is great fusion and there is lame (commercial) fusion. This is jazz-rock at its best and it rocks hard. I’ve heard the amazing yet often underrated guitarist Dave Ross with Ras Moshe before but not like the way he delivers here, smoking! The title tune, ‘Blood’, has that old Blood-like sly harmolodic groove/vibe: tight, sorta funky and made to help us feel better with that slamming groove. I like the way the quartet slow things down on “Dixie”, with Mr. Dorr switching to some haunting bass clarinet and Mr. Ross playing his guitar like is trying to break a chain that is holding us down. There are several guitar solos by Dave Ross which will blow your mind here, even at a soft volume, that stream of notes dances furiously like a magic carpet ride. Every once in a great while a disc appears and renews my faith in jazz/rock/fusion. This is the one! I am working on getting a gig for this band because I want to check them out live. You best dig in and go along for the ride with those in the know.\n\nMike Faloon - Go Metric\n\nThe other Night at Quinn's - The Welf Dorr Unit\n\nThe centerpiece of the stage at Quinn’s is the lava lamp Christmas tree. It’s tall and plastic and illuminated, lights slowly changing, rising and falling, undulating like a jellyfish. The consensus is that it needs to stay up year round. I’m not saying I want one at home, but here it belongs and there’s something about that tree that fits with the Welf Dorr unit.\n\nWelf Dorr is part Johnny Carson, part Rick Wakeman. He’s a jovial host, grinning beneath his pork pie hat, genuinely amused and motivated by those with whom he shares the spotlight. He’s also fond of his effects, delay and phaser. Watching him hold his alto sax with one hand, twiddle and modulate with the other, brings me back to my prog rock days.\n\nI heard something about the Welf Dorr Unit has me ready for sharp sounds, jagged sounds that jut out, get caught on anything that happens by. I expect sounds that don’t leave an easy-to-follow path. That will come later. Right now Dorr and guitarist Dave Ross surf whole notes. Ross is Dorr’s wingman. Maybe co-pilot is more apt. Ross has dozens of credits on his website. He lists the numerous types of music he’s played over the years, among them punk and hardcore. It’s a subtle distinction but it merits bonus points. (Kind of like that line from The Blues Brothers: “We have both kinds of music, country and western.”) Just to be clear, Ross is certainly more Doc Severinsen than Ed McMahon. Together Dorr and Ross sustain ideas that ease against the grain of the rhythm section, awash in the sounds of those effects boxes.\n\nDorr breaks out a bass clarinet for the next number, “Dixie,” which increases the sonic distance between he and Ross and points the band in a different direction. Drummer Joe Hertenstein swells on the cymbals, rising but not bursting. Along with the traditional line up of cymbals—hi-hat, crash, ride—he’s added some unusual characters. One is a 5” mini-cymbal mounted on his hi-hat stand. Dangling from an unused rack tom mount is the other, the remains of a battered and torn (crash?) cymbal. The thing looks like a chunk of shrapnel. I don’t know how he avoids slicing himself every time his arms pass near it.\n\nI flash back to yesterday, when I took my daughter to Dia:Beacon. It was her first museum visit. She was amped up. She wanted to draw everything she saw and write captions and copy down the artists’ names. This was all her, no prodding—or even hoping, initially—on my part.\n\nI followed her lead most of the afternoon. Until we came to Robert Smithson’s “Map of Broken Glass (Atlantis).” That’s when I wanted to rush her along. As the title implies it’s made of broken glass. What the title leaves out is that the glass is laid out on the floor and piled high, a good foot, foot and a half, with an area of twenty by fifteen, just lying there. It’s meticulously crafted and, no doubt, reflects ample deliberation. But it’s still broken glass on the floor. A trap ready to spring. There’s no border, no barrier. It’s you and the glass. The late Smithson claimed “map.” I say “menacing mound.” It creeped me out. Maggie maintained a level head. She took her time, laughing and sketching. She wrote, “Glass! Glass! Run away!”\n\nI did my best not to urge her along—model patience, man, model patience!—but even when we moved on I kept looking back. I knew the mass wasn’t going to mobilize. I assumed that no one trip and fall. Still, I looked back just to check.\n\nHertenstein dodges tragedy time and again, avoids clashing with that cymbal. He locks in with bassist Dmitry Ishenko. I expect Dorr and Ross to follow suit, succumb to the rhythm section’s gravitational pull. But they don’t. I should know by now.\n\n“Dixie” gives way to “Sympaticus,” flows so smoothly that I’m unclear whether it’s one song or two. If the first part of the set was “Songs That Echo,” then we’re now in the midst of “Songs That Swell.” The rhythm section builds tension while Dorr and Ross resist, persist with their cough syrup ways.\n\nDorr holds for a bar here, two there. He adjusts the effects boxes, though less often now. Ross leans back and into the sound. This is where he and Dorr dive in, right? Not yet. Instead they remain the relative calm at the center of the storm, reveling in the subtle, unresolved tension. This could go wrong—easily, horribly. But it’s less like a ballgame that ends in a tie and more like a short story's ambiguous ending; there’s work to do, things to sort out. It’s a welcome process.\n\nThe next number is a different tale. Dorr introduces it as a “free take on Mal Waldron’s ‘Left Alone.’” Despite the tune’s keyboard origins this version belongs to Ross. In short order he renders it a “Song That Rocks” ramping it up and sailing a sea of pyrotechnics, pulling the room together in “Holy crap!” awe.\n\nDorr smiles, laughs. He looks for someone to revel with. He turns to Ishenko but I think his eyes are closed. Dorr scans the crowd, seeking a “Can you believe this?” connection.\n\nBetween songs Dorr introduces the band. He lingers on Ishenko, and deservedly so; he’s a remarkable talent. His style is easy going, from his right hand resting on the body of his bass to his eye glasses/ beard/Chaucer-thesis-brewing-in-the-back-of-the-brain appearance. Some take life in stride. Others, like Ishenko, do so standing still.\n\n“We thought he was Russian, but he’s Ukrainian. We seriously thought of renaming the band Free Ukrainia.” (Too soon? Is Dorr on pace to be the Gilbert Gottfried of the free jazz world?)\n\nThe band’s best comes last, in the second set. (How often does that happen at Quinn’s, the first set paving the way for the second? Onset and rhyme. Set up and punch line.) There are fewer effects in “Flowers for Albert,” more traction, more grit, less grease. It’s a more conventional funk and it’s great. Ross accents. Hertenstein thumps a cowbell. “Flowers” is treated to a slow, gradual landing, getting better as it downshifts, the music mixing with clinking pint glasses and laughter.\n\n“Out Cry” offers a different kind of contrast. Ishenko motors on. Hertenstein swings. They seemed headed for the conventional but Ross counters with an angular approach, launching shards of guitar Sonny Sharrock style. The dude next to me simply says, “Wow.”\n\nThe Welf Dorr Unit brings a similar game plan to the closer, “Blood.” Hertenstein places that menacing sword of Damocles of a cymbal on the end of a stick and spins it, twirls the damn thing. It sounds cool, but I’m relieved when he tosses it to the floor and the band clicks into another funk tune. Hertenstein and Ishenko outline. Ross provides the details and Dorr finishes with the text features—title, photos, captions, etc. Meanwhile the tree pulsates. It’s another night at Quinn’s.\n\nCeleste Sonderland - All About Jazz\n\nWelf Dorr: Flowers For Albert\n\nIn 1905 Albert Einstein published three monumental papers. His theory on Brownian motion showed that minute particles in liquid move randomly; the photoelectric effect said that light can exist as either a wave or a particle; and special relativity states that the speed of light is constant, regardless of the observer's velocity.\n\nA hundred years later the United Nations declared 2005 the World Year of Physics and German-born alto saxophonist Welf Dorr played \"Flowers For Albert\", a play on the title of David Murray's 1976 Hatology tribute to Albert Ayler, at the German House in New York. That night Dorr's piece honored the great German physicist while perhaps subtly hinting at the other great Albert.\n\nBridging nations and styles with a group that included drummer Kenny Wollesen, Ethiopian bassist Henock Temesgen, Japanese pianist Shoko Nagai and trumpeter Jonathan Finlayson, Dorr, who most regularly plays in New York with his trio and his hip-hop/jazz group Funk Monk, created a strikingly eloquent live album that variegates between periods of full jubilation and quiet discovery.\n\nThe group immediately dons a vibrant conviviality on the title track. Wollesen sets up a fresh, free atmosphere with a quick, breezy drum solo before Finlayson's steady trumpet line picks up the pace, prepping the space for Dorr to take charge on saxophone. Airy cymbals and piano add lightness to the long, deep sax tones, and soon all partake in the communal activities, conceding to each other in a space devoid of doubt. Soon the sound breaks down to elemental structures. Particles of plucking noise team with silent voracity. The piece builds again to catchy, horn-led melodies then echoes away with shards of trumpet and quivering drums.\n\nFinlayson breaks out a swinging lyricism on \"Outcry\", held brightly aloft by the vivacious rhythm section. Fantastic solos spring up throughout the track. Nagai's spirited convolutions around the keys evolve into extreme counterpoint as her left hand takes on brooding chords that dissolve into a liquidy marsh of spooky bass notes, which in turn evaporate in the end into Wollesen's diligent drum solo. His progression follows the natural flow of motion created as the drums crash then fade, or beat after one another, barely leaving room between without treading on the next.\n\n\"Just 4 Us\" features a scrupulous bass solo by Temesgen. He scurries around the neck of his instrument, teetering serendipitously upon key notes before idling away. Dorr plays flute on several tunes, adding a soft tone to the album with tracks like \"Deep In\". His compositions are rich in substance, introducing new textures into traditional constructs. The last track, \"Swept Away\", mixes free jazz with the big brassy sounds of a big band, incorporating a contrapuntal nature that mimics the combination of careful symmetry and natural chaos that is science.\n\nPersonnel: Welf Dorr: alto saxophone, flute; Kenny Wollesen: drums; Henock Temesgen: bass; Shoko Nagai: piano; Jonathan Finlayson: trumpet.\n\nYear Released: 2006 | Record Label: Self Produced | Style: Modern Jazz"
