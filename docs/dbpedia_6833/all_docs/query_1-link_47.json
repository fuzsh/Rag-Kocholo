Where one character moves towards the seemingly empty, dark tank, only to have a face appear from the darkness?\n\nCheers - Chris\n\nThanks for the reference robn1. It's not exactly what I'm after, but that's not such a bad thing.\n\nI'm writing a short film and I'm doing some research on a few shots I'm thinking about using.\n\nI'm trying to work out how I'd film such a shot. I'm trying to avoid just compositing a face into a tank as I'm hoping to use practical effects as much as I can.\n\nI know it's hard to do anything 'original' these days, but hopefully I'll be able to knock something together a little interesting.\n\nCheers - Chris"
