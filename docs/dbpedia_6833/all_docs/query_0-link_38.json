        "text": "In 1962, in his introduction to the influential anthology The New Poetry, Al Alvarez characterised and excoriated what he called \"the gentility principle\". He was speaking of poetry, but what he said extended to much British art at that time. No one could accuse British writer-director Andrea Arnold of being genteel. She first came to public attention by proclaiming at the Academy Awards ceremony that the Oscar she'd just received for her short film Wasp was \"the dog's bollocks\", and her second feature-length picture, Fish Tank, makes the 1961 film version of Shelagh Delaney's A Taste of Honey, of which it is in many ways an updating, look the epitome of gentility.\n\nThe tone of Arnold's work is far removed from the British New Wave films of the 1960s, lacking that sense of hope and belief in the essential decency of the working classes found in films such as Saturday Night and Sunday Morning and The Loneliness of the Long Distance Runner, though it contains in an inchoate form their anger and defiance. Her first-feature, Red Road, which brought her the Prix du Jury at Cannes, was set in a depressed, working-class Glasgow, where its withdrawn heroine scans a bank of CCTV screens bearing images of an unremittingly dismal world. In addition to being a harsh vision of run-down inner city life, it was also a kind of thriller in which an alienated outsider moves from detached spectator to involved participant in the manner of Hitchcock's Rear Window.\n\nHer new film, Fish Tank, also the winner of the Prix du Jury at Cannes, takes us directly into the lives of those observed from a distance in Red Road, and its title suggests a life scrutinised through an intervening screen.\n\nThe central character, Mia (a remarkable performance from Katie Jarvis, a 17-year-old newcomer with no previous acting experience), is a pretty 15-year-old schoolgirl living on a rundown Essex estate on the Thames estuary near Tilbury with her 11-year-old sister, Tyler (Rebecca Griffiths), and their slatternly mother Joanne (Kierston Wareing). There's no sign of a father and as in Red Road there's no formal exposition: we are left to make inferences about the characters from their actions and occasional statements.\n\nIt's summer, Mia has been excluded from school and is to start a new one soon, probably as a boarder, but what led up to this situation we don't know. In the opening minutes, however, we discover that feisty is too gentle a word to describe her. She throws a stone up to a second-storey window to attract the attention of a friend. An overweight bruiser in a singlet appears on the balcony and tells her to \"fuck off\". \"If you see her give her a message,\" Mia replies. \"Tell her her father is a cunt.\"\n\nThis verbal aggression is immediately followed by physical violence when Mia picks a quarrel with some girls dancing together in a play area and butts one of them and runs off. Getting home, she finds the police have already called and she has a row with her mother. \"What's wrong with you?\" Joanne asks. \"You're what's wrong with me,\" Mia replies and proceeds to exchange obscenities with her little sister.\n\nFrom the very beginning of A Taste of Honey, we know that the teenage Jo yearns for something better. Only gradually do we discover that the surly, angry Mia has an inner life, that she longs for a touch of nature and poetry. She takes pleasure in dancing alone in an empty flat in her block. She is affronted by chained animals and attempts to free what she thinks is a starved horse tethered in a travellers' camp on a waste lot. Above all, her spirits are raised by her mother's new lover, a charming, good-looking Irishman, Connor (Michael Fassbender), a security man at a local warehouse.\n\nHe takes the family on a drive into the country and shows Mia how to catch fish by hand, touching something deep in her. This delicate sequence has an unforced lyricism reminiscent of the idyllic scenes where the Yorkshire lad in Kes finds a transcendence in training his kestrel.\n\nBut everything turns out badly, though not tragically. There is predatory, if semi-accidental, underage sex and the abduction of a child. Connor turns out to be weak, dishonest, self-deceiving. An audition for a job dancing at a local pub takes her into a nightmare world of sleaze.\n\nIn an apparent allusion to They Shoot Horses, Don't They?, one of the saddest tales of the 1930s Depression, Mia is told by her new boyfriend, a likable drifter, that the horse she tried to liberate has been put down: it was 16 and its time had come. Fish Tank is a forceful, deeply depressing movie, less enjoyable than Arnold's Red Road, but not quite as pessimistic."
