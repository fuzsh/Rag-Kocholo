        "text": "FISH TANK is an extremely well made, yet morally bankrupt drama about a 15-year-old girl, Mia, who lives with her single mom who is often drunk, her foul mouthed younger sister and her mom’s new live-in boyfriend, Conner. Mia dreams of being a hip hop dancer, but her terrible living conditions and quick temper alienate her from all her friends.\n\nWhen mom’s boyfriend Conner arrives, Mia is attracted to him and responds to his attention. At first, Conner actually acts like a normal Dad, though there is a sexual tension underneath the surface. When Mia gets drunk with a teenage boy she recently met, Conner seems jealous of the teenage boy. Then, Conner seduces Mia, and she willingly gets involved with him sexually. Abruptly, however, Conner suddenly leaves.\n\nMia tracks him down and breaks into his house. She discovers on a video that he has a wife and young daughter. In anger, shock, and confusion, Mia kidnaps the young daughter. She then takes her into the woods, to do what we don’t know; and, most probably, Mia doesn’t know either. The young girl falls into a river and nearly drowns, but Mia saves her and returns her to the family.\n\nIn the end, Mia leaves home with the teenage boy in hopes of finding a better life.\n\nFISH TANK is compelling filmmaking with brilliant storytelling, direction, and acting, which is mostly by first time actors. Katie Jarvis is Mia and portrays her with raw emotion and a vulnerability usually reserved for only seasoned actresses. Michael Fassbender is brilliant as the conflicted man controlled by his libido. The script is tight, though long, but it has great characters.\n\nThe difficulty with the movie, however, is that it is totally immoral. The movie helps viewers understand Mia, see her lousy life, and figure out why she might be attracted to Conner, but they will hate to see her seduced by him. Then, Mia goes and kidnaps Conner’s daughter, and all sympathy for her gets lost. Thus, the only character viewers could care about, even if out of pity, becomes profane.\n\nAs Mia and her boyfriend drive away, the director cuts to a balloon flying away, above the city. This is to show how Mia is now free of her circumstances. Yet, while she may be free of her circumstances, she is still the same old nixed-up teenager, only now in a different city.\n\nFISH TANK has a lot of graphic, explicit content. It contains a scene of Mia and Conner that shows their sex act very graphically. For this rather long scene alone, this movie becomes abhorrent. Adding to that disgusting situation, FISH TANK has plenty of strong foul and vulgar language, much of it coming from the teenagers and younger sister. The movie also contains drinking by teenagers and adults, and smoking by children, teenagers, and adults. Finally, there is one brief shot of upper female nudity and plenty of other sexual situations.\n\nFISH TANK is part of a disturbing, despicable trend in the movie industry sexualizing underage teenagers and showing pedophilia. No wonder America has so many public school teachers and administrators arrested for sexually abusing the children of the parents who help pay their salaries!"
