        "text": "What most don’t realize is how intricate an aquarium’s systems are, and how delicate the balances of the species can be that it encloses. It takes a highly specialized and dedicated team of individuals to monitor an aquarium, ensuring the health and stability of the creatures that spectators love to see. This is the job of an aquarist.\n\nWhat is an Aquarist?\n\nWork Environments\n\nKey Tasks & Duties\n\nSalaries for Aquarists\n\nJob Outlook & Growth Rate\n\nEducational Requirements\n\nRelated Degrees\n\nWhat is an Aquarist?\n\nAn aquarist, by definition, is a person who keeps an aquarium. However, someone in this role would agree that it’s much more challenging than cleaning the average household goldfish bowl.\n\nA professional aquarist is responsible for the caretaking of fish and underwater animals. In this role, the caretaker monitors the animals’ diets, oversees tank cleanliness, and recognizes signs of sickness or distress.\n\nEven though the animals that come along with working in an aquarium can be untraditional and rather ugly in appearance, an aquarist should still have a passion for the wellbeing of their creatures.\n\nIn this position, a person should strive to make an animal’s life in captivity as seamless to life in the wild as possible.\n\nWhere do Aquarists Work?\n\nAn aquarist can work in a variety of settings, the most obvious of which is at an aquarium (a facility where aquatic animals are kept in captivity to educate the public).\n\nThey can also be found in zoos, wildlife sanctuaries, or the outdoors doing fieldwork.\n\nAquarists in the Field\n\nWhile most aquarists work in an indoor facility overseeing animals, some travel out into the field (such as a river, lake, or ocean) to gather or study specimens.\n\nThis is a perfect opportunity for prospective aquarists who want an outdoorsy element built into their roles as an aquarium biologist.\n\nHowever, it’s important to consider the challenges in day-to-day work life that being in the field may bring.\n\nThere is often more travel required, the hours can be more sporadic, and there may be additional training outside of an aquarist’s pre-existing qualifications to observe aquatic specimens, such as deep-sea diving.\n\nAquarists in the Office\n\nA professional working in an aquarium may work specifically with one tank or set of tanks, such as sharks or crustaceans. Alternatively, they may get to cycle through all of the departments in the aquarium as their skills allow.\n\nAquarists expect some desk work in their average workweek, too. There are reports that need to be written on subjects like tank water conditions and animal health.\n\nFlexibility is one of the requirements to work at an aquarium, however; most are open six, if not seven, days a week, from late morning to early evening. The team of aquarists needs to come in before the facility opens to feed and check on the sea creatures – and will do the same at closing time.\n\nAs animals are living beings, their needs are constant. Aquarists must work even when the facility is closed to feed and care for the fish and may find themselves responding to emergencies at the aquarium at night.\n\nAquarist Job Description\n\nWhat does an aquarist do? A typical day in the life of an aquarist contains a wide variety of different tasks, which can go beyond the basic aquarium tank cleaner job. Caretakers of aquatic animals have lots of tabs to keep track of, including:\n\nPolicing water quality\n\nFish tank maintenance jobs\n\nEquipment repair\n\nPresenting to aquarium patrons\n\nObserving animal behavior, and more\n\nSome niches of the aquarist role can branch off into marine biology, a very close relative to the profession.\n\nBecoming a marine biologist requires a lot of the same skills needed to be an aquarist.\n\nJunior Aquarist Job Description\n\nOn the entry-level, there is a lot that junior aquarists do to grow their skills in the field. Junior-level employees might be college students taking aquarist courses, or recent college graduates acting as assistants to more seasoned aquarists.\n\nThese positions are often part-time internships or volunteering opportunities for new and aspiring aquarists looking to expand their resume.\n\nHere are a few examples of some of the day-to-day tasks that are part of a junior aquarium technician’s job description:\n\nClean tanks and perform daily tank maintenance\n\nPrepare food for animals under the nutrition plan of a senior aquarist\n\nCollect data on water substance levels and temperature levels, and deliver to a senior aquarist\n\nMentally stimulate more intelligent species with activities and toys\n\nAdminister vitamins and medicines per the instruction of a senior aquarist\n\nCheck functionality of and perform servicing on life support machinery such as filters, heaters, and pumps\n\nAssist in transporting animals from tank to tank as needed for medical attention, relocation, or cleaning\n\nLogs changes in animal diet, demeanor, activity, or appearance for reporting to a senior aquarist\n\nDeliver presentations to aquarium patrons\n\nAssist senior aquarist with research\n\nSenior Aquarist Job Description\n\nA senior aquarist is a more experienced role in the marine biology field. This professional may be responsible for tasking junior aquarists with jobs, responding to data from daily aquarium activity, and seeing that the health and wellbeing of the aquatic animals are addressed.\n\nDuring a typical workday, a senior aquarist or aquarium director’s job description might include:\n\nWrite or edit an animal’s nutrition plan, including the type of food to administer, how much, and when\n\nUse data on water substance and temperature levels collected by junior aquarists to adjust accordingly for animal comfort\n\nIdentify toys and activities that may stimulate more intelligent species, and instruct juniors to use them\n\nDiagnose aquatic animals who require medicine or vitamins\n\nResearch and identify new species that should be brought to the aquarium\n\nTravel to oceans, rivers, or lakes to collect or observe new specimens\n\nRespond to observations by junior aquarists of abnormal animal appearance and activity\n\nOrder animals to be removed from the tank when there is a need for relocation, medical attention, or cleaning\n\nPrepare presentations to be delivered to aquarium patrons\n\nInitiate and lead relevant research projects\n\nHow Much do Aquarists Make?\n\nWhile there may be some full-time aquarist opportunities out there, it’s important to note that the schedule and demands of the job more commonly call for part-time work. As with most professions, those who are interested in this field might be banking their decision on the average aquarist salary.\n\nAccording to the US Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) in 2018, the average salary for an aquarist was just under $24,000 a year, or $11.51 per hour, when with ‘Animal Care and Service Workers’. This is a roughly $1,000 increase from the same data collected a year prior.\n\nMore specifically, the average pay for aquarists is $34,000, according to Payscale.com. This means that the average hourly pay for an aquarist is around $14.\n\nThe average pay varies from state to state, but some of the notable highest paying states include the District of Columbia and Washington. Arkansas and Idaho are among the lowest-paying states for aquarists.\n\nSenior and Junior Aquarists’ Salaries\n\nThe BLS doesn’t survey the earnings of a more specific list of aquarium jobs, such as an aquarium technician salary. However, as expected with most career fields, the more experienced or specialized the professional, the higher the salary.\n\nAquarists who advance into different roles will likely see higher pay in figures such as a senior aquarist salary or aquarium curator salary.\n\nOther reports find that the top tier of aquarist pay, such as senior aquarists, averages around $32,500 annually, with the lower portion of the spectrum coming in at just under $16,500.\n\nWhat is the Job Demand for an Aquarist?\n\nThe BLS has good news for aspiring aquarists:\n\nThe field of animal care and service workers, including aquarists, is projected to grow by 16% over the next decade or so. This is a much faster average rate than other professions. For aspiring aquarists, this means more opportunities for getting hired in the specific field of choice.\n\nSurveyors anticipate more than 50,000 jobs will be added to the field over the coming years.\n\nThat information, combined with the higher turnover rate of aquarium jobs with more menial duties, leads to a very positive outlook for graduates of aquarist colleges looking to dive right into the world of underwater animal care.\n\nWhat Qualifications do I Need to be an Aquarist?\n\nMarine biology jobs in aquariums are specialized positions. There are education and internship experiences that are generally required before a person can be successful in this role.\n\nSomeone who is hoping to land in the aquarist position should plan on getting an aquarium science degree and completing an internship program first.\n\nIn this section, we’ll cover the aquarist education and training requirements, so you will know exactly how to get a job at a zoo or aquarium.\n\nHow Long does it Take to Become an Aquarist?\n\nThis depends on how much training a prospective aquarist decides to take on at a time. At a minimum, students need to have a four-year bachelor’s degree in a field such as zoology, marine biology, aquaculture, or a similar program.\n\nStudents can decide to overlap some of the training requirements of becoming an aquarist to save time, such as internships and scuba diving training. It goes without saying that if someone chooses to go through these programs one at a time, it will take longer for them to reach the end of the entry-level portion of the career. Internships can range in length from six weeks to a year.\n\nInternships can often be completed while still in school, which gives aspiring aquarists more of an edge on their resumes entering the job world.\n\nProgressing from the junior to senior aquarist role can take, on average, three to five years of further experience, plus the relevant additional training.\n\nAquarist High School Requirements\n\nWhat does it take to work at an aquarium? Especially in more competitive regions, the answer begins at the high school level. Students should immediately begin tailoring their fields of study with anything that has to do with animals, and in particular marine animals, if possible.\n\nHigher education programs also value a stellar academic record, and extracurriculars having to do with animals, agriculture, and ecosystems.\n\nExtracurriculars for aspiring aquarists in high school can include:\n\nNational FFA Organization\n\nA conservation club\n\nOr raising livestock\n\nUndergraduate Aquarist Education Requirements\n\nFuture aquarists should plan to be in college for four years, at least. To be successful as an aquarist, plan on completing a bachelor’s of science degree. Good choices include a BS in Animal Health and Behavior or a BS in Marine Biology and Sustainable Aquaculture.\n\nWhile higher education degrees such as masters and doctorates certainly wouldn’t harm an aquarist career, surveys show that a bachelor’s degree is sufficient to enter the field.\n\nMore specialized roles and senior positions, however, like those in laboratories, fieldwork, and research may require upper-level degrees among their aquarist education qualifications to compete with other highly qualified aquarists.\n\nRelated Degrees and Courses for Aspiring Aquarists\n\nOnline BS in Marine Biology and Sustainable Aquaculture: In this aquarium science degree online, students learn the biological connections between the world’s oceans, the promise and future of the aquaculture industry, and how we can all contribute to a sustainable marine environment. Wondering what else you can do with a degree in marine biology?
