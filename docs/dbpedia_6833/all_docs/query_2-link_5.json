Aquarium maintenance services are needed for many private households and businesses that own fish tanks or fishponds. Professionals can also pursue aquarium jobs in zoos, aquariums, pet stores, conservatories, sanctuaries, and amusement parks.\n\nYou do not have to be an expert to get started in Animal Behavior College’s Aquarium Maintenance Program.

Many private homes and businesses that have aquariums hire aquarium maintenance professionals to keep their tanks healthy and beautiful. Many aquarium maintenance professionals charge clients a fixed rate per fish tank gallon. Your clients might own tanks ranging from small (10 – 30 gallon aquariums) to the common 75 gallon aquarium. Some will even have 120 gallon aquariums or larger. Depending on what your clients keep in their tanks, they might require aquarium maintenance services on a monthly, bi-monthly or even weekly basis. This means your clients will continuously need your assistance with their fish tanks and that means a healthy aquarium technician salary for you.\n\nYour clients may turn to you for advice on the types of fish to keep, diseases affecting their fish, pond maintenance and more. This means there is potential to grow your business to include keeping and selling fish, aquatic plants and other aquarium supplies.\n\nAn Aquarium Maintenance School Gives You a Foundation in Aquatic Sciences\n\nStudents of ABC’s Aquarium Maintenance Program will develop a foundation in fish husbandry and aquatic science. This knowledge can help those wishing to pursue further education in aquatic life and marine sciences.
