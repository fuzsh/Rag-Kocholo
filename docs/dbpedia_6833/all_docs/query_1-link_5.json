        "text": "The other night I watched Andrea Arnold’s film, FISH TANK, for the second time. The first time I watched it I was a freshman in college and I remember thinking, well… this film is fucked up. I don’t really think I paid very close attention because, this time around, I saw so much more. In fact, I was utterly moved. I realized how beautiful this film is for so many reasons, but most notably in the way that it interweaves poetic symbolism and overt realism.\n\nThe film’s title is “fish tank.” A fish tank’s purpose is to confine a living creature to a space so that it can be viewed like an object for the pleasure and enjoyment of people. Throughout the film there are many real examples of such confinement and objectification that also function on a symbolic level because they could so easily go unnoticed. There’s a chained horse, a dog on a leash, and a hamster in a cage. The horse belongs to a 19 year old boy and she becomes a reoccurring symbol. She represents many things: confinement, appearance vs reality, innocence and childhood. We’ll come back to the horse later in this post.\n\nIn the first shot of the film, we are looking down and in on Mia. In the second shot we are looking out at the world through the windows of an abandoned apartment. Mia looks almost as if she is trapped in a fish tank. We see this kind of shot many times throughout the film where the camera is positioned behind Mia, capturing her as she looks out at the world through glass barriers. “Fish Tank” is a metaphor for the construct of femininity, the objectification of a living being for the pleasure and enjoyment of others (primarily men).\n\nMia is challenging these barriers (normative notions of femininity) from the very beginning. In the first few minutes of the film she watches as a group of girls dressed in cheap but revealing ensembles dance appallingly to the song Me & U (a song that buys into female objectification) as a pack of teenage boys watch and crudely comment on the girls’ features. One of the girls notices Mia’s mocking gaze. She asks, “What the fuck is your problem?” Mia responds, “Your terrible dancing is my problem.” This sparks an argument, which ends with Mia head butting one of the girls in the face, breaking her nose. Mia walks away.\n\nSoon after this clash we meet Mia’s mother, Joanne. From this moment forward, every scene they share is devoted to contrasting the two characters. Mia wears tracksuits and sneakers. And, her short hair is always tied up. Joanne wears tight revealing clothing and her long blonde hair is always down. Mia’s mother is almost a physical manifestation of this feminine construct and the two never stop fighting. The one thing they seem to have in common is their attraction to Conor, Joanne’s new “boyfriend.” Conor is good-looking, funny, intelligent and charming. He’s the kind of man that we’re taught to love and look up to.\n\nAt first, Conor embodies the role of a father figure. However, as the movie progresses, it becomes increasingly difficult to ignore the tension building between him and Mia. Conor outwardly appreciates Mia’s rebellious tendencies, but, at the same time, he encourages her to give into the construct of femininity she is so ardently battling. This can be seen in the little moments when he tells her to wear her hair down because it looks better that way or when he gets upset with her for not appreciating his little performative gestures. He encourages her to make an audition video for a dance show that he presumably knows is in actuality a strip show even if Mia (15) doesn’t seem to have a clue.\n\nThe two eventually have sex. After the fact, Conor leaves Joanne and doesn’t come back. Mia goes looking for him. Conor tries to send her away by driving her to the bus station and giving her a peck on the lips. We see a shot of her behind the glass of the bus stop shelter. She steps out from behind it (foreshadowing the beginning of her reversal). She decides to go back to his house and break into it. She quickly realizes that he has a family. In a moment of overwhelming emotion, she kidnaps his daughter. Mia almost seems to look at her as though she is a physical manifestation of Conor, ergo the object of her pain and anger, so much so that she throws her into the ocean. She quickly rescues her and, after doing so, realizes that the little girl could have died. This moment seems to put everything Mia is going through into perspective. She hugs Kira as she comes to the realization that no one, but Conor, is responsible for his actions.\n\nMia goes to the dance audition and quickly realizes that the audition is for strippers (objectification, entertainment, not art) and decides to walk out. She goes to visit the horse boy and hears that the horse had since been put down. She breaks down. As stated earlier, the horse represents many things: confinement, appearance vs reality, innocence and childhood. The moment in which Mia discovers that the horse has died is the final moment of her recognition. She breaks down and decides that she doesn’t want to die in captivity thus prompting her decision to go with the boy to Wales and escape.\n\nAt the end of the film, right before Mia leaves, we see a shot that we have become quite familiar with, a woman with her back turned to the camera, looking out a window at the world. It’s Mia’s mother, Joanne. She is trapped as Mia is. But, she is also dancing less like the way she usually does (formless and provocative) and more like the way Mia does (intentional and full of emotion). In this moment, we see where Mia got some of this from, we see a connection between them. Her mother is so broken down and fed up with the world, her “femininity” not having paid off. All gendered inhibitions are gone and she is dancing accordingly, similar to the way Mia does. They dance together, Mia her mother and her little sister. But, Mia and her little sister are facing their mother as if they are confronting the norms she represents and pushing back against them. Mia’s little sister doesn’t really know what she’s doing, but she holds onto Mia’s hips and follows her lead because Mia is the person she looks up to. And, in the final scene of the movie, we see Mia’s little sister Tyler through the rear window of the car as she chases after it. She is still trapped and Mia is leaving her behind, but at least she is moving in the right direction. They both are.\n\nThis is by no means a complete analysis of the way symbolism and realism are interwoven throughout this film. This is a simple demonstration of how this interweaving functions using a few examples from the film."
