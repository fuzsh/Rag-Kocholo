        "text": "Estimated Read Time: 9 minutes\n\nAre you considering an office fish tank for your facility?\n\nWe’re here to show how an office fish tank can create a calming and inviting atmosphere for you, your staff, and the people you serve.\n\nIf you’re still on the fence about getting a fish tank, read further.\n\nIn this comprehensive post, we’ll explain the benefits of office fish tanks, some popular types of tanks, and additional factors to consider.\n\nBenefits of Office Fish Tanks\n\nEnhanced Productivity and Creativity\n\nTerrapin Bright Green is a company specializing in biophilic design, and they found that adding natural elements to an office space can improve work quality.\n\nThey added plants, more lighting, and natural colors and textiles.\n\nAfter inclusion, employee well-being and creativity increased by 15%, and overall productivity increased by 6%, on average.\n\nYou may be thinking, ‘Why not set up a few plants around the office instead of buying a whole fish tank?’\n\nWell, we think you should have nature-focused décor around the office.\n\nBut it’s the methodical movements of the fish, the deep blue of the habitat, and the sound of moving water that make an office fish tank so relaxing, yet stimulating.\n\nDecrease Stress in the Workplace\n\nAccording to APA’s October 2022 Stress in America Survey, 27% of adults are often so stressed that they can’t function.\n\nTo make matters worse, 83% of US workers recorded work as a prominent source of stress in their life.\n\nThis puts employees and their companies at a disadvantage because poor focus, low productivity, and increased absenteeism are all signs of a stressed workforce.\n\nA fish tank can help with that.\n\nA research team at Exeter University found that exposure to a fish tank can lead to noticeable reductions in blood pressure and heart rate, reducing stress and putting your employees in better moods.\n\nImprove Quality of Work\n\nAre aquariums good for business? Well, imagine what a less stressed workforce looks like.\n\nEmployees with a calm mindset feel happier, more confident, and have a sharper focus. This positive mental state is conducive to more productivity and higher quality of work.\n\nSave Money on Health Costs\n\nU.S. businesses spend billions each year on lost productivity due to stress-related illnesses.\n\nWhile there is no evidence directly linking fish tank observation and reduced anxiety-related sickness, we do understand its healing effects elsewhere.\n\nThe idea is that reduced sickness and absenteeism will be a secondary effect of lowered blood pressure, decreased stress, and higher job satisfaction.\n\nOffice Aquariums Strengthen Pain Thresholds\n\nA study by Pain Research & Management sought to discover the effects of fish tanks on patients’ pain thresholds.\n\nThey tested each patient’s pain tolerance after 5, 10, 20, 30, and 40 minutes of exposure to a fish tank.\n\nThey found that those who watched the fish tank had a higher pain threshold than those with zero interaction.\n\nOffice Fish Tank Ideas\n\nNow you know why office fish tanks are so popular, but what type of aquarium is best for you?\n\nLet’s find out.\n\nPlanted Aquarium\n\nA planted aquarium focuses on the natural underwater plants, which consume CO2 and other nutrients from fish waste, uneaten food, and organic debris.\n\nA primary benefit of planted aquascapes is their biological filtering ability. These tanks still need regular upkeep, but with a large collection of underwater plants and few fish, it’s generally the easiest to maintain.\n\nThere are, however, some added setup costs.\n\nYou may save money on fish, but a heavily planted habitat needs extra lighting, fertilizers, and a CO2 system.\n\nDo you want to set up a planted aquarium for yourself?\n\nIn this post by LiveAquaria, you can learn about the setup process and all the necessary equipment.\n\nFreshwater Office Fish Tank\n\nFreshwater setups are the most popular office fish tanks.\n\nThey can house colorful fish and detailed aquascapes of rocks, plants, and other decors.\n\nIn a general sense, freshwater tanks are easier to maintain and don’t cost as much as saltwater tanks of the same size.\n\nFreshwater fish and plants are often less vibrant and colorful than saltwater ones. However, there are tons of ways to decorate a fish tank, so you can create an awe-inspiring freshwater display for a smaller price tag than saltwater.\n\nSaltwater Office Fish Tank\n\nPC: @coralsdaily Custom Aquariums Saltwater 550G (8’x4’x28”) Reef Aquarium with Steel Stand\n\nCreate a diverse habitat of vibrant fish, deep colors, unique corals, and more, with a saltwater fish tank.\n\nHowever, special care may be needed for these saltwater habitats, so to prominently display one, ensure that someone on your team can maintain it.\n\nOtherwise, you and your guests will see dirty water and struggling fish.\n\nThe size of the fish tank is also an important factor, as a saltwater tank should be no smaller than 20 gallons for water stability.\n\nIs Freshwater or Saltwater the Best Option?\n\nIt’s a common debate whether a saltwater aquarium or a freshwater aquarium is the better choice.\n\nIn most cases, it comes down to personal preference and the ability to maintain it.\n\nSaltwater is less hardy and more expensive than freshwater, but aquarists are more than capable of sustaining healthy saltwater tanks.\n\nOffice Fish Tank Styles and Sizes\n\nDesk Fish Tanks & Nano Aquariums\n\nNano aquariums can be made of glass (safer and easier to clean) or acrylic (more affordable).\n\nCleaning, feeding, and observing your fish are generally simple due to the tank’s size and mobility, but your fish may not enjoy this setup.\n\nFor starters, the larger the tank, the better.\n\nA nano fish tank limits the number of fish you can have. Plus, the limited amount of water leaves little room for error, and errors can be much more profound.\n\nAnother issue is vibrations in the water.\n\nTyping on a keyboard, for example, causes small vibrations on the desk. This creates ripples in the water which are very uncomfortable for a fish.\n\nAlso, small fish tanks often have poor filtration, or none at all, which can cause physical damage to the fish.\n\nNano aquariums are great decorations, but they’re best used for planted environments or housing small invertebrates.\n\nLarge Office Aquarium\n\nFish will be more comfortable in a large aquarium, and it’s a more viewable decoration in the office.\n\nAlso, the more visible fish, the more benefits for staff, guests, patients, and residents.\n\nIn the University of Exeter’s study referenced earlier, they also found that more visible fish held people’s attention longer, and proportionately improved their moods, compared to smaller tanks with fewer fish.\n\nNot sure where to place your fish tank?\n\nHere are a few factors to consider when setting one up:\n\nFind a stable base that can withstand a tank, water, and a full suite of equipment.\n\nMust be near grounded outlets to plug in all the equipment.\n\nAvoid direct sunlight (This speeds up algae production).\n\nAvoid doorways, speakers, TVs, or very highly trafficked areas.\n\nNOTE: It’s important to know how heavy your aquarium can get with the tank, water, fish, and equipment. For example, a relatively small, 10-gallon fish tank can weigh over 100 lbs!\n\nOffice Fish Tank with Stand and Canopy\n\nWhether this is in a workspace or lobby, this setup gives all your employees and guests the calming stimuli we touched on earlier.\n\nA stand and canopy are great for aesthetics, but they also offer stability.\n\nThey’re designed for the tank, so you know the stand can hold the weight of it and all its equipment.\n\nAll our aquariums are built by our sister company, Custom Aquariums.\n\nThe handcrafted stands and canopies offer stability for your fish tank, while also being designed to match your interior.\n\nFor more, browse our gallery to see our fish tanks in offices, healthcare facilities, and more.\n\nOffice Aquarium Maintenance to Consider\n\nCleaning Algae\n\nThere’s no way to prevent algae from growing.\n\nIt will appear on the tank’s inner walls first, but you can use a magnetic scraper to remove it.\n\nAlgae will continue to populate the aquarium, and once it gets very cloudy, you’ll have to clean the gravel, décor, and conduct a water change.\n\nWant to learn more? Here are some algae-control tips for your tank!\n\nWater Changes\n\nWater changes reset the nitrogen cycle in a fish tank, which makes water liveable for fish.\n\nYour livestock depend on you to test the water, remove algae, and make water changes.\n\nOur service pros take 1 to 2 hours to deep-clean a fish tank.\n\nIf your staff doesn’t have the time or expertise…\n\nReach out to Serenity USA today.\n\nFeeding the Fish\n\nThe amount and frequency of feeding depend on age, size, and fish species.\n\nYou’ll also need somewhere to store the food and resupply when you run out.\n\nSerenity Aquariums come with an automatic feeder that dispenses a specific amount of food at predetermined times.\n\nThis is very useful for office fish tanks, especially when you’re away from work.\n\nWith a Serenity service package, we will set the timers, provide the food, and replenish it on each service visit!\n\nRemoving Deceased Fish\n\nIf any fish die in a fish tank, you must remove them promptly.\n\nLeaving a deceased fish in a tank accelerates bacteria build-up, quickly making other fish sick.\n\nAll you need is an appropriately sized fish net to remove and dispose of them.\n\nIt’s common for some fish to die during the first cycle of an aquarium (New Tank Syndrome), so keep a close eye on your fish during this period.\n\nTesting the water\n\nThroughout the life of any fish tank, you should test the water regularly, especially during its initial cycle.\n\nSome levels to maintain are:\n\nAmmonia\n\nWater hardness\n\nTemperature\n\npH Level\n\nThere are many products for testing the water. API, for example, offers cost-effective water test strips, which you can order online or at most pet stores.\n\nMonitor Electrical Equipment\n\nKeep in mind, gallons of water near mechanical equipment may pose a safety threat, so make sure to check the rules and regulations of your office.\n\nHowever, we’ve been safely adding Serenity Aquariums to offices for over a decade, and we take care of any equipment repairs and replacements if need be.\n\nProfessional Fish Tank Cleaning Services\n\nUnfortunately, no filtration system keeps water clean forever.\n\nThat’s why we offer comprehensive, routine cleaning services.\n\nYou and your team will never have to worry about feeding the fish, maintaining the equipment, or deep cleaning the tank.\n\nYou want an office fish tank. We make having one hassle-free.\n\nWe currently service commercial aquariums across the country in businesses like:\n\nNursing homes\n\nCommercial businesses\n\nDoctors offices\n\nDentist offices\n\nRestaurants\n\nHotels\n\nAnd many more…\n\nConclusion\n\nAn office desk fish tank is an excellent decoration, but consider your office’s regulations and the space needed to provide care.\n\nA large fish tank is also an excellent choice, just make sure the base is sturdy and able to withstand potentially hundreds of pounds. To avoid stability concerns, we recommend finding a fish tank stand.\n\nSerenity Aquariums, on the other hand, are designed for businesses with busy staff. You and your team get a low-maintenance office aquarium, plus the amazing stimuli it brings your people.\n\nWhatever your situation, a fish tank can enhance your décor and improve the well-being of your employees and guests."
