        "text": "Dear forum members,\n\nCan anyone give me information about this transformer?\n\nAll I know is that is has been used in a Grundig CUC color TV chassis.\n\nThe secondary has 2 windings: 220 V , fused with a 3.15 A fuse, and 19 V, fused with 4Amp.\n\nThe primary is fused with 4 Amp.\n\nI would like to modify it for a secondary voltage of 110 V, by unwinding the 220 V output.\n\nPossibly there are 2 secondary 110 V windings in series, each wound on a leg of the U shaped core?\n\nAttachments:\n\nGrundig transformer 09068-301 (1) k (115 KB)\n\nGrundig transformer 09068-301 (2) k (106 KB)\n\nTo thank the Author because you find the post helpful or well done.\n\nHallo.\n\nDieser Plan in der Anlage stammt aus einem von mir entwickelten HiFi â€“Audioamplifier, dem n SV2000 von GRUNDIG.\n\nDort wird auch ein Zweiwickel - Netztrafo mit Doppel U-kern benutzt.\n\nIm Plan siehst Du wie man sowas von 220Volt aus 110Volt umschalten kannn oder muss, wenn der Amp. an einem 110Volt Netz laufen soll.\n\nHi there.\n\nThis plan below, comes from a hi-fi audio amplifier, I have this developed, the SV2000 from GRUNDIG.\n\nA two-winding power transformer with a double U core is also used there.\n\nIn the plan you can see how you can or must switch something from 220Volt to 110Volt if the amp should run on a 110Volt network.\n\nregards h.m. knoll\n\nTo thank the Author because you find the post helpful or well done.\n\ngood afternoon Herr Knoll,\n\nThank you for your answer.\n\nIn the meantime I was able to open the transformer partially, and I succeeded to draw the diagram.\n\nEach leg of the U-shaped core has 2 coils. Both the primary and the secondary are on these 2 coils, but each winding is split in 2 half windings. This allows me to put the 2 secondary half windings S3 and S4 in parallel, to get a 110 Volts output. This is exactly what I needed.\n\nBut one more question: between the two half windings of the primary is a component with zero ohms resistance. I think it is a kind of heat protetion, that open when te coil temperature is too high. I could not visualise it because is is embedden in the windings.\n\nAttachments:\n\nTransformer Grundig (266 KB)\n\nTo thank the Author because you find the post helpful or well done."
