        "text": "Name\n\nGrundig, Lea Gender: F\n\nBirthname Lina Langer born on 23 March 1906 at 05:00 (= 05:00 AM ) Place Dresden, Germany, 51n03, 13e44 Timezone CET h1e (is standard time) Data source\n\nBC/BR in hand\n\nRodden Rating AA Collector: Scholfield\n\nAstrology data 01°37' 10°44 Asc. 23°41'\n\nBiography\n\nGerman Jewish painter and graphic artist whose work in the mid-1930s reflected themes of the new anti-Semitic Nazi age. These works included her cycles Harzburger Front, Unterm Hakenkreuz (1936), Der Jude ist schuld! (1935–1938), Krieg droht! (1935–1937), Im Tal des Todes (1942-1943) and Ghetto.\n\nBorn in the old central heart of Dresden, she grew up as part of the city's Jewish community. Her father was a joiner/furniture maker and her mother worked in garment manufacturing. Lea attended school locally between 1912 and 1922, while rejecting, even as a young girl, the family's religious orthodoxy. She went on to study at the city's Decorative Arts and Crafts Academy before progressing, in 1924, to the prestigious Saxon Art Academy: here she was admitted into the Masterclass of Otto Gussmann where fellow participants included Otto Griebel, Wilhelm Lachnit and Hans Grundig. At the Academy she also got to know Otto Dix, whom she would come to regard as one of the most influential of her mentors. She remained at The Academy till 1926.\n\nIn 1926 she joined the Communist Party (KPD). She was also a co-founder of the Association of Revolutionary Visual Artists (ARBKD / Assoziation revolutionärer bildender Künstler Deutschlands). In 1928 she left the Jewish community and, in further defiance of her father's will, married artist Hans Grundig.\n\nIn January 1933 the NSDAP (Nazi Party) took power. Grundig remained an active participant in resistance to the regime, as part of a group that also included Kurt Magritz and Rudi Wetzel.\n\nIn 1935 a ban was imposed on exhibits of her work and in May 1936 she was finally, albeit this time briefly, arrested. Later in 1936 she traveled to Switzerland but she then returned to her home city and it was in Dresden that in May 1938 she was again arrested. In March 1939 she was found guilty of \"Preparing to commit High Treason\" (Vorbereitung zum Hochverrat) as a result of her Communist activities and/or her Jewish provenance, and was sentenced to four months imprisonment.\n\nShe served her sentence, which in the event lasted till November/December 1939, in a prison in Dresden. On her release she was granted an emigration permit. She emigrated to Bratislava, then the capital of the still notionally independent Slovak Republic (Slovakia). In 1940 she reached a refugee camp in Slovakia from where she moved as an exile to Palestine. Here she survived in a British internment camp at Atlit till 1942.\n\nOn release she remained, till the end of 1948, in Palestine, living successively in Haifa and Tel Aviv. She was again able to show her work legally: exhibitions of her work took place not just in Palestine where she was living but also in the USA, France, South Africa and Great Britain. Her membership of the Palestinian Communist Party during this time was not legal.\n\nLea Grundig traveled to Europe at the end of the year, living for a few months in Prague before returning to Dresden in February 1949: she received a professorship later in the year, teaching in 1949-1950 at the Dresden Fine Arts Academy.\n\nOn arriving in East Germany Grundig joined the new country's recently created ruling Socialist Unity Party (SED / Sozialistische Einheitspartei Deutschlands), her communist beliefs now placing her in her country's political mainstream. From 1950 till its abolition in 1952 she sat as a member on the Saxony Regional Assembly, representing not her political party, but the \"Kulturbund\" one of the \"mass-movements\" able to nominate members to regional and national assemblies under the parody-democratic system then in operation.\n\nDuring the 1950s and '60s she was able to travel extensively to countries with which East Germany was aligned politically, including the People's Republic of China, Cuba and Cambodia. In 1961 Grundig became a full member of the East German Academy of Culture. In 1963 she was able to testify at the trial of Hans Globke. From 1964 till 1970 she served as President of the Visual Artists' Association in succession to Walter Arnold. She joined The Party's Central Committee in 1964.\n\nLea Grundig died on 10 October 1977 at age 71 while at sea on the Mediterranean, while travelling on a boat. Her written archive is held at the Arts Academy in Berlin.\n\nLink to Wikipedia biography\n\nRelationships\n\nspouse relationship with Grundig, Hans (born 19 February 1901)\n\n(has as) protégé relationship with Dix, Otto (born 2 December 1891)\n\nEvents\n\nDeath, Cause unspecified 10 October 1977 (Age 71)\n\nchart Placidus Equal_H.\n\nSource Notes\n\nBirth certificate in hand from Sy Scholfield, copy on file (Dresden II, no. 528, \"Lina Langer Recte Löw\").
