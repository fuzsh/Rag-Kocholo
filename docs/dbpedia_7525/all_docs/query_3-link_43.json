        "text": "I was hoping to the find the cords for two Klang Strahler external speakers that I bought for my Grundig Majestic 190U. The console has a proprietary socket connection in the back that appears to have five connection points.\n\nNo luck though. Assuming I don't find the cord, can anyone suggest an alternative way to hook up the speakers to the console?\n\nthanks,\n\njeff\n\nTo thank the Author because you find the post helpful or well done.\n\nhere are two photos: the back of the speaker and the back of the radio. I believe on the radio, the 5 ohm connection is where the speaker should be connected.\n\nthe user guide has no explanation for the panorama connection.\n\nthanks for taking a look,\n\njeff\n\nAttachments:\n\nback of the console (152 KB)\n\nback of the speaker (97 KB)\n\nTo thank the Author because you find the post helpful or well done.\n\nThis will be the connector that you are looking for.\n\nHopefully someone has the one for you.\n\nWolfgang\n\nTo thank the Author because you find the post helpful or well done."
