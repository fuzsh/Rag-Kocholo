        "text": "I’d like to start this tongue twister with this anecdote: Four campers- two Americans and two Germans- are in the forest at an open fire when the Germans go to the camper to get some Frankfurters for the fire. Seconds later they come back screaming “BEER!” As big of beer fans as they are, the Americans run to the camper, assuming they are getting a good deal on a bottle of beer. However, as they arrive at the camper, they’re greeted with this:\n\nBy the way, that is a BEAR- as in BÄR in German! And by the way, it is scientifically proven that bears drink beer as seen in this video below:\n\nAs a tip, if a German says BEER in distress, ask them if they mean BEAR!\n\nThis is one of the most common problems we have with pronunciation of words in English. People see the spelling of English words but pronounce them in their foreign language. This example of the mispronunciation of BEER and BEAR is a classic example of such, both in general as well as in this segment of tongue twisters dealing with the long –E- in English.\n\nLong –E- words feature the following word categories, all of which have the common denominator of stretching the mouth horizontally, “Eeeeeeeeeeeee.” :\n\n-EE-: Words with –ee- also at the end, such as: deed, see, bee, ween, beech, need, steel, seem, queen, street, coffee, squeeze, freeze, committee, fifteen, teenager, etc. And yes, BEER falls here. The exception is the word “been” because it has the short “-e” pronunciation.\n\n-EA: Many words, mostly with the endings of –ch, consonant+ e, -d, -l, -m, -n, -r, -on and –t fall into this category, such as the following: reach, clean, beam, seam, leave, treat, rear, real, deal, reason and season.\n\nKeep in mind, that words, like READ and LEAD also have the short –e pronunciation, but different functions. Read is a homophone, whose short –e form is past tense. Lead (long –e) means to direct a group (German: Führen) but the short –e form means a metal found in water and pencils (German: Blei).\n\n-IE: Like in the first two categories, one will find quite a few –ie- words whose pronunciation has the long –e-. Examples include: chief, field, ariel, adieu, thief, premier, and hygiene.\n\nPlease note that words with –ie at the end, have the long –i- pronunciation, such as die, lie and pie.\n\n-IE_E: Words with –ie plus a consonant + e ending also have the long –e sound. Examples: believe, relieve, perceive, piece, achieve, butadiene, apiece, niece.\n\n-Y: Most words with a consonant plus a y will also have the long –e- sound, such as the following examples: body, marry, vary, wary, dairy, very, wavy, Navy, family, baby, cherry, thirty, memory, baby.\n\nYet take care that words with the following consonant+ y ending end with a long –i- sound: -l, -n. –p, -p and –r. Examples: cry, try, lying, rely, apply, reply, xylophone.\n\n_-E: Yet as a general rule, words with the consonant+ e at the end, unless a vowel predates the ending, always have the long –e for sound. Examples include: Japanese, Chinese, delete, concede, gene, these, geese, complete, interfere, here, severe, theme.\n\nTo sum up, long –e- words can be found in words that either have –ee-, -ie-, -ea, spellings as well as with an –e at the end, keeping in mind the exceptions. Any questions?\n\nIf not: here’s a youtube video with a guide on pronouncing the words in long –e- form. This is done in a form of tongue twisters and like in the previous Tongue Twister articles (click here and scroll to see the rest), you can listen then pause to allow yourself or your class to practice.\n\nAnd yes, we have bears drinking beer in this video! 😉 Enjoy! 🙂\n\nProst! 😀\n\nSächsisch Deutsch is probably the most local of regional dialects in Germany. Consisting of a mixture of dialects from the regions of Lausitz, Vogtland, Franconia and the Ore Mountains (Erzgebirge), people living in Saxony use this dialect with stresses on the short A and long O for vowels as well as consonant sounds mainly of sch, g, k and b. When compared with the high German, it’s like speaking a completely different language, like one sees with the Low German, Franconian German, local Bavarian and even some northern German dialects in Schleswig-Holstein and Lower Saxony. Some like Franz Xaver Kroetz find this dialect somewhat fremdschämend (embarassing):\n\nDialekt ist die Unterwäsche des Menschen, Hochdeutsch ist die Konfektion, die er darüber trägt. (EN: Dialects are like underwear, high German is the ready-made clothing a person wears)\n\nor when they love to chat with one another:\n\nDer Sachse hält nich de Gusche (Mund). (EN: The Sachse never shut up)\n\nHowever, like all the dialects, the Sächsisch des have some bright spots, apart from winning the hearts of a local woman in a village in the Ore Mountains or Vogtland region. Especially if you are a miner in the mountains along the Silver Road between Zwickau and Lichtenstein, a yodeler in Little Switzerland south of Dresden or even a farmer in the green valley near Glauchau, if you can sing the Sachsenlied, as written by Jürgen Hart, you can expect a bouquet of wild flowers and a mug of local beer from an admireress to go along with the chisel and hard hat 😉 :\n\nDer Sachse liebt das Reisen sehr. Nu nee, ni das in’n Gnochen;drum fährt er gerne hin und her in sein’n drei Urlaubswochen.Bis nunderhinunter nach BulgarchenBulgarien, im Ostblocksystem war das bereits eine Weltreise dud er die Welt beschnarchen.Und sin de GofferKoffer noch so schwer, und sin se voll, de ZücheZüge,und isses Essen nich weit her: Des gennt er zur Genüche!Der Sachse dud nich gnietschennörgeln, quängeln, der Sachse singt ‘n Liedschen! (!: Click here for the entire song and below to listen to the melody sung by him 🙂 )\n\nEither way you interpret it, Sächsisch Deutsch is the most local of all German dialects and one where if you have a dictionary, CD on how to learn it and (for the men), a beautiful local woman to teach you the language, you will open the doors to its local pride and heritage. And even if you have a partner from another part of Germany, Europe or elsewhere, having an opportunity to listen in on the locals will help you get a grasp of the language and perhaps open up new business ties with them, as they hold a treasure of inventions and patents of products we still use today.\n\nAs part of the series on German states and the quizzes and concentrating on Saxony itself, the Files has comprised a quiz, testing your knowledge of Sächsisch Deutsch and teaching you the tricks of the language, with the exception of the first part, all of the tasks consist of multiple choice questions, so you have at least a one in three chance of getting the answer right. The answer sheet will come in May.\n\nSo without further ado, 😉\n\nActivity 1:\n\nThe following words are written in Sächsisch German. Find the equivalents in high German and English. The first 10 are quite easy to find, yet the last 10 has a hint given in one of the two languages.\n\nSächsisch Hochdeutsch English Fläscher Radscho Bargblad Gliewärmel Daschendicher Biordäggl Nachellagg Breedschen Beefschdeeg Glemdnor Lorke Dünner Kaffee Reformande Strafpredigt Dreiche Dry Blembe Weak soup Bliemchen (-kaffee) Ersatzkaffee Kääbsch Picky (eater) Iezch Angry Motschgiebchen Marinekäfer Quatschen Shooting the breeze (oral) Rumbläken Herumschreien\n\nActivity 2.\n\nIn your honest opinion, what is the Sächsisch equivalent to the following cities in Saxony. Mark the best answer. In some cases, none of the answers apply and therefore, you need to choose other and write it in (and also mention in the Comment section here)\n\nZwickau (Saxony) a. Twigge b.

CLICK HERE TO ACCESS THE QUIZ! 🙂\n\nThe second day of the beer tasting marathon takes us to the city of Ulm, located on the Danube River at the border between Bavaria and Baden-Wurttemberg, and the city’s famous brewery, Golden Ox (Golden Ochsen). Founded by Gabriel Meyer in 1597, the brewery was originally located in the historic town center at Herdbruckerstrasse. After the changing of the guard, where the Schwiegger and Wieland families had control of the brewery, Johann Leibinger bought the business in 1867, and the brewery has been under control of the family ever since. Golden Ox has 17 different flavored beers, two of whom received international awards at the 2014 Beer World Cup in Denver, Colorado (USA): gold for the wheat ale beer and silver for the Oktoberfest beer.\n\nOne of the beers I tried on this day is the Kellerbier. Literally translated as cellar beer, a Kellerbier is one that has a cloudy (naturtrüb) appearance, thanks in part to the bread yeast and other vitamins that are in the beer. But more importantly, the beer is usually lagered in cellars at cool temperatures, thus allowing for fermentation to take place. The type of Kellerbier is based on how the beer is fermented. If the beer is fermented on top, it’s a Kellerweizen. If on the bottom, it’s a normal Kellerbier, also known as Zwickelbier.\n\nWhile the flavors of the Kellerbier vary based on brand, the one by Gold Ox was one of the liveliest of the beer types I’ve drunk during the 17 years residing in Germany. While the Kellerbier is usually between copper and gold, the Gold Ox has a gold color with a cloudy appearance- typical of Kellerbier types, the intensity of the flavor and aroma of the beer was especially strong, as the beer has a herb flavor, deprived of hops and grain in addition to vitamins and other ingredients added to the beer. The beer leaves a bitter taste but one that has a full body and a warming sensation. The intensity of the beer is especially strong and the balance of the beer is more bitter than sweet, leaving a general impression that the beer has a hearty taste, but one that a person can enjoy.\n\nGrade and Comment: A+/ 1,0 The Gold Ox Kellerbier is not only a textbook example of a typical Kellerbier but also one that has received lots of care when crafted. The flavor and aroma is of high quality and the beer has a fresh taste as a result. Unlike the Oettinger beer, the Gold Ox beer is sold locally, not only in Ulm but in other regions in Baden-Wurttemberg and Bavaria. The concentration on local regions has enabled the brewery to focus on the quality of its 17 types of beers, thus encouraging tourists in the region to try the beer out. It does have similar resemblance to the Schell brewery and its types of beers produced and sold in New Ulm and other parts of Minnesota, Iowa and Wisconsin. Because Ulm/ Neu-Ulm in Germany and New Ulm in Minnesota are related in many ways, it would not be surprising if both breweries have learned from each other, especially when it comes to quality trumping quantity, even though Schell’s does not have the Reinheitsgebot (beer purity laws) in the United States. These are the breweries that have become successful as a result of this practice of less attention being more quality. When one focuses locally, a produce always becomes better, if not the best. The Gold Ox has that example, which if one wants to try the beer, visit Ulm in person or order it here. I would and I will again, as the Golden Ox belongs to one of the wonders of Ulm. 🙂\n\nDay 1 of the beer tasting challenge, New Year’s Day 2016, and what is fitting but to try a Winterbier- perfect for this time of year. Germany is famous for its various beer types one will find on the shelves of grocery stores as well as through ordering. One of them is with winter beer flavor. Interesting is the fact that the origin does not come from Germany and goes way back……\n\n…….to the age of the Vikings.\n\nAs many of us know, the Vikings were Norsemen from Scandanavia whose purpose was to travel by ship, invade and conquer the regions of northern and central Europe and take their loot back to their homelands. Between the 8th and 11th centuries, the Vikings dominated the areas of Frisia and Juteland, along the coasts of present-day Lower Saxony, Schleswig-Holstein and Mecklenburg-Pommerania, bringing with them skills in shipping, the Scandanavian language and smoked meat as one of the cuisines to the region. The language was important as many of the words were later adopted in the English and Germanic vocabularies.\n\nThen there was the Winterbier. Legend has it that Winterbier was brewed especially for the Winter solstace, where a special malt flavor is added to the ingredients and the beer is stored in icehouses, thus allowing it to mature with age. When served Winterbier has a high alcoholic content but a strong powerful aroma, which allows the drinker to enjoy the taste. This special beer type is still being brewed by breweries today, albeit with some slight differences and sometimes going by the names of Festbier or Weihnachtsbier. However, the taste of a typical Winterbier today is similar to what is described in the past.\n\nMy first taste test for 2016 comes from a very popular beer brand in Germany. The Oettinger beer dates back to 1731 when it was first brewed in the city bearing its name, located in the Bavarian part of Swabia, 30 kilometers from Donauworth. In 1956, Gunther and Otto Kollmar bought the brewery and the family has owned the business ever since, with Dirk and Ingrid also having a share in the business. Since 2004, it has become Germany’s best selling beer and one can find them in supermarkets, kiosks and petro stations nationwide. 5,0 Beer is also part of the Oettinger family. Apart from its headquarters, one can find breweries in Brunswick, Gotha and Mönchengladbach.\n\nThe beer to be tasted was the Winterbier. At first, I was very skeptical because I had tried an original Oettinger pils and radler in the past. Both times I was disappointed with the beers because of its rather weak taste- tasting like a combination of water, bread and barley but not having a fine taste where a person can enjoy it. It was not as bad as the Löwenbräu, which I only drank a half bottle, left it in the fridge for three months and then dumped it because of its hideous taste (see article here). Yet sometimes bad experiences can lead to a person avoiding it, even if the brewery tries marketing a special product.\n\nWith the Oettinger Winterbier, I decided to give the brand one more chance to prove itself that it can win over the customer. After splitting a bottle with my wife over a dinner, here are some things to know about the product:\n\nColor: copper, most likely a pils with a malt flavor to it. The content is clear and the foam is not too thick.\n\nAroma and flavor: Like with other Oettinger flavors, the aroma and flavor is bread-like but with a slight caramel taste and herbal seasoning, it falls along the same lines as with the Winterbier. Yet despite its slick taste on the tongue, the impression was that the aroma was rather weak and the flavor was rather flat with more herb than caramel, more water than the ingredients, this partially fulfilling the stereotype of the beer. In other words, the craftmanship was rather plain and not so extraordinary, but the balance between bitter and sweet is in the middle. Yet if one wants to identify the ingredients just by tasting it, it is worth a shot, for a person can take a long time to drink a mug of the beer.\n\nOverall Grade and Comment: (C-/ 3,3) While the Oettinger Winterbier represents a classic example of a winter flavored beer that is typical for this time of year, I found the beer to be relatively flat. That means, like with other beers, it was too watery and had a weak taste to it. As the brewery has been mass-producing the beer products for the supermarkets since the 1960s, this concept has taken its toll on the quality of the beer. If this mass-production combined with possible cost-cutting measures are proven to be effective in the supermarkets, then it has to come at the cost of the flavor and taste of the beer, which is the case here. In order to improve on its quality, Oettinger beer should try lean production, where there is less inventory on beer and more quality on the taste of the beer products. Less is always more and while this type of beer has a unique taste that is typical of a Winterbier, the quality could be improved if the strategy of more for the supermarket combined with marketing strategies changed. While some people like the brand, one has to see that by examining it closer, there is room for improvement.\n\nAnd now to our next beer. Prost!\n\nAuthor’s Note: This article is a two-in-one deal. It’s an article in connection with Germany’s 25th anniversary, but it’s also in connection with the Files’ five years and how this column came into being. Enjoy! 🙂\n\nWhile living in Germany, one will see a unique feature that has been talked about at the dinner table: institutions, laws and agreements named after German cities. We are not talking about institutions like breweries, whose headquarters are found at their places of origin, like the Flensburger, the Berliner Weisse, the Köstritzer, the Saalfelder and the like. That topic is saved for a rainy day, unless you want to know more about German beer (in that case, there’s an article for you right here). And what is also typical are the newspapers named after cities- these are also common everywhere and heceforth will be left out here.\n\nWhat is meant by institutions are the banks and insurance companies that were founded in the place or origin, and with some exceptions to the rule, still exist today. Many of these financial institutions had their roots to the time of Bismarck’s regime beginning in 1871, the time when Germany was first founded as a country. Part of that had to do with Bismarck’s introduction of the social welfare and health care systems, where every citizen was required to have insurance in case of an accident. With that came the dawn of the insurance (More on that later). The Dresdner Bank was one of these examples. Founded in 1872 Karl Freiherr von Kaskel and based in Dresden, the bank became one of largest banks in Germany and eastern Europe, surviving two World Wars and the Cold War before it folded into the Commerzbank in 2009. There is also the insurance group Alte Leipziger, located an hour west of the city in Leipzig, which provides insurance coverage, especially for burn-out syndrome and other psychological disorders. One will find such (financial institutions) in many big cities, such as Munich, Stuttgart, Hannover and Frankfurt, just to name a few.\n\nCity laws and agreements are even more unique in Germany. While in the Anglo-Saxon countries have conferences and agreements on a larger scale in terms of international relations (such as the Washington Conference of 1922, the Bonn Agreement on Afghanistan in 2001 and the Frankfurt Documents in 1948), what is meant by agreements are the creation of domestic laws and systems that people in Germany have to abide by, which were signed and enacted at the place of origin. In some cases, like the Flensburg Point System, there is even an office that specializes in this type of law. As seen in the point system, the Kraftfahrtbundesamt (the office of vehicular registration) in Flensburg is responsible for giving drivers points for violations on the road. Other agreements known to exist include:\n\n_The Düsseldorfer Tabelle: Founded in 1962 based on a controversial ruling and its subsequent appeal, the table determines how much child support a partner has to provide at the time of the divorce. It is classified based on the amount of money that person has to pay per month until the child is 25 years of age.\n\n_Frankfurter Tabelle: This table is used to determine how much money a traveller should receive as a refund for lack of accomodations. This is determined by another table created in Kempten. The Würzburger Tabelle has a similar scheme but for boat cruises.\n\nThese are just a handful of agreements and laws that exist, which leads us to this activity:\n\nIdentify which city has its own law and agreement that was enacted in its place of origin and describe briefly what it is and how it works. That you can do in the comment section, links are welcomed regardless of language. 🙂\n\nOrigin of the Files:\n\nKeeping German cities in mind, the next question that many readers, family members, friends and colleagues have been asking me is: Why Flensburg and not Frankfurt? As Piggeldy and Frederick would say: Nichts leichter als das (Easy as this):\n\nI visited Flensburg for the first time in May 2010, as I needed to get away from everything that had been going on in my life that was unwelcomed. Just to put it bluntly and leaving it there. I had heard of the city and its proud heritage from a pair of people who either come from there or have lived there for many years. One was a former student colleague from my days as a teacher in Bayreuth, another was my best friend and his girlfriend from my days in Thuringia. I had heard about the point system before that and the beer. But upon setting foot on Flensburg soil, and exploring the city and visiting the people, it became the city worth visiting (along with the surrounding region), because of its natural surroundings, its landscape, and especially its history, tied together with that of Germany, Denmark and on the international scene. Some articles have been written about it, other themes have yet to make the column (and will soon enough). 🙂\n\nWhile my main profession is an English teacher (and I’ve been doing this for 15 years), my second profession is a writer, who has been contributing works not only to this one but also to other newspapers. One day, in response to a letter I had written to a local newspaper demanding that my hometown in Minnesota set an example of what Flensburg is doing with its historic architecture by saving the former high school building, a friend and former high school classmate of mine recommended me to the areavoices website, where I can write about my experiences as a Minnesotan living in Germany, providing some photos and food for thought. She works at the Forum Communications Company based in Fargo, North Dakota but has newspaper offices throughout the Midwest, including Worthington (Minnesota), Mitchell (South Dakota), and those throughout North Dakota in Grand Forks, Jamestown and Williston, just to name a few.\n\nAfter some thought about her offer, why not?\n\nTogether with the Bridgehunter’s Chronicles, the Flensburg Files made its debut in October 2010. The origin of the Files came from my will to keep the German tradition alive: my visit in Flensburg, using the German city name for the title, and the files- there is a file for every document submitted in a form of article, photos, interviews and the life. Besides, one can do a whole lot with the letter F, as you can see in the logos below.\n\nFive years laters, the Files is running strong. Not only does the column provide some topics pertaining to German-American themes and places to visit (Christmas markets included), but it has extended to include more on culture, education (esp. for those wanting to learn English and are non natives), current events and some food for thought on the part of the author. It now has a wordpress website, which has attracted almost a thousand subscribers (and counting) plus unknown numbers of frequent visitors to the Files’ facebook pages and twitter. In other words, it has gotten bigger, attracting a large audience from all aspects of the world. Plans are in the making in the future to include a couple more social networks and provide a few more series beyond 2015, but the Files will remain the same, an online column that provides readers with an insight of German-American themes, even if it means going behind the scenes, as the author has done already.\n\nThis leads to the last question: Why Flensburg and not other cities in Germany? We have too many institutions, laws and agreements going by the names of Munich, Berlin, Frankfurt and Hamburg, just to name a few. Plus using names of other small cities are possible but they don’t provide the kick to a top-notch column like this one. One could rename it like the Husum Herald, St.Pauli Sentinal, Münster Morning News, Nuremberg Newsflyer, Glauchau (Daily) Globe (here, the people in Worthington would have a say in that), Leipzig Local (again same as Glauchau as that group exists), Weimar World News, etc. But nothing can top what the Flensburg Files can offer for title. And sometimes using something local and building off of what the city offers for rum, beer, handball and its point system, in addition to its beaches, landscape and especially its heritage can give a city like Flensburg a boost, like it has in the five years it has been in business, with many more years to come. 🙂\n\nTo close this article here’s a word of advice for those wanting to start an online column like this one, or a career as a journalist. Because our world is full of lies and corruption, there is one variable that is constant, which is the truth. The truth is the most important commodity a person has to deal with. This includes being true to yourself and your future. If you are sure that you want to uncover the truth and expose it, then do it. People may laugh at you at first, and you may face failure for the first few months or even years, but in the end, if you are true to your heart, you will win the hearts and minds of true friends who will stay with you to ensure that you stay to your course to become a successful writer. It takes likes of patience, passion, perseverence and persistence- the 4 Ps. Once followed, and once you receive accolades and respect for you as a true writer, then you will reach your destiny and beyond. Aim high and let the heavens do the rest.\n\nAnd now, back to the writing…… 🙂\n\nSaxony-Anhalt-the state with two faces, but loaded with some interesting facts and friendly faces. With a population of 2.37 million inhabitants and a land area of 20,452 squared kilometers it is the most sparsely populated region in Germany and one of the most sparsely populated areas in Europe, with over 70% of the people living in cities with more than 30,000 inhabitants, including Dessau-Rosslau, Weissenfels, Halle(Saale) and its capital, Magdeburg. The rural areas, once laden with industry from the days of East Germany, are now places dominated by nature and agriculture. Yet despite this, Saxony-Anhalt has some jewels that are worth mentioning. Cities and towns pride themselves on their history and heritage; despite being landlocked by four states, the landscapes vary between hills and mountains in the western half and plains in the northern and eastern areas, thus encouraging tourism in the region. And thanks to the new ICE line through Halle (Saale), train connections are enabling the establishment of new commerce and business partnerships with nearby cities, such as Leipzig, Hanover, Jena, Erfurt and even Berlin, thus helping keep much of the population from emigrating to the western and southern parts of Germany and beyond.\n\nBut what do we know about Saxony-Anhalt in reality? This is where the seventh quiz on the Germany series on this state comes into play. Like in the first six, the object is to test yourself on the knowledge of the state, with the answer key to come before the end of June.

This is the first review that has been done by a guest columnist. And for a good reason….. 🙂\n\nWhen we look at Germans, we look at high quality and how they strive to achieve perfection, priding on the likes of BMW, Nutella, soccer, universities and a good beer. However, when asking a German whether they are proud of their culture or how they perceive us Americans and our way of looking at things, we see and hear another story. In this book review, Planet Germany: An Expedition into the country that is home to Hawaiian toasts (this is the English equivalent to the original title), Eric T. Hansen takes a look at the old question of German identity and how the Germans look at their own culture, from a humorous point of view. This review was done by Ann Marie Ackermann, an American expatriate living in Germany and working as a lawyer, translator and a writer. Here’s a look at the reason why a person should think about reading this book:\n\nA case of a lost cultural identity\n\nCan it be that the Germans really don’t know themselves? And that they need an American to hold up a mirror and show them why the rest of the world holds its arms open to the German culture?\n\nOne American who’s been living in Germany since 1983 seems to think so. Eric T. Hansen’s book, Planet Germany, dissects the German psyche. His scalpel is his rare sense of humor, and he cuts through layers of poor national self-esteem to find the ingenuity that created Hawaii toast. I say “rare” because Hansen manages to elicit laughs from both Americans and Germans. Any American expat in Germany will appreciate the book, not only for the insights into the collective mind of the German folk, but for Hansen’s satire.\n\nThe world admires the Germans, but the Germans don’t know it\n\nIt was in a shopping mall in Magdeburg, Germany that Hansen discovered Germans don’t know who they are. The author, a journalist, was writing an article about exports, and asked shoppers what German products and personalities they thought would be popular in America.\n\n“Nothing,” said the shoppers. One German man said he couldn’t imagine Americans would be interested in anything from Germany.\n\nFrustrated, Hansen spouted a number of possibilities. “What about Mercedes? Volkswagen? BMW? Are there any German cars that aren’t famous in America?” His list went on: Braun, Bosch, and Siemens? Gummi bears and “Nutella”? Lowenbräu? Blaupunkt and Grundig? Claudia Schiffer and Heidi Klum? Das Boot, Lola rennt, and the Brother Grimm fairy tales? Wolfgang Petersen and Roland Emmerich? Kraftwerk, Nena, Rammstein, and the Scorpions?\n\nBut it’s not easy to impress a German. “That might be,” said the man. “But nothing else.”\n\nAmericanization of Germany or Germanization of America?\n\nWe – the American expat community in Germany – have all heard it before. At some point a German has sat down with us in a café and started complaining about how the Americans are taking over the German culture.\n\nThe first time I heard it, I was incensed. Every individual German votes with his or her wallet by selecting products. Collectively, the country has chosen the culture it has now. Why blame the Americans? But on a deeper level, does a country really lose its culture by purchasing foreign merchandise like Coca-cola, jeans, and pop music? In the United States, we eat tacos and sushi, sing French and German Christmas carols, and listen to Jamaican rhythms. But we call that enriching our culture.\n\nOh no, says Hansen. That’s not what the Germans really mean. “Americanization” for them really means “modernization.” Alas, the Germans are just mourning the loss of the culture they knew as children.\n\nHansen puts the complaint under a microscope and finds a better case for the Germanization of America. At the time he wrote his book (2007), the value of German exports to the United States was almost one third more than the other way around. That’s not bad for a country half the size of Texas.\n\nBut the Germans better watch out. There is another country that’s done a lot more to infiltrate their country: Sweden. Germans read Astrid Lindgren as children and buy clothing at H&M. They listen to Abba and buy their first furniture from Ikea. They read mysteries by Henning Mankell and watch movies with Ingrid Bergman. And if that’s enough, says Hansen, the Swedes have to go out and flood Germany with Knäckebrot. But nobody in Germany talks about “Swedenization.”\n\nGermans as World Champion Complainers\n\nHansen’s satire shines most brightly in his chapter on why Germans believe complaining is a sign of higher intelligence. It’s sort of an unofficial German IQ test. Whoever does the best job of spontaneous criticism is the smartest. A comparison of the headlines in Spiegel and Time Magazine proves this, says Hansen: The American magazine offers information, and the German one critique. Even my German grandfather noticed this tendency. “When a German and an American both buy a new house,” he used to say, “the American guests come over and talk about everything they like about the house, and the Germans come over and find everything wrong with it.”\n\nAnd here Germans are the Weltmeister. Just as Arabic has more words for “camel” than any other language in the world, Hansen points out, German has more words for criticism. It’s not necessarily a bad thing, because public, grassroots criticism plays an important role in democracy. Heck, Germans even have a holiday for political criticism. Have you ever watched German television during Fasching?\n\nTo anchor the importance of complaining in the German culture, Hansen applied for a job as professor at twenty German universities. He asked the universities to establish a chair for the esthetics of complaining (Nörgeleiästhetik) and offered a curriculum. Hansen includes his application in the book, and you can find the answers of three of the universities in the appendix. And don’t tell me the Germans have no sense of humor. When I read the appendix, I always have to pull out my Taschentücher because I start crying so hard.\n\nAbout the book:\n\nEric T. Hansen, Planet Germany (Frankfurt a.M.: Fischer Verlag, 2007); 289 pages, in German. Eric T. Hansen is a journalist living in Berlin.\n\nAuthor’s Fazit:\n\nThe book did provide the author with an idea for an activity that students in both Germany and elsewhere can try at home. Click onto this interview about Germany and what to expect. Make a list and ask yourselves whether there is more to Germany than what is mentioned here, and share it with your classmates and teacher. You’ll be amazed at the various answers brought up, especially if you as the teacher is a non-native German. Good luck with that! 🙂\n\nNote: The video was produced by Jason Smith, Marc Schueler and Dan Wogawa in 2013 and powered by GoAnimate.\n\nAbout the writer and critic:\n\nAnn Marie Ackermann was a prosecutor in the United States before relocating to Germany, where she worked for 15 years as a legal and medical translator. Ann Marie now researches and writes historical true crime. Her first book, Death of an Assassin, will appear with Kent State University Press in 2017.
