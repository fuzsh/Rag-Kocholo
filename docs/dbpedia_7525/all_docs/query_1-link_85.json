        "text": "Biography:\n\nKlaus Piontek was born in Trebnitz, Germany (now Trzebnica, Poland) on February 28, 1935. He studied acting at the Theaterhochschule in Leipzig from 1953 to 1956. After performing at theaters in Halberstadt and Dresden, he joined the Deutsches Theater in Berlin in 1962, where he remained a member until he passed away. During over three decades there, he performed in all major productions and worked with Internationally-known directors, including Benno Besson, Heiner Müller, Alexander Stillmark, Alexander Lang, Adolf Dresen, Thomas Langhoff, Friedo Solter and Wolfgang Heinz. Critics and colleagues describe Piontek, who also worked as a theater director, as one of Germany’s outstanding theater actors.\n\nIn the early 1960s, Piontek also had his debut as a film actor, playing alongside Armin Mueller-Stahl and Erwin Geschonneck in Ulrich Thein’s 2-part TV production about two doctors who must come to terms with their Nazi past, Der andere neben dir. Director Egon Günther, a master of literary adaptations, then cast Piontek in several films in the 1960s and 1970s. He played the lead as writer Werner Bertin in adaptations of Arnold Zweig’s WWI novels: Junge Frau von 1914 and Erziehung vor Verdun (1974 Teleplay Award, Baden-Baden TV Festival). He also appeared in Günther’s Goethe-adaptation, Die Leiden des jungen Werthers, and his film Ursula. An expressionistic TV production based on a novel by Gottfried Keller set during the German Reformation, this latter film was accused of criticizing the East German political system and banned after one broadcast.\n\nIn the three-part television adaptation of Lion Feuchtwanger’s Die Brüder Lautensack (dir. Hans-Joachim Kasprzik), Piontek played the lead, Hansjörg Lautensack, who helps his brother, a telepath and occultist, to attain the highest Nazi circles. He also worked with director Frank Beyer on several films; of these, he is best remembered for his performance as Major Ludenbroich, obsessed with the old hierarchy and fascist spirit, in the post-WWII prison story Der Aufenthalt (Golden Lion nominee, 1983 Venice Film Festival).\n\nOver the course of his film career, Piontek played in over 100 children’s films, crime stories and contemporary and historical feature films for cinema and television, working with renowned German film directors, such as Günther Rücker, Kurt Maetzig, Frank Vogel, Siegfried Kühn and Margarethe von Trotta.\n\nAs of the late 1950s, Piontek also worked as a film narrator and voice-over artist in over 120 films lending his voice to famous international actors, including George Kennedy, Jean-Louis Trintignant, Anthony Hopkins, Franco Nero and Corin Redgrave. Klaus Piontek died in Berlin on June 22, 1998."
