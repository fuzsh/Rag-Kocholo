“Sex scenes are the same as any other normal scene,” Kristen Stewart told Harper’s Bazaar UK in 2015. It seems like a normal quote until you remember that the actress was on the Twilight press tour, so she’s talking about getting it on with a vampire. But that’s the magic of movies. You can make a Cannes-winning picture like Titane, about boning a car. In The Shape of Water, Sally Hawkins has sex with a giant fish-man. Hollywood’s era of depicting married couples separated by twin beds is long gone.

Whether it’s the yearning passion of Call Me by Your Name, the forbidden lust of In the Mood for Love, or the silly teenage fantasies of Fast Times at Ridgemont High, there’s a reason film continues to turn to one of humanity’s most fascinating desires. Sex sells—and that’s why every trailer for Challengers features two men kissing Zendaya at the same time. To celebrate the occasion, we’ve rounded up the forty best movies about sex.
