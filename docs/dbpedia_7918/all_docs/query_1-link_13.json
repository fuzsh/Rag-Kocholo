        "text": "BRIDGERTON is back and there's more sex than ever - with lesbian romps, threesomes and more steam than a sauna.\n\nNicola Coughlan, the Irish beauty who plays Penelope Featherington in the sexy period drama, has revealed she loved filming all her raunchy scenes with Colin Bridgerton, played by Luke Newton.\n\nThe pair have been getting closer and closer over the last few seasons of the wildly popular show, and this season will see them finally getting as close as possible with outdoor sex and even a tumble in a horse drawn carriage.\n\nNicola said the sex scenes were her favourite to film.\n\n\"Luke and I had a real hand in what we did and how it came across. Thankfully we had that physical comfort with one another, so it ended up being a really beautiful thing,\" she explained.\n\nShe has also revealed she is \"very naked\" at one point in the show, something she described as \"the biggest f*** you to all the conversations surrounding my body. It was amazingly empowering.\"\n\nBridgerton may have made headlines for its raunchy, sex-fuelled antics - but Netflix is known for not shying away from even more X-rated scenes.\n\nPlenty of shows have divided audiences... here, we reveal the most controversial that have landed on the streaming service over the years.\n\nGandu\n\nThis erotic black-and-white indie film, which was made in 2010 and later appeared on Netflix, was initially banned from release in India because it is so explicit.\n\nGandu focuses on the life of a vulgar, rebellious teenage rapper on a drug-fuelled binge.\n\nThere’s a number of lurid sex scenes, and full frontal nudity, but the most controversial was a sex scene that director Qaushiq Mukherjee claims was un-simulated.\n\nIn other words, the actors were genuinely having sex with each other on camera.\n\nObsession\n\nThis four-part erotic drama released on Netflix last year follows William, whose adult son Jay brings his girlfriend, Anna, home to meet the parents.\n\nWilliam and Anna are immediately attracted to each other, and as the name suggests, William becomes obsessed with her.\n\nHe follows Anna and Jay to Paris, sneaks into their hotel room and searches the room for any hint of Anna.\n\nWhen he smells her perfume on the bed he gets a little carried away and begins grinding on the pillow while performing a sex act.\n\nThe scene had people scratching their heads, with one viewer calling it “unhinged”.\n\nAnother joked: “This is why I always take the hotel cushions off the bed and put them far, far away.”\n\nSupersex\n\nWith a name like that, you get what you pay for.\n\nThis follows the story of iconic porn star Rocco Siffredi, played by Alessandro Borghi.\n\nThe real Rocco appeared in more than 1,300 pornographic films, while the Netflix series has more than 50 sex scenes over the seven episodes.\n\nIt was released on Netflix in March of this year.\n\nOne of the scenes that has riled people up was when Rocco attends his mum’s funeral.\n\nHe is devastated by the loss and one of his late mother’s friends approaches him to offer her condolences.\n\nHe becomes aroused, and the woman - who has known him for his whole life - drops to her knees and performs oral sex on him.\n\nTwo\n\nTwo strangers wake up in bed together - and realise they have been stitched together at the abdomen.\n\nThey have no memory of how they got there, and during the first two acts of the film are desperately trying to figure it out.\n\nHowever, in the third act they end up having sex - the logistics of this are not addressed.\n\nThey later discover they are long-lost conjoined twins who were separated at birth and have been kidnapped and stitched back together by their schizophrenic father.\n\nSome reviews called it a “disgusting, perverted movie promoting sick and twisted incest” - and others just called it “stupid” and “a waste of time”.\n\n365 Days\n\nThis film was one of Netflix’s number ones in 2020 despite its horrendous public reception.\n\nThe plot revolves around Sicilian mafia boss Massimo (Michele Morrone) and Polish woman Laura (Anna-Maria Sieklucka), who he kidnaps.\n\nHe gives her a year to fall in love with him before he sets her free. During the 365 days, they eventually do fall in love and have the kind of outrageous sex that made headlines for being \"soft porn\".\n\nA petition on Change.org calling for the film to be removed from the streaming service gained almost 100,000 signatures, but instead two more were released to complete the trilogy.\n\nA spokesperson for Netflix said the film had a high rating for violence sex and nudity - and also had already been released theatrically in several countries. Netflix had just licensed the film.\n\n“We believe strongly in giving our members around the world more choice and control over their Netflix viewing experience,” the spokesperson said.\n\n“Members can choose what they do and do not want to watch by setting maturity filters at a profile level and removing specific titles to protect from content they feel is too mature.”\n\nBrand New Cherry Flavor\n\nThis sex scene nauseated due to its creepy body horror element.\n\nThe psychedelic, surreal show released on Netflix in 2021 follows Lisa, who asks a witch to put a curse on someone who has wronged her.\n\nAs a form of payment, Lisa must bizarrely vomit up kittens for Boro the witch.\n\nBut when she pleads with Boro to stop the puking, a feline forces its way out through her abdomen instead, leaving a gaping wound.\n\nShe begins to touch the hole in her stomach, clearly aroused by it amongst the pain.\n\nHorrified by what has happened to her, Lisa seeks comfort in her new lover and they begin to kiss.\n\nHe then slides his entire hand and arm inside the gaping wound and they have sex.\n\nViewers were sickened by the horrific scene which went viral on TikTok. People called it “f***** up” and one viewer warned people should not watch the series at all \"unless you're gonna get real cool about a bunch of stuff really quickly\".\n\n“I’m not prudish but what the f***,” one viewer wrote while another said it was “amazingly disgusting”."
