        "text": "The second film about Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg in less than a year forgoes the traditional biopic formula for a tidy, well-acted courtroom drama centered on the case that kicked off her decades-long career fighting against gender-based discrimination and for equal rights. The film opens to a sea of men marching toward Harvard Law School to the sound of an actual drumroll, establishing the boysâ club atmosphere we are heading into in one single take. It doesnât bother with any details that pre-date Ginsburgâs enrollment there in 1959; it sets up a few key points â marriage, children, and a move to NYC where she attended Columbia â and then skips ahead to 1970 where it can mine the material it really wants to: Moritz v. Commissioner of Internal Revenue.\n\nCharles Moritz (Mulkey) was a Colorado man who was denied a tax break on his payments to a caretaker for his mother, something he was refused because he was a bachelor and because he was a man. At the time, Ginsburg was working as a professor; she was unable to gain employment as a lawyer (though she finished first in her class) on the basis of her sex. With the help of husband Marty (Hammer), himself a tax attorney, and a friend at the ACLU, Legal Director Mel Wulf, (Theroux) she argued the case before three (white, male) judges, and you can probably guess what the outcome was.\n\nItâs obvious that first-time scriptwriter Daniel Stiepleman is keenly aware of the current #MeToo climate. As Ruth (Jones) is practicing for the courtroom, thereâs a knowing wink to audiences as her male cohorts suggest that she smile at the judges. Thereâs humor in their imagined future as an absurd situation where things are more equal because they are describing our reality. They believe the American family is âat stake,â and then thereâs a clever cut to the Ginsburgs happily making dinner together at home. Other scenes are a bit harder to read. As Ginsburgâs male opponents strategize how to destroy her in court, the Washington Monument looms in the background like a giant dick, and I wasnât sure if that was meant to be outwardly funny (I found it a bit absurd). Jones makes a fine Ginsburg â especially in the mouth, lips pursed expectantly â but something in Hammerâs resigned manner paints a Marty that is more ineffectual than stoic, and the chemistry between them is pretty middle-of-the-road."
