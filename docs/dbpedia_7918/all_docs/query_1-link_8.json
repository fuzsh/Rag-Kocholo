        "text": "Stuart Marshall's feature-length documentary, ''Desire: Sexuality in Germany 1910-1945,'' leaves a lot of material unexplored, but it is still a fascinating introduction to a huge subject.\n\nThe film opens today at Anthology Film Archives on a bill with Gregg Araki's fiction feature ''The Long Weekend (O' Despair).''\n\nIn interviews with historians and with survivors of Third Reich persecution, ''Desire'' traces the origins of modern gay liberation to the rise in Germany of various back-to-nature movements in the early years of this century.\n\nThe movements exalted, among other things, body culture, gymnastics and sun-worshipping by sexually segregated groups of young people. There were so-called dance farms for women, while men gathered together to hike, work on the farm and get in touch with their bodies in other healthy ways.\n\nAccording to the testimony of Mr. Marshall's historians, the back-to-nature movments were at first a reaction against the industrialization of Germany. The same-sex friendships they promoted, including the love between a teacher and a student (called pedagogical eros), were seen as being pure. Sex initially had nothing to do with them, though sex was always the unspoken subtext.\n\nThe movie devotes most of its running time to the testimony of homosexual men and women who remember their lives in Germany in the late 1920's, the 1930's and the 1940's. Their individual stories are immensely moving for being so particular.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
