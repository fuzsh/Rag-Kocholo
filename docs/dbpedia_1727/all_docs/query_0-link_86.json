        "text": "Voting is now open for the 17th annual Banker & Tradesman readers’ poll, in which our readers cast their votes for the best providers of services and goods in the banking and real estate professions.\n\nThis is a subjective, not objective, poll. It does not measure who writes the most business, who has the most revenue or serves the most customers. It does measure the loyalty and satisfaction readers have with vendors. It is an opportunity for readers to speak up for those providers they believe are the best.\n\nPolls close Friday, Sept. 27. Results will be published in November. See last year’s winners.\n\nOne vote per person. The editors reserve the right to discount multiple votes from the same person or votes that appear otherwise fraudulent."
