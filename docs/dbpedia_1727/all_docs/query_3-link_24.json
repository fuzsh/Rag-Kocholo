        "text": "By Ruth Brown, Melissa Davlin, and Logan Finney\n\nThere are dozens of hot legislative primaries in Idaho on Tuesday, May 21, 2024.\n\nWith so much media attention on races in the Treasure Valley, the Idaho Reports team wanted to take a look at competitions outside Canyon and Ada Counties. That’s not to say we won’t be watching results in Districts 10 or 13 or 20 into the early Wednesday morning hours – we absolutely will.\n\nBut there are exciting races elsewhere in the state, too. Here are a few we’re watching. All happen to be Republican primaries, as none of the districts we looked at have Democratic contests. We will, of course, take a closer look at Democratic candidates for the general.\n\nMake sure you visit our site on Tuesday night for the Idaho Reports election liveblog. We’ll be updating with real-time results on legislative races throughout the night.\n\nDistrict 1, Senate\n\nCandidates: Scott Herndon (incumbent), Jim Woodward\n\nWhy it’s interesting: This is one of the most closely watched legislative races in the state. Idaho Education News has an in-depth writeup of this expensive rematch at the top of the panhandle. Woodward is a former Senate member who lost to Herndon by 1,707 votes in 2022. Herndon’s campaign is hammering Woodward for voting against a state law which bans transgender females from competing on school sports teams. That bill has become model legislation for other states, but the Idaho statute has been blocked by litigation since it was signed into law in 2020.\n\nCampaign finance notes: As we’ve discussed on the show repeatedly, these candidates have raised a wild amount of money for a legislative contest. Defend and Protect Idaho, a political action committee that opposes extremism, has spent over $9,200 in opposition to Herndon and another $3,300 in support of Woodward. Idaho Education News reports that University of Idaho president C. Scott Green contributed $1,000 to the Woodward campaign.\n\nDistrict 1, House A\n\nCandidates: Mark Sauter (incumbent), Spencer Hutchings, Jane Sauter\n\nWhy it’s interesting: Mark Sauter is a first-term House member facing two conservative challengers, and he is also running for a precinct seat this election. Jane Sauter (no relation to the incumbent, though Rep. Sauter’s wife’s name is also Jane) describes herself as a family-centered traditionalist. She was endorsed by the Bonner County Republican Central Committee. Hutchings is a gun store owner who ran for the Pend Oreille Hospital District board in 2019 and aligns with the Idaho Freedom Caucus. Both challengers have served on that central committee.\n\nCampaign finance notes: Spencer Hutchings has raised almost $11,000 for his campaign, including $100 from independent District 1 Senate candidate Dan Rose. Jane Sauter loaned her campaign $2,400 and has raised $8,200 in contributions, including $100 from former Rep. Eric Redman, R-Athol.\n\nDefend and Protect Idaho has spent over $4,500 supporting the incumbent Sauter. He received $1,000 from the campaign of Jeff Connolly, a former Bonner County Commissioner and the current mayor of Priest River who is running for a precinct seat. A local PAC that formed during the West Bonner County School District recall elections contributed $500 to his campaign. UI president Green contributed $250. Sauter also received $100 each from Coeur d’Alene city councilman Dan Gookin and from North Idaho Republicans founding member Sandy Patano, two vocal critics of the Kootenai County Republican Central Committee.\n\nDistrict 1, House B\n\nCandidates: Cornel Rasor, Chuck Lowman\n\nWhy it’s interesting: These two candidates are vying to replace outgoing Rep. Sage Dixon, R-Ponderay, who is not offering endorsements or otherwise participating in the race. Cornel Rasor is a former Bonner County Commissioner and very active in Idaho Republican Party politics. Chuck Lowman is an Army veteran and former missionary. He has generally received support from groups also supporting Sauter and Woodward.\n\nCampaign finance notes: Lowman has nearly $12,000 in campaign contributions from industry PACs and individuals, including $250 from Lake Pend Oreille School Board trustee Geraldine Lewis. Rasor has collected over $27,000 in contributions, including $250 from Idaho GOP Region I chairman Bjorn Handeen and $200 from Rep. Heather Scott, R-Blanchard.\n\nDistrict 4, House B\n\nCandidates: Elaine Price (incumbent), Dave Raglin\n\nWhy it’s interesting: Price is a first-term representative, one of the highest-rated legislators on the Idaho Freedom Foundation index, and a member of the Idaho Freedom Caucus. Price is one of only two Kootenai County legislators facing a primary challenger this year. She defeated former Rep. Paul Amador by 220 votes in the 2022 primary. Raglin is retiring from a corporate career in logistics. Raglin is also running for a precinct seat on the Kootenai County Republican Central Committee as part of the North Idaho Republicans slate.\n\nCampaign finance notes: Price loaned her campaign $20,000 and has collected over $16,000 in campaign contributions. Raglin has received a $250 contribution from the Idaho Loggers PAC and another $250 from retired Kootenai County chief deputy treasurer Laurie Thomas.\n\nDistrict 6, Senate\n\nCandidates: Dan Foreman (incumbent), Robert Blair\n\nWhy it’s interesting: Foreman won his 2022 primary race, with a plurality of votes in a three-way race that included Robert Blair. Foreman has been endorsed by the Republican central committees for Nez Perce and Lewis counties and Legislative District 6, while Blair has been endorsed by the Idaho Farm Bureau Federation PAC.\n\nThe GOP victor on Tuesday will face Moscow city council member Julia Parker in November. The area covered by this legislative district, which includes the University of Idaho in Latah County, elected a Democratic senator as recently as 2020, but that electoral calculus has shifted since redistricting.\n\nCampaign finance notes: Blair has received contributions from several industry and agriculture PACs, while Foreman has contributions from the central committees that endorsed him. The wife of UI president Green contributed $25,000 to a PAC seeking to unseat Foreman.\n\nDistrict 6, House A\n\nCandidates: Lori McCann (incumbent), Colton Bennett, Dave Dalby\n\nWhy it’s interesting: Lori McCann is another House Republican facing two conservative challengers. She beat her primary opponent by 1,264 votes in 2022. The incumbent senator Foreman has endorsed Dave Dalby. Former Latah County Commission candidate Gabriel Rench has endorsed Colton Bennett.\n\nCampaign finance notes: McCann has collected over $52,000 in contributions compared to $18,000 for Bennett and $6,800 for Dalby. UI president Green contributed $1,000 to McCann.\n\nDistrict 7, House A\n\nCandidates: Kyle Harris, Jim Chmelik\n\nWhy it’s interesting: These two candidates are competing to replace retiring Rep. Mike Kingsley, R-Lewiston. Kingsley initially filed to run for reelection, but he chose to withdraw and endorse Harris as an expected Idaho Freedom Caucus member. Harris is also endorsed by the district’s sitting senator, Cindy Carlson, as well as the Nez Perce County Republican Central Committee. Chmelik is a former Idaho County Commissioner who ran against then-Lt. Gov. Brad Little in the 2014 primary. Chmelik is endorsed by the Idaho Farm Bureau Federation PAC.\n\nCampaign finance notes: Harris has collected over $6,300 in campaign contributions while Chmelik has brought in $1,850.\n\nDistrict 7, House B\n\nCandidates: Charlie Shepherd (incumbent), Larry Dunn\n\nWhy it’s interesting: Shepherd faced no challenger last election cycle, in either the primary or the general. He is endorsed this cycle by the National Rifle Association and the Farm Bureau Federation PAC. Dunn criticizes Shepherd for falling short of the GOP platform and plans to join the Idaho Freedom Caucus. Dunn has also received endorsements from Kingsley and Foreman.\n\nCampaign finance notes: Shepherd received a $1,000 contribution from budget hawk and fellow House incumbent Rep. Josh Tanner of Eagle, a “silent member” of the Idaho Freedom Caucus.\n\nDistrict 8, All\n\nHouse A: Matt Bundy (incumbent), Rob Beiswenger\n\nHouse B: Megan Blanksma (incumbent), Faye Thompson\n\nSenate: Geoff Schroeder (incumbent), Christy Zito\n\nWhy it’s interesting: This district is one of the best examples of the two slates of candidates competing within the Idaho GOP. The incumbents generally align with the more mainstream wing of the party, while the three challengers are backed by the freedom wing of the party. Bundy defeated challenger Beiswenger by 582 votes in the 2022 primary. We’ll also be curious whether Blanksma’s campaign was affected by her ouster as House Majority Leader earlier this year.\n\nCampaign finance notes: This district is squarely in the sights of the Idaho Freedom PAC, the campaign arm of the Idaho Freedom Foundation. UI president Green contributed $250 to Bundy and $757.94 to Schroeder. Green in December also gave $10,000 to a PAC run by Blanksma.\n\nDistrict 9, Senate\n\nCandidates: Scott Syme, Brandon Shippy\n\nWhy it’s interesting: These two candidates hope to replace outgoing Sen. Abby Lee, R-Fruitland. Scott Syme is a former House member who lost by only 6 votes in 2022 after redistricting forced him into a match-up with fellow incumbent Rep. Judy Boyle. Syme at a Caldwell candidate forum told Idaho Reports that he planned to run against Boyle again, but Lee asked him to run for the Senate seat. Brandon Shippy is a small business owner in New Plymouth. He received an endorsement from the Idaho Farm Bureau Federation PAC as well as the Idaho Freedom PAC. He told the Idaho Statesman he believes the existing rape and incest exceptions should be removed from the state’s abortion law.\n\nCampaign finance notes: Shippy has received campaign contributions from Canyon County prosecutor candidate Chris Boyd and wealthy eastern Idaho political activist Doyle Beck. Syme has received contributions from several PACs as well as from former state senators Carl Crabtree and Patti Anne Lodge. UI president Green contributed $260.25 to the Syme campaign.\n\nDistrict 9, House A\n\nCandidates: Jacyn Gallagher (incumbent), John Shirts\n\nWhy it’s interesting: Jacyn Gallagher is a first-term representative and a member of the Idaho Freedom Caucus. John Shirts worked in the Department of Justice under U.S. Attorney for Idaho Bart Davis during the Trump administration. Shirts focuses on addressing fentanyl trafficking and criticizes Gallagher for not supporting law enforcement and agriculture funding. Rep. Judy Boyle, who is running unopposed in the primary for District 9 House B, is supporting Shirts.\n\nCampaign finance notes: Gallagher has received contributions from several fellow members of the Idaho Freedom Caucus; conservative political activist Doyle Beck and Idaho Freedom Foundation employee Fred Birnbaum; as well as former state representative and lieutenant governor candidate Priscilla Giddings. Shirts has received contributions from more traditional Idaho politicos like Luke and Tara Malek, Skip and Melinda Smyser, and former state senator and gubernatorial candidate Roger Fairchild.\n\nDistrict 24, Senate\n\nCandidates: Glenneda Zuiderveld (incumbent), Alex Caval\n\nWhy it’s interesting: Zuiderveld is one of the Senate’s most conservative members. Caval is an attorney and a member of the Twin Falls City Council. She’s running on ag and water issues – priorities for plenty of Magic Valley voters – while Zuiderveld is running on her conservative voting record.\n\nCampaign finance notes: Zuiderveld has reported $43,065. Notable supporters include Idaho Chooses Life ($1,000), Idaho Republican Party Secretary Maria Nate ($1,000), Doyle Beck ($1,000) and the Idaho Freedom Caucus PAC ($1,000).\n\nCaval has raised about $60,000, with contributions coming from the Idaho Realtors PAC ($1,000), Idaho Wheat and Barley PAC ($1,000), and Rep. Greg Lanting, who serves in the same district as Zuiderveld ($250). Rep. Britt Raybould is also supporting Caval ($1,000), as are a number of former Magic Valley lawmakers, including Jim Patrick ($1,000), former House Speaker Bruce Newcomb ($500), Laird Noh ($250), Laurie Lickley ($750), Clark Kauffman ($750), Maxine Bell ($250) and Bert Brackett ($200).\n\nDistrict 24, House A\n\nCandidates: Chenele Dixon (incumbent), Clint Hostetler\n\nWhy it’s interesting: Dixon has long been involved in the Twin Falls County GOP politics, and is the current president of the Kimberly School District Foundation. Hostetler, a web and graphic designer, moved his family from California to Idaho in 2021 and believes that Idaho is in danger of turning more liberal.\n\nCampaign finance notes: Dixon has raised nearly $67,000, with plenty of support from the ag sector. Hostletler has reported nearly $29,000, mostly from individuals. He has also received $1,000 each from the Think Liberty PAC and SMC Properties LLC.\n\nDistrict 25, Senate\n\nCandidates: Linda Wright Hartgen (incumbent), Josh Kohl\n\nWhy it’s interesting: This is Hartgen’s first term as a senator, though she previously served in the House. She’s running as a “commonsense conservative who listens,” with priorities including infrastructure, water, and education. Kohl, a relative political newcomer, has attacked her as not conservative enough, and prioritizes social issues.\n\nCampaign finance notes: Hartgen has raised more than $45,000, with contributions coming from the Esto Perpetua PAC, and the ag and medical industries. Kohl has raised $23,000, with several contributions of $1,000 coming from family members. He also has the support of the Think Liberty PAC, SMC Properties, and Rep. Heather Scott.\n\nDistrict 25, House B\n\nCandidates: Greg Lanting (incumbent), David J. Leavitt\n\nWhy it’s interesting: Lanting is a long-time member of the Twin Falls City Council, and like Hartgen, is calling himself a “commonsense conservative.” Leavitt is a combat veteran who has attacked Lanting as a “career politician.”\n\nCampaign finance notes: Lanting has raised $26,000, with most of that money coming from businesses and PACs like Esto Perpetua, Clearwater Paper, and Idaho power. Leavitt is at $13,700, with most contributions coming from individuals – including Rep. Scott.\n\nDistrict 26, Senate\n\nCandidate: Laurie Lickley\n\nWhy it’s interesting: Lickley, who served before losing the general election to Democrat Sen. Ron Taylor in 2022, is unchallenged in the primary and will face Taylor again in the general. I’m noting it here because Lickley faced intense criticism for her voting record when she was in office, and we’re a bit surprised she doesn’t have a more conservative challenger in the primary. District 26 includes Blaine County and is one of Idaho’s few purple districts, with both Democrats and Republicans serving in the legislature.\n\nCampaign finance notes: This will be another close match-up this fall. Despite not having a primary race, Lickley is already raising big funds, with recent $1,000 donations from Idaho Power, Clearwater Paper, and lots of ag-affiliated PACs and businesses.\n\nDistrict 28, House A\n\nCandidates: Rick Cheatum (incumbent), James Lamborn and Mike Saville.\n\nWhy it’s interesting: First term representative Cheatum is a current member of the Pocatello City Council. Lamborn, a recent transplant who moved to Idaho from Washington in 2021, is running on fighting “RINOs” in Boise. Saville is a repeat candidate who ran unsuccessfully for the District 28 Senate seat in 2022.\n\nCampaign finance notes: Cheatum is well in the lead for fundraising, with total contributions at $27,390, Lamborn at $9,558 and Saville trailing with $675. Lamborn did receive $1,000 from the Think Liberty PAC.\n\nDistrict 30, House B\n\nCandidates: Julianne Young (incumbent), Ben Fuhriman\n\nWhy it’s interesting: Young has sponsored a number of bills on social issues, including legislation to ban the use of public funds for gender affirming care. She has the support of the Idaho Republican Party leadership. Fuhriman, a financial planner, is active in the Bingham County Republican Central Committee, and has attacked Young’s voting record on multiple fronts, including public education and ag.\n\nCampaign finance notes: Young raised $19,641 while Fuhriman’s raised $18,487. Young received $1,000 from big names such as Idaho Chooses Life, the Idaho House Republican Caucus, and the Idaho Farm Bureau Federation. Fuhriman received $1,000 from big businesses like Clearwater Paper and Idaho Power as well as donations from Idaho Dairy Industry PAC.\n\nDistrict 31, House B\n\nCandidates: Rod Furniss (incumbent), Karey Hanks\n\nWhy it’s interesting: Hanks is a former legislator with the support of the Idaho Freedom Caucus. She narrowly lost her race against Jerald Raymond in former District 35 in 2022. Furniss has the support of major industries and businesses such as Melaleuca, Simplot, Idaho Chooses Life and agricultural political action committees. Furniss and Hanks first faced each other in 2018; At the time, Hanks was the Dist. 35 incumbent. Furniss won by less than 300 votes.\n\nCampaign finance notes: Furniss has raised $39,268 while Hanks has raised $39,457. Furniss had more business and company donations, while Hanks had more donations from individuals.\n\nDistrict 32, House A\n\nCandidates: Stephanie Mickelsen (incumbent), Sean Crystal, Kelly Golden\n\nWhy it’s interesting: Mickelsen, a longtime Idaho farmer, is a first-term lawmaker who was censured by the Bonneville County GOP, which issued a no confidence vote against her. Kelly Golden is the co-chair of the communications committee for Bonneville County Republican Central Committee. Crystal is a small business owner whose CBD shop was recently profiled by EastIdahoNews.com. He has unsuccessfully run for Ammon City Council.\n\nCampaign finance notes: Mickelsen is far ahead of her challengers, raising $61,995 in contributions. Golden raised $15,349 and Crystal raised $0. Mickelsen received contributions from various farming industries, including the Idaho Potato Industry PAC as well as $1,000 from the Idaho House Republican Caucus. Golden received funding from the Think Liberty PAC and other conservative legislators including Rep. Heather Scott.\n\nDistrict 32, House B\n\nCandidates: Wendy Horman (incumbent), Sean Coletti, Bryan Smith\n\nWhy it’s interesting: Horman is in her sixth term and is chair of the House Appropriation Committee. She has an endorsement from Gov. Brad Little, but the Bonneville County GOP issued a “resolution of guidance” against her because of her voting record. Coletti is the mayor of Ammon and has support from the Idaho Education Association, with big spending targeting Horman coming from IEA-connected Right 2 Learn, according to Idaho Education News. Smith, an Idaho Falls attorney, is the current National Committeeman for the Idaho Republican Party, and has held multiple positions in the Bonneville County GOP. He has unsuccessfully run for Congress against Mike Simpson.\n\nCampaign finance notes: Horman has raised $69,213, with more than $8,000 coming from fellow lawmakers, including $1,000 from Majority Leader Jason Monks and $1,000 from Rep. John Vander Woude, among others. She’s also raised money from large businesses, such as Melaleuca, Inc., and Syringa Networks.\n\nColetti has raised $12,446, including $1,000 from Rep. Megan Blanksma, the former majority leader.\n\nSmith has raised $8,801. Smith received $1,000 from the Think Liberty Idaho political action committee and a $100 donation from Wayne Hoffman, the former president of the Idaho Freedom Foundation.\n\nDistrict 35, Senate\n\nCandidates: Mark Harris (incumbent), Doug Toomer\n\nWhy it’s interesting: Harris is in his fifth term and serves as Majority Caucus Chair in the Senate. Toomer, a retired Idaho National Laboratory project manager, is the founder of Stand Up For Idaho, an Idaho Falls-based organization that opposes critical race theory and vaccine mandates, among other things. Toomer unsuccessfully ran for Senate in 2022.\n\nCampaign finance notes: Harris has raised $52,550 while Toomer has raised $16,694, with about $3,627 of that coming from Toomer. Harris’s campaign has large donations from both political action committees in the ag sector and private donations, including a $1,000 donation from Sen. Van Burtenshaw.\n\nDistrict 35, House B\n\nCandidates: Josh Wheeler (incumbent), Brett Skidmore\n\nWhy it’s interesting: Wheeler is in his first term, being challenged by Brett Skidmore. Wheeler has the support of the House Republicans, was previously on the Ammon City Council and owns a family-owned business. Skidmore is a homebuilder and calls himself “pro-Trump,” “anti-groomer,” and “pro-parental rights.” Skidmore’s raised $69,074 while Wheeler’s raised $55,051, but Skidmore invested $17,450 of his own money into the campaign. Wheeler’s paid $1,450 of his own money into his campaign."
