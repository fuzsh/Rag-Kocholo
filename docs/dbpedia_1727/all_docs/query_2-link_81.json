        "text": "“Hollywood’s Brat Pack: Rob, Emilio, Sean, Tom, Judd and the rest — the young movie stars you can’t quite keep straight,” read the headline of an article in the June 10, 1985 New York Magazine, a few months after “The Breakfast Club” was released.\n\nNearly 40 years later, most people don’t have much trouble telling Sean Penn from Tom Cruise, but at the time, it seemed like a whole new flock of young stars had just taken over the movie business from the old guard. The gang of attractive actors, who frequently socialized together, were dubbed The Brat Pack after appearing in movies like “Taps,” “The Outsiders” and “Rumble Fish” that signaled a fresh new influx of talent.\n\nThe word “Brat” was just a play on the 1960s Rat Pack — and an allusion to their general youthful braggadocio — but the magazine article had an outsized effect. The word led the public to view the actors as entitled jerks (the article admitted that several of the members were nepo babies), and it took them decades in some cases to shake off the reputation.\n\n“These boys — these young studs, all under 25 years old, decked out in ‘Risky Business’ sunglasses and trendish sport jackets and designer T-shirts — they were the Main Event,” the article’s author David Blum breathlessly recounted. No wonder people got a bad impression.\n\nSome actors who were barely mentioned in the article, like Andrew McCarthy, became lumped in with the group and bristled whenever the name was brought up. But now, as McCarthy debuts his documentary “Brats” on Hulu, some of them are finally embracing it as an affectionate vestige of the ’80s, an era that evokes great nostalgia among both those who made it through alive and those who wish they had been there. McCarthy explores this phenomenon in his documentary, and he now finds it a “wonderfully iconic” phrase.\n\nOther than brief mentions of Demi Moore and Melissa Gilbert as girlfriends of the actors, the article didn’t mention any women. But the women of the Brat Pack movies were every bit as charismatic, from Moore to Molly Ringwald to Ally Sheedy.\n\nThere were many other Brat Pack-adjacent actors who starred in classic films of the ’80s, from Anthony Michael Hall and Estevez’s younger brother Charlie Sheen to Matthew Broderick, Mare Winningham, James Spader, Kevin Bacon, Robert Downey Jr., Lea Thompson, Diane Lane and Phoebe Cates.\n\nFor the purposes of this guide, we’ll concentrate on the core members, especially those who were named in the article that started it all."
