        "text": "Veteran stage and TV actor David Ackroyd was born on May 30, 1940 in Orange, New Jersey, the son of Arthur, an insurance adjuster, and Charlotte (nee Henderson) Ackroyd. He studied at Bucknell University in Pennsylvania where he received his BA in 1962 as a ROTC student. Following his graduation he appeared in community theater productions while serving in Arizona with the military. He then focused on the arts as a career after enrolling at the Yale Drama School where he earned his Masters of Fine Arts in 1968.\n\nAckroyd garnered early credits at Yale Repertory Theatre (for three seasons) and Williamstown Theatre Festival (for six seasons). He also found challenging and varied stage work outside the U.S., in Taiwan, Russia, Poland, Germany, France, and the former Czechoslovakia. Dark and handsome, he extended his stage career onscreen in the early 1970s, beginning with the daytime soap operas The Secret Storm (1954) and Another World (1964). He progressed to prime-time work as Gary Ewing in Dallas (1978) until Ted Shackelford successfully took over the role when the character moved front and center with the spin-off drama Unter der Sonne Kaliforniens (1979).\n\nA durable guest star for decades on such popular TV series as Lou Grant (1977), Trapper John, M.D. (1979), Chefarzt Dr. Westphall (1982), Cagney & Lacey (1981), Macgyver (1985), Ein Engel auf Erden (1984), Doogie Howser (1989), Mord ist ihr Hobby (1984), Walker, Texas Ranger (1993), and Xena: Die Kriegerprinzessin (1995), Ackroyd had recurring roles as Dr. Boyer in After MASH (1983) and Dr. Bart Langley in A Peaceable Kingdom (1989). He provided strong support in the two-part TV special The Dark Secret of Harvest Home (1978) (starring Bette Davis) as well as such made-for-television movies as And I Alone Survived (1978), Women in White (1979), Highschool Killer (1983), When Your Lover Leaves (1983), Times Square Gang (1986), Höllenwut (1991), Agoraphobia - Die Angst im Kopf (1992), and Against the Wall (1994) and four exceptional mini-series (The Word (1978), Nutcracker: Money, Madness & Murder (1987), Armes reiches Mädchen (1987), and Im Schatten der Götter (1988)). Ackroyd also appeared in feature films, including Duell am Wind River (1980), The Sound of Murder (1982), Wrestling with God (1990), Dark Angel (1990), The Avenger - Durst nach Rache (1993), Dead On (1994), Raven (1996), and Bedingungslos - Im Netz der Leidenschaft (1997).\n\nProne to playing intelligent, upscale types or white-collar professionals (senators, doctors, lawyers, etc.), David continued to prevail on the stage with potent performances in 'Unlikely Heroes' (his 1971 Broadway debut), 'The Rivals', 'Juno and the Paycock', 'Hamlet' (as Rosencrantz), 'Private Lives', 'Children of a Lesser God' (replacing original star John Rubinstein), 'A Soldier's Play', 'Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?', 'Six Characters in Search of an Author', and an 2003 off-Broadway appearance in 'It Just Catches'. A well-seasoned narrator in documentary stories for the History Channel, he has sometimes utilized his well-modulated vocals for such animated cartoons as 'Johnny Quest' and 'Captain Planet and the Planeteers'. Much of his most recent professional work has been voice work.\n\nLong married to wife Ruth Liming, a college admissions officer, the couple has two daughters, Jessica and Abigail. He is a professor of drama at Flathead Valley Community College (Kalispell, Montana) and a founding member of the Alpine Theatre Project which produces plays for the Whitefish Theatre Company.\n\nDeborah Adair was born in Lynchburg, Virginia on May 23, 1952 to a father who was a Navy officer and a mother who was a Spanish teacher. She grew up with her brother Ashley and sister Ann. Her major influences were her mother and grandmother who always taught her to have confidence and self-assurance by telling her that she can have any job she wanted. She earned a degree in advertising and marketing at University of Washington, working afterward as a copywriter, commercial producer and assistant promotion manager for radio stations in Seattle, Washington. Her four-year marriage to Gary Baker, a budding politician, ended in 1978, prompting her to move to Hollywood. She waited tables and worked as a stewardess for a short time. But a flair for dramatic reading in high school led to voice-over work on commercials, then local stage productions. She found an agent who helped her land small parts in several TV series. But her big break came in 1980 when she was cast as Jill Foster Abbott on Schatten der Leidenschaft (1973). She was the third actress to play that role, but she made the character her own by playing her as a beautiful, sparkly bad girl. In 1983, she left daytime soap opera during stalled contract negotiations to accept the role of Tracy Kendall on highly rated night time soap opera Der Denver-Clan (1981), where she played yet another bad girl.\n\nAaron Spelling, the producer on \"Dynasty\", was so impressed with her performance that he took her off \"Dynasty\" a year later and gave her the lead role of Daisy Lloyd on another prime time show Finder of Lost Loves (1984), where she finally played a good girl. But that show was canceled a year later and Adair guest-starred on other shows, including Spelling's show Love Boat (1977) and Hotel (1983). In 1986, the \"Young and the Restless\" producers beckoned her back for one week to reprise her role as Jill when Brenda Dickson was out for a short time due to tension on the set. Adair maintained she had fun for that one week playing Jill, but Dickson remembered it differently when she unexpectedly came back to find Adair in the dressing room being uncomfortable. A few months later, Dickson left the role and Jess Walton was hired as a permanent replacement for Dickson. Of the four actresses who have played Jill since 1973, Adair is forever remembered as the \"pretty Jill.\" But she was frustrated that her career had stalled just when her personal life gained momentum. She married producer Chip Hayes in 1987, and although it was a very happy marriage, she couldn't have children and it made her unhappy at the time. In 1990, Adair was performing in previews of Cynthia Heimel's play \"A Girl's Guide to Chaos,\" when she had a freaky accident and herniated a disk. The accident caused her excruciating pain and she spent a year, on and off, in bed. She did some soul searching during that time and felt that everything happens in its own time.\n\nAfter she recovered, she picked up the pieces of her career and moved on to do a TV movie for Aaron Spelling titled Rich Men, Single Women (1990) (1990), where she played opposite another Spelling favorite: Heather Locklear. And her career picked up even more steam when Spelling reunited her with Locklear in the recurring role as Lucy Cabot on his prime time show Melrose Place (1992). She enjoyed being on the show because she spent a lot of time with her husband Hayes, who was one of the producers. While on \"Melrose Place,\" she originated the role of Kate Roberts on Zeit der Sehnsucht (1965) and became one of the few actors in history who had both a daytime soap opera and a nighttime soap opera at the same time. She left \"Melrose Place\" after one year to concentrate on the multi-dimensional role of Kate on \"Days of our Lives,\" and her gamble paid off as she won the Best Supporting Actress Award at the Soap Opera Digest Awards in 1994. But Adair and her husband wanted children. In 1995, she left her \"Days of Our Lives\" role to be a full-time mom after she and her husband adopted a child. Although, Lauren Koslow took over the role and played it for more than 15 years, Adair's fans cannot seem to forget her and hopes she will return to acting. But she enjoys the role of being real life mom so much that she and her husband adopted another child in 1997. For now, Adair seems content with her home life in Virginia and has not expressed any desire to return to acting, much to the chagrin of her fans.\n\nThe scintillating, sultry-eyed blonde (formerly a redhead) star of screen, TV and award-winning stage went on to become best known, however, for her sensual delivery pitching cigars in taunting '60s ads and commercials with her Mae Westian come-on line \"Why don't you pick one up and smoke it sometime?\" This, of course, was at a time when smoking was considered quite sexy and fashionable, and Edie Adams went above and beyond the call of duty in making these ads legendary.\n\nEdie had her hand dipped in all pools of entertainment. She was a singing siren, an award-winning Broadway musical entertainer, a deft impressionist and comedienne, a serious dramatic actress, a commercial saleswoman and a viable TV celebrity. Off-stage, she showed remarkable poise and resourcefulness when her famous first husband, landmark TV comic Ernie Kovacs, was tragically killed in a January 1962 car crash in Los Angeles and she found her family finances in dire straits.\n\nShe was born Edith Elizabeth Enke on April 16, 1927, in the relatively small town of Kingston, Pennsylvania, but moved while fairly young to Grove City. Her family relocated again, this time to Tenafly, New Jersey, where she grew up. Following her graduation from high school, Edie aspired to become an opera singer and studied voice and piano at New York's Juilliard School of Music. She then went on to take acting classes at the Columbia School of Drama.\n\nHer theatrical debut occurred with a 1947 production of \"Blithe Spirit\", and a year later she appeared in the stage show \"Goodnight Ladies\". Gradually building up her singing reputation via the nightclub circuit, her big break came when Arthur Godfrey booked her on his \"Talent Scouts\" show. She didn't come out the winner, but a TV director who caught sight of her performance envisioned in her a seductive \"straight man\" who could mesh well with a certain zany comedian. In 1951, Edie (then known as Edith Adams) was signed up as a featured singer on Ernie Kovacs's comedy show that originated in Philadelphia. The show, live and unrehearsed, became an innovative, groundbreaking effort in the relatively new medium. Outrageous and even incomprehensible at times, his comedy was deemed way ahead of its time and, as a result, had problems reaching mainstream audiences who didn't \"get it\", and the programs were short-lived. Various Kovacs platforms that included Edie were Ernie in Kovacsland (1951), \"Kovacs on the Korner\" (1952), and, of course, The Ernie Kovacs Show (1952). She and Kovacs eloped to Mexico City in 1954 and their union produced a daughter, Mia Kovacs. The duo were a popular couple in the Hollywood social circuit (moving there from New York in the late '50s) and the connections she developed out there were quite valuable in furthering her career.\n\nEarly '50s TV opened many doors for Edie and she waltzed right through them. Her New York stage debut in the popular musical \"Wonderful Town\" in 1952 had her walking away with the Theatre World Award for \"Best Newcomer\". A few years later, she slithered away with a supporting Tony Award for her bodacious take on the \"Daisy Mae\" character in the musical \"Li'l Abner\" (1956). Following that were more musical and dramatic ventures on the stage, including \"The Merry Widow\" (1957) (a show she would return to more than once), \"Sweet Bird of Youth\" (1960) and \"Free as a Bird\" (1960). On film, Edie showed the public that she wasn't just a pretty face with her sharply unsympathetic supporting performance in Billy Wilder's Das Appartement (1960) and a funny, sexier one in the second of Rock Hudson and Doris Day's three battle-of-the-sexes romps, Ein Pyjama für zwei (1961). Surprisingly, Edie and Ernie never appeared together in a film. Edie remained primarily a TV fixture and, outside of her Emmy-nominated coupling with Kovacs, winningly played the Fairy Godmother in Julie Andrews' popular TV version of Cinderella (1957), appeared regularly with Jack Paar and Dinah Shore on their respective variety shows, acted on various prime-time shows, and graced a number of celebrity game and talk show panels.\n\nOne of Edie's last pairings with Kovacs was in 1960 when they appeared as guests on the very last episode of The Lucy-Desi Comedy Hour (1957). The pair appeared as themselves, with one of the highlights being Edie crooning the lovely ballad \"That's All\". Kovacs' sudden 1962 death was a terrible reversal of fortunes for Edie. An inveterate gambler, he left her owing much money to the IRS. Instead of filing bankruptcy, however, she worked her way out of debt. In the process, her career received a second wind. Perhaps it didn't hurt that the public adored Edie and that she was a genuinely sympathetic figure in the wake of her private tragedy.\n\nShe returned to the nightclub circuit from whence she came, recorded albums, and also toured the country in various dramatic and musical comedy vehicles, including \"Rain\" (as Sadie Thompson), \"Bells Are Ringing\", \"Annie Get Your Gun\" (as Annie Oakley), \"I Do! I Do!\", \"Anything Goes\" and \"Bus Stop\". She also received outstanding notices in a few of her films, whether dramas (Verliebt in einen Fremden (1963), Der Kandidat (1964)) or frivolous comedies (Bob auf Safari (1963), Eine total, total verrückte Welt (1963), Ein Ehebett zur Probe (1963), Venedig sehen - und erben... (1967)). Moreover, she was handed her own musical variety show Here's Edie (1963) (aka \"The Edie Adams Show\") and received a couple of Emmy nominations for her efforts. She also took advantage of her famous impressions of Zsa Zsa Gabor and others, appearing in various TV comedy formats.\n\nMore than anything, however, it was her come-hither temptress pitching Muriel cigars that had TV audiences' tongues wagging. It was a smashingly successful and highly profitable coup for Edie professionally. Her late husband, a notorious cigar smoker, at one time sold Dutch Master cigars on TV. The idea then for Edie to pitch a competing slimmer cigar on TV was only natural. She had much to do with the direction of the commercials, which ran throughout the 1960s, providing them with a perfect blend of class, glamour and sensuality.\n\nWhile growing noticeably heavier in later years, she never lost her trademark humor and sex appeal. Edie could still be seen from time to time on the stage in such shows as \"The Best Little Whorehouse in Texas\", the female version of \"The Odd Couple\", \"Hello, Dolly!\" and \"Nunsense\". She remained committed to the end to restoring/preserving her late husband's videotapes and kinescopes of his ground-breaking '50s TV work. She also recalled her offbeat life with Kovacs in the book \"Sing a Pretty Song\", which was published in 1990.\n\nEdie got married again in 1964, to photographer Marty Mills, with whom she had a son, Josh Mills. That union ended in divorce in 1971. The following year, Edie married jazz trumpeter Pete Candoli. She and Candoli, who died in January of 2008, divorced in 1989. In another eerie, tragic circumstance, daughter Mia Kovacs was killed in a 1982 Los Angeles auto accident at age 22 -- 20 years after her father's similar demise. Suffering from cancer and losing weight in her latter years, the beloved Edie died of complications from pneumonia at age 81 in Los Angeles.\n\nBetty May Adams was the daughter of a travelling Iowa cotton buyer with a penchant for alcohol. Growing up in Arkansas, Betty expressed an early interest in acting and made her performing debut in a third grade play of \"Hansel and Gretel.\" Beautiful, talented and determined, the freshly minted 'Miss Little Rock' left home at the age of 19 to live with her aunt and uncle in California. For three days a week she made ends meet working as a secretary. The remainder of her time was spent taking speech and drama lessons (in due course losing her Southern twang) and making the rounds of the various Hollywood casting departments. Her first screen role was (appropriately) as a starlet in Paramount's Red, Hot and Blue (1949). This was followed by an inauspicious leading role in the B-grade Western Der Marschall von Santa Fe (1949). Over a period of five weeks she appeared in six further quota quickies of the sagebrush variety for Poverty Row outfit Lippert Productions. Since Lippert owned no actual studio facilities, most of the filming took place at the Ray Corrigan ranch in Chatsworth, California. In the summer of 1950, Betty assisted in a screen test for Detroit Lions football star Leon Hart at Universal-International. While Hart's movie career ended up stillborn, Betty clicked with producers who opted to change her first name to 'Julia.' The initial outing for her new studio was entitled Sieg über das Dunkel (1951), with the budding actress a little underemployed as 'the other girl' in a love triangle involving a blind war veteran (played by Arthur Kennedy). Her career was significantly better served in her next assignment as co-star opposite James Stewart in Anthony Mann's seminal Technicolor western Meuterei am Schlangenfluss (1952) (Kennedy this time cast as the arch villain). Adams later recalled her part in this film as \"a great learning experience\" and one of her \"fondest Hollywood memories,\" It also led to a life long friendship with Jimmy Stewart.\n\nSigned to a seven-year contract (and having her legs insured by Universal to the tune of $125,000 by Lloyds of London), Julia seemed destined to remain perpetually typecast as a western heroine. A comely actress with soft, classical features, she often gave affecting performances in what amounted to little more than bread-and-butter pictures. At the very least, she got to play romantic leads opposite some of Universal's top box-office earners: Rock Hudson (in Fluch der Verlorenen (1952) and Gefährliches Blut (1952)), Tyrone Power(Die Welt gehört ihm (1953)) and Glenn Ford (Der Mann vom Alamo (1953)). Having played a succession of 'nice girls,' Julia took a turn as leader of an outlaw gang in Der letzte Rebell (1953), set against the background of the Mexican Revolution (Van Heflin was first-billed as a mining engineer, who, having his gold mine taken over by Federales, joins Julia's band of 'insurrectos'). 'Miss Melon Patch' of 1953 was about to experience another important career change, being famously cast as the imperilled heroine Kay Lawrence in Jack Arnolds cultish monster flic Der Schrecken vom Amazonas (1954), a role Adams initially considered turning down. Shot in 3-D on a shoestring budget, the picture was light on script but strong on atmosphere and proved once again that style can succeed over content. The not inconsiderable physical charms of Miss Adams often dominated the scenery and gave the 'Gill Man' a run for his money. Audiences approved and 'Creature' spawned two further sequels, alas without Julia and with diminishing returns.\n\nIn 1955, having generated strong box office heat, Julia changed her moniker (with studio approval) to the less gentle-sounding Julie. Accordingly, she was now offered more varied material ranging from tough melodramas, to comedies and lightweight romances. Adams further established her credentials with roles which included a soft porn model who survives a plane crash in the Colorado Rockies in Plünderer am Pikes Peak (1955); as a cop's wife in Seine letzte Chance (1955) (a crime drama based on Boston's Great Brinks Robbery); a sympathetic school's doctor in the family-oriented comedy Der Privatkrieg des Major Benson (1955) and as the wife of an assistant D.A. fighting gangland on the New York waterfront in Drei Schritte vor der Hölle (1957). After 1957, her contract with Universal having expired, Adams successfully transitioned into television where she remained a firm favorite in westerns and crime dramas, guest-starring in just about every classic prime-time series covering both genres (Perry Mason (1957) being her personal favorite). Latterly, she had a popular recurring role as real estate lady Eve Simpson in Mord ist ihr Hobby (1984). Adams was still in demand for occasional screen appearances well into her 90s.\n\nShe was married twice: first, to writer-producer Leonard Stern, and, secondly, to the actor Ray Danton. Julie Adams passed away in Los Angeles on February 3, 2019 at the age of 92. Her autobiography (co-written with her son Mitchell Danton), entitled \"The Lucky Southern Star: Reflections from the Black Lagoon\" appeared in 2011.\n\nThe only son of Green Acres (1965) star Eddie Albert and Mexican actress/dancer Margo, Edward Laurence Albert managed to come out from under his father's strong shadow and make a gallant showing of his own as a gifted thespian. Born in Los Angeles on February 20, 1951, Edward's multi-cultural heritage and talented gene pool allowed him to become a man of many talents: songwriter, drummer, singer, photographer and, most importantly, activist.\n\nGrowing up, he inherited an early interest in music and the performing arts. He made an auspicious film debut at the age of 14 in The Fool Killer (1965) co-starring as a young runaway who teams up with a tormented Civil War veteran (Anthony Perkins), a teaming that leads to murder. A strong, mature role for such a youngster, his next film appearance wouldn't come about until seven years later. In the meantime Edward attended Oxford University and was studying psychology at UCLA when offered the breakthrough of a lifetime.\n\nSigned up to play the difficult role of blind Don Baker--played on Broadway by Keir Dullea--who yearns for freedom away from his domineering mom (Oscar winner Eileen Heckart) and finds it in the arms of a liberated lass named Jill (Goldie Hawn) in Schmetterlinge sind frei (1972), Edward easily captured the hearts of millions with his tender, life-affirming performance. Edward walked home with the cinema's Golden Globe Award as \"Male Newcomer of the Year.\" A confident, intelligent actor with a serene handsomeness and 1000-watt smile who just happened to possess the most magnetic pale eyes this side of Meg Foster, Edward was on a seemingly strong path to film stardom. Although he never found a comparable success to \"Butterfly,\" he did follow it up with another theater comedy favorite, Vierzig Karat (1973), in which he had a dalliance with older actress Liv Ullmann. He also played Charlton Heston's military son in Schlacht um Midway (1976), followed by highly visible roles in Das Domino-Prinzip (1977) and Der große Grieche (1978).\n\nWhen film stardom did not pan out, Edward saw TV as a welcoming medium and made up for his sudden lack of star power with wonderful turns in major TV minimovies, notably The Last Convertible (1979). By the 1980s he had started making the rounds in formula low-budget action films and usually fared best when his flashy villainous side came into view. While such obvious movie titles as Das Haus der Verdammten (1982), Fist Fighter (1988), Demon Keeper (1994) and Stageghost (2000) pointed out the lack of quality in his offerings, it did provide a steady income and visibility. He also made frequent guest appearances on such shows as Falcon Crest (1981), L.A. Law: Staranwälte, Tricks, Prozesse (1986), Star Trek: Deep Space Nine (1993) and Dr. Quinn - Ärztin aus Leidenschaft (1993) that kept him in the public eye. A solid regular as both good guy and bad guy on series TV, he gave his life (and, it seems, his paycheck) to the Beast after three seasons on Die Schöne und das Biest (1987) and, in contrast, played the dastardly Dr. Bennett Devlin on the daytime soap Port Charles (1997) for its first three seasons. Edward also used his vocal talents in animation involving such superhero icons as The Fantastic Four - Das Superteam (1978), New Spiderman (1994) and \"The Power Rangers\".\n\nFrom his father and mother Edward developed a deep love and appreciation for the land and the diversity of cultures. As such, he divided his time between acting work and activism just as his father had done. Having owned a ranch in Malibu for over 30 years, he was a strong, positive influence and passionate spokesperson when it came to environmental and cultural affairs. In recent years he served on the California Coastal Commission and California Native American Heritage Commission.\n\nLong married to lovely British-born actress Katherine Woodville, the couple's daughter, Thais, continued the family musical tradition as a singer/songwriter for the rock group Sugar in Wartime. Following his mother's passing from brain cancer in 1985, Edward became a selfless caregiver to his aging father, who began to develop early signs of Alzheimer's disease in the 1990s. His father lived for more than a decade in declining health, dying in May 2005. In early 2005, Edward discovered he too was seriously ill after being diagnosed with lung cancer. He died surrounded by family on September 22, 2006, at the relatively young age of 55.\n\nAna Alicia Ortiz Torres is a Mexican actress, she was born in Mexico City, Mexico on December 12, 1956. Ana Alicia became the third of four children to Carlos Celestino Ortiz and Alicia Torres Ortiz. Her parents were hotel agents in Acapulco, Guerrero, Mexico. She grew up between Acapulco, Mexico City and El Paso, Texas from age 6 after the passing of her father. There, she lived with her grandmother, widowed mother, her uncle Louie and three siblings in a house her father had purchased for her grandmother.\n\nAna Alicia received a full scholarship to attend the prestigious Wellesley College in Massachusetts. Upon arrival, Ana Alicia auditioned and won the lead role for Jules Feiffer's \"Crawling Arnold\". On summer break after her freshmen year, Ana Alicia auditioned for The Adobe Horseshoe Dinner Theatre outside El Paso, Texas. The theatre offered her a position as a recurring actress in all feature productions. The opportunity would allow her to work with name actors from Hollywood and New York and receive a large weekly salary. She accepted the offer and also acquired her actor's equity card through her term. She left Wellesley and finished her education at The University of Texas at El Paso (UTEP). Ana Alicia spent the next three years, performing in main stage productions at UTEP as well as having significant roles in the Adobe Horseshoe repertoire.\n\nAfter graduation, Ana Alicia moved to Los Angeles and struggled to attain success as an actress while studying for her law school entrance exam. Six months later, her big acting break came when she won the role of Alicia Nieves on ABC's Ryan's Hope (1975). According to Ana Alicia, working on the show in New York was exciting - not only because it was an acting job, but because she was a fan of the the show. Although the role was a secondary one - Nieves had romances with policeman Bob Reid and Dr. Pat Ryan. It provided her with much-needed exposure.\n\nAfter 15 months, Ana Alicia left the show to become one of the last Universal Studios contract players. She moved to Los Angeles and in addition to her work as a contract player, she attended Southwestern University Law School at night. As she acquired larger roles that required her to leave town, it became impossible to continue the grueling schedule of acting during the day and studying for school at night. She had to make a choice so she sat down and wrote the pros and cons of each decision and when she realized her passion was to act, she made the very difficult decision to drop out of law school. Once she was focused, her career began to open up quickly.\n\nShe landed several roles on major television films and series' episodes. Within a year, the Universal terminated their contract player department. It was the end of an era. Soon after, her teacher Milton Katselis suggested she stop playing virginal roles and turn to roles such as the tortured, sexually deprived Maggie in \"Cat on a Hot Tin Roof\". Exploring this previously undiscovered part of her acting range, Ana Alicia pursued an audition for Falcon Crest (1981). In the room was a female casting director Doris Sabbagh along with Earl Hamner, Robert McCollough, and Larry Elikann. Ana Alicia's job was to seduce Lorenzo, played in the room by Doris. As Ana Alicia ran her fingers up Doris' stockings, conservative Southerner Earl Hamner stood up and stopped the scene, and said, \"Thank you very much. That was wonderful.\" Less than an hour later, Ana Alicia's agent called to let her know she had won the role of Melissa Agretti.\n\nAna Alicia was on the show for seven years, playing the ambitious, scheming Melissa Agretti, and playing opposite Jane Wyman as Angela Channing and a plethora of handsome men. In October of 1988, Ana Alicia was written out of Falcon Crest (1981), and the show subsequently dropped considerably in the ratings. In a last ditch attempt to revitalize the show, she was brought back to the show later that season as a look-a-like of Melissa's, named Samantha Ross. The guest stint was short-lived and Ana Alicia quickly moved on to other projects, including the TV movies Katastrophenflug 243 (1990) and Rio Shannon (1993), as well as the feature film, Romero (1989). Ana Alicia has also devoted much of her time to various animal and human causes. She was the national spokesperson for the Humane Society, and has presented awards promoting Hispanic achievements in the media on behalf of the Golden Eagle Awards. Lorenzo Lamas was co-presenter.\n\nIn 1991, while in France hosting an episode of The World's Greatest Stunts for GRB Entertainment, she met and fell madly in love with her now ex husband Gary Benz. In 1996, after finishing the pilot for Acapulco Heat, Ana Alicia made the decision to leave her acting career and invest in being a mother to her two young children Cathryn and Michael, her new passion in life.\n\nIn March 2015, having raised her children and with her youngest in college, she returned to her first love but as a producer opening up her own production company Quebrada Entertainment: its purpose is to develop scripted and unscripted film and television that reaches a culturally and demographically diverse audience across all genres through the development and execution of quality storytelling."
