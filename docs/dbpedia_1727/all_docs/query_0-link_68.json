        "text": "When Bob Woodward was writing his latest book, “Rage,” he kept a stash of Olympus digital tape recorders scattered around his Washington, D.C., rowhouse. There was one at his bedside, one in his third-floor office, one that floated between the kitchen and the den, and another always in his pocket.\n\nHe had them everywhere because he often didn’t know when President Trump would call.\n\n“It was a very unusual experience,” Mr. Woodward said in an interview. “I have to be ready to take that call at 10 o’clock at night and then say, what about George Floyd? Or what about the Supreme Court? What’s your relationship with Mitch McConnell?”\n\nIf this was an unconventional way to write a book about a sitting U.S. president, Mr. Woodward, 77, would be in a position to know. In his 50 years as a journalist, he has written 20 books and covered nine presidents. The scope and depth of his work have earned him a unique place in politics and journalism as perhaps the most enduring chronicler of American presidents. At either end of his long bibliography are two of the most divisive American presidents in generations: Richard Nixon and Mr. Trump.\n\n“There are a lot of people who have written great books, masterpieces, about individual presidents,” said Jamie Gangel, a special correspondent at CNN and a longtime friend of Mr. Woodward. “But I can’t think of anybody who has his breadth of experience.”\n\nPerhaps the biggest news out of “Rage” comes from two interviews he conducted with the president earlier this year: in February, when Mr. Trump told him that the coronavirus was “deadly stuff,” and in March, when Mr. Trump said he “wanted to always play it down” so as not to create panic.\n\nCritics have accused Mr. Woodward of holding those revelations back for his book, saying that had he decided to release the information earlier, he might have saved lives. Mr. Woodward has strenuously denied this, saying that at the time of the February call, he thought Mr. Trump was referring to what was going on in China. Believing the United States to be safe from the virus, Mr. Woodward kept traveling around the country. And by the time the call in March occurred, the president had already made an address about the pandemic from the Oval Office.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
