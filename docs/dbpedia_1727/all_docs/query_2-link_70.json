Haden after the early years in Logan Co, I finally made contact with Mark Hayden <[email protected]> who is descended from Samuel. He in turn found other descendants. The children of Samuel, birth dates, etc. and those of his son Robert H. have been handed down from Robert's daughter Frances Rebecca. A typed manuscript was found in a roll of papers behind her desk after Frances Rebecca died 25 Aug 1945 at the age of 88. The exact dates would indicate that perhaps at some time there was a Bible. Certainly these children fit into the early census data and the similarity of names would seem to add weight to the accuracy of these children and Samuel H. of Logan Co being the same as Samuel H. of Simpson Co.\n\nSamuel H. HADEN and Rebecca HARRIS were married on 30 July 1813 in Madison County, Kentucky.85,298,299 Rebecca HARRIS was born on 14 January 1792.300 She died on 4 January 1835 at the age of 42.300\n\nThe only marriage for a Samuel Haden in Logan County is to Margaret Hughes 7 Apr 1806. In \"Men Whom I Remember\" by George D. Blakey: Samuel married a \"Miss Harris\"\n\nThe Samuel that married Margaret Hughes is most probably of the Hadden line, son of Elisha, William or Thomas Hadden. The marriage is a little too early to be that of Samuel Haden.\n\nA Samuel Hayden m Rebeccah Harris 30 Jul 1813, Madison County, KY. The date given is the bond date; Robert Harris was bondsman and as father of the bride, gave consent. I first thought this was one of the Hadden descendents of the Samuel Hadden from Montgomery Co KY; one of that Samuel's sons, Nicholas Hadden, married Nancy Noland daughter of Jesse Noland and Sarah Barbara Turner in Madison Co KY.\n\nThere is one problem I have not been able to resolve. In the book, Madison County Kentucky Court Order Book B, p.131 [and not indexed], there is the following:\n\nCourt meeting 3 Nov 1795\n\nAgreeable to a writ of ad quod damnum directed to the sheriff of Madison County for the view of seat for a water griss mill for Samuel & Richard HEADEN on Muddy Creek, do report the followeth: The acres of land, the property of James Lackey, valued at 12sh and no other damages found. Signed, Edward Bullock, David McCord, Samuel South, Thomas Thorp, William Jones, Joseph Bennett, Jonathan West, James Lowry, Benjamin Baxter, Richard West, William West and John Davis.\n\nHeaden is a spelling sometimes seen for members of the Haden family. However, I find not Samuel & Richard of the age to be these men, that would have been in this location, in the Haden family. These names also do not appear in this book anywhere else. The names of Thomas Thorp & William Jones who apparently served on this \"jury\" for the viewing of the grist mill, are both associated with the Harris family.\n\nDescendants of Samuel H. say he did indeed marry Rebecca Harris. Madison Co seems to be a distance away from Logan Co where Samuel lived; however, he had Haden cousins in Madison Co - John Haden who married Rachel Reynolds and whose father Anthony Haden [the younger] was Samuel's father's older brother. The Harris family had come to Madison Co from Albemarle Co VA and could have been known to the Hadens in earlier generations. There are in fact intermarriages between the family of Anthony Haden and the Harris family.\n\nThe 1810 Madison Co KY has two men named Robert Harris. Both are 45+ One of these has no children in his household. This could be the Robert, son of Christopher Harris if his children were all grown by 1810. The other with margin note that says \"Tate's Crk\" has 2 boys -10, 1 young man 26-45, himself 45+, 1 girls -10, 2 girl 16-26 [one of these could be Rebecca], 1 lady 45+.\n\nThe biggest problem with this marriage to Rebecca Harris is that on 28 Jan 1836, Samuel H. Haden sold his land in Logan Co, and at that time his wife was listed, signed and released her dower as FRANCES Haden. The 1850 census does not have her name but has the initial \"F\". Samuel could have been married twice, or perhaps Francis was a Harris and that is not his marriage in Madison Co at all.\n\nIn at least one database online, Fanny [nickname for Frances] Harris, b. 10 Sep 1793 in Madison Co to Christopher Harris [the younger Christopher] & his wife Elizabeth Ann Grubbs, is shown as married three times - to Joseph Black, 26 Feb 1815, by whom she had three children born by 1819, to Thomas Ernest, and to Samuel \"Hayden\". The order of the marriages is not clear and I find nothing to indicate she married Thomas Ernest at all. As the widow, Frances Black, she was in Simpson Co in 1830. I do think there is an excellent possibility that Samuel married two Harris ladies. It is true that some of the granddaughters were named Rebecca Frances, using both names and some believe it was the same person - but that does not explain the death date of Rebecca in 1835, nor the fact that Frances was obviously married to Joseph Black at the time Samuel Haden's children were born.\n\nSamuel H. HADEN and Rebecca HARRIS had the following children:\n\n+448\n\ni.\n\nWilliam HADEN.\n\n+449\n\nii.\n\nRobert Harris HADEN.\n\n+450\n\niii.\n\nAnn H. \"Nancy\" HADEN.\n\n+451\n\niv.\n\nTyree Joseph HADEN.\n\n452\n\nv.\n\nBenjamin HADEN was born on 3 October 1821 in Logan County, Kentucky.300\n\n+453\n\nvi.\n\nLucy Catherine HADEN.\n\n+454\n\nvii.\n\nMary E.

HADEN was born on 19 November 1834.300 He died on 11 June 1840 at the age of 5 in Simpson County, Kentucky.300\n\nBuried Phillips Cemetery in Simpson Co. The last examination of the cemetery revealed the marker to no longer be present.\n\nSamuel H. HADEN and Frances \"Fanny\" HARRIS were married after 1835 in Simpson County, Kentucky. Frances \"Fanny\" HARRIS , daughter of Christopher HARRIS and Elizabeth GRUBBS, was born on 10 September 1793 in Madison County, Kentucky. She died on 11 November 1888 at the age of 95 in Simpson County, Kentucky.\n\nSome believe this lady to have been the wife of Samuel H. Haden, son of William and Ann Johnson Haden. It is possible she was his second wife, as I believe his first wife, Rebecca Harris, died circa 1835. It does solve the problem that they both had the Harris surname and I have found proof that Fanny was available.\n\nFanny Harris married Joseph Black, 24 Feb 1815. Christopher Harris was father of the bride and security for the bond.\n\nOnline databases show three children:\n\nMargaret \"Peggy\", b. 28 Dec 1815\n\nChristopher, b. 17 Feb 1817\n\nJoseph, b. 25 Mar 1819"
