        "text": "1915-1975\n\nLatest News: Demi Moore Plays Socialite Ann Woodward in Feud: Capote vs. The Swans\n\nDemi Moore felt a duty to “honor the truth” of Ann Woodward, the notorious starlet she portrays in , the newest season of the FX anthology series Feud. Starring Tom Hollander as Truman Capote, Feud tells the story of the author’s unfinished novel Answered Prayers and a 1975 excerpt of it in Esquire magazine that was inspired by the scandalous secrets of his real-life socialite friends, known as the “Swans.” The published essay ruined their friendships and, in Woodward’s case, might have had deadly consequences.\n\n“I think there’s great responsibility when you are stepping in to play a real person,” Moore told ABC News. “It was important to me to kind of honor the truth as much as possible. Ann lived a life that was a lot of rejection. The family rejected her that she married into. No matter how good, she never lived up to anybody’s standards. She just never fit that social stratosphere.”\n\nThe rest of the Swans are portrayed by an ensemble cast including Diane Lane, Naomi Watts, Chloë Sevigny, and Calista Flockhart.\n\nWho Was Ann Woodward?\n\nNew York City–based socialite Ann Woodward was suspected of, but never charged, in her husband’s death. Born in Kansas, she pursued acting and modeling in New York and, in 1940, was voted “The Most Beautiful Girl in Radio.” In 1943, she married William Woodward Jr., a wealthy heir and prominent member of New York society circles. However, their union became the subject of infamy. Claiming she mistook her husband for a burglar, Ann shot and killed him in October 1955. Many suspected she murdered him, though the killing was deemed an accident. Woodward died at age 59 in October 1975.\n\nQuick Facts\n\nFULL NAME: Ann Eden Woodward\n\nBORN: December 12, 1915\n\nDIED: October 10, 1975\n\nBIRTHPLACE: Pittsburg, Kansas\n\nSPOUSE: William Woodward Jr. (1943-1955)\n\nCHILDREN: William III and James\n\nASTROLOGICAL SIGN: Sagittarius\n\nEarly Life\n\nAnn Woodward was born Evangeline Crowell on December 12, 1915, in Pittsburg, Kansas. Following her parents’ divorce and remarriages, the ambitious young beauty moved to Kansas City and reinvented herself as Ann Eden. Her mother died in 1941, and Eden moved to New York City to pursue a career as a model and actor. Through ambition and hard work, she landed a contract with John Robert Powers, a modeling agency, and numerous stage and radio roles.\n\nRelationship With William Woodward Jr.\n\nWhile working as a showgirl at the New York City nightclub FeFe’s Monte Carlo, Ann met William Woodward Sr., a wealthy heir to Hanover National Bank and Belair Farm in Maryland. She was soon courted by William Woodward Jr., William’s young son who went by “Billy” and was the owner of the top-rated racehorse Nashua. The pair wed in 1943.\n\nWilliam Woodward Jr. and Ann Woodward, circa 1955\n\nAlthough she was initially shunned by high society, Ann became an adept socialite, and the couple had two sons: William III and James. Billy asked for a divorce in 1947, but Ann refused, unwilling to give up her wealth and social status.\n\nMurder Suspect and Suicide\n\nIn the fall of 1955, a string of burglaries occurred in the Woodwards neighborhood. Late on October 30, allegedly believing she heard a burglar, Ann fired her shotgun twice, killing her husband. A grand jury didn’t indict her, though speculation remains whether it was an accident or murder.\n\nAnn Woodward leaves a district attorney’s office after questioning. She fatally shot her husband, William, on October 30, 1955, but a grand jury didn’t indict her of any crimes.\n\nAfter William’s death, the door to society slammed shut for Ann. In 1975, Truman Capote published a thinly veiled account of the Woodwards’ story as part of his in-progress novel, Answered Prayers, which accused Ann of outright murder.\n\nDays before the excerpt was seen in Esquire magazine, Ann was found dead by suicide on October 10, 1975. The 59-year-old had poisoned herself with cyanide. Many believe Woodward had seen an advance copy of Capote’s writing, leading to her death.\n\nThe family tragedies continued even after Woodward’s death. Her sons eventually died by suicide as well, each jumping to their deaths on different occasions. Jimmy, the younger brother, died in 1976 and William in 1999.\n\nEditor’s Note: If you or someone you know is struggling with suicidal thoughts or self-harming behaviors, call or text 988 to get help from the 988 Suicide & Crisis Lifeline.\n\nTV Portrayals\n\nWoodward’s life has inspired various reinterpretations. Dominick Dunne wrote the 1985 novel based on her relationship with her husband and his suspicious death. It became a television miniseries two years later.\n\nIn 2024, the story of Truman Capote’s Answered Prayers and the ensuing scandal it created served as the basis for , with Demi Moore starring as Ann. It marks the second season of the FX anthology series."
