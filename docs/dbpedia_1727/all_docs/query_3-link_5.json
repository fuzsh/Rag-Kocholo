        "text": "Apologies for the lengthy title, I wasn’t sure what to call it. I wanted to share one quote that Dustin Hoffman talked about in his online Masterclass. It immediately lept out at me as a Dramatica-relevant quote about Problem Solving Style in terms of All The President’s Men.\n\nHe’s talking about meeting the real-life counterpart of his character, and the differences between the way Bernstein thought and the way Robert Redford’s Woodward thought.\n\n“He was very different from Woodward. The big difference between Woodward and Bernstein was that Woodward was very didactic. He was A-B-C-D, in saying “how far is this gonna go?”. Bernstein was not that. He would get bored. Bernstein was A-B-C-F or A-B-C-G, and he was right. He would make this intuitive jump, and that was part of his personality. And that became something that was an internal thing.”\n\nIt goes without saying that getting bored does not necessarily make a Holistic thinker. But I think Dustin recognised that Bernstein was seeing the relationships of things as a whole, making him perfectly able to make those leaps.\n\nHe mentioned something else that I thought lined up perfectly with Dramatica but I’ll have to go through my notes to figure out whatever it was.\n\nThis might be an OS solution of induction–often used in real life but rarely (never?) seen as a solution among dramatica analyses.\n\nThe transcript is from:\n\nhttps://subslikescript.com/movie/All_the_Presidents_Men-74119\n\nI just got a tip from our FBI source.\n\nThe secret cash fund financed Segretti.\n\nJesus.\n\nAll right, now, listen.\n\nChapin hired Segretti, we know that.\n\nAnd we know Haldeman hired Chapin.\n\nHaldeman has to be the fifth name\n\nto control the fund.\n\nSloan knows.\n\nWe’ve only got four of the five\n\nwho controlled the fund.\n\nIt has to be Haldeman.\n\nI don’t think we’ve got it.\n\nWe know the fifth\n\nis a top White House official.\n\nNo one has said it.\n\nNo one’s denied it.\n\nThat still doesn’t prove it was Haldeman.\n\nIf you go to bed and there’s no snow,\n\nand you wake up and there’s snow…\n\n…you can say it snowed,\n\nalthough you didn’t see it.\n\nIf we can’t prove the fifth is Haldeman,\n\nwe’re wiped out.\n\nEverything in that campaign\n\nis done with his approval.\n\nEverybody who works under Haldeman\n\ndoes so with his knowledge.\n\nEverybody is under Haldeman\n\nexcept the president.\n\nCommon sense says it’s Haldeman.\n\nIf we go and see Sloan,\n\nand we tell him that we know…\n\n…that he named Haldeman\n\nto the grand jury…\n\nThen all we would need to do\n\nis have him confirm it.\n\nHi. SLOAN: Please.\n\nWe’ve already written the story.\n\nWe just need you to define…\n\nDebbie’s in the hospital\n\nand my in-laws are…\n\nTwo questions?\n\nWe understand.\n\nTwo questions?\n\nThe cash that financed\n\nthe Watergate break-in.\n\nFive men had control of the fund.\n\nMitchell, Stans, Magruder, Kalmbach.\n\nWe have confirmations on those four.\n\nWe found out Haldeman’s the fifth.\n\nI’m not your source.\n\nAll we’re asking you to do is confirm.\n\nI’m not your source on Haldeman.\n\nWhen you were questioned\n\nby the grand jury…\n\nYou had to name names.\n\nOf course, everything they asked.\n\nAll right.\n\nWell, uh…\n\nWhat do you think?\n\nSay we wrote a story that said Haldeman\n\nwas the fifth to control the fund.\n\nWould we be in any trouble?\n\nWould we be wrong?\n\nLet me put it this way.\n\nI would have no problems\n\nif you wrote a story like that.\n\nInteresting. A quick look on Subtext shows that the 2015 crime dramedy Dope has a Solution of Induction. Meanwhile, Solution of Deduction is only Lord of the Flies and Sweet Smell of Success.\n\nThis makes me wonder: are these just not popular story themes in our culture? Is it tricky to tell this kind of story? I always feel like I understand this distinction in theory but have a hard time applying it (for example as an OS Character method).\n\nI didn’t notice Dope. It’s been on my list since it came out, but I’ll watch it ASAP.\n\nI also wonder if induction is the OS solution to every Sherlock Holmes story.\n\nI’m idly speculating that induction was the OS solution in All the President’s Men. I haven’t properly analyzed it, and even if I did I’d wager I’d be wrong. I’m still at the “everything is obtaining” stage of understanding Dramatica.\n\nI certainly agree with the relative difficulty of the methodology quad. I enjoy such stories, but when I’m deciding what to write about, I look at that quad, my eyes glaze over, and I dismiss it due to my lack of understanding all those P-words and -tions.\n\nAs far as popularity, I feel like many of these methodology stories can feel more academic. Or, more cynically, they can be popular with critics but less amenable to explosions. To paraphrase Homer Simpson, “I’ve seen plays less boring than this methodology quad story!”\n\nI wonder if it’s correlated with a feeling of “present-times anxiety.” It’s probably the least commercially popular quad, but I speculate that the quad becomes more popular in times when people tend to think less about the future & history and more about the immediate crisis. In other words, range of the moment thinking.\n\nI think this is a misunderstanding of how these are expressed in stories.\n\nLord of the Flies does not feel remotely academic.\n\nA teenager rebelling and joining a group of friends their parents don’t like wouldn’t feel remotely academic. (Problem, Deduction: “you’ll get nowhere with a bunch of druggie friends”, Solution: Induction, “These people are happy and when I join them, I’ll be happy too.”)\n\nI was also going to mention The Princess Bride and The LEGO Movie! These don’t involve Deduction/Induction that I recall, but other pairs like Probability/Possibility and Certainty/Potentiality.\n\nOne thing I’ve found with some of the more complicated-sounding elements is that, at least when using them as the PRCO elements of a scene, they sometimes come out SUPER simple. It’s actually kind of cool learning experience seeing how simple these can be:\n\nInduction: I had a scene where the conflict was trying to figure out why this big alert had gone out, and this was resolved by inferring something like “well, a message came right before the alert, so that was probably it”. Being more scientific minded myself, I remember finding it weird that my characters seemed satisfied with that. But it definitely felt like it worked in the scene, so I left it. Only on revision did I analyze the scene’s quad and realize that was an Induction beat.\n\nDeduction: “Sorry, you can’t help with this; it’s club business and you’re not a member”"
