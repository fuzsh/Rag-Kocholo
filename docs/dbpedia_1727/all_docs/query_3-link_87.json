        "text": "TOM McNAUGHT: Good evening. I'm Tom McNaught, Executive Director of the Kennedy Library Foundation, and on behalf of Tom Putnam, Director of the John F. Kennedy Presidential Library and Museum, and all of our Library and Foundation colleagues, I welcome you all this evening. Let me begin by acknowledging the generous underwriters of the Kennedy Library Forums: lead sponsor Bank of America, Raytheon, Boston Capital, the Lowell Institute, the Boston Foundation; and our media partners, The Boston Globe, Xfinity and WBUR.\n\nI also want to thank and acknowledge Ira Jackson, the Dean of the McCormack Graduate School of Policy and Global Studies at the University of Massachusetts-Boston, with whom we are very proud to collaborate on tonight's Forum.\n\nIn remarks delivered at Amherst College shortly before his death, President Kennedy said, and I quote, \"A nation reveals itself not only by the men it produces, but also by the men it honors and the men it remembers.\" And so this evening we both honor and remember a truly great man and a great American, the late Congressman Joe Moakley.\n\nCongressman Moakley, as you know, served as a State Representative, a State Senator, a City Councilor, and a member of Congress. Over those years, he built his skills and reputation as a \"bread-and-butter politician.\" He was a good friend of the Kennedy Library and the Kennedy family.\n\nIn March 2001, the Kennedy Library Foundation and Senator Kennedy presented Joe Moakley with the John F. Kennedy Distinguished American Award at a ceremony in celebration of Joe's life right here in this room. During the ceremony, Senator Kennedy described Joe as \"a voice for the voiceless,\" which I think is a perfect description. That same year, the Kennedy Library created the Joe Moakley Public Speaking Institute, which is a nine-day summer program for 25 urban students from disadvantaged backgrounds that help them improve self-confidence and speaking ability. The program continues today.\n\nIn South Boston, we have the John Joseph Moakley Federal Courthouse and the Joe Moakley Park. But for those who don't know of Joe Moakley – and looking at this audience, I'd suspect most of you do – and for those who don't have a living memory of this incredible man of the people, then these parks and courthouses and programs have about as much meaning as the names the Callahan Tunnel or the Sumner Tunnel.\n\nFortunately, his contribution to our city and the country and the world has been chronicled for future generations, thanks to our guests: Historian Mark Robert Schneider, who has written this wonderful biography, Joe Moakley's Journey: From South Boston to El Salvador. Mark is an adjunct professor of history at Suffolk University in Boston and author of several books, including African Americans in the Jazz Age; The Civil Rights Movement in the Jazz Age; and Boston Confronts Jim Crow: 1890 to 1920. He received his Master's in American history from next door, our wonderful neighbor UMass-Boston, and his PhD in American history from Boston College.\n\nWe are delighted and grateful to Mark, both for being here with us this evening, but also for documenting the contributions of Congressman Moakley. Joe Moakley's Journey: From South Boston to El Salvador is on sale in our Museum store, and we are fortunate that Mark has agreed to sign the books for those of you who would like your book autographed. Mark, welcome. [applause]\n\nJoining Mark this evening is Congressman Jim McGovern, the US Representative for the Massachusetts Second Congressional District and a friend, protégé and former senior aide for Joe Moakley. Jim first became involved in politics in junior high school when he campaigned for Democratic US Senator George McGovern in his unsuccessful 1972 Presidential bid. You will all remember, \"Don't blame me, I'm from Massachusetts.\" That George McGovern. [applause] When George McGovern ran again for President in 1984, Jim McGovern was a state coordinator for Massachusetts and made Senator McGovern's nominating speech at the 1984 Democratic National Convention.\n\nBefore his election to Congress in 1996, Jim spent 14 years working as a senior aide for Joe Moakley. During this time, Jim was the lead investigator of the Moakley Commission, the Congressional investigation into the murders of six Jesuit priests, their housekeeper and her daughter in El Salvador in 1989.\n\nSince his election in 1996, Jim McGovern has been widely recognized as a tenacious advocate for his district, a tireless crusader for change and unrivaled supporter for social justice and fundamental human rights. Currently serving his ninth term in Congress, Jim serves on the powerful House Rules Committee and on the House Agricultural Committee.\n\nPolitical interest groups generally rank Jim McGovern as one of the most liberal members of Congress. \"It's not secret that I'm a liberal,\" Jim said in 2010, \"I didn't pull any of this stuff. But I am who I am.\" So, like Joe Moakley, Jim McGovern is in good company. Here's how John F. Kennedy described being a liberal: \"If by a Liberal our opponents mean someone who looks ahead and not behind, someone who welcomes new ideas without rigid reactions, someone who cares about the welfare of the people – their health, their housing, their schools, their jobs, their civil rights and their civil liberties – someone who believes we can break through the stalemate and suspicions that grip us in our policies abroad, if that is what they mean by a Liberal, then I'm proud to say I'm a Liberal.\"\n\nSo I think we're all in proud company, and we're all very proud of our Congressman, Jim McGovern. [applause]\n\nOur moderator tonight is one of our favorite moderators here, Kevin Cullen, a Pulitzer Prize- winning journalist who has written for The Boston Globe since 1985. Kevin has worked as the newspaper's law enforcement reporter, legal affairs correspondent, and as a reporter-at-large. In 1977, Kevin moved to Ireland to open the Globe's Dublin bureau, and he was the only staff reporter for an American newspaper to cover the Irish peace process full time in the years leading up the Good Friday Agreement. In 1998, Kevin was appointed the Globe's London bureau chief and European correspondent and spent much of the next three years in the Balkans covering the war in former Yugoslavia. He was a member of the 2003 investigative team that won a Pulitzer Prize for coverage of the Catholic Church's sexual abuse scandal. A Boston native, he graduated from the University of Massachusetts, attended Trinity College in Dublin, and was a 2003 Nieman Fellow at Harvard University. One of our favorite columnists for The Boston Globe's Metro section, Kevin is most recently coauthor of the New York Times bestseller, Whitey Bulger: America's Most Wanted Gangster and the Manhunt that Brought Him to Justice.\n\nPlease join me in welcoming our panelists, Mark Schneider, Jim McGovern and Kevin Cullen. [applause]\n\nNow, it is my privilege to introduce Ira Jackson. Ira was appointed the Dean of the John W. McCormack Graduate School of Policy and Global Studies at the University of Massachusetts- Boston in January of this year. From 1987 to 1999, Ira was Executive Vice President of Bank Boston. Remember Bank Boston? He previously worked in government, where from 1983 to '87, he served as Michael Dukakis's Commissioner of Revenue and was previously Chief of Staff for Boston Mayor Kevin White. Since then, he has had a distinguished history of public service. He has held a variety of positions at the John F. Kennedy School of Government, and we are delighted to collaborate with the John W. McCormack Graduate School of Policy and Global Studies on this Forum tonight.\n\nPlease join me in welcoming Ira Jackson. [applause]\n\nIRA JACKSON: Thank you very much, Tom. Good evening, everyone. I know you're anxious, as I am, to hear from this incredible panel, and I'm going to spare you remarks about my school and our collaboration. But Tom mentioned President Kennedy and invoked his words about how important it is for us to honor and remember our heroes, and I'm privileged to report that there's a faculty member at my school who not only honors and remembers Joe Moakley, but who puts his values to work every day, as Jim McGovern does. I just received a telegram from Padraig O'Malley, the John Joseph Moakley Chair in Peace and Reconciliation at the John W. McCormack Graduate School at UMass-Boston, and with your permission, I thought I'd read at least half of it:\n\nDear friends and colleagues, and the many who are gathered here this evening to remember Joe, to honor his legacy and to discuss Mark Schneider's wonderful biography, Joe Moakley's Journey: From South Boston to El Salvador: I deeply regret that I cannot join you as I am in Kaduna, Nigeria, a city divided along Christian/Muslim lines where the two communities live apart and are frequently in violent confrontation with each other, resulting in the massacres of hundreds in the space of a few days. I am here doing the work Joe would have wanted me to do, work that is part of his living legacy.\n\nWhere to begin? Perhaps with the last few weeks of his life, when I had the opportunity to spend quite some time with Joe, thanks to Fred Clark [who's with us tonight], making sure that Joe could always make time to see me. We talked about life and death, of the horrors of war, roads to peace, and watched at least, on a couple of occasions, Frontline's documentary about how the execution of 12 Jesuits and a nun led to Joe's investigation, his indefatigable efforts to find the truth and identify their murderers and see that justice was done.\n\nNo small assignment, but an assignment tailor-made for a man of Joe's caliber, of his perseverance in the face of the innumerable obstacles the Salvadoran government created, and his persistence, despite setbacks and the government doing its damnedest to get him out of its way. Joe, of course you know, identified the perpetrators, the complicity of the Salvadoran government, Congress subsequently cutting aid to the Salvadoran government, opening the way for a negotiated settlement.\n\nAnd where to end? Here in conflict-ridden Nigeria, where the Christian/Muslim divide has resulted in the senseless murder of thousands, Christians killing Muslims, Muslims killing Christians, where any spark can ignite a frenzy of killing that feeds on itself, and where the John Joseph Moakley Chair of Peace and Reconciliation has immersed itself as part of a larger project for ways to alleviate the conflict and foster reconciliation between the two communities.\n\nI met Joe for the first time in February 1972 to ask him to join a group of us who had established the Committee for an Irish Forum to help raise funds to assist the families of the victims of Bloody Sunday-31 January 1972, when British paratroopers shot dead 14 civilians in the course of a nonviolent civil rights march in Derry, Northern Ireland. Not only did Joe immediately put his name, the first to the list of patrons, but escorted us to the office of every city council member and had each of them add his name to the list. It was the beginning of a 30-year relationship.\n\nIn Washington, DC, Joe's rise was meteoric, thanks in part to his pal, Tip, Speaker of the House, and at the time of his death he was among the three or four most powerful members of Congress. But Joe did not covet power and privilege. His constituents were his family: their concerns, his concerns; their problems, his problems. He never forgot he was a servant to the people; public service was a privilege. He was always accessible to the poor, the people at the bottom of the heap, those with little opportunity, who had to grind out their existence on a day-to-day basis. He treated them with respect and dignity and, above all, listened, giving meaning to their lives despite their impoverishment. He could have mixed it up in Washington with the bigwigs, but he chose the road that led him to cherish the forgotten. Equality for all were not words for him, but a call to action. And he ensured that the legislation that reached the floor of the House was legislation that would benefit the bottom 1%.\n\nYou'll hear much this evening -- or have heard -- of his extraordinary street smarts, how he deployed them so effectively in El Salvador; of his intuitive judgment, how he held hard to the truth once he had unearthed it in El Salvador, even though his government did not like the truth he found; his mentoring of Jim McGovern, who accompanied him on numerous trips to El Salvador and was his second set of eyes; his treating Fred Clark as a son; of his love of song and laughter and not adverse to a couple of belts of whiskey – perhaps more if the occasion demanded it; of his gift for spontaneous connection; his being not just for the people, but with the people.\n\nHe carried the vision of making things better for others with him every day. He never forgot that the people he met – and they were many – were as close to God as he would ever get on this earth. He understood conflict, that human beings begin conflicts and that only human beings can end them. He had a special place for the young, because they were the future, and it was our responsibility to prepare them to meet the challenges we fail to meet. He had no illusions about peace. It was something brittle, overused. And in conflicts like Northern Ireland, the beginning of a process of recovery and healing that left unattended, if not nourished, could reignite into conflict.\n\nHe humbled me when shortly before his death, he suggested establishing a Chair in Peace and Reconciliation at the University of Massachusetts-Boston, in his name, provided I would hold it. I hope I have not let him down, that I have lived up to the great trust he placed in me. The Chair now works, at least at last count, in cities emerging from conflict in 21 countries. The Chair brings divided societies, especially cities emerging from devastating conflicts, together every year in a different city, has them share the narratives of their conflicts and discover the commonalities that bond them, enabling them to work together; that by helping other cities emerging from communal conflict and struggling on the lower rungs of transition to reconciliation they help themselves.\n\nIf, God willing, all goes well, we will bring 14 divided cities from four continents to Kaduna in northern Nigeria this coming November, where they will be joined by six other Nigerian cities where Christian/Muslim divides result periodically in bouts of mass killing, and seven cities from other African countries. We make them work, make commitments they must keep, or be expelled from the group.\n\nEverything is about outcomes, not stated as possible, but outcomes that are implemented.\n\nI believe Joe would approve. His legacy is a living legacy. It will find no resting place. Wherever I go and hand out a card, I am handing out his name, and people from as diverse places as Kirkuk, Ramallah, Jerusalem, Sarajevo, Mitrovica will ask, “Who is Joe Moakley?” And I share some of the life of an extraordinary man blessed to accomplish the extraordinary.\n\nThank you Joe. [applause]\n\nAnd thank you, Kevin, the floor is yours.\n\nKEVIN CULLEN: I'm going to break protocol and get out of the chair, and let the focus be on these two gentlemen here. And just a point of order: I would like to point out that, from your perspective looking up here, this is the first and only time you will see The Boston Globe to the left of Jim McGovern. [laughter]\n\nWe are going to get to Salvador, but the road starts in Southie. It starts in the Old Harbor Project. I guess I'll start with you, Mark, because I think before we get to Salvador, we have to discuss what, for lack of a better term, is the political education of Joe Moakley. He grew up in an era of constituent service politicians. He grew up when a guy like Jimmy Condon got as many votes for taking kids down to the farm in Easton as he did delivering whatever he delivered to the Project back then. And Joe learned politics in a certain way.\n\nThe one thing I remember, just personally, when I was a young reporter – I had left the Herald and gone to the Globe and he made some remark about lace curtain-something. He actually mentioned that … I didn't know how he knew this, but I know he knew my mother. My mother's family are all from East Second Street, between L and K. And he mentioned to me, I think I was 25 at the time, he says, \"Our grandmothers had the same name.\" I said, \"My grandmother was a Bridget Connolly.\" And he goes, \"I know, so was yours.\" And I said, \"How the hell did Joe Moakley know that my grandmother was Bridget Connolly from Carraroe in Galway?\" But he did, and that's why he was a great politician.\n\nBut the other thing I'll always remember is my family would gather, as they still do to this day, on East Broadway for the parade. My aunts and my mother would sit there and tell the exact same stories every single year. I remember going in to get one of those green, awful cupcakes – I would take three of them and go sit and watch the parade as a teenager. I heard my Aunt May saying– they were talking about Moakley, and they were talking about everything. This was in the middle or just after busing, and they were talking about the way Joe handled it, and my Aunt May said, \"Joe's father was a politician and that's why he did it the way he did it.\" And my mother said, \"No, his father owned a barroom.\" And my Aunt May said, \"What's the difference?\" [laughter]\n\nBut Mark, talk a little about that. Joe learned at the feet of masters.\n\nMARK SCHNEIDER: Well, first of all, thanks to the Kennedy Library and that wonderful introduction. It's Tom, right, who introduced us, right? Okay. And thank all of you for coming. Some of my jazz musician friends are here; as we say in jazz, without the audience there's no music. So, really, thanks for coming.\n\nThe broad currents that shaped Joe Moakley are not with us very much anymore. First of all, it was the Depression and the New Deal. So Joe Moakley knew in his bones, from his lived-life experience, that government helped the poor and made really concrete differences to people in their lives. For him, moving to a housing project was a huge step up. He had not lived in an apartment before that really had heat.\n\nSo that was one aspect of Joe Moakley's early education in South Boston. He knew that the architect of that was his Congressman, at some point in his childhood, John W. McCormack. That's one element of what Joe Moakley really knew in his bones that very few people left in the Congress have really experienced in their lived life.\n\nNow, the other one is the one you alluded to; it's the immigrant experience. When I began this project, I thought Joe Moakley was a typical Irish Boston Southie politician, but on his mother's side of the family they were Italian. They were Northern Italian, which separated them from the great body of most Italian Americans who come from Sicily or Naples. So they wound up in South Boston.\n\nHis parents represented a unique marriage. They were married just nine months before Joe was born. They were in their very early 20s. A couple years into the marriage, after the third son was born, the father effectively left the family, although he stayed connected. So Joe Moakley grew up with his Italian grandmother who didn't speak English in the house. I suspect that this helped him to appreciate the dilemmas that immigrants face in the United States.\n\nKEVIN CULLEN: It's funny, when Italians and Irish married in Southie, they called that a mixed marriage.\n\nMARK SCHNEIDER: Exactly.\n\nKEVIN CULLEN: They really did. [laughter] Jim, I'm curious, when you started working for Joe, did he relate the sort of political education that he had? Did he talk about that to you? Did it matter?\n\nJIM MCGOVERN: No, he did. He did a lot. He talked about growing up in South Boston. He talked about the values that were instilled in him. In fact, one time he was asked, \"Why have you become such a champion for human rights? Why do you care what happens to poor people in El Salvador or poor people halfway around the world?\" And he said, \"I've always hated bullies.\"\n\nAnd he related the story, when he was a young boy and his father was driving with him down the road, and the father brought the car to a halt and pointed out two kids that were fighting, and he said, \"What do you see over there, Joe?\" He said, \"I see two kids fighting.\" He says, \"Look a little closer. What do you see?\" He said, \"I see a big kid really knocking the hell out of a little kid.\" He says, \"And what are you going to do about it?\" He says, \"What do you mean? I don't know any of the kids.\" He says, \"Even the fight out.\" And he said, \"I had to get out and I evened the fight.\" He said, \"But I've always hated bullies. I've always hated when big, powerful people pick on people who don't have that power, who are vulnerable.\" I think whether it was in South Boston or in San Salvador, that was something that he learned growing up. And he took it to heart, and it really was a guiding principle throughout a great part of his career.\n\nHe talked about his father being Irish, his mother being Italian. He used to say it was Gaelic and garlic. [laughter] That's how he described it. And all the characters that he grew up with, and he loved South Boston, he really loved that community. I think he always lived in the same ward and precinct his entire life. A lot of good stories.\n\nKEVIN CULLEN: I'll just point out that the garlic side cooked much better. [laughter] I'll throw this out to both of you because I think when you look at it, John McCormack spawned a generation of politicians from South Boston. And if you had to pick three that came after the McCormack era and sort of emerged from South Boston, or didn't emerge as the case may be, you'd have to talk about Joe, you'd have to talk about Bill Bulger, you'd have to talk about Ray Flynn. And in some ways they were forged in the cauldron that was busing.\n\nAnd each one of them took a different path. You could argue that Bill Bulger's path limited anywhere he could go beyond South Boston. Ray Flynn, particularly down the road, changed his views on a lot of things, which allowed him to become the Mayor of Boston. But if you look at Joe Moakley's path, it was curiously quiet; I guess a generous term would be diplomatic. The other term -- and I heard it in Southie as a kid -- is that Joe Moakley wouldn't take a stand.\n\nSo I'd like you both to go in on that. Was Joe Moakley -- the idea that this is a no-win in my hometown -- he didn't want to side with haters, obviously, because he wasn't one of them, but at the same time I got the sense that Joe Moakley did not think busing worked at any level.\n\nMARK SCHNEIDER: Let me start off with the question of the path that these three representative South Boston politicians took. Moakley was a legislator all his life. I've often wondered what happens in politics that makes some people decide that that's really who they are and what they're going to do. I think Moakley had a great skill as a negotiator, and I think that that probably had something to do with the way he chose his political path. Sometimes these are dictated by what office is open when. But it seemed appropriate to me that he served in the House of Representatives here, in the State Senate and in the Congress. Those jobs I think fit his abilities.\n\nNow let's turn to the busing question. Are we going to get to the election, how he got elected to Congress? Will we go back to that?\n\nKEVIN CULLEN: Sure.\n\nMARK SCHNEIDER: This was a case, it seems to me, where the gods decide to punish you: They give you what you want. Moakley had run for Congress twice. He lost to Louise Day Hicks\n\nin 1970; he won in 1972, and it's immediately right after this that the busing crisis exploded in Boston in the 1974 school year.\n\nMoakley was caught in the middle. I had initially titled the chapter in the book that's called \"The Man on the Barbed Wire Fence,\" my initial working title for that was \"The Man Who Wasn't There.\" Moakley deliberately kept a very low profile during the busing crisis. On the one hand, he very much believed in the neighborhood school as a value. He felt that the neighborhood school represented the value of community, that that was an important value that middle class people did not necessarily understand, like the Judge. In Moakley's view, it was more valuable to maintain the community school as a center in which people organized their lives around and that had a value in and of itself. And so that was one part of the way this looked to Moakley.\n\nHe never, however, joined the side of people who advocated breaking the law, and certainly was not part of the haters who were the second wave of the antibusing forces. In the early wave, I would say, people like Ray Flynn, Hicks, William Bulger were somewhat looking for some kind of way around this without deliberately encouraging mob violence. But they very quickly gave way to the next wave of people around the South Boston Information Center, who were the people organizing the rock throwing at the school buses and the racist chanting. And those people gave it to Moakley, too. So Moakley was kind of caught in the middle between these two camps.\n\nNow, his public presentation of this was, \"As a US Congressman, it's inappropriate for me to be involved at the neighborhood level on this kind of question because my constituents, who included Roxbury, are on two sides of the question.\" What he did do was promote – and this is the place in the book where I'm the most critical of Moakley – he promoted a constitutional amendment to ban busing. This seemed to me to be disingenuous. And the Globe reporter, when the Globe had a Washington bureau, smelled this out as well.\n\nFirst of all, the United States Constitution doesn't do well when it attempts to prescribe policies. The one time we really did this was with Prohibition, and we had to get rid of that 14 years later. It's a process document, and the idea of prescribing a one-size-fits-all solution that no city in the United States may institute school busing seems to me to be really a rather bad idea.\n\nIn addition, Moakley knew that this had no chance of passing. The chairman of the Judiciary Committee was Peter Rodino, who represented an all-black district virtually in Newark, New Jersey. And there was no way Rodino could have been reelected if this had gotten out of committee. Not to mention that a constitutional amendment has to be approved by the states, and the states were not going to, except for the Southern ones. It put Moakley in the worst company he was in in all of his political life. He was aligned with Southern Congressmen.\n\nI think he was emotionally very deeply torn. One of his friends, John \"Sleepy\" Lynch, said he looked like he was having a nervous breakdown. One of the reasons it was easy to write this book was that Moakley and his colleagues were interviewed, due to the good offices of the Moakley Foundation represented here. And Joe gave an interview three months before he died in which he kind of reprised the themes of his life, and he just seemed the most conflicted when describing this very difficult period of his life.\n\nKEVIN CULLEN: Did he talk to you about that, Jim?\n\nJIM MCGOVERN: He didn't talk a lot to me about the whole busing situation. The times he did, he reflected on it this way: by saying it was the worst period of his life. He saw friends of his that he grew up with protesting on his front lawn that he wasn't antibusing enough. And people that he thought were allies and people who he really treasured their friendship were all of a sudden against him. And I think he genuinely was conflicted. By nature, he's kind of the fixer. You bring him in when there's a conflict and he brings everybody together and he works everything out. That's his career. And I don't think he knew how to fix this.\n\nI don't think he believed in his heart that maybe busing was the answer; on the other hand, I think he resented the fact that some of the antibusing forces took on these racial overtones. I guess, that really made him feel terrible. He knew what they were doing was wrong, he knew the violence was wrong. But when he talked about that chapter of his life to me, he said, of all the things that happened, it was the worst period of his life. In fact, he lost South Boston in [simultaneous conversation]. And that really bothered him because that's his home; those are his people and they didn't support him. So it bothered him terribly.\n\nMARK SCHNEIDER: I'd like to add, too, he never took on board the concerns of the black community during this period. One of the interviews I did for the book was with Mel King. Mel King wasn't a big integrationist himself. There were elements in the black community who by the middle of the 1970s were beginning to have a lot of second thoughts about busing their children. King just seemed kind of befuddled as to why Moakley was an important person. And I had to remind him about El Salvador and he was, \"Oh, right, yeah.\" It was just at that period of his life, I don't think he really fully got the initial impulse toward integration. To me, the great hero of that story was Ruth Batson who envisioned a kind of desegregated city. The first goal was not busing; it was desegregation by shifting some school boundaries and assignments.\n\nKEVIN CULLEN: Going back to that paradigm of the three pols that come out of Southie post-McCormack era, it's noticeable to me that both Ray Flynn and Joe Moakley sought international issues and sought a stage way beyond South Boston. And Bill Bulger did not, or could not. And one thing, when I look back there, in terms of the influences on staff -- and this comes back to you, Jim -- is that Ray Flynn had a Ray Dooley, he had a Neil Sullivan. He had a younger corps of advisors who were pushing him beyond City Point, beyond the Lower End, and to look elsewhere. I get the sense that you might have played a very similar role, and Fred Clark may have played a very similar role. Does that hold water to you?\n\nJIM MCGOVERN: Look, Moakley had a great staff. Some of them are here tonight -- Fred Clark, Bill Shaevel. I hate to mention names because I didn't see everybody that came in here. But he had a great staff. For some of us who started with him, at least speaking for myself, I was out of college and I was an activist and I was an advocate, and I wanted to change the world. I figured I'd get into working for this guy who everybody says is a real mover and shaker in Washington who's got a good position on the Rules Committee, and I could advocate from within and urge him to do this and urge him to do that, and that's how we're going to change things. Much to my surprise, when I started working for Moakley, he was very receptive to that. I mean, sometimes he'd say, \"You're crazy, please leave.\" But most of the time, he'd go with it.\n\nI think he cared about a lot of the things that I cared about, and a lot of the other people on his staff cared about. He used to say, \"I don't have all the answers. I don't have all the ideas. Come to me with a good idea. If it's a good idea, we'll go with it. If I think it's a stupid idea, I'll tell you.\" So working for him was, for me, kind of this educational experience, not only because I had the opportunity to be working in Congress, but I get to see how you shape things, how staff are important. Ultimately, he was the decider, and if he didn't agree with me, he wasn't going to do it. But he encouraged us to \"go out and help me figure out what I ought to be doing.\" He understood a seat in Congress was a privilege. It was something that you had to treat with respect and that it was a place to actually make a difference and to help people.\n\nAnd to just kind of go back to stories he used to talk about growing up. One of the things he always used to say to me was, \"When I was growing up, the politician was revered. The politician was who you went to if your kid needed a job. The politician was who you went to when you couldn't afford a turkey for Thanksgiving. Politics was viewed as an honorable, important profession. And I think he held to that all throughout his career. Working with him, you really did feel politics was honorable, that it was good, and it was about good things. And it was also fun. He had a great sense of humor. Some crazy things happened. It was a lot of fun as well; I enjoyed every moment working for him.\n\nHe had a profound influence on me. So I wouldn't have run for office if I hadn't had that experience working in his office.\n\nKEVIN CULLEN: Mark, did it go that way for you? Did he learn at the feet of the old ward boss and then evolve at the feet of the young Turk?\n\nMARK SCHNEIDER: Well, I don't know about learning at the feet of the old ward bosses. It's true, his political career began in the age of Curley; he was coming up as Curley was flaming out. But I think he was inspired by Jack Kennedy. The Kennedys and McCormacks, a great rivalry. Both of those influences are there.\n\nJIM MCGOVERN: Didn't he announce for Congress under the picture?\n\nMARK SCHNEIDER: Yes, he did, yeah.\n\nJIM MCGOVERN: Right under Jack Kennedy's picture.\n\nMARK SCHNEIDER: Yeah.\n\nKEVIN CULLEN: But how do we go from Southie to Salvador. I'd like you both to kind of explain where you saw that process that generated. How did Joe Moakley go from being the sort of consummate constituent services Congressman to taking on something that was so far away from South Boston?\n\nMARK SCHNEIDER: You want me to start?\n\nJIM MCGOVERN: You go ahead.\n\nMARK SCHNEIDER: Because you were on the other end of the phone call.\n\nJIM MCGOVERN: Okay.\n\nMARK SCHNEIDER: Without El Salvador, there's no book about Joe Moakley. What drew me to this story was that this was a story. It's a biography. It's got a narrative arc about a man who grows throughout the course of his life. And that's what made it kind of dramatic.\n\nWhen I first started researching the book, I went up to the Moakley archive and I saw there were a couple of books. There was one about Claude Pepper and one about Rostenkowski. And I thought, “Oh, my god, what am I getting myself into? This is where books go to die.” [laughter] But with Moakley, there's a story with an arc, and El Salvador is where the story starts to change and get really dramatic. In January of 1983, activists of the type like Bill de Blasio came into Moakley's office, his constituents from Jamaica Plain, and asked him to speak out on the El Salvador issue.\n\nThe Democratic Party at that point was divided on El Salvador. Reagan was pushing military aid in the hundreds of millions of dollars – some of that was economic, the smaller figures were military – to a truly murderous regime, which by 1983 had killed tens of thousands of people already, including the one that's famous: it was the murder of the Archbishop in March of 1980, followed by, immediately after the election of Reagan, six leaders of the opposition. Their tortured bodies were found on the street one week after Reagan won the election. The next month, the four churchwomen, the four American churchwomen were killed. And then after that, the two labor advisors, all Americans. And then this bloodbath was really, really on.\n\nNow, the prominent spokesperson in Massachusetts for ending all aid was Gerry Studds. But the Democratic Party was divided on this issue. Tip O'Neill had to pick his fights; this wasn't the one he was going to pick. The big fight with Reagan was going to be on budgetary matters. And Moakley was not publicly prominent on this issue.\n\nBut with these activists in front of him, off their list of things to do, he -- on his own initiative -- picked out that he wanted to work on the problem of the Salvadoran immigrants who were flooding into those United States, running away from the war. It was called extended voluntary departure. He didn't know what it was, and neither did the people in his office.\n\nSo he called Jim. And then what happened?\n\nJIM MCGOVERN: So I was working for him, I was going to every protest against all military aid in El Salvador, unbeknownst to him, that you could possibly imagine. So he calls me up and says, \"I'm meeting with the Jamaica Plain Committee on Central America. They're telling me that there are hundreds if not thousands of Salvadorans in Massachusetts, tens of thousands that are living in the United States, technically here illegally, they're all fleeing from the violence and that our government is deporting them back to the violence. Can you find out if that's true?\"\n\nSo I found out, yeah, it is true. We're deporting them. He says, \"Is it really that violent down in El Salvador? Why don't you go to El Salvador and check it out for me?\" [laughter] And I was like, \"Yeah, this is what I've been waiting for!\" So he sent me. And I spent two weeks just kind of going around on my own, which was not a smart thing to do. But nonetheless, got a real flavor of what was going on and during that trip got to meet with the Jesuits at the University of Central America, including the rector, Father Ignacio Ellacuria. I remember we were supposed to meet at a restaurant and he called to change the plans because he had been threatened and was worried about my safety and thought we should meet at the University, which we did. And I met with two other of the Jesuits who – this was in the early '80s – in 1989 they were all murdered.\n\nI came back and I said, \"Look, it's as bad as they say it is.\" He says, \"Well, what are we going to do about it?\" I said, \"Well, we can put legislation together and you can …\" First, we wrote to the Attorney General; then he didn't help out. We put legislation together and he began this kind of crusade to stop the deportation of Salvadoran refugees. He started to meet some of the people, some of the refugees that were here, and listen to their stories. He couldn't believe that the United States of America would send somebody back into a situation where they might be murdered.\n\nAnd he heard firsthand about the stories of torture, of rape, of disappearances, and he was horrified by it.\n\nSo he said, \"I'm going to help you out. My constituents want it. The Jamaica Plain Committee on Central America want it. I'm going to help them out. And I'm telling you, I'm going to work to protect you.\" And that began a multiyear kind of crusade to pass legislation to stop the deportation of Salvadoran refugees.\n\nKEVIN CULLEN: I'm curious, if you go back to that era, there were enormous civil rights violations in Northern Ireland, and it was very common for someone with a name like Joe Moakley to gravitate towards that issue. Now, I know that Padraig gave tribute to Joe on his involvement at some level with Northern Ireland, but when you go through the list of politicians that took a great interest in Northern Ireland, Joe Moakley is really not on that list. And yet, I would say I guess electorally, politically, wouldn't it have made more sense for him to embrace the Irish issue as opposed to the Salvadoran issue?\n\nMARK SCHNEIDER: Absolutely, politically, absolutely.\n\nJIM MCGOVERN: Yeah, politically.\n\nMARK SCHNEIDER: In fact, at one of the crucial moments, he was ready to stuff or turn off, with this powers of the Rules Committee, one of the immigration bills from passing unless it included the protection for the Salvadoran immigrants. And ultimately – it took eight years – ultimately he got the bill passed, but he had a …\n\nJIM MCGOVERN: In a showdown. Basically, Moakley passed his bill to stop the deportation of Salvadoran refugees twice. The first time it didn't go anywhere other than the House; the second time it was on the immigration bill, and he got on the conference committee. And the only piece of this massive immigration bill that he had an interest in was his little part on the Salvadoran refugees.\n\nBut he went every day and he sat through all the meetings on every item of the immigration bill. And Alan Simpson was the Republican who was kind of leading negotiations on the Senate bill. And it finally got to the end, and it was Moakley's provision and Simpson said, \"No, we're not going to do this.\" And he said, \"Well, then, if you're not going to do it, I'm the chairman of the Rules Committee and this bill will never go to the House floor. I'm just telling you that.\" So then Simpson came back and said, \"But we have this generous visa program for the Irish in this bill.\" And Moakley said, \"That's great, I'm all for that.\" And he said, \"But you're going to risk all of that?\" He said, \"Well, as far as I know, the people we're deporting back to Dublin aren't getting shot for political reasons. They're not being murdered because they're teachers or they're unionists, or because they're priests.\"\n\nIn El Salvador, there was a common kind of slogan – be a patriot and kill a priest. And so he said, \"Look, I want to help everybody. But this is my second time at bat and this is the only way we're going to get this. So you either put this on the immigration bill or there'll be no immigration bill, and it's that simple.\" Then some negotiations went on, and finally everybody … There was a little bit of a compromise that was reached and they agreed to keep it in. So the Irish got their visas and the Salvadorans got their reprieve from deportation and everybody was happy.\n\nBut I think Mark's right about one thing; I mean, Moakley was willing to risk this provision that provided some generous visas for the Irish. In fact, I remember we got some calls from some prominent leaders of Irish-descent businesspeople in Massachusetts who called to ask him to back off. And he said, \"Absolutely not, absolutely not.\" He just stood his ground. And it happened and as a result, hundreds of thousands of Salvadorans got a temporary reprieve, and many of them have now become citizens of this country. And if not for that, they risked deportation and even death.\n\nKEVIN CULLEN: Mark, one of the most fascinating things I read in your book was your thesis that one of the reasons Joe Moakley identified so strongly with what the ordinary Salvadoran was going through is that he kind of witnessed the same phenomenon in South Boston, that there was this sort of exceptionalism that the Salvadoran military and the Salvadoran elite believed that everything would be just hunky-dory if we could deal with this element. And deal with them meant to eliminate them. Could you explain what you wrote about that, in that passage, about South Boston, his experience in South Boston, including some of the stuff that grew out of the Bulger case, and how that shaped his view.\n\nMARK SCHNEIDER: Moakley made four important contributions to El Salvador. One of them had to do with the immigrants. The second one had to do with justice in the Jesuit murder case. The Jesuit priests at the University of Central America were the prominent spokespeople for a negotiated solution to the war. By 1989, the conservative party, ARENA, was divided between its hardline military wing that was ready to kill anybody to win a military victory, and its business class which was starting to now look for a way out. In November of 1989, there was a final offensive by the guerillas, whose purpose was to force the negotiations further. The guerillas knew that they couldn't win either. And right around that time, the Berlin Wall came down and in that context, the hardliners decided that – just because they could do it, it served no purpose – they would kill their enemies, the Jesuit priests.\n\nGerry Studds went to Speaker of the House Tom Foley and arranged for Moakley to be the leader of the House Monitoring Committee, which was bipartisan. It was the Speaker's committee, but Republicans accompanied Moakley on the trip that Jim really labored heroically on. It's these two guys who effectively, I think, cracked that case. But Moakley perceived on his first trip to El Salvador, when he faced the generals face-to-face for the first time, that this was a closed circle of people who believed that whatever they did was right and that the outside world didn't understand them. They were the victims here. They were the people who were fighting communism, in their case, or in the case of South Boston, that closed world, that \"people who criticize us don't understand us and who we are.\" I think that he … This happens in human life. You see it throughout history in various places. One of the other motifs is the Salem witch hunt. It's that same persecution … So anyway, that's what it was. And he picked that up among these generals, I think, right away.\n\nJIM MCGOVERN: And those generals had no idea who they were dealing with, because they couldn't figure him out.\n\nKEVIN CULLEN: What did they make of him?\n\nJIM MCGOVERN: He wasn't your typical kind of foreign policy Congressman who will go down and have these official meetings and pose for pictures. I mean, he was telling jokes, he was singing songs. He was talking about growing up in South Boston, and all this stuff. And then he'd get to the point where he'd basically say, \"I just want you all to know that I'm not leaving here until I find out who killed these priests, and I mean it.\"\n\nSo he had this way about him that would kind of put people at ease, and then he'd be able to get information. People wanted to meet with him, and they couldn't quite figure out where this guy was coming from because, quite frankly, the United States government supplied the Salvadoran armed forces all the money and all the weapons and all the aid they wanted notwithstanding them killing an Archbishop and four American churchwomen, and tens of thousands of innocent Salvadorans. The money kept on coming because it was Reagan, then Bush; we were fighting communism in El Salvador.\n\nSo these generals never thought that their money would ever be in jeopardy. They never thought that the pipeline would ever stop. And Moakley, rightly, saw that they were bullies. They thought they would get their way; didn't make any difference what anybody said. What they didn't account for was that Moakley was not going to stop until he found out who killed these priests. He kept on coming back and coming back and coming back. I would go back. It just never ended.\n\nAnd finally, he was able to expose that the high command, the hierarchy of the Salvadoran armed forces -- who we trained, who we funded -- gave the orders. And the people who actually did the shooting, who murdered these priests in cold blood, dragged them out of their beds in the middle of the night on campus, as well as their housekeeper and her young daughter, were trained at the so-called School of the Americas in Fort Benning, Georgia. They were trained in the United States. The weapons that were used to kill these priests were made in the United States.\n\nSo he was determined, because he thought what happened was so awful and so wrong, that he was going to expos the truth. He felt that we as a country owed that to these people, given the fact that we had backed this military, we had supported this military. And he just wouldn't give up. I think one of the things that made him successful was that. Because most members of Congress, quite frankly, when there's a tragedy like that, they go down, they do their fact-finding visit, they do their press conference, and then they leave. Then, the press moves on to something else and it's not so newsworthy anymore, so they stop.\n\nHe just kept on going and going and going and going and going, until he got to the truth. And here's a guy who didn't speak Spanish; neither did I. [laughter] Had no investigative training. He said watching Columbo [laughter] helped a lot in how he figured all this out. And really, the only staff we had was essentially me and Bill Woodward, who was an aide to Gerry Studds at the time. But that was it. And we had a good ally in this guy called Leonel Gomez, who was kind of our eyes and ears in El Salvador. But he just stuck with it. And I'm going to tell you one thing about courage. He not only dealt with the generals in El Salvador, he also had to deal with the Bush Administration and some members of the church hierarchy here in the United States, who I won't mention by name, who were good friends with the Bushes …\n\nKEVIN CULLEN: Now, come on, names. [laughter]\n\nJIM MCGOVERN: … who urged him to back off. And he pushed back and said, \"Look, these priests were armed with nothing other than rosary beads. I don't care what their politics were, bottom line is no one should be able to get away with murdering them.\" So powerful people pushed back on him, told him to back off, you've done enough, you made your point. He just wouldn't do it.\n\nMARK SCHNEIDER: Can I just add briefly: Congressman McGovern's being a little modest here. When I did the research, it became clear to me how hard, how many trips, how difficult it was, and it was really Congressman McGovern -- and I think also Bill Woodward, it looks like -- who did the real legwork that unearthed the real story, which was it was the top four people in the hierarchy of the military who ordered the midlevel people, who took the fall for the Jesuit murders. And just one other thing. His Catholic faith was real. That was a big part of this, I think, for him. He had the best part of the Catholic tradition really written in his heart.\n\nKEVIN CULLEN: We're going to move to questions now. There are two microphones there for folks who want to line up. I guess my last question to both of you is: I'm pretty confident that Joe would say his greatest accomplishment was marrying a girl from North Cambridge named Evelyn. But would Joe consider his work in El Salvador his greatest work as a legislator?\n\nMARK SCHNEIDER: I would say there are two legacies. One of them is the New Deal and carrying that through in his legislative work. That's why his name is on all of these buildings, and that's why the courthouse has whatever it is, a million bricks. [laughter]\n\nAnd the second one is this: this is really a unique contribution. When I was in El Salvador, I spoke to the minister of public works who told me that he was hoping to build a monument to Joe Moakley in front of their foreign ministry because he was the best American friend that his country had. And I checked with the Librarian of Congress to see if there were any other such monuments. She said, \"Well, not that we know of.\" So that's clear, his work in El Salvador, which included two other components to the ones we've mentioned so far. The third one was after the immigrants and justice was the peace. By cutting the military aid in the Moakley- Murtha Bill in the House and the Dodd-Leahy Bill in the Senate, they contributed to the peace. The war ended in January of 1992. And then the fourth one was reconstruction. So that's all part of his legacy.\n\nJIM MCGOVERN: He loved the city. He used to tell me all the time that his favorite bird in the world was the crane. And when he'd drive into Boston and see all those cranes at work, he felt like he was doing his job. [laughter] So I think the development of this city, his dedication to fair housing and adequate housing for people.\n\nHe loved the casework. He took his greatest pride in solving … He'd get on the phone with somebody who needed help on an issue and he'd solve it himself. He'd be on the phone and solve one problem, the lady would have another one, another one. And then he'd find out she was in Joe Kennedy's district, not his. [laughter] But he'd still do it.\n\nAnd then the Salvador stuff, I think the people that he met down there really touched his heart. I think his Catholic faith had a lot to do with it in terms of the horror of the crime that was committed down there and understanding what these priests did, which was they literally did practice what they preached: They stood with the poor. They fed the hungry. When people were being oppressed, they were there. When someone was disappeared, they were the first people at the police station. I think he admired that gutsiness of these Jesuits.\n\nAnd I think the fact that he was able to get to the truth even though people told him to stop, that it actually helped contribute to peace, which it did. I mean, when we finally cut aid, it led to peace. And he said when he was ill that that was one of his greatest legacies; it meant a lot to him. Literally, there are millions of people who are alive today because of his involvement in this.\n\nKEVIN CULLEN: Jim, it's funny. I heard a variation of the crane story. He told me that, too. I heard it at the Bayside Club. He said to Bob Crane, \"I'm always happy when I see you.\" [laughter] We're going to start with questions. Sir, you're leading off.\n\nQUESTION: I was honored to be a volunteer for Joe the first time he ran as an Independent in West Roxbury. He was amazed at the power you had in these suburban towns if you went to the dumps on Saturday. [laughter] Being a Southie boy. But my question was what do you conceive of the relative roles of the House and the Senate? Because the preconception is that the House is sort of the tail and the Senate is the dog setting foreign policy. The relative power of each.\n\nJIM MCGOVERN: They're equal branches. The House in this case … There's a great book, and I can't remember the name of it, but it talked about how Congress can actually influence foreign policy, and it used this, Moakley's involvement …\n\nKEVIN CULLEN: For Republicans, it's called the Bible. [laughter]\n\nJIM MCGOVERN: The Bible, yeah. Moakley's involvement in El Salvador as an example of how the House of Representatives led the way to change our policy. I mean, look, I think the answer to the question is, it's wherever the …\n\nQUESTION: It depends on the guy.\n\nJIM MCGOVERN: Yeah, it depends on who the member of Congress is.\n\nQUESTION: And your funding power.\n\nJIM MCGOVERN: But we have to appropriate money in the House and they have to appropriate it in the Senate. So in order to have cut aid off, we needed both chambers to do that.\n\nMARK SCHNEIDER: The book might be William LeoGrande's. Is that the one your thinking of?\n\nJIM MCGOVERN: No. I can't remember now.\n\nMARK SCHNEIDER: But the William LeoGrande book on the Congress and Central America is a fantastic book.\n\nQUESTION: And just briefly, where do you see things going with Cuba now?\n\nJIM MCGOVERN: I'm hoping that things are going to move in a better direction. I think our policy toward Cuba is pretty dumb, this embargo that's been in place since Fidel Castro came to power over 50 years ago. [applause] It hasn't done anything. I always thought that the hardliners in Cuba, the two words in the English language they fear the most is \"spring break.\" [laughter] We all ought to be able to travel there.\n\nI should say here, I'm with Jenny Phillips and Mary Jo Adams, who are here. We're actually going to Cuba in a few weeks. We're working on this project to protect Ernest Hemingway's home and his writings and his books, all the stuff in his house. It's been a project that's gone on over ten years, and it's wonderful. It would have made it a hell of a lot easier to do if we didn't have all these restrictions on US citizens to be able to spend money there or to be able to transport things there. But I'm hoping that President Obama and Secretary Kerry will do what Senator Obama and Senator Kerry said they would do, and that is change our policy. [applause]\n\nMARK SCHNEIDER: Moakley made three trips to Cuba and there's a picture in the book of Congressman McGovern, Moakley, Congressmen Neal and Delahunt …\n\nJIM MCGOVERN: Giving me cash for a Red Sox jacket.\n\nMARK SCHNEIDER: [laughter]\n\nQUESTION: In the book, you talked about a trip that Representative Moakley made in November of '77 to the Middle East with a Congressional delegation that paved the way for the Camp David accords and the peace treaty between Egypt and Israel. And you said that he grew from the experience and that laid the groundwork for what he became in later life. Wasn't Moakley aware in later life of the Sabra and Shatila massacre? Wasn't he aware that the UN said that that Camp David accord was not in compliance with the UN Charter or UN Resolutions on the subject? Wasn't he aware that it became a modus vivendi for Israel and Egypt to further repress Palestinians down to the present day with them jointly carrying out an embargo and a siege on Gaza with the US Congress's backing?\n\nMARK SCHNEIDER: Moakley was pretty much just there by accident, basically. They were expecting this to happen, and it was never a central issue for him.\n\nQUESTION: But wasn't it? If he's concerned about a Salvadoran massacre, why wasn’t he concerned about an Israeli massacre, which is 100 times worse, let alone a continuing occupation that adds up to far more than anything that happened with the American backing of El Salvador.\n\nMARK SCHNEIDER: Okay, well, it's a great speech; I'm not sure I heard the question in there.\n\nKEVIN CULLEN: Point taken, sir. Over there?\n\nQUESTION: You mentioned early on that you were going to talk about Moakley's election, and nobody brought it back, how he got elected.\n\nMARK SCHNEIDER: That's probably my favorite story in the book. Thanks for asking. But Moakley ran for Congress in 1970, when John McCormack retired. And a Republican would not have a chance in this race. It was a crowded Democratic field, which was ultimately reduced to three candidates: Moakley, Louis Day Hicks and Dave Nelson, who was an African American candidate. The liberal anti-Hicks vote divided and Moakley lost the race so it looked like he was out of politics forever. He wanted to get back in, and on the advice of a guy who I think has played an interesting role in state politics– because I'm not sure Moakley would have been elected had he done this; Hicks might have resigned and it might have happened -- but on the advice of a guy called Pat McCarthy, Moakley ran as an Independent in the 1972 race, and he defeated the Democrat and Hicks and the Republican. To defeat the Democrat, he had to go up against the Democratic Party establishment, Tip O'Neill, who of course recorded ads for the Democratic Party candidate. So it's a very interesting story.\n\nJIM MCGOVERN: I should also tell you, when I was in college I worked with George McGovern and when I heard there was an opening in Moakley's office, I asked him, \"Do you know Joe Moakley?\" He says, \"I know him very well. He's a very good man. And I regret very much that in 1972, in order for me to get the Democratic Party's nod, I had to endorse the Democratic ticket, which included that woman, Louise Day Hicks.\" [laughter] And he says, \"But I'm glad he won anyway. I always felt bad because he was right on a lot of the issues that I care deeply about.\"\n\nKEVIN CULLEN: Yes, sir?\n\nQUESTION: Robert Morris from South Boston. I want to go back a little. As I understand, Joe Moakley joined the Marine Corps when he was 16 and went to war?\n\nMARK SCHNEIDER: SM: Seabees.\n\nQUESTION: Seabees, right. And he came back from World War II and in 1991, I met him in his office and I was lobbying for the attack of Iraq to free Kuwait in the first Persian Gulf War. And he said he was absolutely against it, he's against war, period. That's all I got out of him. I was very impressed by that, but I was confused. So to move forward to now -- and this is to Congressman McGovern -- how did his pacifism, if that's a true word, how did that affect you over all these years and bring you to your position on Syria presently, which I very much appreciate your position and I think you're right.\n\nJIM MCGOVERN: Look, I wouldn't say Joe Moakley was a pacifist, because I don't think he was. But he had street smarts, which I wish more people in Washington would have. Some of these people in the State Department, they map out all these kind of strategies that I guess make sense to them in a drawing room, but in real life don't make a lot of sense. I think he was able to cut to the chase. I think he saw wars as things that kill a lot of innocent people, that should be avoided at all costs, that should be the absolutely last resort.\n\nMy views were strengthened by his example, his hesitation. We have some people that would go to war in a nanosecond; they want to go to war for anything. I think he spent a lot of time with veterans. He spent a lot of time in VA hospitals. He talked to people who had seen horrible things and the victims of war. He always thought there was another way. With Syria, there was another way, and hopefully that'll be successful.\n\nBut Moakley … Look, I'm on the Rules Committee, he put me on the Rules Committee. When he was dying, he called me up and he said, \"How would you like to be on the Rules Committee?\" Before I could say anything he said, \"Well, no, let me rephrase that: You're going on the Rules Committee.\" [laughter] I said to him, \"Well, you know.\" He said, \"Look, Tip O'Neill was on the Rules Committee and then he ran for leadership. He put me on the Rules Committee, I was on the Rules Committee. I was Chairman. You need to be on the Rules Committee. We need someone from Massachusetts on the Rules Committee.\" I said, \"Well, okay, but I don't know if I can get on the Committee.\" He says, \"Don't worry, I'll take care of it.\" He called Dick Gephardt up and he said, \"Dick, I got some bad news for you. I'm very, very sick. I've got maybe three months to live.\" And Gephardt's like, \"Oh, my god, is there anything I can do?\" He says, \"Just one thing.\" [laughter] \"Would you out McGovern on the Rules Committee?\"\n\nSo I sit on the Rules Committee with his portrait looking at me every day. There's not a day that goes by that I don't say something and I look at that portrait, and sometimes it's smiling, sometimes it's frowning, sometimes it's looking at me like, \"Ugh, I can't believe you said that.\" [laughter] So much of my life has been impacted by him, not only ideologically, but by the fact that I'm in Congress; I wouldn't have been elected to Congress without him, without his help and without his support. I owe him an awful lot.\n\nKEVIN CULLEN: Over there, ma'am.\n\nQUESTION: Pat McSweeney from Taunton. I want to thank you, Jim McGovern, for explaining tonight what happened at the School of the Americas, and that we American taxpayers have paid for that kind of thing. I went down to the protests at the School of the Americas about nine times. And even though the name has been changed – it's an Orwellian name, WHISC, Western Hemisphere Institute for Security Corporation – it's still in the same kind of business of fighting, really– protecting the people at the top, the corporations and the people with money at the top.\n\nAnother thing we Americans don't hear about is right now there is an 84-year-old nun and two Catholic workers in federal prison because they breached the security at Oak Ridge, Tennessee. We don't hear much about it on television or in the newspapers, but I suggest that you Google “Transform Now Plowshares” or “Sister Megan Rice” …\n\nKEVIN CULLEN: Is there a question there? We need a question here. QUESTION: I really wanted to just thank Jim McGovern. Thank you. JIM MCGOVERN: Thank you.\n\nKEVIN CULLEN: Yes, sir?\n\nQUESTION: I just wanted to get a little clarity on the Jesuit priests that were killed. I assume they were part of, was it liberation theology that was going on at the time?\n\nJIM MCGOVERN: Yes.\n\nQUESTION: And was that around the same time that Congressman Drinan, Father Drinan was asked to leave Congress?\n\nJIM MCGOVERN: He was actually a few years before that. But, yes, these priests practiced liberation theology, and I thought it was inspiring. I think Moakley did, too. I think he liked the idea of people of faith practicing that faith, and if that meant feeding the hungry, you fed the hungry. If that meant standing with the poor and the oppressed, you did. Because he used to say, \"When I grew up, the priest would say in church 'blessed are the poor' and then it would end. I liked the message 'blessed are the poor and let's help them not be so poor' better.\" He was really inspired by the Jesuits, and for me, I was kind of a lapsed Catholic and it brought me back into the church in a way where I felt like there's some meaning here for me. But Drinan was in 1980. So this was '89.\n\nKEVIN CULLEN: He was only there for ten years.\n\nQUESTION: Okay, thank you.\n\nQUESTION My name is Bob Hart. I'm from Charlestown and I'm also a docent here at the Kennedy Library. I, just like the lady who was here a few seconds ago, want to commend Congressman McGovern for all he's done on not only the El Salvador issue, but all that flows from that in terms of the injustices with respect to our aid to military dictatorships.\n\nI just want to relate a very personal story very quickly that involves you, Congressman McGovern. I was with you and a group of Boston College students at the School of the Americas a few years ago, and they explained that they had been invited by the army to go into the School of the Americas for a briefing on what went on there. I saw your ears perk up and you said, \"Oh, could I join you?\" And you went in there, and I can just imagine the army's reaction when they saw Congressman McGovern.\n\nJIM MCGOVERN: Thank you. [applause]\n\nKEVIN CULLEN: Sir, over here?\n\nQUESTION: A quick anecdote here. I'm fortunate enough to be a volunteer at Mass General in the cancer unit. A couple months before Joe passed away, he came in, and I was doing paperwork and I looked up and it was Joe and he said, \"Joe Moakley, I'm here to see a doctor.\" So I moved the things around and I looked over and he's sitting down by himself. I went over and said, \"Joe, I bet you're sitting here just trying to come up with a joke for the breakfast,\" which was going to be in a couple of weeks. And he said, \"Not really. That is the biggest pain in the neck that you can imagine. Every time I come up with a joke, there's some wise guy who always steals it from me before I say it. Not the way I wanted to spend my day.\" He paused for a minute and said, \"You know what else bothers me? These kids that always drive around with their hats on backwards. If I was registrar of motor vehicles, I'd take their license right away.\" [laughter] It's typical Joe.\n\nAnd then one other quick anecdote, which I'm sure a lot of people in this room have heard, but apparently Joe was asked by the good Sisters of South Boston on their Christmas house tour if he could have his house open after his wife died. He was reluctant to do this, and Bill Bulger said, \"It might be a nice thing for you to do, Joe.\" So he said, \"Okay, fine.\" And the Sisters said, \"We'll be over, Joe, we'll take care of everything, we'll decorate everything; you don't have to worry about it at all.\" It all went off very, very well. The next year they said, \"Joe, it was such a success, could we come over and do it again?\" And Joe said, \"That's fine, let's do it.\" And the Sisters said, \"Well, we'll be over and redecorate and do everything for you.\" He says, \"Don't bother, they're still up from last year.\" [laughter]\n\nKEVIN CULLEN: I thought you were going to tell us that at Mass General Joe said, \"I'm dying to get McGovern on the Rules Committee.\" [laughter]\n\nMARK SCHNEIDER: That story is in the book, and he followed that up by saying, \"I live by myself now. If a goddamn hippopotamus died in my house, nobody would know.\" [laughter]\n\nQUESTION: Hi, top of the evening. I'm Bill Shaevel from Jamaica Plain, and I had the honor of working with Joe when he was in the State Senate. So I've got a couple of questions. First, Mark, you list these four legislative accomplishments, and they're all on the federal level. One of the major ones -- and I think you discussed a little bit of it in the book -- is a term of snob zoning. And that was a concept that the suburbs were zoning out low income housing. Moakley, very much like what he did with Jim McGovern, Legal Aid came to him in the late '60s and he was open to the whole concept. I was in on the meeting, and he kind of ran with the principle and put it together. So you might talk a little bit about it.\n\nAnd then the second thing I wanted to comment was just on the state level, there was, in the late '60s when he was in the Senate, there was much of the Vietnam activism going on. Joe came from another era and had trouble understanding it, and I can remember him going twice down to Cambridge to attend the rallies and demonstrations, and he would come back and he would really talk to me and he'd say, \"You know, these kids aren't as bad as they're being made out to be.\n\nThere's more to it.\" And it's very, very much like he is. And the last, Jim, might be if you tell that story about the memo when you were down in El Salvador. It's a funny story about how Joe operated. So Mark, maybe a little bit about snob zoning. I think there's probably about 65-75,000 units that have been built. And Massachusetts is one of the few places that can do that.\n\nMARK SCHNEIDER: Yeah, Bill worked on that law with Joe, and it passed; it's a Massachusetts law. The problem was that in the mid- and late-'60s Boston had a housing crisis. Actually, the region did. While the city's population was declining over a 10-20-year period as people moved into the suburbs, there was no low cost housing in the suburbs. Builders don't want to build it. And the suburban municipalities were fearing budget constraints, had zoning laws that prohibited building on small lots. Moakley's bill said, no, sorry, but you can't. A municipality will lose its state aid – I think that's the formulation, right? That's the penalty, should you pass one of these laws. And it facilitated the construction of low cost housing in the suburban surrounding communities and that alleviated the housing shortage in the metropolitan region.\n\nSean Ryan, a later aide for Joe, said to me that Moakley is sometimes perceived as a kind of urban mechanic like Menino. Not a big vision guy, but he'll fix your pothole and your streetlight. But, he pointed out -- and this is kind of an example of it -- he was an early proponent of environmental legislation. Bill worked with him in the State Senate on that issue: cleaning up the harbor, a very early spokesperson, the one member of the legislature who was invited to Harvard's first Earth Day. And there was part of this for Jim.\n\nJIM MCGOVERN: I think the story you're referring to, you were talking about when Moakley was in El Salvador on the very first trip. It was not clear who had killed the priests. Some were saying the guerillas had killed the priests. And we had picked up a rumor that a US major stationed at the embassy had heard from another Salvadoran army officer that the army killed the priest and that a US colonel actually put an affidavit together basically stating what he heard. So we had our briefing with the embassy and Moakley had heard this and asked the Ambassador, \"Can I see that affidavit because we're part of this investigating team.\" And the Ambassador said, \"Well, we're going to do the briefing. I'll check with the Secretary of Defense,\" who at the time was Dick Cheney, “But we'll get an answer for you right away.\"\n\nSo midway through the briefing, the Ambassador comes back and says, \"The Secretary of Defense says you cannot see it.\" So Moakley says to me, \"Get up, let's go.\" I said, \"It's a briefing.” We had other members there. He said, \"We're going.\" I said, \"Where are we going?\" He said, \"We've got to get a cab.\" I said, \"But there's a war going on in this country, what do you mean?\" \"We're going to get a cab. We're going to go to the military headquarters and we're going to meet with the head of the investigative unit,\" who the night before we had just criticized beyond belief.\n\nWe take a cab. We go to the Minister of Defense. We get to see this colonel. And Moakley said, \"Look, I wanted to come by to apologize to you for how hard the questioning was yesterday. We were tired. We grilled you too hard. We didn't really mean to. Please accept my apology.\" And the colonel's like, \"Oh, that's really nice of you, thank you.\" He said, \"There was a question I had for you last night, and I forgot to ask. It's regarding this affidavit. Jeez, I left it in my other sport coat pocket. [laughter] Do you have that US major's affidavit?\" The guy goes, \"Oh, yeah, hold on. Here it is.\" He said, \"You know what? I left my reading glasses in my other pocket, do you mind making a Xerox for me.\" He made the Xerox for him, he put it in his pocket and said, \"Thank you very much.\" Got back to the embassy in time for the closing of the briefing where he stood up and said, \"You can tell Dick Cheney to\"– and I can't repeat it here. [laughter/applause] But it's what Joe Moakley would say. And so, that's how he cracked the case.\n\nKEVIN CULLEN: Another testament to Joe's political acumen is he never went hunting with Dick Cheney. [laughter] We have time for one more question and it falls to you, ma'am.\n\nQUESTION: Thank you very much. I'm Betty Fish, from Hull, Massachusetts. I thank all three of you for this excellent panel. I'm never disappointed when I come here. But I do have a question about Joe Moakley's presence today in El Salvador. Is there ongoing activity there in the cause of peace, in the cause of poverty? Is there ongoing activity in this country to support immigration bills in terms of the Salvadoran people? I know Salvador's the poorest country in the Americas. What's happening there today? What's his legacy at this time?\n\nJIM MCGOVERN: I think his legacy there is twofold. One, I think, the country's not at war. It's still a very poor country. It's still, unfortunately because of crime, a violent country. But there's no war and he played a role in that. I think especially within the Jesuit community there, he's revered as somebody who stuck with it. Just as importantly as all of that, he's a symbol I think for what is best in America. I mean, people have a view of this country that I think is really positive because they're using him as the example and that can't be underplayed.\n\nThe villages that we visited back in 1989/1990, people are obviously older now. They still remember him and that's very unique. In that country, that's so far away from here, South Boston, that people think of Joe Moakley as like their Congressman. He actually helped solve some problems. By the way, along the way, in doing all the investigative stuff like that, he helped some kids get prosthetic legs who lost their legs to land mines. He helped get a donation to help build a health clinic in an area that was poor. He did all these little … he was doing case work along the way. It's unique. And like I said, both here in the United States and down there, he made politics an honorable thing. And I wish we had more people like him, quite frankly. [applause]\n\nOne last thing, just to give you kind of a measure of the kind of guy he was – and Fred Clark and Bill Shaevel know this, is that Jim Woodard back there, too? Yes? It's Woody. There are some great people who worked on his staff, and I learned from them a lot, too.\n\nBut just to give you an example of the kind of guy Moakley was, right up until the very end, I remember visiting him at Bethesda Hospital. This is shortly before he died. He was sitting at the end of the bed and I said, \"How you doing?\" He said, \"I'm doing great. I'm eating three meals a day. I'm regular. I feel wonderful. Everything's going good. But I got this one problem. Hold on, this may be the call.\" And I could hear him on the phone saying, \"I know, Father, yes, Father, no. But Father, she's a good kid and she really needs to get into that school. Yeah, no, I get it. Okay, but I need to know soon, because I'm not going to be here very long and I want to be able to call the parents and tell them I got her into BC. Can you help me out?\" [laughter] So he was doing case work right up until the very end. He's probably still doing case work. [laughter]"
