        "meta_description": "Princess Fawzia Fuad of Egypt and Iran (5 November 1921 – 2 July 2013) was an Egyptian princess who became Queen of Iran as the first wife of Mohammad Reza Pahlavi. She is also known as Fawzia Chirine, having remarried in 1949. Although her royal titles were no longer recognized by the Egyptian government after the Egyptian Revolution of 1952 international protocol dictates that former monarchs and members of former ruling royal families still retain titles obtained whilst a member of a reigning monarchy. Princess Fawzia was born Her Sultanic Highness Princess Fawzia bint Fuad at Ras el-Tin Palace in Alexandria, the eldest daughter of Sultan Fuad I of Egypt and Sudan (later King Fuad I), and his second wife, Nazli Sabri on 5 November 1921. Her maternal great-grandfather was Major-General Muhammad Sharif Pasha, Prime Minister and Minister for Foreign Affairs, who was of Turkish origin. One of her great-great-grandfathers was Suleiman Pasha, a French army officer who served under Napoleon, converted to Islam, and oversaw an overhaul of the Egyptian army. Princess Fawzia of Egypt married Mohammad Reza Pahlavi (1919–1980), the then Crown Prince of Iran in Cairo on 16 March 1939; after their honeymoon, the wedding ceremonies were repeated in Tehran. The marriage was planned by Mohammad Reza's father. Two years later, the crown prince succeeded his exiled father and was to become the Shah of Iran. The marriage was not a success. After the birth of the couple’s daughter, Queen Fawzia (the title of empress was not yet used in Iran at that time) obtained an Egyptian divorce in 1945, whereupon she moved to Cairo. This divorce was first not recognized for several years by Iran, but eventually an official divorce was obtained in Iran, on 17 November 1948, with Queen Fawzia successfully reclaiming her previous distinction of Princess of Egypt as well. A major condition of the divorce was that her daughter be left behind to be raised in Iran. Fawzia married twice again and lived in Egypt after the 1952 revolution that toppled King Farouk. In her later life, she lived in Alexandria, Egypt, where she died on 2 July 2013 at the age of 91. (Condensed from Wikipedia). The picture shows Princess Shahnaz as well.",
