        "text": "In this week's Styled Archives, we delve into the style and fashion of Princess Fawzia Fuad of Egypt. Her story, spanning the early 20th century to the year 2013, unfolds against the backdrop of a changing world, from her upbringing in the opulent palaces of Alexandria to her short-lived marriage and becoming the Queen of Iran.\n\nBorn into the Egyptian royal family, Princess Fawzia's path intertwined with international politics. Hailing from a lineage of Albanian, French and Circassian descent, Princess Fawzia Fuad of Egypt was the youngest daughter of King Fuad I and eldest sister to King Farouk, the last Egyptian monarch. She was also a descendant of Muhammad Ali.\n\nA global icon of elegance, Princess Fawzia's wardrobe showcased a fusion of European trends and hints of exotic Eastern allure. Known for her piercing blue eyes, jet black hair and heart-shaped face, her beauty was often compared to Vivien Leigh and Hedy Lamarr with her movie star looks. Even after the dissolution of her marriage and the overthrow of the Muhammad Ali dynasty in 1952, Princess Fawzia still remained royally fashionable.\n\n1940s\n\nNothing screams royalty like sitting poised in a draping gown with a jewelled crown over your head and priceless diamonds adorning your neck, and that’s just what Princess Fawzia seemed to think as well.\n\n1942\n\nPhotographed by Cecil Beaton\n\nPrincess Fawzia was trendy before the trends ever took place. Ever since last year, the rage has been all about hooded dresses and hooded tops. She’s seen here rocking the trend in a silk blue number back in 1942 with chunky gold jewellery.\n\n1944\n\nPrincess Fawzia, Queen Farida, King Farouk & Queen Nazli at King Farouk’s Birthday in Abdeen Palace\n\nWay back when birthdays were a grand affair, the princess was spotted here with her brother King Farouk for his birthday party, along with his first wife Queen Farida, and Queen Nazlia, the second wife of King Fuad I. Who else wants to go back to opulent birthday parties at larger-than-life palaces?\n\n1942\n\nIt seems that Princess Fawzia was ahead of her time, in terms of fashion at least. The cinched waist, the gold broach, the wrapped choker, this au courant outfit would still make a head-turning ensemble today.\n\n1949\n\nPrincess Fawzia with her younger sister, Princess Faiza, at the Royal Opera House\n\nThe princess encapsulates the energy of you can never be too overdressed, dressed to the nines in a slimming gown, topped off with a trailing cape. With erect detailing around the neck, she proves that the details are what truly make an outfit stand out.\n\n1940\n\nIn a little black dress with lace interwork around the neckline and slightly padded shoulders, Princess Fawzia adorns a pearl necklace that stands stark between the square shaping of the decolletage.\n\n1946\n\nParis\n\nA hat moment? Oui. A hat and fur moment? Oui, oui! There’s a reason her royal highness is beaming her with an ear-to-ear grin, and that’s because she knows she just slayed this look.\n\n1939\n\nRoyals and their in-home photoshoots. Getting glammed to take pictures at home? Pssht, we don’t ever do that these days. Princess Fawzia opted for a floral piece, a white dress with flower motifs (another sizzling trend this season). Dripping in ice, the ditsy dress juxtaposes beautifully with her fancy updo and giant jewellery."
