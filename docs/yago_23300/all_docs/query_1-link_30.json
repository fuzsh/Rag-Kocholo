He became sultan of Egypt in 1917 and king in 1922, when Britain granted Egypt independence. His only surviving son became Farouk I.\n\nAhmed Fuad was born in Giza Palace in Cairo, the seventh son of Isma'il Pasha. He was a member of the Muhammad Ali dynasty, a family of largely Albanian ancestry and came to prominence in Egypt under the Ottoman Empire. His mother was Farial Kadin. He succeeded his elder brother Husayn Kamil as sultan, after the latter's brief three-year reign.\n\nHe married, as his first wife, at Cairo, May 30, 1895 and at the Abbasiya Palace in Cairo, February 14, 1896, H.H. Princess Shivakiar Khanum Effendi (1876-1947). She was his cousin and the only daughter of Field Marshal H.H. Prince Ibrahim Fahmi Ahmad Pasha, by his second wife, Vijdan Navjuvan Khanum. Unhappily married, the couple divorced in 1898, and the former Princess Ahmed Fuad went on to marry three more times. They had two children, a son, Ismail Fuad, who died in infancy, and a daughter, Fawkia.\n\nHe married, as his second wife, at the Bustan Palace, Cairo, May 26, 1919, Nazli Sabri (1894-1978), daughter of H.E.

The couple had five children, the future Farouk I and four daughters, the Princesses Fawzia, Faiza, Faika, and Fathiya.\n\nFuad I died at the Kubba Palace in Cairo and was buried at the Khedival Mausoleum in the ar-Rifai Mosque in Cairo.\n\nSee also\n\nList of Rulers of Modern Egypt"
