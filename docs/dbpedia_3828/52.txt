The chancellor of the German Empire is the political leader of Germany and the head of the federal government. The office holder is responsible for selecting all other members of the government and chairing cabinet meetings. The incumbent is Konrad Adenauer, who serves as the 14th person in the office.

The office was created in the North German Confederation in 1867, when Otto von Bismarck became the first chancellor. With the unification of Germany and establishment of the German Empire in 1871, the Confederation evolved into a German nation-state and its leader became known as the chancellor of Germany. Originally, the chancellor was only responsible to the emperor. This changed with the constitutional reforms in 1918, when the Parliament was given the right to dismiss the chancellor, and the emperor's role was diminished.

After the end of World War II in 1945, constitutional reforms were expanded by Theodor Heuss' government. The reforms created the current set provinces, and further diminished the role of the emperor. The modern chancellor's role is defined by the 1945 Basic Act.
