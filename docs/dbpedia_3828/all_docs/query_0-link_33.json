        "text": "Emerson Howland Swift served on the faculty of the University’s newly created Department of Art between 1922 and 1926. Trained as a classical archaeologist (BA in Classics, Williams College in 1912, PhD in Classical Archaeology, Princeton University in 1921), Swift began to pursue an interest in art history during the years he spent conducting field work in Greece (1912-1915); after a 1913 trip to Istanbul, Swift's writings increasingly focused on Byzantine art.\n\nSwift's impact on the field of Byzantine art remains significant. He was among the major proponents of the theory that Early Christian thought and art were fundamentally derived from Roman predecessors and that the formal characteristics that defined Byzantine art originated in formal and stylistic tropes intrinsic to Italy. Swift’s theory about formal and stylistic origins of Early Christian art stood in opposition to the views of a number of other prominent Byzantinists of the early 20th century, most notably the work of Josef Strzygowski and Charles Rufus Morey, who asserted that the sources of Late Antique Christian works could be traced to western Asian precedents.\n\nIn 1924, Swift, previously a member of the faculty of the University of Michigan, was hired by Walter Sargent as Assistant Professor of the History of Art at the University of Chicago, and he taught courses focusing on Renaissance architecture and sculpture during his time at the University. Due to his disagreement with Walter Sargent’s teaching-oriented departmental policies, Swift left the University in 1926. Swift was appointed Associate Professor of Fine Arts at Columbia University, where he taught from 1926 until his retirement in 1957.\n\nCarly Boxer\n\nSelect Bibliography\n\nRoman Sources for Christian Art.

He remained at Yale as an assistant professor in Greek until 1887. Between 1889 and 1893 he spent time teaching at Harvard College and at the American School of Classical Studies in Athens as both director and secretary. He joined the University of Chicago in 1893 as assistant professor of Greek, and then as professor of Classical Archaeology.\n\nTarbell offered some of the University’s first courses in art, including “Introduction to Classical Archaeology”, “Greek Mythology in Art”, and “Greek Life from the Monuments.” He also taught courses in Greek and Logic. Although he was by training a classicist, Tarbell became the first chair of the Department of Art History when it was formed in 1902 by renaming the Department of Archaeology. At that time, the Art History faculty consisted only of himself and one other instructor. He was the first to urge that the University put aside funds to form its own collection of reproductions and original works of art for study, though this did not occur during his lifetime.\n\nTarbell’s scholarship came to focus increasingly on the material remains of antiquity—mainly Greek, but also Etruscan and Roman. His major work, first published in 1896, was an introductory level textbook, A History of Greek Art, which saw many subsequent printings. His writing belies an acute awareness of the limits of the archaeological record and the importance of provenance, in addition to a critical eye for forgery. Above all, his writing conveys his sense of the value of aesthetics:\n\n“But this book has been written in the conviction that the greatest of all motives for studying art, the motive which is and ought to be strongest in most people, is the desire to become acquainted with beautiful and noble things, the things that sooth the cares and lift the thoughts of man.” (iii, 1896 edition)\n\nTarbell retired from the University of Chicago in 1918, and passed away in 1920.\n\nHilary Barker\n\nSelected Bibliography\n\nDe Cou, Herbert Fletcher, and Frank Bigelow Tarbell.

He became a full Professor of Egyptology and Oriental History in 1905 and had appointments in the Divinity School, the Department of Archaeology, the later Department of the History of Art, the Department of General Literature, and the Department of History before being promoted to Chair of the Department of Semitic Languages and Literatures in 1915. Breasted studied with the founding president of the University of Chicago, William Rainey Harper, at Yale University before completing his studies at the University of Berlin in 1894, becoming the first American to receive a PhD in Egyptology. Breasted’s wide scholarship and important archeological excavations captured the popular imagination and transformed the study of ancient Near-Eastern civilizations with his concept of the “fertile crescent” that spanned from ancient Egypt to Phoenicia, Assyria, and Mesopotamia. Among his many scholarly, introductory, and reference texts, Breasted published a comprehensive five-volume Ancient Records of Egypt (1906), which translated into English the most important known Egyptian historical texts. His 1905-06 and 1906-07 photographic and epigraphic surveys of Egypt recorded many tombs and temples along the Nile that helped lay the groundwork for our understanding of ancient Egyptian civilization. Breasted’s Oriental Forerunners of Byzantine Painting: First-Century Wall Paintings from the Fortress of Dura on the Middle Euphrates (1924), the first book published on the frescoes of Dura Europos, opened a major field of study by positing the site as a key link between the art of the East and West. Breasted’s later book Dawn of Conscience (1933) that linked the origins of Hebrew thought to ancient Egypt was also an important influence for Sigmund Freud’s Moses and Monotheism (1938). After becoming the director of the University of Chicago’s Haskell Oriental Museum in 1894, Breasted secured funding from John D. Rockefeller Jr. in 1919 to found the Oriental Institute in its permanent headquarters at the University of Chicago. Today, the Institute remains a leading center of ancient Near Eastern Studies with a vast collection of rare artifacts, photographs, excavation records, and publications that build on the foundations set by Breasted’s research, teaching, and stewardship.\n\nMarin Sarvé-Tarr\n\nSelect Bibliography\n\nJames Henry Breasted, A History of Egypt from the Earliest Times to the Persian Conquest (New York: Charles Scribner's Sons, 1905).\n\nAncient Records of Egypt: Historical Documents from the Earliest Times to the Persian Conquest, collected, edited, and translated, with Commentary (Chicago: University of Chicago Press. 1906–07).\n\nA History of the Ancient Egyptians (New York Charles Scribner's Sons, 1908).\n\nDevelopment of Religion and Thought in Ancient Egypt: Lectures delivered on the Morse Foundation at Union Theological Seminary (New York: Charles Scribner's Sons, 1912).\n\nAncient Times — A History of the Early World (Boston: The Athenæum Press, 1916).\n\nSurvey of the Ancient World.

A member of the University Board of Museums in 1928, Rothschild was named acting Chair of the Department of Art in 1931. He received his PhD from Harvard University in 1934. Rothschild, whose research specialized in Gothic art and modern painting, gave numerous public lectures on the history of ancient through modern art, expressionism, and abstraction at the Renaissance Society at the University of Chicago, the Art Institute of Chicago, and the College Art Association. As part of a series of books published for the Renaissance Society, Studies of Meaning in Art, Rothschild’s foundational book The Meaning of Unintelligibility in Modern Art (1934) introduced a broad public to key approaches to understanding contemporary currents in modern art through the lenses of individualism, revolution, and dematerialization. The series, edited by Pulitzer Prize-winning author and playwright Thornton Wilder, became widely known for its clarity and breadth that introduced a variety of readers to essential tools for the understanding and appreciation of modern art. The other two books in the series included Plastic Redirections in Twentieth-Century Painting (1934) by James Johnson Sweeney, who became the first director of The Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum in 1953 and Seurat and the Evolution of La Grande Jatte (1935) by Daniel Catton Rich, a University of Chicago alumnus who became the director of the Art Institute of Chicago in 1938. Rothschild’s untimely death in 1937 at the age of 33 tragically cut short his burgeoning career.\n\nMarin Sarvé-Tarr\n\nSelect Bibliography\n\nEdward Francis Rothschild, The Meaning of Unintelligibility in Modern Art (Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1934)\n\nJohn Shapley (BA University of Missouri 1912, MA Princeton University 1913, PhD University of Vienna 1914) was appointed to a position as Professor and Chair of the Department of Art at the University of Chicago in 1929. Diverging from his predecessor Walter Sargent’s focus on the integration of practice with historical and theoretical approaches to art, Shapley sought to make the University a stronghold for historical scholarship.\n\nFrom 1923 - 1938, Shapley served as the fourth President of the College Art Association, an organization he played an instrumental role in founding; he was also the editor of Parnassus and The Art Bulletin at the time of his appointment to the University's Department of Art and, notably, helped to support the production of The Art Bulletin during the Great Depression through his own financial contributions. Within his own field of expertise, Shapley served as a founding member and eventual president of the Byzantine Institute.\n\nShapley worked throughout his career to make the study of art history accessible to a broader audience, collaborating with the Carnegie Corporation in the 1920s to select some 2,000 images and 200 books that would serve as the foundation for the Corporation’s effort to provide the materials necessary for art historical research to high schools and colleges in the United States. The Carnegie “sets,” as these collections of images and texts are known, helped to integrate the modern discipline of art history into secondary school curricula throughout the United States. His wife, the curator Fern Rusk Shapley worked with Bernard Berenson to prepare Berenson's Drawings of the Florentine Painter; Shapley arranged for an affordable new printing of the work, making the massive three volume set widely available to art students for the first time.\n\nBefore joining the faculty of the University of Chicago, Shapley taught at Brown University and served as Head of the Department of Art at New York University. Shapley left the University in 1938 and held professorships at Catholic University, Howard University, George Washington University, Federal City College, and Johns Hopkins University; he also taught at the University of Baghdad in the 1960s, and during that time contributed to the six-volume “Survey of Persian Art.”\n\nCarly Boxer\n\nSelect Bibliography\n\n“The Analysis of Beauty,” The Bulletin of the College Art Association of America 1, 1918.\n\n“Another Sidamara Sarcophagus.” The Art Bulletin 5, 1923.\n\n“A Lost Cartoon for Leonardo’s Madonna with St. Anne.’ The Art Bulletin 7, 1925.\n\nwith Fern Rusk Shapley.

To students of Chinese art, she is best known as co-author with Kenji Toda (1880-1976 ) of Chinese Calligraphy—the first scholarly account in English to articulate the principles, styles, and techniques of China’s most esteemed art form. This modest (seventy-one-page) volume, completed in 1932 and illustrated almost exclusively with ink rubbings collected by Berthold Laufer (1874-1934) of Chicago’s Field Museum, earned Driscoll justifiable prominence. In 1935, the year of its publication, Driscoll made her only trip to East Asia.\n\nDriscoll described her classes in Chinese painting as incorporating principles as well as technique. A faculty record defines the former as “art theory and criticism, oriental and occidental; psychology.” Driscoll’s correspondence with luminaries of psychology as well as art history in both Europe and China distinguished her as a Western trailblazer in associating the theories of Gestalt with those of Chinese painting and calligraphy. Through most of the 1930s, Driscoll exchanged letters with Kurt Koffka (1886-1941), one founder of this German school of psychology and the first to associate its ideas with those of visual perception. In 1937, Driscoll was awarded a one-year Guggenheim fellowship to collect materials in China for a book on Chinese theories of art as applied to painting and calligraphy. The outbreak of the Sino-Japanese War thwarted her plan en route, and the book, then clearly well along, was never completed. Nonetheless and through a translator, she had already initiated thought-provoking correspondence with the eminent literati painter, scholar, and connoisseur Huang Binhong (1865-1955), whose theoretical persuasion had likewise stimulated his interest in Gestalt. Three of Driscoll’s letters to Huang are preserved in the Zhejiang Art Museum in Hangzhou, the artist’s native city.\n\nElinor Pearlstein\n\nSelect Bibliography\n\nLucy Catherine Driscoll, “The Walking Position in European Art,” Thesis (A.M.), University of Chicago, 1909.\n\nLucy Driscoll and Kenji Toda, Chinese Calligraphy.

The second president of the College Art Association, from 1914–1915, he was an influential proponent of a nationwide movement that sought to reform artistic education in the United States. A theorist, pedagogue, and landscape painter, he promoted instruction in art and aesthetic appreciation as an integral part of children’s intellectual development. For Sargent, art was the counterpart to rational scientific thinking and of comparable importance. The program and ideals of education he devised were based in equal measure on psychology, aesthetics, and the history of art, as well as on an emphasis on drawing, creative expression, and cultivation of taste. Sargent’s commitment to contemporary society lead him to a particular concern with modern art. In 1924, fifteen years after his initial appointment at the University, he became professor and the first chair of the newly created Department of Art. In the next three years before his death he implemented his educational programs, transforming the department’s traditional academic orientation into a center of the study and practice of art and a home to artists, designers, art instructors, and art historians alike. Sargent’s ideal of the integration of theory and practice, high and low art, the history of art and contemporary artistic expression shaped the Department of Art for the next half-century. He is the author of several influential textbooks and studies, most significant of which are The enjoyment and use of color (1923) and How children learn to draw (1916). Instruction in art in the United States (19198) lays out programmatic guidelines for the education of children and university students, published by the Bureau of Education of the Department of the Interior.\n\nMartin Schwarz\n\nSelect Bibliography Literature\n\nSargent, Walter.

He arrived at the University of Chicago from the University of Washington, Saint Louis, where he accepted his first position in 1932 before completing his PhD at Harvard University in 1933. He later served as an Associate Professor and Professor of Art at Northwestern University from 1946 until his retirement in 1973. Huntley’s research addressed the Italian Renaissance and traced stylistic developments from the eighteenth- to nineteenth-centuries. In 1946, his College Art Journal article “In Defense of Ornament” sparked a lively scholarly debate on shifting attitudes towards decoration in historical and modern design. His other important works include a book-length monographic study of the Italian renaissance sculpture, Andrea Sansovino, Sculptor and Architect of the Italian Renaissance (1935). In 1942, Huntley became the editor of the College Art Journal. During his two years as editor, he tailored the content of the journal to address the interests of teaching art at the university level with topics such as introductory art history surveys, the use of color film, and museum education along with articles on modern art and aesthetics. Active in the profession throughout his career, Huntley served as on the Board of Directors of the College Art Association from 1945-1946 before becoming Vice-President from 1947-49. He headed the Newberry Library Conference in 1955 and served as President of the Midwest College Art Conference.\n\nMarin Sarvé-Tarr\n\nSelected Bibliography:\n\nGeorge Haydn Huntley, Andrea Sansovino, Sculptor and Architect of the Italian Renaissance (Westport: Greenwood Press, 1971).\n\nJoining the Department of Art in 1935, Ludwig Bachhofer was one of the first refugees from Nazi Germany to secure faculty appointments at the University of Chicago. Bachhofer belonged to the early generation of art historians in the West who dedicated their entire careers to the study of Asian art. He wrote widely on topics such as Japanese woodblock prints, Indian sculpture, Buddhist art, and Chinese bronzes. Many of Bachhofer’s publications were in German, but his A Short History of Chinese Art (1946) was written in English and became an important introductory text for many students of Chinese art.\n\nThe only student of Heinrich Wölfflin at the University of Munich whose doctoral work was concentrated solely on Asian art, Bachhofer’s formalist training made him particularly devoted to the history of stylistic development in Asian art. Following his mentor, he was interested in a dualistic approach of comparative analysis between the art of Europe and that of East Asia, beyond their cultural and historical differences. Bachhofer was perhaps one of the first art historians to employ Wöfflin’s principles for contrasting the formal qualities of Renaissance and Baroque art to that of Asian art, and he was also particularly interested in exploring Erwin Panofsky’s study of perspective in his own analysis of the development of pictorial space in Chinese painting.\n\nAlthough he never studied East Asian languages nor had the opportunity to travel to the East, his devotion to the study of the stylistic development in Asian art enlightened a generation of eminent historians in the field. Bachhofer’s students include Max Loehr, former professor of Asian art at Harvard University, who had studied with him in Munich, and Harrie Vanderstappen, who studied with Bachhofer at the University of Chicago and later succeeded him there.\n\nAnne Feng\n\nSelect Bibliography\n\nDie Frühindische Plastik.

New York: Pantheon, 1946\n\nUlrich A. Middeldorf was a German scholar of Renaissance art and history who emigrated to the United States in 1935. His scholarship spans the late medieval period to the Renaissance with a focus on 15th century Italian sculpture. While many of his contemporaries were focusing on monographic projects, Middeldorf spent his career publishing articles and catalogues on a great variety of objects, including stucco reliefs and paintings by unknown artists. His object-centered methodology emphasized artwork over artist. As a student in Berlin, he worked with the famed art historian Heinrich Wölfflin [1864-1945]. Middeldorf was hired at the University of Chicago in 1935 during an effort to recruit strong humanities scholars. John Shapley, the art history department’s Chair at the time, hired Middeldorf initially on a one year contract, but he quickly recognized the junior scholar’s talent and secured the funds to retain him as a tenured professor. Middeldorf later took over Shapley’s position as Department Chair and remained at the University of Chicago until 1953. He left to accept a directorship at the Kunshistorisches Institut in Florence, where he remained until the end of his career. Middeldorf’s Chicago years marked an exciting moment in the University’s history, particularly for the art history department, which included at the time such notable scholars as Edgar Wind and Otto von Simson. In Chicago, Middeldorf also worked actively to establish connections between the University and the city at large. He was named honorary curator at the Art Institute of Chicago and helped develop plans for the museum and the university to build a joint Center for Art Studies on Michigan Avenue. This project was never realized. In the 1940’s, Middeldorf also held a position on the board of directors at the South Side Community Art Center, a historic Bronzeville institution dedicated to the education and advancement of African American artists based in Chicago. Middeldorf died at the age of 81 in Florence.\n\nChloé Pelletier\n\nSelect Bibliography:\n\nBarocchi, Paola, editor. Raccolta di Scritti [collected writings]. 3 vols.

Wind also took classes with the Vienna School’s Max Dvorak, Julius Von Schlosser, and Josef Strzygowski. He additionally had a great interest in philosophy and studied the discipline under the likes of Martin Heidegger and Edmund Husserl. In 1924, fleeing the post-War economic depression plaguing Europe, Berlin-born Edgar Wind traveled to the United States and was granted the Graham Kenan Fellowship to teach Philosophy at the University of North Carolina. Here, Wind was first exposed to the semiotic philosophy of Charles Sanders Pierce.\n\nWhen Wind returned to Europe, he became a research assistant at the Warburg Library, which was then in Hamburg. There, like many of his generation, Wind came under the spell of Aby Warburg, with whom he not only founded the Journal of the Warburg and Courtauld Institute in 1937, but also collaborated to transfer the library to London from Germany, where it had been more vulnerable to Nazi destruction.\n\nWith the outbreak of the Second World War, Wind fled Europe once again to the United States. He first held a teaching position at The Institute of Fine Arts in New York and then spent two years on the Committee for Social Thought at The University of Chicago. At Chicago he was responsible for a substantial memorandum that discussed how art history and aesthetics could and should be integrated into the department’s official program. Wind then moved to Smith College, where he taught for eleven years, before becoming Oxford’s first art history professor in 1955.\n\nWind’s first book, Pagan Mysteries of the Renaissance, was a Warburgian explanation of the symbolic and iconological nature of Renaissance art, which he maintained could only be understood through the Neo-Platonic philosophy of Marsilio Ficino. Wind proposed that Christian and pagan symbolism were intertwined in the Renaissance, and that in order to fully understand—and thus, for Wind, to enjoy—Renaissance art, one had to be conversant in both symbolic vocabularies. In this work, the influence of the Vienna School is evident in its Riegelian assertion that art expressed ideas located in all areas of human creation. Pagan Mysteries is especially noted for its much-esteemed interpretation of Botticelli’s cryptic painting, La Primavera, and Wind’s undisputed identification of the figures therein.\n\nWind’s BBC radio lecture series Art and Anarchy, published in a volume by the same name, asserted that over time viewers had become desensitized to the subversive and visceral effects of art. Although this alienation from the work allowed for more pure scholarly analysis, it also rendered the work impotent. As an intervention, Wind suggested that art had to be discovered by both man’s intellectual and emotional capacities. Perhaps because of this belief, Wind championed the merits of contemporary art, believing that its tendency to be sometimes ostentatious and shocking was a reaction to viewer apathy.\n\nChris Zappella\n\nSelect Bibliography\n\nWind, Edgar. 1958.

Before arriving at the University of Chicago and the School of the Art Institute where he also taught classes, Giesbert was trained at the Vienna Academy and the Art Institute of Chicago. He became known for combining Impressionist and Expressionist styles in his boldly colored paintings, prints, and book illustrations. His work appeared in local and international annual exhibitions at the Art Institute of Chicago including The International Water Color Exhibition and The Annual Exhibition by Artists of Chicago and Vicinity in the 1920s and 1930s. On campus, he was featured in the 1939 exhibition Edmund Giesbert: Drawings and Paintings at the Renaissance Society where he also hosted gallery talks and free sketch classes for students. In addition to teaching, Giesbert actively participated in exhibitions and public lectures in Chicago and won the Mr. and Mrs. Frank G. Logan Prize awarded by the Committee on Painting and Sculpture of the Art Institute of Chicago for Uphill in 1929. His paintings can be found in Chicago collections, including a 1932 portrait of University of Chicago Anatomy Professor Robert R. Bensley commissioned by the University Board of Trustees. Giesbert’s book illustrations also appeared in widely used educational texts in the 1930s and 1940s such as Peter Hagboldt and F. W. Kaufmann’s Basic German Reader (1943) and Louis H. Limper’s adapted and edited edition of Alphonse Daudet’s 1868 memoir Le Petit Chose (1934).\n\nMarin Sarvé-Tarr\n\nSelect Bibliography:\n\nPeter Hagboldt and F. W.

He received his BA from Princeton University in 1936, his MA in Philosophy, also from Princeton University (1941), and his PhD in Art History from the University of Chicago (1955). Dowley’s work focused on French Baroque art, and he was specifically interested in making visible understudied aspects of the Baroque period. Dowley spent his entire career at the University of Chicago and became a full professor in 1974.\n\nDowley was an active member in multiple international and American art history organizations, including the American Society for Eighteenth Century Studies, the College Art Association of America, and La Société de l’Histoire de l’Art français. Dowley published extensively on French art, but preferred to write articles and essays rather than books. Several of his well-known pieces include “Thoughts on Poussin, time, and narrative: The Israelites gathering manna in the desert” and “The Iconography of Poussin's Painting Representing Diana and Endymion.” His work was highly regarded for its creative, unique approach to French art that remained innovative throughout his career. Dowley passed away in 2003 in Chicago. At the time of his death he was a Professor Emeritus in the Art History Department. Dowley was known for his dedication to the University of Chicago and his students.\n\nAngie Epifano\n\nSelected Bibliography\n\nDowley, Francis H. \"The Iconography of Poussin's Painting Representing Diana and Endymion.\" Journal of the Warburg and Courtauld Institutes 36 (1973): 305-18.\n\nDowley, Francis H. \"Thoughts on Poussin, Time, and Narrative: The Israelites Gathering Manna in the Desert.\" Simiolus: Netherlands Quarterly for the History of Art 25, no. 4 (1997): 329-48.\n\nSchonwald, John. “Historian of French Art Francis H.

Primarily known for her contributions to English manuscript studies and the study of English medieval art more broadly, she also worked as a code breaker during World War II and contributed to a long-running research project devoted to the life and work of the medieval poet, Geoffrey Chaucer, undertaken by her sister Edith Rickert (herself a member of the University's English Department).\n\nBorn in 1888 in LaGrange, Illinois, Margaret Rickert was one of two daughters to Francis E. Rickert and Josephine Newburgh (Rickert). She graduated from Grinell College (Iowa) in 1910 and initially pursued a career as a high school principal in Greene, Iowa until a trip to Europe in 1914 piqued Rickert’s interest in art history and prompted her to apply for a job in the photographic department of the Ryerson Library at the Art Institute of Chicago, which she began in 1922. During a subsequent trip to Europe, she assisted her sister, Edith Rickert, by researching medieval manuscripts containing texts of Chaucer's The Canterbury Tales. Soon thereafter, Margaret Rickert made research a full-time pursuit when, in Italy, she assisted Mary Berenson, wife of the Renaissance scholar Bernard Berenson, in revising his Italian Painters of the Renaissance (eventually published in 1930). Berenson’s commitment to stylistic formal analysis seems to have had a strong influence on Rickert’s own writing.\n\nReturning to the United States in 1928, Rickert first earned an MA in Art History at the University of Chicago (1933) and then a doctorate (1938); she was then immediately hired by the University. Upon the United States' entry into WWII, Margaret Rickert took a brief hiatus from academic work: relocating to Washington, D.C., she worked for the Army Signal Corps as a code breaker. She retired from the University of Chicago in 1953, but briefly returned to teaching between 1958-60. Following a massive flood in Florence in 1966, Rickert went to Italy to help restore damaged artworks. Sadly, she soon thereafter suffered a stroke and had to return to Grinell, where she died in 1973.\n\nRickert's doctoral thesis, which was eventually published as The Reconstructed Carmelite Missal: An English Manuscript of the Late XIV Century in the British Museum (1952) was a rigorous, yet highly experimental and daring reconstruction of a manuscript that was likely the first illuminated Carmelite missal produced in England, but which survived only as an overwhelming profusion of small fragments pasted into a scrapbook by a previous owner’s three children (the children has spelled out their names with the manuscript's illuminated initials). Rickert's meticulous, innovative reconstruction was a true feat of method and scholarly creativity, a major contribution not only to medieval art history, but also to manuscript studies more broadly. Rickert's other publications of note include La Miniature Anglaise and Painting in Britain: The Middle Ages, a volume in the Pelican History of Art series which earned Rickert the distinction at the time of being the first American and the only female to author a volume in the original series.\n\nNancy Thebaut\n\nSelected Bibliography\n\nRickert, Margaret.

Appointed to the Committee on Social Thought, he occasionally taught classes in the Department of Art. He was promoted to the rank of full professor in 1951, served as the committee’s Executive Secretary, edited Measure: A Critical Journal and, in 1946, helped found the Committee for Aid to German and Austrian Scholars. While at the university he published articles on Gothic architecture and Netherlandish painting, as well as two important books: Sacred Fortress: Byzantine Art and Statecraft in Ravenna (1948) and The Gothic Cathedral: Origins of Gothic Architecture and the Medieval Concept of Order (1956). Both texts attempted to place medieval works in the context of their time, attending to elements of liturgical, political, and intellectual history. The latter contributed to the understanding of medieval light mysticism and argued the significance of St-Denis, alongside seminal works by Hans Sedlmayr and Erwin Panofsky. Although controversial it remains widely read, and new editions of both texts were printed by Princeton University Press. Von Simson worked hard to place émigré scholars in Western institutions and helped broker the Frankfurt-University of Chicago Exchange program. He left the university in 1957 to teach in Frankfurt; his letters and diaries express a deep sense of obligation to post-war Germany, an obligation he met by taking a position in the Federal Ministry of Foreign Affairs and later serving as the German delegate to UNESCO. An obituary in Der Spiegel noted his life-long fondness for Berlin, and the city commemorated him by christening Otto-von-Simson-Straße.\n\nLuke A. Fidler\n\nA key figure in the field of Roman sculpture and wall painting, von Blanckenhagen was part of the wave of postwar refugee scholars who invigorated the study of art history in the United States. He earned his doctorate at the University of Munich in 1936 but faced increasing discrimination in Germany thanks to his Latvian citizenship. At the instigation of Otto von Simson, he left his position as docent at the University of Marburg to take a visiting professorship at the University of Chicago between 1947 and 1949. He was appointed a professor for the Committee on Social Thought and in the Department of Art in 1950, where he served for a decade punctuated by a visiting appointment at Harvard University in 1957. He spent most of his career at the Institute of Fine Arts at New York University, where he died as the Robert Lehman Professor Emeritus of Fine Arts. A legenday lecturer, von Blanckenhagen is best known for a seminal series of books and articles on Roman painting, including the Odyssey landscapes and the villa at Boscotrecase. He received the Gold Medal of the Archaeological Institute of America in 1982.\n\nLuke A. Fidler\n\nRosenthal joined the faculty of the department of art history at the University of Chicago in 1954, after completing his doctorate in art history at New York University in 1953. His dissertation on the Cathedral of Granada, Spain was turned into a monograph and published in 1961. In 1963, he received a Guggenheim grant, which culminated in two studies published in 1964: an Art Bulletin essay on the proportions of Michelangelo’s Moses sculpture for the tomb of Julius II and an article on the antique architectural models used in Bramante’s Tempietto. His scholarship is noted for his focus on the diffusion of style during the Renaissance in Europe and his careful scrutiny of form and architectural drawings. Today, his investigation of the transmission of Cinquecento forms to Northern European and Iberian courts remains a foundation for contemporary considerations of geography in the history of Renaissance art. Although his model spotlighted Italy, it opened the door to the study of the Renaissance as a trans-Atlantic phenomenon. Rosenthal authored a number of studies on the art and architecture of Renaissance Europe, particularly Spain, which include: “The Image of Roman Architecture in Renaissance Spain” (1958); The Cathedral of Granada: A Study in the Spanish Renaissance (1961); “Michelangelo's Moses, dal di sotto in su” (1964); “The Antecedents of Bramante’s Tempietto” (1964); “Plus Ultra, Non plus Ultra, and the Columnar Device of Emperor Charles V” (1971); “The Diffusion of the Italian Renaissance Style in Western European Art” (1978); The Palace of Charles V in Granada (1985).

Vanderstappen was professor of Chinese and Asian art history at the University of Chicago from 1959 to 1991. A life­long member of the Society of the Divine Word, a Roman Catholic missionary order, he was ordained as a priest in 1945 in the Netherlands. Assigned to missionary work in Beijing in 1947, he began to study Chinese art and culture first­hand and taught at Fu Jen University, associating important Sinologists until 1949. He received an M.A. in Art History in 1951 and a Ph.D. in 1955 from the University of Chicago studying with one of the greatest of the first generation of Asian art historians, Ludwig Bachhofer. Vanderstappen’s doctoral work on court painters of the Early Ming was one of the first works on Chinese art in the West that integrated in-depth research with original Chinese sources and examined the significance of Chinese institutional systems and art patronage.\n\nAfter teaching in Frankfurt, Germany and Nagoya, Japan, Vanderstappen was offered a position at the University as Prof. Bachhofer’s successor and taught generations of graduate students how to visually analyze art, stressing the importance of “visual-based methodologies”, such as detailed brushwork analysis, which he considered to be the starting point for understanding Chinese painting and its stylistic development. His connoisseurship of art was significant in the building of the core collection of East Asian art at the Smart Museum of Art.\n\nVanderstappen was an associate editor of the influential Sinological journal Monumenta Serica between 1958 and 1992, and also published renowned works on Chinese painting and sculpture, as well as a comprehensive book length bibliography of Western scholarship on Chinese art and archaeology. Prof. Vanderstappen is remembered at the University for his excellence in teaching. He received the College Art Association of America’s Distinguished Teaching of Art History Award in 1985, and in 1987, he received the University’s Burlington Northern Distinguished Teaching Award. In 1996, as a gift from one of his former students, Roger E. Covey created the Harrie Vanderstappen Distinguished Service Professorship.\n\nAnne Feng\n\nSelect Bibliography:\n\n“Painters at the Early Ming Court (1368-1435) and the Problem of a Ming Painting Academy”, Monumenta Serica XV (1956), pp.259-302; XVI (1957), pp.315-346\n\n(eds) The T.

Before arriving at Chicago, Taylor attended the Museum Art School in Portland and received a B.A. and M.A. from Reed College in Portland, Oregon. During his time at the University of Chicago, Taylor won the Llewellyn John and Harriet Manchester Quantrell Award for Excellence in Undergraduate Teaching in 1956 and became a Professor of Art History in the Department of Art in 1960. Taylor served as the William Rainey Harper Chair of Art History in 1963.\n\nTaylor’s versatile scholarship addressed nineteenth and twentieth-century painting, especially American and Italian, and art theory. In William Page, the American Titan (1957), the first book-length study of the painter, Taylor drew from unpublished sources to provide insight into the works themselves and into nineteenth-century artistic circles in New York, Boston, and Rome. His 1961 catalogue Futurism for a Museum of Modern Art exhibition helped to call public and scholarly attention to pre-war Italian art. Theories of Modern Art, co-edited with his former student, Peter Selz and with Herschel Chipp, was one of the first substantial, scholarly compilations of letters, manifestos, notes, and interviews from this period, offering a key resource of primary sources for teaching and research. Drawn upon his experiences of teaching undergraduates in the College at the University of Chicago, Taylor’s most popular and widely used book to this day is Learning to Look: A Handbook for the Visual Arts (1957), which introduces readers to artistic techniques and methodological approaches in the visual arts. Taylor was a founding member of the editorial board of Critical Inquiry in 1974, the year he left the University. During his final years of teaching the University of Chicago, Taylor was Director of the National Museum of American Art at the Smithsonian Institution (formerly named the National Collection of Fine Arts) from 1970-1981. The Joshua C. Taylor Fellowship now supports pre-doctoral and postdoctoral work with advisors at this museum.\n\nMarin Sarvé-Tarr\n\nSelect Bibliography\n\nJoshua C.

About this he would later say: \"I have hoped to enrich the literature on art and art history […] on periods either little-known or little-studied in America today. This has been, perhaps, my main motivation, and has led me into such abstruse areas of research as Baroque and Rococo Florentine art, the Baroque art of Central Europe, and the decorative arts of the Baroque period. Such was the lack of interest in English-speaking countries at the time I wrote them that two of my three major books were in Italian and a number of my articles in German.\" His commitment to the art of the Austro-Hungarian Empire was acknowledged with the Austrian Cross of Honor in Science and Art, First Class in 1974.\n\nHis professional career took off at the University of Kansas in 1953, first as a lecturer, and then in quick succession as assistant and associate professor of art. He also served as the director of the institution’s art museum, an activity he would return to later as the founding director of what is now known as the Smart Museum of Art at the University of Chicago. He returned to Chicago in 1961 to become a professor of Art History and immediately, for three years, also the chair of the department. During his tenure he also became professor of Germanic studies. He held the University museum position from 1972 to 1983.\n\nIt was in his double role a respected scholar, and a museum manager and curator that Maser was perhaps most important to the institution, but also to the field of art history at large. He took a broad view of what kinds of art a university art museum should collect and show. At the same time, he also understood art history not just as a cerebral pursuit, but as a profession with many facets that he worked tirelessly to promote, not least in the legendary dinner parties he and his wife Inge held regularly, invoking the atmosphere of fin-de-siècle Vienna.\n\nMax Koss\n\nSelect Bibliography\n\nGian Domenico Ferretti (Collana Pisana).

Greenhill was a Professor of Art History at the University of Chicago from 1959 to the late-1960s. In the 1960s she moved to the University of Texas at Austin, where she held the Ashbel Smith Professorship in Art History. Greenhill retired in 1985, but remained close to the University of Texas. In 1988 the University of Texas Department of Art and Art History announced the start of the Eleanor Greenhill Symposium. The Symposium is an annual graduate student symposium that shares graduate student research to the broad university community, and is in the spirit of Greenhill’s collegiality.\n\nGreenhill’s work focused on medieval French Gothic manuscripts, and she published several works in both English and German on this topic. She also worked on issues of speculation, Christian life and imagery, and symbolism within Christian art. In 1974 she published Dictionary of Art, which laid out major artists, themes, symbols, and periods in the history of Western art. Her work solidified her status as one of the seminal figures in modern art history.\n\nAngie Epifano\n\nSelected Bibliography\n\nBriscoe Center for American History. “A Guide to the Eleanor S.

A Chicago native, Kessler received his B.A. from the University of Chicago in 1961. Over the course of four years, he completed M.F.A and Ph.D. degrees at Princeton University. Kessler's dissertation, supervised by renowned Byzantinist Kurt Weitzmann, investigated ninth-century illuminated bibles and culminated in Kessler’s first book The Illustrated Bibles from Tours (1977) In it, Kessler focuses on four illuminated bibles, arguing that their visual similarities derive from a common prototype which he works to reconstruct.\n\nKessler’s scholarship, by and large, has explored the status of medieval images. A philological approach to visual sources, inherited in part from Weitzmann’s ‘picture criticism’, directed works like The Illustrated Bibles from Tours (1977) and The Frescoes of the Dura Synagogue & Christian Art (1990). Later publications such as Rome 1300: On the Path of the Pilgrim (2000) shifted focus towards reconstructing experiences as well as sources. In Seeing Medieval Art (2004) and Spiritual Seeing (2000) Kessler tackled a central question to the discipline— how does art render the invisible visible?—from many angles.\n\nOver the course of his long and fruitful career, Kessler has contributed to numerous edited volumes, symposia, and museum exhibitions. He maintains a career-long relationship with the Dumbarton Oaks research library and collection in Washington, D.C., where he conducted first research as a Junior Fellow between 1964 and 1965.\n\nIn 1965, Kessler returned to his alma mater, The University of Chicago, as an Assistant Professor in the Art History Department. He was promoted to Full Professor in 1973 and for the next three years served as Chair of the Department, a position which overlapped in 1975 with an appointment as University Director of Fine Arts.

He studied at the Freie Universität in Berlin and received his PhD in 1962 from Yale University, completing his dissertation on the history of French sculpture from Neoclassicism through Auguste Rodin. A renowned specialist of eighteenth- and nineteenth-century art known for his illuminating analysis of the theory and criticism of sculpture, painting, and drawing, de Caso has published widely. His books address many French Neoclassical and Romantic artists including David d’Angers, Théodore Géricault, Auguste Rodin, Théophile Bra, and James Pradier. In 1965, De Caso joined the faculty of the Department of Art and History of Art at the University of California Berkeley, where he is now Professor Emeritus of the History of Art. In addition to receiving a John Simon Guggenheim Memorial Foundation Fellowship in 1972, de Caso was an invited Professor at Harvard University from 1975-1976. While at Harvard, de Caso collaborated with Jeanne Wasserman on a key exhibition on serial sculptures at the Fogg Art Museum, Metamorphoses in Nineteenth-Century Sculpture (1975-1976). As an invited professor at the Collège de France in Paris from 1981-1982, he delivered a series of acclaimed public lectures entitled “David d’Angers et la sculpture de la generation romantique” [David d’Angers and the Sculpture of the Romantic Generation”]. Among his many publications, his important works include David d’Angers: Sculptural Communication in the Age of Romanticism (1992) and The Drawing Speaks: Théophile Bra, Works 1826-1855 (1997).\n\nMarin Sarvé-Tarr\n\nSelect Bibliography:\n\nJacques de Caso and Patricia B.

He is widely considered a foundational scholar of French Impressionism and Post-Impressionism. Rewald studied with Erwin Panofsky at the University of Hamburg, attended the University of Frankfurt, and intending to work on medieval art, went to France where he eventually completed a doctoral dissertation at the Sorbonne on Cézanne and Émile Zola. At the outbreak of the War, Rewald was briefly interned as an enemy alien in France. Rewald arrived in the U.S. in 1941 with the help of Alfred Barr, then director of the Museum of Modern Art in New York. Rewald’s interest in locating primary sources established a solid foundation for his scholarship that drew upon documents and interviews with late artists’ family members and dealers; his work continues to provide valuable resources for students and scholars of the nineteenth-century. In addition to curating key Impressionist exhibitions at MoMA, where he was appointed a trustee in 1983, Rewald was instrumental in saving Cézanne’s studio in Aix-en-Provence, which he helped transform into the still extant public museum, the Atelier Cézanne. His publications include the internationally renowned seminal texts The History of Impressionism (1946) and The History of Post-Impressionism, as well as thoroughly documented volumes on Paul Cézanne, Paul Gauguin, Pierre Bonnard, Pierre-Auguste Renoir, Edgar Degas, Georges Seurat, Camille Pissarro and Aristide Maillol. Rewald worked on two catalogue raisonné projects: Paul Cézanne: The Watercolors: A Catalogue Raisonné with Adrien Chapuis in 1983 and The Paintings of Paul Cézanne: A Catalogue Raisonné with Walter Feilchenfeldt and Jayne Warman (1996). While at the University of Chicago, Rewald lectured widely and organized an exhibition of one of the largest collections of approximately 100 of Edgar Degas’s etchings with fellow professor in the Department of Art, Paul Moses. Rewald’s papers are now held in the archives at the National Gallery of Art in Washington, D.C..\n\nMarin Sarvé-Tarr\n\nSelect Bibliography\n\nJohn Rewald, Cézanne: Sa vie, son oeuvre, son amitié pour Zola (Paris: A.

He was the first African-American student to attend Haverford College, where he completed a BA in French and Latin in 1951. While there he became a protégé of the collector Albert Barnes (Barnes Foundation, Philadelphia), who nurtured the young man’s interest in nineteenth-century French art. Moses went on to earn an MA from Harvard University in 1960 and began working toward a doctorate with a dissertation on the etchings and monotypes of French Impressionist Edgar Degas. He accepted a position as Instructor in the Department of Art in 1962, joining a small cohort of past and current Black faculty members at the University of Chicago.\n\nMoses taught courses on nineteenth-century French prints and “French Impressionism and its Aftermath.” He also led more general classes in the humanities, creating waves among the other instructors when he refused to continue teaching Mark Twain’s classic Huckleberry Finn because of the novel’s treatment of race. The eminent literary critic Wayne Booth, who began teaching at the university the same year as Moses, recounted the incident in his 1988 book The Company We Keep. Moses stated that he was deeply troubled by Twain’s portrayal of the character Jim, a Black man fleeing slavery, and argued that the novel’s distorted views of race were damaging to Black and white students alike. Booth acknowledged his initial discomfort with Moses’ (for the time) radical critiques and his later acceptance of their legitimacy, emphasizing the visionary nature of Moses’s interpretation.\n\nMoses quickly distinguished himself as a preeminent scholar of nineteenth-century reproductive media. He received an offer from the French publishing firm Arts et Métiers Graphiques to author a major catalogue raisonné of Degas’ lithographs, etchings, and monotypes based on his dissertation research. He also began in-depth studies of several related topics, including the prints of Charles Meyron, the caricatures of Honoré Daumier, and the early history of photography. He curated an important exhibition of Degas’ etchings at the Renaissance Society and wrote reviews for the arts section of the Chicago Daily News. He received a prestigious Whitney Foundation grant to conduct further research in France in 1963 and an Inland Steel Faculty Fellowship in 1964. In a series of memos to university administrators written in 1964, Harrie Vanderstappen, the acting chair of the Department of Art, enthused that Moses’ research and teaching were “outstanding” and that he had gained the wide respect of professors and students alike. In November 1964, the faculty unanimously voted to promote him to the rank of Assistant Professor of Art and of Humanities.\n\nIn 1966, at the age of 36, Moses’ life was tragically cut short when he was murdered by two young white men who intended to steal his car. The event devastated his family, friends, colleagues, and students, many of whom wrote letters and tributes that underscored his lasting impact on their lives. The work he had completed for his dissertation and book eventually formed the basis for Jean Adhémar and Françoise Cachin’s Degas: The Complete Etchings, Lithographs and Monotypes (1974). Moses was not listed among the catalogue’s authors, but its foreword, written by John Rewald––a scholar of French Impressionism who joined the University of Chicago in 1964––acknowledged that Adhémar’s sections on Degas’ etchings in particular drew heavily on Moses’ research. In 1983, an anonymous donor established the Paul B. Moses Scholarship Fund at Haverford College. It continues to be awarded annually to students “who [exemplify] the character, talent and qualities of Paul Moses.”\n\nStephanie Strother and Michael A.

He earned his undergraduate degree in his hometown at Mount Union College, and then attended the University of Chicago to study the walls of Ancient Greece for both his Master’s Degree (1934) and doctorate (1939). Scranton was a fellow at the American School of Classical Studies in Athens during his doctoral studies (1934-38) and returned for post-doctoral studies (1946-47) as well. During this time, Scranton worked mainly on the excavation of the fortifications of the Athenian Pnyx. Between fellowships, Scranton taught at Illinois College (1940) and Vassar College (1940-1946). In 1947, Scranton accepted a teaching post at Emory University, but returned to the School in Athens for the 1949 excavation of Corinth. Scranton later performed additional field work in Kourion, Kenchreai, Cyprus, and Yugoslavia. This work was supported by The University of Chicago, the Guggenheim Foundation, the National Endowment for the Humanities, and the American Council of Learned Societies, among others.\n\nIn 1961, Scranton left Emory for a professorship at The University of Chicago in classical art and archaeology. Scranton served as chair of the Art Department from 1969 to 1973. In 1977, he retired from the University of Chicago and moved to Decatur, Georgia, where he taught classes at both Emory University and Agnes Scott College. On 31 January 1993, Scranton died from complications due to pneumonia.\n\nScranton published over a dozen books and twenty-seven articles on issues related to ancient and medieval Greece and its environs His text book, Greek Architecture, which was published in 1962, was reprinted as recently as 2012.\n\nSince 1999, Scranton has been honored yearly by the Archaeological Institute of America through its annual Robert L.

He was born on 6 February 1946 in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, to parents Edgar Leo Armi and Emita Dember Armi. He studied Art History at Columbia College, Columbia University, where he earned his BA in 1967, followed by his Master’s degree, and in 1973, his PhD. His doctoral studies were supported by the Woodrow Wilson Foundation where he was a fellow from 1970 to 1972.\n\nThe University of Chicago was Armi’s first teaching post, where he joined the faculty in 1974. Armi stayed in Hyde Park until 1977, when he was offered an associate professorship at the University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill. In 1980, Armi published his first book, Saint-Philibert at Tournus and Wall Systems of First Romanesque Architecture, followed only three years later by a second book, Masons and Sculptors in Renaissance Burgundy. Both texts focused on Romanesque construction methods. Armi then produced a number of publications on twentieth-century car design. In 1991, he married Mary Elizabeth Spear, and a year later the couple moved to Santa Barbara where Armi joined the faculty of the University of California, where he remains today.\n\nArmi has been awarded a number of awards, including the Society of Architectural Historians’ Founders Award, the International Confederation of Art and Antique Dealers Association Art History Prize, and a Guggenheim Fellowship. The latter resulted in the book Design and Construction in Romanesque Architecture. Armi continues to publish scholarship on Romanesque art as well as American car design\n\nChris Zappella\n\nSelected Bibliography:\n\nArmi, Clement Edson. 2012.

Rosenberg was trained as a lawyer at St. Lawrence University in Brooklyn in 1927, but often described himself as self-educated at the New York Public Library. As a prolific leftist art critic, thinker, and poet, Rosenberg became most well known for his phrase, “action painting” that challenged fellow critic Clement Greenberg’s aesthetic formalist reading of Abstract Expressionists such as Jackson Pollock, Willem de Kooning, and Franz Kline. Rosenberg emphasized painters’ existential expressive gestures in which the canvas serves as “an arena in which to act” in his canonical 1952 Art News article “The American Action Painters,” later reprinted in his 1959 collected volume The Tradition of the New. His text was one of the first to group the Abstract Expressionists into a cohesive group of practitioners for the American public. His foundational work also had a notable impact on later performance and Fluxus artists such as Allan Kaprow who adapted the terminology of action painting to his multi-media performances.\n\nBefore arriving at the University of Chicago, Rosenberg contributed to literary, arts, and public publications and programs. Rosenberg became interested in abstraction while working in the Mural Division of the Works Progress Administration (WPA) in 1933 where he would meet de Kooning and would later serve as an art editor for the American Guide Series from 1938-1942. While many of his early writings for small leftist magazines such as The Partisan Review reached a limited audience, Rosenberg became widely known to the American public as an art critic for The New Yorker from 1967-1978 while teaching at the University of Chicago. Rosenberg was awarded the Frank Jewett Mather Award for Criticism from the College Art Association in 1964. Rosenberg’s papers can be found at the Getty Research Institute in Los Angeles and with his wife May Tabak’s papers at the Archives of American Art at the Smithsonian Institution in Washington, D.C..\n\nMarin Sarvé-Tarr\n\nSelect Bibliography\n\nHarold Rosenberg, The Tradition of the New (New York: Horizon Press, 1959).\n\n———, The Anxious Object: Art Today and its Audience (New York: Horizon Press, 1964).\n\n———, Act and the Actor: Making the Self (New York: World Pub.

He became an assistant professor in 1978, the same year he received his PhD from Harvard University with a dissertation on Francesco Borromini’s Oratorio dei Filippini in Rome. Prior to his doctoral studies at Harvard and his appointment at Chicago, Connors earned an A.B. from Boston College in 1966, and a second B.A. in 1968 as a Marshall Scholar at Clare College, Cambridge University. Since 2002, he has been a professor of Renaissance and Baroque architecture in the Department of the History of Art and Architecture at Harvard.\n\nIn 1980, Connors was appointed as an associate professor of art history at Columbia University. He became a full professor in 1982, and remained there until joining the faculty at Harvard. During his time at Columbia, his courses covered topics ranging from Renaissance and Baroque urban planning and gardens, to the relationship between reading and architecture in early modern libraries, and classical idioms in architecture. In 2001, he won the university’s President’s Award for Outstanding Teaching.\n\nConnors has maintained an equally dedicated commitment to research, publishing widely on seventeenth-century Rome. His first book, Borromini and the Roman Oratory: Style and Society, won the 1984 Krautheimer Medal, a prize awarded for distinguished scholarship in the history of architecture, named after the famed scholar Richard Krautheimer. Also in 1984, Connors published The Robie House of Frank Lloyd Wright, a book project he began while at the University of Chicago, where the famous Wright building is located.\n\nTwo important administrative positions punctuated Connors’s active teaching and research as a foremost specialist in early modern Rome. He served as Director of the American Academy in Rome from 1988 to 1992, then as Director of the Villa I Tatti in Florence from 2002 to 2010. Since then, Connors has focused on undergraduate teaching at Harvard, where he offers courses on the history of Rome, the Vatican, and architectural landmarks worldwide.\n\nNora Lambert\n\nSelect Bibliography\n\nBorromini and the Roman Oratory: Style and Society, New York and Cambridge, Mass.: The Architectural History Foundation and M.I.T.

Shelton earned her BA from Smith College followed by two Master’s degrees as well as her doctorate at Columbia University where, from 1970-73, she was also appointed to the faculty as a lecturer in art and archaeology. In 1975, Shelton, then ABD (all-but-dissertation) joined the faculty of the University of Chicago, becoming an assistant professor in 1977. A year later, she completed her dissertation, “The Esquiline Treasure: Its Art and Historical Position.” In 1983, the same year that she won the College Art Association’s coveted Porter Prize for best original article in the field of Art History, Shelton was promoted to associate professor. From 1985 to 1988, she served as the Dean of the Humanities Division followed by a year as Chair of the Art Department. Shelton then took a year’s leave and, after a long battle with cancer, passed away in 1990 at the age of forty-three.\n\nShelton’s dissertation became the basis of her 1981 book, The Esquiline Treasure. This important revisionist history focused on luxury objects in a horde of silver treasures found on the Esquiline Hill, which are now located in the British Museum. Shelton demonstrated that these objects were created several decades earlier than traditionally believed, a discovery that shed new light on civic and religious life in the late Roman/ Early Christian world. Although controversial at the time, much of Shelton’s research on the treasure was confirmed posthumously by Ronald T. Ridley, and the British Museum continues to accept her earlier dating.\n\nDespite the brevity of her life, Shelton published widely on issues related to the art of Late Antiquity, including work on consular diptychs as well as continued research on the Esquiline Treasure.\n\nChris Zappella\n\nSelected bibliography:\n\nThe Esquiline Treasure: Its Art and Historical Position.

At the University of Chicago, Seidel was named inaugural Hannah Holborn Gray Professor in Art History.\n\nA specialist in European medieval art, Seidel has made important contributions to the study of Romanesque sculpture, northern European Renaissance painting, and critical methodologies. Romanesque Sculpture from the Cathedral of St-Etienne, Toulouse (1977) offered a radical reappraisal of the cathedral's sculpture as a nineteenth-century invention, overturning a century of scholarship. Songs of Glory: The Romanesque Façades of Aquitaine (1981) examined the ornamentation of small churches built in southwest France during the eleventh and twelfth centuries, importantly connecting analyses of form, content, and patronage. Her study of Jan van Eyck’s so-called Arnolfini Portrait (1993) brought a multiplicity of interpretive modes to the much-studied painting. Legends in Limestone: Lazarus, Gislebertus, and the Cathedral of Autun (1999) challenged long established narratives concerning artistry and authorship in medieval architectural sculpture. Significant early career encounters with Erwin Panofsky and Schapiro helped to animate Seidel’s interest in the critical writing of art history, and in 2006, she edited Schapiro’s Charles Eliot Norton Lectures on Romanesque architectural sculpture for publication.\n\nDuring her tenure at the University of Chicago, Seidel won numerous awards for teaching and research, frequently collaborating both with her colleagues in the department and the Smart Museum of Art. Notably, her interrogation of visual pedagogy resulted in the exhibition and accompanying catalogue Looking to Learn: Visual Pedagogy at the University of Chicago (a collaborative venture with Katherine Fischer Taylor). Seidel retired in 2004, and currently serves as Hanna Holborn Gray Professor Emerita of Art History.\n\nLuke Fidler\n\nSelect Bibliography\n\nSeidel, Linda. “On Telling Tales.” The Art Bulletin 76.4 (December 1994): 581-83.\n\nReinhold Heller was born in 1940 in Fulda, Germany. Heller earned both his Master’s degree and PhD in Art History and Comparative Literature from Indiana University, Bloomington, which he attended from1963 to 1968. His dissertation focused on the art of Norwegian artist Edward Munch. Heller then joined the Fine Arts faculty at the University of Pittsburgh as an assistant professor. The following year, he was the first person to win the René d’Harncourt Fellowship at the Lillie P. Bliss International Study Center of the Museum of Modern Art. Heller left Pittsburgh in 1978 to join the faculties of Art History and Germanic Studies at the University of Chicago. He remained on the faculty for over thirty years, until he retired in 2008. Heller is now an emeritus professor of both of his former departments.\n\nHeller’s scholarship focuses on the intersection of social and psychological worlds. He published his first book, Edvard Munch: The Scream in 1973, which proved to be a seminal work in Munch Studies. He followed this with his 1984 monograph, Munch: His Life and His Work in 1984. In addition to scholarship on the Norwegian artist, Heller has published widely on all areas of German Art, from Symbolism, to Nazi art, to German Expressionism. In 1987 he authored Hildegard Auer: A Yearning for Art, and, in 2002, he curated the show “Confronting Identities in German Art: Myths, Reactions, Reflections” at the Smart Museum of Art, and also authored its eponymous catalogue. In the exhibition and the text, Heller explored the question: what does it mean to be German? Heller also curated the Neue Galerie’s 2010 show, “The Birth of Expressionism: Brücke in Dresden and Berling 1905-1913. This was the first major exhibition in the United States to focus on these experimental German artists.

She remains there today, as Associate Professor of Art History and East Asian Languages and Cultures.\n\nBurkus has published numerous articles, book chapters, and catalogue essays on painting and woodblock-printed books from the late Ming Dynasty, specifically examining self-representation, the word-image relationship, optics, and materiality. In 2010, the Harvard Asia Center published her first book, Through a Forest of Chancellors: Fugitive Histories in Liu Yuan’s Lingyan ge, an Illustrated Book from Seventeenth-Century Suzhou. Burkus is the 2017-18 Ailsa Mellon Bruce Senior Fellow at the Center for Advanced Studies in the Visual Arts (CASVA) at the National Gallery of Art, Washington.

Stafford earned her undergraduate degree from Northwestern University, majoring in continental philosophy and comparative literature. She followed this with a year of Philosophy at the Sorbonne. After this sojourn, Stafford returned to Northwestern University for a Master’s in Art History and a subsequent doctorate in the subject from the University of Chicago. Her studies were supported by a fellowship from the American Association of University Women at the Warburg Institute in London. There, she came under the mentorship of Ernst Gombrich, who supervised her dissertation. Her first teaching post was in 1969 as assistant professor at the National College of Education. She left this position for Loyola University Chicago, but only a year later moved to the University of Delaware where she remained for almost a decade. In 1981, she joined the University of Chicago faculty as a full professor, earning in 1995 the title of William B. Ogden Distinguished Service Professor, which she held until her retirement in 2010. She was a member of the University of Chicago Society of Fellows from 2001 to 2007. She continues to teach as a distinguished visiting professor at the Georgia Institute of Technology and is an emerita professor of the University of Chicago.\n\nStafford has published extensively on issues relating to technologies of visual representation from Early Modernity to the digital world, focusing heavily on performance and the embodiment of human experience. This was evident in her 2002 Getty exhibition and catalogue, \"Devices of Wonder: From the World in a Box to Images on a Screen,\" which won the Katharine Kyes Leab & Daniel J. Leab American Book Prizes Current Exhibition Award in 2003. Her recent work investigates the ways in which neuroscience can be used as an art historical tool.\n\nStafford has been the recipient of numerous accolades, including honorary degrees from multiple international universities. She additionally received prestigious fellowships from the National Endowment for the Humanities, the Guggenheim, The Getty Research Institute, The University of Melbourne, the Wissenschaftskolleg zu Berlin, USC Los Angeles, and SUNY Buffalo. Her book awards include the American Society for Eighteenth-Century Studies Clifford Prize, the CAA Millard Meiss Publication Award, the Gottschalk Prize, The Michelle Kendrick Memorial Book Prize, and the Thomas N.
