For Lyles, a repeat of bronze in Tokyo just won’t do.\n\nMarchand giving the hometown crowd lots to cheer for\n\nA week ago, hometown hero Leon Marchand had no Olympic medals. And now, with his fourth gold, which he claimed in the 200M IM, he's among the most decorated French swimmers. He is now tied for the most gold medals of any French Summer Olympian, it's a four-way tie that includes Teddy Riner who also won his fourth gold today, and can win his fifth tomorrow\n\nMarchand is the first person to sweep both IM races since Michael Phelps did so in 2004 and 2008. (Marchand and Phelps do share a coach, Bob Bowman.)\n\nTHe French swimmer is only the fourth swimmer to win four individual races in one Games. Michael Phelps did it twice — in 2004 and 2008; Mark Spitz in 1972; and Kristin Otto in 1988 have done so.\n\nPhelps won five individual races in 2008.\n\nAustralia’s McKeown rules the Olympic backstroke\n\nIt's a backstroke sweep for Australia's Kaylee McKeown. When she touched the wall first in the 200M backstroke today, it was a repeat of her Tokoyo 100-200 sweep.\n\nShe's only the third woman to win the 200M event twice.\n\nShe now has six career Olympic medals, five golds and a bronze. and becomes the first Australian swimmer to win four individual swimming events.\n\nWith her silver-worthy performance in the race, American Regan Smith claimed her sixth Olympic medal.\n\nKylie Masse of Canada took bronze, and American Phoebe Bacon just missed the podium with her fourth-place finish.\n\nCaeleb Dressel gets emotional after coming up short\n\nBack-to-back losses left Caeleb Dressel crying on the pool deck after his last individual event at the Paris Olympics ended in heartbreak.\n\nDressel placed sixth in the men’s 50-meter freestyle final, an event he set an Olympic record for in Tokyo.\n\nThen, less than an hour later, Dressel missed the final for the 100-meter butterfly. At the Summer Games in 2021, his gold medal-winning time of 49.45 seconds set an Olympic and world record, which still stands.\n\n“It was very obviously not my best work,” Dressel said after the races. “It hasn’t been my best week. I don’t think I need to shy away from that. But the racing has been really fun here. Walking out for the the 50 and the 100 fly, it was special. I don’t want to ever forget that. I’d like to be quicker, obviously. Not my week.”\n\nAfter the losses, Dressel was visibly crying on the pool deck. After giving someone a long hug, he was filmed wiping his eyes, which were stained red.\n\n“So sad to see the tears from Caeleb Dressel. These athletes work so hard for these moments and it has to be devastating to not bring your best when it matters the most,” one viewer wrote on X.\n\n“If they could get the camera off of Caeleb Dressel while he falls apart here, that’d be great. That was devastating to watch,” another wrote.\n\nAfter a few minutes, Dressel moved out of view of cameras.\n\nOnline, people expressed gratitude for the Olympian’s accomplishments.\n\n“Cheers for the coach who helped get Caeleb Dressel to some privacy. Disappointment is hard. I hope he knows how much the US is still SO proud of him,” one person said.\n\n“Say what you will about the cameraman filming #CalebDressel at the #Olympics, but as a mom to 3 boys, it’s a great example to show that even grown men can have emotions, disappointment, and cry. Hope his wife got to him and gave him a hug from all of us watching,” another viewer wrote.\n\nDressel could swim in two more events in Paris: the 4x100-meter mixed medley relay final, set for Aug. 3, and the men’s 4x100 medley relay.\n\nIn the mixed medley, Team USA finished in first in its preliminary heat Friday, led by Regan Smith swimming backstroke, Charlie Swanson swimming breaststroke, Dressel swimming butterfly, and Abbey Weitzeil swimming freestyle. The preliminary heat for the men’s medley relay is set for Aug. 3.\n\nSo far in Paris, Dressel has won one medal: gold for the men’s 4x100-meter freestyle relay.\n\nThe Olympian has eight medals total, all of them gold.\n\nSnoop Dogg joins the U.S. men's rowing team celebration party\n\nThe U.S. men's rowing team won gold for the first time since the 1960 Games in Rome. To celebrate the win, special guest Snoop Dogg stopped by and held one of the gold medals.\n\n\"Let me see what that gold looks like!\" Snoop said.\n\nOne of the medalists told Snoop about the medal, which is encrusted with a piece of iron from the Eiffel Tower.\n\n\"So you're taking a piece of Paris home with you?\" Snoop said. \"This is special.\"\n\nSimone Biles now has the diamonds to go with all that gold\n\nSimone Biles has long been nicknamed a “GOAT” — or the “Greatest Of All Time.” Now, she has an accessory to match the acronym.\n\nThe American gymnast, who became the most decorated American gymnast in the history of the Olympic Games this week, drew praise from fans online after showing off a new necklace alongside her gold medal.\n\nThe white gold necklace, which she clung onto proudly while on the podium on Thursday, is a diamond-covered goat. It was custom made for the Olympian by Janet Heller, founder and CEO of Janet Heller Fine Jewelry in Calabasas, Calif.\n\n“She reached out to us about five weeks ago to say that she wanted to do a goat necklace,” Heller told NBC News. Biles didn’t give Heller too many specifics, she said, and so the jeweler went through “several iterations” of the goat before landing on the final design.\n\n“What she didn’t know we would be doing, which was a huge surprise to her, was that we made it 3D,” Heller said. The necklace has 546 diamonds.\n\nRead more about the necklace here.\n\nJudo: French TV commentators can't hold themselves back during Teddy Riner's win\n\nJudoka Teddy Riner won an unprecedented fourth judo gold and a sixth medal overall in front of a rowdy crowd.\n\nFrench TV commentators couldn't contain their excitement as they called Riner's win.

I haven't gone back to the cafeteria in like five days.\"\n\nBiles said she's been going to the store instead to stock up on food, but otherwise stays in her room.\n\n\"It gets me so anxious,\" Biles said of the attention.\n\nAlcaraz and Djokovic will have a gold medal rematch\n\nAfter meeting in the Wimbledon final just a few weeks ago, Novak Djokovic and Carlos Alcaraz will go head-to-head on Sunday for a gold medal.\n\nDjokovic can become the fifth player to ever complete the “Golden Slam” — winning all four Grand Slam titles and gold at the Olympics. The 37-year-old would be the oldest player to win the Olympic singles tournament since 1908. Olympic gold is the only thing missing from his trophy case. He has won 24 Grand Slam titles — the most of any man in history.\n\nAlcaraz, 21, looks to become the youngest man to win the singles tournament at the Olympics. American Vincent Richards holds the record (21 years, 115 days), taking home gold in Paris in 1924.\n\nSoccer: France defeats Argentina 1-0, advance to men's semifinal\n\nFrance defeated Argentina 1-0, sealing a place in the men's semifinal.\n\nThe rematch of the 2022 World Cup final saw the host nation score early in the 5th minute, courtesy of Jean-Philippe Mateta. A second goal from France in the 83rd minute was ruled off, after a VAR check found France's Maghnes Akliouche fouled Argentina's defender shortly before the goal.\n\nDespite Argentina dominating possession of the game and having more shots on target, France capitalized in key moments to advance.\n\nFrance will face Egypt on Monday for a chance to play for gold. The second semi has Morocco playing 2020 Olympic silver medalist Spain.\n\nAmerica scores 3x3 basketball win, back into medal hunt\n\nReporting from Paris\n\nCanyon Barry scored a game-high 14 points and knocked down the walk-off jumper as the United States beat China, 21-17, to keep its hopes for a medal alive.\n\nThe United States, left for dead at 0-4, won twice today and is now in a 2-4 tie with France and Poland for fifth place.\n\nThe top six move to elimination play.\n\nThe U.S. is playing without prolific scorer Jimmer Fredette who hurt his leg earlier in the day. He was in uniform but did not get into the game against China.\n\nSoccer: France has goal ruled out after VAR check\n\nMaghnes Akliouche found Michael Olise in the box during the 83rd minute for what would've been a 2-0 lead over Argentina.

The second semifinal match has Spain taking on Morocco.\n\nTrack: In men's 10k final, Ugandan Cheptegei signs off in style\n\nand\n\nUganda’s Joshua Cheptegei signed off in style, finishing what he has hinted to be the final track race of his career with a gold medal and an Olympic record of 26:43.14.\n\nThe world champion and world record holder hung out in the back of the lead pack for most of the race, but pushed past the leading Ethiopian runners to take home the gold.\n\nThe race happened at breakneck speed. During any other year, the top 13 finishers of the race would have all set Olympic records. All of them ran under the previous Olympic record of 27:01.\n\nCheptegei is expected to hang up his spikes and turn to the marathon after the Paris Games.\n\nEthiopia’s Berihu Aregawi came in second and America's Grant Fisher ran a season best to take home the bronze. Fisher is the first American to medal in the 10,000 meters since Galen Rupp won the silver at the 2012 London Games.\n\nCheptegei and Fisher both ran very smart races, rarely moving off the rail until the last 600 meters of the race.\n\nYomif Kejelcha, who had the best time of the year, was a favorite coming into the race but was ultimately denied a medal.

Social media users began ascribing words like \"savage\" and \"unhinged\" to Elmo, the typically cute and cuddly character.\n\nSince then, the ongoing battle between Elmo and Rocco has been a favorite among the extremely online. Rocco, literally a pet rock who does not speak or move, belongs to Elmo's friend Zoë. The disagreement between Elmo and Rocco originated from Zoë treating Rocco like a living, breathing friend while Elmo often reminds those around him that \"Rocco’s just a rock! Rocco’s not alive!”\n\nSo Elmo appeared dismayed in a clip shared by the \"TODAY' Show, in which he realized Rocco was also in attendance at the Olympics.\n\n\"Elmo's here with the \"TODAY\" show for the Paris Olympic Games,\" Elmo declared in the video, in which he is wearing a beret and standing in front of the Eiffel Tower. \"Elmo's hoping to see some really cool people.\"\n\nThe camera then panned down, revealing Rocco was sitting just below Elmo.\n\n\"Oh, great,\" Elmo muttered in disappointment as he laid eyes on Rocco.\n\nIn a post to X, Elmo reminded everyone that Rocco was not eligible for the Olympics.\n\n“Rocco is just a rock, he can’t win an Olympic medal!” Elmo wrote.\n\nElmo and Rocco were not immediately available to comment on the feud or the Paris Olympics.\n\nOpening ceremony artistic director files complaint\n\nand\n\nParis prosecutors said the artistic director of the opening ceremony lodged a complaint on Tuesday alleging online harassment, public insults, death threats and defamation in relation to his origins and sexual orientation.\n\nThe Paris Prosecutor's office said that the director, Thomas Jolly, said ”he was the target of threatening and insulting messages on social networks criticizing his sexual orientation and his wrongly assumed Israeli origins.” The investigation was referred to the French Central office for combating crimes against humanity and hate crimes “given the national dimension of the messages sent,” the Paris Prosecutor’s office said in a statement.\n\nParis Mayor Anne Hidalgo reacted and expressed her “unwavering support” to Jolly, adding that he carried “our values high” and that “Paris was proud and honored to count on his talent to celebrate our city.”\n\nSeveral artists and performers of the opening ceremony have been exposed to strong backlash after some viewers interpreted a scene in the “Festivities” segment as mocking “The Last Supper” and took offense. Jolly however denied taking inspiration from the da Vinci painting showing Jesus and his apostles, saying that it was meant to refer to the gods of Olympus.\n\nThe French DJ Barbara Butch, who took part in the “Festivities” segment, took legal action this week, saying she was the target of numerous antisemitic, homophobic and sexist insults and was threatened with death, torture and rape.
