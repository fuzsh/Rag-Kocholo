        "text": "The chancellor of the German Empire is the political leader of Germany and the head of the federal government. The office holder is responsible for selecting all other members of the government and chairing cabinet meetings. The incumbent is Konrad Adenauer, who serves as the 14th person in the office.\n\nThe office was created in the North German Confederation in 1867, when Otto von Bismarck became the first chancellor. With the unification of Germany and establishment of the German Empire in 1871, the Confederation evolved into a German nation-state and its leader became known as the chancellor of Germany. Originally, the chancellor was only responsible to the emperor. This changed with the constitutional reforms in 1918, when the Parliament was given the right to dismiss the chancellor, and the emperor's role was diminished.\n\nAfter the end of World War II in 1945, constitutional reforms were expanded by Theodor Heuss' government. The reforms created the current set provinces, and further diminished the role of the emperor. The modern chancellor's role is defined by the 1945 Basic Act.\n\nList[]\n\nPolitical party identification (in order of appearance)\n\nUnaffiliated\n\nCentre\n\nDemocratic\n\nSocial Democratic Party\n\n† denotes those who died while in office\n\n# Name Image Tenure Monarch[a] 1 Otto von Bismarck\n\n(1815-1898) 21 March 1871\n\n–\n\n20 March 1890\n\n(18 years, 364 days)\n\nWilhelm I\n\n(r. 1871-1888)\n\nFriedrich III\n\n(r. 1888) 2 Leo von Caprivi\n\n(1831-1899) 20 March 1890\n\n–\n\n26 October 1894\n\n(4 years, 220 days)\n\nWilhelm II\n\n(r. 1888-1941) Office vacant from 26 October until 29 October 1894. 3 Chlodwig zu\n\nHohenlohe-\n\nSchillingsfürst\n\n(1819-1901) 29 October 1894\n\n–\n\n17 October 1900\n\n(5 years, 353 days) 4 Bernhard von Bülow\n\n(1856-1921) 17 October 1900\n\n–\n\n14 July 1909\n\n(8 years, 270 days) 5 Theobald von\n\nBethmann Hollweg\n\n(1849-1929) 14 July 1909\n\n–\n\n19 January 1919\n\n(9 years, 189 days) 6 Friedrich von Payer\n\n(1847-1931) 19 January 1919\n\n–\n\n4 May 1924\n\n(5 years, 106 days) 7 Oskar Hergt\n\n(born 1869) 4 May 1924\n\n–\n\n7 December 1924\n\n(217 days) 8 Gustav Stresemann\n\n(1878-1929) 7 December 1924\n\n–\n\n3 October 1929 †\n\n(4 years, 300 days) 9 Erich Koch-Weser\n\n(1875-1944) 3 October 1929\n\n–\n\n14 September 1930\n\n(346 days) 10 Heinrich Brüning\n\n(born 1885) 14 September 1930\n\n–\n\n31 July 1932\n\n(1 year, 321 days) 11 Adolf Hitler\n\n(born 1889) 31 July 1932\n\n–\n\n8 November 1936\n\n(4 years, 100 days) 12 Alfred Hugenberg\n\n(1865-1951) 8 November 1936\n\n–\n\n4 November 1945\n\n(8 years, 361 days)\n\nWilhelm III\n\n(r. 1941-1951) 13 Theodor Heuss\n\n(born 1884) 4 November 1945\n\n–\n\n6 November 1949\n\n(4 years, 2 days) 14 Konrad Adenauer\n\n(born 1876) 6 November 1949\n\n–\n\nIncumbent\n\n(4 years, 56 days)\n\nWilhelm IV\n\n(r. 1951)\n\nLouis Ferdinand\n\n(r. since 1951)"
