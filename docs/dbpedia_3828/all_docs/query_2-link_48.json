        "text": "Gary Lee Otto was born on November 3, 1939 in Redwood Falls, Minnesota, the first born son of Stanley M. Otto and Hazel M. (Root) Otto. Gary attended Redwood Falls schools graduating in 1957. He attended Gustavus Adolphus College and graduated from the University of Minnesota in 1961. Gary worked as an Actuary for IDS Life, American Family in Georgia and ITT Life, Minnesota. He retired in 1994. Gary also served in the US Marines Air Reserves in the late 1960s.\n\nGary moved to Alexandria, in the late 90s, to take care of his parents during their last years and moved back to Plymouth, MN in 2017.\n\nGary enjoyed sporting events and was a long time Viking and Gopher season ticket holder. He loved attending his nieces and nephews events, whether it be a concert, field event, graduations, weddings, family reunions, birthdays, or boat rides at the lake. Gary loved his family deeply and always sent cards for birthdays and Christmas. Gary never met a stranger.\n\nGary passed away on August 30, 2022. Gary leaves behind four brothers; Richard (Judy) of North Richland Hills, Texas; David (Beverly) of Bloomington, Mn; Jon (Debra) of Euless, Texas and Charles of Atwater, MN. He also leaves 11 nieces and nephews and 21 grand nieces and nephews.\n\nA Celebration of Life will be held at 11 a.m. on Friday, June 2, 2023 at the Nelson-Hillestad Funeral Home; followed by the burial of his ashes at the Redwood Falls Cemetery. We will return to Nelson-Hillestad Funeral Home for a light lunch.\n\nIn LovingMemory"
