        "text": "Otto H. Jacobi III, 75, passed away on August 3, 2019 in his home in Troutville, surrounded by beloved family and friends. His passing marked the end of an 18-month battle with acute myeloid leukemia (AML).\n\nHe was born on November 17, 1943 in Flushing, N.Y., the eldest of three children to the late Athena Maidanos Jacobi and Otto H. Jacobi Jr.; he spent most of his formative years living in Ronkonkoma and then Medford, N.Y. During much of his early to mid-adult life he lived in Coram, N.Y., and would later move to Troutville, when he was semi-retired.\n\nOver his lifespan, he was a veteran in the U.S. Navy, a U.S. patent holder, and had a successful career as a leader and project engineer at Brookhaven National Laboratory for over 40 years. He was well accomplished and well-liked by all who knew him, whether as a member of the St. Mark’s Episcopal Church, where he was an usher; a member of the local gun club, where he was a gun collector, and an active member of the local car club. He was passionate about many things and had an amazing gift of knowledge that he shared with those around him. Even in his retirement, he could not simply sit idle; he built his dream garage with the help of some friends and accomplished his dream of building his hot rod, a ’33 Ford, which he toured with his close friends.\n\nIn addition to his parents, Otto was preceded in death by his daughter, Lisa Jacobi. He is survived by his wife of 11 years, Lorraine M. Santulli Jacobi, whom he cherished since meeting 15 years ago; his children, Donna Jacobi, Lora Jacobi, and Travis Jacobi; step-father to Anne Cullen and husband Jamie Unruh, and Vincent Cullen and his fiancée Amy Walence; adored grandfather to Briana Jacobi, Drew Sebastino, and Cullen Unruh; and dearly loved brother of Roger Jacobi and Athena Jacobi.\n\nCommittal service with full military honors provided by the US Navy honor guard will be 11 a.m. Friday, August 9 at Southwest Virginia Veterans Cemetery, 5550 Bagging Plant Road, Dublin, Virginia with the Rev. Fr. Willis Logan officiating. The family will receive friends for a Celebration of Otto’s life immediately following at Ballast Point, 555 International Parkway, Daleville."
