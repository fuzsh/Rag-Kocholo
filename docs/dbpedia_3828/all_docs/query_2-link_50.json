        "text": "Locally Owned & Operated\n\nWhat does 'Locally Owned & Operated' mean to you? Or ‘Family Owned’ for that matter? There are many funeral homes in our surrounding area that are owned by a parent company located in a neighboring state. While this parent company is owned by a family, they have no local ties to our communities and do not live in Wisconsin. The name on the sign is not their name. It is the name of a former funeral home owner that gained the communities trust with years of loyalty to the community they lived in. Possibly, they may still own a small percentage (1%) of the funeral home. This is so the funeral home can still state that it is ‘Family or Locally’ owned even though they may no longer work at the funeral home.\n\nThis is not the case with Schmidt & Schulta Funeral Home. We are truly ‘Locally Owned and Operated’. The current owners, David 'Benji' & Jennifer Schmidt own 100% of Schmidt & Schulta Funeral Home. Benji is the third generation owner in the Schmidt Family. You will see Benji and Jennifer, as well as their daughters, Cora & Katelyn, assisting families. While we do not have any Schulta’s working at our facilities at this time, we pay honor to Michael Schulta who played a major role in the creation of Schmidt & Schulta Funeral Home.\n\nOur family owned business has a vested interest in serving the community where we live, shop and work. We believe in neighbors serving neighbors.\n\nSchmidt & Schulta Funeral Home has been serving families in Wittenberg, Birnamwood, Bevent, Bowler, Aniwa, Hatley, Mattoon, Tigerton, Galloway, Elderon, Eland, Ringle and surrounding areas in Langlade, Marathon, Portage and Shawano Counties for over 45 years.\n\nWhen you have experienced the loss of a loved one, let us guide you through the process of creating a meaningful healing ceremony that will honor a unique life. At Schmidt & Schulta Funeral Home, we are committed to spending time with our families and providing each family we serve with the highest quality care and service.\n\nAt Schmidt & Schulta Funeral Home, we understand what it means to live in a small community and the friendships that go with that.\n\nNeighbors helping neighbors. That is what life is all about."
