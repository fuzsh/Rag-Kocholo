Do not place it in direct sunlight. This object could function as a loupe in direct sunlight and cause burning marks or even fire.\n\nResearch. That's what Renee Mennen and Stefanie van Keijsteren – the design duo at Studio RENS – do best. Whether it concerns colour, material or technique, their designs are not thought up in advance but develop as they go along.\n\nThe two of them met at the art academy of Breda, where they both graduated as spatial designers and then immediately started their own studio.r. First they were product designers,, but nowadays they’re more of a design research agency. Through trial and error – both for commissioned work as well as for themselves – they come up with the most innovative designs.\n\nIn all of his designs, Thomas Eurlings' starting point is the material and its accompanying characteristics. This originates from his textile design background. Now, he and his team design complete interiors, as well as furniture and jewelry. Do the Fading Mirror for ENO studio and the Gradient Wallpaper for NLXL ring a bell? Yep, they both come from this creative studio. “Considerate and balanced” is how he describes his own work. Balance between decoration and functionality, graphic and organic, minimalistic and extravagant: but never obtrusive and always approachable.\n\nStarted on the catwalk, Antoine Peters expressions developed in the most broad sense of it’s meaning. His work is a mix of fashion, art and architecture, resulting in a world where product-design, textile-design, print-design, and art installations go hand in hand. Museums, newspapers, books, people, music, optimism: Antoine gets his inspiration from everywhere and nowhere. Except from the internet, which, according to him, is influenced by filters and algorithms and well, the real originality is within yourself, right?\n\nAfter graduating from IED Istituto Europeo di Design (Milan), Simone Bonanni worked in Amsterdam, where he got familiar with the Dutch culture and way of working. After he moved back to Milan, he decided to merge the best of both Dutch and Italian design into his own design studio Simone Bonanni Studio (SBS). Something that is very important to Simone, is the feeling that his designs evoke. He considers them as “activators of emotions”. And that's working out just fine. It is not without reason that he works with international brands such as Alessi, Moooi, MDF Italia, FIAM, Falper, Mingardo and FEST.\n\nFlorian Kallus and Sebastian Schneider are the German brains behind design studio Kaschkasch, currently busy conquering the world with its modern chic furniture, lighting design and art direction.\n\nSmart modern living, that’s what Kaschkasch is all about. And that translates into products that are both beautiful and logical, both simple and poetic. Products that’ll blend great with your interior (any interior for that matter) and will most definitely make you happy – wanna bet?\n\nThis Italian lady was already tipped as an upcoming talent in 2018 by the renowned architect and designer Andrea Branzi. Federica's style is characterized by minimalist, modern lines. She moved to Amsterdam especially for that; to learn the intricacies and emerging trends of nordic design. She now runs her own design studio in Milan where she designs and works as a trend forecaster as well. She draws inspiration from all that is close to her heart: from food to Eastern philosophy.\n\nThis award-winning German designer is widely known for his high-quality designs. He designed furniture, lamps and home décor for brands like &Tradition, Gubi, Linteloo, Moroso and Thonet. To Sebastian, people are a huge inspiration - especially the way we change ourselves and our behaviours all the time. The way society is continuously developing makes Sebastian curious and challenges him as a designer.\n\nThis talented German designer likes to extract ideas from experiments. While experimenting with materials, constructions or shape-proportions ideas pop up in her head. Surprisingly ideas, that provoke a kind of happiness.\n\nMeike loves to test different proportions, combinations and details until the raw idea comes to life.\n\nAs a teenager, Belgium based designer Sylvain Willenz wanted to become a cartoonist. When he, later on, discovered design, Sylvain realised that he could implement that clear comic line style into his designs. Combined with his wish to design elegant products, this results in subtle designs with a graphic, playful touch.\n\nHer collection, her methods, her appearance. It's hard to NOT fall in love with Amsterdam textile designer Mae Engelgeer. Her first collection for FEST - no coincidence - was called Crush. Mae is always looking for the perfect combination of four elements: shapes, technique, colours and materials. Different styles intrigue her. Color ánd black and white. She loves contradiction – she makes it clash, up until it works well aesthetically.\n\nGerman designer Martin Hirth is remarkably young for the timelessness of his designs. Rationality and basic forms meet flair - according to Martin, that might be the best way to describe his style. This warm-hearted designer is fascinated by pragmatism and quality. His goal is to create designs that are as sustainable and elegant as can be.\n\nThis Berlin-based design studio was founded by Silvia and Antonia Terhedebrügge - two sisters who are playful and yet distinct designers. You could compare their way of thinking with playing ping pong. One of them comes up with an idea, and the other gives something back. And this goes on and on. The result is graphically clear. Two-dimensional layers form a three-dimensional object.\n\nDon’t be fooled by Joren Naerebout’s seemingly modest work. His minimalistic designs hide an admirable amount of research. Which results in elegant, timeless objects that carry the ability to merge with your interior like no other, thanks to its thought-out lines and material and the clever play of light and shadow. Naerebout enjoys drawing from the Dutch modern-vintage period, a period characterized by its Calvinism. The products of Atelier Naerebout therefore never dominate a room but operate sophisticated and quietly in the background. Its beauty is rather expressed by the use of material, a well-chosen color and how the light plays with a simple line or surface. If you invest in a Naerebout, you invest in a functional and relevant product for life.\n\nDutch design studio Ontwerpduo is based on the collaboration and chemistry between Tineke Beunders and Nathan Wierink. Tineke likes to imagine things just a little bit differently while ignoring any practical or technical restrictions. Often her ideas seem impossible – until Nathan becomes involved. Thanks to his technical skills, Tineke’s ideas turn out to be feasible after all.\n\nNature, and especially the principles and processes that are found in nature are David Derksen’s main sources of inspiration. This results in a strong focus on materials, how they behave and how they can be constructed. According to David Derksen, creating objects is like playing with the forces of nature on scale. In his designs he tries to express the beauty of the material and the way it is produced.\n\nDutch designer Gijs Papavoine gained worldwide fame at traditional furniture brands, like Montis. For FEST, he designed modular sofa Kate. He works with simple basic shapes, combined with elegant lines. Graphic forms meet seating comfort. The modular design of Kate makes it possible to create your own sofa that fits your lifestyle. Gijs' signature is not just the model, you will find it in the smallest detail and the structure of the design.\n\nThis Australian design duo breaks design rules, one step at a time. Kate and Joel are fascinated by everyday life. They investigate the daily use of shapes, materials and colours and search for new and different ways. By doing so, they push boundaries of what is considered to be common and break design rules. Truly Truly invites you to look at design differently.\n\nThe studio of Amsterdam based artist Tessa de Rijk is somewhat similar to a laboratory. Here, the artist experiments with different techniques, materials and tools - like special paintbrushes, developed by Tessa herself. Inspired by nature as well as everyday city life, Tessa's art is made to become part of any home interior where it can play with light and shadows.\n\nMeet Yonoh. An award-winning design studio, based in Valencia, the next world design capital in 2022. Yonoh is run by designers Clara del Portillo and Alex Selma, who met each other 16 years ago and ever since do what they love to do most: product design.\n\nIf we say timeless design, you say Daphna Laurens. This design studio was founded in 2008 by Daphna Isaacs Burggraaf and Laurens Manders. After they graduated from the Design Academy in Eindhoven, they started their career as a designer duo. From furniture to home décor, this studio does not shy away from any challenge, especially when it comes to sustainability. And that's where FEST and Daphna Laurens meet: the combined interest in creating less temporary interiors.\n\nThe playful and minimalistic designs of Amsterdam design studio De Intuïtiefabriek (“The Intuitive Factory”) find their way internationally. Their work is both intuitive as technical - almost scientific.\n\nMaterials and techniques form the basis, while on the other hand, their gut feeling plays a central role in the design process. The moment when intuition and technique come together – that’s when everything falls into place."
