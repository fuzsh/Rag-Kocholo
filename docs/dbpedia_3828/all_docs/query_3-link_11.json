        "text": "Career\n\nHe is noted for many theorems including: Hölder\"s inequality, the Jordan–Hölder theorem, the theorem stating that every linearly ordered group that satisfies an Archimedean property is isomorphic to a subgroup of the additive group of real numbers, the classification of simple groups of order up to 200, the anomalous outer automorphisms of the symmetric group S6 and Hölder\"s theorem which implies that the Gamma function satisfies no algebraic differential equation. Another idea related to his name is the Hölder condition (or Hölder continuity) which is used in many areas of analysis, including the theories of partial differential equations and function spaces. In 1877, he entered the University of Berlin and took his doctorate from the University of Tübingen in 1882.\n\nThe title of his doctoral thesis was \"Beiträge zur Potentialtheorie\" (\"Contributions to potential theory\").\n\nHe worked at the University of Leipzig from 1899 until his retirement."
