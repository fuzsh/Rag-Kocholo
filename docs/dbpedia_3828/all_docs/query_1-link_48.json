        "text": "Gary moved to Alexandria, in the late 90s, to take care of his parents during their last years and moved back to Plymouth, MN in 2017.\n\nGary enjoyed sporting events and was a long time Viking and Gopher season ticket holder. He loved attending his nieces and nephews events, whether it be a concert, field event, graduations, weddings, family reunions, birthdays, or boat rides at the lake. Gary loved his family deeply and always sent cards for birthdays and Christmas. Gary never met a stranger.\n\nGary leaves behind four brothers; Richard (Judy) of North Richland Hills, Texas; David (Beverly) of Bloomington, Mn; Jon (Debra) of Euless, Texas and Charles of Atwater, MN. He also leaves 11 nieces and nephews and 21 grand nieces and nephews.\n\nA Celebration of Life will be held at 11 a.m. on Friday, June 2, 2023 at the Nelson-Hillestad Funeral Home; followed by the burial of his ashes at the Redwood Falls Cemetery. We will return to Nelson-Hillestad Funeral Home for a light lunch.\n\nIn Loving Memory."
