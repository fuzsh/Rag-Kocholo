        "text": "As we conceive it today, legal pluralism is a complex concept. As Tamar Herzog explains in her essay in this volume, scholars in a number of different fields use legal pluralism to approach a variety of issues.Footnote 1 The scope of this paper is limited: I want to show that the historiographic description of medieval law suggested by nineteenth-century German scholarship contributed substantially to the creation of the category of legal pluralism, as opposed to the absolute supremacy of state-made law. This was the focus of German legal historical scholarship in the late nineteenth century, represented by the towering figure of Otto von Gierke. Gierke's image of a pluralist German Middle Ages profoundly influenced legal scholarship in Europe, even affecting the Italian scholar Santi Romano, whose book on the “legal order” has been considered a milestone in the construction of pluralist legal theories.\n\nGierke was a conservative, right-wing socialist. Romano became a counselor of the fascist Italian government in 1925, and in 1928 entered the Italian Fascist party. It may be surprising, then, that Gierke and Romano's model of a pluralist legal order also drove the innovative historical interpretation of medieval law proposed by the staunch antifascist Francesco Calasso. He drew inspiration from Romano to suggest a new, fascinating image of a pluralist medieval law, while freeing himself from the nationalist and corporativist ideas of Gierke and Romano. These three authors continue to influence legal theory and historiography to this day. This paper aims to show how the study of medieval law influenced the emergence of a pluralist view of law, how this view shifted from legal historiography to legal theory, and how it returned to legal history.Footnote 2"
