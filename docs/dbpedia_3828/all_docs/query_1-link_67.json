        "text": "BiographyThe following biography is from \"REMEMBRANCE - Auckland Grammar School Great War Roll of Honour\"\n\nby Andrew Connolly and Peter Stanes.\n\nLANCE CORPORAL NORMAN CHARLES OTTO, 1908\n\n1st Battalion, Wellington Infantry Regiment, 10/3048\n\nDied 25th September, 1916\n\nNorman Charles Otto was born on 7th June 1894 in Tararu, Thames. He was a son of Charles Otto and Jessie Marie Welham.\n\nIn an obituary for Norman in the New Zealand Herald of 23rd October 1916, it was suggested that:\n\n“His great-grandfather went through the Peninsular campaign and fought at Waterloo. After Waterloo he came out with Governor Phillip to Sydney, and later to Auckland with Governor Hobson, where the family settled.”\n\nHis great-grandfather, George Otto, may well have served in the British army, culminating in the Battle of Waterloo, but, travelling to Sydney with Governor Arthur Phillip would have been difficult, considering that the Governor arrived in Sydney in January 1788 and died in 1814, the year before the Battle of Waterloo. George Otto was German and born about 1784, probably in Hesse Cassel. It is thought that he may have emigrated to England before the start of the Napoleonic Wars in 1803, and that, during the Wars, he was attached to the British Commissariat of the Allied Armies under General, then Field Marshall, Wellesley (later the 1st Duke of Wellington). About 1810, he married Elizabeth Nicolle, who was baptised at the Church of St. Saviour in Jersey, Channel Islands, in May 1789. Elizabeth then travelled with him around Europe during the war, their first three children being born in France, Spain and Belgium, respectively. After Waterloo, they settled in London, where George worked as a baker. Some eighteen years later, George and Elizabeth, together with their four surviving daughters and one surviving son, out of a total of eleven children, joined the first free settlers to New South Wales, arriving at Port Jackson from London in August 1833, on board the sailing ship Bussorah Merchant. They had one further child in Sydney, a son named Andrew Otto, born in November 1834. George died in July 1836 in the west of Sydney, near Parramatta, and Elizabeth, still with two young children to support, quickly married James Rampling in November of that year, also in Sydney. James had come to New South Wales as a criminal, having been sentenced to deportation from London in April 1814 for “uttering divers forged notes”, arriving in Sydney in April 1815. Lance Corporal Norman Charles Otto. Unfortunately, he continued to have trouble with the authorities for some time after he arrived in Australia. It is thought that Elizabeth came to New Zealand in 1838, on board the sailing ship Diana, arriving at Kororareka in the Bay of Islands, but later settling in Auckland. She brought with her a table quilt and glass cruets from Napoleon’s last meal before being sent to Elba. They still exist, the quilt being held by the Auckland War Memorial Museum. Elizabeth died in Union Street, Auckland, in February 1877.\n\nAndrew Otto set up in Queen Street, Auckland, as a grocer, marrying Mary Ann Isabel Clark in September 1859. Mary Clark was born in Bermondsey, London, and baptised at the nearby St. Mary’s Church in Rotherhithe. They were to have two daughters and six sons, Charles Otto being the fourth son and sixth child. By 1863, they were living in Wyndham Street, where they had a combined shop and house. About 1870, after owning 4 acres of land in Remuera, the family moved to Thames, where they lived for many years in Owen Street, and, by 1890, in Brown Street. Towards the end of his life, Andrew moved to Auckland and was staying at the Wellesley Street West home of his daughter Emma, who had married Edward Henry Allen in 1889, and this is where he died in September 1896. After Andrew’s death, Mary moved to live with another of their sons, Albert Otto, who was a farmer at Cabbage Bay, now known as Colville, at the north of the Coromandel Peninsular, where she died in June 1906.\n\nCharles Otto married Jessie Marie Welham at All Saints’ Church in Ponsonby in December 1891, and they settled in Tararu, Thames, where Charles worked as a battery hand at one of the many mines’ ore crushing plants.\n\nJessie Welham was born about 1869 in Newland, Gloucestershire, in England, to Richard Welham, a labourer and son of William and Mary Welham, and Elizabeth Nugent, a daughter of James Nugent and Mary Johns. Richard Welham was born in Suffolk and baptised at St. Mary’s Church in Newmarket in June 1829. In early 1850, he married Elizabeth Nugent in Merthyr Tydfil, Glamorganshire, in Wales, the marriage having been registered there in the second quarter of that year. Elizabeth was born about 1833 in Morriston in Glamorganshire, about 6 kms north of Swansea. In 1851, they were living with Elizabeth’s parents in Penydarren, Merthyr Tydfil, but, by 1859, they had moved to Newland in Gloucestershire, and were living in White Cliffs. Ten years on, and now with a family of three sons and three daughters, Jessie Welham being the youngest child, they remained living in White Cliffs, and where William was working as a sugar boiler. With their prospects poor, they sought a change and decided to emigrate to New Zealand. In December 1877, they arrived at New Plymouth from London, on board the sailing ship Hurunui (91 days). Between 1871 and 1877, Richard and Elizabeth had had another son and daughter, and it was with these children, together with four older children, two sons and two daughters, that they arrived in New Plymouth. Three older daughters married and remained in England, although at least one came to New Zealand later. The fate of a fourth older daughter is unknown. The family settled in New Plymouth, where Richard worked as a labourer, before becoming a confectioner by 1887, when they were living in Devon Street. Elizabeth died in New Plymouth in August 1899, and Richard died in March 1902 at “Wilton Cottage”, Nelson Street, Auckland, the home of his daughter, Lucy, who had married Arthur Lewis in 1896.\n\nCharles and Jessie Otto lived at Tararu until about 1904, when they moved to Ongarue, about 20kms north of Taumarunui. There, Charles began working as a surfaceman or platelayer, maintaining the railway tracks, but, by 1911, they were running a boarding house called “Seddon House”, and they appear to have remained there until Jessie’s death in October 1947. After her death, Charles retired to live at Waharoa in the Waikato, and, about 1955, may have moved to live at 11 Iwi Street, Onslow, in Wellington. He died in January 1959. Charles and Jessie had four daughters and two sons, Norman Charles Otto being the older son and the second child.\n\nNorman Otto was educated at the Tararu School, Thames, at the Newton West and Newton East public schools in Auckland, and then, the Ongarue school, north of Taumarunui, from where he won a free place at the Auckland Grammar School. On leaving Grammar, he returned to Ongarue, and took up dairy farming where he excelled at the genetic aspects of breeding for an improved herd. Otto served in the Territorials with the Taranaki Rifles. He attested for service on 15th May 1915 and sailed from New Zealand on 8th October 1915, arriving at Suez on 18th November 1915. He sailed to France with the Division on 6th April 1916. Once in France, on 10th July 1916, he was promoted to Lance Corporal and served at both Armentieres and on the Somme. On 25th September, the 1st Wellington Battalion was part of a full Brigade assault on the Germans at the Factory Corner north east of the village of Flers, and around the Flers Support trenches. Otto was killed in this action. He was 22 years old. Following an enquiry as to how Otto had died, his father, Charles Otto, received a cable from the officer commanding the 1st Wellington Battalion on the Somme front that Otto had been killed instantly by a shell and was buried in Goose Alley Trench, Flers. After the war, his remains could not be identified and Norman Otto’s life is commemorated on the Caterpillar Valley (New Zealand) Memorial.\n\nLance-Corp. Norman Charles Otto, reported killed in action in the Battle of the Somme, was the son of Mr. and Mrs. Charles Otto, of Seddon House, Ongarue, King Country. He entered the School in 1908. After leaving school he entered upon a farming career and settled at Ongarue with his parents. He was much devoted to the hobby of rearing an improved strain of dairying cattle, and had a very fine herd of Holsteins and Jerseys. In 1914 he was one of the prize winners in the Calf Rearing Competition conducted by the A. and P. Food Company, Limited, of Wellington.\n\nCHRONICLE 1916, V.4, N.2 P19\n\nDate of birth7-6-1894Date of death25-9-1916Year of entry1908CollectionsWW1 Roll of HonourPeople CollectionsPeopleCategoryPeople | Students | OtherRemembrance | WW1People | Old Boys | Armed Forces"
