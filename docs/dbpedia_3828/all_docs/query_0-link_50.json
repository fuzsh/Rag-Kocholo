        "text": "Arp, Merl (9-3-1931 to 3-23-2016)\n\nMerl was born in Iowa, son of Elmer and Nora Arp. He attended a one room school house with his sister. He graduated high school, worked and in the early 50s joined the U.S. Air Force. While in the Air Force and stationed in Germany, he discovered a love of languages and culture. After his discharge, he attended the University of Iowa and received both undergraduate and graduate degrees. Though studying and working part time, he found time to meet and marry his wife Jean (Williams) in 1957. He entered the foreign service of the State Department and served for 28 years. He served in embassies and consulates in Canada, Kenya, Nigeria, Sweden, the Philippines and Germany. It wasn’t unusual to find Merl and Jean working in Northern Germany working and researching their German genealogy. His time in the foreign service, he experienced many historical milestones. He lived in Kenya during the tenure of Kenya’s first president, Jomo Kenyatta. In Nigeria, the family experienced the coup and subsequent bombings during the Biafran war. He served in Sweden during the Vietnam war and was given the task of working with US military deserters, attempting to assist them while in crisis. During this same period, Merl was part of a team that was responsible for flying into Vietnam, picking up civilian POWs, interviewing and escorting them home. The family resided in the Philippines both before and after martial law was declared by then president Marcos. Anyone who has seen the movie with Tom Hanks, ‘The Bridge’ will recall the prisoner exchanges. While in Germany, Merl was involved with a spy exchange on the Glienicke Bridge. The family also enjoyed a trip to the East of Germany to visit Checkpoint Charlie and tour East Berlin.\n\nAfter retirement, Merl became active with the German American cultural organizations. He coordinated ‘Exchange Tours’ with friends in Iowa and friends in Schleswig-Holstein. He was a member of the German Society of Maryland, becoming a lifetime director in 2011. He was the society’s representative to DANK (Deutsch-Amerikanischer National Kongress), serving as their national 2nd vice president. He was the editor for the American Schleswig-Holstein Heritage Society, where he contributed thoughtful and well researched articles. Other memberships included the Baltimore Kickers, the Society for the History of Germans in Maryland, the Mid-Atlantic Germanic Society and the Edelweiss Club.\n\nThroughout the years, his wife and partner, Jean and their five daughters supported Merl in his various adventures from visiting cemeteries, dancing at the festivals and their many travels. Together during retirement they traveled to South Africa, Syria, Egypt, Russia, Canada, Montenegro, Croatia, Ireland and of course Germany.\n\nAumann, R. Karl 5-17-1960\n\nGovernor Ehrlich (see profile) appointed R. Karl Aumann to be Secretary of State of Marylandon January 15, 2003.

Mr. Aumann graduated from Loyola College in Maryland with a B.A. in political science in 1982. He received his J.D. in 1985 from the University of Baltimore School of Law and was admitted to the Maryland Bar in 1986.\n\nAs an attorney, he was an associate with the Towson firm of Power & Mosner (now Bodie, Nagle, Dolina, Smith & Hobbs) and later with the Baltimore office of Miles & Stockbridge.

He was educated in the public schools of the City, but at an early age began earning his own livelihood. He took every opportunity to study and finally entered, as a student, the University of Maryland Law School, graduating from, that institution in 1897, and began the practice of law. A Republican, he took an active interest in politics, and the same year of his graduation was elected a member of the City Council, 1897-99, serving as chairman of several important committees. He was elected on a platform in which it was stated that if elected he would advocate placing wires underground in conduits. There was much opposition on the ground that no such franchise should be given to private corporate interests. Mr. Broening took the position that it was a municipal function, and therefore the conduits should be built by the municipality, and that they should be owned and maintained by the City because only in that way could competition among ether persons who wanted to use them be secured. It was a hard-fought battle. Both branches were Republican at that time.\n\nHe had a nickname, ‘Billy the Mixer’ because he loved talking and joining. He was member of many clubs and could spend hours talking to the people.\n\nMr. Broening was secretary of the late Frank C. Wachter during the latter’s eight years, 1899-1907, in Congress. He, in fact, was Mr. Wachter’s close personal friend and advisor as well as secretary, and he later occupied a similar position with Congressman John Kronmiller, of Baltimore, 1909-11.\n\nMr. Broening served in the House of Delegates for the session of 1902-04.

He was elected States Attorney of Baltimore November 2, 1911, and was re-elected to that office in November, 1915. As States Attorney he introduced in connection with the work of that office the Big Brother Movement, through which means he sought the help of many people in the community in saving and reclaiming many who had yielded to temptation. He entered the Mayoralty contest in 1919 as the unanimous choice of his party, and on May 6th was elected Mayor, defeating George Weems Williams, Democrat.\n\nHe retired from public life after serving in many positions, the last being the city tax collector. There is a street named after him, Broening Highway.

All five of his brothers were in the business with him.\n\nJacob was instrumental in helping Solomon Etting win for the Jews, the right to hold office in Maryland.

He also served as a member of the Baltimore City Commissioners of Finance.\n\nHe lived on North Charles Street in 1820 and was one of the first private homes in Baltimore to be lit with gas lights.

As Chairman of the Judiciary and Chairman of the Committee on the Constitution, Mr. Schley was an integral part of the discussions. He prepared and reported the draft of the Constitution of 1836. This discussion and the unpopular report led to the ‘duel’ between Mr. Schley and Mr. William Cost Johnson. It is reported that Mr. Schley sent a peremptory challenge, which was accepted and on February 13, 1837 in Alexandria, Virginia, the duel was carried out. There was one single exchange of shots and both men were wounded, Mr. Johnson more severely than Mr. Schley.
