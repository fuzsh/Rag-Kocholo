        "text": "Johannes (Jo) Kleiman was born on 17 August 1896 as the son of Cornelis Kleiman and Emmetje Vink. He was the third of four children. He had two brothers, Cornelis (Cor) and Willem Jacobus (Willy), and a sister, Agatha, who died young.\n\nIn 1896, the Kleiman family lived at Domineespad, now called Zuiderkerkstraat, in Koog aan de Zaan. A few months after the birth of Johannes, the family moved to Nijmegen. Kleiman married Johanna Catharina Reuman in July 1923. Their daughter Johanna was born in 1928. During the hiding period he and his family lived at 12 II Wielingenstraat in Amsterdam.\n\nThe first contacts with Otto Frank date back to 1923, when Kleiman became proxy holder at the Amsterdam branch of the family bank. Around the same time he became managing director of the Centrale Maatschappij voor Handel en Industrie, in which some of Otto's relatives and acquaintances had an interest. Otto himself was a supervisory director from December 1933. From the mid 1930s, Kleiman was also a commissioner at the Paauwe clock factory, and together with brother Willy he had a pest control company called Cimex."
