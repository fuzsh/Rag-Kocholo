Borrowing concepts from Darwin’s theory of evolution, Loos proposed that ‘the evolution of culture is synonymous with the removal of ornament from objects of daily use’. Arguing that ornament applied to useful objects inevitably goes out of fashion, rendering the object itself obsolete he condemned the waste of both object and the time invested in its making as immoral. Loos further likened surface decoration to tattoos on a tribesman or criminal, which he denounced as uncivilised and unevolved because of its origin in a primal erotic impulse. Declaring, however, that ‘all art is erotic’, he advocated instead the controlled sublimation of the erotic impulse into the production of utilitarian objects of extreme economy but made from the best materials and exquisitely finished.\n\nÖsterreichischer Künstlerbund (Austrian Artists’ Association) – Group led by Gustav Klimt that formed after the 1905 split from the Secession, which included Josef Hoffmann, Otto Wagner, Alfred Roller and Carl Moll.

Based on the principle of freedom from physical restraint, the fashion rejected corsetry or constricting shapes in favour of loose, flowing forms.

Semper’s Ringstrasse projects exemplify his historicist use of Renaissance and classical styles, later unpopular among modernist designers.

The vertical canvases dedicated to the themes of Philosophy, Medicine and Jurisprudence appeared at the Secession in 1900, 1901 and 1903 respectively, where they provoked outraged among critics and Faculty members for their perceived obscenity. Klimt returned his fees to the university and the pictures were acquired by his supporters. Stored in Schloss Immendorf during World War II, they were destroyed in 1945 when the castle was burned down by retreating German forces.\n\nVereinigung bildender Künstler Österreichs(Association of Austria’s Fine and Graphic Artists) – see Secession\n\nVer Sacrum (Sacred Spring) –short-lived but outstanding journal of the Viennese Jugendstil movement, produced by Secession members from 1898 to 1903.

Pioneered by Rudolf Eitelberger, professor of Art History at the University of Vienna, and Director of the Museum of Art and Industry, where he insisted on object-based teaching, Eitelberger’s influential followers included Franz Wickhoff and Alois Riegl, who also combined academic careers with object-based curatorial work.\n\nWärndorfer, Fritz (1868–1939) – Son of a wealthy Jewish textile manufacturer and enthusiast for modern English and Scottish design, Wärndorfer was an early patron of Secessionist artists and co-founder and financial backer of the Wiener Werkstätte.
