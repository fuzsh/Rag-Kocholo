At that time, the major problems which became the focus of twentieth-century finite group theory were distilled. New techniques and systematic methods were introduced as attempts were made to solve these problems. The abstraction of group theory which had taken place during the 1870s and 1880s resulted in deeper insights into Galois' theory of equations.\n\nExpand abstract"
