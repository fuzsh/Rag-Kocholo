Chapel attendance was at that time required at Mercer University. The binder contains a transcript of the sermon and related correspondence and news clippings. The collection also contain Newton Chapel worship services bulletins and worship prompters, primarily from 1989-90.\n\nTo quote in print, or otherwise reproduce in whole or in part in any publication, including on the World Wide Web, any material from this collection, the researcher must obtain permission from (1) the owner of the physical property and (2) the holder of the copyright.
