Otto Hölder German mathematician (1859–1937) best known for Hölder’s inequality and the Jordan-Hölder theorem (http://planetmath.org/JordanHolderDecompositionTheorem). Hölder also made many essential first steps in the then emerging study of groups. Some of his results include a complete classification of the groups of order (http://planetmath.org/OrderGroup) p2,p3,p4, p⁢q and p2⁢q (p and q different primes) and are an early example of the power of the Sylow theorems for finite group theory.

He studied at the University of Berlin, got his doctorate from the University of Tübingen, and taught at the University of Leipzig.
