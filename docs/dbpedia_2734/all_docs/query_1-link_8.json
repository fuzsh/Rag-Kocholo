        "text": "Educating Rita\n\nThis extract is very near to the beginning of the play Educating Rita by Willy Russell . Rita is an Open University student who is meeting Frank, her English tutor, for the first time. The conversation takes place in Frank’s office. Rita has knocked and Frank has said ‘Come in’, but Rita has had some difficulty in getting the door to open. Irritated, she now stands by Frank’s desk.\n\nRead the extract below two or three times, until you feel you are reasonably familiar with it. As you do so, remember the schematic assumptions we explored on the previous pager about tutors, mature students and how you would expect them to interact in a first tutorial. Jot down how you think these characters, and this interaction, compare with what you would normally expect.\n\nThere are no ‘answers’ on this page for you to compare your views with. Instead, when you have finished your work on this page, go the next one, where we will analyse the extract more carefully. You can then see in detail whether your reactions are justified by an analysis of the text."
