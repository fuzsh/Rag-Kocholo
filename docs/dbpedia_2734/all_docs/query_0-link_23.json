        "text": "(born 1947). British dramatist and songwriter Willy Russell wrote for the stage, film, and television. His musicals, comedies, and dramas won both critical and popular acclaim.\n\nWilliam Martin Russell was born on August 23, 1947, in Whiston, Lancashire, England. He left school as a teenager and worked various jobs, including hairdresser and songwriter. After a few years Russell returned to school, and he eventually became a teacher. During this time he developed an interest in writing plays.\n\nRussell’s first play was Keep Your Eyes Down, which was produced in 1971. Russell earned his first breakout success with the musical John, Paul, George, Ringo…and Bert. Produced in 1974, it explored the rise and fall of the Beatles. It won the Evening Standard and the London Theatre Critic Awards for best musical that year. His comedic play Educating Rita first appeared onstage in 1980. It centers on a working-class woman who takes a class in order to better her life. It was made into a film in 1983. For that, Russell was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Adapted Screenplay.\n\nRussell’s play Blood Brothers was first staged by a small touring company in 1981. However, Russell lengthened it and revised it into a full-length musical, which was staged in 1983 and again from 1987. Russell not only wrote the story and lyrics but also composed the music. The story follows twin brothers who are raised by different families. Blood Brothers won a Laurence Olivier Award for Best New Musical in 1983. It played in London for more than 20 years and on Broadway for two. Another hit, Shirley Valentine, appeared in 1986. The play explores the mind of a middle-aged housewife who wants more in her life. Russell adapted the play into a film of the same name, which appeared in 1989.\n\nSome of Russell’s works also appeared on television, including Dancin’ Thru the Dark (1990) and Our Day Out (2017). His first novel, The Wrong Boy, was published in 2000. Russell released an album of his songs, Hoovering the Moon, in 2003."
