        "text": "‘The walls are lined with books and on one wall hangs a good print of a religious scene.’\n\nThe books show he is interested in a variety of subjects and that he is an educated man. The artwork of the religious scene suggests an appreciation of higher forms of culture. We may get the idea of a successful man because of his working environment, his office. This is conveyed as a prestigious occupation because his office is part of a traditional ‘Red brick’ University, however this information is inferred and is not yet enough to prove he was successful.\n\nFrank holds his own opinions about university and the Open University course and from this, we the audience begin to understand how Frank really feels; this reveals more about Frank’s lifestyle as the play develops.\n\n‘I shall need to wash away the same silly women’s attempt to get into the mind of Henry James or whoever it is we’re supposed to study on this course.’\n\nThis shows/reveals Frank’s snobbish side and he will use his views as an excuse to go to the pub. This also suggests Frank may be an alcoholic.\n\nAs the play progresses, Russell gradually changes our perception by revealing flaws and weaknesses in Frank’s character. There are three or four main weaknesses in Frank’s character and Russell presents these later in the play to show the difference between our first impression of Frank and what he is really like.\n\n‘Because darling, I like my lamb done to the point of abuse, and even I know that ratatouitte cannot be burned.’\n\nFrank is explaining to his partner, Julia, that he will be late home but he fails to tell her the real reason why. This shows his inability to maintain a relationship, we already know Frank is divorced and from this phone call home, the audience is beginning to notice a difference in character.\n\n‘Pours himself a large slug into the mug in his hand’\n\nAnother weakness in his character is his addiction to alcohol, we already have knowledge that Frank would prefer to be out at the pub instead of being at work or with Julia, but he furthers his addiction by drinking at work. Our initial impression of a confident, successful man has now changed into an alcoholic. It also shows Franks attitude towards his job and he is very disrespectful. Russell has presented this by telling us where he hides his alcohol, in the bookcase, and his attitude towards it.\n\nFrom our first impression, Frank is very different to how he is now portrayed. Russell has shown this by presenting a more negative perspective than has previously been shown. As weaknesses in Frank’s character are gradually revealed, Rita’s character is shown as being more positive- she is anxious to ‘better’ herself.\n\nOur first impression of Rita is very different to the one of Frank, she is shown as ignorant and informal, she was the ‘typical early school leaver’ not interested in school or exams. But she came to realise that she didn’t want to be like the ‘lower class’ people in her area, she wanted to do something, she wanted to change.\n\nAs the play progressed, we learn more about Rita, we begin to see her as a more positive person.\n\nWhen we first meet Rita, our information is limited because she was never introduced in the same way Frank was. She was different to Frank in many ways, as I have written above.\n\n‘Dumping her bag’\n\nFrom this, we learn that at that moment in time, Rita was disrespectful and ignorant.\n\n‘It’s that stupid bleedin handle on the door’\n\nRita use of language also shows disrespect and from these two lines, the audience will understand how Rita will act in this scene. From these actions, we know that Rita is very different to Frank. A point which Russell was trying to show, to help show the differences between social class and the ‘lower class.’\n\nRita first scans the room and notices the art print of the religious scene, her first impression of the print is,\n\n‘Look at those tits’\n\nHer use of language is very informal but once she looks/studies the print/painting more carefully, she turns to Frank and says,\n\n‘This was the pornography of its day wasn’t it? Its sort of men only, isn’t it? But in those days, they had to pretend it was erotic, so they made it religious, didn’t they? Don’t you think it’s erotic?’\n\nThis shows that Rita is more educated than she first appeared, but although she is confident, she asks many questions to reassure herself that she is right, because it is more likely that she was nervous, although she did not show it much.\n\nFrank and Rita have very different views/about the Open University, Rita found it as an opportunity to get somewhere in life, whereas Frank has no respect for it and believes it to be a waste of time.\n\nIt is through the course, the two different characters meet. And as the play progresses, each character develops and changes through the other characters’ guidance.\n\nAs we approach the end of the play, Russell turns the play around, making Rita the stronger character. Rita becomes more independent and Frank feels as though he is losing control of her because she no longer needs him, as she already states.\n\n‘I’m educated, I’ve got what you have an ‘y’ don’t like it because you’d rather see me as a the peasant I once was; you’re like the rest of them- you like to keep your natives thick, because that way they still look charming and delightful, I don’t need you.’\n\nRussell eventually gets his point across, by proving the audience’s first impression of Rita wrong and shows that anybody can get a decent education if they have the determination, and that there is more to life than the boundaries of social/educated middle class and ‘lower class.’\n\nRussell uses Rita as a reflection of his own personal struggle; as a working class man aspiring to be educated and respected as a social equal. Therefore Frank represents the power of education and obstacles posed by a traditional class system. It is throughout the play, Russell presents differences in the two characters to help us, the audience understand the process of change- a less advantaged upbringing does not mean that life’s choices should be limited."
