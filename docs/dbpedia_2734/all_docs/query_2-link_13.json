        "text": "Childhood Play, Strong Women and Working-class Values\n\nWilly Russell's plays tend to revolve around a number of issues which it would be easy to trace back to influences in his childhood life.\n\nAll the four famous plays revolve around women, whom Russell portrays sensitively and with compassion. Russell himself remembers growing up in a house where the men went out to work, and where his childhood life was, therefore, dominated by his mother and aunts. He was also a ladies' hairdresser for six years.\n\nAnother recurrent theme from Willy Russell's childhood is the idea of violent play. Guns crop up in Blood Brothers again and again - for example when the children are playing - but most of the time \"it really doesn't matter the whole thing's just a game\". The different occasions are during Sammy's bungled robbery, and at the twins' death, which leave Mrs Johnstone singing: 'Say it's just a story ... that we can turn over and start again'. Russell draws the contrast between the consequences of toy guns and real guns.\n\nMany of Willy Russell's plays are also to do with class. Russell believed that the class you belong to determines - to a large extent - your chances in life. In Blood Brothers, these differences are extreme, and Russell describes them very dramatically. In the play, class is an active and destructive force, infiltrating and perverting at least Mickey's life, and eventually destroying both brothers. Russell does not deals crassly with even this great force in his characters' lives; there is insight and true-life complexity in his treatment of the issues, and both brothers long for aspects of the other's life - 'I wish that I could be like my friend'. But the class divide wins out in the end and destroys them both.\n\nMargaret Thatcher - the unnamed character\n\nMargaret Thatcher does not appear in the play, but you could suggest that she is the most important character in it!\n\nMargaret Thatcher became Britain's first woman Prime Minister in 1979. But if some people hoped that 'a woman's touch' would lead to more caring policies, they were very much mistaken.\n\nThatcher's basic premise was that working Britain had got lazy. British industry, she said, needed to face the chill wind of foreign competition. She confronted the Trade Unions and reduced their power - notably during the Miners' Strike of 1984-5. Meanwhile, to combat inflation, she raised interest rates and reduced government spending. The result was a severe economic depression. Manufacturing output fell by a fifth, and unemployment rose to over 3 million. At the same time, however, people dependent on the Welfare State (especially single mothers) were stereotyped as scroungers and spongers. One Tory minister told them to 'get on their bike' and go and find a job. For the poor, therefore, the 1980s were a time of great hardship.\n\nWilly Russell's plays were not the only outcry of the 1980s against Thatcherism - one famous TV series - Boys from the Black Stuff - told of the desperate attempts of Liverpool tarmac layers to survive the depression, and was famous for the character Yosser Hughes and his catchphrase: 'Gissa job'. But it is possible to see Blood Brothers as an attack on Thatcherism, particularly in the cruelty of how the secretary 'Mrs Jones' loses her job (she is forced to type the letter to herself announcing her own redundancy), and in the destructive effects of unemployment on Mickey's life. It is unemployment which reduces him to despair, throws him into the bungled robbery, and then keeps him on the pills. These effects were all too common in the 1980s, when Russell was writing his play. Mickey's depression is arguably a metaphor for the state of Britain in the 1980s.\n\nSo, in a very real sense, it was not Mrs Johnstone, the curse of the separated twins or even 'class' which killed Edward and Mickey - it was Mrs Thatcher.\n\nContrastingly, while the poor struggled in Thatcherite Britain, there was plenty of money sloshing around for the rich 'yuppies' who were exemplified in Harry Enfield's comedy persona 'LOADSA' money!' Thatcher sold off the nationalised industries to private shareholders, reduced income tax and Council tax, and sold Council houses to their owners. During her time as Prime Minister, the gap between rich and poor widened significantly, and it is tempting to see the gap between Edward and Mickey in Willy Russell's play as reflecting this difference in British society.\n\n(As an aside, many historians now see the 1980s as the time when 'class distinctions' in Britain died. Margaret Thatcher herself declared that there was no such thing as society, only individuals, and Tory individualism seeped into the way British people did things and took hold. Certainly the great institutions of working-class collectivism - the Trade Unions - suffered. Nowadays, pollsters do not even ask people their income, never mind what 'class' they come from - a 'working class' Daily Express reader is more likely to be like a rich Daily Express reader than a 'working class' Daily Mirror reader. So it is possible that Willy Russell got it wrong when he portrayed class as so vitally influential in the boys' lives. Nevertheless, you have to realise that Willy Russell was writing in the 1980s, not the 2000s, and that his play reflects what people saw happening at the time.)\n\nThe Intention\n\nHaving said all this, and while it is undeniable that there is a didactic (teaching us something) element in Blood Brothers, I think it is also arguably true that this was not Willy Russell's main intention. Blood Brothers seems primarily to be a play which is designed simply to ENTERTAIN audiences.\n\nRussell himself says that the play started with the idea of the curse of the separated twins - it was a story that 'sent shivers up my spine'. He talks about how his main aim in writing the play was in making the story 'work' convincingly. And - on the stage - the play hurtles along keeping the audience entranced, now with a burst of humour, next with terrible pathos - and through it all, a sense of impending, deterministic doom.\n\nIt is worth thinking through the different scenes, and thinking about what EFFECT Willy Russell was trying to have on the audience there.\n\nWhat effect, do you think, was Willy Russell going for in the last scene of all?"
