        "text": "Educating Rita by Willy Russell\n\n\"Educating Rita\", is a two-handed play which only has two characters\n\nand one set. \"Educating Rita\" was written in 1985 by Willy Russell, it\n\nlooks at how the relationship between two people, Rita and Frank,\n\ndevelops as the play goes on. \"Educating Rita\" is the story of Rita, a\n\nhairdresser who decides to go to University in order to discover who\n\nshe really is. When she arrives at University she meets Frank, a lazy\n\nalcoholic who doesn't really care about being a University lecturer.\n\nAt first, Frank refuses to teach Rita but he soon finds he has a soft\n\nspot for Rita and decides to teach her everything he knows about\n\nEnglish Literature. I will be analysing the advantages and\n\ndisadvantages of \"Educating Rita\" being two-handed play. I will be\n\nreferring to the play version and also to the film version of\n\n\"Educating Rita\" to analyse the different gains and losses of the\n\ntwo-handed play.\n\nFirst of all, I will be looking at the many advantages of \"Educating\n\nRita\" being a two-handed play. There are many benefits of having only\n\ntwo characters and only one setting in a play, for example a close\n\nrelationship develops between the two main characters, as the depth\n\nand intensity of the relationship is much more highlighted than it\n\nwould be if there were more than two characters in the play. This\n\nshows the importance of the two characters. For example, in Act One,\n\nscene five when Frank says \"We really should talk about you and Denny,\n\nmy dear\", this shows Frank and Rita's relationship takes a bigger step\n\nbecause they both discuss each other's personal problems, for the\n\nfirst time Frank isn't just Rita's teacher but ...\n\n... middle of paper ...\n\n... problems and to an extent Frank and Julia's personal problems. The\n\nfilm also had the scene of Frank delivering a lecture whilst drunk,\n\nwhich I think the play didn't really exploit and wasn't actually funny\n\nwhen it was told in the play. Also, seeing Rita and Frank outside the\n\nuniversity with their personal lives wasn't really developed in the\n\nplay, for example when Rita was going to have dinner with Frank and\n\nJulia, in the play it didn't really explain in detail why Rita didn't\n\nwant to go in and have dinner, but in the film it was easily\n\nunderstandable why Rita didn't want to go in. So, in conclusion I\n\nfound the film version of \"Educating Rita\" much more effective than\n\nthe play version because the film was much easier to understand than\n\nthe play because I was very confused of what actually was happening in\n\nthe play."
