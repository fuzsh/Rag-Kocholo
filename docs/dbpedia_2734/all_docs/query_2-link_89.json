        "text": "The Women in Willy Russell's Plays\n\nI have studied three of Willy Russell's plays these are Blood\n\nBrothers, Educating Rita and Shirley Valentine. The women in Willy\n\nRussell's plays are strong characters and they all know what they want\n\nin life. In the three plays I will be comparing and contrasting Mrs\n\nLyons and Mrs Johnston from blood brothers, Rita from Educating Rita\n\nand Shirley from Shirley Valentine. The three plays are set in\n\nLiverpool this could be because Willy Russell is from Liverpool.\n\nThe characters have high hopes and ambitions and want to achieve\n\nsomething in life. Mrs Lyons main ambition is to have a child of her\n\nown but unluckily, she and her husband are unable to have children.\n\nThis leads her to become more and desperate to have a child. So when\n\nMrs Johnston finds out that she is expecting twins she can't afford to\n\nlook after two more children. Mrs Lyons persuades her to give one of\n\nthe children to her. Eventually, when Mrs Lyons actually gets the\n\nchild she becomes paranoid and overprotective because she is afraid\n\nthat Eddie will find out that he is not her child. Or Mrs Johnston\n\nwill tell Eddie that he is her child and belongs to her. Mrs Lyons\n\nbecomes obsessed with the situation and moves away from Mrs Johnston.\n\nUnfortunately, for Mrs Lyons, Mrs Johnston wants a fresh start and is\n\nre-housed to the same place.\n\nMrs Johnston's ambition is to provide for her children and to have a\n\nlife without debt. However hard Mrs Johnston tries to provide a good\n\nlife for her children she is stopped by numerous bills and her\n\nchildren getting into trouble with the police for example, Sam goes\n\ndown for robbing. So, when Mrs Lyons gives Mrs Johnston a chance to\n\nsupply a good life for one of the twins she takes it. One of the\n\nagreements is that Mrs Johnston can see the child whenever she pleases\n\nbut when she is sacked, she realizes it is an idealistic promise. Mrs\n\nJohnston is unable to do anything about the circumstances."
