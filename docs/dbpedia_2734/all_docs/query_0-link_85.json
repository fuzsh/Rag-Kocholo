        "text": "It was only a fortnight ago that Willy Russell’s beloved musical Blood Brothers played to packed houses at The Lowry.\n\nIf you were one of those people moved by the show’s winning blend of social satire, deeply-felt emotion and nostalgic Liverpudlian setting, then prepare for a further dose - as another Willy Russell classic, his 1980 play Educating Rita, arrives at the same Salford venue next week.\n\nInspired by Russell’s own educational experiences and aspirations, Educating Rita follows the intellectual journey of working class Rita, whose passion for English literature brings her into the life of Frank, a middle-aged professor with a drink problem.\n\nDespite initial misgivings, Frank eventually guides Rita through the world of literature. However, when Rita begins to rely less on her mentor, their relationship starts to fracture.\n\nClearly much has changed since the play was first performed in 1980, and also since the much-loved film adaptation (starring Julie Walters and Michael Caine) was released three years later.\n\nYet the play’s central themes - the limitations of social class, the shortcomings of institutional education - are still hugely relevant almost four decades on.\n\nThis acclaimed new touring revival starring Stephen Tompkinson and Jessica Johnson in those famous roles is making its way to Salford Quays next week.\n\nAnd it all came about after a serendipitous meeting between the two leads when both were performing at Live Theatre in Newcastle.\n\nJessica said: \"We crossed paths and got chatting, and I just said to Stephen I thought he would make an amazing Frank.\n\n\"I had just done a short run of Educating Rita in Durham at the Gala Theatre, and was telling Stephen how I'd love to get a longer run at this incredible role.\n\nStephen, 53, adds: \"It transpired it's a play we've both loved for many, many years. So I went away and re-read the play, which I had been reading since I was 15. In fact a school friend and I used to rehearse it in my dad’s garage together, but of course I was way too young for the role back then.\n\n“But re-reading the play I realised I’m now the right age to play Frank which was a little bit scary to begin with!”\n\nStephen, who is known for his time in long-running TV dramas including Ballykissangel, Wild At Heart and DCI Banks, is excited to get inside the head of Frank.\n\nStephen said: “Frank is terribly disappointed in life, he’s not been a great success at being a poet, he’s disappointed in the way the curriculum dictates how he teaches. There’s nothing of him in there, there’s no passion. So to meet this woman with so much passion, he almost wants to run away. She offers him a little bit of a lifeline, and he’s doing the same for her. There is definitely an attraction for him.\n\n“It’s a brilliantly-written play, and a universal story of two lost souls, mismatched people in terms of character and background who meet at the right time to help each other in life.”\n\nJessica said: “It’s definitely a love story, they definitely care for each other, she loves him for giving her the opportunities.”\n\nStephen also believes audiences are in for a treat with the casting of Jessica as Rita - just as they were when Julie Walters made her movie debut in Educating Rita in 1983.\n\nStephen said: “Julie Walters wasn’t known to the majority of the audience then, and it was that surprise value that made it work, and I think Jess does that as well. As soon as I saw Jess on stage I knew there was a uniqueness she had, and I think it will be a beautiful surprise for the audience when Rita breezes into everybody’s life.”\n\nEducating Rita is on at The Lowry from Tuesday, April 30 to Saturday, May 4."
