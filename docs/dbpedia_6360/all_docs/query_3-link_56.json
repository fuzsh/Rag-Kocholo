        "text": "James Bond Movies In Order: How To Watch All 27 007 Movies\n\nDr. No celebrates its 60th anniversary!\n\nIf you’re looking to watch all the James Bond movies in order, you’ll hit the good stuff right away: All the Sean Connery movies in his first run are classics of the franchise. Before hitting Connery’s departure from the 007 role in 1971’s Diamonds Are Forever, you’ll encounter George Lazenby’s solo entry (1969’s On Her Majesty’s Secret Service) and 1967’s comedy spoof Casino Royale, which was made outside of Eon Productions, the company founded to steer Bond from the book to the big screen.\n\nRoger Moore took on the mantle from 1973’s Live and Let Die to 1985’s A View to a Kill, with Connery returning one last time in the non-Eon Never Say Never Again in 1983.\n\nTimothy Dalton appeared twice as Bond to close out the ’80s with The Living Daylights and License to Kill.\n\nAfter six years, the longest period between switching lead actors, Pierce Brosnan debuted with 1995’s GoldenEye, and exited with 2002’s Die Another Day.\n\n2006 saw the introduction of Daniel Craig as the latest Bond in town with Casino Royale, and he will be retiring with the long-delayed No Time to Die. With its 2021 release, Craig will hold the record for longest continuous actor to represent Bond.\n\nContinue on to see the full list on how to watch all the James Bond movies in order! —Alex Vo\n\n#27\n\nDr. No (1962) 95%\n\n#27\n\nAdjusted Score: 102343%\n\nCritics Consensus: Featuring plenty of the humor, action, and escapist thrills the series would become known for, Dr. No kicks off the Bond franchise in style.\n\nSynopsis: In the film that launched the James Bond saga, Agent 007 (Sean Connery) battles mysterious Dr. No, a scientific genius...

[More]\n\nDirected By: Guy Hamilton\n\n#17\n\n#17\n\nAdjusted Score: 88327%\n\nCritics Consensus: Though it hints at the absurdity to come in later installments, The Spy Who Loved Me's sleek style, menacing villains, and sly wit make it the best of the Roger Moore era.\n\nSynopsis: In a globe-trotting assignment that has him skiing off the edges of cliffs and driving a car deep underwater, British...
