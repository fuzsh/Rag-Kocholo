        "text": "For me the Connery/Moore films are the Bond films. These films, although based on the Flemming books, set a style for the Bond films.; the films themselves have created there own version of Bond. Yes there's the comic factor, but that's what the Bond films were. The lead role changes and films that follow these are not in the same style at all and although they are considered as Bond film \"cannon\" they are not for me. You only have to look at the Lazenby film to see a difference. This time it'sin the shooting and editing; the Lazenby film has a lot of very fast cuts and extrememly close up shots in the action sequences (with a lot of these having been cut together from very different takes with obvious positional difference between actors and props etc.).\n\nDon't get me wrong I like the Craig films (not so stuck on Dalton and absolutely hated Brosnan), but I don't see the Bond character as the same person as in the earlier films at all; it's a completely different person to me.\n\n0\n\nLicence to Kill was just after the Doe Hard Market in my opinion.\n\nExactly this. Cubby Broccoli wanted to cash in on the gritty crime thrillers of the late 80s, just like the Bond series did with Moonraker and the sci-fi craze of the late 70s.\n\nI have never bought the argument that Licence to Kill was an attempt to push Bond in a new direction that the audience simply wasn't ready for. I actually think LTK is a decent revenge flick that is completely let down by the \"made for TV\" production values.\n\n0\n\nI thought that firstly Bernard Lee (M) appeared to be very ill and not at his best in the film. Did he get written out of Octopussy rather late for health reasons? In that film Bond is briefed by the Deputy Head, who explains that M is at a meeting with the Prime Minister. In the driving stunts, I thought Remy Julien can drive around all day at 45 degrees, it still will not improve the film.\n\nI noticed in the credits, rather than saying James Bond will return in the name of the next film. It just said James Bond will return.\n\n0\n\nLicence to Kill was just after the Doe Hard Market in my opinion.\n\nExactly this.

I actually think LTK is a decent revenge flick that is completely let down by the \"made for TV\" production values.\n\nDalton was overtly trying to push it in a darker direction than previous Bonds had and take more inspiration from Bond as he was in the books so the idea that Craig had issued in an unprecedented darkness isn't true. Having finally got the rights to film Casino Royale, you'd expect the adaptation to be relatively close and you wouldn't be able to do that without Bond being a darker character, so it's not a new element that Craig had introduced.\n\nAlthough as always it's a reflection of whatever the trends were at the time, arguably it is a different direction in the sense they were willing to push it into a different certification so that at least in the UK, only 15 year olds and above could see it. You expect consistency from a franchise so it introduces a new concept that a Bond film didn't have to be cartoony (yes, there's cartoony parts but the driving force of his best friend's wife being murdered, with implied rape, and his best friend being maimed is a human drama rather than a pure fantasy one).\n\n1\n\nI was underwhelmed by 'The Living Daylights' when I first saw it. Now it’s one of my favourite Bond films and Timothy Dalton is the last Bond that I like in the role.\n\nI’m a big fan of 'License to Kill' as it’s also the last Bond film that I enjoyed. It reminded me a little of 'Dr No'. Very colourful and exotic. It also has my favourite Bond girl of all time. It’s a shame that it was deemed controversial and that we didn’t get to see a third outing for Dalton as in general, I really like him.\n\n1"
