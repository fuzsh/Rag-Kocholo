        "text": "“Everything for a man on holiday. Explosive alarm clock – guaranteed never to wake up anyone who uses it. Dentonite toothpaste – to be used sparingly, the latest in plastic explosive”.\n\nEight movies, four bonds and too many hours to contemplate into the James Bond series, and I really had no expectations for License to Kill. Not because it has a bad reputation, not because I’ve hated the series so far. Just because the series has been so underwhelming so far. Sure, there’s some change in tone and feel as the years pass and the different actors put their spins on the character, but I can’t say that I’ve been surprised a single time yet in this endeavor.\n\nBond (Timothy Dalton) is on the way to the wedding of his old CIA, or FBI, or whatever the shit American mate, Felix. Heading to the Miami wedding in a limo, they’re pulled over by a chopper and called in for a quick mission to stop a drug runner from leaving American air space. They win, they parachute into Felix’s wedding, the trademark gun barrel POV shot appears and we’re into Licence to Kill. It was at this stage, that I thought I might have finally found the James Bond movie that would make me like James Bond movies.\n\nRobert Davi as Sanchez, the drug runner from the opening scene, soon escapes. On their honeymoon, Felix is attacked by a shark and badly beaten, while his wife is raped and murdered. But since women are pretty disposable in this series, the beating of Felix seems to be the main motivator when Bond decides to seek revenge. Soon, he’s suspended by MI6 and off the grid, going undercover with Sanchez’ crew, including a disconcertingly young Benicio Del Toro. Also along the way, he meets the dark and exotic Lupe (Talisa Soto), and the white bread, girl next door Pam (Carey Lowell).\n\nIt’s this combo of dolly birds that made me notice a pattern in Bond movies. I think every single one I’ve watched so far has followed the same basic sequence of events in regards to the women in Bond’s life. In the first act, he’ll meet someone dark and exotic, generally European or South American. They usually work for Bond’s enemy. After she and Bond bone down, two things happen. Either her boss realises she’s been working with Bond, at which point he kills her. Or, Bond discovers he’s been double crossed, that she’s been loyal to her boss along. At which point, the boss kills her to make some sort of point.\n\nSomewhere along the line, 007 will also meet a white bread, girl next door. Usually American or English, they are just as hot as the exotic girl, but never as mysterious. This is the girl who gets to ride off into the sunset with Bond at the end. Where Licence to Kill mixes things up though, is that both are good guys, both live to see the end credits, and Bond is still have a red hot crack at both. And we, the audience, are still supposed to think he’s the awesome good guy, even as he eye fucks them both in front of each other at a party to celebrate his big victory over Sanchez. If it’s not too late, spoiler alter, James Bond wins, the bad guy loses.\n\nThis far into the series, Timothy Dalton is still by far the most interesting James Bond. It could be his acting, it could be the (slightly) more realistic stories being told and action being depicted, but I still find him more believable than his predecessors. So technically, I think I’ve enjoyed his entries into the James Bond series more than Connery, Lazenby and Moore, but still not enough to be sold on the character or the series."
