        "text": "Now that I’ve finished looking at all the films in the first 50 years of James Bond’s cinematic history, I think it’s time I shared with you my top 7 films. No, this isn’t a list of what I would call the “best” films by as objective a standard as possible (which is pretty close to impossible, anyway). This is as subjective a list as there is. It’s based on things like my favorite sidearm, my favorite Scotch, how old I was when I saw a particular movie for the first time, etc. Film pacing, acting, plot, screenplay. . . none of those things will play as big a role in deciding my favorites; though they’ll play a small role, they won’t be the deciding factor.\n\nSo, without further ado, here’s my top 7 James Bond films.\n\n7. The World Is Not Enough (1999).\n\nThe World Is Not Enough makes this list because it has all of the elements of a classic Bond movie. Sweeping camera shots of beautiful, exotic locales. Lots of action. A decent amount of gadgets. Several jokes sprinkled throughout. It’s basically the Goldfinger of the modern Bond films. While not breaking any James Bond movie rules, The World Is Not Enough touches on some unusual topics for a Bond film, not the least of which being Stockholm Syndrome. I enjoyed this movie because it features Pierce Brosnan as Bond, who happens to be my personal favorite Bond actor.\n\nAlso, I had a pretty big crush on Denise Richards when I was in high school, despite how bad an actress she was. But really, what 15-year-old boy didn’t back then?\n\n6. On Her Majesty’s Secret Service (1969).\n\nOn Her Majesty’s Secret Service, in my opinion, is one of the most underrated of the Bond films. It has some of the most convincing action of that era of filmmaking, it has one of the best love stories of the Bond series (and features one of the only two times in the series that Bond falls in love), and it has one of the most—if not the most—heart wrenching scenes in the whole Bond franchise to date. M’s departure in Skyfall doesn’t even come close.\n\nDo your best to watch this Bond movie, even if you watch no other Bond movie from that era.\n\n5. Goldfinger (1964).\n\nGoldfinger is the first quintessentially “Bond-like” Bond film. It’s the first true action movie of the series (the first two were spy movies that contained action; this one placed action front-and-center). It introduces a number of the elements that would become staples of the Bond series for the next 38 years (many of which wouldn’t be removed until 2006, only to be reinstated in 2012). It gave the series that fast pace it desperately needed. And it gave us more iconic Bond moments than any movie before and any movie for a long time after.\n\nIf you’re looking for the movie that truly started it all, look no further than Goldfinger.\n\n4. For Your Eyes Only (1981).\n\nFor Your Eyes Only is that film that represents everything that I love about James Bond. It’s witty, but not kitschy. It’s dark, but not brooding. And it features the actor I associate most with classic Bond. Roger Moore was the second actor I saw portray the character, and I still remember going to the library in the summers as a kid and, after picking up my summer reading material, getting to choose a James Bond VHS to watch later that night when my dad would get home from work. It was always a Roger Moore Bond movie. The only two Bonds that existed in my mind were Pierce Brosnan and Roger Moore, and at the time Brosnan only had one movie, so Roger Moore it was.\n\nCinematically speaking, For Your Eyes Only is Moore’s finest outing as Bond. It’s a must-see from that era of Bond films.\n\n3. Licence to Kill (1989).\n\nLicence to Kill got maligned when it first came out, but I think that’s because it was way ahead of its time. To this day it’s one of my favorites because it presents a story that tosses the character into some pretty dark territory and goes where I wish Die Another Day had gone: into the messed-up mind of a rogue agent out for revenge.\n\nThat, and Q gets to go on assignment with Bond!\n\n2. Casino Royale (2006).\n\nCasino Royale is probably the best Bond film to date. It just works on so many levels. I included it because I was so worried that this movie wouldn’t work, and I was so frustrated that Pierce Brosnan was replaced that I became one of the movie’s detractors. During my senior year of college, the Internet started to gain a lot of traction as a pop culture news source, and between then (which was the year Die Another Day came out) and the release of the movie I began reading all the Bond-related websites I could, and everywhere I looked there was talk of Brosnan finally doing Casino Royale. Then the news dropped that Brosnan was getting replaced. My expectations for the movie fell through the floor and down into the basement. Imagine my surprise when the movie turned out to be what it was.\n\nIf you’ve never seen a Bond movie, and you have no desire to bother with 23 movies, at least see this one. This is the Bond movie that sets the new Bond movie standard.\n\n1. GoldenEye (1995).\n\nGoldenEye was the first Bond movie I ever saw. I was just 11 years old when it came out, so it was the perfect time for me to experience my first James Bond adventure. I’ll never forget the rush of adrenaline I felt as I watched Bond drive a motorcycle off a cliff to catch a diving plane. Or the way I laughed hysterically when Bond’s countryside race with Xenia Onatopp knocked over a group of cyclists along the side of the road. Or the shock that ran through me when I discovered who Janus really was (I was 11; there was no such thing as “predictable” at that age).\n\nEven now, GoldenEye holds up rather well. It’s not a timeless movie by any stretch of the imagination, but it’s still an enjoyable movie to watch by today’s standards.\n\nClick here to go back to the James Bond Retrospective index.\n\nImmediately following the release of The Living Daylights, EON Productions began development on the next feature. The plan was to continue in the vein of Timothy Dalton’s first film, exploring Bond’s darker side. The original title for the film was Licence Revoked, but due to some confusion among some American test audiences, the title was changed at the last minute to Licence to Kill.\n\nAs a result of this change, the marketing campaign had to be altered significantly to accommodate the new title. The original marketing campaign reflected the darker tone of the film and was an evolution from previous James Bond marketing. The new marketing ended up more “traditional Bond” than the initial campaign, causing some audiences to feel bothered by the darker tone of the movie as they had seen a lighter tone in the advertising.\n\nThe film opened at the Odeon Leicester Square in London on June 13, 1989. The film did not do well in the box office; some cite the last-minute marketing change, while others cite the heavily saturated summer of movies. Batman, Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade, Lethal Weapon 2, Ghostbusters II, and Honey, I Shrunk the Kids all came out that summer.\n\nThe film opens with Bond and DEA agent friend, Felix Leiter (played once again by David Hedison), on their way to Leiter’s wedding. They’re interrupted when a group of DEA agents inform Leiter that a drug lord he has been hunting down named Sanchez had just been spotted nearby. He and Bond immediately take off and make the arrest. After they complete the mission, they make it just in time for the ceremony.\n\nA $2 million bribe convinces the arresting agent to spring Sanchez free. Sanchez goes after Leiter, kills his wife and feeds Leiter to sharks. Leiter survives, but he loses his arm and his leg to the sharks. Because of his closeness to Leiter and his wife, Bond goes on a personal vendetta, hunting Sanchez and attempting to bring down his operation.\n\nBond’s actions anger M, who attempts to pull him in. Bond refuses and resigns his commission as 007, going rogue and attempting to accomplish the mission without MI6 support.\n\nLicence to Kill is the darkest and most violent Bond film to date, with a deceptively simple plot and a well executed screenplay. Unfortunately, audiences weren’t prepared for such a dark movie at the time, and the film suffered at the box office. Critics remarked the the film was too dark, and much of the charm that they were used to (likely from the Roger Moore films) had vanished, replaced by an angrier, deadlier sentiment.\n\nDalton appears more comfortable this time around. The film is built around his darker sensibility and works well for him. I was on the edge of my seat for practically the entire movie. The gritty action, smart dialogue, harsh characters, and simultaneously simple and complex plot all give this film an edge that is much needed in the franchise.\n\nThe primary Bond girl, Pam Bouvier (played by Carey Lowell), is a tough woman who gives 007 a run for his money. She’s an edgy, gritty character who has an intoxicating elegance about her that is tantalizing and frightening at the same time. She’s easily one of my favorite Bond girls, but she’s incomparable to any Bond girl who came before her.\n\nFranz Sanchez, played by Robert Davi, is a vile character. He’s a well portrayed villain, deviant, powerful, and maniacal. The last time I was this awed by a Bond villain was Blofeld from On Her Majesty’s Secret Service.\n\nEvery character was well written, but not every character was well portrayed. The secondary Bond girl, for example, was not a good performance. She was stiff and didn’t have a good grasp of her character. It was clear she was doing little more than reciting her lines.\n\nDesmond Llewelyn plays Q yet again, but this time he gets far more opportunities to shine than he ever has. His appearances give much needed comedy relief to an otherwise gloomy film. Despite this, he is able to show off a more sensitive side to his character, a welcome exploration of a mainstay of the franchise.\n\nLicence to Kill is a great film. It was way ahead of its time; the film was about as dark and violent as a mid- to late-2000s film. It’s unfortunate that Bond fans in the 80s weren’t ready for the stark change in the franchise.\n\nThis would be the last Bond film anyone would see for a long time. Due to legal difficulties, the film franchise would be held up for several years. Fortunately for us, the next Bond film is just a Blu-Ray disc away.\n\nNext up, GoldenEye.\n\n(Click to go back to the list.)"
