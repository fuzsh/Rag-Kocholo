In my \"Bondathon\" I watched OHMSS and LTK virtually back-to-back and couldn't help but feel a little disappointed by the latter so soon after watching the former. Where OHMSS felt imaginative, glossy and very English (a.l.a. Fleming), Kill had a very \"hard\" quality to it. The tone of the film is basically \"Bond's mad and he's going to get even\" and the setting of the Florida Keys, the cigar chomping FBI agents and the out-of-place dialogue (\"I don't like it, you can finger me\") don't strike me as appearing in a Fleming book.\n\nHere is an interesting review I found of Kill which isn't so much critical of Dalton as the producers and writing:\n\nhttp://n007.thegoldeneye.com/ltk-review.html"
