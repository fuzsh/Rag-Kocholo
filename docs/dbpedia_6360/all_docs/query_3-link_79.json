        "text": "A good portion of Licence to Kill's story feels like it should have existed during Daniel Craig's current reign as James Bond. Timothy Dalton's last outing as 007 features the spy going renegade (a popular detour for the character), sharks turning CIA contacts into amputees and widows, very gritty, very grounded action set pieces and a greedy, murdering drug kingpin as a villain. Already it sounds like a vehicle worthy of Craig's take. Sadly, we get Dalton's too-serious Bond taking point on what should have been a better-appreciated entry into the franchise.\n\nWhile Kill's PG-13 sensibilities were met with indifference by 1989's audience, feeding on more summer blockbuster fare like Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade and Lethal Weapon 2, the movie holds up surprisingly well, sharing many tonal attributes with the current state of Bond films. If you can get past Wayne Newton's role and a title song best left for listeners of radio programs called \"The Quiet Storm,\" Licence to Kill serves as solid training wheels for Bond's current's exploits.\n\nFollowing the murder of Felix Leiter's new wife, and the escape of drug czar Sanchez (an effective Robert Davi), Bond goes off the grid and on Sanchez's trail for – what else? – revenge. Bond goes undercover to investigate a front company Sanchez uses to smuggle dope underwater, and in doing so finds allies in both Carey Lowell's ex-CIA agent and in Sanchez's lady, Lupe, played by the still-hot Talisa Soto. MI6 and the CIA wage a mostly off-screen search to bring Bond in or put him down, while Bond infiltrates Sanchez's organization and preys on Sanchez's insecurities and double dealings, exposing the weakest links in his organization and saving the killing stroke for an awesome, CG-free tanker truck chase that ranks with one of the best set pieces the Bond series has ever produced.\n\nJohn Glen, a frequent Bond director, treats Bond as more of a blunt instrument than quipping super spy. For the most part, this take is effective, as a more Roger Moore-esque vision would have seemed out of place in the story's Cold War-minded world. Yet we don't have much fun watching this Bond get the job done, like we do with Craig's super spy, even in heavy, game-changing fare like Casino Royale. The movie takes itself too seriously for most of its brisk running time, unable to find a balance between the Bonds that came before and the Bond we have now. Even Connery's more serious fare had moments where the films reminded themselves that their lead character is a guy who bedded a girl named Pussy Galore. As a big fan of the current iteration of the franchise, I appreciate what Licence to Kill tried to do and what it intermittingly comes close to achieving, but ultimately the movie doesn't want to be escapist fare and so certain scenes aimed at summer movies seem at odds with that goal.\n\nAs villains go, Davi's simmering and often times likeable Sanchez earns the title of most underrated Bond villain, and sleazy henchman Benicio Del Toro raises the tension in every scene. Soto's wounded femme fatale makes for more than just eye candy. Dalton's brooding, scowling Bond is both the film's strongest and weakest link. We buy him in the thick of the action, in the middle of going against any and all rules and regulations, but we don't exactly like the character. Rather, we identify with the legacy Dalton occupies and rely on our appreciation of the icon to keep us interested. The man can act, better than most that have fired the Walther PPK, but he never seems to find the balance that would work so well for Craig.\n\nIf Licence to Kill added more than just scenes with Q to lighten the load, if it provided a love interest as compelling as Vesper and more engaging than Lowell's whiny Pam Bouvier, this Bond could have been one of the instant greats, instead of one that is better appreciated with age. The movie is not perfect, but a lot of what works now in the series got its start in Dalton's last mission as James Bond.\n\nScore: 7 out of 10\n\nVideo and Presentation\n\nThe only thing separating this Blu-ray from the SD set is brighter, more vivid sound. The image has not been treated with the same care as previous Bond efforts on BD, with inconsistent black levels and noise during indoor scenes being the biggest blemishes the transfer sports. Color levels are top notch but film grain is noticeable, especially during the opening title sequence and Bond's trip to Sanchez's casino. Make the upgrade only if you are the ultimate Bond fan.\n\nScore: 6 out of 10\n\nLanguages and Audio\n\nA 5.1 DTS track boasts Lossless Audio with much success. During the teaser action sequence, stray gunshots ricochet across the satellite speakers and Michael Kamen's understated score is more effective given the mix's dynamic range. Dialogue is front and center, and crystal clear – what more can you ask for? This mix is a marked improvement over previous versions of Licence to Kill on home video, providing a solid sonic presentation with only a few moments where the bass overpowers the soundtrack.\n\nScore: 8 out of 10\n\nExtras and Packaging\n\nThe majority of the special features are carried over from the standard-def release, and look it when put under BD's unforgiving scrutiny. Content-wise, however, the extras deliver as complete a behind-the-scenes look at the making of film as one could ask for.\n\nHere's what you get:\n\nDECLASSIFIED: MI6 VAULT Deleted Scenes With Director John Glen Introductions\n\nAudio Commentary featuring director John Glen and cast members\n\nCommentary featuring producer Michael W. Wilson and crew members\n\nOn the Set with John Glen Featurette\n\nOn Location with Peter Lamont\n\nGround Check with Corky Fornoff Featurette\n\nBond '89\n\n007 MISSION CONTROL Interactive Guide Into the World of Licence to Kill\n\nInside Licence to Kill\n\nProduction Featurette \"Behind the Scenes\"\n\nKenworth Trucks Featurette\n\nGladys Knight \"Licence to Kill\" Music Video\n\nPatti LaBelle \"If You Asked Me To\" Music Video\n\nOriginal Trailers & Photo Gallery\n\nImage Database\n\nSelf-explanatory best describes most of the featurettes on this disc, with the standouts including the \"Inside Licence to Kill\" making-of doc and a look at Lamont's seamless production design. Glen's commentary is the same as it was on the movie's first outing on DVD, and it offers a moderated/edited discussion concerning many facets of production logistics, with rare lapses into play-by-play commentary of what's happening on screen. Glen is a droll speaker, but very candid. He offers the majority of production tidbits, elevating this commentary as one of the set's better efforts. Wilson's track hits some of the same beats as Glen's, from a production side of things, but it does provide insight into the genesis of the opening title scene and how Leiter's almost-fatal shark attack was inspired by the novel Live and Let Die.\n\nOne can do without the music videos, trust me. And the trailers provide a time capsule of sorts as to how people could actually believe movies should be marketed in such ways. Overall, die-hard Bond fans and special feature junkies rejoice … if you can get over the fact that this double dip is without new extras in HD.\n\nScore: 8 out of 10\n\nThe Bottom Line:\n\nDon't listen to naysayers: Licence to Kill is not as bad a Bond movie as people claim it to be. It will never be up there with Goldfinger or The Spy Who Loved Me, but its attempt to take Bond down the darker road the franchise currently travels is an admirable, inspired, but uneven one. Blu-ray brings nothing more than shinier picture and better audio to the movie, and Bond fans should give it another shot."
