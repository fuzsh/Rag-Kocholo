        "text": "Movie poster\n\nCountry United Kingdom\n\nUnited States Directed by John Glen Release Date 1989 Language English Distributor MGM/UA Entertainment Company\n\nMain Cast Character Actor James Bond Timothy Dalton Pam Bouvier Carey Lowell M Robert Brown Q Desmond Llewelyn Franz Sanchez Robert Davi Miss Moneypenny Caroline Bliss Lupe Lamora Talisa Soto Milton Krest Anthony Zerbe Felix Leiter David Hedison Dario Benicio del Toro\n\nLicence to Kill is the 16th entry in the official James Bond film series. The 1989 sequel (which was the first not to bear the title of an Ian Fleming novel or short story) finds Bond on a personal mission to take down the drug lord responsible for an attack on his CIA friend Felix Leiter and his wife. Licence to Kill co-stars Carey Lowell, Robert Davi, Benicio del Toro, Talisa Soto, and Wayne Newton and was the final Bond film directed by John Glen and the final film to star Timothy Dalton as Agent 007.\n\nThe following weapons were used in the film Licence to Kill:\n\nWARNING! THIS PAGE CONTAINS SPOILERS!\n\nPistols\n\nWalther PPK\n\nJames Bond (Timothy Dalton) carries his usual Walther PPK as his weapon of choice throughout the film. However, this particular PPK is a WWII-era German Waffenamt variant (it should be noted that the PPK used in Licence To Kill was sourced from Stembridge Gun Rentals instead of Bapty and Co. since the movie was filmed entirely in the US and Mexico). This is most likely the same PPK Dalton had carried in the previous film, The Living Daylights.\n\nWalther P5\n\nDuring the tour of Sanchez' drug lab, Dario (Benicio del Toro) pulls a Walther P5 on Bond. A P5 was used by Bond in Octopussy.\n\nTaurus PT92\n\nDuring the pre-credits sequence, Felix Leiter (David Hedison) hands James Bond (Timothy Dalton) a Taurus PT92 \"just in case\". Bond uses it during the shootout against the henchmen that open fire, using it moments later to shoot the Jeep's left front tire. Milton Krest (Anthony Zerbe) uses a PT92 after Bond uses a spear gun to impale a diver and jumps off. The film's armorer states clearly its a Taurus PT92 and not a Beretta 92FS.\n\nHeckler & Koch P9S\n\nBraun (Guy De Saint Cyr) is armed with a Heckler & Koch P9S. He is later seen carrying it on the Wave Krest.\n\nBeretta 950 Jetfire\n\nPam (Carey Lowell) carries a stainless steel Beretta 950 Jetfire as her sidearm throughout the film, giving one to Bond, and grabbing a spare one out of her purse when Bond leaves to check the hotel room. She also notably uses her Jetfire when she meets Professor Joe Butcher (Wayne Newton) when she goes to \"study\" with him.\n\nBrowning Hi-Power\n\nCol. Heller (Don Stroud) carries a Browning Hi-Power throughout the film. Another appears to be used by one of Sanchez's men.\n\nRevolvers\n\nRuger Security Six\n\nEd Killifer (Everett McGill) draws a stainless steel Ruger Security Six on Bond in Krest's warehouse.\n\nSmith & Wesson Model 19\n\nBill, one of the security guards at Milton Krest's warehouse, carries a Smith & Wesson Model 19 revolver.\n\nSmith & Wesson Model 19 (Snub)\n\nKwang (Cary-Hiroyuki Tagawa) appears to pull a Smith & Wesson Model 19 Snub Nose when Heller and the military close in. Franz Sanchez (Robert Davi) also carries a Smith & Wesson Model 19 Snubnose that he fires at Kwang. The snubnose also appears to be the revolver carried by MI6 agents at the Hemingway House when Bond escapes.\n\nSmith & Wesson Model 15\n\nWhen Bond hijacks the seaplane full of money, one of the pilots pulls a Smith & Wesson Model 15 on Bond and attempts to shoot him with it (instead shooting a package of money), but Bond knocks it out of the pilot's hand. Seen in the holsters of Florida Keys police officers.\n\nSmith & Wesson Model 66\n\nDario (Benicio del Toro) grabs a Smith & Wesson Model 66 from one of his henchmen in the bar and uses it to fire at Bond and Pam as they get away on the boat. These appear to be the revolvers carried by Key West police officers as well.\n\nSubmachine Guns\n\nHeckler & Koch HK94A3 (Chopped and Converted)\n\nMany of Sanchez's henchmen are armed with H&K HK94A3s chopped and converted to resemble MP5A3 submachine guns. Dario (Benicio del Toro) carries one while in the jeep in the pre-credits sequence. The guard (Carl Ciarfalio) at Milton Krest's warehouse carries one, as do several of Sanchez's men during the final car chase. The majority of the film was produced in both the US and Mexico and the production crew sourced their weapons from Stembridge Gun Rentals instead of Bapty and Co (the traditional armorers for the James Bond movies).\n\nIMI Micro Uzi\n\nPerez (Alejandro Bracho) and Sanchez (Robert Davi) himself use Micro Uzis. Interestingly, if you listen carefully when Sanchez fires his Micro Uzi at Bond at the start of the truck chase, the bullet impacts against the tanker plink out the opening notes of the James Bond theme. Sanchez also uses his micro Uzi to \"cut overhead\" after Truman-Lodge (Anthony Starke) sarcastically congratulated him on an \"eighty-million dollar write-off\".\n\nAssault Rifles\n\nColt Commando Carbine\n\nFelix Leiter and DEA agents Hawkins (Grand L. Bush) and Mullens (Rafer Johnson) during the pre-credits sequence, are armed with Colt Commando Carbines.\n\nColt M16A1\n\nM16A1 rifles are held by DEA agents and SWAT officers that escort the prison van carrying Sanchez. The soldiers in the fictional country of Isthmus also carry M16A1 rifles. These rifles are fitted with M16A2 handguards.
