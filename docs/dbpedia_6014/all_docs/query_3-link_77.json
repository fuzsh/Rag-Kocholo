        "text": "Paix à la paix\n\nHymne, pour voix seule (Hymn, for solo voice)\n\nCharles-Valentin Alkan’s hymn for solo voice Paix à la paix was discovered by musicologist Hugh Macdonald. An account of his discovery can be found in the Alkan Society Bulletin no 90 (January 2014), pp 5-6 (available online at http://www.alkansociety.org/Publications/Society-Bulletins/society-bulletins.html). In brief, Macdonald found the autograph manuscript en passant while searching for a hymn by Georges Bizet in an uncatalogued box in the French Archives Nationales. Both Bizet’s and Alkan’s pieces were written for a competition for an anthem to be sung at the Paris Exhibition of 1867. The brief was to set a text either by Gustave Choquet or François Coppée, for solo voice or massed voices – presumably a performance en plein air was envisaged.\n\nce-bi1palp1\n\nAscent\n\nfor piccolo trumpet\n\nThe impetus for this piece came when Simon Desbruslais asked if I would write an étude for piccolo trumpet, as part of a project aimed at gathering new repertoire for the instrument. Inspired by Simon’s dazzling playing, the original idea of writing a short étude quickly gave way to plans for a longer, more ambitions work, exploring the character and virtuosity of this wonderful and exciting instrument.\n\nce-jc2a1\n\nde bronze sonore\n\nfor soprano, alto, flute, clarinet and viola\n\nThis piece was written as part of a project celebrating Schoenberg’s Pierrot Lunaire, and sets a portion of text taken from The Dandy, the third piece in Schoenberg’s famous setting of Albert Giraud’s poems. Here, Giraud’s original French text is used, specifically the four-line extract shown below. This particular verse was chosen because of its remarkable central image of a sonorous, resonant bronze basin, suffused with a swirling mass of sound and light.\n\nce-jc2dbs1\n\nEllipse\n\nfor flute and harp\n\nEllipse takes its inspiration from Rhythm Vessel, a work by the sculptor and ceramicist Ashraf Hanna. Rhythm Vessel is made of raku-fired earthenware and its surface is carved with an intricate pattern of curved and straight lines. The rhythmic sweep and energy of this surface design inspired the curving lines and circling patterns that emerge as the music develops. In addition, the form of the piece reflects the firing process used in the creation of Rhythm Vessel, beginning with stillness then gradually increasing in energy, movement and volatility, reaching a climactic moment of intense heat before sinking back to relative calm as the material cools.\n\nce-jc2e1\n\nFlourish\n\nfor two pianos\n\nFlourish is an exuberant and raucous piece, woven from simple interlocking rhythmic patterns interspersed with fleeting and sinuous melodic lines. Everything in the piece is built from the interval of the open fifth, heard in the first bar, which gives the music it’s bright, ringing quality and celebratory atmosphere.\n\nce-jc2f1\n\nShadow-line\n\nfor solo viola\n\nShadow-line is a short work exploring the viola’s rich, natural resonance and its ability to carve out sustained, sonorous lines. Much of the piece derives from the interval of the major seventh, heard at the opening, along with its various inversions, especially the minor second, which features more and more as the piece develops. Structurally the piece is simple, as short fragments gradually expand and coalesce into longer, more sweeping lines that coil their way from start to finish. The piece emerges from the viola’s lowest note and returns there at the end, with the final passage a muted ‘shadow’ of the opening; a circle that isn’t a circle, a return that isn’t a return.\n\nce-jc2sl1\n\nSigns – Paths – Landscapes\n\nfor wind quintet and piano\n\nThe initial impetus for this piece was a fascination with landscape painting, in particular the surreal landscapes of Paul Nash and the visceral seascapes of the American abstract painter Jon Schueler. In the end, though, whilst the paintings of Nash and Schueler hover in the background, the piece does not seek to portray specific landscapes, either real or imagined. Instead, the landscapes here are abstract musical ones, with the idea of landscape a metaphor, not just for a sense of place, but also for a sense of potential and possibility; a place to be and a place from which to look beyond.\n\nce-jc2spl1\n\nTendril\n\nfor solo cello\n\nTendril explores the interplay of two sharply contrasting ideas, heard in the opening bars of the piece, both of which are about movement and growth, expressed in different ways. In the first idea the pitches are static but are enlivened from within by changes of timbre and dynamic, while in the second idea the pitches move quickly, in a fleeting and fragile rising figure that is the tendril of the title. As the piece progresses both ideas change and develop, releasing new material and transforming in character and identity, with the tendril idea acting as catalyst throughout. Natural harmonics, hinted at in the opening few bars, appear as a punctuating idea at several points, eventually transforming into the lilting, crystalline passage that closes the piece.\n\nce-jc2t1\n\nColapisci and the Suspension Bridge\n\nlyric opera in one act for soloists, choir, orchestra and prepared electronics\n\nLibretto by Federico Berti.\n\nIt was a meeting with the singer/songwriter Federico Berti that led to the birth of an opera which, going to the root of popular theatre, unites in itself oral tradition and naive orchestration, as if written with jet.\n\nce-dv1csb1\n\nAngelic Incantations\n\n(Spell No.9) for alto suka solo and vocal ensemble of eight voices\n\nCommissioned by the Polish Ministry of Culture for, and dedicated to, Maria Pomianowska.\n\nce-av1ai1\n\nAssynt to Letterewe\n\nshort version for mixed ensemble\n\nThis work was inspired by the panorama of shapes of distant mountain peaks in the North West Highlands of Scotland, as seen from the ferry from Ullapool to Stornoway, in early September 2021. These shapes are so varied and fascinating that I couldn’t stop looking at them and photographing them as the ferry gradually retreated from the mainland and the panorama widened. I think these shapes are very expressive and musical – so they became the starting point for this chamber work.\n\nThis version of the piece was written for students to perform in a course in playing contemporary ensemble music at the University of Manchester in 2022.\n\nce-rw1atl1"
