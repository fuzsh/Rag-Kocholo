It is pub- lished in a very limited edition, designed primarily for distribution to institutions having collections of prints ; and beyond this, so far as may be practicable, for exchange in return for publications similar in nature. It is essentially a reference work, so that its presence in the leading libraries will naturally suffice for the purposes of the general public. General distribution, such as is customary in the case of the ordi- nary publications of the Library, will not therefore be feasible in the case of this. Such persons or institutions as may not come within the scope of the above distribution may secure copies at cost price from the Superintendent of Documents, however, so far as his supply per- mits.

After his death it was presented to the United States by Mrs. Hubbard, to be deposited in the Library of Congress as a memorial of him. The terms and circumstances of the gift are set forth below (see pp. IX et seq.) The collection contains 2,707 prints, which are divided into different schools, as follows: American 114 Danish 2 Dutch 380 English 588 Flemish 96 French 688 German 594 Italian 214 Russian 5 Scandinavian 3 Spanish 6 2,690 Original drawings 17 2,707 Catalogues of such collections, which are more than the mere alphabetical lists issued by dealers, may gain additional interest or render a more valuable service by a fuller description than these attempt, or by references to authorities. The interest and value of the present one will, it is hoped, be enhanced by both descrip- tion and references. The admirable British Museum lists of German, Dutch, and French schools have been used for the dates of the engravers. Miiller's \"Allge- meines Kiinstler-Lexicon \" has been found invaluable for dates of artists. When- vm PREFATORY NOTE ever a question of dates has arisen, the authority of best repute has generally been adopted, but not without an examination and comparison of the evidence. The prints of which the names of the engravers have not been found are placed last, under the heading Anonymous. They have been measured and described with the hope that collectors who may be interested will aid in their identification. For the sympathetic sketch of Mr. Hubbard, the Library is indebted to one who knew intimately both his career and his characteristics. ARTHUR JEFFREY PARSONS Chief of Division of Prints HERBERT PUTNAM ^librarian of Congress Washington, January, 1905. THE GIFT The Gardiner Greene Hubbard Collection was offered to the Library of Congress during the administration of Mr. John Russell Young, as Librarian, in 1898. The terms and circumstances of the gift were set forth in his annual report for that year, from which the subjoined correspondence and record are taken: LIBRARY OF CONGRESS, March 30, 1898. SIR: Your Librarian has the honor to report that he has received a letter from Mrs. Gertrude M. Hubbard, of Washington, in which she gives to the American people, to be preserved for their use in the Library of Congress, the art collections of her late husband, Gardiner Greene Hubbard. The nature of the gift will be explained in the following correspondence: WASHINGTON, D. C. , March 81, 1898. MY DEAR SIR: I hereby offer to the Congressional Library, for the benefit of the people of the United States, the collection of engravings made by my husband, the late Gardiner Greene Hubbard, and in addition thereto the art books, to be treated as part of the collection. This disposition of the collection, the gathering of which was to him the pleasure of many years, chiefly devoted to the welfare of his fellow-men, is in accordance with his wishes, and is that which would give him the greatest satisfaction. I desire that a suitable gallery in the Library be devoted to this collection and such additions as may from time to time be made to it, to be known as the \"Gardiner Greene Hubbard Gallery,\" where it can be accessible to the public, to be studied and enjoyed under such reasonable regulations as may be made by Congress or by the authority to whom Congress may delegate the control of the Congressional Library. Accompanying the collection is a bust of Mr. Hubbard, by Gaetano Trenta- nove, which I desire may be kept in a suitable place in the gallery. I propose during my lifetime to add to the collection from time to time, and in my will to make provision for increasing the collection by creating a fund of $20,000, to be placed in the hands of trustees, the interest of which is to be used IX x GARDINER GREENE HUBBARD COLLECTION by the Librarian of Congress in the purchase of additional engravings, it being my understanding that the expense incident to the proper care of this collection will be borne by the Congressional Library, and not be a charge against this fund. I am, very sincerely yours, GERTRUDE M. HUBBARD. Hon. JOHN RUSSELL YOUNG, Librarian of the Congressional Library, Washington, D. C. MARCH 28, 1898. DEAR MADAM: 1 have the honor to acknowledge your letter in which you present to the people of the United States the works of art which belonged to your late husband, Gardiner Greene Hubbard, and wherein you likewise convey the wish that they be preserved in the Library of Congress. As the Librarian of Congress, it gives me the greatest pleasure to acknowledge this act of munifi- cence and to express the gratitude which all must feel over so noble an addition to the art treasures of the nation. The accumulation of this priceless collection by your husband was, as you say, the pleasure of many years of a life chiefly devoted to the welfare of his fellow-men, and those in the direction of the Library will take pride in so carrying out his wishes that it will not alone remain as a commemoration of the far-seeing generosity of the giver, but, as was his desire, be ever accessible to the people for their benefit and instruction. Your letter has been submitted to the Joint Committee on the Library for official consideration and for such instructions as will enable the Librarian to carry its suggestions into eifect. Yours, very sincerely, JOHN RUSSELL YOUNG, Librarian of Congress. Mrs. GERTRUDE M. HUBBARD. The collection of the late Mr. Hubbard has long been regarded by expert judges of art, familiar with its contents, as in many respects the most instructive and valuable in the country. That distinguished gentleman gave many years to its accumulation, grudging neither pains nor expense to obtain the finest examples of the masters in the various modern schools. Germany is seen in the works of Schongauer and Albrecht Diirer. There are specimens of the Italian artists, Marcantonio Raimondi's engravings after Raphael, as well as the works of Carracci, Spagnoletto, Piranesi, and Raphael Morghen. The Flemish school contributes achievements of Lucas van Leyden, a contemporary of Durer, and likewise of Vorsterman and Paul Pontius, who worked under the eye of Rubens. The collection contains, as your Librarian is informed, the largest number THE GIFT xi of Rembrandts in the United States, many of rarity and value. There are examples of Suyderhoef , Teniers, and others, and it is believed that there is not a well-known Flemish engraver from the time of Rembrandt to that of Josef Israels who does not find a place. The French school opens with the seventeenth century, embracing the works of Claude Lorrain and other masters. Mr. Hubbard showed his historical taste by a unique gathering together of the portraits of Frederick the Great and Napoleon — a hundred of Frederick, three times as many of Napoleon. The English school includes the work of Delaram, in the early part of the seventeenth century, as well as what was done by Hogarth, Sir Joshua Reynolds, Sir Robert Strange, and Turner. The American section opens with Paul Revere, who drew the Harvard University in 1780, and contains specimens of every noted American engraver since that time. As the committee will see from this enumeration, the value of this collection is not alone because of its interest, merit, and beauty, but for its educational utility as illustrative of the evolution of modern art. And when it is remembered that we have already in the Library of Congress between 7,000 and 8,000 engravings and etchings, mainly the work of American artists of our own day, coming to us under the operation of the copyright law, the addition of what is now given by Mrs. Hubbard will make our department of graphic arts one of the largest and most distinctively representative in the world. The conditions attached to this gift are respectfully recommended to the favorable attention of the committee. It is suggested that a suitable apartment in the new Library building be devoted to this collection, as well as to such additions to it as will be made from time to time, and that it should be known as the \"Gardiner Greene Hubbard Gallery.\" In furtherance of this wish, your Librarian would recommend the setting aside of a suitable apartment, and that the bust of Mr. Hubbard, by Gaetano Trentanove, which accompanies this bequest, should have a place. A competent person will be detailed from the Library staff to take charge of the collection, have it properly catalogued and annotated, and see that, as Mrs. Hubbard requests, it is ever kept accessible to the public for their study and enjoyment. Yours, respectfully, JOHN RUSSELL YOUNG. Hon. GEORGE PEABODT WETMORE, Chairman of the Joint Committee on the Library of Congress. xii GARDINER GREENE HUBBARD COLLECTION IN THE SENATE OF THE UNITED STATES, April 4, 1898. Mr. Wetmore, from the Committee on the Library, reported the following joint resolution; which was read the first and second times by unanimous consent: JOINT RESOLUTION authorizing the Librarian of Congress to accept the collection of engravings proposed to be donated to the Library of Congress by Mrs. Gertrude M. Hubbard. Resolved by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, That the Librarian of Congress is hereby empowered and directed to accept the offer of Mrs. Gertrude M. Hubbard, widow of the late Gardiner Greene Hubbard, communicated to him by the following letter, on the terms and conditions therein stated, and to communicate to Mrs. Hubbard the grate- ful appreciation of Congress of the public spirit and munificence manifested by said gift: WASHINGTON, D. C., March 21, 1898. MY DEAR SIR: I hereby offer to the Congressional Library, for the benefit of the people of the United States, the collection of engravings made by my husband, the late Gardiner Greene Hubbard, and in addition thereto the art books, to be treated as part of the collection. This disposition of the collection, the gathering of which was to him the pleasure of many years, chiefly devoted to the welfare of his fellow-men, is in accordance with his wishes, and is that which would give him the greatest satisfaction. I desire that a suitable gallery in the Library be devoted to this collection and such additions as may from time to time be made to it, to be known as the \" Gardiner Greene Hubbard Gallery,\" where it can be accessible to the public, to be studied and enjoyed under such reasonable regulations as may be made by Congress or by the authority to whom Congress may designate the control of the Congressional Library. Accompanying the collection is a bust of Mr. Hubbard, by Gaetano Trentanove, which I desire may be kept in a suitable place in the gallery. I propose, during my lifetime, to add to the collection from time to time, and in my will to make provision for increasing the collection by creating a fund of $20,000, to be placed in the hands of trustees, the interest of which is to be used by the Librarian of Congress in the purchase of additional engravings, it being my under- THE GIFT xin standing that the expenses incident to the proper care of this collection will be borne by the Congressional Library, and not be a charge against this fund. I am, very sincerely yours, GERTRUDE M. HUBBARD. Hon. JOHN RUSSELL YOUNG, Librarian of the Congressional Library, Washington, D. C. On June 27, 1898, the matter was thus disposed of in the Senate: Mr. HOAR. I ask unanimous consent to call up the joint resolution (S. R. 139) authorizing the Librarian of Congress to accept the collection of engravings proposed to be donated to the Library of Congress by Mrs. Gertrude M. Hubbard. There being no objection, the Senate, as in Committee of the Whole, resumed the consideration of the joint resolution. Mr. HOAR. It has already been read. I move what I send to the desk as an amendment to the resolution. The SECRETARY. After the word \"stated,\" in line 7, it is proposed to insert: \"Except that instead of naming the gallery in the Library as therein proposed, the collection shall be known and styled as the Gardiner Greene Hubbard Collection, it not being, in the opinion of Congress, desirable to call parts of the public buildings after the names of individual citizens, and that the bust therein named be accepted and kept in a suitable place, to be designated by the Joint Committee on the Library.\" The amendment was agreed to. Mr. HOAR. As I remember the circumstances, a motion to recommit the joint resolution was pending when it was last under consideration. I am authorized by the mover of that motion to ask that it be treated as withdrawn. The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Pettus in the Chair). The motion to recommit is withdrawn. The joint resolution was reported to the Senate as amended, and the amendment was concurred in. The joint resolution was ordered to be engrossed for a third reading, read the third time, and passed. This joint resolution was subsequently passed by the House of Representatives, and became a law by the signature of the President July 7, 1898. SKETCH OF GARDINER GREENE HUBBARD The collection of engravings, of which this is the catalog, represents (on the part of the collector) many years of long searching, patient waiting, and a multitude of pleasant experiences. As one turns over the leaves and notes the variety and range of subjects illustrated by the engravings, one seems to see revealed, in a degree, the character and tastes of the man who gathered them together. He was no mere dilettante — no mere collector of prints for collection's sake, but one who loved the art, both for itself and for what it represented. The broad scope of the collection declares his breadth of mind; its comprehensiveness, his thoroughness; its catholicity, his own fair-mindedness, good judgment, and love of truth. So much of himself is wrought into the fabric of the collection that some knowledge of Mr. Hubbard himself, and the purposes swaying his selection of certain pictures rather than others, seems essential to a proper understanding of them. Mr. Hubbard was the son of Samuel Hubbard, a justice of the supreme court of Massachusetts, and of Mary Anne, daughter of Gardiner Greene, being thus of gentle New England stock. Born in 1822 (August 25), at Cambridge, he graduated from Dartmouth College in 1843, chose the profession of law, and for twenty-five years practiced in Boston, meanwhile living in Cambridge. A good lawyer, interested in his profession, its limits never bounded his horizon. Very early he was planning the municipal betterment of his home town and engaging in industrial and educational projects which by their novelty attracted his alert mind. Thus it was that he organized the first gas and water works of Cambridge, and connected that city with Boston through the first horse railroad operated outside of New York City. He served ten years as chairman of the Massachusetts State board of education (of which Phillips Brooks was also a member), was actively interested in the introduction of drawing in the public schools — entering wedge of the present XV xvi GARDINER GREENE HUBBARD COLLECTION system of manual training — and had supervision of the State educational exhibit at the Philadelphia Centennial in 1876. He procured the passage of laws which authorized the opening of State schools, where deaf children could be taught to speak; and lowered the age of admission from 12 to 6 years. This Mr. Hubbard did almost single-handed in the face of enormous opposition from the vested interests of established institutions whose pupils were taught only by sign methods. The founding of the Clarke School, with himself as president, followed. Thus Mr. Hubbard inaugurated a movement which is spreading all over America and the British dominions, even to India. It was characteristic that in thus seeking simply and unselfishly to procure for the children of others a great blessing which he had already secured to his own child, Mr. Hubbard came to the opportunity which gave him his greatest fame and fortune. For it was upon this common ground of philanthropic interest in the education of the deaf that he first met Alexander Graham Bell, with whom he later became associated in the organization of the American Bell Telephone Company. Thus the philanthropist, through whose efforts the first successful articulation school for the deaf in America was established, became eminent as founder of this great business corporation. In 1875 he was appointed by President Grant chairman of a commission to investigate the transportation of the mails, a position for which several years' study of the problems of the post-office and telegraph services had eminently fitted him. He strongly advocated a modified form of governmental ownership of telegraphs, and his subsequent connection with the telephone company did little to alter his views. In 1877 he removed permanently to Washington, engaging in the establishment of the telephone company along the lines it has since followed. He speedily took his place in all the different phases of Washington life, social, scientific, and political. To recapitulate all the enterprises with which he was associated is unnecessary; but to indicate the breadth of his interests it may suffice to note that he was first president of the National Geographic Society, Regent of the Smithsonian Institution, governor of the District of Columbia Society of Colonial Wars, president of the board of trustees of the Church of the Covenant, chairman of the Joint Commission of the Affiliated Scientific Societies (now the Washington Academy of Sciences), a founder of the Memorial Association of Washington, and personally instrumental in securing to it the house in which Lincoln died; a trustee and LL.D. of Columbian University. These interests in Washington did not prevent him from serving as a director in SKETCH OF GARDINER GREENE HUBBARD xvii several New York banks. His last services to the world were in connection with the Nashville Exposition, where he acted as chairman of the commission of awards, and with the movement in favor of the Hay-Pauncefote arbitration treaty. Indeed, its first meeting in Washington was held in his house and was called to order by him. Such in brief are the chief outlines of a life of seventy -five years — the life of one of whom others have said that he was \"a man of tireless energy, exhaustless capacity for varied enterprises.\" \"Now that Mr. Hubbard has gone from us forever,\" said his friend, the Hon. William L. Wilson, president of Washington and Lee University, and Postmaster-General in Cleveland's Cabinet, \"we begin to realize how large, how unique, and how beautiful a part he bore in the social, charitable, and intellectual life of his adopted city. * * * No home in Wash- ington has dispensed a more charming and constant hospitality than his. He came to Washington with an acknowledged social position, with well-known and honorable lineage, with liberal education and refined tastes, with large and successful experience in the business world, with a mind stored and broadened and liberalized by much reading and much contact with men and things in his own and other countries. For such a man it was inevitable that he should become associated with every form of charitable, educational, and scientific work in this country that appealed to a man of public and patriotic spirit, and if he became connected with them, it was inevitable that he should become a leader in them.\" It is not known when Mr. Hubbard first became specially interested in prints and engravings, but his responsiveness to beauty showed itself in his boyhood by his love of flowers and appreciation of natural scenery, and later in his library of fine editions of works by good authors. His first introduction to the masterpieces of etching and engraving was perhaps through the Gray Collection, now in Harvard University. Through the kindness of his friend, Mr. Thies, who was cataloguing the collection, portfolios of rare beauty were brought to him from time to time, and their contents eagerly studied. Whatever impression they may have made did not appear then, however. It was during some years spent abroad, much later, that his own collection made its most rapid growth. Most of the prints were purchased at large shops on the boulevards of Paris or in London, but Mr. Hubbard often sought his way through narrow winding streets of the old cities, guided only by his unerring sense of locality; and up long dark stairs to dingy little rooms, where in portfolios were hidden away treasures of untold value. And when, after careful examination, he made his purchase, how joyful the heart, though empty the purse, with which he 30705—04 ii xvui GARDINER GREENE HUBBARD COLLECTION would turn homeward. Thus, almost one by one, were ad4ad the Kembrandts and Diirers in which the collection is so rich. Mr. Hubbard liked to throw a little side light on the history of his collection and of France by relating how all his Napoleons and other French royal and imperial prints had to be purchased out of France, for at that time the Republican scare against pretenders and all their works ran highest, and nothing that might remind Parisians of past glories could be sold. After his return home processions of engravings, sent on approval by dealers, passed through his library, and for years it was a familiar sight to see him examining them by magnifying glass and microscope, or hunting references in his big books. How he made the time was a great mystery, for he was to the last a busy man; yet his other work was never neglected, and he was never too absorbed to come forward to welcome a visitor and listen to what he had to say with the courtesy and sympathy that were ever ready and ever kindly. Mr. Hubbard's interest in his engravings was distinctly twofold — artistic and literary; and it is hard to say under what aspect they really appealed to him most strongly. He loved the aesthetic beauty of correct lines, the play of light and shade in the Rembrandts, the Madonnas of Raphael Mengs, and the Cathedrals of Haig. He thoroughly enjoyed the sly humor of some of the old etchers, and would point with great entertainment to the incongruous black V-shaped modern dress adorning a lady in one of the Holy Families. He carefully studied and well understood the technique of the different methods of engraving. Several distinct series in the collection bear witness to the care he bestowed in elucidating methods, notably his many copies of the same Madonna by different engravers or etchers. He specially liked to direct attention to his Landseer's dog series which show the same plate in different stages of completion. But all this did not content him. He must know all that had been written of their makers and of the schools to which they belonged. The wide reading all this involved was part of his pleasure in his collection, and is represented in the library included with it. In this literary aspect must be considered the historical portraits and pictures which form such a large part of the collection and reveal another aspect of Mr. Hubbard's many-sided character. A warm-hearted man, with strong personal likings, he carried this trait into the past and admitted the greatest admiration for certain men, about whom he sought to know everything that books and pictures SKETCH OF GARDINER GREENE HUBBARD xix could tell. No one glancing over the engravings can remain long in doubt that Oliver Cromwell and Napoleon Buonaparte commanded his liveliest interest. The /strong prominent features of the former, with or without the famous wart, and the sharper, more delicate face of the latter dominate the collection. Around these two as centers Mr. Hubbard gathered other portrait engravings illustrating historical events, manners, or customs, making the masterpieces of great artists contribute to their glory. The Van Dycks are chiefly the English ones which set forth the lineaments of James and Charles, their families and courtiers, opponents of the grim Puritan. When he left it, the collection was probably the largest and most complete in Napoleoniana of any in America. In this series art is frankly subordinated to the story. The masterpieces of David, Gerard, Delaroche, and Meissonier are as so much incense burnt at the shrine of Mr. Hubbard's great hero. Beginning with Madame Mere and Charles Buonaparte the marvelous story is carried down through all its alternations of light and shade — the joy of the Battle of Arcola, the prescience of the Passage of the Alps, the terrible yet equally significant Pest House of Jaffa, the splendor of the Coronation, the tenderness of the father in his cabinet — the beginning of the end in the Retreat from Moscow at the Passage of the Beresina, the stern despair on the Bellerophon, on to the lonely grave at St. Helena, with its weeping willow, and beyond, to the Apotheosis twenty years later. Through his grouping of his pictures Mr. Hubbard continues as powerfully and scarce more silently to plead for his hero now and here, as formerly in his own library or in the lecture rooms of universities or art schools where he occasionally showed them. His especial delight was to gather a little group of appreciative friends about the easel in his library and, with an enthusiasm that never wearied, to place before them print after print. But he was generous of his time and strength in bringing them to remoter audiences, even at the expense of long and tedious journeys. He was not a finished orator, but what he had to say was said simply and clearly, and it always held his audience deeply attentive. Like the geographic lantern slides with which he illustrated such occasions, his talks were both suggestive and informing. The greatest pleasure which Mr. Hubbard had in his engravings was in thus sharing them with others. With them, as with everything else that was his, he sought to be \"the helper of his fellow-men.\" And that this collection, into which he put so much of himself, which was so much a part of himself for so many years, may continue to carry on his work of helping his fellow -men, it has been given by Mrs. Hubbard to the American people.
