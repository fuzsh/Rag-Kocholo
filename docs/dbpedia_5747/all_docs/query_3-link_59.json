        "text": "Watching a Munster scrum retreating rapidly in Galway last weekend prompted a few questions, one of which was: whatever happened to James Cronin? Good enough to have played for Ireland (three caps under Joe Schmidt) and to have spent nine seasons at Munster (143 caps, 20 tries), the loose-head prop from Ballincollig was released by the club in mysterious circumstances at the end of the 2020-21 season, at a point when he had just turned 30 and was approaching his peak.\n\nIt turns out that he is thriving in the Gallagher Premiership with Leicester Tigers, who meet Harlequins at the Stoop this afternoon. The best way to measure his progress? This will be his sixth straight start.\n\n“I’ve never had six games on the bounce"
