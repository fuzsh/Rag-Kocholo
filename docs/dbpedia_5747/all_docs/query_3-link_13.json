        "text": "{Boston – Massachusetts}\n\nLocal doctor, Dr. James Cronin was recently recognized as one of the BEST Neuropathy Treatment Physicians in the country by The International Neuropathy Association. This advanced training and presentation took place at the NEURODoc Peripheral Neuropathy training facilities in Jupiter, Florida. The certification was presented by the Co-Chairman of the I.N.A, Dr. Eric Kaplan as well as members of their board representing the country. Peripheral Neuropathy is a condition that affects millions of people and often causes Leg Pain, Foot Pain, Knee Pain, Burning, Numbness, Tingling, Pins & Needles, Arm Pain, Loss of Strength, Balance & Coordination Problems and More….\n\nThe advanced training showcased a number of the latest natural options for care and revealed some of the latest medical technology which now has helped so many patients who have suffered from this debilitating condition. As a mainstay of patients who suffer from Peripheral Neuropathy have had to depend on medications such as Lyrica, Cymbalta & Neurontin which unfortunately continue to provide less than favorable results as well as a host of unwanted side-effects, there finally is a better treatment option for so many patients.\n\nMedical research has also found that a high number of patients who suffer from Diabetes also become much more likely to suffer from Peripheral Neuropathy as often the nerve fibers in the lower extremities are affected. One of the key components to reducing the damaging effects of Peripheral Neuropathy is being seen by a doctor who has this specialized training. Dr. Cronin continues to provide the latest & most cost-effective options for the treatment of Peripheral Neuropathy. His facilities are considered state-of-the- art and Dr. Cronin is committed to providing 1st class care to patients who often travel far to seen Dr. Cronin, who has made a commitment to help his patients avoid Lyrica, Cymbalta, Neurontin & unnecessary procedures. NEURODoc Neuropathy Treatment Centers provides safe, gentle & effective relief for upwards of 87% of patients that qualify for care."
