He was such a blessing in my life.\n\nGil loved his mother in law Pauline and was always taking her wherever she needed to go. One of there many trips were to the flea markets and tag sales where Gil would pick up lawn mowers, snow blowers, weed wackers, and discarded lawn mowers that said free, as the home owner said it’s not working and you can have it for parts. He took and brought them to his garage to tinker on, and got it running.\n\nGil leaves his only child, a daughter Paige Cronin of Naugatuck, and his step children, Jacqueline Maringola of Waterbury, Tracy Longo of Wolcott, and Michele Maringola of Brentwood, CA; He also leaves his brother Charles Cronin and his wife Anne of Woodbury. He leaves five grandchildren, Stephanie Vivenzio and her significant other Bledar “ Billy” Medolli , Christopher Maringola, Rosalia Longo, Chloe Costa and Paxton Costa; his great grandchildren, Gaetano and Gabriella Medolli; along with several nieces and nephews. He was predeceased by his step son Robert R. Maringola, Jr.\n\nA Mass of Christian Burial will be celebrated on Monday April 4, 2022 at 10 a.m. at the Basilica of the Immaculate Conception.
