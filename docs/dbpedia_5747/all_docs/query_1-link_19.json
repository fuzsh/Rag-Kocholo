John James also had a Kitchen Dance Party Solo with JLo set to the iconic Salt'nPepa Song \"Push It\".\n\nIn November, 2019, John James had a challenging and thought-provoking role as \"Jonathan Fletcher\" - a nonverbal, 7-year-old autistic boy - in the HBO Limited Series, \"Mrs. Fletcher\", Starring Kathryn Hahn. Without saying a word, John James had a dramatic impact on the Series.\n\nIn June, 2020, John James was a Recurring Guest Star in Season 2 of the AMC Series \"NOS4A2\". This Series is based on the book written by Joe Hill (who is Stephen King's Son and is also the Author of \"Locke & Key\" on Netflix).\n\nIn NOS4A2, John James played \"Mike Demeter\" a neglected, vulnerable and bullied Boy who is abducted in this Supernatural Horror Thriller, Starring Zachary Quinto.\n\nIn October, 2020, John James finished filming his First Lead Role in a Feature Film, a Horror Thriller entitled \"We Need to Do Something\". This Film is coming from the Producers of \"Bird Box\" and the \"Saw\" Series.\n\nIn this Film, John James plays the Role of \"Bobby Crandell,\" the Youngest Member of the Crandell Family.\n\nWhile seeking shelter from a storm, \"Bobby\", along with his Mom (Vinessa Shaw), Dad (Pat Healy) and Older Sister (Sierra McCormick) all become trapped. Hours turn into days, with no hope of rescue, until the real reasons for their plight emerge.\n\nThe Role of Bobby Crandell was both personally rewarding and professionally challenging for John James. In this Lead Role, John James appeared in 27 of the 38 total scenes, with 105 lines of dialogue.\n\n\"We Need to Do Something\" had its Worldwide Premiere at the Tribeca Festival in New York City on June 15th, 2021.\n\nOf the 11.000 + Submissions to the Tribeca Festival in 2021, \"We Need to Do Something\" was one of 66 Feature Films chosen to Premiere and it was 1 of only 3 Feature Films chosen in the Horror Thriller Category.\n\n\"We Need to Do Something\" was Released in Theaters and on Streaming Services on Friday, September 3rd, 2021.\n\nIn the future, John James aspires to be a full time Actor, Film Maker, Director, Artist & Author.\n\nRight now, in his spare time, he loves to sing, Hip Hop dance, read, write short stories, draw, play video games, participate in all sports and overall enjoys just being a Kid.\n\nYou will frequently find John James dancing and singing his way through the Streets and Subways of NYC."
