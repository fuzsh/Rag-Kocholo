        "text": "Leicester Tigers are happy to announce prop James Cronin has renewed his contract with the club.\n\nBorn in Cork in Ireland, Cronin joined Tigers after a stint in France ahead of the 2022/23 season, after representing his hometown club Munster on 143 occasions.\n\nThe 33-year-old made his international debut in 2014, making three appearances for his country.\n\nLeicester Tigers prop, James Cronin said: “I’m delighted to extend my time at the Leicester Tigers.”\n\n“The club is a great place to be at the moment and as a collective we’re all clear on the work required to take us where we want to go.\n\n“The support we get, the appreciation for lads like us in the front row, there’s few clubs in the world that have that and it’s a privilege to play at Mattioli Woods Welford Road.”\n\nCronin has made 28 appearances for the club to date and has featured in eight league games so far this season.\n\nLeicester Tigers General Manager, Richard Wilks said: “There’s no doubt this club loves it front rowers, especially those who have that thirst to scrummage and from day one we knew James would be a great fit.”\n\n“The group, players and staff value what he brings on the field and in the environment and we’re really pleased have him stay with the club.”"
