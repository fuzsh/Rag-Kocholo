        "text": "For many years, Cronin and Babine Bonanza have been well known names in the mining world. James Cronin, who made his home in Spokane, Wash., was well known for his pioneer mining work in both Canada and the U.S. Born in Bantry, Ireland, Cronin came to America at the age of 18. Soon after arriving in New York in 1870, he moved out west. In the Nevada silver mines he learned all there was to be learned in the mining trade. There was not much about a mine, underground or above, that Cronin did not know. He could build a shaft or timber a mine, and he was his own draftsman and mining engineer. His judgement on the value of ore bodies was uncanny.\n\nIn the 1890's, Cronin came up north to Alaska and British Columbia. During one of these exploration trips in the East Kootenay, he located the St. Eugene Mine near Moyie Lake, B.C. The discovery of this mine would establish Cronin's lasting fame in the mining world. The actual discovery was made by an Indian named Peter, who brought some samples to Father Coccola at the St. Eugene Mission. Cronin happened to stop in at that mission and was shown the samples. Subsequently he was taken out to the showing, and the St. Eugene, St. James, and St. Paul claims were staked.\n\nThis property would turn into one of the biggest lead and silver mines in British Columbia. Around $25 million (1925 prices) worth of ore was taken out of the St. Eugene mine.\n\nSoon after that, Cronin rediscovered the War Eagle and Centre Star mines near Rossland, B.C. These properties had been abandoned, but thanks to Cronin, 18 years of production were added to the life of the War Eagle and many million dollars worth of ore..."
