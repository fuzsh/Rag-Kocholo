        "text": "Dr. James Cronin has been treating patients in the greater Boston area for over 25 years and he and his team specialize in bringing patients back to optimal health and wellbeing. Theyâ€™ve treated back and neck pain, whiplash, sciatica, peripheral neuropathy, and accident-related injuries with a whole-body total wellness approach.\n\nDr. Cronin has recently opened Boston Neuropathy Center in Wellesley, Ma with his focus primarily on helping those who have been afflicted with Peripheral Neuropathy. Realizing that nearly thirty million people suffer from this devastating disease and have been told there is no hope, he has devoted his studies and research to develop a program that utilizes a combination of brand new technologies that addresses the cause rather than the symptoms. Our painless treatments utilize non-invasive, FDA cleared technologies to reduce or eliminate the symptoms of peripheral neuropathy in most cases. He consults, trains and networks with health care providers nationwide who are committed to helping individuals who suffer from the devastating effects of Peripheral Neuropathy. Enjoying life with friends, family and loved ones is our goal at Boston Neuropathy Center.\n\nDr. Cronin, a Doctor of Chiropractic from New York Chiropractic College, is a Board- Certified Chiropractor in Massachusetts, licensed by the National Board of Chiropractic Examiners, He has received multiple certifications throughout his career as a Chiropractic Doctor and is a certified member of the International Neuropathy Association (I.N.A)."
