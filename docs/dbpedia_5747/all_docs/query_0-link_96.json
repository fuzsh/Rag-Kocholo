I'd love to find out more about them, especially who James' parents were, so I can continue this branch of my family tree. Here's the information I have.\n\nJames Cronin\n\nBorn 15 Jun 1860 in Listowel, Ireland\n\nDied 05 Apr 1927 in Cook County, Illinois\n\nDeath certificate lists Mary McNamara as his mother, but that's Mary Sullivan's mother\n\nEmmigrated to the US in 1883\n\nMarried Mary Sullivan in 1886 (in Chicago, IL)\n\nMary Margaret Sullivan (possibly Margaret Mary Sullivan?)\n\nBorn 8 Oct 1863 in Kerry, Ireland (not sure if it was Listowel)\n\nOne source lists her from Skehenerin, Listowel, Kerry, Ireland\n\nDied 13 May 1932 in Cook County, Illinois\n\nDeath certificate lists Michael Sullivan and Mary McNamara as parents\n\nEmmigrated to the US in 1881\n\nMessage Board Replies\n\nTopher:\n\nYou may want to search www.irishgenealogy.ie That site has a lot of Co. Kerry church records. Looked at Listowel records. No James Cronin in 1860 but a James in June 1859. You can also search for Mary Margaret in Listowel and across Co. Kerry.\n\nRoger McDonnell\n\nCastlemore Roscommon, IrelandXO Volunteer ☘"
