        "meta_description": "CRONIN – James A. of Indian Land, South Carolina, sadly passed away on July 7, 2022 at 68 years old.  Jim was formerly from Westbury, NY, where he grew up. He attended The Ohio State University and graduated with a Business Management Degree from Adelphi University.    Later, he and his former wife of 25 years, Susan (Strada), moved to Hauppauge and then, Commack, where they raised their two children. Jim was the cherished and devoted father of Holly Ann and James Matthew and loving father-in-law of Martin K. Fiala and Lisa Maria (Porcaro). He was an adoring grandfather, “Papa Jim”, to Thomas, Brooke, Jordan, and Alison. He was predeceased by Michael and Theresa (Doak) and his sister, Patricia.     Professionally, Jim was an Independent IT Consultant who successfully owned and operated three businesses during his life - Data Alternatives Inc. , Systron, Inc. , and New World Solutions, Inc.  Personally, he was kind, creative, generous, and funny. He made many people laugh with his quick wit and smart sense of humor.  He loved his family and was loved deeply in return.  He was an avid life-long golfer, music lover, and concertgoer. He will be sorely missed by not only his family, but by his many friends, golf buddies, and former colleagues.",
