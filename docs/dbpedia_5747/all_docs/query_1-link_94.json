        "text": "I am a retired middle school science teacher, working part-time as an educator at the Denver Museum of Nature and Science. I wrote The Brin Archives as a challenge to learn something new. I have been married for forty years to the love of my life. We raised two incredible sons, and now have three amazing grandchildren to spoil rotten.\n\nI was born in Kansas City, Missouri and lived in Arlington, Virginia before moving to Denver where I attended High School and eventually college at Colorado State University, graduating with a degree in Zoology and a teacher certification. My wife and I currently live near Denver in the small town of Parker.\n\n​\n\nMy science fiction series, The Brin Archives is an epic adventure encompassing an entire galaxy on the verge of destruction. This trilogy, to my amazement and delight, has won critical acclaim and numerous awards. Who would have ever guessed this old, retired science teacher would become a successfully published author? I hope you enjoy my stories.\n\nScience Fiction\n\nHis home world is dead; the victim of a supernova, but this does not stop Karm from attempting to save the Brin, his extinct species. Rescued by an alien race from a derelict spacecraft as a vial of DNA, then cloned, Karm must travel back in time, convince a small team of co-conspirators to join him in his quest, and outmaneuver a power hungry monarch and his fanatic brother, leader of The Faith, both absolutely committed to opposing him.\n\n​\n\nAll of Karm’s plans rest on the untested and controversial cloning theories of the young geneticist Dr. Jontar Rocker, and the abilities of his bodyguard, personal assistant, and surrogate niece, Maripa. Will their combined efforts be enough to overcome the power of the monarchy and the planet’s most influential religion? Will Karm’s secrets destroy the trust of his companions and ruin his campaign to save the Brin?​\n\nScience Fiction\n\nIn this sequel to Hegira, the Brin are thriving on their new world, but will greed, prejudices and old rivalries tear apart their grand civilization? Maliche Rocker, descendant of The Saviors, uncovers a terrible secret and must fight those in power, including members of his own family, to save thousands of innocents from the cruelty of his own people.\n\nScience Fiction\n\nInterstellar war has raged for centuries between the Skae and Gorvin Empires. The Skae claim their efforts to capture and harness the power of a black hole will eliminate all future energy shortages and allow all the planets to thrive and prosper as never before. The Gorvin believe they have evidence proving the existence of a fatal flaw in the Skae’s plans. A flaw which would result in the destruction of half the galaxy.\n\n​\n\nMaliche and Jontar Rocker, along with a small band of Brin and Kolandi companions, must learn which side to believe in order to bring an end to the war. Only travel to the distant past will uncover the truth and reveal the fate of the galaxy. Will what they learn allow them to join with the Skae, the beings who saved the Brin civilization? Or must they betray their ally and fight with the Gorvin to bring peace and a new empyrean to all the planets? Time is running out."
