He made his senior debut in the PRO12 game against Leinster in Thomond Park in 2013 and won the John McCarthy Award for Munster Academy Player of the Year for the 2012/13 season.\n\nAfter just one season of senior rugby, Cronin was selected as part of the Irish senior squad to tour Argentina and made his Test debut in the win over Los Pumas in June 2014. He impressed enough over the following months to be named in the Irish 6 Nations Squad for the 2015 Tournament.\n\nHe was then named in the Emerging Ireland squad for the 2015 World Rugby Tbilisi Cup on 19 May 2015. Impressive form saw the loosehead included in the Ireland squad for the 2016 RBS 6 Nations where he featured off the bench against France.\n\nCronin made his 100th appearance against Ulster in April 2018 and a few months later he signed a two-year contract extension with Munster until June 2021.
