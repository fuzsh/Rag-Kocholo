        "text": "From my list on who killed JFK.\n\nBy Gerald Posner Author\n\nWhy am I passionate about this?\n\nI was in the fourth grade when JFK was assassinated. I grew up in the late 1960s as conspiracy theories about ‘who killed Kennedy’ flourished. Jack Ruby’s murder of Oswald made me suspect the mafia played a role. After Oliver Stone’s controversial 1991 JFK film, I convinced a publisher to allow me to reexamine the assassination. I did not expect to solve the case. Halfway through my research, however, I realized there was an answer to ‘who killed Kennedy.’ It was not what I had expected. I discovered that the story of how a 24-year-old sociopath armed with a $12 rifle managed to kill the president was a far more fascinating one than I could have ever envisioned.\n\nGerald's book list on who killed JFK\n\nWhy did Gerald love this book?\n\nAuthor Priscilla McMillan was at the crossroads of history. She worked as a junior aide for Senator John Kennedy before she went to Moscow as a reporter during the height of the Cold War. There, in 1959, she interviewed an American marine who had recently defected to the Soviet Union. He was Lee Harvey Oswald. After JFK was killed in 1963, McMillan befriended Oswald’s widow, Marina, and spent hundreds of hours interviewing her. The result of McMillan’s unprecedented direct access to the Oswalds is an unmatched personal study of a troubled young man who turned into one of history’s most notorious assassins.\n\nBy Priscilla Johnson McMillan,\n\nWhy should I read it?\n\n1 author picked Marina and Lee as one of their favorite books, and they share why you should read it.\n\nWhat is this book about?\n\n“The single best book ever written on the Kennedy assassination” -- Thomas Mallon, author of Mrs. Paine's Garage: And the Murder of John F. Kennedy\n\n“It is not at all easy to describe the power of Marina and Lee . . . It is far better than any other book about Kennedy . . . Other books about the Kennedy assassination are all smoke and no fire. Marina and Lee burns.” —New York Times Book Review\n\nMarina and Lee is an indispensable account of one of America’s most traumatic events and a classic work of narrative history. In her meticulous—at…\n\nPreview\n\nFrom my list on majestic stories that lift our spirits.\n\nBy Noel Anenberg Author\n\nWhy am I passionate about this?\n\nI enjoyed writing The Karma Kaper. Just as there's tragedy and comedy in every aspect of our lives there's humor in crime. It's fun bringing that humor to my audience. I also believe in justice for all. Sadly, as American courts are currently more concerned with criminals' rights than victims' rights there are no guarantees victims will receive the justice they deserve. No one can predict if a jury of 12 will find a defendant who has committed a crime guilty. Then, there's the highest court of appeal - fiction! Between the covers of a novel, a crafty writer can ensure just verdicts and devise macabre punishments for the bad guys! It doesn't get any better!\n\nNoel's book list on majestic stories that lift our spirits\n\nWhy did Noel love this book?\n\nJohn Steinbeck wrote the Working Days... journals while writing The Grapes of Wrath.\n\nThe intent of the journal was to establish a schedule, including a completion date for the novel. What he reveals about his self-doubt is tonic for any writer who is haunted by the same malaise.\n\nHere is the entry for June 18, \"…I am assailed with my own ignorance and inability. Honesty. If I can keep an honesty to it… If I can do that it will be all my lack of genius can produce. For no one else knows my lack of ability the way I do. I am pushing against it all the time.\"\n\nSometimes, I seem to do a good little piece of work, but when it is done it slides into mediocrity…John Steinbeck’s honesty and humility remind me that self-doubt is a part of the creative process.\n\nI sometimes read entries from…\n\nBy John Steinbeck,\n\nWhy should I read it?\n\n1 author picked Working Days as one of their favorite books, and they share why you should read it.\n\nWhat is this book about?\n\nJohn Steinbeck wrote The Grapes of Wrath during an astonishing burst of activity between June and October of 1938. Throughout the time he was creating his greatest work, Steinbeck faithfully kept a journal revealing his arduous journey toward its completion.\n\nThe journal, like the novel it chronicles, tells a tale of dramatic proportions—of dogged determination and inspiration, yet also of paranoia, self-doubt, and obstacles. It records in intimate detail the conception and genesis of The Grapes of Wrath and its huge though controversial success. It is a unique and penetrating portrait of an emblematic American writer creating an essential American…\n\nPreview\n\nFrom J.M.'s 3 favorite reads in 2023.\n\nBy J.M. Adams Author\n\nWhy did J.M. love this book?\n\nSteve Berry's book couldn’t have been timed any better as 2023 was the 60th anniversary of the Kennedy assassination.\n\nThe pages flew by and kept me up late into the night. I have a history addiction, dating back to my early childhood, and the assassination of JFK has troubled and baffled me as far back as I can remember. The misinformation campaign set forth by the American government has never sat well with anyone who’s done the research, and this book presents the reader with a fresh scenario of what really happened back in November 1963 and the extent of the American coverup.\n\nI’m always delighted to consume an entire library’s worth of new facts and information every time I open a Steve Berry novel.\n\nBy Steve Berry, Grant Blackwood,\n\nWhy should I read it?\n\n1 author picked The 9th Man as one of their favorite books, and they share why you should read it.\n\nWhat is this book about?\n\nFrom New York Times bestselling author of the Cotton Malone series comes a thrilling, action-packed historical adventure that sends Luke Daniels on an international manhunt for the truth about the assassination of President John Kennedy.\n\nLuke Daniels is in London, between assignments with the Magellan Billet, when he receives a frantic call from an old friend. Jillian Stein is in trouble. She made a mistake and now her life may be in danger. She needs Luke’s help. Immediately. Racing to Belgium Luke quickly finds that she was right. A shadow team of highly-trained operatives are there on the hunt. Intervening,…\n\nPreview\n\nFrom my list on the secrets of showbiz and sports stars.\n\nBy Tony Flood Author\n\nWhy am I passionate about this?\n\nI love comedy, showbusiness, mystery and fantasy stories, and sport—and these varied interests have resulted in me writing in various genres as both a journalist and author. My books have all been thoroughly researched and that has helped my crime thrillers receive glowing endorsements from best-selling writer Peter James in the case of Triple Tease and national newspaper journalist Stuart Pink in the case of Stitch Up! - Killer or Victim? My other books have also received excellent endorsements and reviews—fantasy adventure Secret Potion and Laughs and Tears Galore – Short Stories and Poems With Twists, written jointly with my wife Heather Flood, best known for her children's books.\n\nTony's book list on the secrets of showbiz and sports stars\n\nWhy did Tony love this book?\n\nThere have been many books written about Marilyn Monroe, and I have paid tribute to her in my own celebrity book but I feel that The Secret Life of Marilyn Monroe best explains the complex life of the ultimate sex symbol. Author J. Randy Taraborrelli's biography reveals that Marilyn, whose grandmother and mother were both committed to mental asylums, lived with the fear of possible impending madness.\n\nI was also interested in details of Marilyn's relationship with the Kennedys—Bobby, Jack, and Pat Lawford Kennedy. These could have played a big part in her death.\n\nBy J. Randy Taraborrelli,\n\nWhy should I read it?\n\n1 author picked The Secret Life of Marilyn Monroe as one of their favorite books, and they share why you should read it.\n\nWhat is this book about?\n\nFrom New York Times bestselling author J. Randy Taraborrelli comes the definitive biography of the most enduring icon in popular American culture.\n\nWhen Marilyn Monroe became famous in the 1950s, the world was told that her mother was either dead or simply not a part of her life. However, that was not true. In fact, her mentally ill mother was very much present in Marilyn's world and the complex family dynamic that unfolded behind the scenes is a story that has never before been told...until now. In this groundbreaking book, Taraborrelli draws complex and sympathetic portraits of the women so…\n\nPreview\n\nWhy did Alan love this book?\n\nI have to start with this book, as reading Toni's work has influenced me and my approach to trading from the early days.

Published in the 1935, it’s a contemporaneous account of Depression-era America, following the misadventures of traveling salesman and religious zealot, George Brush.\n\nComing off as preachy and self-righteous, George sparks ire and outrage wherever he goes. Yet, he’s a sincere and decent person. At the end of his misadventures, George is humbled and begins to broaden his views, making him a complex, sympathetic character.\n\nThough renowned during his lifetime, Wilder has been largely forgotten in favor of flashier contemporaries. All of his works are worth rediscovering, but Heaven’s My Destination is closest to my heart as it was a major inspiration for my own book.\n\nBy Thornton Wilder,\n\nWhy should I read it?\n\n1 author picked Heaven's My Destination as one of their favorite books, and they share why you should read it.\n\nWhat is this book about?\n\nThe law of contract is ripe for feminist analysis. Despite increasing calls for the re-conceptualisation of neo-classical ways of thinking, feminist perspectives on contract tend to be marginalised in mainstream textbooks. This edited collection questions the assumptions made in such works and the ideologies that underpin them, drawing attention to the ways in which the law of contract has facilitated the virtual exclusion of women, the feminine and the private sphere from legal discourse.\n\nContributors to this volume offer a range of ways of thinking about the subject and cover topics such as the feminine offeree, feminist perspectives on contracts…\n\nPreview\n\nWhy did William love this book?\n\nThis volume collects the memories of people who were close to Jackie. Carl Anthony met Jackie, and better, he was in touch with Jackie’s friend Nancy Tuckerman, who helped him with addresses and telephone numbers. These are people who were willing to speak about Jackie following her premature death at the age of 65. Anthony is also an expert on presidential wives and families.\n\nBy Carl Sferrazza Anthony,\n\nWhy should I read it?\n\n1 author picked As We Remember Her as one of their favorite books, and they share why you should read it.\n\nWhat is this book about?\n\nirst Lady Hillary Clinton, Ted Kennedy, childhood friends and dozens of others share their fond recollections of Jackie in As We Remember Her. This is the first time many of these people have ever spoken publicly about her, and the portrait that emerges is quite revealing. Behind the image of one of the 20th-century's most recognizable icons was a surprisingly substantive person -- a woman whose intelligence and political savvy were as remarkable as her famous charm and beauty. Jackie plunged fresh out of college into the world of journalism with her own girl-on-the-street column for the Washington Times. As…\n\nPreview\n\nWhy did Steven love this book?\n\nFew people know more about the Kennedy family and are as fair-minded in telling their story as Leamer. (He also wrote a companion book on The Kennedy Women.)\n\nWhat I really like about Leamer’s work is that he does his homework. Not only are his books deeply researched, but he has also clearly earned the trust of family members who share personal stories not found in other published accounts.\n\nBy Laurence Leamer,\n\nWhy should I read it?\n\n1 author picked The Kennedy Men as one of their favorite books, and they share why you should read it.\n\nWhat is this book about?\n\nIn this triumphant new work already hailed as a powerful American epic, Laurence Leamer chronicles the Kennedy men and their struggle to create the most powerful family in the United States. The Kennedy Men is the first volume in a multi-generational history that will forever change the way America views its most famous family. Beginning in 1901 with twelve-year-old Joseph P. Kennedy Sr. delivering hats to Boston's social elite and ending in 1963 with the assassination of his son, President John F. Kennedy, Leamer seamlessly unites the complex strands of their economic, political, and social rise.\n\nThis magnificent new volume…\n\nPreview\n\nWhy did Patti love this book?\n\nOswald’s Tale is a book I’d like to read again. I was born the year after JFK was shot, but the tragedy hung over my family in such a way that each of my older siblings had a portrait of the dead president folded into their baby books.\n\nMailer depicts someone rootless and restless, hungry and in a hurry to make his mark. Oswald in Russia was the most disturbing to me. I spent nearly two decades in the former Soviet bloc and other so-called developing democracies. Time and again, I ran across aimless Americans who had set up camp abroad, just to be someplace “other.” In search of an identity. They were unsettled and uncomfortably eccentric. I could have run into any number of Oswalds during that long stretch of my life.\n\nBy Norman Mailer,\n\nWhy should I read it?\n\n2 authors picked Oswald's Tale as one of their favorite books, and they share why you should read it.\n\nWhat is this book about?\n\nThis work looks at the life of harvey Lee Oswald. In 1959 he defected to the Soviet Union and was sent to Minsk, where he was kept under constant KGB surveillance on the suspicion that he might be a CIA agent. In 1993 Norman Mailer spent six months in Minsk retracing Oswald's two and a half years in the USSR, interviewing Oswald's former friends and sweethearts. He obtained exclusive interviews with KGB officers and access to KGB surveillance reports. Mailer also provides an account of Oswald's disastrous childhood and of the events leading from his return to the US in…\n\nPreview"
