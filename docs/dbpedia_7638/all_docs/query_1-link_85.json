        "text": "A project that featured a starring cast of Naomi Watts, Diane Lane, Molly Ringwald, Chloe Sevigny, Demi Moore and Calista Flockhart sounds like it could only be made on the big budget of a feature film. In reality, it is just the latest casting magic producer Ryan Murphy (“American Horror Story”) has been able to pull off for his television productions.\n\nHis past works have featured Angela Bassett, Lady Gaga, Jessica Lange, Kathy Bates, Emma Roberts and Susan Sarandon. The current A-list of performers who have been brought together by Murphy are for the new series “Feud: Capote vs. the Swans.”\n\nThe eight-part series that is currently airing 10 p.m. Wednesdays on FX looks at the rise and dramatic fall of author Truman Capote as he surrounded himself with society’s most elite women of the ‘60s and ‘70s. Being part of that world was like a drug to Capote and as is so often the case with addicts, he took one too many hits that resulted in disaster.\n\nWatts plays Babe Paley, the wife of the head of CBS, Bob Paley. The couple made Capote a permanent guest at all of their events. That early connection died when the article Côte Basque about the Swans written by Capote appeared in Esquire magazine in 1975.\n\nIn some cases, Capote thinly veiled the identities and in other cases held nothing back. Either way, the women who once adored Capote became his biggest nightmare.\n\nWatts prepared for the role by reading Laurence Leamer’s book Capote’s Women: A True Story of Love, Betrayal, and a Swan Song for an Era. The book and the script were the major sources of her knowing how to play the role.\n\n“With Babe, there was no footage available that I could find, recordings or visuals. So, trying to create a voice and her physicality was something that I had to invent through a multitude of wonderful photographs,” Watts says. “Just how her hand was placed, perhaps, or how she held her cigarette. It was clear to me that there was never a hair out of place, never a wrong word spoken.\n\n“So much effort was put into her appearance and not just for her own vanity but how she designed a dinner table, who were the guests, what would the conversations be, what would the cutlery be, how it was placed. There was just so much time and thoughtfulness put into how each event would go.”\n\nCreating the way to play Babe through this route ended up being a joy for the Oscar-nominated performer. The English actress came to the short-run series have starred in projects from the films “Mullholland Drive” and “King Kong” to the TV series “Twin Peaks” and “Gypsy.”\n\nWatts found through playing the role that the reason Capote was able to ingratiate himself so fully with these women who were at the top of the social ladder was that he gave them attention they didn’t get from their husbands.\n\n“I think they were trapped in a wrong time, but that’s how society was operating. They were uncredited for the work and the amount of time they put into making their husbands’ businesses go well,” Watts says. “And the resentment builds when the philandering continues and it’s tolerated to a point.\n\n“Babe is someone who’s well-callused by this point. She knows another affair here, another one there.”\n\nOnce she shared her secrets with Capote, a bond was formed. Watts calls it the deepest romance Babe had had minus the sex. The lack of physical intimacy allowed her to go deeper emotionally with Capote.\n\nWatts not only stars in the production but serves as an executive producer. She jumped at the chance to work with Murphy again because her experience of starring in his film “The Watcher” had gone so well.\n\nThe only downside of “Feud: Capote vs. the Swans” was that it was filmed during COVID restrictions. Everyone had to wear masks and they had to eat alone. Even when having their hair and makeup done, the performers were six feet apart. That meant despite being surrounded by some of the top performers in Hollywood, the cast only had limited opportunities to hangout. “Often times when you’re working on a film or a show, especially if you’re on the road somewhere and you’ve left your home territory, it’s nice to have a meal at the end of the day or, you know, a drink or a hangout and there just wasn’t time for this because we were always concentrating on the next day’s work ahead,” Watts says. “When we came together at the Côte Basque, those in-between moments, though they were short, they were bonding, and I think we were all just super-grateful for this wonderful group of people.”"
