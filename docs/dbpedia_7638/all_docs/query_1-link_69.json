        "text": "PART ONE\n\nThe Vision\n\nCHAPTER ONE\n\nThe American Dream\n\nAs California Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger stood at the podium of the Republican National Convention in August 2004, scanning the vast assemblage, everything was fantastic. Arnold’s favorite word was fantastic. Of course, his wife, Maria Shriver, was fantastic, but so was working with his predecessor and archrival, former Governor Gray Davis, during the transition. Now that Arnold was in office, every Californian would have a fantastic job. When a judge ruled that he had violated campaign laws and would have to repay $4.5 million out of his own pocket, that was fantastic, too.\n\nArnold was washed in waves of applause that began directly in front of him in the Ohio delegation. They knew him as the greatest bodybuilding champion in history, who had come to Columbus each spring since his retirement to put on a bodybuilding and sports competition. Behind the Midwesterners stood his own California delegation, many wearing T-shirts reading I’M WITH ARNOLD. Beyond them were other delegations that considered him the most exciting new political figure in their party. And back up in the upper reaches of Madison Square Garden were many to whom he was primarily a movie star celebrated almost everywhere.\n\nArnold looked out beatifically on the huge hall. This was his first public test as a national political figure and the most important speech of his life. He had been given a key slot, Tuesday evening at ten o’clock, the first speaker on prime-time network television. He had been governor of California for nine and a half months, elected in a controversial recall election. As far as he was concerned, he had done a fantastic job. He was wildly popular and had made Californians feel good about their state once again. It was all about competition, and standing there was like moving up from the California title to the national championship or the Olympics. He was shining. Everyone was looking at him. Everyone was wondering, could he hack it? Could he make it on this great stage?\n\nArnold’s enormous head on the great television screens in the Garden looked like a giant icon. His head was so large that it was a visual signature that could be seen from afar. His hair, already turning gray a quarter-century ago, was dyed the most peculiar shade of brown. The six-foot, two-inch-tall politician had orange-brown skin, a color that was also a shade unknown to nature. He had a tucked face that was the work of either a master plastic surgeon or a generous God who had decided to bestow eternal youth on one mortal. However bizarre these elements might have seemed individually, they came together in an immensely powerful image.\n\nFifty-seven-year-old Arnold Schwarzenegger was a man of the most extraordinary public discipline. The look of youthful exuberance and energy was, in part, an act of pure will. He had a slow, purposeful walk. He almost never hurried. He held his stomach in tight to promote the lean look of youth. His discipline set him apart—surely from most men his own age, many of whom were already counting the days to retirement.\n\nArnold’s first starring role in Hollywood had been in 1982 as Conan the Barbarian. In his action/adventure films, Arnold had slain his enemies by the hundreds. To his audiences who had seen him as the world’s greatest action star, he seemed immortal, impervious to pain, attack, flame, bullet, or natural disaster. His most famous character, the Terminator, was a robot, but Arnold projected himself onto the world like a Terminator with a heart, a suprahuman, constantly reinventing himself, regrowing his aging parts so he seemed eternally young.\n\nArnold waved to Maria and their four children, all impeccably dressed for their father’s great moment. They were seated next to former President George Herbert Walker Bush, a man Arnold admired as much as any living figure in American politics, and the governor waved to him, too.\n\nMaria was here this evening to honor her husband, but she was a Kennedy/Shriver, member of a family with two great faiths, the Catholic Church and the Democratic Party, and she would not give up either. The Republicans were no more comfortable with her than she with them, and not once this evening was her image shown on the in-house television screens. Maria had shoved a microphone in Senator John McCain’s face after his defeat in the Super Tuesday primaries four years earlier and asked him, How do you feel? Many among the delegates remembered that the Arizona politician had snarled at her to get out of the way, and she was escorted out, actions that were applauded by some of the Republican faithful.\n\nArnold knew there were those out there among the 2,509 delegates, the thousands of others in attendance, and the 30 million watching on television who expected him to falter, to expose himself as a celebrity playing in a league where he did not belong and in a game he barely understood. Arnold took that as just another challenge. He became the greatest bodybuilder of the modern era by the most meticulous preparation, including working out more each day than any of his opponents. He became the biggest movie star in the world by the same kind of concern over every last detail of his films, from the script to the marketing to the publicity. He entered politics the same way, scoping it out over a number of years, planning his attack, and when opportunity opened up, going for it.\n\nTo prepare for this evening, Arnold probably devoted more hours than any of the other politicians who spoke at the convention. For weeks he had spent hours with his speechwriter and staff, tinkering with phrases, debating concepts. Longtime Reagan speechwriter Landon Parvin had been brought in to write the speech, but Maria was dissatisfied with the original draft, and the speech went through many revisions. Parvin wanted to begin the address with a joke about Maria’s uncle, Senator Edward Kennedy. People ask me if I still lift weights, Arnold was to say. Absolutely. Just the other day, I lifted two hundred and eighty-five pounds. I lifted Ted Kennedy out of his chair. The joke would have brought the house down, but Maria would not allow her uncle to be mocked.\n\nThe week before the convention, in Sacramento and Los Angeles, Arnold practiced the speech again and again, working over the nuances of his delivery. Monday night he arrived at the convention in downtown Manhattan at midnight with his entourage and walked into the eerily empty Garden. In the belly of the arena, where a stray journalist could not possibly find him, he worked with the technician handling the TelePrompTer and ran through the address once again. Then he walked into the arena itself and up to the podium and stood there. He saw in his mind’s eye what it would be like as the crowd exploded with cheers.\n\nAs he stood there, warmed by the ovation, it was just as he imagined it would be. He was bathed in adulation. There were even hundreds of blue signs emblazoned with the name ARNOLD. Wherever he looked out upon the immense gathering, he saw his name. As his eyes fell for an instant on the glass TelePrompTer, he was startled. The blue background from the hundreds of signs showed through the screen, and he could not see the words. He knew his speech, but he had not memorized it. He did not panic or turn in a frantic gesture to an aide. He was in the moment. He would find a way.\n\nThank you, thank you, he said. He had a consummate awareness of his image, and he turned slowly so that everyone would see his profile, capturing him in their minds. Thank you… What a greeting!\n\nThis is like winning an Oscar! Arnold said as the applause died down. As if I would know! Arnold believed that modest was the appellation that the mediocre gave themselves to hide their mediocrity. This moment of self-deprecation was totally calculated. As he saw it, if he could get a laugh from making fun of himself, he would achieve instant commonality with the audience, winning a kind of capital he could use later on in his speech.\n\nMy fellow Americans, this is an amazing moment for me, he said, turning serious. To think that a once scrawny boy from Austria could grow up to become governor of California and stand in Madison Square Garden to speak on behalf of the President of the United States—that is an immigrant’s dream. It is the American dream.\n\nThere in three sentences was the essence of his life, the essentials of his message, and the foundation of his political faith. He conveyed these sentiments with an elevated sense of joy and optimism that affected almost everyone around him, and he had those emotions at a time in modern politics when almost no one else did. That, too, he was conveying to this audience.\n\nThree days before, up to half a million Americans had marched in opposition to the war in Iraq outside this arena, many of them believing that the best and only way to be heard was to shout in the streets. The President, who had authorized this war, was accused by his foes of being a slacker who had used his father’s influence to avoid risking his life in Vietnam. His Democratic opponent was charged by political enemies with exaggerating his heroic record in that tragic conflict. It was a dispiriting time in which Democrats and Republicans tore mercilessly at each other, and many Americans seemed ready to believe the worst of the motives of those who sought to lead them.\n\nI was born in Europe, and I’ve traveled all over the world, Arnold said. I can tell you that there is no place, no country, more compassionate, more generous, more accepting, and more welcoming than the United States of America. Since the terrorist attacks of 9/11, these public professions of patriotism had become a standard ritual of politics, but few of these assertions had the authenticity of Arnold’s.\n\nArnold was a true witness to the greatness of America and what freedom could mean, and he held this convention the way no one else had yet. The delegates put down their blue Arnold placards, and Arnold could see the TelePrompTer, and he was fully in the moment. He had played many roles, but the character he played best was his own creation: the giant, mythic Arnold Schwarzenegger who stood onstage that evening. He focused relentlessly on whatever he was doing. He was giving the speech of his life, imbuing it with every ounce of his controlled emotional power.\n\nHe told the audience what it had been like growing up in Austria, when he had seen Soviet tanks in the streets and experienced firsthand the repression of liberty in a socialist country. Arnold was a loving son of Austria and had kept dual citizenship. This exaggerated picture pleased his audience in America as much as it displeased those in his birthplace.\n\nWhen Arnold was working on the speech, some of Bush’s people recommended that he not say that when he came to the United States in 1968, he had heard Richard Nixon campaigning for President and found him a breath of fresh air. Since his disgraced resignation in 1974, President Nixon’s name was one that Republicans rarely invoked. Arnold did not care. He said to himself, The hell with that. I’m not embarrassed by anything that has had an effect on me, and therefore I will not stay away from that. That was the truth of his life, and he was going to speak it, and so he did. There were many in the audience who still revered Nixon. They left the hall that evening remembering the one man who spoke the former President’s name when no one else would. One of those was Nixon’s daughter Julie Nixon Eisenhower, who said that she was moved to tears by Arnold’s immigrant story and by the fact that thirty years later my father’s legacy—and the impact he had on our party—still resonates.\n\nIn twenty-three minutes, Arnold had to do many things—among them, prove his fidelity to President George W. Bush. Time and again he invoked the President’s name and proved to any who doubted it that he was a stalwart supporter. Arnold also sought to bring the disparate elements of the party together. He was a Republican governor in a state largely controlled by Democrats, and he was here trying to find the middle ground. He had to do that without rubbing it in their faces, putting it in their eyes, and at the same time helping the President. In California, he had won the support of right-wing members of his party who would have deplored almost any other Republican candidate who held liberal views on social issues—pro-choice, pro–environmental movement, pro–gay rights. We can respectfully disagree and still be patriotic and still be American and still be good Republicans, he told the delegates. He sought to reach beyond his own party to independents and Democrats and to move them with the passion of his ideas.\n\nArnold has an impish quality that no amount of power, no seriousness of position or theme, can change. In July, when he was fighting to pass a budget through California’s Democrat-controlled legislature, he called members of the opposition party girlie men. Some accused Arnold of resorting to blatant homophobia, but he meant the phrase as a gibe at what he considered weak-willed politicians who would not come to meaningful compromise.\n\nHe wanted to use the phrase again at the convention, but when Bush’s handlers vetted the speech, they sought to veto its inclusion. They were incapable of appreciating the irony that they were embodying the very definition of girlie men. Arnold held tough and let it be known that even if the phrase was not in the formal speech, he might just decide to say it extemporaneously.\n\nTo those critics who are so pessimistic about our economy, I say: ‘Don’t be economic girlie men!’ he said, receiving the biggest ovation of the entire speech. He knew it would be a great applause line, but he also wanted to signal that he was not apologetic about it at all.\n\nArnold insisted that there be humor even in the most serious of moments, not because he was a frivolous man but because he saw that humor was one of the engines of the human spirit. Nothing—not a toast, not a speech, not even a funeral or a memorial service—should be untouched by it. But the purpose of this speech was a serious one: to invoke his own life as a witness to the greatness of his adopted country, to reach for the deepest truths of his own life to inspire his nation and to advance himself as a major national political figure.\n\nMy fellow Americans, Arnold said at the end of his speech, I want you to know that I believe with all my heart that America remains ‘the great idea’ that inspires the world. It’s a privilege to be born here. It’s an honor to become a citizen here. It’s a gift to raise your family here, to vote here, and to live here.\n\nThe cheers and applause rose to an ovation, but Arnold did not linger. He walked offstage as purposefully and as deliberately as he had entered onto it. He knew that he had done precisely what he wanted to do. He could never say so publicly, but he believed that there was a vacuum of leadership in his adopted country. There had been a vacuum in California, and he believed that he had more than filled it. As he looked on the horizon, he saw no one with the strength, confidence, energy, and belief to lead America in the twenty-first century. All that held him back from actively aspiring to the highest office in the land was the constitutional prohibition of foreign-born citizens becoming President.\n\nHe believed he had been chosen for a special role in the world. He wanted more than anything to leave that stage with people thinking that maybe he was the one. Though he was an immigrant and was not born here, maybe he was the visionary. Maybe the American people would change the Constitution so that he could lead them.\n\nPART TWO\n\nThe Bodybuilder\n\nCHAPTER TWO\n\nA Man from Thal\n\nOn summer weekends, families from Graz often journeyed over the wooded hill from the Austrian city to a diminutive lake in the village of Thal. There they swam in the Thalersee, rented wooden rowboats, or ate ample meals of pork loin and fried potatoes in the restaurant by the side of the lake. In the summer of 1963, as the visitors took their half-hour constitutional around the lake or sat in the outdoor café with their coffee and strudel, near the boathouse a group of young men in swim trunks lifted weights and exercised, performing a theater of physicality. They hung from the tree branches and did vigorous series of chin-ups. They held one another’s feet for repetitions of sit-ups. The young men were bodybuilders, practicing an obscure sport for which there was not even a word in German.\n\nEyes inevitably focused on one of the youths. He was an inch or two over six feet tall. He had short-cropped brown hair; thick, lengthy eyebrows; deep, expressive eyes; a separation between his front teeth; and sensuous lips that often seemed poised between a laugh and a sneer. If the sixteen-year-old looked much like any other teenager from the village, he had other qualities that made him an imposing presence beyond his age and station. He was developing the most muscular body of them all and had an awesome exuberance. His enthusiasm was a benediction that he spread on all within hearing—his fellow bodybuilders, the weekend strollers, everyone from the giggling young women to the serious walkers with their carved walking sticks and lederhosen.\n\nThe young man’s name was Arnold Schwarzenegger. His father, Gustav, was the police chief in Thal, a modest position overseeing two deputies. Arnold’s mother, Aurelia, was a housewife. He lived with his mother and father and his elder brother, Meinhard, in the upstairs of a home owned by a local nobleman. The centuries-old house was in disrepair and had no indoor plumbing, a lack it shared with most residences in Thal.\n\nWhere I started was a little farm community outside the Austrian town of Graz, Arnold reflected. Now, that may make you think of sunny hillsides with buttercups dancing in the breeze, and happy children with rosy cheeks, eating strudel. But that’s not what I think of. First of all, strudel was a luxury. It was right after World War II, and the country was absolutely devastated and destroyed. We had no flushing toilet in the house. No refrigerator. No television. What we did have was food rations—and British tanks around to give us kids an occasional lift to the elementary school.\n\nIn the four-room Hans Gross Volksschule, the children wore patches on their hand-me-down clothes and passed their books down from class to class. Arnold learned how to get along with the little money he had, recalled Peter Urdl, one of his classmates, now mayor of Thal. But nobody at the time had all that much money. In the beginning, his mother had her hands full just to keep him fed.\n\nArnold was thrice a provincial. He was a citizen of an Austria that before defeat in World War I had been the center of the Austro-Hungarian Empire, overseeing the destinies of 67 million Europeans. In the late 1930s, many Austrians had hoped to restore their nation’s greatness in an alliance with Nazi Germany, but the Austrian-born Adolf Hitler led them into a disaster unprecedented in their history. The Austria that Arnold was born into on July 30, 1947, was a despairing, defeated country occupied by the Americans, British, and Russians. The crews on the tanks that rolled through the countryside spoke English, for the region was part of the British zone of occupation.\n\nArnold was also a provincial in that he was born in Styria. The southeastern region of Austria had been the watchtower against the invasion of the Turks of the Ottoman Empire. When the Muslims retreated, Styria lost its historic importance. As early as the end of the eighteenth century, Graz was already becoming a backwater, a place where, one writer noted, most of the people… [lost] the desire to pick up their walking staff and continue wandering. Even so, Graz remains the second-largest city in Austria, with a population of 250,000.\n\nThe Alps helped wall off the region in geographic and cultural isolation. Other Austrians caricatured the Styrians as the wild people beyond the Semmering. Other German speakers sometimes find the Styrian dialect unintelligible and vulgar, like a hillbilly accent. The critical listener does not hear the words themselves, but the accent marks its speaker as uneducated and backward.\n\nArnold was also from a village hidden beyond a large hill that isolated Thal from Graz itself. Even now the community remains largely unchanged from the years when Arnold lived there, revealing a soothing commonness of form and purpose. For the most part, the homes are set well apart from one another across the slope of the hill, the orange-tinged tile roofs making the houses look like a series of stepping-stones across a landscape of pasture, farm, and forest. There is nothing of the bold reds of a Vermont barn. It is all subtle shades, pastels blending in with the verdant greens of the grass and forestland.\n\nThal was a bucolic, pastoral setting for a boy’s life, everything within reach and comprehensible, the lake half a mile from Arnold’s home, the school in the same building that housed his father’s police station, his friends’ homes visible from most places in Thal. From Arnold’s upstairs bedroom window, he looked out on what could have been a stage setting for a Wagnerian opera, a few cows grazing in the pasture, wooded landscape mysterious in the morning haze, and to one side of the tableau the spire of a ruined castle where Arnold played hide-and-seek as a boy.\n\nIf the small Catholic church in the upper reaches of the village is Thal’s symbol of faith, then the Café-Restaurant Thalersee is its symbol of sociability. When the outsiders had gone back to Graz, the restaurant became a gathering place for the locals. Even on an August Sunday afternoon with the tables full of weekenders, Austrian custom reserved one table in the establishment, the Stammtisch, for the owner’s chosen guests. It might be a regular group of men, local officials, or relatives, but one sat at that table only by special invitation.\n\nAlmost no one came into the Café-Restaurant Thalersee for a hurried meal. At some of the tables, the words were witty, the conversation animated, but even if it was not, the pleasure was simply in being there. Arnold’s mother worked in the kitchen sometimes, but there were not the social distinctions of an urban, more stratified society. Almost everyone in the village was welcome at the restaurant, from the one family of nobility who had an estate to the village drunk. It had been that way long before Arnold was born, and it would be that way decades after he no longer lived there.\n\nThere is a strong centrifugal pull to Thal. People do not want to leave to venture forth in the unknown world beyond. Generation after generation, they stay there. When a home is for sale, it is much preferred to sell to a relative or close friend of someone in the village itself. It is a homogeneous place; the villagers look as if they are from one large family. They are hospitable to those they think might be one of them, but uncomfortable and nervous with those they deem outsiders. They are deeply conservative, finding comfort in a present that is full of the past.\n\nGustav was a large man who dominated his family in a way that he could not dominate the world beyond. Arnold’s obsession with physical size and strength surely comes in part from his father, whose sheer mass suggested that heft and muscle translated into power and potency in the world and control over those on whom he passed his gaze. Arnold fondly remembers how, as a little boy, he dressed up in Gustav’s police uniform. I was a little kid standing on a chair, and the jacket was hanging down, like a raincoat, all the way to my toes, Arnold recalled. I had this hat on which covered me all the way to my nose. I always played dress-up with his uniform.\n\nWhen Gustav walked upstairs into the Schwarzenegger home, wearing his police outfit, he insisted on discipline and order in the most minute details of family life. He sought perfection in his sons, and perfection was a goal that was forever receding. He pushed his sons to develop an interest in classical music and took them to museums on Sundays. This was all an endless chore to Arnold. He preferred to go to movies, especially the features his father told him not to see. Arnold snuck in to see films that children were not permitted to attend by walking in backward when theatergoers were leaving.\n\nIt was bad enough having to go with his parents to a concert or a museum, but even worse was that afterward his father made him write a ten-page report on what he had just seen. He would correct it all over the place, recalled Arnold. ‘This sentence makes no sense.’ ‘Write this word fifty times.’ ‘You made a mistake.’\n\nIf his sons did not polish his shoes and burnish his brass belt until they gleamed, Gustav ordered them to do the job over again and punished them for their inadequacy. Arnold had to be home at a certain time, his pace homeward quickened by the prospect of a cuff to the ear if he was even a minute late. Gustav took immense satisfaction in meting out what he considered just punishment. Other parents were strict, too, but most Thal youths did not have the curfew that Gustav imposed on his sons, nor the myriad duties and obligations.\n\nIt was not just at home that Arnold feared the sting of reprimand. He recalled vividly the Parents Day when one father walked into the schoolroom, slapped his son without even a word, and walked out again. In school, some of the teachers taught with sticks in their hands, ever ready to use them on an unruly pupil. The students’ worst fear was of a female math teacher who delighted in coming up from behind and whacking them on the head. Arnold was a feisty, irrepressible boy, and he received more than his share of raps on his large head.\n\nMy hair was pulled, Arnold recalled of his home life. I was hit with belts. So was the kid next door. It was just the way it was. Many of the children I’ve seen were broken by their parents, which was the German-Austrian mentality. Break the will. They didn’t want to create an individual.\n\nI have seen one kid almost get his ear ripped off right in front of me because he was fighting with someone else, Arnold said. I think it was a very much more brutal time. Although Arnold is surely correct that the corporal punishment he received would now be called abuse, his solace is that everyone was getting walloped, too, and that his was just a typical German-Austrian childhood.\n\nThere is no way to calibrate whether Gustav’s beatings were worse than those handed out by other fathers, but what is probably true is that young Arnold suffered more than many of his peers. He might have seemed at times an oafish lad, but he was preternaturally sensitive to everything around him. The best evidence of that is not in his contemporaries, who saw nothing of it, but in the man he became, a man with extraordinary insight into the motivation and character of other people. That is one of the qualities that has helped him advance in the world, and it is a quality that began in his difficult childhood years.\n\nI rebelled against my father, Arnold said. When he said white, I said black. When he wanted my hair short, I wanted it long. It was not just his father that the youth was rebelling against, but the subjugation of the spirit and physical brutality that masks private pain.\n\nIt was the boy who felt the pain and it is the man who found the understanding many years later. I think being a disciplinarian, being a military guy, made my father more intense in some ways, more into the discipline thing, said Arnold. But with the punishments, the next day he would shower you with gifts. He was a very generous guy. He was always handing out money, a schilling here and a schilling there, or going into town and buying something or doing wonderful things for our mother on Mother’s Day or for Christmas. But he still had that side of being a soldier in the Second World War, with all the wounds, with the shrapnel still in his legs and body. He was in tremendous pain a lot of times. He drank because of that. There was all of that, which, of course, as a kid, I wasn’t much aware of, only later on. And so I know that the key thing always is that you know that your father was a good human being.\n\nThere was one matter that was not discussed in the Schwarzenegger house, and that was Gustav’s membership in the Nazi Party. Millions of Austrians in the thirties believed that Hitler would bring order and discipline to the world, but only a minority of them joined the Nazi Party, as Gustav did in 1938, four months after the annexation of Austria. As a police officer, he surely found it advantageous to carry a party card. Moreover, he was precisely the kind of conservative, insular, proud Austrian to whom Hitler appealed.\n\nOne indication that Gustav’s beliefs in Nazism went deeper is that in May 1939 he volunteered for the Sturmabteilungen (storm troopers), and served as a master sergeant in a military police unit on both the eastern and western fronts. The Feldgendarmerie were nicknamed the Chained Dogs, a vivid rendering of their reputation in subduing occupied peoples. Gustav left the military in 1943 after being wounded. After the war, there were tens of thousands of former soldiers like Gustav who may have witnessed war crimes or participated in atrocities. The Allies had neither the time nor the political will to investigate each one of these hollow-eyed veterans. Almost all of them returned to civilian society, where they almost never talked about what they had seen and done. In 1947 Gustav was cleared sufficiently to return to police work.\n\nIn civilian clothes, Gustav was a nondescript middle-aged man with a receding hairline and an unprepossessing manner, but in uniform he was transformed. His other uniform of choice was that of the Graz Gendarmerie Musik, the police brass band in which he played the trumpet, sometimes leading the uniformed group through the streets of the provincial capital.\n\nIn Thal a celebratory dinner at the Café-Restaurant Thalersee, a wedding feast or holiday dinner, was a lengthy, convivial affair in which Welschriesling and schnapps flowed as freely as the conversation. It was hardly a matter for social ostracism to imbibe until flush-faced, but Gustav’s drinking was of a different sort. He was an angry drunk, and there were rumors in the village that when he wended his way home in the evening hours, he beat his wife. Despite these tales, Arnold has no memories of his father hitting his mother.\n\nOne of Arnold’s schoolmates recalled the time he discovered Gustav passed out. The boy removed the police chief’s pistol and fired it into the air, which did not wake Gustav. The villagers of Thal might gossip mercilessly among themselves but not to outsiders, and they protected a man who was a danger to himself, to his family, and to the community as a whole since he was police chief. He was eventually transferred from the village, though he never had the epaulets of authority cut off, his name disgraced.\n\nArnold’s elder brother, Meinhard, was enthroned in his father’s mind as his favorite son. Meinhard was a year older than Arnold and not only larger through their childhood but robustly healthy, whereas Arnold was often sick. He was handsome in a way that Arnold was not, with a winsome charm that he could turn on and off on cue. Gustav’s championing of his elder son was the worst of gifts to Meinhard, endowing him with an arrogant lassitude and the belief that he could pluck whatever he wanted from life without even a down payment in effort. He was the school bully, tormenting those weaker and smaller. His merciless teasing began at home, where Arnold had to learn to stand up to not only his father’s pedagogical cuffing but his brother’s cruel words. Outside the house, Meinhard faced a world that would not tolerate his abuse as his younger brother did, and he graduated from surly intimidation of his peers to full-fledged delinquency and tenure in a reformatory.\n\nThe emotional neglect Arnold received from his father, the brutal hazing from his brother, and the secret shame of Gustav’s drunken binges could have emotionally crippled many youths. Instead, Arnold developed an ability to turn his head from what was negative and hurtful and always to look beyond. To compensate for what he lacked as a child, Arnold also developed an insatiable hunger for the love, applause, and affirmation he could never receive from his father.\n\nHis childhood friends do not remember Arnold as anything but a normal boy, full of humor and pranks. He was a rascal, surely, but that’s very normal, recalled classmate Franz Hörmann. He played a few great pranks. He was part of every prank. Like his friends, Arnold was a mediocre student who gauged his success more by avoiding his teachers’ censure than by academic achievement.\n\nFor all Thal’s exquisite beauty, there was nothing that led away from the village, no legendary figure of accomplishment who had once lived there, no teacher who filled the spirit with a vision of a grander life, no inspiring neighbor who had reached beyond the narrow confines. On the far side of the village stood a castle owned by a family of German nobility who visited occasionally, but they were a species far beyond the aspirations of the people of Thal.\n\nArnold’s emotional salvation lay largely in his relationship with his mother. Arnold was a mama’s boy, said Sepp Heinzle, another classmate. Aurelia had been a childless widow with a serious, gentle demeanor, slightly protruding teeth, and a stolid frame when she met Gustav after the war. Twenty-three-year-old Aurelia married her forty-two-year-old suitor in October 1945. The bachelor Gustav already had four decades to become a narrow martinet, and Aurelia assumed the most traditional of wifely roles, obedient to her older husband’s wishes, deferential to his suggestions.\n\nIf ever once Aurelia complained about her lot or sat befuddled at her condition, there is no one who recalls it. Almost everyone who knew Arnold’s mother says that she was simple. They do not mean that she was simpleminded but rather a woman of a few compelling concerns—her husband and her children—who built her life around them. She was not an educated woman, but she had a natural dignity. When she worked in the kitchen at the Café-Restaurant Thalersee to earn some extra schillings, she was Frau Schwarzenegger, as she always would be.\n\nArnold could have gone the route of his father and brother, an oppressive bullying presence, but it was his mother who taught him empathy and tenderness. When one family of outsiders moved to the village, their daughter, Herta Kling-Schmidbauer, felt ostracized by many of her new classmates. Arnold befriended her, staying close to the woman for decades to come. Arnold tried to be a dutiful son but wanted only to get away from his mother and father and what he considered the claustrophobic world of Thal. It was not until his father’s death in 1972 that he truly began to value his mother. He talks about her now with an emotional intensity that he brings to only a few things in his"
