The game on Sunday, Feb. 11, marks an exciting first for Las Vegas, which has never hosted the Super Bowl and, in fact, was historically shunned by professional sports teams and the NFL because of its \"seedy\" reputation.

Among the swells, Frank Sinatra and Mia Farrow, Andy Warhol, Norman Mailer, Henry Fonda and 19-year-old Candice Bergen. The Black and White Ball is featured in the new FX series, \"Feud: Capote vs. The Swans.\" Mo Rocca takes us back to what was described as \"the party of the century,\" with actor Candice Bergen, Laurence Leamer, author of the book \"Capote's Women\"—upon which the TV series is based, and Tom Hollander, who portrays Capote and Jon Robin Baitz, who wrote the script.\n\nFor more info:\n\nCandice Bergen Art Stuff\n\nLaurence Leamer\n\nTom Hollander\n\nJon Robin Baitz\n\n\"Capote vs. The Swans\" is now streaming on Hulu\n\nMUSIC: Usher talks Super Bowl halftime show, new album and what's coming next | Watch Video\n\nAn eight-time Grammy Award winner, Usher has sold millions of records all over the world since the start of his decades-long career — one that many credit for creating the romantic soundtrack of a generation.

Congress is divided on issues around border security, and attempts to reach a deal on immigration has instead resulted in prolonged negotiations between a bipartisan group of senators and the White House. Former Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson was responsible for U.S. borders in 2013 — the last time bipartisan immigration reform legislation came close to passing, but ultimately failed.
