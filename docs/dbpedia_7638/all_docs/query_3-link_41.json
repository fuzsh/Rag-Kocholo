        "text": "Today, any number of troubling government pathologies—a lawless presidency, a bloated and unaccountable administrative state, the growth of an activist bench—are associated with the emergence of a judicial philosophy that disregards the “plain meaning” of the Constitution for a loose, unprincipled “living constitutionalism.” Many trace its origins to the Progressive Era\n\n(1890–1920), a time when Americans turned en masse to government as the solution to emerging problems of economic modernity—financial panics, industrial concentration, worsening workplace conditions, and skyrocketing unemployment and inequality—and, the argument goes, concocted a flexible, new constitutional philosophy to allow the federal government to take on vast, new regulatory powers.\n\nAs this Article argues, this account is misleading. The Progressive Era did witness an outpouring of criticism towards the century-old Constitution, which many viewed as outdated, exclusionary, and countermajoritarian. Yet the idea of interpreting the text to make it evolve to fit “the spirit of the age,” as Woodrow Wilson called for, was anathema to millions of progressive Democrats who turned to the formal channels of Article V to update the Constitution. Far from a progressive innovation, reformers saw flexible constitutional construction as the tool of conservative interests and courts dangerously “usurping” the legislative power by reading into the law—especially the Fourteenth Amendment—unwritten principles of contract and property belonging to a bygone era. Instead, a vigorous reaction against the “unwritten constitution” of the Lochner era led to a burst of democratic mobilization around the idea of using the amendment power to make the People, not courts, the ultimate constitutional authority. Besides the four amendments that were ratified during the Progressive Era, over 1,700 amendment proposals were floated in Congress, many of them targeting countermajoritarian features of American democracy like the indirect election of Senators, the Electoral College, and lifetime judicial tenure. Some even proposed to override Supreme Court decisions by popular vote and to amend Article V itself.\n\nAfter a string of successes, this formalist strand of progressive constitutionalism faded in the early decades of the twentieth century, a victim of postwar pessimism and fatigue, and most importantly, fissures between Progressives who continued to fight for formal revision and those who, just decades after Lochnerism faded from the bench, turned their energies to developing a different slate of unwritten constitutional rights deemed “essential to the concept of ordered liberty.” Today, distant though we are from the progressive formalists’ hopes to channel ambitious political reform through routine, democratic, and formal constitutional change, revisiting this Era serves several purposes. First, it puts into context the text’s relative immobility in the last hundred years. Second, it illuminates the fact that many of our current constitutional dilemmas are the result of a living constitutionalism practiced by interpreters on the left and right alike. Finally, it may also help us envision what a return to truly democratic constitutional politics would look like.\n\n[N]o society can make a perpetual constitution, or even a perpetual law. . . . The constitution and the laws of their predecessors [are] extinguished . . . in their natural course, with those who gave them being. . . . Every constitution then, & every law, naturally expires at the end of 19 years. If it be enforced longer, it is an act of force, & not of right.\n\n—Letter from Thomas Jefferson toJames Madison (Sept. 6, 1789)\n\nIf, in the opinion of the people the distribution or modification of the constitutional powers be in any particular wrong, let it be corrected by an amendment in the way which the Constitution designates. But let there be no change by usurpation; for . . . it is the customary weapon by which free governments are destroyed.\n\n—George Washington, Farewell Address (Sept. 19, 1796)\n\nIf we want things to stay as they are, things will have to change.\n\n—Giuseppe di Lampedusa, The Leopard (Guido Waldman trans., 2007) (1966)\n\nIntroduction: An Unamendable Text?\n\nOn January 3, 1916, a fifty-nine-year-old Louis Brandeis stood before the Chicago Bar Association. The purpose of his address: to explain how the law could survive in swiftly changing times. Attacks on the rule of law, Brandeis pointed out, often coincided with periods of rapid societal transformation: In war-torn ancient Athens, the poet Euripides complained of “trammelings of law which are not of the right.” During the Reformation, German jurist Ulrich Zasius declared, “All sciences have put off their dirty clothes, only jurisprudence remains in its rags.” Goethe’s Faust, written after the French Revolution, described law satirically as an “heirloom dread” that spread “from race to race,” resistant to evolution and living well past its time.\n\nBrandeis demanded of the attorneys seated before him:\n\nIs not Goethe’s diagnosis applicable to the twentieth century challenge of the law in the United States? Has not the recent dissatisfaction with our law as administered been due, in large measure, to the fact that it had not kept pace with the rapid development of our political, economic and social ideals? In other words, is not the challenge of legal justice due to its failure to conform to contemporary conceptions of social justice?\n\nA century later, Brandeis’s questions sound surprisingly fresh, as a new generation experiences its own “collective revulsion against the privileges of great wealth allied with great power.” Today’s pressing political concerns bear more than a passing resemblance to those of that era. Stories of price-gouging in the pharmaceutical industry find an ancestor in Ida Tarbell’s muckraking exposé of the “ruthless methods” of Standard Oil in 1902. Senator Elizabeth Warren’s admonitions about the need for consumer protection against banks and loan servicers echo the stormy Senate floor speeches of Wisconsin’s “Fighting Bob” La Follette, calling for regulation and oversight of the railroads in 1906. Present-day concern over the consolidation and political strength of “Big Tech” parallels the great debate on the “trusts” staged by Theodore Roosevelt and Woodrow Wilson on the 1912 campaign trail.\n\nJust as in Brandeis’s time, economic discontent has stretched the boundaries of the political imagination. For the first time in decades, American democracy itself is under sustained critique; the idea gaining currency is that the problem is not a few “bad political ‘apples’” but a “bad political orchard.” Scholars diagnose a pronounced democratic “malaise” as politicians on the left and the right hammer home the point that the system is “rigged.” Institutional tinkering is creeping back onto the radar, with popular and scholarly proposals targeting American government’s purportedly more undemocratic features: the Electoral College, judicial lifetime tenure, Washington, D.C. and Puerto Rico’s lack of representation in Congress, and the unholy alliance of money and politics spawned by the Court’s 2010 Citizens United v. FEC decision.\n\nHistory imitates itself, but it does not repeat. Compared to Brandeis’s Progressive Era, today’s calls for reform and proposals are appreciably limited in scope. After all, even the swell of popular anger that carried Donald Trump and his pledge to “Drain the swamp!” to the White House in 2016 effectively conceded that, with a new cast of characters, the problems would self-correct. Almost a century-and-a-half ago, popular discontent spurred calls to radically reimagine the whole of American government, even the Constitution itself. The massively popular An Economic Interpretation of the Constitution, penned by economic historian Charles Beard in 1913, depicted the Constitution as inherently anti-democratic, its scheme of checks and balances an elaborate machinery set up by wealthy aristocrats of the Founding generation to shield property from popular majorities’ grasp. Progressives saw Beard’s critique, and others like it, not as anti-American or exceptionally radical, but as harkening back to an older, verifiably American tradition of Jeffersonian and Hamiltonian thought—Hamiltonian in calling for a strong, unified government; Jeffersonian in the hope of freeing Americans from “Constitution worship” so that they could exercise mastery over the higher law. Progressives agreed that some departure from the text of 1787 was necessary; the question was, a departure of what kind?\n\nWhile historians have established the diversity of progressive thought on philosophy, politics, and the social sciences, progressive legal thought has not been paid the same courtesy. Most often it is associated with the views of Supreme Court Justice and early Progressive hero Oliver Wendell Holmes, who scoffed at the idea that the Constitution’s provisions were “mathematical formulas” whose meaning could be “gathered . . . simply by taking the words and a dictionary.” Like all other “organic living institutions,” Holmes wrote in 1914, the Constitution’s meaning evolved in time. Many legal scholars still accept this view of the period’s main historical legacy: a “revolt against formalism” that replaced a nineteenth-century jurisprudence of eternal values, inalienable rights, and deducible “right” answers with a shadowy landscape of moral relativism, textual indeterminacy, evolving and balanceable rights, and a new sociological jurisprudence where pragmatically minded judges applied the tools of social science to “make policy” in a very literal sense. This account is the dominant view of Progressive Era legal theory, which it treats as the predecessor of the twentieth-century schools of legal realism, legal process theory, critical legal studies, popular constitutionalism, and the theory of the living constitution. What unifies these schools of thought is the realist’s insight that the act of judging involves an unavoidable amount of subjectivity and discretion.\n\nThe realist account of the Progressive “revolt against formalism” has been the source of many important scholarly contributions, but it also suffers from several limitations. First and most obviously, it is a strikingly poor framework for explaining one of the single most productive periods of constitutional amendment in American history. Had Progressives actually embraced the idea of channeling reform through an activist bench and a “living constitution,” they hardly would have bothered with the onerous process of formally amending the Constitution. Yet “constitution tinkering” (a then-popular phrase, especially among critics) was rampant in the Progressive Era, especially at the state level, with conservatives increasingly sounding the alarm about the possibility that Americans were starting to feel they had “outgrown the Constitution.” Between 1897 and 1929, a remarkable 1,370 amendment proposals were floated in Congress. By 1912, thirty-one of the forty-eight states had signed onto a plan to call a new constitutional convention, something never attempted since Philadelphia. During the 1912 elections, three of four major political parties—the Democrats, the Progressives, and the Socialists—included constitutional amendment in their national platforms. And of course, there are the four amendments actually ratified in the seven-year span from 1913 to 1920, on some of the most contentious issues of the day: taxation, the direct election of senators, Prohibition, and women’s suffrage.\n\nBy exaggerating unity in Progressive ranks, the realist account also obscures a vibrant, wide-ranging debate taking place at the turn of the century over the fate of the Constitution. Many Progressives were critical of America’s founding document. Yet the key question remained: did a break with the Constitution demand “a formal act of wholesale textual revision” or not? Lining up one side were the realists, thinkers like Holmes, Beard, Brandeis, and Woodrow Wilson, who reasoned that constitutional text was sufficiently elastic (particularly in phrases like “due process” or “the law of the land”) that changing its meaning simply took creative rereading. Others took the opposite view. In the words of editor Allan Benson, who ran for president on the Socialist Party ticket in 1916, “We need a new constitution. We cannot govern ourselves with the one we have. We have never governed ourselves with the one we have. A few have always governed us that they might the more easily prey upon us.” If the Constitution was, at its core, dead-set against majority rule (a fact that, ironically, Beard’s own origin story seemed to imply), then no amount of creative interpretation could make it democratic.\n\nPerhaps the most far-reaching consequence of the realist account of progressive legal theory has been to calcify an imagined link between legal realism and the political left. Revisiting the Progressive Era, however, illustrates how contingent this association really is. For one thing, even in Holmes’s day, the idea that judging consisted of decisions unpolluted by subjectivity and “worked out like mathematics from some general axioms of conduct” was a caricature. Nineteenth-century judges were well aware that general laws could not cover every situation in advance, leaving gaps that judges had to fill; the common law tradition itself (which nineteenth-century lawyers were steeped in), is stamped through and through with “judge-made law.” More to the point, during the Progressive Era it was often conservatives who applauded judges’ ability to adapt the Constitution to new situations—particularly if the alternative was radical change by amendment. Supreme Court opinions attributing Fourteenth Amendment rights to corporations as “persons” or asserting the existence of an unwritten “federal common law” to repel early regulatory assaults on property perfectly illustrate a conservative bench imbuing the Constitution with extra-textual moral or social values—a conservative “living constitution,” if you will.\n\nFor this reason, not all Progressives believed that the law could and should evolve by interpretation at the hands of judges. Against Louis Brandeis and the legal realists, many reformers called for strict construction of the law as a check on an emboldened federal bench, and insisted that, if laws were to change, it would have to be through textual revision by legislatures or popular assemblies (after all, the people, not judges, should have final say as to what the law meant). Unlike the conservative quarters in which legal formalism tended to flourish, however, Progressives also believed that the law lost its force and legitimacy if it was not frequently revisited and revised. Therefore, textual change had to be made achievable and regular—in the case of the U.S. Constitution, by lowering the Article V threshold for formal amendment—and, so that citizens could better spell out their commands, the “tools” of direct democracy, as blacksmith-turned-reformer William S. U’Ren viewed it, should be put into popular hands: the initiative, allowing voters to put bills before Congress for consideration; the referendum, which placed questions on the ballot for voters to resolve; and the recall, whereby voters could overturn unpopular judicial decisions or even remove judges from office. As crusading journalist William Allen White put it, reformers had “first to get the gun” before they could “hit something with it.”\n\nIn this Article, I refer to this school of thought as progressive formalism. With its emphasis on strict construction and literal understanding of popular sovereignty over higher law, it directly resembles the constitutional thought of Thomas Jefferson, the American founding father well-known for his radical democratic tenets and his belief that a constitutional convention should be held every nineteen years, the length of time he believed it took a generation to reach political maturity. Perhaps it is no coincidence, then, that Progressives like Herbert Croly often invoked Jefferson as an inspiration for the national democratic community they hoped to achieve.\n\nIn turn-of-the-century America, this strand of thinking cropped up in quarters as diverse as the urban business-minded Republican Party, increasingly torn between its conservative and insurgent wings; the Democrats, still the party of the South but nurturing a growing rural discontent toward the monied classes; and reformist circles as diverse as trade unions, anarchists, feminists, and evangelicals. Beyond the basic ground rules (a distrust of judicial discretion and an impatient desire to see American law updated and modernized), progressive formalism, like the umbrella movement of progressivism itself, housed a diversity of philosophical beliefs and political commitments. At times, what united these groups was little more than a vaguely defined, if “fierce discontent” with the status quo, and when it came to the purpose and aims of strict construction and textual revision, at least three diverse schools of thought existed.\n\nFor one group of progressive formalists, slippage in legal language represented a blank-check grant of authority to elites and officeholders, especially the judiciary, with its formidable powers of judicial review. For these Progressives, clear language and periodic textual revision were intended to give clear commands to officeholders and avoid abuses of power. For instance, during the legislative debates over the Sixteenth Amendment, designed to overturn an 1895 Supreme Court decision invalidating the national income tax, Senator Norris Brown of Nebraska explained that the purpose of the amendment was to “give the Court a Constitution that can not be interpreted two ways.” Other formalists feared the effects of loose construction, not in the hands of the judiciary but the President; Connecticut’s Democratic Governor Simeon E. Baldwin fretted in 1912 that “the future unfolding” of presidential power might leave “the perpetuity of our government” in doubt.\n\nProgressive formalism also appealed to a distinct brand of intellectual trying to square the period’s commitment to scientific progress with the static nature of written law. In the latter half of the nineteenth century, many American writers, influenced by accounts of the easy adaptability of the British “unwritten constitution,” grew concerned that American government was being held back from incorporating new scientific advances in economics, political science, public administration, and so forth by the Constitution’s rigidity. In a series of speeches and lectures, the populist North Carolina Judge Walter Clark likened the century-old Constitution to “the clothing of boyhood worn by the nearly mature man, which galls and binds his massive limbs and interferes with his development.” Progressives feared that what public intellectual Herbert Croly called “the monarchy of the Constitution” was locked in, not just by the daunting supermajorities Article V required for amendment, but also by Americans’ spirit of legal and cultural conservatism. The year 1914 saw both the brilliant Walter Lippmann call for replacing drift (complacency, superstition, conservatism) in public affairs with a spirit of mastery (science, planning, and progress) while Judge Clark asked wryly, “When is it that we shall cease to invoke the spirits of departed fools?”\n\nA third defense of amendment came out of the forty-eight states, especially the West, where a particularly pure form of popular democracy thrived and where regular constitutional amendment was a matter of principle. State reformers in Oregon, Washington, California, Arizona, New Mexico, and Oklahoma wrote up new constitutions at stark variance with the Framers’ Constitution: they were longer, with detailed lists of rights, governing bodies, and procedures; they were easier to amend, often by simple majority vote; and they placed the tools of direct higher lawmaking in citizens’ hands. These ideas trickled up to the national level: in 1911, Senator Jonathan Bourne of Oregon helped draft the charter of “Fighting Bob” La Follette’s National Progressive Republican League (NPRL), an insurgent wing of the Republican Party that called for direct primaries, direct election of senators, and amending state constitutions to give voters the initiative, referendum, and recall. A year later, the Progressive Party vied for the presidency on a platform scripted off the NPRL charter. Their champion, former President Teddy Roosevelt, told voters on the campaign trail that he believed in a “pure democracy” where the people could “readily . . . amend” the Constitution “if at any point it works injustice” and could settle by popular vote “what the proper construction of any constitutional point is.”\n\nHeady and exciting as amendment fervor was at its peak, by the end of World War I progressive formalism was largely spent. Several factors played a role. Progressivism in general suffered a decline after World War I as the excesses of the Woodrow Wilson Administration soured Americans on a top-down, bureaucratic vision of governance. The four Progressive-Era amendments sapped the public’s appetite for further revisions; Prohibition in particular seemed to embody the evils of direct democracy and the futility of trying to legislate public morality. Perhaps the most critical factor, however, was progressivism’s failure to bridge its formalist–pragmatist divide. After 1918, when the national Progressive Party dissolved, most of its members were folded into the Republican Party, notwithstanding the fact that under Democratic president Woodrow Wilson much of the Progressives’ 1912 policy prescriptions had already been achieved: banking reform, labor protection, environmental conservation, tariff reduction, antitrust law, farm subsidies, and the broadening of national regulatory power over the economy. Progressivism was “scooped” by Wilson at the constitutional level, too; his activist presidency and famous theory of the Constitution as a “vehicle of life” able to evolve to fit “the spirit of the age” seemed to teach constitutional discontents that even “hard wired” structures need not be immovable given a President capable of molding popular opinion through powerful public leadership. As President, Wilson pressed the limits of constitutional structure, proving that watershed political change did not require a constitutional amendment—a lesson his progressive successor, Franklin D. Roosevelt, also took to heart. Over the long run, the Progressives’ radical institutional experimentation gave way to the living constitution, legal realism, and eventually, New Deal technocratic paternalism. Lawyers and judges, among the earliest proponents of progressive constitutional reforms, turned away from direct democracy after the war and towards litigation as the solution to the public’s problems. Others found that the same path led them to social science. By 1924, the crusades of Senator La Follette, who revived the Progressive Party for one last try at the presidency, complete with calls for a wide variety of constitutional amendments, had come to seem a “pie-in-the-sky” remnant of an earlier age. FDR’s Brain Trust marked perhaps the perfect symbol of Progressivism’s abandonment of pure democratic faith for a rule by experts.\n\nWhen it comes to constitutional change today, America is still thoroughly in the grip of realism: as constitutional scholar Bruce Ackerman puts it, “We have lost our ability to write.” As years pass with no amendments, more and more of our “operational” constitutional canon lies outside the four corners of the text. Some consider this a normal state of affairs under a short, written constitution like ours. However, our brief look back at Progressive Era critiques of judicial interpretation in a legislative vacuum shows that this was not always so. More to the point, the Progressives clearly saw that such a state of affairs gives elites pride of place in defining the Constitution’s meaning. Today, we might think of boutique appellate litigation firms, Supreme Court “super-precedents,” or theories from the academy providing glosses on America’s “unwritten constitution” to see that the situation has not really changed. And while this state of affairs is hardly new (Alexis de Tocqueville called the legal profession in America an “aristocratic element” ), the Progressives’ rise suggests that at a certain point, it hits an intolerable limit. The more formal change to the law is blocked off, the more society depends on textual interpretation to adapt the Constitution to broader political values. Yet where major questions of politics become judicial, predictably constitutionalism becomes unacceptably political. It is ironic that today, the Supreme Court’s very preeminence may threaten the legitimacy of the constitutional project itself.\n\nAlthough this Article seeks to recover a tradition of Progressive constitutional politics, my purpose is not to suggest that formal amendment is the only legitimate mode of constitutional change. Some modern-day originalists do make this argument, but as a practical matter, a “two-track model” where formal and informal change supplement each other seems the only plausible account of how constitutional change actually takes place. Progressive formalism may have died out for specific historical reasons, but it is also worth keeping in mind that the theory itself has undeniable structural disadvantages. State constitutions, a near-perfect representation of the theory, tend to be long, bulky, and frequently revised; a contemporary critic of the 1907 Oklahoma constitution, then the longest ever written, fretted that it “destroy[s] . . . the distinction between it and a statute.” In Latin America, a region where, like the fifty states, constitutional amendment is relatively easy, too-frequent amendment is thought to have led to perverse consequences, including weak courts and legal instability. Formalism adapted to reformist ends rejects the possibility of easy, gradual, common law-style adaptation of law to current needs; keeping law current requires constant revision by legislatures or popular assemblies. The parallel with Thomas Jefferson’s nineteen-year cycles of constitutional amendment is hardly coincidental; as alluring as Jefferson’s ideal of popular sovereignty has remained for generations of Americans, his idea of a cyclical refounding is burdened with impracticality, demanding so much, as it does, of the private citizen.\n\nFormalism—of any stripe—also suffers from a deeper problem. Can there be a constitution (or any legal language) that is perfectly unambiguous and self-executing? Charles Beard seemed on the cutting edge of sophistication in his day when he exposed the “fiction that the legislator or the judge is a puppet moved inexorably in the right and only possible direction by an unseen force called ‘law.’” In some ways, not much has changed. A 2017 Harvard Law symposium on the formalism of its one-time dean, Christopher Columbus Langdell, announced: “There is no proposition to which virtually all members of the Harvard Law Faculty would assent, except perhaps one: The exception is the idea that, in law, the rejection of formalism is the beginning of all wisdom.” The notion that words can have a fixed meaning has something inescapably hokey about it. Yet we still believe in comparatively more or less ambiguous commands: the term “due process,” for instance, is vague enough that a young Felix Frankfurter supported a constitutional amendment to scrub it from the text, while at the other end of the spectrum are seemingly “inescapable” commands that erect “hard wired” structures and rules: judicial life tenure, bicameralism and presentment in lawmaking, or the design of the Electoral College. Besides, however unattainable formalism may be in practice, the Progressives’ suspicion of governing elites, their critique of “judicial usurpation,” and their yearning for direct, communal democracy are not easily dismissed, even today. This may be because a hundred years after the end of progressive formalism, we are still in search of the same end: submitting political power to legible democratic controls.\n\nI. The Progressive Crisis of Law and Democracy\n\nAs the nineteenth century drew to a close, Americans across the nation took a look around and found much to be displeased with. The citizenry had been lulled into complacency by a series of “blowsy romanticisms,” wrote the historian Vernon Parrington—the independent farmer, Jeffersonian democracy, frontier life, and universal male suffrage—and now American democracy had fallen into the wrong hands. A cadre of newly moneyed elites was exploiting America’s “lawless and unregulated individualism” to turn the federal government into a “mouthpiece and agent of property interests.” Party machines, with their deep pockets and tight-knit, bottom-up structure, hand-selected candidates (including for President), set legislative priorities, and staffed the public bureaucracy. In its role as protector of individual rights against state action, the Supreme Court had proven a disappointment, dismantling, under the aegis of the Fourteenth Amendment, the state and federal governments’ best efforts to protect workers under law. Collectively, it made for an American government uniquely unresponsive to the popular will: party politics were shot through with bribery and corruption; the federal bureaucracy was a morass of patronage and incompetence; Congress was prone to immobilism and capture by wealthy elites; and the President was a weakling beholden to his party.\n\nThe Progressives saw hope on the horizon, however. A series of events had shaken the nation’s faith in its institutions, making it a propitious time for reform: the Whiskey Ring and Crédit Mobilier scandals of the Grant Administration; widespread discontent at Reconstruction and Jim Crow alike; the growing strength of the women’s suffrage movement; the protracted agrarian and labor unrest that culminated in the 1886 Haymarket bombings, the nationwide Pullman strike, and the 1896 presidential campaign of William Jennings Bryan; disputes over the tariff and the gold standard; and the constant thrum of “muck-raking” exposés of political corruption, urban squalor, and rampant price-gouging among the “trusts.” “The Age of Innocence,” concluded Parrington, was “past, and a mood of honest realism was putting away the naive myths that passed for history and substituting homely authentic fact.”\n\nThe swelling discontent that percolated into the Progressive movement took shape in the late 1870s. In cities like Detroit, Cleveland, Jersey City, and New York, a coalition of middle-class voters, intellectuals, and urban reformers began to contest and win municipal elections. As they wrested back control over local government from the political bosses, the new Progressives launched a series of reforms to make government “less unbusinesslike” (that is, more effective, efficient, and less corrupt): civil service reform, the introduction of scientific methods into government, and the forging of closer ties with universities. Around the same time, progressive ideas started to win adherents in the South and West as struggling farmers bolted from small-government Bourbon Democrats like Samuel Tilden and Grover Cleveland and toward reformers like “The Great Commoner” William Jennings Bryan, whose 1896 presidential campaign platform called for stronger antitrust laws, regulation of the railroads, monetary inflation, a protective tariff, and an income tax, all of which, unusually for the party of the South, demanded expanding governmental powers at the national level. After an 1885 article in the Nation by British jurist A.V. Dicey praised the Swiss referendum as a worthy tool for “the most democratic population of Europe,” direct democracy took off at the grassroots level. The Democratic Party endorsed the national initiative and recall in 1896. In 1898, South Dakota became the first state to enact these into law. Fourteen more states did so by 1914.\n\nBut the heady swell of progress soon hit a wall. Radical constitutional experimentation by the states survived scrutiny by the Supreme Court, but economic regulation proved a bridge too far. In 1877, the Court had delivered reformers a victory with its holding in Munn v. Illinois that states could regulate any business “affected with a public interest,” including common carriers like railroads and grain elevators, which allowed farmers to access national markets. Justice Stephen Field vociferously dissented, arguing that business’s essentially private character fell outside the government’s regulatory powers:\n\nA tailor’s or a shoemaker’s shop would still retain its private character, even though the assembled wisdom of the State should declare, by organic act or legislative ordinance, that such a place was a public workshop, and that the workmen were public tailors or public shoemakers. One might as well attempt to change the nature of colors, by giving them a new designation.\n\nEnsuing decades proved Justice Field farsighted and Munn an aberration. Time and again, unwritten “higher principles” of law were invoked by the Court to invalidate democratic creations that threatened the power of business. In its 1895 Pollock v. Farmers’ Loan and Trust Co. decision, the Court struck down a federal income tax applying to just the top two percent of earners on a cramped reading of Congress’s taxation power based, according to the dissent, on “[economic] theories” and not “its meaning in the Constitution. In 1898, a unanimous Court invalidated, on due process grounds, a Nebraska statute that fixed railroad rates at a level the Court considered “unreasonably low.” In the 1905 case that gave the period its name, Lochner v. New York, the Court held that a New York law setting a weekly maximum on workhours for bakers violated the Fourteenth Amendment’s protection of “liberty of contract as well as of person.” These liberties featured again in a pair of cases striking down laws outlawing “yellow-dog” contracts, which forbade workers from joining a union. Concerns of federalism loomed large for the Court when it ruled that a business conglomerate in control of 98% of the nation’s sugar refining capacity was beyond the 1890 Sherman Antitrust Act’s reach because the Constitution gave Congress power only to regulate “commerce,” whereas sugar refining was “manufacture” and thus under the purview of the states. Similar federalism concerns motivated the Court’s invalidation of congressional attempts to prohibit child labor. These same doctrines did not appear to trouble the Court when it approved use of the Sherman Act to break up labor unions and strikes.\n\nDisappointed Progressives lashed out against the courts. “Why should social legislation for the twentieth century be limited by judicial norms propounded in the eighteenth century?” demanded Clyde King, a political scientist. After Pollock came down, appeals court Judge Seymour Thompson thundered, “Our judicial annals do not afford an instance of a more unpatriotic subserviency to the demands of the rich and powerful classes.” Princeton Professor Edward Corwin argued that the very idea of due process was “not a legal concept at all; it comprises nothing more or less than a roving commission to judges to sink whatever legislative craft may appear to them to be, from the standpoint of vested interests, of a piratical tendency.” Theodore Schroeder, co-founder of the ACLU precursor Free Speech League who defended the anarchist Emma Goldman at trial, held forth in the Yale Law Journal:\n\nSo long as our judicial opinions are formed by the mental processes of the intellectual bankrupts these will only be crude justifications of predispositions acquired through personal or class interests and sympathy, “moral” superstitions, or whim and caprice.\n\nHarvard Law Professor Roscoe Pound sympathized with the public frustration but concluded benignly that it was foolish to blame judges for a “want of sympathy with social legislation” when such views merely reflected what they had been taught as young lawyers. “I do not criticize these decisions,” Pound wrote: “As the law stands, I do not doubt they were rightly determined.” It was true, Pound admitted, that the law tended towards conservatism. The longevity of institutions, judges’ adherence to precedent, and the high hurdles placed on the passage of legislation and constitutional amendments were all stabilizing forces, making the law a frequent drag on political change. But this was not necessarily so. The problem, Pound concluded, lay in “our legal thinking and legal teaching.” The “individualist spirit” that animated the common law “agree[d] ill with a collectivist age.” The modern-day sociologist and economist understood that “the isolated individual” was no longer “the center of the universe.” Yet the theories of property and freedom of contract still taught at law schools remained stubbornly indifferent to modern circumstances. Louis Brandeis agreed. The social sciences had adapted to the changes of the late nineteenth century—a revolution, wrote Brandeis, “which affected the life of the people more fundamentally than any political revolution known to history.” But “legal science” remained “largely deaf and blind” to these changes. Something had to give way.\n\nHow could the federal bar be coaxed into the modern age? The first step was to do away with sentimental old fictions that kept lawyers from seeing things clearly. In 1881, Brandeis’s hero, Oliver Wendell Holmes, had revolutionized American jurisprudence with The Common Law, a hard-boiled critique of nineteenth-century formalism, with its mawkish faith in logical syllogisms and eternal, pre-political values. For Holmes, such pretensions to objectivity merely masked the subjective decisions judges were actually making: law was not some “brooding omnipresence in the sky,” as he later wrote, but rather the product of “prevalent moral and political theories, intuitions of public policy, avowed or unconscious, even the prejudices which judges share with their fellow-men.” These were the factors that influenced judges’ thinking and that defined the rules under which men and women lived. If true, then the solution to errors on the bench was to make the study of law more “rational” and scientific by infusing judicial decision-making with the teachings of history and economics. As Holmes stated in his widely circulated 1897 speech “The Path of the Law”:\n\n[History] is a part of the rational study [of law], because it is the first step toward an enlightened scepticism, that is, towards a deliberate reconsideration of the worth of those rules. When you get the dragon out of his cave on to the plain and in the daylight, you can count his teeth and claws, and see just what is his strength. But to get him out is only the first step. The next is either to kill him, or to tame him and make him a useful animal. For the rational study of the law the blackletter man may be the man of the present, but the man of the future is the man of statistics and the master of economics. It is revolting to have no better reason for a rule of law than that so it was laid down in the time of Henry IV. It is still more revolting if the grounds upon which it was laid down have vanished long since, and the rule simply persists from blind imitation of the past.\n\nIn the years that followed, Holmes would get his wish, as reformers like Louis Brandeis helped inspire a generation of young lawyers to become literate in statistics and economics. As counsel for the State of Oregon in Muller v. Oregon, Brandeis submitted to the Supreme Court a 100-page brief studded with medical data, survey results, and theories about the unhealthy effects of excess work on female laborers. At the same time, by the time of Holmes’s celebrated quip in Lochner—“[t]he 14th Amendment does not enact Mr. Herbert Spencer’s Social Statics”—his broadside against formalism had led a new generation to doubt whether the law itself had any determinate content to it whatsoever. By the middle third of the century, a plethora of theories would step in to fill the void left by Holmes’s attack on formalism, including legal realism, positivism, and legal process theory. In the short term, though, the result was to sever law’s form from its content, delivering legal reformers a way to make the law quickly “evolve” and rescue the legitimacy of a tarnished bench. Now, Progressive lawyers could defuse criticism of the law’s supposed inherent conservatism with an easy reply: the problem lay, not with the law itself or the institutions it erected, but with misguided judges imbuing the law with the wrong set of values. These, after all, could be re-educated, or simply replaced.\n\nII. Two Strands of Progressive Constitutionalism\n\nThe same debate was going on in parallel with regard to constitutional law. Building upon the fierce discontent of muckrakers, laborers, and other early discontents, a generation of reformers would recast early critiques of the bench into a full-fledged indictment of the constitutional system. On this account, the social injustice and economic inequality plaguing the country were the fault of a constitutional system that, while useful in its own time, could no longer serve the interests of a modern, industrial society. Common-law historicism loomed large in these critiques, just as it had in Holmes’s attack on nineteenth-century formalism.\n\nProgressives’ charges against the Constitution included its protection of property, its limitation of federal power, and the anti-majoritarian nature of checks and balances. When Frank Goodnow, a Columbia University political scientist and pioneer in administrative law, wrote that theories of the social compact and natural rights formed the “basis of the American constitutional system,” he meant to connote superstition and unreason, the legal equivalent of pre-Darwinian creationism. Charles Beard, then Goodnow’s junior colleague at Columbia, had equally little patience for theories that viewed the law as “made out of some abstract stuff known as ‘justice.’” It was hardly a coincidence that by the time of Lochner, critics and supporters alike associated such uncodified “higher” principles with the Lockean trinity of “life, liberty, and property” and with the increasingly problematic conclusion that, whatever the economic dislocations of the industrial age, government could not interfere with the citizen’s right to acquire property. Insofar as it was built upon such premises, the Constitution was stuck in Jefferson’s America—an egalitarian, agrarian preindustrial oasis that the Industrial Revolution had buried and to which the United States would never return.\n\nAnother serious defect of the Constitution was the weak central government it established. With Congress’s authority limited to a short list of “enumerated powers” and refracted through a needlessly complicated scheme—staggered elections, the presidential veto, and authority shared with the states—an enormous regulatory vacuum had been created. Not only were the several states stuck futilely trying to regulate corporations operating across state borders with their limited tools, but the Lochner Court had already compounded Congress’s disadvantage by considerably narrowing the meaning of “interstate commerce.”\n\nThese and other “discovered faults” of the text were being “perpetuated,” wrote one constitutional historian borrowing the words of James Madison in The Federalist, by a demanding amendment process that insulated the Constitution against change. After all, as the political scientist Munroe Smith pointed out, the purpose of a written constitution was “not to enable a minority to thwart persistently and successfully the matured and deliberate will of a clear majority, but to insure the formation, on the part of the majority, of a purpose that is matured and deliberate.” Article V required two-thirds of both houses of Congress to propose an amendment, and even then, it took three-fourths of the states to make it law. Smith found this ridiculous: “In what other nation, possessing representative institutions, would a measure supported by so large a majority of the people fail of effect?” The three-fourths threshold might have made sense under “the social, economic, and political conditions of the thirteen original states,” but the population was larger, more diverse, more divided in its interests now. Political scientist Frank Goodnow agreed. Surveying recent constitutions in Canada (1867), the German Empire (1871), and Australia (1900), which concentrated regulatory power in the national legislature and were comparatively easy to amend, Goodnow concluded it was safe to assume “that, if the American people were called upon at the present time to frame a scheme of federal government, they would adopt one which departed in a number of respects from the one under which we now live.”\n\nA flurry of accounts began to reexamine the Constitution’s origins with the aim of exposing its ostensible faults. Most important by far was Charles Beard’s 1913 An Economic Interpretation of the Constitution, which depicted the Constitution as the handiwork of a cadre of self-interested elites contriving to protect their property from “the reach of popular majorities.” Beard’s story was echoed by scores of writers. Journalist Walter Weyl, seizing on the anti-monopolist sentiment of the time, provocatively described the Constitution as “a political trust.” Herbert Croly’s 1914 Progressive Democracy, one of the most important books of the period, described checks and balances as the pure manifestation of the Framers’ “profound suspicion of human nature,” an “organization of obstacles and precautions” that cemented in place a government “divided against itself” and so incapable of concerted, deliberate action as to be “deliberately and effectively weakened.” A young Woodrow Wilson, while not a devotee of Beardian skepticism, nonetheless seemed to agree that it would be difficult to find “a constitution upon record more complicated with balances than ours.” Historian J. Allen Smith blasted the familiar metaphor of the Constitution as a “sacred compact” signed by a “sovereign people”: “Nothing,” he wrote, “was farther from the minds” of the Framers than creating a popular body “distinct from, and entirely outside of, the government, which would control the Constitution and through it all officials who exercised political power.” Franklin Pierce, a New York lawyer and antitariff and antitrust reformer, called the Constitution, with more than a touch of hyperbole, “the most undemocratic instrument to be found in any country in the world [today].” Whatever the truth, it was clear, to Progressives at least, that the Constitution neither served the people nor had it ever been intended to do so.\n\nThe question was: What to do about it?\n\nA. The Revolt Against Formalism\n\nSome Progressives saw in Oliver Wendell Holmes’s ostensible revolution in legal theory the Trojan horse that could infiltrate the citadel of the Constitution. Since being appointed to the bench in 1902, Justice Holmes had been busily applying his historicist lens to the Constitution. In a well-known opinion heavy with Darwinian metaphor, Holmes explained that, in the Constitution, the Founders had “called into life a being the development of which could not have been foreseen completely by the most gifted of its begetters.” Over the years, the Constitution had so grown and changed that to do it justice, interpreters had to consider it “in the light of our whole experience and not merely in that of what was said a hundred years ago.” Unlike his conservative brethren, Holmes believed that no “higher law” dictated the Constitution’s meaning but what humankind required as a matter of social necessity. On this view, if the Constitution was, as Charles Beard felt, just a compendium of “vague words” and “ambiguous expressions,” then in practice, it represented no obstacle to extensive reform. The Constitution “could be reconstructed to mean whatever social movements wanted the text to mean. By rereading the document to serve popular ends, citizens could empty it of any troubling symbolic power.”\n\nIt was a quintessentially pragmatist point of view and one well-suited to the many Progressives who came from the ranks of the social sciences. While a professor at Princeton University in 1908, Woodrow Wilson wrote in his magnum opus, Constitutional Government: “The Constitution contains no theories. It is as practical a document as Magna Carta.” After devoting nearly the whole of his 1911 Social Reform and the Constitution to the question whether the Constitution was “an adequate vehicle of a modern state,” Frank Goodnow concluded that if the answer was no, then the fault lay not\n\nwith the instrument itself, nor with its framers, nor yet with those who first interpreted it, but with its official guardians today, who, to say the least, have a fair choice between principles that will adapt that instrument, in the words of Marshall, “to the various crises in human affairs” “for ages to come” and between more restrictive concepts a really straightforward application of which would have throttled the national life long before this.\n\nFrom these meditations on the law’s “flexibility” came a hopeful conclusion: Whatever ailed American democracy, it could be cured by reading. As a result, these critics saw no reason to call for extensive formal revisions since the document had little fixed content.\n\nOne obvious problem with realism, however, was that it was unavoidably judge-centric and status quoist. There was something that rankled about Progressives raging against the “guardianship of the robe” only to replace its members and leave it intact. It was typically conservatives who praised the judiciary for wisely dispensing a body of judge-made law that allowed the Constitution to naturally adapt to “the ever-increasing wants of a rapidly swelling population.” Yet this position scarcely differed from Brandeis’s in his 1916 speech: “What we need is not to displace the courts, but to make them efficient instruments of justice; not to displace the lawyer, but to fit him for his official or judicial task.” Stripped of the formalists’ professed belief in the unchanging nature of the Constitution, it was telling that progressive realists now coincided with their enemies on the question of judicial supremacy.\n\nAnother problem with realism was that it left Progressives exposed to the charge that theirs was a government, not of laws, but of men. Reformers insisted that the law had always been made by judges applying “their [own] sense of justice or public policy” to open-ended language. But they faced a hard time convincing their political opponents to admit as much. The Supreme Court, insisted one conservative, was a devoted servant of the law and would always refuse “to admit the argument from convenience to overthrow the plain letter of the constitution.” Supreme Court Justice Horace Lurton fulminated: “Neither a Constitution nor a statute is to be treated by either the executive or the judiciary as if it were a ‘nose of wax,’ to be twisted and moulded according to the fancy of the occasion.” “If our Constitution is too rigid,” Lurton challenged critics, “let us amend [it].” Justice Lurton’s challenge may have been rhetorical, but many in his time were willing to take him at his word. B. Progressive Formalism: Why Write?\n\nIn 1925, a speaker at the Alabama State Bar Association’s annual meeting warned his audience that they were living in an “Age of Constitutional Amendments.” With criticism of the Constitution at an alarming high, “Constitution tinkering” was fast becoming “the leading outdoor sport” of “political quacks” who ran for office on the idea of adding one or more amendments to the Constitution—not to improve the text, but for the cynical purpose of “momentarily riding into office through this unpatriotic appeal made to these elements of discontent.”\n\nEasy as it is from a present-day vantage point to see amending the Constitution as a fringe idea, in the Progressive Era calls for its amendment were popular, intense, and sustained. In 1897, constitutional historian Herman Ames counted 1,736 amendment proposals initiated on the floor of Congress since the Founding. Not thirty years later, a follow-up study counted an additional 1,370. Just sixteen years after Ames concluded that “insurmountable” obstacles lay in the way of formal amendment came the ratification of the first of four constitutional amendments passed in a decade: the Sixteenth established the income tax (passed by Congress in 1909 and ratified by the states in 1913); the Seventeenth authorized the direct election of senators (passed 1912, ratified 1913); the Eighteenth banned the transport and sale of alcohol (passed 1917, ratified 1919); and the Nineteenth gave women the right to vote (passed 1919, ratified 1920). Real political pressure also existed in favor of an idea not attempted since the Founding: a national convention to draft a new constitution entirely. Between 1893 and 1911, thirty-one states passed seventy-three petitions demanding a constitutional convention. One such petition, signed by twenty-three states calling for a convention authorized to vote on five specific amendments, helped nudge a reluctant Senate to vote to send the Seventeenth Amendment to the states for ratification in 1909.\n\nFor those behind these amendments, constitutional reform-by-interpretation was plainly not enough. But why not? Broadly, these arguments fell into three categories. The first was preservationist in its instincts, motivated by the fear that ambiguity in the text was enabling institutional aggrandizement, especially in the judiciary. Tapping into popular frustration with “judicial usurpation,” it weaponized the idea of clever judges and lawyers molding words to obtain the results they desired. Many also feared an activist presidency turning open-ended language to the same ends. A second group, more technocratic, focused on amendment as a means, not to rights protection or direct democracy, but rather to efficient governance. Amending a “rigid” old Constitution would open up American democracy to new currents of thought, especially best practices of economics, public administration, and constitutional design coming from abroad in Europe, and of course, would allow the “best men” possible to serve in government. Third and finally were the popular democrats, insurgents in the Republican and Democratic parties, left-wing radicals, cultural critics of the Constitution, and reformers in the states. The most genuinely aspirational of the three groups, they had a constitutional philosophy patterned on Jeffersonian democracy, which viewed continued lawmaking as a way to guarantee the People’s authorship over the government and mastery of their own democracy.\n\n1. The Legalists: Strict Construction as Institutional Maintenance\n\nAlthough the Progressives dreamed of forging a new American democracy, their experimentation with new political institutions—municipal boards, labor unions, a professionalized civil service—was often rooted in nostalgia, a search for a way to bring things back to the way they were. There is no better example than Herbert Croly’s call for “Hamiltonian means to achieve Jeffersonian ends.” Capturing the zeitgeist of uplift and inquiry, Croly’s 1909 The Promise of American Life so delighted former President Theodore Roosevelt when he read it that he went on to hire Croly as an advisor for his 1912 presidential campaign. Croly praised Americans’ “old sense of a glorious national destiny” under the ideals of Jefferson. But he was convinced that, under new economic conditions, Jefferson’s egalitarian society could not be achieved by “an essentially individualistic machinery.” To become viable again, Jefferson’s ideal had to be transformed with “the aid of the Hamiltonian nationalistic organization and principle” into “a democracy devoted to the welfare of the whole people.”\n\nThe same way that modernity had spoiled the Jeffersonian ideal by wrenching apart liberty and equality, so too the Constitution had become an unreliable guide through the years, though its words had hardly changed. The nation’s descent into civil war produced the first sustained period of constitutional disenchantment. The architect of Southern secession John C. Calhoun argued that to avoid crisis the Constitution should be amended to devolve power over commerce to the states, divide the presidency into two branches to represent Northern and Southern constituencies, and create a new body (“the concurrent majority”) with power to veto federal legislation. In 1861, in a desperate bid to avoid war, Congress endorsed an amendment that offered the South eternal perpetuation of slavery without federal government interference. A handful of states ratified the so-called Corwin Amendment, but the process was interrupted by the outbreak of war. At the height of the fighting, Sidney George Fisher blamed Article V’s rigidity for failing to prevent war: “The safety-valve did not work, and the boiler has burst.”\n\nTo Fisher and a long line of comparatively minded scholars that followed, next to its counterpart in Britain, the U.S. Constitution suffered from a serious defect: it was immensely difficult to amend. While Britain’s “flexible” constitution could be amended as easily as modifying or repealing a statute, amending America’s “rigid” Constitution required summoning an imaginary sovereign “body” of three-fourths of the state legislatures acting in concert. Invoking Hobbes’s metaphor of the People as a sleeping sovereign, British constitutional theorist A.V. Dicey called America’s sovereign “a monarch who slumbers and sleeps”:\n\n[He] has been roused to serious action but once during the course of ninety years. It needed the thunder of the Civil War to break his repose, and it may be doubted whether anything short of impending revolution will ever again arouse him to activity. But a monarch who slumbers for years is like a monarch who does not exist. A federal constitution is capable of change, but for all that a federal constitution is apt to be unchangeable.\n\nSo long as the sovereign slept, constitutional change would take one of two paths: customary growth that altered its workings without changing its language, or cycles of discontent and revolution, such as had been France’s tragic fate since the Revolution. In an 1849 essay, John Stuart Mill had described how the Revolution of 1848 had been provoked by the oppressive monarch Louis Philippe and his nearly amendment-proof Charter of 1830. Rigidity ultimately proved fatal to the regime’s survival, Mill explained, for when institutions “seem to oppose an unyielding barrier to the progress of improvement, the advancing tide heaps itself up behind them till it bears them down.” No government could be permanent, Mill concluded, “unless it guarantees progress as well as order.”\n\nAcross the Atlantic, some scholarly voices were starting to fear that Article V was sending America barreling down the same explosive path. In 1867, John A. Jameson, a professor and judge with pronounced anti-majoritarian convictions, described amendment procedures as “safety-valves”: they should be neither adjustable “with too great facility, lest they become the ordinary escape-pipes of party passion,” nor so stiff “that the force needed to induce action is sufficient to explode the machine.” Columbia University’s John Burgess, no Progressive himself, warned in 1890 that “revolution and violence” could be the result where rigid amendment mechanisms allowed “the well-matured, long and deliberately formed will of the undoubted majority . . . [to] be persistently and successfully thwarted.” Certainly, wrote the political scientist Munroe Smith, when the Framers designed a mechanism to “escape from the restraints” of the even more rigid Articles of Confederation, they had not meant “to make the new Constitution unchangeable except by another coup d’état or revolution”! Smith and others advocated easier Article V amendment to allow for regular—not revolutionary—change.\n\nEven if one agreed with the viewpoint, often held by conservatives, that judge-made law served a crucial function in adapting the Constitution to “the ever-increasing wants of a rapidly swelling population,” the question naturally arose whether judges were not, in fact, creating some sort of shadow Constitution supplanting the one the Framers had written. In his 1907 Christianity and the Social Crisis, Progressive theologian Walter Rauschenbusch summed up these worries: “We are witnessing to-day, beyond question, the decay—perhaps not permanent, but at any rate the decay—of republican institutions. No man in his right mind can deny it” :\n\nWe have, in fact, one kind of constitution on paper, and another system of government in fact. That is usually the way when a slow revolution is taking place in the distribution of political and economic power. The old structure apparently remains intact, but actually the seat of power has changed.\n\nScholarly and mainstream political proposals, including the 1912 and 1924 platforms of the Progressive Party, started to call for a constitutional amendment to eliminate or limit the power of judicial review. One such advocate was Walter Clark, a state supreme court judge who detested the power of federal judges. It had been a grievous error, Clark insisted, to give federal judges life tenure, but it was all the worse since the judiciary had given itself the power to declare laws unconstitutional, a power found nowhere in the text and which no other nation granted (at the time). Now, the judiciary’s expansive construction of the Fourteenth Amendment to invalidate any legislation conceivably affecting the “due process of law” was sucking “the whole body of reserved rights of the States into the maelstrom of the Federal Courts.” “Nothing can save us from this centripetal force but the speedy repeal of the Fourteenth Amendment or a recasting of its language in that no future court can misinterpret it,” plus an amendment to make federal judges popularly elected for fixed terms.\n\nA related concern lay among those who desired a strong government to face the challenges of a corporate industrial economy but wanted to make sure state power lay on proper legal footing. They, too, saw amendments as a way to ensure precise limits on the powers of government and to prevent the stretching of the rule of law. Many were concerned about the President in light of new powers exercised by strong executives, like William McKinley, Theodore Roosevelt, and Woodrow Wilson, over legislative matters such as labor relations, foreign policy, and war. Contemporaries who viewed the President as an “elected king” included Rhode Island politician William B. Lawrence and New York lawyer Henry C. Lockwood, both of whom called for resituating executive power into a plural executive body modeled on Switzerland’s seven-member council and appointed for short terms by Congress. New York lawyer Franklin Pierce, a Progressive who criticized President Roosevelt’s expansive use of powers, proposed a long slate of amendments in his 1908 Federal Usurpation to correct the constitutional imbalance and stop the text’s growth “by construction or usurpation.” One of Pierce’s ideas was to assist Congress by streamlining the legislative process—the House of Representatives would be made “supreme in lawmaking” with the Senate allowed just a veto—and expanding the list of Congress’s regulatory powers. Pierce also suggested limiting the President’s term to seven years with no reelection. These same ideas were espoused by William Howard Taft, a man widely criticized in his own time as a reactionary, yet who often found common cause with Progressives on policy. Taft himself detested the degrading practice of presidential campaigning, and he thought that limiting the President to a single term would give him “greater courage and independence in the discharge of his duties.” He also believed that the constitutional Framers should have brought “the executive a little closer in touch with Congress” in drafting and debating legislation, especially budgets, though he feared that even such a sensible change would open the door to “radical changes in the Constitution subversive of the great benefits that it has secured to the American people.” At the same time, as president, Taft did help steer a constitutional amendment through Congress in 1909. Taft, always attuned to economy and efficiency in government, was concerned that the Court’s 1895 Pollock decision was leaving the government cash-strapped. He felt that an income tax was good policy but believed that it had to come via a constitutional amendment because simply ignoring Pollock and reviving the income tax law would not “strengthen popular confidence in the stability of judicial construction of the Constitution. It is much wiser policy to accept the decision and remedy the defect by amendment in due and regular course.”\n\nAlthough progressively minded legalists shared the conservatives’ distrust of concentrated power and vague grants of political authority, they supported stronger government to meet new conditions—provided that power was exercised strictly in accordance with the rule of law. Constitutional change was, for them, a way to keep things within limits. Their credo may be best embodied by the modern maxim, “If we want things to stay as they are, things will have to change.”\n\n2. The “Best Men”: Bringing the Constitution in Line with the Times\n\nLess reverential in their attitude toward the law, and vastly less sentimental toward the Constitution, was a group that hailed mostly from the ranks of the elite and the academy. The true pragmatists of the period, they had a faith in progress and the ability of science to improve government and society. They published copiously in popular magazines like McClure’s Magazine, the North American Review, Outlook, The Nation, and The New Republic, and they also used new professional journals cropping up in the fields of economics, law, sociology, and political science to make their viewpoints known. Their commitment was, not to law’s integrity, but to law as a means to better ends. To that effect, they viewed the Constitution, not as a vital symbol of the nation, but as an unfinished draft.\n\nAn 1886 article in the North American Review captured well the spirit of inquiry and fervor: “Before the Civil War the Constitution was our national fetich. To doubt the wisdom of its founders was heresy.” But the war had changed everything: “The North rose from its knees among the grave-stones, and it no longer tried to decipher their moss-grown records. We ceased to ask what the dead Fathers had said, and cared only to know what the living sons should do.” The Framers had feared democracy; a new generation realized that a large electorate was a defense against corruption. The Framers feared centralized tyranny; it had been the states, not the federal government, that had brought the nation to the brink of ruin. The Framers feared the radicalism of the “popular branch”; it was the Senate that now threatened to destroy federalism through its insidious combinations with wealthy corporations that eluded the law.\n\nIn 1897, constitutional historian Herman Ames concluded that the difficulty of amendment meant an increasing inability to apply new advances in the “science of government” to American institutions. The amateurishness of Congress was a main cause of the problem, argued editor E.L. Godkin in 1870:\n\nWhat with ignorance, haste, want of training, and the distractions of an infinite variety of details and of multifarious conflicting interests, legislation is becoming in every legislative body in the world often rather a positive hindrance than a help to healthy progress, and a sapper rather than strengthener of public morals.\n\nWhat was needed was “reform in the legislative machinery,” some way to give “prompt, but also scientific expression to the popular will.”\n\nIt was a new theory of the separation of powers. Congress should not legislate alone; the complexity of the modern world demanded expert advice to guide lawmaking. From a hiding place for the President’s friends and cronies, the federal bureaucracy had to become a professionalized service recruiting the best young minds of its generation. Cooperation, not separation, was the order of the day. Ames, who had catalogued amendment proposals since the Founding, was impressed with the coherence, comprehensiveness, and daring of those coming out of the late nineteenth century. These proposals were ambitious and meliorist; they dared to reconsider the fundamentals of the Framers’ design. The Senate, grounded upon a fear of democracy, was “out of joint with our times” and should be filled by direct election. The Electoral College was malfunctioning; it was time to “brush away rubbish, and bring the election of the President to the people.” Congress, gridlocked and beholden to the private sector, was a weakling; why not replace it with a unicameral legislature subject to fewer procedural hurdles? Abolishing the presidential veto was another way to make sure good laws saw the light of day. Why not, following the British parliamentary system, partly fuse the Executive and Legislative Branches so that agency heads could lend their expertise to the lawmaking process? Or why not, along those lines, give the President’s Cabinet members the authority to propose legislation? Why not, for that matter, adopt a pure parliamentary system in America? Congress’s powers should be extended, too, to cover marriage, taxation, education, wills, real estate, and debt collection. The Vice President was a relic and should be replaced by a system of Cabinet officers that might provide the President with better advice. Judicial review was regressive; allowing the people a “recall” of judicial decisions would allow better judgment to prevail. Article V, too, was unnecessarily demanding; it should be amended to permit ratification of amendments by just half the states.\n\nSome historians call these reformers the “Best Men,” a term conveying their high status as men of “breeding and intelligence, of taste and substance,” as well as a certain smugness and consequent distrust of the “people,” whose encroachment into politics they feared.\n\nStill, Progressive groups were far from hermetic, however, and many educated liberal reformers had strongly populist convictions. As a wave of state constitutions adopted tools of direct democracy in the late nineteenth century, some intellectuals celebrated the prospect of popular government breaking away from “the old classification of governmental functions into legislative, executive, and judicial” and towards a democracy that recognized the lawmaking power of “the electorate as an organic part of the government.”\n\nMany Progressives agreed that a new, purer form of democracy was in the making. For this, they turned to America’s “laboratories of democracy,” the states.\n\n3. The Popular Democrats: State Reformers, Radicals, and Popular Sovereignty\n\nIt is a curious fact that, despite America’s prevailing constitutional conservatism, for much of the nation’s history Americans have fixated on the Jeffersonian ideal of popular sovereignty. Jefferson himself held a deep contempt for those who looked at constitutions “with sanctimonious reverence and deem[ed] them like the ark of the covenant, too sacred to be touched,” and he famously proposed a constitution for the Commonwealth of Virginia that would expire every nineteen years, automatically triggering a constitutional convention. “[N]o society can make a perpetual constitution, or even a perpetual law,” Jefferson wrote to his friend James Madison in 1789.\n\nFrom August 5th to August 7th, 1912, Progressives of different stripes convened in Chicago to enunciate a declaration of principles under which to make a run for the presidency. That Declaration began as follows:\n\nWe hold with Thomas Jefferson and Abraham Lincoln that the people are the masters of their Constitution, to fulfill its purposes and to safeguard it from those who, by perversion of its intent, would convert it into an instrument of injustice. In accordance with the needs of each generation the people must use their sovereign powers to establish and maintain equal opportunity and industrial justice, to secure which this Government was founded and without which no republic can endure.\n\nStrict constructionism, distrust of the judiciary, the invocation of the “needs of every generation,” the call for regular constitutional change to maintain citizen equality—it was vintage Jefferson, minus the part about “industrial justice.” From today’s perspective, it seems terribly radical, terribly old-fashioned, or possibly both. Yet during the Progressive Era, when constitutional criticism was pervasive and faith in a “pure” American democracy was at a peak, Jefferson’s constitutionalism seemed a desirable—and achievable—ideal. One additional factor helped open the door for its resurgence: foreign borrowing.\n\nThe idea of the popular referendum had surfaced among the several states during the antimonopoly campaigns of the 1870s and 1880s as a way for the people to snatch back power from corporations and courts. But it was not until 1885, when A.V. Dicey published an article in the Nation advocating the Swiss referendum as a golden mean between American constitutional rigidity and British flexibility, that direct democracy became a fixation of reformers. Dicey’s article inspired a wave of American students who traveled to Europe in search of constitutional insights. Especially important were William McCracken, who published a series of articles in the 1890s extolling the Swiss model, and James W. Sullivan, whose 1892 book, Direct Legislation by the Citizenship Through the Initiative and Referendum, sold a “staggering” fifteen thousand copies. One of these was picked up by a bedridden William Simon U’Ren, a blacksmith-turned-miner, newspaper editor, lawyer, and Republican Party worker who was convalescing from a severe asthma attack. After reading Sullivan’s book, the former blacksmith decided to make it his life’s work to spread the “tools” of democracy—the initiative, recall, and referendum—in his home state of Oregon and elsewhere.\n\nIn 1914, the economist Frederick A. Cleveland joyously proclaimed that “[a] wave of organized democracy” was sweeping America “based on a broader intelligence and a more enlightened view of civic responsibility than ha[d] ever before obtained.” Not all the experimentations in constitution writing were so lofty: in much of the South, Reconstruction was quietly being dismantled by turn-of-the-century constitutional assemblies incorporating Jim Crow into their state charters. Many did so explicitly: in South Carolina, for instance, delegates announced the establishment of “white supremacy” as their main purpose in coming together to write. Similar motives led many other states to embrace constitutional amendments mandating literacy tests or property thresholds for voting: ten states did so between 1892 and 1914, including Connecticut, Maine, California, and New Hampshire.\n\nYet undeniably the states pioneered a form of democratic constitutionalism all their own. The Founders, conscious of the Articles of Confederation’s failure, had been anxious to establish a blueprint for government that would last well into the future. The authors of progressive state constitutions had a different view. They felt constitution writing for the twentieth century should apply “institutional knowledge and experience that was unavailable to the eighteenth-century founders,” and their highest ideals of constitutionalism were experimentation, adaptation, and continuous learning. As a delegate to the 1906 Oklahoma founding convention explained:\n\nTime . . . impairs constitutions as it does all things and if they be not amended and repaired to meet changed conditions, new questions, and the ever-altering situations of an enterprising and progressive people, there is an end to good government. . . . This and every other generation of a free people has its own peculiar problems to face in Constitution making. . . . We would be unworthy sons of worthy sires if we fail to meet and courageously solve the problems now pressing upon our people for solution.\n\nBetween 1867, when Maryland rewrote its constitution to expunge the vestiges of slavery, and 1912, when Arizona drafted a constitution so radical that President Taft vetoed the first draft, a total of twenty-five state constitutions were substantially revised or written from scratch. Some established new institutions like mine inspectors, departments of labor and agriculture, and regulatory commissions. Many featured long bills of new social and economic rights and sweeping powers for states to enforce them. A growing percentage were adopted by simple majority vote, and many were changed with frequency. The average lifespan of these constitutions was around twenty years and reformers tended to make alteration easier as the decades passed by measures like a bicameral legislative authorization followed by a majority of the popular vote, for instance.\n\nThese texts also favored a dizzying array of devices to make government more responsive to the popular will. By 1896, presidential candidate William Jennings Bryan had pushed the Democrats into endorsing the initiative and the recall, and in 1898, South Dakota became the first state to enact them into law. Oregon followed shortly after, in 1899. By 1914, some fifteen state constitutions had adopted the initiative, the referendum, or the recall. Other tools included direct election of representatives and senators, primary elections, proportional representation in the legislature, public hearings and open legislative sessions, greater oversight of administrative agencies, judicial election, and the recall of officers and judges, as well as of particular laws or judicial decisions.\n\nPopular democracy gradually trickled up to the national political arena, as state reformers like Robert La Follette, Jonathan Bourne, and Albert Beveridge seized seats in Congress and began to popularize innovations from back home like the “Oregon System.” In 1911, these reformers formed the breakaway National Progressive Republican League (NPRL) with an agenda modeled on Oregon’s popular democracy. Oregonians William S. U’Ren and Senator Jonathan Bourne had helped draft the group’s charter, which called for direct national primaries, direct senatorial elections, and the amendment of all state constitutions to give voters the initiative, referendum, and the recall. A year later, when the Progressive Party was formed out of a coalition of disgruntled Republican and Democratic politicians, as well as reformers from urban, religious, feminist, and academic circles, it was on a platform scripted off the NPRL charter. The Progressive Party platform advocated “such alterations in the fundamental law of the several States and of the United States as shall insure the representative character of the Government.” This included the national initiative, referendum, and recall; primaries for legislative and presidential elections; the direct election of senators; and the extension of Congress’s power over labor, economics, and public health “[u]p to the limit of the Constitution, and later by amendment of the Constitution, i[f] found necessary.” The Progressives also called for revision of Article V in orthodox Jeffersonian terms: “[B]elieving that a free people should have the power from time to time to amend their fundamental law so as to adapt it progressively to the changing needs of the people, [the Progressive Party] pledges itself to provide a more easy and expeditious method of amending the Federal Constitution.”\n\nBut if the constitutionalism of Jefferson carried the states, it was Madison’s constitution that would win out at the federal level. Since the late 1800s, many have described the Framers’ creation as “a machine that would go of itself,” a blueprint for government that, like the watch set in motion by its omnipotent creator, would run long into the future essentially unchanged. And, save for a few minor fixes during the twentieth century, essentially unchanged is what the Constitution has been, a fact often invoked to prove the Framers’ genius. In just a few short years, Americans would lose faith in the tenets of progressive formalism’s three varieties—faith in scientific truth to better mankind’s behavior, faith in the clarity of the word, and faith in the People to govern without mediation. We turn to that story here.\n\nIII. The Eclipse of Progressive Formalism\n\nOn the night of June 15, 1912, an incensed Theodore Roosevelt hopped off a train and headed to Chicago’s Orchestra Hall to address a frenzied crowd of 5,000. It was the night before the 1912 Republican National Convention, and rumors were going around that Republican bigwigs were planning to steal the nomination from Roosevelt. Since the days of Jacksonian democracy, presidential selection had been in the hands of string-pulling party bosses, but recently, states had begun experimenting with primary elections in an effort to give control to popular majorities. The year 1912 was the first in which these played any significant role: Roosevelt, who had all but swept the early state primaries between April and June 1912, came into the Republican National Convention the clear people’s choice. Knowing that the party bigwigs were against him, he made the scandalous and unprecedented decision to attend the convention in person, in an attempt to sway the decision with the force of his charisma. The night before the proceedings opened, Roosevelt warned his supporters to be vigilant over the “great moral issue” of counting delegates. He concluded in memorable fashion: “We stand at Armageddon, and we battle for the Lord!”\n\nThe 1912 presidential campaign was, in some ways, a battle for the nation’s soul. Not just a contest over the proper size of government, it was one of the few elections in American history to put a constitutional theory at stake. The four-way competition pitted the Republican Party incumbent, President Taft, against the Democrats’ Woodrow Wilson; Teddy Roosevelt, who had bolted the Republican Party to lead the Progressive ticket; and the charismatic Socialist reformer, Eugene Debs. Progressivism was on the agenda, with three out of four candidates supporting broad progressive principles, and formalism too, with three of four party platforms calling for one or more constitutional amendments. For progressive formalism, 1912 was both a high-water mark and an inflection point. Roosevelt, as a newly recast Progressive, had come to believe that progressive democracy required major structural alterations. Wilson, a rising star in the Democratic Party, embodied reformism with a pragmatic attitude toward the Constitution. Wilson’s victory over Roosevelt was a triumph for the political goals of the progressive movement. But for progressive formalism, it was the beginning of the end.\n\nThe man who wrote that, as President, he had vowed “to do all he could for the people, and not to content himself with the negative merit of keeping his talents undamaged in a napkin,” is not often, or easily, associated with legal formalism. In a now-famous address of December 12, 1906, Roosevelt’s Secretary of State, Elihu Root, promised supporters that if the public wanted something done, “sooner or later” certain “constructions of the Constitution” would be “found” to permit the government to do it. Theodore Roosevelt’s theory of the presidency as the “steward” of the nation contemplated an “undefined residuum of [executive] power” beyond the strict provisions of the law, as his erstwhile friend Taft later wrote, an implication many found troubling.\n\nRoosevelt was frequently accused of being a fair-weather Progressive, but after he left office in 1908, his political radicalism had only sharpened, and with it, his belief that the Constitution was fundamentally defective. On February 21, in a speech entitled “A Charter of Democracy,” Roosevelt set forth a progressive agenda calling for a popular recall aimed at both judges and judicial decisions. The purpose “of every American constitution,” insisted Roosevelt, “must be to obtain justice between man and man by means of genuine popular self-government.” If the Constitution could be used to block efforts to remedy injustice, “it is proof positive either that the Constitution needs immediate amendment or else that it is being wrongfully and improperly construed.” At the Progressive Party Convention in August 1912, Roosevelt proclaimed: “The people themselves must be the ultimate makers of their own constitution . . . .” Yet another stump speech saw Roosevelt propose the idea of a general recall “applied to everybody, including the President.” The remark prompted a horrified New York Times to report, “Roosevelt tonight exceeded the speed limit in radicalism.”\n\nFor his part, as a young man Woodrow Wilson had also been a staunch critic of the Constitution. On July 4, 1876, as a twenty-year-old student at the College of New Jersey (now Princeton University), Wilson wrote in his diary, “How much happier [America] would be if she had England’s form of government instead of this miserable delusion of a republic.” In an unpublished 1882 essay, “Government by Debate,” Wilson proposed two constitutional reforms to move the nation closer to a parliamentary form of government. First, the President should be made a symbolic head of state, serving an indefinite term to last on “good behavior,” though he would conserve a legislative veto and the power to appoint a Cabinet, which would sit on the floor of the House, initiating legislation and leading debate on bills, subject to Congress’s power to dissolve it if policy disagreement arose. Second, House members’ terms should be extended from two to six or eight years, but the President would have the power to dissolve the legislature early and call for new elections in case of gridlock. In just a few years, Wilson would come to view these positions, so earnestly held by his younger self, as childish. A man on a “mission of statesmanship” had to offer realistic solutions, not utopianism. Wilson’s thinking was surely swayed, too, by Harper Press’s refusal to publish his 1882 piece because its constitutional proposals were too radical. In fact, when a review of his 1885 book, Congressional Government, came out lavishing praise on Wilson for being a hardline constitutional critic in light of his earlier (unpublished) work, Wilson was furious that his past views had been aired.\n\nWilson the discontented youth was a far cry from the man who, in his 1908 Constitutional Government in the United States, praised the Constitution as a “thoroughly workable model” and its Framers for their “quick practical sagacity in respect of the actual structure of government.” Vestiges of the old Wilson remained: it was true that the “constitutional structure of the government [had] hampered and limited” the President’s action in important roles. But it did not entirely thwart it. Somehow, happily, “the definitions and prescriptions of our constitutional law, though conceived in the Newtonian spirit and upon the Newtonian principle,” were “sufficiently broad and elastic to allow for the play of life and circumstance.” In Wilson’s hands, the historicism and organicism of Oliver Wendell Holmes became a way to defang even the sharpest of constitutional critiques. Progressive democracy could now be reconciled with constitutional fidelity: if the Framers had not foreseen the development of an activist federal government, they had knowingly built an endlessly adaptable system—an evolving organism (following the metaphors of the day), not a machine.\n\nIf the Darwinian organism represented Wilson’s idea of the Constitution, the metaphor of the machine better describes what he saw as the President’s ideal constitutional role: the engine of the system. As a theorist, Wilson proved instrumental in constructing—and, as a politician, in bringing about—a presidential democracy built around the Chief Executive. No other national office could snap the Constitution out of its self-induced stupor: political parties were too parochial; courts too backward-looking; and Congress too slow, divided, and beholden to special interests. On the Wilsonian theory, “[o]nly the presidency had the national vision to articulate the public’s evolving interests, the political incentive to represent those interests in action, and the wherewithal to act upon them with dispatch.” His duty was to keep national opinion mobilized behind great public purposes and to overcome all of the obstacles in the path to their achievement: “If he rightly interpret the national thought and boldly insist upon it, he is irresistible; and the country never feels the zest of action so much as when its President is of such insight and calibre. Its instinct is for unified action, and it craves a single leader.” For Wilson and other Progressives like Croly and Beard, the modern president was an adaptation that rescued a “defective apparatus” by allowing popular energy to course through it, “breaking through the constitutional form.”\n\nBy the time Woodrow Wilson and Teddy Roosevelt confronted each other in 1912, the two had switched places in their constitutional thought. Wilson traveled from critic to apologist thanks to the magic formula of realism. Roosevelt, by contrast, evolved from a loose constructionist to a progressive formalist on the strength of his growing commitment to “pure democracy,” which he now viewed as impossible under the existing Constitution. These competing views of the Constitution came to a head in the 1912 campaign. These were not second-order issues but front and center in each campaign. Progressives like Herbert Croly—who consulted for Roosevelt on the party agenda, even coining the phrase “New Nationalism”—devised a campaign that was formalist through and through, with pledges to revise senatorial elections; extend Congress’s regulatory power; establish the initiative, referendum, and recall at the national level; and amend Article V. The Socialists called for a similar slate of changes. The Democrats had far fewer ambitious proposals, though their platform did reflect a prevailing mood of tyrannophobia in calling for an amendment to limit the President to a single term. And although Wilson believed almost as ardently as Roosevelt in popular democracy oriented around strong executive leadership, the Democrats deliberately stopped short of calling for referenda on court decisions and the recall of all public officials. Ironically, it was probably Roosevelt’s own example as President that convinced Wilson to turn away from forms. What, after all, was T.R. but living proof that, through the power of the “bully pulpit,” the President could bridge the Constitution’s mechanical separations to lead party and nation, and become “as big a man as he can”?\n\nUnder the Wilson presidency, formalism became the road not taken. To be sure, Wilson presided over the greatest period of constitution-revising in American history after the Bill of Rights. But these victories had little to do with Wilson or his agenda. The Income Tax Amendment, approved by Congress in 1909, had been steered through Congress by Taft and heartland Progressives like Republican Senator Norris Brown of Nebraska. The campaign for direct senatorial election long predated Wilson’s presidency, and the Seventeenth Amendment itself was mostly the work of Republican reformers in Congress like Senators La Follette, Joseph Bristow (R-KS), and William Borah (R-ID) and Representative George Norris (R-NE). Prohibition split the Democrats, and Wilson personally never came out in favor of the proposal. As for women’s suffrage, Wilson had never endorsed it before World War I, leading many to suspect that he reluctantly took up the cause to bolster the appeal of his scheme for a League of Nations. Besides, as transformative as these amendments were, they did not reach the deep structural problems reformers had identified and decried decades before: divided government, deadlock, judicial supremacy, or the separation of legislative and administrative functions. Nor, obviously, did they deal with the problem of “usurpation,” or how to square twentieth-century structures and powers with an eighteenth-century Constitution.\n\nBy 1920, World War I and Progressivism were over, and across American politics, a palpable conservatism and disillusionment were settling in. The Republican candidate for President, Warren G. Harding, ran a sober campaign promising the nation “a return to normalcy.” En route to the Republican nomination, Harding defeated Senator Hiram Johnson of California, Theodore Roosevelt’s running mate in 1912 and a reminder of the Republican Party’s fading associations with Progressivism. Johnson had himself been courted by the Progressive Party to be its flagbearer after the death of T.R. in 1919, but he declined, choosing to seek the presidential nomination on the Republican ticket. In 1924, the indefatigable “Fighting Bob” La Follette dusted off the Progressive Party for one more presidential run in 1924, but by this time, the seventy-year-old seemed like an old knight tilting at windmills.\n\nHerbert Croly’s The New Republic had arrived on the scene in 1914, a highbrow voice for progressive ideas that became a bellwether of broader currents in the nation’s intellectual life and that turned its co-founders—Croly, Walter Weyl, and Walter Lippmann—into stars. Croly and the editorial pages of The New Republic had initially been cool towards Wilson, unsure whether Wilson’s progressivism was real or pretended, but Wilson’s active leadership and first-term legislative victories warmed the journal to him. By 1919, however, the unity of the Progressive front, such as it had been, was irreparably damaged. The Great War split isolationists like La Follette and William Jennings Bryan from interventionists (some said “warmongers”) like President Wilson and former President Roosevelt. Progressivism’s associations with dubious social experiments like eugenics and prohibition and the Wilson Administration’s zealous prosecution of radicals under the Sedition Act of 1918 soured many on social meliorism, and provoked a reorientation of attitudes away from big government in particular. This was particularly true for legal Progressives like Felix Frankfurter and Louis Brandeis whose thoughts on free speech were strongly shaped by the war, eventually coming to embrace broader civil protections against government than the earlier generation. Wilson’s failed League of Nations campaign was the final straw for many onetime supporters. Under the spell of his illusions, Lippmann wrote, President Wilson “had lost his grip on America.” Frankfurter, in a letter to Lippmann, was even more cutting: Wilson and his advisors “were the naïvest children in the world.” The Progressive coalition was fraying and losing its faith in democratic ideals.\n\nWalter Lippman’s own intellectual trajectory was dramatic, but by no means unrepresentative of a larger turn of intellectuals away from Progressivism. A younger Lippmann had galvanized the country with his 1914 Drift and Mastery, urging the nation to abandon its policy of aimless “drift,” hitch its political fortunes to the wisdom of scientific progress, and become master of its own destiny. Yet disappointments with public life—Wilson’s failed barnstorming tour of America to sell the nation on the League of Nations, the Sacco-Vanzetti case, among others—helped convince Lippmann of the fickleness of the public and ultimately, of the futility of democracy. By the time of his 1922 Public Opinion and his 1928 Phantom Public, whatever democratic spirit Lippmann had had in his youth had been stamped out, leaving behind only a cynical relativism and technocratic elitism.\n\nBrandeis and Frankfurter held onto their progressive commitments, but they too came to see the emphasis on forms as naïve. For all his democratic commitments, Brandeis never lost his faith in courts, his long and distinguished career a testament to his attempts to reconcile Supreme Court power and judicial review with legislative supremacy and a progressive agenda. Frankfurter remained a solid Progressive in his commitments, but he too turned away from reformist projects. For instance, although Frankfurter personally believed that the Due Process Clause should be written out of the Constitution, he believed that the slim chances of such an amendment made it a futile cause. Frankfurter remained a devoted supporter of La Follette’s campaign of 1924, notwithstanding its radical attacks on the Court and its solemn amendment proposals (including one to stop courts from voiding laws). Frankfurter still admired La Follette’s disinterestedness and egalitarianism, but increasingly, his thought was headed in another direction: away from populist plans to rewrite the Constitution and towards a jurisprudence that could reconcile judicial review with progressive societal ends.\n\nFor Croly, meanwhile, the decade after 1919 can be described as years of despair. Croly and The New Republic’s editors felt betrayed at Wilson’s capitulation to a Treaty of Versailles that virtually guaranteed “a Europe of wars and revolution and agony.” They confessed: “We were wrong. We hoped and lost.” Croly lost not only illusions, but many of his best friends too. Some perished in the influenza epidemic of 1919; Walter Weyl died of throat cancer; others, including Learned Hand and Walter Lippmann, grew estranged from Croly over growing philosophical differences. Croly remained a contributor to The New Republic until his death in 1930, but in spirit, the magazine was never the same. Croly had always been something of a slippery Progressive: his visions were grand, but elusive. Like the realists, Croly believed that public opinion could be vindicated through progressive judicial philosophies, but he also seemed to believe that the channels of government needed to be opened in more literal ways too. He vaguely gestured at the initiative, abolishment of the distinction between domestic and interstate commerce, a reorganization of the separation of powers, and amendment of Article V, but these ideas were scarcely developed in his books. Croly famously claimed that his thought combined the hard-edged realism of Alexander Hamilton with the democratic spirit of Thomas Jefferson, and compared to the “utopian” La Follette Republicans, Croly has gone down as a clear-eyed realist. Yet in reality, he was always better at envisioning ways to empower the State than at devising instruments for holding it accountable to the people. Stripped of the tools to channel the popular will, progressive democracy became as empty a formula as the social contract in J. Allen Smith’s telling. It seems ironic that the “utopian” progressive formalists were those who best understood this point.\n\nJust as the remnants of progressive formalism were tamed by Wilson’s reformist energy and realist m"
