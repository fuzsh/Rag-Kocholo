        "text": "Laurence Leamer has labored long and mightily on \"King of the Night\" - 2 1/2 years of research, including more than 700 interviews - but has given birth to little more than an enormously bloated mouse of a biography of Johnny Carson.\n\nNot that Leamer's swollen opus isn't stuffed with countless tempting tabloid tidbits, ranging from Johnny's \"blackout\" bouts with booze to his voracious appetite for gorgeous women.Of Carson's philandering, his first wife, Jody, confides: \"It would be late and he'd get drunk, and I guess he took whatever was handy.\"\n\nCarson refused to be interviewed, so the book's accusations are not rebutted.\n\nLeamer is a more judicious biographer than Albert Goldman or Kitty Kelley, two highly successful masters of character assassination guised as biography. Nonetheless, his \"King of the Night\" is sadly unbalanced without Carson's side of the story.\n\nAfter you have waded through 448 pages of Leamer's inside dirt, you won't have a better grasp of what makes Johnny run than what you can get in Kenneth Tynan's compact profile published in 1979 in his \"Show People.\"\n\nTynan was lucky enough to interview Carson face to face.\n\nLeamer has compiled an encyclopedia of the King of Comedy's sins, including meanness and a Scrooge-like stinginess.\n\nHe deals not only with Johnny's love affairs but also with his equally tangled financial affairs, including his involvement with an alleged Mafia-influenced bank.\n\nThe most appalling allegation is that the thrice-divorced and four-times-married Carson was a wife-beater. His first wife, Jody, claims he beat her and kept a cache of sadomasochistic magazines hidden in his closet.\n\nApparently, not even Johnny's closet is exempt from this bio's all-seeing eye.\n\nLeamer has dug up new details about Johnny's three earlier marriages, thanks to interviews with Jody Carson and Carson's third wife, Joanna.\n\nHe has also exhumed numerous details about Johnny's alleged extramarital affairs in interviews with a woman identified as Carson's longtime mistress, as well as with other ex-lovers, including the voluptuous Mamie Van Doren, a demi-sex goddess of B (as in bad) flicks.\n\n\"Van Doren necked and petted with Johnny on their midnight trysts. She says, however, that she never bestowed her ultimate honor, an award that she passed out elsewhere as often as the Girl Scouts give out cookies,\" Leamer says leeringly in his punchy prose spiked with tabloid tanginess.\n\nAmong those casting the first stones at Carson is the fine writer and notorious rumor-monger Truman Capote. Capote was a close friend of Carson's second wife, Joanne, and was their next-door neighbor.\n\n\"He (Carson) would holler and get drunk and start beating her (Joanne), and she would take refuge in my apartment,\" Capote says.\n\n(It is ironic that Capote, who died in 1984, is still able to wreak havoc with the rich and famous as books published after his death disclose more of his gift for the slashing, gossipy comment. Even from beyond the grave, his barbed tongue has wagged about Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis in C. David Heymann's \"A Woman Named Jackie\" - and now Carson.)\n\nWhat accounts for Carson's dark side?\n\nCapote and Joanne blame it on Johnny's mother. Capote: \"She was an absolute bitch.\" Joanne: \"His mother was selfish and cold.\"\n\nDonning his pop psychologist's thinking cap, Leamer points to Johnny's rigid, Midwest upbringing as the root of his troubled personal relationships and his inability to be himself except when basking in the glow of the television camera.\n\nDespite Leamer's monumental efforts in this hardcover, tabloid opus, the talk-show host's persona has eluded him."
