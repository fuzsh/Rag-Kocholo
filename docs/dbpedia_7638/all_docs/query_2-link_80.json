It started several\n\nyears ago with animated conversations about the need to update and enrich general understanding of the rapidly changing (and surprisingly continuous) state of US-Mexican relations. As enthusiasm mounted, we sought advice and ideas from prominent scholars in both Mexico and the United States. Our intent was to provoke dialogue and debate and to ensure balance and perspective. Eventually the scheme engaged collective commitments from four leading institutions: the Center for US-Mexican Studies at the University of California–San Diego, under the direction of Alberto Díaz-Cayeros; the Centro de Estudios Internacionales at El Colegio de México, directed by Gustavo Vega Canovas; El Colegio de la Frontera Norte in Tijuana, under its president Tonatiuh Guillén-López; and the Mexico Institute of the Woodrow Wilson Center in Washington, DC, led by Andrew Selee. The project took intellectual shape at a scholarly conference attended by more than twenty participants in July 2009 at the University of California–San Diego. We followed up with a panel discussion at the October 2010 Congress of the Latin American Studies Association in Toronto, Canada. The authors have been refining, revising, and winnowing their chapters ever since. We thank them all for their perseverance, dedication, and support. We also thank Lynne Rienner for her patience, wisdom, and encouragement. This book is the result of all these efforts. And it emerges just in time, as the United States and Mexico prepare to restart policy processes as the result of near-simultaneous presidential elections. As the book goes to press, Enrique Peña Nieto has been inaugurated as the next president of Mexico and Barack Obama has just won reelection as president of the United States. Whatever the outcome, both administrations will stand ready to engage with each other and chart the forward course of the bilateral relavii\n\nviii\n\nPreface\n\ntionship. While the goal of our work has been to examine long-term structural trends rather than advocate short-term policies of the moment, we hope that our contributions will prove useful to those in both countries—policymakers and activists, teachers and students, journalists and average citizens—who aspire to improve the quality, depth, and consequences of the US-Mexico partnership. —Peter H. Smith Andrew Selee\n\n1 Challenges of Partnership Andrew Selee and Peter H. Smith\n\nThe relationship between the United States and Mexico presents\n\nenduring puzzles. It is of great importance to both countries, but it receives lopsided attention—not enough in the United States, sometimes too much in Mexico. Economic cooperation and joint endeavors frequently give rise to mutual suspicion and distrust. Intensive informal exchanges often take place outside the framework of the law. Soothing diplomatic communications mask underlying tensions and occasionally prevent substantive progress in bilateral policy. Issues of inherent complexity are shrouded in oversimplification. We are neighbors but not always friends. What can account for such anomalies? In this book we seek to unravel such puzzles within a contemporary context of accelerating political and global change. Over the past decade or so, the advent of democracy has dramatically transformed the landscape of Mexican politics. The terrorist attacks of 9/11 have altered geopolitical priorities for the United States. The rise of China and other countries has reshaped the global economy and the prevailing world order. Each of these processes—plus an upsurge in drug-related violence, the polarization of US politics, and the onset of global financial crises— has led to further complications in the bilateral relationship. How have the two countries responded to these developments? Have they become more adept at working together? Have they developed institutional mechanisms for achieving genuine cooperation? If there exists a binational “partnership,” as public officials are wont to proclaim, how effective has it been? Can it be strengthened? 1\n\n2\n\nMexico and the United States\n\nAt the heart of this book is the central question of whether the United States and Mexico can improve their ability to manage shared challenges. On one hand, this is a question about how well the two governments cooperate on issues of mutual concern. On the other hand, it is a question of how the two societies are coming to terms with each other through multiple encounters in the worlds of business, politics, and everyday life. We look for patterns in official policy and public opinion that shed light on the degree to which cooperation and mutual understanding are possible in a highly asymmetrical but deeply interdependent relationship. We begin with a normative assumption that cooperation is preferable to conflict, especially between democratic neighbors sharing deep economic, social, and cultural ties. At the same time, we recognize that multiple forces within the bilateral relationship can pull in divergent directions. Cooperation could well emerge from the perception of mutual threats from external forces or from a hardheaded calculation that engagement can produce positive-sum benefits for both countries. With respect to some issue areas, however, policymakers and citizens may perceive such broad differences in national interests that engagement would yield a zero-sum or negative-sum result. This has sometimes been the case in debates about migration and economic integration. Understanding the factors that underlie cooperation and conflict is a central goal of this volume. Beyond concerns about policy process, we seek to focus attention on policy content. Have the United States and Mexico succeeded in forging optimal policies? Have they established “best practices” or settled instead for lowest-common-denominator forms of compromise? We suspect that the latter is too often the case, and for this reason we present a broad range of policy options at the end of this book. Our intention here is to stimulate constructive debate and, in the best of worlds, to help lay the intellectual foundations for lasting improvements in bilateral policy.\n\nWhat’s New? Changing Interpretations of US-Mexico Relations This volume builds upon a rich tradition of scholarly literature on USMexican relations.1 Over time, academic studies have shifted from an emphasis on asymmetry and dependence to a greater focus on the management of interdependence and the multiple issues, actors, and points of engagement across the border. Yet at present there exists no comprehen-\n\nChallenges of Partnership\n\n3\n\nsive and up-to-date book to account for the impacts of democratization in Mexico, the terrorist attacks of 9/11, and seismic upheavals in the world economy and geopolitical order.2 Debt and Dependency\n\nA generation ago, scholarly concerns about US-Mexican relations reflected two factors: the debt crisis of the 1980s, which inflicted serious socioeconomic costs upon Mexico, and the prevalence of “dependency theory” in social science. These preoccupations often came together in emphases on asymmetries of power and latent societal incompatibilities. A further sense of conflict derived from foreign-policy differences over the socialist regime in Cuba and civil wars in Central America. Characteristic publications of that era sought to comprehend the paradoxical underpinnings of an increasingly close, but still quite distant, relationship between the two countries.3 Broadly speaking, they reveal a notable difference between Mexican authors, who emphasized asymmetry in the relationship, and US authors, who focused instead on the notion of “interdependence.” Mexico’s then recently discovered oil wealth was seen as a key element in growing ties between the two countries. Only one prominent work at this time, by economist Sidney Weintraub, suggested the desirability of free trade with Mexico; most US analysts saw this as unlikely, and most Mexican analysts saw it as undesirable.4 A major interpretive study by Mexican scholars Josefina Vázquez and Lorenzo Meyer sought to explain how history had shaped the bilateral relationship, especially its inequalities, and how this development conditioned attitudes on both sides of the border. As they state at the outset, “Viewed from the north of the Rio Grande, the relationship between Mexico and the United States is one of interdependence. But viewed from the south of the same river—Mexicans call it the Río Bravo—the relationship with the United States is one of dependence.”5 Vázquez and Meyer go on to address the internal dynamics within each country that led to the divergence in their economic and political fortunes and the ways that conflicts created markedly different views of the relationship. Later in the 1980s, the Bilateral Commission on the Future of United States–Mexican Relations produced a book-length policy report plus a five-volume series of background papers by academic experts from both countries. A central premise of this project was that the US-Mexico relationship was becoming increasingly interdependent, with policymaking driven by “intermestic” factors (i.e., simultaneously international and domestic). One of the contributors, the late Carlos Rico, summarized the\n\n4\n\nMexico and the United States\n\nrelationship as one of “complex interdependent asymmetry.”6 This interpretation remains surprisingly pertinent even today. Tension formed a persistent theme in writings of this time. In his aptly titled book Distant Neighbors, journalist Alan Riding sought to explain the “essence” of Mexico through an analysis of politics and social life. And in Limits to Friendship, Robert Pastor and Jorge Castañeda exposed everyday obstacles to mutual understanding—ranging from elementary-school curricula to foreign-policy formulations.7 Both works concluded that fundamental differences in cultural attitudes and historical experiences would complicate mutual understanding and pose long-term challenges for productive engagement. Focusing on NAFTA\n\nThe 1990s witnessed a remarkable shift in emphasis from conflict to cooperation—in light of partial relief from the debt crisis, the ending of the Cold War, and, especially, the signing of the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), which joined Mexico together with Canada and the United States. Formally implemented in 1994, the treaty represented a calculated decision by President Carlos Salinas de Gortari that only such an agreement could spark investor confidence and stimulate sustained growth. NAFTA has generated continuing debates about its consequences, economic and political, and has stimulated competing strands in the scholarly literature.8 One current, associated mostly with economists, tended to praise the agreement and emphasize its predicted long-term benefits to participating countries. Especially prominent in policymaking circles were the writings of Gary Hufbauer and Jeffrey Schott, who offered econometric projections about the societal benefits of NAFTA.9 Mainstream views throughout the 1990s reflected underlying optimism about the conceptual origins and economic consequences of the treaty.10 There were dissident voices as well. US organized labor denounced what it saw as a loss of American jobs, while Mexican nationalists decried what they saw as a loss of sovereignty. Among social scientists, John Audley and Eduardo Zepeda and their respective associates provided skeptical assessments of NAFTA’s economic impact on Mexico and the United States.11 A thoughtful critique from a Canadian perspective raised concerns with how NAFTA was reshaping the internal workings of the three countries and called for a modified, low-key North American agenda.12 Political discussion focused on two central issues, democratization and management of the bilateral relationship. Convivial relations between\n\nChallenges of Partnership\n\n5\n\nnational leaders (e.g., Bill Clinton and Ernesto Zedillo) sparked interest in the idea of societal and cultural convergence. Indeed, a multiauthored study of large-scale public opinion surveys suggested that fundamental values in the three societies were trending in a common direction, a socalled North American trajectory in favor of democracy and tolerance.13 As both cause and consequence, NAFTA could thus be interpreted as a logical expression of this structural development.14 Fundamental debates centered on the role of NAFTA in Mexico’s democratic transformation. The treaty took effect in the early 1990s and Mexico held a democratic election by the end of the decade: advocates perceived clear and self-evident support for a causal connection between freer trade and freer politics. Other analysts dissected the inherent ambiguity in NAFTA’s political orientation and stressed instead the importance of domestic factors behind Mexico’s democratization.15 From the present standpoint, a general consensus appears to regard domestic forces as predominant, while acknowledging that NAFTA had a marginal (but positive) effect on the trend toward democracy. Additional controversy mounted over NAFTA’s impact on the bilateral relationship and, more generally, on Mexican foreign policy. As Ambassador John Negroponte wrote in a now famous cable to the US State Department in the midst of negotiations over NAFTA, “Mexico is in the process of changing the substance and image of its foreign policy. It has switched from an ideological, nationalistic and protectionist approach to a pragmatic, outreaching and competitive view of world affairs. . . . The proposal for an FTA [free trade agreement] is in a way the capstone of these new policy approaches. From a foreign policy perspective, an FTA would institutionalize acceptance of a North American orientation to Mexico’s foreign relations.”16 Would NAFTA oblige Mexico to provide unstinting support for US foreign policy? Not entirely. Guadalupe González González has analyzed Mexico’s changing location in the global political order and highlighted the greater pragmatism of Mexican foreign policy, its shift toward economic diplomacy, and the acceptance of international institutional constraints on traditional notions of sovereignty. These changes both drove and resulted from Mexico’s greater emphasis on economic ties with the United States. Lorenzo Meyer has looked anew at the origins of Mexico’s defensive nationalism and suggested that Mexico may be better off being more proactive in its relationship with the neighbor to the north, as long as it takes into account the underlying power differentials. 17 Sidney Weintraub, meanwhile, has argued that Mexicans have often gained the upper hand in the bilateral relationship by taking advantage of Washington’s preoccupa-\n\n6\n\nMexico and the United States\n\ntions with distant points on the globe.18 Notwithstanding significant differences in nuance, these authors suggest that Mexico may hardly be powerless in the face of its large neighbor to the north. The increased engagement between political leaders, the expansion of trade, and the rhetoric of partnership led analysts to reassess how far apart the two countries really were. Perhaps the most significant study from this era was The United States and Mexico, by Jorge Domínguez and Rafael Fernández de Castro, who argued that increasing institutionalization was structuring the US-Mexico relationship in new ways and influencing a broad swath of issues. Alterations in the international context were “differentially mediated through the bilateral institutions that were created in the 1990s,” in their estimation, with conspicuous impacts on economic policy but less on public security and cross-border migration.19 In a comparable way, Clint Smith observed that the relationship was coming together, notwithstanding the inertia of asymmetrical and highly divergent histories.20 A central theme concerned the ways that a democratic Mexico might reposition itself in the global political order, and in its relationship to the United States. Recent writings have generally assumed that asymmetry matters, but that Mexico is able to hold its own in shaping the course of bilateral decisions. Major studies of foreign policy by Olga Pellicer, Luis Herrera-Lasso, Gustavo Vega, and others have tried to situate the country’s relationship with the United States within a framework of proactive foreign policy.21 These analysts share a basic conviction that a more assertive foreign policy vis-à-vis the United States is useful and important, while they also express reservations about Mexico’s capacity to realize this potential in light of existing asymmetries and, in some cases, mismanagement of the foreign-policy agenda. Aftermaths: NAFTA and 9/11\n\nSince the turn of the century, scholarly efforts have tended to focus not on the relationship in general but on specific issue areas.22 Migration has formed a central axis in the academic literature. Binational studies proposed serious policy options for the two governments in 2001. As a new decade began, a seminal book by Douglas Massey, Jorge Durand, and Nolan Malone helped provide a theoretically based exploration of migration patterns and underlying forces at work.23 Additional studies analyzed trends in migration at the state level in Mexico.24 Others have looked at US immigration patterns, Mexican migration policy, and the politics of\n\nChallenges of Partnership\n\n7\n\nremittances.25 Journalists have written compelling accounts of the migration process itself and its impacts on communities along the border. The diversification of participants in bilateral relations (and in Mexican politics) has led to a new focus on nongovernmental organizations and on citizens in general. Sergio Aguayo, in 2005, produced a comprehensive almanac that tracks everything from trade and bilateral aid to Mexican citizens residing in the United States.26 Other recent books have focused on the increasing roles of civil society, immigrant organizations, and cross-border journalism.27 Reflecting these developments, the new millennium has witnessed a surge in studies of public opinion. Andrew Selee has assessed the political impact of citizen perceptions in the two counties.28 Extensive surveys have shed innovative light on evolving attitudes in Mexico toward the United States. According to studies by Guadalupe González González, Alejandro Moreno, and others, Mexican citizens have become remarkably pragmatic in their views of American society and processes of bilateral integration, while expressing suspicion about the motives and actions of the US government.29 There has emerged a burgeoning literature on the US-Mexico border and surrounding areas. Joan Anderson and James Gerber have explored the social and economic challenges faced by border communities, while other work has portrayed the border region as a microcosm of the overall USMexico relationship.30 Peter Andreas has challenged the notion that the US government can close the shared border without producing perverse effects for both countries.31 Journalists have chronicled day-to-day aspects of border life and underlying conflicts. From the Mexican side, Carlos González Herrera has produced a study of Ciudad Juárez and its links to El Paso.32 Extensive violence and organized criminal activity have spawned a growing literature on public safety and prospects for bilateral cooperation. John Bailey and his collaborators have analyzed the collapse of traditional means of protecting public security and the challenge of building institutions to uphold the rule of rule of law. 33 Raúl Benítez Manaut and colleagues have focused on the need for US cooperation against arms trafficking and money laundering and in support of law enforcement.34 In a similar vein, another recent study points to significant challenges to the implementation of collaborative bilateral policies against organized criminal violence.35 Various authors have urged the United States to intensify efforts to help Mexico strengthen law enforcement and judicial institutions,36 while a series of articles in Foreign Affairs has suggested alternative strategies for curbing drug trafficking and drug-related violence.37\n\n8\n\nMexico and the United States\n\nIn the meantime, there has been remarkably little attention to the USled “global war on terror” and its implications for the relationship with Mexico.38 This oversight might stem from the impression that the USMexican relationship responds to and reflects its own internal dynamics, apart from transformations and dislocations in a seemingly distant global arena. We think this view is understandable but incorrect. Surely, the tightening of US border policy has arisen in large part as a response to 9/11. Just as surely, the invasion of Iraq evoked a strong and negative reply from civil society in Mexico. Then, too, the US government’s antiterrorist campaign has drawn attention and resources away from Mexico (and Latin America in general). In short, the notion of “security” has come to mean different things on different sides of the border. It is essential to disentangle this concept. Generally speaking, the quantity and quality of writings on USMexican relations have vastly increased in recent years, while the range and variety of empirical research offers eloquent testimony to the depth of interdependence between the two countries. Even so, there is a conspicuous absence of efforts to tie together the different strands of inquiry in such a way as to provide a general assessment of where the relationship stands and is heading. That is where this book comes in.\n\nWhy This Book? Our volume seeks to reevaluate the state of US-Mexico relations in light of recent changes in the global political and economic order and the economy, politics, and society of the two countries. We begin with analyses of thematic patterns affecting the management of the relationship. In Chapter 2, Peter Smith compares diverse conceptions about the prevailing world order—unipolar, multipolar, flat, or pyramidal—that have determined the relative priority that US governments have (or have not) given to the bilateral relationship. Mexico has in contrast subscribed to a single and consistent view of global power arrangements, although analysts have derived differing recipes for policy alternatives. A central question is whether and how such different perceptions influence policy. Focusing on the bilateral arena, Andrew Selee and Alberto DíazCayeros in Chapter 3 explore underlying dynamics of the US-Mexican relationship, which they describe as intense, complex, and asymmetrical. Increased trade, migration, security challenges, and demographic concentrations in the border region have amplified the intensity of the relationship. At the same time, the number of participating actors—from federal\n\nChallenges of Partnership\n\n9\n\nagencies to state governments to nongovernmental organizations—has multiplied significantly, making the relationship increasingly complex and multifaceted. Asymmetry persists between the two countries. While US priorities tend to provide the overall framework for what is possible, however, Mexico can often shape the content of specific items on the bilateral agenda. In Chapter 4, John Bailey and Tonatiuh Guillén-López address policy processes in the two countries by exploring the changing balance between multiple “policy baskets” in bilateral affairs. Each of the baskets has different constituencies within the two governments and different networks within society at large. The authors show how policymaking has become focused on the border region, where all of the baskets come together, and they call for better balance in the relative importance of policy priorities. The second section of our volume examines specific issue areas that have dominated the bilateral agenda in recent years—economic integration, drug trafficking, cross-border migration, and environmental protection. The intent is to understand how the structural dynamics of the relationship play out in day-to-day interactions in these different areas. In each case, contributors evaluate the effectiveness of existing channels for resolving conflicts and developing creative solutions. In Chapter 5, Robert Blecker and Gerardo Esquivel examine the causes and consequences of economic integration. Contrary to much conventional wisdom, they find that NAFTA has done little if anything to promote structural development or reduce inequality between the two economies. National governments have failed to adopt complementary policies to promote education, improve infrastructure, or invest in lessdeveloped areas. David FitzGerald and Rafael Alarcón then provide a detailed analysis of demographic flows between the two countries and argue that prevailing US migration law is out of line with laws of supply and demand for labor. They demonstrate that current US efforts to “seal the border” have not only failed to accomplish their goals but also generated perverse and harmful effects, while Mexico’s recent tendency to overlook the issue has wasted political opportunities for change. Long-term solutions lie in changing US policies and in supporting international agreements that seek a more equitable, fair, and efficient management of the migration process. On the subject of environmental protection, Roberto SánchezRodríguez and Stephen Mumme describe the growth of a well-developed matrix of binational institutions that seek to harness cooperation across the border—including the North American Development Bank (NADB), the Border Environment Cooperation Commission (BECC), and the Inter-\n\n10\n\nMexico and the United States\n\nnational Boundary and Water Commission (IBWC). And yet, as the authors show, future problems in border communities will far outpace existing structures and require a rethinking of the current institutional architecture. Turning to illicit economies in Chapter 8, Luis Astorga and David Shirk trace the rise of organized criminal groups in Mexico that are linked to the trafficking of drugs to the United States. They highlight shifts in the US market, resulting from changing policies and consumption patterns, and shifts in Mexican politics, within the context of democratization. The authors emphasize the need for more robust law enforcement, stronger institutions, and imaginative reconception of the idea of “war on drugs.” In conclusion, Smith and Selee distill and present a range of policy alternatives derived from chapters in the book. The goals are twofold: to outline the intellectual foundations of current debates, and to offer productive suggestions to policymaking communities in the two countries. In sum, our book purports to make a variety of contributions to current understanding of US-Mexican relations: • by placing the relationship within the context of a rapidly changing world order • by identifying underlying dynamics that drive the relationship and its policy processes • by taking a comprehensive view of issues and themes and thus enabling a focus on interconnections between them • by identifying strengths and weaknesses in the management of the relationship • and by offering realistic policy recommendations for both the US and Mexican governments that could provide a new framework for future management of the relationship. We are looking for ways to improve the content of bilateral cooperation. We believe that partnership can be consistent with the preservation of sovereignty and national identity. We advocate practical policies that can meet outside threats, produce positive-sum outcomes, and enhance the security and welfare of citizens in both societies.\n\nNotes 1.

Smith\n\nForeign policies derive from perceptions of power. As nations\n\ndesign long-term approaches toward the world—“grand strategies,” in the argot of international relations—they continually assess and reassess the positions of adversaries and allies alike. The key question concerns the distribution (or stratification) of power: who’s at the top, who’s at the bottom, and who is in between. Stronger nations concentrate upon the interests and postures of their rivals; weaker nations look for ways to protect their sovereignty and maximize room for maneuver, often (but not always) through networks of alliances. Depending upon the structure of power, some situations invite assertive unilateralism; others promote tactical balancing or multilateral cooperation. At bottom, these perceptions involve views not only of each other, but also of the self and of the world at large. As the United States and Mexico confront the post-9/11 world, questions arise regarding their bilateral relationship: How do they see each other? How do Americans and Mexicans understand the world order? What importance do they attach to the bilateral relationship? In blunt language, what do they want from each other and why? This chapter addresses such questions by analyzing contemporary views and debates within the United States and Mexico. I take a qualitative approach: the goal is to understand the substantive content of prevailing interpretations, rather than to quantify trends in public opinion. This is not a review of academic literature. On the contrary, my intent is to examine prevalent ideas within the public domains (or “public spheres”) 13\n\n14\n\nMexico and the United States\n\nin both nations. The chapter thus seeks to explore predominant outlooks of “political classes” and policymaking communities (including the media and business circles as well as academia and officialdom). I am casting broad nets. The discussion unfolds on two levels. One refers to what is really taking place—what we, as scholars and social scientists, see as the actual structure of the world order. For want of a better term, this might be called an “objective” assessment. The second level refers to judgments made by political actors—what they think is happening, regardless of the accuracy of their outlook. We might classify such opinions as “subjective.” (This vocabulary might well seem biased and self-serving; with due and appropriate caveats, it is presented here as a kind of shorthand.) Whether or not the views of political actors comply with empirical reality, they furnish the foundations and frameworks for practical policy decisions. Indeed, one of my central arguments is that US assessments of Mexico—and Mexican assessments of the United States—emerge from their respective views about the world at large. A key question therefore concerns the extent to which the bilateral relationship is seen to serve national interests of the two countries and how it might fit within their overall grand strategies. In a basic sense, this is a matter of “framing.” How do US and Mexican analysts understand the binational relationship? What are the predominant prisms at work? This approach contains a corollary thesis: the stronger the conceptual frame, the more coherent the practical policy. Decisions taken within a widely shared and intellectually consistent worldview are likely to be mutually compatible and reinforcing; decisions taken without a common framework are likely to be based on narrow interests, ad hoc considerations, or bureaucratic imperatives. Grand strategies give shape and purpose to substantive policies. Otherwise, inconsistency reigns.\n\nDimensions of Power Views of the world order reflect perceptions of the distribution of power— which brings up the question of power itself. We might begin with the still-classic formulation of Robert Dahl, who defined power as a relationship: “A has power over B to the extent that he can get B to do something that B would not otherwise do.”1 This involves not only the use or threat of force but rational calculation of self-interest. Power is relational, situational, and changeable. Classic resources include demographic size, economic wealth, military prowess, and technological achievement.\n\nGlobal Scenarios and Bilateral Priorities\n\n15\n\nIn scholarly work on international relations, power is commonly understood to have two basic dimensions—geopolitical (ultimately based on military strength) and geoeconomic (derived from economic capacity). These broad categories often interact and overlap. Security interests are typically advanced by governmental bureaucracies; in capitalist societies, economic interests usually represent the goals of private sectors, which usually have direct or indirect representation within the apparatus of the state. While national interests are often cloaked in the uplifting idiom of moral purpose, it is the quest for geopolitical and geoeconomic advantage—not idealism—that provides the driving force behind foreign policy and international behavior. The study of power has produced a proliferation of undefined terms. Among them is the concept of hegemony, which means different things to different people. It has been used to indicate a virtual monopoly of power. It can refer to a self-appointed right to rule.2 And borrowing from the work of Antonio Gramsci, it can mean acceptance by actor B of the right to rule by actor A. In this sense, A’s power over B is seen as right and proper, as a suitable expression of values and realities. Domination and subordination thus become legitimate. Widespread acceptance of reality thus justifies asymmetry.3 Variations on this theme have crystallized in the notion of soft power. As framed by Joseph Nye, soft power represents the ability to achieve objectives not through threats, payments, or force, but through co-optation and attraction. Attraction, in turn, can lead to acquiescence. “When you can get others to admire your ideals and to want what you want, you do not have to spend as much on sticks and carrots to move them in your direction.” 4 Or, in Dahlian terms, if you are A and you can narrow the gap between your objectives and what B “would otherwise do,” then you don’t have to work so hard. Such benefits come from appreciation and admiration for the society as a whole—for its culture (“from Harvard to Hollywood” plus Michael Jordan), its political values (if it lives up to them), and its foreign policy (if seen as legitimate). The underlying proposition seems self-evident: the more positive the evaluation of a society, the more effective are its claims to leadership.\n\nThe Current Context What about the present time? Are we moving toward a new world order? How might it affect US diplomacy—and policies toward Mexico\n\n16\n\nMexico and the United States\n\nand the rest of Latin America? Despite awesome displays of military power in response to 9/11, the US antiterrorist campaign has produced ambiguous results—leaving the nation to confront an uncertain and perplexing future. Scholars, officials, and pundits have in this context produced competing interpretations of the shifting tectonics of international power. Here I focus on four prominent scenarios, taken (more or less) in chronological order of appearance—conceptions of the world as unipolar, multipolar, flat, or pyramidal. What does this have to do with Mexico? It could be argued that sweeping generalizations of this sort have little if any impact on the conduct of bilateral affairs. After all, it is often said, the US-Mexican connection is utterly unique. It obeys its own dynamics and is consequently divorced from grandiose global schemes. As explained in the volume introduction and in Chapter 3, the relationship has several distinctive features: interdependence, complexity, and asymmetry. The United States is bigger, stronger, and richer than Mexico—and is likely to remain so for the foreseeable future. Bargaining is thus an unequal process. Asymmetry also means that the United States might give relatively low priority to Mexico, imagining that it could always get (or take) what it wants, while Mexico gives high priority to the United States. But it does not mean that the United States always gets what it wants. Undue pressure can be counterproductive, and US officials sometimes yield ground in some areas in order to protect advantages in others. Even so, I contend that US policy toward Mexico unfolds within the context of global frameworks and perceived power relationships. During the Cold War, the United States was engaged in worldwide struggle against Soviet expansionism and international communism. Decisionmakers in Washington wanted two things from Mexico: political stability, so as not to require supervision or intervention, and reliable collaboration in the anticommunist crusade. This was part and parcel of a global grand strategy. In exchange for Mexican cooperation, US authorities essentially agreed to overlook antidemocratic features of the PRI regime and, more explicitly, to tolerate independent and anti-US stances in selected areas of foreign policy—such as diplomatic recognition of communist Cuba. If nationalist rhetoric was required to keep a fundamentally pro-US regime in power, that was part and parcel of a grand political bargain. The United States was getting what it wanted. What about the contemporary era? Are we moving toward a new world order? We now turn to global scenarios in the United States.\n\nGlobal Scenarios and Bilateral Priorities\n\n17\n\nThe World as Unipolar The ending of the Cold War led to the widespread view that the United States was and would remain a singular global hegemon.5 Often propounded by neoconservative thinkers, this interpretation of US primacy usually stresses three elements. One is the strength of the US economy, which, despite recent crises, remains the largest in the world. Second is the unmatched military power of the United States, derived from hightech weaponry and massive military spending. Third is its presumed moral superiority, in light of the national commitment to such highminded values as individual initiative, human rights, and democratic politics. The United States dominates the planet because it has the means and right to do so. The world is unipolar, and so it ought to be. This idea took explicit shape in 1990, when Charles Krauthammer proclaimed the arrival of a “unipolar moment.” Echoing US triumphalism over the defeat of the Soviet Union, Krauthammer’s opinion seemed almost self-evident: as the victor in the Cold War, the United States stood unchallenged and alone. Who could argue with such a proposition? The vagaries of the 1990s eventually prompted vigorous debate about the meaning of unipolarity. Suggesting that the world was moving from a hybrid “uni-multipolar” system toward a multipolar one, Samuel P. Huntington propounded a stringent definition: “A unipolar system would have one superpower, no significant major powers, and many minor powers. As a result, the superpower could effectively resolve important international issues alone, and no combination of other states would have the power to prevent it from doing so.” Since the United States was unable to resolve key international issues by itself, Huntington argued, the prevailing system could not be regarded as truly unipolar.6 Krauthammer returned to the subject in the aftermath of 9/11, arguing that US primacy represented “the dominance of a single power unlike anything ever seen.” This became all the more apparent in the wake of September 11—through awesome displays of US military power, the recuperative powers and resilience of American society, and the subsequent alignment of all major powers on the side of the United States. Serious threats came only from rogue states with weapons of mass destruction (WMDs), not from other great powers. “The new unilateralism defines American interests far beyond narrow self-defense,” Krauthammer observed. “In particular, it identifies two other major interests, both global: extending the peace by advancing democracy and\n\n18\n\nMexico and the United States\n\npreserving the peace by acting as a balancer of last resort.” Overall, the conclusion was inescapable: “The unipolar moment has become the unipolar era.”7 Indeed, the hegemonic presumption came to permeate George W. Bush’s foreign policy. Asserting unilateral power, ignoring the United Nations, and relying on a “coalition of the willing,” the president’s team decided to invade Iraq—on ultimately false pretenses—and unleashed years of bloodshed and violence. The Washington community became impervious to protests around the world. Poll after poll of citizens in other countries showed increasing disapproval of US policy and, eventually, disdain for the hypocrisy and imperfections of American society. Wanton displays of “hard power” were leading to sharp declines in “soft power.”8 And Mexico?\n\nSuch thinking paid scant attention to Mexico. For the most part, unipolar interpretations have focused on US relations with other great powers, especially Russia and China. Mexico appears mainly as an afterthought. A recent example has come from Robert Kagan, who argues that the United States has exerted an essentially benevolent influence on the world since the end of World War II—promoting democracy, liberal economics, and international peace. A central component of the standing of the United States has been “international acceptance of its power,” a factor leading to de facto hegemony.9 Notwithstanding the financial crises that erupted in 2008, the United States remains the most powerful nation in the world, still producing about one-quarter of global gross domestic product (GDP) and outspending the rest of the world on defense. And since other countries have encountered difficulties too, the United States has managed to retain its relative superiority.10 The United States can and should still lead the world. “In the end,” Kagan writes, “the decision is in the hands of the Americans. Decline, as Charles Krauthammer has observed, is a choice. It is not an inevitable fate—at least not yet.”11 Kagan never once refers to Mexico, and he barely mentions Latin America. Politics seems to be reserved for the big boys only. Emerging nations, developing nations, third-world nations—whatever you want to call them—do not shape the world order. They are policy takers not makers. They have to accept the outcomes of higher-level struggles and maneuverings.\n\nGlobal Scenarios and Bilateral Priorities\n\n19\n\nThere is an implicit corollary here. As the weaker neighbor of a hegemonic power, Mexico would have to abide by the dictates of the Colossus of the North—or pay an exorbitant price. This became apparent in the months after the terrorist attacks on New York and Washington and prior to the invasion of Iraq, as the Bush administration abruptly dropped its plans for migration reform, took umbrage with what was perceived as Vicente Fox’s tardy expression of sympathy over 9/11, and demanded the removal of Mexico’s ambassador to the United Nations. As though by a law of nature, US preferences could and should prevail. A more nuanced interpretation of unipolarity emerges from the recent work of Zbigniew Brzezinski, a widely respected academic and former national security adviser. Despite a visible shift of power from the West toward the East, from the Atlantic to the Pacific, Brzezinski asserts that “America’s role in the world will continue to be essential in the years to come. Indeed, the ongoing changes in the distribution of global power and mounting global strife make it all the more imperative that America not retreat into an ignorant garrison-state mentality or wallow in self-righteous cultural hedonism.” “America is still peerless,” he says, although it must rise to meet a range of challenges, domestic and international. Like Kagan, he concludes that it is a matter of national will: “The key to America’s future is thus in the hands of the American people.”12 In contrast to Kagan and others, Brzezinski stresses the importance of geographic location as a major asset for the United States. By this he means not only its “splendid isolation” from turbulence on other continents, but also the presence of a “good neighborhood”—marked by peaceful and cooperative relations with Canada and Mexico. Tranquility within the neighborhood thus enables the United States to project and sustain its power in other parts of the world.13 This insight provokes an extended meditation by Brzezinski on US relations with Mexico. With evident concern, he focuses on the likely consequences for Mexico of a serious decline in US power: A waning partnership between America and Mexico could precipitate regional and even international realignments. A reduction in Mexico’s democratic values, its economic power, and its political stability coupled with the dangers of drug cartel expansion would limit Mexico’s ability to become a regional leader with a proactive and positive agenda. This, in the end, could be the ultimate impact of American decline: a weaker, less stable, less economically viable and more anti-American Mexico unable to constructively compete with Brazil for cooperative regional leadership or to help promote stability in Central America.14\n\n20\n\nMexico and the United States\n\nAlternatively, one might have speculated on reverse cause and effect: the impact on the United States of Mexican decline, especially a descent into state failure. Even so, Brzezinski makes a fundamental point: Mexico provides a significant pillar for US power and it therefore deserves concomitant attention from policymakers. Mexico Beware!\n\nDebates about US “decline” and the changing world order have provoked a hyperbolic response from Thomas Barnett, a shrill and voluble voice in the America-first contingent of the national security community. Referring to skeptics of both left and right, he presents his thesis in colloquial terms: “Lately, we are being told that this is no longer our world. America is in decline, and the rest of the world has caught up to us. Wars may be won, but the peace belongs to others—we just have to get used to it. . . . [Yet] this is still America’s world, and if we have the will to step up to the plate, we can make things right—right now.” Indeed, the process of globalization testifies to the political and moral virtuosity of the United States. “This is a world of our making,” he declares; it is “fundamentally our design—a template of networks spreading, economies integrating, and states uniting. It’s so damn competitive merely because that’s our natural habitat; we don’t know how to make it any other way.” In effect, the rest of the world is finally beginning to emulate and incorporate the successful US model. “The United States isn’t coming to a bad end but a good beginning—our American System successfully projected upon the world.”15 Throughout most of the analysis, Barnett makes only passing reference to Mexico (as, for example, a lower-tier member of the G20, and as a source of petroleum). But as he contemplates the future, Barnett makes an absolutely stunning assertion: the United States should expand its territorial domain to include “fifteen to twenty” more states, mostly at the expense of Mexico. While the European Union continually expands its membership, the United States stands still: That the EU can add stars while our flag remains fixed at fifty is a sad reflection of our continued Cold War tendency to favor the status quo over system expansion, and to presume our world order is defined in political-military terms instead of economic liberty. Mexico has provided us with numerous new states in the past and it should do so in the future. The economic merger was forged with NAFTA; we simply refuse to admit the logic of complete acquisition. Would the price be too steep? If you want to keep the “old” America from becoming too\n\nGlobal Scenarios and Bilateral Priorities\n\n21\n\nHispanic, you’d better think about extending the “new” America farther southward, because global warming is going to exacerbate the northward flow beyond past expectations of sustainability, so we either pay soon or pay later.16\n\nThe facts and the logic of Barnett’s position seem utterly preposterous. The EU is an association of sovereign states, not a single nation; NAFTA does not provide any sort of blueprint for acquisition; it is unclear why or how the “old” America would protect itself from Hispanic influence by extending its borders southward; the reference to global warming (as a cause of northward migration?) is completely baffling; and he provides no plausible comparison of costs to be paid sooner rather than “later.” Still, the proposal stands in all its clarity. In the long run, Mexico as a sovereign nation does little to serve US national interests; as an opportunity for territorial and demographic expansion, however, Mexico provides a potential means for US empowerment. If this is what he means by “the American System,” let Mexicans beware!17\n\nThe World as Multipolar An alternative scenario posits the emergence of a multipolar world, an arrangement based on the existence (and coexistence) of independent and competitive bastions of power. Widely discussed during the 1990s, this view was temporarily eclipsed by the unilateralist tone of US policy after 9/11. Recent developments have testified to its continuing relevance, however, especially in light of shifting power alignments in the wake of the Bush administration’s “global war on terror.” The most articulate expression of this scenario has come from none other than Henry Kissinger, in his magisterial (and controversial) book Diplomacy. Writing in the early 1990s, just as other pundits were triumphantly proclaiming “the end of history” and near-permanent hegemony for the United States, Kissinger took note of emerging challenges to US economic supremacy and predicted an eventual decline in US military preeminence: The international system of the twenty-first century will be marked by a seeming contradiction: on the one hand, fragmentation; on the other, growing globalization. On the level of relations among states, the new order will be more like the European state system of the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries than the rigid patterns of the Cold War. It will con-\n\n22\n\nMexico and the United States\n\nsist of at least six major powers—the United States, Europe, China, Japan, Russia, and probably India—as well as a multiplicity of mediumsized and smaller countries.18\n\nOne senses here a trace of nostalgia: not only a prediction that multipolarity would in fact emerge, but also an underlying hope that this would come about. Ever the realist, Kissinger explained the workings of a multipolar system with dispassionate clarity. Its principal goal was to preserve an acceptable distribution of power among competing states; its method was not the prevention of conflict or war but the preservation of balance, stability, and moderation. The system prevailed in Europe prior to World War I and was subsequently displaced by the bipolar US-Soviet competition of the Cold War. By the 1990s, however, it was poised to make a comeback. As Kissinger made clear, multipolarity would pose a significant challenge to American society and its political establishment. “What is new about the emerging world order is that, for the first time, the United States can neither withdraw from the world nor dominate it. . . . One of the new necessities is that a world comprising several states of comparable strength must base its order on some concept of equilibrium—an idea with which the United States has never felt comfortable.”19 The forging of US foreign policy in a multipolar world would require unusual acumen, flexibility, understanding, and, ultimately, a revision of national mythology. The Mexican Connection\n\nNever regarded as a champion of third-world interests, Kissinger offered a remarkably upbeat prediction for Latin America, Mexico, and the hemispheric future. Together with NAFTA, the Enterprise Initiative for the Americas of George H. W. Bush represented to Kissinger the most innovative American policy toward Latin America in history. After a series of ups and downs, the Western Hemisphere seems on the verge of turning into a key element of a new and humane global order. A group of democratic nations has pledged itself to popular governments, market economies, and hemisphere-wide free trade [except Cuba]. . . . Emphasizing reciprocal obligations and cooperative action, the ultimate and dramatic goal is the creation of a free-trade area from Alaska to Cape Horn—a concept that, a short time ago, would have been considered hopelessly utopian.\n\nGlobal Scenarios and Bilateral Priorities\n\n23\n\nKissinger went on to spell out the geopolitical advantages of hemispheric solidarity in a multipolar world: A Western Hemisphere free-trade system—with NAFTA as the initial step—would give the Americas a commanding role no matter what happens. If the principles of the Uruguay Round of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) negotiated in 1993 in fact prevail, the Western Hemisphere will be a major participant in global economic growth. If discriminatory regional groupings predominate, the Western Hemisphere, with its vast market, will be able to compete effectively with other regional trading blocs; indeed, NAFTA is the most effective means to forestall such a contest or to prevail in it should it occur. By offering associate membership to nations outside the Western Hemisphere that are prepared to observe its principles, an expanded NAFTA could create incentives to abide by free trade and penalize nations insisting on more restrictive rules. In a world where America is often obliged to strike a balance between its values and its necessities, it has discovered that its ideals and its geopolitical objectives mesh substantially in the Western Hemisphere, where its aspirations originated and its first major foreign policy initiatives were conducted [emphasis added].20\n\nAs a founding member of NAFTA, Mexico would naturally become a key partner for the United States. In particular, its willingness to expand NAFTA to include other countries—even from outside the hemisphere— would provide a critical element in the creation and expansion of an economic and political bloc under US leadership. And this, in turn, would strengthen the US hand in dealing with competing power blocs around the globe. The multipolar vision thus gives considerable priority and place to Mexico. If, and as, the United States confronted rival blocs throughout the world—especially in Europe and Asia—Mexico would become an indispensable regional partner. It would strengthen the US hand in dealing with other blocs and could help pave the way toward the creation of a hemispheric grouping. In a multipolar world, Mexico would offer a key component of US grand strategy. But as Robert Kagan has argued, multipolarity might not prove to be a garden party. If the competition were purely geoeconomic, it might be peaceful enough; but if it were geopolitical, it might lead to violent conflict between powerful blocs. At least two of the great powers, China and Russia, have autocratic leadership—and expansionist tendencies. Control of the seas (and of space) could become theaters of war. Observing the contemporary presence of peace, Kagan notes: “The\n\n24\n\nMexico and the United States\n\ngreat powers today act in a restrained fashion not because they are inherently restrained but because their ambitions are checked by a stilldominant United States.” Parity is not a guarantor of peace. The key is US hegemony. “International order is not an evolution,” in Kagan’s words; “it is an imposition.”21\n\nThe World as Flat A currently popular view, most cogently presented by Thomas Friedman of the New York Times, is that the world is becoming “flat.” In other words, the forces of globalization have tended to level the playing field, especially in the economic arena, and this has revised prevailing structures of competition and power. In Friedman’s words, It is now possible for more people than ever to collaborate and compete in real time with more other people on more different kinds of work from more different corners of the planet and on a more equal footing than at any previous time in the history of the world—using computers, e-mail, fiber-optic networks, teleconferencing, and dynamic new software. . . . The playing field is not being leveled only in ways that draw in and superempower a whole new group of innovators. It’s being leveled in a way that draws in and superempowers a whole new group of angry, frustrated, and humiliated men and women.22\n\nThis is essentially a geoeconomic argument. This process has come about as a result of forces ranging from the end of the Cold War to the emergence of the Internet to economic outsourcing, offshoring, and the creation of transnational supply chains. Around the turn of the twenty-first century, Friedman writes, this collection of factors “started to converge and work together in ways that created a new, flatter, global playing field. . . . The merger of this new playing field for doing business with new ways of doing business was the second convergence, and it actually helped to flatten the world even further. Finally . . . a whole new group of people, several billion, in fact, walked out onto the playing field from China, India, and the former Soviet Empire.”23 In particular, this last development has led to unprecedented empowerment for non-Western, nonwhite peoples. Despite its inexorable (and ultimately desirable) qualities, geoeconomic globalization has created and accentuated glaring inequalities. While half the world is becoming “flat,” in Friedman’s idiom, the other half is not: this is the world of failed states, failed regions, and failed\n\nGlobal Scenarios and Bilateral Priorities\n\n25\n\nA Post-American World? Still another view of the emerging global arena has come from Fareed Zakaria, the noted author, columnist, and television personality who has posited the idea of a “post-American world.” Following the lead of his mentor, Samuel Huntington, Zakaria described the current system as “uni-multipolarity”—one having multiple significant powers but only one superpower: The United States remains by far the most powerful country but in a world with several other important great powers and with greater assertiveness and activity from all actors. This hybrid international system—more democratic, more dynamic, more open, more connected—is one we are likely to live with for several decades. It is easier to define what it is not than what it is, easier to describe the era that it is moving away from than the era it is moving toward—hence the post-American world. The United States occupies the top spot in the emerging system, but it is also the country that is most challenged by the new order. Most other powers will see their role in the world expand. That process is already underway. China and India are becoming bigger players in their neighborhoods and beyond. Russia has ended its post-Soviet accommodation and is becoming more forceful, even aggressive. Japan, though not a rising power, is now more willing to voice its views and positions to its neighbors. Europe acts on matters of trade and economics with immense strength and purpose. Brazil and Mexico are becoming more vocal on Latin American issues. South Africa has positioned itself as a leader of the African continent. All these countries are taking up more space in the international arena than they did before.

Even more dangerous is the borderline area between these two worlds, a zone of excessively “disempowered” and angry people who express their rage through ideological critiques of globalization and, more fatefully, through participation in terrorist movements.24 In consequence, the process of flattening presents a two-part challenge to the United States. One is economic and educational: the United\n\n26\n\nMexico and the United States\n\nStates must prepare itself (and its workforce) to meet new forms and sources of competition in the global marketplace. Countries like India and China are in fact poised to overcome US superiority in information technology. Second, the disparities resulting from uneven globalization give rise to political threats, especially in the form of antiglobalization ideologies and terrorist movements. Mexico Passé\n\nFriedman’s analysis poses dire implications for Mexico, especially in comparison with China. In the early 1990s, says Friedman, Mexico seemed perfectly positioned to thrive in a flattening world economy. It enjoyed three key advantages: proximity to the United States, membership in NAFTA, and a substantial supply of petroleum. But China had better intangibles, including a more coherent economic policy, a more efficient government bureaucracy, and a more responsive educational system. By 2003 China replaced Mexico as the number two exporter to the United States. The key issue here was not democracy versus authoritarianism, but the quality of leadership. According to Luis Rubio, “What NAFTA accomplished was to get Mexicans to think forward and outward instead of inward and backward. [But] NAFTA was seen [by its architects] as an end more than a beginning. It was seen as the conclusion of a process of political and economic reforms.” Added Friedman, “Mexico got itself on the right track with reform wholesale, but then, for a lot of tangible and intangible reasons, it just sat there and reform retail stalled. The more Mexico just sits there, the more it is going to get run over.”25 The implication is self-evident. While Mexico has squandered its advantages, the United States can find more willing and capable economic partners in other regions of the globe. Flattening has diminished the relative importance of territorial proximity. The flatter the world, the less important Mexico becomes to the United States.\n\nThe World as Pyramid A notably nuanced conception of the emerging world order has come from Leslie Gelb, the recently retired president of the Council on Foreign Relations and former columnist for the New York Times. The central goal of his book Power Rules is “to put power back into American power, to fit it to twenty-first-century realities and thus make it effective again . . . to restore\n\nGlobal Scenarios and Bilateral Priorities\n\n27\n\ncommon sense to the exercise of that power and the making of American foreign policy.” Along the way, Gelb abruptly dismisses competing notions about the world order—the world-is-flat thesis of Thomas Friedman, the triumphalist claims of Thomas Barnett, even the “postAmerican” viewpoint of Fareed Zakaria. Instead, he says, “Today’s world is neither flat nor nonpolar, but pyramidal: The United States stands alone at the pinnacle, with formidable and unique global powers of leadership, but not the power to dominate. Stacked below are many tiers of states.” A second level includes China, Japan, India, Russia, the United Kingdom, France, Germany, and, “just barely,” Brazil. These states together comprise “the Eight Principals, or simply The Eight. If Washington is the sole leader, they are the principals or managing directors of the global realm. . . . In many respects, they are more regional than global powers. But each possesses enough power to provide essential support to joint efforts by the United States and to block or seriously impede action by Washington.”26 Lower tiers play lesser roles. A third layer includes leading oil-andgas-producing states (from Saudi Arabia to Venezuela and Nigeria), which Gelb describes as “Enablers, helping to make things happen at home or abroad.” A fourth stratum consists of midlevel states “with mostly localized potential as Regional Players,” including Mexico along with Nigeria, South Africa, Pakistan, South Korea, and Taiwan. Still lower are the “Responsibles”—as many as fifty states (such as Chile) that “can mostly care for themselves and tend to their own needs, but don’t cut a lot of ice with the major powers. They generally neither make not submit to demands.” Beneath them are “the Bottom Dwellers or Problem States,” perhaps seventy-five nation-states that suffer varying degrees of political and economic disarray. Finally, as a separate category, there are the nonstate actors such as nongovernmental organizations (NGOs), international media, and international business. Given this situation, Gelb presents a straightforward proposal: governance of the world order should emerge from cooperation between Washington and The Eight. The United States may not be dominant, he says, but it is “indispensable.” With approval, he quotes Madeleine Albright: “We are the indispensable nation. We stand tall. We see further into the future.” The Eight also are indispensable. This condition of mutual indispensability thus requires “creating power coalitions of key countries to solve key problems that could not be solved or managed by any other means.”27 Countries beneath The Eight play subordinate roles. Oil states serve as Enablers, and Regional Players operate effectively only in local arenas. Below them are essentially self-protecting spectator nations or hapless sources of permanent trouble.\n\n28\n\nMexico and the United States\n\nPerils of Flattening The world can become flatter in one of two ways: either weaker countries gain ground on the stronger ones, or the stronger ones lose some of their power. As though to extend his general thesis, Friedman has pondered an imminent decline of US hegemony: In recent years, I have often said to European friends: So, you didn’t like a world of too much American power? See how you like a world of too little American power—because it is coming to a theater near you. Yes, America has gone from being the supreme victor of World War II, with guns and butter for all, to one of two superpowers during the cold war, to the indispensable nation after winning the cold war, to “The Frugal Superpower” of today. Get used to it. That’s our new nickname. American pacifists need not worry about any more “wars of choice.” We’re not doing that again. We can’t afford to invade Grenada today.\n\nThe key problem, according to Friedman, is the growing indebtedness of the US economy: When the world’s only superpower gets weighted down with this much debt—to itself and other nations—everyone will feel it. How? Hard to predict. But all I know is that the most unique and important feature of American foreign policy over the past century has been the degree to which American diplomats and naval, air and ground forces provided global public goods—from open seas to open trade and from containment to counterterrorism— that benefited many others besides us. U.S. power has been the key force maintaining global stability, and providing global governance, for the past 70 years. That role will not disappear, but it will almost certainly shrink.

In our perspective, one detail is telling: Mexico is barely mentioned anywhere. There is no suggestion that Mexico is especially important to the United States, or that the bilateral relationship is somehow “special,” or\n\nGlobal Scenarios and Bilateral Priorities\n\n29\n\nthat collaboration between Mexico City and Washington could be vital to the hemisphere. Indeed, cooperation with Brazil (one of The Eight) would make more sense than cultivation of a unique alliance with Mexico. Mexico is simply not high enough in the pyramid of power to deserve toplevel attention. In summary, the contemporary array of US worldviews leads to an unexpected conclusion. Among prevailing scenarios, the multipolar vision gives the greatest emphasis and importance to Mexico and US-Mexican relations. With the exception of Brzezinski, most of the alternative conceptions—of worlds that are flat, unipolar, or pyramidal—give precious little attention to Mexico and to the bilateral relationship. Implicitly or explicitly, other analyses regard Mexico as insufficiently powerful to serve as a valued ally of the United States; even as a neighbor, Mexico has become increasingly dispensable.\n\nViews from Mexico: A Nationalist Perspective The world looks different from Mexico. One notably articulate statement of the Mexican outlook has come from Lorenzo Meyer, a distinguished historian and public intellectual with a decidedly progressive stance.28 Areas outside the Western Hemisphere are not matters of central concern, Meyer has written. Instead, the principal focus concentrates on the United States. “From a political, military, economic or demographic perspective, the United States is equivalent to the world for Mexico.” Seen from below the Río Bravo, the world is unipolar. From this standpoint, US preeminence is likely to continue well into the foreseeable future, “regardless of possible alterations in the U.S. power position in the international system.” The rise or decline of BRIC nations (Brazil, Russia, India, and China) has little meaning for Mexico. The world at large might be changing shape, becoming flat or multipolar or whatever, but that does not affect the US-Mexican relationship. The dominant factor is asymmetry—that is, differentials in levels of power. Even more grating to Mexicans is the widespread US presumption that this asymmetry reflects moral superiority. “Under these conditions,” Meyer observes, “cooperation between unequal partners is difficult and Mexican attitudes of defensiveness and mistrust are understandable. Conflict and tension between the two neighbors are natural and inevitable.” This reality shapes Mexican views of the world. According to a recent survey, as Meyer reports, citizens of Mexico “have lost interest in the world. Instead the dominant tendencies are inward focus on the self\n\n30\n\nMexico and the United States\n\n(ensimismamiento), pessimism, and lack of confidence, especially in regard to the relationship to the United States.” Respondents show approval and admiration for nations of Europe and Asia, but do not see them as a serious counterpoise to the United States. The atmosphere is one of resignation. This lack of interest is regrettable: “[T]he evolution of the global role of the great power should be of great interest to Mexico. In practice, however, this theme attracts little interest from Mexican elites or from the general public.” Nationalist interpretations rely on history for evidence. Over the past two hundred years, in Meyer’s account, a key question for Mexican leadership has been how to deal with the United States. Early in the nineteenth century, conservatives sought to counterbalance US aggressiveness through ties to Europe (which led them to import a European monarch). Liberals placed their hopes in closer ties to the United States, but with strings attached: in subsequent decades, Porfirio Díaz, originally a liberal, managed to neutralize US power by encouraging British investment. After the Mexican Revolution (1910–1920), what became a “grand strategy” relied on the principle of nonintervention, while revolutionary nationalism exerted pressure to regain control of the national patrimony from foreign interests—land, banking, railroads, and petroleum. By the late 1930s, Mexico had made considerable advances in this area.29 After World War II, Mexican leaders hoped to transform the military alliance with the United States into a permanent relationship based on the Good Neighbor policy, especially the idea of nonintervention, but this proved to be impossible. US insistence on rigid opposition to (sometimes imaginary) threats from international communism or the Soviet Union established the defining framework for the Cold War period. It also led to flashpoints of tension—especially over US attempts to overthrow the Cuban Revolution, as well as interference in Guatemala, the Dominican Republic, and Central America. In keeping with the postrevolutionary ideology of nationalism, continues Meyer, Mexico opposed these actions as blatant violations of the norms of nonintervention. For the sake of selfprotection, however, Mexico often made tactical concessions to US demands.30 Subsequent leaders attempted to assert international status for Mexico as a “midlevel power,” largely as the result of large-scale petroleum discoveries in the mid-1970s. (“There are two kinds of countries in the world,” crowed President José López Portillo at one point, “Those that have oil and those that don’t. We have it.”) The petroleum windfall led to massive borrowing, which later provoked a crushing debt crisis in the 1980s. The nation suffered mightily throughout the “lost decade.”\n\nGlobal Scenarios and Bilateral Priorities\n\n31\n\nSeeking a path to economic recovery, Carlos Salinas decided to embrace the neoliberal reform program enshrined in the Washington Consensus—opening trade, privatizing state-owned assets, reducing the role of the state. NAFTA formed the capstone of this policy. For Mexico, in Meyer’s words, the agreement represented “a historic, fundamental change in the national project. Internally, it signified abandonment of the remaining shreds of revolutionary nationalism. Externally, it defined Mexico’s national interest not as upholding interdependence and distance from the United States, but as seeking the national future through systematic integration with the American economy.” Given the weight of this transaction, NAFTA became the principal project of the Salinas presidency “and everything else was subordinated to its achievement.”31 Mexico’s gradual process of political liberalization eventually led to the democratic election in 2000 of Vicente Fox, a panista conservative (representing the National Action Party, or PAN) who sought to strengthen relations with the United States. Partly toward this end, the Fox administration criticized human rights violations in Cuba and distanced itself from the incendiary rhetoric of Hugo Chávez in Venezuela. The hope was that, in return for these gestures, a grateful George W. Bush administration would respond constructively to Mexican proposals for immigration reform. These expectations were dashed in the wake of the 9/11 terrorist attacks, especially since Mexico failed to express the desired degree of international solidarity.32 The once-congenial personal relationship between Bush and Fox suddenly cooled and US foreign policy turned its attention to the “global war on terror.” Things later took a turn for the worse in 2003 when Mexico refused to endorse US demands in the UN Security Council for support for an invasion of Iraq. The relationship then went on hold. Elected to the presidency in 2006, Felipe Calderón of the PAN took advantage of linkages with Washington, especially in the war against drug trafficking. One hypothetical option might have been a variation on Plan Colombia, permitting a US military presence in exchange for large-scale aid, though in Meyer’s estimation such a policy would have been unacceptable to opposition political parties (both the Institutional Revolutionary Party [PRI] and the Party of the Democratic Revolution [PRD]) and to the Mexican public. Instead the country sought the 2007 Mérida Initiative, a multiyear commitment of US equipment and training for Mexico’s fight against drugs. Essentially his own proposal, Calderón justified the project on the basis of US responsibility for the consumption of illicit drugs and for the sale of weapons to organized criminal groups.\n\n32\n\nMexico and the United States\n\nFor Lorenzo Meyer, historical perspective thus yields an unmistakable truth: the presence and power of the United States have presented persisting challenges to Mexico’s political leadership. For nearly two centuries, the protection of sovereignty, independence, and autonomy has formed a central pillar in the nation’s foreign policy—for governments of center, right, and left. While Mexico has been preoccupied with the United States, however, US governments have focused only intermittently on Mexico. Paradoxically enough, as Andrew Selee and Alberto DíazCayeros point out in Chapter 3, this imbalance has given room for maneuver to Mexico, which has managed to offset part of the prevailing “asymmetry of power” with its corresponding “asymmetry of attention.” While the United States remains distracted by events around the world, Mexico can seek opportunities to promote its national interests on the bilateral agenda. Even so, in Meyer’s view, Mexican democracy under the PAN did not manage to unify the nation, reform the state, or achieve its long-term goals. In dealings with the United States, the nation has been hampered by political polarization and paralysis. Mexico finds itself in a bind: it needs the United States but also resents the United States. Ingrained distrust stems from bitter memories of US-Mexican conflicts since the attainment of independence. To forge a viable “grand strategy” toward the United States, according to this analysis, Mexico needs a strong political consensus. In Meyer’s view, the prospects are discouraging: The current inability of Mexico’s elites to reach agreement on the rules of the political game and on the means for promoting national development, together with the weakness of the economy and the exponential growth of violence and insecurity, have produced a situation in which Mexican foreign policy does not display the energy, the quality, and the clarity that it had in the past. Mexico today lacks the kind of clear and widely supported ideas that would be necessary for designing a longterm policy toward the United States and the world at large. The most that can be hoped for is to manage the existing relationship in such a way as to avoid crises that might endanger precarious institutional arrangements and obtain Washington’s support for dealing with immediate and urgent problems, such as the fight against organized crime.33\n\nIn short, Mexico needs to reinvent itself. It needs to regain strength, confidence, and unity of purpose. Until then, its relationship with the United States will remain ambiguous, contradictory, and beholden to asymmetries of power.\n\nGlobal Scenarios and Bilateral Priorities\n\n33\n\nViews from Mexico: Pragmatism and Promise This is not the only view in Mexico. An upbeat position has been articulated by Héctor Aguilar Camín and Jorge Castañeda, prominent intellectuals who joined forces to write of “a future for Mexico.”34 Looking ahead to the 2012 election, they declared that the time had come for Mexican society to make a choice, to redefine the national narrative, and to forge a new path for development. “Mexico is a prisoner of its past,” they began, despite the onset of democratization and economic change. “It is a country, one might say, with too much past and not enough future.” In broad-brush terms, the authors stress the need for a social compact with several core goals: the stimulation of economic growth, the promotion of human rights and social equity, the strengthening of democratic institutions, and, finally, for Mexico “to decide what place it wants to occupy in the world.” More specifically, they continued, “it is time to choose between North America and Latin America.” Mexico might have its heart in Latin America, but “its wallet, its head, and nearly one-tenth its population are in North America.” Sympathetic affinity with Latin America reflects sentimental attachments to language, culture, and history—rather than economic interests or demographic realities, what they call “the human density of the relationship.” Aguilar Camín and Castañeda propose a bold solution: “an economic union with North America, one that includes everything left out of NAFTA—migration, energy, infrastructure, supranational institutions, funds for social cohesion, economic convergence—in the long run, a common currency—and the indispensable issue of the present era, regional security.” The presumptive model, of course, would be the European Union.35 Whether or not such a plan is adopted, it should become a central theme in national debates. Mexicans should have used the 2012 campaign not only to select its leaders but also to define its future. As of this writing, the proposal faces harsh realities. One is the disenchantment and disarray that has besieged the European Union over the past year or two, as economic crises in Greece and Italy (and Portugal and Spain) threaten to unravel the entire scheme. Another is the economic predicament of the United States, which seems unlikely to embrace largescale experiments. Ultimately, prospects for formal regional integration would depend very largely on US perceptions of the world—and in particular, on the extent to which US leaders see the world as multipolar. As sketched out earlier, most of the other conceptions of global power—unipolar, flat, or pyramidal—do not accord special attention to Mexico. One might argue\n\n34\n\nMexico and the United States\n\nthat Mexico deserves higher standing in a pyramidal world order than it receives from Leslie Gelb, but that does not change the fundamental points: (1) the feasibility of a North American union depends on the worldview that prevails in the United States, (2) the idea of a multipolar distribution of power is the most propitious to this kind of an enterprise, and (3) the American public and US leaders are far from being in agreement on the nature of the world order. Mexico might choose to debate such a plan, but that does not mean that the United States will be willing to accept it.36\n\nConclusion This study yields several conclusions. The first, and most obvious, is that the United States and Mexico hold strikingly different views of the world order. US debates cover a range of alternative notions—unipolar, flat, multipolar, and pyramidal—while the prevailing opinion in Mexico inclines toward a de facto unipolar vision. Most US interpretations of the world ascribe very modest, if any, geopolitical roles to Mexico, while Mexico sees the United States as an unchallenged superpower. As a result, Mexico generally occupies a midlevel position in the US scale of priorities, while the United States stands at the pinnacle of Mexican priorities. Understandably enough, this contrast has frequently led to misunderstanding, miscommunication, and wringing of hands. It does not derive, however, from relative levels of wisdom, benevolence, or nobility of spirit; it stems from differential positions in and views of the world. It is a reflection of asymmetry. Second, these differences have led to lost opportunities. On many occasions, the United States might have achieved more than it did if it had paid more attention to Mexico—listened respectfully to Mexican concerns, pondered alternative policies, and searched for positive-sum solutions. And ironically, Mexico might have achieved more on occasion if it had paid less attention to the United States—that is, if it had paid more attention to the rest of the world (not only Latin America, but other areas as well). The recent emergence of China and Brazil poses delicate problems for Mexico, and the nation can ill afford to ignore that new reality. Mexico has significant roles and responsibilities in the international arena, notwithstanding its middling position, and it is important to discharge them to maximum advantage. Third, uncertainty prevails in both Mexico and the United States. In a highly polarized political environment, US officials and opinion-makers\n\nGlobal Scenarios and Bilateral Priorities\n\n35\n\nhave yet to forge a shared vision of the world order. And Mexico, still in the early stages of its experience with democracy, has yet to rebuild a strategic sense of national purpose. Internally as well as externally, both societies find themselves in states of flux. Neither nation now seems prepared to forge a “grand strategy” for foreign policy in general or for the bilateral relationship. Until such questions are resolved, the bilateral relationship will be governed by inconsistency and fragmentation. In the United States, bureaucratic inertia, political demands, and subnational interests will likely prevail in differing domains of policy. As intermestic issues arise, they will provoke narrow-minded responses and reactions.37 And so long as foreign policy remains a presidential prerogative in Mexico, as explained in Chapter 4, its policy toward the United States will be subject to significant alteration with every change of sexenio (the six-year presidential term of office). In democratic settings, effective and durable foreign policy requires the support of citizens and their representatives. In the meantime, the best that can be hoped for is that Mexico and the United States will muddle through. It is hard to get where you want to go without a road map.\n\nNotes 1.

Drezner, “Does Obama Have a Grand Strategy?”\n\n3 The Dynamics of US-Mexican Relations Andrew Selee and Alberto Díaz-Cayeros\n\nIn 2009 the largest US-based automobile company, General Motors,\n\nwent bankrupt. Ripples were felt in Mexico as thousands of workers were laid off in the car and part industries. This sector, a symbol of successful integration into North American markets, was the hardest hit by the global recession, precisely for reasons related to the profound connection of Mexican manufacturing with US firms. US and Mexican financial officials consulted on how to handle GM, and the presidents touched on this twice when they met. The final decisions were made by the US government, which eventually opted to take majority ownership. However, the remarkable feature is that the restructuring took place without recriminations from Mexico and with a degree of cooperative dialogue between the two countries that would have been unimaginable twenty years ago. The restructured GM eventually paid the US and Canadian governments more than $2 billion from their bailout, far in advance of the due date, and reinvested in assembly plants in Detroit and Kansas. The Mexican car industry suffered a slump, but it gradually recovered employment and activity. This incident points to three underlying truths about the US-Mexico relationship. First, this is one of the most interdependent international relationships in the world. The automobile industry is almost seamlessly integrated between the two countries and Canada. Such integration is characteristic of several other industries. Trade between Mexico and the United States has quintupled since 1990, reaching $305 billion per year and accounting for 12 percent of US exports, second only to Canada, and comprising 81 percent of Mexico’s exports.1 Such trade intensity is clearly pre37\n\n38\n\nMexico and the United States\n\ndicted by gravity models of international trade, where geographic proximity provides a good measure of the potential for commercial exchange between countries. Yet this increase obscures the truly surprising fact that there used to be so little trade between the two nations, notwithstanding their common border. In addition to trade in goods and services, US sources account for over 40 percent of all foreign direct investment in Mexico.2 While the inverse is less common, several Mexican companies have recently acquired US businesses and have become industry leaders in the United States in bread, tortillas, and baked goods; milk and dairy production; and cement. There is also substantial evidence that the two countries are developing a de facto interdependent labor market, even if laws do not formalize this trend. This has built demographic ties far beyond what existed three decades ago and is transforming the cultural character of both societies. Today almost one in ten people in the United States is of Mexican descent, while one in ten Mexicans lives in the United States. In addition, more than 90 million people live in the four US and six Mexican states that comprise the border region, including 15 million in cities and counties along the border itself. Within the border region, common environmental concerns around water, air quality, and wildlife require constant bilateral management. Such intense interaction among people straddling the border has also generated a distinctive and rich cultural manifestation. The almost two-thousand-mile border, the longest between a developed and a developing country anywhere in the world, has also become the preferred crossing point for illegal narcotics from Mexico and South America on their way to consumers in the United States and for billions of dollars heading back south, presenting shared health and public security challenges to both countries. Not only is the relationship interdependent, but it is highly complex. In the case of General Motors, a single business with major suppliers in both countries, not the federal governments, was the central actor in the unfolding drama that affected thousands of workers on both sides of the border. To the extent that public officials tried to manage the fallout, it was the Treasury departments of both countries that took the lead in the policy discussions, rather than the US State Department and Mexico’s Secretariat of Foreign Relations (SRE). Labor unions played a prominent role in both countries in the discussion about the restructuring plans. State and municipal governments weighed in on both sides of the border to help workers pick up the pieces after losing their jobs. This is not a conventional foreign policy relationship but rather a mixture of foreign and domestic policy, what has come to be known as an\n\nThe Dynamics of US-Mexican Relations\n\n39\n\n“intermestic” relationship.3 The US State Department and Mexico’s SRE, often through their embassies, manage diplomatic encounters between the two countries, but almost every agency of the two federal governments has some policy engagement with the other country, with the shared border, or with migrants.4 In addition, state and local governments are increasingly setting a path of engagement with each other on specific, tangible issues within their purview and often demanding policy influence in bilateral affairs. Civil society organizations, private companies, and family and community networks often have "
