        "text": "Books & Books, Politics & Prose, and Miami Book Fair present…\n\nA Virtual Evening with Jeannette Winterson\n\nIn Conversation with The Feminist Present\n\n12 Bytes: How We Got Here. Where We Might Go Next\n\n(Grove Press, $27)\n\nFriday, October 15, 6 PM ET\n\nREGISTER HERE\n\nAbout the book:\n\nTwelve eye-opening, mind-expanding, funny and provocative essays on the implications of artificial intelligence for the way we live and the way we love from New York Times bestselling author Jeanette Winterson\n\n“Talky, smart, anarchic and quite sexy,” said Dwight Garner in the New York Times about Jeanette Winterson’s latest novel, Frankissstein, which perfectly describes too this new collection of essays on the same subject of AI.\n\nIn 12 Bytes, the New York Times bestselling author of Why Be Happy When You Can Be Normal? Jeanette Winterson, draws on her years of thinking and reading about artificial intelligence in all its bewildering manifestations. In her brilliant, laser focused, uniquely pointed and witty style of story-telling, Winterson looks to history, religion, myth, literature, the politics of race and gender, and computer science, to help us understand the radical changes to the way we live and love that are happening now.\n\nWhen we create non-biological life-forms, will we do so in our image? Or will we accept the once-in-a-species opportunity to remake ourselves in their image? What do love, caring, sex, and attachment look like when humans form connections with non-human helpers, teachers, sex-workers, and companions? And what will happen to our deep-rooted assumptions about gender? Will the physical body that is our home soon be enhanced by biological and neural implants, keeping us fitter, younger, and connected? Is it time to join Elon Musk and leave Planet Earth?\n\nWith wit, compassion and curiosity, Winterson tackles AI’s most fascinating talking points, from the algorithms that data-dossier your whole life to the weirdness of backing up your brain.\n\nAbout the Author:\n\nBorn in Manchester, England, Jeanette Winterson is the author of more than twenty books, including the national bestseller Why Be Happy When You Could Be Normal?, Oranges Are Not the Only Fruit, The Passion, and Frankisssstein. She has won many prizes including the Whitbread Award for Best First Novel, the John Llewellyn Rhys Prize, the E. M. Forster Award, and the Stonewall Award.\n\nAbout the Moderators:\n\nThe Feminist Present uses the gift of feminism to help us figure out what the hell is going on right now. Co-hosted by author-academics Adrian Daub and Laura Goode at Stanford University, TFP features near-weekly interviews with important feminist voices from across the world, including authors, journalists, activists, academics, artists, and many more. The Feminist Present is a project of the Clayman Institute for Gender Research, which has been committed to making the future feminist since 1974.\n\nAdrian Daub is the Faculty Director of the Clayman Institute for Gender Research at Stanford, as well as a professor of comparative literature and German studies. He’s the author of several books, including The James Bond Songs: Pop Anthems of Late Capitalism and What Tech Calls Thinking. Another book on music, What The Ballad Knows, will follow from OUP in 2021. His cultural criticism and political commentary has appeared in n+1, The Guardian, Longreads, OneZero, The New Republic, and Los Angeles Review of Books, among many other publications. He holds a BA from Swarthmore College and a Ph.D from the University of Pennsylvania.\n\nLaura Goode teaches in the English department at Stanford, where she also leads the student-facing programming of Stanford’s Public Humanities Initiative.
