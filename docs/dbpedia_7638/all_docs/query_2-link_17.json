        "text": "1\n\nTrump’s Palm Beach\n\nThe forty or so billionaires who winter in Palm Beach want everything done their way in their time. When they play golf, they insist on teeing off as soon as they arrive at their golf course. When they go out to dinner in the exclusive Florida resort community, they expect to be shown immediately to a table, and not just any table, but one of the best in the house. When they drive in their Bentleys and Rolls-Royces, they take it for granted they will be able to glide around the barrier island without interruption. And when they fly into Palm Beach International Airport in their private planes, they consider it their right to land immediately and to be driven to the island without delay. The fact that the drawbridge might be up is a terrible imposition.\n\nBut on the first Friday of February 2017, these billionaires who waited for no one had no choice but to wait for one of their kind. President Donald J. Trump was coming to town. For most of his three decades in Palm Beach, he had railed against the planes that flew over Mar-a-Lago interrupting the tranquility and fouling his estate. That was no longer a worry. In advance of Trump’s arrival, everything airborne had been shut down. No planes would fly anywhere near Mar-a-Lago until he headed back to Washington.\n\nAfter Air Force One landed at Palm Beach International Airport just after 4:30 P.M., the president walked down the ramp, where he kissed his wife, Melania, who had arrived on an air force Gulfstream from New York City. Melania was continuing to live in New York until their son, Barron, finished his school year, and for the most part, she saw her husband only on weekends.\n\nA welcoming crowd of about fifty supporters, donning the trademark red Make America Great Again hats, had come to the West Palm Beach airport to welcome and cheer the seventy-year-old leader. A parade of thirty-one vehicles sat on the tarmac ready to take Trump’s party to Mar-a-Lago. This was his first presidential trip out of Washington, and an extraordinary number of advisers and staff had accompanied the president aboard Air Force One.\n\nChief of Staff Reince Priebus and chief strategist Steve Bannon were by Trump’s side, constantly jockeying for position to be nearest. They represented two poles of power in the White House, and each man tried to keep as close to the president as he could. Each had his own aides and other staffers, and they all wanted to be present and not to miss anything.\n\nSouthern Boulevard had been emptied so the presidential cavalcade could speed eastward from the airport without slowing. Although the vehicles only briefly traversed I-95 over a bridge, traffic on the state’s crucial north-south highway had been stopped. Even trains traveling through West Palm Beach had been halted. The drawbridge onto the island of Palm Beach stayed down for Trump, backing up a number of boats as he zoomed right through in his armored black Chevy SUV.\n\nSouth Ocean Boulevard had been shut down for half a mile north of the estate, effectively blocking north-south traffic on the island. It would stay this way until the president flew back to Washington. Secret Service agents positioned themselves around the buildings, grounds, and surrounding areas. A patrol boat sailed slowly back and forth past Mar-a-Lago on the Intracoastal Waterway and a coast guard ship sat offshore on the Atlantic Ocean, ever vigilant on the far horizon.\n\nStores, restaurants, and gas stations along Southern Boulevard and Dixie Highway were empty because customers couldn’t get to them. Business owners who voted for Trump saw this as a minor price to pay to have their stalwart in the White House. Those who opposed him were outraged that he was adversely affecting their businesses.\n\nThis was Trump’s first visit to Palm Beach, Florida, since he was sworn in as president only two weeks earlier. His Mar-a-Lago estate was so important to his sense of well-being that he was not willing to wait any longer to spend time there.\n\nTrump has owned the estate for more than thirty years, and he spends most of his cold-weather weekends there. The long presidential campaign had caused him to give up those visits a lot more often than he’d liked. But after his victory in November, he was determined to get back to this routine.\n\nMar-a-Lago is Trump’s spiritual home, the place where he can be himself. Many presidents have had winter retreats, a number of them in Florida. Richard Nixon flew down to his waterfront home in Key Biscayne. John F. Kennedy took over the family estate in the north end of Palm Beach as his winter White House. Harry S. Truman turned a house in Key West into his Little White House. But these were private residences, and Mar-a-Lago is a club where people flow in and out by the hundreds.\n\nIt’s hard to imagine any of these other presidents wanting to be inundated at their Florida retreats with all kinds of people whose only commonality is that they have paid the money to be there. But Mar-a-Lago energizes the president, with its wealthy members who these days pay two hundred thousand dollars for the privilege to dine at the club’s upscale restaurant, lounge by its pools and beach during the day, play tennis on the red clay courts, and, if they cough up a couple of hundred thousand more dollars for a second membership, play a round of golf at the nearby Trump International Golf Club.\n\nRight after his election, Trump let the Secret Service know he intended to visit Mar-a-Lago regularly, and with all the people who would be running in and out of the club, they quickly recognized the immense challenges his request would create. Trump didn’t seem to care what problems he presented to the Secret Service. He was used to getting whatever he wanted, and now, as president, he had near-limitless power to ensure things were precisely as he wanted them.\n\nThe new president was unconcerned about the costs or disruptions of his visits. The Washington Post estimated that if Trump flew down to Mar-a-Lago most cold-weather weekends over his first term as president, the costs to the U.S. government for his trips would run around $130 million.\n\nAs the presidential SUV drove through the gates of Mar-a-Lago, Trump was back where he belonged. The estate is the most grandiose statement of his success, the symbol of his life and its myriad challenges. He had almost lost Mar-a-Lago once and had saved it only by turning it into a club. Mar-a-Lago means so much to him that he fought an unyielding battle against the Palm Beach elite, who had at best always been suspicious of the flashy real estate tycoon and at worst despised him.\n\nIn so many ways, the island was Trump’s training ground, a place where he learned techniques that he used in his race for the White House. The relentless, combative style he perfected in this enclave of billionaires would ultimately be part of his appeal to the common man and a key to how he won the highest office in the land. It was at Mar-a-Lago that he served his apprenticeship for the most unlikely victory in presidential history.\n\nNot only did Trump beat the Palm Beach establishment the way no one ever had, but he marginalized them, pushing them back and making room for the ascendency of a new moneyed class of which he is the acknowledged leader. I’m the king of Palm Beach, Trump boasted to author Timothy L. O’Brien. They all come over, they all eat, they all love me, they all kiss my ass. And then they all leave and say: ‘Isn’t he horrible.’ But I’m the king.\n\nEven within the protected confines of Mar-a-Lago, some members of the club abhorred him. Trump didn’t care. Love. Hate. They were just words. What mattered was that people paid attention to him. All was right with the world when controversy swirled around him, just as long as he stood in the eye of the hurricane.\n\nTrump had hardly been in the White House long enough to know where all the rooms were, and already the critics were describing his administration as drowning in chaos. A mark of this disorder was Trump’s executive order halting visitors to the United States from seven largely Muslim nations. The document was so ineptly written and legally flawed that as Trump was flying to Palm Beach, a federal judge in Seattle ordered the government to stop enforcing the ban.\n\nHis first full day in Palm Beach, Trump sent out a barrage of tweets attacking the judge’s decision. Then he went over to the Trump International Golf Club in West Palm Beach for a round of golf before returning to have a phone call with President Petro O. Poroshenko of Ukraine late that afternoon. In between that and getting ready for dinner, the president found time to talk to any number of Mar-a-Lago members, bathing in their tributes to his greatness and also putting them in the unique position of advising the president on whom he should appoint to positions within his administration.\n\nThat evening Trump was slated to attend the sixtieth annual International Red Cross Ball, long regarded as the most prestigious charity event in Palm Beach. The event was to be held in the Donald J. Trump Ballroom on the estate grounds. The massive hall is Trump’s personal creation. The exterior looks like a perfect adjunct to Mar-a-Lago’s Moorish exterior, but the interior has what he calls the feel and look of Louis XIV, and that’s my favorite style.\n\nTrump spent forty million dollars on the ballroom—four times what he paid for Mar-a-Lago and all its possessions—building the twenty-thousand-square-foot structure in 2004. His model was the magnificent Hall of Mirrors at Versailles. The whole thing was about showing the money, laying out what he had in all its glorious excess. He spent seven million dollars alone on twenty-four-karat gold sheets that shimmered from the ceiling, which was also adorned with seventeen crystal chandeliers. Even the bathrooms were mini palaces with golden basins, and everywhere one looked the gilded palace screamed out its affluence. Gold. Gold, and more gold.\n\nThat night, the president stood at the entrance to the ballroom in black formal dress beside Melania in a long, red sleeveless gown, perfectly rendered for the regal scene set out before them. When Trump looked out on the vast ballroom, he saw a splendid assemblage. The ladies wore gowns of every description, and the gentlemen were impeccably garbed in tuxedos.\n\nThe waiters wore powdered wigs and satinlike knee breeches, while the waitresses dressed in period dresses. No peasants tried to storm the barricades outside the ballroom, but roughly three hundred protesters marched along the road to Mar-a-Lago, their shouts fitting into the royal theme.\n\nTrump’s aides may have flown down with the president, but that did not mean they joined him at the ball. This evening Trump was alone with his Palm Beach world, and for a few hours, he appeared to want nothing to do with the problematic world of Washington.\n\nThe social elite of Palm Beach had regarded Trump as a vulgar interloper when he first came to the island. The Red Cross Ball was their event, and they didn’t like having him play much of a role. But things were different now. The old establishment had lost its hold on things, overwhelmed by new money, and it was these new-money people who filled the ballroom this evening. As for Trump, he had gone from being barely tolerated at the event to becoming its central figure.\n\nIn Palm Beach, there is no higher social honor than chairing the Red Cross Ball, and this year’s chairman, Janet Cafaro, was emblematic of how much the island had changed since the days it was run by a WASP elite. Her husband, John J. J. Cafaro, is a convicted felon who in 2001 pled guilty to conspiracy to bribe a U.S. congressman. In 2010, he again pled guilty to siphoning illegal campaign contributions to his daughter’s race for the Ohio legislature.\n\nThe old Palm Beach would not have been so accepting of the Cafaros, but after the Ohio mall developer contributed $50,000 to the Trump Foundation in 2016, Trump said that Cafaro was a fantastic man. The president appeared to view these crimes as no worse than a couple of speeding tickets. As long as the Cafaros had enough money to make a substantial contribution to the Red Cross, what was wrong with Janet Cafaro speaking for a few minutes before the president of the United States while her felon husband looked on proudly?\n\nIn Trump’s world, money spoke. It spoke louder than truth, louder than culture, louder than class, louder than manners. It simply overwhelmed.\n\nSeated next to Trump at his table was fellow Palm Beach winter resident Wilbur Ross, whom the president had made his choice for secretary of commerce in part because Ross claimed he was a billionaire. One of the speakers this evening was another of Trump’s wealthy Palm Beach friends, the ball’s honorary chairman, Patrick Park. Trump planned to make Park his ambassador to Austria.\n\nFinally, Trump got up to speak at a dais, which had affixed to it the presidential seal. I don’t think I’ve ever seen the room looking more beautiful—perhaps at our wedding—right, Melania? he said, looking over at his wife. We’re very proud of Mar-a-Lago and all the money we’ve raised in this room and in this wonderful house.\n\nThe Red Cross spent $436,125 putting on the event, a substantial portion of that going to Mar-a-Lago. Like every other charitable event at the estate, it was a profitable venture for Trump. There was no reason why this couldn’t continue during his presidency. Trump did make his own donations at charity events, but close inspection usually revealed he had done so with someone else’s money.\n\nThe president stayed late that evening, appearing to savor each moment. The Secret Service was omnipresent, warding off any unwanted well-wishers, but Trump accepted accolades from scores of the attendees at the ball. This was his golden ballroom and his golden night. He and Melania danced to Old Time Rock and Roll, in what truly was now, undisputedly, Donald Trump’s Palm Beach. The president was home.\n\n2\n\nFantasy Island\n\nFreezing temperatures were gripping New York City in early 1982—so much so that Donald and Ivana Trump decided to fly south for a few days in the Florida sun. They didn’t know much about Palm Beach, but they had been to Miami many times and were looking for someplace new. Wherever they traveled, they stayed in the best hotels. In Palm Beach that meant the Breakers.\n\nIt sounded like a great plan, but as soon as the Trumps arrived at the Breakers, it began to pour rain. Trump was not the kind of man to relieve his boredom by putting in an hour on an exercise bike in the gym. Instead, he called down to the concierge and ordered up a limousine for a tour of the island.\n\nWhen the driver took the Trumps around the resort town, he was showing them not only one of the wealthiest towns in the world, but a community that was the creation of one man. In the late nineteenth century, Henry Morrison Flagler had the grandiose idea to turn the largely unpopulated island on the east coast of Florida into a winter paradise for the American elite. Thirty-five-year-old Trump believed that society advanced itself by singular men doing singular things, and the more he heard about Flagler, the more he admired the founder of Palm Beach.\n\nFlagler, in partnership with John D. Rockefeller, had built Standard Oil into the country’s largest corporation. Reviled by many of their fellow citizens as robber barons, these immensely wealthy men were among the emblematic characters of the Gilded Age. Rockefeller used his philanthropy to sweeten that malevolent image, and in his last years, many Americans came to revere him as a kindly gentleman who passed out dimes to children.\n\nFlagler didn’t share Rockefeller’s concerns over image, and he took no pleasure in handing out money. His first step in fulfilling his dream was to build a railroad down the eastern coast of the state. Florida had been part of the union since 1845, but it was largely as wild and unpopulated as the remote regions of the West, and building the Florida East Coast Railway, as it would be named, was a major engineering feat.\n\nWhen the rails reached most of the way south, Flagler constructed a hotel in the jungles of Palm Beach. Flagler was not one for modesty, and his new hotel would not be humble. In order to get people to take an overnight train down from the North, the oil tycoon built, in less than a year, a massive hotel facing Lake Worth, later part of the Intracoastal Waterway that separates Palm Beach from the mainland. Flagler named it the Royal Poinciana Hotel, after a tree that blooms fire-red flowers, and opened it in January 1894.\n\nPeople came in such numbers that two years later Flagler constructed an imposing all-wooden hotel, the Palm Beach Inn, a half mile eastward on the oceanfront. When guests started asking for rooms down by the breakers, Flagler changed the hotel’s name to the Breakers. He brought in a railway link to carry passengers right up to the door of their hotel, but motorized vehicles were not allowed on the island. Guests either walked between the two hotels along the palm-tree-bordered pathway, boarded a trolley car pulled by a mule, or took one of the scores of Afromobiles, wicker chairs set on bicycles pedaled by young black men wearing white knickerbockers.\n\nBoth hotels were hugely successful, and in 1901 Flagler built an addition onto the Royal Poinciana, turning the eighteen-hundred-foot-long structure into the largest hotel in the world. The Royal Poinciana had so many dining rooms that all seventeen hundred guests could sit down to dinner at the same time, including the maids and valets, who had their own separate dining room. If one walked into the lobby and looked at the expanse of the place, the impression was of an enormous greenhouse, with palms, ferns, and all kinds of plants in the rotunda and halls blending into the moss-green carpeting and the pale-green tint of the walls, set off by white and gold furniture.\n\nElaborate breakfasts were served, and there were afternoon teas and evening dances, leading guests to change their outfits three or four times a day. The rich and famous came in droves. You could be walking along the beach path, and there would be Mark Twain strolling with a cigar in his mouth. Or at dinner you might spy the celebrated novelist Henry James, who was enthralled by the hotel: To stand off and see it rear its incoherent crest above its gardens was to remember—and quite with relief—nothing but the processional outline of Windsor Castle that could appear to march with it.\n\nFlagler had opened the Royal Poinciana with only seventeen guests, but it seemed that almost overnight he turned Palm Beach into the most celebrated winter resort in America. If you were wealthy and privileged, it was the place to be. The establishments were filled not just with celebrities, millionaires, and their entourages but with people who paid good dollars to rub shoulders with their social betters.\n\nOne of those staying at the hotel in February 1911 was John Honey Fitz Fitzgerald, the mayor of Boston, who had arrived from the Northeast with his daughter Rose, who would one day become the mother of President John F. Kennedy. Fitzgerald was a boisterous, irascible politician who had won election attacking the very upper-class Americans who patronized the hotel. Yet this didn’t stop him from wanting to hobnob with them.\n\nThis was the greatest ball I ever saw, Fitzgerald said after a dance in the hotel ballroom. Just think of the millions and millions of dollars represented on that floor tonight, not alone in the jewels and dresses, but in the capitalists who stand for so much. All you have to do is put out your finger, and you are pointing out a millionaire.\n\nFlagler’s overwhelming success with his hotels didn’t help him much with the problems he faced in his personal life. When his first wife died of tuberculosis, he married her nursemaid, Ida Alice Shourds. His bride went slowly mad, a condition possibly exacerbated by her husband’s many affairs.\n\nMost husbands of that era would have felt they were stuck with a sick wife. Not Henry Flagler. After institutionalizing Ida Alice, he went to the Florida legislature and got the politicians to pass a special law so he could divorce his spouse. Like many Palm Beach denizens to come, Flagler seemed to feel that having a sick spouse was a reminder of his own mortality, while a young thing gave him his own personal fountain of youth. The mogul waited only ten days after the divorce became final to marry his longtime mistress Mary Lily Kenan.\n\nWealthy Americans like Flagler were obsessed with royalty. Although the American Constitution forbade citizens from receiving noble titles, the moneyed could at least live in palaces fit for kings and queens. With that in mind, Flagler built a seventy-thousand-square-foot winter residence next door to the Royal Poinciana that the New York Herald described as more wonderful than any palace in Europe, grander and more magnificent than any other private dwelling in the world.\n\nFlagler named the immense structure Whitehall and gave it to his third wife as a wedding gift. And, of course, the whole point of having a young bride and a glorious home with rooms fit for public occasions was to have grand dinner parties and private balls to show your peers that they were not your peers. No one had more splendid evenings than the Flaglers. But as large as Whitehall was, it did not contain anything like the grand ballroom at the Royal Poinciana, and the Flaglers frequented major evenings there, too, receiving accolades and deference as the reigning couple of Palm Beach.\n\nWhen eighty-three-year-old Flagler tumbled down the marble staircase at Whitehall in 1913 and died, the third Mrs. Flagler didn’t wear her widow’s weeds for very long. She reconnected with a beau from her youth who was four and a half years younger than she; women, too, in Palm Beach were not immune from seeking the fountain of youth in a younger partner.\n\nDuring Donald and Ivana’s tour of the island, they saw only a few signs of Palm Beach’s early years. The Breakers, where the couple was staying, rose high above the Atlantic beach, but this was not the original structure. When the wooden Breakers burned down in 1925, concrete was used to rebuild the massive hotel. The Royal Poinciana could not compete with the Breakers’ up-to-date facilities, and in 1935, the hotel was torn down. Flagler’s Whitehall mansion still stood, but in 1960 it became the Flagler Museum, memorializing an extravagant way of life that, by the time Trump arrived there, seemed gone forever.\n\nTrump did see, in a number of places, the legacy of architect Addison Mizner, the other most important figure in the island’s early history. Many of Mizner’s childhood years were spent in Central America, where his father was an ambassador, and the future architect’s young mind was deeply influenced by the medieval Spanish style he saw. Mizner abhorred the boxlike structures of Flagler’s two hotels. He believed that might have been perfect for the north, but in a climate that is warm most of the year, the closed-up buildings were often mercilessly hot. Even when there weren’t suffocating conditions, Mizner said that hotel guests lived an artificial life, spending their days changing from one confining outfit to the next.\n\nNo tour of Palm Beach was complete without a drive down Worth Avenue. At the end of one of the most celebrated luxury shopping streets in the world stood Mizner’s first commission and most important building, the Everglades Club. The giant structure was built in 1918 and was financed by Mizner’s partner in the project, Paris Singer, a son of the sewing machine dynast. The two friends originally planned a hospital for wounded officers, but with World War I over, there was no need, and it was changed to a private club.\n\nMizner was a fantasist of the highest order, and he said he was creating a nunnery, with a chapel built into the lake. The building was like a medieval palace, akin to the Alhambra in Andalusia. The walls were thick and the ceilings high, fostering a coolness even on the hottest day.\n\nTo complete his dream, Mizner oversaw everything from the top of the Moorish tower to the smallest footstool in the corner of the remotest room. He had the whimsical daring to use twenty-two wildly different window treatments on the north facade. From his studio in West Palm Beach, he created furniture and tiles that his workers made to appear centuries old. These weren’t so much fake antiques as spirited re-creations of an invented past.\n\nPatrons of Palm Beach with real money soon vacated the hotels, leaving them to the tourists, and commissioned Mizner to build them their own winter residences. He designed scores of Palm Beach homes. In 1923 alone, he oversaw eighteen major projects. He did not work from plans, and the rooms seemed to meander in unexpected ways. What they all had was an aura that elevated and broadened the make-believe of Palm Beach.\n\nAs the Everglades Club grew in popularity, it became the social center of the island. Membership had to be renewed each season, and Singer filled the palacelike building with people who entertained him. To him what was ugly or boring was bad, and what was beautiful or amusing was good, recalled a friend, Alice DeLamar. He felt hostility to bores alone.\n\nIn Palm Beach society, the highest calling was to amuse and to be amusing. Everyone had money, but money was not what mattered. Palm Beach was full of all kinds of gloriously unique characters. Wit sparkled, and there was a genuine"
