        "text": "THE DANCE CARD By John R. Feegel. 314 pp. New York: The Dial Press. $11.95.\n\nTHE FINAL ACT By Christopher Hudson. 224 pp. New York: Holt, Rinehart and Winston. $10.95.\n\nASSIGNMENT By Laurence Leamer. 211 pp. New York: The Dial Press. $10.95.\n\nTHE ELGAR VARIATION By Michael Kenyon. 306 pp. New York: Coward, McCann & Geoghegan. $13.95.\n\nThe axis of the spy novel may have shifted. Here are four of the winter season's leading contenders for the thriller trade, three of which eschew the genre's traditional European setting for the New World.\n\nJohn R. Feegel's ''Dance Card,'' for example, has as its epochal historical event the battle of the Bay of Pigs. Though far less subtle than, say, a novel by John le Carre or Robert Littell, this novel will keep most aficionados of the genre turning pages through the night.\n\nIts protagonist, a Navy pathologist named Dr. George Toll, is ordered to play a role in a cover-up of U.S. military casualties on the beach at Bahia Porcinos. A C.I.A. commander named James Fahey instructs him in the ''laundering'' of the American dead by having him perform fake autopsies on the invasion victims and then shipping the bodies, about 20 in number, around the country to the supposed locations of their ''accidental'' deaths. Toll, more out of a sense of professional outrage than civic justice, secretly records the names and actual causes of death of the so-called military ''advisers'' on a small white filing card; he refers to it as the ''dance card'' in a letter that he subsequently writes to Fahey when in a mistaken fit of fear and pique Toll decides that his own ''accidental'' death might yet occur.\n\nFahey spends the next decade attempting to extract the card from Toll by both fair means and foul. But the stubborn, and ultimately heroic, medical man refuses to break under the pressure. The novel itself holds up just as well. From Washington to Alaska to Midway to the shores of Hispaniola to the jungles of Haiti and, finally, to the lobby of an Atlanta hotel (which turns out to be the most dangerous place of all), Dr. Toll keeps struggling to hold on to the ''dance card,'' his honor as a physician and a man, and his life.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
