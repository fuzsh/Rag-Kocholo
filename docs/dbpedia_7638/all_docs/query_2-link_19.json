        "text": "August 15, 2019\n\nThere's an old saying \"Behind every man, there's a good woman\" and that was definitely true for the Kennedys. The Kennedy men would never have accomplished what they did without the Kennedy women.\n\nThe Kennedy Women isn't just about the Kennedy women we all know like Rose, Jackie, Ethel, and Joan. This book introduced us to the women who escaped the Irish potato famine in order to come to America for a better life.\n\nThe first Kennedy and Fitzgerald women had to deal with a lot of discrimination because they were immigrants. They were treated like garbage but through hard work and hardheadedness they persevered. Because of the sacrifices these women made within less than 100 years the Kennedy's were one of the most powerful families in America.\n\nReading this book made so happy that I was born when I was, because these women had to defer their hopes and dreams in order to help the men in their family. They couldn't have careers or even divorce their Horrible husband's. They just had to smile and take it.\n\nDespite often being treated as second class citizens these women still managed to leave an indelible mark on this country. They help shine a light on people with disabilities, they fought through chronic illness, and they exposed they often private shame of alcoholism.\n\nI thought this would be a more tawdry and scandalous read(which I love) but this book was actually well researched and unbiased.\n\nNovember 24, 2016\n\nNothing is as touching as the paragraph detailing the acceptance of Rosemary by her brothers, who chaperoned her dances so she was able to waltz like her classmates. They made her laugh, they made her appear \"not different at all.\" If to the outside world, the Kennedys are clannish, to themselves they are a brood full of love and understanding. Joe, Sr. is a selfish, egotistical monster. Poor Rosemary, poor, poor dear.\n\nReally the more I read the more I want to say that about all of the children. Joe, Sr. was an extraordinary womanizer and I do not believe turning a blind eye makes Rose a saint. Not comforting your children, not showing affection should be unacceptable. The Kennedy children succeeded because they were forced to grow in a more than slightly dysfunctional environment. I find it slightly ironic that Eunice's first government assignment was the first executive secretary in juvenile delinquency, bringing troubled girls home for dinner and preaching, \"we want you to be happy children. Happy children become happy men and women.\" But the crux is exactly how happy was Kathleen who wasn't allowed to mourn her soldier husband, or Bobby who was teased for being gawky, or Rosemary who was lobotomized. Eunice was a case study of GAD. Jack had multiple medical issues exacerbated by his living circumstances and an extreme sexual addiction, possibly searching for the love and comfort he never received as a child.\n\nFive generations of Kennedy women are shown in their full glory, growing, supporting, loving, living and dying. Babies are born; husbands are killed. The faith and loyalty of the Kennedy family is not seen today. However I think that loyalty often made the women blind to what was happening around them. Otherwise, they could have been considered emotional sacrificial lambs on the altar of political popularity.\n\nDecember 4, 2013\n\nThis was my long summer vacation read. I felt intimidated by the length of the book at first. Unnecessarily. The book is fascinating, lengthy - yes,full of minutiae details - yes, but they all build up the story. To me the book is full of life, emotions, drama - highly entertaining and at the same time also informative. The book tells the story of the Kennedys through their women. As a mother I found fascinating to follow the gradual construction of Rose Kennedy’s persona as a mother. However, do not be mistaken about it - the ethos of the patriarchal family has been the driving force behind both Rose's and Joe Kennedy's life. Their performance as parents can certainly be criticized, however, I am impressed by their purpose and dedication. One simply doesn't come across such families anymore. What is simply difficult to fathom in this day and age is the unequal and segregational rules for boys and girls in the family. One can’t help wondering what would become of the Kennedy women, had they been given equal opportunities as their brothers.\n\nMarch 28, 2021\n\nThis book reminds me of why I became a non-practicing Catholic.\n\nLaurence Leamer uses previously written source material and personal interviews to trace the lives of all of the women who, either by blood or through marriage, became part of the Kennedy legacy. He starts by chronicling the lives of the great-grandparents of the generation that attained the White House in the 1960s and continues on through the descendants of the 1990s.\n\nSince Kennedy women were usually raised to consider the ambitions of their fathers, husbands, brothers and sons before their own, their story is also the story of the Kennedy men. The book therefore also gives us portraits of and insights into the extremely gifted yet deeply flawed men of the family.\n\nAs for the Kennedy women, some of them have certainly been talented and charismatic in their own right, but the earlier generations were also emotionally stunted and damaged by the repressive upbringing of the patriarchal society in which they were raised and especially by the attitudes of the Catholic Church.\n\nThis was especially true of Rose Fitzgerald Kennedy, the mother of John, Robert, and Ted Kennedy. She inherited all of her father’s vitality, intelligence and political instincts. She might have made an excellent politician herself if she hadn’t been held back by social mores, the men in her life, and the teachings of her religion.\n\nIn fact, I was amazed at how much direct influence the Church had on her private life, such as when the Bishop of Boston talked Rose’s father out of letting her attend the college of her choice.\n\nShe was sent instead to a Catholic convent boarding school that pretty much finished the job that society had started and turned her into a repressed martinet. She insisted on sending her daughters to the same kind of school and therefore passed on the same damaging effects to them.\n\nEunice Kennedy Shriver is another example of a Kennedy woman who probably would have made a better politician than many of the men in her family, if she hadn’t been raised to use her talents to help her brothers achieve their own ambitions. Yet she found a way to re-direct her drive by starting the Special Olympics. Coming from a wealthy background helps, of course, but it also takes organizational skill, determination, and a social conscience to accomplish something like that.\n\nThe present generation of Kennedy women is much more enlightened about the role of women and still believes in devoting themselves to public service. However, the family legacy has led some of them to think this means running for public office when perhaps they are not suited for it. Their wealth and connections have also given some of them opportunities over better-qualified people.\n\nOn the other hand, their famous name has also subjected them to public scrutiny and criticism that no ordinary person would ever face, and they still battle against a double standard about women in politics.\n\nOverall, this book impressed me with how strong the Kennedy women were and how much they were able to accomplish in spite of all the drawbacks they faced.\n\nJanuary 7, 2012\n\nIn depth, massive book about the Kennedy woman. I really enjoyed the background into Bridget Kennedy, the matriarch who came from Ireland during the mid-1800's and worked her way from nothing to a business owner. A large portion is devoted to Rose, but I found her daughters to be more interesting.\n\nEunice, Pat and Jean in particular, is written about with depth and honesty. Out of the daughters'-in-law, only Joan got much script time. I would have really liked a more honest and detailed look at Jackie, but since so many other books focus exclusively on her, I didn't mind. However, very little was given about Ethel, especially her life after Bobby's death, and I was disappointed in this.\n\nAll in all, I was very impressed with the level of research, and the incredible story of the Kennedy's as laid out with the women as the focus. As the author intended, I couldn't help but feel the Kennedy men in many ways weren't as worthy of the office as the Kennedy women would have been. An excellent book.\n\nOctober 18, 2009\n\nBased on five years of research, and with unprecedented cooperation from Kennedy family and associates, Laurence Leamer paints startling, in-depth portraits of the mothers, wives, sisters, and daughters who struggled to build and maintain the Kennedy dynasty—from steerage on an immigrant vessel to the slums of Boston, from the court of St. James to the White House.\n\n*****Rate this 5/5. The years of research paid off because this book was so well-written and thorough. One always hears of the Kennedy men, but little of their wives, sisters and mother. This book introduces all of them in depth and the lives they lived. This book was over 800 pages and took some time to read, but it was worth the effort. I had just finished Bobby and Jackie, A Love Story, so this book expanded on that one.\n\nOctober 3, 2009\n\nThis is one of the best books I've read on any Kennedy. I have always been fascinated with the family and how especially the women have endured the politics, the affairs, etc. This is a true insight into the foundation that was laid with the first Kennedy woman who opened her own business to support her family. It really depicts Rose's spiritual faith and how it pushed her to do what she believed was best for her family as a whole and those generations that would follow.\n\nDecember 23, 2017\n\nThis is a great book. Readers hear so much about the famous Kennedy men but is refreshing to read about the women. their lives, struggles and experiences.\n\nJune 16, 2017\n\nBrilliant writing and a fascinating family. This is a story of corrupt, hypocritical and sexist men, religion and society as well as self-denying and delusional women about those men and their religion. The facade of the loving, healthy and happy Catholic family didn't take long to come tumbling down to show the truth of unhappiness and loneliness.\n\nThey may have achieved a lot politically but paid a heavy price. None of them appealed to me at all. Surely a lesson from this family story is that power isn't everything.\n\nJanuary 19, 2012\n\nI love biographies.. most biographies. I am interested in this family so I really wanted to read this. I learned alot about the faith people have in their religion. I learned how women were treated in certain era's and families. It was very interesting. There wasn't a part that I wanted to skip or that I thought would drag on. I think back on things I read in this book every now and then.\n\nAugust 4, 2012\n\nRead this book over ten years ago and remember it well. From the day in 1821 when Bridget Murphy, the true Kennedy matriarch, is born in Ireland, to Rose Kennedy's 100th birthday in 1990, this book covers plenty of history.\n\nWhenever there is a news story about the Kennedy family, I think of this book.\n\nJuly 24, 2011\n\nI really enjoyed this book--I feel like I just got started reading more historical non-fiction and this one really was a great first one to get me started. What an amazing/interesting family--it really makes me want to read more about them...so any other good Kennedy books out there\n\nMarch 29, 2020\n\nFascinant de voir l’évolution de la vie des femmes au travers de l’histoire des Kennedy!\n\nWant to read\n\nOctober 28, 2021\n\nRec by Lisa at JLKC book club\n\nMay 20, 2008\n\nI found this book to be pretty great. It was chock full of information of both historical significance and also such tawdriness that, at times, it read like an issue of US Weekly.\n\nWhile the title focuses on the women, I think that one could learn a lot about the men in the Kennedy family as well. After finishing this, I am not sure that I would necessarily need to read The Kennedy Men given the attention that is devoted to them as well; however, the information about the men is generally presented from the standpoint of how the events affected (or were shaped) by the family's women.\n\nSome highlights (some spoilers in here if you are not knowledgeable about the Kennedys):\n\n-I found the description of Eunice Kennedy to be really fascinating. I truly believe, after reading this, that she is the brains of the family.\n\n-The discussion of Rosemary Kennedy's mental retardation and subsequent lobotomy was heartbreaking. Joe Kennedy's motivation for the surgery is just mind-boggling to me.\n\n-I couldn't believe the Kennedy women's widespread naivety about sex. Especially Ethel, who the author describes as having believed that men wore condoms to work every day until a staffer told her otherwise in her mid-life.\n\nOverall, I think this is well worth reading.\n\nJuly 27, 2015\n\nAn exhaustive study of the Kennedy family with focus on the women, starting with Bridget Murphy, an immigrant who married P.J. Kennedy through the grandchildren of the matriarch Rose. Rose is the most interesting subject of this book which was written in 1996, prior to her death. Her rigid compulsive nature is frightening in a mother of nine children, all of whom responded in various ways to their upbringing. The father, Joe, was more beloved, though he too was both a martinet and a libertine. The Kennedy family has had more than its share of tragedies, but the way they responded to them can be startling. A lot of denial going on, and in the women much unquestioning devotion to the rules of the Catholic church. The later generations embraced more liberal views, while frequently having problems with alcohol and drugs, issues that also afflicted some of Rose’s children: Pat, Jean and Teddy. As a psychological study, the book has value.\n\nJuly 28, 2011\n\nI read \"The Kennedy Men\" so just had to get this one. An extremely interesting read. I especially enjoyed the early history. The book does become hard to get through in certain different places but I guess that's difficult to avoid in something this long-800 pages. I got tired of Kathleen Kennedy's debutante days pretty quickly and the ending sort of dragged,but no other real complaints.I would like to know ,however,why there was no mention of Josie Hannan Fitzgerald's death? Seeing as she was Rose Kennedy's mother and discussed at length in the first few chapters,shouldn't it have merited a mention? The death of Rose's father is enclosed,yet the last we hear of Josie is she has gotten old and that's it. Strikes me as odd since this is called \"The Kennedy WOMEN\".\n\nDecember 27, 2008\n\nEveryone knows about JFK, RFK, Teddy, and even Joe Kennedy. But few stories are told about the women, especially Kathleen and Rosemary. This book was a breath of fresh air and gave a lot of insight and analysis about the Kennedy women. It goes into great detail, especially about Rosemary's lobotomy, Kathleen's life. It discusses the triumphs, the trials, and how every member of the family helped or hurt their cause as they attempted to become America's foremost political dynasty. It is the first in a trilogy of Kennedy books, and is by far the best.\n\nJuly 9, 2008\n\nAbsolutely fascinating book about what it is like to be female and Kennedy. I was especially captivated by the story of Rosemary, whose mental disability was seen as such a liability to the family, that her father had her lobotomized and institutionalized without once consulting her mother.\n\nThe power that is is illustrated in these woman's lives (and it isn't their own power, for the most part) is truly frightening.\n\nNovember 29, 2007\n\nA multiple biography of the ladies who made and make the Kennedy clan as successful as it has become. The mothers, sisters, wives and daughters of the men who led the country (or tried to). Special attention is paid to Rose and of course to Jackie, Ethel and Joan, but other important Kennedy women are discussed at length, as well. This is a meaty book and meticulously researched.\n\nDecember 28, 2007\n\nThere is something intriguing about the Kennedy family, and reading about their ups and downs from the perspective of the women is fascinating. I have no particular interest in the Kennedys, in U.S. history, or anything specific about this book other than the simple fact that it is a book -- and it is extremely well-written.\n\nJuly 19, 2008\n\nI found this most fascinating because it begins with Bridget Murphy born in 1821, became an immigrant in the bowels of a ship, married Patrick Kennedy and history was born. This book follows the WOMEN of the Kennedy clan, all the way through Rose to Jacquie. You might not believe in the same politics, but the tenacity of all these women will captivate you.\n\nJune 21, 2013\n\nOne of the best books I have ever read. Wonderfully written & I could not put it down! I thought it would take me ages because it's about as thick as the Bible, but I tore through it. It's seemingly politically neutral, which I was hoping for since I just wanted to read more about the family from an unbiased source. I highly recommend this!\n\nSeptember 17, 2007\n\nI just found it fascinating to look more closely at the lives of these iconic women. Turns out they are just regular people with the same insecurities, sensitivities, and failings that we all have.\n\nFebruary 12, 2009\n\nFantastic book that goes right back the the mid nineteenth century to the early 1990's. Unlike a lot of books on the Kennedy's it neither glosses over bad thing or forgets the good. A fasinating read about the women who's lives were overshadowed by their fathers, brothers, husbands, and sons.\n\nFebruary 19, 2009\n\nThis is ONE OF THE MOST ADDICTIVE books I've ever read!!!!! This not only reads like a novel, but you will laugh, cry, and scream at the women in this book just like you would in a regular novel. It's over 800 pages, but I immediately wanted to reread it once I was done.\n\nFebruary 22, 2010\n\nI gave it about 100 pages before I decided I just wasn't 900 pages worth of interested in the Kennedy's.\n\nIt's a very thorough and well-written book though, and if you are REALLY interested, I recommend it.\n\nAugust 7, 2011\n\nThere are so many lessons and elements and anecdotes of this story that have stayed with me over the years, it has truly influenced me as a person. It can be maddening, but it is worth it for the understanding of the dynamics and culture of this highly influential family."
