        "text": "In my article about the death of Senator Ted Kennedy yesterday, I used the website «Kennedy Family Genealogy»as a source for information about Ted’s grandchildren.\n\nI have noted, however, that the website has not been updated since 23 September 1999, and that is quite a while ago. There must have been many changes to the survey of the descendants of Joseph P. and Rose F. Kennedy since then. The genealogy does not - naturally enough - include the sixth child of Robert Francis Kennedy Jr., for instance (that is Aidan Vieques Kennedy, born 2001, if you wonder).\n\nI have googled around, but haven’t found any other website that gives a similar and updated survey of the Kennedy family and which is trustworthy and well organized (the survey at Babylon, for instance, isn’t! And the survey at Wikipedia does not give many sources). If you know of any website that I have overlooked, please tell!\n\nI have several Kennedy books in my library, including the New York Times bestseller «Sons of Camelot. The Fate of An American Dynasty» by Laurence Leamer, published in 2004. Has any genealogy been published in print since then? If not, is anyone up for the job? :-)\n\nSenator Edward Moore «Ted» Kennedy – «the patriarch of the Kennedy clan», «Lion of the Senate», «the liberal stalwart», «the greatest United States Senator of our time» – died of brain cancer at his home in Hyannis Port, Massachusetts, on 25 August 2009. He was born at St. Margaret’s Hospital in Dorchester, Massachusetts on 22 February 1932 as the 9th and youngest child of Joseph P. Kennedy (1888-1969) and Rose Fitzgerald (1890-1995).\n\nTed Kennedy left behind his wife Victoria, his children Kara, Edward Jr. and Patrick, grandchildren Kiley, Edward III, Grace and Max (Allen) and stepchildren Curran and Caroline Raclin. His sister Jean Kennedy Smith is now the only surviving child of Joseph and Rose Kennedy’s nine children.\n\nTed Kennedy served as Senator from 1962 to 2009, following in the footsteps of his elder brothers John F. Kennedy (1917-1963) and Robert F. Kennedy (1925-1968). When Robert was killed in 1968, Ted was offered to take his place in the campaign for the Democratic nomination, but declined. Everyone expected him to become his party’s candidate in the 1972 election, but his presidential ambitions were destroyed by the Chappaquiddick incident in 1969, something his unsuccessful challenge to President Carter in 1980 confirmed. Serving in the Senate for so many years, he probably got far more influence on American politics, especially in the fields of health and education, than he ever would have if he had become President.\n\nIn a statement on Wednesday morning 26 August, President Barack Obama said that he and his wife «were heartbroken to learn this morning of the death of our dear friend, Senator Ted Kennedy». «For five decades, virtually every major piece of legislation to advance the civil rights, health and economic well being of the American people bore his name and resulted from his efforts». In a public speech held at Chilmark, Massachusetts later on Wednesday President Obama said that Ted Kennedy «became not only one of the greatest senators of our time, but one of the most accomplished Americans ever to serve our democracy».\n\nIn a tribute to Ted Kennedy Vice President Joe Biden Jr. said that he «changed the circumstances of tens of millions of Americans -- in the literal sense, literally -- literally changed the circumstances».\n\nThe news of Edward Kennedy’s death has also dominated the news here in Norway. In the obituary by the Norwegian Telegraphic Agency, NTB, published in among others VG, Kennedy was described as the most influential politician in the Democratic Party. NTB mentions among others the late senator’s fight to increase the minimum wage and his opposition to the war in Iraq.\n\nOne Norwegian expert on American politics, Professor Ole Moen, characterizes Kennedy as a political giant and a \"welfare democrat\". - His death must be a great loss to Obama, as he was an important voice in the work for reforming the health service. To Aftenposten Ole Moen says that Kennedy’s death \"er som en vegg som faller ut av senatet\" (\"is like a wall of the senate falling down\"). - A dynasty has disappeared from American politics.\n\nOther articles and obituaries:\n\nCNN\n\nThe Guardian (UK)\n\nThe Times (UK)\n\nThe Daily Telegraph (UK)\n\nTed Kennedy will be laid to rest at the Arlington National Cemetery in Virginia near the graves of his elder brothers John and Robert.\n\nOther sources:\n\nSenator Edward M. Kennedy\n\nWikipedia article\n\nKennedy Family Genealogy\n\nPeter S. Canellos. «Last Lion. The Fall and Rise of Ted Kennedy», Simon & Schuster, 2009.\n\nMy blog is just one of several blogs that focus on the royal families of the world. I thought I should make a list of some of the blogs that I have encountered.\n\nOne of the best blogs around is authored by the Norwegian historian Trond Norén Isaksen. He does not only cover royal news and events, but also finds the time to write about among others history in general, architecture, books and politics.\n\nEver since the Norwegian newspaper Aftenposten decided to stop its “News in English” service in 2008, Trond Norén Isaksen has provided a place for non-Scandinavian readers to find news in English about both royal and non-royal major events in Norway.\n\nI must admit that I have partly used Isaksen’s blog as a sort of template when constructing my own blog, mainly because his choice of design is so reader friendly (then again Blogspot doesn’t offer that many different ways in setting up the blog).\n\nI promise, however, that I will not be a copycat! There is surely room for more than one royal blog covering among others the Scandinavian monarchies. There are so many different topics to write about that I don’t think it will constitute a problem. It will probably be difficult some times to avoid commenting on the same events, but the emphasis and interpretations will surely be different. I will most likely write more about genealogy than Trond Norén Isaksen, and I doubt that he will ever comment on football or ice hockey!\n\nThe blog Royal Musings by author and Queen Victoria’s Descendants expert Marlene A. Koenig is also worth a visit. She provides news and commentary about the reigning royal houses of the United Kingdom, Sweden, Denmark, Norway, Belgium, Luxembourg, Liechtenstein, the Netherlands, Spain and Monaco as well as the former European monarchies. Especially interesting are the historical tidbits she posts almost daily.\n\nOther blogs:\n\nMarilyn's Royal Blog\n\nRoyal Anecdotes\n\nRoyals and Celebs\n\nThe Monarchist\n\nDanish Royal Watchers\n\nThe Royal Twist\n\n(This is an edited version of a similar list posted at the newsgroup Alt.talk.royalty on 4 May 2009.)"
