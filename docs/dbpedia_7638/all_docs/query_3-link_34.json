        "text": "Fortuitously perhaps for American author and journalist Laurence Leamer, Rose Kennedy's death comes as his massive, astonishingly detailed tome The Kennedy Women is published.\n\nFor though it is subtitled 'The Triumph and Tragedy of America's First Family' and deals with the lives of all Rose's children, her daughters in particular, their children, even their children's children, first, foremost and inevitably this is a book about Rose. Even in sections in which she is not mentioned - few relative to the book's 796 pages, 933 including footnotes and index - her influence permeates.\n\nThe book begins not with Rose but with Bridget, an Irish immigrant who married Joe Kennedy's grandfather and who Leamer describes as the first Kennedy woman. But it moves quickly to Rose's early days, the child of John F Fitzgerald, congressman, then mayor of Boston, who taught his daughter 'the public discipline of politics' yet never let her talk about them.\n\nRose met Joe Kennedy at the Maine Beach where her family spent holidays. Her possessive father disapproved, even sending her overseas to remove her from Joe's influence, but she saw him surreptitously in what Leamer says was her 'first and ultimately only successful act of defiance in her life'.\n\nIt was in her childhood, one in which Rose's mother tolerated the constant absences of her husband and an essentially unhappy marriage, that Rose learned many of the lessons which guided her life and which lay at the heart of the Kennedy family's sticking together in the face of such potentially devastating scandals as Chappaquiddick and William Kennedy Smith's rape trial.\n\nThere she learned to discard all that was negative. When the town where she had spent happy summers and where she and Joe met burned, forcing her and her family to flee for their lives, Rose chose to take this page 'out of the scrapbook of her life and throw it away' as she was to do so many times.\n\nThe story of the burnt town is one of hundreds, thousands even, that pepper this book and bring it to life. No one could say that Leamer hasn't done his homework. What's more, he has done it with the assistance of many of the Kennedys, lending authenticity to his material.\n\nOne of the book's major themes is how difficult it is for the Kennedys to talk intimately about themselves and their pasts, he says.\n\nHe spent five years researching and writing (the most fulfilling of his professional career, he says) and he hopes that as well as conveying his own fascination for the women he writes of, he will 'add to the hidden history of over half the human race'.\n\nBut in my mind, the burning question is, who will benefit from this monumental effort? Students of American history and politics no doubt and probably a large number of Americans for whom the Kennedy clan holds a fascination akin to that of Britain's royal family. But one wonders how many readers outside the US will be moved to plunge into such an in-depth treatment.\n\nNot that this is a difficult book to read, aside from the practical problem posed by holding such a large and heavy volume for any length of time. It's well-written, lively, filled with conversation rather than simply narrative, packed with insights that almost bring gasps of amazement at the lengths the Kennedys have been prepared to go to to protect their family name.\n\nMany of these are not new. Nor are many of the gossipy, juicy parts of the book that most readers will admit to expecting and enjoying in a work of this kind. There must be few left who would be surprised by tales of John F Kennedy's philandering and sexual appetites. The same applies to that of his father, Joe, whose affair with actress Gloria Swanson, revealed initially in her memoirs, was one of so many.\n\nThe Kennedy's eldest daughter, Rosemary, was born mildly intellectually disabled - officially classified as a moron in those days - a potentially huge embarrassment, particularly when she grew older and seemed likely to have sex before marriage. From the outset the family went to great lengths to keep her disability secret.\n\nRose and Rosemary were close. Rose always refused to have her institutionalised. When a new technique known as a lobotomy was suggested for her daughter she had her daughter Kathleen investigate. The results were 'not good', she was told and Rose rejected the idea.\n\nBut Joe Kennedy, concerned for his family name, had the operation performed on his daughter. It was a disaster and Rosemary became infant-like. The Kennedys dealt with it in typical fashion: 'Now they repressed what Joe had done to his daughter, repressed it all and pretended that it never happened and that Rosemary no longer existed.' Rosemary was institutionalised; even family members did not know where she had gone.\n\nRose's daughters and her sons' wives, are also here with their messy lives: Pat, with her drunken, unhappy marriage to actor Peter Lawford; Joan, who had doubts about marrying Edward even before the wedding, but did so and became an alcoholic; Kathleen, whose death in an air crash on 'an adulterous weekend' the Kennedys worked so hard to make seem respectable; and, of course, Jackie, the honorary Kennedy who didn't divorce her faithless husband for fear of risking his chance at the presidency - self-sacrifice for the family, the decision any Kennedy woman would have made, Leamer says. But Rose Kennedy remains its focus.\n\nLeamer ends with an anecdote that perhaps more than any other illustrates the principles that governed her life. In her final year she watched, over and over, a carefully edited video prepared by her family about her family. All the negatives - the deaths, the lobotomy, the faithless husbands, the scandals - were left on the cutting room floor."
