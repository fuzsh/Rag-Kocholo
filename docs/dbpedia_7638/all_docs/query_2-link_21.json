        "text": "King of the Night The Life of Johnny Carson By Laurence Leamer Illustrated. 448 pages. William Morrow & Company. $19.95.\n\nMore and more money for less and less work. In that sense, certainly Johnny Carson embodies the American Dream. But in ''King of the Night,'' an unauthorized biography, Laurence Leamer is more interested in enumerating less appealing aspects of Mr. Carson's off-camera life.\n\nThere are stories about wife beating, child neglect, womanizing, alcoholism, ingratitude and bullying, just to mention a few of the more prominent allegations. Endless variations are played on a basic theme: ''When the red light went on, Johnny was as funny as he had ever been. When the light went off, his life was full of darkness and uncertainty.''\n\nClearly eager to make a dollar or two himself, Mr. Leamer seems to specialize in unauthorized projects. His previous books include ''Make Believe: The Story of Nancy and Ronald Reagan'' and ''As Time Goes By: The Life of Ingrid Bergman.'' Lacking the cooperation of Mr. Carson, he spent two years interviewing the entertainer's former neighbors, associates and the first three of his four wives, in addition to reading just about everything ever written about him.\n\nThe resulting pastiche is often irritatingly speculative and nearly always juicy, already the stuff of tabloid headlines. Then there is this Joan Rivers testimonial for an advertisement: ''It's just terrific!'' Ms. Rivers, of course, was reduced to becoming a regular on ''Hollywood Squares'' after a run-in with Mr. Carson.\n\nThe basic Carson facts are hardly remarkable. Born on Oct. 23, 1926, in Corning, Iowa, he was raised in Norfolk, Neb., on the good side of town. His domineering mother, we are told, always made Johnny feel insignificant and unworthy. As a youngster, he did magic tricks and became a ventriloquist. Writing a college paper about radio announcers, he had an epiphany: ''A good comedian can get you to buy his sponsor's products.'' Even then he knew. In 1952, ''Carson's Cellar,'' a half-hour satire of television, made its debut on the Los Angeles radio station KNXT. The format offered hints of things to come: a topical monologue, answering supposed questions from viewers. For the next 10 years, Mr. Carson would work at a variety of jobs - writing for Red Skelton, acting as the host of game shows, even replacing Tom Ewell in the Broadway show ''Tunnel of Love'' - all the while establishing himself as that nebulous sort of creature known as a television personality.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
