        "text": "It is a rainy Saturday in Thailand (nothing new in October!), giving me an opportunity to download some more eBooks and start participating in yet another meme.\n\nThis meme is hosted by Reading Reality every Saturday. Stacking the Shelves is a chance to showcase all the goodies collected throughout the week, whether they’re bought in a physical store or online, review copies from a publisher, borrowed from a friend or the library, gifts, physical or digital.\n\nEven without the nasty weather, it is a rare occasion for me to go to an actual bookshop — there are an ever-dwindling number remaining on the island, all far from my home — and shipping costs are so prohibitive that I only order perhaps one or two physical books per year online. Why pay more than the cost of a new hardcover in postage, right? Thus, the vast majority of my books are delivered wirelessly and I much prefer epub over Kindle these days.\n\nThis week saw a real (Virtual) Book Haul as a number of my Anticipated Fall Releases became available. I found a few titles that had resided on my Wish List for far too long and stumbled upon a few more that I had not heard of before. I love it when that happens!\n\nMy goodness that is A LOT of books — 20, to be exact! Several of these were stumbled upon, obtained on a whim, three are intended for a Reading Challenge that I plan to do in 2024. The majority, however, have resided on my Wish List for months based on recommendations from various book blogs or Goodreads reviews. Some were simply awaiting their publication dates.\n\n01. The House of Doors by Tan Twan Eng (published May 4, 2023) — “From the bestselling, Booker Prize-shortlisted author of The Garden of Evening Mists, a spellbinding novel about love and betrayal, colonialism and revolution, storytelling and redemption.”\n\nThe novel is set in Penang in 1921 when Malaysia was part of the Straits Settlements. I love Penang; it is just like Phuket Old Town in architecture, food and culture only much, much larger. Add in the Roaring 20’s and W. Somerset Maugham and I am ready to dive in. . .\n\n02. Days of the Dead by Kersten Hamilton (published August 7, 2018) — “Magic flows through Epoch, New Mexico. It seeps from the bones of Puerta de la Luna, a village that was hundreds of years old before the United States invaded Mexico and took this territory for its own.”\n\nI am hoping to add this to the end of my October TBR and read it before los Días de los Muertos this year (November 1 and 2) along with another book I have on the folk art surrounding this holiday. I grew to love it more than Halloween when I lived in Bernalillo County, New Mexico.\n\n03. Hitchcock’s Blondes: The Unforgettable Women Behind the Legendary Director’s Dark Obsession by Laurence Leamer (published October 10, 2023) — “Bestselling author of Capote’s Women Laurence Leamer shares an engrossing account of the enigmatic director Alfred Hitchcock that finally puts the dazzling actresses he cast in his legendary movies at the center of the story.”\n\nI grew up watching classic movies with my mom. Hitchcock movies have always been high on my list of favorites. He always cast remarkable actors and actresses. The latter included such stars as Ingrid Bergman, Grace Kelly, Janet Leigh, Kim Novak, Eva Marie Saint, and Tippi Hedren.\n\n04. A Haunting on the Hill by Elizabeth Head (published October 3, 2023) — “From three-time Shirley Jackson, World Fantasy, and Nebula Award-winning author Elizabeth Hand comes the first-ever authorized novel to return to the world of Shirley Jackson’s The Haunting of Hill House: a suspenseful, contemporary, and terrifying story of longing and isolation all its own.”\n\nI just finished reading Shirley Jackson’s 1959 classic novel last week (LOVED it!). To stumble across this one today was eerie, to say the least.\n\n05. The Six: The Untold Story of America’s First Women Astronauts by Loren Grush (published September 12, 2023) — “In the bestselling tradition of Hidden Figures and Code Girls, the remarkable true story of America’s first women astronauts—six extraordinary women, each making history going to orbit aboard NASA’s Space Shuttle.”\n\nBooks about NASA and those pilots and astronauts who risked their lives in the pursuit of space exploration make up one of the largest collections in my eBook library. I have relatively few about NASA’s women and added this book to my Wish List as soon as I saw it in a publisher’s newsletter months ago.\n\n06. The Pale House Devil by Richard Kadrey (published October 3, 2023) — “A gripping, snappy creature feature from the master of horror noir about two detectives—one dead, one living—hired by an embittered old landowner to banish a bloody cosmic monster from his ancestral home, perfect for fans of Cassandra Khaw, Charles Stross and Lucy A. Snyder.”\n\nThis is a book lent to me by a friend; it’s fairly short so should be a quick read if it’s as good as my friend says it is.\n\n07. The Deep by Alma Katsu (published March 10, 2020) — “Someone, or something, is haunting the Titanic. This is the only way to explain the series of misfortunes that have plagued the passengers of the ship from the moment they set sail: mysterious disappearances, sudden deaths. Now suspended in an eerie, unsettling twilight zone during the four days of the liner’s illustrious maiden voyage, a number of the passengers – including millionaires Madeleine Astor and Benjamin Guggenheim, the maid Annie Hebbley and Mark Fletcher – are convinced that something sinister is going on . . . And then, as the world knows, disaster strikes. Years later and the world is at war. And a survivor of that fateful night, Annie, is working as a nurse on the sixth voyage of the Titanic’s sister ship, the Britannic, now refitted as a hospital ship. Plagued by the demons of her doomed first and near fatal journey across the Atlantic, Annie comes across an unconscious soldier she recognizes while doing her rounds. It is the young man Mark. And she is convinced that he did not – could not – have survived the sinking of the Titanic . . .”\n\nI have a huge library with both physical and virtual material about Titanic and other ocean liners including the first thriller that I ever read — Clive Cussler’s Raise the Titanic! — and a signed copy of Sir Walter Lord’s A Night to Remember. Both were obtained circa 1977-1978, long before Dr. Robert Ballard found the wreck on the ocean floor. This had been on my Wish List since the early days of the COVID pandemic — I tend to shy away from the paranormal and outright horror but I think that some of my recent reads are starting to change that.\n\n08. Be Useful: Seven Tools for Life by Arnold Schwarzenegger (published October 10, 2023) — “The seven rules to follow to realize your true purpose in life—distilled by Arnold Schwarzenegger from his own journey of ceaseless reinvention and extraordinary achievement, and available for absolutely anyone.”\n\nWhen I was a teenager and then at university, I saw a number of Arnold’s movies as they came out at the cinema. Some I liked, others not so much. There are probably quite a few of his biggest blockbusters that I never got around to seeing. I know absolutely nothing about his politics although he seemed to do a good job as California’s governor. I did see a few at-home videos he made during the lockdowns of 2020-2021 and perhaps one concerning the war in Ukraine. It seemed as if he was a solid voice of reason. I would like to learn what else he has to say and if any of his seven tools can be of some benefit to my own life.\n\n09. The Exchange: After the Firm by John Grisham (published October 17, 2023) — “New York Times bestselling author John Grisham delivers high-flying international suspense in a stunning new legal thriller that marks the return of Mitch McDeere, the brilliant hero of The Firm.”\n\nI read A Time to Kill and The Firm many, many years ago. I followed those by reading various other Grisham novels as they were released but lost track perhaps a decade ago. I have read a few since but probably missed others. I hope this new novel will inspire me to go back and fill the gaps in my reading.\n\n10. The Night House by Jo Nesbø (published May 30, 2023) –“From the internationally best-selling author, a twisted, multi-layered spin on the classic horror novel.”\n\nYeah, the publication date says May 30 and that is around the time I began looking for copies of this stand-alone novel in Thai bookshops and online retailers. I failed to notice until earlier this month that that was the date that the original Norwegian version — Natt-Husset — was released. Knopf’s hardcover finally became available on October 3.\n\nI have been a fan of Nesbø’s Harry Hole series since the lead singer of my favorite Kansas City-based band, The Rainmakers, mentioned that Nesbø was a fan of theirs. I lived in the KC area for years and saw this group of musicians near the beginning of their careers, playing sweaty gigs in local bars and on flatbed trucks in the middle of plowed cornfields. I was dismayed when they became superstars in Norway (even headlining a festival show over Bob Dylan). One can find reading recommendations from the strangest sources (another fan of The Rainmakers is Stephen King who even quoted some of their lyrics in one of his horror novels).\n\n11. Yellowface by R. F. Kuang (published May 25, 2023) — “With its totally immersive first-person voice, Yellowface takes on questions of diversity, racism, and cultural appropriation not only in the publishing industry but the persistent erasure of Asian-American voices and history by Western white society. R. F. Kuang’s novel is timely, razor-sharp, and eminently readable.”\n\nI discovered Kuang by listening to recommendations and then obtaining Babel. I still haven’t read that one but everyone started raving about Yellowface this spring so I figured I would add it to the Wish List. I only added it to my virtual stack this morning when I came across an anthology edited by her.\n\n12. The Best American Science Fiction and Fantasy 2023 edited by R. F. Kuang and John Joseph Adams (published October 17, 2023) — “A collection of the year’s best science fiction and fantasy writing selected by New York Times bestselling author R. F. Kuang and series editor John Joseph Adams. R. F. Kuang, New York Times bestselling author of the Poppy War trilogy and Babel, selects twenty pieces that represent the best examples of the form published the previous year and explores the ever-expanding and changing world of science fiction and fantasy today.”\n\nI need to read more sci fi and fantasy and short stories are a great way to sample genres that you are not that familiar with.\n\n13. Red River Seven by A. J. Ryan (published October 10, 2023) — “Internationally bestselling fantasy author Anthony Ryan – writing as A. J. Ryan – delivers a nerve-shredding thriller in which seven strangers must undertake a terrifying journey into the unknown.”\n\nThis was a book found when I was looking for something completely different but it sounded intriguing enough to give it a try.\n\n14. In These Hallowed Halls: A Dark Academia Anthology edited by Marie O’Regan and Paul Kane (published September 12, 2023) — “A beguiling, sinister collection of 12 dark academia short stories from masters of the genre, including Olivie Blake, M.L. Rio, Susie Yang and more!”\n\nI only recently became familiar with the label Dark Academia although I believe that I have read a number of books in the past that fall into this genre. I have watched a few BookTube videos recently reviewing such books and have walked away with a few good recommendations as a result. As mentioned, short stories are a great way to explore a genre outside of your realm of experience, particularly if the anthology is annotated in some way.\n\n15. The Yugo: The Rise and Fall of the Worst Car in History by Jason Vuic (published January 1, 2010) — “Six months after its American introduction in 1985, the Yugo was a punch line; within a year, it was a staple of late-night comedy. By 2000, NPR’s Car Talk declared it “the worst car of the millennium.” And for most Americans that’s where the story begins and ends. Hardly. The short, unhappy life of the car, the men who built it, the men who imported it, and the decade that embraced and discarded it is rollicking and astounding, and one of the greatest untold business-cum-morality tales of the 1980s. Mix one rabid entrepreneur, several thousand “good” communists, a willing U.S. State Department, the shortsighted Detroit auto industry, and improvident bankers, shake vigorously, and you’ve got The Yugo: The Rise and Fall of the Worst Car in History.”\n\nBack when I was a poor and starving university student in need of a cheap car, I attempted to test-drive a Yugo. I never got it out of the car dealer’s lot. The gas gauge went from full to empty moments after getting the engine started. When I tried to roll down the window to tell the salesman, the handle came off in my hand. Then the driver’s side door wouldn’t open so I had to crawl over the seat and exit out of the passenger side. It was comical. I never thought there could ever be a book about this car but here it is, found when not seeking.\n\nI bought a Ford Festiva that served me well for many years, including several trips from central New Mexico to the highest paved road in the Rocky Mountains and back east to Kansas. I loved the Festiva. I wonder if they ever fixed that Yugo enough for somebody to buy it.\n\n16. Split Tooth by Tanya Tagaq (published September 25, 2018) — “From the internationally acclaimed Inuit throat singer who has dazzled and enthralled the world with music it had never heard before, a fierce, tender, heartbreaking story unlike anything you’ve ever read. Fact can be as strange as fiction. It can also be as dark, as violent, as rapturous. In the end, there may be no difference between them. . . . Veering back and forth between the grittiest features of a small arctic town, the electrifying proximity of the world of animals, and ravishing world of myth, Tanya Tagaq explores a world where the distinctions between good and evil, animal and human, victim and transgressor, real and imagined lose their meaning, but the guiding power of love remains. Haunting, brooding, exhilarating, and tender all at once, Tagaq moves effortlessly between fiction and memoir, myth and reality, poetry and prose, and conjures a world and a heroine readers will never forget.”\n\nI think the first of Tanya Tagaq’s albums I came across was probably Retribution from 2016 with its Nirvana cover. The music (and her voice) just blew me away; I have long been a fan of indigenous sounds but this was something else entirely. I picked up her novel this morning as I was looking for some fiction set in the Arctic tundra for a Reading Challenge I am thinking of doing in 2024.\n\n17. How the Penguins Saved Veronica by Hazel Prior (published March 5, 2020) — “A curmudgeonly but charming old woman, her estranged grandson, and a colony of penguins proves it’s never too late to be the person you want to be in this rich, heartwarming story from the acclaimed author of Ellie and the Harpmaker.”\n\nThis is another book found when looking for titles to fit in with a 2024 Reading Challenge, this time set in Antarctica. I love penguins. . .\n\n18. The Ice Star by Christoffer Petersen (published January 26, 2017) — “The Ice Star is the first book in Christoffer Petersen’s adrenaline-fueled Greenland thriller series. If you like Matthew Reilly’s Scarecrow Series and Bear Grylls’ Will Jaeger books then you’ll love Christoffer Petersen’s raw action thriller.”\n\nIt sounds like my intended Reading Challenge will start off on a very cold and icy arc. Stayed tuned as this may either be one I do solo or I one I host. . . .\n\n19. Classic Christmas Crime Stories edited by David Stuart Davies (published October 17, 2023) — “Christmas is not always the season of goodwill. As this hugely entertaining collection shows, it can also be the season of mysterious deaths, hidden poison bottles and blunt instruments…”\n\nI love mysteries set around Christmastime. I made my acting debut as Jacob Marley in a school production of A Christmas Carol by Charles Dickens. I was 5 or 6 years old. I don’t think I got around to reading the novella until many years later; I certainly saw the 1938 film version before I read the book. All of those memories came at me when I saw this book available. It is firmly at the top of my December TBR.\n\n20. We Are Not Alone: The Extraordinary History of UFOs and Aliens Invading Our Hopes, Fears, and Fantasies by Marc Hartzman (published October 17, 2023) — “Do you want to believe? Explore our fascination with UFOs and extraterrestrial intelligence through exclusive interviews, archival photos, and strange but true stories from history. After decades of cover-ups and denials, in a June 2021 report, the US government finally admitted what many people already yes, UFOs are real, and no, we don’t know what (or who) they are. Writer and historian Marc Hartzman separates fact from fiction and provides a comprehensive tour through the skies. Deeply researched and highly entertaining, We Are Not Alone will inform and enchant anyone who’s ever doubted that we are really alone in the universe.”\n\nWhile not really a believer of UFOs and Little Green Men for much of my life, I have long been confident that there is something else out there. I felt that we just haven’t found those other life forms yet nor have they found us. Still, I loved films such as 2001: A Space Odyssey, Close Encounters of the Third Kind, E.T., Contact, the list goes on. I always tuned-into The X-Files when it was on TV. I supposed I wanted to believe but kept my thoughts internal. For example, I never visited the town of Roswell despite living just 200 miles away for nearly 12 years! The various governmental announcements and hearings of the pat year or so have caught me unprepared and rendered me amazed. I am looking forward to reading this book in an attempt to make sense of it all, to “separate fact from fiction”.\n\nWhew! That’s quite a book haul to start my “Stacking the Shelves” participation. I really cannot do that many each week but it surely was fun writing about my new books. Now, it’s time to read; I am currently making my way through Silvia Moreno-Garcia’s Mexican Gothic — and will soon be completely creeped-out, according to a few of my friends not to mention various BookTubers — but that is for a different post.\n\nPlease let me know in the comments if you have read any of these twenty books or if the blurbs have enticed you to add any to your own TBRs.\n\nHappy Reading!"
