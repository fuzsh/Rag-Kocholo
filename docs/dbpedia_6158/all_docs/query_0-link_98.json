        "text": "Nuremberg, Germany – 26 September 2019 – Paessler today announces the appointment of Helmut Binder as CEO\n\nfollowing the voluntary departure of Christian Twardawa at the end of this month.\n\nBinder joins the company from the IT Services and Software specialist Materna, based in Dortmund, where he held the\n\nposition of CEO for over four years, taking over from the two founders in 2015. Helmut Binder studied Economics in\n\nCologne, Germany and Tokyo, Japan. He has been working in the IT industry for 15 years and has spent the majority of hiscareer working in international markets.\n\nAs he takes the helm at Paessler, Binder will be looking to build on the identification of new customer segments including the growth of the new PRTG PLUS subscription model, offering flexible monitoring for large IT environments with more than 5,000 users, or devices.\n\nHelmut Binder, CEO Paessler: “Our goal for the future is to develop and launch new solutionsfor our customersin the classic IT environment, as well as new markets such as IoT, which shows enormous potential. The expansion of our offering into market segments such as environmental monitoring, healthcare and Smart City, allow usto contribute to some of the biggest global challenges of our time. But even in the pursuit of further growth, we will never neglect the ambition of our founder Dirk: to build the company we want to work for.\n\n“During the past 20 years, Paessler has successfully positioned itself as an independent German software company in the\n\ninternational monitoring market. I’m looking forward to stepping into my new role as CEO of Paessler and actively\n\ncontributing to its success and future development. I value the unique culture of privately owned companies, as agile\n\nteams with the freedom to innovate seem to develop the best products. I’m very pleased to find this kind of work culture at Paessler.”"
