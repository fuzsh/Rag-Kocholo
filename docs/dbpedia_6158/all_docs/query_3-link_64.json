        "text": "Paessler AG, a world leader in network monitoring tools, today announced the company has made available a new whitepaper titled, “Server Virtualization and Network Management” to help IT managers use network monitoring to continue to achieve results from virtualized environments.\n\nAvailable free as a download, the whitepaper outlines the impact server virtualization has on network management and provides examples on how IT organizations can use Paessler’s Network Monitor software to efficiently utilize resources in the planning, testing and ongoing management of virtualized environments by offering more detailed visibility into critical parts of their networks.”\n\n“A highly virtualized environment lives or dies on the efficiency and dependability of its data network,” said Dirk Paessler, founder and CEO of Paessler AG. “Paessler’s network management tools can provide vital information for planning and testing virtualized environments, helping organizations monitor critical network resources and detect systems failures or performance problems immediately, minimizing downtime and its economic impact.”\n\nThe whitepaper provides an overview of how server virtualization works and its benefits and best practices to optimize virtual environments and streamline management using network monitoring, including:\n\n- Problem solving and remediation: Network and device failure in a highly virtualized environment could have significant impact on network and application availability. Effective, ongoing network monitoring can provide instant notification of the failure of a Windows server or its network connection, allowing IT to take immediate action to minimize the impact.\n\n- Traffic analysis and bandwidth: Virtualized environments cannot tolerate network overloads or switch failures. Ongoing, comprehensive traffic analysis can provide long-term usage projections and help network managers anticipate traffic increases before they impact service levels.\n\n- Application ranking and identification: Identifying which applications should remain on dedicated servers or virtualized servers is not easy. The volume and character of transmissions to and from these applications help identify the best approach. Network management tools, specifically monitoring and analysis, provide visibility into vital information about critical application performance and use."
