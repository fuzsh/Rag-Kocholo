        "text": "We move into the period full of confidence and with a new company purpose, worded in July 2020, that is dedicated to a very important cause. Here is why we do what we do every day: We believe monitoring plays a vital part in reducing humankind's consumption of resources. Monitoring data helps our customers save resources, from optimizing their IT, OT, and IoT infrastructures, to reducing energy consumption or emissions. For our future and our environment.\n\nFrom this purpose, we derive our vision: In a complex world of connected devices and data, Paessler is the customers’ choice to monitor “every thing”. Even though our founder, Dirk, is no longer active in the day-to-day business of the company, he is still a core inspiration behind our company purpose, and he supports us wherever possible in the execution of our strategy for sustainability.\n\nIn fact, climate change is a topic that has strongly motivated Dirk for many years. And, of course, we are keen not only to encourage others to monitor and reconsider their use of resources, but also to take some concrete practical steps ourselves. From 2020 we are completely CO₂ neutral, and it is our declared goal to become climate positive soon.\n\nFrom 2022 onward, we will no longer purchase natural gas but will instead rely entirely on biogas. Together with our partners and customers, we increasingly address the urgent issues of resource efficiency and the sustainable, intelligent use of resources.\n\nIn addition to our purpose alignment, there has also been a change on Paessler's Management Board. At the beginning of 2022, Joachim Weber took over the position of CTO from Steven Feurer, who has left a positive mark on Paessler's software with his innovative mindset.\n\nOur quest for innovation, which has steadily grown stronger since 2016, starts showing results. In addition to the established options and solutions for traditional IT with PRTG, we now offer a wide range of customized solutions for several industries.\n\nThese industries include the healthcare and manufacturing sectors as well as education, finance, government, and CCTV. Each sector has its own requirements and challenges. PRTG has everything you need to monitor your business' IT and more, regardless of whether you are an admin in a large company, a clinic, or a factory. The last point includes extensive possibilities for monitoring IT/OT convergence, the merging of production technology and classic IT.\n\nNot only the type of industry places particular demands on monitoring; the complexity of the environment to be monitored matters as well. With Paessler PRTG Enterprise Monitor, we now offer scalable monitoring for large IT infrastructures. It’s a solution that does not have to compromise.\n\nPRTG Enterprise Monitor scales to large IT environments with thousands of devices and systems across multiple locations, providing an easy way to gain visibility and control of increasingly complex structures. Meanwhile, our global workforce grows rapidly and exceeds 300 employees in 2019.\n\nIn October 2019, Christian Twardawa, who had managed Paessler through the “Big Change” after Dirk’s withdrawal as CEO, stepped down. He agreed with Dirk that Paessler would now need someone from the outside, a proven leader with experience in guiding established IT companies to new horizons. They found this person in Helmut Binder, who previously was CEO of Materna, a global German IT service provider with more than 2,000 employees. Helmut took over the role as CEO from Christian, who left Paessler after more than 16 years. We will miss Christian and wish him all the best for his future projects. And we’re looking forward to the next step in the evolution of Paessler…\n\n2017 was a special year for Paessler. The company celebrated its 20th birthday and reinforced its position as a global leader in the field of network monitoring. This milestone was a testament to its founder, Dirk Paessler, who, with his visionary thinking and drive for technology, played a pivotal role in the success of the company.\n\nJanuary 2018 saw Dirk step down as CEO to make way for a new CEO, Christian Twardawa, who had led the company alongside Dirk as COO for almost 15 years. And although Dirk’s daily presence was missed, he remained connected to the company as Chairman of the Supervisory Board.\n\nAnother change in 2018 was the appointment of Steven Feurer as the new CTO. Steven has a strong startup and innovation history. The new management team began a period of growth and investment in new market segments, as Paessler entered the healthcare monitoring industry and strongly positioned itself to provide innovative solutions in the IoT space. Paessler also launched a successful alliance partner program, which promotes cooperation with industry-leading IT vendors on complementary and integrated solutions that create additional benefits for our customers.\n\nIn 2019, PRTG was recognized as customers’ choice for the Gartner peer insights for IT Infrastructure Monitoring Tools and for Network Performance Monitoring and Diagnostics. Paessler realized that PRTG is no longer just a monitoring tool for small- to medium-sized businesses, but that IT teams in the enterprise space could also benefit from an easy-to-use and affordable monitoring solution. Paessler drew the obvious conclusion and introduced Paessler PRTG Enterprise Monitor (formerly known as PRTG PLUS) – a subscription-based offering for scaling PRTG horizontally for large environments.\n\nAnd, showing that we truly know how to scale, Paessler hit the 250 employees mark in early 2019!\n\nThe next relocation is due in 2011: a move just a few blocks down to a generous, completely renovated industrial loft. Just like before, Paessler continues its philosophy of doing everything that serves the customer and drives the business forward – development, support, marketing, and distribution – itself, rather than passing these on to outsiders. But this also means that the company is “forced” into rapid growth due to constantly growing demand. The \"Paessler Spirit\" that Dirk lives for, that fulfills and drives him and spills over to employees, makes it possible to integrate new colleagues into the company almost seamlessly.\n\nPRTG Network Monitor is becoming a global brand, and the Paessler company is becoming a real “global player,” thanks to its steadily growing presence at international conventions and trade shows. This is where the target demographic becomes clearly defined. PRTG Network Monitor offers professional IT monitoring for small and mid-sized networks. Top priorities are operability, flexibility, and fun in software. The user should enjoy working with PRTG.\n\nIn 2014, Paessler exceeds the 100-employee mark. The new office isn’t looking nearly as big anymore, and the search for a new building begins. In 2015, a suitable new office is found. A four-story office building in an industrial park in the northeast of Nuremberg, with space for up to 400 employees. In April of 2016, the number of employees moving to the new Nuremberg location is almost 170. And blazing full steam ahead...\n\nIn 2007, the office has gotten too small again. Paessler moves from Fürth to Nuremberg, within walking distance of Nuremberg Castle. Office space triples. The first US sales representatives are hired.\n\nIn 2008, PRTG Traffic Grapher 6 and IPCheck Server Monitor are converted into a single solution, and PRTG Network Monitor 7 is born – a modern and comprehensive monitoring solution that supervises availability as well as performance. The “new” PRTG Network Monitor 7 is chosen firsthand by Germany’s Network Computing as a reference for monitoring software. “For anyone looking for a heavily equipped, easy-to-use, yet cost-effective monitoring product, and who wants to support the local industry besides, Paessler’s PRTG Network Monitor is strongly recommended.” Meanwhile, Paessler keeps growing more and more:\n\nIn 2011, there are 35 employees and the office that still feels new is already getting tight again.\n\nPaessler grows, and the community office is getting a bit cramped. Time for the first office to call our own, located in the heart of Fürth. In October of 2003, Christian Twardawa enters Paessler. He is initially responsible for marketing, sales and finance – together with Dirk, Christian will have a decisive influence on the further development of the company. In the course of the next few years, the company increases to 10 employees, financed by steadily increasing revenue, and produces the Webserver Stress Tool, IPCheck Server Monitor, and PRTG Traffic Grapher.\n\nDirk doesn’t want to create a “normal” company, he wants a community of highly qualified and engaged experts all working towards one goal – creating outstanding software, and a company that’s more than just a workplace to its staff. In 2005, Dirk turns Paessler GmbH into Paessler AG, to make it easier for his employees to participate in the business.\n\nOn August 22, 2001, Dirk founds Paessler GmbH, the predecessor of Paessler AG. The company works out of Dirk’s living room, in an office community. With Roland Grau, another developer is added to the group, and Paessler becomes three.\n\nThe company’s growing IT infrastructure is causing more and more trouble. Performance monitoring software is a must-have to find the causes behind the problems. Dirk downloads the then-popular open source tool MRTG (Multi Router Traffic Grapher).\n\nHowever, the launch of MRTG falters before it can even get started. Dirk refuses to install a piece of software for which the installation guide is 7 pages long.\n\n“There’s got to be an easier way!!”\n\nThis becomes the “birth hour” of PRTG. Dirk programs the third piece of Paessler software, the PRTG Traffic Grapher. Even though PRTG appeals to a completely different target group today, we are still besieged with questions about MRTG and if PRTG is an MRTG spinoff. The answer is a resounding no. The source code of PRTG has nothing to do with MRTG; it only inspired the choice of name for us."
