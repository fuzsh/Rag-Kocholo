        "text": "Turn/River Capital has announced a strategic investment in Paessler AG, a provider of IT and OT monitoring solutions. The investment represents a significant milestone in Paessler’s growth trajectory.\n\nHelmut Binder, CEO of Paessler AG, expressed his enthusiasm for the partnership in a statement. “Joining forces with Turn/River opens up new opportunities for Paessler. We will be able to scale even faster and increase our ability to add value to current and future customers with their expertise in operations and strategic market expansion,” he said.\n\nPaessler AG was founded in 1997. Since then, the company has focused on developing innovative monitoring solutions for companies of all sizes and in all sectors. The company’s flagship product, PRTG Network Monitor, has amassed an impressive user base of more than 500,000 users worldwide. This user base underscores Paessler’s key role in optimizing IT, OT and IoT infrastructures worldwide, the company said.\n\n“We turned a bedroom project into a global success with no roots in Silicon Valley, growing to hundreds of thousands of customers through the dedication of our team alone. Over the years, around 100 individual shareholders have helped shape our company, and I will always be grateful for their trust,” said Dirk Paessler, founder of Paessler AG, reflecting on the company’s journey and its future prospects. He added that the next exciting chapter in the company’s growth will be catalyzed by the partnership with Turn/River Capital.\n\nBased in San Francisco, Turn/River Capital prides itself on scaling software companies in a capital-efficient manner. The investment firm takes a hands-on approach that goes beyond financial support to provide significant operational support in areas such as sales, marketing, customer success and talent acquisition. This strategy is designed to take its software companies to new levels of growth, with a particular focus on European companies looking to expand into the North American and global markets.\n\nJoanne Yuan, investment partner at Turn/River Capital, also commented on the partnership. “Paessler represents exactly the kind of software leader we are looking for: innovative and driven, with the ability to accelerate the development of its enterprise platform and expand into new markets. This is not just an investment, but a partnership aimed at promoting significant growth and realizing the full potential of Paessler’s impressive product set on a global scale,” he said.\n\nThe partnership is expected to have a positive impact on Paessler’s ability to enhance its value proposition to current and future customers. Both companies are committed to leveraging their combined expertise and resources to achieve significant growth and positively impact the global technology landscape."
