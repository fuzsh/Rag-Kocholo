This includes those who oversee networks for business operations, operate and maintain video surveillance systems, and make sure headquarters and branch offices enjoy flawless communication with one another.\n\n“The first step to ensure the 100 percent uptime of critical infrastructure is to have visibility over it,” said Andrew Cutting, director of channel sales for North America at Paessler. “We look forward to empowering federal agencies to address any issues that arise in their networks before they become a problem – and in the event something fails, have the insights in front of them they need to determine the root cause and a fix with unprecedented speed.”\n\nFollow Paessler on social media: Facebook, Twitter, Google+ and LinkedIn\n\nAbout Paessler AG\n\nPaessler AG’s award winning PRTG Network Monitor is a powerful, affordable and easy-to-use Unified Monitoring solution.
