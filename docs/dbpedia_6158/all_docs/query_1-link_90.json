        "text": "German-headquartered network monitoring software provider Paessler is looking to grow its local channel to around 120 parties by the end of 2013.\n\nThe company, which has previously operated direct, had come to realise the channel was the only way to expand its market share, said newly appointed channel director, Andrew Timms.\n\n“We currently have 42 partners in Australia, and with a head office in Germany we have been doing our best to push ourselves in the market, however we have come to realise we need to expand the channel footprint if we are going to grow.”\n\nTimms said the company is putting in place extensive channel programs, including financial and co-operative marketing incentive programs. “It’s a matter of finding the right partners to work with.”\n\nHe said the company would seek out new partners through trade show representation, as well as direct marketing and an outreach through appropriate media channels.\n\nPaessler was founded in Germany in 1997, and has 150,000 active installations of its products across 150 countries. Paessler’s monitoring solution, PRTG Network Monitor, can be installed within minutes and offers more than 190 pre-built sensors specifically designed to monitor bandwidth, availability, websites, email, and virtual environments, including cloud."
