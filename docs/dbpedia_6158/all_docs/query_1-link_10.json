My book about the history, culture and future of Paessler AG, the company I founded 23 years ago in my student flat, is finished.\n\nThis is the description from the back of the book:\n\n„This is a book about the story of Paessler AG which was founded by Dirk Paessler in 1997 in his student flat. Over the years it became a medium- sized company with customers all over the world. At the same time, the team developed a special corporate culture that always wanted to achieve more than “just” economic success. From the beginning the Paesslerists had the goal of “building the company we want to work for.”\n\nThe number of employees doubled about every two years – and at some point the founder had to admit to himself and everyone else: I’m not made for this company size. But instead of leaving and selling the company Dirk Paessler chose a different path: New Paesslerists took over the day-to-day business while he remains the entrepreneur and chairman of the supervisory board.\n\nA book about starting a company, cultivating corporate culture, and finding one’s role in the world.“\n\nDo you want to read the book?\n\nThe book is not (yet) available in book stores. But you can get your copy. Here is how: Send an email with your receipt of a donation to Project Vesta or a subscription from the Climeworks shop for €20/US$20 or more to ich-will-das-buch@dirkpaessler.com, and I will send you the PDF file of the book.\n\nThis way you are supporting two climate projects that we also support with our climate startup Carbon Drawdown Initiative after careful consideration. Both are developing technologies for “negative emissions” which we will need to solve the climate crisis (more information)."
