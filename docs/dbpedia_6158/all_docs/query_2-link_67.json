        "text": "Review:\n\nPros: Easy implementation process. Offers powerful features that are constantly improving.\n\nCons: When you use more than 5,000 sensors, you need to use 5-minute intervals or longer, instead of the usual 1-minute intervals.\n\nReputation: Solid option! Easy to set up with comprehensive features. However, the UI is not user-friendly.\n\nHow much does Paessler PRTG cost?\n\nPaessler PRTG'S plans start at $1,799.00 per server license for the PRTG network monitoring range and $1,599.00 per year for the hosted monitoring solution. The company also offers monthly payment plans for the Hosted range, as well as an Enterprise plan that starts at $16,600.00 per year."
