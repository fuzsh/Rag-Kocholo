        "text": "Paessler AG has acquired qbilon GmbH, a company that provides a platform for automatically capturing, analyzing and optimizing hybrid IT landscapes.\n\nThe acquisition is in line with Paesslerâ€™s long-term growth plans to provide the best possible IT, OT, and IoT monitoring solutions to its customers and to further enlarge its footprint, especially in the large-scale enterprise segment, with new product offerings.\n\nqbilon was founded in 2019 by four computer science research fellows at the University of Augsburg and retains its headquarters in Augsburg, Germany. A number of well-known companies from the automotive, utility and manufacturing industries, including KTR Systems, are currently using qbilonULTIMATE to analyze, optimize and govern their IT landscapes.\n\nThrough the acquisition, Paessler will add IT transparency solutions to its extensive portfolio of service offerings. This involves exploiting, combining and analyzing data sets within a customer's entire IT landscape, bringing additional value from architecture management and cost management to IT governance and security aspects. qbilon offers integration with a wide range of data sources, including, for example, cloud platforms like AWS or Azure, IT monitoring and management solutions, like Paessler PRTG or Dynatrace, and virtualization tools like vSphere. Customers can also import generic data, like CSV or JSON, for easy integration of legacy information. For companies this means full transparency of their complete IT environment and more resilience in their IT operations, with a choice of cloud or on-premises solutions."
