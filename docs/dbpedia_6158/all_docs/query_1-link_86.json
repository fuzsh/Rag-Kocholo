        "text": "Paessler has unveiled its new CEO and leader, following the departure of former CEO Christian Twardara.\n\nHelmut Binder, who joins Paessler from IT service provider Materna, will be responsible for expanding Paessler's product offerings and for expanding Paessler's business into ASEAN markets.\n\n“Our goal for the future is to develop and launch new solutions for our customers in the classic IT environment, as well as new markets such as IoT, which shows enormous potential,” says Binder.\n\n“The expansion of our offering into market segments such as environmental monitoring, healthcare and Smart City, allowing us to contribute to some of the biggest global challenges of our time. But even in the pursuit of further growth, we will never neglect the ambition of our founder Dirk: to build the company we want to work for.\n\nBinder was previously CEO of Materna for more than four years, after taking over from the two founders in 2015. Helmut Binder studied Economics in Cologne, Germany and Tokyo, Japan.\n\nHe has been working in the IT industry for 15 years and has spent the majority of his career working in international markets.\n\n“During the past 20 years, Paessler has successfully positioned itself as an independent German software company in the international monitoring market,” continues Binder.\n\n“I'm looking forward to stepping into my new role as CEO of Paessler and actively contributing to its success and future development. I value the unique culture of privately owned companies, as agile teams with freedom to innovate seem to develop the best products. I'm very pleased to find this kind of work culture at Paessler.\n\nBinder will be looking to build on the identification of new customer segments including the growth of the new PRTG PLUS subscription model, offering flexible monitoring for large IT environments with more than 5,000 users, or devices.\n\n\"We are very pleased that we were able to hire Helmut Binder to head up our company. His solid background in managing, growing and developing international IT organisations will make a significant contribution to shaping Paessler AG's overall development and international growth,” comments Paessler Supervisory Board founder and chairman Dirk Paessler."
