        "text": "Since 1997, we offer monitoring solutions for businesses across all industries and all sizes, from SMB to large enterprises. Today, more than 500,000 users in over 170 countries rely on PRTG and other Paessler solutions to monitor their complex IT, OT and IoT infrastructures. We believe monitoring plays a vital part in reducing humankind’s consumption of resources. Our products help our customers optimize their IT, OT and IoT infrastructures, and reduce their energy consumption or emissions – for our future and our environment.\n\nWhy we do it\n\nWe believe monitoring plays a vital part in reducing humankind’s consumption of resources. Monitoring data helps our customers save resources, from optimizing their IT, OT and IoT infrastructures, to reducing energy consumption or emissions. For our future and our environment.\n\nHow we do it\n\nWe know the challenges of complex IT infrastructures and networks. Since 1997, we have combined our in-depth monitoring knowledge with an innovative spirit. More recently, we expanded from IT into the OT and IoT spaces. Our products empower our customers to monitor everything, and thus help them optimize their resources.\n\nWhat we do\n\nWe offer monitoring solutions for businesses across all industries and all sizes, from SMB to large enterprises. We work together with renowned partners, and together we tackle the monitoring challenges of an ever-changing world.\n\nMonitoring plays a vital part in reducing humankind’s consumption of resources. We help our customers reducetheir energy consumption or emissions.We move into the period full of confidence and with a new company purpose, worded in July 2020, that is dedicated to a very important cause. Here is why we do what we do every day: We believe monitoring plays a vital part in reducing humankind’s consumption of resources. Monitoring data helps our customers save resources, from optimizing their IT, OT, and IoT infrastructures, to reducing energy consumption or emissions. For our future and our environment.\n\nFrom this purpose, we derive our vision: In a complex world of connected devices and data, Paessler is the customers’ choice to monitor “every thing”. Even though our founder, Dirk, is no longer active in the day-to-day business of the company, he is still a core inspiration behind our company purpose, and he supports us wherever possible in the execution of our strategy for sustainability.\n\nIn fact, climate change is a topic that has strongly motivated Dirk for many years. And, of course, we are keen not only to encourage others to monitor and reconsider their use of resources, but also to take some concrete practical steps ourselves. From 2020 we are completely CO₂ neutral, and it is our declared goal to become climate positive soon.\n\nFrom 2022 onward, we will no longer purchase natural gas but will instead rely entirely on biogas. Together with our partners and customers, we increasingly address the urgent issues of resource efficiency and the sustainable, intelligent use of resources.\n\nIn addition to our purpose alignment, there has also been a change on Paessler’s Management Board. At the beginning of 2022, Joachim Weber took over the position of CTO from Steven Feurer, who has left a positive mark on Paessler’s software with his innovative mindset."
