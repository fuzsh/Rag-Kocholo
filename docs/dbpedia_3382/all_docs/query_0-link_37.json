        "text": "On May 26, 2009, President Obama announced that he would nominate Sonia Sotomayor to be an Associate Justice of the United States Supreme Court. The Judiciary Committee hearing to consider the nomination was held from July 13-16, 2009. The Judiciary Committee reported the nomination to the Senate for consideration on July 28, 2009. The Senate confirmed the nomination on August 6, 2009.\n\nJustice Sotomayor was born on June 25, 1954, in New York City. She earned her B.A. from Princeton University in 1976, and in 1979, graduated from Yale Law School. She worked as an assistant district attorney from the New York County District Attorney's Office from 1979 to 1984. Judge Sotomayor worked in private practice from 1984 until 1992. She was nominated by President George H.W. Bush to a seat on the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York, a seat to which she was confirmed in 1992. In 1998, after being nominated by President Bill Clinton, Sotomayor was confirmed to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit.\n\nA transcript of the hearing, including the Committee Questionnaire, responses to questions submitted for the record, and letters received in connection with the nomination is available through the Government Printing Office."
