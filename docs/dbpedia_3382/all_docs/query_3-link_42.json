Originally launched with a single U-12 team in 2016, the LAFC Academy not only allows greater access to the game, but is guided by a collection of globally successful coaches and leaders. LAFCâs academy now features seven age groups, U-11 through U-19. Although still young, the academy has already won a CONCACAF championship, has provided LAFC's senior team with its first Homegrown players, and has sent multiple players to their countries' youth national teams."
