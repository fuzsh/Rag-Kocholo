        "text": "Background\n\nAlex Morgan is a household name in the female soccer world, and she has inspired millions to fall in love with the beautiful game. She’s had her challenges but has held her head high, and continued undeterred. Morgan was born in San Dimas, California, United States to her parents, Michael and Pamela Morgan. She is of Welsh, German, and English descent. Her father introduced her to soccer when he engaged her with the American Youth Soccer Organization (A.Y.S.O.). When she was 14, she joined Cypress Elite; at this point, she also played for the Olympic Development Program (O.D.P.) regional and state teams. Her success with the O.D.P. resulted in her being drafted to the United States under-20 women’s national soccer team.\n\nIn 2006, she sustained a nasty injury while playing with a male team, and it ruled her out till 2008. She attended U.C. Berkeley from 2007 to 2010 and played for the California Golden Bears, where she scored the third most goals despite her national team commitments. She was the first overall pick by the Western New York Flash. As a result, she became the first California Golden Bears player to be drafted in the first round of the Women’s Professional Soccer (W.P.S.) selection. After the W.P.S. stopped operations, Morgan joined the Seattle Sounders in 2012. While on the team, she represented the United States in the London 2012 Olympics, where the team won a gold medal. She also won her first world cup in 2015 with the United States national team.\n\nShe was traded to Orlando in 2016 and spent one year with the team before moving on to the French team, Lyon. She immediately made an impact by being part of the team and even scored a hat-trick in a game. However, she moved back to Orlando in 2017 after just one season. In 2019, she won her second world cup with the United States national team. Morgan has won it all in women’s soccer."
