        "text": "You are a solitary person, who is sometimes withdrawn and has a fairly cold and nonchalant personality. Although you are introverted, you are extremely rational. You are wary of the outer world, your senses, and even your intellect, because they might all be sources of illusion. Your quest for identity with a spiritual whole gives you a voracious appetite for ideologies, structures, and theories. Readings which others would find abstract and intellectual impress you as reflections of important and lively realities. As a result, you have a penchant for reflection and philosophical study. You are intrigued by difficult problems and enjoy solving them. There is no difficulty which can discourage you from the goal you have decided to reach for yourself. Your depth of vision, common sense, and caution, your tendency to be a bit calculating and sometimes conservative, your stamina, and your independent mind all give you the ability to tackle difficult tasks. Your concentration gives you an undeniable gift for abstraction and conjecture. As a theoretician, you aim to discover what is essential and universal. Indeed, you seek to go beyond what is relative, contingent upon circumstances, or inadequate, to reach the absolute truth you fervently desire. Your budding intuition is extremely receptive to the sacred or holy. As a result, the ideal or cause you espouse will be related to the concept of universality or totality. Since your lifetime adventure is based in part on this absolute truth, it is important for you to make an effort to define its nature. What sort of universality are you striving for; what spiritual Everest (in yourself or outwardly) are you trying to scale? In fact, you tend to like mountain climbing, because of the effort it requires. It’s a great joy for you. Alone at the peak, you can contemplate and understand everything. In pursuit of this absolute center (positive or negative) which animates you, you are shrewd and persistent. Stamina and endurance are resources of which you are quite confident. Your existence and organism are arranged to optimize them; others may consider you slow, but you are really just playing it safe, because, unconsciously, you know time is on your side. When you take an initiative, it is after careful forethought and preparation. Your great composure, ability to resist and overcome obstacles and wickedness, and your foresight give you a great potential to accomplish total self-control. However, you must beware of one pitfall: excess. You tend to be a bit too rigid and intolerant; in intellectual pursuits, you\n\nAlexandra Orlando yearns for a purpose in life, even faraway or abstract.\n\nAlexandra Orlando’s psychological, metaphysical, or occult interests are signs that she needs to transform or change herself. This might cause some apprehension in her.\n\nAt the time of your birth, your rising sign was located in Taurus (the Bull), while the sun was passing through the sign of Capricorn (the Goat). Both are ruled by the element earth, which augurs a certain cohesiveness for your personality. A summary of the various clues mentioned above provide your personality profile. The following key words capture the essence of your character and indicate certain contradictions which may create tension: Deliberation – Opposition to progress – Need for security – Compassion – Inhibition – Perseverance – Application – Pragmatism – Methodical mind – Productivity – Foresight – Sensuality – Loyalty.\n\nThe extreme steadiness, loyalty, and tenacity of your character endow you with the ability to organize your work meticulously and work with a power and purposefulness that no obstacle can impede. Your energy comes to the forefront especially when the people around you encounter difficulties or crises. Your attachment to material possessions, which procure for you the stability and security you need, leave you little freedom to enjoy surprises and changes in your routine. Despite a penchant for sorrow, nostalgia, and solitude, you are fairly amiable and willing to help others. Emotionally, you will commit yourself only after serious deliberation, but your love is steady and profound.\n\nAlexandra Orlando was born on the night of a full moon, between 3 and 7 days after the new moon. She is a “shining moon” type, which means that she has a personality that is apt to communicate and transmit ideas. Throughout her life, she will be attracted to the idea of acting as a spokesperson for a cause, idea, or person whose message seems essential to her. She will have to develop her powers of discernment, to determine which subjects or people are really worth her personal commitment.\n\nThis relationship has the potential to be very compatible and attractive. The physical and psychological reality of your personality will have a powerful magnetic pull over the sensitivity, receptivity, tenderness, and other key qualities of your partner.\n\nAlexandra Orlando’s moon is located at 21° VIRGO. Her ideal match is a partner with the sun at 15/27° VIRGO or PISCES.\n\nAlexandra Orlando would be particularly well-matched to someone who mirrors her underlying psychic and unconscious aspirations. The secret ideal you cherish of the perfect partner would be aroused; it would harmonize beautifully with your ideal imaginary lover. This great psychic compatibility is the result of a harmonious relationship between the Moon of the masculine chart and the sun of the feminine one. It is propitious to a rich flow of energies between the most hidden and secret parts of both people. They are linked by an unconscious emotional bond.\n\nAlexandra Orlando’s Venus is located at 12° SAGITTARIUS. Her ideal match is a partner with Mars at 6/18° SAGITTARIUS or GEMINI.\n\nAlexandra Orlando would find a partner who complemented her perfectly in emotional and sentimental terms. This person would reflect and fulfill her ideal of sensuality to the greatest degree. Moreover, Alexandra Orlando’s ideal partner would resonate lastingly with her own psychic projections of her ideal. This positive relationship between the unconscious sexual yearnings of both partners would be likely to yield sensual relations of a tantalizingly mysterious and secret nature.\n\nAlexandra Orlando is idealistic in her romantic aspirations. She has high standards. As a result, she will not settle down immediately. However, once she finds the partner of her dreams, she is loyal, frank, and generous with herself. She would be especially likely to choose this type of mate. They are also frank and direct and have strong idealistic aspirations and a marked taste for intellectual speculation and philosophy. Their firm sense of ethics does not rule out pleasure or fun. Fit and athletic, they will also enjoy the social whirl and will have high social ambitions.\n\nAlexandra Orlando’s planet Mars is located at 7° Aries. Her ideal match is someone with Venus at 1/13° Aries or LIBRA."
