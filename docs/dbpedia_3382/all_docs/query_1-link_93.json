        "text": "Get to know Keanu Reeves' girlfriend.\n\nThe Matrix star, who has affectionately been dubbed the \"Internet's Boyfriend,\" is dating Alexandra Grant, an accomplished visual artist who explores the use of text and language in various media.\n\nIn addition to receiving accolades for her creations, Grant's work has been written about in a wide array of publications, from the Los Angeles Times to Whitehot Magazine of Contemporary Art.\n\nThe self-proclaimed Los Angeles native, who was actually born in Ohio, is also highly regarded for her collaborative efforts, joining forces with well-respected literary pioneers and philosophers. One of her first collaborations that sparked worldwide recognition was with Reeves, who at the time was simply a longtime friend.\n\nThough it's unclear exactly when Grant and Reeves' met, their relationship dates back to at least 2011 — the year their book, Ode to Happiness, was published. Almost a decade later, their relationship went from platonic to romantic when they made their public debut as a couple in 2019.\n\nReeves and Grant now live together in L.A., according to a source. \"This is the most fun and positive relationship that Keanu has ever been in,\" the insider told PEOPLE in March 2024. \"Everyone just loves her. Keanu is very happy.\"\n\nFrom Grant's creative background to her opinions on marriage, here's everything to know about the artist and her relationship with Reeves.\n\nShe's an accomplished visual artist\n\nGrant is a Los Angeles-based artist who's produced an impressive collection of works through the years. While she places an emphasis on painting as her medium of choice, she's experimented with other creative ventures as well.\n\nShe is also regarded for her collaborations, like with famed feminist Hélène Cixous and digital literature pioneer Michael Joyce. Many of Grant's collections have been displayed in galleries, such as the Orange County Museum of Art in Santa Ana and the prestigious Marfa Invitational in Texas.\n\nIn September 2023, Grant told PEOPLE that her art has \"absolutely\" changed since falling in love with Reeves.\n\n\"I had a studio visit a few years ago, and this very kind, very high-level person said, 'I can see that your work has gotten happier,’ ” she recalled. “That's real. We're all human beings. We're animals. We're expressing from where we are. I think the work is happier.”\n\nShe went on to call the John Wick star her \"inspiration.\"\n\nShe's multilingual\n\nGrant is multilingual as a result of her educational past and speaks English, Spanish and French. Though she resides in L.A. now, most of Grant's childhood saw her attending a variety of different schools that introduced her to cultures outside of her own. She spent time at a British school in Mexico City, a boarding school in Missouri and the International School of Paris in Europe.\n\n\"I grew up in part in Mexico City, Washington, D.C., and Paris, moving between languages and cultures,\" she told LA Weekly in 2019. \"Los Angeles felt like home from the moment I first arrived in 1995, especially the diversity of people, idioms, foods, and plants (like jacaranda and bougainvillea).\"\n\nShe worked as a college professor\n\nIn addition to her work as an artist, Grant shed her knowledge on students when she worked as a college professor at a few different schools across the United States. (She is the daughter of not one, but two professors!)\n\nFirst, she was hired as an adjunct professor at the ArtCenter College of Design in Pasadena, California, where she worked from 2009 to 2011. During that time, she taught an MFA seminar at Cal State Northridge in 2010.\n\nShe then served as a mentor in the Pacific Northwest College of Art's Distance MFA program from 2013 to 2014. She continued the duty at Syracuse University in 2015.\n\nShe collaborated on a book with Reeves\n\nSince Grant and Reeves have been longtime friends, they joined forces professionally to publish Ode to Happiness in 2011 — a grown-up picture book with illustrations by the artist and text from the actor.\n\nThis marked the pair's first collaboration together, in addition to Grant's artist-book debut and Reeves' written-work debut.\n\nIn 2016, they put their talents together once again for another collaboration, titled Shadows. The art book features a series of 54 images, photographed by Grant, based on the movements of Reeves.\n\n\"No one can move the way he can. He's a really extreme performer,\" Grant said of Reeves at an L.A. gallery viewing, per the Los Angeles Times. \"That's a huge piece of why those images are so interesting. I knew that if I moved the camera as we danced together, as photographer and subject, we could create these wonderful optical illusions.\"\n\nShe and Reeves founded a publishing company\n\nIn 2017, Grant and Reeves co-founded X Artists' Books, a publishing house that focuses on \"thoughtful, high-quality, artist-centered books that fit within and between genres,\" according to its website. \"Our books are works of art; portals to imagined worlds; treasured companions; the fabric of a community.\"\n\nThe company is often recognized by its abbreviation, XAB.\n\nShe and Reeves made their red carpet debut in 2019\n\nGrant and Reeves stepped out hand-in-hand on the red carpet at the LACMA Art + Film Gala in 2019, making their public debut as a couple.\n\n\"Keanu wants to openly share his life with her,\" a source told PEOPLE at the time. \"He is extremely happy and grateful to have Alex in his life.\"\n\nThe insider added that the two \"started dating earlier this year, but have wanted to keep it quiet.\"\n\nThe couple attended the LACMA Art + Film Gala again in 2023.\n\nShe's opened up about her public relationship with Reeves\n\nFollowing Grant's debut with Reeves in 2019, she told Vogue that she felt mixed emotions about her decision to publicize her relationship.\n\n\"I think every single person I knew called me in the first week of November, and that's fascinating, but the question I've been asking in all of this is: 'What is the opportunity for good,' \" she said.\n\nShe can officiate weddings\n\nAccording to Grant's Instagram, she can officiate weddings — and has. The artist shared a photo of herself leading the wedding of two friends during the summer of 2019.\n\nPer Vogue, she's also been a bridesmaid seven times!\n\nShe has her own opinion on marriage\n\nDespite being quite involved in the marital scene, Grant has her own views on the idea of tying the knot.\n\n\"Love at every level is deeply important to my identity,\" she told Vogue before joking, \"How's that for dodging the question?\"\n\nShe continued: \"I do not believe that isolation is the way. There is a period of isolation that I do as a painter, but I deeply value the experience of being in relationships.\"\n\nShe is a philanthropist\n\nGrant is the creator of the grantLOVE project, which produces and sells original artwork to benefit artist projects and arts non-profits. She started the initiative in 2008.\n\nThe project has raised funds for Heart of Los Angeles (HOLA), Project Angel Food, Art of Elysium, 18th Street Arts Center and LAXART, according to her website.\n\nAdditionally, Grant's works have been featured at LACMA, MOCA (Los Angeles), the Hammer Museum and the Art Gallery of Ontario.\n\nShe and Reeves shared a passionate kiss on the 2023 MOCA Gala red carpet\n\nIn April 2023, Grant and Reeves attended the Museum of Contemporary Art Gala at the Geffen Contemporary in Los Angeles.
