        "text": "ORLANDO, Fla. (March 13, 2024) â The Orlando Pride have signed forward Alex Kerr to a contract through the 2024 season, it was announced today. Kerr originally joined the Pride after being drafted by the Club in the final round of the 2024 NWSL Draft, No. 50 overall, after graduating from Texas Tech University.\n\nâWhen Alex joined us in preseason, we could immediately see her potential to find success at this level. She has had a really productive few weeks and has done everything right to earn this contract,â VP of Soccer Operations and General Manager Haley Carter said. âShe has pushed our forwards in training and is connecting well with her teammates, both on and off the field. We are so excited to formally add Alex to the roster and give her a high-performance environment in which she can continue to grow her game.â\n\nâIâm so grateful for this opportunity to begin my professional career with such talented teammates and an incredible coaching staff with the Orlando Pride. Iâm beyond excited for the season to begin,â Kerr said.\n\nPrior to transferring to Texas Tech University, Kerr spent her first four collegiate years at Vanderbilt University, where she won an SEC Tournament. During her four years, she made 63 total appearances and 26 starts. She tallied 12 goals and four assists, good for 28 career points. The Chapel Hill, North Carolina, native logged nearly 2,000 minutes for Vandy. As a senior, Kerr appeared in all 21 contests and scored the second-most goals on the squad. She posted a career-high six goals and an assist.\n\nWhile with the Red Raiders in 2013, Kerr recorded a career season scoring 11 goals and earning five assists while also playing in a career-best 1,631 minutes. She earned her first hat trick on Aug. 31 in a 6-1 Texas Tech victory. She also helped lift the Red Raiders past the NCAA First Round scoring the game-winning goal over Florida Gulf Coast University."
