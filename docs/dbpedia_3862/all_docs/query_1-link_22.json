An Annotated Translation of Plato: Timaeus and Critias a new translation by Robin Waterfield. A Thesis for Magister Program of Literature,\n\non\n\nMajoring in English Literature, Gunadarma University, Jakarta: March 2014.\n\nThis is an annotated translation research which belongs to the area of\n\nly\n\ntranslation with commentary. The problems of this research are (1) what\n\nne\n\ndifficulties are there during the translation process that the researcher has found?;\n\nfor\n\nand, (2) how to solve the problem encountered in the translation process? The aims of this research are (1) to find out what difficulties there are during the\n\ned\n\ntranslation process from English into Indonesian; and, (2) to find the way to solve the difficulties / problem encountered in the translation process. To achieve the\n\nam ex\n\naims of the research, the researcher employs introspective and retrospective\n\nmethod. The results of this research show that out of 80 data, 25 data appear to be\n\nre\n\nthe most difficult to translate. The 25 data covers Idiomatic Expression (4 items) consisting of Phrasal Verb (2 items) and Idiom (2 items), Structural Shift (4 items)\n\nvis\n\nconsisting of Active – Passive Construction (2 items) and Word Order (2 items), Loan Word (2 items), Antonymy (2 items), Cohesion Change (2 items),\n\nple\n\nExplicitness Change (2 items), Distribution Change (4 items) consisting of\n\nion\n\nCompression (2 items) and Expansion (2 items), Calque (2 items), Transposition (2 items), and Unit shift (1 item). To deal with those 25 data, the researcher\n\nemploys principle of translation, translation strategies, and translation theories as well as language theories. The finding of this research revealed that there is no explicit in the source text and implicit in the target text. Besides that, there is no active target text which derived from the passive source text.\n\n1\n\nCHAPTER I\n\n1.\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\non 1.1\n\nBackground of the Research\n\nIn this part of this research, the researcher is going to describe the\n\nly\n\njustification of the research, relevant researches which have been conducted,\n\nJustification of the Research\n\ned\n\n1.1.1\n\nfor\n\nne\n\nposition of the research and significance of the research.\n\nIn this research the researcher, who is at the same time also the translator,\n\nam ex\n\nwants to find out what difficulties there are during the translation process from\n\nre\n\nEnglish into Indonesian. These difficulties are in several aspects, for instance,\n\ngrammatical, lexical, cultural, as well as idiomatic. For example, the grammatical\n\nvis\n\naspect can be one of the obstacles in doing translation since each language has\n\ntheir own system and rules. For instance the English Imperative sentence 'I have\n\nple\n\nion\n\neaten my breakfast' literally in Indonesian means 'Saya sudah makan sarapan saya'. However, this Indonesian translation is not natural because it follows\n\nsentence structure of the English text which is Subject + Predicate + Object. In facing this case, the translator should find the equivalent sentence which has\n\nsimilar meaning in Indonesian, not renders the English text word by word. The Indonesian translation should be 'Saya sudah sarapan', which is only Subject+Predicate.\n\n2\n\nAnother obstacle for translator in the translation process is lexical aspects in relation with culture. The words ‘you’ in these two English sentences: (1) Dad, could you please help me to solve my problem? ; (2) Vera, my friend, could you please help me to solve my problem?, will be translated in different words in\n\non\n\nIndonesian, since culturally the Indonesian language honor those who have higher social status, who are older, and who have close intimacy. The word 'you' in\n\nly\n\nIndonesian has several meanings including kamu, Anda, kalian, engkau, kau, etc.,\n\nne\n\nbut those literal meanings are only applied to refer to persons who are younger,\n\nfor\n\nhave lower status, and close intimacy such as friends. In contrast, to refer to persons who are older, have higher status, and do not have close intimacy, the\n\ned\n\nword 'you' is translated into saudara, bapak, Ibu, kakak, etc. The Indonesian\n\nam ex\n\nversion of those two sentences are: (1) Bapak, dapatkah bapak membantu\n\nre\n\nmenyelesaikan masalah saya?; (2) Vera, temanku, dapatkah kamu membantu menyelesaikan masalahku?.\n\nvis\n\nThis area of research is called annotated translation that is a translation with commentaries. It means that the translator renders the source text into the target\n\nple\n\nion\n\ntext and at the same time she gives description or explanatory notes to the\n\ntranslation. In this research, the researcher gives explanation of the reason why she has translated as such.\n\nAnnotated translation is chosen to extend the researcher’s experience in translation. This annotated translation is a form of introspective research which means the researcher/the translator reflects her own thoughts to look for the right equivalence of translating the source language text in line with the language rules of the target text which is Indonesian. The researcher employs retrospective\n\n3\n\nresearch. It means the translator or the researcher tries to look for the equivalence based on the theories of translation, theories of languages, translation strategies as well as principle of translation. The translation from English into Indonesian is selected since the researcher\n\non\n\nnative tongue is Indonesian. Hence, translating from English into Indonesian does not take much more effort as it will be the other way round. The book Plato:\n\nly\n\nTimaeus and Critias a new translation by Robin Waterfield, published by oxford\n\nne\n\nworld’s classics, was taken to be translated as this book is a work of the great\n\nfor\n\nAthenian philosopher, Plato (c. 427 – 374 BCE), who is very influential upon Western intellectual tradition. He is the earliest Western philosopher whose\n\ned\n\ncomplete works have been preserved.\n\nam ex\n\nBesides that, this book is a compilation of two Plato’s works. The first work\n\nre\n\nnamely Timaeus, and another is Critias. The title of those works is taken from one of the characters in Plato’s works since Plato’s works are in the form of dialogue.\n\nvis\n\nTimaeus provides teleology explanation to define all natural phenomena for\n\ninstance how the cosmos and everything in it came into existence, the origin of\n\nple\n\nion\n\nhuman beings, their place in the cosmos, and what they should aspire to. While\n\nTimaeus is about natural phenomena, Critias tells us about the lost ancient city,\n\nAtlantis in which we are told that Atlantis is an advanced civilization which was\n\nsuddenly lost. As far as the researcher has known there is no annotated translation research yet concerning this book in the library as well as in the web. It is important to carry out this research since annotated translation, in practical sense, is the application of studying translation. The subjects studied in the translation class including principle of translation, translation strategies,\n\n4\n\ntranslation theories, as well as language theories, are employed in this annotated translation research. By conducting this research, the researcher can widen her experience in translation as well as sharpen her language and translation skill.\n\non\n\n1.1.2 Relevant Researches\n\nIn this section of this research, the researcher is going to review the\n\nly\n\nresearches done in this topic.\n\nne\n\nEvert H. Hilman (2010) carried out an annotated translation, for his\n\nfor\n\nmagister thesis in Gunadarma University, with the title an Annotated Translation of It’s in The Music. The problems of his research are (1) what difficulties were\n\ned\n\nencountered by the researcher /translator when translating It’s in The Music into\n\nam ex\n\nIndonesian; (2) how were those difficulties solved in the translation. The\n\nre\n\npurposes of his research are (1) to attain factual information concerning the\n\nproblems faced by the researcher/translator in translating the source text; (2) to\n\nvis\n\ngive plausible solutions to the difficulties. In his research, he used introspective and retrospective method. His research covered translating an English text into\n\nple\n\nion\n\nIndonesian and at the same time he investigated and analyzed the problems\n\noccurred in the process of translation. From his research, Evert (2010) had found\n\nout that from his entire data, there were 25 data relating to aspect of languages; 12 words, 6 phrases, 3 sentences, 1 figure of speech, 2 idiomatic expressions, and 1 clause sentences, became the most difficult for him. The second, El Shahed (2005) conducted a research, for his Master of Arts\n\nthesis at American University of Sharjah, entitled The Need for Domestication: An Annotated Translation of A Personal Developtment Text from English to Arabic.\n\n5\n\nHis research discussed problems related to the needs to domesticate encountered during the translation of the prologue, introduction, and part of Chapter I of a book The Different Drums. Besides that, his research also examined how domestication can play a vital role in preserving the intentionality of the source\n\non\n\ntext. Thus, the purposes of his research are (1) to provide practical evidences from the field that domestication is inevitable in given translation situations; (2) to\n\nly\n\nmaintain a sense of foreignness in the translated text. He didn’t mention the\n\nne\n\nmethod and the result of his research, but he said that he used domestication\n\nfor\n\ntechniques in his translation.\n\nThe third, Gretchen Whalen (2002) conducted a research entitled An\n\ned\n\nAnnotated Translation of a Colonial Yucatec manuscript: On Religious and\n\nam ex\n\nCosmological Topics by a Native Author funded by The Foundation for\n\nre\n\nAdvancement of Mesoamerican Studies, Inc. The object of her research was a manuscript bequeathed by Sylvanus Morley to the library of the Laboratory of\n\nvis\n\nAnthropology in the Museum of Indian Arts and Culture in Santa Fe, New\n\nMexico. When she studied the manuscript, she noticed that the author of the\n\nple\n\nion\n\nmanuscript misspelled key Spanish words and distorted Church dogma, while\n\ndisplaying complete command not only of Yucatec vocabulary, but also of Maya style and metaphor. Those facts lead her to conduct a research with the purposes\n\n(1) to complete the transcription and translation of the manuscript as well as (2) to produce a clear translation. She dealt with the difficulties by identifying European source texts whenever possible, as well as noting parallels in Maya literature. She didn’t mention the method she used, but she said that she used a semipaleographic approach for transcription, given computer limitations.\n\n6\n\n1.1.3 Position of the Research 1. The first relevant research namely Evert’s (2010) discusses an annotated translation of It’s on The Music. The difference between Evert’s research and the researcher’s is that the researcher uses a philosophical book while the source of\n\non\n\nEvert’s research was a novella. The similarity between these two researches is that both translate from English source text into Indonesian.\n\nly\n\n2. The second relevant research, El Shahed's (2005) conducted a research\n\nne\n\nentitled The Need for Domestication: An Annotated Translation of A Personal\n\nfor\n\nDevelopment Text from English to Arabic. This research differs from the researcher’s research in that El Shahed’s concerns in translating a spiritual growth\n\ned\n\nand personal development book from English into Arabic while the researcher\n\nam ex\n\nconcerns in translating a philosophical book published by Oxford world's classics\n\nre\n\nfrom English into Indonesia. The similarity between these two researchers is that both put commentaries in their translation.\n\nvis\n\n3.\n\nThe third relevant reserach is Whalen’s (2002) discusses An Annotated\n\nTranslation of a Colonial Yucatec manuscript: On Religious and Cosmological\n\nple\n\nion\n\nTopics by a Native Author. This research differs from the researcher’s research\n\nsince Whalen’s (2002) is an annotated translation from Yucatec into English while the researcher’s is from English into Indonesia but both researches concern in annotated translation.\n\n7\n\n1.1.4 Significance of the Research It is hoped that the result of this research can be used as input data by students conducting research on annotated translation as well, especially the English language as the source text. The results of this research can also be useful\n\non\n\nfor those who do not know English since they can read the Indonesian version.\n\nProblem of the Research\n\nly\n\n1.2\n\nne\n\nIn the translation process, the translator/the researcher may find difficulties.\n\nfor\n\nSince the purpose of the translation is equivalence between source text and target text, generally the difficulties lie in the process of finding equivalence. In dealing\n\ned\n\nwith the difficulties, the translator will employ some translation theories and\n\nam ex\n\nstrategies. The difficulties, which also can be called as problems, can be\n\nre\n\nformulated as follows: a.\n\nBy translating English text into Indonesian for this research, the\n\nvis\n\nresearcher must have found some difficulties during the translation process. In this research, what difficulties are there during the translation process that\n\nple\n\nb.\n\nion\n\nthe researcher has found?\n\nSince the difficulties which latter can be called problems always need\n\nsolutions, in this research, the researcher wants to know how to solve the problem encountered in the translation process?\n\n8\n\n1.3\n\nPurpose of the Research Based on the problems mentioned above, the purposes are formulated as\n\nfollows: a.\n\nThis research aims at to find out what difficulties there are during the\n\non\n\ntranslation process from English into Indonesian. b.\n\nThis research aims at to find the way to solve the difficulties / problem\n\nne\n\nly\n\nencountered in the translation process.\n\nScope of the Research\n\nfor\n\n1.4\n\nThis research focuses only in translating a philosophical book entitled\n\ned\n\nPlato: Timaeus and Critias a new translation by Robin Waterfield, from English\n\nam ex\n\ninto Indonesian, and at the same time investigating and analyzing the problems\n\nple\n\nion\n\nvis\n\nre\n\nthat occur in the translation process.\n\n9\n\nCHAPTER II REVIEW OF RELATED LITERATURE\n\non 1.\n\nReview of Related Literature\n\nIn this chapter, the researcher is going to describe Principle of Translation,\n\nne\n\nly\n\nTranslation strategies, Translation theories, and Language theories.\n\nTheoretical Review\n\nfor\n\n2\n\n2.1 Principle of Translation\n\ned\n\nPrinciple of translation, which consists of six principles, is introduced by Alan\n\nam ex\n\nDuff (1990) in his book entitled Translation. (pp.10-11). Below are the definition\n\n1.\n\nre\n\nof the six principles:\n\nMeaning. The translation should reflect accurately the meaning of the\n\nvis\n\noriginal text. Nothing should be arbitrarily added or removed, though occasionally part of the meaning can be ‘transposed’... (p. 10).\n\nple\n\nSource Text\n\nion\n\nExample 1: Transposition\n\nTarget Text\n\nBahwa pemimpin berperan sentral\n\nIt is undebatable to say that the leader\n\ndalam mewujudkan impian sebuah\n\nplays a central role to manifest the\n\norganisasi tak perlu dibantah.\n\ndreams of an organization.\n\n(Taken from REQUISITIOIRE Law Enforcement & Justice Magazine, and its translation pp. 46-47)\n\n10\n\nThe Indonesian verb...dibantah... is translated into the English adjective ...undebatable... This kind of shift from one grammatical class into another, in this case is a verb into an adjective, is called transposition.

One of the most frequent criticisms of\n\ntranslation is that ‘it doesn’t sound natural.’ This is because the translator’s\n\n17\n\nthoughts and choice of words are too strongly moulded by the original text (p.11). For example: Source Text\n\nTarget Text\n\nSeven people made the list for the first\n\nTujuh orang membuat daftar untuk\n\non\n\npertama kalinya, dan diantaranya yang\n\nentrant is Sri Prakash Lohia, brother-in-\n\ntelah mencapai penghasilan tertinggi\n\nlaw to Lakshmi Mittal, the fifth richest\n\nadalah Sri Prakash Lohia, ipar dari\n\nperson in the world.*\n\nLakshmi Mittal, orang kaya no. 5 di\n\nfor\n\nne\n\nly\n\ntime and the highest ranking new\n\ndunia.\n\ned\n\n*(Taken from News Release Forbes Asia Forbes Indonesia, p. 2) The translation of the source text above is awkward since while the\n\nam ex\n\ntranslator translate it, she is too concern with the form of the source text and\n\nre\n\nensure that all words are translated. In fact, in translating, sometimes the translator need to transpose, to expand, to reduce, or even to omit some words or\n\nvis\n\nexpressions. The translation of the source text above should be as follows: Source Text\n\nTarget Text\n\nple\n\nTujuh orang berada dalam daftar\n\ntime and the highest ranking new\n\nuntuk pertama kalinya, dan diantaranya\n\nentrant is Sri Prakash Lohia, brother-in-\n\nyang telah mencapai penghasilan\n\nlaw to Lakshmi Mittal, the fifth richest\n\ntertinggi adalah Sri Prakash Lohia, ipar\n\nperson in the world.\n\ndari Lakshmi Mittal, orang kaya no. 5 di\n\nion\n\nSeven people made the list for the first\n\ndunia.

If the expressions cannot be directly translated, try any of the following:\n\nple\n\nion\n\n-\n\nretain the original word, in inverted commas, for example:\n\nHere, the researcher quoted three sentences from IIAS Newsletter Online. (Research Project) No. 26. Southeast Asia Regions entitled Violence in Papua written by S. Eben Kirksey, a Marshall Scholar at the University of Oxford who has conducted field research in West Papua, Indonesia, and Central America: Four distant gunshots had been heard minutes before by the 'Kepala Desa' while he was visiting a neighbouring\n\n19\n\nvillage. He feared that a passing military patrol had begun shooting Misty Ridge villagers for not conducting independence day celebrations. The source to the gunshots was never determined, but this incident served\n\non\n\nas a chilling backdrop for my research until I left the field in early 1999.

In\n\ned\n\nthe example above, the writter retain the expression in inverted commas.\n\nam ex\n\nre\n\n retain the original expressions, with a literal explanation in brackets,\n\nFor example:\n\nvis\n\n“ In Java, modest hand-pushed food carts called kaki lima (meaning “five legs” of supports when standing still) travel residential streets” (p. 134).\n\nple\n\nion\n\n(Taken from Culture and Custom of Indonesia, Jill Forshee, Greenwood Press, United States of America, 2006)\n\nIn the example above, the writer retain the Indonesian idiom ...kaki lima... is retained and he added explanation in brackets.\n\n20\n\n- use a close equivalent, for example: Source Text\n\nTarget Text\n\nEnhanced engagement is a double-\n\nMenguatnya keterkaitan adalah\n\nedged sword.

The literal\n\nmeaning of both idioms is nearly matched. Only the word 'double' which in\n\nple\n\nion\n\nIndonesian should be 'ganda' instead 'dua'. But the meaning of both idioms is similar.\n\n- use a non-idiomatic or plain prose translation, for example: Source Text\n\nTarget Text\n\n“You made your way back here\n\n“Kau berjalan sendirian kemari?” taya\n\nalone?” asked my grandfather.\n\nkakekku.\n\n21\n\n(Taken from Pamuk, Orhan, My Name Is Red, p. 30 and its translation Pamuk, Orhan, Namaku Merah Kirmizi by Atta Verin, p. 74)\n\nThe English idiom ...made your way... is translated into non idiom in\n\non\n\nIndonesian, into ...berjalan...

In this sub-\n\ned\n\nchapter, translation strategies introduced by Chesterman (2000) will be discussed.\n\nam ex\n\nChesterman (2000) grouped translation strategies into three main groups, namely\n\nre\n\nsyntactic, semantic and pragmatic strategies in which each group has several\n\nstrategies. Below the researcher will discuss some of the strategies proposed by\n\nvis\n\nChesterman (2000) which the researcher used in this research.\n\nple\n\nion\n\n1. Syntactic Strategies\n\n1.1 Literal Translation\n\nChesterman (2000) stated that, “I define this rather loosely as meaning\n\n“maximally close to the SL form, but nevertheless grammatical” (p. 94).\n\n22\n\nFor example: Source Text\n\nTarget Text\n\nTo God belongs the East and the West.\n\nDan kepunyaan Allahlah Timur dan Barat.\n\non\n\n(Taken from Pamuk, Orhan, My Name Is Red, p. 2 and its translation Pamuk, Orhan, Namaku Merah Kirmizi by Atta Verin, p. 7)\n\nly\n\nThe example above is a verse of the Koran cited by Pamuk. It is translated\n\nne\n\nin Indonesian word by word and it follows the source text form/ word order as\n\nfor\n\nclossely as possible with considering language rules of Indonesian.\n\ned\n\n1.2 Loan, Calque\n\nam ex\n\nChesterman (2000) stated that “Loan, calque. This strategy covers both the\n\nre\n\nborrowing of individual items and the borrowing of syntagma. Like the other strategies, it refers to a deliberate choice, not the unconscious influence of\n\nFor example:\n\nion\n\nple\n\nvis\n\nundesired interference” (p. 94).\n\nSource Text\n\nHowever, with the amount of\n\nTarget Text\n\nNamun dengan besarnya kompensasi\n\ncompensation and fees promised from dan fee yang dijanjikan oleh coal mining, many people have been\n\npenambang batubara, banyak orang\n\ntempted to hand over their land for coal tergoda untuk melepaskan mining.\n\nlahannya bagi penambangan batubara.\n\n23\n\n(Taken from Moeliono,M., et all (Eds.), The Decentralization of Forest Governance, p. 30, and its translation Moeliono,M., dkk (Eds.), Desentralisasi Tata Kelola Hutan, p. 28) In the example above there are two words which is bold in each column.\n\non\n\nFirst is …compensation…, this word is translated into Indonesian by modifying the words into the appropriate grammatical rules and normal pronunciation in\n\nly\n\nIndonesian that is …kompensasi... This kind of strategy is called calque. While\n\nne\n\nanother word that is fees… is directly translated into Indonesia without change.\n\ned\n\nfor\n\nExcept the omission of affix ‘s’ which in English indicates plural form.\n\n1.3 Transposition\n\nam ex\n\nChesterman (2000) stated that “Transposition. I use this term (from Vinay and\n\nre\n\nDarbelnet) to mean any change of word class…” (p. 95). For example:\n\nvis Source Text\n\nMarthin Billa didukung oleh kelompok\n\nion\n\nple\n\nMarthin Billa had the support of his\n\nTarget Text\n\nown ethnic group, the Kenyah, who\n\nsukunya sendiri, suku Kenyah, yang\n\nvoted as one block, while the other two mempunyai satu suara, sedang dua candidates were Lundaye,which split\n\ncalon lainnya berasal dari suku\n\nthat ethnic group’s vote.\n\nLundaye, yang suaranya terpecah.\n\n(Taken from Moeliono,M., et all (Eds.), The Decentralization of Forest Governance, p. 50, and its translation Moeliono,M., dkk (Eds.), Desentralisasi Tata Kelola Hutan, p. 47)\n\n24\n\nThe English noun ...the support... is translated into Indonesian verb ...didukung... This change of grammatical class is called transposition. A meaning of an expression in one language can be coveyed by different grammatical class in other language, but the meaning is just the same. In this case, the transposition\n\non\n\noccurs since in the source text, the writter used V+N ...had the support... which in Indonesian literaly means V+N ...mendapatkan dukungan... Although the\n\nly\n\nconstructions are same, that is V+N, the translator opted to use V ...didukung...\n\nne\n\n(back translation: had been supported) since in translating there are many ways to\n\ned\n\nfor\n\ndeliver one meaning.\n\n1.4 Unit Shift\n\nam ex\n\nChesterman (2000) stated that, “The units are: morpheme, word, phrase, clause,\n\nre\n\nsentence, paragraph. A unit shift occurs when a ST unit is translated as a different unit in the TT” (p. 95).\n\nvis Source Text\n\nAku melukis awan bergaya Cina,\n\nion\n\nple\n\nI painted scalloped Chinese-style\n\nTarget Text\n\nclouds, clusters of overlapping vines\n\nsekelompok pepohonan cemara yang\n\nand forests of color that hid gazelles,\n\nlebat, dan hutan berwarna-warni yang\n\ngalleys, sultans, trees, palaces, horses\n\nmenyembunyikan kijang, perahu, para\n\nand hunters.\n\nsultan, pepohonan, istana-istana, kuda, dan para pemburu.\n\n(Taken from Pamuk, Orhan, My Name Is Red, p. 3 and its translation Pamuk, Orhan, Namaku Merah Kirmizi by Atta Verin, p. 20)\n\n25\n\nThe morpheme 's' in the word ...sultan..., in the source text, indicates plurality. This morpheme is translated into a word in the target text, Indonesian, that is, ...para... 1.5 Phrase Structure Change\n\non\n\nChesterman (2000) stated that “This strategy...comprises a number of changes at the level of the phrase, inlcuding number, definiteness and modification in the\n\nSource Text\n\nTarget Text\n\nfor\n\nne\n\nly\n\nnoun phrase, and person, tense and mood in the verb phrase” (p. 96)\n\nDicari Tough-Minded Leader\n\nWe Need Tough-Minded Leader\n\ned\n\n(Taken from REQUISITIOIRE Law Enforcement & Justice Magazine, and its translation p. 46)\n\nam ex\n\nThe Indonesian source text is in the form of imperative mood. However, it is\n\nre\n\ntranslated into declarative.\n\nvis\n\n1.6 Clause Structure Change\n\nion\n\nple\n\nChesterman (2000) stated that Clause Structure Change “... have to do with the structure of the clause in terms of its constituent phrases. Various subclasses\n\ninclude constituent order ..., active vs passive voice...” (Chesterman, 2000, p. 104).\n\n26\n\nFor example: Source Text\n\nTarget Text\n\nHad I been told Istanbul used to be a\n\nAku pernah mendengar cerita tentang\n\npoorer, smaller and happier city, I\n\nbetapa Istanbul pernah menjadi kota\n\non\n\nmight not have believed it, but that’s\n\nyang lebih miskin, lebih kecil, dan lebih\n\nwhat my heart told me.\n\nbahagia. Aku mungkin tidak\n\nnuraniku.\n\nfor\n\nne\n\nly\n\nmemercayainya, tetapi itulah kata hatiku\n\n(Taken from Pamuk, Orhan, Snow by Freely, Maureen, p.8 and its translation\n\ned\n\nPamuk, Orhan, Snow Dibalik Keheningan Salju by Berliana M. Nugrahani, p. 29) The English passive construction Had I been told… which can be\n\nam ex\n\nrestructured I had been told… is translated into active construction Aku pernah\n\nre\n\nmendengar… which is indicated by active verb … mendengar... Actually, the passive construction of Had I been told…in Indonesian is Aku pernah\n\nvis\n\ndiberitahu… However the translator opts to translate it into active construction in order to make it natural for target language readers.\n\nple\n\nion\n\n1.7 Sentence Structure Change\n\nChesterman (2000) stated that, “This group of strategies affects the structure of the sentence-unit, insofar as it is made up of clause units. Included are changes between main-clause and sub-clause status, changes of sub-clause types etc.\n\n27\n\nFor example: Source Text\n\nTarget Text\n\nArtinya, pemimpin yang baik harus\n\nOr to say that a leader is an altruist; the\n\nberwatak altruis; mengutamakan\n\none that accentuates the interests of\n\non\n\nkepentingan yang dipimpin.\n\nthose being led.\n\n(Taken from REQUISITIOIRE Law Enforcement & Justice Magazine, and its\n\nly\n\ntranslation p. 46)\n\nne\n\nThe Indonesian source text constructed by main clause + sub-clause, and it\n\nfor\n\nis translated into Indonesian into sub-clause+ main clause; nominal clause+ two\n\ned relative sub-clauses.\n\nre\n\nam ex\n\n1.8 Cohesion Change\n\nChesterman (2000) stated that “A cohesion change is something that affects intratextual reference, ellipsis, substitution, pronominalization and repetition, or the\n\nvis\n\nuse od connectors of various kinds” (p. 98).\n\nple\n\nion\n\nFor example:\n\nSource Text\n\nTarget Text\n\nThis was a difficult category for people Kategori ini termasuk sulit to deal with in an abstract way – ‘it\n\nbagi masyarakat karena bersifat\n\ndepends upon what people wish to\n\nabstrak – pada umumnya mereka\n\nbuy’, they told us. They could not\n\nmengatakan ‘tergantung pada apa yang\n\npredict what the future demands might\n\nmau dibeli orang’. Masyarakat tidak\n\n28\n\nbe.\n\ndapat memperkirakan permintaan pasar di masa mendatang.\n\n(Taken from Moeliono,M., et all (Eds.), The Decentralization of Forest Governance, p. 79, and its translation Moeliono,M., dkk (Eds.), Desentralisasi\n\non Tata Kelola Hutan, p. 75)\n\nly\n\nThe English pronoun They… refers to a noun in the previous sentence\n\nfor\n\nne\n\n…people… The pronoun ‘they’ is used instead of repetition of the noun ‘people’ since pronoun is one of cohesive devices in English. In the other hand, the\n\ned\n\nword…people… which is in Indonesian means …masyarakat… is repeated in the second sentence of the target text. The translator opts not to use pronoun in order\n\nam ex\n\nto make it clear, or to avoid ambiguity for the reader.\n\nre 1.9 Level Shift\n\nvis\n\nChesterman (2000) stated that “By levels I mean phonology, morphology, syntax and lexis. In a level shift, the mode of expression of a particular item is shifted\n\nSource Text A: This house is haunted.

The words …these species… actually refers to …a given species… in the previous sentence.

Bellow is traslation theories proposed by Newmark and Nida and Taber concerning word order:\n\n40\n\nNewmark (2004) cited Catford that: Structural shifts: These are said by Catford to be the most common form of shift and to involve mostly a shift in grammatical structure. For example, the subject pronoun + verb + direct object structures … in English … are translated by an\n\non\n\nindirect object pronoun + verb + subject noun structure in Spanish . (Newmark, 2004, p. 61)\n\nly\n\nBesides that, Nida and Taber (1992) defined Structural Adjustment as\n\nne\n\n“Word and phrase order:\n\nfor\n\n……………………………………………………………………………………\n\nMoreover, the basic order of Subject-Verb-Object may be altered in a number of\n\ned\n\nways, e.g., Subject-Object-Verb, Verb-Object-Subject, or Verb-Subject-Object” (p.\n\nre\n\nFor example:\n\nvis\n\nam ex\n\n113).\n\nSource Text\n\nDari cirinya, pengelolaan lokal\n\nion\n\nple\n\nLocal governance, by its very nature,\n\nTarget Text\n\nenables local groups to exercise more\n\nmemungkinkan kelompok masyarakat\n\ninfluence informally and formally.\n\nlocal mempengaruhi secara informal maupun formal.\n\n(Taken from Moeliono,M., et all (Eds.), The Decentralization of Forest Governance, p. 5, and its translation Moeliono,M., dkk (Eds.), Desentralisasi Tata Kelola Hutan, p. 5)\n\n41\n\nThe words ... by its very nature... in the source text is translated into Indonesian by shifting their position to the initial of the sentence. It is done since the translator wanted to make it natural to target reader.\n\non 2.3.2 Loan Word\n\nSome terms in a language may not exist in another language, thus the terms\n\nly\n\nwill be borrowed without any change made by those which do not have the terms.\n\nne\n\nThe terms then become loan word. Vinay and Darbelnet in Munday (2004) stated\n\nfor\n\nthat “Borrowing: The SL word is transferred directly to the TL. ……………………………………………………………….\n\ned\n\nSometimes borrowings are employed to ad local colour …”(p. 56).\n\nam ex\n\nFrom Vinay and Darbelnet's theory, it is defined that the aim of using loan\n\nre\n\nword is not solely the non-existence of the term in a language, but to make the readers of the translator know that the text they read is originally produced by\n\nvis\n\nforeign. Besides Vinay and Darbelnet, Roman Jakobson (1959) in Venuti (2000) stated that “Whenever there is deficiency, terminology may be qualified and\n\nple\n\nion\n\namplified by loan-words or loan-translation … (p. 115)\n\nFor example: Source Text\n\nTarget Text\n\nFor example, the local timber\n\nMisalnya, broker pengurus izin\n\nbroker who arranged C.V.

The difference between calque and loan word is\n\nre\n\nthat loan word is used by doing no changing in the word while calque is used by changing the word in accordance with the grammatical norms and pronunciation\n\nvis\n\nof target language.\n\nVinay and Darbelnet in Venuti (2004) stated that “A calque is a special kind\n\nple\n\nion\n\nof borrowing whereby a language borrows an expression form of another, but then translates literally each of its elements” (p. 85). Besides that, Newmark (1988)\n\nstated that “Transference (emprunt, loan word, transcription) is the process of transferring a SL word to a TL text as a translation procedure. It is the same as Catford's transference, and includes transliteration, which relates to the conversion of different alphabets:…. (p. 81). Here is the example of calque:\n\n43\n\nFor example: Source Text\n\nTarget Text\n\nAlthough the pace of reforms was most Meskipun laju reformasi yang paling dramatic from 1998 to 2003,\n\ndramatis terjadi pada tahun 1998 hingga\n\non\n\ndecentralization and democratization\n\n2003, desentralisasi dan reformasi\n\nreforms had their origins much earlier.\n\ndemokratisasi bermula jauh sebelum\n\nne\n\nly\n\ntahun-tahun tersebut.\n\n(Taken from Moeliono,M., et all (Eds.), The Decentralization of Forest\n\nfor\n\nGovernance, p. 7, and its translation Moeliono,M., dkk (Eds.), Desentralisasi Tata\n\ned Kelola Hutan, p. 7)\n\nThe english noun ...reform... is translated into Indonesian by conforming its\n\nam ex\n\npronunciation and grammatical norms into ...reformasi...\n\nre\n\n2.3.4 Idiomatic Expressions: Phrasal Verb\n\nvis\n\nMany experts propose translation theories to translate idiomatic expressions.\n\nion\n\nple\n\nHere the researcher quoted two theories proposed by Nida and Taber, and Baker. To translate Idiomatic expression in which there is no equivalent idiomatic expression in the target text, the translator can employ these theories: Nida and Taber (1974) stated that:\n\nIdioms … are some of the most obvious candidates for semantic adjustment, for the very fact they are idioms means it is unlikely that the same type of distinctive form will have the same meaning in another language. The adjustments are quite understandably of three\n\n44\n\ntypes: (a) from idioms to nonidioms, (b) from idioms to idioms, and (c) from nonidioms to idioms. Frequently idioms are shifted to nonidioms in the process of transfer. (Nida and Taber, 1974, p. 106)\n\non\n\nFrom Nida and Taber's theory, it can be infered that when there is no\n\nequivalent idiomatic expression in the target language, the translator can translate\n\nly\n\nan idiomatic expression into non-idiomatic expression in the target text.\n\nfor\n\nTranslation by paraphrase. This is by far the most common way of translating idioms when a match cannot be found\n\ned\n\nne\n\nAnother expert is Baker (1991) who stated that:\n\nin the target language or when it seems inappropriate to\n\nam ex\n\nuse idiomatic language in the target text because of\n\nre\n\ndifferences in stylistic preferences of the source and target languages. (Baker, 1991, pp. 74-74)\n\nvis\n\nSimilar to Nida and taber's theory, Baker's provide us a technique to translate idiomatic expression when there is no idiomatic expression in the target\n\nple\n\nion\n\nlanguage. Baker (1991) called this technique as paraphrase. Paraphrase has\n\nseveral meaning, one of them is restating a thought into translator's words freely but the meaning still preserved. However, in this case, paraphrase refers to plain words which deliver the meaning of an idiomatic expression.\n\n45\n\nFor example: Source Text\n\nTarget Text\n\nIn forest areas, the centre is reluctant to\n\nDi wilayah hutan, pemerintah pusat\n\ngive up income from valuable\n\nenggan menyerahkan pendapatan dari\n\non\n\nkayu dan produk hutan yang bernilai\n\nauthorities need the markets, skills and\n\ntinggi, sedangkan pemerintah lokal\n\ncapital available from the centre.\n\nmemerlukan pasar, keahlian, dan modal yang tersedia di pusat.\n\nfor\n\nne\n\nly\n\ntimber and forest products, while local\n\n(Taken from Moeliono,M., et all (Eds.), The Decentralization of Forest\n\ned\n\nGovernance, p. 7, and its translation Moeliono,M., dkk (Eds.), Desentralisasi Tata Kelola Hutan, p. 6)\n\nam ex\n\nThe words ...give up... in the example above is a phrasal verb, verb plus\n\nre\n\npreposition, which is a kind of idiomatic expression. It is translated into a plain word ...menyerahkan... in Indonesian which is its equivalent. In Indonesian,\n\nvis\n\nphrasal verb is called verba berpreposisi, which is its literal meaning.\n\nple\n\nion\n\n2.3.5 Possitive – Negative\n\nConcerning the shift of positive into negative construction or vice versa which occurs in translation, Toury (in Munday 2001) stated that:\n\nThe law of interference... refers to ST linguistic features (mainly lexical and syntactical patterning) being coppied in the TT, either ‘negatively (because they create nonnormal TT patterns) or ‘positively’ (the existence of features in the ST that will not be non-normal in the TT\n\n46\n\nmakes them more likely to be used by the translator). (Munday, 2001, p. 116) Besides Toury, another theory is proposed by Vinay and Darbelnet in Hatim and Munday (2004) who stated that:\n\non\n\nModulation is a variation of the form of the meassage, obtained by a change in the point of view.\n\nThe type of modulation which turns a negative SL\n\nfor\n\nexpression into a positive TL expression is more often than not optional, even though this is losely linked with\n\ned\n\nne\n\nly\n\n..............................................................................................\n\nthe structure of each language, e.g.:\n\nam ex\n\nIt is not difficult to show ... :………………………….....\n\nre\n\n[lit. It is easy to show ...]. (Hatim\n\nand Munday, 2004, p. 150)\n\nTarget Text\n\nion\n\nSource Text\n\nple\n\nvis\n\nFor example:\n\nAlthough there is no concrete\n\nMeskipun tidak ada bukti adanya\n\nevidence of ‘money politics’ in the\n\n‘politik uang’ di dalam pemilihan Bupati\n\nelection of the Malinau District head,\n\nMalinau, 15 ‘pembelian’ jabatan kepala\n\n15 ‘purchasing’ the position of district\n\ndaerah dengan uang dan bantuan adalah\n\nhead through money and favours is\n\nrahasia umum di seluruh negeri ini.\n\npublic knowledge throughout the country.\n\n47\n\n(Taken from Moeliono,M., et all (Eds.), The Decentralization of Forest Governance, p. 50, and its translation Moeliono,M., dkk (Eds.), Desentralisasi Tata Kelola Hutan, p. 47)\n\non\n\nThe source text above is constructed in positive which indicates by positive auxiliary verb ...is..., it is translated into Indonesian into negative construction by\n\nne\n\nly\n\nthe addition of ...tidak... which add negative form to the sentence.\n\nfor\n\n2.3.6 Active – Passive\n\nActive and passive construction of a sentence is indicated by the function of\n\ned\n\nsubject and object. In passive construction, the subject undergoes the action of the\n\nam ex\n\nverb and vice versa. Vinay and Darbelnet (in Munday, 2001) stated that,\n\nre\n\n“Modulation at the level of message is subdivided (pp. 246-55) along the following lines:\n\nvis\n\n……………………………………..\n\nactive to passive (and vice versa)...” (p. 58).\n\nple\n\nion\n\nThus, according to Vinnay and Darlbelnet, the shift of passive into active or vice versa in translating is one of modulation types. Besides them, Nida and Taber (1974) stated that:\n\nActive and passive constructions: the problems of active and passive constructions also figure largely in the problems of transfer. This especially true in languages which may have no passive at all, or which may have a decided preference for the active. In such cases passives\n\n48\n\nmust be changed into actives… But some languages … have almost an opposite tendency, namely, employing a high percentage of expressions in the passive. (Nida and Taber, 1974, p. 114)\n\non For example:\n\nly\n\nSource Text\n\nKadang-kadang, seperti yang terjadi di\n\nfor\n\nne\n\nSometimes, as in the six communities\n\nTarget Text\n\nenam desa yang kami survei (27 persen\n\nsample), negotiations began during this\n\nsampel), negosiasi dimulai selama\n\nmeeting and concluded with an\n\npertemuan ini dan diakhiri dengan\n\nagreement.\n\nam ex\n\ned\n\nthat we surveyed (27 per cent of the\n\nsebuah kesepakatan.\n\nre\n\n(Taken from Moeliono,M., et all (Eds.), The Decentralization of Forest\n\nGovernance, p. 112, and its translation Moeliono,M., dkk (Eds.), Desentralisasi\n\nvis\n\nTata Kelola Hutan, p. 108)\n\nThe English active construction indicated by active verbs ...began... and\n\nple\n\nion\n\n...concluded... is translated into passive construction in Indonesian indicated by\n\npassive verbs ...dimulai... and ...diakhiri... In Indonesian, prefix di- is added to an active verb to make it passive.\n\n2.3.7 Reference Reference is a pronoun which conveys a meaning of a previous noun. In English, it is used to avoid repetition and a type of cohessive devices. To translated a reference, the translator should notice the cohesiveness of the target\n\n49\n\ntext. Sometimes, in target text it is need to make repetition instead of use reference. Concerning reference, Larson (1998) stated that: …it is important to discuss pronouns as a cohesive device of discourse, particularly because they do not function in\n\non\n\nthe same way from language to language. ……………………………………………………………\n\ninappropriate to use pronouns in the translation …\n\nfor\n\n(Larson, 1998, pp. 433-434).\n\ned\n\nne\n\nly\n\nThere are some languages in which it would be\n\nBaker (1991) cited Halliday and Hasan that “The resulting cohesion ‘lies in\n\nam ex\n\nthe continuity of reference, whereby the same thing enters into the discourse a\n\nre\n\nsecond time’… (p. 181). She added that “One of the most common patterns of establishing chains of reference in English and a number of other languages is to\n\nvis\n\nmention a participant explicitly” (p. 181).\n\nple\n\nSource Text\n\nion\n\nFor example:\n\nTarget Text\n\nIn 1994, several environmental\n\nPada tahun 1994, sejumlah ornop di\n\nNGOs represented by the Indonesian\n\nbidang lingkungan yang diwakili oleh\n\nLegal Aid Institute and including\n\nLembaga Bantuan Hukum dan terdiri\n\nWahana Lingkungan Hidup Indonesia\n\ndari Wahana Lingkungan Hidup\n\n(WALHI), Lembaga Alam Tropika\n\nIndonesia (WALHI), Lembaga Alam\n\nIndonesia (LATIN), Pelangi and Sistem\n\nTropika Indonesia (LATIN),\n\n50\n\nHutan Kerakyatan (SHK) even went so\n\nPelangi, dan Sistem Hutan Kerakyatan\n\nfar as to bring the first legal suit against\n\n(SHK) bahkan menuntut Soeharto secara\n\nSoeharto for the misuse of reforestation\n\nhukum atas penyalahgunaan Dana\n\nfunds.

At other times, the translation may need to be less explicit” (p. 46).\n\nBesides Larson, another expert proposed a theory concerning the shift of implicit to explicit or vice versa in the translation process is Reiss in Munday (2004) who stated that “1. The TT of an informative text should transmit the full referential or conceptual content of the ST. The translation should be in 'plain prose', without redundancy and with the use of explicitation when required” (p. 75).\n\n51\n\nExample 1: Implicit – Explicit Source Text\n\nTarget Text\n\nThe research had three components: …\n\nPenelitian ini terdiri dari tiga komponen:\n\nWhen brought together, these elements\n\n…\n\non\n\nSetelah dirangkum, ketiga elemen\n\nlocal biodiversity and their wider\n\ntersebut menjelaskan berbagai prioritas\n\nimplications.\n\nlokal tentang keanekaragaman hayati dan implikasinya yang lebih luas.\n\nfor\n\nne\n\nly\n\nclarify many local priorities regarding\n\n(Taken from Moeliono,M., et all (Eds.), The Decentralization of Forest\n\ned\n\nGovernance, p. 63, and its translation Moeliono,M., dkk (Eds.), Desentralisasi Tata Kelola Hutan, p. 59)\n\nam ex\n\nThe English text ...these elements... is translated into ...ketiga elemen tersebut...\n\nre\n\nin Indonesia, which is more explicit. The translator adds a determiner ...ketiga... which in English means 'the three of' in order to make it clear for the target text\n\nvis\n\nreaders. The explicit form of the source text should be ...the three of these elements...\n\nSource Text\n\nple\n\nion\n\nExample 2: Explicit-Implicit\n\nTarget Text\n\nSeveral factors drive how the district\n\nAda beberapa faktor yang mendorong\n\ngovernment operates.\n\ncara kerja pemerintah.\n\n(Taken from Moeliono,M., et all (Eds.), The Decentralization of Forest Governance, p. 51, and its translation Moeliono,M., dkk (Eds.), Desentralisasi Tata Kelola Hutan, p. 48)\n\n52\n\nThe English noun ...the district government... is translated into Indonesian into ...pemerintah which is more implicit. The explicit form of the target text should be 'pemerintah daerah'.\n\non 2.3.9 Compression\n\nCompression is a type of distribution change strategies in which the items of\n\nly\n\nthe source text are reduced in the target text. One of the experts proposing this\n\nfor\n\nIt would be quite wrong to suggest that in every instance, that is, in all types of contexts and in all types of style, one\n\ned\n\nne\n\ntheory is Nida and Taber (1974) who stated that:\n\ninevitably encounters the need for expansion. There are\n\nam ex\n\nquite naturally some expressions which are reduced in the\n\nre\n\nprocess of transfer from one language to another. (Nida and Taber, 1974, p. 168)\n\nvis\n\nBesides Nida and Taber, another expert is Larson (1998) who stated that:\n\nFirst of all, it is essential that the translator accept the fact that a single source\n\nple\n\nion\n\nlanguage word may be translated by one word or by number of words in the receptor language, and that what is several words in the source text will sometimes be translated by a single word (Larson, 1998, p. 170).\n\n53\n\nFor example: Source Text\n\nTarget Text\n\nAlthough the area is inhabited,\n\nMeskipun berpenduduk, populasi di\n\nhuman populations are largely small\n\nkawasan ini umumnya kecil dan tersebar\n\non\n\nand widely scattered (densities typically (kepadatan kurang dari 1 orang per less than 1 person per square\n\nkilometer persegi).\n\nly\n\nkilometre).\n\nfor\n\nne\n\n(Taken from Moeliono,M., et all (Eds.), The Decentralization of Forest Governance, p. 62, and its translation Moeliono,M., dkk (Eds.), Desentralisasi\n\ned\n\nTata Kelola Hutan, p. 58)\n\nThe English phrase Although the area is inhabited... which contains 5 words is\n\nam ex\n\ntranslated into Meskipun berpenduduk.... which contains 2 words. This reduction\n\nvis\n\nre\n\nis called compression.\n\n2.3.9 Expanssion\n\nWhile compression is the reduction of the source text in the process of\n\nple\n\nion\n\ntranslation, compression is the contrary. Nida and Taber (1974) stated that “Some\n\nexpressions, however, are also semantically condensed in the source language text that they often require considerable expansion in the receptor language” (p. 167). Besides that, Newmark (2004) cited Berman that “Expansion: Like other theorists... Berman says that TTs tend to be longer than STs. This is due to 'empty' explicitation that unshapes its rhythm, to 'overtranslation' and to 'flattening' “ (p. 150).\n\n54\n\nSource Text\n\nTarget Text\n\nGovernment Regulation 21, 1970, on\n\nPP No. 21/1970 tentang Hak\n\nthe Rights of Exploiting Forest.\n\nPengusahaan Hutan dan Hak Pemungutan Hasil Hutan.\n\non\n\n(Taken from Moeliono,M., et all (Eds.), The Decentralization of Forest Governance, p. 19, and its translation Moeliono,M., dkk (Eds.), Desentralisasi\n\nly\n\nTata Kelola Hutan, p. 18)\n\nne\n\nThe term ...the Rights of Exploiting Forest which consists of 5 words has\n\nfor\n\nits equivalent in Indonesia, that is ...Hak Pengusahaan Hutan dan Hak\n\ned\n\nPemungutan Hasil Hutan which consists of 8 words. Since the number of words of the source text is expanded in the target text, it is called expanssion.\n\nam ex\n\nre\n\n2.3.10 Transposition\n\nIn general, transposition is the change of grammatical class which occurs in\n\nvis\n\ntranslating the source text into the target text. Catford in Munday (2004) stated\n\nion\n\nple\n\nthat “(b) Class shifts: These comprise shifts from one part of speech to another” (p. 61). Besides that, Vinay and Darbelnet in Munday (2004) stated that\n\n“Transposition (2000: 88 and 1995: 94-9): This is a change of one part of speech for another without changing the sense” (p. 58).\n\n55\n\nFor example: Source Text\n\nTarget Text\n\nMeanwhile, after a long vacuum, the\n\nSementara itu, setelah lama vakum,\n\nMerap with support of the Kenyah\n\nsuku Merap yang didukung suku\n\non\n\ntried to revive the Lembaga Adat Besar Kenyah berusaha menghidupkan Se-Sungai Malinau and elected Bpk\n\nly\n\nImpang Alang as Kepala Adat Besar in\n\nSungai Malinau dan memilih Impang Alang sebagai Kepala Adat Besar di\n\nfor\n\nne 2003.\n\nkembali Lembaga Adat Besar Se-\n\ntahun 2003.\n\ned\n\n(Taken from Moeliono,M., et all (Eds.), The Decentralization of Forest Governance, p. 38, and its translation Moeliono,M., dkk (Eds.), Desentralisasi\n\nre\n\nam ex\n\nTata Kelola Hutan, p. 35)\n\nThe English noun ...support... is translated into a verb in Indonesian\n\nvis\n\n...didukung... This change of grammatical class is called transposition.\n\nple\n\nion\n\n56\n\n2.4 Language Theories In this sub-chapter, the researcher is going to discuss language theories of English and Indonesian concerning translating grammatical forms of pronoun, verb, eliptical structure, and idiomatic expressions.\n\non 2.4.1 Pronoun\n\nly\n\nBased on Alwi (2003), the definition of pronoun is that “Jika ditinjau dari\n\nne\n\nsegi artinya, pronomina adalah kata yang dipakai untuk mengacu kepada nomina\n\nfor\n\nlain” (p. 249). He added that “Ada tiga macam pronomina dalam bahasa Indonesia, yakni (1) pronomina persona, (2) pronomina penunjuk, dan (3)\n\ned\n\npronomina penanya” (p. 249). Bellow is the examples of pronoun or pronomina in\n\nExamples\n\nre\n\nTypes of Pronoun\n\nam ex\n\nIndonesian.\n\nPronomina Persona Saya, aku, engkau, kamu, Anda, dia, beliau, kami,\n\nPenanya\n\nion\n\nPronomina\n\nini, itu, anu, sini, situ, sana, begini, begitu\n\nple\n\nPenunjuk\n\nvis\n\nPronomina\n\nsiapa, apa, mana\n\n(Taken from, Alwi et all., Tata Bahasa Baku Bahasa Indonesia. pp. 249- 265) Besides that based on Frank (1972), the definition of pronoun is as follow: Those pronouns that are actual substitutes may refer not only to a preceding noun –its antecedent – but to a larger part of a discourse that precedes. Those pronouns that are not substitutes may simply have indefinite reference or express indefinite quantity. (Frank, 1972, p. 20)\n\n57\n\nBellow is the list and the examples of pronoun proposed by Frank: Types of Pronoun\n\nExamples I, you, we they, she, he, it, mine, yours, his, hers, etc\n\nimpersonal pronoun\n\none\n\ninterrogative\n\nwho, what, and which\n\non\n\npersonal pronoun\n\nly\n\npronoun\n\ndemonstrative\n\ned\n\npronoun\n\nwho that, which\n\nfor\n\nne\n\nrelative pronoun\n\nthis, these, that, those\n\n-self\n\nreciprocal pronoun\n\neach other and one another\n\nre\n\nindefinite pronoun\n\nam ex\n\nreflexive pronoun\n\nsome-, any-, no-, every-, -body, -one, -thing, somebody\n\nFor example:\n\nion\n\nSource Text\n\nple\n\nvis\n\n(Taken from Frank Modern English A Practical Reference Guide, pp. 21-29)\n\nTarget Text\n\nIt is a story about everyday people\n\nIni adalah kisah tentang warga jelata\n\ntrying to make sense of the\n\nyang mencoba memahami peluang\n\nopportunities available to them.\n\nyang tersedia bagi mereka.\n\n(Taken from Moeliono,M., et all (Eds.), The Decentralization of Forest Governance, p. xv, and its translation Moeliono,M., dkk (Eds.), Desentralisasi Tata Kelola Hutan, p. xvii)\n\n58\n\nThe English pronoun ...them refers to ...everyday people... it is translated into Indonesian in their similar form. The Indonesian pronoun ...mereka refers to ...warga jelata...\n\non\n\n2.4.2 Idiomatic expression: phrasal verb (verba berpreposisi) Here, the researcher will discuss about one of idiomatic expressions namely\n\nly\n\nphrasal verb or in Indonesian verba berpreposisi. Both in English and in\n\nne\n\nIndonesian, phrasal verb or verba berpreposisi is a verb accompanied by a\n\nfor\n\npreposition. Based on Alwi, et al., (2003) gave a definition about verba berpreposisi as follows: “Verba berpreposisi ialah verba taktransitif yang selalu\n\ned\n\ndiikuti oleh preposisi tertentu...” (p. 95). Thus, according to him the verb which is\n\nam ex\n\nconstructed to be a phrasal verb should be a verba taktransitif or intransitif verb, a\n\nre\n\nverb which needs no object.\n\nAccording to Frank (1972) the definition of phrasal verb is as follows:\n\nvis\n\nA preposition may combine with a verb to form a new vocabulary item. This verbpreposition combination goes by several names –two part verbs, composite verbs,\n\nple\n\nion\n\nphrasal verbs ….....................................................................................some of\n\nthese verb-preposition combination may be separated by their objects …; others are nosneparable... ( Frank, 1972, pp. 172-173)\n\n59\n\nFor example: Source Text\n\nTarget Text\n\nLocal government may be composed of Pemerintah lokal dapat terdiri local people, who must become\n\ndari masyarakat setempat, yang harus\n\non\n\nadept at juggling their roles. (p. 5)\n\npandai berbagi peran. (p. 5)\n\n(Taken from Moeliono,M., et all (Eds.), The Decentralization of Forest\n\nly\n\nGovernance, p. 5, and its translation Moeliono,M., dkk (Eds.), Desentralisasi Tata\n\nfor\n\nne\n\nKelola Hutan, p. 5)\n\nThe English phrasal verb ...be composed of... is translated into its\n\n2.4.3 Cohesion\n\nam ex\n\ned\n\nequivalent Indonesian phrasal verb, or verba berpreposisi ...terdiri dari...\n\nre\n\nAccording to Alwi, et all., (2003) the definition of cohession, or in\n\nIndonesia is kohesi, is as follows: “Kohesi merujuk pada keterkaitan antar-\n\nvis\n\nproposisi yang secara eksplisit diungkapkan oleh kalimat-kalimat yang\n\ndigunakan” (p. 41). Further, Larson (1998) provided some cohesion devices and\n\nple\n\nion\n\nsuggestion in translating cohesive devices as follows:\n\n“There are many devices which give cohesion to a text...\n\nSuch cohesion devices as pronouns, substitute words, verb affixes, deictics, pro-verbs, conjunctions, special particles, forms of topicalization, and so forth, if translated one-forone from the source language into the receptor language, will almost certainly distort the meaning intended by the original author. (Larson, 1998, p. 430)\n\n60\n\nFor example: Source Text\n\nTarget Text\n\nHowever, these approaches assume\n\nNamun, pendekatan ini mengasumsikan\n\ncommunications and trust or that they adanya komunikasi dan saling\n\non\n\npercaya, atau bahwa hal itu dapat\n\ninstitutions for delibera tions,\n\ndibangun dengan mudah, dan sudah ada\n\nagreements, checks and balances, and\n\nlembaga-lembaga perundingan,\n\nconflict management are in place. xvi\n\npersetujuan, perimbangan kekuasaan,\n\nfor\n\nne\n\nly\n\ncan be easily built, and that clear\n\nmaupun pengelola konflik.\n\ned\n\n(Taken from Moeliono,M., et all (Eds.), The Decentralization of Forest Governance, p. xvi, and its translation Moeliono,M., dkk (Eds.), Desentralisasi\n\nam ex\n\nTata Kelola Hutan, p. xvi)\n\nre\n\nThe English pronoun ...they... refers to ...communication and trust... The\n\npronoun is employed here to avoid repetition, so is in Indonesian, instead of\n\nvis\n\nrepeating ...komunikasi dan saling percaya... the translator uses ...hal itu...\n\nple\n\nFrank (1972) stated that:\n\nion\n\n2.4.4 Active and Passive Voice\n\nThe active voice is used in making a straightforward\n\nstatement about an action; that is, the “doer” 11 of the action is the grammatical subject, and the “receiver” of the action is the grammatical object. In the passive voice, the same action is reffered to indirectly; that is, the original “receiver” of the action is the grammatical subject, and the\n\n61\n\noriginal “doer” of the action is the grammatical object of the preposition by. (Frank, 1972, p. 55)\n\nFor example:\n\non Source Text\n\nTarget Text Untuk memahami perubahan peluang\n\nchanging opportunities in Indonesia, an\n\nbagi warga lokal di Indonesia,\n\nexplanation is needed of how the\n\ndiperlukan penjelasan bagaimana\n\nfor\n\nne\n\nly\n\nIn order to understand local people’s\n\nspectacular upheavals of Indonesia’s\n\ndesentralisasi dan reformasi demokrasi\n\ned\n\ndecentralization and democracy reforms di Indonesia telah membuat masyarakat enabled local society to assert increased\n\nlokal bisa lebih mempengaruhi\n\nam ex pemerintah yang sebelumnya sangat\n\nautocratic, coercive state and its iron\n\notokratik dan pemaksa, serta bertangan\n\ngrip over forests.

In English passive form is constructed by auxiliary verb /has/have/had + verb participle. In Indonesian, it is translated into passive form ...diperlukan... In Indonesia passive form is marked by the addition of prefix di- to preceed a verb. Besides that, the\n\non\n\nEnglish active verb ...provides... is translated into Indonesian active verb ...memberikan... in Indonesia prefix me- added to a verb indicates active verb.\n\nly\n\nne\n\n2.4.5 Positive – Negatives\n\nfor\n\nFrank (1972) stated that “Auxiliary verbs, 1 as we have seen, are “helping”\n\nverbs that add structural meaning or semantic coloring to verbs carrying the ful\n\ned\n\nburden of lexical meaning. All auxiliaries share the ability to be directly followed\n\nam ex\n\nby not in negatives...” (p. 94). She added that, “A sentence may be made negative\n\nFor example:\n\nSource Text\n\nTarget Text\n\nple\n\nvis\n\nre\n\nnot only by using not with a verb but also by using no with a noun” (p. 124)\n\nTingkat wewenang, tanggung jawab,\n\nfinances in each sector varies by\n\ndan keuangan setiap sektor berbeda-\n\ncountry, and forest management has\n\nbeda di setiap negara dan pengelolaan\n\nnot always been fully decentralized to\n\nhutan tidak selalu didesentralisasikan\n\nlocal government units (Ribot and\n\npenuh ke pemerintah daerah (Ribot dan\n\nLarson, 2005).\n\nLarson, 2005).\n\nion\n\nThe degree of power, responsibility and\n\n63\n\n(Taken from Moeliono,M., et all (Eds.), The Decentralization of Forest Governance, p. 5, and its translation Moeliono,M., dkk (Eds.), Desentralisasi Tata Kelola Hutan, p. 5) The English source text, in the example above is potsitive indicated by\n\non\n\npositive verb ...has... while it is translated into negative form in Indonesian indicated by word ...tidak... which preceed the verb.\n\nly\n\nne\n\nFrank (1972) also stated that “Not used with another negative, usually a\n\nFor example:\n\nSource Text\n\nam ex\n\ned\n\nfor\n\nword with a negative prefix, has a positive meaning ...” (p. 161).\n\nTarget Text\n\nGelombang desentralisasi adalah hal\n\nunusual.*\n\nyang biasa.\n\nvis\n\nre\n\nSuch waves of decentralization are not\n\n(Taken from Moeliono,M., et all (Eds.), The Decentralization of Forest Governance, p. 7)\n\nple\n\nion\n\nThe English ...not unusual... actually has positive meaning since the prefix\n\nun- has already give negative meaning to the word usual and then the word not is added to give construct negation meaning of the word unusual, that is usual. It is translated into Indonesia into …biasa…, literally means usual.\n\n64\n\nCHAPTER III RESEARCH METHOD AND PROCEDURE OF THE RESEACH\n\n3.1 Research Design\n\non\n\nThis is an annotated translation research employing retrospective and\n\nintrospective method. In introspective method, the researcher reflects her own\n\nly\n\nthoughts to look for the equivalence of the source text by asking herself:\n\nne\n\na. In which part had the researcher had difficulties?\n\nfor\n\nb. What was the best translation for this word/ phrase/ idiom/ clause/\n\nsentence in line with the context?\n\ned\n\nc. Were the difficulties syntactical, semantic, pragmatical, or stylistic\n\nam ex\n\nfeatures?\n\nvis\n\nre\n\nd. Why had the researcher translated as such?\n\nIn retrospective method, the researcher traces back the theories of\n\ntranslation she has studied in order to be able to find the equivalence of the source\n\nple\n\nion\n\ntext by considering these following question:\n\na. Which theory of translation had the researcher used during the process of translation.\n\nb. Which translation strategy was applied during the course of translating? c. Which structural rule had the translator used in rendering from English into Indonesian and vice versa. d. Was the result of the translation in line with the cultural context of the source and the target audience.\n\n65\n\ne. Had the result of the translation fulfilled the purpose of the client. Annotated translation research is a translation with commentaries (Chesterman, 2002, p. 7). Commentary here means analysis of the difficulties found during the translation. The researcher analyzes or annotates the data found\n\non\n\nin the translation. In analyzing or annotating, the researcher uses the relevant translation strategies and principle of translation. The data analyzed are randomly\n\nly\n\nand purposefully chosen from all of the collected data since they are the most\n\nfor\n\nne\n\ndifficult items to be translated by the researcher.\n\ned\n\n3.2 Procedure of the Research\n\n1) The source text is read thoroughly to give a full understanding of the\n\nam ex\n\ncontent.\n\nre\n\n2) Independently the researcher translates the source text into Indonesian.\n\n3) During the course of translating the text, the researcher regularly consults\n\nvis\n\nher advisor to discuss problems she encounters referring to the task undertaken.\n\nple\n\nion\n\n4) At the same time she marks down the items, grammatical, lexical, and\n\nidiomatic expression, that have become a problem in the process of translating the text (data).\n\n5) The researcher takes only the most difficult problems to be analyzed due\n\nto the limited time allotted. 6) These problematic items are analyzed and the researcher gives plausible\n\nreasons to the solving of the problems.\n\n66\n\n3.3 Source of the Data\n\nThe source of the data consists of (a) an English philosophical book entitled Plato: Timaeus and Critias a new translation by Robin Waterfield, published by oxford world’s classics in 2008, and (b) the translation translated by the\n\non\n\nresearcher/translator herself.\n\nly\n\n3.4 Definition of terms\n\nne\n\nIn this research, there are some terms that the researcher wants to define and\n\nfor\n\nto clarify in this sub-chapter:\n\n1. In this research, the terms difficulty and problem, are interchangeable.\n\ned\n\nDuring the translation process, the researcher/translator at one time comes\n\nam ex\n\nacross an item, may it be lexical, grammatical, cultural, or stylistic, that\n\nre\n\nshe finds it difficult to get the right translation, in other words it is a\n\nproblem for her to decide which equivalent she has to use or which shift\n\nvis\n\nshe has to apply in order to convey the message of the source text into the target text.\n\nple\n\nion\n\n2. Annotation and analysis are sometimes interchangeable. In order to\n\nattain the solution to the problem the researcher/translator has to analyze or to annotate the difficulties she has encountered using the relevant\n\ntheories of translation and strategies of translation. Analysis can also mean detailed explanations for data as well as example of the data. 3.\n\nData. Data in this research are the grammatical, semantic, syntactic, cultural, and stylistic aspects that the researcher found difficult to translate during the translation process and then become her problem. In this\n\n67\n\nresearch, the researcher found 80 data of which 25 data are analyzed in the chapter 4 of this research. 4. Introspective Study. Nunan (1992) stated that “Introspective study is ... the process of observing and reflecting on one’s thoughts, feelings,\n\non\n\nmotives, reasoning processes, and mental states with a view to determining the ways in which those processes and states determine our behavious”\n\nly\n\n(p.115)\n\nne\n\n5. Retrospective Study. In addition Nunan (1992) said that “Retrospection is\n\nfor\n\na study investigating the mental processes through the researcher’s original memory immediately after he/she has translated. It is a conduct when “ ...\n\ned\n\nretrospective data are collected some time after the event under\n\nam ex\n\ninvestigation has taken place” (p124)\n\nre\n\n6. Researcher and translator are sometimes interchangeable since the\n\nresearcher also translates 15.000 words that further found 75 data in which\n\nvis\n\n25 of them are analyzed in chapter 4.
