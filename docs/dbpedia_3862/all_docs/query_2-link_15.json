From 1959 he advised many best-selling authors on taxation and copyright, helping to negotiate their contracts, editing their books and archiving their records. His other passion was for carpets with Jewish symbols – then neglected both in carpet studies and Jewish studies. Gaining an M.Phil in Jewish Studies he wrote the first book ever on Jewish carpets and has exhibited and lectured on them widely. Married with four children and six grandchildren he lives in Israel and continues his studies.\n\nWalter Denny, Professor of Art History and Adjunct Professor of Middle Eastern Studies, University of Massachusetts\n\nIn this magisterial study Anton Felton has delved deeply into the Vizcaya carpet, one of a distinctive group of fifteenth-century carpets handwoven in Murcia, Spain … Felton takes the reader on a fascinating voyage of discovery, visiting the history of weaving in Murcia and revealing the major role played by Jewish craftsmen in this specialized activity, viewed against the background of the intense and yet insecure Jewish–Christian interaction in medieval Spain. Drawing on a wealth of evidence, much of it unravelled from the iconographic content of the carpet itself, the author, who is a recognized expert of Jewish carpets, finds a wealth of new meaning in the justly famous Vizcaya carpet. Professor David M. Jacobson, Buckinghamshire New University; Editor, Palestine Exploration Quarterly\n\nJacket Photo: The Vizcaya carpet, courtesy of the Vizcaya Museum and Gardens, Florida.\n\nJewish Symbols and Secrets\n\nANTON FELTON Born in 1935, educated at\n\nA Fifteenth-century Spanish Carpet\n\nAfter a distinguished career during which he emerged as an authority on the intricacies of the international taxation of copyright, Anton Felton has now boldly entered what has aptly been termed the Spanish labyrinth. Here, in early modern times, converts to Christianity known as Conversos (converted Jews) and Moriscos (converted Muslims) struggled to establish their place in an increasingly intolerant Catholic Spain, negotiating a labyrinth of family secrets and manoeuvres for social status and economic power. Using a fifteenth-century carpet commissioned by the Enriquez, a Spanish noble family, as his point of departure, Felton casts a novel and revealing light on artistic patronage, cultural identity and Jewish tradition in Renaissance Spain.\n\nThe art of weaving floor coverings precedes the history of architecture, which is why you are probably sitting in a rectangular room. Now, Anton Felton, an international authority on the history of Jewish textiles has produced this work. It is a real thriller for it reveals the true history of the Vizcaya carpet, a revered artefact of fifteenthcentury Spain. In doing so, Felton looks at the neglected but age-old role of the Jewish weavers in the history of Mediterranean culture. In this carefully researched account, powerful symbols, religious prejudice, secret lives and art are entwined to make a remarkable and important story.\n\nVA L L E N T I N E M I T C H E L L Middlesex House 29/45 High Street Edgware, Middlesex HA8 7UU, UK VALLENTINE MITCHELL\n\nwww.vmbooks.com\n\nISBN 978 0 85303 834 4\n\nANTON FELTON\n\nLen Deighton, Author\n\n920 NE 58th Avenue Suite 300 Portland, OR 97213-3786 USA VALLENTINE MITCHELL\n\nJewish Symbols and Secrets\n\nFor years this brilliant fifteenth-century carpet, now in the Vizcaya Museum in Florida, has bedazzled experts and visitors alike. In this totally original study of the private lives of the noble family who commissioned the carpet, and of the humble weavers who wove it, it is clear that neither were Christians nor Muslims – they were secret Jews, conversos. In the hundred years leading up to their expulsion in 1492, hundreds of thousands of Jews of Spain, in the face of discrimination and persecution, converted publicly, but not privately, to Christianity. But they left us some clues as to their dangerous secret lives. Their artefacts, of which the Vizcaya carpet is a prime example, their literature and contemporary accounts, as well as the records of the trials of the Inquisitions and the taxes of the kings, reveal their compelling story. The age-old symbols in the carpet, with their hidden messages in Judaism and in the mysteries of Kabbalah, are analysed along with their alternative meanings in medieval Christian magic and Islamic culture. One major symbol is the Star of David and in this original work its history in Judaism is traced from Biblical times to 1600 CE. The hitherto neglected but illuminating role of textiles as cultural chronicles in Jewish history is uncovered, as is the ancient history of the Sephardi weavers of Spain and of the Mediterranean from Biblical to Roman to Visigoth and on to Christian and Islamic times, casting light too on the mystery of the origin of the Mamluk carpets. Further original insights are gained in the oft-debated question as to the total number of Jews who converted to Christianity. In understanding the worlds and the guarded secret lives of the people who came together to create this carpet, we now see it as an extraordinary and beautifully encoded statement of Jewish faith and survival.\n\nA Fifteenth-century Spanish Carpet\n\nANTON FELTON\n\n978 0 85303 834 4\n\nJEWISH SYMBOLS AND SECRETS\n\nJewish Symbols and Secrets A Fifteenth-century Spanish Jewish Carpet\n\nANTON FELTON\n\nVALLENTINE MITCHELL LONDON • PORTLAND, OR\n\nFirst published in 2012 by Vallentine Mitchell Middlesex House, 29/45 High Street, Edgware, Middlesex, HA8 7UU, UK\n\n920 NE 58th Avenue, Suite 300 Portland, Oregon, 97213-3786 USA\n\nwww.vmbooks.com ©\n\nAnton Felton\n\nBritish Library Cataloguing in Publication Data Felton, Anton.

Then, when Walter Denny, Professor of Art History and adjunct Professor of Middle Eastern Studies at the University of Massachusetts, and the towering figure in carpet studies today, was equally encouraging, I felt empowered to proceed. Nor can I adequately thank Rabbi Professor Marc Saperstein, Professor David Jacobson, Michael Franses and Dr John Mills who, so generously reading an early draft, made numerous corrections and suggestions – all of which (with one exception) have been incorporated in the text. My thanks to Lenard Harrow, guide, philosopher and friend; Joanna Lawson, my erudite and assiduous editor and Heather Marchant, my brave and patient publisher. It is also to the authors, the editors and illustrators of the five hundred or so books I have poured over these past few years to whom I am deeply indebted – and to whom I apologize when I have failed fully to understand or to give due credit.Whilst I have made every effort to track all copyrights, in cases where I have not been successful would any such owners please contact me. Finally to Francis Bacon (1561–1624), to whom I am indebted for his advice, ‘Read not to contradict and refute, nor to believe and take for granted, nor to find talk and discourse, but to weigh and consider’.\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nDoes It Really Matter?\n\nD\n\noes it really matter whether a fifteenth-century Spanish carpet was commissioned or created by Jews or by Christians or by Muslims? I think it does. Memory does matter. Without it, what is there to restrain the powerful, to comfort the weak, to make the young think twice and the old to think generously? Human achievement relies on memory, and the study of textiles, albeit somewhat neglected, but holding its store of many memories, offers us a unique perspective on the history, culture and development of society. Seeing a carpet as a cultural chronicle with its own social logic, studying it within the context of its own times, recalling those memories and asking how and why it was woven, for whom and when and where, we enter into another world and gain insights and understandings that otherwise we might not have. Key historical milestones and important cultural shifts are there to be seen – if you look. The carpets of a culture, be it Islamic, Christian, Chinese, Indian or Jewish, in demonstrating the essence of that culture, in explaining its uniqueness and in connecting us to our pasts, may, in illuminating our present, cast light upon our future. What astonishes me is that the substantial contribution of the Jews to textiles, a vouchsafing taking us far further afield in place and far further back in time than does the weaving of almost any other culture, has been allowed to be forgotten. Textiles, no less than language or architecture, help define and illuminate a culture, but little enough information about Jewish weavings, especially of carpets, is to be found in the otherwise voluminous literature of either Jewish or textile studies. I think this is mainly because, in Judaism, carpets – not being ritual artefacts – do not attract the attention they would otherwise merit as cultural objects. And as to carpet studies, it matters not if an Islamic carpet – in a geographical or cultural sense – is woven by a Muslim, a Christian, a Zoroastrian or a Jew, for it is the design, the style, the motifs, the patterns, the overall cultural manifestation of the carpet that\n\nxvi\n\nJewish Symbols and Secrets\n\ndetermines its type. In this work I am looking at a society through the prism of one of its few surviving carpets, so combining social studies with carpet studies. For if we neglect the memories of those who designed, wove and commissioned what must be tens of thousands of Jewish carpets, and if their where, their when and their why is to be lost, surely we have failed in our respect for the truth. Years ago I was much taken with an article written by Ita Aber, an international textile expert.1 She asked whether any of a group of about a dozen extraordinary and brilliant carpets woven in fifteenth-century Spain and today scattered among the great museums and private collections of the world might not be Judaic. These carpets are all called ‘Admiral’ or ‘Armorial’ because some of them display the coats of arms of don Alfonso Enriquez (1354– 1429), of his son, don Fadrique Enriquez (1390–1473) – both holders of the ancient office of Admiral of the Kingdom of Castile and of the Order of Banda – in addition to the escutcheon of don Fadrique’s first wife, Marina de Ayala (d. 1431). Others bear the coats of arms of Alfonso’s daughter Maria and her husband Juan de Rojas (d. 1454), and of Maria of Castile, Queen of Aragon (d. 1458). Ten years passed by before I could try to answer Ita Aber’s question by asking myself the following questions: 1. What were the religious, social, economic and political circumstances of the nobles who commissioned these carpets? 2. What were the religious, social, economic and political circumstances of the weavers who wove them? 3. What different meanings might be attributed by Jews, Christians and Muslims to the symbols on these carpets? It was not going to be enough to ferret out the facts – for they by themselves are inert; only the meanings behind them would explain what happened. As Americo Castro, the great Spanish historian of the period, put it, ‘A fact is like a sack. It won’t stand up if empty. For it to stand up it must be filled with the reasons and the feelings which caused it to exist.’2 To understand a culture, one best be of that culture, or near to it, for only then will one intuitively recognize its unique convolutions, its strengths and its weaknesses. Finally, having answered (so far as possible) the above three questions, I then would have to study the convergences of those answers, each to the other. One of the Admiral carpets is in the Vizcaya Museum in Miami, Florida. It intrigued me; there were no hidden Hebrew letters to be discovered in this\n\nIntroduction\n\nxvii\n\nbeautiful and typical Hispanic–Moresque carpet, but some of the symbols were familiar to me, for I had seen them often enough in Jewish Bibles of the period. I wondered if I had not seen some of those Islamic symbols in the famous Spanish synagogue carpet housed in the Islamic Museum in Berlin. I returned to London worrying about the migration of symbols and of their altered meanings in different cultures. Detective stories demand both motive and evidence. So my next step was to investigate the Enriquez family in the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries. Most historians agreed they were conversos – that is, Jews who in an increasingly hostile society had, in public at least, converted to Christianity. So far, so good. But clearly not good enough. For all I knew, the Enriquez’s stance as Christians was totally authentic. I could understand the historic reasons why Christian Spanish aristocrats might commission a grand carpet displaying Islamic symbols but were there, I wondered, historic reasons for those symbols to have different meanings for them. Further, given the pattern of many New Christians who, at least for a generation or two, continued, but now in total secrecy, to practice the faith of their fathers, and given the dire penalties payable were their apostacy to be discovered, the possibility of unearthing such secrets was remote indeed. The diversity of the views of the numerous authorities on the history of medieval Spain and on the history of medieval Jewry, allied to the paucity of information on the carpets of the time, made researching this work a complicated but ultimately rewarding task. Many days were spent in the ever-helpful British Library and then in the Murcia and Albacete regions of Spain learning something of the life and times of the Enriquez, the weavers, the Jews and conversos, and of their relationships with the dominant cultures. As with much discovery, gathering together a large number of small bits of information creates patterns and pictures and probabilities – the peripheral falls away as the essential emerges. Dates, of course, are as critical in conveying the progression of events, as is the technical data about the wool, the loom, the dyes and the knots, but at least as important are the beliefs, thoughts and the feelings, the zeitgeist, that lead to those events, for disregarding the basis on which people act and interact is to rob oneself of a framework of understanding. I have had to look closely at a very wide range of background material, criss-crossing in time and space and then weaving the separate threads together into one coherent whole. Studying and selecting the poetry, the prose, the pictures and the personal and public accounts of the time took me\n\nJewish Symbols and Secrets\n\nxviii\n\ncloser to the lives of the Jews and conversos. For it was only through analyzing and resolving the histories and dispositions of the Enriquez, of the Jewish weavers, of the symbols and of the circumstances that converged in fifteenthcentury Spain to create the Vizcaya carpet, that Ita Aber’s question might be answered. In responding to that question I viewed the Vizcaya carpet as if it were a lens through which, by looking at the world that created it, I saw it again – but this time more richly and clearly than before, for seeing it in its context, it was as if I was seeing it for the first time. It is, for me, this concern that counts, for, as a cultural chronicle, the Vizcaya carpet recaptures something of the memory of how the mighty and the humble lived, giving purpose and meaning to their lives amid the darkening realities of those times, times both alien and yet familiar to us, too, as the tolerance of each of the three great Abrahamic religions is being tested today, just as it had been in fifteenth-century Spain.

The region is good sheep country with excellent alum (the mordant needed to fix the dye into the wool), and varied flora and fauna (including the saffron flower for a rich yellow dye, and the expensive Kermes beetle and the more commonly used madder root for various reds), as well as the adjacent markets in North Africa providing the other dyes and chemistry for the subtlest of colours. Two thousand years ago, as a province of the Roman Empire, Spain was renowned for the superior quality of its wools (particularly in natural black and reddish colours) and for its linens and skilful weavers. By the eighth century, Islam had conquered most of the Iberian Peninsula, usually ridding it of its chaotic and barbaric Visigoth rulers. Murcia, underpopulated and unimportant, was an exception to this, its Muslim conqueror, ‘Abd al-‘Aziz, making a pact with Count Theodemer permitting him to remain in power in return for a substantial annual payment. Oleg Grabar, the eminent authority on Islamic art, affirms that ‘The craftsmen of Arabia itself were generally non-Arab, mostly Jews, and the practice of crafts was not honoured’,2 and that what usually happened was that Muslim conquerors would take up the art, craft and the craftsmen of the peoples they conquered. There seem to be very few original words in Arabic referring to artisan or artistic work. Under the Umayyads (755–976) extensive irrigation systems were constructed, sericulture introduced, the quality and quantity of the sheep improved, and weavers moved from Baghdad to set up more workshops, all massively to increase the production of carpets in Spain.3 The wool, silk, cotton, flax and\n\n4\n\nBackground Histories\n\nallied industries and general economy flourished, for commerce was basic to Islam. Muhammad himself had been a merchant and in Islamic (but not Jewish) tradition, Ishmael, oldest son of Abraham and the founding father of Islam, was also a textile merchant. The ancient tradition of textiles in Spain prior to its conquest by Islam probably led to its rug industry being one of the earliest in the Muslim world and possibly quite independent of the development of carpet production in Persia and Asia Minor. The emirate of Murcia, right from the beginning, was the major centre of Islamic rug manufacture and, by the tenth century, Almeria, the coastal town just to the south of Murcia, had become the most important Spanish port, shipping Spanish textiles and fine goods to North Africa and the East.4 It is probably here in the eleventh and early twelfth centuries that the exquisite Almoravid silk lampas textiles were woven with such fine details that they were more like painted miniatures than textiles. Probably the earliest mention of Spanish weavings in the Islamic period is in a tenth-century work, The Chronicle of Rassis, the Moor; the next reference is in an eleventh-century Latin poem. Often enough we do not know the exact nature of the fabric or the use to which it was put, but fragments of these early Spanish textiles, dated to the twelfth century, have been recovered in Egypt,5 possibly traded there through the Jewish merchants who were the major textile merchants in the Mediterranean.6 There is, however, no doubt that these weavings were being made in Spain well before the tenth century. In the Middle Ages textiles and agriculture were the major industries of the Mediterranean area and involved the great majority of the working population. Functionally essential, textiles were part of a family’s wealth, often consisting of many types of carpet.7 And in feudal Europe, albeit a rigid hierarchical world dominated by soldiers who held sway over your body, and by churchmen who wielded authority over your mind, the weavers’ importance was evidenced by their power. Their first recorded strike took place in Douai in Flanders in 1245 and they went on strike again in the 1320s. In 1379 the weavers of Ghent and Bruges rose against their feudal lord. In 1345 ten woolworkers were put to death for agitating for the right to organize; the church declared that spinners wasting wool would be excommunicated. In 1378 the wool carders of Florence rioted and actually held the city for some months.8 Sheep farming, requiring less labour and being less reliant on good weather, was far more profitable than agriculture. Spain’s central plateau provided excellent grazing for numerous flocks of sheep. So great was the profit to be\n\nWeaving in Spain and Murcia\n\n5\n\nmade from sheep’s wool, hide and meat that in the late thirteenth century the king of Castile and his nobles granted themselves a monopoly, known as La Mesta Real (the Royal Guild), which controlled the movement of sheep in the winter down from the northern midlands to the warmer south.The shepherds would drive their flocks as many as 500 miles along the Cañadas, broad strictly regulated tracks to the provinces of Murcia (where the Vizcaya carpet was woven) and to other depots in Castile and Valencia. There the sheep would graze on land that had been harvested, enrich the soil with their dung and then, before the sowing of the spring crops, be shepherded back north. Over the twelfth to the fifteenth centuries a superior breed was introduced and cross-bred with the natural Spanish sheep. Called the Merino, probably after the Marinids who ruled Morocco and the Atlas, it became known for its luxurious wool and robust qualities. Soon the wool of Spain was of such high quality that it was sometimes exported even to sheep-rearing, wool-exporting England9 as well as to the major manufacturers in Italy and the Low Countries (Holland). Its price, too, improved as much as its quality – for the repeated debasing of the Castilian currency through the fifteenth century, and the heavy export taxes imposed by the English government on its wool exports, gave Castile an increasing share in the international wool market and a healthy balance of payment surplus. The new horizontal loom and silk thread had appeared in Spain and southern France as early as the ninth century, two or three centuries before they were used on any scale in the rest of Europe. These two advances rapidly enhanced the quality and the output of Spain’s weaving industry.10 This loom had been in use in China ever since the first century and was probably brought to Europe by the Radhanites. They were Spanish (or possibly Provençal) Jewish merchants who, in the ninth century, in a journey lasting a year or two, would travel to China, trade there and return home. Rashi (Rabbi Solomon ben Itshaki) (c.1040–1105), the great Jewish scholar who lived in Troyes, France (and a renowned weaver himself), described the horizontal loom as one by which men weave with their feet.11 Worked by foot treadles, it greatly speeded up the production of linens and facilitated new inventions for carding and spinning sheep’s wool, goats’ hair and flax.12 The Vizcaya carpet, however, was most probably woven on the classical vertical loom used for making rugs, tent fabric, sacks and coarse clothes; it was sometimes known as naul shacr, the ‘goats’ hair loom’, that probably being the main material employed. It was in use by the Sephardi weavers in and around Safed in Israel until recently.\n\n6\n\nBackground Histories\n\nCarpets, the supreme artefact of Islam, occupied generation after generation of gifted Muslim, Jewish and Christian craftsmen working to satisfy a critically important cultural and commercial need. Carpets were valued and valuable statements of power. So, for example, the list of gifts given to the caliph by one of his viziers in 929 includes no fewer than 100 prayer rugs.13 Usually made of wool, occasionally of silk, carpets were placed on the floors of mosques, before the altar in churches, and by the Ark and on the walls of synagogues. Outside of a religious context, they were laid on or next to beds, on tables, desks and chairs and draped over windows, balustrades and balconies, and on cupboards, chests and window seats.14 The variety of uses for the same textile seemed limitless. Under Islam, the economy of Spain in general – and the textile industry in particular – boomed. The tenth-century chronicler Ibn Hauqal writes about the export of Spanish weavings to Egypt, Persia and many other countries15 and a surviving ship’s manifest of goods shipped from Spain to Egypt in the twelfth century includes ten carpets.16 Spanish carpets are described in English inventories of the fourteenth century and we have a record of one Spanish carpet trader, Antonio Ferandez, who exported three particularly grand carpets, valued at £6.13.4 (then an enormous sum of money), to England. Landing at Southampton in 1428, they must have sold well, for the following year Ferandez brought more weavings to England.17 But what do we know of the carpets of Murcia under Islam? As noted, from Islamic times and at least as early as the tenth century, carpets were being woven there,18 and by the twelfth century the numerous accounts of its carpet weaving industry were extremely complimentary. The geographer Muhammad ibn Muhammad al-Idrisi, writing in the first half of the twelfth century about the carpets of Chincilla, one of the towns in Murcia, attributes their fine qualities to the region’s exceptional air and water.19 He notes too that many of these rugs were exported to Egypt. We get a sense of the level of production from his report that in Almeria alone there were 800 silk weaving looms.20 In the next century al-Himyari reports: ‘They used to make fine and valuable carpets in Murcia. The people of Murcia have unequalled skill in manufacturing and decorating carpets.’21 His comments are echoed by yet another chronicler, ‘Ali ibn Musa ibn Sa‘id (1214–86), who remarks on the high prices obtained in the east for the carpets of Murcia.22 Ibn al-Walid Isma‘il ibn Muhammad al-Shakundi (d.1231 or 1232) again confirms that the carpets of Tantalya in Murcia must have been particularly fine, for they were\n\nWeaving in Spain and Murcia\n\n7\n\n‘exported to all the countries of the East and the West’.23 Writing about Alsh, a town in Murcia, another Muslim writer eulogizes: ‘Splendid carpets which have no parallel in the world for beauty are manufactured there.’24 They were also valued in Spain, for we know the Bishop of Cuenca (a major centre of carpet production) bought some Murcian carpets in 1273. Later, the inventory of the estate of the great collector Jean Duc de Berri of France included thirteen carpets from Murcia, two of them displaying the six-pointed star. In London in 1255, when 16-year-old Prince Edward, heir to the throne of England, celebrating his marriage the previous year in Spain to Eleanor, Princess of Castile, brought many of the sumptuous Spanish textiles included in her dowry to London, they were displayed in her apartment and in the streets.25 In 1260s, as the Christian knights and their ragtag armies of mercenaries, outcasts, adventurers, fanatics and killers all advanced deep into Murcia, its Muslim population was promised that if they surrendered without a fight they would keep their land and their homes, their lives and their freedoms. However, in view of the usual rewards given to, or just taken by, the mercenaries – rape, pillage and murder most Muslims who could fled south to the security of Muslim-held Granada. Skilled weavers were especially welcomed there26 and the Muslim weavers of Murcia migrated en masse.27 How wise they were! For once in power, the Christian armies so oppressed those Muslims – who, relying on the knights’ promises, had remained – that a series of armed rebellions soon erupted, threatening King Alfonso’s still fragile hold on Murcia. King James I of Aragon came to his aid and in the revolt of 1264, in village after village, the remaining Muslims who were not slaughtered were expelled, until but a few Muslim communities of any importance remained.28 And the fines, the floggings and the confiscations continued. Ten years later, another great Muslim revolt, supported by promises of help from Africa, erupted. But the aid never arrived, the revolt was suppressed and the reprisals against the Muslims exceeded anything that they had previously experienced. Granada was once more overwhelmed by the Muslim refugees from Castile, to the extent that the population density in Granada exceeded five persons per square kilometre – an extraordinary figure for medieval Spain.29 Skilled carpet designers and weavers were honoured in Judaism and Islam – we know of a Muslim weaver in the eleventh century who became the chief advisor to Muhammad III and Hisham III30 – but the attitude of the Christian knights was quite different. Unlike the Jews, who revered creative labour (for\n\nBackground Histories\n\n8\n\nhad not the Almighty Himself laboured to create the world?), while coveting the craft they despised the craftsman. So they claimed the weavings of their Jewish and their remaining Muslim subjects as payment towards the new taxes they imposed on all the textiles and carpets manufactured in their domains. It is extraordinary really. Through much of the Middle Ages, Castile was racked by frontier and internal wars, ransacked by rapacious mercenaries, ruined by crippling inflation and financial anarchy, ravaged by recurrent plagues and racial and religious and power conflicts – yet, despite all, it thrived. Records of catastrophic times can sometimes make it seem as if disasters were constant and overwhelming, but often, awful as they were, they were limited in both time and space. By 1480 the total stock of sheep had grown to the staggering figure of some five million. The production of carpets in Spain, and particularly in Murcia, continued to expand, and by the fifteenth century it seems to have overtaken that of any other place in the Mediterranean.31 Let us now turn to place the Jews of Spain into this context. How did they get there? What were their roles and relationships in Muslim and then Christian host cultures? What were their numbers and significance?\n\nNOTES 1.

That was despite the trade war in much of the fifteenth century between Spain and England over wool. In 1436 the Libelle of Englysshe Polycye boasted that Spanish wools were no good for cloth making unless mixed with English wools, and in the 1440s the magistrates in one\n\nWeaving in Spain and Murcia\n\n9\n\ntown in the Low Countries required all drapers to ‘swear an oath annually upon the holy cross to use none but English wools’.

Horizontal looms had been used in China since at least the first century BCE. How they travelled to Europe is not known but by far the most significant merchants travelling between Europe and China were the Radhanites. Ibn Khurdadhbih (c.846), in his Book of Routes, records that having started out from Spain, ‘on their return from China they carry musk, cloves, camphor, cinnamon and other products ... Some made sail for Constantinople to sell their goods to the Romans; others go to the palace of the king of the Franks [Charlemagne].’ They also learned and brought back the process required to make paper. The first paper mill in the Middle East was opened in Baghdad by Jews in the eighth century and, as late as the twelfth century, Peter the Venerable (1092–1158), Abbot of Cluny, recorded ‘his objection to paper as a Jewish production on which unbelievers copied the Talmud and other obnoxious literature’.

Murray Eiland III, Starting to Collect Antique Oriental Rugs (Woodbridge: Antique Collectors Club, 2003), p.168.\n\nThe Jews of Spain\n\nT\n\nradition has it that Tartessus, an ancient Phoenician seaport on the Mediterranean coast of Spain, was the biblical Tarshish towards which Jonah fled in his struggle to escape the command of the Almighty. Another tradition and some Bibles1 hold that King Solomon’s ships (Figure 1) crossing the Mediterranean and anchoring off Tarshish, traded for silver,2 iron, lead and tin,3 the metals needed to build the Temple in Jerusalem; tin was also wanted as a mordant to fix dyes into thread. Some of Solomon’s mariners and traders may well have settled in Tartessus and possibly in Sagunto in Valencia, for there is an engaging legend about a tombstone found there with the Hebrew inscription ‘Adoniram, treasurer of King Solomon, who came to collect the tax tribute and died’. Murcia is located beside and below Valencia; its seaport of Cartagena was established late in the third century BCE by the Carthaginians – descendants of the Canaanites and Phoenicians, and biblical neighbours and allies of Israel.4 We know there were substantial Jewish settlements in North African Carthage and in all probability there were similar settlements in Carthaginian Spain, for textile weaving and dyeing was a major Carthaginian industry. The murex sea snail – crushed, each one provides a single drop of the dye for Phoenician red or Tyrian purple – was fished to extinction off the Atlantic coast of Spain by the Phoenicians. Homer, writing perhaps in the eighth century BCE, remarks on the colourful Carthaginian weaves, and Hermippos, in the fourth to third century BCE, notes that a significant level of Carthage’s business was exporting (and so presumably manufacturing) cushions.5 In the Middle Ages it was commonly held by both Christian and Jewish scholars that Jews had settled in Toledo after the destruction by Nebuchadnezzar of the First Temple in 586 BCE. One thousand years later the Jews of Toledo,\n\n12\n\nBackground Histories\n\nnow charged as Christ-killers, sought in vain to understand how they could possibly have any responsibility for the crucifixion – for their ancestors had left Palestine and settled in Toledo 600 years prior to the crucifixion. The Bible itself refers to ‘The Exiles of Jerusalem who are in Sepharad’,6 where the word ‘Sepharad’ is thought by some (probably incorrectly) to refer to Spain. To this day, the Spanish Jews and their descendants are known as Sephardim. There is, however, no firm archaeological evidence of any significant Jewish settlement in Spain until Rome, in its wars with Carthage, conquered and colonized much of the Iberian Peninsula in 200 BCE. In the first century CE St Paul, in his letter to the Romans, writes that he intends to take the gospels to Spain and, according to Clement (c.95 CE), he did. Spanish tradition tells us St James the Greater was warmly welcomed there and that the apostles and evangelists would usually go first to the synagogues to preach and gain many converts. This points to the existence of substantial Jewish communities in Spain, but the first solid evidence of the presence of Jews in Spain is provided by their tombstones (those links between the living and the dead), the earliest dating from the third century CE. For hundreds of years the Jews, Muslims and Christians of Spain coexisted in a rich and complex society – sometimes fruitfully, sometimes less so, until the expulsion of the Jews in 1492 and of the Muslims shortly thereafter. In 63 BCE the Roman general Pompey the Great conquered Judea and incorporated it into the Roman Empire. Many Jews, resisting foreign domination, fought wars of independence in the Land of Israel in 66–72 CE and again in 132–5 CE as well as in other parts of the Roman Empire. All of these revolts were put down with utmost ferocity. Many exiles and refugees, including captives sold into slavery, settled in Spain and other parts of the empire and there is little doubt that they were employed in or set up textile workshops, for weaving and dyeing had been second only to agriculture in the skills and economy of the Jews. This movement of highly skilled weavers from Judea to Spain is highlighted in a letter written in 70 CE to the Roman general Titus, the son of and successor to the emperor Vespasian. Having finally put down the major revolt in Israel,Titus is busy exiling, enslaving or crucifying, when a letter arrives from the Roman governor of Spain begging that he send him Baruch Albali, a Jewish master weaver.7 There was probably quite a demand for skilled weavers in Spain, certainly from the first century, with really sophisticated twenty-threecarat gold thread used in their fabrics. In Pompeii, a textile workshop preserved in the debris of the volcanic eruption of 79 CE reveals the names of the spinners and weavers, two of whom, Vebius Tamudianus and Maria, were probably\n\nThe Jews of Spain\n\n13\n\nJewish. They may well have been slaves who had been sold to the weaving master following the collapse of the revolt of 66–72 CE. In addition to at least one Hebrew inscription and references to the Hebrew Bible, a large pottery jar has been found, its painted label stating its contents to be kosher fish sauce – it was guaranteeing that favoured Roman delicacy contained no shellfish. So much of what little we know of those times comes from secondary or tertiary evidence, but the two insurrections inside Israel have armed us with primary and material evidence of the sophistication of the Jewish weavers and dyers of the time. As the Roman legions advanced, mopping up all resistance and laying waste to the land, some surviving Jewish units fled south to the arid mountainous region at the edge of the Dead Sea. There, in 70 CE, nearly 1,000 of them made their last stand in King Herod’s mountain-top fortress at Masada. Besieged by the Roman Tenth legion, they held out until 73 CE when, rather than surrender to Rome, all save a few committed suicide. Again, in the revolt of 132– 5 CE, one of the last Jewish units sought refuge in a remote cave halfway up the face of a sheer mountain, also near the Dead Sea, now called the Cave of Letters. There they starved to death. Nearly 2,000 years later, archaeologists retrieved balls of wool and yarn and remnants of some textiles and rugs from both Masada and the Cave of Letters.8 The fragments found at Masada included a sophisticated two-sided woollen rug with knotted cut pile in red, blue and yellow.9 Carthage had for centuries dominated the textile trade in the western Mediterranean10 but in 146 BCE it was conquered by Rome.While no record of any Jewish settlement prior to 146 BCE has come down to us, some scholars maintain that the expansion of the Phoenicians from Tyre and Sidon would have owed something to the collaboration of the Hebrews from Palestine. Subsequent to 146 BCE, traces of rugs have been found, and from the major Jewish cemetery at Gamart and other sites in Carthage, numerous oil lamps, decorated with the menorah and the rosette, of the second to fifth centuries CE, have been excavated. The Punic rugs, according to the Roman historian Silius Italicus (late first century CE) in his epic poem Punica, were as famous and celebrated as those of Corinth and Syracuse.11 We may conjecture that some refugees in 146 BCE fled to Spain, possibly to the Cartagena district. As happened later with the captives from the two failed revolts in Israel, those young men and women who were not crucified, and particularly those with valuable skills such as weaving, were sold into slavery and, like the Baruch Albali, dispersed over the Roman Empire, where their craft was in demand. Throughout much of the Roman world and beyond, Jews were renowned for the fine quality of their weavings.12 Then,\n\n14\n\nBackground Histories\n\nearly in the fifth century, in the twilight of the Roman Empire, we hear St Jerome complaining in the most bitter terms at the extent of the productivity of its Jewish artisans and craftsmen.13 Time erodes and the host culture erases most traces of Jewish settlement but sometimes the odd tombstone survives to give witness to that experience. The earliest known Jewish tombstone in Roman Spain dates back to the third century.14 It commemorates Annia Salomonula who was one year, four months and one day old when she died.15 Engraved on another Spanish Roman tombstone is a picture of a weaver working on a warp-weighted vertical loom (Figure 2). A number of Roman tombstones of the third century CE have been found with epitaphs to Jewish women weavers with images of spindles and distaffs but this tomb has that – and more. Above Atta Altica’s name is an intriguing six-pointed rosette – held by Erwin Goodenough, the pioneering authority on Greco-Roman symbols, to be the antecedent of the Star of David. Other authorities note that rosette and the spiral patterns were not that common in Roman art so it is not impossible that this third-century tombstone may be that of a Spanish Jewish weaver. In the next century, in 313 CE to be precise, the Emperor Constantine made his momentous decision to change from being a persecutor to becoming a protector of the Christians. Two years later he made it illegal for Jews to proselytize. Following the subsequent adoption of Christianity as the official religion of the Roman Empire, Constantine’s successors passed laws that effectively turned the Jewish Romans into second-class citizens. Then, early in the fifth century, Germanic tribes conquered and colonized much of the Iberian Peninsula and by the end of that century the Visigoths, infamous for their sack of Rome in 410 CE, became the dominant group. They were converts to Arianism, a form of Christianity that did not believe Jesus to be co-eternal and consubstantial with the Father but to be His instrument for the salvation of the world. They restored Jewish religious freedom. Another Jewish Iberian tombstone, this time from Tortosa and dated to the fifth or sixth century, has survived. Engraved on the stone are a five-branched menorah and a five-pointed star. The inscription in Hebrew, Latin and Greek tells us of Rabbi Jehudah and his wife, the lady Miriam, mourning the loss of Melissa, their daughter. In the same period, the same three languages appear on what was perhaps a stone sarcophagus for a child. It is from Palleros in Tarragona and carved alongside a menorah is a Tree of Life and two facing peacocks – ancient Jewish symbols which we shall see time and time again\n\nThe Jews of Spain\n\n15\n\n(Figure 3). Carved into the corner, that timeless prayer in Hebrew reads: ‘Peace in Israel, on us and on our children.’ The Arian Visigoths, under attack from the Church of Rome, persecuted the Catholics, many of whom, to save their lives, continued in public to worship according to the Arian rites while privately and secretly practising the creed of Rome. In a further foretaste of the future, marriage between Arians and Catholics was often forbidden. However, once the Visigoth King Reccared (586–601) converted to Catholicism, the roles were reversed as he turned on the Arians. Now it was their turn, for at least a generation or two, publicly to convert to Catholicism, while privately continuing to follow the Arian creed. As for the Jews, kings Reccared, Sisebut, Dagobert, Ervig and most of their various replacements successively banned Jews from any religious life, flogged them, embargoed their trade, enforced penal taxation, brought in mandatory conversion and finally expelled any who remained.16 In 602 in the reign of Sisebut, some 90,000 Jews are thought to have become what in later ages were known as conversos.17 Pope Gregory the Great (590–604), albeit implacably hostile to Judaism, condemned conversion under pressure on the wholly logical grounds that it could not possibly produce true believers. But the Visigoths ignored this condemnation – a decision to be followed by many of the successive rulers of Spain. Early in the seventh century, in the depths of the Arabian Desert, Islam was born. With its clarion call of monotheism, justice and morality, it swept like a hurricane through Arabia, Persia and Egypt, conquering them all within 100 years of its birth. On what became known as the Barbary Coast, between Carthage and Tangiers, the Jews and the Berbers under their Jewish Queen Kahana resisted the onslaught for as long as they could. The Arab historian Ibn Nuwairi records that they fought like furies and only by the will of Allah did the Muslims triumph. Many of the defeated Jews and Berbers converted to Islam. Indeed, Tariq ibn Zaid, the commander of the small Berber army that from the rock of Gibraltar invaded Spain in 711 and so triggered off the Islamic conquest of much of the peninsula, was himself believed to be a descendant of conversos. The rock was named in his honour ‘Jabal-al-Tariq’, and the name stuck, being transcribed into ‘Gibraltar’. There had been no openly Jewish communities left in Spain, for Egica, the last Visigoth king, in 693 forbade the Jews from following any trade, and having thus made sure they had no means of paying their taxes – increased them! He then banned them from his kingdom, and those who had not fled converted publicly to Christianity. Little wonder that they welcomed their new Muslim rulers as deliverers from oppression, and\n\nBackground Histories\n\n16\n\nmany who had sought sanctuary in North Africa returned home to Spain. Many Christians also welcomed their new rulers, some freely converting to Islam and others even faking an Arabic lineage. By the ninth century the country was prospering, exporting its manufactured goods and importing its grain. Under Islamic Umayyad rule, Jewish life and culture in Spain flourished, giving rise to generations of gifted philosophers, poets, politicians and weavers,18 and great international travellers, diplomats, courtiers and merchants too. In 797 Charlemagne the Great sent a diplomatic mission, including Isaac the Jew, to Harun al-Rashid, Caliph of Baghdad. Isaac alone survived the journey, returning to Charlemagne’s court accompanied by an elephant. It would have been a long and dangerous journey, but was as nothing to those of some of the Jewish merchants of Spain who, as noted, quite regularly travelled as far as India and China. Early in the twelfth century, liberal tolerance fell victim to the fervour of fanatical Islamic sects who, seizing power, outlawed all who did not submit to their fundamentalist beliefs. Many Jews migrated to the Christian-held parts of Spain; others, in an echo of what had happened to the Jews under Roman rule,19 then under Visigoth rule, now, in an ominous portent of what was to happen to them yet again, saved their lives by outwardly embracing Islam but secretly continuing to hold fast to the faith of their fathers.The confusion and the pain of the Jewish condition is expressed in the poetry of the time. One of the greatest of the poets, Abraham ibn Ezra (c.1055 to after 1135) writes as a Jew in relation to Christianity: Lord, I have heard of your Unity’s mystery Although I could not fathom it in my iniquity: I’ve longed for the One, besides which is none And despised all thought and talk of the Trinity. Bear with a broken heart’s transgression; It longs for your mercy, though I still sin. Pardon my falseness, then send me word; As you have asked, I have forgiven.20 But the predicament of the Jew in an alien land did not go away and it was his own son, Isaac ibn Ezra, who, mainly for social conformity, converted to Islam. In one of his poems Isaac reveals the price he and others paid for conversions of convenience: But if I begin each prayer ...\n\nThe Jews of Spain\n\n17\n\nI do so with my lips alone, my heart responding ‘You are a liar and your testimony is invalid’. Later, Isaac converted back to Judaism, but until the day he died he lived with grief and pain for his irresponsible conversion.21 In one of his last poems, he wrote: I have returned to the shadow of Your way I ask you, God, for Your forgiveness. In the enigmatic history of Judaism, the famous lines of Judah Halevi, the twelfth-century Spanish poet and philosopher,22 constitute one of the most lyrical statements of the Jewish dilemma: My heart is the East, and I am in the West As far in the West as West can be! How can I enjoy my food? What flavour can it have for me? How can I fulfil my vows And do the things I’ve sworn to do, While Zion is in Christian hands And I am trapped in Arab lands? Easily, I could leave behind This Spain and all its luxuries! – As easy to leave, as dear the sight Of the Temple’s rubble would be to me. From the middle of the thirteenth century and over the next 200 years, bit by bit the Christian knights conquered Moorish Spain. As was not uncommon in the conflict between the Crescent and the Cross, Jews sometimes fought on both sides. In one instance the opposing Christian and Muslim generals are said to have declared a truce on the Sabbath, for their Jewish soldiers would not fight on that day.23 For some of the Jews of Spain, but by no means all, much of the thirteenth and early fourteenth centuries was a second golden age and, in relation to what was happening to Jews in the rest of Europe, it was indeed a happy time. Spain, especially Leon and Navarre, opened their doors to refugees following the expulsions of the Jews from England, France and Aquitaine in 1290, 1306, 1324 and 1394.24 The Spanish Jews were literate, powerful and productive; some even owned castles and villages and exercised feudal rights.25 In the 300 years to 1376, there was never a time when the ruler of Castile did\n\n18\n\nBackground Histories\n\nnot have a Jewish official holding one of the highest offices in his administration, and for the next 100-odd years, right up to their expulsion in 1492, Jews frequently held similar cabinet rank as royal favourites. To gain context, to appreciate the extent of the Jewish population of Castile, the accounts of taxation paid by the Jews are revealing. The records of 1284 reported a Castilian Jewish population of some 850,000,26 and the tax returns for 1294 showed that a significant proportion, some 22 per cent, of the total local revenue was provided by the Jews. In that year the Jewish community of Murcia petitioned Sancho IV, king of Castile, to renew certain privileges and exemptions which had originally been granted to them to persuade them to go and live there. As for Murcia, it was not enough for the Christian knights to conquer it in the thirteenth century; the imperative was to colonize it – and quickly, too, for it was a frontier region abutting Islamic lands. Demographically overstretched and close to collapse, the kings of Aragon and Castile did everything to encourage Jews to settle there, typically by giving them generous tracts of real estate on condition that they lived there and cultivated the land. Other conditions often included the duty to provide military aid and materiel. But not only did the kings want the Jews in their new lands, they often wanted the Muslims out. A deed has come down to us, between the king of Castile and Abraham Albanna, a Jew of Tortosa: Abraham is granted a licence to transport Saracens out of Castile, paying the king two besants a head. The kings saw Jewish communities as invaluable elements providing economic and administrative stability, so extending and enforcing their royal authority over their new territories. At a time when Jews in much of Europe and, under the Almohads, in Islamic lands were suffering exploitation, persecution and expulsion, Murcia offered them freedom to follow their religion and their trades and professions. For example, so important were the Jewish bankers of Murcia by the end of the thirteenth century that two brothers, Moses Juceff and Albolazar, were specifically granted the exact same rights and protection as were enjoyed by all Christians. A further example of these inducements, which brought many Jews from southern France, northern Spain and North Africa to Murcia, were the major land grants made to Çag Alconqui – his name suggests he played some part in the reconquest of Murcia. He is described in the Land Grant document as caballero mayor, the title of one of the highest social rank, putting him – and other wealthy Jews settling in Murcia – on a par with Christian nobles.\n\nThe Jews of Spain\n\n19\n\nAt the end of the thirteenth century Murcia was part of the Kingdom of Aragon, and its king, Jaime II, urged Jews to settle there, even those with criminal records. Then, after Castile finally gained control of Murcia and tackled the question of what penalties should be payable by Jews for attacking Christians, Alfonso XI could not have spoken more clearly:‘it is our wish that Christians and Jews be equal in this point as in other matters’.27 This inclusiveness of Castilian society is clear from the inscriptions on the tombs of Ferdinand III (d. 1252), the great Castilian conqueror, and of his son Alfonso X, which were carved in Arabic, Latin, Castilian and Hebrew. Alfonso, known as the Wise, had both the Qur’an and the Talmud translated into Latin. For Jews, this inclusive society, this Convivencia, partly came about through those unique elements (mulled over in Chapter 8) which have enabled them to survive millennia of persecution. Linguistic confusion was perhaps another contributing factor, as this was a society in which the rulers and the ruled were often unable to speak to each other. The Christian knights and their brutish mercenaries, moving down from the north, spoke a variety of European languages, but in the main many of their subject people still spoke Arabic. Few Christians and Muslims could actually read or write, very few Christians spoke any of the languages of the Islamic conquerors and even fewer Muslims spoke any of the European languages. Into this breach stepped the literate and multilingual Jews as civil servants, doctors, translators, traders and diplomats,28 many conversant in Arabic, Hebrew and Castillian or Aragonese. The Jews, through their devotion to the Bible and Talmud and known in Islam as the People of the Book, were also people who, in the main, could read a book. Their literacy enabled them to learn, to retain and to expand knowledge. Never before, despite anti-Jewish tensions and outrages, had there been such relative harmony between the Jews and their Christian host culture. This uneasy pluralistic society had blossomed into a brilliant age, again producing generations of philosophers, poets, politicians and an exponential explosion of culture and of knowledge in so many disciplines including astrology, armoury, cartography, medicine, metallurgy, mathematics, manufacturing, maritime activity, painting, silversmithing and the all-important textile industry that provided much of the economic base to pay for it all. We see this in the estimates that 35–60 per cent of the income of each Iberian kingdom was provided by the Jews,29 and later that the Jews of Murcia paid the highest amount of tax of all the regions where we have the records of taxes they paid.30 The significance of these two points cannot be overstated and we will\n\nBackground Histories\n\n20\n\nreturn to them later.Taxation lies at the heart of government and it was the Jews, predominant in the civil service and taxing agencies, who provided not only much of the intermediate technology and the mercantile base to generate income, but also most of the machinery to tax it – revenue avidly needed by the kings to pay for their courts and their courtiers, their courtesans and their conflicts. By the fourteenth century the Jews of Spain constituted a significant segment of the population of every major city and many minor ones, their ratio to the general population often being as high as one third.31 The involvement and contribution of the Jewish artisans of Spain to its textile industry was considerable.32 We get a further sense of the integration and spread of their widespread participation in the crafts of Spain by what they were later banned from doing. For example, in 1415, Pope Benedict XIII banned Jewish craftsman from making crucifixes and ritual goblets, and in 1480 they were forbidden to paint images of Jesus and Mary. To see the Vizcaya carpet as it would have been seen by the Jews of medieval Spain, we need to know the significance of carpets in Jewish culture – which leads us to the next section. After that, we will look at the synergy of the Jewish weavers of Spain and North Africa around the time the Vizcaya carpet was woven. NOTES 1. R.

A Jewish testator in the second to third century BCE made a bequest to the Guild of Carpet Weavers and Purple Dyers of Hierapolis in Phrygia (North Syria) to decorate his tomb every Passover and Shavuot (J. Ungerleider-Mayerson, Jewish Folk Art from Biblical Days to Modern Times [New York: Summit Books, 1986], p.38). Many funerary portraits (not necessarily Jewish) of women holding weaving equipment have been found in Phrygia and Palmyra, and Jews had been settled in many of its major wool and weaving regions (including Gordium, where legends say Alexander the Great cut the Gordian knot) since at least the third century BCE. A leading expert has suggested that the provenance of the famous third- or fourth-century-BCE Pazyryk carpet – with its floral star patterns and rosettes – is neither Scythian nor Persian but was made by Phrygian weavers (Jacques Anquetel, Carpets, Techniques, Traditions and History [Paris: Octopus, 2003], citing Volkmar Gantzhorn,The Christian Oriental Carpet [Cologne: Benedikt Taschen, 1991]). Subsequently, in novel form, Bevis Longstreth proposed resolution of many of the numerous questions as to the provenance of this truly remarkable carpet with an innovative and imaginative leap by suggesting the designer/weaver might possibly have been a Jewish master weaver from Sardis, an important Jewish and carpet weaving centre at the time (Bevis Longstreth, ‘The Riddle of the Pazyryk’, Hali, 137 [November–December 2004], pp.49–51). 13.

One of the most interesting of the many interesting Jews who rose to power in the Iberian Peninsula under Islamic and Christian rule was Abu Yusuf Hasdai ibn Shaprut (c.915–c.970). Chief minister to Caliph Abd al-Rahman III (912–961), Hasdai negotiated treaties with Byzantium and with Rome, obtained protection for the Jews of southern Italy and wrote a famous letter to Joseph, King of the Khazars – a powerful Turkic tribe whose ruling classes had converted to Judaism. It was as a diplomat that he went to see Sancho the Fat, King of Leon and Navarre. Sancho’s barons had expelled him from Leon and he had fled to Tota, his grandmother, in Pamplona, the capital of Navarre. Hasdai negotiated with Sancho and, in return for the rights to ten fortresses, the Muslim caliph and his army led the Christian king and his grandmother in triumph back to Leon. Hasdai as a physician also cured Sancho of his obesity, or at least sufficiently so as to enable him to ride his horse – an essential attribute of kings. 19.

Wall paintings of 9,000 years ago in Anatolia point to the weaving in coloured wools of covers and wall hangings. Today in the Israel Museum in Jerusalem we may see a pre-Judaic weaving found in the Judean desert, just to the south-west of the Dead Sea, and carbon dated to the seventh millennium BCE. In addition, a herringbonepatterned, twill plaited straw mat dated to the fourth millennium BCE has recently been recovered from the Cave of the Warrior in the same region. But let us start some 3,800 years ago, in Akkad in Iraq: Abraham, the founding father of Jewish people, is preparing to leave Ur, a city whose economy is substantially based upon the wool industry. It is a city where a loom is to be found in almost every home, and its language has many words for different parts of the loom and different types of wool. So important was the production of textiles around the time of Abraham that Hammurabi, king of Akkad, had legislated to regulate the trade. Classifying the workers into fullers, spinners, dyers and weavers, he subdivided those groups into apprentices, craftsmen and masters. Then, distinguishing between slaves and freemen, he laid down laws providing protection for the slaves and the minimum wages to be paid to the freemen. Archaeology reveals that piled (knotted) textiles were woven there from at least the fifth millennium BCE.1 Eve, the first woman, is seen by some as the first spinner2 but in Jewish tradition it is Naamah, the daughter of Lamech and sister of Tubal-Cain, to whom all the secrets of spinning and weaving were revealed. Right from the\n\n24\n\nBackground Histories\n\nbeginning, textiles of all sorts were a significant component in Jewish culture.3 Indeed, they could not possibly have had a more auspicious start than at some time between the fifteenth and the thirteenth century BCE, when the Divinity issued very specific and detailed instructions as to how the framework and the flat kelim-type rugs and tent cloths for the Tabernacle were to be made: ‘You shall make a curtain of blue, purple and crimson yarns, and fine twisted linen; it shall have a design of cherubim worked into it.You shall make a screen for the entrance of the Tent, of blue, purple and crimson yarns, and fine twisted linen, done in embroidery.’ Exodus 26:31–3 and 36–7.4 (See below, note 13.) It was Aholiab, son of Ahisamach of the tribe of Dan5 (we can see how he was seen in Spain in the Middle Ages in Figure 4), who with the Israelite women wove the walls, floor and inner hangings of the Tabernacle – the mobile shrine to house the Tablets of the Law during the Israelites’ wanderings in the desert.6 Later exegesis describes this Holy Tent as having being placed in an open court bordered by fencing over which costly rugs were hung.7 The introduction into ancient Egypt of the vertical two-beamed loom with the domed spindle wheel and of other weaving techniques advanced greatly under the Hyksos, a partly Semitic tribe identified by many scholars with the patriarchal Israelites, so linking them to the biblical account of Joseph and of the Exodus. The Hyksos ruled from 1655 until 1570 BCE, when they were expelled towards Palestine, where archaeologists have discovered the frames of the new weighted loom dated to the 1450s. Fourteenth-century-BCE business papers from Syria mention textiles from Ashdod, a coastal town in the Land of Israel, and papyri from the Egyptian countryside in the Ptolemaic period (c.230–30 BCE) record Jews as weavers. Self-evidently, weaving has been an almost universal craft since the earliest times, but often enough we do not know the exact nature of the textile that the weavers wove, be they clothes, kelims, pile carpets et al. – the list is almost endless. Egyptian influence, however, during the years of exile was probably a key factor in the importance of the rugs, but it was also the practical realities of Israelite life in the Middle East that made weavings such critically fundamental functional and cultural artefacts. What else might more cheaply and effectively shade you from the sun during a wedding ceremony than the Chuppah – the bridal canopy? And help shade you, too, when celebrating the ingathering of the harvest, in the Sukkot booth? 8 And what else might better protect you from the cold ground at night than a rug to sleep\n\nThe Role of Carpets in Jewish Culture\n\n25\n\non? Even today, apart from a simple frame, almost the entirety of the nomad’s tent is made up of weavings; fittingly, an Arabic term for tent is Beit al-sha‘r – literally ‘house of hair’. Inside the tent, rugs have ever served as doorways, room dividers, wall and floor covers, sleeping bags, cushions, sacks and bags. Outside the tent, rugs have been used for saddlebags and ground covers. In life these critically functional weavings were media of exchange and stores of future value; in death, they would be funerary coverings. The weaving of fibrous material was fundamental to almost every civilization, with the very processes of spinning and weaving providing the setting in which oral tradition and folk memory might be nurtured and nourished, where concepts and customs were in turn memorialized in the wool and the silk textiles produced. Socrates himself affirmed that of the four skills essential to the Greek city state, the most important was the skill of the weaver.9 In the tenth century BCE, after the Israelites had settled in Israel, King Solomon built the First Temple in Jerusalem (c. 961–586). Echoing the textiles of the Tabernacle, the hanging in the Temple protecting the Holy of Holies was also coloured blue, purple, crimson and white and, according to subsequent exegesis, gold.10 Textiles and agriculture were the major industries of the Israelites. The significance of sheep and wool in the ninth century BCE is clear from both biblical and non-biblical sources. The Moabite Stone, dated to around 850 BCE, is the most valuable extant monument of Israelite history in its explicit, albeit incorrect, statement that Mesha, king of Moab, had destroyed Israel – the actual line translates as ‘And Israel perished with an everlasting destruction.’ The inscription goes on to record that Mesha’s spoils of victory were Israel’s sheep and shepherds. Just prior to the war it had been Mesha who was paying tribute to Israel, for 2 Kings 3:4 tells us: ‘Now Mesha, king of Moab, was a sheep breeder; and he had to deliver annually to the king of Israel a hundred thousand lambs and the wool of a hundred thousand rams.’ Recent archaeology reveals that the eighth- to seventh-century-BCE town Beit Mirsim was almost wholly devoted to weaving and dyeing, and findings from an eighth-century-BCE shipwreck discovered off the coast of Haifa included remnants of mats and other coverings. The first-century-CE hanging in the Second Temple (520 BCE–70 CE) was seen and described by the contemporary Jewish historian and soldier Flavius Josephus (c.38 to after 100 CE) as being ‘blue and white and scarlet and purple and of a truly wonderful texture’.11 Later descriptions also tell us this proto-parokhet was embroidered with flowers, plants and, interestingly, with stars (see Chapter 12);\n\n26\n\nBackground Histories\n\nit was the women weavers who kept the Temple hangings in repair, and in Christian apocrypha12 the Virgin Mary herself was chosen for this work. We are told what happened to it, for St Mark in his gospel (15:38) records that at the crucifixion, ‘the curtain of the temple was torn in two, from top to bottom’. In Jewish tradition, according to II Baruch (early second century CE), when Jerusalem finally fell to the Romans in 70 CE, as the Temple was being consumed in one vast conflagration, an angel appeared and rescued the parokhet. In the early biblical period recorded in the five books of Moses, people may not have sat on chairs at all, for not once is one mentioned. Significantly, however, there are numerous references to carpets.13 The panegyric detailing the attributes of the ideal wife includes her skills in collecting and spinning wool and flax, making and selling fine textiles and the weaving of kelims, for ‘she maketh herself a rug’.14 This is not an economic exhortation, it is a religious duty, carrying with it social purpose, for the working in wool was a yardstick of a woman’s worth and respectability. Again we see the critical centrality of weaving in the lives of the ancient Israelites in the dire warnings of Jeremiah: ‘Their tents and flocks shall be taken, their tent cloths and all their goods.’15 The contribution of weaving to Israelite and other cultures cannot be overestimated, for it was in the reflection and the rhythms of such daily work that the tales were told, retold and retained. It was in this spinning of the yarns that weaving became a natural metaphor in daily life, and still today, echoing down to us through the ages, we hear Job’s lament (7:6): ‘My days are swifter than a weaver’s shuttle.’ In the later biblical period, weaving may have become the speciality of a particular sub-clan, the house of Ashbea.16 Weaving craft guilds, often patrilineal, occur throughout the history of Jewish weaving. In the second century BCE, Ben Sirach in the Apocrypha stresses the importance of weaving among all the crafts,17 and in the book of Tobit, it is his wife, Anna, who during his four years of blindness keeps the family alive by selling her weavings. Nonbiblical sources of the same century tell us of a Jewish weaver at work not in Israel but in Upper Egypt. Later the Talmud could not have more clearly spelled out the primacy of textiles, reinforcing the injunction of the biblical panegyric cited above, for it decreed that even if a wife has brought her husband 100 maidservants, yet still should she work with wool.18 It is no surprise that there is hardly an archaeological site in Israel today (and indeed throughout the eastern Mediterranean) that has not yielded up\n\nThe Role of Carpets in Jewish Culture\n\n27\n\nnumerous loom weights. In Oxyrhynchus roughly half of the working population was engaged in the textile trade. As Israelite society expanded and developed, with all its ups and downs, so did the importance of the weaver. In 70 CE when the Romans vanquished Judea, the numbers and economic importance of the weavers was clear. For example, in Jerusalem, in life they gathered together in their own synagogue and in death were buried in their own weavers’ cemetery, and in other major towns, including Lydda, Sepphoris and Tiberias, the weavers’ guilds also maintained their own synagogues.19 The master weavers who formed these guilds were called Tarsim, after Tarsus, the great rug and tent weaving centre in what is now Turkey, but the socio-economic status of the everyday commercial weaver, varying in time and place, was usually less elevated. In the Middle Ages some communities in France did not accept their testimony in legal proceedings. Under Roman rule the most important centre was probably Beth Shean, where Jews also dominated the interrelated crafts of weaving and dyeing. In Figure 5 we can see an example of their work. There, depicted in the mosaic floor of the Beth Shean Synagogue, is a parokhet hanging before the Ark. We shall examine it in more detail shortly. The Talmud noted the ‘fine linen vestments that come from Beth Shean’,20 as did the Roman emperor Diocletian in his ‘Edict of Maximum Prices’.21 In the first century in Hierapolis in Phrygia we learn of the guild of purple dyers and carpet weavers whose members were either mainly or entirely Jewish.22 Even under Roman and then Hellenistic rule, textile production was, after agriculture, the major industry in Palestine and, right up to the time of the Arab conquest in 634, Sepphoris and Tiberias continued to be famous for their mats and other weavings.23 Some historians report that Jewish carpet weavers were active throughout the entire 1,000 years of the Roman Empire (third century BCE to seventh century CE).24 Apart from the wealth of evidence provided by secondary sources, we may see today significant surviving fragments from 70 CE and 135 CE (Chapter 2) and from the third-century findings at Dura Europos.25 Special textiles woven with pictures of fabulous beasts were, according to the fourth-century Roman poet Claudius Claudianus, known as ‘Jewish veils’.26 In Chapter 4 we continue the story of Jewish carpets in Spain and North Africa. Weaving, one of the most mundane and repetitive events in everyday life, is embedded in Judaism. It is the fate of most artisans and craftsmen to live, to create and to die, leaving barely a trace behind, and carpet weavers and designers are no exception. From the second century onwards, tombs\n\n28\n\nBackground Histories\n\ndisplaying spindles and whorls have been found in major weaving centres such as Beit Shean and Beit Shearim, although it seems this practice was not approved by the rabbis. So it is that the ageless and enormous contribution of the Jews to textile and carpet weaving has also largely faded from history, for there is so little information available and such information as we have crops up by chance – being tangential to biblical or Talmudic writing, historical, geographic and military reports, the rabbinic Responsa (the written replies of prominent Rabbis to questions put to them, usually on matters of interpretation of Jewish law) or through the work of archaeologists. So, for example, we see the importance of textiles from the thirty-nine different types of work that may not be done on the Sabbath: no less than twelve are associated with the production of textiles.27 It is only by plucking out and bringing together these diverse and peripheral pieces of information that we may glean any sense of the extent of the involvement in and contribution of Jews to textile and carpet weaving over the millennia. Occasionally we do learn of the names of Jewish weavers through their significance in other contexts. Flavius Josephus records the activities of a weaver named Jonathan who, in the aftermath of the destruction of the Temple, had fled to the Jewish community in Cyrenaica, probably in 73 CE. He must have been a charismatic figure, for he raised a large army among the local Jews directed to destroy the Roman regime and inaugurate the messianic era. Josephus also tells us of two Jewish brothers, Asinaeus and Anilaeus. Apprenticed by their widowed mother to a carpet weaver in the major Jewish centre of Nehardea in Babylon, they abandoned weaving to become leaders of a powerful band waging war against the Parthian King Artabanus III28 and for some fifteen years they actually ruled their own independent Jewish state. Then in 351, led by Patricius, the great weaving regions of Sepphoris and Tiberius rose in revolt against Rome – but to no avail. In Persia, the Babylonian Talmud, noting the extent of carpet weaving under Sasanian rule,29 records a dispute between the weavers of Pumbedita and the wool merchants, which was settled by Rabbi Kahana.30 In another dispute in Persia, the chanting of the weavers in their workshop was banned by Rav Huna but, rather mysteriously, the work songs of the boat hauliers and the ploughmen were not so interdicted.31 So much has disappeared, but the mosaic floor of the sixth-century synagogue at Beit Alpha is considered by some to have been worked directly by local craftsman from pattern books intended for textiles or mosaics. The style and design of the floor may be all\n\nThe Role of Carpets in Jewish Culture\n\n29\n\nthat has survived of the lost Jewish art of weaving which flourished in Scythopolis – an art form that may have been created by the descendants of the Jewish weavers who had fled Scythopolis during a crisis in the state-controlled weaving factories in the fourth century.32 Occasionally we are privileged to see a Jewish carpet of the Byzantine era – or at least its image painted on the walls or set in mosaic on the floors of the synagogues of the time. My favourite Byzantine Jewish carpet is the finely detailed hanging before the Ark portrayed in the mosaic floor of the sixthcentury synagogue at Beth Shean. Suspended by seven rings on a rail, its triangular forms on the upper border are echoed at random on the central field, and eight fringes hang from a wide band at the lower end of the carpet (Figure 5). By their very nature, and by the nature of Jewish history, few Jewish carpets and textiles have survived, yet from the secondary sources it is clear that they formed a vibrant thread running through the rich tapestry of Jewish history. They are manifestations, indeed cultural chronicles, of the historic processes of both change and continuity that the Jews have undergone over the past 2,000 years in Roman, Greek, Persian, Christian, Islamic and Communist societies. Aholiab, that first known weaver, has been followed ever since by numerous honoured Jewish weavers and designers, including St Paul,33 Rashi (1040–1105) (the great Talmudic commentator) and, in our time, Marc Chagall (who designed the carpets replete with biblical iconography which grace the parliament of the State of Israel).34 Today at the Passover table, the festival recalling the Israelites’ escape from bondage in the land of Egypt, Jews do not sit upright but lean to one side, possibly also recalling the time when nomadic Israelites, at ease on their carpets, would also have been lounging to one side. In Figure 6, a rare picture, drawn and painted in fifteenth-century Spain, we see a Jewish family leaning to one side as they celebrate the Passover. With these potted histories of the Jews of Spain and of the role of the carpet as a significant cultural artefact in Judaism we are now able to place the Jewish weavers and traders of Spain into the context of their times. In the next chapter I shall review the strength and the organic unity of their weaving communities throughout the Mediterranean under Islam,35 the Jewish weavers of Alexandria, the Sephardic craft guilds, the relevant findings in the Cairo Genizah, and the implications for the Jewish weavers of Murcia of the flight of the Muslim weavers in the face of the Christian conquest of the region. I conclude with some thoughts about the Mamluk carpets and the\n\nBackground Histories\n\n30\n\nenormous expansion of the weaving and carpet industry under the Ottoman Empire created by the Jewish weavers who had sought refuge there in the years leading up to and following their expulsion from Spain in 1492.

It calls to mind that timeless questioning couplet of early English social dissent: When Adam delved and Eve span, Who was then the gentleman?’ 3. I would not include the two carpets of Pharaoh Akhenaten’s (1379–62 BCE) that we know of, one being a pile carpet that is seen to be a wall painting (R. Izady Mehrdad, The Kurds: A Concise Handbook [London: Taylor & Francis, 1992], p.250), the other being a sack woven in a carpet weaving technique excavated at his capital city of el-Amarna (E. Barber, Prehistoric Textiles [Princeton, NJ: Princeton University Press, 1991], p.49, n.6), as in this category of the earliest Jewish carpet. Current scholarship does not give much weight to Sigmund Freud’s suggestion that Moses may have been an Egyptian high priest who kept Akhenaten’s near monotheism alive by fleeing Egypt. The similarity, however, between Akhenaton’s hymn to his all-powerful god Aton and Psalm 104 is remarkable. 4. Exodus 26:31–3, 36–7; 2 Chronicles 3:14. 5. Exodus 26; 31:1–6. 6.
