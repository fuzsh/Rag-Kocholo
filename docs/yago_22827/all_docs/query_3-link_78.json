He was a frequent visitor to the Aviation Hall of Fame, located next to the National Museum of the United States Air Force. He would fly in his own place from New York to Dayton to attend the Hall of Fame's Enshrinement ceremonies. His participation resulted in his own enshrinement in the Hall of Fame in 2006.\n\nRoberston attended Antioch College, studying journalism and broadcasting before going to California to pursue an acting career."
