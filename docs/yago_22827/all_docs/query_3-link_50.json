        "text": "1963\n\nCity Locations\n\nFlorida; Burbank, CA (USA)\n\nLocation Types\n\nFilm Studio, Hotel\n\nLocation Styles\n\nBeachfront, Boat Style, Craftsman, Dated/50's-60's-70's, Shipping Yard/Dock\n\nAbout PT 109\n\nFrom the heart of 1960s filmmaking comes PT 109, a legendary biographical war picture skillfully directed by Leslie H. Martinson. With this 1963 production, Martinson â renowned for his detailed commitment to storytelling â displayed his first-rate directing abilities. Cliff Robertson, James Gregory, Ty Hardin, Robert Culp, and Grant Williams are among the brilliant actors who bring this exciting combat story to life in the film. PT 109 takes audiences back to the turbulent times of World War II, offering a glimpse into the heroic feats of future president John F. Kennedy. Cliff Robertson portrays the young Kennedy, an officer of the United States Navy. In a story that unfolds across the vast Pacific theater, viewers are taken on a journey through Kennedy's trials and tribulations as he assumes command over Motor Torpedo Boat PT-109. The film brilliantly captures Kennedy's grit and determination as he musters the courage to make the boat seaworthy while simultaneously battling the ruthless nature of war. His bravery continues to shine through his rescue of paramarines and the suspenseful sequence of the Japanese destroyer ramming and sinking the PT-109. Amidst this dire situation, the narrative dramatizes Kennedy's leadership in ensuring his crew's survival and eventual rescue. While PT 109 did not secure specific awards, it is a testament to the resilience and bravery of those who served during World War II. This film is an ode to heroism, a must-watch for historians and cinema enthusiasts who appreciate the delicate blend of factual accuracy and engaging storytelling.\n\nPT 109 Locations\n\nPT 109's production makes excellent use of the breathtaking vistas of Florida and the Keys. Little Palm Island, formerly known as Little Munson Island, is now a resort in the Florida Keys and was the site of most of the outside scenes. This island was transformed into a resort because of its tranquil beauty and because it met the film's practical requirements for power and freshwater. With verdant foliage, powdery white beaches, and the serene azure waves of the Atlantic Ocean as its backdrop, Little Palm Island is a picture-perfect paradise. The neighboring islands of the Florida Keys, each with its distinct attractions and breathtaking scenery, are nearby, as is the world-famous Key West, famed for its lively nightlife, eclectic allure, and rich history. Key West, Florida, was chosen as a stand-in for the Solomon Island of Tulagi, an area captured by the Japanese by U.S. Marines in August 1942. This location served as the base for the U.S. PT Boat fleet for a year during the war. The replication of the Solomon Islands' environment in Key West added authenticity to the film's narrative, with the tropical climate and similar marine surroundings. A trip to these locations would certainly be worthwhile, not only for the historical significance linked to PT 109 but also for the inherent beauty and charm of the Florida Keys. Rumors of another U.S. invasion of Cuba, sparked by the construction of sets and the presence of boats during filming, add an intriguing layer of mystery and intrigue to these locations. The Florida Keys blend relaxation, adventure, and history, making them a perfect destination for film fans and travelers.\n\nIn the Solomon Islands, Lt. John F. Kennedy (Cliff Robertson) arrives at the PT boat base at Tulagi. During persistent Japanese air attacks and cunning yeomen, he becomes acquainted with Commander C.R. Ritchie (James Gregory). At the beginning of their joint voyage, Kennedy's route crosses with his new commanding officer, Lt. Alvin Cluster (Grant Williams). The exteriors for these sequences were shot on Little Palm Island, originally known as Little Munson Island, now a luxurious resort in the Florida Keys. The sequences set in the Solomon Islands were well complemented by the island's calm and natural beauty. Little Palm Island is an isolated island sanctuary characterized by pathways of crushed seashells, flourishing tropical vegetation, and varied fauna. It is located off the renowned Florida Keys shoreline. The thatched-roof bungalows that dot this one-of-a-kind resort are a design nod to the British West Indies; they provide a breathtaking scene that reflects the story's tropical location. With its indoor/outdoor spa, the resort exudes an exotic charm reminiscent of a Balinese getaway. Getting to this location is an adventure in itself. Once you arrive at Little Torch Key, the resort will provide a motor yacht for the voyage to Little Palm Island. Another option is to take a seaplane straight to the island, giving you a breathtaking view of the Florida Keys from above. Furthermore, one can reach Key West from Miami by car, taking the US-1 S route. The drive typically lasts around 2 hours and 40 minutes.\n\nAt dawn, the survivors clutch the remnants of the PT 109 as their leader, Kennedy (Cliff Robertson), courageously decides to swim toward the nearest uninhabited island. The foredeck capsizes no sooner than the crew deserts the ship, compelling Kennedy and his men to swim a daunting three and a half miles to reach dry land. Like most of the production, this scene was filmed at Stage 16 at Warner Bros. Studios. In 1937, Stage 7 was elevated by 30 feet and rechristened as Stage 16, transforming it into a 98-foot high stage equipped with a 2-million-gallon water tank. This stage is among the largest in the world and has been utilized for filming scenes from renowned films such as 'The Goonies' (1985), 'The Perfect Storm' (2000), and 'Dunkirk' (2017). It is also featured in 'La La Land' (2016), where characters played by Ryan Gosling and Emma Stone can be seen walking. In Burbank, Warner Bros. Studios is one of the oldest film studios globally and has been a public attraction since 1973. Visitors can take a behind-the-scenes tour and experience the magic of filmmaking firsthand. To visit Warner Bros. Studios, you can fly into Los Angeles International Airport (LAX). From the airport, Burbank is about a 30-minute drive. You can rent a car, take a taxi, or use a ride-sharing service. Once in Burbank, follow the signs to Warner Bros. Studios at 4000 Warner Boulevard.\n\nIn a thrilling scene, Ritchie (James Gregory), initially ordered to remain at Tulagi, confronts the flotilla commander and arranges his transfer to Rendova with the PT 109 crew. On their journey, they are attacked by a Japanese fighter plane. Standing beside the 20-mm machine gun at the stern, Ritchie persuades the gunner to allow him to take a shot - and successfully downs the attacking aircraft. This scene was filmed on location in Key West, Florida, which served as a stand-in for the Solomon Island of Tulagi. This area was captured by the Japanese by the U.S. Marines in August 1942 and was the base for the U.S. PT Boat fleet for a year. Directed by Milestone, the production took advantage of Key West's unique landscape and ambiance for these scenes. Key West, a city situated on an island within the Florida Keys archipelago, holds the distinction of being Florida's southernmost point, positioned approximately 90 miles north of Cuba. The city is celebrated for its charming pastel-hued, conch-style homes and vibrant coral reefs, attracting diving and snorkeling enthusiasts. Frequently visited by cruise ships, Key West is also accessible from mainland Florida via the scenic Overseas Highway. To get to Key West, you can fly into Miami International Airport or Ft. Lauderdale-Hollywood International Airport and then take a connecting flight to Key West International Airport. You can also drive from Miami; it's a scenic trip along the Overseas Highway, which takes roughly three and a half hours. Once in Key West, the city is compact enough to explore on foot, by bicycle, or by renting a golf cart.\n\nPT 109 has received mixed reviews for its characters, action, and humor. The production was criticized for lacking a sense of reality, with too many shots on sound stages and in the studio tank. Despite this, the film's utilization of real-life settings, such as Florida's Key West and Little Palm Island, enhanced its realism and aesthetic appeal. One of the best parts of the film is the outdoor sequences that take place at these venues. Regarding its impact on the film business, PT 109 is a criticism-laden biopic that shows another side of a famous politician. As a result of its production, Little Palm Island was transformed into a resort, which boosted the tourism business. PT 109's historical importance, engaging plot, and stunning cinematography make it a film that everyone should see once. The film's settings, especially Little Palm Island, are worth visiting for their historical significance, scenic beauty, and tranquility."
