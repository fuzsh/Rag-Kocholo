        "text": "Directed by Fielder Cook\n\nWhen the intelligence of a laboratory mouse named Algernon is improved by an experimental operation, Charlie Gordon, a gentle young man of limited mental capacity is persuaded to undergo a similar surgical procedure. While the results are astounding, and although Charlie is transformed into a genius, it is by no means certain whether the effect will be permanent or merely temporary.\n\nCliff Robertson received an Emmy nomination for his sensitive portrayal of Charlie in this adaptation of Daniel Keyes' Hugo Award-winning short story \"Flowers for Algernon,\" which Keyes turned into a Nebula Award-winning novel in 1966, and which later became a movie, a stage play, a Broadway musical and a radio drama. In 1968, Robertson was awarded a well-deserved \"Best Actor\" Oscar for his performance as the same character in the motion picture Charly.\n\n–Dan Einstein\n\nCBS A Theatre Guild Production Executive Producer: George Kondolf Writer: James Yaffe Based on the short story \"Flowers for Algernon\" by Daniel Keyes Cast: Cliff Robertson. Mona Freeman. Maxwell Shaw. Joanna Roos\n\nBetacamSP tape of program originally produced on 2\" videotape, 60 min.\n\nVideo transfer at the CBS Videotape Annex. Special thanks to: Marilyn and Philip Langner.\n\nDirected by Tom Donovan\n\nCliff Robertson stars as Horace Mann Borden, a famous former child prodigy who, having been pushed hard from infancy by his father to achieve great things, has now turned his back on the world, his brainpower and his reputation. He spends his days going to endless movies and avoiding human contact until a beautiful young woman moves in next door. She is determined to break down the wall he has erected between himself and the world, and attempts to restore his faith in humankind and in himself.\n\nThis is the third presentation of Robert Alan Aurthur's Sylvania Award-winning teleplay; it had previously been broadcast on \"The Philco Television Playhouse\" in 1954. and on the British lTV network's \"Armchair Theatre\" series in mid-1961 just a few months prior to this \"United States Steel Hour\" production.\n\n–Dan Einstein\n\nCBS A Theatre Guild Production Executive Producer: George Kondolf Writer: Robert Alan Aurthur Cast: Cliff Robertson.
