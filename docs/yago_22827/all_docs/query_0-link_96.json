        "text": "The iconic actor Cliff Robertson has died at the age of 88. Most remembered by this generation as Peter Parker’s Uncle Ben in the highly successful Spider-Man movies, Robertson had a long and distinguished career as a leading man, character actor, producer, writer and director.\n\nHis career began on the big screen in the film “Picnic” in 1955. He went on to star in such landmark early TV genre shows as the original “Twilight Zone,” “The Outer Limits” and portraying Shame on the 1960’s Batman television series with Adam West. Besides Spider-Man some of his other genre films are “Brainstorm” with Christopher Walken and Natalie Wood, and “Escape from L.A.” which also starred Kurt Russell, Steve Buscemi and Peter Fonda.\n\nHe also made inroads in early TV with such shows as “Wagon Train,” “The Untouchables” and the highly respected “Playhouse 90.”\n\nBesides “Picnic” some of his other notable films were “Up From the Beach,” “Three Days of the Condor,” J.W. Coop,” his Oscar winning film “Charley” and probably the film he will always be most remembered for “PT 109” in which he played a young naval officer by the name of John F. Kennedy during World War II.\n\nMr. Robertson turned 88 one day before his death. He is survived by a daughter and grandchild."
