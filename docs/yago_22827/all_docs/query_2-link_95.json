        "text": "Oscar-winning US actor Cliff Robertson died yesterday, one day after his 88th birthday.\n\nHis secretary announced that he died in New York state of natural causes, according to the BBC.\n\nRobertson was born in LA in 1923. He started acting as early as 1943, and rose to prominence with his performance as future president John F Kennedy in 1963's PT 109 , a drama about the young man's wartime experiences.\n\nHe was apparently JFK's first choice to play his younger self.\n\nIt was the 1968 film Charly , an adaptation of Flowers For Algernon , that won Robertson the Academy Award for Best Actor.\n\nFrom 1977 to 1983, Robertson found himself blacklisted in Hollywood after blowing the whistle on an embezzlement scam.\n\nAmong his other notable movies were Three Days In The Condor , Brian De Palma's Obsession , and J.W. Coop (which he wrote and directed as well as starring in).\n\nHe will, of course, probably be best remembered by the current generation of cinemagoers as Peter Parker's wise Uncle Ben in Sam Raimi's Spider-Man .\n\nHe went on to appear (in flashback form) in Spideys 2 and 3 .\n\nOur thoughts go out to his family and friends."
