COOP group of 3 4x5 transparencies 1972 rodeo cowboy Cliff Robertson, Cristina Ferrare!\n\nDate Sold 6/10/2018\n\nSold For: Login or Register to see sold price.\n\nA Group Of 3 Original Vintage Photographic Transparencies (measure 4\" x 5\" [10 x 13 cm]) (Learn More)\n\nJ.W. Coop, the 1972 Cliff Robertson bull riding rodeo cowboy action melodrama (\"For J.W. COOP, second place is the same as last.\"; \"Rodeo Cowboy Assn. World Champion All Around Cowboy\") starring Cliff Robertson (in the title role as J.W. Coop), Geraldine Page, Cristina Ferrare, R.G. Armstrong, and R.L. Armstrong\n\nNOTE: Click on linked names to see a biography.\n\nImportant Added Info: Note that these are studio-issued transparencies that are produced by the studio but are not the camera originals. When a smaller format film was originally used, a larger copy transparency was often made by the studio so that retouching could be added and sent out or used for approved publication purposes. The transparencies are each in a plastic sleeve (but we removed them and scanned them, so that bidders could see just how high quality they are). They will be sent to the winner of the auction in the plastic sleeves.\n\nThis is a very special auction of 444 extremely rare negatives and transparencies of various sizes. EVERY single one in this auction is either \"studio issued\" (meaning it was created by the studio and sent to theaters and movie outlets), OR it is a \"camera original\" (meaning it was the actual negative that was in the camera when the photographer took the picture). Every auction clearly identifies which they are, and there are no items being auctioned that are not either \"studio issue\" or \"camera originals\". We have divided them by type and size.\n\nAlso note that every one of these 444 auctions have had their transparencies and/or negatives scanned expertly. This auction contains that scan with the \"eMoviePoster.com\" watermark over it. ONLY the winner of this auction will, on request, be sent UNWATERMARKED scan(s) of the items in this auction, which will both save them the time and expense of scanning them themselves, and also allow them to make high quality positive prints of the items they purchased.\n\nCondition: very good to fine. The transparencies are in nice condition!\n\nLearn More about condition grades\n\nPostal Mailing Address:\n\nBruce Hershenson, P.O.
