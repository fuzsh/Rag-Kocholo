        "text": "Charly, American film drama, released in 1968, that was an adaptation of Daniel Keyes’s short story “Flowers for Algernon.” Cliff Robertson, in the title role, won an Academy Award for best actor.\n\nCharly Gordon (played by Robertson) is an intellectually disabled baker who is asked to undergo an experimental surgery. The surgery—which had dramatically increased the intelligence of a mouse named Algernon—turns Charly into a genius. His new life proves to be a mixed blessing, however. Charly experiences fame and falls in love with his teacher (played by Claire Bloom), but he also sees how many of his “friends” were mocking and exploiting him. Charly eventually learns that his intellectual prowess is only temporary, and he reverts back to his original self.\n\nBritannica Quiz\n\nBest Picture Movie Quote Quiz"
