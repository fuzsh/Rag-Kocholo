        "text": "Starts off strong, with an evocative feel for men returning from prision to small, dying towns. After that, quicksand. Cliff Robertson produced, directed, co-wrote, and starred in the title role of this involving film about a rodeo rider's attempt to adjust to a life on the outside after spending ten years in prison. Both society and the rodeo have changed dramatically during Coop's incarceration, and he struggles to adapt as he undertakes a relationship with Bean (Cristina Ferrare) while going after the national championship. The cast features members of the Rodeo Cowboys Association, and much of the action footage was shot during actual rodeo events. The first half hour is Robertson at his best because he's reacting; after that, bum steer."
