        "text": "ST. JOHN THE BAPTIST’S PARISH, FONCHA STREET – BAMENDA\n\nFRIDAY, 26 APRIL 2019\n\nT\n\nThe following homily was delivered in St. John The Baptist Church Foncha Street Nkwen, Archdiocese of Bamenda, during the Ruby Jubilee celebration of Rev. Fr. John Bintum’s Priestly ordination. The preacher was the eminent Rev. Father Zephyrinus Yem Mbuh.\n\nMy dear brothers and sisters in Christ,\n\nWe gather here at Saint John the Baptist Church, Foncha Street, in union with\n\nFather John Bintum to celebrate the 40 Anniversary of his Priestly Ordination or\n\nRuby Jubilee, as the 40th Anniversary is also called. On this occasion, it would have\n\nbeen fitting to take the Prayers and Readings of Mass for Giving Thanks to God\n\nfor the many blessings he has bestowed on Father John and on all others, whose\n\nspiritual needs he may have attended to for the past 40 years. However, in union\n\nwith the Roman Catholic Church, today we take the Prayers and Readings of Friday\n\nwithin the Octave of Easter, since Liturgical Law asks us to do so. In the Order for\n\nthe Celebration of Mass and the Liturgy of the Hours for the Liturgical Year 2018-\n\n2019, we would see that no other celebrations are permitted on the eight days\n\nfollowing Easter Sunday, except funeral Masses. However, given the importance\n\nof the occasion that has brought us here today, we have chosen a second reading\n\nfrom the Readings provided in the Lectionary for Mass for Giving Thanks to God.\n\nWe may have noticed that all the readings of this Mass are taken from the New\n\nTestament. It is no error. As far back as Saint Cyril of Jerusalem (315-386),\n\nthe practice of not reading the Old Testament at Mass during the Easter Season\n\nwas already in place. On the weekdays of Easter, in fact, the Book of the Acts\n\nof the Apostles is read in a continuous way, till the end of the Easter Season.\n\nOn Sundays of Easter, the second readings are respectively taken from the First\n\nLetter of Saint Peter in Year A, the First Letter of Saint John in Year B, and\n\nthe Book of Revelation in Year C. The Gospel readings are for the most part\n\nfrom the Gospel according to John. The logic of this arrangement is based on\n\nthe practice of looking forward from the Resurrection, after looking back on\n\nour salvation history during the Easter Vigil. All of this helps to focus our\n\nattention on the celebration of the Resurrection and to keep us looking forward\n\nfrom the Resurrection Event to our present day.\n\nAs earlier mentioned, we have come here today as family and friends of Father\n\nJohn Bintum, in order that together with him we may celebrate his Ruby Jubilee.\n\nIt may be important for us to look briefly at the word jubilee. To look at the origin\n\nand meaning of the word jubilee, we cannot avoid going back to the Book of\n\nLeviticus, even if it is the Old Testament and we are here at a Eucharistic\n\nCelebration during Easter, a context in which the Old Testament is not officially\n\nread. In the Book of Leviticus 25:8-13, we read:\n\n“You will count seven weeks of years – seven times seven years, that is to say\n\na period of seven weeks of years, forty-nine years. And on the tenth day of\n\nthe seventh month you will sound the trumpet; on the Day of Expiation you\n\nwill sound the trumpet throughout the land. You will declare this fiftieth year\n\nto be sacred and proclaim the liberation of all the country’s inhabitants. You\n\nwill keep this as a jubilee: each of you will return to his ancestral property,\n\neach to his own clan. This fiftieth year will be a jubilee year for you; in it you\n\nwill not sow, you will not harvest the grain that has come up on its own or in\n\nit gather grapes from your untrimmed vine. The jubilee will be a holy thing\n\n2\n\nfor you; during it you will eat whatever the fields produce. In this year of\n\njubilee, each of you will return to his ancestral property.”\n\n1\n\nFrom this text it is clear that for the Israelites the fiftieth year was significant and\n\nspecial. God himself decreed that the Israelites were to observe the fiftieth year as\n\na year of jubilee, a sacred year. The significance of the fiftieth year did not end with\n\nthe Israelites. It has come down to our own times and we call it ‘golden jubilee’.\n\nHowever, the question remains: What is a jubilee?\n\nThe origin of the word jubilee is not very certain. However, some scholars have\n\nsuggested that it derives from the Hebrew jobel, which literally means the horn of\n\na ram. From the horn of a ram, which the Israelites used to declare the year of\n\njubilee, a certain idea of rejoicing developed. Whether we look at the Hebrew jobel\n\nor at the Greek iobelaios or iobelos or at the Latin jubilo, jubilatio and jubilaeum,\n\nwhich most European languages have adopted, we need to realise that the idea of\n\njoy runs through all of these concepts.\n\n2\n\nFor the Israelites, the Year of Jubilee was in any case pre-eminently a year of joy, a\n\nyear of remission or universal pardon. Remember the text of Leviticus 25:10 that\n\nsays: “You will declare this fiftieth year to be sacred and proclaim the liberation of\n\nall the country’s inhabitants“. How would people be free if their debts are not\n\ncancelled and their sins forgiven? Every seventh year, like every seventh day, was\n\nalways seen to be holy and set aside for rest, call it a sabbatical year; but the year\n\nwhich followed seven complete cycles was to be kept as a sabbatical year of special\n\nsolemnity. In the year of jubilee every household recovered its absent members,\n\nLeviticus 25:8-13 [The New Jerusalem Bible. Pocket Edition]\n\n1 2\n\nCf. CATHOLIC ENCYCLOPEDIA: “Holy Year of Jubilee” at http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08531c.htm\n\n3\n\nthe land returned to its former owners, the Hebrew slaves were set free, and debts\n\nremitted.\n\n3\n\nThe Christian Jubilee has taken up the content of the Hebrew Jubilee and made it\n\nChristian. Pope Boniface VIII instituted the first Christian Jubilee for the entire\n\nRoman Catholic world in the year 1300. However, the idea of solemnizing a fiftieth\n\nanniversary was already familiar to medieval writers, through their knowledge of\n\nthe Bible.\n\n4\n\nWe have come to know jubilee as the twenty-fifth anniversary (also known as silver\n\njubilee), fortieth anniversary (also known as ruby jubilee), fiftieth anniversary (also\n\nknown as golden jubilee), sixtieth or seventy-fifth anniversary (also known as\n\ndiamond jubilee). In the Roman Catholic Church, a jubilee is simply an appointed\n\nyear or other period in which a plenary indulgence is granted upon repentance and\n\nthe performance of certain religious acts. This is ordinarily celebrated every 25\n\nyears, for instance, the fiftieth anniversary of the conclusion of the Second Vatican\n\nCouncil. This is an ordinary jubilee. It could also be a period of time declared by\n\nthe Holy Father as a time of rejoicing, when a plenary indulgence is granted upon\n\nrepentance and the performance of certain religious acts, for instance, the Year of\n\nPriests. This is an extraordinary jubilee.\n\nOur concern today is the 40 Anniversary or Ruby Jubilee of Rev. Father John\n\nth\n\nBintum. The first thing that comes to mind when someone thinks of celebrating\n\nhis or her anniversary is gratitude. Today, in union with Father John, we thank\n\nGod for the blessings he has bestowed on him thus far. From his mother’s womb,\n\nCf. CATHOLIC ENCYCLOPEDIA: Ibid.\n\n3 4\n\nCf. CATHOLIC ENCYCLOPEDIA: Ibid.\n\n4\n\nGod chose him and consecrated him to be a prophet (cf. Jeremiah 1:5). I am sure\n\nFather John is thanking God today for his parents, who are both of blessed\n\nmemory, and asking God to grant them eternal rest in his kingdom. He is thanking\n\nGod for his teachers in primary school, in Saint Augustine’s College Nso, in Bishop\n\nRogan College Soppo – Buea, and for his formators in Saint Thomas Aquinas’\n\nMajor Seminary Bambui. He is thanking God for Father Paul Verdzekov,\n\nArchbishop Emeritus of Bamenda, who focussed on the strengths and prospects\n\nof the young John Bintum and decided to ordain him as a Priest of the Roman\n\nCatholic Church for the then Diocese of Bamenda on Thursday, 19 April 1979.\n\nth\n\nFather John Bintum happens to be among the first batch of Priests trained in Saint\n\nThomas Aquinas’ Major Seminary Bambui, with the Very Rev. Father Christian\n\nWiyghan Tumi as their pioneer Rector. It is worth noting that in 1978 the Very\n\nRev. Father Christian Wiyghan Tumi was appointed Bishop of Yagoua and in\n\n1988 he was created first and lone Cardinal of Cameroon. Of the nine candidates,\n\nwho became Priests from the pioneer batch of Bambui, Father John Bintum was\n\nordained along with Father Joseph Akem, Father William Tardze, Father Anthony\n\nViban, Father Patrick Adeso, and Father Joseph Veranso for the then Diocese of\n\nBamenda. In 1982, when the Diocese of Kumbo was erected Father Patrick Adeso\n\nand Father Joseph Veranso chose the new Diocese of Kumbo. Father Edward\n\nNgalame and Father Moses Tazoh were ordained for the Diocese of Buea and\n\nFather Gerard Toumagni was ordained for the then Diocese of Garoua. This first\n\nbatch of Priests from Bambui celebrates 40 years in the Priesthood in the absence\n\nof Father Patrick Adeso, Father Joseph Veranso and Father Gerard Toumagni,\n\nwho have been called to eternity at different times. I am sure that today Father\n\nJohn is also praying for their eternal repose.\n\n5\n\nFather John thanks God today for his family and friends, people who have\n\njourneyed with him for the past 69 years of his life on earth. His call to the\n\nPriesthood exposed him to all kinds of people in the Archdiocese of Bamenda\n\nand beyond. Some of these people have been a source of great encouragement to\n\nhim. I am not going to attempt any listing of such persons, for fear I leave out those\n\nwho deserve to be mentioned. However, I wish to draw Father John’s attention to\n\nthose who made life very difficult for him, right from the early years of his priestly\n\nministry to this day. You may have felt bad about them, as you should humanly\n\nfeel; you may have felt hated, discriminated against and sought different ways to\n\ndefend yourself; you may have felt discouraged and asked, ‘Why me?’. I guess\n\nmost of such persons may not have been aware of what they were effectively doing\n\nto you. For them you can and should pray the prayer of Jesus on the cross: “Father,\n\nforgive them, for they know not what they do.” (Luke 23:34). Those of them who\n\nwere aware may have had the intention to make life impossible for you, but\n\nironically they contributed to strengthen you, to make you develop the kind of\n\nresilience that would keep you afloat on the troubled waters they created for you,\n\nto make you a more holistic person.\n\nA Priest does not bear grudges! In fact, he is called to annul grudges. It is in the\n\nvery essence of his ministry to reconcile conflicting parties. Father John, I hereby\n\ninvite you to look back at the past 40 years and why not at your entire lifetime,\n\nidentify those persons who may have hurt you most. After having identified them\n\nand the impact of their hurt, then embrace the challenge to forgive them from your\n\nheart. It is only after you have forgiven them that you will be better placed to ask\n\nthem for forgiveness, for being a no-nonsense person as you have always been,\n\nthere is no doubt that you would have sometimes intentionally stepped on others’\n\ntoes. Remember the conclusion to the parable of the unforgiving servant:\n\n6\n\n“‘You wicked servant! I forgave all your debt because you begged me.\n\nShouldn’t you have had mercy on your fellow servant, just as I had on\n\nyou?’ In anger his master turned him over to the jailers to be tortured,\n\nuntil he should repay all that he owed. That is how My Heavenly Father\n\nwill treat each of you unless you forgive your brother from your heart.”\n\n(Matthew 18:32-35)\n\nA Priest is fondly called Father. Somebody has jokingly observed that the best way\n\nfor son to punish his father is to become a Priest, so his father can call him Father.\n\nThere is no punishment in calling a Priest ‘Father’. Rather, the Priest should see\n\nin the title of ‘Father’ an invitation to realise that as Father, he assumes\n\nresponsibility for the community put under his pastoral care; he assures the unity\n\nand smooth functioning of that community; he promotes a true spirit of love and\n\nfamily in the community; and he allows himself to be groomed into a real father.\n\nA father worthy of the name has the humility to apologise and to ask for\n\nforgiveness. A real father is always willing to forgive and be forgiven. A real father\n\nis at the service of his family. The Priest, too, is called to serve after the example\n\nof Jesus himself, who came not to be served but to serve and to give his life as a\n\nransom for many (cf. Matthew 20:28).\n\nFather John, 40 years down the line, you have worked really hard to minister to\n\nothers in season and out of season. Imagine the entire territory from Nkoine to\n\nBum, which you handled alone in the early 1980s as the young and vibrant Parish\n\nPriest of Saint Jude’s Parish Fundong. Imagine all other territories and institutions\n\nin which you have worked till date. Very often, some of us Priests think we are\n\ngreat when we are everywhere, every time, attending to everybody else. We are so\n\n7\n\nbusy working for God that we tend to forget the same God who has called us and\n\nassigned us to work for him. There is a story told of the donkey on which Jesus\n\nrode during his triumphant entry into Jerusalem. The story goes thus:\n\n“It was the morning after the great event, and the little donkey was still full of itself\n\nfor all the songs, praises, dance, jubilation, and people spreading palm branches\n\nand even their garments on the road for it to walk on. As the sun rose and the day\n\ngrew warmer, the donkey decided to take a walk into the village and meet the\n\npeople. It simply wanted to relive the glory of the previous day’s event.\n\nThe donkey met the first group of people at the village well. As the donkey strutted\n\ntowards them, the people simply ignored it and went on filling their pots and jars\n\nwith water. The donkey cleared its throat (M-mm-m!) to draw attention, but no one\n\npaid attention to it. It stamped its hoofs impatiently, but no one looked up. It\n\nthought to itself: ‘These fellows do not seem to know who they are dealing with\n\nhere’. It stamped its hoofs again, this time rather angrily, and broke a pot. One\n\nwell-built fellow gave it a sharp slap on the back and said, ‘Get out of here, you\n\ndirty beast!’\n\nThe donkey ran off, thinking to itself, ‘These people must be so ignorant. Let me\n\nget to the market square’. Even there, everyone was about their business and no\n\none paid the donkey the least attention. This made the donkey really mad and it\n\nshouted: ‘Hey fellows, where are the palm branches? Spread your garments on the\n\nroad! Don’t you see who is coming?’ Some children playing nearby stopped and\n\nstarted laughing at the donkey that was stomping around as if it had been stung by\n\nbees. They chased it with sticks and stones.\n\n8\n\nThe donkey went back to its mother, quite disappointed, and said: ‘Mummy, they\n\nchased me with sticks and stones, they completely ignored me. Yesterday was so\n\ndifferent.They adored me; they spread their clothes for me to walk on. What is\n\nwrong with these people?’ Its mother said: ‘There is nothing wrong with the\n\npeople, son; but there is everything wrong with you. Yesterday, they were not\n\nadoring you; they were not singing, dancing, and spreading their garments and\n\npalm branches for you. They did it for Jesus. Look, son, without Him, you are\n\nnothing; without Him you can do nothing.’”\n\nA Priest is like the donkey, in the story above, that must always carry Jesus in order\n\nto be effective. Without Jesus a Priest is nothing; without Jesus a Priest can do\n\nnothing. This is beautifully put in the Gospel according to John, when Jesus says:\n\n“Iam the vine; you are the branches. If you remain in me and I in you, you will\n\nbear much fruit; apart from me you can do nothing.” (John 15:5).\n\nOn the occasion of the ordination of four diocesan Priests in the Cathedral Basilica\n\nof the Immaculate Conception in Northern Colorado on 17\n\nMay 2014,\n\nth\n\nArchbishop Samuel Joseph Aquila of Denver said something, which I would like\n\nto borrow on the occasion of the Ruby Jubilee of Father John Bintum. He said:\n\nEvery Priest or Bishop knows the truth: that it is God who has chosen\n\nhim. For he knows his own weakness, he knows his own sinfulness, and\n\nyet, just as Jesus spoke to each of the Twelve the words, ‘Come, follow\n\nme,’ so too does he speak to every Priest or Bishop. And, in responding\n\nto that call, the Priest or Bishop must do so with a total gift of self. As\n\nJesus tells us, if you wish to be my disciple, you must leave everything:\n\nmother, father, brother, sister, home, etc. and follow me. Jesus must be\n\n9\n\nthe first and best friend of the Priest or Bishop. This is true for every\n\ndisciple of Jesus. The Priest makes himself a total self-gift to Christ and\n\nto his Church. Jesus himself has laid down his life for you and for every\n\nhuman being. He has made of himself a total self-gift and calls you to\n\nimitate that. Not only do you leave home and family to serve Christ and\n\nhis Church and to exercise pastoral charity as Christ himself did, you also\n\nembrace the gift of celibacy for the sake of the Kingdom. You imitate\n\nJesus Christ in doing that. You say, ‘he is the first priority,’ as is your\n\nministry. It is only with deep prayer that you can enter into that gift.\n\nHopefully, over the years of your formation, you have encountered Jesus,\n\nyou have received him as your friend and you have learned to love as he\n\nloves. Jesus reminds us that we are first loved by him, ‘as the Father loves\n\nme, so I also love you. Remain in my love’ (John 15:9). He then reminds\n\nus: ‘if you keep my commandments, you will remain in my love, just as I\n\nhave kept my Father’s commandments and remain in his love’ (John\n\n15:10).\n\n5\n\nToday, we celebrate Father John’s Ruby Jubilee in the context of the Easter Octave,\n\nthat is, the period of 8 days following Easter Sunday. The readings assigned to this\n\nFifth Day of the Octave focus directly on the Resurrection of Jesus. Had the\n\nResurrection of Jesus taken place in this our android age, social media would have\n\nbeen flooded with so many ‘happening now’ videos that many phones would\n\nsimply have run out of storage in a few hours. It happened in such a way that even\n\nscience could not record its details. However, we learn something of the empty\n\ntomb and the first appearances of the Risen Lord from the women, who out of\n\nCf. https://archden.org/archbishops_writing/homily-priesthood-ordination-mass-may-17-2014/#.XMCxevZFzIU\n\n5\n\n10\n\ntheir usual love and concern for Jesus go to the tomb early in the morning to anoint\n\nhis body. It is such a wonderful thing that the love of the women for Jesus leads\n\nthem to be the first witnesses of the Resurrection of Jesus. It comes across as a\n\nreward given to the women by Jesus for their love and concern for him. This is\n\nsomething that women can and should be proud of. They are bearers of the\n\nwonderful news of the Resurrection of Jesus.\n\nIt is thanks to the women that the chicken-hearted men, whom Jesus had chosen\n\nto be his Apostles, who had not only disowned Jesus but had also abandoned him\n\nto his fate on the cross, are able to come out of their hiding in an attempt to verify\n\nthe unbelievable story of the women. It is said that seeing is believing. When the\n\nmen see the scene of the empty tomb and encounter the Risen Lord, they believe\n\nin the Resurrection so much so that from chicken-hearted men they become bold\n\nand fearless preachers of the doctrine of the Resurrection.\n\nIn the first reading of today, the Apostles face the rulers and elders of the people\n\nwithout fear. Peter, filled with the Holy Spirit, takes up his role as first among\n\nequals and tells the rulers and elders of the people that they have failed in their\n\nmission. They had killed Jesus with the hope of silencing him and his followers.\n\nUnfortunately for them, God has raised him to life and miracles are being worked\n\nby his followers in his name, contrary to their expectation. Remember that in the\n\nGospel passage of Easter Monday, taken from the Gospel according to Matthew\n\n28:8-15, we are told of a meeting between the guards who were kept to watch the\n\ntomb of Jesus on the one hand and the chief priests and the elders of the people\n\non the other hand; a meeting whose conclusion is a resolution on the official\n\nversion of the story of the Resurrection of Jesus. After having given the guards a\n\ngood amount of money, they were instructed as follows:\n\n11\n\n“This is what you must say, ‘His disciples came during the night and stole\n\nhim away while we were asleep’. And should the governor come to hear\n\nof this, we undertake to put things right with him ourselves and to see\n\nthat you do not get into trouble’.” (Matthew 28:13-14)\n\nThe chief priests and the elders of the people are not the only ones to have this\n\nkind of agreement on an official version of a story that completely contradicts\n\nreality. We do that sometimes on a daily basis. By so doing, we choose to bear\n\nfalse witness instead of bearing witness to the truth as Jesus would want us to do.\n\nAt his trial, Jesus said he came into the world to bear witness to the truth. We, who\n\nhave opted to be like Christ, by becoming Christians, ought to bear witness to the\n\ntruth in the same way Christ did.\n\nFrom the first reading of today, we learn that the chief priests and the elders of the\n\npeople were extremely annoyed because Peter and John were teaching the people\n\nthe doctrine of the resurrection from the dead by proclaiming the resurrection of\n\nJesus. We can understand their frustration and anger. Things are working contrary\n\nto their made-up story. How could a dead man whose body has been stolen from\n\nthe tomb be causing so much confusion among the people? More so, his disciples,\n\nwho were so afraid that they ran away, abandoning him to the shameful death of\n\nthe cross, are now so bold to preach the doctrine of the resurrection and convert\n\nthousands of people! When Peter and John are called up to explain their conduct,\n\nPeter does not fear; neither does he hesitate. He tells them clean and clear:\n\n“… I am glad to tell you all, and would indeed be glad to tell the whole\n\npeople of Israel, that it was by the name of Jesus Christ the Nazarene, the\n\n12\n\none you crucified, whom God raised from the dead, by his name and by\n\nno other that this man is able to stand up perfectly healthy, here in your\n\npresence, today. This is the stone rejected by you builders, but which has\n\nproved to be the keystone. For of all the names in the world given to\n\nmen, this is the only one by which we can be saved.” (Acts 4:8-12)\n\nThe message of Peter to the rulers and elders of the people invites you and me to\n\ndraw closer to Jesus, because it is by his name and by no other name that we can\n\nbe saved. Union with Jesus necessarily implies union with our brothers and sisters.\n\nWe are gathered here as family and friends of Father John Bintum, who hails from\n\nNkor – Noni. The Noni have a saying: “Kintashi nu mngai”, meaning “Unity is\n\nstrength”. There is some essential balm that is made in the United Kingdom but\n\n“For export only!” I have always had the impression that the “Unity is strength”\n\nsaying of the Noni is also for export. This is because in every Noni Village, no\n\nmatter how small it may be, there are two Fons. Our unity would be strength if it\n\nceased to be a thing of the lips and became a conviction of the heart of each one\n\nof us. Then, our union with Christ would truly be union with our brothers and\n\nsisters.\n\nFather John, out of love for Jesus and his brothers and sisters, you have chosen to\n\nuse the proceeds from your Ruby Jubilee to cater for the internally displaced, who\n\nreside in this parish. This is your own concrete way of making sure that your union\n\nwith Christ translates into union with your brothers and sisters. May Jesus, the\n\nRisen Lord, touch the heart of each one of us in this church so that we may\n\ngenerously and joyfully support you in this great act of charity!\n\n13\n\nMay the Lord also keep us and strengthen us so that in the next ten years, we may\n\ncome back to celebrate your Golden Jubilee of Priestly Ordination. Ad multos\n\nannos!\n\nZephyrinus Yem Mbuh, SD,\n\nSENECA-CENC, Yaoundé."
