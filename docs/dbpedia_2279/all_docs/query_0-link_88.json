With the crisis raging on for four years now, a number of establishments in the division have shut down. The educationional sector keeps the area a little boosting but at the same time attracts empathy for reasons of teaching apathy. It is the third week of the second term, 2019/2020 academic year, yet GHS Wum with an enrollment of about 400 students has a teaching staff of less than 20. The statistics of school attendance in GBHS Wum taken on a day show students:-Boys:08 Girls:19 Total:27. Teachers:-Male:00 Female:-00 Admistrators:-02.

Girls in both rural area and and urban communities either have no chance to school or are subjected to chores that block access to education. A sadly large number of girls in most communities in the third world do not attain their desired dreams in life. They are deterred by the pressure to get married and the thought that females do not require much \"book\" among others. The misthought has rendered many girls both under utilised and under proficient setting females in a disadvantage position when offset with the male. Click below for details.
