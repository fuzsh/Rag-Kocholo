Kent, establishmmt: Foreword Although the first edition of The Europa Year Book appeared in 1926, this is the thirteenth annual edition as a two-volume world survey, and it is larger than ever. In Volume II new chapters have been added for Bahrain, Bangladesh, Qatar and the United Arab Emirates, while other chapters have changed their names. Cambodia has now become the Khmer Republic, while the Democratic Republic of the Congo (Kinshasa) has become Zaire and the United Arab Republic has reverted to the former name of Egypt. The work of compiling the information contained in The Europa Year Book would be impossible without the continued generous co-operation of many individuals and organizations throughout the world, especially statistical offices, departments of information and diplomatic missions. The editors would also like to thank the International Institute for Strategic Studies, 18 Adam Street, London, WC2N 6AL, for permission to use data on defence manpower and finance from The Military Balance 1971 - 1972 .

The tolerance shown by Buddhists allowed complete freedom of religion in Thai- land; Islam was introduced to the southern part of the county between the fourteenth and eighteenth centuries, Christianity came in the sixteenth century and the many Chinese immigrants brought their own religions of ancestor worship and Confucianism. These various religions, and to a certain extent their cultural traditions, have existed peaceably side by side and the tolerance shown to religions also shows itself towards foreign contacts. Trade contacts began in the middle of the thirteenth century and Europeans established trade contacts early in the sixteenth century. The Thai people have shown a remarkable ability to assimi- late other nationalities — especially Chinese, of which Thailand has a large, integrated section — and yet preserve their own nationality, in spite of varying external pressures. The written language has been influenced by, and in turn has influenced, Mon and Khmer. The influence of Buddhism on Thai life is also seen in the development of the literature of the country, a large proportion of early literary works being Buddhist-inspired. Verse was the general medium of literary expression until the last century, and one of the richest fields is the folk literature, which was passed on only by word of mouth. Thai theatre has many traditional faces. The most ancient forms are the Hun and the Nang; Hun is a type of elaborate marionette theatre, with tlie story sung or recited by a singer, with chorus and musical accompani- ment; Nang is a shadow drama, again with singer and chorus. Both of these have popular forms, with less elabor- ate figures and more modern stories. Classical drama originally came to Thailand from India. There are two main categories, tlie Khon and the Lakhon. The Khon was originally an epic religious manifestation, but it has been adapted to a certain extent; the characters, all men, wear masks and the story is told by a reciter, though a singing chorus is sometimes introduced. The Lakhon characters, men or women, but not acting together, do not wear masks, except when portraying demons, animals, etc.; the action is sung by a chorus, with a leader. Tradi- tional music is closely bound up with Thai drama, with stylized, unvarying “action\" and \"singing” tunes played by a traditional orchestra of at least five players. Popular festivals and ceremonies still held today have been a common manifestation of Tliai culture lor many centuries; the majority are of a religious nature, connected •with the various phases of the life of Buddha.

Recent History Formerly a United Nations Trust Territory administereij by France, Togo became an autonomous republic withitj the French Union in 1956 and achieved independence in jpfin- The leading political figure and first President of Togo, Sylvanus Olympio, was assassinated by military insurgent^ early in 1963 and Nicolas Grunitzky returned from exile tc, become President. In May 1963 a popular referendun\\ approved his appointment and elected a new National Assembly from a single list of candidates. Togo is s. member of the United Nations, the Organization for Afri-. can Unity, OCAM and the Consoil do I’Entente. An army coup d'dtat took place in January 1967. A now governmenf; under Colonel Dadjo was appointed after the voluntary withdrawal from ofiice of President Nicolas Grunitzky, In April 1967 Lt.-Gen. Etienne Eyadoma took over thij Presidency. In November 1969 a new party, the Togolesij People’s Rally, was founded with Gen. Eyadema a^ President. This party called for a referendum for th^ President of the Republic and this, held in January 1972, produced an overwhelming vote in favour of Gen, Eyadema. A Government reshuffle followed refiecting; Gen. Eyadema’s efforts to maintain stability. Government Following the army coup d’dtat of January 1967, th^ constitution was suspended. Executive power is in th^ hands of a President and a Cabinet, and elections to a new Parliament were promised as soon as possible. Th^ country is divided into four Regions each administered by an Inspector assisted by an elected council. Defence Togo’s Armed Forces total about 2,000, including an Infantry Battalion and a small naval force. Under military agreements TOth France, Togo is helped with training and equipment. Economic Affairs Togo’s considerable natural resources are still largely undeveloped. The economy is agricultural, the chief crop^ being manioc, palm kernels, coffee, groundnuts, cocoa and. cotton. Many of the forests and mineral reserves still have to be surveyed, but phosphates are being mined in increas- ing quantities and now form the country’s principal export. In 1967 major iron ore deposits were discovered in the North-Central region. It is intended to set up industries, mainly for food processing.
