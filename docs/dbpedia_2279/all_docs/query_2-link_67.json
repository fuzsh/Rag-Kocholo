The Christian enclaves came into being with absolute spontaneity as a modus vivendi. Oblivious of the danger in store both colonial governments and traditional authorities provided the conditions in which these Christian villages took root and ﬂourished. However what had taken root in the territory as a self-protection mechanism, soon unleashed its lethal, enticing tentacles luring both the wives of royals and commoners into their bosom. This disruptive inﬂuence of Christian villages threatened the survival of ethnic groups, arousing the rancour of traditional authorities and civil administrators. In many ways the Christian enclaves inhibited the potential of colonial governments to administer the territory. These states within a state propagated by the missionary in the most insidious and perﬁdious of all manners sowed within their own bosom the seed of self-destruction. The whole issue of runaway wives of royals and commoners alike who took refuge in the Christian villages troubled both the colonial and traditional authorities. By offering a safe haven to these runaway wives and welcoming women who were outside the traditional male authority in a tribal setup, the missionaries began sowing within the Christian communities the seeds of their own self destruction. Records of wives of Fons and commoners escaping into these enclaves, eloping with a man and returning pregnant remained the regular subject of several colonial intelligence reports. Highhanded methods by missionaries in these villages brought both the missionaries and their work into disrepute. In less than a quarter of a century these enclaves had lost the war of attrition waged by colonial and traditional authorities. Worn out by endless strife and dissension within and without and forced by contingency, what had been conceived to be ideal Christian communities with snowballing effects, saw its premature demise.\n\nPeter Awoh The Residue of the Western Missionary in the Southern Cameroons : The Christian Village: a Sad Tale of Strife and Dissension,\n\nThe Residue of the Western Missionary in Southern Cameroons The Christian Village A Sad Tale of Strife and Dissension\n\nCopyright © 2012.

The future and fate of the former German Pallotine and Sacred Heart missions became uncertain. During the period of uncertainty between their expulsion from Cameroon and their final repatriation to Germany, German missionaries expressed worries about the fate of their missions. Generally, the German missionaries had thought that the end of the first global conflict and signing of the peace agreements might lead to their return to their former stations in the colonies, but the peace arrangement in Versailles did not allow German nationals to resume their work in Cameroon. When it dawned on them that their return to their missions in Cameroon was out of the question, they explored other alternatives 1 The Versailles proclamation stated that German mission property should be taken over by trustees composed of persons holding the same faith as that of the owners of missions they were to take over. Proceeds from the sales of the German property in Cameroon formed the Liquidation Fund. The British government handed over these funds to the MILL HILL Missionaries when they took possession of the former German missions in Southern Cameroons. When it became clear that German missionaries would not be permitted to enter into the territory, the Sacred Congregation for the Propagation of the Faith (Propaganda Fidei) moved swiftly to appoint Joseph Shanahan as Ecclesiastical Apostolic Administrator of Adamawa. Joseph Shanahan was Prefect Apostolic of Southern Nigeria and the attachment of the missions in the Cameroons only added a burden to this already beleaguered administrator. By attaching the missions of the Southern Cameroons to the 1For\n\nexample, in a letter from the British Vice Consul in Fernando Po to the British\n\nResident Commissioner in Cameroon, the German Fathers expressed their wish that Belgian, Dutch and French Fathers of the same missionary order, who might be allowed to carry on the mission work in Bamenda, could be introduced to their work by the German Fathers who had been in charge of the missions before the war.

The British government administered Southern Cameroons as part of the Southern Province of Nigeria with headquarters in Enugu. For many years, the Church in Cameroon remained intimately linked to the eastern part of Nigeria in different ways. Rome erected Southern Cameroons as the Apostolic Prefecture in 1923, Apostolic Vicarate in 1939 and Diocese of Buea in 1950, under the Metropolitan See of Onitsha. The arrangement in which the former German missions in British Southern Cameroons 2 came under the auspices of the Prefect Apostolic of Southern Nigeria was to be short-lived because in the interim period between Shanahan’s 1000 miles trek and the coming of the MILL HILL missionaries, Monsignor Plissonneau 3 assumed his functions as the Prefect Apostolic of Adamawa. Njinikom and Shisong naturally came under the spheres of influence of the Prefect Apostolic of Adamawa. The priests in French Cameroon in parishes close to the British Cameroons extended their missions to include neighbouring missions in British Cameroon. The years following the end of the First World War in Cameroon were turbulent, with conflict between the missions and traditional authorities. Trouble began with the return of former native German soldiers, who formed the nucleus of the first Christian communities. Colonial authorities at 2\n\nThe Anglo-French accord to divide Cameron was reached on March 4, 1916 and\n\nimplemented on March 6, 1916. The general administration of the colony and protectorate of Nigeria and mandated territory of Cameroon was headed by the Governor General, who was resident in Lagos, the capital of the Federation. The Governor General was directly responsible to the Secretary of State for the Colonies in London. Under the Governor General were two Lieutenant Governors at the head of the administration of the Southern Copyright © 2012. Langaa RPCIG. All rights reserved.\n\nand Northern groups of provinces. Under the Lieutenant Governor were senior Provincial Residents, each at the head of the provincial administration. British Southern Cameroons constituted the Cameroon province during the Mandate period. During the period of the Mandate, they were seven Residents in Cameroon. These were Major F.H. Ruxton (192125), E.J. Arnett (1925-28), H.G. Aveling (1928-29), E. J. Arnett (1929-32), Rutherford (193334), O.W. Firth (1935-38) and A.E.F. Murry (1939-42). 3Plissonneau\n\nhad previously worked in Congo and was a member of the Sacred Heart\n\nMissionaries. He had been contacted by a Christian in Kumbo, Paul Tangwa and invited to come over to Kumbo.\n\nviii\n\nThe Residue of the Western Missionary in the Southern Cameroons : The Christian Village: a Sad Tale of Strife and Dissension,\n\nCopyright © 2012.

However, the coming of Monsignor Plissonneau did not bring the solution which colonial and traditional authorities had desperately hoped. Both the chiefs and colonial officers began gradually to modify their thoughts. The newly modified current of thought was a consequence of the events of the time. The idea was that peace would naturally return if missionaries of other nationalities like Monsignor Plissonneau were replaced with British missionaries. For this reason, the MILL HILL Missionaries were drafted into the territory to replace the French Sacred Heart Missionaries, especially in the Grass Fields where the troublesome spots of Njinikom and Kumbo were situated. Like their predecessors, their arrival did not bring the expected results. Their actions in many localities and especially in the Grass Fields, only added salt to injury. What the colonial authorities might or might not have foreseen and could not control, was that the ranks of the MILL HILL Missionaries, which had their origin in London, were swelled by candidates from a broad range of nationalities. Esu, Shisong and Njinikom in the Bamenda Division in the 1920s and Baseng in Kumba Division in the 1930s and 1940s were hotspots of conflict between the Church and the traditional rulers and between the Church and colonial authorities, although almost every residue of the turbulent past seems to have been expunged today. These specific areas which had been arbitrarily selected and assigned, or in some cases accidentally became, the terrain on which the missionaries hoped to build ideal miniature Christian communities that would have a snowballing effect on the surrounding environment. In the immediate post war years, before the arrival of the MILL HILL Mission in the 1920s, these areas had become hotspots far beyond the control of colonial and traditional authorities. Christians, mainly ex-German soldiers, had established Christian communities against the wishes of both colonial and traditional authorities. The German missionaries adopted the formal education as a medium through which they might gain a foothold in a locality. Traditional rulers generally welcomed the school project, oblivious to the danger that lay in its bosom. For them, it was a way to gain access to the wizardry of the Whiteman, to tap into the hidden treasures it might offer. For some reason, these school projects in the Grass Fields were located very close to the Fon’s palace. Inserting a school in a locality was a novelty that generally caused no ix\n\nThe Residue of the Western Missionary in the Southern Cameroons : The Christian Village: a Sad Tale of Strife and Dissension,\n\nCopyright © 2012. Langaa RPCIG. All rights reserved.\n\ndisruption to the traditional life and raised no eyebrows from the custodians of the tribe, the chiefs. Surprisingly, as was the case in Nso, the traditional executive arm of the Fon took great pains to round up children to attend the schools. The missionaries reciprocated the goodwill of the chiefs, electing to depend on persuasion and avoid head-on confrontation. Before the outbreak of the First World War, confrontations were minimal or non-existent. According to the Divisional Officer of Bamenda Division “There was no major dispute between Christians and animists during the German period. But it was not until ex-German soldiers attempted to conduct a mission of their own that serious trouble began.” 4 When the First World War broke out in 1914, the missionaries left their respective missions. This sudden exit without prior proper preparation of a local leadership created a dangerous precedence. This leadership vacuum was quickly occupied by ill prepared, self-assuming indigenes. It was precisely during this period that the subtle animosity, which had been simmering, came into the open. Early converts, mainly schoolchildren, carried around them an air of superiority. They were the only ones in the locality who wore clothes and this closeness to the Whiteman and attachment to his ways naturally provoked some degree of jealousy. After the expulsion of the Whiteman, traditionalists forced many of these converts to relinquish the ways of the Whiteman and to return to the traditional way of life. With whatever cover and protection the Whiteman had provided gone, traditional rulers, who might have grudgingly allowed the Whiteman to turn the children away from the ways of their ancestors, lost no time in ordering a complete repudiation of his alien ways, including his religious ideas. In fact, it was not western merchandise that disenchanted the African traditional rulers most; rather, it was the western religious philosophy, which directly contradicted African religions and philosophy. The repulsive manner with which they reviled the religious ideas of the Whiteman had nothing in common with the manner in which they welcomed his gin and guns. The persecution of the early converts took the form of scourging, imprisonment and ostracisation of those who had severed themselves from the roots and ways of their ancestors. Unknown to the traditional rulers, who were doing all that was humanly possible to obliterate even the smouldering 4\n\nBNA-Sd 1921/1Confidential Memorandum from the District Officer, Bamenda, to\n\nthe Resident, Cameroon Province, Buea, January 20, 1920.\n\nx\n\nThe Residue of the Western Missionary in the Southern Cameroons : The Christian Village: a Sad Tale of Strife and Dissension,\n\nCopyright © 2012.

The soldiers who had been incarcerated at Fernando Po returned to their homeland no longer as German soldiers but as soldiers of the newfound religion of the Whiteman ready to face whatever resistance was in store for them. Their return generally aroused suspicion and fear in the minds and hearts of colonial and traditional authorities alike. Confidential colonial reports depicted these fears vividly. The soldiersturned-Christians were armed with a very sinister weapon and the traditional rulers were to try in vain to convince them to abandon it and return to the ways of the tribe. In the 1920s, the French Sacred Heart Fathers and, later, the MILL HILL missionaries found pulsating Christian communities under persecution and came to their aid. Before the MILL HILL missionaries arrived in Cameroon, it was commonplace to see missionaries in native courts, with an array of fervent followers, defending African adherents to Christianity. For example, the description of court proceedings regarding the catechist, Tangwa in Nso, suggests that the proceedings caused a good deal of uproar. In the Tangwa case, fighting between Christians and non-Christians ensued when about 50 Christians, led by Monsignor Plissonneau, accompanied Tangwa to his hearing. About 250 non-Christians were present. The Fon's authority was questioned openly at the hearing.5 Events like these gradually inflamed the traditional rulers, who became virulently anti-Christian. An enclave strong enough to protect the Christians became necessary in the face of this animosity between the traditional rulers and the Christians, The emergence of Christian villages all over the area became commonplace. Christians wishing to live out their faith, or for some ulterior motive, began gravitating gradually towards these enclaves. In the end, they became states within states, with their inhabitants living outside colonial and traditional rule. This book describes the Christian village concept – an illusory pipe dream – and the factors that shaped its dynamics as applied by the British missions in Southern Cameroons. The concept of the Christian village was not new. The Jesuits in Latin America, specifically in Paraguay, had successfully used it for centuries. However, the attempt to found them in 5\n\nBNA-Sd 1921/1, In the Provincial Court Case of the Cameroons Province before\n\nN.C.

From the start, it was apparent that the friction between these enclaves and the colonial and traditional authorities made the success of the entire enterprise precarious. The MILL HILL missionaries in Southern Cameroons remained at the centre of the Christian villages, becoming the main actors in the controversy between the colonial authorities and traditional rulers. Why and how did these missionaries get so embroiled in the endless squabbles that threatened their very existence in Cameroon? In the 1930s, Church-State relations had reached such a desperate state that an official reprimand was needed to restore order. The missionaries were required to either profess their support for and belief in the British system of indirect rule in Cameroon or leave the territory. There were many reasons for the attitude of the missionaries towards the colonial authorities. Many of the missionaries were of Irish and Dutch origin and the historical intricacies between England and Ireland certainly had a hand in their show of insolence in the face of British rule in Southern Cameroons. Neither the converts nor the missionaries fully appreciated what it meant to convert from the religion of one’s ancestors to Christianity. Christianity was a destabilizing force, especially when it came to runaway wives and infant marriages. Philosophically, conversion had deep repercussions for the tribe, which saw its foundations shattered by the alien religion. The whole issue of runaway wives – of royals and commoners alike – taking refuge in the Christian villages troubled both the colonial and traditional authorities. By offering a safe haven to these runaway wives and welcoming women who were outside the traditional male authority in a tribe, the missionaries began sowing within the Christian communities the seeds of their own self-destruction. Records of the wives of Fons escaping into these enclaves, eloping with other men and returning pregnant remained a common subject of several colonial intelligence reports. For example, the demise of Christian village in Njinikom was largely due to the battle between the traditional rulers and the Church over the control of women. The application of the whole concept of Christian villages without due regard for prevailing norms - ecclesiastical, colonial and traditional - lay at the root of the destruction of the Christian villages, which the missionaries had laboured tirelessly to build and maintain. The management of the Christian enclaves by the missionaries cast dark clouds on Christianity and brought xii\n\nThe Residue of the Western Missionary in the Southern Cameroons : The Christian Village: a Sad Tale of Strife and Dissension,\n\nCopyright © 2012.

The most noble of motives guided the missionaries in their arduous and gruelling effort to get the better of traditional rulers and natives, to rout the devil, perceived at the time to be the driving force behind traditional sacrifices and rituals. Good intentions in themselves are not enough and good intentions are not necessarily consistent with practice. They were men of their time, using the tools of their time. They spoke and understood the language of the time to men and women of their time. In some instances, colonial authorities had no option but to expel particular missionaries from the Mandated Territory of Southern Cameroons because they had become a menace to public peace and order. Although they were men of their time, the conduct of these missionaries in many ways did not follow the prevailing norms set out in the missionary encyclicals of the time. Maximum Illud published in 1919 by Pope Benedict XV, a few years before the first band of MILL HILL missionaries landed on the shores of Victoria, proscribed unbecoming missionary conduct and prescribed what was expected of a missionary. It is for succeeding generations of missionaries to see what lessons can be imbibed from the lives and missions of these forbearers of the Good News of Jesus Christ.\n\nxiii\n\nThe Residue of the Western Missionary in the Southern Cameroons : The Christian Village: a Sad Tale of Strife and Dissension,\n\nCopyright © 2012.

However, due to a lack of consistent reinforcement over time, these sporadic attempts left behind negligible results that were soon obliterated. The third phase of Africa’s systematic evangelisation began in the nineteenth century, a period marked by the extraordinary efforts organized by the great apostles and promoters of the African mission. It was a period of rapid growth, unparalleled by any other missionary endeavours undertaken by the Church in earlier centuries in Africa. 1 The nineteenth century witnessed unprecedented changes on a global scale. There was hardly a place on the earth’s surface that was unaffected by this sudden global surge in exploration. Between 1870 and 1900 and especially after 1885, a sudden and striking change occurred in the relations between Europe and the rest of the world. In these years, Europe made its last and most spectacular attempt to dominate the world. No one possible explanation can account for the sudden desire for colonies. European countries became industrialised and needed to find new markets for their products. Colonies provided not only new markets but also raw materials. Imperialism – the quest for colonies – began as a search for new markets and increased wealth. As Europe became a world power with a network of political and economic interest around the globe, rivalries among European states intensified, transforming most of them into armed camps. Combined with growing feelings of nationalism, imperialistic and militaristic impulses, which created an atmosphere that eventually led to strife and dissension. Before 1875, the common wisdom was that colonies brought both benefits and problems to a modern state, but, after that year, western thinking abruptly changed. Europe’s industrialised states began to compete for colonies and for trade rights around the world. To maintain their high 1\n\nJohn Paul II Post-Synodal Apostolic Exhortation Ecclesia in Africa on the Church in\n\nAfrica and its Evangelizing No.30.\n\n1\n\nThe Residue of the Western Missionary in the Southern Cameroons : The Christian Village: a Sad Tale of Strife and Dissension,\n\nCopyright © 2012. Langaa RPCIG. All rights reserved.\n\nstandards of living, they had to find new markets in underdeveloped areas, where they could invest capital and find cheap sources of raw materials. Given these needs, the continent of Africa became the final destination of the imperialistic ambition of western nations. As late as 1850, people still spoke of Africa as the Dark Continent; by 1914, European nations had divided the entire continent, except for Abyssinia and Liberia. In the middle of the nineteenth century, the bravery of explorers like the Scottish missionary, Dr. Livingstone, opened up the centre of Africa to western influence and control. Very quickly, the main European powers began to seize portions of these lands as colonies and claim surrounding territories as their spheres of influence. Western technological superiority made it possible for Europe to explore, discover and conquer militarily, politically and culturally the indigenous civilizations in Africa, Asia and Latin America. From the destruction of the Aztec empires in Latin America to the Zulu Empire in South Africa, no land was remote enough to escape the notice of Britain, France, Portugal, Spain, Belgium and Germany. These western European nations exported their languages, customs, religions and philosophies to parts of Africa, Asia and Latin America. Even cultures that seemed resilient appeared very vulnerable in the face of whatever was western. From the 15th to 19th centuries, European technological advancement made it possible for Europe to master the known lands of the earth. In the 15th century, the Portuguese invented the caravel to explore along the West African coast and into the Atlantic Ocean. In the early 1930s, John Laird designed two paddle steamers. In 1884, Hiram Maxim demonstrated a perfectly reliable machine gun in which the initial pulling of the trigger made the gun fire completely automatically until the trigger was released. In the 19th century, some European nations adopted the compass. These three inventions, instruments of travel, conquest and direction, gave Europe technological leverage over the rest of the world. Countries that had had long and well-established political, social and religious traditions, such as China, India and Japan, had to contend with the westernizing mission of Europe. Owing to their numerical strength and ability to ward off complete colonial subjugation, these peoples were largely able to maintain their cherished cultural practices. However it is true that no culture in the world has completely escaped the intruding influence of western culture, religion, language and philosophy. 2\n\nThe Residue of the Western Missionary in the Southern Cameroons : The Christian Village: a Sad Tale of Strife and Dissension,\n\nCopyright © 2012. Langaa RPCIG. All rights reserved.\n\nBy 1850, many European countries had acquired the status of colonial masters. Britain and France were in the forefront. Countries as well as individuals had carved out spheres of influence in Africa. Germany under Bismarck, however, refused to become entangled in this craze for colonies. Not only did Bismarck believe that Germany’s interest lay in Europe, he was also anxious not to provoke Britain unnecessarily. To gain colonies would mean building a German navy strong enough to defend its waters, fend off aggressors and bully potential competitors. The creation of a German naval force would have attracted the wrath of Britain and Bismarck was unwilling to upset the delicate balance of power. For this reason, Germany stood aloof, maintaining a safe distance from the squabbles among European powers in their quest for colonies. However, unable to resist the pressure brought to bear by events, the chancellor was forced to relent. Pressure on him came from the German African Society, formed in 1878 and the German colonial league, formed four years later in 1882. Both organizations encouraged Bismarck to make claims in Africa as other nations had done. Unfortunately for Bismarck, his reign saw the expansion of German industry, a 43 per cent increase in the population of Germany, the building of the railway, which encouraged ruralurban migration and more and more Germans crossing the Atlantic to open up trade with the Middle East and the Far East. Bismarck was not keen on entering the colonial race largely because he did not want to challenge Britain by sea. With more and more prospects for prosperity, many Germans seemed to see no limit to what their nation could achieve. Bismarck had no option other than to overhaul his ideas. Thus, economic expansion put Germany forward as a participant in the race for colonies overseas. Anxious at all cost not to upset the system of European alliances by offending other nations, Bismarck decided to call conferences in Berlin in November 1884 to discuss all the problems that the scramble for Africa was causing. Cameroon gradually came into focus as a German sphere of influence owing to the fact that German industrialists, hungry for profit, had already invested capital there. For example, Carl Woermann of Hamburg established the first German trading firm on the coast of Cameroon in 1868 and Johann Thornahlen and J. Jantzen established the second in 1875.\n\n3\n\nThe Residue of the Western Missionary in the Southern Cameroons : The Christian Village: a Sad Tale of Strife and Dissension,\n\nCopyright © 2012. Langaa RPCIG. All rights reserved.\n\nThe Intricacies of Early Missionary Manoeuvres in Cameroon In Cameroon, the history of evangelisation went hand in hand with the history of colonization. In fact, missionaries and colonialists were strange bedfellows from the beginning. The evangelisation of Cameroon started in 1840 when the first group of Baptist missionaries landed in Cameroon, all the way from Jamaica. In the beginning of evangelisation, Cameroon was not a colony of any European power. In fact, non-European missionary presence in the country was initiated and kept alive by trading companies such as the German Woerman and the British Ambas Bay trading companies. Because of the various European companies in the territory and the absence of any official and internationally recognized control of the entire territory, missionaries were able to take advantage of these loopholes and the openmindedness of the chiefs, to undertake the work of evangelisation. However, as time went on, the free leeway in Cameroon of missionaries from many nations was completely curtailed. Beginning with the German annexation, the history of evangelisation was marked with controversy. Because of nationalistic tendencies, linguistic and denominational squabbles and schisms, the Christian missionary enterprise in Cameroon created obstacles for itself. The Protestant missionaries preceded the Catholic missionaries by almost half a century. In the few years before the annexation of Cameroon by Germany, many British missionaries competed with the French to lure their countries to annex Cameroon. They wrote letters in the name of the local traditional authorities requesting annexation. While Britain and France showed interest in colonising Cameroon, it was however half-hearted and minimal. The year 1884 saw a flurry of decisive activities by the German government. In February 1884, Dr Gustav Nachtigal was appointed by the German Government to head a mission to Cameroon and Fernando Po. The purpose of the mission was to study German trade and the prospects of a consular service and coaling station in the area. In Lisbon, on his way to Cameroon, he was given new and definite instructions to annex Cameroon. On Monday July 14, 1884, Johannes Voss officially handed the treaties he had negotiated with the chiefs to Nachtigal, who proclaimed the annexation and hoisted the German flag in Cameroon. The British Consul, Edward H. Hewett, acting on\n\n4\n\nThe Residue of the Western Missionary in the Southern Cameroons : The Christian Village: a Sad Tale of Strife and Dissension,\n\ninstructions from the colonial office in London, arrived in Cameroon on July 19, 1884 – four days after the treaties with Germany had been concluded. 2 The attitude of the German Government towards the activities of the Catholic Missionary Order in Cameroon and in the colonies in general was influenced by the German foreign policy under Otto Von Bismarck. Bismarck, the German chancellor, was responsible for the course of missionary action in Cameroon. He had a phobia and a general dislike for Jesuits and all that was Jesuit. 3 This was the reason why the request made by the Holy Ghost Fathers to set up a missionary post in Cameroon was denied. For him, all Catholic missionaries were more or less Jesuit in character and spirit. However, with the passage of time, the German government had to relax the conditions under which they would accept missionaries into their colonies. They stipulated that missionaries had to be of German nationality, their superiors had to be German and reside in Germany or a German controlled territory and their superiors had to refuse all directives and interference from outside. Bismarck was unable to find a religious order that would satisfy all the criteria to the letter. Since 1622, Catholic missionary activity has been under the direction of the Sacred Congregation for the Propagation of the Faith (Propaganda Fidei) in Rome. 4 The Missionary Order that finally won the bid to evangelize this German colony was not founded by a German and, therefore, in its internal hierarchical structure and by virtue of the international missionary perspective, owed some allegiance to those who had been mandated to direct the missionary activity throughout\n\n2V.G.\n\nFanso (1989) Cameroon History for Secondary Schools and Colleges Volume 2,\n\nThe Colonial and Post-Colonial Periods, MacMillan Cameroon.

As part of their service to the Roman Church, the Jesuits encouraged people to continue their obedience to scripture as interpreted by Catholic doctrine. 4Founded\n\nin 1622 by Pope Gregory XV‘s bull Inscrutabili Divinae, the body was\n\ncharged with fostering the spread of Catholicism and with the regulation of Catholic ecclesiastical affairs in non-Catholic countries.\n\n5\n\nThe Residue of the Western Missionary in the Southern Cameroons : The Christian Village: a Sad Tale of Strife and Dissension,\n\nthe entire known world. The Pallotines were the first Catholic Missionary Order to undertake the work of evangelisation in Cameroon. 5 When the German Empire became the colonial power of Cameroon (then Kamerun) in 1884, French Catholic groups were denied permission to set up a mission in the territory. 6 The Germans were not eager to allow Catholics in at all, let alone foreign ones. They relented two years later when the German and Swiss-run Pallotines requested entry. It is important to examine the situation that preceded their coming. A great deal of controversy preceded the coming of the Pallotine missionaries to Cameroon. The first Catholic Missionary Orders that requested to work in Cameroon shortly after the German annexation were the French Congregation of the Holy Ghost and the Holy Heart of Mary Immaculate. The German government refused to grant this Missionary Order permission to establish missions in the territory for two related reasons: first, they were French and might work\n\n5\n\nSaint Vincent Pallotti, an Italian ecclesiastic who was born in Rome on April 21, 1795,\n\nfounded the Pallotine missionary order. He was the founder of the Pious Society of Missions. His early studies were made at the Pious Schools of San Pantaleone and he passed to the Roman College from there. At the age of sixteen, he resolved to become a priest and was eventually ordained on May 16, 1820. Vincenzo Pallotti worked selflessly looking after the poor in the urban areas of the city for most of his life. He had an intense devotion to the mystery of the Most Blessed Trinity and to the Virgin Mary. He longed to send missionaries to other parts of the world and, consequently, founded the Union of Catholic Apostolate, the Society of the Catholic Apostolate that became the Pious Society of Missions. He strongly believed in the spirit of St. Paul. Like all good Catholics of the time, he was influenced by the theology of mission Copyright © 2012. Langaa RPCIG.

He believed salvation could only be found in the Catholic Church and it was his intention to start a Catholic Apostolic Society. Although his visionary desire to unite the factions in the Church and encourage lay apostolic activity did not bear fruit within his lifetime, he did his utmost to encourage this vision in others. 6\n\nThe name “Kamerun” is spelled differently depending on the colonial period in\n\nquestion. Under the German colonial period, it is spelled “Kamerun”.

In 1889, the Pallotine missionaries requested to come to Cameroon. After a very careful investigation and thorough study of the Order’s constitution, the government reluctantly granted permission. This came after Bismarck had visited East Africa and learned of the good work that Catholic missionaries were doing there. In granting permission, the government set several conditions under which they were to operate in the colony. These conditions were as follows: that the Basel mission not object to their coming, that only German missionaries of the Order be sent to the colony, that the Order must keep out of the mission territory of the Basel mission, that there be no foreign control or interference in the Order’s work in the colony and that the Order must use the German language in the colony. The Pallotines accepted these conditions and were ready to establish a Pallotine mission house and a training school in Limburg, Germany. In 1890, the Basel mission removed their objections to Catholic missionaries coming to Cameroon, so long as they agreed to work only in regions not under their control. Permission came with the following conditions: the Pallotines were not to compete directly with the already established Protestant Basel Mission, they were to accept no orders from any non-German authority, they were to employ only German or African staff and they were to use and teach only the German language. It is for this reason that the German Catholic missionaries did not follow the German colonial authorities immediately to Cameroon. Reluctantly and grudgingly, it took the German government close to six years to lift the ban on Catholic missionaries in Cameroon. Historically, this has not always been the scenario. Throughout history, Catholic missionaries followed their compatriots to the colonies. However, unlike most colonising European countries in the past, Germany had ceased to be predominantly Catholic. Not only was Germany not predominantly Catholic, it had institutionally evolved a subtle and sometimes open anti-Catholic feeling. As was the case with Asia and Latin America in the sixteenth century, the evangelisation of Africa on a large scale was only possible in the era of the colonization of Africa. It was under these circumstances that German missionaries arrived in Cameroon. The German colonial enterprise in Cameroon served as a vehicle for the evangelisation of the territory. The introduction of the German Pallotine Fathers and later the Sacred Heart 7\n\nThe Residue of the Western Missionary in the Southern Cameroons : The Christian Village: a Sad Tale of Strife and Dissension,\n\nCopyright © 2012. Langaa RPCIG. All rights reserved.\n\nFathers in Cameroon was a direct consequence of German rule in Cameroon. It was in 1884 that the German formal annexation of Cameroon finally became a reality. However, behind the scene, missionaries, in defiance to the national spheres of influence, were eager to cast their nets into the deep. Applications from various Catholic missionary organizations to evangelize in Cameroon were systematically turned down until 1890 when the German government was forced to relent following the demise of Bismarck. In 1883, a year before the German annexation of Cameroon, two French missionaries of the Holy Ghost Fathers working in Gabon visited Cameroon with the aim of buying land to set up mission stations. Shortly after the annexation of Cameroon in 1885, Nachtigal invited the French Holy Ghost Fathers to come to Cameroon. However, in 1885, with the arrival of Governor Von Soden, the romance ended abruptly and on a sad note. These attempts by the French Holy Ghost Fathers to settle in Cameroon were futile. In November of the same year, Bismarck categorically objected to the admission of the French missionaries in Cameroon in a speech at the Reichstag. The German foreign policy towards Catholic missions in Cameroon was a direct result of the turbulent relations with the Church in Germany. To understand why Bismarck felt threatened by the Catholic Church, it is necessary to examine briefly this period of German history. Between 1840 and 1870, Italy became a united nation. This meant that the Pope, who for centuries had ruled the Papal States in central Italy, now found himself the ruler of a tiny area around his Vatican palace in Rome. Pius IX was determined to show that this loss of territory made no difference to his position as head of the Catholic Church. Accordingly, in July 1870, he issued a series of Vatican Decrees, the most famous of which was the doctrine of papal infallibility. The First Vatican Council headed by and heavily influenced by the Pope, promulgated two decrees, Dei Filius and Pastor Aeternus, the latter of which decreed papal Infallibility. It is because of this second decree that this Council is so well known. In simple terms, papal infallibility meant that, when the Pope spoke on behalf of the Church, his word could not be questioned; and all good Catholics must accept his views and his decisions. In addition, the Vatican Decrees stated that it was the duty of the state to enforce all decisions of the papacy. Bismarck at once saw that the claims of Pope Pius IX could be a direct challenge to the one powerful state over which he ruled. Following the declaration of Papal 8\n\nThe Residue of the Western Missionary in the Southern Cameroons : The Christian Village: a Sad Tale of Strife and Dissension,\n\nCopyright © 2012. Langaa RPCIG. All rights reserved.\n\ninfallibility, the German government became very unsure about the German Catholics whose allegiance to the papacy was too strong. If the pope and Bismarck disagreed, which one would a German Catholic obey? It should be noted that one third of the German population was Catholic.\n\nOtto von Bismarck (1815-1898) Trouble began when German Bishops demanded the dismissal of all teachers who did not support the Pope’s decrees. Soon afterwards, the Archbishop of Cologne insisted on the removal of four professors at the University of Bonn. Bismarck decided to resist. Behind him were national liberals and free thinkers as well as members of the Reichstag who were keen Protestants. He was also encouraged by the fact that many Roman Catholic 9\n\nThe Residue of the Western Missionary in the Southern Cameroons : The Christian Village: a Sad Tale of Strife and Dissension,\n\nintellectuals at the university opposed the Pope. He decided to put the Prussian Minister of Education, Paul Ludwig Adalbert Falk in charge of the struggle, knowing that Falk could be held responsible if things went wrong 7. In 1873, Falk issued the May Laws and other laws followed in the next two years. Following the implementation of the May Laws, the Jesuits, the great teaching order of priests, were expelled from Germany. No priest was allowed to inspect a school or a Church. Colleges had to have their examinations set by the state. The registration of births, marriages and deaths were taken out of the hands of the Church and given to state officers. Bismarck went further to exasperate the papacy by making civil marriages legal, thus reducing to a certain extent the control of the church over family matters. Cardinals and Archbishops, applauded by the congregations, defied the law and went to prison. By 1870, some 1,300 parishes had no priests.\n\n7\n\nIn 1872 he was made minister of education and in connection with Otto von\n\nBismarck‘s policy of the Kulturkampf he was responsible for the May Laws or Falk Laws against the Catholics. In 1879 his position became untenable, owing to the death of Pope Pius IX and the change of German policy with regard to the Vatican and he resigned his office, but retained his seat in the Reichstag until 1882. Pope Pius IX (13 May 1792 – 7 Copyright © 2012. Langaa RPCIG. All rights reserved.\n\nFebruary 1878), born Giovanni Maria Mastai-Ferretti, was the longest-reigning elected Pope in the history of the Catholic Church, serving from 16 June 1846 until his death, a period of nearly 32 years. During his pontificate, he convened the First Vatican Council in 1869, which decreed papal infallibility. The Pope defined the dogma of the Immaculate Conception of the Blessed Virgin Mary, meaning that Mary was conceived without original sin. Pius IX also granted the Marian title of Our Mother of Perpetual Help, a famous Byzantine icon from Crete entrusted to the Redemptorist priests. In addition to this, Pius IX was also the last Pope to rule as the Sovereign of the Papal States, which fell completely to Italian nationalist armies by 1870 and were incorporated into the Kingdom of Italy. He was beatified in 2000.\n\n10\n\nThe Residue of the Western Missionary in the Southern Cameroons : The Christian Village: a Sad Tale of Strife and Dissension,\n\nPope Pius IX\n\nCopyright © 2012. Langaa RPCIG. All rights reserved.\n\nBismarck had gravely miscalculated, however, when he believed that the German Catholics would submit easily. Bismarck was alarmed by the growth of the Catholic Centre Party in the Reichstag whose votes he needed to support his foreign policy. His chance to reverse the situation and make peace with the Church came in February 1878 when Pope Pius IX died and was succeeded by Pope Leo XIII, a far easier man to deal with. A year later, in March 1879, Bismarck held a secret interview with Windthorst at which they came to terms. In return for calling off the Kulturkampf, 8 the centre 8Kulturkampf\n\nwas actually the German struggle for civilisation. At a time when\n\nEuropean nations were shaping their destiny in a pragmatic and decisive manner, prime movers had to decide which direction the German civilisation would take. Many nations in Europe in their forward march to human and material development saw the Catholic Church as an obstacle. The rise in secularism, the removal of the Church from secular life and national independence of these new nation states in Europe were the new ideals in the 19th century. Countries that had thrown Catholicism off their backs were the first to become materially advanced.\n\n11\n\nThe Residue of the Western Missionary in the Southern Cameroons : The Christian Village: a Sad Tale of Strife and Dissension,\n\nparty would support Bismarck’s policy in other matters. The hated Falk was dismissed and made to appear as a scapegoat for Bismarck’s failure. Gradually the May Laws were withdrawn and Bismarck made peace with the new Pope. All Religious Orders of the Catholic Church were allowed to function in Germany and the Catholic Church was allowed complete control of the education of its own priesthood. On the other hand, it did not regain its right to inspect state schools.\n\nCopyright © 2012. Langaa RPCIG. All rights reserved.\n\nEvangelisation and Early History of Cameroon In May 1889, following the normalisation of relations between the Papacy and Germany, the Sacred Congregation for the Propagation of Faith in Rome placed a memorandum before the German government. It indicated the availability of the German Pallotine Fathers to take over the evangelisation of Cameroon, the creation of a new vicariate of Cameroon and the consent of the Bishop of Munster to set up a mission centre in his Diocese for the Pallotine Fathers. On March 18, 1890, Rome created the apostolic prefecture of Cameroon and confided it to the Pallotine Fathers. In July of the same year, Henri Vieter was nominated as First Prefect of Cameroon. In October, he and seven companions arrived in Cameroon. On October 8, 1890, the German Pallotine Fathers set up their first mission station at Marienburg, consecrating Cameroon to Mary, Queen of the Apostles. 9 At the invitation of the Pallotine missionaries, on November 28, 1912, missionaries of the Sacred Heart of Jesus arrived in the colony to cooperate with them in carrying the Catholic faith into the interior and Grasslands of Cameroon. The Order of the Missionaries of the Sacred Heart of Jesus was founded by Father Leon Dehon. He was born on March 14, 1843, in La Capelle, France. His father, Alexandre Jules Dehon, was a forthright and virtuous man, although he had become a nominal Christian, having ceased to practice his religion. The dream to see his son scale the heights of success made him to do all in his power to educate his son. An untiring worker, who avoided all forms of prodigality, toeing the path of frugality, he spared no expenses to pay for his son’s education. Like the pious men of all times, 9\n\nNdi Anthony Mbunwe (1983), MILL HILL Missionaries and the State in Southern\n\nCameroons, 1922-1962, London.\n\n12\n\nThe Residue of the Western Missionary in the Southern Cameroons : The Christian Village: a Sad Tale of Strife and Dissension,\n\nLeon’s spiritual awakening was because of his mother’s piety. She was a woman of great piety, dedicated to all kinds of good works, with a deep compassion for the poor and unfortunate. His mother prepared the young Leon for his first Holy Communion, which he received on June 4, 1854. His devotion to the Sacred Heart, a name that became the name of the congregation he was to found, was predominantly a trait he had inherited from his mother. At fourteen, Leon Dehon resolved to become a priest. In 1859, he registered as a student in the university, but his hopes were completely elsewhere. His Father’s wish was for his son to become a lawyer and qualify to the bar. Despite this divergence in views, Leon pursued his university studies in Paris with single-minded devotion. In 1862, he qualified as a lawyer and joined the bar. However, the thought of becoming a priest did not leave him. On October 25, 1865, Leon Dehon entered the French seminary of St. Chiara in Rome as the final and decisive step in making his lifetime ambition real. He was ordained on December 19, 1868, in the Cathedral Church of St. John Lateran. In November 1871, Father Dehon became curate in the parish of St. Quentin in the diocese of Soissons. It was from St. Quentin that the idea of founding a Missionary Order began to take root. The group, which he later founded, interlaced together the devotion to the Sacred and the name of the first parish where he was a curate.\n\nCopyright © 2012. Langaa RPCIG. All rights reserved.\n\nThe First Sacred Heart of Jesus Missionaries When The Sacred Congregation for the Propagation of the Faith (Propaganda Fidei) and the Civil Authority called for missionaries to undertake the evangelisation of the upper Congo, Father Dehon saw it as a sign of divine providence to realise his dream. Congo remained an outlandish area even for European explorers. Like other vast areas of the tropical rainforest, it had literally become the Whiteman’s grave. Initial missionary incursions proved deadly. It seemed exceedingly difficult for foreigners to avoid deadly fevers. However, these conditions did not discourage merchants in search of profit, or missionaries in search of new areas to plant the Cross and bring the inhabitants to submit to the demands of the gospel.\n\n13\n\nThe Residue of the Western Missionary in the Southern Cameroons : The Christian Village: a Sad Tale of Strife and Dissension,\n\nCopyright © 2012. Langaa RPCIG. All rights reserved.\n\nWhen the missionaries from St. Quentin arrived in Cameroon, they were directed to explore the interior of the country. It is for this reason that missionaries of the Sacred Heart of Jesus became the bearers of the gospel in the grasslands of Cameroon. They took over the station in Mamfe from the Pallotine Missionaries and opened others in Shisong and Kom in 1912 and 1913 respectively. All over the world, missionaries of different orders tended to secure specific territories and jealously keep others out. This was to avoid squabbles emanating from differences in each order’s approach to mission policy. This explains in part why the Sacred Heart Fathers concentrated on the interior, leaving the rest of the Father Leon Dehon Founder of the Missionaries of the sacred Heart of Jesus territories to other Missionary Orders. “In this connection, the preaching of the gospel can be brought more immediately and more effectively to everyone in an area if more mission stations and posts are established as soon as it is practicable to do so. Then, when the time comes to divide the mission, these will be ready to serve as centres for new Vicariates and Prefectures. While we are on this subject, we wish to single out for commendation some Vicars Apostolic who have richly earned it: those who have kept this future development steadily in mind and are constantly engaged in the work of readying new provinces for the kingdom of God. If they find that their own order or congregation is not supplying enough\n\n14\n\nThe Residue of the Western Missionary in the Southern Cameroons : The Christian Village: a Sad Tale of Strife and Dissension,\n\nmanpower for the task, they are perfectly willing to call in helpers from other religious groups.” 10 The colonization of Cameroon was a gradual process. Following the signing of the annexation treaties with the kings of the coastal regions, the chiefs, oblivious of the consequences, submitted to the colonising power, Germany. These chiefs were familiar with European traders, industrialists and plantation builders and submitted not under duress but with alacrity. They were consumed with eager longings to be numbered among the colonised people of the world. Between 1875 and 1880, reports reaching Europe from Cameroon about the political situation on the Cameroon coast implied a trend towards instability. The kings and chiefs were finding it extremely difficult to govern their own people. According to English Baptist missionaries in Victoria and Douala, every dispute, particularly between the chiefs or local traders in Douala, Bimbia and Tiko, led to war and a great loss of life. In addition, commercial rivalry between the rival village politics and between European and African traders was a source of instability, making it difficult for the chiefs to rule their own people.\n\nCopyright © 2012.

Emil Schultze endorsed these clauses as acceptable to the Germans before they were submitted to Nachtigal for final approval. However, the actual treaty of annexation that was prepared for signature by the Germans and the chiefs did not contain all the clauses that the chiefs had submitted. 11 On July 12, 1884, the treaty was signed on the side of the African chiefs by King Bell, King Akwa and a number of their Duala 12footnote reference absent subjects and a couple of German subjects.

They were determined to disregard almost every clause of the treaty that guaranteed the protection of the rights of the colonised people. Another controversial issue was the rights of chiefdoms that had no knowledge of the treaty signed by the coastal chiefs. It is for this reason that German attempts to penetrate and subjugate the people of the Grass Fields met with stiff resistance, resulting in huge human costs on both the European and African sides. The hinterland theory, which loomed large in the background during the Berlin conference of 1884-1885, was the basis on which the German explorers exploited the people of hinterlands. The hinterland theory stipulated, in principle, that any power in control of any portion of the African coastland had the right to acquire the hinterland from which it derived its exports and within which it distributed its exports. Article VI of the Berlin Act, stated that European traders, missionaries and other agents should have free access to the interior of Africa so that the slave trade and slavery should finally be crushed and the benefits of European civilisation made freely available to its entire people. It was with this frame of mind that the Germans launched punitive and barbaric expeditions in the Grass Fields, bringing to submission rebel chiefdoms. The German aims were very precise and African chiefs had no option. German rule in the Grass Fields was attained at a high cost, grave enough to alter population dynamics for years to come. With the establishment of the ‘Bezirk’ headquarters, regular officers were posted there and the pacification policy was further pursued. Strümpell became the first head of the station and carried out some punitive expeditions. Others such as Pavel, Glauning, Hirtler, Adametz and Werner systematically explored the region, subjugating tribal groups. Between 1901 and 1913, punitive expeditions took over 2500 prisoners and over 2000 were killed in the fighting. 13 Colonial authorities cleared the way for missionaries and early experience with German colonial officers facilitated missionary work. The colonial authorities forcefully imposed their rule and presence. However, the missionaries were required to negotiate their entry in any given community, 13\n\nPaul Nchoji Nkwi (1989) The German Presence in the Western Grassfields 1891-\n\n1913, A German Colonial Account- Leiden: African Studies Centre -111.

Generally, the missionaries were peacefully received in the localities. The Fons and chiefs of the Grass Fields had learnt, however, that permission was no longer a sine qua non condition for foreigners to operate in one’s territory. After the bitter experiences with the Germans, the Fons of Kom and Nso had learnt this the hard way. On February 11, 1902, Pavel filed a report from Banyo, giving a description of his journey from Bali to Banyo. “Leaving Bali on January 8 with 5 officers, 150 black soldiers and 600 carriers, the expedition received a warm reception at Bambui where the Fon of Kom and the chiefs of Bambili, Bambui and Mejang had gathered to welcome him. Again, the chiefs rejoiced over the Bafut defeat and pledged to supply both labour and provisions to the new station. Bafut appears to have been a nuisance in the region because of its frequent predatory raids. The expedition moved on to Bamesing and Babungo where they received similar pledges from chiefs. On December 15, it reached Kumbo and the Fon of Nso declared his recognition of German sovereignty. The Germans interpreted this immediate declaration of total submission as the result of the humiliating defeat of Bafut. That punitive action on Bafut had proven enormously helpful. 14 Many of the chiefs had overestimated German goodwill and underestimated German military might when they freely pledged their sovereignty to Germany. Harsh demands alienated the chiefs, provoking indigenous rebuffs that in turn resulted in military reprisals against insolent chiefs. The Fon of Nso’s refusal to comply with German demands provoked a full-scale war in 1906. Several Nso men and women were taken prisoners. On May 10, a patrol of the sixth Company was involved in a violent clash in which 30 people were killed on the enemy’s side. The Fon was wounded but escaped. On May 28, the first Nso people arrived to ask for peace and\n\nCopyright © 2012. Langaa RPCIG. All rights reserved.\n\nGerman trained Militia from Bali.

The chief councillor of the Fon of Nso only arrived on June 5 to ask for peace. 15 The apparent allegiance of Kom to the colonial rulers was short-lived. In 1904, Fon Yu rejected the German demands for labour, provoking a German military invasion of Kom. The German offensive was determined and bitter: all villages on their path were burned down completely, the palace at Laikom was occupied and later burnt and crops were destroyed. Fon Yu went into hiding and, after seven months of battle, was persuaded in 1905 to sign a peace pact with the German aggressor, thereby placing Kom under German administration. A shortage of old men in Kom in the 1920s is testimony to the severity of the confrontation between the Germans and the Kom people: the men fled during the German offensive and died of cold and hunger. 16 It was under these brutal, barbaric and vicious circumstances that the third wave of evangelisation began in earnest. Up to the 1800s, even though there were many religious institutes that were missionary in outlook and character, Africa remained largely an unexplored area for them. The evangelisation of China and Latin America was a natural consequence of colonialism. Jesuit missionaries, who championed and pioneered primary evangelisation of Asia and Latin America, followed the ships of their own nations, which provided both the means and protection for their mission. When a Portuguese explorer sailed onto the shores of an island off the coast of India in 1500, eight Franciscans landed with him. The Spanish missionaries went in great numbers to the New World, following the explorers and soldiers whose purpose was conquest. Displaying a white standard ornamented with the purple cross of the divine Redeemer, the ships that transported the intrepid explorers bound for the western shores and islands of Africa carried missionaries. Henry the Navigator supported the colonial and sacred expeditions, so the missionaries could subject the barbarians to the sweet yoke of Jesus Christ. 17\n\n15Ibid. 16\n\nJacqueline de Vries (1998) Catholic Mission, Colonial Government and Indigenous\n\nResponse in Kom (Cameroon) African Studies Centre Research Report 56/1998 17\n\nPius XII, Saeculo Exeunte Octavo, Encyclical letter on the eighteen century of the\n\nindependence of Portugal no.6\n\n18\n\nThe Residue of the Western Missionary in the Southern Cameroons : The Christian Village: a Sad Tale of Strife and Dissension,\n\nIt was the same with the prince of the Portuguese explorers, Vasco Da Gama, who, weighing anchor to begin his fortunate trip to India, had with him two religious men of the Order of the Most Holy Trinity. One of them, after bringing the light of the gospel to India with apostolic zeal, suffered martyrdom. However, just as in all ages of the Church, so also at that time and in those far distant regions, the blood of this martyr and of the other heroic missionaries of Portugal became the seed of Christianity. Their illustrious example greatly inspired the Catholic world, including the spirited citizens of Portugal, to promote more widely the works of the apostolate. 18\n\nCopyright © 2012. Langaa RPCIG.

As far back as that time, the missionaries lamented the fact 19 that after 14 years of European visits to Bali “one does not very much feel the advance of European culture” except that Pidgin English was spoken and some trade was going on in European imported objects. Nevertheless, the missionaries were definitely impressed with their first contact in the Grass Fields. “Nowhere before had l been as much aware of the mission’s cultural importance and of the Importance of its action in the upbringing of a people as l was in this circumstance. What would become of our colonies without the Fon Galega II of Bali missions? I kept asking myself this question without trying to come up with an answer. But it is certain that after a short period of our activities among the Balis, there would be remarkable progress in cultural relations. As an example, we can mention the Bakoko and 18Ibid.\n\nno.7\n\n19STEINER,\n\n“Im lande der Bau” In: Evangelisches Missions Magazin, 1903 in Paul Nchoji\n\nNkwi(1989) The German Presence in the Western Grassfields 1891-1913 A German Colonial Account- Leiden: African Studies Centre -111. - Research reports / African Studies Centre.\n\n19\n\nThe Residue of the Western Missionary in the Southern Cameroons : The Christian Village: a Sad Tale of Strife and Dissension,\n\nCopyright © 2012.

The number soon increased to 150. The 1906 report of missionary efforts recounts further attempts to expand their influence in the Grass Fields. The school was expanded with the support of the Fon of Bali and missionary Göshing brought a printing press to print, bind and distribute biblical and school material. The hanging of the chief of Bababju was reported by the missionaries, demonstrating their capacity to win over Bali and other chiefs in the neighbourhood from hostile behaviour. Attempts were made from Bali to create a mission station in Bamum after missionary Stolz visited Foumban. Njoya was about 26 years old. Despite Njoya’s hesitation, the Basel mission was permitted to set up a station in Bamum, which according to the missionaries was to check the irresistible advance of Islam. The third and most remarkable phase of the introduction of Christianity in Africa was characterised by missionary activity backed by an effective colonial presence on the ground. The nineteenth century witnessed the arrival of empire builders, explorers, missionaries and traders simultaneously with colonial occupation, which bequeathed an image of Christianity tinted by colonial rule. The years following the colonization of Africa saw the last of the unknown territories. These years also saw the missionaries of the Church following the newly blazed trails into the interior. One could rightly say that it was difficult to find an island remote enough to escape the vigilance and the energy of the missionaries. Colonialism and Christianity combined into a lethal force, eroding long standing cultural practices. These strange bedfellows, often at loggerheads, perpetually existing in acrimony, were in the eyes of some traditional authorities, birds of the same feather with one ambition. German Colonization and Christianity From 1884 until the defeat of Germany in the First World War, Cameroon was officially a German protectorate, Kamerun. 21 Native\n\n20\n\nIbid.\n\n20\n\nThe Residue of the Western Missionary in the Southern Cameroons : The Christian Village: a Sad Tale of Strife and Dissension,\n\nresistance to German rule was so rife that even when the First World War broke out in 1914, thirty years later, German authority was still not firmly established in large parts of the territory. All forms of passive and armed confrontation badgered the German administration throughout its presence in Cameroon. The Bamenda Grassfields provided the German colonizers with heavy armed resistance. From 1888 until 1912, German rule in the Grass Fields was characterized by ruthless military incursions. Large parts of the Grass Fields were brought under German rule as late as 1907, seven years before the Germans were expelled from Cameroon. Germany’s aim in colonizing Cameroon was above all an economic one. Unlike her successors, Britain and France, who were at least nominally subject to conditions stipulated by the League of Nations, Germany had no benevolent motives whatsoever in its colonizing enterprise, nor did it attempt to cloak its economic interests in terms of a civilizing mission. This purely economic aim inevitably had repercussions on the form of government and the relationship with indigenes. The German presence in Cameroon ended due to the outbreak of the First World War, which prompted Britain and France to invade the territory. The greatly outnumbered German forces were forced to retreat from Cameroon in December 1915, when Colonel Zimmerman fled to Spanish Guinea with most of the German troops. 22 The ensuing confinement of the German troops and their supporters on the island of Fernando Po constitutes an important episode in Cameroonian colonial history. By German estimates, almost 15,000 people made the exodus from Cameroon, slightly less than 1000 of them Europeans. 23 The policy adopted by German colonial authorities with regard to missions was tailored to suit the overall aim of German colonization. 21Britain\n\nadministered Cameroon as an integral part of the colony and protectorate of\n\nCopyright © 2012.

The lack of government initiative resulted in a near-monopoly on education by missionary organizations. The first missionary organization to concern itself with Cameroon was the English Baptist Mission, which was taken over in 1886 by the Protestant Basel Mission, as the Baptists had encountered difficulties with the German colonial authorities. 24 Initially, the Basel Mission was considered by the German colonial administration to be more or less a state Church, hence Catholic missions found it difficult to obtain entry to Cameroon. 25 In 1889, the Catholic Pallotine Fathers obtained permission to operate in areas not yet covered by the Basel Mission and established a mission station at Bojongo near the coast. It appears that the German administrators welcomed the establishment of a Catholic Mission at that time because the Basel Mission had failed to provide German-speaking native clerks and agents. The Basel Mission had also encountered problems with the German government because the mission resisted the colonial government’s oppressive measures with regard to forced labour and land expropriation. 26\n\n24\n\nNgoh, Victor Julius (1987), Cameroon 1884 - 1985: A Hundred Years of History,\n\nYaoundé. 25\n\nNdi, Anthony Mbunwe (1983), MILL HILL Missionaries and the State in Southern\n\nCameroons, 1922-1962, London. 26\n\nObdeijn, H.L.M.

The German missions relied heavily on the support of local catechists. Most of the early Christians in the Bamenda Grass Fields were plantation labourers who had been baptized by the Pallotine Fathers after receiving rigorous religious instruction for two to three years.

In practice, they ran the whole mission during the absence of ordained priests. 28 The outbreak of World War I did not put an end to the German missionary influence in Kom, for the German Schutztruppe in the Bamenda area included three Catholic priests and five brothers. 29 In the long run, the influence of these priests was to be far greater than the influence exerted by the pioneer missionaries who had settled at Fujua. Only in 1919 were the Cameroonian soldiers who had been interned in Fernando Po repatriated. In northern Cameroon, German troops maintained control until Garoua was captured by Allied forces in June 1915. As early as September 1914, however, when the Germans had been ousted from Douala, colonial rule in the Bamenda Grass Fields had essentially become a British affair. Eventually, the Treaty of Versailles stipulated that Germany should relinquish all her colonies to the Allied and Associated powers and German Kamerun was divided between Britain and France.

The problems inherent in such a system necessitated a change in strategy. At least the condominium administration provided for the provisional administration of Cameroon until the Germans were completely expelled. Separate French and British administrative structures were set up in 1916. It was not until July 10, 1919, that the British and French colonial Ministers, Alfred Lord Milner and Monsieur Henri Simon, signed the famous Simon-Milner Declaration recommending the adoption by the League of the final partition of Cameroon.\n\nCopyright © 2012.

All rights reserved.\n\nIntervention of the Sacred Congregation for the Propagation of the Faith With the departure of the Pallotine Missionaries and the Sacred Heart Missionaries, the future of their missions in the Cameroons became very uncertain. With the establishment of the condominium, the Vatican moved swiftly to open negotiation with the British authorities. On September 20, 1919, Cardinal Gasparri addressed a letter to the British Chargé d’affaires in connection with the British Cameroons Catholic Missions. Among the African Missions from which missionaries of German nationality were expelled, there was in particular the prefecture Apostolic of Adamawa under the charge of the Congregation of the Sacred Heart. The superior of this congregation, Father Leon Dehon, had informed the Holy See of the early dispatch of French Missionaries to the prefecture. At the time of the expulsion, Captain Cook, Commander of the local British forces, had sequestrated all the property of the Mission, including 30,000 francs in silver at Kumbo, 5 horses, 20 cows, sheep and implements. The provisional management of the mission had been entrusted to Father Shanahan by 1919. In bringing the above information to the British chargé d’affaires, Cardinal Gasparri, the Cardinal Secretary of the State to His Holiness, requested him to approach the British Government for the property sequestrated by the military to be handed over to the present manager of the mission as had already been done in several analogous cases. In an ordinance to make provision for giving effect to article 438 of the peace with Germany 26\n\nThe Residue of the Western Missionary in the Southern Cameroons : The Christian Village: a Sad Tale of Strife and Dissension,\n\nCopyright © 2012.

All rights reserved.\n\nas to the property of Christian religious missions formerly maintained by the Germans in the British Cameroons, signed on June 28, 1919 “The Allied and Associated powers agreed that where Christian religious missions were being maintained by German societies or persons in the territory belonging to them, or of which the Government is entrusted to them in accordance with the present treaty, the property which these missions or missionary societies possessed, including that of trading societies whose profits were devoted to the support of missions were to be continued to be devoted to missionary purposes. And in order to ensure the due execution of this undertaking, the allied and associated governments were to hand over such property to Boards of Trustees appointed by or approved by the Governments and composed of persons holding the faith of the mission whose property was involved”. 30 This board was never constituted because in 1927 the Under Secretary of State decided otherwise. In a letter to Reverend Henry Francis, he wrote, “I am directed by Mr. Secretary Amery to inform you that it has now been decided it will not be necessary to constitute a Board of Trustees for the Ex-German Mission property in the British Cameroons. The Nigerian government proposes to repeal the German Missions ordinance of 1925 and it will then be prepared to approve the vesting of the property of the exGerman Roman Catholic Missions in the St. Joseph’s Society for Foreign Missions and to dispense with the formalities required by vesting in the Board of Trustees.” 31 G.S. Podevin, District Officer in charge of Bamenda Division, in a memorandum to the Resident of British Cameroons in Buea, said that he had received no intimation or any instructions regarding the intention of the government to permit any continuance of religious propaganda in the Division, but that, owing to a private communication he had received from Father Krafft at Calabar, it appeared that the Roman Catholic Missions were contemplating some activity in the area. Father Krafft had asked Podevin to 30\n\nAn Ordinance to make provision for giving effect to article 438 of the peace with\n\nGermany as to the property of Christian religious missions formerly maintained by the Germans in the British Cameroons, signed on the June 28, 1919: Article 438 of the Peace Treaty 31\n\nBNA-Sd 1916/1, Correspondence from John A.

All rights reserved.\n\nadvise him about roads and accommodation available at the missions in the Division as he wanted to visit in the near future “part of his flocks roaming without pastors” in conjunction with Father Shanahan. Podevin, in his answer to Father Kraft’s letter, advised him to communicate with the government before undertaking any such expedition, as he was not in a position to give him the necessary authority to do so. During nearly seventeen years of service in Africa, Podevin had many opportunities to observe the efforts of missionaries and it seemed to him that the Roman Catholics were invariably the most successful and achieved the most satisfactory results in their dealings with natives. Although Podevin was not a Roman Catholic himself, he preferred Catholic Missions to those of any other denomination in any area he had administered. Despite his love for Catholic Missions in general, he recommended that Fathers Krafft and Shanahan be prevented from pursuing their activities in the division “for the time being” upon purely political grounds. Although he appreciated the possibility that such efforts in normal times might be productive and of much good, he maintained that missionary activity in the division should be postponed to a later date. In fact, he recommended that no facilities be granted to religious bodies to establish themselves in the Bamenda Division. He advanced several reasons. “That Owing to the present unsettled times after the war and with due regard to the very uncertain hold exercised by the British upon the conduct of native affairs in the Cameroons, due principally to inadequate political staff, the immediate post-war years were in his view an inopportune moment to introduce any influence that would minimize or depreciate British efforts in the Cameroons. The consensus of the chiefs was not altogether in favour of the re-establishment of missions. Chiefs he had interviewed affirmed and assured him emphatically that the German missionaries undermined their authority and created many difficulties. These chiefs also informed him that, since the closing of the German missions, these difficulties had largely disappeared and they were able to exercise much more efficient control over their “boys”. 32\n\n32\n\nBNA-Sd 1916/1, Confidential Memorandum from G.S.

One letter he (Podevin) had censored- and did not deliver – was addressed to the Head Chief of Bekom. This man requested that the Chief look after his women and repair the government buildings. He said without exaggeration that he had received at least 200 letters and post cards from Fernando Po addressed to natives in this Division since he had been in charge of Bamenda and exmission boys wrote the majority of them. Certainly, most of them were written at the instigation of German missionaries and - judging by the handwriting – many were written by the Missionaries themselves. He concluded that, “If the missions were re-opened before a definite conclusion in the war is arrived at and before we know whether this portion of the Cameroons is to be British Territory or not I cannot help thinking that an altogether erroneous impression will be formed by the native mind.” 33 The subject of the property of the German Missions in Cameroon received due attention during the peace treaties. An ordinance was enacted to give effect to article 438 of the treaty that referred to the property of Christian religious missions formerly maintained by Germans in the British Cameroons. Mission here went beyond the narrow definition of Christian missions to include their moveable and immoveable property. The German Missions Ordinance of 1924 stated clearly that: “Missions included any missionary society or trading society whose profits were devoted to the support of a missionary society. “German national” referred to a person who was a subject or citizen of Germany or who, having at any time been such a subject or citizen, had changed his allegiance as a result of recognition of new States or territorial rearrangements, or naturalized in any British possession or, before the treaty of Peace with Germany came into force, in any Foreign State in accordance with the law thereof and when actually resident therein and did not retain according to the law of Germany the nationality of that State and included an association, company or corporation incorporated under the law of Germany. German mission property meant all property whether moveable or immoveable which on the 10th day of January, 1920, belonged to or was held in trust for a Christian religious mission maintained in Nigeria by a German 33BNA-Sd\n\n1921/1, Memorandum from G.S.

The right to transfer German mission property was vested in the Governor” 34. The same ordinance went on to add that “With the consent of Secretary of State, the Governor could declare every right, title, or interest of any person other than His majesty and other than subsisting rights of way or apparent easements to and in any of the said properties and the benefit of any covenant, agreement or reservation in support of any such right, title or interest to or in any of the said properties to be extinguished and no action or proceeding shall be capable of being taken or proceeded with to enforce the same. It empowered the Governor to transfer all German mission property to trustees appointed by or approved by the Secretary of State and holding the faith of the mission whose property was involved to be held upon such trusts as the Secretary of State may from time to time determine. The Governor could transfer to the trustees any interest in land, being German mission property, for such estate or interest as he may think fit subject to the sanction of the Secretary of State. Any provision of the land registration ordinance to the contrary notwithstanding, any instrument declaring the trusts on which any German mission property was to be held and purporting to be signed by the Secretary of State or the Governor may be registered in the land registry at Lagos” 35.\n\nCopyright © 2012.

A document from Rome appointed him Administrator of the Prefecture of Adamawa. However, owing to persistent ill health, he was unable to make a reconnaissance journey of his new mission territory until late in 1918. It was a vast territory without priests and leadership among Christians who had not been forcefully sent to Fernando Po was in the hands of catechists. At the end of the tour of the territory in his famous 1000 miles journey, he wrote the following in his report to Rome, which struck a firm note of optimism: 34\n\nBNA-Sd 1916/1, German Mission Ordinance, 1924, cited by A.D.A.

Their constancy during the four years of severe trial has been admirable. There is a splendid future before a mission which after two or three years of existence has been able to produce such splendid soul.” 36 Adamawa was the part of the Cameroons that adjoined Southern Nigeria and it had been placed under British rule after the Germans were driven out. The missionaries in Adamawa had been German priests of the Sacred Heart Congregation. With their departure, the prefecture was left completely without priests. Shanahan estimated that the trek through Adamawa would take three or four months and cover about a thousand miles through some of the most difficult and rugged terrain on the African continent.
