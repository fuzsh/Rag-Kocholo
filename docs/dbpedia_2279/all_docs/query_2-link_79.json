The Nigerian Consul General to Cameroon's South West and North West regions urged former inmates of the Buea central prison to make the best of their lives and avoid further criminal acts. He spoke after donating seeds worth FCFA 3 million to the former inmates. The Consul General partnered with other Nigerians to secure the release of the inmates, noting the process was difficult. He called on the former inmates to be morally upright and make their lives better. One of the inmates thanked the Consul General for the support during their trying time after regaining freedom.",
