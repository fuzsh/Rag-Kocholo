        "text": "\"THE PAST AS PERCEIVED BY THE BALI NYONGA Nyongpasi's stay with the Bamoums was short-lived, as he was constandy under attack from king Mbuo-Mbuo Njoya. Between 1845 and 1848 Nyongpasi and his people were driven across the Nun river to Bagham, where they regrouped and moved towards Bamenda. After staying in Nkwen for a while, they moved to Kufon, near the present Protestant college Bali, defeated the Bali Kontan and incorporated them into the Bali army. During the long journey from Foumban to Kufom, Nyongpasi and his people subdued and in-corporated many other people. These were the Won, the Set, the Ngiam, the Sang, the Ngod, the Sangam, the Fuleng and the Munyam people, who today form a great part of Bali Nyonga. These people are usually referred to as Bani Bantem or Bani Balolo, because they were not part of the original Bali group.\" In Who Needs the Past?, 206–7. Routledge, 2012. http://dx.doi.org/10.4324/9780203059999-59.\n\nFull text"
