This document is the preface to the Cameroon Hymnal, a collection of Catholic hymns authorized by the bishops of the Bamenda Ecclesiastical Province of Cameroon. It was compiled by a committee to include a wide selection of hymns from various sources in order to foster active participation in liturgical services. The preface expresses hope that the hymnal will promote greater liturgical unity and congregational singing in the province. It was approved by the Archbishop of Bamenda and first printed in 1984.",
