        "text": "As we continue to celebrate the 50-year Anniversary of the Second Vatican Council, we recall the historical foundations of African Small Christian Communities (SCCs) in the People of God Model of Church and in the communion ecclesiology of Vatican II. A study of five documents of Vatican II reveals that Small Christian Communities are one of the great fruits of the council and an awakening of the church as the People/Nation of God. The founding fathers of AMECEA had a vision of implementing Vatican II’s ecclesiology of communion in Eastern Africa that focused on the communion (koinonia) and service (diakonia) aspects. Both African Synods built on the foundations of Vatican II and highlighted the pastoral and missionary role of SCCs. This article integrates the positions of three speakers at the Theological Symposium 2013. Pastoral, parish-based SCCs are part of the “new face” of the parish and a significant part of a new way of being parish from below. The parish is a communion or network of SCCs within the “communion of communities” ecclesiology. Today there are over 160,000 Small Christian Communities in the nine AMECEA countries in Eastern Africa. Kenya alone has over 45,000 SCCs. We are optimistic that the experience of SCCs as a New Model of Church from the grassroots as witnessed by SCC members in Africa will bring significant changes in new pastoral structures corresponding to our contemporary communion ecclesiology and the ecclesial reality on the local level.\n\nThe general theme of the present volume of our journal is “Governance in Institutes of Consecrated Life in the Catholic Church in Africa”. The theme was chosen before the Covid19 crisis began in most African countries, including Nigeria. The idea was to explore, in particular, the significance, challenges, opportunities, and prospects of leadership. The emergence of the covid-19 crisis, though a coincidence, turned out to present new challenges and opportunities, and perhaps highlighted other latent challenges, in the governance. The crisis has led consecrated persons to seek or to explore new approaches to living a life in common, open new possibilities of mission, to consider new ways of living out their apostolate. At least, it called everyone to reflect anew on the ways to lead and live consecrated life in times of worldwide emergency crisis and attendant restrictions such as those caused by this pandemic. Through articles from various perspectives, this edition proposes studies and perspectives on some vital issues and the challenges, opportunities, and prospects of governance in Institutes of Consecrated Life in the Catholic Church in Africa.\n\nChapter in an forthcoming Orbis Book (Maryknoll, NY) from the Third Theological Colloquium on Church, Religion and Society in Africa (TCCRSA III) in Nairobi, Kenya in July, 2015 on the Theme: “An Agenda for Vatican III: Ideas, Issues, and Resources from Africa or the World Church.” Treats: 1. \"Introduction: Be Bold and Creative\" 2. \"Rethinking the Structures and Styles of Governing and Decision-making.\" 3. \"From the Perspective of SCCs in Eastern Africa.\" 4. Pastoral Solutions to the Two Meanings of the Eucharistic Famine in Africa 5. \"Integrating African Process and African Content.\" 6. \"Relevance for the Catholic Church in North America and Europe.\" 7. \"Conclusion: Let Us Journey Ahead Together.\""
